I have not made this recipe yet, but while reading the reviews I noticed many people having trouble ending up with a soggy crust and overcooked toppings.  To avoid this, you must work with a pizza stone and a pizza peel.  Place the stone in your oven, preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Allow the pizza stone to heat for 30 minutes at this temperature.  Meanwhile prepare your pizza on your floured pizza peel (be sure to give your pizza crust a little shake on the peel prior to putting on your toppings so that you can add more flour if necessary - doing this will ensure that it will slide off easily onto the stone ).  Once you are sure your pizza will slide off easily, top it however you want and then slide it very carefully onto the stone in the oven.  Heating the stone for 30 minutes prior to baking the pizza will ensure a thoroughly cooked crispy pizza crust.  Watch your pizza very carefully as it will cook fast at this temperature.

The dough is beautiful and tasty.  I divided it into 3, and made a 16" pizza.  But I think just dividing it in half for a pizza that size would be good too.  It just depends if you like thinner or thicker crusts.  After I rolled it out and let it rise for 10 or 15 minutes, I prebaked it for about 10 minutes at 350F.  That helps keep the crust from getting soggy and you don't have to bake it so long with the toppings, which can easily burn at 425F.

I woke up this morning with the first thing on my mind being RATE THIS DOUGH!
Last night I used this recipe to make pizza and calzones and it was PERFECT. I don't know if it was entirely this recipe or the new whole grain flour I used from Healthy Choice, but the taste and texture were very good. So, yes, I used the whole grain all-purpose in lieu of the bread flour (which I never use these days).  I used the dough cycle of my bread machine and when I began to roll out my dough it was an absolute pleasure. It was doughy and yeasty, but no too sticky. I added parmesan cheese and pizza herbs and garlic to the dough which yielded a flavorful, flexible dough that rose slightly (not too thick).  When I have used other pizza doughs, they have been rather hard to manage in comparison and have risen so much during baking that the recipe for pepperoni bread (also found on this site) was too "bready" in a lot of spots.  I may still alternate w/ other pizza dough recipes, but at this point, this is by far my favorite, especially for calzones and pepperoni breads.

This is our favorite crust from all the recipes here. My husband asked me to just make this one every time from now on. This one gets even better after we freeze it and thaw it for later use. I made these thin and crispy. Directions were easy to follow, dough was easy to handle. It made 3 large crusts as stated, I froze two, so I'll update later as to how they worked out. I did not prebake this and it turned out great. An awesome crust recipe, I am pleased in how this turned out and I do highly recommend this. This is even better that Jay's signature crust.
UPDATE: I thawed one crust out for lunch today and the pizza that resulted was fabulous! The crust came out very light with a crispy crunchy outside and soft inside. This was better than any pizza chain pizza crust ever thought to be! I cooked this for only 16 minutes, it would have burned in 20. This dough is so easy to work with, it is incredible. *****5 stars***** I still have 1 crust left in the freezer, yippee! I am so delighted with this recipe.

I'm very disappointed by this recipe.  Since it was featured in an Allrecipe's cookbook and had such high rating, I had to try it.  I had no problem with the prep, rising, etc., but when we tasted it, it was more like wheat bread with pizza toppings.  If you're looking for traditional pizza dough, this is not it.  The consistency is like bread, not dough...maybe from the bread flour.  Also, dough takes longer to cook than toppings and is puffy and soggy.  I won't be making this again.

I make this dough in my bread machine, and it turns out great.  You just put the liquid ingredients first and the yeast last, and allow first rise in the machine.  After, roll it out, top, and bake as in the recipe.  Just a tip if you divide by three to make only one crust, 1/2 pack of yeast, not 1/3.  It rises better.

Perfect pizza dough!  It keeps in the refrigerator, too.  I made this five days ago, and baked half of it right away.  I baked the other half today, and it was great.  I baked it for 10 minutes, and then took it out to add the toppings, and continued baking for another 10 minutes.  My guests loved it (as did I)!

I have made this recipe 3 times and each time it has been perfect.  My husband used to work at a pizza place where they made dough from scratch. He had a great time tossing it and it ranked high on his standards!

This dough is so good and inexpensive. I make enough for 3 pizzas and freeze 2 of them. Good recipe for breadsticks too. Thank you for sharing it.

An excellent recipe for pizza crust, as well as calzones, or even rolls. It reminded me very much of a dough we did in culinary school in Naples. I did reduce the wheat flour to 1/4 cup, and I added some olive oil and some Italian spices.
If you have a pizza stone, then use it. Pre-heat the oven and stone at 500f. for 30 minutes.
If you are making a thick crust, pre-bake on the stone for 8 to 10 minutes. If a thin crust is what you desire, then pre-baking is not necessary. Just don't let the sauce and ingredients sit too long before you pop it into the oven.
If you have a peel, throw some corn meal on the peel (I don't use flour), place the crust on top, add the toppings, and slid it onto the heated stone.
This recipe also works great on the grill. Just make sure the grill is cleaned and lightly oiled before throwing the pizza on. You should have a medium-high fire going. Then add the pizza, close the top. About fifteen minutes later... instant love.

I have tried so many pizza doughs looking for the perfect one. I had one from Julia Child's baking book that was my favorite for awhile, but this  recipe is the bomb! I discovered this one about a year ago. It doesn't look like anything special from the actual recipe and I only tried it because of all the great reviews. I discovered the reviews are true. I've made this plain  and I've made this with a couple of Tbs of Italian/Pizza spice added. It always comes out great. I use a pizza stone and prepare a baker's peel with cornmeal, which gives a nice crunchy pizzeria style bottom crust. If you haven't tried this yet and are looking for a good pizza crust you'll be pleased by this one.

I loved this dough!  I mixed it up in the Kitchenaide.  I let it rise for about 2 or 3 hours.  It rose over the top of the bowl!  There was enough for 3 full size pizzas.  I parbaked on a pizza stone for 3 minutes, then added toppings and baked for 10 minutes in a 500 degree oven.  Nice and crispy on the bottom, chewy at the edge crust.  I love the color the wheat flour gives it.  Yummy!  It will become a tradition in our house.  Topped with sauce, Parmesan cheese, spinach, garlic, mozzerella, dollops of ricotta and a little Aleepo pepper.  Wowza.  It was as good as a pizzeria pizza.

We LOVED this! No more ordering out for pizza, especially since the dough keeps well. I used 2 c. wheat flour on our first batch, which I will reduce to 1 c. next time. Update: This recipe is now a staple in my freezer. We divide it into 6 for easy individual sized pizzas. They thaw enough to roll out in about an hour.

Unbelievably good! My husband worked in a pizza place for 13 years, so he knows pie - and he loved this crust! I used all whole wheat flour (no white) and it turned out exceptionally well. Definitely add the italian seasoning and some crushed red pepper for extra zing!

I made this a week ago with my 4-year-old daughter's help.  did the 1 cup WW flour and 5 cups all purpose (didn't have bread flour). This made the BEST ultra thin crust pizza yet!! Might try adding some garlic powder or dried herbs to the dough next time but rolls out fantastic with rolling pin to make a super thin crust - trying to duplicate Papa Murphy's DeLite pizza.  after rolled out super thin - drape over the rolling pin or fold into quarters and transfer to mesh pizza pan or perforated pizza pan & top as usual - makes excellent browned, crunchy crust @ 425 for maybe 8 minutes.  I divided up into 5 equal size pieces, made 2 pizzas that night, froze the other dough balls each wrapped in plastic wrap, & made 2 thin-crust calzones last night out of 1 dough ball.  baked the thin-crust calzones @425 for about 12 to 13 minutes.  took the dough about an hour to thaw & then ready for use.  will try to tweak it a little more for flavors, but overall GREAT!!  Will definitely make again!!

This is perfection in homemade pizza dough. I've tried so many others, including 5 star recipes on this site without any success in pizza dough. This one was incredible. It didn't get soggy and was good even days later. For those like me who have trouble with soggy homemade pizza, add the sauce and cook it for 8 minutes with just the sauce on and then finish cooking with the cheese and toppings. Just great, can't say enough good. Fool-proof. For future reviewers: how do you freeze the dough, do you freeze it in a ball or already in pizza shape?

My husband and I have made this crust for pizza probably once a month for the past two years. It is definitely a family hit and we have stopped ordering out pizza because of it. FYI, 1 pkg. yeast = 2 1/4 tsp, but if the crust doesn't rise as much as you want, try adding another 1/4 or 1/2 tsp the next time you make it. I also never use wheat flour (I never buy any) so I just add all the amounts of the flours and use my all-purpose flour. It tastes great! We had a problem with it being too doughy so we always bake just the crust for 10 minutes until slightly crispy and then add the toppings and cook until the cheese melts.

This has become our standard pizza dough recipe.  It is very easy to make (I use my stand mixer and dough hook.)  I like that it uses some whole wheat flour too.  This is a good basic crust.  (To be honest we usually used the packaged stuff for homemade pizzas, but not anymore!)  My kids are not too adventurous when it comes to pizza, so we tend not to "spice" up our dough, although I do agree with other reviewers that it could benefit from some seasoning.  I find this recipe to be very kid pleasing and we even plan to use it for my daughter's "Kids in the kitchen" birthday party in a few weeks.  One last note, when proofing dough, I find that covering it and placing it an a cool oven, along with a 9x13 dish of boiling water on the rack below it works very well.

Yummy!  I've made pizza dough a couple of times before using other recipes, and this was by far the best and easiest.  I did make a few small changes.  I didn't have bread flour, so I substituted all-purpose.  I used 1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour, and 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour.  I also added 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning, and approx. 1/4 tsp. onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I rolled the dough on a lightly floured pizza stone, and then baked it in a 425 degree oven (preheated) for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  I decided to make a barbeque chicken pizza this time, b/c I had leftover grilled chicken.  I spread Kraft original BBQ sauce on the crust.  Topped that with the leftover grilled chicken (ripped up), chopped tomato, chopped green onion, and grated cheddar cheese.  Put the pan back into the oven for approx. 15 minutes, and it was absolutely delicious!!  I NEVER eat pizza crust, but this crust was so tasty, I did!  Next time, I think I'm going to make a basil pesto chicken pizza with fresh, grated mozzarella.  This pizza dough will definitely become a regular in my house.  This was better and cheaper than anything I could buy or get delivered.  I gave one of my neighbors enough dough for one pizza, and she loved it, too.  Froze the third round of dough, and I'll use it the next time I need an easy dinner.

I can not say enough about this recipe.  It is spectacular!  The wheat flour makes the dough nice and chewey!  It makes enough for about three pizzas. It freezes very well so if it makes to much, you can save some for a later time.  I make one pizza and use the rest for a fried dough desert.  In a pan over medium heat, melt a bit of butter, and a piece of stretched out dough.  Cover and cook until the dough is cooked through.  Add sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the warm dough for a tasty sweet treat!  Delicious!

This is a VERY good pizza crust. It is low in fat, and really good. However, I would reccomend using a  bigger pan, because this pizza dough is WAY to thick and it will take forever to cook if you for it. But if you have no bigger pan, just cover the cheese on top with foil when you think it's done, and set the timer for as long as you need! My compliments to the chef. (creator)

I thought this was really tasty. I have read the reviews about soggy crusts, and I have to say, it's not the fault of this recipe. It's technique! Things I do to make the crust NOT soggy: Use a pizza stone. Roll out the crust VERY thin and do not allow to rise the second time. Bake the bare crust for 5-6 min. at 425 before putting toppings on. Spread pizza sauce very thinly on crust. Most people use too much, and this puts too much moisture in the dough. Use dry toppings (with little moisture content). Did I mention using a pizza stone? One reviewer suggested baking at 500 F. You can try this, but 425 has always worked for me.

Great recipe exactly as written, but easily adapted to different flours as others have noted.  Due to timing I had to let it rise a second time before shaping and it was fantastic.  Rolled very thin and cooked on a hot pizza stone resulted in a wonderful crisp crust; slightly thicker and cooked in a pizza pan produced a doughier, tender crust, also very good.  The reviewer that said your kids will beg for this almost daily?  Spot on...

This is a great recipe - pretty easy, once you get the hang of it.   A few tips: 1. It's better w/bread flour  2. I cut mine into 4 dough balls 3. To refrigerate, coat each dough ball lightly in olive oil and put in a quart-size baggie. Good for up to 6 days. Roll out into pizza shape and use when ready.   4. To freeze, do the same as above but then freeze. When ready to use, defrost in the fridge. Roll out into pizza shape and use as usual.  5. Preheat oven to 500 w/pizza stone inside 6. Dust cornmeal on a pizza peel and place your dough on top (you can roll it out on this as well). Don't top it until right before you put it in the oven. 7. Pizza cooks FAST - like 6 minutes or so

Excellent. We prepared this the day before and put one ball in the fridge and the other two in the freezer. Used a pre-heated pizza stone (30min at 500F) and then cooked at 425 for 15mins. Very good re-heated the next day as well. Hopefully the frozen dough has the same results.

This was sooo good! I took others' advice and did 1 full cup of wheat flour. Since I'm not a huge fan, I think next time I'll stick to the recipe, but it was still awesome! I baked it on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes on its own and then added the "unbelievably awesome bbq chicken pizza" toppings and cooked it for another 7 minutes or so. It was amazing! I've never cooked pizza before because I thought it would be too hard, and I'm not a fan of the traditional home-made pizza crust. This was thin and crunchy and amazing, though! Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe! I often double it and freeze the excess dough. (In ziploc bags w/ some olive oil.) I then take it out of the freezer the night before and thaw it in the fridge, or take it out in the morning and thaw it on the counter. If you do this, it helps for it to come to room temp before you stretch/roll it out. I also like to use wheat flour to flour the surface I work on. A good hearty dough that comes out perfect!

This was an excellent pizza crust, and very easy to make. I was cooking for two people so I cut the recipe in half. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour. The crust was delicious and just the right texture.

Wonderful dough!!! Turned out very good. I used all-purpose flour (instead of the bread flour) along with the whole wheat flour. Everyone that tried the pizza thought the dought was amazing! I definately am using this recipe everytime I make pizza. I am freezing the dough and will see how the pizza turns out when I end up using it. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a pretty good dough recipe, but I've had better. It rises well and gave me no problem in preparing. If you're looking for a recipe that works, but isn't terribly impressive taste-wise, go for it.

I go a little heavier on the olive oil and I prebake the crust 5-7 minutes, but besides that I follow the recipe as is. I use it to make vegan pizzas with my cashew ricotta recipe and it turns out great!

BIG HIT!! So Delicious I made the crust super thin and sprinkled Italian seasoning before baking...I also doubled the recipe made extra to put in the freezer. I rolled the dough out and put them in the oven for a minute or two or until dry and then put them in the freezer...thank you for the recipe super easy

Closest to brick oven pizza you can get w/out installing your own brick oven in your home. 

I started making this recipe a few years ago. Over that time I've tweaked the recipe. I believe that some of the tweaks were absolutely necessary.  You must use a mixer to incorporate the ingredients. High gluten flour is another absolute must & you can purchase it at GFS. I don't use bread flour at all. Another tweak of mine is that I use 4 tsp of yeast. If careful w/ incorporating the ingredients & don't over work the dough you will end up w/ a very airy dough when baked. After I let it rise for 1 hour I punch it down and refrigerate. I rarely ever use the dough the same day that I make it. Giving it a few days in the fridge seems to allow the extra yeast to continue to work. The final tweak that I found to be an absolute must was to bake at 500 degrees F. I lay my dough out on a pizza pan with a layer of corn meal between dough & pan, pile on the toppings for my pie & into the 500 degree oven for 6-7 min. Then carefully slide the pie off the pan & directly onto the rack for another 6-8 min depending on type & amount of toppings. Super delicious pizza every time. We RARELY ever buy pizza from a chain anymore. I make 3 batches of this dough at once & we can feed loads of people on about 12 pies. Reheat your leftovers at 400 degrees for about 9 min & just as good as when you 1st baked. I've made this dough @ home & travelled to make pizzas in Myrtle Beach & on Cape Cod. Love It..!!

I used to cook for an Italian restaurant, so I am a pizza snob. This dough is by far the best I've tried. I've added parmesan and garlic as well as just using the original recipe. It is consistently delicious!

I thought the crust was a little sticky when I put it in to rise, but it turned out perfectly.  Nice and crispy on the outside, and just chewy enough on the inside, although the toppings were a bit overdone.  I froze the unused crust, and defrosted it overnight a couple of weeks later.  This time, I pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes at 425, added sauce and toppings, and baked an additional 8 minutes.  It was perfect this way.

This was the best homemade pizza dough that I have ever made!  The consistency was perfect, and it was easy to work with and roll out.  It made so much I was able to take half and freeze for later, and it was just as good!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  It is the new favorite in our house.  I have even passed it on to some friends!

Ohhhh, yummy. I'm always looking to use whole wheat flour in things, so I was glad to see it. For this being the second pizza dough I've ever made, it turned out great-- both rolled thick and thin. We ate 2 of the crusts with the South of the Border Pizza recipe on this site and the third is in the freezer for another time. Highly reccomended.

Great crust.  It crisped up very nicely on my pizza stone and was also nicely chewy.  The dough was very easy to work with, which is a big plus in my book.  I used only 4 3/4 cups of bread flour because the dough seemed to be already coming together nicely (not sticking to the bowl which is an indication that the dough has enough flour).  I like to have a nice, moist dough to work with, even it it's a little sticky because it's simply easier to form.  This just might be my new pizza crust, after using the same one for several years!

I decided to go on with the recipe because I read all the positive reviews. However, it was a disaster. The dough was very sticky even though I added more bread flour than it should. It appeared with the right consistency when I finished kneading it. After 1h in a warm place, the dough had doubled but for my susprise it was very sticky and I couldn't roll it or even press it with my hands in the pizza pan. If anyone knows what went wrong please let me know because it seemed a nice recipe.

I made only half the recipe (with the exception of the salt & olive oil) for a 15 inch pizza stone.  The crust was very yummy!  I play with the recipe a lot, like adding garlic and shreded parmasean cheese or herbs (parsley, basil, oregano).  I reccomend this dough for anyone wanting to make a great homemade pizza!

I am from Chicago and my family LOVES pizza, I think its in our blood.  Now that we live in the South, good pizza is pretty much hard to come by. I have found the following tips helpful when making pizza at home.

I have read many complaints about puffy and soggy pizza. I always bake my pizza at higher temps, since we like thin crust pizza, 500-550F. If you like saucy pizza then I suggest pre-baking then adding sauce and toppings as to avoid the soggy center issue. I only bake on a cast iron pizza pan (Amazon) sprinkled with polenta. You can also invert a cast iron skillet and bake it on that. Remember that pizza crust is a yeast bread and yeast will rise unless controlled by salt content. To avoid over-puffing you need to dock the dough or prick surface all over with a fork. It is same technique used to prevent pie crust from puffing before filling. To add texture, I use about 1/2 cup wheat flour and substitute 2-3 tsp honey for the sugar.

For real pizzeria taste after adding toppings sprinkle with dried basil. Hope this helps!

Fabulous! Had a bit of trouble mixing it in my bread machine! Think it was just a bit too much flour? After trying twice with the dough cycle and not getting it mixed i just stuck my hand in and mixed it around a bit. Ran the dough cycle again and this time it worked perfectly! I used nutty wholewheat flour which you could hardly notice. I pushed it into a pan, baked it for 10 mins then took the base out and spread some tomato paste on, sprinkled with cheddar, garlic flakes and italian herbs and baked till cheese melted. Absolutely outstanding! Cut into small blocks for the freezer for my little girl to have for easy dinners. Cant rate this high enough!

I made this recipe in my bread machine, and it was perfect! I warmed the water in the microwave, then added 1 Tbspn of raw, organic honey instead of sugar, then added the 2 Tbspn of olive oil. I put that in the bottom of the bread machine, then started layering on top of that in this order: bread flour, whole wheat flour, and salt. Then I dug a small hole in the middle of the top of the dry ingredients and placed 2 tspns of the dry yeast in the hole. I put the machine on the "Dough" cycle, and 1 hr 35 min later I had perfectly kneaded and risen dough! It made four small pizzas that tasted wonderfully! We didn't even need cheese on top -- just tomato sauce, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic. Delicious!

I am not lying! I am just done eating the greatest pizza ever! And I used this recipe to make the dough! It was easy to make! I did pre-bake the dough at 325F for about 7 mins. then added the toppings and baked for 18 mins. at 425F. I also added a little bit of Italian Seasoning to the dough when I mixed the ingredients, it gave the crust an extra "something" that made it my husband's favorite too! I also used the special baking pans to bake pizza (not the stone but the ones with holes in them, I lightly greased it and added enough flour to the bottom side of the dough after rolling it and had NO TROUBLE at all to remove it from the pan, it didn't stick at all. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it!

it didn't turn out very well at all.  The dough never rose and it was very sticky and hard to work with. The taste was ok... I don't think I will use this recipe again

I've tried several pizza dough recipes before finding this one, and it was by far the best. (I'm a very experienced baker & know what I'm talking about.) To the reviewer that said the texture was wrong: how much did you need the dough? You must not skimp on this step! The recipe says 8 minutes, but there are a lot of variables involved. Most of the time, I find my self needing for much longer to get the desired look & feel to the dough. At least 10-15 minutes. It needs to be completely smooth, and almost silky looking. Pull it apart a few times, does it stretch or break apart? Be careful not to use to much flower while working with the dough. This is also a good recipe to hand toss if you are talented.

I saved a step by mixing the dry ingredients and added the yeast and water in the middle  I also used 1 cup whole wheat to 5 cups white flour. Added some oregano too as had seen other comments. The dough was great to work with and great tasting!

This was really chewy. And bland... I am sure you can use spices to make it taste better but I was so unimpressed I don't even want to try to make it taste better. So sad. :( I was hoping it would be tasty.

this is the first time i ever made a pizza from scratch. And I must say, this is the best pizza crust recipe so far...so much healthier than store bought pizza or take out pizzas. I follow the instruction exactly and follow other reviewers advice to pre-bake the crust for about 15 min. the crust came out perfect and crispy. I just love the way it taste. My husband, mom (not a lot of stuff pleases her), and dad..all say the crust and pizza was awesome even though i had limited ingredients for the topping...=) i'm really proud of myself after making this pizza since i'm a new-young-can't really cook that well-mom/wife..haha..overall, i wouldn't change anything in this recipe except for the pre-baking the crust before putting on the sauce and toppings. oh and also i bake the pizza  at 350 for about 20-25 minutes at first then increase to 400 for about 10 more min. or until the crust and cheese are brown ...just make sure to use a pan or a tray with holes on the bottom so the crust be crispy and check often to make sure it doesn't burn...=) all in all ***5 stars all the way for his pizza crust recipe***

I just love pizza, I dont have delivery out here, so I have to make my own. I use my own canned pizza sauce. Ah the taste of homegrown tomatoes. I did add a tbls of dried milk to the dough. It came out perfect. So easy to roll out. Great texture. I even rolled up the edges and stuffed it with mozz cheese. Thanks for posting.

Didn't use the whole wheat flour because i didn't have any. This is great and I will use it again and again. I did pre-bake the crust for about 5 minutes. It probably isn't neccessary unless you like crunchy pizza like I do.

This made 3 great pizzas that were just the right texture, flavor and chewyness.  This was also extremely easy to work with, the dough didn't tear but stretched easily.  A definite keeper and a definite 5* recipe!!

I have made this three times and the kids have loved it.   It has turned out great each time.  I dont use wheat fluor though and I dont prebake it.  I only let it rise until it reaches the top of the bowl, so it takes very little prep time (30 minutes).  I put my it in a bowl with a damp towel to rise and place it in the microwave.  The oven light on the bottom of the microwave heats its just right.  It rolles out very evenly without splitting.

Nice recipe. I added a few things. I got this from someone else's review,"approx 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1/4 tsp onion powder. (The best and easiest way to add herbs is to mix them into the olive oil before you add it to the batter - that will ensure even distribution throughout the entire dough.)"(Robin F)and I didn't use wheat.

I've made this twice in as many weeks. Both my kids and hubby love it. We'll never buy pre-packaged crusts or dough again. In fact, this tastes better than most restaurants. The crust is firm yet tender. It definitely handled all the toppings I piled on.

Great Recipe. I'am a notorious YEAST KILLER, but I was victorious over the finicky stuff with this recipe.
My daughter is a picky eater, but the one thing she will consistantly eat is pizza. I thought if I could make it with whole wheat and control what the pizza is made of, it has to be healthier than store-bought.
I made this recipe last night-the only thing I changed was 1/2 wheat, 1/2 bread flour and I added another T of sugar(I thought it was a bit salty tasting)

It was so easy to work with-soft and pliable.

I want to bake and freeze the shells, so that I can just top and bake off a few minutes to heat and melt the cheese. I pre-cooked the shells about 8 min at 425*. Today I made pizza with one shell and focacia bread with another shell(olive oil, parmesean and spices) It's sort of humorous that my daughters won't eat "the crust" but they wanted to eat all of my foccacia (ALL crust) when they taste-tested.

Great Recipe-THANKS!

This Pizza Dough is excellent, i was so suprised! I couldn't believe i made it... Hubby and kids loved it!!! No need to buy frozen pizza crust anymore. I didn't have wheat flour nor bread flour, and just used all purpose flour, and like suggested by other members, i seasoned the dough. Like i said, it was excellent even like this...5 Stars

As I sit here eating a chicken pesto pizza as I type this I would like to give high praise for the crust.  I have tried alot of recipes for pizza dough and this is my best find to date.  I did not have any wheat flour on hand so I used 6 cups bread flour and it is excellent.  I cannot wait to try it with wheat flour.  You should definitely try this one.  Its a keeper.

This is a synch!!  Listening to other reviews adding the extra 1/2c of wheat was excellent, so I thought... I will add a whole cup (b/c I love whole wheat).  Then I added a 1/2c of grits (uncooked) for some crunch.  I had to add a tiny bit more water, but not much at all (just watch your hydration levels).  Followed recipe as written below, other than those modifications.  Also, I ended up separtating this into 9-10 oz balls to freeze for later use.  I love ultra-thin and crispy crust, so the 9-10 oz amount rolled out great to fit onto the bottom of a broiler pan.  I would follow the tip of pre-baking a little bit before adding toppings.  Definately a keeper!

This was a wonderful recipe for pizza.  I had given up on finding a recipe that my family would enjoy.  But I have to tell you about a mistake we made that made the crust even tastier. When the 1st pizza came out of the oven, my husband slipped the 2nd one in and waited for the 1st to cool enough to cut.  After 5 mins. he cut into the 1st pizza only to find that it needed additional time in the oven.  So, he switched them out.  The 2nd pizza had had just enough oven time to start to rise again.  And it continued to rise while we waited for the 1st pizza to cook.  By this simple error, we found a lighter, tastier pizza crust on the 2nd.  Oh, I also used 1 cup of whole wheat and 5 of bread flour.  We will use this pizza dough recipe for years to come.

Very good - very easy.  I especially like the fact that it made enough dough for 3 pizzas.  I froze the second dough ball as-is.  I rolled the third one out, put it on my pizza stone, put sauce, cheese and fixings on it and then froze the whole thing.  Once frozen, I took it off the stone and wrapped in Saran Wrap.  It's now ready for a last-minute meal!

i scaled this recipe to 8 servings and used .5 c wheat flour, and 2.5 c bread flour
-This made 2 9x12 pizzas since we are thin crust lovers in this house!
-For once my hubby didn't complain of a "too doughy" crust and prep time was quick and easy- Thank You!

This was great! I usually can't get any yeast recipe to trun out any less than rock hard, but this was soft and easy to work with. I increased the whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased the white flour by 1/2 cup. I made a sauted veggie pizza with onion, mushroom and spinach, a cheese pizza for the kids and bread knots for dipping in sauce. The whole family loved it! I used my Pampered Chef stones and prebaked the dough about 8 minutes.

A great recipie!
I usually use about 2 1/2 cups of wheat flour, add a tablespoon of dried oregano or pizza spice when mixing the dough. I like to roll it out using cornmeal to dust the kitchen counter because it gives it a restaurant feel.

Super crust!  Very easy dough to work with and tastes great.  I made one pizza and two loaves of pepperoni bread from one recipe.  Excellent!

When I first saw the recipe I thought it would be kind of hard to make it (since I never made dough), but it was the easiest. The taste was great and my whole family loved it. Hadyn was home (and he is 11) and he helped me all the way.

I followed the directions exactly as written, and the dough was very easy to make. I learned a few things. First that this is A LOT of dough. I was able to make 3 mediums pizza with only half of this dough. Second, if you roll it out thin enough, you can put it on the grill with the toppings and it cook evenly. I'm not sure to what measurement I rolled it, but I felt a thin layer between my fingers and the counter. The taste was great.

Love it comes out superb.  Instead of white sugar I use a tablespoon of honey.  Instead of 5.5 cups sugar I use 2c bread flour and 3.5 cups white.  It makes 3-15/16oz dough balls.  You can also freeze the balls wrapped in saran wrap.  When you want to use them just thaw and use.  I make a quadruple batch and freeze all but two balls.

Great recipe! We follow it exactly as is. We have been using this recipe for a couple of months now for our weekly Sunday night pizza. I make the full recipe use half that day and freeze half for the next week. We actually like the frozen one the following week better, it freezes exceptionally well. Love it, thank you!

We found this very tasty! I had to bake it longer than the time on the recipe, but that's not to do with the recipe. . .The crust had a lovely flavor, and a great crunch! This is a keeper!

Great, easy recipe.  Makes 3 14" crusts.  I cooked one immediately, and froze the other two dough balls.  They froze very well, and thawed and cooked up just like the fresh dough.  The second time I made this recipe, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 regular flour, and it was still great.  Next time, I will try adding some spices to the dough!

Much better than any store bought premade, but compared to eating out, tasted very average. Ill try adding garlic and herbs next time or maybe even sugar.

Great!  I used 1 T of honey instead of sugar and used 2 cups whole wheat and 4 cups all purpose flour.  I used the advice of another reviewer and preheated pizza stone for 30 min at 500 and then put the dough on the stone with a little bit of corn meal.  I had all my toppings ready and just loaded it up.  I cooked it on the lower shelf at 500 for 10 minutes.

This pizza dough is amazing with one change - instead of 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, I used 1/2 cup wheat gluten, and it was the BEST pizza dough I've ever made! (and I've tried a lot of recipes!)  After rolling, I prebake mine with some olive oil before putting on the sauce and it comes out crispy and chewy and oh so delicious

Worked great for my recipe.  Baked at 500 and warmed pizza stone ahead of time like one reviewer suggested.  Used dough in calzones and worked perfectly. Will use again!

This was my first try at making home-made pizza dough and it was fabulous!!! My family loved it and couldn't get over how home-made it tasted :)  Didn't make any changes except some garlic powder in the dough for extra flavor.  For my family though since we love thin crust, this would easily make 5 or 6 pizza's!  Plus everything was on hand so it was super easy to make!! :)  Thanks!!

THIS WAS AWSOME! The dough was easy to work with and the directions were very easy to follow. The only thing I did differently was to use all bread flour b/c I ran out of whole wheat flour and I added about 1/4 cup ground flaxseed to the dough.. flaxseed doesn't change the taste at all so I try to add it to as many foods as I can. I added some garlic powder to the cornmeal and that gave the dough a nice flavor too. I cooked one pizza right away for a flatter crust and I let one rise on the pizza stone for about 15 mins and they both came out great. I did like others said and cooked the crusts for about 5 mins first and than took them out and used a spatula to loosen the crust from the stone than I added my toppings. I've tried a few pizza dough recipes on here and this is by far my favorite! THANKS!!!

At LAST!!! A pizza dough recipe that doesn't end up with "white bread" results! Beautiful dough! The ONLY draw back was this... if you don't LOVE making pizza FREQUENTLY, don't let your kids try this... you'll get nagged ENDLESSLY for "more of that PIZZA soon Mom!!"

This pizza dough is excellent! I just made it last night for my family and friends. The taste and texture of the dough is just great. I cooked the dough for 10 min and then added the toppings. It was perfect. The only thing I wish the submitter had included was instructions on how best to use the frozen dough...

This recipe is really good.  I've made it about 4 times now and it's always come out really well.  The only things I've had to change are the amount of flour - it is a little too much for me and won't incorporate - I cut out a half cup of the bread flour.  I also have added a little bit of seasoning as well -- a little bit of thyme and granulated garlic really kick it up!  We've used it to make breadsticks as well, they turned out wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have found. I made it as other reviewers suggested w/ 5 cups of bread flour & 1 cup of whole wheat flour & like others I added some herbs --I also added 1/2 cup of semolina flour --not sure that it made any difference. The dough is so Easy to work with & the recipe as scaled makes enough for three good sized pizzas. If, like me, you have struggled to get a good consistent result in making pizza crusts --use this recipe!
I also highly recommend to grill your pizza --I used this for my first ever grilled pizza & it was excellent. Five minutes on the grill using the "Exquisite Sauce" recipe on this site -so quick, so easy --so PERFECT! My wife said it was the best pizza she's ever had --"better than Joe B's!" which is high praise as Joe Bologna's is the best pizza place in our town & the best I've ever had anywhere--until now. Make this crust, make the exquisite sauce & ENJOY!

At my house we make a homemade pizza every week, and have tried a number of dough recipes with varying success.  This is our favourite recipe by far!  I can make three pizzas with this if we are expecting guests, or it freezes beautifully (coated in flour and wrapped in plastic).  I use traditional unbleached flour rather than bread flour, as it is what I normally stock at home.  I love how easy it is to make and work with.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It had great flavor.  I did add a little garlic powder and Itallian seasoning.  I prebaked the crust for about 8 minutes and then added my toppings and baked another 15 minutes.

I make pizza dough all the time.   I have tried recipe after recipe and this one is the best I have ever tried.  I am always looking for whole wheat recipes and I like that this one includes at least some. This got rave reviews at my party and my kids gobbled it up.

Great pizza dough.  Nice and chewy on the inside and crisp on the bottom and outside.  Used some olive oil, garlic, cornmeal to coat the edges of the pizza.  Baked at 400 degrees due to everyone making their own 6-7 inch pizzas and stacking the ingredents thick.  Cornmeal on the bottom of the pan.  Friends said best pizza ever.  Most said they will not order pizza again.  Told them have fun making the crust.

This is a great recipe! I use wheat germ and a little more bread fluor instead of wheat flour for a little texture. Then after letting the sugar and yeast sit in hot water for a while I throw it in the bread machine on dough cycle while I prepare the toppings.

I have tried this about a dozen times.  I have gone back and forth between three and four stars, with work this recipe is great. 

Each time (as I don't have a kitchen mixer) I have put the dough together by hand.  First thing is about 4 and 1/2 cups into adding the flour it gets real dry, the first time I added water which by the time I was done resulted in a sticky dough.  At the four and a half cups mark now I turn the dough out and kneed the remaining flour by hand.  This works great and the dough rises perfectly.  

No fault of the creator of the recipie:
Without bread flour the dough is okay (doesn't rise well but is edible).  AP flour only works if you add gluten to the mix.  While the yeast is proofing I put together the dry mix flour, salt, gluten (at 3/4 tablespoon per cup of flour), and spices.  Like I mentioned above at about four and a half cups of the mix I kneed the remaining in by hand until the dough is no longer sticky.

Lastly the dough has consistently been too doughy after baking (even after baking the crust first then rebaking with toppings).  This is perfectly resolved with a pizze stone that fixes the problem.

Excellent pizza dough! I just used all-purpose flour because that was all I had on hand, but the result was beyond all expectations. Thank you!

This was a good recipe and it was fun to use something different from my normal recipe, although I did add 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning.  This did turn out a little more "springy" than my regular recipe, and it took a little extra patience to roll it out on my pans.  I really like the amount of salt.  It was a nice chewy crust with a slightly salty flavor that was so good.  I made two small pie-pan sized pizzas for a "New Baby" meal for some friends, one regular-sized pizza for our family and then had enough dough for 4 breadsticks.  I also generously sprinkled cornmeal on my pans for a crispier bottom.

I'd never made my own pizza dough, but this was so easy and good! I followed other reader's advice and added a bit of Italian Seasonings with the flour and cooked the crust for about 10 minutes before adding toppings and cooking again. It was delicious! Thank you for sharing - it's awesome!!!

I thought this worked very well.  I did have to add more flour; I used 1 1/2 c of whole wheat flour and it tasted good.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 TBSP italian seasoning.  I cooked for 5 minutes prior to topping.  My family raved.

Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. This pizza dough was the best I've ever made. It was delicious and easy. I didn't adjust any ingredients, but I did adjust the temperature and timing after the first pizza.  The bottom dough on the first pizza wasn't quite as done as the toppings were.  The second pizza I baked at 400 degrees for approximately 25-30 minutes or until the toppings were golden.

I've been making homemade pizza for my family for 25 years. I decided to try a new crust.  They said this was the best crust we've ever had!  My daughter, who never eats the crust, ate all of hers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent! I added some garlic powder and oregano for a little extra flavor. The dough that I froze cooked up just as well as the fresh. Upon tasting a pizza I made using this dough recipe my neighbor said "your pizza rocks!".

Excellent!  This is the very best pizza dough I have ever made. My husband who is ultra picky loved it.  The crust came out of the oven crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It rises very well, which has always been my biggest trouble in making pizza dough.

This dough is wonderful!  I have made it twice and it has been delightfully easy to work with.  I have made pizzas and calzones. Both were yummy.  I used my baking stone and the crust bottom was crispy with the inside soft and chewy.  Great texture.  Thanks for the recipe Stephen!  My kids think that "Mom's Pizza" is better than delivery!

Great pizza dough recipe!  I use 5 c. all purpose and 1 c. wheat flour and it turns out great every time.  My husband loves it, too - we have it every Friday night.  Freezes well, too.

So tasty!  Very easy to do, even for a kitchen klutz such as myself.  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the whole wheat to 1 cup, decreasing the bread flour to 5 cups.  It came out perfect, made three wonderful crusts.  I made the first on a preheated Pampered chef stone (put it in a cold oven and then turned on the heat), it came out crusty on the inside, chewy and delicious on the outside. I rolled it out thicker, so it was more bread-like--yum!  The second one I did on a lightly oiled cookie sheet,rolled out thinner.  It was (of course) a thinner crust, and SO good. I just couldn't go wrong either way.  My four kids and husband devoured both!!  And the heavenly yeasty smell as it baked...ooh-lah-lah.  The kids were drooling.  :) I did pre-bake the crust 8 or so minutes each time, by the way.  It made the crust turn out just perfect!  I froze one crust to use later.  I am thrilled to find a wonderful recipe like this, I highly recommend it.  Thanks, Stephen!!

YUM YUM YUM. This crust is crispy, delicious, and strong enough to handle the weight of a lot of toppings. I used my bread machine to mix the dough, so preparation was a snap. Freezing the extra dough is a great idea for future meals. I love making my own pizza so I can creat a healthy version of greasy take out pizza. This crust really is perfect.  Will make again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

WOW!!! My family LOVED this dough! I made Stromboli for lunch and Pizza for dinner one day made a crisp tasty crust- the second day I made Scones with honey butter and the third day I made fried up scones and made a taco salad on top! What an easy versital recipe- I am out of wheat flour so I use all purpose in place of it and used honey in stead of sugar other than that everything stayed the same FANTASTIC!!! The best part of it is getting 4 great meals out of making dough once!!!!=)

This pizza dough is absolutely delicious.  Soft, chewy, light and fluffy.  I was able to make three large pizzas with the dough.  I think its a perfect dough mixture.

The best all-around pizza dough I've ever used. Not too crispy, not too chewy, substantial enough to hold the toppings, but not heavy. My kids love it. I froze 1/3 of the batch, which was a little sticky when thawed in the microwave. Next time I will let it sit at room temperature a little longer before rolling it.

Wonderful Pizza Dough!
I used all wheat flour and my husband and I loved it. I will try the bread flour next time, as I only had wheat or all pourpose to choose from. I will definetly use this recipe again, I bought a pizza stone today just for this recipe and It was incredible.

As a first-time pizza dough maker this recipe is easy to follow and a success with hubby and the kids.  Although not "really" quick in preparation the end results are well worth the time and effort. I really like having dough left over for future occasions. A great addition to weekend meal planning. Thanks for the submission!

My boyfriend and I have been making this pizza dough for over 2 years. We make the dough, use one serving for a homemade pizza that night then freeze the other 2 in individual plastic ziplocks (lined lightly with olive oil). When we want another homemade pizza, I transfer the frozen dough to the counter and it's just about room temp within a few hours. It's best to work with the dough when it's room temp.

A great pizza dough to work with, and one I will be using again.  It rolled out beautifully and was easy to cut in a heart shape.  I did pre-bake the crust for 6 minutes before adding the toppings for a taco pizza.

Best pizza dough recipe! I made two personal pizzas and one large calzone for dinner. I was still able to put enough dough for two more large pizzas in the freezer. I followed the ingredients exactly, with one exception. I used a Garlic Rosemary olive oil instead of plain EVOO. It added just the right amount of flavor. I was also unable to allow it to rise completely, due to time constraints. I would recommend this recipe to any one looking for a good pizza base. Thanks for posting!

I have made a mountain of pizzas with this dough recipe. I typically only use flour or bread flour and find that kneading the dough for a long time and then chilling it assists win a nice level and minimally risen pizza. Best pizza in town right here at the Wood house!

Turned out a great pizza base...made exactly as described...and baked it on a pizza stone in my charcoal grill. The crust was thick and a had a nice chew to it. You definitely have to cook this on a stone at high temps for it to work.

With a few changes this recipe works. I skipped the whole wheat flour, used a full 7 cups of all-purpose flour (I didn't have any bread flour on hand) and added about a half tablespoon garlic powder. When kneading the dough, I had to add quite a bit of flour as it was VERY sticky. Be generous with the oil during the rising process, which took about 2 hours to double. I used for calzones & it worked just fine.

This was perfect. I used  1 cup of wheat and 5 of ap flour instead of bread flour. I followed everything else as is. I mixed this in my Kitchenaide and then used the dough hook. So easy. Thank you.

I have tried many, many dough recipes over the years and have always been disappointed.  But my quest is over.  This is an easy dough to make and it freezes very well.  It makes the right amount for our family of five.  I've been just amazed at how well this dough rolls out, stays together when picked up (no holes!!!!) and  bakes up with a nice crisp bottom that doesn't "droop" when we pick it up.  The flavor's great and I like that we get some whole wheat in here for a bit better nutrition.  I'm in the U.S. South, and made sure to use bread flour for the dough  - our typical flour used to make cakes, etc would not have enough gluten for this recipe.  

I've also learned to preheat our stones - we have a stoneware like a Pampered Chef that I preheat to 425 degrees F and a NerdChef steel stone that I put in a second oven at 475-500 degrees F.  I also turn a 10" cast iron skillet over in the same oven as the steel stone.  Getting the stones hot and making the pizzas on a peel and sliding them on to the stones  & skillet yields a better crust for us.  I sprinkle the peel with some yellow corn meal to help the dough slide off easier.

No more searching!  This dough is great!  Now I just need to make a lot ahead and freeze it so we don't have to wait during the week.

Excellent!  Only change made was to pre-bake crust in preheated 500 degree oven until lightly browned.  Added toppings and put back in oven just until hot and cheese melted.  Everyone raved - thanks for sharing Stephen Carroll!

This is the second time I've used this recipe instead of my usual pizza dough recipe (which is very similar).  I use a pizza stone and pre-bake crusts. This recipe worked perfectly as written both times.

This dough has a very nice consistency.  I used a high quality unbleached all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but didn't notice a difference.  The whole wheat adds a delightful texture, crispness, and nuttyness.  I baked at 500 degrees F and used my cookie sheet dusted with flour for 10 mins.  I don't know how it freezes as I made all three balls into pizza.  I made one with pineapple and it was borderline wet in the center on top.  I recommend brushing the crust with olive oil and sprinkling with some dried herbs.  The whole family enjoyed this treat.

Changed this a bit and it made an excellent hardy, dense crust that was delicious! Instead of 2 1/2 cups water, I added 1 1/2 cups water and 1 cup oatmeal stout beer (it was not flat but could be and it'd still work) and dissolved the yeast and sugar in that mixture. I also added 1-2 TBL italian seasoning as I was adding flour. Everything else was as the recipe stated. I made the dough in the morning to use that night so I refrigerated my dough after it rose and I punched it down, I put it in a ziploc bag (gallon). It was really really good. I made 2 pizzas instead of 3 but they were good sized.

I have tried the recipe multiple times and each time it has came out good....1 time it didnt rise like it should have by I guess that was my fault because the first 2 times it came out perfect.  I make personal size pizzas for my kids because each one of them like different things and that way I can put what I want on mine as well. Either way we all like the dough.

We are iced in during a winter storm.  My husband is watching football games so I looked for a pizza dough recipe.  He said, "This is the best pizza I've ever eaten!"  On one pizza I tried rosemary, breakfast sausage, mushrooms, & mozzarella cheese....perfect with this delicious crust!

Very easy for it to come together and to work with. Love the little bit of whole wheat flour too! I used my kitchen aid stand mixer to put it together and had to add a little more flour but over all a great dough to make!

I Loved this recipe. My husband doesn't like anything whole wheat, but her barely noticed it in this pizza! So yes it may not taste like white crust typical of pizza, but it is the next best thing and I don't feel guilty making it! I put two of the crusts in the freezer and it was THE BEST THING to be able to take them out last minute for dinner. We are fans.

Best pizza dough i've ever made! Delicious! I just added some parmesan cheese, oregano, and parsley for extra flavour. It was perfect! I made with with a pizza stone and held together wonderfly. I also used all purpose flour since i didnt have any of the flours so it needed a lo more flour cause it was pretty sticky. Great recipe.

I increased the whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased the white flour to 5 c. I also pre-baked the crusts, then froze them until ready to cook. They were soooo yummy and crisp.

The dough came out great.  Texture-wise, it's a nice, light dough, and I had no trouble stretching it out.  Out of this recipe, we made 6 personal pizza's, and had enough for a large calzone.  Definitely a keeper.

Great! Doubled easy, added some spices/seasonings. Was a tad more "bready" than chewy/crusty - but it was fine by us. Pref "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" for a more traditional crust.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I used all purpose flour rather then bread flour and it worked perfect.  In order to have a crisper crust, I cooked the pizza at 450 degrees for 8 minutes on the lowest rack.  I then moved the pizza to the top rack for another 6 minutes.  To brown the crust I brushed it with melted butter and cooked for another 2 minutes.

I've worked with this recipe twice and have been delighted each time with the results.  The first time I divided the dough into three to make three pies, but I like my pizza fairly large and so the crust came out thinner than I prefer.  The taste and texture were wonderful - I made three cheese pizzas the first time.  The second time I planned for larger pizzas and divided the dough into two portions.  One pizza was three cheese with stuffed crust, brushed with garlic butter before baking.  The other was also stuffed crust with garlic butter brushed on the crust, filled with Italian dry salame, tomato chunks, mushrooms and sauteed garlic slices.  Both pies had a sprinkling of dry Italian spices over the cheese.  Superb pizzas, and a wonderful evening making it with my teenage daughter.  Can't wait 'til next time!

Exalent Dough though I would recomend baking the dough for 10mins before the toppings to ensure it is cooked properly.

The dough came out perfect and I did the instructions exactly as described.  I didn't have the wheat flour so I just used bread flour but it didn't matter.  I made two pizzas right away and froze the other one to later use for mini calzones.  If you have soggy crust perhaps you are putting too much sauce?  The crust came out with nice flavor without being too thin, thick, chewy, soggy, or overpowering.  Perfect for a homemade pizza night!

Great recipe!  I like the fact that I can decide on pizza without haviung to plan on making a polish the night before.  Try using seaaoned oilve oil in the crust.  Works like a champ.

This was a sticky mess at first. I changed the ratio of whole wheat(white) to bread flour(1.5C/4.5C) and was worried that I would have the opposite problem. I added somewhere between half to one full cup more of the WWW flour by the time I was done and finally got it kneaded. I froze two of the balls after the first rise and put the other in the fridge before rising. It was there for about 2 hours before I let it sit at room temp and finish rising. It was very easy to spread on the pan and filled my new 16" perforated, non-stick pan. I didn't use a rolling pin. Prebaked for about 4 min then topped and baked for about 12-13 min. The crust turned out better than any I've made so far but I can't really say that the new pan didn't contribute to that since I haven't used it before. Even the leftovers still had a soft, chewy outer crust.

Great pizza dough. I did as some of the reviewers and baked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes to give it some crisp before applying the toppings. It was awesome. Also, for the last three or four minutes in the oven with the toppings, I pulled out the cookie sheet it was on and let it crisp up a bit on the bottom. A pizza stone would be great too, but I improvised and it was awesome.

It came out great. The only thing I changed is I took out the salt and added some garlic powder for flavor. I also used Chef Johns tips for baking to get a crispy bottom crust. Baked on the bottom of the oven at 550 for 4 minutes, then moved to middle rack for 6 minutes, came out great and cooked in no time at all. I used my kitchen aid to knead the dough, so this was virtually no work at all! I love home made pizza!

This dough works great for calzones.  I used a little extra yeast (3 tsps instead of 2 1/4 tsps).  The dough was nice and stretchy so I was able to make nice thin shells.  The kids loved it.

Excellent pizza dough! Easy to follow instructions for a first time pizza maker. I have since changed the recipe and made it my own, but for those of you trying for the first time this is an easy basic recipe that's easy to modify once you get a little more confident!

Best pizza dough we have ever had! I changed the flour to 1 cup whole wheat, the rest white and let is rise longer. Left it for the afternoon while we ran errands. Will be the only one we use from now on. 
Topped with pizza sauce, mushrooms, chopped spinach, onion, chicken breast and soy cheese (dairy allergy) whole family loved it! Husband claims it is the best pizza he has ever eaten.

Followed this recipe exactly as shown. Like so many others, the dough was extremely sticky and I ended up using about 2 cups of flour more that in the recipe. I finaly threw it out.  I tried again only this time, I used 1/2 c less water and let the dough rest after mixing in each add'l cup of flour, then again before kneading, and after kneading.  I'll let you know what happens now.

This was the first pizza crust I've made. It was delicious. Crispy on the bottom, and chewy on the inside. Just great. I was worried it wasn't going to stretch out to fit the pan, but it did. I added a little butter and parmesan to the top of the pizza and cooked it for 10 min at 350. Then added the toppings. Absolutely delicious!

Very good. It is very recommended to let a liquid mix of all ingredients with 50-70% of flour together mature for 10 to 20 minutes before kneading. You will get a much better texture. Also, the final dough before letting rise should be a little sticky and not too hard. Coat with flour and it will feel like soft skin. Great recipe.

This is a pretty good pizza dough.  What makes a pizza dough successful is more in the preparation of the crust than the ingredients themselves.  For the people who thought this was like bread instead of crust, you made your crust too thick.  For best results, learn how to toss a pizza.  This forms the best consistency for the crust.  Also for good results, brush the "base" of the crust (all the part you would put sauce on to) with a VERY light brushing of olive oil, and prebake it for no more than 5 min.  The take it out, add your toppings, and finish it off.  As stated by others, a properly preheated pizza stone is a MUST for a perfect home made pizza.

This is great dough!  Definitely use a pizza stone and cook near the bottom of the oven to make sure the crust cooks before the toppings burn (I've never tried pre-baking, like some reviews suggest).  I usually increase the ratio of whole wheat flour to bread flour, though - closer to 25% whole wheat.    To make pizza dough (in general) more like crust and less like bread, knead for a few minutes once everything is combined and then let it rest for 10 min before continuing to knead (then knead until very stretchy).  Letting it rise over night in the refrigerator works very well and adds chewiness (just punch down when it gets big).

Didn't change a thing, this was a perfect and very forgiving pizza dough recipe.  I used the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" from this recipe.  One thing I did was lightly and randomly brush the cooked side of the crust with melted garlic butter before putting the toppings on and that added a nice pizzaria flavor to the pizza.  I cooked the dough on the grill then flipped it onto a stone and brought them inside to assemble the toppings.  Then brought them back to the grill and finished them off on a piece of foil to keep them from burning while the cheese melted and other ingredients got hot (Bobby Flay trick).  This was a perfect dough recipe, not bready or cakey, just perfect!  Also, corn meal dusted on the surface that you roll the dough on, allows you to lift the dough off and onto the grill much easier, and without leaving dough behind, and provides that little pizzaria crunch to it as well.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

This dough turns out just fine if you follow the recipes exactly and don't over sauce it.  The majority of times, people put too much sauce on pizza, OR too thin of a sauce, pizza sauce is almost, though not quite, as a thick as a paste, and you only need a very thin layer.  I also cooked this at 400 degrees farenhieight , but I am sure it would also cook just fine on the suggested temperature, you just have to remember that your stove may be hotter or cooler than it says and your best bet is to put a thermostat in to see the real temperature, I did not have one, so I lowered it to be safe.  :)

What a great pizza crust!!!!  I swapped 1 cup of the water for 1 cup of porter (home brew) and 1/2 cup of the bread flour for whole wheat flour.  Very chewy but holds up great to tons of toppings and sooo tasty!

With a few adjustment, this dough is awesome. The only addition I made was a garlic butter mixture brushed on before baking.  My sons love it!!

I used 5 1/2 cups of all purpose flour and the dough was so lovely.  It rose nicely & had great texture.  I cut the dough into 2 pieces instead of 3 as the recipe says, and one of my pie crusts were too thick & bready.  The second pie I made bigger & stretched out more & the crust came a lot better.  I also baked the crust for 10 mintues per other reviewers suggestions and it helped to cook the crust.  Next time I will cut the dough into 3 parts and really try to get a good crispy crust.

Really good :)  made in my bread machine on dough cycle, rolled out and made calzone's instead of pizza.  brushed tops with oil in oven to brown, will be making this again.  I made extra and froze them to eat at a later time.

We have been searching for a homemade pizza dough for months and this one turned out great! Didn't stick to the pan and had a really good taste! I used 3 cups of bread flour and 3 cups of whole wheat to increase the health factor and it turned out great!

I love this pizza dough! It is our go to pizza night recipe. Every time I make it for guests they rave about it and want the recipe. The trick is definetly the bread flour. I highly recommend it. We vary, sometimes we divide it into 4 to make thinner crusts and other times we stick to three crusts. I do use all the tools too, pizza stone etc,.

Very good. I mixed in my Kitchenaid, then finished kneading on the counter. I had to add a bit more flour. Used 2/3 for calzones and the other third I baked flat on a pizza pan to add toppings later. For the calzones, the ones that were only lightly brown were better, so don't overbake in small quantities.

Amazing recipe.  I prebaked for ~10 min before adding toppings.  The crust was not soggy at all and my boyfriend loved the pizzas (one was pear gorgonzola and the other pesto).

Very tasty! I did the prebake method (bake it 10 minutes, take it out, let it rest, put on the toppings, cook again). Dough was easy to work with as stated by an earlier reviewer.

This is an excellent crust and similar to a Regina style crust (for those of you who know what Houston or Western Pizza is in Western Canada.  I add spices into the dough to enhance the flavour sometimes.  I divide the dough into 3 pieces and make 3 crusts. I have even saved one of the dough pieces and wrapped it in plastic for later use.  I want to try the dough for calzones but haven't gotten to that yet.  I use a 9 x 13 stoneware from Pampered Chef to cook my pizzas on.  20 minutes or so to bake and I've never had an issue with soggy crust or toppings.

absolutely delicious! Super easy! I added grilled chicken, red, yellow and orange peppers, black beans and cheese! Sooo good!

Edit: Put on the bbq for a crispy crust.. let half cook, flip, add toppings and close for a few mins.. the best pizza ever!!

I am vegan so this pizza was made without any cheese. This was a great recipe for a nice dough.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and unbleached white for the crust. I baked the crust on a preheated pizza stone, topped with virgin olive oil, a blend of crushed garlic, salt, a bit of red pepper, all from a mill. I also sprinkled oregano over the top. Baked until golden brown. When crust was done I then topped the pizza with fresh organic Arugula sprinkled with a generous amount of virgin olive oil, crushed garlic,salt from mill, and crushed cracked pepper blend.

As is, the dough is good in that it definitely turned into a pizza crust. When I first mixed the ingredients together, it was a wet mess. My bro (who wanted to knead) got his hands full of gooey mess that took forever to get out. Anyway, we had to add a bunch of bread flour before it became a workable dough. To prevent soggy crust like some reviewers noted, I pre-baked the dough in the oven for 10 minutes. After adding toppings, I baked again for 15 minutes...no sogginess at all. Like many others have said, this tasted quite plain. I would suggest adding a little more salt and some spices (Italian seasoning?) I would make this again but with some modifications for sure.

I made this the other night with three teens and our youth pastor here for dinner.  It came out really great... everyone loved the pizza and no one seemed to notice that it was 'wheat'!  I made two cookie sheet pizzas and had enough left over to freeze for a smaller pizza.  I'm hoping that will turn out well, too.  With the help of the dough hook on my mixer, this took little time to prepare and is certainly far more economical than the canned or premade type crusts.  It's a lot tastier than the pouch kind too, so I can see us having a stock of these rolled out in the freezer to pull out for a tasty fresh made pizza.  Yummy--thanks for sharing!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Was easy to make, and crust was fantastic.  If you like a thinner crust, I would recommend splitting the dough into at least 4 balls before the final "rest".  I found the full 1/3rd of the recipe created a very thick crust.

I used slightly more whole wheat flour and less bread flour and prebaked the dough for about 5-6 minutes before topping. We also brushed the crust with garlic butter. This was fantastic!!! We've tried 6 other dough recipes (all somewhat similar) before and this is my new favorite dough. It puffed up quite a bit while I prebaked it, but then was fine once the toppings were added and it was baked again. yummy!

Five stars plus, absolutely awesome!  Made this for our usual Friday night pizza and loved every single bite!  Ended up using 1 1/2 cups ww flour and 4 1/2 cups nutri blend (belnd of white and wheat bran) and got 2 very large doughs (our pizza stone is huge, otherwise we could have ended up with 3 doughs).  Added roasted boneless skinless chicken, hot cappocolo, fresh mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, granulated garlic, pepper and basil and naturally mozzarella cheese...yummy!  We thought it was one of the best pizzas we've ever had!  I also did a mixture of BBQ sauce and pizza sauce which adds a great flavour, especially when you use chicken!  Glad we have one in the freezer!  Thanks for the post, will definitely make again.

I used this dough for my daughter's sleepover and it made about 16 5-6" personal size pizzas.  Very tasty and easy to work with!  Some of the girls made stuffed crust and they turned out nice! Will use again!

Great recipe! I stretched it out pretty thin because I read so many reviews about uncooked dough and burnt toppings. Only had to bake it for 12-15 minutes. I didn't have a pizza stone or pan, so I just used a baking sheet, and I'm glad I did because if I were confined to a round pan, I would not have been able to stretch it out as thinly as I did. Bread flour is a MUST if you want to stretch it thin without making holes. I also sprinkled some cornmeal on the pan before laying down the dough. This recipe ACTUALLY serves about 6 people.

This recipe makes a fantastic pizza crust. It is light with a crunchy outside and soft inside. I don't understand the negative review of this recipe; it tasted wonderful (not like soggy wheat bread at all), was super easy, and everyone who tried it loved it.

It was a good recipe except for the dough is quite sticky I wound up adding about  a 1/2 of bread flour more to make up for the stickiness. The dough is also very soft, not the type to fling in the air. I used my pampered chef pizza dough shaper and that worked. Over all the Pizza came out quite lovely.

This dough is awesome - makes great crust for bruschetta and dinner rolls taste great!  I like to make the rolls on a pizza stone at 400 degrees and mist the oven with water for a nice crunchy crust.

This is the best pizza dough ever, it tastes great!  I used feta cheese and pesto on top, which was really good, not too fatty and oily...great!

I had to use a bit more flour than it calls for, but maybe I just don't know how to knead bread.  I used the dough hook on my mixer but I'm not sure how long I'm supposed to mix between each half cup of flour.  My dough was pretty shaggy looking so I kept adding flour until it seemed to come together.  My second batch I ended up adding more whole wheat flour and everyone said that it was actually a bit better than my first batch.  That also could have been because the dough rested longer before we topped and baked it.  Anyways, this was a pretty foolproof recipe for someone without much experience with breadmaking. I also don't know how to knead bread by hand once it's already risen once (after you punch it down). 
Our favorite toppings were minced garlic, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and sliced fresh tomatoes with homemade sauce.  YUM.

This recipe turned out great! I did not pre-bake it and cooked it with the toppings about 17-18 minutes. The pizza was really, really good! I will definitely make this again and it will more than likely replace delivery pizza for us. I also love that it makes enough for three pizzas so that I can freeze the other two for later.

This is the first time making pizza crust and it was easy and turned out a great crust.  I used all wheat flour instead and it turned out great.  I will definately be using this one again and again. The kids are a great time making their own pizzas.

first time making pizza dough, and I seem to have perfected the square pizza!  Will try again next time to make them round.  I added garlic powder and italian seasoning to the dough and used my mixer with the hook to mix it and knead it.  We all thought it was great.

Tried this twice, both times it was easy and turned out perfectly!  I even used all unbleached whole wheat flour instead of what's indicated and it is still tasty and perfect.  Better than pizza from the chains - and much cheaper.

This recipe was great!I mixed everything by hand, I didn't have bread flour -- but I really don't think it made a difference.I did pre-cook the crusts for 10 minutes as suggested by other reviewers. I also do not own a pizza stone so I used airbake cookie sheets and the crust turned out crispy and well cooked. Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe because of the reviews. I ended up having to use about 1 1/2 cups more flour. I thought the water amount was too much so that might be the reason. Overall it was ok. Family ate a few pieces and did not request anymore. I will stick to my other recipe for pizza dough.

Excellent dough recipe!  It was very good as a pizza crust & then I refrigerated the rest of the dough & made a french bread out of it the next night.  Very versatile & good texture - I will definately use this one again!

I just made this pizza dough a few hours ago.  I made 2 pizzas out of it but they were huge jelly roll pans and we made it like pan pizza thickness.  The texture was good but the flavor was non existant.  I should have listened to several other reviewers and put spices in the crust.  I really had no flavor.  But it was an easy recipe to follow and the dough was easy to work with.  I made it in my heavy duty kitchen aid mixer.  I just used my dough hook and so I had no need to remove the dough from the bowl to knead it.  It was easy and once I put it in a greased bowl - it rose nicely.  I might try it again but with spices.  Our pizza that we made was not really flavor busy.  One was pepperoni and the other was just cheese and mushroom.  We even used 3 kinds of cheese but that did not even help the flavor of the pizza. Boring.  I was disappointed.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and increased the whole wheat flour to 1 cup.  I also added some Basil and Garlic powder to one crust and some honey to another.  Both were terrific!  I only split this recipe into 2 instead of 3 because my pizza pans are 18 inches, but they made very thick crusts.  Everyone loved this pizza dough including my husband who actually noticed that I did something different this time.  (Very unusual)

OG 2005/05/03 review: This dough is perfect, and comes out perfect everytime I make it.  Tastes wonderful and cooks up (on a stone at least) really well.
Wanted to add, it has a great texture and isn't sticky, has a lovely tooth for pizza. It's really a great, balanced recipe.

This is great - I've put all kinds of topping combinations on it, and it always turns out a great level of chewiness in the middle and a crispiness on the edges(which Bennett really likes.)  One thing I would say though is DEFINITELY add a handful of dried basil to the dough while you're kneading it.  It really adds a lot of good flavor.

This was the very first pizza crust recipe I used, and although I didn't follow it exactly (I used only all-purpose flour and vegetable oil), it turned out wonderfully for me.  The trick is to prebake the crust just a couple of minutes, long enough for it to get solid but not crusty, before adding toppings to it.  That way you know your crust is done and it takes less time for your pizza to finish baking.

Excellent pizza dough.  I followed another reviewers suggestions to bake for a few minutes (I did 6 minutes) with just the sauce and then remove and add remaining ingredients.  It worked like a charm and my New Year's Eve gourmet pizza party was a huge success.

I tried several recipes before finding this one. This recipe is wonderful and no-fail.  I use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and adjust the amount of bread flour.  The dough smells wonderful, is easily worked, looks great too! My family loves the resulting pizza crust.  I didn't have bread flour the first time I made this recipe and I used all purpose flour. It turned out just as well. This recipe is a KEEPER!

I even messed this one up, by forgetting to add the sugar to the yeast and adding to the flour mixture.  I realize that the yeast needs the sugar, I must have be missing my brain that day!  However, besides having the dough taste a tiny bit sweet, it turned out really well, and it still doubled its volume.  Great recipe!  Easy!

Great recipe!  Wasn't able to use wheat flour, but all white flour works just as well.

I'm a decent cook and not a very good baker, but this recipie is a keeper.  I've used up to 3 cups whole wheat flour and it's awesome.  Freezes great and easy to make.  I love to top it with pizza sauce, eggplant marinated in balsamic vinegar and provolove & bake in a 9x13 glass dish.  YUM!

After realizing how much we spent a month at Pizza Hut (delivery), I decided to try making my own pizzas.  This recipe was awesome, though I did alter it a little.  I like a little more flavor so I added 2T of parsely flakes and 2t of garlic powder.  I have to shoo the family away before I even bake it.  Friday night is pizza night here, and the third crust is usually made over the weekend as a calzone or just another football snack.

I made this dough for a get together with some friends.  A sort of "bring your own topping" type of potluck.  A TOTAL HIT!!!  We've decided to make it a weekly party.  The favorite topping combo of the group was the Margerita flavoring with the pesto, garlic, basil, tomatoes, and gorgonzola...  I'm a first timer with the yeast dough and they thought I was an old pro.  FANTASTIC RECIPE!! FOOL PROOF!!!

Would have given this 5 stars if I were'not so exhausted from literally wrestling this dough into submission. My fault, should have read the little tutorial here about HOW to actually do it. No matter how much flour, dough sticks here, dough sticks there...Came out great eventually!

Great recipe.  Voted the best I ever made by the family. Made marguerita pizza with homegrown tomatos and basil and a couple of other varieties for the kids.   Used the Pampered Chef stones, which are the best, for a perfect outcome. Thanks

Great recipe! I used pans for two of the three and they turned out fine. I just put the third one on the oven rack and it was awesome. I'd like to try it on the BBQ next.

My hubby and I absolutely loved this pizza dough.  I followed others' advice and increased the amound of whole wheat flour (1 cup) and pre-baked the crust.  I split the dough in two, froze one and used the other - so I ended up with a nice thick crust, which had to bake a little longer.  Used my Pampered Chef stone and couldn't be happier with how it turned out crisp on the bottom and chewy inside.  Can't wait to pull the other one out of the freezer!

This a truly wonderful dough recipe! I increased wheat flour to one cup and my family absolutly loved it! I used the Gourmet Chicken recipe from this site and it was wonderful. For the remaining dough I made stuffed calzones. Yum, will make this again and again! Thanks

don't know what I did wrong, but this pizza was inedible ! I used my bread machine and followed all the steps. I also used the pampered chef pizza stone and increased the time as others said. It turned out very dry and hard. Too bad I spent alot of time on this for my hubby, I was disappointed.

I've gotten so many compliments since using this recipe!  I've made it at least a dozen times.  Last time I tried 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular unbleached bread flour.  If you do this you need to prebake for about 5 minutes.  I use a Pampered Chef pizza stone.  Don't buy a cheap one from Target.  They're not the same.  I tried one and trashed it.

My husband and I really liked this crust. It has a nice chewy texture and tastes great. I made this dough in the bread machine...which I at first thought was a big mistake because my pan was so full...but my bread maker prevailed once again.  The only thing I had to do was add an extra 1/4 cup water while my machine was mixing, and the dough came out perfect.  This isn't the New York style crust I'm always looking for, but very tasty none the less. We liked it better than some other pizza dough recipes on this site. Thanks for a great recipe I will probably use again.

I wanted to make the Stromboli, but my grocery store didn't have pizza dough, so I made this recipe.  It was magnificent and I am not a "dough from scratch" kind of person.  Really easy and turned out great.

I cut the dough in half and made two large pizzas.  My family loved it. I loved that the crust tasted good and was easy to make.  However, by making two large pizza's I couldn't get the bottom crusty enough in the centre.

My 3 year old son loved making the dough with me.  Really glad some of it could be frozen because waiting an hour for it to rise was very hard for him.  Tasted great -- we also used it to make prezels with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.

This recipe made two cookie sheets of pizza. I made sure they were well greased with olive oil. The crust was crispy and delicious. I cooked mine at 400 for 20 minutes and then 450 for 10minutes. My family said it’s the best pizza they’ve had in years.

I made this pizza dough completely last minute for an impromptu dinner party of about four families with kids.  I made all three pizzas and nothing was left, it was a huge hit!  I didn’t want to wait for my dough to rise for an hour so I cheated by putting it in an oiled Dutch oven and covered with a well dampened kitchen towel and then stuck it in my oven on warm for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  Worked perfectly as a short cut!  One thing; my husband’s family is in the pizza business and so I followed their lead and poked the uncooked crust with a fork all over several times and then brushed really lightly with olive oil.  It cooked nice and evenly with no over crisp or raw spots to speak of.  Definitely using this recipe again!

This is delicious! I use it for my pizzas and strombolis. However, I don't use the whole wheat flour, just white because that's what I always have. I love it for a thicker crust. I also brush melted butter with Italian herbs and garlic over the crust, then add crushed red peppers. It's soooo good!

I loved it and it’s so easy! Don’t over-mix or over cook. Looking forward to trying healthier options by using whole wheat flour or gluten free. I wanted to try the recipe as is before trying to tweak it.

I made this dough last week and my family loved it. It has great texture and flavor. I was able to make two 1/2 sheet sized pizzas and two pepperoni rolls. I will definitely make this again!

This is my go to pizza dough. I make 3 15 inch pizzas. When it is ready to bake I divide crust in three and pinch out as best I can to 16 inches.  I put pizza stone in oven at 425 degrees. When good and hot I put pizza crust on stone and bake about 12 minutes. I do this for all three. Then I freeze them in extra large freezer bags.  Pull out of freezer any night and you can have any kind of pizza you want in 10 minutes. Just put on topping and bake at 425 degrees for 19 minutes. Yummy!!

Amazing, never made any type of dough before and this turned out really yummy. I did as suggested cook the dough for 10 minutes before topping it and putting it in for another 10. 
It was a little difficult to move the rounds after letting them rest for ten minutes onto my preheated pizza stone, but well worth it. 
Probably going to add some garlic or something into the dough for next time for some added flavor.

Wonderful pizza crust recipe! I added fresh basil and oregano to the dough as well as some garlic powder. I’ve made it plain before (and it’s delicious), so I decided to try it with herbs since I have some fresh ones growing. Oh, it was SO good! I rolled out the dough really thin and added a little mozzarella cheese on top, then I baked it for ten minutes to firm up the dough. I don’t like floppy pizza. I brought it back out and added our toppings of choice and baked it for an additional 20 minutes. Amazing. Delicious. Even my picky daughter ate two slices!

It says to roll thin for a reason! I didn’t and had to cut it in half thickness wise. But I turned the top half into garlic bread and that was really good. Crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.

I made this recipe for my kids sleepover party.  All the kids got to make their own mini pizzas and they loved it.   I cut the recipe into three as described and then cut each of the 3 sections into thirds. Rolled them thin and everyone topped as they liked.  Crust was great.  I did make some adjustments to deal with what I had on hand.  Instead of whole wheat flour I used gluten free flour, did 2 tsp regular salt and 2 tsp garlic salt and  used 2 tsp of italian seasoning.

I’ve made this twice once with bread flour and the second with AP because I ran out. The first time the bread was a bit chewier and denser. I prefer the bread flour but both ways was amazing. I also added a bit of fresh garlic and garlic powder to the dough the second time. It turned out amazing. Not the best at shaping dough yet but I’ll improve with practice. I used a cast iron pizza pan and the bottom was phenomenal.  Will use this recipe in the future!

Whole family (including 2 fairly picky kids) agreed. Best homemade pizza dough I’ve made. Didn’t have whole wheat flour so subbed in some all purpose then used bread flour for the rest like in directions.  Turned out great!

This recipe is spot on!  Be sure to not overwork your dough (per the norm with any dough), or it can turn out a bit tougher than desired.  Preheat your pizza stone for about 10-15 mins at 350 and use a pizza peal with either flour or yellow corn meal to get it to slide off easily.  Pre-bake crust on stone for approx 10mins at 350 and then while you are adding your favorite toppings, allow the oven to heat up to 425 for your final cook of the pizza for about 10-15 minutes.  And there you have it!  Amazing, fresh, all your own, tasty pizza!  ENJOY!

I've been using this recipe for 11 years now and I absolutely love it- though I'll confess I never use whole wheat flour in it and just use all -purpose. It freezes well. When cooking with a pizza stone we always have great results- crispy on the bottom and the perfect amount of chewy in the crust.

I used this recipe for a school project, and everyone loved it! Instead of adding four cups and then the rest, I added the flour by slowly folding it in (1/2 cup at a time) until it reached the consistency I preferred. 

Then instead of adding the toppings and immediately cooking it, I shaped the dough on a pizza stone and cooked until the crust started to brown. I then added the sauce and cheese (and other toppings), then put it back in the oven until the cheese had melted. This prevents the dough from getting soggy, as it cooks the bottom of the pizza before adding the liquid of the sauces. 

Also optional: add olive oil to the crust after adding the cheese and toppings to give the crust a more golden brown color.

I loved this dough. This was the first time I made any pizza dough and the dough was thick and chewy the way I like it. I did not use any wheat flour. I used all bread flour and I only divided it in half by weight. The other half is in the freezer for another time. I used one packet of active dried yeast. My packet said .75 ounce not .25 as in the recipe. It certainly didn't hurt anything. I let it rise for about 30 mins and ended up leaving it it a greased covered bowl for a day and a half. Life got in the way LOL.

Very easy and produces a nice, bread-y crust. I use this to make stromboli. Usually I'll cut the recipe in 1/3 or 1/2, but I could see as it's written how this would easily make 3 crusts.

After reading other reviews, I decided to add an egg to my dough, because I didn't have bread flour. It turned out wonderfully using a pizza stone and baking at 500 degrees. Overall,  a good recipe.

I make this dough all the time. Very easy to make and tastes great. It makes three pizzas so I usually use two and through one in the freezer.

I loved this recipe, and will definitely make it again. I didn't make any changes in the recipe, but I made calzones  with the dough instead of pizza.

I divided into four pieces use two for calzones and the other for pizza. I like how the dough came out,  I had no problem mixing the dough just added a little more flour as needed, the pizza and calzones were a family hit.

This is my new go-to pizza dough recipe! Made 2 med-large round pizzas and saving one ball of dough in freezer for later :) Mmmm. I do 10 min. without toppings, top it, and 7-10 min. at with toppings.

Excellent recipe. Have made this many, many times. I change up the flour sometimes to try different brands and variations. Will swap corn oil for olive oil occasionally. Pre-heat pizza stone on the grill to around 600 degrees. Thin crusts will cook in about 4-5 minutes. Just like a regular pizza joint!!

Added garlic powder and italian seasonings to the dough for a bit more flavor. Turned out great! I loved how much dough this recipe made - I could freeze half of it for later use.

Excellent pizza dough.  I put it in my bread machine on dough cycle so it was easy.  I cut the recipe in half because it's just two of us.  Very good dough.  Just like you get from a pizza shop.  Will make this again.

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough and it turned out great! I had read so many different recipes before deciding on this one,  I didn't even notice it called for bread flour so...I used wheat with all purpose.  It was really good! I won't be buying pizza dough again and don't feel the need to buy bread flour.

I divided it in 4 and made a slightly thinner crust, that way the cooking time works out and you get a wonderful crust instead of a doughy one. Also I just used plain old all purpose flour and it turned out great.

Just made this recipe,  it's the best one so far. It's test awesome and baked   easy. I did bake the pizza first without the topping at 350 for 10 minutes. Than baked at 425 for 20 minutes with the topping. The only change I will make is to reduce the whole wheat flour to 1/4 cup.

This was the best pizza dough I have made at home.  It is also the only one that I have found that freezes well.  I used one crust immediately and froze two.  They were all yummy.  I did make this in my bread machine.  Also, I always prebake my crusts when making homemade pizza....pop them in the oven at 400 for about ten minutes and then add my toppings and finish baking.  Thanks for a super recipe!!

I made this recipe without changing the ingredients (I used my bread machine to mix the dough) and it turned out amazing! The crust was nice and thick and the perfect texture. I made a bbq chicken pizza and the crust was great, when I make a different type of pizza I'm going to try and add a few spices to the dough that others recommended. It even taste great as leftovers!

I like this recipe. Very simple, just like one I have made several times. I only do one thing that's not in the directions. I put my crusts in the pan and cover them for about 10 minutes to allow them to rise a little in the pans. I just think it makes a nicer fit with the dough.

I use this recipe all the time. Add oregano and garlic to dough. Freezes very well - just lightly oil and wrap a couple times in Saran. Remove from freezer about 3-4 hours before needed. Cook at 500F using a pizza stone. Enjoy!!

I'll preface with the fact that I have made homemade dough maybe twice in my life, never pizza dough. I followed the recipe for the dough. But after I separated it into 3 bowls, I left it on the counter for about two hours - covered with seran wrap. It more than doubled in size (again). I thought I'd have enough dough to make 6 pizzas and planned to freeze half. But it deflated again when I touched it. So we made 3. I did things differently than the recipe suggests at this point. I didn't use a rolling pin, but pulled it apart with my hands. Then I laid the dough on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet that was sprinkled with corn meal. I pre-baked the crusts for 7 minutes at 400* (I should have prebaked for 10 as one crust was doughy in the center). Once out of the oven, and cooled a bit, I brushed the crust with olive oil then sprinkled on parm. cheese, garlic salt and italian seasoning. Next time I'll be relatively liberal with the garlic salt. My kids all decorated half a pizza with their favorite sauces & toppings. Then we baked them for an addition 12-15 minutes at 450*. They were a hit! One crust recipe made probably what dominos would call 3 medium pizzas. The crusts were not thin, but much like dominos hand-tossed or digiorno rising crust. They fed 2 adults and 3 preschool aged children with 1/2 of a pizza left over. I attached a photo.

This dough came out perfect i only made two instead of three, so they were thicker crusts. However, it wasn't too crispy or too soggy, just right.

Consistent recipe.  Agree w/other comments regarding baking temperature- 500 degrees for approx 15 minutes seemed to do the trick.

I used this dough as a base for calzones and it worked out nicely.  I used 1/2 of dough for each calzone...they were sizeable, but I had no problem eating the whole thing!  No problem with sogginess.

Crispy, chewy, delicious! I baked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes before I left it cool. Add seasonings to the dough (I used an Italian blend) before baking for some added flavor. Very good stuff!

best ever in bread machine on dough setting.....make sure you let your dough rise makes all the flavour difference.  I also used a pizza stone warmed up in my 400 degree oven and made my pizza on a parchment paper and slid it onto the stone.  it worked great and cooked the bottom of the crust perfectly without disturbing my toppings!

I love this dough!  I have tried it multiple times, had to sticky of dough and too dry of dough, it took me a bit to get used to how that works, since I don't have much dough experience. Even when I had frustrations, this dough always came out great! Very tasty and as close to a professional pizza dough as I have found! Ohh I did omit the wheat flour and substitute more bread flour, just personal preference, didn't like the wheat flavor.

This recipe was very simple to make and turned out great.  I did not have bread flour, so I used all-purpose flour instead and it still made a very nice dough.

I used the tips that other reviewers shared about heating my pizza stone prior to baking the pizza.  I then put the dough on the stone, baked for about 7 minutes, added sauce and cheese and returned to over for 8 more minutes.  The dough was done just right and the cheese was melted perfectly.  This is my new go-to recipe for pizza crust!

Ran out of bread flour so I used about 2 cups of all purpose flour. Added a dash of garlic powder to the dough. It rose beautifully, rolled out phenomenally, and tasted heavenly!

Great Dough, cooked well, no bubbles, not soggy at all. Better than the dough I used to work with at Pizza P., so easy. Cooks well on cornmeal and cooks thoroughly, made one large pizza, 1/3 of the dough made a thick crust 16", and 1 small pizza 1/6 of the dough reg. thickness 14". The best part is when cooked it holds chunky items, i.e. large cut tomatoes, without folding in the middle.

Great and easy crust! I followed the directions exactly and topped with spicy brown mustard, sweet red onion, sweet potato, salt, pepper, oil, and cheese. I probably could have rolled the dough even thinner.

This recipe is fantastic. I used traditional yeast and organic flour. Great consistency and elasticity.  Rolls out well. This was my first go at making home-made pizza crust.  It was 'great success!'

I make pizza frequently since I discovered this recipe.  I usually will make 4 or 5 small/medium pizza crusts and par-bake them at 400 degrees for about 7 minutes.  Then I freeze what I don't need in the 2.5 gallon jumbo freezer bags (they fit perfectly) and-voila-I have a pizza crust available whenever I want to make pizza.  These are good size pizzas for those who want different toppings or are light eaters.  I can make my kids and husband pizza with only their prefered toppings that way.  Beside the regular toppings like sausage, I like to add bacon bits, crushed pineapple, and feta cheese. These really doctor it up nicely. The crusts are super easy, but don't forget to add a little something extra to it, like garlic powder and basil if you like.

I use this recipe all the time usually making a dozen at a time and freezing the pizza. Set the oven for 500 degrees I roll the dough using oil.  I put some cheese on the dough and bake for 5-7 minutes. I usually bake all the shell then I put sauce and cheese  Then wrap them in cellophane.  When I want a pizza I pull them out of the freezer and they are nie and fresh

I made with regular flour.  Did not double in size.   I sprayed my hands with PAM.  Made handling sticky dough non-sticky.  Cooks well.

I have tried sooooo many pizza dough recipes, but have never added whole wheat flour - that's the trick I guess. This crust is amazing, chewy and crispy - make sure the pan is at 500 degrees before you put the dough on it for a well cooked bottom.

This recipe is very similar to my Italian grandmothers recipe.  I add a little more sugar but this turned out excellently  I was very good. I now use it always now.

I thought this recipe was great. I've never made pizza dough before and this was so simple. I did change the ratio of flour and used 3c whole wheat and 3c white. It rolled out nicely, and 1/3 of the recipe is the perfect size to cover a baking sheet with a thin layer for a crispy crust. This is a keeper!

Great recipe, I have  tried several different ones. I thought  I had found my keeper and then I came across this one. I love the whole wheat flour. Nice crust, easy to work with.  We have pizza every Friday night and this makes 3 nice large pizzas. Thanks Stephen

I followed this recipe exactly the first time and it turned out great.  On the second try I did some alterations: I subbed 1 1/2 Tbsp of honey for the sugar and used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of just 1/2 cup and decreased the bread flour to 4 cups total.  Although my dough didn't take all of the bread flour before it was perfect. After the rise I cut it into 4 portions for a thinner crust and rolled it out to about 14-15"'s.  This  is a great recipe. I'll keep it in my box for sure.  Thanks!

Great, easy dough recipe. I only had 5 1/4 cups bread flour left, so I used 3/4 cup wheat flour and it worked great. 

I prefer to add seasoning to my dough, so that's why I do 4 stars instead of five. :)

I have made this dough on a weekly basis since I first tried the recipe. My boyfriend cannot stop craving it and any guest that has sampled the result has demanded the recipe. The only alterations I have made were after the dough was rolled out I spread olive oil over it with seasoning and baked for 10 minutes at 375, then pulled it out and bake for another 10 at 425. I also only made 2 pizza's per batch, but I like thick crust pizza. I am trying 3 smaller pizzas today because I couldnt commit to toppings. I also have varied on the wheat to white flour ratio and every time it has come out perfect. I invested in a ceramic pizza stone this weekend, because this recipe has become such a staple in our household. AWESOME!

This recipe is easy and turned out great.  I read some of the reviews and used 2 cups of bread flour and 4-1/2 cups of all purpose flour instead of the rest of the bread flour to keep it from being to bread like. I reduced the salt to 3/4 tbls because I was afraid it would be to salty.   I do not like wheat flour in pizza so I did not bother using that at all. Glad this recipe was available I will be using it for a make your own pizza birthday party.  thanks for sharing.

Being from NY I have tasted many authentic crust. So although this isn't perfect, I have to give it 4 stars because it does the things that a pizza crust should do. Crunchy on the bottom and chewy on top! Great fun with the family and I know it would have tasted even better if I had a brick oven. :(  
I made a basil /walnut pesto which every gawked at but one bite and they all thought it was the best out of all of the pizzas'. One more thing, this does make a lot of dough. Family of 5, we made about five 10 inch personal size pans and still have leftovers.

Delicious!! It's chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside... simply outstanding! I would suggest making 2 pies out of this dough because my husband & I felt it was a bit too thick for 1 pie, but we enjoyed the delicacy of a thick crusted pizza!

YUM! This recipe was soo good. I made a really thick crust and I followed another reviewer's suggestion and heated the pizza stone up with the oven for about half an hour and then I pre-cooked the dough for about ten minutes before topping it. It was awesome!

Super easy to work with and very versatile.  I made some "quick and dirty" calzones, but had to step away from the process for longer than I expected.  The dough did not suffer from my neglect and performed just fine when I came back to it later.

Delicious!!! I've made this many times and it's always a hit. Tonight I did 2 cups whole wheat flour, 4 cups bread flour. Pre-baked for only about 4 mins (the crust shrinks up, so it has to still be soft enough to spread out again), added toppings, baked on 400 for 15 mins. 
I also made garlic breadsticks out of the leftover dough. Yum!

Awesome! Like a previous reader, we baked the dough/crust for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, then added toppings, and finally baked at 425 for 16 minutes more. Perfect!

Turned out great, I used my stand mixer. I didnt have any bread flour or whole wheat. I used all purpose and my dough rised when I didn't think it would, it was my first time, I would highly suggest this recipe to anyone!!! Oh I also put fresh basil and some garlic salt just for a bit of extra flavor. Topped with mozza, pepperoni, mushrooms, and carmelized red onions.

Followed the recipe to a T.  Wouldn't change a thing.  We cook the pizza on the top rack of the BBQ and it turns out lovely every time! We have 4 burners and only turn on the 2 outside burners while placing the cookie sheet in the center.  (We line the cookies sheet with aluminum foil and lightly brush it with olive oil).

LOVE this recipe~!!  Made this with a friend and we could not say enough good things about it. (i.e. "best home-made pizza")
However, one thing I'd suggest is to divide the entire recipe by three rather than just the dough, as it rises like no other and creates about a 9-inch personal pizza.

This dough was really simple to make and easy to work with. Not too sticky, or too doughy. I give 4 stars because I did have a little trouble getting it baked all the way through the first time I made it, but then I set the temperature a little lower and let it bake for a few minutes more and it turned out perfect.

This pizza was seriously the BEST pizza I have ever eaten!!  It was easy, and cheap!  It makes 3 large pizzas, and is delicious!  I took another reviewer's advice on another pizza dough's site and cooked this pizza on a heated pizza stone.  One word...FABULOUS!!  Better than any bought pizza, anywhere!  I wish there were more stars to rate this pizza.  I would give it 10 stars!

Easy to make even for a first timer, but the dough its self is tasteless and bland. It needs more salt and maybe some italian seasoning. Next time I make this I'll be glazing the crust with butter and garlic salt.   Some people have complained that it turned out soggy.. didn't seem to have that problem. I also baked the crust about 10 minutes before adding toppings. If you add some corn meal to the flour when rolling out your dough it will make it a little more crisp after baking.

This dough takes about 3 more cups of flour and is still sticky.  Also, so elasticy that it won't hold it's shape when you try to stretch it out.  I had mini pizzas when I wanted regular size. :(

I've been using this crust for years, and figured it deserved a review. Excellent crust! Best recipe I've found. Sometimes (when I'm feeling healthy) I add more whole wheat flour. Very yummy.

Delicious!  Very easy to make.  Worth the time to let it rise for at least an hour.  I did make two adjustments though.  1.)I used all-purpose flour because I didn't have any bread flour and 2.)I used 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour instead of just .5 cup.  I think next time I'll increase it to 2 or even 2.5 cups whole wheat flour and 3 cups of all-purpose flour.

This was a very good dough! I used it for the Chicken Pesto pizza recipe that is also on this website (very good!). I cut down the recipe because I only needed to make one pizza, and I prebaked it for 10 min on 350 degrees, and then put my toppings on and baked it another 10 (a little less) at 450 degrees. The end result was fabulous! It was tasty, and it was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect! I will use this recipes for all my pizzas!

Really delicious, even LOADED down with veggies it didn't get soggy. It made enough for a lot of pizza as stated, though I didn't see where in the recipe to put the sugar and accidentally omitted it. Even with that mistake it was just delicious. I raised the dough for more than the recommended amount--an hour, then punched it down and let it rise again.

Real nice crisp crust. I changed a cup of flour for another of whole wheat. Best thing about the recipe for me was eaze of rolling. Did not take long to cook. I did six minutes precook before toppings and another ten and it was done. I did use a hot pizza stone.

Really love this recipe. We normally will freeze 2 portions and use or refrigerate 1. Only change is to use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour (about 3 cups each). Makes delicious base for pizza.

Excellent!!  The crust didnt go soggy with lots of veggie toppings and even fresh tomatoes!  I added dried italian herbs and garlic to the liquid and it added just a bit more flavor.  My kids are already planning what toppings to use next time!!!

Excellent. I used a total of 1 1/2 c. wheat, 3 1/2 c. all purpose flour and just over 2 c. water. Edges were crisp, fluffy texture with a crisp bottom. Baked on preheated pizza stone for 15 minutes. Thanks!

As a very amateur cook this was the first pizza dough I have attempted outside of a bread machine.  Not only is it very easy to make, but my whole family voted it the best pizza crust ever.

Great and easy, virtually no effort with my KitchenAid mixer. Used 6 cups of white bread flour and no whole wheat. Made a large pizza one night and had enough dough the next night to make two large calzones!

This dough was great! I sub. rye flour for wheat because I had in on hand and used twice as much.  Next time I think I'll go half and half on the flours and see what happens. I tried cooking for 10 min then topping and cooking 10 min more and then I tried topping the raw dough and cooking 20 min, both turned out great.  We also tried thick crust and thin crust (adjusting the cooking times) and were delighted.  Great recipe, thanks.

I tried it tonight and 2 1/2 cups of water seems like way too much.  The dough was very runny and I had to add something like 4 cups of flour to get it into a cohesive ball.

I used a Bread Machine and set it to the dough cycle..simply wonderful. I ended up adding nearly 1 cup extra flour to get it not sticky. I am eating it right now and can't believe how great it is.

Beautiful dough....so much fun to make this and it was delicious. Made one plain cheese pie for the kiddos and another with provolone, green peppers, and baby bella mushrooms for me and my hubby. Froze the last third of dough for another time. I did mix this with my dough hook in my kitchen aid. It was my first homemade dough that was not in the bread machine and this recipe is perfect. Made the kids pie on a 16' pie pan and ours on the pizza stone for a crispier crust. Love this recipe!

I like the chewiness of the crust.  It baked really well, even with not allowing it to rise as long as the recipe suggested.  The fresh smell of the crust was wonderful too!  Next time I might try adding a little flavor to the crust.  I halved the recipe into 2 crusts, and that seemed to work out well.

I didn't have any whole wheat flour and can't get it here (I live in Puerto Rico) so I just made it with some bread flour (which I also can't get) that I had from my shipment from the states.  It was wonderful with all bread flour.  I did have to use the extra cup of flour making it 5 1/2 cups total in order to make it not stick to the sides.  Thank goodness for Kitchen Aide Mixers. The 8 minutes of kneading was a breeze! Yummy.  It made 3 GIANT pizzas which were yummy.

I made a pepperoni pizza using this dough and it was THE most delicious recipe I've made yet. I did follow the instructions of one member and used a pizza stone and peel to make the crust come out perfectly and I also added herbs to the dough in the mix-ins cycle of my bread machine, PERFECTION!!! This one's a true keeper!

Love this crust!   You do need to bake it longer though, I did 15 min. then added toppings then 20 min.   I think I make my pizzas smaller with a thicker crust.  }; >

great chewy texture and taste.  I added all ingredients in my bread machine to mix, then let it rise in a bowl.  I ended up adding at least another cup of flour though.  It was very sticky at first.

I am very please with how this recipe turned out.  I have made a LOT of pizza dough recipes in my life and so far this is my favorite.  I made it exactly as the recipe states,  with the addition of a bit more flour,  probably because it's a humid day in a humid climate.  The only change I may make next time is to use a pizza stone instead of a baking sheet. Enjoy!

This was great even when I used only all purpose flour.  Think I'll try kneading in some garlic and italian spices next time.

Came out pretty good but used butter instead of that too expensive olive oil.  It also makes for waiting for a long time to eat when you have to wait for the rise.

WOW, I made this a few weeks ago with my nieces and had a pizza party.  I ended up adding 2 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 2 cups and a few tablespoons of all-purpose white flour.  **Warning** if you aren't going to use this right away, don't wrap it up and leave it at room temp- it will keep growing.  Either use it or freeze it!  Still tasted amazing, can't wait to make it again!

I made this dough for the first time tonight and it was a huge hit with my husband, guests and all the children.  The dough was very easy to work with, rose beautifully and tasted delicious.  I didn't have bread flour, so I just used regular unbleached white flour.

This is a beautiful dough to work with. I used to work at a pizza joint who made their dough fresh everyday, so I've played in a lot of dough. As far as the taste, the house was divided. Half of us thought it was a 5 and half a 4. I personally just found it a smidgen too tough. My husband thinks I'm crazy and loved it. It also seemed like 20 minutes was too long. I may try this again but fiddle with the time, the temp, and when I put the toppings on.

This is the perfect pizza dough recipe!  I used more wheat flour than it called for...3 c wheat and 3 c all purpose.  We will definitely be using this recipe for all of our pizzas.

Really great! I added Italian seasoning to the dough... I pre-baked the crust, added sauce and toppings then baked for a while. The crust still wasn't done, so, I finished baking the pizza directly on the rack.

Love this recipe! After making it once, it has now been a Friday specialty at our house.  I haven't bought frozen pizza in over a month! Great savings and better for you when you make it yourself.

our 'go-to' dough. Makes 6 excellent calzones or 3 great pizza shells. Pizza night at our house comes once a week. This dough is a favourite for the whole family, is easy to make and stays tender and chewy inside while crispy on the out. I have subbed 1/2 cup ground flax seed in place of the whole wheat flour and this makes the dough really easy to handle and the finished crust nice and chewy. I also only use a/p flour as it's all I ever have on hand. No probs to be had with it at all.

I used this exact recipe and combined the dough with the sauce from another all recipes submission (pizza sauce and dough). It was excellent, best home made crust I've ever had. I gave the other two portions to my parents and sister who also loved it. Deffinate KEEPER!!!

Very good! I used this dough to make "peperoni stromboli" from this web site - (I left out the peperoni...)it was crisp on the outside and a bit soft on the inside... (i needed to add some extra flour to the dough.

This is by far the best homemade pizza dough I've tried.  I didn't have bread flour so I subbed all-purpose and it was fine, though I may have used 6 cups not 5 1/2.  After reading the other reviews I wished I had a pizza stone but I did prebake the crusts on the pans for 8 minutes before adding the toppings and they were perfect.  My 7-year old couldn't tell the whole wheat was there or she wouldn't have eaten it, but she gobbled it down and asked for seconds.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful crust! Much better than any store bought pizza dough. It made 3 nice sized pizza crust. I used one and put the rest in the freezer. They turned out great after being frozen. Thanks for sharing!

I let mine rise for 1-2 hours before I roll it out and also I play around with the flour and water amounts (sometimes use way less of both and/or eliminate the wheat flour)

I've made pizza dough before that came out ok. This recipe was perfect! I wanted a rustic flavor so I started with 1 cup of rye flour and then added unbleached bread flour until I liked the consistency. I don't know how much of the bread flour I added but it was nowhere near 5 cups. I actually wish I'd added a tiny bit less.  I tossed this dough and it was pretty fragile in the middle but baked up great on the stone. Loved the nutty rye flavor  FYI I don't have a pizza peal, I just use my big wood cutting board.  Next time I will experiment with adding things to the dough or maybe a different kind of flour. Not cause this wasn't great, just for fun.

Ok - what better night to test pizza dough than Super Bowl??  The three men in my family rate this a five.  I've been told to keep this recipe handy. :)  I didn't have a pizza peel (will be buying one tomorrow) so I ended up preparing and cooking the pizzas on parchment paper.  It worked pretty well, I think they would have been crisper if cooked directly on the stone.  Anyway, this recipe it great and I can't wait to make another batch and freeze it for later use!!

This is sensational. Pre-bake the crust for about 8-10 minutes at 325 before topping and it won't be soggy.

wasn't "bready" at all like others have commented- I used 1c whole wheat and 5c unbleached all-purpose flour, pre-baked and it was delicious. Crispy on the bottom, soft and chewy in the middle just like the perfect pizza crust.

The best!  This dough is fragile so it's best to follow the instructions and roll it out rather than trying to form it with your hands (like at a pizza shop).  I put all ingredients in my bread machine and it was a breeze.

I made pizza dough for the first time last night using this recipe and it turned out great!  The family loved it.
I followed the recipe exactly, but did prebake the crust for 10 minutes before putting the sauce on it.  I used a regular cookie sheet, which I greased and then sprinkled cornmeal over.  I was a little alarmed at first when I took it out of the oven and the entire thing had swelled up like a balloon. lol.  But I was easily able to deflate it and put the sauce and toppings on.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and dough hook to do the kneading and it made it so easy!  I may never order pizza in again.

Pretty good. I followed the recipe and made three crusts.  I froze two and they still rose in the freezer.  I'm still looking for a little more flavorful crust.  Also I'd like something that doesn't rise up in the middle when I precook the crust for a few minutes on a pizza stone before adding the toppings.

AWESOME!! I had tried a different dough recipe, and it had turned out too bready. This was perfect!! The pizza looked so beautiful when it was done. I pre-baked it for about 10 minutes, based on others' reviews. It puffed waaay up, but it deflated well enough and I didn't experience any problems once the toppings were on. I'm glad I still have half the dough in the freezer!

This dough is so easy to make and comes out great every time!!!   Make sure to check your expiration date on the packet of yeast - old yeast just doesn't work the same.

Too salty for my taste.  My husband said it was so salty it reminded him of playdough.  Next time I would only use 1 tsp. of salt.

Just baked my first pizza from scratch last night using this receipe & turned out great! My family loved it! (This was my first time making any type of dough requiring yeast.) My crust also puffed up quite a bit while pre-baking but was fine once I removed from oven & smashed it down a bit before adding the sauce & toppings. It turned out great; thanks for the great recipe!

This dough isn't bad.  I made it in the breadmaker and forgot to check on it; it was too wet and I had to incorporate more flour into it.  However, I also halved the recipe and it's pouring outside, so I'm willing to bet that's the reason.  It made a nice thick pizza dough that baked up well, so I'll try it again.  Thanks!  Update 1/2/09:  Tried this again today and made Quick and Easy Spinach Bread with it.  I halved the recipe and added about 1 tbsp more flour to get it to the correct moisture; perfect.  I added oregano to the dough and it was great.

What an awesome recipe!! It was extremely easy to make and the dough handles/shapes very nicely! I've never before come across a recipe for pizza dough that was so good. I made three small pizzas-(I grilled those immediately) first time I ever grilled a pizza, and it was actually perfect by the time I made the 3rd one :) LOL!-and two large crusts which I froze. Can't wait to pull those out to use!

Good stuff.  I added just a bit of wheat bran which helped give it a great grainy sort of texture.  Rolled it very thin - it wasn't dough-y at all.

This dough is wonderful.  I have been testing out different dough in my quest to make the perfect pie.  The was the easiest to work with and best tasting.  I used an extra tablespoon of salt and in addition to the tablespoon of sugar, I added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I also added an extra 1/2 cup of white flour.
The most important thing is the cooking temperature, so watch it closely.
The pizza I made was pesto chicken with mozz, fresh parm and fresh asaigo cheese.  It was better than any pizza I have had in a restaurant.

I made this dough (actually only half the recipe because that was all the yeast I had on hand) on Monday afternoon and put it in the fridge overnight. I took it out of the fridge around 9:00, and then at 11:00 used it with a couple 3 year olds to make our own pizzas. The kids were able to handle it easily (and so was I). Since I was making small pizzas, I only cooked it on a heated pizza stone for 12 minutes. It was wonderful!!!! The other mom LOVED it too and requested a copy of the recipe. My husband hasn't tried it yet, but I am sure he will like it and want to use it as his go-to dough!

This was very good, but it was a little bit too much like bread instead of pizza dough. Maybe I'll add more oil or less flour next time. I may have made a mistake somewhere.

This is the best pizza crust I have ever made.  I added some italian seasoning in with the olive oil giving not only a great taste but a great aroma.   To me, it is marvelous to have extra crust in the freezer to pull out later!  Thanks!

Good pizza crust, and very easy to make.  I used 2c. whole wheat flour, 4c. white, and turned out great. I love that this recipe doesn't require much yeast, yet is a nice hand tossed style crust...good for those who like thick OR thin crust. I love that I have 2 crusts ready to use in the freezer. I think this will be my default.

Followed the instructions, except added about 1.5 tsp of garlic herb powder with the olive oil and flour addition, and precooked @ 425 about 7 minutes.  I left the dough to rise in a large metal bowl (covered with wet paper towels), floating in a sink half-filled with luke warm water for 1 hr.  My roommate LOVED the crust.  It was good, but not spectacular.

Very good pizza dough.  This has a great taste and bakes very well.  A little hard to spread, but extra flour helps with that.  It tastes just as good after being frozen!

We have been using this recipe regularly since first trying it. I don't keep whole wheat flour, so I use only unbleached regular flour and it still turns out great. Make the dough in my bread machine, and then smooth it onto the pizza pan. The olive oil is a great addition that yields a lighter crust than I've done before. Thanks

Excellent recipe - with a few alterations.  I definitely intend to try this using the whole wheat flour - however, I have made this twice using all-purpose flour.  I also add a little extra salt, some garlic powder, dried oregano and basil to the dough to give it some extra flavor... delicious!

I like this pizza crust, although my hubby still likes Jay's pizza crust on this site better. It's a little bit too chewy and hard on the crust though.

Good dough thanks Stephen!  Make sure you have plenty of time cause it’s a little time consuming, in my case it was I also made the sauce.  Oh and kneading that dough sure gives a good arm workout.

This pizza crust was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and cooked the dough by itself for 10 minutes as recommended by others. I found the dough to be too runny (I added more flour to it) and a bit difficult to work with (but then I'm a total amateur at this) but it still turned out wonderfully. Will try adding spices to the dough next time as well!

Pretty bland overall, but easy and quick to make. I threw it in my bread machine on dough cycle which makes it super easy and quick. Despite trying to roll it very thin it still turned out thick and a bit chewy. I did precook the crust for 10 minutes which helped make the bottom crunchy. I will make again until I find something better.

As a way to save money, we started making our own pizza. I was never happy with the crusts I bought in the store and this recipe is just what I was looking for. Like many others, I season the dough with basil, oregano, and garlic. My 4 year old loves to help us make the pizza and it has turned into a nice friday night family tradition.

Very good dough.  I added a little onion and garlic powder, and used 1 1/2 cups of whole flour and 3 1/2cup regular.  I prebaked the dough for about 5 min before adding toppings.  It came out nice and crisp on the outside and soft and chewy inside.  I will be using this dough again.

By far the best pizza crust I ever made, It is worth the work to make this.  I did increase the Whole wheat flour as suggested by others and because it is healthier for us.

I have made this dough three times now and each time I tweak the recipe a little more.  I really like this one rolled thin and baked in a 13 x 9 baking pan.  Also make sure you prebake the dough to ensure crispness.  I always add italian seasoning on the dough before I bake and turns out crispy and wonderful.

This recipe made a really good and easy dough. I am very happy with it because I had never done anything like this before and it turned out great.  Next time I may precook the dough a little for an even crisper crust.

The flavor was really good, but it was a very 'puffy' dough.  I tried to make it was thin as possible and flatten it, but it still turned out sort of thick. It was alright, but not what I was looking for.

This is the best that I have tried yet.  I took the advice from a different reviewer and put more whole wheat flour and less bread flour, and it turned out wonderful.  I also divided it into 5 as I like my crust a lot thinner.

Made perfect crust the first time.  I made 2 thick crusts and had no problem with the topping getting too done before the crust was brown.  I'll be using this one as my standard pizza crust from now on.

Tasted great, but it took forever to cook though.  By the time the crust was baked, the toppings were burnt.  I will try cooking the dough a few minutes before adding the toppings next time.

I have never tried making pizza dough before, but this recipe is fabulous.  The dough has turned out great every time.  I have tried variations of whole wheat and white flour, and the recipe is very forgiving.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe produces a dough with an excellent texture, but it is lacking in flavor.  I don't really like the taste of bread flour.  Still very good, though.

This was my first time making homemade pizza and it turned out great!  I upped the wheat flour to 1 cup and reduced the bread flour to 5.  I also prebaked the crust about 8 minutes before adding the toppings.  I put the other two dough balls in the freezer, and will try one of them for dinner this weekend.  Definately worth the work!

I have made so many different pizza dough recipes over the past ten years, and I am not kidding when I say this one is the best one I've ever made.  I increased the whole wheat flour to one cup, and decreased the white flour to five cups.  It was chewy, crisp. Delicious.  As good as our local organic Flatbreads recipe.

I give this zero stars. I spent way too much time cursing at the dough while I tried to pinch, pull, and stretch it into submission, and then there wasn't even enough to fit my standard-size pizza pan. I was very upset at taking the time, preparation, and mess required to make it and then it not turning out well.

Good crust - I've used it a number of times without fail.  Freezes beautifully.  I often tinker with the flour ratio, upping the whole wheat, but the recipe is great as is.  I like to brush the pizza pan and outer edge of the dough with garlic oil before I bake since, despite being a great base for toppings, the dough is a touch bland on it's own.  Thanks for sharing, Stephen.

This was my first try at making pizza dough.  It turned out quite well.  I made it all in the large glass bowl of my standing mixer with the dough hooks.  I let them knead the dough for about 7-8 minutes after all the flour was incorporated.  Easier that kneading by hand.  The hubby likes pizza made with this better than the stuff we order in!

I've been searching for just the right pizza dough recipe, and this one is it!!  Like many others, I increased the wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased the bread flour (actually I've been using all purpose flour) to 5 cups.  I also substitute 1 TBSP. of honey for the sugar. This dough freezes perfectly - the taste and texture are equal to that of the fresh-made dough.

This dough is wonderful.  One of my friends used to work at a pizza shop and was dutifully impressed with the consistency of it for shaping while I was simply impressed with the quality.  A great recipe!

I am always afraid to made bread/dough because I have had some failed attemps at it, but this recipe was pretty fool-proof.  The dough was very easy to work with.  A success!! Thanks!!

i made this recipe to cook on my boyfriend's propane grill, went out on a limb & adjusted the flour ratio to 3 c. all purpose/3 c. whole wheat. the process seemed fairly straight forward & the dough handled well. one note: i had this in the refridgerator for 2 days before baking it. my dough kept on rising the entire time & at one point had to be put in a bigger plastic bag. overall, the crust came out pretty good. thank you stephen!

This is a good dough.  Nice and chewy.  Mine needed a lot (about a cup) more flour than the recipe called for just for it to ball together.  Next time I'll let it sit with just the wheat flour for a while so it can soak up some of the liquid before mixing in the white flour. The crust didn't brown and crisp on the outside as much as I would have liked but it's an overall good dough.     I love that it has whole wheat flour in it even though it's just a little bit.  The fam hates whole wheat anything and it's nice to be able to sneak some in the diet.  I'll use this one again,just tweak it a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  Though next time I think I'll make only two pizzas - I like a thicker crust.

This crust was...okay.  I do like the taste of the whole wheat (I increased it to a cup).  My kids liked it.  Maybe it would have been better if I had baked the crust a bit first before adding toppings.  I may or may not make this again.

This pizza dough is amazing.  I froze two crusts for later and they turned out equally as well.  Thanks for the great pizza crust recipe.

This recipe is great- especially when baked on a pizza stone.  The recipe is very
easy to assemble.  It still turns out and tastes greats even for those who are not that great at following
recipe's like myself!
