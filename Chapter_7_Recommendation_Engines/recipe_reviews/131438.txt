This isn't a favorite in our house but it was easy to make and tasted ok.  I would recommend marinading it in at least something to get rid of the natural taste of the venison, I found just frying it without a marinade had a very weird taste.

This recipe is one of my husbands and my FAVORITE ways to cook Venison.  It is easy and quite a tasty way to cook this kind of meat. Every year my husband kills a deer, and he is a VERY PICKY eater and it is hard to find different ways to cook Venison.  Thank You for putting it on this site.

In order to make this more tasty I use shortening instead of vegetable oil. Also, instead of using bread crumbs you only have to season your flour with pepper, garlic salt, red pepper, and any other flavors you like. I coat the venison in the dry mixture, then in the egg wash and then back in the dry mixture. Delicious every time!

Very good recipe.  The flour and bread crumbs help to diguise the gaminess of the venison.  I used olive oil to cook the venison, and then when I was done frying that, I fried some onion to go with the venison.  Deeeeelish!

very, very good.  I didn't have breadcrumbs but I used Panko crumbs.  My husband and I loved the flavor and the tenderness of the steaks.

I've cooked deer steak several ways and never thought about chicken fried. This is great.  I used Italian Style bread crumbs just because I use it for most of my breadings.

I love this way to use venison. I discovered it one night when I had forgotten to start marinating the steaks until we were already getting hungry. It's great because it's quick and really, really good.

However, I have discovered that the cut is really important; venison steaks are just roasts (or other cuts) that have been cut into slices, so pay attention to which cut the steaks are coming from. This recipe is best with steaks from more tender cuts like the sirloin or eye of round, since there's no marinade to help the tenderizing.

Also, try a bit of worcestershire on the finished steaks and—this is important—use bacon grease instead of oil. Bacon makes it better \m/

This is a good recipe, I add a little garlic powder to the bread crumbs because we love garlic, this works well with tenderized deer steak and tenderized blackstrap, thanks for an easy and tasty recipe. ????????

Very good recipe! Venison and Elk tend to be much drier than beef since it's lean so I think Chicken fried is the best way to cook it. I used oryx meat that my husband killed (cooks similar to venison and elk) and this was so tasty and more moist than the restaurant chicken fried steak I've had! Mashed potatoes and white gravy is a must for my family to go with the recipe as well! (I used the drippings to make my gravy). My picker meat eater 2 year old cleaned his plate!!!  I will just use plain panko in place of the seasoned bread crumbs next time since the herbs threw the taste off slightly. But this is a keeper recipe for sure!

Marinated and grilled is the way to go with venison steaks, but if time doesn't allow then this recipe is an excellent alternative. Cut the breadcrumbs at least in half (1 cup) or you will have much wasted. Best feature of this recipe is it took me only 20 minutes from opening fridge to plating dinner. Quick and easy with a good (not excellent, but good) result.
