First, AR needs to change the title of this recipe because the submitter gives a you a rum sauce not a vanilla sauce to go with this bread pudding and I think I would have much preferred a vanilla sauce with this recipe.  The bread pudding itself however is very good.  I didn't have cinnamon raisin bread, so I used a whole cup of raisins and upped the amount of cinnamon to a whole Tbsp. I also added a bit of nutmeg.  I doubled the amount of rum and used 2 apples that I thinly sliced and didn't bother cooking because they cook inside the bread pudding.  I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1 & 1/4 cup of half and half and 3 eggs.  Make sure you use stale bread so as to not get things overly soggy (I used stale hoagie rolls).  I used a 9 inch sprinform pan and put a baking sheet underneath during baking.  The bread pudding is delicious and has a really nice rum flavor. The rum sauce however is not that good and really not necessary.  I would use a vanilla sauce over top of this or just a a bit of whipped cream.

This was delicious!  I made some adjustments however.  I used a whole loaf of Pepperidge Farms cinnamon raisin bread. I used the whole can of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup 1% milk=2cups.  I added and extra egg and extra  butter - 7 TBS. I doubled the sauce recipe, OMG it is soooo good.  Side note - I used a Gala apple.  My guests told me it was the best they'd ever had-I thought so too!  It will be a holiday tradition for our family from now on.

Maybe its just me but the ingredient amounts just did not add up to the 9" pan.  I ended up cutting two more slices of bread, an extra apple and used an extra egg.  It looks and smells delish but I definitely needed those adjustments.

I always try to make a recipe as it it written before I make my own modifications. That being said, the pudding was DE-LISH!! Next time I will leave off the final glaze stuff..it was just too much sweet on top of sweet. Maybe a scoop of ice cream or Cool Whip instead. Awesome! Thank you for the recipe!

Just tried this recipe for my husband who absolutely loves bread pudding.  He also loves raisin bread, so how could I go wrong!!  My instincts told me to follow some of the adjustments suggested by Glamadana, and she turned out to be correct.  I used a whole loaf of bread and a can of evaporated milk to which I added a 1/2 cup of milk to make 2 cups total.  And I also used the 3 eggs and 7 TBS butter she suggested.  Unfortunately I forgot to double the sauce recipe, but will do so the next time.  This could not have been any better.  My husband just loves this bread pudding.  It is definitely a keeper.  The flavor and the texture is perfect, and the rum sauce is delightful and light.  I will probably use it on some other things.  If I changed anything I might add a tiny bit more rum to the main recipe, but it is not really important.  The recipe works as is.  Thanks Chicagocook22 for sharing this one.

MMMM!!! Just made this tonight.  I doubled the rum, because I just love the rummy flavor.  I also did with regular bread and no raisins and I smooshed it down really well before popping in the oven.  LOVE IT!!

I baked the pudding in three 6" individual casseroles that were about 1-1/2" high.  Really like the bread pudding, but the rum sauce tasted too much like cornstarch.  I added about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the sauce, and that helped.  We enjoyed this dessert.

Great! I used French bread instead of raisin bread and it a thinly sliced pear instead of an apple. It turned out fantastic.

This was a great recipe. Every Christmas we make a Swedish traditional hot drink called Glogg that is made with rum and port wine and spices. It also has raisins and prunes in it, but there is always leftover prunes and raisins. I didn't want to waste them so I started searching for a recipe I could incorporate them into and came across this one. It was delicious. When it came time to sauteing the apples, I tossed the prunes and raisins in and cooked slightly. The final touch was that wonderful rum sauce. OH MY GOODNESS is that ever good. -though my husband happened to be walking by when I was finishing it up and he tasted it and said "It needs more Rum!" as he tipped the bottle and poured about a 1/4 cup in. It was very rummy and very delicious. Such a great recipe.  I will definitely make this one again.

We have edited this recipe and added 1/2 cup milk and the vanilla missing from the Vanilla Sauce. (!) We apologize for the omission.

DELISH! I was looking for a recipe to use up a stale sourdough baguette, and added to this some previously store-bought cinnamon rolls we didn't care much for that had been stowed in the freezer, instead of the sliced bread. Used a pear and Zante currants on hand instead of apple and raisins, and as another review suggested, upped the amount of rum to about 1/4 cup (probably could have used more, actually, if you like that rummy flavor). Soy milk instead of regular, and didn't have cornstarch, glaze worked out fine.  I subbed turbinado (raw) sugar for the white sugar. There is definitely a LOT of sugar overall  in this recipe (think it could be cut back if desired). Overall, a wonderful recipe and oh-so-good!

The recipe doesn't say dark rum, but after trying regular clear rum I must say that I think you should definitely use dark.

I omitted the sauce and used Rum flavoring and it was SO moist and delicious.  A hit for the whole family.  Will make this again and again and again!

YUM!!! 
I used gala apples for this one and I altered, by a smidge, the rum/vanilla combo for the glaze. I lessened the rum a little and bumped up the vanilla a little for an actual vanilla sauce. I made believers out of previous non-bread pudding believers with this recipe. Raves and more raves. Thank you so much for this recipe, it's a keeper!!!

Used condensed milk instead of evaporated (moving too quickly) and got OUTSTANDING reviews. If you don't care about making healthy bread pudding (an oxymoron to begin with), I suggest trying it that way. :-)

I was told this is the best bread pudding ever!I used cinnamon raisin challah bread and used almost a whole loaf.I poured the rum sauce on the individual servings knowing we couldn't eat the entire casserole. When I reheated the left over the next day I drizzled a little heavy cream to moisten it again. Delicious!!!

Overall  I enjoyed this recipe. For me personally, I wouldn't have used all the sauce. It was just a tad too sweet. Otherwise it was good!

I used leftover Italian bread and coconut rum in the pudding.  I did not taste the rum and did not use the rum sauce, instead topped with whipped cream.  The pudding was sweet and delicious. I would make it again with a little less sugar then try it with the rum sauce.
