Had this as desert for a dinner party where I focused on spicy, North African food. This was easy and everyone loved it! I did alter it a bit - I'm not on the South Beach Diet...I quartered 4 pears, used about a cup of orange juice, and put a bit of cinnamon in the topping mix. The topping and OJ combined to make a pudding-like sauce; it was fantastic! I had people going into the kitchen to steal another piece!

Fabulous!  I used pears that were over ripe.  Came out perfectly
