There is a great mix of flavors and textures in this recipe if you don't blow it by following it too closely (ha!). The lime and vinegar are definitely strong, even for a lime and vinegar lover like myself. I ended up adding sugar at the end to even up the field a little, but the consistency of the sauce was great as written (I was a little surprised at that - I thought there might be too much cornstarch). I like my veggies barely-done to crisp-tender, so the 6-8 minutes on the carrots and peas would have killed this recipe for me. I also added mushrooms and zucchini. I cooked the pork first and set it aside, then did the mushrooms, added the carrots for a few minutes, then the zucchini, snap peas, and pork in just to heat through (which got my zucchini and peas just the way I like them). I like the spice and the overall flavor, but definitely had to play around with this to get it where I wanted it. Thanks!

Modifications I made: omitted the cornstarch from the marinade (for fewer carbs); sliced the pork thinly instead of cubes (turned out nice and tender!); used lemon b/c I had it on-hand; omitted chile peppers and chili oil, using instead a tsp. or two of red pepper flakes, fried with the ginger; added 1 sm red bell pepper and 1/2 white onion, omitted green onion; didn't bother to julianne the peas and didn't chop the peanuts.

Turned out spicy enough for our tastes (I like a little bite but no burn), but the vinegar overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. The lemon juice may have also played into the overpowering tang this dish had. 

I'll use this recipe as a base in the future but do something a little less tangy for the sauce.

I absolutely loved the taste of the pork and soy sauce marinade!  It cooked up beautifully!  I always try to substitute cooking spray for any olive oil and I must say it did not diminish any flavor in my book!  This recipe was beautiful until I added the 1 Tbs soy sauce, 2 Tbs rice vinegar, 1 tsp cornstarch, and 3 tsp dark sesame oil!  My sugar snap peas just soaked up the vinegar taste and ruined the whole recipe!  I added honey to try and tone down the vinegar flavor!  After adding the honey, the vinegar taste was toned down just a bit!  I had to pick out all the sugar peas to make the recipe tolerable again!  I beseech any other home-makers to not add the second bit of soy sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, and sesame oil!  Without that, this recipe is FANTASTIC! An absolutely perfect bite!  I will definately cook this again but, leave out the aforementioned ingredients!

I loved this recipe. I made it low fat by eliminating all but 1 1/2 tsp of sesame oil, using 3 jalapeno peppers, whole button mushrooms and hot sauce. I'm making another batch today to freeze in small one portion containers. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

Very good - I made revisions according to my taste.  I used leftover pork loin roast that I julienned, so I omitted the marinade (cooking time was also reduced overall).  I also omitted the chili peppers, as I don't like such blazingly hot food I can't taste anything else (plus I didn't have them).  The chili oil was changed to a 1/2 tsp. of chili paste with garlic (and I added a few quartered mushrooms to the veggies).    Very nice quick weeknight dinner!

This was very tastey.  I omitted the chile oil and the chile because my son doesn't like hot food.  Instead ofusing peanut oil I used 2 ts. of olive oil.  Was a hit, I also only used 1 1/2 ts. of sessame oil because of the fat grams.  My kids loved it.

Very good - had to play with the ingredients a little based on what was in my cupboard - I used lemon juice, instead of lime, and sambel oolek instead of fresh chilies.  I added mirin to the sauce.  I used crushed cashews instead of peanuts.  Overall it turned out great and spicy!

This is a WINNING recipe!

I followed the recipe, but I left out the sesame oil (didn't have any on hand) and I added a little sugar to the lime mixture. I also used the Kirkland stir fry frozen veggies. 
Needles to say there were no leftovers.

I made this per the recipe, but added some additional vegetables.  The sauce ended up tasting very strong on the vinegar which ruined it for everyone.  Two stars were generous considering!

I made some adjustments to this recipe so I'm going to rate this manly on the sauce so here goes.  I used a left over cooked tendorloin that I grilled last night.  I thought it would work because the marinade was lime, garlic, ginger, peppers, soy and sesame oil.  For the folks that thought it had a lot of lime flavor...maybe use half a lime.  That is what I did because I had a large lime.  I think what folks may have been picking up on was the acid flavor from the lime and from the rice vinegar.  I thought the sauce flavor was ok.  The next time I would cut back the rice vinegar to 1 TBS and increase the soy or eliminate the lime or the rice vinegar (I'm not sure you need both).  I also would use 1/2 of a SMALL lime if you want to.  I also added a clove a garlic (what stir fry doesn't have garlic?)  I actually had to re-read the recipe to make sure I didn't miss it.  I would add more garlic next time (2-3 cloves).  The recipe called for green chiles.  In the Southwest that can mean many different things.  I used 1/2 jalapeno and I would use a whole one next time.  I think you loose a lot of the "heat" when you heat up the jalapenos.  I did add the chile oil in the end, but it was not spicey for my taste (my pickey one ate it with no complaints read not spicey at all).  All in all it was an ok recipe.  I have some other stir fry recipes that I enjoy better.  I think this one could be tweaked to make an outstanding recipe.

This recipe was very tasty and unique. There are just a few things I will tinker with, including the amount of chili oil (or substitute). It was spicy, but perhaps not as spicy as it could have been. We did not use the chopped peanuts included at the end of the recipe, and I think it did not make the slightest difference. We will definitely add this one to our "recipe rotation"! Thanks, Lorna!

Very simple to make and very tasty.  I did tone down the peppers and chile oil first time around to ensure not too hot, will turn up the heat a little next time.

Made this for dinner last night and the whole family loved it (the kids picked around the veggies).  I left out the peanuts and the chili oil, but didn't miss either of them.

This was a lot of work and did not turn out like I hoped! We love Chinese  food from PF Changs to Panda Express to homemade, but this jusdt didn't work. Way too much lime flavor. I made a special trip to the store to get the chili oil and fresh ginger so that I could follow the recipe exactly.

I made this for a quick meal and I loved it. The changes I made were from the suggestions from other reviews. I did not use the chille oil or green chille peppers. But added sugar to the lime sauce for the end of the recipe and added chille pepper flakes 2 pinches and cayanne pepper to taste. It was not too hot, but very  favorful!!

Maybe I'm just not into Sichuan-style food.  Anyway, I found this to be a lot of work (actually it was fun to prepare as a result!) but not very exciting in flavor.  I'm not into spices and didn't really like the flavor underneath the spices.  My husband didn't care for it much either.  But it could just be our tastes.

Very Tasty. I do think next time I will add a bit more sauce to it. I also forgot to add the chili oil and the nuts, but I will add that to the leftovers. But this was tasty without those things. I think I'd like to add water chestnuts next time too. I served this over some shirataki noodles. Yummy and filling dinner.

This was wonderful!  We made a few changes to the original recipe by skipping the cornstarch, tripling the sauce because we added pasta to the stir fry ,and adding some lemon juice at the end. We used chili paste instead of chili oil, and red pepper instead of the chilis, and we used olive oil instead of peanut oil.

I thought this was great.  I loved the flavor.  I didn't have chili oil so used red pepper flakes instead.  I just about tripled the "sauce" (lime juice etc) but only used 1.5 chili peppers. I didn't have the snap peas, but did have broccoli and mushrooms so I included those.  This is for sure a keeper!!

Very tasty!  I added sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, and white onion.  We really enjoyed this recipe but it was not as spicy as I expected.  I will turn up the heat next.  A definite keeper!  Thanks.

We loved this recipe- my spicy loving son and husband want it to be a regular addition to our menu. For the non spicy girls I used red bell pepper instead of chili peppers. However, I read reviews first and tweaked it according to our chinese food tastes. I changed rice vinegar to 2 tsp instead of tbsp. I added 2 cloves minced garlic to pork marinade.I switched 2 tbsp sweet chili sauce for chili oil and  I added 1 cup chicken broth at end of cooking to make it saucier. I made 1/2 spicy and 1/2 not, and both were good, but the spicy was better.

Like others, I added more vegies:  water chestnuts, long beans, sweet yellow pepper, shitakes; and bumped up the sauce a bit with more of everything plus little water (otherwise way too salty), and because we love it with pork, oyster sauce.  My family all had seconds and I really enjoyed it too.

Solid recipe. But do yourself a favor and cut up an onion and add it during the rest of the vegetables. Then don't kill yourself trying to find chili oil in your lousy local supermarket. It ain't there. Instead, get some of that Thai Chili Sauce in the ethnic aisle and let people decide on their own level of spice.

It was OK at best.  It was a little bit too sour and not very spicy, not the taste I expected at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, so maybe with a little less sour flavour it would be better

This was very good!  I didn't put as much of the chili oil as it called for.  It still had a kick though!  I added some celery and water chestnuts too and instead of the peppers I used crushed red pepper flakes.

I agree on this being a good base for other things but my whole family and I really liked this just like it is.  Its very easy to do. Very good, thanks!


Update: Ive had to come back and change my rating to 5 star from 4. Every time I make this I have to double or triple the recipe or there isnt enough. My family inhales this. Once they ate it so fast, I didnt get any (teach me not to fix drinks etc for everyone. noone waited on me!).

My family loved this recipe. I added some cabbage, red bell pepper, and a little more chili oil than specified. After I dished out my son's portion, I added some crushed red pepper to spice it up even more (we love spicey food). The pork was very tender and flavorful. No leftovers means this is a keeper!

This was a good meal and a very easy recipe t make. I did make some changes due to a lake of some ingredients and taste. I used regular vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar since I didn't have any and I did not include the chili oil or pepper or the onions but that was due to eating preferences. Next time I make it I will follow the recipe to the letter to see how I like it

I thought it was quite good but next time I would skip the lime. As someone recommended, I added some sweet chilli sauce and although it was a touch too sweet, it gave the dish some spice. I would make it again.

Loved it until I added the vinegar and lime juice. The whole batch was ruined by the overwhelming sourness despite my attempts to bring it back. Trying again tonight but will definitely not be adding the same amount of lime and vinegar!! Love the spice and crunch of the nuts!

The consistency of the sauce was perfect, but the flavor was too strong.  I wish I hadn't wasted the veggies, pork, and rice by mixing them with it.

I was so excited to make this for dinner tonight. Oh boy, was/am I disappointed. The lime and the vinegar are just too strong (I followed the recipe). It tasted like no Szechuan dish I have ever had in my life.

If you like authentic restaurant food and like your vegetables with a nice crisp bite to them this is a good recipe to start with but the cooking instructions need tweaking. I marinated thinly sliced pork tenderloin minus the corn starch and added the extra corn starch to the "lime" mixture.  Actually I used pineapple juice instead of lime juice because I don't care for lime in this type of recipe. I stir fried the thin pork strips quickly in peanut oil until just tender and removed from the wok.  I added a wee bit more oil and then all the veggies, stirred them around until they were glossy and a bright crisp color (1 min or so), added the sauce mixture and the pork with it's juices and cooked just until the sauce was cooked through and thickened up. Total cooking time wasn't more than 6 minutes after the wok heated up.  I also added pineapple chunks to mine.  Stir frying the meat 6 minutes and then cooking another 6 minutes with the veggies and sauce just makes everything too mushy and overcooked for my taste.  Next time I make this I'll only use 1 tsp of sesame oil and 1/2 tsp of hot chili sauce instead of using green chili peppers and chili oil.  Play around with your own variation of ingredients.  Nice jump off recipe as long as you don't over cook it.

I love stir fry recipes because I often have a plethora of random, leftover veggies in my kitchen and this is a great way to eat them!  I usually make my stir fry sauce with peanut butter but after finding out I didn't have any, I turned my attention to this recipe.  I had to use a lemon instead of a lime because I had it on hand and it was great.  I used tofu instead of pork, and didn't marinate it beforehand.  I changed up the veggies to fit our needs and used some green and orange bell pepper, white onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and yellow squash, and broccoli.  Served it over brown rice and it was oh-so-tasty!  I added some spicy Chinese mustard to mine, too, since I left out the chile peppers.  Oh, and I used cashews instead of peanuts (again, pantry contents.)  Already dreaming of the leftovers that are in the fridge for my lunch!

This could be a lot better.  First of all, you don't need to use pork tenderloin.  The price is really high, and if you use a cheaper cut, it's just fine.  I don't know any Chinese restaurants (and I live in a city with a huge Asian population) that uses tenderloin for this kind of dish.  Second, cut the pork into strips.  "Cubes" is really non-descriptive, and if you cut the pork into stew-sized cubes, they will never get tender enough.  Third, this is not really that spicy.  I saw that from the start and put some chili sauce into the lime mixture and it still wasn't really spicy.  Use lots of chili sauce. And fourth, cut back on the cornstarch in the lime juice or it will thicken immediately.  At least that's what happened to me with a high heat burner.  I added some Chinese rice wine to the lime mixture also, I think that helped but next time I will use the rice wine and omit the vinegar, which made it end up a little too acidic.

I left off the chilies so it was quite mild.  Used lemon instead of lime, cashews instead of peanuts, because that was what I had.  Very good pork dish as well as an inexpensive meal.  We buy the pork shoulder and other non loin cuts.  Cut off chunks for dishes like this and then use all the rest including fat for making sausage.  So you can have a good yet inexpensive meal.

As I was making this, I thought it was going to be wonderful because of all the tasty ingredients.  Unfortunately, the lime juice overpowers everything else.  My partner and I only thought this recipe was OK as is.  I probably won't make it again, but If I did I would reduce the amount of lime juice to allow the other flavors (ginger, sesame oil, etc.) to shine through.

It's not very often that I give such a low rating, but this was terrible!! I think the name should be changed to Lime Pork Stirfry, as this was the predominate flavour in the dish. Sorry:(

It turns out better than expected but not super spicy. The vinegar/lime touch with peanuts makes this dish stands out. I like it with more gravy so I added beef broth and lime juice in step 2, yummy!

Fantastic recipe - one of the best stir fry's i've ever had. I used lemon instead of lime, olive instead of peanut oil, and no peanuts. Instead of the fresh chile peppers i used cayennes. It was nice and spicy and the lemon and vinegar made the meal.

I surprised that this recipe has gotten such high marks. I carefully followed the directions and used the right ingredients, but I was very disappointed. The pork was nice and tender, but the flavor was not particularly enjoyable. I love spicy food, but this is not a recipe that I'll try again.
