This recipe is fabuloso!  Thanks to the other reviewers who found this not creamy enough, I substituted heavy cream for the milk.  It was perfectly thick and very creamy!  This is one of my top 5 pasta sauce recipes now!

This is a great recipe.  It does need more seasoning.  I added salt, extra pesto and extra cream cheese and only used white and portabello mushrooms.  I also added a tablespoon of garlic cream cheese.  It's even better reheated the next day--it's creamier.

Very good, simple recipe. Based on comments that it was bland, I chopped up some sun-dried tomatoes and added them- definately a good addition. I even used some of the juice in place of the oil for sauteing the mushrooms/ garlic. Liked the flavors a lot, thanks

Great recipe -- I love it because it's lower fat than some of the creamy pasta recipes.  I eyeballed everything, and added an extra spoonful of cream cheese and one of pesto too.  I also added more cloves of minced garlic & some red pepper while I cooked the mushrooms.

I thought this was excellent!  I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of half and half to make it a little creamier.  I also added a pinch of Herbes de Provence because my jarred pesto didn't have quite enough oomph.  Even though it was quick and easy, it makes for a very elegant meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Used regular button mushrooms and liked it just fine. Also, I used heavy cream instead of milk. A little bland but still good.

This recipe was INCREDIBLE, but I did make some changes, based on other reviews, my tastes, and the contents of my fridge.  I used extra garlic, nearly a cup of pesto, extra cream cheese, and fat-free half & half instead of milk.  I also added some pre-cooked chicken breast.  The sauce was a little runny for my taste, so I thickened it by blending a spoonful of sauce with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch--it really did the trick.

I thought the dish was flavorful- but the sauce wasn't as creamy as I would have preferred.  My husband was very impressed with the dish.

Very good with a few adjustments. Added some onions when sauting the mushrooms. Added more pesto and cream cheese. Used half and half instead of milk. And you must add about 2T or more of white cooking wine. I served it with some steak marinated in italian dressing and it was awesome!!!  This will now be in my recipe box:) Thanks for sharing

This recipe is the best recipe of fettuccini that I got from this website. My entire family loved it, especially when I baked some chicken breasts with hot sauce and added them on top. It was great!

Extremely bland, not nearly creamy enough even though I substituted half the milk for heavy cream and tripled the cream cheese.  I also used half a head of garlic and it still had no flavor.  I think all the liquid in the mushrooms boiled the flavor out of the garlic so I would recommend sauteeing the mushrooms first until the liquid is gone, then add the garlic.  Also up the pesto, at least double it.  A huge helping of parmesan cheese also increased the flavor, I used a little over a cup added to the whole mixture and it still wasnt enough.

It was a good and healthy idea, but a boring and bland execution.  Next time I make this I will use alot more garlic, replace all milk with heavy cream (so much for healthy) and add red pepper flakes, more pesto, and about 1.5 cups parmesan cheese.

The sauce was kind of bland.  I needed to add some garlic and other spices to make it better tasting.

Oh . This pasta dish is the truth. I added a few squeezes of basil paste as I had accidentally added more mushrooms than the recipe called for. Also the sauce took a long time to thicken so I added a bit of Parmesan cheese to give it some more body. It was really incredible. I found white mushrooms work just as nicely as crimini. Good luck!

By reading the reviews I was able to adapt this recipe to our tastes, so giving it 4* may not really be fair. I tasted this as made and thought it to be too bland, so I added 2 more TBSP of pesto, 2 more large garlic cloves and a very large amount of freshly ground black pepper. For the sauce I used 1 cup of skim milk + 1/4 cup of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 tsp cornstarch. The sauce was perfect as far as sticking to the pasta. It was not runny as some others found. Since we had some leftover for another meal, I added about a cup of cut up rotisserie  chicken  to it before reheating. It was very good!

Recipe did not really turn out as I expected. It was kind of bland and the sauce was not very rich and creamy. Next time, I'll probably just saute the mushrooms and then mix with hot fettuccine and pesto. My husband really liked it though!

I loved the mushrooms with the sauce but my husband and grandson were not as impressed.  Oh, well.  Easy to prepare, some time spent cleaning and preparing mushrooms but not difficult.

The concept Is beautiful, but no matter what I did oil and milk was oil and milk. It did not combine and made for an odd texture.

Rendered some bacon in which to sauté the mushrooms, used evaporated milk, made fresh pesto and added a bit of parmesan cheese. Very rich, fragrant and flavourful.

Agree with others that these pasta are a bit bland. Needs more garlic, pesto and cream cheese! Parmesan would be good too.

Thanks for the feedback... I posted this recipe a few years ago and really appreciate the suggestions.  It continues to be a family favorite... we add more garlic and cream cheese, too!

Like others, I found this sauce bland. I had read the reviews, so I added an extra clove of garlic, an extra tbsp cream cheese and some shredded parmesean cheese--and it still wasnt enough. Perhaps if the mushrooms were sauteed in some white wine?...
