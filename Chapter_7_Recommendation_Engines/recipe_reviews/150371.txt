I was looking for a recipe for my lunch box using up the Thanksgiving leftovers.  I used my leftover roast chicken, homemade dressing and mashed potatoes.  My dressing was well seasoned so I left out the onion, celery seed and garlic.  I also added a few tablespoons of homemade chicken broth over the dressing, a few pats of butter on top of the potatoes and a layer of frozen green beans (precooked in boiling water until almost done to make sure they would be fully cooked in the dish).  I usually get tired of leftovers after 2 or 3 days but looked forward to this at lunchtime for the whole week.  This one stays in my recipe file.

I made my own stuffing and mashed potatoes and although the taste was good it was a little on the dry side. Perhaps a little chicken broth added to the turkey mixture would have helped. Or maybe a layer of cranberry sauce between the potato and turkey layers??? It certainly would be super easy if you used a box of stuffing and a tub of prepared mashed potatoes which I know is what the recipe writer intended.

At first I was turned off by everything all together but when I tried it I was floored! It's everything I love in one bowl and FANTASTIC!! It was easy and fun to make. Thanks so much for the post! Everyone should try this one! I only changed two things about this recipe - I left out the celery because of personal taste and also left out the celery seed and garlic seasoning because I used Jennie-O Cracked Pepper seasoned turkey and it didn't need anything else.

Had to change the recipe as I couldn't get any turkey breast so I substituted turkey meatballs. The family loved it. I think I'd add some veggies next time. Really great though.

I don't normally like stuffing with my turkey dinners but this was delicious! I added whole cranberry sauce to my own serving. Bought thick slabs of deli oven-roasted turkey and pre-made mashed potatoes to make it a super-quick meal!

I made this with turkey cutlets. It was good. The family appreciated it. Husband likes everything with gravy. So next time I will make gravy to pour over after serving.

Love that it used up my holiday leftovers. I added cranberry sauce slices between the turkey and the potatoes. Yum.

This was awesome! I followed to the letter. I cut up boneless skinless chicken breast and then boiled it before adding to the skillet. So glad I tried it. Very easy and does taste just like Thanksgiving dinner. The only thing I will change next time I make it will be making two boxes of stuffing...just my preference.

I made this recipe for an easy Thanksgiving in the mountains - we didn't want to spend a lot of time cooking a big dinner. This was the PERFECT solution! It was yummy and tasted JUST like a full Thanksgiving meal in one dish. I think it would also be great for leftovers too!

I thought it turned out delicious. I made one goof. I prepared everything early before our guests arrived. Put it on the Fridge for about an hour. We heated it up but at what the recipe said. It should have gone much longer. Thankfully we had understanding friends over. For our second helpings we microwaved it. That was much better. I did buy a jar of gravy because some of the comments said it was a little dry. Didn’t really need it but who doesn’t like a little gravy? I also served cranberry from the can. It was all delicious. My wife added a little spinach salad that was a nice addition too. We will make it and serve it again.
