I made this with fresh peas from the a local farmers market.  Followed the recipe as directed.  I let them sit overnight and even in that short time, these were waaaaay to vinegary.  Additionally the Lemon flavor was so strong that they had a shoe-polish taste.  I also don't think tarragon was the "right" herb for this taste combo. No one in the house could eat these and I ended up throwing our both jars.  Quite disappointed in the outcome of this recipe.  Really was excited about the idea and may try again using much less vinegar and maybe a tiny shred of lemon.  Dill perhaps instead of tarragon.  As least this was a concept I will explore another time.

I just made this with only half a pound of snap peas.  The liquid only covers about a third of the pea pods.  I'm wondering if the beans are supposed to be completely covered?  I'm thinking I should mix up some more liquid.  Marilyn
