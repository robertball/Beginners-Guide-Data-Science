VERY GOOD!!  My entire family LOVED it!!  Everyone was eating seconds.  I used cinnamon raisin bread and regular bread.  I also added a little more raisins, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also 1/2 eggnog and 1/2 milk.  I used this simple recipe for vanilla sauce...
Serve this vanilla sauce with bread pudding or any other dessert. 
INGREDIENTS:

1/2 cup sugar 
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
dash salt
PREPARATION:

In small saucepan combine sugar and cornstarch. Stir in 1 cup boiling water. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter, vanilla extract and salt; blend well. 
Thank you for such a great addition to my Christmas dinner!!!

The taste was almost just like 'Momma' use to make it. I find I had to decrease the amount of sugar to 1/2 the the recipe amount.

I tried this recipe again for Christmas. I used half eggnog and half milk. Really wish I could say how good it was, but I didn't get any. Family scarfed it up.

MAKE THIS RECIPE! I used egg nog (made with evaporated milk, cinnamon and nutmeg... among other things) and the bread pudding tasted just like my mum's. PLEASE make this, you won't regret it!

This has the consistency of yorkshire pudding and is not sweet at all. I should have known it would have no taste since the recipe didn't call for any spices such as cinnamon or cloves or nutmeg.

Very nice. I omitted the raisins and added a couple of tablespoons of leftover Solo Poppy seed filling from cookie baking, a diced apple, I used half brown sugar and half white and half a tsp of orange extract as well as a pinch of salt. Very easy recipe with little cleanup. Bread pudding is allways so versitile and it's a great use for the bread i'm allways baking. If you butter the pan and sprinkle it with a little sugar, it makes for a great crispy crust.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I substituted cinnamon raisin bread for the bread and eggnog for the milk.  I also topped it with a brandied caramel syrup for a yummy holiday dessert.

I am from New Orleans - the home of bread pudding - but had never made it before.  After reviewing several recipes, I decided to try this one.  It is fabulous to say the least.  I did make a few changes.  I added 1 tsp of high-quality cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I substituted 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/4 c. of coffee mate vanilla caramel for some of the milk.  I also added a fourth egg.  It cooked up beautifully - nice and fluffy - and was eaten by all my dinner guests.  The leftovers also taste great - even cold.  I will use this recipe again for sure.

This is a good basic bread pudding recipe.  It is a tad too sweet for my taste so I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  No raisins for me either.  The preparation is good.

FANTASTIC!! I made this for breakfast this morning. Who said bread pudding can only be earen for dessert. I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin Bread, so I didn'g add raisins. I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, as 2 cups of sugar sounded way too sweet. I beat together the milk (not hot), eggs, sugars, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg, and then poured that over the torn bread. I let that stand for 15 minutes or so and then poured it into the pan with melted butter and baked it. I just seemed easier that way. This is the best bread pudding I've ever made! Be adventurous and try it for breakfast!

My family raved over this recipie this Thanksgiving!  I did substitute the eggnog for the milk, which added a really nice flavor -- it didn't require any additional spice.  Delicious!

This recipe is awesome! I made it tonight. Instead of raisins, I had three fresh peaches I wanted to use up. So, I diced them up and added them to the mix. I also substituted 1% milk for whole milk.

I used this recipe to salvage the crusts of 3 loaves of whole wheat bread.  I had trimmed the bread crusts to make finger sandwiches & did not want to throw them out.  I used 2% lactose free milk and heart smart margarine.  Like several other readers, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I followed another reader's recipe for vanilla sauce and OMG....the outcome was wonderful!!  Using whole wheat bread was a definite plus and the sauce was out of this world.  This is a new family favorite...Awesome!!

This recipe turned out GREAT... except I did make a pretty big change. I used 2 loaves (1 lb each) of cinnamon raisin bread instead of white bread. I also used 1 cup of half and half cream as part of the 1 qt of milk and added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg.... YUMMY!! First time I've ever made it and it's the best I've ever had!

This was a good base recipe.  I made some alterations for my family: 1 c. Rapadara instead of the sugar, apples instead of raisins, 4 eggs, 1 t. cinnamon and some fresh ground nutmeg.  For economy's sake, you could probably reduce the vanilla by half and still be fine.  Recommended!

Instead of raisins, I used a cup of triple berry blend (dried cherries, blueberries, and cranberries) and cooked them in a bit of rum until the alcohol cooked off and the berries were nice and plump. So delicious! Will definitely use this recipe again!

My husband said this was the best bread pudding he ever had!  I added about 2tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup chopped apples instead of raisins, which gave it a nice texture.  The only thing I'd change is to use less sugar next time - it was too sweet for me.

I halved the recipe and used two eggs; instead of raisins, I used craisins.  It's good and my two year old was very happy to help tear the bread in pieces.

Nice recipe. I used a loaf of French brioche bread that I had in the freezer. Didn't have golden raisins so I used regular raisins. Also, I didn't use the 3 TBS of butter. I only used enough to lightly coat the pan. I did add 1 cup of chopped pecans. After it cooled down from the oven, I topped with the vanilla sauce from "Bread Pudding" from this site. The sauce was great and the pecans gave it a nice "extra".

this is a great, super simple recipe!  i like my bread pudding moist, and this was perfect.  my daughter said it "tastes like warm ice cream".  if i had to change anything I would decrease the amount of sugar and vanilla, because it was so sweet we couldn't even dare add a pudding sauce to it!

I just made this pudding and it came out great! I didn't have milk but i had "sugar cookie eggnog" so i used that,1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1 cup of sugar since i already had a sweet eggnog with sugar cookie flavor in it. it came out just perfect...not soo sweet but not bland at all since the egg nog had a yummy taste to it already. i didnt add raisins since i dont like them. Thanks for sharing!!!

My husband requested Bread Pudding for Christmas dessert and I was very happy with this choice of recipe.  As suggested for the holiday meal, I used both eggnog and milk (1/3 eggnog & 2/3 milk) and raisin bread.  All else was the same as written & it was wonderful!  I'll definately make it again!

Made it exactly to recipe except used regular raisins instead of the white ones. It was a huge success and my mother (excellent cook, harsh critic) said it was THE BEST bread pudding she has ever had. Very yummy and will make again!!!

Very good! Reminds me of the bread pudding I had as a child. I used butterbread-style white bread. I added extra vanilla (the real kind, not artificial), plus 2 tsp. each of nutmeg and fresh ground cinnamon. Yum! For a banana version, I also added banana extract; then I poured half the bread mixture in the glass dish, added a layer of sliced bananas (about 2 large bananas) and then poured the remaining mixture over it. I don't like raisins in my desserts, so I left them out. I served it with whipped cream.

Finally, a simple bread pudding recipe! I've been looking for the basic bread, egg, and milk recipe. I used pumpkin pie spice and it tasted wonderful. I really appreciate how versatile it is. I'm sure egg nog is great but it being after Christmas, the spices worked well.!

Thanks for posting this!

I took a reviewers idea of using Egg Nog instead of milk, adding a pinch of nutmeg and mace, and replaced the raisins with Craisins.  We loved it!! Now that Borden provides canned egg nog in quart cans, we don't have to wait for Christmas to enjoy this dish.

This was my first attempt at making bread pudding and the results were fantastic ! The only change I made was to substitute one cup of egg nog for the milk. It was delicious warm, but even better the next day cold. Marc, thanks so much for submitting this recipe. This one is a keeper !!!

Well, I used Wheat Bread as a substitute for white, it was a nice rich colour. I also added a bit of Cinnamon and Nutmeg it was lovely.  I will make it for the holidays coming up.  It was very easy to make, didn't take me much time to prepare. Made the house smell lovely as well, as it baked. Very good. Make it for your family! Oh, I also left out the raisons, not a big Raison fan here, but good recipe!

I have made this bread pudding many times since finding it, and my family agrees with me that this is the best bread pudding we have ever tasted. Everytime I make it, we eat the entire pudding in two days top. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Great way to use up that leftover eggnog as you wind down the Christmas season.  Used a full quart of eggnog, so I cut the sugar to 1 cup.  I also used a loaf of sweet Italian bread in place of white bread.  Served it with Cool Whip and Breyer's caramel sauce.  Delish!

Let start out by saying.."is definitely very good"... Not quite what I was looking for but close..I omitted raisins..sprinkled in some cinnamon and a smidge of nutmeg....had to have a bowl with some whipped cream on it while it was still hot..will make agsin depending on how the rest of the family likes it

Very good, but did a few things different.  I used a 2 day old fresh (what I mean by this is that it was baked locally on the day that I originally purchased it) loaf of Italian bread (it was to hard to eat on it's own so I sliced it and then broke the slices into smaller pieces).  I added two tbsp of cinnamon and used traditional raisins. Cooked it for about 25 minutes, my oven tends to cook on a higher temp. It was delicious!

Delicious! I loved the texture and the taste. The only thing I would change next time is put in less sugar (maybe 1.5 cups or 1 cup instead). Everyone at the party loved it. Also added in a sprinkling of cinnamon, but I don't think that made much of a difference...

This was AWESOME. I made it as others suggested and instead of hot milk I used a quart of hot heavy cream, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and omitted the raisins. It was a hit and I'm making it again next week.

I made it with dried cinnamon rolls and it was out of this world! Decreased the amount of sugar to compensate for the icing on the rolls and melted the butter into the milk and sugar.

This was a wonderful dish. I used a cinnamon, rasin bagel to contrast with the thick milk. It turned out wonderfully and I do recommend this as a tasty, easy dessert idea !

I have been making bread pudding for years..and it always looks like cottage cheese.  Not this time! This recipe is awsome..I cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, left out the raisins, used lots of cinnamin and used a can of cream as part of the quart of milk.  This was the best I have ever made!  Thanks

This is the best bread pudding so far.  I made 25 servings for a senior center and was told by some of the ladies in their 90's it was "just like Mama used to make".  I substituted day old french bread for the white bread.  It worked like a charm.  I served it with a light rum sauce.  UMMMM..delicious!

The bread pudding was delicous. It tasted best fresh right out of the oven, and the different textures in the dish made it fun to eat. The only downfall was that it didn't give a sauce recipe, it only said to top with whip cream but i prefer a burbon sauce with it.

This was the best. My boyfriend ate it up!! The only thing I changed was I went to Casey's gas station and bought a box of "day old donuts" and broke them up instead of bread. It's more calories, but with the different donuts, you get a lot more tastes. Mom's been doing this for years, and I can't get her recipe, so I'll pull this on out everytime!! Thanks.

yum yum.  i used less than a loaf of bread (store bought), 1/2 cup of left over condensed milk, 3 1/2 cup of milk, and 1 cup of sugar... everything else stayed the same.  oh yes, and i sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on top right before i baked it (only because i read a review that said it was too plain for him).  i also made one of the sauce that was recommended on this recipe's review, but this bread pudding could do without.  my family, and my picky nieces and nephews had more than seconds.

I made this using leftover iced cinnamon rolls.  Since the cinnamon rolls were already so sweet, I only used about 3/4 cup of sugar.  It turned out wonderfully!  Pure comfort food!

WoW!  Something so simple & tasting really good.  I just made this and had to sample it when it came out of the oven (hot but yummy) and it's everything you would have in your pantry.  I used to have this when I was a kid growing up and boy does it bring back some fond memories.  I will definately make this again & again.  Thanks!!

Excellent! Definitely add cinnamon and nutmeg, it gives it the little extra zing it needs.

Over all i have to say this is the best bread pudding weve ever had and it was so easy to make.Ive never made bread pudding before but i tell ya theres nothing to it. Even my 10 year old helped.My husband loved it he said its the best hes ever tasted.I did modify a little according to some of the reviews.I added cinnamon for that holiday taste and i didnt use the golden raisins i used the regular raisins.I also put in a little more vanilla for taste and instead of 2 cups of sugar i used 1 and a 1/2 cups.Over all ill be making this for years to come.Not to mention my husband took the bread to work he said everyone was raving about it and now there always harrasing him for me to make more.Thanks for sharing this recipe ill always use it for years to come.

I followed the basic recipe except I made a few changes. I used a 26.4 ounce pumpkin panettone that I cut up and let dry out all day and added about 2 teaspoons of pie spice to the sugar mixture and 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the raisins. I put this into 2 8x8 pans so I have 1 for the family on Thanksgiving and 1 for my family after. I did follow the baking instructions and they came out perfectly.

DELICIOUS!  I was a huge hit at our church dinner!  I skipped the raisins, used  half and half instead of milk, added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and a teaspoon cinnamon. I mixed the eggs, half and half, sugar and spices together and poured over the bread.  I served with a simple butterscotch sauce made with brown sugar, butter, milk, and corn syrup. Will definitely make it again!

Great to find more recipes that give a mass of bread instead of "slices."  This recipe needs spices - I found that 1 T. true cinnamon and 1 t. fresh ground nutmeg gives it enough.  Also, you can cut the sugar down to 1 c. and it is still plenty.

A good basic bread pudding recipe.  I used less sugar as per other folks comments but felt it needed the sugar or add fruit. Great with maple syrup and cool whip on top.

Was delicious!  I tweaked it by using brown sugar instead of white and melted some brown sugar with butter and poured that on top to make a nice glaze.

This was perfect. I added almonds and sliced bananas. The kids were not crazy about it, but Mike and I both loved it and thought it would be great with chocolate on top.  I can see many variations of this in my future..

It was very good. I toasted the bread before cutting it into pieces and added a few ingredients- cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and 1/8 cup packed brown sugar. I cooked it covered in in a water bath about 35 minutes longer than recommended. Gently stir when pudding begins to set (just enough to mix a bit) before serving. Serve with whip cream or ice cream.

Good recipe.  I ran out of Vanilla extract at 1.5 tbsp and substituted the last 0.5 with almond extract.  Also sprinkled brown sugar on top before cooking.  Delish!

I followed the recipe with just a few suggestions incorporated. I did cut back on the sugar. Used a cup of white and 1/4 of brown. BUT also added about 1 1/2 cups of caramel macchiato creamer, 1 1/2 cups of half and half and the balance of the quart of milk (went a little over a quart) with skim milk. Spiced it up with approximately a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg. Didn't heat the milk but also took the suggestion of adding all the liquids, sugar, eggs and spices and whisked together. Poured over the bread pieces and let sit for about 15 min before putting in the pan and baking. As we like to say, it turned out so good it is worthy of the next month of church potlucks.

I make this all the time, with whatever bread I happen to have leftover, and its always delicious.  I took the other reviews into consideration and I always make it with half the sugar indicated.  Sometimes I will replace the raisins with cinnamon, as I don't generally keep raisins on hand.  I will make this recipe for myself and cut it down to 1/3 the original recipe, using about 5 - 6 slices of bread and a small shallow baking pan.  This is a really great base recipe that is easy to tweak if you want, but delicious as is.

Fabulous!  This was delicious and we all loved it.  I used mostly eggnog (about a 2/3 ratio) and 1% milk.  I also added a bit of nutmeg before baking.

This is incredible!  I made it with cinnamon raisin bread and eggnog in place of the milk.  I didn't add any additional spices, but I did add some Craisins.  I also put the vanilla sauce recipe from the #1 most helpful review over the pudding once it was cooked.  I added 3 TBSP Meyer's dark rum to the vanilla sauce and I think it really added to the flavor.  What a great recipe!  Thank you to all for the recipe and modification ideas!

I  really like this recipe. It has a good taste, good presentation. However I needed to add a little more milk so that it would be more moist. All around, it is tasty.

came out terrific! I also noticed it took much longer than 40 minutes for mine to bake. It actually baked closer to 50 minutes possibly longer. Very easy and very tasty.

this was really good, however I put it in a 9x13 pan and took a lot longer to bake.  next time I will use a jelly roll pan to even it out more.

Wonderful! Lovely texture. Easy to make. I used 12 slices of Oroweat Country White bread. My oven must be on the cool side because I had to cook it much longer than 40 minutes. Next time I'll set my oven to 375 degrees.

I had Portguese Sweet Bread left over from Easter.  I cut back on sugar to one cup, because of the sweetness of the bread.  It was extremely good.  Simple and Yummy.  Not too eggy.  The Vanilla sauce took it over the top.  9x13 pan gone in 20 minutes. Thanks for sharing.

Very good..everyone loved it!  I used regular raisins instead of golden and I added 1tsp of each nutmeg and cinnamon like one other person said.  I also made the vanilla sauce to go with it...yum!  It was all gone before it cooled!

This was too sweet for my taste. A little less sugar may be in order. Like others have suggested, one and a half cups would be better. I'd even consider trying just 1 cup of sugar, especially if you are going to serve it with a sauce anyway.

A really good recipe.

I used two baguettes and substituted choc chips for the raisins.

Next time  I'll only use 1.5 cups of sugar (and that still may be too much!)

I've never had bread pudding which means i've never made it. I tried it for the first time for my husband (it's his favorite) and it was really good. I used heavy cream because there was no milk in my house (snowing) and it was perfect. And he loved it so I'm probably going to be making it more!! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! One of my favorite recipes. I use Italian bread and Sunmaid Jumbo raisins (they're plump and juicy and have a mix of different raisins) instead of golden raisins and spice with cinnamon, cardamom and mace (added with the milk) and sprinkle very lightly with nutmeg before baking. Great warm, good cold too.

This was nice. I used some Italian boule bread that I had left over and this dessert came out very good. Nice and crispy around the edges and the golden raisins was a nice sweet addition. My husband and I both liked this with a bit of whipped cream on top.

Excellent! Perfect consistency, perfect taste, incredibly easy. I also tried the vanilla sauce recipe given in the reviews. Also very tasty. I didn't measure the raisins. I just added until it looked like enough for my taste.

This is a good Recipe but it's not what I thought it wood be in taste. It was not as sweet as I hoped it will be. I think putting some melted frosting drizling over the top of it will be very good and adding a hint of Cinnamon to it!
