I used this brioche recipe to make a recipe from the food network show Barefoot Contessa called Summer Pudding.  I made the brioche twice and found that I preferred using a little more sugar and 2 teaspoons of yeast.  For the summer pudding, I made a syrup with a couple packages of fresh frozen mixed berries, water, corn starch and brandy extract, then layered it with slices of de-crusted brioche, weighted it and set it overnight.  The results were spectacular!  I served this at my neice's baby blessing reception to rave reviews.  Since the majority of the moisture in the dough comes from fat, the brioche makes the pudding rich and utterly delicious.  I wouldn't recommend eating brioche plain, but in a dessert or with a stew, amazing!  Great job, Linda!

This is a great recipe to mix in breadmaker and then braid by hand. The extra dry yeast definitely helps and a teaspoon of salt also improves the balance.

As the recipe stands, I'd give it 4 stars, but with the alterations suggested by other reviewers, it ws a 5. As suggested, I increased the yeast, sugar (nearly doubled,) and added a pinch more salt. The center of the braid was a bit doughy when baked per the diretions, but I had some difficulty rolling the strips so may have made them too thick (the braid was about 14" long). Delicious served with pulled pork on top. The slightly sweet bread compliments the smokey, BBQ flavor of the pork.

Great recipe for Breadmaker, makes brioche soooo easy. I did increase the Yeast slightly and added very finely grated Lemon Zest. Makes a wonderful Tea Bread!

If your dough seems dry, don't be afraid to hydrate with a little extra water, it wont hurt the dough.    Also, Make sure to let the dough rise once for about an hour before shaping it.  I would recommend folding the dough at 30 minutes to degas the dough and distribute heat evenly.  To fold, turn the dough out onto a floured table and bring the left side two thirds across the dough giving it a slight stretch and patting to down.  Next, bring the right side all the way to the edge of the left side (think letter fold), again giving the dough a slight tug as you bring it across.  Repeat the same fold from top to bottom. Return the dough to the mixing bowl and let sit for remaining 30 minutes.  When egg washing. I would not add water to the whites.  This will only dilute your wash mixture and you will not get as pretty of a shine.  When baking, you want the final crust color to be more brown then golden.  Try baking at a bit higher of a temperature (375) The dough will start to take on a beautiful rusted color.  However, the inside will still be a delicious pale golden.     a variation I like to do with this dough is roll it out flat, spread marscapone cheese that has been mixed with a little sugar and citrus flavoring over the center third, then layer strawberries and blueberries on top.  fold the outer two thirds over the center.  brush with whites and sprinkle with sparkling or cane sugar and bake.

FANTASTIC!!!!  I've been looking for this exact dough recipe for years!!  And finally....success!!  What a wonderfully tender dough!  I used this dough to make sticky buns and they were by far the best homemade sticky buns I have ever eaten.  Even my husband says that they rival those you can find in a great bakery.  I look forward to making this dough plain to make breakfast rolls that cream cheese & jam can be spread on.  Very versitile and yummy!!  You won't be disapointed!!  The bread machine makes this especially easy to prepare!

Please note first... I increased yeast to 2 tsps and added 1 tsp of salt.  That said! What a fabulous recipe! I decided to make sticky buns out of it and they rock! After forming them, I let them rise covered in plastic for 2 hours before baking and they came out light, tender and fluffy.  Thank you Linda for your inspiration. :)

WOW! Very nice bread! Made the changes as mentioned in the other reviews IE 1t of salt, 2t's of active dry yeast, almost double the sugar, and did the second rise after I braided the loaves (doubled the recipe and made two huge loaves!). Took them to a French themed cooking club dinner last night and all the bread was gone in no time! For the 2 loaves I used 3/4c of sugar and it was right on for me. A big yes for adding salt also. I can't imagine this with out salt! I let the loaves proof for about 30 minutes and had fantastic oven spring! Only problem I had was my fault. I didn't work the dough out to a long enough length nor fast enough and the loaf came out very wide and the braids didn't stick real good during the bake an thus fell apart once in a while when the bread was cut. No big deal as it made it a little easier to put on the your plate. This is a rich recipe and will make it again. I think I'm going to make "Clone of Cinnabon" from this site with this dough next week! Can't have too many "fat pills" in the house! HELP ME!!!

Loved this recipe!
instead of making a challah like loaf, i made little rolls shaped like traditional brioche.  To do this, i set aside a sixth of the dough.  The rest of the dough i divided into 12 pieces, rolled into balls, and then put in a cupcake/muffin pan.    I split the sectioned dough into 12 pieces, rolling each of the pieces into a small ball.  I then made an indent on top of the rolls and put a small ball in each.  I baked these 17 minutes instead of 20 and they came out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I baked this bread for my family this Christmas, after they had been to France.  A local in France had told them that "if you have ham, you must have brioche".  This recipe, according to them, was just like the bread they ate there.  I used the machine for the whole process by choosing the "Basic" setting on my machine and a "Medium" crust darkness.  Very rich and lovely bread!

I added an extra egg and make two small braided loaves with this. The second loaf didn't get eaten so I made mushroom dressing with it. Now that was amazing! I will have to make this bread just to have that dressing again. Thanks for the recipe!

This came out AMAZING and was so easy because I cooked it from start to finish in the bread machine with additional yeast. I was afraid the recipe might be too big so I cut it to 10 servings using 1 1/2 tsp yeast. The flavor and texture is wonderful and will make awesome french toast in the morning. :)

I made this following the recipe exactly and after having never made brioche before.  The recipe doesn't mention that you need to let it rise for a couple of hours and therefore, my brioche was a total disaster.

It seems there is an error in the list of ingredients.  I am wondering if the 1/2 tsp yeast was meant to be 1/2 tsp salt and the amt of yeast should be about 2 tsp or one packet.

This bread is the one I make all the time now. I like it a little sweeter, so I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and use 1 full packet of active dry yeast. This recipe makes a VERY large loaf, so I just cut the dough in half and then make two braided loaves from it. Excellent brioche. You must try it.

This turned out very heavy and didn't raise properly. I used new yeast and followed the directions.
It was nothing like the brioche we purchased on a regular basis while living in England.

This came out flat as a pancake. I'm not sure what the problem is? Too little yeast? All-purpose flour instead of bread flour? How are people getting this recipe to work?

Easy to make and very, very good.  I needed it to make a dessert that called for brioche (and where does one find that?).  Of the recipes I found on here, this one had the best sounding reviews and I must concur with them.  Great with jam, great with butter (not that you need it), and great as a meal side.  Great the second, third and fourth days, too.

This turned out beautifully.  I used 1/2 bread flour because I ran out of APF, and unsalted butter, so it could have used more salt.  Which basically means it will be better the next time and it was pretty darn good already with the subs.

I subbed wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour and increased the yeast to 2tsp as others ad suggested and it came out great. Also added extra rise time after forming.

I really liked this as did my family.  I read the reviews and decided to use 1 pkg of yeast, tsp of salt and doubled the sugar.  I then made it into one big loaf.  Here is where I ran into problems (my own).  I really should have divided the dough into two loaves because I had a HUGE loaf of bread.  I baked it for a total of 35 minutes having covered it with foil after 20.  I also used my kitchenaid to mix this.  Again, very good and I will make it again!

I made this recipe with the alterations others suggested, but think this recipe would be good with less sugar and yeast as well.   It depends on whether you like your brioche sweet or eggy. Personally, I like it sweet enough to just eat, so the alterations worked well for me.

I also increased the yeast to 2 tsp. This bread works out wonderfully in a bread machine. Mine is an older Breadman. It is very soft and just a lovely. The dough is easy to work with and easy to braid. Thanks to whomever posted it.

This turned out really good.  I actually shaped it into buns.   I'm happy to find another good one for the bread machine.

I made this especially to use in french toast.  My loaves didn't rise well.  I did use the bread machine.  The taste was good, so i'm going to try again.

Called for too much butter- when I took the dough out of the breadmaker it was dripping with butter. I soaked up the excess and followed the rest of the recipe and it wasnt a total waste of ingredients but it didnt taste like authentic brioche.

YUM!!! This was tender, buttery, delicious! I'm a total novice, and it was easy to make. I plan to give these out for Christmas presents along with some special preserves. I've been using this site for years, and this is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe. I HAD to! It's awesome!!!! I can't wait until tomorrow, when I can use it for french toast. Thanks SO much for the great recipe!

Fabulous! Added 2tsp yeast and double the sugar as others suggested. Let rise over an hour before putting in oven. I put this in a tall baking dish which I use for casseroles to cook. If you do this, put a pan on rack above and below to prevent burning. (more info on this Beautiful crusty topped brioche with perfect center. Not too sweet at all. I will make this again and again.

So definitely needs 2 tbsp of yeast. It was the 2nd time making it that I discovered this from the other peoples reviews. Also make sure you use a larger bread pan. I didn’t realize how much it would make.

Very easy recipe with bread machine. I also followed the suggestion to do 2 t yeast, 1 t salt and 1/3 cup of sugar. I think more sugar would have been ok. I only use egg white without eater for coating and bake at slightly higher temperature 375 for 17 min.  I did two proofs and shaped them into the traditional brioche shape before baking them in a regular muffins tin. The second proof took a while 1.5-2hr but they grew even more when I started baking them and turned out beautiful.

Added 1/4 tsp more  yeast...let it rise for 2 hrs. Yes it was a bit oily before baking, but it is brioche...and the recipe is full of butter. I thought it turned out very well for being made in my bread machine. Great flavor, too. No added salt. Just used salted butter..

Use egg yolks only and I use at least 4 to 5. it will make your bread more tender.  You can make this a Panettone by adding raisins, currant or other fruit.  Also, adding saffron water will add a nice rich yellow tinge to your brioche or Panettone.

I followed the recipe and made the bread today. I agree with most of the reviewers that this recipe needs a lot of twists: definitely more yeast, more sugar and please don't forget to add some salt. My bread turned out lovely but tasted quite bland. I don't recommend it.

I tried this recipe for brioche and followed the recipe.
  
  With only half a teaspoon of yeast and no salt, it was a disappointment
  Too dense and flat tasting with no salt.
  I make breads regularly and followed this recipe with no changes.

Made this bread today. I started out in the bread machine I've had for 10 years, was still sealed in box. Let it do all the work, with the changes described about adding more sugar and yeast and it came out perfect. So happy right now.

Lovely the bread indeed.  Used 2 teaspoons of dry yeast and doubled the amount of water (1/3 x 2) mentioned in the recipe. Also put 1/2 a cup of castor sugar.  It came out lovely and the taste is to die for.
Thankyou!!!

This was an awesome hit at New Years. I made this bread, then my husband made french toast out of it.  WOW! I received a bread machine as a gift and there were very few recipes listed so I went on line to find some.  This is a great website and I have not found a bad recipe yet!
