I thought potatoes in crab cakes would be an interesting twist, but they didn't turn out to be a great choice.  The potatoes overpowered the crab and gave the cakes a mushy, mealy texture, but the spices had good flavor.  The lemon aioli was just not good.

It was delicious! Being a FT working mom, I had to make it quickly and left out the aioli sauce. Light, flaky and just the right amount of everything. I wouldn't change a thing.
