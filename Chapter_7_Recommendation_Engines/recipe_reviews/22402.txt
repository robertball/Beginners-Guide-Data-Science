Awesome. My picky hubby and 6 year old loved it. I changed a few things. For a serving of four: 4 boneless chops, 1 cup fresh cranberries, 3 T sugar, 1/2 t salt, 1/8 t pepper, 1/8 t pumpkin pie spice,1/8 cup water and 1/8 cup oj. cooked as directed, great and easy dish

Quite tasty.  Use thin chops though.  I also didn't have fresh or frozen berries, so I used the canned whole berry cranberry sauce and omitted the sugar.  I would recommend putting in half a large onion, it adds a little oompf.  As a twist, substitute some frozen or canned tart cherries and some herbes de provence(and a little cornstarch to thicken it at the end)

Amazing! Devine! We used orange juice instead of sugar, and added a hot pepper to give it some kick...will definitely make this again (and it's sooo pretty; perfect for a dinner party!)

This was delicious!!! I followed others' lead and used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce, put in half the sugar and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. I misread the pepper and put in 1 full tsp instead of 1/4 but it was actually good - gave it a kick. The meat was tender and moist, easy to make, perfect for a Friday night dinner. WIll DEFINITELY make this again.

I've been making this recipe AS IS over two years now and we realize how much we love it every single time.  The chops are tender and very juicy.  We didn't need a knife.  Awesome dish, PLEASE give it a whirl.  UPDATE: May 2010 / We've been decreasing the amount of white sugar and adding a little brown instead.  Regardless, these are never not a hit.  With anyone.

I wasn't so sure if my family would like this, but I had all the ingredients on hand so I gave it a try.  I was very pleasantly surprised by how good (and easy) it was!  It is nice to have another use for fresh cranberries besides cranberry sauce.

This was delicious. I cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup based on other reader reviews and used Splenda to reduce calories. The chops were moist and tender and the cranberry sauce was really tasty. I served with brown rice and green beans with almonds. My daughter (usually not a big meat eater) asked for seconds.

This was great and moist as is. The only thing I changed was to cook it in the crock pot on high for 4 hours instead of on the stove.

This was yummy.  I added a can of mandarin oranges, juice and all.  Some salt, some pepper.  I used cornstarch to thicken it, but it almost didn't need it.  I decided to have a backup plan, in case people didn't like it, so I cooked a couple chops just with shake and bake.

To taste on it's own the sauce was a little weird, so I had the shake and bake chops on the ready.  But the sauce with the meat was fantastic!  We served it like a dipping sauce.

So what happened with the backup chops?  With the sauce, they were EVEN BETTER than the simmered chops!!  Next time, I'll just make the sauce to serve with them.

Fabulous!  My husband is *very* picky - came into the kitchen looking warily at the cranberries - and he LOVED these! My daughter did too - ate two of them!  Changed nothing - wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!

Yummy!!!  I didn't have fresh cranberries, so used a can of whole cranberry sauce with only 1/2 cup sugar.  I also added 1/2 a chopped onion for some additional flavor.  I did not need to add any water as the recipe stated as the chops made their own liquid.  As a matter of fact, I had to add a bit of flour to thicken the sauce into a gravy consistency.   This was delicious!

NOM! I did add the onions as someone suggested. Also, we don't really love sweet stuff so I added a little sugar at a time. It was so tart and yummy with the pork. Super tender. Oh and instead of water I added pineapple orange juice.

Great recipe!  I made this for dinner last night for my wife.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used only 2 boneless, thick cut pork loin chops, and I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  The recipe turned out great.  I finished the meal with brown rice (spooned some of the reduced cranberry sauce over the rice) and mixed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  Fully satisfying dinner.  Thanks for thsi recipe.  We will be serving it often.

I am speechless! My family devoured this! I used 1 can of cranberry sauce (gellied) since it was all I had. I put about half of the sugar it called for, and I did add onion. It has a "sweet and sour" type flavor to it. I did thicken the sauce and served this over jasmine rice. Definitely a keeper! At least worth a try! And soooo simple.

Great recipe! I actually used some of my leftover cranberry sauce and some fresh cranberries to make this. It turned out very moist and tender! My boyfriend thought the cranberry flavor was a bit strong but I liked it! yum!

Very good! I love using cranberries in savory dishes, especially with pork. I added half a chopped onion on the advice of another reviewer and used chicken broth instead of water. I also added some dried herb mix (tarragon, rosemary, thyme) and fresh parsley towards the end of cooking. I'll make this one again..would be great for guests, it's such a rich deep color that looks very impressive on a white plate. Had this with brown rice and sauteed green beans. Great!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I did tweak it a little.  I omitted the white sugar and added two cups of chopped apples, a cup or so of apple juice, a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, about a table spoon of brown sugar Splenda, and I copied someone else with a little pumpkin pie spice.  I thought it turned out great.  I didn't make a sauce out of the left over juice, but I very well could have (just spooned it onto our plates).  My picky daughter loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for something different to do with pork chops and this was a very good choice.  Made some changes - using chicken broth instead of water, canned whole cranberry sauce (couldn't find fresh or frozen) and adding a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Then, I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and poured it over the finished chops.  Look really nice and tasted good.

I added some cinnamon and nutmeg, and this was amazing. I had friends over and served it with stuffing, corn, biscuits, and a bottle of German Riesling wine. You couldn't have asked for a better meal!

Very nice! What a wonderfully different way to make pork chops! As others had suggested, I kept my sugar on the light side, as I didn't want it too sweet. Had it and some stir fried kale and a sweet potato on the side - yummy!!

We really did not like this.  The pork tasted exceptionally strong, so I wonder if there was something wrong with our pork chops.  By itself, the cranberry sauce that the pork simmered in was delicious.  I like the taste of cherry or pineapple with pork a lot better.

This is one of my fiancé’s new favorite recipes.  He’s not a picky eater by any means (thank goodness!), but few recipes make it onto his “favorites” list.  This is one of them though!  For six chops, I used frozen cranberries; approximately 1/2 c. sugar; 1/2 t. pepper; added dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; and added close to 1/3 of a diced yellow onion.  I highly recommend adding the spices; they really help complete the dish.  Also, to turn the juices into more of a sauce, I added cornstarch near the end of cooking.  Easy and elegant dish!

I altered the recipe by using dried cranberries which I had on hand: they were sweetened already so I omitted the sugar and used orange juice in addition to the water. My son, who is the food critic in the house, loved them: tender, moist, sweet and tart.

My son & I absolutely loved this recipe..hubby not so crazy about cranberries..but he still liked it!!  We did use canned cranberries, cut the sugar, added a splash of orange juice & thickened w/ some cornstarch.  Will make again!! :-)

This was a very good recipe although it came out quite sweet, even after cutting the sugar down to 1/4 of a cup.  My recommendation is if you use canned cranberries (as I did, since it's what I had on hand) don't add sugar at all.  Altogether though it was a very flavorful recipe which I will make again.  Another tip, rub the 'chops with seasonings before you brown them...it added a lot of flavor!

I always have the same problem with these recipes, my pork is always tough - any suggestions?  I don't think it is the recipe's fault it is clearly my execution.  It was very tasty - I used orange juice as a sweetner instead of white sugar just because I prefer to avoid white sugar when I can.  The sauce was outstanding.  I could only find dried cranberries as well and was surprised at how much flavor they produced.

Fun recipe.  I cut down on the sugar; only added 2/3 cup.  I served with brown/red rice, and next time, I would cook the rice in chicken broth so there's more sweet/salty going on.  I found it a little too sweet.  But I will probably make it again.  I used frozen cranberries, defrosted a few minutes in the microwave first, but that might not have been necessary.

This was definately a new way to make pork chops for me... but it is definately one I will make again... I ended up adding quite a bit of water to them as it kept cooking down... everyone loved these... suprisingly great combination!!

These were just okay, to me, although my boyfriend seemed to enjoy them. I didn't have a pan big enough to cook all 6 porkchops, so I ended up reducing the sauce by simmering for a half-hour and then pouring it over the already fried chops and baking for another 1/2 hour. Eh. There was a lot of jucie still and the cranberries were rather... just...eh.

Delicious!!! My husband rated it one of his top ten favorite meals of all time.  As per other reviews I used thin cut chops, a can of whole cranberry sauce and reduced the sugar by half.  I will definitely be making these again.

awesome! Will make regularly. I used fresh cranberries, cooked for 40 minutes and added a little extra bit of water at the end (as suggested in recipe). Pork was cooked just right. Used a non-stick frying pan. Served with steamed veg and a baked potato and my boyfriend and I were both really happy with this meal! Thanks!

I had some leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving to use up so I tried this recipe with some thinly sliced pork loin chops.  So Good!!!  I added half an onion to the mix of leftover home made cranberry sauce. It was tart and sweet and Delicious!

This was a Great meal. I used whole cranberry sauce instead. So, I didn't added any sugar, I also used less water & mined some garlic to the recipe. The sauce was great. Will Make this again. Thanks

Awesome recipe! The meat was tender and tasty and had great flavor. All 3 of my kids are picky eaters and my husband thinks all porkchops are dry.  They all loved it! I followed the recipe as it was written, except that I added some cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.

This was a tasty recipe. I used canned whole cranberries and no sugar. The pork chops were moist and I thickened the juice with cornstarch for a thicker sauce. The pork was sort of bland but the sauce made up for it.  It was really easy!

This recipe was FANTASTIC.  I don't cook for myself regularly and it was DELICIOUS and I didn't mess anything up -its that easy!  I couldn't fine simply cranberries, but I did find a frozen cranberry sauce with oranges, I did as others suggested and added 1/2 and onion and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Divine.

Wow, these were great!!  I used dried cranberries (which I probably wouldn't do again) and cut down on the sugar, and it was good - just a little too sweet.  Next time, I'll look harder for frozen ones.  Excellent recipe.

I made it with pork tenderloin and it was awesome. I used less sugar, I don’t like it overly sweet. 1/2 cap was perfect and also followed someone else advice and used half an onion. I will definitely make this again. Might try it with chicken

I have made this with mostly dried sweetened cranberries because I couldn’t find fresh or frozen. When I use dried I don’t add sugar and it’s perfect. I have made this with a whole cut up chicken with the same 5 star results! I also sub the water for white wine whenever I have an open bottle. I cook it in the instant pot on high pressure for 3 mins with natural release.

I had 4 pork steaks from a pig that was free range, so the meat is leaner than farmed, and I was worried about them drying out. They turned out DELICIOUS!!!

I had a 12 oz bag of fresh cranberries that I used and the taste is amazing. I love the tang of the cranberries, cut slightly with the sugar so it wasn't overwhelming or bitter. I used slightly less sugar as well.

The pork was so tender! You could pull the meat easily from the bone. I am definitely making this again. And again. And again!

We have a new staple in our 'pork' repertoire! The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, instead of 3/4 cup of white. The leftovers were equally tasty the second night.

Delicious. Changed some things though. Added a sliced onion near the end of browning the chops. Only made 2 chops but made the recipe amounts for the sauce. Used the juice from 3 clementines instead of adding water. Used less salt and around 1/2 the sugar. Served the sauce over the chops as well as a grain/rice blend. Will definitely make again.

Really great recipe, whole family liked it.
I used 1/2 cup sugar rather than 3/4 cup. It was very tasty and it looks great on a plate, presentation very appealing

This is really good, and very pretty!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the amount of sugar in it- I made 2 very small chops and used 1/2 of the amount of sauce (to make sure we had enough cranberries to put on the rice and chops, and we thought that was just the right amount of sauce).  I did cut the sugar by a little because we don't care for overly sweet dishes, but it was still very sweet, so next time  I'll try even less amd possibly add some orange rind.   I'm tossing some cranberries  in the freezer so we can have this all winter, it really is good.

Loved this!  Of course I altered it just a bit.  I only had dried cranberries, so I substituted them for fresh.   Then I added about 1/2 can of crushed pineapple, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and onion like some others did.  I also used about 1/4 cup raw honey in place of the sugar and for the last 15 minutes put in 1/2 cup dry white wine and a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken up the gravy.

I had a couple of frozen past-their-prime pork chops and wanted a recipe that might salvage them. This was the one. They were fantastic, tender and the sauce was great. Like others suggested, i added some cinnamon, and halved the quantities for the sauce ingredients. i will definitely make this one again. Delicious, not too sweet, hard to go wrong.

I'd probably give it a few more stars if I made it slightly different. I used cherries instead of cranberries (hubbys preference) and I wish I would've baked them in the oven as opposed to boiling. The texture was just odd.

My pork chops came out rather dry and didn't have as much flavor as I would have expected.  They were okay if you drizzled the juices over them.  I would go with what another reviewer said and use thin cut chops.   The "sauce" came out more brown than red--didn't look anything like the pictures.

I had previously frozen fresh cranberries, so this recipe caught my eye as a way to use some of them.  I made half of the sauce for two large bone-in pork chops.  I read quite a few of the reviews and decided to do the following:  I used 1 cup of cranberries, about 1/3 cup chopped onions, 4 T. sugar, 4 T. water, and 2 T. orange juice.  I sautéed the onions and set them aside.  I seasoned the chops and browned them and added the rest of the ingredients.  Since my chops were so large, I slowly simmered this for an hour and 15 minutes.  I then removed the chops to a warm oven to work on the sauce.  There was way too much liquid in my cranberry sauce, so I cranked up the heat to boil off the excess.  In a few minutes I had a nice, thick cranberry sauce and had no need to thicken it further.  Hubs really liked this, but I wasn’t as impressed.  I thought the cranberry sauce needed more depth.  The orange juice I added was barely detectable, so if I were to make this again, I might use all orange juice and no water.

Made this for my parents arrival.  This would be a 5 star if we had known (or realized) that using frozen cranberries would increase the liquid as much as it did.  

In the future, if I used frozen cranberries I'd use 1/2 the suggested water to compensate for the frozen liquid.  

We thickened with a roux of cornstarch and the sauce and the taste was excellent!

Absolutely delish!!!  I was nervous due to some of the negative reviews but it came out wonderful.  Tender, not dry.  I did use boneless chops.  I used less white sugar than it called for as well.  I do think I will try to sub out the white sugar next time, just bc I am not a fan of  sugar.  Will def be making again.

I've made this 3 times now, but with 3 pork chops so I halved the recipe. I think it tastes great, however, every time the chops come out dry. I've tried cooking for less time, but the sauce needs that extra time to thicken. I've never run low on the water, there is always plenty.

Used this recipe as a base for pork steak which was what I had on hand.  I used a can of whole cranberry sauce, two fresh squeezed oranges, a little brown sugar, some shakes of onion flakes and thickened it a little with orange juice and cornstarch.  I only had to cook for 20 minutes as the pork steak was thinner than chops.  I served it with frozen peas, jasmine rice with a little of the cranberry sauce drizzled on the rice.  A definite keeper!  Pretty on the plate, too!

Made it with Splenda in place of sugar.  Had about a quarter cup of leftover sauteed onions, garlic, and red bell pepper and threw that in just for fun.  Used fresh cranberries.  It was delicious.

Turned out pretty good. I seasoned the chops with a little all purpose seasoning just to bring out some extra flavor. I think I'll add a little less sugar next time i make this.

This is a fantastic recipe. I doubled the sauce, used chicken broth instead of water, and added a little bit of garlic. This has a wonderful sweet and tangy flavor that we really enjoyed. We served it with a lemon basil rice. Yum!

I cut the sugar down to a half cup as suggested by others and used about 1/2 cup of apple cranberry juice and 1/2 cup water for the sauce. I also threw in about 1/2 cup of sliced apple. It turned out really well, and it was a lot more tender than I had anticipated.

Loved it. Used bone in pork chops. Made following changes per suggestions of other reviews: 2 1/4 cup canned whole cranberries, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tbs brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 chopped med size onion. Kept everything else the same. Served with stuffing and baked asparagus. Was a hit with picky husband. Will definitely make again.

Easy to make and tastes great. I made a few changes based on other comments: I didn't use any water, just the liquid left over from browning the chops. I only used half the white sugar, plus about 1/2 a tablespoon of brown sugar. I added some orange juice and orange zest, and a little bit of ginger and red pepper flakes. I also added some kecap manis, which is a thick Indonesian sweet soy sauce available in Asian markets. Soy sauce would work well, too. Turned out great. I served it with mashed potatoes, which tasted good with the cranberry sauce.

Came out good...the sauce came out nice although it didn't soak into the pork chop as much as I would have liked...maybe a marinade in it would help.

Very tasty. I cut the portions down to serve 2. I added about 1/4 cup orange juice for the water but next time I would add only 1/8 cup to start. I will make this again. The pork chops did not dry out like they do with some long cooking.

Made this Thurs and was GREAT! Used fresh cranberries, half a small can of unsweetened orange juice and 4 packs of splenda. Added half cup of frozen onions, skipped the water altogether and used chicken broth. Very moist and sauce was delicious! Cranberries are so good for you and this was a great way to use them and NOT add a lot of bad stuff!

My husband was surprised at how good the cranberry sauce was!  We will make this again!  You can't beat it for being easy, quick and delicious, not to mention pretty!

This was a great recipe.  I threw some green beens in the pan and served it with stuffing on the side.

I really enjoyed the varied flavors that came out of this (really good around the holidays) and how juicy the chops were. I enjoyed it more than my boyfriend, but I LOVED it.

Delectable, as well as beautiful with fresh cranberries. I'm sending this recipe to friends.

Wow! My husband (who never cooks) made these for me for a surprise dinner, and he said they were very, very easy to make. They turned out SO well, and the recipe doesn't need a thing changed. He served it with fresh asparagus and boiled red potatoes, and it was perfect. I would suggest using a high-quality pork chop though.

Very yummy, but I cheated. I had two cans of cranberry sauce and used those for 8 chops and it was great. Even the children loved it.

Really good - I added a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up.

We liked the taste of this dish, we added chicken oxo for taste. 
I gave it 4 stars because it was a little tough, Next time I will simmer it slower at a lower heat.

The pork chops did not absorb much of the flavor of the sauce. As a whole it smelled delicous, but the taste did not hold up to the smell.

This recipe was a big hit with my family. I did not use any sugar since I used canned cranberries and I also rubbed the chops with pork rub. Very tastey and super easy.

The store didn't carry cranberries, so I followed another reviewers suggestion and used raspberries and less sugar.  They were great!  My fiance and I loved them.

It was okay, but I really don't think I'll make it again.  The cranberries cooked down more than I thought and it was too sweet.  Might help to add lemon or orange zest.
