I used navy pea beans instead of the mung beans.  I fried them on a non-stick griddle without oil.  These are very tasty; it's a great recipe!  Thanks!

Yum, yum, yum, yum.  Adhering to the recipe, to the letter, makes some of the tastiest rotti I've ever had.  Deliciously authentic! Asafoetida is a ground up root that smells awful but kind of tastes oniony when cooked.  It helps keep you from tooting, which is a good thing, considering how bean heavy these rotti are.  It's super easy to find at any Indian or Middle Eastern market.  I've even found it at East Asian markets.  It's considered very, very good for you and has many uses in traditional medicine.  You can make these without it, but try not to if you don't have to.  It's worth the trip to the grocery store.

More people should try and rate this recipe! My kids and I made these today, and we gobbled them up right away. We tried to stick to the recipe, but we quickly saut√©ed the jalepenos and onions (a combo which I subbed in for green chiles) first before adding to the dough. Didn't know what asafoetida powder was, so we skipped that. Used cumin powder instead of seed, and left out the cilantro. Added fresh pepper and sea salt to the dough. Left out the coconut. Fried these things in butter. Just trying to show that you can make these and have them taste delicious even without some of the more exotic ingredients like asafoetida and coconut.
