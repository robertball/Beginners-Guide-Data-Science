Delicious, of course!  One can simply it though by making the cream sauce and just quickly "melting" already chopped spinach right in the sauce.  I add vodka and a bit of chicken stock to minced shallots saut√©ed in butter and reduce by half, then add the cream with bit of lemon juice and zest.  Add the spinach and let cook down and serve with grated cheese.

My favorite creamed spinach recipe to date. I used a 10oz box of frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh - just microwaved it until it was room temp, drained the liquid and added it to the cream. Excellent!

Very, very good!  A previous reviewer suggested making the sauce as instructed then just putting the fresh spinach in it  to wilt. What a great timesaving idea, thank you! I also tore my larger spinach leaves into about two or three pieces before putting them into the sauce so that once they cooked down, it was done. (I tore the leaves and removed any long stems the day before my dinner--a tedious and time consuming task depending on how much you're making!) I increased this recipe and used five 9-oz. bags of fresh spinach as a side dish for six people and there  was literally no leftovers.  Thanks so much for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!

Best creamed spinach I ever had, and I love creamed spinach! It actually TASTED like spinach, novel idea :) Very easy to make and for the first time, I would change nothing in a recipe. Well I correct that - I would double it as it wasn't enough! But seriously, this is enough to barely serve 4. Everyone wanted more but just not enough. Enjoy!

I used a thawed 10 oz. box of frozen spinach in place of the fresh spinach.  Next time, I will increase the nutmeg a bit more and reduce the cayenne, but that is just personal preference.

Perfect steak side dish! I love making creamed spinach this way, super easy and tasty! I also like adding a little shredded provolone to pump up the creamy cheesy factor.

This is by far the best tasting creamed spinach recipe I've ever made or tasted in any restaurant. The cream sauce is light and just enough to enhance the flavor of the spinach. And the shallots combined with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and the little bit of lemon zest make it out of this world! Definitely my new go to side dish.

I was getting ready to roast some steelhead filets and, though we love steelhead, we eat a lot of it because my husband and my son are avid fishermen. I wanted something to jazz it up, popped onto AllRecipes and found Steelhead Trout Bake with Dijon Mustard. After I mixed up the sauce and tasted it, I knew it would be delicious and so I decided I needed something to jazz up the plain salt-and-pepper, butter-and-vinegar spinach I had planned as a side dish. Once I had the steelhead in the oven, I found this recipe and slammed it together--didn't measure anything, just pan-roasted the spinach 'til cooked and dry, boiled down the cream, dumped in the spices. I think I got more onion and more nutmeg in than the recipe called for--and it was magnificent! WOW! We had a great meal of well-seasoned, delicious food. It was only after I came back to leave a review that I realized that there was supposed to be Parmigiano Reggiano in it too. Guess now I'll have to make it again! Thank you so much. I love this site.

This is excellent!  I needed creamed spinach for a recipe I was making, which calls for frozen creamed spinach.  I decided to make this fresh instead.  The only thing I changed (due to the fact that I am snowed in and was not trying to go to the store) was I used one bag of fresh spinach and a box of frozen (thawed and drained).  It was superb!  I had to force myself to stop eating it before I didn't have any left for my main course.  I will definitely make this again, both for this particular meal and also as a side for steak or roasted chicken.  YUM!

I've made both of CJ's creamed spinach recipes and they're both excellent. I sprinkle hard boiled egg and crumbled bacon on each serving. YUM.

Loved it. Cut recipe in half, just right for 2 people. Chopped spinach before cooking and drained in colander by pressing with spoon instead of paper towel. Cooked onion in oil at first then added spinach. Used milk instead of cream and added shredded monterey jack cheese.

Basically I made this recipe without the cream and nutmeg and it was AWESOME!  Best spinach I ever made and simple.  Do it without the cream for a lighter meal and its still fantastic.

Fabulous!  It's amazing how much volume spinach loses when it cooks down - 32 oz looks like a LOT of spinach before you cook it down and squeeze out the excess water!  One reviewer commented that this was barely enough for 4 servings, but I'm not sure it's even that much - two of us devoured it all easily.  It's very rich and flavorful!  Next time, I'll use even more spinach but with the same amount of cream sauce...and that's the only change I'd make.  Yummy!

I'm not much of a spinach fan, but I really liked this.  I did substitute half & half for the heavy cream and did not have fresh nutmeg.  Still very good!

Used sour cream as did another reviewer: loved it!! I do think that without it the creaminess might be overpowering, though.

I am use to my own creamed spinach recipe but I have to say this was a nice change.  Will make again.  I will say that I skipped the first step and just added the cleaned chopped spinach into the pan after the cream cooked a bit. Worked out great!  I liked the little kick from the cayenne pepper.

I used part of the butter to wilt the spinach. Then I took it out and sat it on a strainer over a bowl. I followed the recipe from there except I did not press on the spinach. I like the juice it makes. After thickening the sauce I added back the spinach and added smoked Provolone and a bit of Tillamook extra cheddar. Oh yum. None left- it went fast.

Fantastic!  
Used all ingredients and measurements listed and followed process.  
The only thing I omitted was chopping up the spinach.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! Not overly creamy, the lemon is a nice flavor.

This was delicious!  I used 2 10-oz packages of frozen chopped spinach (cooked in microwave and drained) and used 1.5x the other ingredients.   It was so simple to make and got rave reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner.

This is a FABULOUS creamed spinach recipe! I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and it still turned out great! I cooked the spinach in the oil and still followed all the steps of the recipe to a T.  My only regrets...I put WAY too much salt (my fault) and I only used 10 oz. of spinach. If I had used another bag I would have had leftovers!!! 

Next time, I will only use a pinch of salt and then add as needed for taste.

This was amazing. I reduced the heavy cream too much by accident and it was still fantastic. I didn't even use the cheese because it was so delicious when I tasted it. My whole family loved it, even my one year old baby who will never eat his vegetables. Thanks, Chef John!!!

I made it as is minus the cayenne. I think I will use the time saving clever suggestions from others related to the spinach cooking/wilting step. Other than that, I kind of felt the spinach a bit bitter, but it was still very good. Will make it again and next time will try it with the time saving suggestions from other reviewers!

I made this for eight people and needed to buy a ton of fresh spinach. The recipe is amazing, and it was very tasty. A lot of work because I made a large batch. 

COOK'S NOTE: My suggestion is if you are making this for a large dinner (six or more people) I would just opt for frozen spinach wrung out very well. It was a ton of work for little return.

Made as written except used finely chopped yellow onion in place of shallot. Delicious! Be patient reducing the cream mixture-it takes awhile, but it's worth it!

I used 3 10oz bags of frozen spinach and doubled the cream (because it was too dry in the proportions given for 10 people), using half full-fat sour cream and 1/2 reduced fat cream cheese both in place of heavy cream.

Warmed in the oven at 325 with some Parmesan and crispy onions on top.

This is an excellent recipe, absolutely delicious! Only change I made was to add 1 clove of minced garlic in with the onion. My husband doesn't care for the texture of cooked spinach but even he had to admit that the flavors were amazing and he would eat it again. Victory!

I doubled the recipe and brought it to a potluck. It rewarmed nicely in my crockpot and people enjoyed it. I‚Äôll definitely make it again, and I‚Äôll make sure I have cayenne on hand‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure it will be even better than it was with my tentative sprinkling of crushed red pepper!

I only had 1 pound of spinach that we had purchased for salads. I found it  difficult to maintain the flavors I expected by halving the ingredients. Besides, we are big eaters - so next time I'll use two pounds. Use your experience. I think the chef's idea of a "pinch" is too mild! Otherwise, we loved it.

I will make this again.
I used frozen spinach and 9 ounce box.  Put it in the microwave then put it in the blender with a fat free Greek yogurt, applewood smoked sea salt, turmeric, and pepper to taste turned out great. 
 I needed to pur√©e it due to pancreatic cancer and some difficulty digesting greens. This was a great way to be able to get those healthy spinach greens, enjoy the flavor of the spices, the extra creaminess and benefit of the protein from the Greek yogurt.

This is really good. I needed to make it healthier for my husbands diet so I used Greek yogurt instead of cream. It still came out yummy and creamy. I didn‚Äôt change anything else.  I used the cream spinach as a sauce over grilled Salmon. My husband loved it.

I cut this recipe in half as two pounds of spinach would make too much. Halved it made the right amount for two hungry men.  I thought I was a bit heavy on the spices which I did as written (o.k. I forgot to cut the spices in half...) but was told it was excellent.  This less creamy version is now preferred over the old fashioned creamed spinach I used to make.  Thanks Chef John.  I always enjoy your videos and your recipes!

Perfect side dish for people on lo-carb or Keto.  
I didn‚Äôt have any nutmeg , but, the result was still DELICIOUS!!!
I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call it easy, but, it is worth the extra steps.

Excellent!  Made a few changes.  Instead of cream, used 2% lactose free milk with a little butter added.  Used more shallot, 2 8 oz containers sliced baby bella mushrooms, a couple tablespoons pimentos. Cooked the spinach per instructions in large pot.  Removed and drained.  Added a little butter and olive oil to pan and cooked shallots and onions.  Sprinkled flour in.  Added milk/butter mix.  Added spinach and spices back in.  The cheese really adds flavor, don't skip it!

I love creamed spinach and this recipe sounded delicious plus all the high ratings. Mine did not taste good. It doesn‚Äôt sound that easy (lists of ingredients that aren‚Äôt regular staples in my pantry like lemon zest, fresh nutmeg and whipping cream). I substituted ground nutmeg and evaporated milk..always have a can on hand. I do realize substitutes will alter the taste and maybe even the consistency but like I said, I just don‚Äôt keep some of the ingredients called for on hand.

Delicious! Only alteration was adding about 3 tbsp of cream cheese to make creamier and rich. Thanks for a quick and easy side dish!

Delicious! This came out so good! I love spinach so I had to try this recipe and so glad I did. 7th recipe of Chef Johns I have tried, and once again it is delicious as always! Haven't tried a recipe of his I haven't liked, I have enjoyed them all so far. This creamed spinach has great flavor and it is the perfect way to flavor up spinach for someone who doesn't enjoy spinach by itself.

Best spinach ever! Love the hint of nutmeg and lemon zest. We were making Chef Johns beef stroganoff last night and my hubby wanted to use up a bag of spinach. I grabbed this recipe as it said fast and easy and the rest of our dinner was already made. It was fast and easy but best of all it was spectacularly delicious and paired so well with our dinner.. thank you Chef John-we love your recipes

We loved it.   Used one 8 oz bag of spinach and adjusted the rest of ingredients.  It was perfect for two people.  The pepper added a bit of pop.    Very simple and quick.  Much easier than using frozen.

I made this for Christmas. My husband loves it!  I had a bit of trouble getting it out of the pan, even though it was well greased. I think letting it cool a bit longer might have helped. It's a keeper, said he.  :)

Really a great tasting dish.  But even with this supposedly "easier recipe", being a novice, I found it to be a little bit of work.  The results were great and, because my husband really did love it, I am trying it again for Thanksgiving.

I made this on the fly as soon as I found this... On the fly because I didn't have fresh scallions or fresh nutmeg, so I used dehydrated onions and a tiny bit of ground nutmeg, but still was very, very good.  This is perfect for a keto side dish... Ironically, 16 oz of spinach turns into one serving, lol... but it's a great way to get some of those [greens] in ;)   Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again, and again.

I used half fresh and half frozen spinach (1block) and eliminated the lemon zest.  This turned out delicious.  I pureed with my immersion blender at the end for a smoother texture.  Perfect!

Made half a batch for just hubby and myself - using a 10oz container of spinach, since that was the size sold at our local store. It was barely enough for two of us. Will consider using a bit more next time. I found that the cream for half a recipe thickened very quickly and I had to add a little extra to the mix. Delicious but a bit rich. Also made with  whole milk instead of half & half. Reduced for probably about 10 minutes. Note to self - hubby likes not too much cayenne pepper.

Delicious! I took the shortcut of making the sauce then "melting" fresh spinach into the cream sauce. I let the sauce get a bit thicker than usual, closer to the consistency of a pudding, in anticipation of the spinach releasing a lot of liquid. The finished dish was still a little watery, but tasted really good. Next time I will try this recipe as written and drain the spinach well before adding to the sauce.

Made this for a family of 10 sunday dinner with a skirt steak and roasted potatoes and Caesar salad. even the grandkids took second helping. Every bit was eaten.  Celebrating our daughters birthday this Sunday, ask what she wanted and she said same menu we had last week....with more spinach!! Think I'll do baked potatoes this week....and 3 bags spinach.

The flavor was wonderful! I added a bit of flour because I just used milk instead of cream. I followed another commenters' advice to cook the spinach in the cream, but I would not recommend this method.  Just follow the recipe as it was written so that it won't end up too watery.

Like all Chef John's recipes this was easy yet very well seasoned. My husband said it was the best creamed spinach ever and to make sure to keep track of the recipe to make it again.

This recipe was amazing.  I ended up not even putting in the nutmeg and lemon zest and it was delicious.  I did add a little extra cream at the end to make it a bit more creamy.  I will definitely make this again.  Easy and delicious.

This was delicious!  I didn‚Äôt have a Shallot so I used yellow onion.   I added minced garlic.   I also used a 10 ounce bag of frozen spinach and I heated it up to room temperature and threw it in the pan  with the cream.

I've made this a few times now, and it is quick and delicious. It has become a staple side dish in our household. I did try it once with a regular onion instead of a shallot, and have to say the shallots make this dish, don't substitute! Last time I made it I omitted the Parmigiano-Reggiano as I didn't have it on hand, and it was still delicious. Love this recipe!

My spinach-hating-husband loved it. I cut the recipe in half, making just enough for us both. Not having fresh nutmeg, I used powdered. Not sure how I'd like the amount of spices, I went low, in order to be able to add as needed. I used one 8 oz bag of spinach, a smidgen of each spice, salt to taste (can't be sure - probably used 1/2 tsp), zest from one medium lemon. My husband told me to keep the recipe as I had made it for him. Also, I couldn't find a shallot, so I googled a substitute (used 1 Tbsp onion & a smidgen of garlic powder).

It was fantastic, but no surprise there being a Chef John recipe. I made it exactly as instructed and WOW! Not too heavy but very savory and the extra sauce was perfect for dipping steak into - yes, we devoured the spinach before eating the steak, it was that good!

A much quicker and lighter way of making creamed spinach. I used frozen, though - thawed it, squeezed it dry and chopped it, which worked very well. The lemon peel is a brilliant touch - I almost doubled the amount, and I'm glad I did. I served it with broiled salmon filet and wild mushroom risotto, and everybody loved it!

I did go a little light on the cream probably closer to 1/2 cup because we all prefer a light sauce on our vegetables.
This dish was well received by all of my guests.

Good stuff! I didn't have shallots so I just used very finely diced yellow onion. I also tossed in a chopped slice of bacon in with the onion. Will definitely make a larger batch next time!

We have made this a few times, followed the recipe exactly. Definitely tastes better with the cheese and fresh spinach. We tried it once with frozen because we were making a huge batch and it was still good but not as tasty. One time I accidentally forgot the lemon and could barely notice.

Delicious! I made it exactly as stated the first time and it was very good. Second time I put in an entire pint of heavy cream and one full shallot and I‚Äôll keep those edits from now on. So tasty! The cayenne is a wonderful touch.

Delish! Big win in my house.  I bought the wrong provolone - smoked instead of regular - and it gave some extra flavor.

Creamed spinach is a favorite at our house.  I made a few alterations based on what I had.  I used gluten free baking mix instead of flour and I used half and half  instead of heavy cream since I had that also.  I ended up adding a little milk  to thin it out, and it turned out great.  My husband loved it so much and was happy to know that there was a little left for tomorrow's lunch!

This is fast and easy. I may not have followed completely but pretty close to it. I sliced my shallot and added 2 thinly sliced garlic cloves. I also added 1 tsp arrowroot before adding the spinach. Oh, I  used 2 boxes frozen chopped spinach that I defrosted and used and old towel to wring it out. It's what I had in the freezer.

Made as written. A little different spin on creamed spinach with a lighter cream sauce. Fresh tasting and very flavorful. A definite make again.

Just one word: YUM YUM YUM!  No changes other than lightly sauteeing the fresh spinach in a little butter and splash of chicken broth, letting it evaporate and dry the spinach, then set aside to cool.  Then finished exactly per the recipe.  I intended this as a topping for a London Broil, and that was good, but it was even better topping the baked potatoes we had.  What a treat.  Thanks for posting.

We love this spinach and have made it twice and passed the recipe to friends. The cheese is important; don't scrimp but invest in some quality parmigiana.  With spring veg coming soon we'll probably be eating it weekly.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! However for a dinner party for 4, we used 4 16 oz bags, if people are huge eaters... 6 or 7 would be fine. None left and we all loved it!!

I used 2  11 ounce containers of fresh baby spinach.  I read how someone used chicken stock along with a little butter to heat up the garlic.  Works great.  I put in the spinach after a few minutes.  I added some grated parmesan while the spinach was cooking down.  I only used a little more than a third of a cup of heavy cream.  For the finish, I added a small handful of shredded parmesan cheese.  I found this took away any worries of it being too watery.  (Also, less calories.)

I have been searching for the perfect creamed spinach recipe and this is it! It is not super creamy or rich, which is just what I was looking for. It has a delicious, clean, fresh flavor thanks to the lemon zest and no additional thickening agents. Wonderful!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I only had half and half on hand so I used that instead of heavy cream, and it turned out great. My husband loved it too. I'll definitely make this again!

I just got home from the hospital the other day and was looking for a great spinach recipe. My husband is doing all the cooking while I heal and this was an easy recipe for him to follow. Really delicious. He served it along side a steak and roast potatoes.

I thought this was OK, but my family did not eat more than a couple of bites each.  It was bland, but not sure why they didn't like it.  I will continue my search for a steak-house quality creamed spinach recipe!

I was pleased with this creamed spinach recipe.  I made this for my family for a dinner with guests that don't like vegetables and they loved it.  I appreciate the light flavor of the cream and lemon zest.  I liked this with and without the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

This was a huge hit with picky hubby.   I  whipped it up  using what I had on hand ...frozen spinach,  some finely diced vadalia onion for the shallots, some  lime. & lemon. 
  The small amount  of heavy cream went a long way... kept everything  just Light enough.    I would not make it without the nutmeg and the  pinch of  cayenne though.    
All in all a perfect addition to my  New Years "lighter" dishes venue.

Let me start out by saying that I have always hated cooked spinach.  I think it had something to do with spincach coming from a can when I was a kid.   With that said, I had some fresh spinach left over from a salad I made a few days ago, and decided to give this a try.  OH MY GOSH! It was so good, I wished I had more fresh to use!   Thank yo SO much, Chef John.   Creamed spinach has a new convert.

I made it as written.  This is an easy do ahead for the most part and finish up at the last minute dish. I prepared the fresh spinach the night before and stored in the fridge.   There were 4 people dining and this recipe provided a nice serving for each with no left overs.  I served it with Rib Eye Roast and twice baked potatoes for Christmas Eve dinner.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this for thanksgiving dinner as a side and it was a hit - everyone commented on how great it was. I used frozen chopped spinach which simplified things. Just cook as printed on package, then squeeze out as much water as possible and go to step 2.  I'm glad I'm made a double batch as all wanted seconds. I did not add the parmesan cheese and don't think it needed it.  Needs a fair amount salt/pepper.

I have tried several creamed spinach recipes and did not find one that I felt was as good as what you get at steak houses.  This recipe was great.  The family loved it.  Pretty easy to make, I made as is, no changes.  I would recommend that you have all your ingredients ready to go before you start.  Watch the video first so you know what to expect.  Everyone wants me to make it again and I will!!

love this easy recipe.  forgot the lemon, added a bit of mild goat cheese, and more fresh nutmeg.  no shallots on hand so i used finely diced red onion.  had to wilt my spinach ahead of time in the micorwave (in large covered bowl with broth and a bit of olive oil) because the stove was too full. I did not measure ingredients, just sort of used the list as a guide.  I did add the parm.   YES i will make this again.  and again.  thank-you
