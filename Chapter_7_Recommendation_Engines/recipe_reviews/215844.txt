I was soo Happy to find this recipe!! It has been raining to the likes that Calif. has not seen in some time! I had everything to make a warm, Delicious, rib sticking meal for my soggy family. This came together in no time. If I had had Italian sausage, I would have used it, instead I added whole fennel seeds to the hamburger meat. Made this taste extra good! Sharp cheddar cheese was the only kind I had, so that went between the layers. I love onions and had forgotten to add it to the burger/sauce so I sprinkled them on as I layered and they stayed  nice and crunchy. Hubby proclaimed this dish 'A Home Run'!  My 15 yo DS wanted 2nds but was full. Easy peasy and kid friendly. I served it with homemade toasted garlic buns and green beans. Terrific for a cold, wet night:) I will put this in the rotation for sure! Thank you Missy Mallow Winner Winner dinner:)

I didn't have a pound and a half of ground beef--I had under a pound. To make up what I didn't have in ground beef, I added chopped veggies; chopped red pepper, garlic, mushrooms, zucchini. I also made my own marinara sauce and cut the ravioli down to 12 ounces (I only had one small 12 ounce bag in the deep freeze) and the mozzerella cheese back to just over a cup as I wanted to keep the fat/calories down. This was quite bendable for me to substitute what I had on hand and make healthier for my family but keep it cheap. I think had I not made it more personal, it would not have been as good.

This was good, however I missed the Ricotta in lasagna. Next time I will add (probably a 15 or 16 oz container) of Ricotta cheese mixed with some parsley & layer it in. I think it would be much better :-) I also sprinkled Parmesean cheese on top of the sauce (top) layer before baking.

We really just didn't care for this. Was really bland and just not what we thought it would be I guess. I was really disappointed cause I really liked the concept. I would also recommend baking it covered for the majority of the time cause I didn't and my top layer of cheese was burnt.

My family loves this!  It's super easy and it calls for ingredients that are usually on hand!  The only thing that I do differently is add cottage cheese in between the layers.  My husband also loves a parm. cheese crust on the top!
