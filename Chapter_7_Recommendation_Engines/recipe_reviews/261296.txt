I'm giving this 5 stars for the taste, but for "ease of making" I would give it 3 stars. Agree with other reviewers that these took some time to prep -- almost 1.5 hours for me. Next time I would definitely just bite the bullet and buy the pistachios that are already out of the shell, that would have saved considerable time (but more $$$). If you are a fairly experienced baker, these are fairly easy to put together. I'm pretty sure that the key to avoiding crumbly dough is not over-mixing the dough when adding the flour. I mixed until just combined, chilled for 4 hours and then sliced with a large serrated bread knife. A few cookies needed to be stuck back together, but for the most part they sliced nicely and looked pretty nice when all was said and done! My cookies took about 18-20 minutes to cook (recipe calls for 13-15 minutes).

I made it and am very disappointed.  A lot of work. Followed recipe to a tee.  Refrigerated for 14 hours.  Cut as instructed, 1/2" slices and baked according to directions.  Did not "brown", totally fell apart. Spread out, pinwheel sides collapsed.  Did NOT turn out anything like the pictures indicated.  Too distorted to put on a "goodie tray". Will NEVER make them again.  Too expensive(i.e. cost of pistachios, butter, and cranberries)

I was really intimidated by these cookies.....however I took the time to make them, and I am SO glad that I did.   My family has nominated this their very favorite cookie I have EVER made.  There is a salty and sweetness to these that is sheer perfection.  If you are looking to give cookies (no matter WHAT season) these would make a fabulous gift.   You could even dip partially in white chocolate to make them even more festive.

Great taste but difficult to put together.  Suggestion:  I lined small bread baking pans with parchment, rolled the dough on a baking sheet, cut rectangles the size of the pan bottom with a pizza cutter and froze them.  Layer frozen dough sheets and filler material in pan; beginning and ending with dough.  Freeze again, then cut and bake cookies.  Turned out great and much easier than working with a very soft dough.

Very very expensive and time consuming to make, but I kept thinking at least they will be delicious and beautiful. The batter doesn't hold at all and just crumbles. Then the end product wasn't pretty (the spirals were all messed up, pistachios and cranberries spilling out, the pistachios and cranberries are brown not pretty, they fall apart as soon as you touch them) and was very mediocre tasting. They tasted like a bland healthy cookie and yet they have loads of butter and sugar!

My new favorite  cookie recipe this year! Very few of my friends received these because they haven't made it out the door. They are oh so good! The  sweetness of the cranberry and the Nutty, salty ( I used the sea salt pistachios from Aldi)  flavor of the pistachio with the buttery  cookie is a great combination. 
Very easy to mix and roll into the slice and bake roll. Following directions dough needs a generous dusting of flour top and bottom.  I rolled up the night before and sliced and baked the next morning. I kept the roll in the refrigerator and baked as need through out the week.
My only variation from recipe was I made my slices 1/4 inch thick instead of 1/2 inch and reduced cook time to 11 minutes.  1/4 inch gives you plenty of cookie (and you get more! ??) As long as your log is good and cold and you have a large sharp knife you won't have any issuesAs soon as the edges start turn brown they are done! Don't wait for the tops to get brown.  The bottoms will be done. I was able to transfer to cooling immediately.  Time to my another log!

What a waste of time, butter and pistachios.  After refrigerating   12 hours, trying to cut into spirals was impossible.  Just kept crumbling.  Assembled  a few slices just to try the taste.  Very good flavor but never again.

I followed the recipe exactly but these didn't turn out as expected.  Perhaps it was my fault...who knows.  The recipe said to cook them for 13-15 minutes or until the edges turn golden .  I had to cook these for 45 minutes before they even started to turn golden.  They are very hard like a biscotti.  They do have a good taste but the pistachio and cranberry taste is missing.   They take a good deal of prep time so I'm pretty sure I won't be making these again.  I put two on a plate for my husband to eat after dinner and I just saw that he left one.  He never leaves sweets so he must not have cared for them either.
