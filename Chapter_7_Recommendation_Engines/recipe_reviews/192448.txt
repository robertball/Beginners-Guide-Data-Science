I have had this recipe and it is far the best Guacamole I have tasted. If you want a bit of a twist to an old regular, this is it!

This is a great guac recipe!! wasabi powder adds a subtle kick - not overpowering at all, but you know it's there. I forgot to add the cilantro (not a huge fan anyway) but the guac didn't need it. Delicious!

i never liked guaccamole, never cared much for it. i just needed a recipe for a potluck i was going to and everyone loved this! it made me look like a pro and i dont kno a thing about mexican food. this recipe made me a fan of guaccamole, it has just the right kick to it to make it stand out. some changes tho, like some reviewers said add one more avacado and cut down on the onion and it's perfection!

i only had one avo so i halfed it, and this is quite possibly the best guac i've ever made. the eggs were a different twist, but much appreciated. i did add more hot sauce (Sriracha) but that's because if my tongue isn't on fire, i don't think it's hot enough. :)

World class guacamole. This is probably about the right heat for many people, and if serving at a gathering. After tasting it as written, we wanted a bit more kick, and added another 1 teaspoon wasabi powder & 1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder. Used it as an optional topping on Shredded Chicken Tacos by Goya. Bullcitybob, you hit a grand slam home run with this, and hope you step-up with another great recipe.

Followed recipe exactly.  The egg is very distracting.  We thought it tasted more like egg salad with avocado than guacamole.  Thanks for posting, this just wasn't for us.

this was something definitely different.. we liked the guacamole but felt like there was something missing/needed.. i did use wasabi paste instead of powder but i don't think that made much of a difference.. bf asked me to put in some crumbled bacon and it satisfied that craving.. ty for the recipe
