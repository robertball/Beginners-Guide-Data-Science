These cookies are a bit cake-like for my liking, but the lemon gives them a nice flavor.  The jelly also makes them look a little more "special" than ordinary sugar cookies.  I'm shipping a dozen of them to my brother in the service, so we'll see how they fare in the mail!

These cookies created some closet eaters! While nobody was looking, they all just disappeared. We tried cherry and raspberry preserves,  raspberry being the BEST hands down. I didn't have the lemon extract so I used extra lemon rind...will DEFINITELY make again with extract!

I chose this recipe for cookies the other day because I was out of butter.  I was a little hesitant to try making cookies with vegetable oil, but these came out quite good.  I didn't have lemon extract, so added some lemon juice to the cookie dough.  The raspberry jelly complemented it nicely!  My kids loved them.  The first batch quickly went from not quite looking done to brown all over, so watch them closely.  In my oven, the cookies were done in just over 8 minutes.  Also, the consistency of the dough wasn't what I was used to, and though it was sticky, it was still easy to work with.  Great flavor, nice texture, and happy kids.

I was hesitant about the use of oil in these cookies, and 3/4 of a cup sounded like too much, but they turned out really well.  I measured out less than 1/2 a cup of sugarless (fruit juice sweetened) raspberry jam, and didn't even need the amount in the measuring cup.  The end result were attractive, light, delicately flavoured cookies, a wonderful, bright addition to my Christmas baking.  Thanks for sharing!
