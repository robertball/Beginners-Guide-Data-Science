Best sugar cookies ever! I found this recipe years ago on this website. I use it a lot. I recently moved and needed to make these cookies, but couldn't find the recipes because they were still packed away. I remembered the name of them so I looked it up again online and was astonished to find that there were only 5 reviews. This recipe is awesome. My family and friends can never stop eating these cookies. I always make them for holiday gatherings. A single batch makes a lot, but I usually double it up and make larger cookies. If  you are looking for something comparable to store bought sugar cookies, this is it. I forgot to add that I omit the salt. I don't like salt in any cookies that I make...

These were very good sugar cookies.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups shortening.  I didn't have enough shortening on hand and they spread out a bit, but were fine like that too.  They were pretty quick to make also.  I decreased the salt to 1 tsp.

This is a great recipe and the cookies turned out great!  For the next time, I would _not_ include salt in the recipe.

This said 24 servings so I thought that meant 24 cookies. HA! It made like 60. Now I see where it says 4 dozen. These cookies are awesome! The frosting wasn't enough to cover all the cookies, but I was kind of glad because I got sick of frosting them all! :)

Me and my best friend made them for Valentines Day and loved them. I used unsalted butter and added the normal amount of salt and they tasted great for those who don't like much salt. Highly recommended.

These are better than any sugar cookie I've ever tasted.  I've thrown out my old recipe and replaced it with this one.  I baked a batch of these for our kids church and they ate them up quickly.

These are fabulous and don't last long at home or whever I take them. I usually double the recipe when making them. But I've found I need to pack them in single layers only, as the frosting never really sets.

Wow, these are awesome! My picky daughter (whom hates anything new) LOVES these. Super easy to prepare and make and so soft and chewy. Replaced 1/4 of shortening with butter and used butter flavored shortening. Highly recommend.

Time consuming but great!  Make sure the cookies cool before frosting them and also ake the frosting ahead of time so it thickens before you put it on.

Yummy and so easy.  I halved the recipe and made these while my kiddos were eating lunch.  They loved them.  I also added some food coloring and did orange and purple frosting.  Such a quick and yummy recipe.  I only used about half the called for salt and they were just a tad too salty.  Next time I'll use about a quarter of the salt the recipe calls for.

Made these on a whim when my 5 year-old DD requested cookies with frosting yesterday. They're fairly standard sugar cookies; easy to throw together and bake. Personally, I could've done without any frosting, however, I whipped up the frosting to appease the kidlet. I halved the recipe, using 1/2 tsp salt and a 1/2 tsp of both baking soda and baking powder. Next time, I'll cream my softened butter (as opposed to melted) with the powdered sugar, but overall,  a yummy, albeit super sweet little cookie, which couldn't be any simpler. Adding to my "make again" file.

These are the only sugar cookie I make! My favorite sugar cookies have always been the ones at Casey's gas stations(I know A GAS STATION?  But they are SO GOOD!).  These are almost identical.  However, I do not use the icing with the recipe; they don't need it!  When I do ice them however, I use this recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vanilla-glaze/detail.aspx and use french vanilla coffee creamer instead of milk.

Great recipe but WAY too sugary for me. They do taste just like the cookies you buy at the grocery store though. Actually they just taste like sugar.

Perfect! tastes just like a sugar cookie should. I used Royal icing on mine so I could stack them.  But the next time I think I will just sprinkle a little sugar on top before baking. They don't need frosting.I will absolutely be making these again!!!!!

everyone loved these! they were very moist and the icing stayed soft. The recipe makes A LOT of cookies though, so you might want to split the recipe in half.

These were fantastic. I made them for Christmas and they were gone in 2 days! Everyone loved them. The only thing I did different was roll out the dough and use biscuit cutters to shape them.

I love these cookies and so does everyone that I have made them for. I did read some reviews about the frosting having raw eggs. I made them twice with that frosting and no one got sick, but to be sure I now make them with homemade butter-cream frosting. They are awesome that way. Also good plain.
