As an American living in Sweden, I have only one suggestion for the glgg, add the raisins and almonds AFTER you've boiled everything!

I befriended someone from the Netherlands who was studying here in the U.S. and he served this at a holiday party.  He said that you leave the almonds and raisins out in a dish NEXT TO the pot of glogg. People serve themselves hot glogg and add the almonds/raisins if they choose to. That way they do not get soggy.  I prefer this with MUCH LESS sugar...I don't like sweet things and I felt that the sugar brought out the flavor of the spices so much that it masked the wine. When I cut the sugar to half, it was much better.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and didn't double the raisins and almonds when I doubled this recipe.  There was still way too many!  I would reduce the number again.

Although the recipe called for 2 oz. of cinnamon sticks, a jar only holds .75 oz.  I used the whole jar after the recipe was doubled and it was plenty.  I can't imagine how it would have tasted with 4 oz. of cinnamon sticks.

Otherwise, the taste was excellent.  It was easy and delicious!

The almonds and raisins are great for taste but I found the volume of them in the pot a little too much, especially after they absorb some of the liquid.

Very Very good, I added a little more wine after I removed the rasins and almonds because they absorbed alot of the drink, the consistency is still fairly thick and everyone just loves it.

This recipe is incomplete. There are a ton of variations, but most people boil with the almonds and raisins, but then remove them at the end so you only have the liquid. You can serve with almonds and raisins if you wish. I make non-alcoholic with grape, cherry and apple juice, brandy extract boiled with almonds, raisins, some ginger and an orange rind. Let it sit overnight, then boil again and remove solids.

This is a great recipe. I suggest charging it up with a little more brandy though. I noticed people reviewing the amount of almonds and raisins in the recipe. It says to serve WITH the almonds and raisins, nowhere does it say to prepare it with the almonds and raisins.

I have a swedish family who drinks this every christmas, for those who have not had it it is a drink for cold weather, something warm to come out of the cold to with a spicy holiday flavor.
