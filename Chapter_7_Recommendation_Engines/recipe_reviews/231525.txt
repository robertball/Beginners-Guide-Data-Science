These little biscuits are a delight to serve and very tasty. I tinkered with the shape of them because they were so fun to make, but the end result was still delicious. The dough is perfect to work with, and the flavor of the olive oil and pepper marry nicely. Thanks Allie for a great recipe that my family will enjoy many times.

I didn't change a thing and these were a flop. No one in the family liked these.

My friend and I had a project for English on the Italian Renaissance. We needed to bring food in, so we decided these would do the trick. Unfortunately, they didn't come out as we had hoped: flavorless, yet strangely spiced, hard, and strange chunky shapes. We didn't have enough time to through them out and make something else, so we had to serve them to our class. They were edible, but not many people liked them resulting in us getting weird looks from classmates. I had hoped these would be better.

Made these for my wife and kids for dinner tonight. This was so easy to make and my family loved them, except for the fact I had halved the recipe just in case no one liked them. So immediately following dinner I was back at it making more. Which wasn't a problem because like I said before they are so easy to make.

A very easy and quick recipe, specially when you are out of basic baking ingredients such as eggs and butter...Their oil proportion is perfect. Great to accompany with Mediterranean flavors such as tomato, specimens, cheese and olives! This one has earned a place in my recipe book!
