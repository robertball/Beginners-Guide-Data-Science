This is without a doubt, the best chowder I have ever made.
While I didn`t use Calamari, or Clams, I chose to use extra shrimp, crab and scallops.
Five of my friends have asked for this recipe, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to all

Amazing!  This is by far the best chowder I have ever had, and my family is from Maine!  I tweaked it a bit, adding clam juice and omitting corn.  This recipe is a hit in my family!

This was almost too easy to make! It tasted very good - especially considering the little effort required.  I might try some tweaking next time for a more seafood-y flavor, maybe substitute clam juice for the water from the can of corn.  Thank you - my mom & mother in law both asked for the recipe!

Excellent seafood chowder. Tried many different combinations (including replacing calamari with lobster meat).  The most popular by far: no carrots, 1.5 pounds bay scallops, 1 pound shrimp ... no other saefood.  Popular with everyone, requested often by friends and family.

This was a pretty basic recipe but def. not 'full of flavour'. I added lots of other ingredients to the chowder in order for it to have SOME flavour. I added leeks, chicken stock, celery and even parmesan chesse. Made it better, but the recipe itself was wayy to bland for my taste..

Very good!  I also substituted canned corn for frozen.  I used canned clams and poured the juice into the chowder.  For seafood, I used fresh sea scallops, fresh haddock, fresh salmon, fresh calamari, frozen pre-cooked shrimp, and canned baby clams.  Excellent Recipe.  We'll definitely make this again.

Excellent flavor for such an easy recipe!  Used low fat ingredients in place of non-fat, frozen corn instead of canned, and clam juice for corn water.  Heating mushroom soup and cream cheese together first and wisking is a better way to blend. I didn't watch soup carefully enough and it boiled causing the soup to brown on the bottom.  This worked to my advantage because the brown flecks disguised the mushrooms which my husband ordinarily won't eat - ha, ha!  He asked me to cut the pepper in half next time.

Outstanding recipe! After reading various other suggestions, I made a few modest changes. I used frozen corn, added the juice from the clams, further thinned the chowder with additional milk, used more garlic (4 small cloves), traded the parsley with Old Bay, and added a couple extra dashes of cayenne (I like spicy!). Furthermore, I made this recipe on the spur of the moment - so, I only had on hand uncooked frozen shrimp, canned clams and canned crab meat. I was very concerned that the canned seafood would diminish the flavor of the chowder - no need to worry - it was delicious! And even my foodie friends were impressed....they said it beat any restaurant seafood chowder they had eaten! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for BUNCO night.  It was a hit with the ladies.  I made a change though.  I used 4lbs of shrimp and omitted all the other seafood.  It made the chowder more economical because shrimp was on sale ;-).

Great chowder. . . Cook the veggies in oil first and in a seperate small pot, combine the milk and cheese and pour it over the veggies when both are done. HOLD OFF ON THE CORN till you put the seafood in!!! Corn is already cooked and has the tendency to settle super fast and SCORCH. Trust me, its better safe than sorry to just do this and save your chowder. . .
And just to save you some time as far as shopping for all the seafood. Look at around at all your local stores in the butcher department. Some have a premade seafood combo and some nice gents even make one up for you. Its a lil less costly and beats having to get 5-6 different packages of seafood at a time. . .

This was wonderful!!  It made a lot and I'll probably cut the recipe down a little.  Also used more milk (fat free half/half)then the recipe called for.

I like to cook healthy and this recipe was excellent.  It was rich, creamy, full of flavor -- while being low in fat, and full of nutrition!  I didn't change much from the original recipe.  My boyfriend loved this too.  Good work.

Delicious chowder!  I also tweaked the recipe by sauteing 3/4 cup of chopped celery in one tablespoon of butter until crisp-tender.  I added this along with the other vegetables.  I substituted one cup of frozen corn and one half cup of water for the canned corn.  No calamari for us.  The next time I make this I will steam the carrots and potatoes before adding to the pot.  Twenty five minutes was not enough cooking time for them.  Perhaps this chowder will become a Christmas Eve Dinner tradition!

We weren't fans of the cayenne pepper in this recipe. It was just a little too much. The rest of this recipe is great and I'll definitely try it again, without the cayenne. I also substitued tilapia for the scallops since I"m allergic and used an extra can of clams instead of the calimari and didn't drain either of those.

Awesome chowder!!! Thank you so much for the recipe! I did change it slightly. I sautéed the green onions, potatoes, and garlic before adding them to the milk and cream cheese mixture. I left out the corn and carrots (preference). I added Old Bay Seasoning, and cut back on the Cayenne because of that (did 50/50 of each). I only used the Shrimp, Scallops, Crab Meat, and 1 Can of Clams with the Clam juice. Awesome!! Will make again and again!!!

WOW!!! Made this last night and it was a HUGE hit, even my picky seven and three year olds asked for seconds! Only changes I made was use clams instead of calamari, I didn't have any, and added clam juice as suggested by others.

Yummy! Took my chances to serve at a small get together. Everyone raved about it. Added a cup of white wine, replaced can of muchroom soup with fresh Shitake mushrooms you could taste. Forgot to buy crabmeat and it was actually fine without it. Can't wait to make it again with the crabmeat. Thanks!

Very, very good.  I did not scimp on the fat-whole fat ingredients used.  Totally creamy and delicious.  I make this at least once a month.  Also used 1 lb. of shrimp and scallops, omitted the calamari and added chopped imitation king crab.  Yummy

I had a seafood chowder craving so I decided to try this recipe based on the rating....I'm SUPER glad I did!! It turned out amazing!! I made some minor changes and it turned out just perfect. I browned 1lbs of bacon and sauteed white onions instead of green onions in the grease, saved the bacon for topping. I also stired in a 8 oz block of cream cheese and added 2 tablespoon of curry powder instead of the cayenne. I added 1 cup of chopped green onions near the end.
Oh its so good!

The plus for this recipe, is its lower fat. But as stated, it really didn't have much depth of flavor. I agree with another reviewer,  it tasted mostly of canned soup. After adding 1/2 c sherry,finely chopped white onion, celery, chicken bouillion granules,clam juice, nutmeg, saute'ed mushrooms, and some (leftover) asparagas, it was 5 star worthy.  Also, it was spicy (not too much)for our taste, using 1/2 the cayenne. IF, I  make again, it would be only with additions, still half the cayenne, and cooking the veggies before adding milk...it took way too long to get veggies soft, standing & stirring often, so not to boil the milk.

Everyone loved this.  I used frozen raw shrimp, not peeled, the canned clams and some haddock and there was lots of seafood flavour.  I like how everything is cookd together to maintain nutrients instead of draining them away in boiling water.

This is really good. I diced up 3 slices of Bacon & cooked until browned. I used the Bacon drippings to saute my veggies then added them to my pot. I usually use 2lbs of shrimp, canned clams with juice & crab meat. When serving I garnish it with the cooked bacon. My husband & kids love it!!

I was skeptical of this recipe because of all the fat free products, but I was mistaken. I would not have changed this recipe a bit. My husband asked me to make this again, and I feel better giving him this healthy version of seafood chowder. This will be a household recipe.

Potatoes and carrots definitely needed to have been cooked more.  Next time I will also leave out the corn.  Other than that I liked the flavor.  Thanks!  I will make this again.

Simply outstanding. My mother cooks what I thought to be the best seafood chowder and even she has been left amazed. I'm not a complete health nut so I use regular milk. I like the consistency a little soupier so I add addt'l milk. I use medium shrimp, bay scallops, crab claw meat, haddock and clams. I add 1/2 cup of fish stock and a few good squeezes of fresh lemon. I only use 1/4 tsp of Cayenne AND AN ABSOLUTE MUST IS 1/4 TEASPOON OF THYME AND 1 BAY LEAF--YOU WILL NOT REGRET ADDING THESE! I omit corn but fresh chopped celery is a must. The best thing about this recipe is it's versatility. The key is the broth. After that it's personal taste. Great job! I'm passing this off as my own creation. Just kidding. :-)

Doesn't even taste like a chowder - the cream cheese overpowers any of the seafood flavor - and I added approx. 1TBSP of lobster bouillon.  I won't make again.

This tastes rich, I feel guilty eating it. I subed green onions for sauted yellow and canned corn for frozen. I added white wine and more milk than called for and I only used shrimp. This is easy and good!

SO GOOD!  I couldn't find calamari tubes, so I omitted them, without changing the quantities of anything else, and it was still delicious and chock-full of seafood.  I made the heart-attack inducing version of this, since those were the ingredients I had on hand (full-fat cream cheese, full-fat cream of mush, and even whole milk... oh yes, I did).  My husband and I gobbled this up - it was so filling and divine!

Ok...working with what I had - but pretty much followed the basic recipe.  Used evaporated milk instead of regular and use 1/3 fat cream cheese - Also added more fresh garlic as it just needed a little kick - and why oh why didn't I listen to myself and cook the potatoes first??  lol  Took way longer than 25 min for them to soften and I had chopped them fairly small.  Ah well other than that I knew I only had chopped clams on hand and used 2 cans with the juice.  I'm eating now and it's not quite done lol and it's very good...I bet even better later on!  Thanks for great base recipe to use with all kinds of seafood :)

It was REALLY GOOD. I prefered to add fresh parsely instead of dried when I added the seafood to cook. I only used shrimps, calamari and scallops. Also, I added a veggie bouillon for extra kick. Its great for next day meal also.

This was soooooooo incredibly delicious!! My 15 y/o son had 3 bowls & my husband had 2! I added a jar of clam juice, few sprinkles of fish sauce & one small chopped onion. I also added the juice from the can of clams. YUM!! Might have to double it next time, as there's only about 1 bowl left now!

Made this for family and friends and everyone loved it. My in-laws are from Maine and said it was the best chowder they have ever had. I did make two substitions 1) replaced the calamari tubes with crawfish tail meat and used 2 pounds of shrimp instead of the scallops. 2) in place of the pepper and cayenne I used "Old Bay".

This recipe was VERY VERY easy to make and full of flavor!  One thing though...if you don't like spice in your foods, then leave out the cayenne pepper.

Wonderful and so easy to make.  I used low fat cream cheese, doubled the milk and added white wine.  Made a batch with and without the cayenne.  Cayenne definately gives it some kick so if you don't like spice...skimp or omit it.

This recipe is amazing! I tweaked it just a little, replacing calamari with langostinos and scallops with extra shrimp. I also used the juice from clams and crab. The cayenne pepper is great if you like a little zest. We do!

This is the best seafood chowder I ever made and easy to make.  I used a bag of frozen seafood mix (Walmart,Shoprite,most grocery frozen seafood section) and small bag frozen shrimp which worked out perfect.  Still add the clams as the juice of the clams is needed.  I added a cup extra milk too.  Next time I plan on using scallops.  I had no cayenne pepper so I used hot sauce and it was great.

This chowder was super delicious and very easy to make. I used canned seafood (red salmon, clams, crab meat, tiny shrimps), but it still turned out great.

Very good. I halved the recipe since I only needed enough for me and hubby, and tweaked the recipe based on what I had on hand. I added a healthy splash of wine to deglaze the pan after sauteeing a few slices of bacon and the veggies and spices (veg and spice added after bacon was removed). I used one 10oz can fat-free cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup+ white onion instead of green, several shakes of celery seed for flavor, no corn, no potato, 1 tsp chicken base/bouillon, and went light on the cayenne. Once I was ready to eat, I added some pre-cooked shrimp, a can of clams, and one can of crab meat to the pot. I would definitely make this again. If I'd planned ahead, I might have gone out to buy the other ingredients, but it's nice to know this recipe can be thrown together with a few changes in case of a seafood chowder emergency. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! I was cleaning out the fridge and freezer and so this is what I used - light cream, garlic, cream of mushroom soup, onions, carrots, potatoes, canned corn, 16 oz fresh mushrooms, 1 pound scallops, 1 pound salmon, 2 cans clams, salmon flavored cream cheese, 1 chopped red bell pepper, pepper, salt, parsley, and my favorite- dill. I didn't alter the recipe on purpose but had to use what was on hand. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Excellent flavor - cooking time a bit off. I left out the clams and calamari but beefed up the shrimp and crab. Used half the corn water and added 8oz. clam juice. Added a little thyme and season salt and 3/4 cup celery. It seemed to take a lot longer than 25 minutes to get the potatoes and carrots cooked but I think the "simmer" instructions should be: "simmer on low and stir often" to overcome this. I was afraid I would burn the milk/cheese mixture if it was left to just "simmer...do not boil".
Anyway, the end result was yummy and very filling.

Great chowder, very thick and hearty.  This recipes makes quite a lot, I had to serve it to my co-workers to finish up the left overs.  But, they didn't seem to mind!  I used frozen corn, and added clam juice, white wine, and mushrooms.  When I make it again, I will try to substitute the cream of mushroom for a cream of shrimp, just to add more of a seafood flavor. I will add Old Bay Seasoning, too.

Delicious!  I used frozen corn, clams, canned crab, and fresh shrimp.  I also substituted fat free half-and-half for the milk, which made the soup decadently rich, but still low in fat!  I will certainly make this again.

Excellent chowder! I used canned clams, fresh baby shrimp, and crab meat. I recommend softening the cream cheese before heating (or use soft cream cheese). I will definitely make again!

I rated this 4 stars for ease and as a good base recipe. However, with some small changes and seaoning, it's definitely worthy of 5 stars. After reading countless reviews, these are the changes I made: omitted milk and replaced with 2 cans of Bay Harbor lobster stock (I do admit the extra can made it a bit thin, so you could use 1 and be fine), used 2 (10.5 oz) cans Campbell's Healthy request cream of mushroom soup, 1lb jumbo shrimp (chopped into 1/3rds), 1/2 lb frozen bay scallops (thawed), 1/2 lb jumbo lump crab meat, and 1 lobster tail (in hindsight, next time I will use the canned clams with juice, to add more salty sea water taste, and omit the lobster b/c you can't taste 1 tail anyway). I also diced about 1/2 cup of sweet onion (instead of the green, which I only used for garnish) and cooked that with 1 cup diced celery, and 1 peeled & diced medium red potato over low heat for about 15 minutes (adding the garlic in the last few minutes), and then followed the instructions from there (if you don't cook the potato a bit beforehand, it won't cook enough in 25 min at a low simmer). I also followed the instuctions for melting the cream cheese, except I did that with my lobster stock.
The only other thing this recipe needs is some seasoning. I don't have dried parsley on hand so I left that out. I added some seafood seasoning (I didn't measure, but maybe it was about a tsp -next time I'll add more unless using the clams with their juice adds what was missing this time). Perso

Made it three times and cannot stop being amazed at how tasty this chowder is. And the most importantly it's probably the healthiest I've ever had. I changed up seafood ingredients (very flexible--can be done to your taste and/or budget) and cooked potatoes and carrots in just enough water to cover them prior to adding milk and other ingredients--this speeded up the cooking process quite a bit. Whoever came up with this recipe is a genius!

I made this chowder very similar to the original recipe. I didn't have skim milk so I used evaporated. I think it helps to keep the soup base from separating. I also slowly heated up the milk, cream cheese and cream of mushroom and then mixed it smooth. The potatoes took a lot longer to cook (as they were simmering, not boiling). I would par-cook these in the future. I used crab, clams, baby shrimp and salmon. Excellent flavor with the addition of some Old Bay and extra cayenne. The corn gave it a little extra sweetness, which was nice. I am excited for the leftovers and I will make this soup again!

Made this with shrimp, razor clams, crab and octopus because that's what I had on hand, and subbed celery for carrots. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. I accidentally threw in the whole cup and a half of milk with the cream cheese but it didn't seem to affect the outcome at all. The chowder was even good the next day for lunch. Thank you for this recipe. Will be making again!

I just made this for the first time, and can't wait to serve it to my family and friends.  I used canned clams with the juice, canned crab, fresh shrimp, calamari and scallops.  I chopped the veggies really tiny and left out the corn as my husband cannot eat it. I had been looking for an easy seafood chowder recipe and will look no further. I already pinned it in pinterest! Thank you.

I read many of the comments and added one package of 1/3rd less fat cream cheese by melting it in the pan used to brown the bacon and onions.  After removing the bacon and onions, I added 1 cup of the chicken stock with the cream cheese on medium high stirring constantly until the cream cheese had melted into the chicken stock.  Then I combined all of the ingredients into the crockpot adding two table spoons of Old Bay seasoning.  I also dissolved 1.5 table spoons of corn starch in a 1/4 cup of water and added it when I added the condensed milk at the end.  The cream cheese and corn starch combined added a little thickness and now this recipe has both bacon and cream cheese, simply outstanding flavor and consistency. My family has a new favorite fish chowder.

Best chowder recipe I've ever made!  I had to use food on hand, so 15oz can each of cr of mush and cr of celery soups. I also only had shrimp and crab, so doubled those amounts. Next time, I hope to have scallops and calamari to add!  So good!

First sautéed the onion, carrots in oil, simmered all in chicken stock including the diced potatoes. When vegies were cooked, Then added the condensed soup and cream cheese, canned corn, drained. Used clam juice as others recommended, it added a nice briney flavor. I also added Zatarians creole seasoning, about 1 tsp.  I added mixed seafood, mussels, shrimp, calamari and scallops. Excellent! Company good. Doubled the recipe. Photo attached.

Amazing!!! I've never had seafood chowder before but I love soup. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have clams or calimari.  The soup was still delicious even without those ingredients. I will be making this again. Thank you.

Being a native New Englander, I know chowdah, and chowder has bacon! So I started this recipe with frying the bacon, then I sauteed the onions and raw vegetables in the grease. Continued with the recipe from there and tasted it after it was complete. Decided it needed a little more seasoning, and less cayenne pepper, fortunately I only put 1/4 tsp to begin with, but could use a touch less. Bay Seasoning makes this chowder awesome! I will make this again.

Made a double batch and substituted lobster for calamari. I also used 2 cups of frozen corn instead of the canned corn and added another 3/4 cup of milk (3 3/4 total milk for double batch).  The doubled amount filled our large crock pot for our Friday night Church Lenten Soup. It was a hit!  The cream cheese, green onions and fresh minced garlic are the star of the base!  Thanks for sharing

I had bought some frozen calamari tubes and legs and came across this recipe to use it up. Worked great! I used tiny frozen shrimp and the fake Krab. Didn't have clams or scallops. 
I did add a little more carrots and potatoes as well as celery and regular onion. (Next time I will sautee' the veggies as they took so long to cook and I kept sneaking bites!)
Didn't have the "26 oz cr of mushroom soup" so had to use 3-10 oz of Cr of Chicken, Cr of celery and Cr of mushroom- taste is fine- besides, that's what was in the cupboard. 
I LIKE spicy food but think I will halve the cayenne the next time. It's that after taste spicy that sticks with ya. 
Great flavor, waiting here for it to cool down so I can eat. Made cornbread w/ our fave- honey on top. 
Used 2% milk too and reg cream chz.

This chowder is certainly wonderful ! I highlt suggest the use of clam juice for a more seafood flavor. You can throw any kind of seafood you'd like in here and truly make it yours! I made this for a potluck and it did not last! Give it a try!

Best chowder ever!!  The only things I changed were using low fat instead of fat free items also added 1/2 cup of clam juice and fresh parsley.  This was delicious and will be my go to for seafood chowder and probably clam chowder.

Very good recipe but like many of the reviews say, it is still a little bland.  I added 2-3 times as much cayenne, 2-3 times as much garlic, along with about a TBSP of Old Bay blackened seasoning and ended up with a good flavor.

Delicious! I made it in the crockpot. I put in everything except the seafood and corn and cooked it until al dente; then added the seafood for the last hour or so.  I used 2 ears of fresh corn on the cob because I had it, and we like corn. I didn't have any seafood other than canned clams so I used 3 cans with the juice and it was delicious clam chowder.  Entire family loved it!  Only problem is no leftovers!

This Chowder is amazing and easy and versatile. I didn't have any cayenne pepper and I used whatever fish and seafood I had on hand and it was amazing!! I big hit, light and flavorful. I sautéed my onion, carrot and added celery, in butter and garlic before adding the cream cheese and milk. I think this gave it a little extra flavor.

This recipe is amazing! I added bacon by cooking it first and deglazing with a small amount of white wine. Then I added milk, cream cheese and followed the original recipe. I added shrimp, scallops, and clams (with juice) but you can pretty much put in anything you want. I might experiment with chunks of a hearty fish like Halibut. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and daughter LOVED THIS!!!  I don't do seafood, but they love it.  For once I made something that was a HUGE hit!!!  I couldn't find Calamari tubes, so I got a calamari steak and cut it up.  They ate every bit of it!!

I made this for my boyfriend and son.  Didn't have fat free cream cheese or milk so I used what I did have and also used only half the amount of cayenne and pepper. I also only had crab and shrimps but it still turned out well.  They loved it.  I'll be making it again.

quick, easy, and very tasty! the pinch of cayenne pepper was a great touch! i simplified just a bit for convenience and frugality with the grocery store's "seafood mix," regular onions, and extra cream of mushroom instead of cream cheese. i think it'd be even better exactly as written.

I served this for Christmas Eve dinner when we wanted to do "the Feast of the 7 Fishes", so I added 1/2 pounds of 7 different kinds of fish/seafood. (I had to eliminate the corn since my husband can't eat that.) It was wonderful! Hearty and very satisfying! Would definitely make it again!

I was skeptical, but with the fantastic reviews, I figured this one would be worth a shot, and I'm happy to say, it was far better than I had anticipated! I bought a can of clams, fresh bay scallops, crab claw meat, and shrimp - way more seafood than the recipe called for, but I wanted seafood in every spoonful. My husband specifically said "ew gross, clams." but I was already invested in the project so I put them in my food processor and ground them up with a little milk. Warning - this produces a hideous, disgusting grey/green liquid that I almost threw out... but I persevered and you should, too. It'll be ok, I promise.  My honest advice: Don't let the clams scare you: they add a rich, sorta sweetness that you wont be able to achieve without them. I pretty much followed the recipe but used frozen corn instead of canned, and like some others, added most of the juice from the canned clams. I did end up adding a little chicken broth towards the end because I was out of milk and used so much seafood that I needed a little more liquid. I also stirred in about 1-2T of sherry and it was amazing. Next time (yes, there WILL be a next time. The clam hating man has already requested it again. ), I think I will cook the potatoes and mash them up a bit to make a thicker, more chowdery chowder.  So good!

Excellent flavor; tweaked it a bit to my taste.  Added 2 cans of chopped clams (with juice), canned lobster claw meat, canned crabmeat, fresh shrimp & scallops, fresh corn, bay seasoning, yellow onion (in addition to green), onion powder, red pepper and chicken broth.  Super easy, made more than 8 servings!  Will make again!

Made this yesterday, and it was delicious. I had most of the ingredients, except for the clams (next time) and cream cheese (used half & half instead), and I substituted vegetable stock for the soup. I did add one important ingredient: turkey bacon bits (less fattening) -- the taste is a necessary step in many chowders [imo]. Also added fresh sliced mushrooms and chopped celery. I prefer to sauté my garlic and vegetables in butter for a few minutes prior to adding the liquids, adding to the flavour. For sure I did make changes from the original recipe, but this is definitely my new base starter for future chowders. Thanks!

Super quick and easy chowder! I also added the juice from the can of clams.  Left out the cayenne and served it in bread bowls with hot sauce on the side so that everyone could adjust their own heat. I cooked the cubed potatoes separately in chicken broth. That was I didnt have to worry about scorching the milk mixture. Lastly, I added a couple of large dashes of Worcestershire. OOHHH YEAHHH! This one is a keeper!!

This was quite tasty.  I prefer my clam chowder better but was looking for something without bacon.  I like that it's very low fat.  I had to use fat free cream of chicken (no c.o. mushroom) but it was still good.  I did saute the onions, carrots, and potatoes a bit before adding as I thought cooking in the thick soup wouldn't cook them completely.  And next time I'll leave out the cayenne.. it's just not my favorite flavor.

I have made this recipe many times and it is great.  Trader Joe's Frozen Seafood Blend is an easy alternative to all the different seafood needed.  I use it with a pound of Shrimp and it is perfect! My only comment is that the simmer time for the vegetables is much too short to get them tender..it is closer to an hour before you can add the shrimp and other seafood.

Absolutely amazing.  Easy to make and simple to adjust because the base soup itself is delicious.  I've made this several times and have altered the ingredients based on the availability of seafood or veggies.  The fat-free milk, cream cheese and soup along with the garlic offers a great base to add and subtract other items. My last batch I made I forgot the carrots and since I wanted to add color I added a can of chopped tomatoes in there and added a couple of spices to ease the additional flavor and BAM - great new variant!

I usually avoid recipes that involve condensed cream soups, but I made this tonight and I'm glad I did. My family loved it.  My only changes were in substituting seafood that was available today in the fish market rather than using specifically what the recipe called for, and leaving out the clams. This chowder served with some sourdough bread and a salad was a tasty and filling meal.  The cayenne gives the soup a little bit of a kick, so anyone sensitive to spicy dishes might want to back off on that quantity.

Great stuff!  Wound up simmering a lot longer than the recipe calls for in order to get the potatoes and carrots soft. Used Crab meat, shrimp, clams, muscles, & scallops.  Delicious!

OMG! AWESOME! I omitted the onions and carrots and used claw crabmeat (has much more flavor for a soup). I also sub 1/2 cup of the milk for  half/half.  I am making it again today.  My BFF Rose said it could be served in a 5 star rest.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with the world.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!  What an easy and quick dish to make. Everyone loved it.  I'm not a calamari or clam fan so I left those out and used more shrimp and scallops.  This recipe will go in favorites file.  Thank you for sharing.

All I have to say is WOW!  We spent a little more and bought good seafood from the Fresh Market, but it was worth it!  We did use canned clams.  I also used frozen corn instead of canned (I never use canned vegies) and just added some water to loosen up the thickness some.  Other than that, this recipe was amazing and I'll definitely make it again!  It makes a GREAT recipe for hosting dinner because it's a bit more on the fancy side, but so easy to make!

This chowder absolutely ROCKED!  I was very skeptical as I dislike soup from a can.  Boy, was I wrong.  My local grocery store didn't have scallops or calamari (both of which I love), so I doubled up on the crab, clams, and shrimp!  Also, I used red potatoes and left the skin on.  This is most definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Didn't have any crab meat or scallops on hand so I substituted with another 1/2 lb of shrimp (1 lb of shrimp total) and added 2 more cans of clams (3 cans total). I drained the corn and added 1/2 cup of clam juice for that extra seafood flavor. It was delicious! For extra spiciness, I also doubled the cayenne pepper. Thanks for the recipe---will absolutely make it again!

Awesome!!!  Used fresh scallops and shrimp, but canned clams and crab & skipped the calamari.  Full of big yummy chunks, full of flavour.  A big hit with my family - including my 1.5 yr old and 3.5 yr old.

I changed this recipe up a bit since I used what I had on hand.  I didn't use any of the fat-free items and just used regular ol' block of cream cheese and 2% milk.  I had a bag of frozen seafood mix that happened to be calamari, shrimp, etc....  So, I used that on top of the canned clams (which I used 2 of) and some extra shrimp that I had.  I precooked the potatoes (I used red) and it was probably close to 2 cups.  I also added more pepper and OLD BAY seasoning.  I think without the flavoring it would be pretty bland.  

I took the advice of adding the corn later, too.

Very good! I made changes based on what I had onhand. I used scallops, tilapia, sole, shrimp (precooked), white onions instead of green, one can of cream of mushroom, one cream of asparagus, added bacon and Old Bay. Took forever for potatoes to cook at a temp low enough to not scorch the soup, so I would precook them next time. Next time I'll use crab instead of the scallops, but I'll keep the fish I added because I love fish in chower.  Great base recipe to adapt to your taste!

Good, but not great.  I added wine, used salmon, haddock scallops, mussels (cooked them separately).  Didnt add the pepper based on what I read, but the cream sauce was a bit bland.  Needs some work.

This was excellent chowder ! It rivals a chowder that I used to get at a local restaurant in Connecticut. The only thing I would change next time would be to leave the pepper and cayenne out. I am originally from the Southwest and love spicy food but this was a bit much in the chowder with all of the good seafood.  We also added more crab meat in place of the calimari. All in all, we will surely make this again soon. Kudos to KerryLynn1 !

I added mushrooms and doubled the potatoes. Had to add more milk and soup to compensate. I couldn't find calamari, so I added oysters and crawfish instead.

Merci this was good!   I used Parmalat real milk, GV real cream cheese, GV real Mushroom soup instead,  and everything else except for calamari tubes, which I could not source locally.    So, so...good.

Made this for a work food day today.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  I did use extra shrimp and crab as my store was out of scallops and calimari.

Ive made with a variety of seafood, but usually clams, haddock, shrimp, crabs and scallops. I just add haddock a few minutes longer than the rest. I also have used potato flakes near end instead of diced potatoes for a creamier texture.

This is a good base for a seafood chowder. However,to place an undesirable ingredient such as cream of mushroom soup is beyond my understanding. I wasn't about to waste good shellfish ,calamari, and cod. I made my own cream of mushroom soup,( takes only a few minutes) sauteed mushrooms in a bit of butter, 1 clove of chopped garlic,2 tablespoons of grated onion,a touch of sherry and half and half cream. I proceeded with the original ingredients, with full fat cream cheese,and half and half cream. I used frozen grilled corn from Trader Joe's,( again, I wanted the best tasting ingredients for the expense of the seafood).We had this for Christmas Eve and it was divine!

This is soooo good.  I have made it twice this month already.  I used some tips from others, using seafood medley.  I cut it into small pieces, added a slab of cod and some more shrimp and left out crab meat. (the shrimp in the medley are very small).  I used regular cream cheese and milk. I am on  special diet so I can't have potatoes or corn so left them out.  The second time I made it I did add a can of cream corn and a small can of corn.  It was awesome!  I will definitely be making it again and playing with the recipe each time differently.

I was skeptical when I saw 5 stars. It really is that good. I made 2 adjustments. One, I added half of the cayenne pepper. Two, I only had crab meat and shrimp. It was awesome.

I made this last night and will make it again. It was very hearty. I added one can of cream of mushroom with garlic soup. I also sauteed and seasoned the calamari, scallop, mussels, and shrimp, in butter, before adding them to the soup.

This chowder is delicious! I live in an area where some of the seafood ingredients are not readily available, so I had to omit the Calamari and scallops. I also left out the corn (more my forgetfulness than preference), and I added more shrimp to fill it out. I will definitely make this again, especially when I get my hands on some of the harder to find seafood.

Wonderful recipe! I made a few modifications - used scallops, shrimp, crab and clams (no calamari). regular onion instead of green, brown rice instead of potatoes, and left out the corn and carrots. All with excellent results!

Couldn't see the carrots and potatoes needing only 25 minutes to simmer before adding the seafood so sautéed them a little first. Also changed out the cayenne for Old Bay. Very tasty.

I'm not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe but my carrots and potatoes were still not cooked. I even did the last about 15 minutes more. I'm just now really getting into cooking so I didn't know what else to do. My boyfriend still liked it.

Simple and easy to customize - you can’t go wrong with this recipe! After reading countless reviews, my modifications include: begin by par-boiling the carrots and potatoes for 10 minutes, add additional cup of milk, omit corn and calamari, add pinch of thyme, reduce cayenne pepper to 1/8, and cut shrimp in half before adding them to chowder. This truly was delicious!

Fantastic recipe! The family loved every bit of it. I made some changes such as no corn or carrots. No fat free products but all whole products. One pound of shrimp, crab, and clams and I also added clam juice. I also added a lot more garlic and onions because of our love of the two. It had a wonderful seafood flavor and filling. I will definitely make again adding more seafood and a larger quantity. This was my first time making a chowder and definitely want be my last. Thank you for the great recipe!

Ok. This turned out great, but I did some things differently. Some in ingredients, some in technique. First, except for the milk I went all in with the full fat.

I first rendered about 6 sliced of cut up bacon. I left the fat in the pot and set the bacon aside.

I then lightly sauteed/sweated the vegetables first in the bacon fat, then added the garlic (3 cloves) and then spices for about a minute (I also added a heaping teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning) prior to adding a half cup Pinot Grigio to deglaze the pot. Only after that did I add in the milk and cream cheese. I also added a jar of clam juice. I did not use the corn water.

I used a full pound of shrimp and a full pound of cod, a pound of the scallops, and 8oz. jumbo lump crabmeat and the can of clams. No calimari.

I used the bacon for garnish.

I would advise folks to make sure they dice the potatoes and carrots to a relatively small size to ensure it cooks in a reasonable amount of time. I also made sure the fish were bite size.

Next time I will try the non-fat route.

My wife and daughter loved this.

Oh my word!!!!  We made this tonight and it was delish!!!  We just used shrimp, scallops and crabmeat.  We cut up 3 peeled red potatoes, no carrots, 2 cans of corn (drained), 5-6 cloves of garlic, used juice from a can of clams and substituted old Bay instead of parsley. 

Had some heat to it from the pepper but I wouldn't change it.  Excellent dish for a cold winter night in the Northeast.

The chowder came out amazing!  I made it for my parents and my nephew and they all loved it. My 5 yr old nephew is very picky too so him eating it all was very surprising. My parents said it was the best seafood chowder they’ve ever had. I made it exactly as the recipe shows, the only thing I did different was add Old Bay seasoning to it.

This is so good! I've made it a couple times and this time used canned clams and the juice, scallops and shrimp. Like the flavor but not a fan of the chewy clams. Definitely use raw scallops and shrimp otherwise they are a bit chewy. Also I just used a couple small cans of cream of mushroom soup.

The only change i made was replacing the calamari with more shrimp. I also added a little Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning for a little salty heat. My family and I enjoyed this as our traditional New Year's Eve seafood dinner. Thanks for sharing.

I probably shouldn't give this recipe a rating, since I so loosely followed it! But I wanted to use up a can of salmon & a can of crab meat I found in my cupboard, as well as about 4 cups of watered down milk from another cooking failure. I also had about 1/4 cup of cream cheese I wanted to get rid of. I found this recipe and used what I had, left out what I didn't have (potatoes, cream of mushroom soup, corn, other seafood, green onion). It was so good! I am sure if  you followed the original recipe, it would be out of this world!

I did not use cream of mushroom and I used regular cream cheese as well as added 2 Tbsp of butter. I also used 1 rib of celery and half a white onion but sauteed them ahead of time to soften them.  I only used imitation crab as the only seafood and left out the corn. Yeah I totally changed it up but I know what I like! As it simmered I added 2 Tbsp of lemon juice to cut the creaminess just a bit.

This was really good! I didn't add the clams or the cayenne for the kids and they liked it, but it was really rich for them! Next time I may thin theirs out a bit. I did add a bit of Bay Seasoning to just mine and that really kicked it up a notch for me! I will definitely make this again!

This came out delicious! I did make several substitutions though. I did not use any fat free products, just didn’t feel like watching my waist today! So, I used whole milk, and used chive and onion flavored cream cheese. Also subbed the soup for Campbell’s cream of mushroom with roasted garlic flavor. Used fire roasted corn flavor in the can. I also used halibut, shrimp, clams, and some imitation crab meat I had on hand. I ended up using a tad bit more cayenne pepper to give more of a kick, and a few more dashes of milk to thin things out throughout the cooking process. This all turned out to be very hardy and delicious. Don’t skimp on the ingredients! I used a little more of all the fillers, and the result was awesome.

This recipe has a great base to start the meal! While I don’t use calamari or bay scallops. I add an extra can of chopped clams with the juice from the clams, mussels, & lobster. And I always double the recipe so I have extra to freeze after!

2.  added extra diced mushrooms
3.  Added 14 oz. chicken broth
4.  Added 3 oz Clam juice
5.  added 1 onion
6.  Deleted celery
7.  Added 1 teaspoon Old bay
8.  Cooked garlic, onions, mushroom, carrot  in pan first
9.  used 1 1/2 cup of potatoes boiled 15 min while vegetables cooking.
10  added 8 oz. andouille sausage
11.  added lobster tails

Has just a little kick.  I would definitely make again

So delicious! I did not use canned clams, and instead used a raw clam, shellfish, shrimp, calamari, and crab mix. I also used about half the amount of carrots and added celery, substituted the milk for unsweetened almond milk, and full fat cream cheese. I'll definitely be making this again!

I am reviewing this at 2 stars only because the cook times and directions are WAY off.  I made it AS IS the first time and it REALLY SUCKS to lose $35 worth of ingredients, so I'm going to save you all the time and money.

First, there's no way potatoes and carrots are going to soften in a simmering (very thick!) chowder in 25 minutes.  In the pot that you will put everything in, sautee all of the veggies *EXCEPT THE CORN* for about 10 minutes.  Then add in the potatoes and carrots and enough chicken stock to cover.  Cover and when it begins to boil, set a timer for 5 minutes.

Then you can add everything else in as directed.

Too much pepper (and my hubby likes pepper). We couldn’t taste much else. I would agree with others reviewers that it could use some more flavor. Extra garlic, oyster or fish flavor, and NO cayenne pepper. We sprinkled on sharp cheddar & garlic powder. If I were to make it again, I might add salmon to improve the flavor.

This recipe was delicious!  I used 1% milk, low fat cream cheese and full-fat mushroom soup.  I also used different types of fish than those listed in the recipe.  The 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper provides a nice little kick to the soup, but may be too spicy for young children or those who don't tolerate spice well.  I recommend cutting the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.  or eliminating it completely.  I will definitely be making this again.

Decreased cream cheese to 5 oz., decreased garlic to 1tsp minced, added 2 celery stalks, seasoned with old bay, parsley, salt, black pepper,  and red pepper flakes.   Used salamon instead of calmari.

This turned out amazing!!! It didn’t last long at our house. The only thing I did differently was I used whipping cream instead of milk. I also added a can of chicken broth and used old bay seasoning instead of cayenne. It was so good. Can’t wait to make it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was my very first soup/chowder attempt. I couldn’t be happier with the result. I left out the calamari tubes, replacing them with more crab meat & shrimp. Following the directions and video made it easy and delicious.

Came out pretty good, but instead of crab meat I used crawfish and it was still awesome. I'm gonna try this again maybe with a little bit more potatoes.

This was a very easy recipe and very tasty.   I am extremely critical when it comes to the outcome of most recipes, but this was a hit.  I did add clam juice in lieu of some of the other liquids.

I've made this twice now. We love it.  I made it exactly like it says except I change the seafood.  I use shrimp,  canned crab,  smoked clams,  tilapia and calamari. I can't believe how creamy and flavorful it is considering how low fat it is. This is now a family regular!!

This chowder is everything you want a good chowder to be.  Rich, thick, creamy, and bursting with great textures.  I had to use a combination of fish and different seafoods due to allergies, but this is a great place to start.  I added some hot sauce and old bay to my bowl, but my BF preferred his just as it was.  This is a great base to customize so many personal flavor profiles.  It also warms up great in the microwave and freezes well.

Made some changes. Sauted yellow onion and garlic in butter instead of scallions.  Had to add more milk because it was too thick for me.  Didnt use squid or clams. Had to add some salt and seafood seasoning, it was a bit bland.  Very easy and not time consuming at all.  Best chowder recipe ive used thus far. Next time i think i will finish it with a squeeze of lime in the bowl.

I made this chowder and found the taste to be fantastic.  I did  change the type of seafood the recipe called for, I used shrimp and cod, but I kept everything else the same. It did not taste like fat-free  ingredients were used, which I found amazing. My husband and son absolutely loved it. I will make this again. Thank-you for sharing this receipe.

This is quite a good chowder. I did make some changes. I added pepper and salt, I doubled the garlic ( a matter of taste, I just like a chowder that has a lot of garlic) I added a bit more milk as I think it needed a bit of thinning out, and I didn't use calamari, just added a bit more scallops and shrimp. I found this chowder tasty and full of seafood. A lovely meal with crusty bread.

Easy awesome recipe!  I made it once and loved it. The second time I made a few changes for personal taste. My changes include frying up four slices of bacon (cut up) and sautéing a medium onion and the carrot (which I cut very small). I double up on the seafood and use cod instead of calamari. I also add two bottles of clam juice and half the corn juice.  Half the cayenne, my wife likes it less spicy. Two tablespoons of red cider vinegar right before serving. Picked that up from another recipe and I really makes a difference in the finished product. Other than that I keep to the recipe. Oh yeah, a splash of sherry to each serving.

Very good, I skipped the squid as I didn't have any. Use a heavy pot to make this and stir often to avoid scorching. Also precook the potatoes and carrots or you will wait forever trying to cook them tender.

This is likely my top used recipe on allrecipes.com.   I love clam chowder, but not the fat.  I normally go with Manhattan when out tp avoid the fat.  I have probably shared this recipe with more friends and family than any other.

Few points I believe others have said, but I do not use corn and I use carrots about 50/50 (I like carrots, wife doesn't).  I add more clams (with juice - using the juice to adjust for the consistency I want), scallops, "packed" crab (the in the seafood section - not "canned" but not quite true fresh either) and tilapia or imitation crab.  I the think the imitation crab makes the chowder visually more appealing but I like the taste of the fresh tilapia.  

I have preparing to have this chowder the day after Thanksgiving 2016!

Pretty good, but I refuse to add a can of soup to make soup.  Instead I added  a half stick of butter and a can of mushrooms.  The chowder was delicious.

I would have rated it 5 stars, but it should have stated how much salt it needs!  The vegetables and milk need some serious salt, otherwise it's very very bland.  I probably added a total of 3 tablespoons before it was all over.  Of course, just add a bit at a time and taste until it's just right.  I also preferred 2-3 teaspoons of cayenne instead of 1.  The garlic was also not noticeable until I doubled it.  I used all "full-fat" ingredients.  If nothing else, you must try a portion with a little red wine vinegar added!  I learned this from a clam chowder recipe on here, and it makes a huge difference.  Just put some of your chowder in a bowl, add a teaspoon or so of red wine vinegar, mix it up, and try it.  I bet you'll love it.

I didn't enjoy this recipe nearly as much as my family did. I didn't care for the carrots and found the flavors to be lacking. I much prefer AMYTHE's fish chowder recipe on your site and I couldn't figure out why, when it hit me: chicken or vegetable broth in addition to the milk would've made all the difference! Still, a good recipe. I would recommend adding clam juice, doubling the spices and omitting the carrot altogether.

This was unbelievable! We don't use real milk, so I bought fat-free half and half and used the full 2 cups, drained the whole kernel corn and added 8 oz. lobster juice. Reviews recommended adding clam juice, but when I saw lobster juice in the store.......

If you follow the recipe, you have a full 5 cups of seafood and full pot of chowder! Just add some crusty bread!

I made this using shrimp, canned clams and canned crab (it's what I had on hand).  I did forget the corn but otherwise I made it right to the recipe, except I added more chili powder.  We are from New Mexico and like our food hot and spicy.  Excellent recipe and will make this again!

I have made this several times and have changed up the types of seafood to suit what I have on hand and my family's taste.  Salmon is wonderful in this recipe.  My family loves this chowder; especially on cold winter nights.  We will continue to make this recipe over and over again!

Ever since coming back from our honeymoon at Ireland, hubby and I has been missing the great food there! This recipe is very easy to follow and makes great chowder! My only concern is that my pot is not big enough?? so I would make the chowder and store half of it before adding seafood to it. Taste great! If th seafood you get is fresh enough, I guarantee the flavor is as good as the ones we had in Ireland! Enjoy??

This was outstanding. We replaced the calamari with 2 small lobster tails, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. It was rich and creamy and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Can't wait to have it again!

I found & made this recipe to use some of the potatoes, carrots, corn (I also added a little turnip) from the garden.  As I was making this as a kid-centered meal, to save a few dollars I picked up a bag of assorted seafood at our local asian food store as well as addtl shrimp. The flavor was fantastic, I did add a bit more milk and a little chicken flavoring to taste, which balanced out the sweetness from the corn & the carrot. I will absolutely be making this again & wow a few adults next time =)

Family loved it. Used shrimp cut into bite size chunks and bay scallops . Added a can of drained crabmeat. Only had cream of chicken on hand for soup also increased minced garlic. I would suggest par boiling the potatoes a couple of minutes I wasn't sure they were going to get done so added chicken broth to thin.

Awesome!!! No one guessed I did this to use up some freezer burned scallops and shrimp.....I used clam juice and left out the corn and carrots. Put a bit more cayenne, and chopped up some day old scalloped potatoes instead of fresh ones. Served it with home made rustic bread for dipping. MY husband who has maritime roots says it was perfect, just like home....

I teach at a Catholic high school and made it for the entire faculty for the beginning of lent.  I had to double the recipe.  It made enough for about 20 people.  I substituted cayenne pepper with paprika and added a little Old Bay to enhance the flavor.  The soup turned out to be a huge hit as everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!!!

Excellent! This is a great base for chowder and extremely easy to make. The few changes I made were actually detrimental but the soup was still excellent. I had none of the seafood on hand but did have a salmon fillet sitting in my freezer that I think was there a little too long. Didn;t matter I ate it anyway. I didnt low fat nothing. Used half the cayenne pepper indicated but next time will go for all of it. I like spicy food. This base is so good it would be just fine with no seafood at all as a corn chowder with added potatoes and carrots. It really was great! Thanks for posting! Will make this again with the recomended seafoods or as I say just a corn chowder. Make a great clam chowder on its own as well I would think.

Seafood is hard to come by affordably in the mid-west so I used a frozen "seafood mix" with calamari, shrimp, mussels and octopus. Added 2 cans of chopped clams (with liquid) and omitted the corn water. Didn't have green onions so I sautéed yellow onion, carrots and potatoes first, set aside and then worked up the cream base. Added everything together and it was fantastic!! Going in the "definitely make again" file!!

Exclude calamari; double up on Shrimp; stir fried shrimp with garlic before adding; used Nuefchatel cheese instead of cream cheese; used 1% milk; used regular cream of mushroom soup; added a dash of sriracha sauce since we were low on cayenne pepper.

This chowder recipe was the best chowder recipe I've used by far.  The seafood chowder was rich, creamy and as we go into mid November with the cooler outside temps, this chowder was perfect for warming the belly and satisfying hunger.  I will definitely make this more often as my family loved it.

This is a very good recipe.  I have made it twice and was a hit both times.  I did use frozen corn and broth from canned clams in place of the canned corn liquid.  I also used side 1 lb of shrimp with can of crab and clams.

Good base recipe to work with!  Definitely needs more flavor if you are looking for a very seafoody chowder.  I added 8 oz of clam juice and cut the milk a little, and I also added leeks and a two tablespoons of butter to the initial sautée.  I will definitely make it again as it is very quick to throw together!  Trader Joes has a perfect seafood blend for this in their frozen section: calamari, shrimp, and scallops.

This was my first time attempting any seafood like chowder and it was AMAZING!!!! Absolutely to die for, full of flavor and super creamy. I used fresh scallops, calamari (half tube half tentacles) and 1 lb of canned crab flakes thus omitting the shrimp. This worked out since the can only came in a 1 lb size and it actually made it thicker and more "seafood flavored" which is something some of the other reviews wished it had. I also added watercress for some added texture, plus they are fun!

This chowder was very good.  It was my first attempt at making anything like this and my family loved it!  I did leave out the calamari and carrots, but added half a packet of onion soup mix, and some lobster.

An instant family favorite.  My kids loved it.  I have made it four times now.  I skip the calamari and clams and doubled up on bay scallops and crab meat.  I served this at a backyard cookout and it was gone very quickly.  Easy to prepare too.

My Dad loves seafood chowder, so this recipe has become a staple in our house. I double the recipe, and following some of the other reviewers, I use frozen corn instead of canned, use extra garlic, and use all the juice from the canned clams. I also add ~3 tbsp fish sauce (for a double recipe)  and paprika and garlic salt to taste. I use whatever seafood I have/what's on sale, but today's batch was particularly good: 2 cups thawed scallops, halved, 4 small haddock fillets, cubed, 1 can salmon, 1 can crab, 1 large can baby clams. Some shrimp would have been good too.

Great recipe. Used paprika instead of cayenne, subbed cod for calamari, added some old bay(about a 1/4 of a teaspoon), and a little salt to taste. Phenomenal and super easy. Definitely going to make again.

This recipe was super easy, hearty, & delicious!  I used the seafood I had on hand, which was some shrimp, crab, & some leftover grilled salmon.  The only thing I did do different was sauté the potatoes & carrots until they got a bit soft so they wouldn't take so long in the pot and added a healthy dash of Old Bay.  Will definitely make this again!

Very, very rich, creamy and flavorful. I did not use any of the ingredients "fat free," but went instead with full fat! The Cayenne really gives it a nice kick. I was skeptical about the Cream of Mushroom soup as an ingredient, but it really, really works.

I added salt to begin with(there was no salt in the recipe). Then added a bottle of clam juice. I loved the calamari addition and found frozen calamari tubes at the grocery store on sale, then just thawed and sliced them. Towards the end, after tasting,it still needed something so I added some Parmesan cheese and a little Velveeta (light), cooked until melted,which enhanced the flavor. Everyone loved it!

This was fabulous! Husband kept saying how good it was. Daughter was afraid to eat when saw me putting in the seafood, but loved it once she tried it. Will definitely be making again. Worth serving to guests!

I had this chowder at my son and daughter-in-law's house. It was awesome. My son made the soup and said it was a really simple recipe to put together.

My 3 guys are complaining that a single batch is not enough.
Marvelous recipe and I'll double or triple it next time.
I skipped the carrots and used a bag of frozen, mixed seafood.

Made this for dinner tonight and both my hubby and I went back for seconds.  Made a few minor changes based on other reviews and what I had on hand.  Plus I read the original recipe and thought it might be a little bland.  My version turned out very good… we'll certainly enjoy the leftovers for lunch this week.  I may make it again and keep "tweaking"; but I can't say I've found my ultimate seafood chowder recipe yet, so it gets 4 stars instead of 5.

The changes I made:
1.  I sautéed about a half cup each of finely chopped celery and sweet onion in about a tablespoon of butter with a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic.  I added this along with the vegetables.
2.  I used low fat cream cheese instead of fat free
3.  I only had one small can of cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted in an additional small can of cream of celery soup that I had on hand instead of more cream of mushroom.  (Have to mention that this yielded a pretty yummy veggie chowder before the seafood was added).
4.  Skipped the cayenne pepper and added about a tablespoon (maybe a little more) of Old Bay
5.  Traded the calamari for the conch I had in the freezer.

Other notes
*BE SURE TO USE ONLY LOW HEAT -- and you won't scorch anything and nothing will stick to the bottom of your pan!
*Finely dice the carrots and potato and they will cook fully -- it does take about 30-35 minutes on low heat, not the 25 in the recipe

I made a few seafood changes, but this was the most amazing lower fat chowder. I have ever made. I used shrimp, clams, mahi mahi, and bay scallops.

I cooked this last night. I used a marinara mix which included prawns, fish ( white & salmon pieces) & calamari, instead of the suggested seafood. It was very hearty. Allow, for more than 25 mins for the veges to cook. I used full cream milk & regular cream cheese, not low fat but it was not too rich. I would say if you're after a hearty meal, this quantity is more suitable for 4-5 people or if it's just as an entrée, it would serve 8. Overall, everyone was very happy with the meal.

This is a keeper! Changed up seafood... no clams but a mix of salmon, haddock, scallops, shrimp and crab flavored pollock... very colorful! Used wild mushroom soup. It was delicious! Will definitely make again and again!

My family really enjoyed this soup.  I will definitely make it again.  I left out the calamari because I didn't have any.  Next time I will add celery, leave out the cayenne pepper, and put a meaty white fish or salmon in.

Yum, very easy and tasty. I only used calamari and substituted salmon for the rest of the fish.. I had some in the freezer. I also added a little extra cayenne. I'm glad we have leftovers for tomorrow!

Great recipe. I made some changes: I put chopped mini red potatoes with skins left on and diced carrots and onions in a pot that I had just fried small pieces of bacon. I drained the bacon fat and removed the bacon pieces and set aside. I added four tablespoons of sherry and steamed the veggies in it. When the veggies were a bit cooked, but still quite firm, I added a can of low sodium New England clam chowder and two tablespoons of light cream cheese. Meanwhile, in a frying pan, I put three tablespoons of butter and cooked on low heat haddock, previously frozen jumbo shrimp, salmon, and a bit of lobster and scallops. Cooking the seafood a bit in butter exaggerates the seafood flavour. I added 1% milk to the large pot and added chopped dill, parsley, the cayenne and my secret ingredient that a chef told me about: Pernod. Just a capful. Incredible. Nova Scotia Seafood Chowder - delicious. Note: no corn was added.

Quick dinner and a perfect base for a great chowder, you can adjust to your taste. I made it as specified except for the carrots and shrimp (husband forgot them at the store). We loved it. Now to adjust for our taste to make it even better I will add smoked salmon. Just to add a little more flavor. But no complaints. I had this dinner done in 45 minutes with lots of relaxing time. That is my kind of dinner!

Absolutely love this. My boyfriend has never liked a chowder in his life but now has me making this once a month. We substitute lobster instead of calamari and it's delicious. We also add the clam juice along with the water from the corn because otherwise it's a little too thick.

This recipe was wonderfully easy to make.  I skipped the clams and calamari and added some paprika and salt.  It wasn't the most flavorful chowder I've ever had, but I like finding recipes that need some tweaking, so this is perfect!

AWESOME! I love, love, love seafood! I used minced onion instead of chopped green onion. I upped the shrimp to 1 lb and also added 1 can of crab meat, 14oz. lobster (2 lobster tails worth) canned whole oysters, and 1 swai fillet cubed. I left out the calmari. I also added about an extra 1/2 cup of milk. This was so good, I impressed myself! lol My husband loved it as well, but requested that I delete the oysters and maybe add more shrimp. Highly recommend this recipe.

Very Delicious.  I separated the clams from their juice and included that in the broth beginnings.  I halved the carrots, and nixed the squid, but incorporated some more crab and clams to compensate.

I love this chowder and this recipe is a keeper!  It's very creamy and hearty even though it is low in fat. The only changes I made is I added a can of oysters with the liquid and left out the calamari. I also added a little bit of curry powder and Old Bay seasoning based on another review. I forgot to add the corn, but we didn't miss it.  I'll add it next time but really don't know if it's needed. It's very simple to make and look forwrard to having it again!!

Didn't have all the ingredients but modified it a bit and it was great.  Used onions and chives instead of green onions.  Used twice as much shrimp and scallops instead of calamari and crab meat.  Didn't use as much cream of mushroom.

Great recipe and very easy to prepare. I omitted the corn and added clam juice. I also added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay. The next time, I will also cut the amount of black pepper in half. My family loved this dish.

Great and easy recipe base! I added way more meats and potatoes though.  I ended up using a pound of shrimp, 5 cans of whole/chopped cans, and more veggies in order to make this a very filling and hearty meal. I left out the calamari, scallops and crabmeat since they cost more than I felt would add to the recipe. My wife and roomate loved it.  Would be five stars however, I adjusted the recipe not warranting it.

Loved it!  Made a double batch - 1 with neufchatel cheese and the other with low fat cream cheese.  My decision to make this came when I was cleaning my freezer out and found 2 lbs of sea scallops.  Unfortunately the scallops were bad so I substituted  2 lbs shrimp, 1 lb crabmeat and a 51 oz Costco container of chopped clams.  I divided all seafood among both batches.  I also used the clam juice from the can...divided.  It made the chowder a bit thinner, which also extended the servings.  
I ended up simmering the soup mixture close to one hour (before adding the seafood) because my husband was running late for dinner and I didn't want to overcook the seafood.   It turned out great!

Excellent recipe! I did some changes with what I had at home, for instance, instead of milk, I heated water and added coffee creamer, which made it rich (in lieu of milk, cream cheese and mushroom soup). I added canned salmon, fresh squid and grouper and shrimp. Also white flour as a thickener. This recipe was my foundation and inspiration.. Thanks for providing it! :)

This is a MUST TRY!  Used half and half instead of milk (don't shoot me) and used shrimp and clams as the seafood.  Had leftover zucchini and yellow squash so chopped them up as well and used Cream of Potato Soup because I was lazy.  Too yummy!!!!  Perfect!  Super good.

I modified this a tad. I fried some Pancetta bacon with galric and a shallot first and threw potatoes in thinly sliced with a 1/4 cup of chicken broth to soften potatoes up.  I omitted the scallops used a seafood medley and added a full can of clams. I used a cup of 1% milk. and threw a chopped lobster tail in for last 10 mins. This was a huge hit.
Very rich but didn't give you the iron gut feeling after. Thanks for the lower fat recipe! I never thought I would make chowder without the cream!

The cayenne was too much for my taste and I cut it down to 3/8 tsp.  Like many others, I used frozen corn and added a bottle of clam juice.  Used salad shrimp, imitation crab and 2 cans of chopped clams w/juice.  This might work well in a slow cooker.  I had to stack two stove grates on top of one another so as not to burn the bottom of the pan.

Loved it! And so did my kids!! I did alter it a little but the base of this recipe is great.

Here's what I added (sorry, I didn't measure; just did it to flavor):
packet of Swanson Flavor Boost Chicken flavor
half & half
more milk
diced tomatoes
more black pepper, onion & garlic powder, paprika & Creole seasoning

I sauted the veggies and used a premix seafood bag that I pre-thawed.
It turned out great! I will definitely make this again. Hope it works for you!

No so good. Just tasted like spiffed up canned soup, and the calamari made it very fishy.

Very good, but needed modifications.  I add much more milk as it seemed overly thick, I used skim milk and no fat 1/2 and 1/2 which made it much creamier. 
Also added roasted garlic (whole head), 2 cans of corn, extra potato's and carrots, shallots and instead of all the seafood I used 2 lbs of fresh carolina shrimp and two cans of clams.  Next time I will add more clams and the juice with the clams.  Very easy but you really need to watch it so it doesnt boil.  Husband and picky 13 yr old son ate it up.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my family and they loved it. However, I did leave out the carrots and potatoes (only because I was making it for my 8 and 11 year old and they didn't want that it there). I would make again.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  It is also delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I substitute lobster for the calamari and put in less cayenne pepper, but otherwise follow the ingredients exactly.  I would suggest to start with less cayenne pepper and add as needed  LOVE IT.

My local grocery store did not sell everything, so we ended up with a few things different.  One thing was the calamary. They only had steaks, so I cut them in to strps and it was wonderful.   I could not find scallops this time either, so I just added more shrimp.

Excellent! I put crab and scallops in the chowder and added a can of cream of shrimp, fresh, potatoes, and carrots. I boiled the carrots and potatoes to soften them up before adding them to the chowder. I also added a can of cream of potato soup because my BF likes it really hardy.

This was the best Seafood Chowder I've had since eating it in Alaska. I omitted the calamari tubes and that is the only change I made. This will be made many times in the future.

Made this today...followed others reviews and used less of the peppers (although my husband added them in his bowl after it was done) I used frozen corn so I used a jar of clam juice (8oz) I also added 1/2 cup white wine and some old bay seasoning. My husband likes seafood but is not much of a soup fan.....I can honestly say he just scarfed down 2 good sized bowls and said how good it was several times. Kids wouldnt touch it....but they are fussy!

Very tasty and well received by the family.  I added some extra milk to thin it a bit but in hind sight would have added less or none at all.  I used fresh scallops, leftover lobster, and fresh cod.  I couldn't find any canned clams but in the future would use them over the corn.

WOW! This is sooooo good!! We added more garlic because we LOVE garlic. But this is a great almost fat-free recipe!!! It was a little too spicy for me though (I'm a wimp) so I might decrease the black or cayenne pepper.

This recipe is AMAZING!  Perfect for lent.  I made this for our church group during lent and it was a huge hit.  I made it the original way the first time and then have added and taken away some ingredients.  Very easy! TIPS:  added 1 jar of clam juice, added 1 can of cream of shrimp and 2 of cream of mushroom, took away the crabmeat (due to allergy) and the calamari (couldn't find it)

Being from maine and living right on the coast we have seafood chowder a lot. This is very good. It definitely has a taste that is different from what I am used to but it's a good taste. I am pretty sure it was the cream cheese and the sweetness from the carrots. My husband really enjoyed it. Thanks

This chowder is awesome. I'd omitted the carrots but everything else I"d added.    This is a definite keeper.

This chowder was very tasty.  However, next time I will cut back on the amount of cayenne pepper.  Using fat free ingredients makes for a good guilt free option.

This is delicious. I took the recommendation to add white and clam juices. I found that I needed a lot more milk to accommodate how much seafood this recipe calls for. But that should be something you can just eyeball.

This is very, very good.  I had to sub octopus for clams, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My whole family agreed that this is a five star recipe- thank you so much, MVM.

This recipe was AWESOME! I made it for my family and everyone raved for the rest of the night how wonderful it was. I was shocked at how good it came out. My only recipe modifications was I did half the cayenne pepper wich was good because boy the amount I put in had a wicked kick to it. Then I substituted 1/2 the corn juice and replaced it with the clam juice. I have been ordered to make this more often. I have requests from family coming back up at christmas time to make it again! Awesome Awesome Awesome recipe!

It's a chilly rainy night and this seafood chowder recipe along with some homemade brown bread was amazing!  I have to say I did make a few adjustments.  I took out the calamari tubes because I don't like them and added clam juice instead of the liquid that was in with the corn.  I also added some red pepper flakes and thyme.  I love the flavor of thyme with seafood and it was perfect in this recipe.  Next time I make this I will add more clams and clam juice as well as some haddock.  I think the haddock will add a really nice texture and flavor.  Lastly, I made the chowder as I was making bread so I let the chowder simmer for quite some time, I think this helped with the flavors and textures of the seafood.  Wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

I did an ingredient search to use up some frozen shrimp and scallops and found this recipe - so glad I did!  I found it fairly simple and impressive.  I omitted the calamari and crabmeat, used 1/2 lb each frozen shimp and bay scallops, can of chopped clams and a can of lobster (won't use this again, as it was pricey and just ok).  No 26 oz cans of the soup at my grocery store, so I bought (3) 10 oz cans and used most of it - 2 cans mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken by accident, but it was good.  Since the recipe called for green onions, I processed the white parts and cooked in a bit of butter then added about a 1/2 C of white wine and let that reduce before adding the other ingredients.  Based on the comments here, I did steam the potatoes and carrots for about 8 minutes before adding them to the soup.  It took awhile to come to a simmer, but once it did, it was tough to keep it from sticking, I'll keep a closer eye next time, but there were no ill effects from the sticking.  I used neufchatel cheese, fat free half, Old Bay & a cup frozen corn. I used about half of the cayenne as I can't handle anything very spicy.  I am not a fan of "fishy" soups and was making more for my husband and to use up some stuff in the freezer but I thought was excellent and my husband enjoyed it as well.  Next time I will try it w/ the crabmeat and look for some good oyster crackers to go w/.  Thanks!

Out of this world!  For once, I didn't add anything extra (but I did omit the scallops and calamari).  Served this for guests, and everyone raved about it!  Will definitely make this many more times!
