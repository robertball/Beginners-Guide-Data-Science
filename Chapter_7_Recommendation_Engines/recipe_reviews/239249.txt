No chipotle for Hubs' sensitive innards so a good seasoning blend filled in nicely, and I found duck fat a tasty alternative to the corn oil. Watch cooking time carefully, as it will vary according to the size of the potato.  Mine were cooked in 10 minutes, and then required only 20 minutes or so in the oven. Rather than smashing the potatoes with a spatula, I used a potato masher.

These were very tasty!! The Mazola corn oil seems to add a richness to this that vegetable oil doesn't. I used ground chipotle powder instead of canned because I had it on hand. I just whisked about 2 tsp. in with the corn oil and brushed on the top and bottom of the potatoes. They are kind of spicy, but so delicious!

This is a new favorite dish in my house! The flavor of the crisp Chipotle is out of this world. I recommend that you use medium sized potatoes.  I have plenty left over and plan to use them for a mexican theme brunch this weekend!

We loved this, however, I did omit the chipotles.  Just used the sea salt and a bit of pepper.  Really good.  Served with lemon/garlic asparagus and filet mignon recipe from Skinnytaste.

These are my families new favorite potatoes! I used a mini food processor instead of a blender with no issues. You just need to slowly add the oil a little at a time. I also used a silicone brush to make sure potatoes were well coated.

I love these potatoes, I got something similar at a restaurant and have been making these nonstop, the awesome flavor of the Mazola corn oil as opposed to olive and the spice was perfect! I put the potatoes on a cookie sheet with water and cover with foil to steam them at 450 for 30 minutes instead of boiling.  Will make this again and again

I had some fingerling potatoes in my fridge that I didn't know what to do with. I saw this recipe and checked for canned chipotles in adobo sauce and bingo! I made this for a spicy breakfast and it doesn't disappoint! This was an easy recipe, too. I'll be making these again and again. I'll probably change it up and add some different spices too, just to keep things interesting. Thanks Mazola!

Excellent recipe! These stay crispy outside but tender and fluffy inside. My family gobbled them up. Put this in your keeper recipe file.

Had the potatoes that needed to be cooked but not chipotles but decided to use the recipe anyway.  Followed recipe for boiling and smashing the potatoes, simple enough, but used a sriracha salt and black pepper rather than chipotle sauce.  Only change I would make is to salt the boiling water.  Potatoes definitely needed salt and will use recipe again.

We wanted more Chipotle zing, so we served these with Chipotle sour cream... 7 oz. Chipotles in Adobo diced or blended smooth and stirred into a pint of sour cream. Very spicy! Be warned.

I used baby golds and my oh my these were tasty! I tried to take a short cut by sticking the oil/chipotle mix in my mini food processor instead of digging out my blender but it never fully blended (my fault) that way. You could really taste the richness of the corn oil in this recipe and the amount of heat was perfect for us. I will be making these often...YUM

This is a fantastic recipe!  So simple, yet so good!  I used 2.5 lbs. of "Ruby Sensation" potatoes and doubled the oil and chiles.  Baked for 40 minutes.  Served with "Best Grilled Pork Chops" from this site, for a perfect pairing.  Thanks for this great recipe, Mazola!

Oh my goodness these are so good. These taste like crispy fries on steroids. Cooking to deep brown and crisp is a must. The chipotle turns a dark brown but it is not burnt.

Not sure how much chipotle in adobo sauce was used but it was to much.  The concept is good so we decided we'll try with very little chipotle.  We also want to try doing this with marg on the bottom, smashed potato, then put some lightly cooked bacon & final 10 min top with cheese.  We did put a little sour cream over the chipotle potatoes to calm down the heat some which helped.  I think hubs used a good size chipotle pepper which when diced up to put in blender may have been more than 1 1/2 tsp.

OMG!  These are the best.  A must try, especially if you like a kick to your potatoes.  They are actually FUN to make too!
