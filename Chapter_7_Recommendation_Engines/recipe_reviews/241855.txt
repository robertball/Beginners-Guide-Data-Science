This recipe is a really great idea and the cheese mixture is such a delicious addition. One note however: I would suggest cooking the pasta separately and serving it into each bowl; cooking it with the soup AND simmering for a half hour tends to make the pasta a bit mushy. Regardless, this one's a family favourite!

This is a great, easy alternative to the more labor intensive lasagna. It's a staple in our house now, everyone loves it! I don't typically use the cheese mixture at the end unless I happen to have ricotta on hand... It doesn't need it, but it is very good with it!  The last time I made it I didn't have any fresh basil on hand and, while it was still delicious, it was definitely better with basil!

We really liked this recipe! My sons couldn't believe how much it tasted like lasagna. The cheesy yum is really tasty and adds a nice flavour.
I only had 4 sausages that weighed 3/4 lb so I halved the recipe.
I added a yellow pepper, used salt free chicken broth, 1 tsp dried basil as I didn't have fresh and omitted the salt.
I knew there was not going to be enough liquid to cook the pasta in, I added 2 cups spaghetti sauce and 2 cups water.
I had a 375 gram box of Fusilli pasta that I used which is 13 ounces approximately. I needed to add 2 more cups of water while the pasta was cooking.
For future reference I liked the meat to pasta ratio with the 4 sausages and 375 g box of pasta. I would definitely add more vegetables like peppers, mushrooms and zucchini. In total I used 3 cups chicken stock, 2 cups spaghetti sauce and 4 cups water, I would probably add 1 more cup of water as it was really like a stew and I think the leftovers will be quite thick tomorrow. I feel the tbsp of tomato paste is really a waste and I would omit it and just use the spaghetti sauce instead. I really liked the flavour the fire roasted tomatoes added, I had never used them before.

Made for daughters b-day.  Never even heard of this before, but that  was what she wanted. Served with salad and crusty garlic bread.  All through the meal no one spoke. Just 'mmm', 'yum' and 'oh my'. There was barely enough for her to take home for a lunch it was so good! Our new favorite get together meal...:)  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Made in slow cooker exactly as written and it was fabulous! Cooked sausage in skillet, put all in slow cooker except cheeses and pasta. Four hours on high. When done add mozarella, ricotta and parmesan. Cooked broken up lasagna noodles until al dente and added at end. Everyone loved it!

Delicious! Especially after a couple of days. I used mild Italian sausage. I would wait to add the spinach (or any green) until you are ready to serve. I also used the little lasagna shaped pasta. Got it from Amazon but you could use most any pasta

Used a bit more pasta - teenage daughters loved that!  Also a bit more spinach. Delicious. Will definitely make it again.

I made with a few minor changes. I used veggie broth instead of chicken, a full 12 oz box of gluten free rotini, 2lbs of Italian Sausage and I doubled the cheesy yum. The flavor was great and my family enjoyed this soup (to their surprise,lol)

I used 8 cups of chicken broth since there wasn't enough liquid for my personal taste.  It came out pretty good.  I will bet that it will taste better tomorrow when the flavors have a chance to blend together.

Good flavor, but I think next time I will make with ground beef instead of sausage. I don't think the cheese mixture really added anything special. May just add ricotta to the soup next time (small amount).

This is a very tasty soup!  I used 2 lbs. of sausage, about 5 tbsp. of tomato paste,  added 2 extra cups of chicken stock and used the entire 16 oz. box of rotini pasta as I prefer to have a lot of noodles in my soup.  It was delicious!  The cheesy yum is good, but I probably wouldn't bother to make it next time.  Shredded mozzarella or a dollop of ricotta would be sufficient and easier.  This will definitely be a new staple in our household!

This soup is fabulous.  Only had 1 pound of sausage so I added 1 pound of ground chuck.  I added some thyme and dried basil [no fresh on hand].  Cooked the pasta separately and then added to soup.  My soup was very thick so I added a little V-8 juice.  The cheesy yum puts it over the top.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was sooo good. Was perfect for us, as my husband does not like cheese. So I just left it out of his bowl. Will make this again!

I have this recipe from a different source and have made it many times.  It's been awhile and my teenage daughter just requested it.  It tastes like lasagna in a bowl.  I always cook my noodles separate from the soup though just to keep them from getting too soggy and I think the leftovers store better with them separate.  The "cheesy yum" takes this to a new level!

My husband said "it's the bomb!"

  I didn't have Italian sausage so I just used country sausage but it didn't seem to matter.   I added some extra seasonings to make sure it had enough Italian flavor.   I also didn't use the ricotta.  I didn't want to make it too cheesy as I loved the taste of the broth.  I also boiled my noodles separate so that it wouldn't soak up all my broth.  My family loved it.  We will certainly be making this again and again.
