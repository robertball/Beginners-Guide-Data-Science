Fabulous! This was my first attempt at a German Chocolate cake, I kind of expected it to be a little more complicated but this was easy. I had to use the milk and vinegar substitute for the buttermilk because I forgot to bring my list to the store and of course forgot the buttermilk :( It worked fine. I used butter in both the cake and the frosting since I never have margarine. I also made some chocolate frosting for the sides of the cake, I didn't have enough of the coconut frosting but I think that is because I'm a little heavy handed with frosting. My family was sad when this cake was gone and there was a fight over the last piece ( I won! ) Thanks for the great recipe, its a keeper.

Way more work than what it is worth. Also there is a recipe inside the pkg of Baker's German Sweet Chocolate that is almost exactly the same and less tedious. I agree w/ other reviewers who say it is not chocolate enough. The one inside the candy bar's pkg tastes more chocolately, more than likely because they use 1/2 c less flour. They have you melt the chocolate in the butter instead of water (water dilutes, butter enhances). So there is a not the dilution of the water in the cake. Also in the pkg directions you don't have to separate the eggs and beat the egg whites stiff, just add the eggs. Candy bar's recipe tastes better and is less work.
(To be honest, this is so close to the candy bar recipe it seems like a lightly modified knock-off.)They make it into cupcakes but just use cake pans instead. The frosting recipe is the same as this one too. I also agree that you have to do the frosting plus 1/2 to barely have enough to do a cake. The candy bar's package gives you more frosting for it does it as 1.5 of this recipe.

GREAT recipe!  The cake was moist and delicious and the frosting amazing!  I've made many other types of chocolate cakes from scratch but this was my first German Chocolate cake.  Rave reviews from all our guests who shared it with us.  Thank you.

Great Cake! My brother doesn't like cake at all, but he has always loved German Chocolate cake.... so he knows when it's good and he loved this cake and frosting. As did everyone else. It was super light, fluffy and moist (don't overcook it even a little). I made 36 cupcakes and they were amazing. You do need to cook the frosting and stir for 10-12 minutes, but I thickened it too much because as it cooled it got much to thick especially after adding the nuts and coconut flakes. To correct for this just add SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK and a little real milk until it brings it to the consistency you can spread. I would suggest when you are heating the sauce for the frosting you should stop cooking it whenever you notice it no longer falls immediately back into place when you move your spoon through the sauce. This will be close to 9-12 minutes depending on your stove. Remember, as it cools it will get even firmer. Other than my learning curve, this recipe is an ABSOLUTE WIN and I am using it anytime I need German chocolate cake!

Delicious cake and recipe was easy to follow! I love to bake but am somewhat of a beginner and this recipe was straightforward and easy to follow! The frosting came out great. I know my husband will love it for his birthday!

**Edited based on making this again as cupcakes :)...Everyone raved about this cake - I've never made it before and I think it came out great.  I wanted my frosting to cover it entirely, so ended up with little bare spots around the edges that I filled in with chocolate frosting ("Creamy Chocolate Frosting" by Tracy on this website). The frosting is only meant to cover the top and in between layers so make more if you want it to be more rich and/or have more full coverage....I've since made this again as cupcakes! I've posted a picture of them.  I followed the recipe to a 't'. Did not make any modifications and again received RAVE reviews! People went out of their way to tell me how great they were....To make them into cupcakes I filled the paper cake cups to about 2/3-3/4 full, and baked at 350 for about 18 minutes. You know they are ready when the tops look porous like sponges and the edges get just a little bit brown. Also, use a toothpick :) I was able to make 24 cupcakes out of this recipe, and the coconut frosting was the perfect amount for them. I used my same chocolate frosting to fill in around the edges.

Great cake. Made it for my husband on our anniversary. I substituted some of the boiling water with some coffee. I would strain the frosting mixture over a colander in case you accidentally cook some of the egg (like I did).

The recipe looks complex but is so worth it! I'm not a very experienced baker so was a bit worried but followed the instructions to the letter and it came out perfect :)

Just a note: the picture contains butter icing not in the recipe on the sides. Budget a bit of exra marge, icing sugar and cocoa for that :)

I have made this recipe for years. It was my husband's favorite and I made it every year for his Birthday.  The original German Chocolate cake is only meant to use the frosting between the layers and on top.  There is no frosting on the sides. The idea of putting chocolate frosting on the sides is fabulous. I have had it this way before and loved it.  Either way it is a top notch cake for any occasion.

Cake came out great. I don't know if it was me, but it could use a little more sugar. Also greasing the pans are a necessity because I lost a layer due to under greasing. Another tip to cool off the frosting is to refrigerate it so its easier to spread! Third time making this and will continue to do so!!

This is very close to the original Baker's Chocolate German chocolate cake. You can't go wrong with this fabulous cake but I have to admit I like the original better.

Only thing I could add is I wish it made more frosting and less cake. I just never saw the point in a 3 layer cake.  I made only 2 layers and used the rest of the batter for cupcakes for my kids as they do not eat pecans or coconut.  Even with just 2 layers I would have liked more icing.

I made this recipe three times.  My brother said the first time the cake was an eight and the icing was a 10.  By the third time, it was moist, and perfect.  Thank you, it's wonderful as is.  One hint:  I added coffee instead of water to the chocolate mix.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Also, I iced the cake when it was still a little warm, then stuck it in the fridge.  It went to a party, and it was a hit.  My Aunt said it was better then my grandma's, and trust me, my grandma is cursing me in heaven right now because she was the best cook on the face of the earth.

Great Recipe
 
I made this cake for my Dad and Step-Father for Father's Day, they both loved it and gave it rave reviews. I will make this cake again. By the way I made no changes followed the recipe exactly.

Loved it. I made it for classmates and turned out brilliantly. Takes a long time to make, but very well worth it!! I didn't have three pans, as it turned out, so I used two instead, and that was awesome, because I got double the amount of frosting AND cake!!! I also added a little brown sugar and cinnamon to taste in the frosting too, which was nice, and added a few peach slices on top for decoration. :):):) 
You should surely try it. It was fantastic!!

My first time making German chocolate cake. I don't particularly care for it but my hubby does and always wants one for his birthday.  This recipe was a hit!! He loved it! I have to say the icing was really good-so much better than store bought, ready-made icing.  I had to use vinegar and milk substitute for buttermilk. It worked fine.

First time to use this recipe, followed it according to the measurements and directions. I doubled the icing and used all of it but I love German chocolate icing. My coworkers loved it! I loved it! Will I make it again? Glad you asked... I'm making it right now. This time I'm attempting to half the recipe and making cupcakes.

This is without a doubt one of the best cakes I have ever made. I have gotten rave reviews on it and it is going into my favorite recipes book. Everybody always seem to want to add this change or that change to recipes, the only change I made was I used butter instead of margarine. I didn't change the icing recipe but I used my microwave to make it because I didn't like the idea of having to stir it for 12 minutes. Microwave for 8 minutes on 80% power if you choose to do that. Stop every couple of minutes to stir it, turned out perfect. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that is going to be a family favorite for genertations to come.

I made this cake for my team at the local hospital, and it was fantastic. I actually used butter instead of margarine and "accidentally" used 2 1/2 sticks for the cake batter, but it turned out way better than expected. Thank you again for the recipe, everyone loved it.

This was a labor intensive, but well worth it cake.  it was moist and flavorful, I added 2 tanks cold coffee with the water, I think this added a nice note.

Excellent recipe.  Like many of you, I read the reviews before I jump in and the three tips that helped made this cake a standout were 1) to make extra filling - I made one and a  half times the recipe 2) toast the nuts and coconut first and 3)ice the sides with a chocolate frosting.  Other than that, I followed the recipe except for using a lemon juice/milk substitute for buttermilk but made sure that I was  using the correct type of chocolate- resulted in a very light sponge. The happy result was a deliciously lovely and huge birthday cake for my daughter who had wistfully requested a pecan pie wedged in a chocolate cake. She was delighted!

I made this for a party and it turned out great! Followed the directions to a T except I did add a generous tablespoon of cocoa to the flour mixture. I separated the yolks and whites as called for and I think it adds a certain lightness to the cake. I always figured if it was good enough for grandma who am I to question? Baking takes time and if you don't have the time, make something else or buy it at the store. No need for snarky comments.

I also used Tracy's creamy chocolate frosting on the sides to really make it sharp. Many thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best German Chocolate cake! - I agree with the other reviewers to double the frosting - I've made this several times and anytime I ask what cake I should make, this is always the request.  This even works at high altitude with no changes.  Making it today, at my husband's request, for his parents!

This was such a good cake. It is my step-moms favorite so me and my aunt made it for her birthday. Everyone loved it. I can't wait to make it again. My aunt says she will make it again herself. And i disagree with it not being chocolatey enough. It was more chocolatey than any other German chocolate cake I've ate. The frosting was really goo too.

This is a great tasting cake.  In terms of taste only, I would rate this recipe with 5 stars.  However, because of the trouble this cake is to make, I'm only rating it with 4 stars.  I am not new to cake baking and enjoy cooking and baking very much.  This recipe is a bit more "fussy" than my usual cake recipes (for example, having to separate the eggs), and the icing was not as easy as it seemed.  I was careful not to thicken my icing TOO much, for fear it would not spread well.  Perhaps I didn't thicken it enough, since it slid down the sides of my cake.  The finished product looked quite messy.  I think if I bake this cake again, I may make it as a sheet cake instead.  The photo another reviewer posted with chocolate icing on the sides also seems like a good alternative.

This was also my first attempt at German Chocolate Cake from scratch.  It turned out so moist.  I will say that the frosting wasn't enough.  It's a good thing that I was moved by the picture and frosted the sides with chocolate frosting.  Next time I may double the frosting.  Great recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

One of the best German Chocolate cakes I've ever eaten; my coworkers all also agreed! Great recipe! Thank you!
I used the coconut frosting in between 2 layers and on the very top, then frosted the sides of the cake with a homemade butter and brown sugar frosting. Amazing!

I just made this today and from the little tastes I got from bits of cake and icing while I was assembling it, I think it’s going to taste awesome! This is my first attempt at a German Chocolate cake and I’m hoping it’ll be a hit at our surprise for my friends today. The only thing I changed is I made 1 1/2 times the frosting bc other reviews said there wasn’t enough frosting. When I make it again, I’ll at least double the frosting recipe.

I made the recipe as is but unfortunately the frosting slide off the sides. I don’t know what I did, but how do you keep the frosting on the sides? Also, I had to double the recipe for frosting to cover the cake layers and on top. Needed more to try to do the sideS.

This was the recipe on the Baker's German chocolate that my mom has always used, and now I always use.  It turns out the best ever!  Small addition....Mom and I use a piece of tooth floss or fishing wire to cut the rounds in half and we put the coconut frosting between the rounds also!

I just made this cake for my brother-in-laws' birthday. We all loved it.  Making the cake is time consuming. The two hours start to finish time is not a mistake, it's real. However, the steps are simple and easy to follow. I made no changes to the recipe except that I made two cake rounds rather than three, and they baked at 40 minutes. No issues. I also made extra icing based on other comments that stated the recipe is insufficient to cover the entire cake.  I will make this recipe again.

Don't attempt if you do not have parchment paper.  Taste is good but it won't come out of the pan no matter how much you butter and flour it.  Tastes good if you don't mind eating cake crumbs out of a bowl.

This is indeed an excellent recipe except that the frosting needs to be doubled. I only had two 9" pans and so made a two layer rather than three. I made an extra 1/3 of the icing and I could not frost the sides. Mind you, it still worked and looked nice.

Also, I cut 1/4 cup of sugar from the cake and used unsweetened coconut. For our family it was plenty sweet. 

I used butter and I don't touch margarine. ;-0

This is a time consuming recipe, but if you love German Chocolate Cake, it is well worth the effort.

I hate to leave a bad review, but I also hate not to leave an honest one when I chose this recipe because it was so highly rated. We didn't like this cake at all.  It didn't have enough chocolate in it (pretty tasteless), and there wasn't nearly enough icing - especially for a layer cake. I doubled the icing recipe and still felt like it could have used more.

Followed the recipe exactly, this is the best German chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted. If I make it again I may try some adjustments for convenience sake but I think it’s important to follow the recipe the first time. The cake was light and fluffy, not overly sweet. I could not for the life of me find 8 inch cake pans so I used 9 inch pans and added 25% more ingredients and it was perfect.

Love the 3 layers for a birthday cake and this one looks very special!  I like plenty of frosting so I increased the ingredients 1.5 times to have plenty of frosting between the cake layers and on top!

This recipe is AWESOME!  So moist and full of flavor, absolutely incredible.  I made my own buttermilk by adding 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to milk so I didn't have to go grocery  shopping to make it up.  Definitely will make again!

I baked in a bundt pan. 30” was too short but 45” was too long. Delicious chocolate flavor is a perfect match for this frosting. Frosting was not enough to cover the cake. Next time will make 1 1/2 frosting recipe. Canned milk contains the perfect amount for 1 1/2 recipe.

I only used this for the frosting recipe. I used a different cake recipe (the one using a boxed mix and sweetened condensed mix and I used buttermilk instead of water).
Served this at the Shaw Family B&B. Will definitely make this again. Used brown sugar instead of white. Cooked for 12 min.

It turned out great! I made it gluten-free with Cup4Cup all-purpose baking flour, and it was delicious. A little sweeter than I was aiming for, but certainly great tasting.

This exact same recipe for German Chocolate Cake became legendary in my family, starting back in the 1960's, and now still to this very day. (The version that came to us called for all butter and folding in 7 stiff egg whites into the cake batter instead of the 4)
What I really want to share is the German Chocolate frosting recipe that came with the cake recipe all those decades ago. This frosting has German Chocolate in it and is absolutely scrumptious. Frosting--in the top of a double boiler, combine--12 ounces half and half, 2 sticks butter, 3 rounded Tablespoons all purpose flour, 1/2 package German Chocolate broken or use the whole thing, 1 cup sugar, 3 egg yolks. Just start whisking everything together as it starts heating up in the double boiler and it will look a lumpy mess at first. Everything will melt and combine as the cooking and stirring progresses and it will become chocolaty and smooth. Continue cooking until the frosting thickens. Take off the heat and stir in 1 cup sweetened coconut and 1 cup chopped pecans. The frosting will continue to thicken some as it cools This recipe makes enough to frost sides and middle of a tall, two layer cake, which is how I always do this recipe.

Wonderful cake.  Store did not have German Sweet Chocolate so I used 12 T. cocoa, 4 T. vegetable oil and 5 1/3 T. sugar.  I mixed this with the hot water and no one was the wiser.  I also used dry buttermilk mix which I added to the flour mixture and alternated the flour with water when mixing the cake.  Finally, the sides looked so bare that I made a batch of chocolate frosting from this website and frosted them.   We used this for my son's birthday cake and I am certain I will be making it again next year.

I followed the directions exactly. It's absolutely delicious and very moist. In the future I will make it a day ahead, as it was even better the second day.

I made this exactly as written. Made sure to measure flour after sifting (which was something I needed to know since I am new at baking anything from scratch) and it came out beautifully! First time making a German chocolate and it came out perfect! Would of thought I was baking for years with this recipe.

This was a big hit.  I was a bit doubtful when it said to melt the chocolate in water but it turned out so rich and wonderful. everyone loved it. The frosting didn't cover the whole cake. I'd increase the recipe by 1 1/2. I only make it around half the sides.

This is a scrumptious cake!  Worth the effort.  I did double the pecan icing and made chocolate buttercream icing for the sides.  Elegant presentation.

The first time I made it, it was very good, but not very moist. The day after, it was down right dry. I made it yesterday, and added 1 1/2 cup oil, the same amount of oil I use in my Carrot Cake. It made all the difference. It was super moist, and delicious. I have heard people use chocolate pudding to make it moist, but the oil worked great for me. Delicious recipe though.

This cake was so moist and delicious! I don't usually like German chocolate cakes because the coconut is chewy and not good, but this filling was amazing. I made an additional chocolate frosting to frost the edges like in the picture.  I didn't separate the eggs in the batter to beat separately, I just added them. Still fluffy. I also just used two round pans and made the third in a square 8x8 since that's all I had and sent that home with my guests. One reviewer says her eggs cooked in the filling; I added everything to the cold pan, then started with low heat stirring frequently, while gradually working up to a low boil then used a whisk. Seemed to work. I usually buy cakes for parties but I'm so glad the store didn't have any German chocolate because this was so incredibly good! Worth the time and money on ingredients for a special occasion cake.

Wonderful texture and taste. Used the coconut/pecan icing for the layers and top and buttercream icing for the sides. buttercream made it look pretty, but was really not necessary, the cake was a big hit. Will be making this recipe again.

Owned a bakery for 10 years... it tastes yummy. However... PLEASE USE WAX PAPER OR PARCHMENT PAPER IN YOUR PANS.....It stuck to the pan, sides and bottom.  It is not firm and totally crumbly. I don't know if I can save it with chocolate frosting and the pecan/coconut finish.....

I found this recipe yesterday and made it. I thought it turned out really well. Especially the icing. I ran out of the topping after using it on two layers and decided to stick with that. The 3rd cake just happened to be a nice light snack. Just wish there was more to the topping.
update 4/16/2018: doubled the topping, and it was perfect for three layers.

I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it and so did the rest of the family. I've only baked a handful of things from scratch and I was able to do it. The cake was so moist and the flavor was exactly what you would want and expect a homemade, made with lots of love and care, German chocolate cake would taste like. 
Thank you for sharing your family recipe!

This is my boyfriend's most favorite cake.  I did add the chocolate frosting, which improves it.  Personally, I think it's just okay.  The chocolate is mild tasting, and I prefer a richer darker cake.  The lining of the pans is essential.  The first time I made it, I didn't take it that seriously, and my cake just fell apart.  The frosting is awesome!

So good!  I used 9" round cake pans and made only 2 layers which was a perfect size.  After reading reviews I also added another 50% to the frosting recipe to make sure I had enough and it came out perfect.  Made it for my best friend's birthday and everyone loved it.

Pros:  This cake was delicious!  I added 1 tbsp. Baking cocoa, because folks said it needed a more chocolatey taste.
Cons: This cake crumbled apart while I was slicing it - made the cake on day 1, frosted it the morning of day 2, sliced it the evening of day 2.  However, on day 3 it was much more sturdy and I could actually get a solid slice out of it.

Small confession... I didn't make the cake BUT the icing is AMAZING! I used another cake recipe from my grams, used a bundt cake pan and this icing and it was so freekin good! I also left the pecan pieces pretty large, and while it was kind of a pain to frost neatly, I really enjoyed the texture mix-up. GREAT recipe! I also had plenty of icing, maybe frosting the layers in between is what depleted some peoples supply? THANK YOU FOR THIS!

My only complaint is that it's really not a chocolatey cake. Next time I will use at least twice the chocolate, or add some cocoa powder to the mix as well. My husband, who loves GC cake and this was for his birthday, asked me if it was a pumpkin cake, judging by the color of it. The rest of it was great. Good texture!
