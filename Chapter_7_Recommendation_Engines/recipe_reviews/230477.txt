Remember... Adding salt to beans before the last 5-10 minutes of cooking will make them tough.

I used a ham hock which I boiled in enough water to cover it. I added the carrots, garlic, beans, bay leaves and onion to this while cooking. When the meat was falling off the bone I chopped it up, adding it back to the pot and also kept the bone in. I kept this on a slow simmer for an hour. I added the salt and pepper just before serving. We liked the soup but I think I will even try adding some diced potatoes to this.

Wow! Great recipe, Christy! I thawed out leftover ham that I had from Easter in the freezer, but I didn't have a ham bone. Since I wanted the soup to still have flavor I used chicken broth instead of the water called for. Also I added some chopped up potatoes like Cathy G. suggested. Yum! Will definitely make again with the leftovers next Easter!

I made this soup but doubled the ham and the beans, and I added celery and potatoes. Also, I used chicken stock instead of water. It made a hearty soup, very flavorful and filling with a side of skillet cornbread.

Was a little leary about making bean soup with canned beans but this was delicious, nice Smokey flavor, no canned flavor, good texture, really hit the spot. Used chicken broth instead of water and added a turnip I wanted to use up.  Used less salt. No other changes.  Will definitely make again, thanks!

Used 16 oz package of pre-cubed ham, 1 can chicken stock instead of water and 2 cans of beans. Excellent dinner, can't wait to experiment with additional vegetables! Fast and easy!

This was delicious--my husband loved it.  I used the bone from the Honey Baked Ham we had at Thanksgiving.  There was a lot of meat on the bone so I added more carrots  another can of beans and more broth.  Cut back on the salt.  Will definitely make again.

This soup is very delicious Christy.   I omitted the salt because the meaty hambone I used was salty enough, and used leftover chicken stock in place of the water.  All the reviewers had good advice on add-ins, so I tossed in some diced celery and potato too.  I used 2 cloves of garlic because I grow it, and it's plentiful in my kitchen.  I'll make this soup again!

Great and easy. Thank you for this recipe! My husband is in heaven. I used the leftover honey baked ham from our Christmas dinner. I doubled the beans and omitted the carrots and salt.  I used 4 cups of water. and cooked it with the ham bone in the crock pot on high for 6 hours. Remember ham is SALTY, canned beans are SALTY, butter is SALTY. If you add chicken stock prepare for ultra SALTY!.

I used the left over ham and bone. I put the ham and bone in the crock pot for 24 hours and filled it almost to the top with chicken vegetable broth. Then I fished out all the bones, making sure the marrow is out and in the brew. I added 3 cans of black eyed peas, about 3 cups of chopped and minced carrots, 1 and a half white onion with a quarter cup of onion shallots-peeled and chopped into small pieces, and about 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. And a whole lot more pepper than what the recipe calls for, but then again my family likes it spicy! Absolutely yummy!!

MEATLESS VERSION: Night before I sautéed carrots and a whole onion in a bit of butter - both cut in large chunks. Sautéed just long enough to carmlize the carrots and onion (about 5 minus). I also pre-cooked the beans; rinse well then boil for 2 minuets, sit in hot water for 60 minuets, drain water. The following morning add the the beans, carrots, onions, 1 carton of vegetable broth to the crockpot. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, white pepper, garlic powder, onion power, seasoning salt, and 3 bay leaves. Cook on low (cooked while at work). The flavor was amazing, the beans were tender. Served with sautéed kale and collard greens and corn bread (not jiffy). This was a hit!! If you want some meat but don’t eat or want pork, serve with skinless turkey kielbasa sausage. But try meatless, I’m confident you’ll enjoy.

This is a good basic soup, I changed a couple of things.I used chicken broth rather then water.I rinsed the beans to get
 rid of the salt, used olive oil rather then butter,I did not 
add any salt as the ham itself is quite salty.I also wanted to add more body to this so I added carrots, parsnips, and Savoy cabbage.I did not have a ham bone, just used left over baked ham. Great flavour.
I like the fact that you can add any vegetable to it.
Thank you for the recipe.

I omit the salt, because the ham slices here are plenty salty.  Individuals can add to their taste.

Yeah, basically I changed everything. Used chicken stock, Italian seasoning, and clearing the fridge of all soon to expire veggies!  Gave it a squirt of Sriracha sauce too.  Turned out great and I hope I can duplicate it someday.

This is a delicious soup! I like that the quantity is perfect for one or two people. I used good quality ham slices that were given to me, and no bone. I did add almost a full packet of Goya Ham Flavored Concentrate. One problem: I found this to be extremely salty on the first bowl. The next time, I would check much later if it even needed more salt. The ham surely adds some salt to the soup; the seasoning I added didn't have a whole lot. I had to dilute the remainder of the soup with more water to alleviate the salt problem. Definitely a keeper recipe, though! Thanks and Happy New Year!

This was wonderful.  I did change it up as advised by other reviews by using some chicken broth in place of the water.  Don't salt till the end-should it need any salt (mine didn't)  Its a myth that salting at the end will make your beans tough.  If your beans are tough, they have most likely been in storage too long.

This is the perfect ham and bean soup, and so simple. I added a tsp of dry thyme, since I didn't have any bay leaves, and subbed chicken stock for the water. Turned out amazing!

This recipe was a hit with my husband.  I added more water  (probably double) since two cups seemed like very little for the amount of other ingredients.  I omitted the salt and added about a tablespoon of  Better than Bouillon ham base and used a meaty hambone, which I slow-cooked in the soup for several hours, until the meat fell off the bone.

Delicious recipe but far too salty for my family. I didn't add salt but did use chicken stock instead of a bone for flavor as some other raters did. Next time I will drain and rinse the beans to lessen the salt instead of using the canned bean water.

I love soup and make different types frequently.  
Normally I try to follow a recipe the first time exactly as written.  But, l didn't have the ham or right type of beans.  I substituted kielbasa for the ham  and used 1 can each of  black eyed peas and white kidney beans.   I also used chicken broth in place of the water. It was really,  really good. This is definitely going to be on my soup rotation.
