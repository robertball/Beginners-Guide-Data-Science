I used "soured" milk in this recipe, I made no other changes. Very simple pancake recipe that cooked up light and fluffy and were perfectly spiced. I served this with warmed maple syrup. This made six medium sized pancakes--we ate them all. NO leftovers.

I only used half of all the spices required and I'm glad I did because it was perfect. I think it would be too overpowering if I stuck to the recipe given. Great fall inspired pancakes! I paired it with butter pecan maple syrup it was delicious!

The spices were overwhelming. Maybe try cutting the spices in half. I ended up throwing them away, which I hate to do.

The flavor was Fabulous... but for me, the batter was too thin. I added a splash of vanilla and abt. a Tblsp of sugar to a tripled recipe. Next time I'll try more flour. But these WERE Delicious/ served with warmed up apple pie filling and syrup...Family says there's no reason to go to IHOP anymore. Thanks for the spice combo

I used sour milk with no other changes.  The taste was terrific.  I think next time I will use a bit less milk, we like ours a bit thicker.  The smell was so good while cooking I  knew this was going to be a winner.  Thank you for sharing.  Will definitely make these again.

Way too much cloves! Next time will read reviews first and follow their suggestions. Unlike one reviewer who felt batter was too thin, I found the opposite to be true. After I let batter sit a few minutes, it was very thick & I needed to add more milk (used soy milk). If I fix again will definitely cut down on spices. I also had trouble getting pancakes to brown like mine usually do. Anybody else have that problem?

This is good - with some changes where the spices are concerned.  For example, I would never use the amount of cloves here - way too much.  I made the pancakes with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp cloves, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  That turned out about right.

Thank you for posting this recipe, I really really liked the concept and choice of spices. That being said I cut the spices in half like others recommended and still found them a little to potent, the clove in particular. Clove is a very strong spice, and in spite of it being the oldest spice I have in the cabinet it overwhelmed and masked the other spices. I will definitely be making this again and probably cut way back on the clove and see if i can't find a better balance in the flavor.

I wanted a Fall-type breakfast and tried this recipe.  As written it gets 4 stars.  There was just too much spice, all you could taste was the spice.  there was no maple flavor to be found!  When I make it again, I will reduce the spices by 1/2, then I believe it will be a 5 star recipe.  One reviewer added vanilla and a bit of sugar...I think this would be wise to do also.  We topped the pancakes with Sautéed Apples also from this site.  I think this helped cut the overwhelming flavor of the spices in the pancakes.  Otherwise, I don't think we would have been able to eat them.

I used the full amount of cinnamon, but reduced the cloves and nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and thought they turned out great! I also sprinkled some powdered sugar on them, followed by maple syrup. I'm sure they'd be even more delicious with sautéed apples. I think this recipe is especially nice for the fall/winter seasons.

Everyone seemed to like these pancakes, even my picky little brother. The taste reminds me a bit of the Winter holidays, but I probably will not be making them again anytime soon. Although they tasted nice, I felt like something was missing. They are simple to make and we didn't have to go out to buy any ingredients. :)
