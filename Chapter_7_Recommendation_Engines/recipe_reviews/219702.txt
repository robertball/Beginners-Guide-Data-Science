These are really wonderful cookies. I go to the Quaker Oats website and hunt out recipes. These are terrific! I cook them on the softer side and make sure to keep them wrapped up to they don't dry out - although with lots of kids buzzing around here, they don't last long!

Wow: the flavor of these cookies is phenomenal!  I am not a big butterscotch fan, but these may be the BEST cookies I have ever made.  They are rich yet light: very pleasant.  I made a 3/4 batch as written except I accidentally doubled the coconut, and I would not change a thing.  These cookies are to die for!!

Sweet, chewy and delicious.I made half with and half without coconut. I thought both were equally good, but family&friends said they preferred the ones with the coconut. I used the whole bag of chips and it wasn't too many.Great, but I will keep looking for a recipe that uses less butter.

These were great after modifications, but as directed, they were a three. I made one batch as called for, but they fell apart. I added an egg to the next batch and used white chocolate chips. I also changed the cinnamon to 1 Tblsp. They held together much better and resulted in a tender cookie with a crunchy outer crust. Yummy. With modifications, a four plus.

These cookies were delicious!! I added walnuts and chocolate candy pieces, and a little extra egg. My one really useful piece of advice: USE PARCHMENT PAPER. I tried greased cookie sheets, and ungreased, and both times the cookies fell apart upon removing. Parchment paper works wonders.

Wow!  I almost never have time to leave a review, but just HAD to with these!  The cinnamon/nutmeg and the coconut made this the best recipe for butterscotch chip cookies I've ever tasted!  They also didn't fall the first time like so many cookie recipes that I make at such high altitude.  I usually bake a few cookies and then make some changes for the altitude, but these were perfectly raised and lightly browned on the top!

I had run out of brown sugar so I almost didn't make the cookies, but used all white and added a TBLS of dark honey.  I also only had 1 cup of butter (okay, so my cupboards are bare!) and I like a few less oats, so I put in 1/2 cup less oats and added a 1/2 cup flour instead.  Perfect!

I'm usually not the greatest fan of butterscotch, however my husband is. I made these to send to him while he was away for training and couldn't stop eating them myself! They are sooo good!

This recipe tasted great but in the future I think it needs a little extra butter. I ran out of butter so I substituted applesauce and it worked out, it just needed a lil extra. I left out the white sugar completely and it is still a fantastic recipe! I love that it still tastes great without the extra calories. I will definitely make these again!

I give this one a four star review because I felt a need to tweak it a little. I added another egg which I definitely believe it needed it   The coconut was a great addition.  I liked the nutmeg but my family didn't care for it (my nutmeg is very fresh and strong). I will probably go back to the Tollhouse Scotchie recipe and just add coconut.

What a wonderfully versatile recipe! I made a few changes, mostly because I was trying to finish off stuff I had left over from previous baking. They turned out well formed, with the oats tasting toasted. They are a soft cookie this way, but the toasted oats texture gives them a little bit of a crispy feel in your mouth. The coconut and chips blended perfectly, yet managed to keep their individual flavours. 

My changes: used 2 eggs, added 1/8 tsp. baking powder, used 1/2 cup coconut, 1/2 cup white choc. chips, and 1/2 cup of mini butterscotch chips. I baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet for 8 minutes at 375 degrees.

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever tried. I add a whole bag of butterscotch chips and about a cup of coconut.  They have always held together for me. I undercook them slightly because they continue cooking a little once out of the oven and I like them soft.  Makes a lot of cookies. Pretty dry dough but cook up well.

These were pretty good... My boyfriend liked them a lot. I thought there was too much going on with the nutmeg, cinnamon, coconut, and butterscotch. Also, I baked the first batch for 10 minutes and it was too long; they were dry. I did the second for 8 min and they were perfect. I probably won't make these again... Just because I have other oatmeal cookie variations that I prefer.

I made these today and added raisins instead of coconut. They are just like I like cookies-a little crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle. Oh, and I added a little more brown sugar and a little less white sugar. These are just my preferences. The recipe is great.

Love this recipe. It's easy to make and the cookies come out delicious. I take them out right at 8 minutes. They still look a little raw on top, but they flatten out and end up chewy and perfect.

We've enjoyed this cookie recipe many times. We like to add in more chips than called for to make them extra sweet. We also like to freeze a bag of the dough (made into ready to cook, dough rounds) we also use white whole wheat for our flour. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are delicious, chewy cookies. The only change I made was to double the butterscotch chips. Used a medium cookie scoop and got 70 cookies. Next time I might try just 1 cup butter and see if it helps them to not spread as much. Also, don't skip the coconut. Such a wonderfully tasty addition!

I made these yesterday and they are wonderful. I reduced the amount of freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon and increased the butterscotch chips to an entire 11 ounce bag. I baked the cookies at 8 minutes and they are wonderfully chewy. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. 10 or 11 minutes on airbake, and these spread a good bit. Either let sit a bit before removing from pan or consider Silpat or parchment as they are fragile when hot

Perfectly delicious! This is the one type of cookie that my mother-in-law makes and my husband commented that these are better than his mother's! Jackpot! I've tried it with and without the coconut and didn't think that it added much.

I used half coconut oil and didn't have flaked coconut. Cookies fell apart if I didn't let them cool adequately. Great recipe!!

So good! Stick to 1 tsp of vanilla extract -no extra! Chewy and coconut is good addition!
