These were delicious! They were gobbled up within minutes at my potluck supper! I followed the recipe exactly minus the jalapeno, I thought it had enough spice from the hot sriracha sauce alone. The tofu chunks stayed perfectly on the skewers. I used organic, sprouted super-firm tofu which is usually more durable than a lot of the regular non-sprouted tofu blocks I've bought in grocery stores. (It has a more meaty, less-smooth texture) If you use the right tofu it won't fall of the skewer.

Wow!  This one should convert people to tofu!  Very cheap to make, and a lot more filling than they look.  And gorge all you like - they are really healthy!  Use chicken for anyone not too keen on the tofu

The sauce is delicious and can be used with other ingredients.  Typically the first time I make a new recipe I follow the directions exactly then I tweek it the next time.  With this recipe I left out the jalapeno so that I could have a base from which to determine if/how much jalapeno I'd use the next time.  I also had some doubts about the tofu staying on the skewers so I doubled the sauce recipe and marinated shrimp in a separate container.  I skewered the shrimp and veggies and used a grilling basket for the tofu and veggies.  I also made one skewer with the tofu as per the recipe and the tofu fell off.  This meal was an instant hit and the leftover portion served cold over spinach the next night was just a delicious. It's a simple meal to prepare and make.

Beautiful, yummy and meaty! Another tip to keep tofu from falling off of skewers:  not only drain, but press extra-firn tofu, wrapped in papertowels or cheesecloth in colander with weight for 30 min or so.

The marinade was delicious, but the tofu didn't stay on the skewers. we had to do them separately on tin foil.

This is the first time I tried cooking with tofu.  My husband and I are trying to add more vegetarian meals to our diet. We prepared as per the recipe and we all liked it that includes my son and his girlfriend. Next time we will grill tofu longer since it was our first time we were afraid to overcook the tofu but the smaller more crisper chunks were a better texture. The marinade is excellent!

Oh good Lord- yummy yummy yummy! I had plain Sriracha instead of garlic sriracha so I added a whole bunch of minced garlic. Used onion powder instead of fresh onion. After I tossed the tofu and veggies with the marinade I couldn't stop eating the raw tofu! The marinade is to die for! My carnivore husband went crazy over it too! Healthy and delicious.

We love this one. I used Kikkoman Gluten free teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce to make it less salty. I also added sesame seeds and red pepper flakes in place of the jalapeños. I never seem to have them on hand! Draining, freezing, and then thawing tofu gives it a meaty texture and will keep it on the skewers, so try that. Really good recipe, and another great excuse to use Sriracha!

Amazing! I absolutely loved this! I am a huge fan of Sriracha sauce and not only did I marinated the tofu and veggies for a few hours in this delicious mariande, but I added more Sriracha on top of mine! The hotter the better. My only changes were to use 1 tblspn of sesame oil and 1 tblspn of olive oil, I used orange pepper and baby bella mushrooms with the zucchini....next time I will also add some chunks of vidalia onion to the skewers. Thanks!

This recipe rocks!  I have to say that I did something unusual with the veges, tofu and sauce from the original recipe. I saw this and thought it looked great but for one, I didn't have any kabob sticks and besides, it was pouring outside so I turned this into a stir fry!  It was great!   The only thing I did was double the sauce as I made rice to go with it.   It was delish and great as is - I made no other changes.   Try this recipe either way, you'll love it!

I have never made or actually ate tofu! I had dinner plans made and was informed that one of the guest was a vegetarian. Making meaty-Kabob’s for everyone else, I found this recipe and gave it a try. I got raves from her and another guest whom also likes certain tofu. Both really enjoyed it and in fact convinced me to try our masterpiece! It was actually really good! It had a nice BBQ taste and boasted with flavor. The only thing this website doesn’t included with the instructions is that draining the tofu isn’t the only thing you must do. With my online research I found that Tofu has no taste and is full of water. Tofu must be pressed then marinated for at least an hour so that is can absorb as much flavor as possible. My tofu I let marinate for over 2 hours in the Fridge! It was perfect! In fact I could honestly eat these myself again! Yum!

Loved it! Easy & flavorful! Based on some other reviews I omitted the jalapeno, I added chunks of sweet Maui onions to the skewer, and used minced green onions in the marinade instead of diced onion. I also used extra firm tofu, which I wrapped in several paper towels and placed between 2 cutting boards, and I placed 4 soup cans on top to press the liquid out, I left it about 30 minutes, and then cut into chunks to marinate.

I have tried this recipe various times with either tofu or beef tenderloins.  I suggest putting tin foil under the skewers because some of the tofu didn't stay on the skewer. It was a good way to get veggies into my diet.

I made this for a potluck. I marinaded and prepped the skewers the night before. I didnt use tofu, just extra veggies like mushrooms, onion and bell peppers, and I also added pineapple.  They were a huge hit as a meat-free option at this BBQ! Many people asked me for the recipe! I will make these again! There are many ways to tweak it which i like! I may try this with shrimp or chicken next time.

This was the bomb! I tried the skewers but eventually just started doubling the recipe and broiling everything in my oven on high heat in a large pan - first with quartered potatoes, carrots, and onions for 15 minutes, then adding the peppers, tofu, mixed squash, and mushrooms for another 15 or 20 minutes till crispy-tender.  It's the sauce that makes this so great.  And the tofu comes out crispy-crunchy.  Everyone in my family loved it, vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  I think this would work for any vegetable combo you could think up and it would still be good.  A real keeper!

My first experience EVER with tofu--was I ever impressed.  So tasty!  Highly recommend but be sure to use the firmest tofu or you will leave a portion of it on your grill!!

I really didn't care for the sesame oil. If I make this again, next time I'll swap out for a milder oil instead, the sesame oil, sriracha and jalapeno were overpowering all together.

Very nice marinade for tofu!  I didn't have any veggies that would go on skewers, so I just cut the tofu into 1/2" slices.  I marinated the slices and then cooked them on the grill.  I followed the other user's suggestion of using plain Srirach sauch with chopped garlic added. Also, make sure to use extra firm tofu.  To help it absorb the marinade, you can also "press" the tofu by putting it on a plate with a second plate on top. But something heavy (like a 1L bottle of water) on top and let it sit for 30 min or so.

This recipe rocks!  I am not a tofu lover but I liked it better than chicken in this recipe. My kids liked it too!  I used a grill basket and cooked everything in it instead of skewers and served it over brown rice.  Definitely making this one again!

Make the tofu in LARGE chunks, I made it  by cutting the tofu block in half lengthwise then in thirds then in half making 12 chunks, I also drained the tofu and pressed it prior to cutting and had no trouble threading it on the skewers.  Great taste!

This has become a staple at our bbqs! Even non-tofu eating people have gobbled them up.  I've used the recipe pretty much exact except 1 time I didn't add the jalapeño bc I didn't have one. I didn't notice much difference in the "heat" level.  If there are leftovers I normally reheat them in a pan and make a wrap out of them the next day.  So delicious! I haven't had any issues with the tofu not staying on the skewers, I use non-gmo extra firm tofu and drain all the excess water out about 30 min or so before I start chopping the veggies.  I place the tofu between 2 plates (with paper towels to absorb the excess water) then place a soup can on top to make sure the water is pressed out.  I highly recommend this dish!

This were delicious! I grilled these at my pool part and they were gone in less than 5 minutes. The only thing I changed was not adding ground black pepper because it was already spicy enough from the siracha sauce.

This sauce is very tasty. I cannot get tofu to stay on the skewers, so I just make the kebabs without them and then cook the tofu in a foil pouch on the grill.

This was pretty awesome. I didn't have skewers so I decided to (using a special pan) grill it in said pan and ate it with a fork. I also prepared spicy rice with it. If I could rate this recipe 10 stars I would. I recommend this to everybody.

We've never eaten tofu before, so I thought this recipe would be great to try it out on...Well, we decided that we don't like tofu, but we LOVED the veggies and marinade! The longer you can let this marinate the better...I will def be making these again (minus the tofu, lol)~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe! Simple yet provides robust flavor! I used superior light soy sauce and threw in some woodchips on the grill which gave it a great smoky flavor. I almost forgot I was eating tofu! Tomatoes are also a great substitute for any vegetable you are missing.

Everyone in the family loved this one. I cut back on the sriracha sauce the first time as some of my family don’t like things too spicy. Second time I followed the recipe and it was too spicy for those not used to the heat but I thought it was perfect. Definitely will keep this one to make again this summer.

This was really easy and tasted great! It is very spicy, so easing off on the jalapeño for those who don’t want some fire is a good idea. I basted while grilling. Very tasty!

I made it exactly for my daughter and I, she is vegan, and we both loved it. Made it to bring to my fathers for a bbq, full of carnivores, and again everyone loved it. It’s a really tasty recipe.

Toasted sesame oil is key in this marinade. I added molasses in an amount equal to the sesame oil for a little sweetening. Overall I only made half the marinade called for and still enjoyed flavorful grilled shishkebobs.

Absolutely delicious; fresh and spicy. I served them with basmati rice and fresh roasted corn. What a wonderful meal. Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe. It's full-on BBQ without the meat. So good.
DO let your ingredients marinade. The first time I made this recipe, I didn't leave them long enough, and my tofu wasn't as flavourful as it should have been.

We did not use the jalapeño peppers, for us the Sriracha was plenty. In fact, next time I will cut that ingredient by half. We used a bbq roaster basket we worked quite well. To give the dish a little more texture we served with white rice.
My wife has a low tolerance for spicy foods but really enjoyed this food adventure!

Super tasty I used brags liquid aminos instead of soy sauce because it has a lot less salt. It was a big hit with none leftover.

Delicious! Very fast and easy to make!
I rate it 4 because in my opinion it's limited on the flavors side.

It was way too spicy for us, we are lightweights, but I liked the flavor. Next time would use 1 tablespoon sriracha, no black pepper, no jalapanos.. ( green chilis instead) , that would be plenty.

Definitely save the marinade as a dipping sauce. This marinade is great if you like a lot of heat.

I usually just lay it all on a pan and broil it instead of building skewers and grilling.

I made these tonight, and they came out more amazing than I expected. Before marinating, I sliced the extra firm organic tofu into three thinner slices, and then sliced those into strips. placed them in an aluminum pan on paper towels, covered with another aluminum pan and set cans of beans on top. I let them sit this way for 30 minutes. After that- it was time for the marinade. I did not have garlic sriracha, so i used regular and added minced garlic. I marinated this for 1.5 hours, and then threw them on the foreman grill. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed these, and he has requested that I make them again tomorrow. Saving this recipe for sure!

I liked it but it was a bit spicy for me and my young children. I think I would also make the tofu chunks smaller next time so they can have more flavor. Not sold on the tofu flavor yet.

This was fantastic.  I doubled the recipe and cooked most of it the first day as kebabs.  The rest marinated overnight and I stir-fried it for lunch.  Both methods of cooking were great.  Marinating overnight really boosted the flavour.
