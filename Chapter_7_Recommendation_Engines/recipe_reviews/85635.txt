There are MANY reviews/suggestions of this sauce...I read ALL of them...here they are summed up for easy viewing: 1. Omit 3 cans tomato paste for 1 can tomato paste and 1 can tomato sauce (I used 15oz can). 2. Omit 1/2 cup of sugar for 1/4 cup sugar if you like it a little sweet, or just 2 TBSP sugar if you cant tolerate much. 3. Omit 1 cup of water and add 2 cups of water instead. Some modifications that I personally made, which doesnt reflect what other reviewers have said, is using this Hot n' Spicy seasoning salt I found in my pantry...found the original recipe a little bland...this salt kicks it up a little (cajun seasoning should work just as well). I also read the reviews of how the meat, when baked directly in the sauce, can make it oily...I went ahead and bought meat that contained 7% fat (the already packaged stuff) and the sauce turned out perfect.

This rating is for the meatballs only.  I used oatmeal instead of crumbs, but that is just preference.  I can't believe how tender these come out when cooked in the sauce.  Ingenious!  Here's a tip I learned about meatballs... instead of rolling out each tedious one, try rolling a handfull of meat into a 1" thick rope and then cutting the rope into 1/2-1" lengths.  Much faster!

I decided to give this recipe a try today, and I'm very glad I did. I followed the recipe, except for these changes based on the other reviews I read...I used only 3 tablespoons sugar, added an additonl cup water (my family likes a more gravy like sauce, not too thick) and browned the meatballs in a bit of oil a bit...I also added a good chunk of pepperoni stick (old trick by my mom) and a half pound of beef stew chunks, browned as well, and simmered the whole thing for about 6 hours...Other than those changes, I follwed the recipe...:) The gravy came out phenomenal, and the whole family is looking forward to having it tomorrow as well (italian food is better the day after) So thank you Jenn, for a great recipe that can be easily tweaked to personal preference!
Edited to add: I've now used this recipe a half dozen times to great success and reviews...I now double the batch and freeze half, and it keeps VERY well in the deep freeze for up to two months. All in all now my gold standard recipe to use for sauce and meatballs, NEVER again will I buy premade stuff!

This was fantastic.  I actually made many changes.  I didn't make the sauce and just used the recipe for the meatballs.  I made a pot of sauce (combination of store-bought jars)and I mixed the meatballs and made them into 2 inch balls.  I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  If you decide to do this do it in a casserole dish and not on a cookie sheet.  The grease from the ground beef dribbled into the bottom of my oven and was a mess.  After baking them I put them in the sauce and added sweet italian sausage cut up into pieces.  I brought it to a boil and then simmered for about an hour and a half.  It was delish.  My family raved about the whole meal especially the meatballs. I served it with wheat pasta and garlic bread.  Very good.

My husband and I really enjoyed these meatballs and sauce.  They were very tender- sometimes my meatballs can be tough.  Cooking them in the sauce must be the key.  I cut way back on the sugar- only about a Tbsp. as we don't like sweet sauce.  Also, I had to use dried oregano as my grocery store was out of fresh.  I'm sure the fresh oregano would only improve these even more.  I cooked these on low in my crockpot for about 7 hours.  I think they'd make great meatball grinders.  The sauce is nice and thick.  It would sit well on a grinder roll.  We were scooping every last bit off our plates with our garlic bread!

Great spaghetti sauce - if you cut back on the sugar that is.... I cut it back to 3 Tbsp. and that was about right for us. I also used 2 cans of tomato paste and one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. Instead of 1 cup of water I used half water and half red wine. I didn't have fresh oregano so I used 1 Tbsp. of dried and added a few more spices: 2 tsp. of dried basil, 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp. of salt along with the bay leaf. I let it simmer on low for 6 hours. I didn't make the meatballs so this review is for the sauce only. I used "The Best Meatballs" from this site.

When I told my carnivore hubby that I was making penne with marinara sauce he got upset and said "what, no meat?" so I turned to allrecipes and found this excellent recipe!! I just poured my jar of marinara sauce in a saucepan, followed these instructions for meatballs, plopped them in the sauce, and dinner was done in 40 minutes! These meatballs were very tender and easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. I will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe!! I only added 1/4 c of sugar, and that was still a bit sweet. I also added mushrooms and a few tablespoons of red wine. This gave it great flavor!

The meatballs were really good but the sauce was way to sweet. Use alot less sugar and maybe one less can of the tomato paste. I made it as is will use the meatball recipe again.

I would have rated this higher except....stop the sugar!!  And the salt!!  All you need to add is a pinch of baking soda to cut the acidity in the tomato sauce.  Bake the meatballs in the oven (or fry) to release the fat before adding to the sauce.  No, I'm not a health nut, I'm just following what my italian gramma taught me.........let the true tomato taste stand out!

That  is also very much my recipe, but I place the balls on a cooking tray with a little olive oil and bake them for 20 mn to get all the bad fat out....drain them on a paper towel and cook slowly in the sauce for an hour

I use crushed tomatoes. To cook leave the cover on partially and when you need to thicken it, just take it off. The water will evaporate and it'll be thicker. Too thick? Cover back on and the "sweat" will thin it. Instead of tomatoe paste I add 1 can of plum tomatoes to my sauce and just crush them in my fingers into the pot for a more pomadoro sauce with chunks of tomatoes. Nice change sometimes.   I make sauce and meatballs forever. I am Italian, as well. My Nana, mother-in-law, Nani & everyone else I know including me, use a pinch of sugar which I eventually faded out and use a spritz of red wine vinegar, kills some of the acid as well without flavor.  I never add oregano to the meatballs. Lots of salt, pepper, parsley, cheese, garlic, crumbs-perfect!  I also add 1/4 c milk to moisten and they stay beautiful. I would put 1 egg. A pound of meat may get too hard with 2. Milk moistens w/o hardening.  A trick, if you want to make sure meatballs are seaoned enough, before you drop them in, press one to your tongue. If bland, spice it up!!

I have made this sauce a couple times and my husband and I have really enjoyed it.  Leftover sauce for days of enjoyment and little to no additional cooking for dinner required!  I did decrease the amount of sugar to 1 TBS but that is because I know I don't care for sweet pasta sauce.

I'll share a secret a full blooded Italian friend gave me about spaghetti & meatballs.  Add a small amount of cinnamon to both the meatballs and the sauce.  Be very careful not to add too much.

This is an absolutely awesome recipe.  Don't listen to all the "alterations"!  It is perfect as is.  People should not even review the recipe if they are not going to at least try it as written first.  I hate sauce from a jar or can because the tomato taste is too harsh.  This recipe is a perfect blend of seasonings and tomato, and turns out just perfect as originally submitted.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this yesterday, using reviews to tweak.  Hubby loves lots of sauce, so I used 1 large can crushed tomatoes, one large can sauce and a 12 oz can paste.  Also pureed 2 carrots, one onion, one green pepper, fresh garlic and a drained can of mushrooms (son will eat this if he cannot see the veggies but if left in visible chunks all bets are off!) and sauteed that with 12 oz. wine before adding tomato products.  Added 2 cups water, worcestershire sauce and 3/4 cup sugar.  Down south we like it sweet, like our tea!  In trying to avoid  nasty filler in ground beef, I used round steak that I ground in my Kitchen Aid mixer for ground beef and followed recipe according to instructions.  Very tender and delicious!  Served over whole wheat angel hair pasta and froze the leftovers.  YUMMY!!!  Served with home made whole wheat french bread...

The only thing I change is the water. It's omitted. Otherwise I like this just the way it is. I've made it so many times for people that it's now the meal requsted by folks when I invite them over to share a meal.

I have used this recipe for years, give or take a few things.  My late step-father made his (authentic italian), in a very similar way.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce is the only way I will do it. As for the sauce, I usually use 1 can of Progresso crushed tomatoes and refill the can with water to add, 2 cans of paste also refilling each can with water and adding to the pot.  I do not add onions but brown garlic and sausage at the bottom of the sauce pan before adding the tomatoes.  This omits the oil since sausage has its own.  I also do not use oregano, just basil and sometimes red pepper, along with the black pepper and a very little bit of salt.  Lastly, instead of sugar, I use one whole carrot to add enough sweetness to get rid of the tartness.  I never boil but cook on low for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Yum!

I make spahgetti and meatballs by requests from my grandkids. 1/2 C sugar is WAY to much.  I use 2T brown sugar and it is just right.  I haven't tried this recipe yet but I wanted to give cooks this info.  You may also use dried oregano and parsley.

Made this last night for dinner and everyone loved it!!I took Yoshiyums advice. Which was:  1. Omit 3 cans tomato paste for 1 can tomato paste and 1 can tomato sauce (I used 15oz can). 2. Omit 1/2 cup of sugar for 1/4 cup sugar if you like it a little sweet, or just 2 TBSP sugar if you cant tolerate much. 3. Omit 1 cup of water and add 2 cups of water instead.  My advice is to add your water a cup at a time. And wait to see how thick it is. IF you like it thinner add more water. Personally, I like a thicker sauce. And the 2C made it a little too watered-down for me. So, next time I will only add 1 and see what happens.

I grew up really disliking meatballs and it wasn't until many years later I realized why. My mom always fried hers and to me they tasted like round hamburgers floating in sauce. Many years later a friend of mine gave me this very recipe and now I adore meatballs. What a huge difference cooking them right in the sauce as opposed to frying or baking! The only thing I don't do is add sugar. Wonderful recipe and thank you for enlightening so many folks!

Love these meatballs and that they are cooked in the sauce. Adds depth to both meatballs and sauce. I use my own marinara or a couple jars of prego when I'm in a hurry. My new meatball go to recipe.

ughhhhh...way too sweet!  I should have known with 1/2 cup of sugar.  Still gave it two stars because my husband thought it was decent and my kids ate it....probably because of all the sugar!

I only used the recipe and style of cooking for the meatballs and paired it with some canned spaghetti sauce. But the result is delicious. This is now part of my regular repertoire.

I used only 1/4 cup sugar (I cannot IMAGINE how sweet this would be with the full 1/2 cup....it'd be like candy!)....a little extra olive oil, a whole yellow onion, only 2 cans tomato paste and maybe 3/4 cup water (I like a thicker sauce) and I doubled the meatball recipe to accommodate another pound of beef. This was very good. Cooking the meatballs in the sauce made them very tender. Will make again. Thanks!

Really good.  I wish I added a bit more salt to the meatballs though...I was afraid to oversalt.  As others suggested, I used 2 cups water, 3 T sugar, and used 2 8oz tomato sauces instead of 2 of the tomato pastes.

So I made the recipe as is and I give it a 4 only because 1/2 c sugar is too sweet.  That being said I love the recipe and will be making it again with a few changes. I understand where youre coming from in terms of the rating, but I have to tell you I appreciate the suggestions.

I followed the recipe exactly, and well.....very disappointing.  The sauce lacked flavour and it was quite sweet.  I definitely would not make this again.

This recipe is awesome and soooo easy to change up to your own liking...I toss in a chunk of green pepper that way I can pull it out before serving for the pickier eaters....and I hit the sauce w/a stick blender to control consistency.

I had GREAT hopes for this recipe, but I'm sorry to say my hopes were dashed. I thought the amount of oregano was way too much, but since I've never used fresh I thought that was the reason.  WRONG!  It totally overpowered the taste of the meatballs and sauce.  Maybe I'm just overly sensitive, but that was all I could taste--oregano and sweetness.

very easy recipe, my 4 year old helped me prepare them. We use ground pork, and baked them in the oven until browned and then simmered in a sauce for about an hour.

Amazing! I did make a few of the changes others suggested: 1)Swap 3 cans of paste for one can of paste + a 15 oz. can of sauce. 2)Use 2 cups water instead of one. 3) Use only 2 T sugar. I also used 2 bay leaves and added Cajun seasoning. You can also use dried oregano and parsley, just reduce to 4 tsp. instead of 1/4 cup. Ok, so that does sound like a lot of changes. But it turned out so good - with these changes it would definitely get 5 stars. It was a little blander as written. I will never buy jarred sauce again. The meatballs were perfect as written.

We enjoyed this, but hubs thought it was a bit too sweet.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar to probably 2 Tbls. which is usually enough to cut the acidity a bit.  We had this the other night, and I'm looking forward to having the left overs for lunch after church tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made meatballs but not sauce.  Added some uncooked ground pork I had left over from another recipe, no parmesan cheese.  Turned out great, had never cooked meatballs in sauce before but they turned out awesome.  Grown ups liked them better than the kids though.

I only gave this 4 stars b/c I tweaked to our liking.  I did not make meatballs, but used browned deer burger.  My family also doesn't like chunky tomatoes, so I used a 30 oz can of tomato sauce and 1-6 oz can of paste.  The rest of the ingredients I used to taste.  I absolutely loved how this came together.  I've tried many scratch sauces and this is one I'm going to stick with.  It was more saucy than meaty which we loved.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  We made a few changes based on what we had around the house, but stuck to the heart of the recipe.  We browned the meatballs in the pan before adding them to the sauce.  Delicious!

I was looking for a recipe that would increase the tenderness and flavour of my meatballs. This isn't it. I followed it to the letter (absolutely no substitutions/changes) and 4 of the balls fell apart (I suppose they *are* more tender in that respect). They aren't any more flavourful at all and the sauce is quite watery and bland despite being oily from the meat. I am very disappointed.

This was soooo good! We loved the sauce- I followed the advice of others and used 1 can of tomato paste, 1 15oz can of tomato sauce, and 1/4 c of sugar (since there is less paste, you need less sugar). This made for the perfect consistency for us and we thought it was great! The meatballs were good- I still think I prefer my grandma's recipe for those, but I will use this sauce over and over!

Hi there  I have never made anything like this in my life ...bit of pasta sauce maybe... but meatballs !!! ??? Never !!  Instructions were so easy to follow. Living in Spain, all the herbs and spices were very fresh.  Cooked it while my partner (she's a Native New Yorker - they are black belts on this type of meal aren't  they ??) was out.  I was really worried about how it would turn out !! Everything tasted wonderful.  She loved it .... so a big thanks Jenn. You have inspired me to try out a few other recipes !!  Regards from sunny Spain  Highlander

Have made identical recipe with minor personal changes. I only use 2tbl brown sugar, always a dash of cinnamon, a splash of white wine and I prefer tomato sauce to paste. Need more flavour...squeeze some ketchup into sauce!  Dried seasonings work fine..All good...all yummy.

You need to broil the meatballs for 15 minutes before putting them in the sauce. This will brown the meat and the sauce won't get greasy. Roll them lightly in your hands (do not overwork or they will be tough), put them in a baking pan and then broil them in your oven for 15 minutes. Then you can take a knife and knock off or scrape off any fat that is visible. Then put them in the sauce and simmer for 2 hours until done.     Also, I replace oregano with basil, omit the bay leaf, omit the onion, halve the sugar, and put in about 2 T of garlic powder as well as 1/2 tsp of baking soda which kills some of the acidity of the tomatoes, sweetening them.

Great starter recipe, but some changes definitely need to be made.  As everyone said, entirely too much sugar.  Actually, I cheated.  I started with Prego.  It's a great starter sauce.  I cooked 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 c. finely chopped onions, and dried Italian seasoning in olive oil.  Start with onions until transparent and then add others and cook only until flagrant.  I added half the onion mixture to sauce and the other half to the meatball mixture.  Instead of drued bread crumbs, I used three crustless slices of white bread soaked in 1/4 c. milk.  I whisked only one egg into the bread mixture VERY well.  I added extra parmesan and minced garlic into the meat mixture before balling. I made 2" meatballs and baked them in a high temp. oven. I drained them and let them rest before adding them into the sauce to cook on low for another 30 min.  Instead of spaghetti, I served mine with garlic butter toasted Italian bread.  My boys eat them separately and call them eyeballs in blood.  My husband and I make meatball subs with provolone cheese.  Any way you do it...they're good.

I've made this twice recently.. was good the 1st time.. but great the second time.  I uses 1 1/2 cans of tomato paste, eliminated the sugar, added 3 bay leaves, used Panko and a little extra cheese.  The second time I doubled the sauce only... sooo much better than the first time.  Cooked the meatballs in the sauce (adds much more flavor).  Excellent recipe!

I never have made this sauce though I'm sure it's excellent- but the meatballs are fabulous and make any old jar of spaghetti sauce awesome!
 I make these with a pound of meat at a time and freeze half (one in the sauce, one on a plastic-wrap lined paper plate until the mix is gone; I set the plate just for an hour or two flat in the freezer and then slip [the m'balls] in a freezer bag). Fresh or frozen the just simmer about 45 mins and any sauce works since they come out so well.... I definitely think the fresh herbs (I freeze those too) make a difference and fresh cheese if you have it, too.... 
 We love this meal at our house and using the frozen m'balls is such a quick and easy fix for a weeknight dinner- dump in pan, pour sauce over, cover and set on low and start the water to boil about twenty minutes in.... nothing to it, and it works every time!

WAAAAAYY to sweet.  I cut the sugar down to 3 TBS as someone suggested, and that was still WAY too much!  It ruined the batch of sauce, in my opinion, no matter what I did I couldn't overcome having so much sugar.  Perhaps a good way to cook meatballs, but this is the traditional way to cook them anyway, nothing new with cooking them in the sauce.

I don't know about the sauce--I used a jar I had in the pantry--but the meatballs were WONDERFUL.

I'm the first of many generations of Italian cooks who made AWFUL meatballs!  Thanks for this recipe!  I substituted the ground beef with turkey but followed the rest of the directions as shown.  PERFECT!  This was my last attempt at meatballs... I found a recipe I can make again and again!  Yummy!

I really like this recipe.  I made some changes based on other reviews, I added  a can of tomato sauce and not quite as much tomato paste.  I only added half of the water it called for, because of the tomato sauce.  The consistency ended up being basically the same as the jarred sauce I was buying before.  I also added parsley to the sauce itself and was very generous on the seasonings.  I also cut the sugar in by at least half to tone down the sweetness.  The meatballs were so tender and juicy from being cooked in the sauce, and the flavor was excellent.  Our new favored pasta sauce!  Thank you!
*****update - the meatballs do not hold up well after being frozen.  They are too fragile.  When reheating the sauce, some of them fell apart.  Not a bad thing taste-wise, but kind of defeats the purpose of meatballs.  I'd say this is a 3 star recipe after being frozen.  Excellent on the first day.

Loved the meatballs and sauce, however, I found that because they were cooked in the sauce, there was added grease in my sauce. I will cook them, then add them to the sauce in a crockpot next time.

Awesome recipe! i like the fatc that the meatballs cooked in the sauce, it made them very moist!  I followed the recipe for the sauce, but tweaked the meatballs a little, I used garlic and herb bread crumbs, 1 tsp. of worchestire sauce, a 1/8 tsp. garlic powder and salt and pepper and they were great!  Everyone loved them!

This is a great recipe thanks a bunch. The only thing I did different is cooked it in my slowcooker all day, and read other reviews and used a quarter cup of sugar and it was perfect! No problems with the meatballs at all. Maybe because I wasen't standing over my slow cooker stirring it and making them fall apart. Delicious meal, will definately cook again, thanks!

I'm rating this considering the actual recipe.  This one was way too sweet!!  I made it a second time, using less tomato paste & less sugar - while adding more water and it turned out much better.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I made this for my husband and a dear friend, and they both absolutely loved it.  It's not very often that we find a recipe to add to our go-to-recipes list, but this will definitely be on there from now on!  I did use the modifications recommended by Yoshiyum.  I substituted the 3 cans of tomato paste with 1 can tomato paste and 1 can tomato sauce, and I used one 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of two 16-oz cans (reduces cost).  I also decreased the sugar to 3 Tbsp and used two cups of water.  Lastly, I personally do not care for the flavor of parsley, so I substituted fresh basil in its place.  Cooking the meatballs in the sauce is genius and definitely made for a delicious meal!  Thanks Jenn!

This is my go to spaghetti recipe when I have the time! The meatballs are delicious and the sauce is super yummy. I do add some cayenne for a little heat. Other wise I don't change a thing.

Holy sugar, Batman!  I am known for my sweet tooth, but this was just ridiculous.  Had I known, I would have cut the sugar amount in half -- at least! You need some to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes, but a 1/2 cup is what you'd put in cookies, not tomato sauce. I had to add almost a cup of cooking wine and tons of salt, and they still didn't mask the overwhelmingly sweet taste.

I thought the rest of the recipe was pretty good, so next time I'll add more olive oil (there was no olive flavor at all, and you'll note that many pros use olive oils in their tomato sauce to give it a rich flavor). I did take another reviewer's suggestion and used only one 6-oz. can of tomato paste and added a 15-oz. can of tomato sauce.  Also, I used no water. I can't imagine adding water!  If anything, I would sub it with cooking wine (or drinking wine).  Why waste flavor on water as an ingredient?

I'm not sure why I was sort of leery of cooking the meatballs right in the sauce, but I was. Boy, was I wrong on that one. They were excellent! I did have about 1/3 cup of ricotta I wanted to use so I threw that in the meatballs and only added 3 tablespoons of sugar. This will be the only way I cook meatballs from now on. Thanks so much!

wish I would have read ALL the reviews before making this.. I hesitantly used all the sugar and shouldnt have.  Really sweet.  I wouldnt use more than 2 Tbs. next time.  Also may take the advice on using 1 less tom. paste and one more tom. sauce instead.?

I tried to scale this gravy down a little as I was only feeding two people. I used two (15 oz) cans crushed tomatoes, 1 can (6 oz) tomato paste and only 1/2 cup chicken stock, NOT water, I added 3 cloves of roasted garlic and almost 1 tsp of sugar to the gravy. I added some fresh minced basil and very little oregano to the gravy plus the bay leaf. To the meatballs, I added fresh basil and also little oregano. (I actually never add oregano to meatballs but was curious to see how this would turn out). I added the rest of the ingredients to the meatball mixture then rolled them up into meatballs and placed them onto a baking sheet. I baked the meatballs at 350 degrees for 20 minutes until brown, then added it to the gravy. I found that the gravy needed a little something so I added a little red wine, pinch of red pepper flakes, and some parmesan cheese. I simmered the gravy for about 45 to 55 minutes. The gravy was good but the meatballs I liked a lot more. Not dry, but tender and flavorful. I am glad that I did not add a lot of fresh oregano. I still had enough gravy leftover for another meal. Next time I might cut back on the amount of crushed tomatoes.  I served this gravy over spaghetti and "garlic bread", also from this website.

This was so yummy.  Followed recommended modifications from reviewer yoshiyum. (sort reviewers by most helpful and they come up first).  I loved the idea that the meatballs cooked right in the sauce and no need to brown.

Delicious! I also cut the sugar back to 3 tablespoons and that seems to add a perfect sweetness. I used only one can of tomato paste but increased the water to 3 cups. I used Italian stewed tomatoes with oregano and garlic. (that's what I had on hand and it worked well!) I didn't have beef so I used turkey meat. Very good...will make meatball sandwiches with leftovers.

I made the sauce with half the amount of sugar and it still tasted like we were licking sugar out of the bowl.  The meatballs were tasty but I would like to keep looking for another recipe.

the meatballs come out soooo tender when cooked in the sauce. We really enjoyed this recipe and have made it time and time again. We even made it for my boyfriends family while they were in town and they devoured it. I omit the sugar completely because I don't like it.

Five stars for the Meatballs!!!!! Loved them! The sauce was extremely sweet. (My suggestion: start off adding your sugar with a tablespoon at a time until you get your desired taste).

I really wasn't expecting much.  How can a spaghetti sauce be universally loved?  But this was wonderful!  Like a tomato hug!  It combines the comfort power of both spaghetti and meatloaf.  Also, a few pots and few hours of unsupervised simmering and I had one yummy dinner, plus two in the freezer.  Wow.  I didn’t add the sugar but otherwise cooked to spec.  Next time I would do a tiny few things different, like add some wine.  But in general I don’t want to mess with this recipe too much because it has the foundational ratios just about perfect.

I made this for 2 rather than the prescribed amount, and the recipe was pretty good. The only problem I encountered was the water amount (the sauce started drying out because of the low amount of water, so I needed to continually add more). Other than that though it was pretty tasty. The meatballs especially were awesome.

I did not like this at all.  Followed the directions to a T and did not like the flavor.  Thankfully with many additions, my husband was able to fix so that it was somewhat edible.

I followed others suggestions and used 1 can of paste and 1 15 oz of sauce instead of 3 cans of paste. I also only added 2 Tbs of sugar and used 2 cups of water. This is the first spaghetti sauce I've made and it was AWESOME. :) Sooo much better than pre-made.

I gave this 2 stars.  I followed this recipe to the "T" and was really disappointed.  For starters why does it call for "3 cans of tomato paste"?  The whole dish tasted like tomato paste!  Awful!  I will now have to "tweak it" to save from throwing it all out!

Overall, a good recipe.  I'll probably tweak the sauce next time by added 2 Tbsp sugar and more crushed tomatoes, less tomato paste, and a bit of white wine.  Really liked the meatballs, but my husband did not like the oregano in them, so next time I'll leave that out as well.  Also, I baked my meatballs for 20 minutes before adding them to the sauce, because I like my meatballs with a little "crust" on them.  This recipe is a great "jumping off point" for making the perfect spaghetti sauce and meatballs, since after reading all of the other reviews it is evident that there are an abundance of personal preferences for the flavors and textures of this classic dish.  Thumbs up from me, Jenn!

this is almost the recipe I have used for years, modified over the years from the basic recipe in the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  I also add basil to the sauce; I've never added the oregano to the meatballs, though.  Interesting.  One more thing, after forming the meatballs, I roll them in additional breadcrumbs before browning them in just a little olive oil in a skillet, then adding them to the sauce.  The breading helps them hold on to the sauce better.  Delish!  I prefer this sauce to the marinaras at most Italian restaurants.

I just made this sauce, thinking a 1/2 cup was too much, I only added 1/4 cup of sugar. It is still WAY TOO SWEET!!! I'm dumping the sauce. Since I don't have time to make another sauce, I’ll just have to use Ragu instead. I did use my own meatball recipe and I’m glad I did, because I always bake my meatballs before adding them to the sauce, at least I’ll be able to salvage them. Although I’m not reviewing the meatballs, if I could give this sauce ZERO stars, I would!!!

Instead of sugar always add one whole carrot to the sauce. Remove before serving. This soaks up the acidity

I have been making these meatballs since I found the receipe on this site.  They are FANTASTIC!  I have serveded, them to many people and they always rave about them.  I make them exactly as written and do not fry/bake them before adding to the sauce.  I usually  make my own suace or if time is limited I use  a jar.  I use these meatballs in all pasta, including lasagna.  Great receipe!!!

Delicious! Only adjustments: I added 5"-6" of pepperoni (cause we LOVE pepperoni), I used dried Italian seasonins instead of the fresh hers, cause that's what i had, I used Tony Cahere's instead of salt and pepper, and I added about a cup of water.  YUMMY!

The sauce is great with one change - throttle back on the sugar.  I HIGHLY suggest adding any amount of sugar in small increments and tasting before using more.    I like my sauce zesty and thought it was perfect until I added the indicated amount of sugar.   I salvaged the sauce by adding additional tomato sauce and paste.  I would also suggest having a bottle of “Italian Seasoning” and Onion Powder available to increase seasoning as desired.

Loved it! Had to change a thing or two based on what I had. I didn't have any tomato paste, so I used puree in place of the sauce and paste. Used dried herbs and a splash of white wine. Also skipped the water, just used 28 oz crushed and pureed toes. I wish I would've followed the advice and only used 2T of sugar-very sweet with only 1/4c!

I put my own spin on the sauce (decrease the sugar unless you like really really sweet sauce, I only use a shake). I followed the recipe for the meatballs pretty closely and they were fantastic.  I will definitely make them again.

All in all the recipe is not bad at all, pretty darn good in fact! Right balance of everything that is besides spices and herbs. For the meatballs I threw in finely chopped fresh parsley, 4 tbsp parmesan cheese, 1 tsp pepper, 1tbsp dried mixed herbs, 3 tsp garlic powder... and minor adjustments along the way. Also, I did brown the meatballs in a pan prior to letting them simmer in the sauce. This gives the meatballs a nicer texture and a meatier flavor. For the tomato sauce, I took the advice of another reviewer and dropped in 2-3 whole sprigs of parsley, and took them out prior to serving. Moreover, I definitely added a lot more herbs and seasoning while it cooked (pepper, sugar). You really do have to adjust these factors based on your own tastes, to each their own! A squirt of lemon juice when the dish was done gave it a good finish.

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT recipe!! It is the perfect homemade spaghatti recipe, comes out perfect everytime! I did take others suggestions and use: 1 can tomato paste instead of 3, 2 cups of water instead of two, 1 tbs sugar instead of 1/2 cup, and I add 1 (15oz) can tomato sauce...

I just made the meatballs but instead of ground beef I used ground turkey.  I baked them for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  Then let them simmer in the sauce for about in hour.  Turned out amazing. Definitely will make this again.

I've been making my spaghetti the same way for 20 years. I use a recipe my Mother made up using the spaghetti sauce packets, adding browned ground beef, tomato paste and water. This makes a very thick, rich meat sauce that my kids (27 and 17) absolutely love. I however, have grown tired of it and usually don't even eat it anymore when I make it for them. I really wanted to find a homemade spaghetti sauce recipe that I could adopt as a second option for weekends and special occasions. I love having a big pot of sauce simmering on the stove and how it smells up the whole house. I followed this recipe pretty much as written except I reduced the sugar to about 3 tsp and used dried oregano instead of fresh and omitted the parsley. I also used 36 oz of crushed tomatoes with 1 can of tomato paste and 1 can of tomato sauce. I also substituted one of the cups of water for red wine. This turned out wonderful! The meatballs were tender but held together well and it was so easy to roll them up and just drop into the sauce. I made them about 1 inch around and they were completely done in about 30 to 40 minutes just simmering on medium heat in the sauce. My only complaint is there weren't enough meatballs! Next time I might double them. I can't wait to make this again!

I really don't like to leave a bad review but hopefully this might help someone else wanting to make this recipe.  How on earth can the sauce need 1/2 cup sugar?  I was a bit skeptical so I used just over 1/4 cup (I'm not very experienced in cooking so I thought maybe they know something I don't) and it was still way too sweet.  Very disapointed.  The only redeeming feature were the meatballs.  They were good.  Will make them again but will use another sauce like Kays Spaghetti/Lasagne sauce from this site. Reading all of the other reviews - people gave it a higher rating because they either used a jarred sauce or they cut the sugar.  The recipe as written is pretty poor.

Beautiful!  I didn't have crushed tomatoes or tomato paste - But I did have a jar of plain old sauce.  I used that along with the rest of the recommended seasoning (dried oregano though).  Just fantastic!  Thanks Jenn!!!!!  My in-laws loved it!

I made the meatballs only. They were great and easy to make! My boys loved them too. I did use half ground sirloin and half ground turkey. I served with whole wheat spaghetti and a good jarred sauce. Great weeknight dinner!

I made this for dinner tonight but I have to admit, I made it the lazy way. I didn't have tomato paste so....I sauted the onion and garlic with some green pepper and just added a jar of spaghetti sauce and 1 small can of tomato sauce. Hit it with some fresh basil and rosemary, a little garlic salt and red pepper flakes and a dash *or five* of hot sauce. The meatballs cooked right at about 30 mins. It really was out of this world! Thank you so much for a fantastic recipe

I loved this recipe! Next time I'll double it to have extras to freeze. I stuck to the recipe other than not using fresh parsley (didn't have any and kids don't like anything green in their food!).  I also used 1/4 cup sugar rather than 1/2 cup and I loved how the sauce tasted, although my hubby thought it was a bit too sweet. This is a keeper!

I only made the meatballs, and cooked them in my crockpot with a jar of sauce. They came out so delicious, and I made sandwiches with them. The only thing I wasn't to fond of, was the fresh parsley. I will definetely make these again!

Another All Recipes winner. I altered seasonings and sugar to our taste. I'm going to have to double this recipe to find out if it freezes well.

Exceptional.  I decided to make the recipe without any of the suggestions that were offered and it was scrumptious!  Everyone loved it.  I will make it again and again.

This was the first time I've ever made homemade meatballs and it turned out pretty good. Although, next time I will add more garlic to the sauce--and more sauce in general. The amount here wasn't enough to cover all the meatballs so I had to add a jar of sauce I spruced up with some fresh garlic and onion. Overall though this was great and I would make it again! It definitely tastes better the day after!

Way WAY too sweet.  Otherwise it was lovely.  I made it a second time with 1/4 of the sugar and was pleased with the result.  I'll make it again (with less sugar).

I did not make the meatballs, so I'm rating just the sauce. I was getting sick of the canned spaghetti sauce I normally use, so I tried this - and it is so good! Seriously, I'm keeping this recipe for sure. I will try the meatballs once I have some leaner beef.

I used 5 cloves of garlic and a whole small onion. I added 4 hot italian sausages to the sauce and 1 sausage to the meatball mixture. I ended up using 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, 1 28 oz can of concentrated crushed tomatoes, 2 14 oz undrained cans of diced tomatoes and 2 6 oz cans of tomato paste. I did not add any water to the sauce. I used 2 rounded TBS of brown sugar. To the meatballs, I added a dash of W sauce, soy sauce, and garlic powder.

My boyfriend had been craving spaghetti and homemade meatballs "like his mom makes" - boy that's a lot to live up to, ay? Anyway, never having made homemade meatballs before I was looking for something simple but delicious. This was just the treat. I too, only made the meatballs, not the sauce. I took the advice of one of the cook's below and baked them first in the oven then a little bit in the sauce and they turned out amazing! I'm so excited to make it again. Easy and scrumptious.

This recipe would have been a five if not for the sauce. The sauce was way too thick- I would suggest adding an extra cup of water to it. Also, I only added a tablespoon and a 1/2 of sugar. I did not regret this and think it would have been gross otherwise. 

As for the meatballs, they were fantastic. I used 1/2 ground pork 1/2 ground beef. I also pan fried before putting them into the oven for 20 minutes at 350. After that, I poured the sauce on the meatballs. Try it with gorund pork and beef- it's much tastier and less gritty.

Made these meatballs for meatball subs.  Delicious, subtle flavor.  Had to use dried herbs, still fresh and wonderfully flavored.  Wow, even my husband, who has never liked my homemade meatballs, liked them!!!

Two stars because the meatballs were good but we did not care for the sauce. I wish I would not have strayed from my own sauce or in the least read the reviews first and cut back on the sugar, but then again the ratings are for the actual recipes and not everyone's own version of them. All four of my kid's would not eat it and my husband and I managed to get half of it down.  Sugar aside, we thought it was just too rich with tomato sauce and missed the veggies and meat in my regular sauce.

Great basic recipe. I have a homemade sauce that I like to use, but I used the meatball recipe- cooked in the sauce - and it turned out great! I did not change anything but will definitely experiment as always. Thanks!

This was so delicious! We loved it! I didn't have any tomato paste, so I used tomato sauce and just cut the water back to 1/2 a cup. I omitted the onion and cut the sugar way back (used maybe 2 tablespoons). I added a can of sliced mushrooms. The only thing I might do differently is to brown the meatballs before adding them to the sauce because they did seem to add some grease to the sauce. Other than that, it was perfect. Served it with Garlic Bread Fantastique from this site and a spinach salad. Perfect meal. Thank you!!!

I have to say that the 4 star rating is a compromise.  The meatballs are delicious and I would rate them as 5 stars.  The sauce was maybe 3 stars and I would not make it again.  I had modified the recipe according to other comments and had cut way back on the sugar to about 2 tablespoon s.  Still too sweet for my families tastes.  I also agree with other comments about the sauce being too thick.  If I were to try the sauce recipe again, I would use a teaspoon (maybe) of sugar and substitute tomato sauce for at least one of the cans of tomato paste.  I would also use more seasonings, but by then it wouldn't be this recipe any more!  I will definitely make the meatballs again, but use another sauce.

I took another reviewers advice and cooked the meatballs on a pan for about 10mins before combining them with the sauce. They didn't fall apart at all, and have stood up for 3 meals of leftovers!

I cut out the onions and threw in a chopped green pepper instead.

I used one can of pasta sauce (a bit of a cheat) and one can of tomato paste, instead of crushed tomatoes. Don't know if this made a big difference, but the sauce was a nice texture.

It also took much less than the allotted time. I cooked the meatballs for about 10mins, and then simmered the whole thing for maybe 30mins, and even then was a bit too long.

I just used the meatball recipe and it turned out perfectly..the only suggestion I have is maybe to add some onion and definetly some more spice!  They were a little bland.  I also baked them in the oven for 20 min @ 350 and then heated them in premade sauce to reduce the amount of grease.

I too only used the meatball section of this recipe and it was great!!  I have never made meatballs to go with spaghetti before so I was a little nervous and I would have never thought to simmer them in the sauce.  I thought that it would turn out greasy, but it didn't.  I was the only one who ate them because my husband hates anything with tomato sauce.  But I will be making these again:)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

Oh my sweet lord, if I'd used 1/2 cup sugar  for that little sauce, we'd have died on the spot from sweetness, and I like a sweet sauce, really I do.  I used two 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes and about 1/3 cup sugar, along with the rest of the ingredients adjusted accordingly, and it was just the right amount of sweet and salty.

Like others, i only used the meatball recipe and put them in my ragu sauce. They were easy and very tasty. i prepared a day early and let them sit in the sauce all night.  All the flavors came together really well and it was not greasy like i expected it to be. I will definately make this again.

The amount of sugar in this recipe made the sauce W A Y too sweet. I had to more than double the amount of tomato in the sauce in order for it to be edible. It still was a little too sweet for my taste even after that. Also when making the meatballs only 1 egg is needed, not 2.

Ok, so I never make/order spag. and meatballs because I'm from Italian descent and will only eat my family recipe, which is very time comsuming and I never get it right. Well, I tried this and it's w/out a doubt as close to authentic Northern Italian that I've ever tasted outside my family's kitchen! I gave 4 stars because I tweaked it by using 1 less can tomato paste and 1/3 cup sugar..way too sweet for my taste as written. Love that its in a slow cooker! Thanks a bunch Jenn!!!!

Our family really liked the sauce better than the meatballs. The sauce was a good base, I first cooked up about 4oz of italian sausage and after it was cooked put it in a food processor to grind down fine. Then added it to the onions and garlic and continued making the sauce. I added bellpepper, mushrooms, and onion powder. I reduced the sugar to less than 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet...can't imagine putting any more than that unless you like your spaghetti to taste like candy. Next time I will use my usual meatball recipe with this sauce. It was great to make a sauce from scratch rather than buying Ragu or Prego

Sauce was probably one of the first thing I ever attempted to make and I have made it many different ways ever since. Jenn, this is by far the best sauce I've had. I've made it twice so far, have altered nothing except quantities, and have been happy both times. Excellent recipe

I only made the meatballs - added them to some jar sauce - it was FABULOUS!!!  After rolling the meatballs, I placed them on a cookie sheet that I stuck in the freezer until they were firm and I put 1/2 of them away in a freezer bag to use at a later date.  My 20 month old that usually only eats chicken woofed down 2 of these!!  I will make these again - a nice change to regular pasta with meat sauce or sausage.

These meatballs are fantastic, great flavor and very tender. I usually brown meatballs in oil first, but these were so much easier and actually tasted better. I only added 2 tbls. sugar and also added some basil and italian seasoning to the sauce and it turned out great. Thanks, Jenn!

This recipe is so good!! I tend to lighten my recipes so I used ground turkey and only a Tbsp each of oil and   sugar. Added a bit of cayanne pepper and this sauce was absolutely perfect. I agree with the reviews that 1/4 cup of sugar is WAY too much. (Hence only 4 stars)

This was such an easy and delicious recipe!  It was just a touch too sweet.  Next time I'll either omit the sugar or just use a couple of tablespoons of it.  The meatballs were the best I've ever had!  They turned out very well and were so flavorful.  I'll make this again for sure!

However the meatballs I threw in boiling water for about 1 minute to remove some of the fat. Then I added them to the sauce.

I only used the meatball recipe, but it was so good that I can't wait to try the sauce too!  I used ground beef that had a very low fat content(I didn't want the fat renduring into my sauce).  They were tender and flavorful!  Great for pasta or even Meatball Subs!

This was really good.  I've made these a dozen times and have fine tuned the recipe. Instead of 3 cans of tomato paste, I just use one can and 1/8 cup of sugar. I add a 16oz can of tomato sauce to the receipe (you can keep the one cup of water). Definately use the fresh ingredients. I tried without and it's terrible. After it's cooked, transfer it to a slowcooker to warm for about an hour. I accidentally discovered this, but it enfuses all the flavors and gives a wonderful consistency to the sauce.

Overall this was excellent. However, I thought it was too sweet, so I had to add more tomatoes. I would recommend adding 1/4 cup or less. Start out with a little sugar and keep adding until it suites your taste. I used ground turkey for the meatballs and they were tender and delicious!

I do not like meatballs and I've tried several different recipes. BUT these are delish!!! I really like the way you cook them in the sauce, that in my book makes them so tender but not falling apart.  
Thank you Jenn!

Definitely a favorite! I would suggest adding a little less sugar, because I found the sauce a bit too sweet. Otherwise, this sauce is seasoned perfectly and makes for a easy dinner.

Great recipe!  I browned the meatballs in a pan before putting them in the sauce.  Also, I only put 1 tbsp. of sugar and substituted an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce for one of the cans of tomato paste.  Finally, I omitted the water.

Meatballs were GREAT.  BUt the sauce was too sweet and too bland.  I had to doctor it up a LOT and add extra water and more crushed tomatoes to mask some of the sweetness (and I didn't even use all of the sugar).  Then I still had to throw in a lot more garlic and other spices.  The meatballs are a keeper, but I won't be making this sauce again.

Delicious! I make my own sauce so all I did was follow the recipe for the meatballs and added them to my sauce. The meatballs had such great flavor! I will definitely be adding this to my recipe repertoire! :)

A good and authentic tasting sauce but I did cut down on the sugar to suit my family's tastes.

Omgg i loooooved the sauce especially just using bread to dip in it and eat it soooo yummy. I didnt like the meatballs so much next time i'll just fry it or bake it instead. I like to always read reviews but never get around to actually writing one myself but i felt really complelled to this time, the sauce was too amazing not to rave about it. Already cant wait till the next time i cook it again lol

Made this as is only cut back to 2 teaspoons of sugar(rule is 1 teaspoon for every can of tomatoes) or it is toosweet. Sugar is meant to cut the acid in the tomatoe. Otherwise this is a great receipe.

The first time I made this I didn't have all the tomato styles I needed so I used a jar of spaghetti sauce and some tomato sauce. I thought it was a little too sweet but my dad enjoyed it. I'll reduce the sugar a little bit but otherwise I love this recipe, especially for the meatballs!

This ended up tasting too bland for me but I am not sure why. It looks like it should have had a lot of flavor. I ended up throwing in a bunch more spices like thyme and a little worcestershire and even powdered garlic which was on top of the garlic cloves already in the recipe. 

Also, if you make this I recommend putting something chunky in the sauce for texture... like mushrooms or olives.

Love this recipe.  I substituted onion with some Mrs. Dash onion and herb seasoning and I used dried bay leaf flakes that I had.  These where the only changes I made and it was wonderful!  I agree with the other reviews about the sweetness and next time I will use less sugar.  I can't wait until summer when I can try using my own fresh tomatoes and herbs.

Did not care for this recipe...way too much sugar. I llike my sauce sweet, but 1/2 was too much.  The meatballs were okay.  There is another spaghetti and meatballs recipe on this site "Italian spaghetti and meatballs" is the name of the recipe (I think). That recipe is great.

This was pretty good.  I cut the sugar down quite a bit and it still was a bit too sweet.  I think the next time I make this I will add a bunch of vegetables to the mix because the sauce was a bit overpowering as far as tomato flavor goes.  Thanks for a good base recipe though!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Very good as written and adaptable if you need/want to substitute things (e.g. I like the meatballs with a ground beef/sweet Italian sausage combo).  My secret ingredient that I add to the sauce while simmering is the "rind" (outer) end of a Parmesan cheese wedge - simmer until it melts into the sauce.   You'll thank yourself for taking the time to make this from "scratch" rather than just opening a jar!

I get so many compliments on this dish. These meatballs are wonderful. Everyone who has eaten them seem to want to know what I put in them and how I make them. I also put the meatballs in a slow cooker and that is an amazing way to cook the meatballs. I didn't care for the sauce, but the meatball recipe is definitely worth making.

I didn't like the way the meatballs cooked in the sauce. Next time I will cook them seperately. Also the sauce was way too sweet, I will cut the sugar at least by half or more the next time I make it.

Absolutely delicious! Made with ground turkey because that's what I had on hand. Husband took for lunch the next day and said it was even better than dinner night before! Froze half the meatballs for a later date and can't wait to use them again!

I have to rate this based on the original recipe.  The sauce is WAY TOO SWEET!  My kids wouldn't eat it.  I kept the meatballs (they weren't bad).  Perhaps I'll try one of the modified versions next time.

This is a great recipe for an inexperienced cook.  What I learned  with this recipe is that I should have all of the ingredients ready before turning on the oven.    My family thoroughly enjoyed the meatballs, even my finicky teenage daughter!  The only change I would make next time is that I would use lelss sugar in the sauce.  Thanks for a keeper!

The meatballs were great!!  Usually I buy the premade meatballs that have pork in them also and these were just as good!  The sauce was good too, I left out the sugar but added about a cup of very finely chopped carrots.  Cooked in slow cooker for 5 hours on low.

I gave this interesting recipe  three stars due to the fact that the meatballs were not seared first.  Also, I only used 2T of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes.  I added 1 T of basil, 1T balsamic vinegar and fresh mushrooms to the sauce.  The meatballs were too dry as I mixed them, so I added a splash of skimmed milk to be absorbed with the breadcrumbs (as my mother did before me).  I only used one can of paste; three would have made the sauce too thick.    Warming the meatballs in the sauce was a method my mother and grandmother used every time they made sauce.  They did not cook the meatballs in the sauce due to the fact that they were concerned about uncooked meat in the sauce!  I put the sauce and meatballs in my slow cooker for an hour before serving (at low temperature), which was very convenient.  This recipe does not need extra S&P.

My family thought this was very good and I loved being able to use fresh parsley and oregano from my garden. I did follow the suggestions to lessen the sugar to only 1T (and really could have left it out entirely-the paste adds enough sweetness in my opinion). I also browned the meatballs first before adding to the sauce and then cooked everything in the crock pot on low for about 3 hours.

I too found this too sweet, but everyone has their own taste and I can't fault it for that, since it's an individual preference.  I think it is a good starter but made some changes.  I like to use my own whole tomatoes that I've cooked and reduced instead of paste and crushed tomatoes-- I had a ton in my garden and had frozen it for later use. Yum!

Delicious meatballs! I used a different sauce recipe, but incorporated some elements from this one, which made it even better. The meatballs were so soft and delicious after simmering in the sauce. I think the only thing I changed was I added Worcestershire sauce and omitted the parmesan (making for a person who doesn't like cheese), only 1 egg... that's it. It got rave reviews.

This rating is for the the meatballs only.  This is my go to whenever I make spaghetti and meatballs.  My husband loves it so much that I had to make it twice in one week. I added a dash of sugar and used italian spices instead bc I didn't hv oregano.

I followed the recipe except I only used a 12oz  can of tomato paste.  Red pepper seeds were added for a little punch.  The meatballs actually cooked nicely.

This was great. I simmered it in a crock pot on low for 3 hours and it absorbed so much flavor. I did it a second time and didn't use the crock pot and did as recipe directs and felt it lacked the flavor, so simmer longer if you have the time.

It was good but I found it way to sweet! It's was the first time of me making spaghetti go the ammount of sugar didn't much pop out at me. I followed the recipe completely. So it was good but it would be much much better with less sugar and trying maybe instead of hamburger meat...give sausage for a try?

This was excellent.  Very flavorful and easy.  I also added small chunks of Italian sausage to the sauce.  I let it chill and then removed as much fat as possible. This got high ratings from the family.

Has potential to be 5 stars.  I made recipe as written but was way too sweet.  Had to add some lemon juice and other spices to save.  Next time I will make as written except start with very small amount of sugar and add it to taste. Still turned out good and my son said this was the best spaghetti recipe I've made so far.

Great recipe.  I used 96/4 lean meat and it still had alot of flavor and was great.  Used only 2 1/2 tsp. sugar and in my opinion it was still sweet.  Overall, it was really good and I'd plan to make it again and again.

This is excellent - with a few changes. 1. Cut the tomato paste to two cans (12 ounces) 2. Use 2 cups of liquid, substituting some of the water with wine (I used 1/2 c. wine, 1 1/2 c. water) 3. cut the sugar to just 2 T. 4. add 1 tsp each of seasoned salt and Cajun. With these changes, this was a hit. For the meatballs I used ground chicken and omitted the cheese. I served them over rice. The kids wanted triples.

I tried this recipe after my DH requested homemade spaghetti and meatballs. My sauce turned out way too greasy, watery, and sweet....cut way back or omit the sugar and water. OTOH the meatballs held up well and were good, it was the sauce I had issues with. Shockingly, my "from scratch" husband requested I go back to frozen meatballs and bottled sauce in the crockpot.

Love these meatballs, Jen!  Instead of Italian bread crumbs I use a mixture of Panko bread crumbs and corn muffin mix (half and half of each).  Just a preference...not a huge fan of regular bread crumbs.  The corn muffin mix really makes the meatballs moist.  I also cut the parm cheese by about half simply b/c I'm not a huge cheese fan...so this is the perfect amount for me.  I just use dried parsley instead of fresh (that's what I usually have), and I add a little powdered garlic and extra salt to the meatball mixture.  For the sauce, I start with one can of diced tomatoes (garlic and basic if I have it), one small can of tomato sauce, and then one small can of paste.  I use dried oregano and cut way down on the sugar (only about a Tbsp. or so).  I then add a bottle of Newman's Own marinara sauce to the whole mix.  I've tried it both ways (like the original recipe) and they are both great...I prefer to add the bottled marinara sauce as it adds richness and cuts down on time.  This is usually a Friday night meal, and I usually don't have much time on Fridays to cook.  Love this recipe, thanks!

This is my first time ever making my own spaghetti sauce and boy was it a winner.  Just cut back a little on the sugar and for my own personal likings add some sauted red pepper and watch out!!!  Definitely a recipe to remember.

Review is for meatballs only! I needed a recipe using ingredients I had on hand so there were a few substitutions. Ground chuck instead of round, and dried parsley (3 tbsp), oregano (1 tbsp) and garlic (1 tbsp) instead of fresh. Kids loved them, even the pickiest 9 year old. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

This is fabulous!  As always I made a few changes but Jenn definitely has the perfect base recipe.  Substituted 3 cans tomatoe paste for 1 tomatoe paste, 1 tomatoe sauce and 1 can water.  Diminished the sugar to only 2 Tbsp. (don't like it sweet...the crushed tomatoes add enough sweet). Also added 1 can of chicken broth in addition to the 1 cup of water.  Added 2 tsp garlic powder as well.  Make sure to salt the meat adequately so that it brings out the flavor in the other seasonings.  I added a little garlic to the meat as well.  THANKS JENN!!

This is great!  My husband even liked it and he doesn't usually care for pasta.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef since we don't eat red meat.  I see that some people didn't like that much sugar but we loved it!  Will definitely make again. (Makes a great meatball sandwich, too)

I made a few of the changes suggested by other reviewers (i.e. less sugar, less tomato paste) & thought the taste was delicious.  The meatballs turn out very tender and tasty, too.  This always makes a lot, so I freeze it for future meals.  It tastes great even after being thawed!

Wonderful sauce. We all enjoyed this dish. I pre-browned the meatballs because I just had to. I used dried minced onion. My husband liked this well enough to comment on how good it was. Thanks Jenn!

This recipe is delicious and easy!!  A tip- add sugar or splenda at the end of the cooking time to keep sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pan too much!

Horrible sauce due to the sugar. Don't put sugar in! I'm trying to figure out how to redeem the sauce...we'll see if anything works. Meatballs were good but totally overpowered by the sweetness of the sauce.

We had ground lamb, so I adjusted the recipe for 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 lamb.  The result was a less "meaty" taste, and very delicious.  I was tentative to add the full 1/2 cup of sugar, so I only added about 1/4 cup.  Next time, however, I will use 1/4 white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I think that will bring out the flavors.  We will make these again for sure!

Super good! I didn't have time to run out and get fresh herbs so I used some dried herbs and it turned out fine.

This recipe was fantastic.  I did add salt to the meat balls, and added 2 cups of water instead of 1 to the sauce, also left out most of the sugar.  It was AWESOME.

The meatballs were so moist and delicious!  I followed other reviewers recommendations and used a mix of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce.  I cut the sugar to about 1/4 cup, and I thought even that was too sweet, but it was still VERY tasty.

I was in desperate need of a true authentic spaghetti and meatball recipe and this one fit the bill.  I made this recipe as is except I completely omitted the sugar from the sauce.  It was delicious!  The sauce was delicious and the meatballs moist and tender!  I will make this recipe again and again!  It was a big hit with my husband and kids! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I prefer a stronger flavored marinara, more herbs. As written this is bland for my taste and way too sweet. Can't imagine that amount of sugar - yikes, I only added 2 tsp. I added mushrooms, sauteed along with the onions.  After it cooked for a while after tasting I dumped a bunch more herbs in; basil, thyme, more oregano. Still something seems missing. The meatballs were very good, I used 93% lean ground turkey and worked great. The meatballs bumped my rating from 2 to 3.

This was very good! I'm reviewing this recipe only for the meatballs. I used a different recipe for the sauce. I made it as written except I baked mine at 400* for 20 minutes. Then I added them to the sauce. I was very skeptical about using so much parsley and oregano, but they complimented each other very nicely. This recipe is even better than the meatballs from the famous Rao's Restaurant in Harlem, N.Y... I think I'll use this recipe from now on! And that's tough for an old-fashioned Italian girl to admit!!!

Very good sauce and meatballs. Easy to make. I like sweet sauce, but I did cut the sugar down a bit. I'd say add the sugar to taste. Meatballs were very good -- not dry at all. I used a meatball mix of meat (beef, pork and veal) as opposed to just beef. Very good. As a family of four, I made the sauce as called for in the recipe, but only put in half of the meatballs. The other half, I froze individually. Then, I froze half of the sauce, I will combine these two another night for another dinner (in the crockpot maybe), but am thrilled that most of my prep work is done. Did have some leftover meatballs from tonights meal, and am planning on putting those on a hoagie bun with some moz. cheese on top; throw it under the broiler and have some meatball subs for lunch tomorrow.

These meatballs are absolutely delish! I substituted the canned tomato paste with sauce that I had to use up and I only used 1 tsp of sugar in the sauce. Very easy to make and the meatballs stayed together

Not really "out of this world", I'd say.  Meatballs weren't bad and were pretty tender, but the sauce was marginal.  I'd use your own sauce if you insist on trying this recipe.

The meatballs were so good. I will continue to use that recipe. However, I thought the sauce had too much sugar in it. And not enough seasoning. So I will use my other sauce recipe and use this one for the meatballs.

I use the meatball recipe all the time.  It is great just as is.  The sauce recipe is a little sweet for my taste so I cut that in half.  Overall a great recipe that I will continue to use for years.

I have made this twice now, to rave reviews - and it was eaten by my 4 year old twin daughters and their 3 year old little friend. Great recipe - the longer you let it simmer, the better it is. I did brown my meatballs first. Even the nice Irish boy I married (I am Italian) loves this - he has a reflux issue and this gravy is a little sweeter. Thanks very much for posting this recipe!

I made some changes as suggested - little less tomato paste, less sugar - but other than followed recipe exactly.  This is probably the best recipe I've found on this site, and I've been using this site for many years.  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!!

Freakin' awesome!!! The meatballs are so tender, and without all the grease of frying or baking them first.  I put a few tablespoons of sugar plus a few of grape jelly in and the sweetness was just right.  I doubled both the sauce and meatballs and now can share with my parents and have leftovers during the week. A+++

This was really good, but it took me MUCH longer than the stated times.  I would make this again, but only if I quadrupled the recipe and put some in the freezer for later.

Fantastic!  Tried this out before I was going to make it for a group of friends on my Italian son in law.  "This is amazing" were his exact words.  His brother who just got home from Iraq will be having the leftovers tonight, looking forward to his comments as well. I used ground round and pork mixed together and more garlic and more crushed tomatoes, as I like a chunkier sauce.  Nice job Jenn!

i went by the recipe almost exactly and it turned out PERFECT! i made a few other adjustments like adding more garlic because it seemed too bland. i also did NOT add 1/2 cup sugar i only added 1 tablespoon, and it was still a little sweet. i also suggest adding maybe one more egg so the meat hold together more. after simmering in the sauce for forty minuets it starts to fall apart. but over all it was wonderful!!!

I made these today although they will not be eaten until tomorrow. I made them well in advance because tomorrow is going to be a busy day. I reduced the amount of sugar A LOT... only about 3 Tablespoons (and I only used that much because I wanted to cut the acid of the tomatoes). I also changed up the tomato ratio- used tomato paste and cans. I also used seasoning salt. Yeah, I changed some stuff but it turned out very good(the one I just tasted) and I bet they will be good tomorrow too. Thanks for the recipe, I think its a keeper!

Meatballs were very good.  The sauce was very sweet though.  Next time I won't add any sugar.  Overall, it was pleasing to my taste buds.

A favorite of ours.  Slight variation for making  slow cooker version....after following the recipe for step one, I put everything in a slow cooker on high for about 2 and a half hours.  Stir gently about every 45 minutes.  Really makes the house smell wonderful, and everyone is eager to dig in when they get home.

I used dried oregano, 1/4 cup sugar and forgot to add my breadcrumbs, and it was still 5 stars.  I doubled the recipe and froze two batches.  I will never buy jarred pasta sauce again.

Made this for my husband last night and it was delicious! I don't usually rate a recipe unless I make it as written, but a did make a few small changes based on reviews of others.  I only added 2 Tbs of sugar & that was plenty.  Also added extra garlic and 1/2 cup red wine.  The meatballs were heavenly!  Fresh herbs are a must for this recipe!

This was the first spaghetti and meatballs I made for my toddlers.  It was such fun to watch them suck up the noodles.  I made the modifications others suggested, cutting sugar to 1/4 cup and using 2 cups of water instead.  I also used 1 can tom. paste, 2 cans tom. sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 fresh tomato from the garden.  I did use fresh herbs and think that is important (vs. dried).  The meatballs were perfect as stated in the recipe.  Will make again for sure.

OMG!Is all i have to say. I mean it was sweet, savory and so full of goodness. I didn't have a bay leaf so i put some sweet basil instead and it was awesome. My husband hates any kind of pasta, but with this recipe he all but licked the plate. I'm defintely going to use this recipe the next time I have to entertain. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks so Much!!!!

UPDATE: I had SO many leftovers, I felt guilty letting them go to waste. Made myself a MB sandwich on toasted garlic bread. The MB's tassted better after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. Much better as a sandwich. Made this for dinner (I was craving meatballs!). Both my bf & I didn't find this dish to be "out of this world". I had high hopes for the meatballs, but not the sauce. The meatballs were good, the sauce "OK". Here are the changes I made: a) used 1/2 c. red wine and 1/2 c. water in the sauce, b) subbed dried herbs for fresh, c) subbed Italian seasoning for oregano (4 t), d) added slightly more onion (maybe 1 T more), e) only used 2 T white sugar & browned meatballs in a little oil before adding to the sauce to simmer. I accidentally added 4 T dried parsley instead of 4 t (I read that 1 t dried herbs should be subbed for every T fresh - there are 4 T in 1/4 c), and it didn't affect the taste. I also added spicy Italian sausage (1 in. pieces) to the sauce. It takes a lot of effort to prepare the meatballs. For the effort involved, I'd rather use my mom's recipe. Unfortunately, she can't find hers and doesn't know it from memory or else I would have. I'll keep looking for a good meatball recipe and just prepare arrabbiata sauce by Ellen (on this site), omitting the red pepper to make marinara. Thanks for sharing!

The meatballs were fannntastic!  I did omit one of the eggs (to lower the cholesterol) and substituted 1/4 milk, which kept them very moist.  I was in a hurry, so I didn't make the homemade sauce, but they were still great cooked in the jarred variety!  I wound up letting them simmer for about three hours (because we had a family emergency and I left them cooking), but I think that actually worked as a benefit, because they were SO tender and juicy!  I didn't have ground round, so I used ground chuck...but next time I will make a point to get the leaner meat for this recipe because there was quite a bit of grease in the sauce that I had to skim off.  I actually may try letting these slow cook in sauce in my crockpot next time, since the extra cook time made them so darn juicy.  Overall, great meatballs!! I'll never cook them in the oven again! Thanks!

This was just so so for me, but my other eaters liked it. If you like SUPER tender, I'm talking almost mushy meatballs this would work. I prefer mine with some firmness so this wasn't my cup of tea.

this recipe is 100 times better than my aunts S and M....It is incredibly easy since you don't have to fry the meatballs...they just cook in the sauce! The sauce is so tasty...better than prego....but please only use 1/4 c of sugar...1/2 makes it wayy to sweet. I use the leftover sauce for "the worlds greatest lasagna" on this site.

Sauce is way, way, way too sweet - it kinda ruined the meal, but the meatballs make up for it. And way easy to cook in the sauce! Loved that! Also, I decided to kick it up a notch and built each meatball around a cube of mozzerella! YUMMY! Stuffed meatballs are the BEST!

I swayed away from the recipe I have used for years. Mostly just to try something new. For me I just wasnt impressed. The sauce and meatballs were very bland. I had to add more garlic and some bell peppers to try and save it. I dont get the 5 star rating at all. Sorry.. not trying to be mean or anything.It was just nothing special.

Just made the meatballs but they came out great. I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes to get the fat off and then threw them in the sauce for 10 and boiled it together.

I was looking for a recipe (long lost after my wife threw out a cookbook) that simulated my favorite meatball recipe.  I used ground turkey, omitted the eggs (accidentally) and made some minor modifications to the sauce. I was afraid to add 3 can's of paste so I just used 2 - increasing the meatballs by 50%.  I should have added red wine but didn't.    Thank you for the recipe. With just some minor additional mods, I can make it like I used to.

This is really good when its been cooking all day in the crockpot. The only thing is I would leave out almost all of the sugar. The sweetness is overpowering but a really good recipe besides that and the meatballs are really good too.

This is the perfect "standard" spaghetti and meatballs recipe - tastes exactly as you'd expect! Only gave it 4 stars because it lacked that "wow" factor for me, but I've made it a few times now because its so quick and easy, and soooooo much better than canned sauce with meatballs!

I've made this recipe several times now and it's one of my husbands favorites.  The meatballs are very flavorful and tender and the sauce is delish.  I can't give it 5 stars as written because I feel it is way too sweet.  I cut the sugar in half.  Other than that, we love it!  Makes great meatball sandwiches the next day.

Excellent. The whole family gave it a 5. I followed the recipe for the meatballs exactly. I did cheat on the sauce, using premade. I was hesitant to add the meatballs to the sauce without browning first but I went for it & they are so tender! Delish . . .thanks for sharing. I make this all the time.  I think the amazing thing about this recipe is that you can throw the meatballs into the sauce raw & they cook up deliciously!

I added 1 Tbsp of sugar and some tomato sauce.  I didn't have fresh oregano but had fresh basil from my garden, and some dried basil as well.  Added that and the meatballs and sauce were excellent.  I just cooked mine in the crockpot all day.

I used only the recipe for the meatballs with my own sauce.  I made large meatballs which held together well and cooked up tender and juicy.  My children loved them!  I thought they were good (not out of this world) and the texture was just right, so I will use this recipe again and doctor a little with more seasonings.  I would recommend more garlic and parm cheese from the green can - I used the real thing and couldn't taste it at all.

The sauce would have been REALLY good if it wasn't for the sweetness. Cut waaay back on the sugar. I used 1/4c but it was still too much.

This was a delicious recipe!  We used extra lean ground beef for the meatballs and they were still moist and tasty. Following other reviewers advice, we reduced the sugar to 2 tbsp which was about the right amount if you like a slightly sweet sauce.  We also added a little fresh basil and used whole peeled tomatoes, which we tore apart before adding; this makes a chunkier sauce. This tastes even better the next day so make it a day ahead if you can.

I made this about a year ago and forgot to review, but I would like to say the meatballs were amazing ... we even made extra and baked them in the oven. The spaghetti sauce was excellent too, sweet sauce just isn't my preference. But as sweet sauces go, it was excellent :D good deal.

Two tablespoons sugar instead of 1/2 cup is the answer! This is an excellent recipe.  The meat balls are tender and delicious.  After reading many of the reviews stating that the sauce was to sweet I added only two tablespoons instead of the 1/2 cup that is called for.  This seemed to be the answer to perfect this spaghetti sauce.  My family's favorite.

Keeping this recipe for the meatballs - they are good and I'd give them 41/2 stars. The sauce I would give a 2 - just too sweet. I made it despite reading all the reviews bez I thought I might like a sweet sauce (I love anything with tomatoes!) but I just didn't like this, and I won't make it again. Going to try some other spaghetti sauce recipes on this website.

The meatballs were fabulous, but the sauce was almost inedible!  Maybe I did something wrong, but the sauce was thick, pasty, and waaaay too sweet.  I might try to meatballs with store-bought sauce next time...

extremely tasty meatballs and sauce. didn't give it a 5* rating because i made quite a bit of changes. we like our sauces very hot, so i used quite a bit of red chilli sauce and no sugar. was out of fresh oregano and parsley, so i used fresh cilantro and a good sprinkling of dried oregano in both the sauce and the meatballs. when making the sauce, after i saute`ed the onions and garlic, i added chopped fresh button mushrooms and sauteed for about 5 mins or so before adding the tomatos. mushrooms certainly added to the taste. the meatballs looked too mushy to hold its shape, so i added about half a cup of oats and it held its shape well. all in all the result was great. very tasty. my mom loved and has asked me to make it again soon.

I really liked the meatballs. They were firm and didn't fall apart in the sauce. I did make the whole thing in my crockpot and it worked great! My kids complained it was too sweet. Can't please anyone! I may make this again and substitute some of the tomato paste (the cause of the sweetness?) for more crushed tomatoes.

The meatballs were perfect. I used extra lean white turkey and they were delicious. The sauce tasted OK, but seemed to be missing a few things for my taste so I added rosemary, basil, and thyme. The sauce was excellent after the additions. And I let it sit on simmer all day. Also, I only put about 1 TB of sugar. Would have been way too sweet with the recommended amount. Will make again.

I made this for dinner last night... YUM! My husband & I loved it, and it was so easy just to cook the meatballs in the sauce. I did only add 1/4 cup of sugar like others suggested, but over-all this was delicious! Will definately have again.

Awesome!  Reminded me of when I was a kid.  A little too sweet for the family so next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  My husband commented that a "can or two of those mushrooms would be good" -- will try that next time.  The convenience of letting the meatballs simmer was terrific!  Served with Mozzarella Garlic French Bread and we have a winner on our hands.

I made few changes to the recipe (I added black olives and one green chilly pepper to make it hotter, and used less sugar), and over all it was very easy to make.  I served it with tri color ritini pasta, because I didnt have spaghetti, and it was great.
we loved it, and will make it again.
I also submitted a photo.

This recipe did not come out at all. I thought it was odd that the meatballs weren't browned first. They didn't cook well in the sauce because they were too mushy. I ended up taking them out of the sauce and trying to brown them. They still came out mushy! The whole recipe was a disaster! I don't know what mistake I may have made, but I don't dare attempt to make this again.

The flavor was there but I overcooked mine. My girlfriend told me that I was overcooking it but the time was way off so I must have had the stove too high. It was still really good, but it would have been amazing if the burn flavor wasn't there. Don't overdo it, if you think it is done, it probably is.

I've made this twice so far in the last couple of weeks. My family loves it, even my picky kids. The only change I made (because I didn't have oregano) was adding basil in place of it, and it's quite tasty. It's not too much hassle, and the flavor is delicious! Up until I found this recipe, I had always made my great-grandmother's "porcupine balls," (meatballs with rice mixed in--also delicious), but this one is just slightly easier. Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic and totally revived my interest in spaghetti and meatballs.  I just added a little Montreal steak seasoning to the meatballs, which may not have even been necessary.

Okay. For everyone looking for a a stupendish sweet spagetthi sauce, do not take some of these reviews seriously. Make as listed, this sauce is superb. NO Substitutions are necessary. This is a super delicious, thick sweet sauce. DO NOT alter the recipe.  This one is a winner. For those people who think they need to do so, submit your own recipe.

The best meatballs and sauce I have ever made and had.  I only used half the amount of sugar after the second time I made the sauce :)

I made this tonight - it was very good. I followed the recipe exactly; I will reduce the sugar by 50% next time but otherwise it is delicious! Even my picky husband liked it.

Made this with gluten free breadcrumbs and thought it was just okay.  I think it was way to sweet with that much sugar.

The sauce was very good as were the meatballs.  Just delicious!  The only change I’d make, is a scant less sugar, maybe 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup, otherwise this was quick, easy, and an instant favorite!

I've been told that "real Italians" don't simmer their spaghetti sauce all day.  Given that, I should say that I am not Italian so that could explain why I prefer my sauce cooked a while.  But, for a sauce cooked a short while,  this was very tasty indeed.  I always put in more garlic, other than that I found this to be quite good.

This was good despite the fact that I screwed up and put all the garlic and oregano in the sauce instead of  saving half for meatballs. Sauted the garlic in onion powder and olive oil. Husband does not like onions.  Did not use all the sugar either. And used 1 can of tomato paste.  The meatballs were pretty good despite the lack of spices.  I baked them 15 min b4 adding to sauce. I will make this again.

This is the best Meatball and Sauce recipe I have used. Very easy to follow. I did add a large can of tomato puree and omitted the sugar as I do  not  like a sweet sauce.  My family really enjoyed the dinner to put it mildly. Husband likened it to one of our favorite Italian restaurants. 
This will definitely be served again and again. My new go to recipe. Meatballs cooked in the sauce --- so much better.

We totally loved this meal. It was fun to make, easy and even my 7 yr old liked it!!  Per one of the comments, I also changed it a bit by caramelizing the onions on the  pan before throwing them in the casserole and it tasted just perfect!

I would cut the sugar in half, but that is more of a personal preference.  It is good with the full sugar if you care for a sweeter sauce.  I think the fresh oregano makes all the difference.

Meatballs are good but I wish I read the reviews. Sauce was WAY too sweet. When I first tried it was disgusting so I actually just added doubles of all the other sauce ingredients to dilute it a bit. Even after that I still found it too sweet. I would put in 2 tbsp of sugar for this recipe.

I've been making this recipe for a few years and it's going to probably be one I use forever.  I made a few small changes, based on other reviews and my own tastes:  I brown 1/2 lb lean ground beef with the onion and garlic, to make a meaty sauce.  I add a 16-oz can of fire-roasted tomatoes along with two cans of regular crushed tomatoes.  I only use one can of tomato paste but add a can of tomato sauce; add a cup of red wine; cut the sugar to 1 tbsp; add some fresh or dried basil.  The meatballs I make exactly as written.  No need to bake them; they are tender and cooked perfectly when allowed to simmer in the sauce.  This is such a great recipe; thank you, Jenn!

As has been stated before the sauce was just too sweet. I think that adding a little bit of the chopped onion to the meatballs would really add the flavor kick they need. But over all a very good recipe.

My family ate all the leftovers, normally I when I have a leftover dinner  night, I hear complaining but no one did. I felt it made a good amount, plenty for 2lbs of pasta. I did reduce sugar to 1/4 c as suggested and I do like a sweeter sauce,  thought that was plenty. I used dried vs fresh parsley, to me it just doesnt give any flavor for the extra work and expense. I was happy with how quickly this sauce came together, including the meat cooking. I also added some beef tips to the sauce for variety.

This came out really good! I made it exactly as follows but thought 3 cans of tomato paste and half a cup of sugar was too much. I adjusted to 1 can tomato paste and 1/4 cup of sugar and more water. It seemed to taste great. My husbands exact words were "amazing"....which I haven't heard in awhile! My kids also loved it too!

This is the BEST spaghetti and meatballs I've ever tasted!  Lots of ingredients and takes a little time, but is SO well worth it.  I highly recommend it.  Serve with warm, toasty garlic bread, a ceasar salad and a great cab and impress the best!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Instead of cooking the meatballs in the sauce, I baked them in the oven for 10 mins. on one side, and then I flipped them over and cooked for another 8 mins.  I did not want all the grease to get into the sauce.  A little less sugar would be recommended for the sauce.  If you love garlic, leave as is.  If not, decrease garlic to two cloves overall.  Otherwise this recipe is fabulous!

The recipe was amazing!!  I made half of the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 20 mins, then added to sauce.  The ones I added to the sauce before baking, kind of crumbled up unfortunately.  I also only added 1 tbsp of sugar, but other than that I did not change anything else.  The sauce was absolutely delicious and the whole family loved it.  I will defiantly make again and again!!  Makes a large batch, so I will probably freeze half.  Delicious!!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I did take the suggestions and added less sugar, 1 1/2 can tomato paste, and I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to balance the sweetness. The sauce is excellent and the meatballs are out of this world! It makes all the difference when you cook them in the sauce. I have made this 3 times already, the last time I doubled the batch and took it to work to share. Everyone loved it. Thank you for taking the time to share this awesome recipe.

For a quick and easy meal, I just made the meatballs and cooked them on a cooking sheet at 350 for 35min.  Then (after refrigerating for a while) I put them in with my fav spaghetti sauce and let them heat through.  Pour over spaghetti and...wha-la!

It was too sweet and the meatballs were ok. Not worth all of the work or at least come back on the sugar.

Have to give these meatballs 5 stars even though I did not use the sauce recipe simply because I like the one I usually make.  After tasting the meatballs, I may try the sauce next time too as I'm sure it's delicious.  I had about 1-1/2 pounds of ground beef so upped the bread crumbs and the cheese.  To be honest, I think I overdid it, at least the bread crumbs.  I used about a cup even though half again as much would have been 3/4 cup.  Next time I will definitely start with 1/2 cup, even for 1-1/2 pound ground beef.  I grated parmesan cheese using the fine grater side and probably put about 3/4 cup of that in. The flavour was good on that.  I tasted a meatball last night (when I made it) and was actually a tiny bit disappointed because to me it seemed squishy somehow -- a definite bread crumb problem.  The flavour was great though so I just thought, next time I'll cut back.  Well today we had meatball sandwiches (on a nice crusty baguette) and -- well, the meatballs tasted out of this world!!  I guess resting in the sauce made a big difference.  I will still cut back on the bread crumbs (sort of a "when in doubt, follow the directions" type moment LOL), but that was my goof, not the recipe.  You can't beat the flavour and the ease of preparation.  I did pan fry them a bit before putting in the sauce but baking would be good too.  Takes a nice spaghetti dinner to a whole new level.  Thank you for sharing.

Doesn't take long to make this and it's pretty simple to make! My husband loves the sauce and says it's restaurant quality! The only change I made was that I used 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it was much better the second time around!

The rating is for the meatballs only (always use store bought sauce- too time consuming to make the sauce AND the meatballs for a large group). Loved them! The recipe is a great starter recipe- easy to customize based on individual preferences.

I made the recipe as listed with the following exceptions: used dried oregano and parsley versus fresh and only used 3/4 of the sugar called for.  The meatballs are perfect but the sauce is way too sweet, even with me cutting it down.  Other than the sweetness, it is good so I will definitely make again but will likely only use 2-3 Tbsp of sugar.

Best authentic meatballs I have ever made!  I usually triple this recipe. On nights when we have football or other activities, I bake the meatballs at 375° for 25 minutes.  In the meantime I'm cooking the sauce on the stove.  I then add the meatballs to the sauce.  I cook for an additional 10 minutes.

My family and I love this recipe. I make it all of the time. I increase the water to 1 cup and reduce the sugar to a 1/4 a cup and its perfect. I will never buy canned spaghetti sauce again.

This rating is for the sauce only..I used my own recipe for the meatballs. I followed this recipe exactly. The only change I made was that I did half a recipe. I thought the sweetness and amount of tomato paste was fine, but could see how it may not be right for some people. It reminded me of a sauce that a friend used to make back in Chicago and I would make this again.

This was so tasty!  Doubled the meatballs and used half sausage and half hamburger.  I would, however, recommend cutting the sugar in half.  Everyone loved it!

Love these meatballs!  This is my go to recipe for meatballs.  I haven't tried the sauce part, but have made the meatballs many times.  They are so tender, moist and delicious!  The only drawback is grease in the sauce.  I skim it off because I tried baking these first once and the texture just wasn't the same.  My SUPER picky 5 year old LOVES these like the rest of us.  Thanks for a great go-to recipe!

This was extremely easy to make and delicious.  My toddlers, husband and I gobbled it up!  So nice not to have to brown the meatballs first. This worked out perfectly.  Thanks!!!

I absolutely love this recipe! The meatballs are fabulous. I do cut corners and use a jarred sauce from time to time. Everyone who's eaten these has raved and wanted the recipe. Thanks Jenn!

I thought this recipe came out pretty well.  I omitted the sugar and added some carrot.  I used oatmeal in the meatballs instead of bread crumbs.

my rating is sauce only as i didn't make the meatballs either time - but i did split the batch following exactly, and following my instincts.  i do agree with other posters who reduced the tomato paste, and consequently the sugar.  i used a 30oz can crushed tomato, a squirt from concentrated paste in a tube, and a 15oz can fire roasted diced tomatoes (i then put a stick blender in to get rid of all tomato/onion/garlic chunks which DH doesn't like) because i used my last can of sauce on the 'to a T' version.  i used 2T sugar and added approx 1.5 cans water to taste.  Here is the kicker:  the next time I made it I started off with a HOT salted cast iron dutch oven.  i quickly browned 1 lb stew beef.  remove the beef, cool the pan, then proceed with the sauce recipe, pulling up the brown bits.  add the meat back in to simmer.  HOLY COW that is perfect with this sauce!  I think fresh oregano is the key.  I also used a tiny bit of fresh rosemary and added ground black pepper.  awesome recipe!

Fantastic recipe and very easy to follow. Your friends and family will think you slaved all day in the kitchen making this dish. I also took the leftover sauce and meatballs and used them on rolls for a perfect meatball sandwhich. Thanks.

Good basic recipe. I was afraid 1/2 cup of sugar would make the sauce too sweet, so I started with 1/4 cup, but ended up adding another 1/4 cup of sugar. I added fresh basil just before serving.
Instead of just ground beef in the meatballs, I used a combination of ground beef, mild and hot Italian sausage to give the meatballs more zip. Overall, this is a good recipe, but a bit one dimensional in flavor. I suggest you add your favorite seasonings to this recipe as I did.

A great go-to homemade spaghetti/meatballs.  I love the simplicity of cooking the meatballs directly in the sauce.  A hit at my house.  Followed reviews for using some tomato sauce, more water and less sugar.

This was AMAZING! I've never been able to find a good and easy homeade marinara before, 'til now! I did decrease the amount of sugar due to other's suggestions, but also added half a jar of roasted red peppers that were hanging around in the fridge that needed to be used up. I used my immersion blender to chop it all up in the end after simmering but before I put the meatballs in. This was so good that my hubby and I had nothing to say while eating...we had the most quiet dinner of our lives! Thanks so much for sharing this winner!

I tried this recipe today.  I thought it was great.  The meatballs were perfect.  The sauce was a little too sweet for me, so... I am going to use half the sugar the next time.  Overall, great recipe... I would recommend it and I will be using this recipe in the future.  Thanks:)

I cut back on the sugar, but these were absolutely DELICIOUS! To boot, I don't even eat spaghetii and meatballs, but they were so flavorful, and tender...SMH! Big help, use all fresh herbs if possible. Enjoy!

I made a different sauce recipe, but followed the recipe for the meatballs except I added salt, dried onion and garlic powder.  The meatballs were quite good and pretty flavorful.  My husband ate more spaghetti than he ever has before because he liked them so much.

The meatballs were good, but the sauce was too thick and sweet for my family. If I have to alternate it that much, I might as well find another recipe.

Review is for meatballs only. They are so good I had to be careful not to eat them all b4 dinner ;) I had no bread crumbs so I used oatmeal instead and was short on time so I put all the meat mixture into a hot no stick frying pan and smoothed it to cover the entire bottom of pan. Covered it and cooked till slightly browned and then cut it coarsely and flipped it and fried till cooked through. Crumble into as large or small pieces as you want. Such a TIMESAVER!

Pretty good recipe, but a little too sweet. Definately will be cutting back on the sugar next time and will be adding some Burgandy wine.

The sauce was good but not amazing. I would definitely omit or severely cut back on the sugar. The meatballs were great, I used elk and they came out very deliciously.

I have made this recipe so many times, using the original sauce recipe (with reduced sugar) and using store-bought sauce. Perfect every time! Thanks!

I made this recipe as instructed last night, and it was a smashing success. The sweet style of sauce instantly became one of my favorite things to have ever made. Five stars!

I made it exactly as written and was rather disappointed. Perhaps my personal taste, but I found the tomato paste overpowering and the oregano too strong. I would maybe try again with a lot of alterations.

Good recipe. I agree less sugar is better. Also, it's hard to know how much salt to add to the meatballs without tasting it...I would maybe add a tsp. to a lb. next time.

We loved this sauce, it is wonderful.  I only used a quarter cup of the sugar though, and just browned meat with onion since meatballs seemed like an extra step.  Great recipe!

If you like thick sauce, use all the tomato paste. Otherwise, substituting 2 cans of tomato paste with 1 can tomato sauce is good too. This is a really fantastic recipe! Make sure you account for the time you need to make it.

This is a real keeper!!  Very delicious!!  I made this recipe as is and only added 2 can water (from tomato cans) and a 6" stick of pepperoni and 2 heaping tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese to the sauce  It was just perfect.  This is a great recipe to play with adding or subtracting to your own personal preference.  I made and froze the meatballs last weekend to cut down on prep time and just plopped them in the sauce towards the end.  Used my slow cooker and cooked on high for 2 hours (by accident), then on low for 2 hours.  Thank you so much Jenn and the use of fresh oregano makes all the difference in the world.

This recipe left alot to be desired. Too much sugar, I made the recipe twice and the second time added 1 T of sugar, still too much. Even used the est San Marzano tomatoes and could not get excited about the recipe.

Awesome recipe!  Everyone loved this meal.  I made the recipe as written with the exception of using 1/4 cup of sugar.  I loved the fact that the meatballs cooked in the sauce.  I did use 93/7 ground beef and it was not greasy at all. This will be my go to recipe for spaghetti and meatballs.  I think they would make amazing meatball subs, as well!  Thanks, Jenn!!

Sauce was pretty tasty, although I did cut the tomato paste down to one can.  I like my sauce sweet so I added 1/4 cup of sugar first and then a little more, but not the entire 1/2 cup.  The meatballs were easy to make but I thought mine were a little dry, maybe I added too much bread crumbs.  Good recipe and I would make this again.

well they don't sell 16 oz cans of crushed tomatoes at my grocery store, so i used a 28 oz can and an extra 6 oz can of tomato paste. i also accidentally added all 4 cloves of garlic to the sauce, and i only used 1/4 cup sugar. with those small changes this recipe was delicious!

Tried this recipe Sunday. The only thing I changed was to reduce the sugar content and add ground pork to the ground beef. It was excellent. Even better the next day.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The sauce tasted like tomato paste.  I didn't add the sugar as previous reviewers have suggested.  I also replaced the fresh oregano with dried, but made the rest as listed.  The meatballs were good and I will probably make those again.  I broiled them in the oven before adding them to the sauce.  Needless to say, the sauce was not "out of this world".

I have found my "go to" spaghetti and meatball recipe. My lady friend and her family loved it and I couldn't get enough of it. I only gave this recipe 4 out of 5 stars because I modified it.  I took the advice in Yoshiyum's review and used tomato sauce and tomato paste, more water, and half the sugar.  I like my sauce sweet, and it came out perfect for me...I would think using the amount of sugar called for would be too much.  Wonderful dish! Thanks, Jenn!

I made this - doubled the recipe.  My sons do not like pieces of tomato - so I used Tomato Puree instead of Crushed tomatos.  It was a SMASH!  Their friends loved it - said it was the best they had ever eaten.  I was able to do Spaghetti and Meatballs one day - Meatball subs the next day - and froze the rest so we can have in the near future.  A definite to try at your house!

This recipe was great!  I read a lot of the reviews, and here is what I did.  I didn't add any sugar, I cooked the meatballs a frying pan before putting them in the sauce, I only added one can of tomato paste (I should have only put a half a can), and I should have add either soy or worcestershire sauce to the meatball mixture for extra flavor.

I think it is a great start. I made the mistake of putting in the full 1/2 cup of sugar. I would put in max 2 TBS of sugar unless you like really sweet pasta sauce.  I ended up using 1 8oz. can tomato sauce and 1 can of tomato paste.  I added a cup+ of water to make the sauce the constancy that we like.  I loved that the meatballs were cooked in the sauce and they were delicious.  I will definitely try this recipe again.

WAY too much sugar and oregano.  It tasted like candied pizza sauce.  The meatballs also had too much oregano and were too soft - they needed to be partially fried or broiled.    Next time I'll only use a pinch of sugar and oregano in the sauce, and no oregano in the meatballs.

I don't use any sugar.  I add the tomato paste at the end to thicken sauce as needed.  Tomato paste doesn't need to be cooked.  If you spin the sauce with a hand blender before adding the oregano, it mght not need as much paste.  Use high quality canned stuff (i.e. Bionature, Glen Muir organic, e.g.) for best taste.  Add a few hot pepper flakes for spice.

I added basil (2 TBSP fresh, or 1 TBSP dried) to the meatballs, and  barbequed them indirect heat for about 15 minutes. They were added to an already great sauce, and were outstanding!

The kids ate the meatball,sauce, and bread didn't want to  wait on spaghetti. This is a really tasty recipe,  i couldn't believe it came out this good !! the thing I changed was the sugar to 1/4 cup,hot Italian ground  sausage and let simmer for 3 hours. It is best to let sit overnight

I made this for my god childrens christmas dinner. By the time we all see each other this time of year, everyone is Turkey'd out. Everyone loved it. My husband said it was even better than my moms spaghetti. The only thing I changed was I used a combo package of meat that the butcher had made with beef, pork and sausage, rather than just the ground beef. I also doubled the batch, however ran out of room in my pot, had to use a second pot and then didn't have a big enough pot left over to cook the noodles. I called a friend over to bring a pot and she begged for me to return the clean pot filled with sauce. It was a good compromise and a good sign that the sauce was "out of this world"!

I thought these meatballs were tender and delicious! The sauce came out great too although I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned crushed and I didn't have any tomato paste...besides that I was pretty faithful to the recipe (sans the sugar). Thanks!

I really liked this sauce, loved just dropping in the meatballs, and not having to pan fry first.  Next time though, I will definitely cut way down on the sugar!!! Because It was so sweet, I ended up addinng extra salt, tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce but it was still excellent.  Varied the meatballs a little, used stuffing instead of breadcrumbs, just crushed up, added a little worstershire,  they were really good!

Went over well. Only thing is if you want to use the entire amount of sugar I would add extra salt and maybe some red pepper flakes.

I used this recipe for the meatballs only as my spaghetti sauce is fantastic lol. Followed the recipe except for subbing 1/2 the beef for sweet italian sausage and no parsley. Baked in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes to let some of the grease drain so as to not make the sauce greasy. Excellent will be sure to make this many more times.

I am pretty disappointed.  There is WAY too much sugar in this recipe, which really masks the savory flavors I tend to want in an Italian pasta dish.  Also, besides the sweet, the dish is generally pretty bland.  I probably will not try this again, but if I did, I would bake the meatballs to brown them, and then add them back to the pot.

This recipe was very good, except I would also omit the sugar as some others had suggested, way to sweet. I loved the meatballs as well. I will use this recipe in my other pasta dishes as well. If you don't want meat balls, try ground sausage and beef to the sauce, this was good as well.

This was very tasty but I did make some modifications. I only used about a tablespoon of sugar and 1 can of tomato paste. I stuck it in a crockpot and let it simmer overnight for about 7 hours. It did come out a bit oily so I may try buying leaner meat the next time I make it but the meatballs were SUPER tender and juicy! This smelled so good that it woke me up and I had trouble falling back asleep!

I made these last night, my boyfriend loved them, that's how I knew it was a good recipe ;)  I used another reviewer's recommendations though.  I used store bought sauce.  Made 2" meatballs, baked in a cassarole dish, 350 degrees for 20 mins.  Added meatballs to the sauce, brought to a boil then simmered for 1 hour.  They were tasty and moist!  Plenty of leftovers, since it was just the two of us.  We'll be making meatball subs for dinner tonight!  Can't wait!

After reading the reviews I cut way back on the sugar, only using 2 tbs and using only 1 can of paste. It came out very very good and my 3 year old loved it, especially since she got to help roll the meatballs. I only gave 3 stars because this recipe needed a lot of modifications to make it a 5 star.

Very, very good.  I would recommend cutting back on the amount of sugar to a 1/4 cup.  For those of you with diabetic relatives, it will definitely impact them.  Beyond that it was delicious homemade sauce.  I never knew I could do it!

OMG!!!! I just made this and it’s sooooo good!! I made some changes based on some others suggestions. 1st I cut the sugar way back, only using 1 tbsp instead of 2 and I it was just sweet enough for us!  I upped the crushed tomatoes started with 1 and ended up using 3 cans, perfect for the amount of meatballs I had.  Used 1 can tomatoe paste and added small can tomatoe sauce.  In error I only used 1/2 of the parsley in the meatballs and the other in the sauce but it worked out fine.  Thanks for a great recipe  =)

Great recipe! I left out the water entirely- I didn't seem to need it after using 1 can of paste and 1 can of sauce in addition the to the crushed. (I don't care for watery sauce) I also threw in a little bit of basil, 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4 (some of them were on the small side), some mushrooms and reduced the sugar to 2 tbs as well.

I only gave this three stars because 1) the use of 1/2 cup of sugar is ridiculous. I cut this to 4 servings and used 2tps of Splenda.  More than enough, thanks to previous reviewers. 2) The sauce was excellent but the meatballs were virtually tasteless.  Good texture but tasteless. Followed recipe exactly.   Am keeping the sauce, ditching the  meatballs.  Thank, you, JENNGOETZ. I changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars because the Mrs. strongly disagreed with my critique of the meatballs.  So, maybe it's just one of those days for my taste buds. But, if mama ain't happy, nobody's happy.  Great meatballs !

Made these the other night with my own sauce though (we don't do sweet sauce) I made them exactly as written and hubby raved.  I liked them too.  The parm makes them very filling and with the fresh oregano, they look pretty too!  Will definitely make again. ;')

This is one of my favorite recipies on the site and it's so easy to make.  I also use tureky instead of ground meat. I was a little nervous about the sugar, but it gave the sauce such a unique taste.  I also added cayenne pepper to the sauce and meat for a little kick.

this recipe is so good, if you change it just a little. fist the sugar it calls for is waaay too much, i added half the amount and it was still a little too sweet. next timei will only add about 3-4 tablespoons i think. second i used less tomatoe paste, i only used 2 cans. adn third i added some dried(but fresh would be even better!) Basil. that really made it great! and i also did not have italian seasoned bread crumbs so all i did was take regualer bread crumbs and mix in some italian seasonings. it was really good. i will definatly make this again. it was wonderful!

I picked this recipe for my first time making homemade spaghetti sauce.  Overall it was a success although the sauce was just a little on the sweet side for my taste.  However, the meatballs we out of this world!  Will definitely be making them again and will try the sauce again with a little tweaking.

This recipe is SOOO fabulous!!  We make it all the time and I honestly can't imagine using jarred sauce again.  The meatballs are super tender even when I use 94% lean ground beef which tends to be a bit more dry!  I only use 2 Tbsp of sugar, increase the water to 2 cups and only 1 can tomato paste.  Wonderful each time we make it!

I halved the sugar in this recipe and both my boyfriend and I agreed that it was WAY too sweet. The sweetness overpowered everything else. I would recommend cutting it back to 1 T of sugar and that adding more to taste. By the time the 1/4 cup was in the sauce it was too late.

I only used the meatball part of this recipe, because I already had bottled spaghetti sauce....and WOW, were they fantastic....I still sauted in the sauce for 40 minutes, I've never had such tender meatballs! The ONLY change I made was I used ground turkey as I am a bit of a health nut. They turned out wonderful!! I can't wait to try the sauce too!!

Good recipe, the meatballs were great.  There was far too much sugar in the sauce for our taste, though, so next time I'm cutting it in half, at least.

I've made this several times and it is delicious! I use fresh herbs but pretty much make the recipe exactly as described. I just made a large pot to freeze for when I go on maternity leave and my husband ate most of it in two days! The meatballs are so soft and delicious this way. Thanks for the great recipe!

I prepared this recipe without giving a second thought to it's wonderful rating.  I have to say the meatballs were completely awful with the fresh parsley in them. Even without the parsley they were incredibly bland. The sauce was so sweet, I nearly had to take out my blood sugar tester.  It's a sauce not a dessert for God's sake.  I have to say though that with 2 T of sugar instead of the 8 T called for, and with a little more water and a little less tomato paste, the sauce would be excellent. But as is, I tossed it to the cats.

This was such a hit at my house!  I did change it a little, only added two pinches of brown sugar rather than what the recipe called for.  I also added a little bit of beef bouillon and some additional Italian seasonings.  I made the meatballs really big and cooked them for several hours.  This is my new meatball recipe!

I only made the meatballs from this recipe since I used my own homemade sauce.  ONly change was that I used dried oregano since I didn't have fresh.   Very good - everyone really liked & so easy since you just drop them into the sauce to cook.

I wanted so much more from this recipe then what I got.  The meatballs were very bland, there wasn't a whole lot to them.  Next time I will just stick with the Costco frozen meatballs or just make meat sauce like usual.  The meatballs looked nice and smelt really good, but they seriously just tasted like mounds of hamburger; they weren't spicy or flavorful like restaurant or frozen meatballs.  For the effort they just weren't worth it.

Yummy!! I was hesitant to put the meatballs in the sauce raw but they turned out perfect and tender.  Making again for the 2nd time this week.  Used dried Oregano since that is what I had and only 2 tbs. brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup of sugar.  Also only used 1 can of tomato paste but added 1-2 cans of tomato sauce and reduced the water.  UPDATE: After making this several times I noticed that I always get heartburn after eating it which is unusual since I never get it eating other foods. So, just a word of caution. Next time I make it I will cook the meatballs separate, drain the fat, then add to the sauce.  Maybe that will fix the problem.  UPDATE 2:  I do like to brown the meatballs first if I have time to drain off the fat b/c it seems to make a difference. Also, this turned out very good using Turkey for the meatballs.  I doubled the recipe using 1 package Italian seasoned turkey and 1 package plain turkey.  Using crushed tomatoes in the sauce with a can of seasoned petite diced tomatoes and regular tom sauce instead of just the paste made it a more flavorful sauce for us.

This is a awesome, easy recipe, the only thing I do differently is reduce the amount of sugar and increase the garlic.  Otherwise the sauce is thick and tomato rich, great red lead.  I have used the 2 large cans of crushed tomatos and reduce the paste (used what was in the cabinet)and the sauce was still delicious.  I have doubled the meatball recipe, made them larger and let them cook all day. This is a great quick recipe or all day simmer recipe.

This was my first time making spaghetti from scratch with tomato paste. My family and I truly looked it. I will begin to use this recipe for now on. Instead of using a half cup of sugar, I used an eighth of a cup and it was just fine.

I used this recipe for a spaghetti & meatball dinner for a benefit. I had to make enough for 600 people and it turned out fabulous. Calculating for that many was a bit tricking, even with the calculator but I was able to do a good job and then just cooked by tasting it. We had many compliments on this dinner.

My family loved this meal, though I have to admit I wasn't at all faithful to the recipe. I used what I had in the house spicewise. I did substitute vegetable broth for the water, added mushrooms, and a healthy pinch of cajun seasoning to the sauce. I also cut the sugar back to about a tablespoon. The meatballs were awesome, but I also added garlic and Worcestershire sauce to them. I was short on time, so I cooked the meatballs separately and then added them to the sauce. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow after the flavors have really had some time to sit!

I too just made the meatballs since I was on a time crunch... They we're very good!...  Next time I'll add a little garlic salt maybe, since the meatballs didn't ask for any that I noticed... I was cooking in a hurry... I will make these again!  Thanks Scotdog and Mommyluvs for that recommendation on the Exchange!..

Excellent recipe. The only problem, like with all thick pasta sauces, is that it tends to explode out of the pot when it bubbles. thanks very much.

These were a little bland but they have potential.  I'll probably try them again but I would only use one egg next time because I felt two left them a little mushy.  I would also probably try to add some sausage to the mix next time.  I'm not crazy about sweet sauces so I did away with the white sugar and added two T of brown sugar which left it plenty sweet for me.

This was good. I really liked the meatballs although I used half ground beef and half ground Italian sausage. They freeze great also. For the sauce I did not put all the sugar in that was called for and used Italian seasoning. I had whole canned tomatoes so I ran them through the blender (kids don't like chunks of tomato in their sauce). Thanks for the recipe.

The best Meatball recipe!  My wife made me make them again after just three nights.  Even a picky three year old loved them.  It has a nice sweet flavor.

I added all of the sugar in the recipe and immediately regretted it when I took a taste test.  However, I managed to salvage the pot by tossing out some of the sauce and replacing it with a couple cans of tomatoes from my pantry.  The meatballs cooked up wonderfully, though.  I can't wait to try it again without the excess sugar.

I added red wine to the sauce and cut back on the sugar as others suggested.  It was ok but nothing great.  DH thought it was a little bland.  Meatballs were really good.  Think I will keep trying other recipes.

I only used the meatball portion of this recipe, but I did cook them in sauce as this recipe directs you to.  They were delicious, moist, and tender. I will cook meatballs like this from now on.

I make this recipe frequently - especially for camping.  My husband loves the parsley in the meatballs. The only thing I change is the 1/2 cup of sugar.  I only use a pinch of sugar to taste.  The half cup is way too much.  Sometimes when I am lazy, I open a jar of sauce and heat the meatballs in that.

LOVED IT!!! The sauce was PERFECT, our family likes it sweeter than most and this recipe hit the spot.  At first I was leary about cooking the meatballs in the sauce.  My mother baked everything and I found it to be odd. I followed the recipe exact with no changes or modifications. The meatballs where a little on the softside but the taste made it all worth it.

Meatballs are awesome.  I didn't put enough salt in them or the sauce.  I added 3/4 c red wine as substitute for some of the water.  I cut the sugar back to 2 Tbsps but after eating it I think I would put at least 3 if not 4 in.   Will make again.

Way too much sugar.  The meatballs were perfect.  Would make this again but would use 1 TSP of sugar.  My family did'nt care too much for the sweetness.  Have to be fair cannot rate it more than a 3.

The best meatballs we've ever had!  My hubby is hard to please and he loved them!  I froze 1/2 of it for another dinner next month.  I tweaked store-bought sauce and it still came out great!  Thanks so much Jen for this wonderful recipe.

This was just ok spaghetti and meatballs.  I had to substitute dried basil for fresh and used 3 T. sugar, otherwise followed recipe.  The sauce was very acidic tasting, yet somehow too sweet at the same time.  The meatballs were kind of bland to me.  I wouldn't use this recipe again, I prefer another recipe on this site for spaghetti and meatballs.

As others suggested, I reduced the sugar by half and increased the water by at least one cup.  The sauce was very tasty.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 beef and pork for the meatballs. I will make this again for sure.

This was wonderful! Like other reviewers, I used less sugar. I also added more water (I like my sauces a little on the thinner side). Cooking the meatballs in the sauce made them very tender, and added a lot of flavor to the dish.

As is the recipe is way too sweet.  I cut the sugar in half and it was still a little sweet for our tastes.  However, it was a great base.  Next time I will cut the sugar even more and add a few more spices.  This was an excellent way to cook the meatballs though.  I was wary of adding them raw, but it worked great.  They were tender and flavorful.

I followed the receipt for the meatballs and used my own store-bought spaghetti sauce. I wasn't that impressed with the meatballs themselves (a bit heavy and bland), and probably won't make them again. I gave it 3 stars though, as I didn't make the sauce recipe - and that looks good.

I just made the meatballs and used a popular bottled sauce. It was fantastic. My wife took leftover spaghetti to work for the first time in the 15 years I've known her. Defitnitly cook the meatballs in the sauce for atleast 40 min. I recommend 2 hours.

I haven't tried the sauce in this recipe, because I didn't have all the ingredients.  But the meatballs are amazing.  Looking back at the recipe, I don't know what it is that makes them so amazing.  But whatever it is, they are soooo good.  Now having tried both sauteed AND meatballs cooked directly in the sauce, cooking them in the sauce is my favorite.  They are so much more tender.  Looking forward to trying the sauce next time.

Truly loved this recipe although I only used dried seasonings and only canned tomatoes instead of tomato paste and crushed tomatoes.  It was truly wonderful!

I thought this was pretty good but the sauce was a little sweet for my taste.  I would cut down the sugar next time.  The meatballs were tasty!  Update: I tried this again and cut down on the sugar and added about 1/4 cup of Vodka to the sauce.  Yum!

I didn't make the sauce, just the meatballs and added them to my own sauce.  But the meatballs turned out really good!  Very tasty!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made was adding extra seasonings to the sauce as well as to the the meatball mixture.  Next time, I think I will use about 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 a cup, my husband said he loved the sweetness but I would like it to be a little less sweet.

This was soooo good! I can never find a spaghetti recipe that I like but this is definitely my go-to recipe now! The only thing I changed was that I took other reviewers suggestions and halfed the sugar amount. Top it with parmesean cheese and a good garlic bread and you have the perfect meal!!!

Great recipe. The meatballs came out firm and flavorful and the sauce had a really nice taste. The only change I made to the recipe was I cut the sugar amount in half and it was still plenty sweet. My daughters told me that from now on it's no more Ragu sauce for us, they really loved this sauce.

Very good, I put the sauce in the slow cooker (with a good size spoonful of sun dried tomatoes) and then I put it in the blender (I don't like chunks).  The meatballs I put on a cookie sheet in the over for twenty minutes before adding to the sauce, delish.

Wow! This was great. I finally found my life time spaghetti recipe. I have tried so many and I just love this. My husband even thought it was better then our favorite spaghetti house. I also used a pre made sauce. I use walmarts garlic and onion sauce. I like it better then the expensive ones and its a great base. I added all the spices to the sauce. I did the meatballs exactly. I think next time I will add a little less cheese. It was a little strong to the kids but I loved it. The fresh spices were so nice. I did lightly brown the meatballs. I just could not bring myself to toss them in raw. I served it with buttered noodles and salad and bread. Thank you so much!

This recipe is great! Like others have mentioned, it definitely is too sweet if you add all of the sugar called for in the recipe, so just cut back the sugar and its perfect! I usually add some Italian Seasoning blend to it as well.

I found this recipe about a year ago, and will not make or eat spaghetti and meatballs any other way.  It's perfect.  I usually use 2 big cans of the crushed tomatoes, but only 1 large size can of tomato paste (instead of opening 3 of those little paste cans) and it tastes great.

I only used about 1/3 cup of sugar and it was still too sweet, however this recipe has potential.  I will make again with less sugar.

Please follow others advice and cut the sugar in half!  I didn't and our spaghetti was SUPER sweet although we still loved it.  Overall it is very easy to make and tasted great.  My meatballs weren't as crumbly as others stated, maybe I overcooked them?

I've made this twice now and it is always a huge hit!  The first time it was a little too sweet for my taste, so the second time I only put 1/2 cup of sugar in and it was perfect.  My husband likes mushrooms in spaghetti sauce, so I put some in for him and he loved it.  I had enough left over to freeze for two more meals later on.  Thank you for sharing!

Really good! I didnt make the sauce because I was trying some of my own home grown tomatoes that I stewed and froze late this summer. The meatballs were so easy to make and really had a ton of flavor. I browned them lightly in a little olive oil first and then finished cooking them in the sauce. Very tasty.

Loved this recipe!  Awesome Jenn.  I did review the other posts and reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  With the meat I did 3 parts beef and 1 part Italian sausage.  What a hit!  I've experimented on my own and it's always been a disaster.  Thank you!

I thought the meatballs were fantastic, and the sauce was very good, with the following modifications.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 2T, substituted half of the tomato paste for sauce, and increased the water to about 12 oz.  The sauce is easy to tailor to specific tastes, such as adding your favorite veggies, meats, and/or spices.  The only drawback for me was the amount of grease that surfaced from cooking the meatballs in the sauce.  I spooned off what I could, but next time I will be sure to use very low fat beef, or ground turkey.

My husband made this for dinner, he followed the recipe exactly (except that he used dry herbs instead of fresh) It was extremly sweet but I am certain if you cut the sugar at least by half it would be amazing.  The meatballs were perfect.  We will definatly try this one again but leave out most of the sugar.  He also browned the meatballs in a seperate pan before adding them to the sauce (as recomended by another reviewer) as it seemed a little strange to add completly raw meat to the sauce. Potential to be an all time favorite!

My mistake was not reading the reviews prior to making the sauce.  The sauce is way too sweet to put over pasta. Tastes more like tomato soup than spaghetti sauce.  Added one inch pieces of italian sausage, a red and green pepper and sliced mushrooms to add some body to the sauce but still found that this sauce was missing something. I finally added a large bottle of commercial sauce trying to save this sauce. Will not make this recipe anytime soon.

We just finished this for dinner and it was a favorite, even for my husband who likes to make "Sunday Gravy" the authentic Italian way.
I also reduced the sugar, added a little red wine to the cooked onion and some green pepper.  Mushrooms would be good too.

Only made the meat balls from this recipe. They were a bit dense, but good flavor.

Very good, I used seasar salat bread cubes instead off italian seasoned bread crumbs becouse i didn't have them. But worked out perfectly .. very tasty .. added some italian seasoning and season all to spice it up a little bit. And less suger then recomended.

We made this with two substitutions- we only used 2 tbsp of the sugar and it was still way too sweet, we also used Italian style tomatoes since we didn't have crushed. My entire family couldn't eat it.

Added lots more liquid and only one can tomato paste.  The meatballs were moist, tender and flavorful.  The best recipe I've found so far for spaghetti and meatballs, and I've been through lots of recipes.  My family loved it.

This was very very thick.  I think next time I'll thin it out -- by a lot.  Maybe substitute a can of tomato sauce for one of the cans of paste.

I made the meatballs only and they were good but greasy.   I would say, when you want comfort food it's good, but maybe anytime else maybe not so much.

The meatballs were fantastic, but I'd have to agree the sauce was much too sweet. I will definately make them again, but with half the sugar. We made the leftover meatballs into meatball subs the next day, along with sliced jalapenos and mozzerella, and they were delicious! Thanks for the recipe :)

Delicious! Husband said, "This is the best spaghetti you have ever made."  Definitely cut the sugar in half (at least).  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and I got the kind that is already seasoned with Italian herbs and spices.  That added a lot of depth to the sauce.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for the meatballs. I used my own sauce (as many remarked that the sauce was too sweet)and just followed the directions for the meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely fabulous. Moist & flavorful and extremely easy to incorporate into your own recipe. I will be making these meatballs for years to come! Thanks!

I made this recipe even better by using 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground round. I couldn't find fresh oregano but the ground worked just fine! This sweet sauce was a perfect combination with the tender meatballs.

Loved it!  I didn't add the 1/2 cup of sugar,(per other cooks' reviews) but it was still excellent.  The meatballs were fabulous.  I'll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe. With most spaghetti sauce recipes I find, I always adjust them when looking at the ingredients. The secret to a fantastic spaghetti sauce is to use butter instead of olive oil. It makes a much richer tasting sauce. In addition, a couple of splashes of Worcestershire makes a very hearty tasting sauce too. I definitely cut down the sugar to 2 tbsp, and the tomato paste to 1-2 cans, depending on how thick I'm wanting it to be. Otherwise, this is a excellent recipe!

This has become the staple sauce in my house. Both my husband and I are Italian and demannd a lot from our Italian food! I added sausage to the sauce and it was great. Although we LOVE sweet sauce, I will cut the sugar in half next time.

I used premade meatballs so that made the recipe easier, I'm sure it also changed the taste.  We didn't have any paste so I used two cans of tomato sauce, one blended with cornstarch to try to thicken it up.  Also used very little, maybe an 8th of a cup of sugar.  Oh, and I sautee'd the garlic and a can of mushrooms (no onions, allergic) before putting it into my slow cooker and putting the other ingredients on top...  Is it still the same recipe?  LOL  No other changes.  Loved this, I will definently be making this again.

i live in the uk, which i use to live as a child in seattle, and u just cannot get the all american spag and meatballs in the uk, but i do have to say this receipe really brings back memories!!!!!

the meatballs stayed together, the sauce was absolute dream, the only thing - which was not down to the receipe, is i put too much sugar which i think was the converstion to metric - i wouldnt add or less any ingredients just maybe tweek the amounts.. 5******

Bottom of the line with this one is to use your own preferred sauce recipe - everyone has a different idea of what is good.  The meatballs are great and simple.  Cooking them in the same pot as your sauce also saves on clean up!  Easy, tasty, moist, I'll give it 5 stars.

I thought this was fantastic.  I eliminated the white sugar and used 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  Instead of ground beef, I used vegetarian 'ground round', and it was fantastic.  Other than those two changes, I followed the recipe as is, and it was delicious, my whole family enjoyed it!
