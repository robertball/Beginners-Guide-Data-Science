I had two problems with this recipe.  First, covering the meat after 15 minutes resulted in a topping that was soggy, mushy and unappealing.  Second, the total baking time (1-1/4 hour) resulted in the tenderloin being "VERY well done."  I would recommend:  Checking the temp after 45 total minutes and removing the cover at that time.  Otherwise, I used baby portobello mushrooms and found this to be very tasty.

This recipe was great.  I am a culinary school student and it was nice to finally have a recipe that is quick AND good.  The only bad thing I found with this recipe is that there didnt seem to be enough stuffing....I had to double the ingredients for the stuffing in order to have enough to stuff the tenderloin I purchased.  But the flavor was great!....Over all, a great recipe!

This was very tasty but I overcooked the meat. I'll make again and cook in less time.

Nice flavor but doubt I will make this ever again because there are better recipes. Used button and portabello mushrooms, ready cooked bacon as well as pancetta. Upped the bacon and pancetta a lot from the recipe (pancetta was not in the original recipe, I just like it). I don't really care for the "bread crumb" taste this recipe had and think it would be better to leave out all of the breadcrumbs or reduce it significantly.

Yum, yum, yum!! This was fantastic!!! My brother said it was the best thing I've ever cooked! As suggested, I doubled the stuffing, and tied it with butcher's twine rather than using toothpicks. The crust was a nice addition, not too thick, and the stuffing and meat were just wonderful together. I will definitely make this again!

Yum, yum and yum!  I have made this roast three times now, and is delicous every time!  I have always used cremini and shitake mushrooms instead of mushrooms to give it more flavor.  I also buy really good bacon from the meat department.  I would highly recommend using a meat thermometer for this and any other meat dish - that way its perfectly cooked every time!

This was OK, but nothing flash, the cooking time was too long and it was slightly overcooked.
