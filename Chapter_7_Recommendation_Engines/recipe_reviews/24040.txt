the "drink mix" ingredient needs to be worded way differently. Instead of drink mix, it should say "1/2 cup premade sugar-free lemon flavored drink mix" or something to clearly say you should be using 1/2 cup of the drink mix already made. I had to make this recipe twice, because the first time, I used 1/2c drink mix in the powder form.. which ironically tasted better than the 2nd attempt when I used the made drink mix (which made it taste bland.)
