Friends loved this when I made it camping! Only thing is that I made them up at home, and stuck them in the cooler so they were ready to pop in the coals after a long day fishing, and used multiple sheets of foil for each one so they didnt leak. Made up a batch of campfire biscuits and the oohs and ahhs kept coming. Thanks for the great recipe Peter!

So easy to make and tastes great!  I added frozen corn and peas as well and it turned out fantastic!  The  best part is...no dishes!

I love the concept. I even added mushrooms and additional spices as well. But I also found the meal to taste bland. And there was quite a bit of excess liquid, possibly from the mushrooms. And I didn't feel the need to add the tablespoon of water. I was suprised, based on the onions, garlic, and variety of spices I used, how flavorless it tasted. Also, the meat was cooked perfectly but the potatoes and carrots could've used more time - about 10-15 minutes. I'm curious if anyone else ran into the same problem(s).

This was an easy after-work recipe.  Very tasty.  We only missed the gravy.  Would have to make that on the side next time, otherwise really great.

I made seven of these luscious meals for supper. I used London Broil in four and Chicken Leg Quarters in the rest. Baked in convection oven for one hour fifteen minutes on 375 degrees F. The meat wasnâ€™t quite done on the two we had tonight, so I continued to cook the others for another half-hour to forty-five minutes. They all turned out super tasty!

Just made this for the first time and my husband and I loved it!
It's incredibly easy and tastes great.  I added a little more garlic (minced) to the recipe, because we both love garlic.  I mixed the butter (melted) with the water and garlic and then poured it over the meat and veggies.  Made it in the oven, and the veggies turned out perfect, the meat was a tad overdone, but still good.  I'm going to cut the time down to maybe 45-50 minutes next time and see how that goes.

I'm also thinking of trying individual "dishes" for ease of eating later.  This is really perfect for a No-Dish-Minimal-Cleanup meal.  And being able to eat out of your own personal tin foil bowl sounds like a great idea to me!  

Will definitely be making this again!

Really liked this, but found that it is better on the camp stove than on the fire.  Too easy to overcook.

The meat was a little over cooked but the overall dish was delicious. I added some herbs and spices on top just before the packets went into the oven which gave the dish some added flavor.

This was just ok. It only took about 15 minutes to cook (burn) in my campfire. I guess it was too hot.
