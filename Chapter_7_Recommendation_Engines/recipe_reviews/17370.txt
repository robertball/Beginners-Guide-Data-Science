Moist, delicious, deep dark chocolate cake that's so easy, so quick to whip together I thought surely I must have forgotten something!  No changes and no criticisms, so this is the only commentary this recipe needs.  I made half a recipe in an 8" round pan and frosted it with "Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting," also from this site. Definitely pleased.  Definitely worth repeating.

The cake came out tasting bland. I made another one because it was so simple, this time adding 3/4 tsp.  of salt. Add a whole tsp. if you like.The cake came out just right.

I've made this cake over and over and we love it.  The key is to add the hot coffee last (I use instant).  The batter seems really runny but it comes out great.  I use a basic chocolate icing and serve with ice cream.  Yummy!

You can't go wrong when you have a really easy recipe with great results.  I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely happy with it - no extra salt was required.  I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" recipe from this site along with a raspberry filling between layers and on top.  Everyone commented on how moist the cake was.  I thought I would need less time due to putting it in rounds - but it was in for 32 minutes.  This is a great recipe.  I am trying to figure out the next time I can make it!

Absolutely perfect! One of the best chocolate cake recipes I have tried. Moist but still light and not overly dense. Super chocolate flavor. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa for the first time in this recipe and loved the results. We had a smaller group for dinner and needed a smaller dessert so I halved the recipe (scaled down to 12 servings) and baked in one 8" round. Everyone loved it and I will use this recipe often. Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake to take to our block party this evening, and it was a hit! I did add a little something to it, only because I made a bundt cake...this cake is awesome just as is. I added a cream cheese and chocolate chip filling to the center of the bundt cake. People kept commenting on how moist this cake was. I drizzled the cake with milk chocolate and white chocolate. Made a beautiful cake! Thanks for sharing.

This is probably the best scratch cake I have ever made.  Usually the scratch ones end up very dense and heavy.  This one is light and fluffy and I used a butter and powdered sugar frosting which was very delicious.  I baked it for 30 minutes which was perfect.  Don't worry if the batter seems a little runny.....that's fine!

This cake was extremely MOIST and very good! Everyone loved it. I thought for taste it was a 4 out of 5. It was a simple, light taste. But my Family LOVED it!!!!! couldn't stop eating them (cupcakes). Now my sister has asked me to make 100 of them for my nieces Birthday Party (2 years old) Can't wait! If anyone says this is dry, you did something wrong, because that's one thing that it's not! Also, by mistake I added the coffee before mixing (not as a last step as it says) and it still came out perfect. Yes, it looks a little watery, but bakes beautifully! UPDATE: So I made these  for the party (24 chocolate and then another recipe), these were even better this time. I don't know if ut was because I followed the recipe 100%, put coffee in last or the coffee I used or what, but wow so delicious! Try this recipe! It is so good!

I dare not make anything different for my hubby. Best chocolate cake ever. Very moist and don't let the thinnest of the batter fool you. That makes it the best. I like to use just a vanilla frosting on it as that is what DH likes. Its hard not to eat this if you are dieting. The best ever.

Simply wonderful!  Easy to make I just threw everything in the electric mixer.  I followed the directions as written and got rave reviews from everyone.  I made frosting to go on top (powdered sugar, cocoa, butter, vanilla).  Will make again.  Thanks!

The cake turned out like a stone... It is really dense... and not very flavorful at all...  Skip this one.

Great recipe! My friend asked me if I make my own cocoa, as in pick the cocoa pods and dry them and grind them...you get the point! To those who found this bland, remember that your chocolate cake is only as good as your chocolate is. So if you're using low quality powder cocoa your cake'll most likely be bland.

Baking made easy!!! Most times I find recipes whose ingredients I can't find locally or I don't have some equipment. This recipe is GREAT. The ingredients are basic, the mixing can be done by hand and it turns out really perfect. As said before, add the hot coffee last and u could add a tsp of cinnamon.

I have made this several times now since my original search for a yummy but simple recipe to bake. I can't tell you the compliments I get when I bring this to an event. I usually do a cup of a flavored coffee from the Keurig and bake in two nine inch layer pans for about thirty two minutes as others had suggested. It comes out beautifully and is very moist and flavorful. I have used regular Hershey's as well as the special dark cocoa. Sometimes, I use a frosting recipe from the Hershey site but you can really do whatever suits you and even vary what's in the middle such as using a jam filling. If you're a novice cake baker such as myself or a seasoned pro, you can't go wrong with this recipe, always a winner!

Delicious! Not too sweet, and very moist. Also, MUCH better after a day or two .. and especially cold! On the day I made and frosted it, it was kind of bland, and I would have given it about 3 1/2 stars, but the next day ... WOW! Great! So be patient. It keeps very well, and benefits from "ripening."  (p.s. I used the Special Buttercream Frosting from this site ... great combo!)

This is a great cake really ! I didn't have a right proportions pan deep enough, so i baked it in a round pan. The cake got so so big and i had to bake it for an hour because the dish was too deep. Anyway, it didn't get overbaked or anything, but it lasted a lot longer. Have that in mind when picking a dish to bake it in. More shallow is easier :)

Good, not great. I have a couple other recipes that defintely beat this one out, in terms of taste and moistness and texture. I loved how quickly this one came together though. Very easy!

I've made this several times, changing several ingredients and it's spectacular every time.  Once I was out of oil so I used mayo.  PERFECT!  Again I was asked for a lower-fat version so I used 1/4 of the oil, a 1/2 cup of applesauce and a sploosh of sour cream.  Again lovely.  You really can't mess this one up!

I haven't purchased a box of cake mix in YEARS!!! This is the recipe I have made for my kids' birthdays every year and they LOVE IT!!  I've sometimes used regular cocoa, dark cocoa, and a mix of both... It always comes out great!  I find this recipe just as easy as a box mix and I almost always have every ingredient on hand at any given day.  So anything can be celebrated with cake!  Today is the last Wednesday of the month..let's have cake!

Made this for my boyfriend's 18th...Came out perfect!
I subsituted butter for the oil (120 grams did the trick), I added half a teaspoon of salt, an extra teaspoon of vanilla, an extra teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/4cup chocolate shavings.
Covered it in my homemade frosting and chocolate-dipped strawberries.
All the guests raved about it - I have none left because everyone took extras home!!

Wonderfully rich tasting. I turned this recipe into cup cakes by baking for less time. I added semi-sweet chocolate morsels to each cup cake after pouring the batter into the cups. Adds a very nice touch without icing. Wonderful!

just baked it yesterday for a friend on her birthday. Instead of baking it in a 13x9 pan i used the 12x8 inch pan coz i want it to bake a little bit higher. It turned out great! I used my favorite chocolate fudge icing (will share it to you guys next time...promise!)and i topped it with white and bittersweet chocolate shavings and some sprinkles. Hmmmmmm... so yummy and so attractive. My husband is so proud of me :)

I really liked the texture of this cake it was almost like a mud cake. I turned this into a dairy free cake by using coconut milk instead of normal milk. I did find that it was lacking in flavor - I miss the butter flavor that is in my standard recipe, or some salt would've helped.

I made this for my wife at the end of lent (she gave up pastries), and she loved it, as did everyone else at our family gathering. Despite several dessert choices, not a scrap of my cake was left when dinner was over. Absolutely delicious. Possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever had, and so easy to make. Like other reviewers, the thinness of the batter made me nervous, but it cooked up beautifully. The only change I made was following the suggestion of adding 1.5 tsp of salt. I iced it with the "chocolate butter-creme frosting" recipe from this site, and it was also delicious.

I made this for my 9 and 12 year-old sons.  They loved it.  Easy to make and very moist.  I subsituted natural applesauce for the oil and it came out great.  I will never use a box cake mix again.

Pretty good, I kind of screwed it up (not adding enough sugar) but that was my fault. Even so, it was pretty good because the frosting was WAY too sweet so it worked out! It was very moist and fluffy! I added a little salt b/c of a review, but I really wish I didn't I don't think you need it, especially if you add less sugar and a good strong espresso coffee. I used 2, 8 inch rounds and 25 minutes was the perfect time!

I served this cake at my birthday... everyone loved it! Drizzled with marsala, filled with strawberry jam and topped with fresh cream... mmm mmm! It was easy to whip up, but it took 3 times as long as instructed to be baked. That was disappointing.

I made this cake for a co-workers birthday and got rave reviews. Everyone commented on how moist it was. In fact, 4 people asked if I would share the recipe with them! I topped with peanut butter frosting because sometimes a cake just needs to be fun, but I think it would work with chocolate or vanilla as well.

Nothing great..i think salt would have upped the flavour factor that was sorely lacking. My mother wasn't even sure what flavour it was! Sorry, but this did not work for me. But it was SO easy to put together so it gets points for that :)

Thanks sooo much for this excellent recipe.  I made some minor changes. I used half whole wheat and half white wheat flour. I added 1/2 cup of mint syrup with the hot coffee and decreased the sugar by 1 cup.  That made the flavor mint chocolate but not overly sugary:) I only baked it for 25 minutes and it came out PERFECTLY!!!!  I will be making this cake again and again for sure!  Oh,also it rose quite a bit more than I expected from the runny mix that was first poured in.  Five stars all the way!

This cake was easy to make and absolutely delicious. I was expecting to taste the coffee more but it was perfectly chocolately and delectable! My aunt loved it for her birthday.  Note: It is scary when you pore it in and its so watery but it comes out so moist and yummy so don't worry!

This is a good chocolate cake and low fat.  It surprised all that tried it when they found out that nutritional info.  I even subsituted the oil for baby prune puree and used 1 full egg and 1 egg white only.  Turned out very good and so moist.  Was even better for you too, yummy.

I usually make Sandy's Chocolate Cake, which you can find on this website.  However, I didn't have all the ingredients so I looked for one I could make with what I had on hand.  I made this as is except for adding a little salt.  It was VERY moist, which was terrific, but really lacked in chocolate flavor.

I have made this recipe twice and it is always a hit! People love how moist it is and when I tell them there's coffee in it, they like it even more.
Will definitely keep making it.

This cake is absolutely delicious! This was my very first attempt at chocolate cake from scratch, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Only change I made was adding 1/8 tsp salt, as most recipes I've seen for chocolate cake (or chocolate anything) calls for salt. I loved the idea of using coffee in place of water. Easy & quick prep, using ingredients most already have on hand. My family has put me in charge of all birthday cakes and the likes ;). Fantastic recipe, will definitely be making again!

This cake is amazing! I've made it about 6 times and every time I have had terrific feedback.  I've passed the recipe on each time too. It's super easy to make, I've done cupcakes, a sheet cake and a sandwich and all have turned out perfectly.  Tastes good with vanilla butter cream icing or (my personal favourite) a mix of cream cheese and Nutella!

This is a good starter recipe for me.  I did change the vegetable oil to applesauce and I think next time instead of the coffee I am going to try some hot chocolate or something.  I can really taste the coffee in my cake and as I am not a coffee drinker this is not so desirable, however, once you put cream cheese icing on top it really mellows out the coffee taste.  Just want it to have more of a chocolate kick.  Again though awesome starter recipe for a scratch chocolate cake, nice and fluffy. :)

Very easy recipe. Im always looking for cakes that use oil instead of butter as I dont always have it. The batter looks so runny you think its not going to work but it did. It would make a lovely Black forest cake.

This chocolate cake was very delicious. When it came to deciding which coffee to put in, I chose Starbucks Pike’s Place, because I always drink it every morning before I go to work. It came out great, except my kid was bouncing off the walls. I don’t recommend this cake for people with children. ESPECIALLY not at night, but other than that I give it 5 stars.

I did not like the texture of this cake.  Way too moist and kind of gummy.  I was worried when I added the hot coffee to the batter it made the batter very  thin. I used a bundt pan and it took a lot longer to bake than directions say.  I believe it took about 50 minutes.  I'm glad I added a tsp of salt because it would have been even more bland.  I did not love the flavor.  That may have had to do in part  with the Trader Joes cocoa powder I used.  I will not make it again.  I gave it an extra star for two reasons 1) Everyone else in the family like it and ate it up.  2) It  wasn't a complete failure - It cooked through and came clean out of the pan.   :/    *Additionally I used Allrecipies -
 "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" To frost it and It was easy but not chocolatey enough for me even though I added 50% more (Nestle) chocolate chips then called for.

I did not change a thing and did not use my mixer.  It was absolutely delicious.  I made a peanut butter    Icing and whipped up some heavy cream.  I will use this for all my chocolate loving friends.

Perfectly moist cake!  No need to ever buy a cake box again!  Made a nice whipped cream icing to go with it and sprinkled cocoa powder on top.  My husband was more than happy to receive it for his birthday.  Will make it once again!

Very good.  Disappeared almost instantly.  Moist.  Made into cupcakes and didnt even need icing!  Coffee gave nice, rich taste, but without being coffee-tasting.

My family absolutely loves this cake!!! In fact, I have had to write it down for many people. I use the Texas chocolate frosting recipe but add some cinnamon and a bit of coffee. Love this with homemade vanilla ice cream!! Must try!! :)

Fantastic! I kept mine non-dairy and used unflavored rice milk in place of regular milk, and it worked out perfectly. So moist. I brought this to a potluck and the reviews were outstanding. Just decorated with powdered sugar - this doesn't need anything else. 
Do use a dash of salt.

Yup, needs salt. Also, I put a squirt of dark chocolate Hershey's syrup. Tasted wonderful. Very light and airy. Very good. I made cupcakes. Surprisingly, they didn't rise very much, which worked out very well for my decorations/frosting. They were flat on the top. I got 30 cupcakes out of this recipe.

I have been using this recipe for years.  It never disappoints.  I usually use brewed coffee with a little instant coffee granules disolved in it.  (I brew my coffee a lot weaker than Starbucks and the recipe works best with a strong robust coffee).  It's great with any frosting.  The batter is very runny and it makes you think you made a mistake, but it will turn out moist and tasty.  Makes great cupcakes.

My mom began using this recipe in the 1940s and I still use it.  She always put the cocoa in the hot water/butter and stirred well.  She used hot coffee as the liquid in the frosting.  This gave the cake fudgy flavor and delicious frosting.

Very moist! I made two 9-inch rounds and I think I ended up with too much batter because both cakes fell in the middle. However, the result was delicious and easy to make. I will try this again!

WOW!!  This was INCREDIBLE! I made one substitution using flax seed for eggs as I had none. I see some reviews saying it was dry - I cannot imagine that - mine was ridiculously moist! I topped it with a peanut butter frosting.  YUM.

Wonderfully moist cake! Very easy to make as well. We added a pinch of chili powder, just to spice it up a bit, and made from scratch butter icing. The heat from the chili and the sweetness of the icing was awesome! Will make again.

This is easy to make with items on hand. It has a great texture, is moist and tasted better the second day. That said, I found the flavor flat. As a vehicle for homemade frosting the cake was "fine," but alone it tasted pretty bland. I think the addition of some salt would really help it along. Also, is it possible that vinegar is a missing ingredient here. Most baking soda cakes have a bit of vinegar and THAT may be what's missing.

Needs salt. Added a half tsp and made the best cupcakes ever. They freeze great - ready after 20 seconds (or less) in the microwave. Used leftover cold coffee and mixed all wet and all dry seperately before mixing together.  Easier for two kids or parent and kid to work on together. Thanks.  Great recipe.

OMG this cake is fabulous. I love chocolate. I mean love, love, love chocolate.  I followed the recipe, in addition I added a box of instant chocolate pudding and a full cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  The cake was very sweet, moist and absolutely delicious.  I will for sure make this again and again and again. If you love chocolate, you will find this cake irrisitable.

So my family and I tried this last night. It was wonderful. Then the men working on my house today ate like half of it. It's a delicious cake. I will be making it again...especially when I want people to think I can bake ;)

This was delicious, I was really dubious because of the coffee as I hate coffee, but it has such a chocolatey flavour that I couldn't taste the coffee.  I madei t for my son's birthday party as a mudslide cake with bugs on it, and it was a hit!  Definately will make this again.

This cake is pretty good for a homemade cake. I used half all-purpose flour and half cake flour, which gave it a finer texture.  My son liked the cake better than the frosting, but I liked them together a lot.

The consistencies was shocking at first and I thought it will be in the chute! Seriously. But I continued with the baking process anyway and WOW! No regrets. Wonderful and will be doing again definitely. Agree though that a little salt is needed. Thanks Nanci

Very black, rich and moist cake ! My boyfriend loves it! It's easy to make too.Just mix everything and stir.As simple as that. But it's not really a sweet tasting cake, next time i'll add a
bit more sweetness to it. I highly recommend this recipie to all of you ! Very good quality cake. You dont even need a glaze for this cake.

Totally amazing recipe! I put less sugar (1 cup and a bit), mixed everything with a hand mixer adding ingredients (eggs, then sugar, oil and so on... with coffee last), baked for 25 min, drizzled with chocolate chip/butter glaze. So moist! Will make it again!

This cake was wonderful!  I was a little nervous going into the baking, because this was only my second time making a cake from scratch, but it turns out there was nothing to worry about!  I highly recommend using this recipe.  The cake turned out nice and moist and wasn’t overly sweet!  My family loved it!

The label on a container of Hershey's cocoa powder that I bought yesterday has a startlingly similar recipe on it. It's called "Hershey's 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake." It uses slightly less flour (1¾ cups instead of 2 cups), slightly more baking powder (1½ tsp.), slightly less baking soda (1½ tsp.), 2 tsp. of vanilla extract instead of 1, and it adds 1 tsp. of salt. (Many reviewers here have suggested adding salt.) It also calls for a cup of boiling water rather than hot coffee. The other ingredients match. For the 9x13 version, it suggests a baking time of 35 to 40 minutes. The label also includes a frosting recipe for the cake. (Both recipes are also on their website, with additional instructions for Bundt, 3-layer and cupcake versions.) I suggest dusting the greased pan with cocoa powder instead of flour.

I felt it was just a little dry.  Was  a little hard to stir before the coffee was added  Was very crumbly.  Maybe a little more oil or another egg?   The next day it was better - who knows!  Great taste!

This is the chocolate layer of my Neapolitan layer cake and it takes the "cake".   I made it exactly as written.  It has a wonderful dark chocolate flavour without being overly sweet.  It's moist and rich and delicious. A chocolate lover's dream.   A real  keeper.

I love the flavor and texture. But getting it out of the pan was not pretty. I used two 8 inch round pans, well-greased and floured. The cake did not release from the pans as expected and I suspect that the hot coffee heated the batter so that it melted and fused with the coating. It came out in pieces that I put back in place hoping it cools into a semi-cohesive cake. I am making a two layer cake with icing so it won't show, but be aware that this can happen. Maybe it's time for silicon pans, or use parchment paper on the bottom next time. Yum!

Amazing!! I've made this a few times. Even friends who don't prefer chocolate have raved that it was the best cake they've had. I follow the recipe exactly. The proportions do make a bit more batter than you might need. The key is, whatever pan you use, dont fill it more than halfway full or it may overflow. I make it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe. I've also used this recipe for cupcakes. In that case, they bake in about 20 minutes. I won't use any other chocolate cake recipe again.

I made the cake with absolutely no changes. I agree with the cake being bland. It definitely needs some salt. Also, mine sunk in the middle so it wasn't very pretty.  The batter was really runny so expect that. I'm not sure I'm going to make this again, but if I do salt will be added and I think I would add a little more flour to thicken it up a bit.

This cake is moist  and light but it desperately need some kind of chokalte frosting to lift up the flavors. My cake was very good but it lacked depth. As is it would be a casual cake for casual occasions. With chokalate frosting it will impress others.

I think the baking pan needs to be a little bigger, because I baked it for 25 mins and it was all liquid inside still. So baked it for 20 more mins and the crust burned. But the cake was still very good. I would recommend the salt and adding more cocoa powder. It's a good recipe

The cake is DELICIOUS!! I followed the directions and it came out super watery so I added 1/4 cup flour and cooked for 20 minutes more. Thankfully I didn’t mess it up! Used a recipe for the frosting called “chocolate frosting l” deeeeelicious as well!

This a a great recipe for a perfect no-frills, rich chocolate cake. I especially like that it isn’t overly sweet. I baked mine in a bundt pan. If you do that be sure to bakevitan extra 18 minutes. This cake is great without frosting, or with.

I've made this recipe at least fifty times. I've done 9x13, 9 inch round and cupcakes. There is no comparison. Make sure you add the coffee last after all ingredients have been mixed. I always use fresh extra strong hot coffee. The only change I made is I use 1/2 cup coca powder and 1/4 cup special dark. But only because it's a personal preference. I would give this a thousand stars.

I added in 3/4 tsp salt but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was super easy, made very few dishes and is exceptionally moist and rich. I did put it in the freezer for a few minutes after removing it from the oven to keep it from overbaking and moved it to the refrigerator after it had cooled some. This is going to be my go to chocolate cake recipe.

Hey not bad. Super moist cake, lots of flavor, and overall a good fix for a sweet tooth. Only complaint, and I'm far from a well educated baker, but I couldn't taste the coffee at all. But maybe it's there for another reason I don't know of which is very likely. ¯\_(?)_/¯

I've made this cake three times now and it is consistently delicious and moist. This last time I mixed in 6oz of frozen semi-sweet chocolate chips after all the other ingredients had been properly blended. When served hot out of the oven the chips are gooey patches of chocolatey goodness. When the cake is completely cooled- overnight or in the refrigerator- the chips will resolidify. My husband loves the texture of the hardened chips inside each bite. I love this recipe because it is as easy as making a box cake and I realistically have all the ingredients on hand at any time. Thank you for sharing.

Made one using regular coffee and one using decaf.  Both turned out lovely.  I put chocolate chips into the decaf cake and powdered it with confectioner's sugar so my twin daughters would know which one was which.  Actually loved the one with the chocolate chips...delicious!  This recipe is a keeper!

Really great cake- one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had! However I'm not sure why the recipe does not call for salt. I added one teaspoon of salt- I recommend you do so as well.

Added a few dashes of salt for good luck. Came out fluffy and moist. This cake would be delicious with a rich chocolate glaze drizzled over it. Will make again.

I loved making this! Super simple and moist, my family thinks it had an after taste and I think it was because of the strong coffee I used. Just learning to bake so will try again without this coffee, will use another less strong coffee, and see how it turns out. There is no way this cake can be dry either and that says a lot coming from a beginning baker like myself, followed directions exactly.  I love it myself though and used just a regular DH frosting but will make my own like most of the reviewers. Thanks so much for this easy recipe!

Delicious!  Light, not too dense - we made cupcakes and baked them for 22 minutes.  20-21 might have been enough.  Great recipe.  Made 27 cupcakes.

This is a great, simple fast cake!  It does need 1/2 tsp of salt in dry ingredients to make it perfect.    I used an equally simple frosting for  it... 1/2 cup warmed up sweetened condensed milk  (dulce de leche) drizzle it while warm on top and then sprinkle with some coarse Kosher salt.  Sweet with that little salt bite, takes this cake to a new level.

Very good cake. Made it with gluten free flour and it came out quite nicely. Chocolate flavor could be a bit stronger and fuller.

This is a great recipe! I'm shocked, honestly. My cakes turn out terrible lol and this was my first try from scratch. Only real change worth mentioning is I adapted to make cup cakes, rather than one large cake, as a test run. I'll be making this for sure this weekend for hubby's bday BBQ! Thanks so much for sharing. (frosted with the chocolate cheese frosting recipe off this site, another 5 stars!)

Moist, delicious, dark chocolate bliss. Frosted with dark chocolate buttercream.  Adjusted serving size from 24  to 18. This was perfect for a glass 11 X 7-1/2" pan. This will be a "go to"  recipe for us. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  One thing that I will warn is to not try it with straight splenda instead of sugar.  I did that the other day and it was horrible.  It not only tasted bad but it also did not rise.  With sugar though it is a perfect chocolate cake.  I have made it in bunt and layer cake and love it all around.

This cake doesn't call for any salt, and is a little bland. Very easy and fluffy though! Next time I'll add some salt like others have suggested.

CRAZY GOOD CHOC. CAKE!! This cake is perfect, NO SALT needed. I do not drink "strong" coffee and had some instant in the pantry. I mixed 2 TBLSP of instant with my regular, then added to cake batter. OMG!! So good.

The only reason I give only 4 stars and not 5 is because I do agree that it can be on the bland side. But for me it works out perfect because I hate frosting so I make a white chocolate glaze for this cake instead. White chocolate is very sweet so it works out awesome they balance each other out amazingly. I poke holes in my cake so the glaze seeps in ?? . Its so good I do my best to give most of it away to avoid eating the whole thing myself lol

I made it and it was great, but I did make some modifications. I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 heaping tsp of espresso powder (because I just happen to have) and also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white, which still left a great taste and consistency.  Good basic recipe. Thanks.
(I'd give it 5 but didn't make it exactly as written as I read the reviews that said it needed a little more flavor.)

I have been searching for the best chocolate birthday cake recipe for years and I FINALLY FOUND IT! It was moist and delicious - perfect! I used Droste's Dutch Cocoa and added 1/2 tsp salt per another reviewer. I wanted a round bday cake so I used two 8-inch pans and cooked for about 25 min. When greasing and flouring pans for a chocolate cake -use cocoa powder in place of the flour. That way you don't get any white edges. I frosted the cake with a double batch of the chocolate icing recipe from the site. Turned out great!

Consistency and color are perfect. Very fluffy. But when it came out of tasty, I feel confused. It's so blend. You feel like is missing something. As others reviews mentioned its boring. Maybe the key is to add a very sweet topping. Those reviews that loved the cake added toppings. Second time I made and still coming out blend.

Couldn't imagine this tasting bland with chocolate and coffee in it, but it kinda does. Maybe it's one of those cakes that needs to sit overnight for flavors to develop? Or needs some salt? Or stronger coffee? Anyway, it was super easy! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to mix with a mixer like most cakes, so after stirring, I mixed it on med for about 30 seconds to incorporate some air. Texture was fine, just needs some flavor oomph!

This has always been a wonderful cake and I love the coffee addition.  This recipe has me adding coffee where other recipes ask for water.  It offers a much richer taste, enhancing the chocolate.

EXACTLY what I was looking for. Cut the recipe in half, added a little less than a half teaspoon salt and used raw chocolate (cacao) powder. DELICIOUS!!

I have never rated a recipe before, but I had to tell what I did to make a good chocolate cake even better. Due to health issues, I watch my fat and sugar religiously, but I never found a good chocolate cake recipe that fit my healthy lifestyle. When I read this recipe, I knew I could make it delicious and healthy. I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil, I used 1/2 cup of egg beaters instead of the eggs,I used 2 cups of Slenda instead of sugar, I used 1 cup plus 2 Tbls. cake flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, decaff. coffee and finally either skim milk or evaporated skim milk. Start checking for doneness at 15 minutes. It seems to get done quicker than most cakes. Thanks for the foundation for a great healthy cake! Diane Conley

I tried making these as mini-bundts but they stuck and were ruined.  (But tasted great - I probably needed more spray or maybe a dusting of cocoa powder.)  The 6 mini-bundts only used about 1/3 of the batter so I made 24 cupcakes with the rest.  They were PERFECT and delicious!  I baked in my convection toaster over at 350 for 15 minutes. They came out of the liners perfectly and were moist and delicious!  They don't even need frosting, they are so good!  I am guessing this would make about 36 cupcakes.

Delicious, light, and moist cake. The batter was very runny, but it turned out just fine. Don't overbake it! When we pulled it out, the toothpick that was inserted came out perfectly clean, but the cake still felt a little sticky. Trust the toothpick! Let it cool before you frost it, since it's a lighter cake and will crumble if you don't wait. I loved this recipe and am sure to keep it in our family! (Also, don't eat this before bed time. I got so energized when I ate it. I think because of all the sugar plus the caffiene!)

I made this in a silicone bundt pan. In my oven at 350•F it took about 45 minutes(timed for 30 minutes and then checked every 5 minutes till it was done). The result was a very good looking, delicious chocolate cake!!! I simply dusted it with powdered sugar.

The texture is beautiful, the method is easy but the taste is disappointing. I probably used too much coffee but the recipe did state a strong dose was required. It doesn't hit the spot as far as quenching my chocolate craving so unfortunately this is a failure for me.

It was one of my best cakes!!! I did read some reviews before baking it, so I made some changes to the recipe. I added 3/4th cup oil instead of the 1/2 cup mentioned, 2 tsp of baking powder instead of 1 tsp and a pinch of salt. Though I did have to bake it for 40 mins, probably something is different about my oven. I made just one layer, topped it with chocolate fudge frosting. Amazing thing was it was perfectly moist even after refrigerating it. My friends loved it. I'm so making this cake again!!!

Very easy to put together. It's hard to say if my favourite part is the taste or not having a stack of dirty dishes after making this!

Use high quality cocoa powder and vanilla, and make sure your baking soda is still active! Do not skimp on the liquids, but sugar can be varied according to taste.

I messed this up because the cake had been in for a few min when i realized i forgot to add the coffee so i took it out and added it and put it back in. There is too much batter for one 8 inch round pan , u need two or just dont use all the batter. I thought the finished cake was too moist/had alot of moisture in it. Probably wont go with this recipe again. As far as flavor it was good

This cake can't be done wrong (unless you over-bake it). Was even distracted one day while putting it together and forgot to add the sugar until right before the coffee and it still turned out perfectly. Always moist, fluffy and full of chocolate flavor. My go-to recipe for chocolate cake.

By far the easiest and most delicious chocolate cake.  I am a professional baker and this is my go-to chocolate cake I make for my customers.  It is a perfect texture, not too airy, not too dense.  FULL OF FLAVOR!
Did I mention easy, i make this in a silver bowl with wire whisk.

I made this as direct and it turned out fantastic! I used to always say I tolerated cake to eat the frosting. But with this cake I can eat it with no frosting at all. Its got a really great flavor. No more prepackaged chocolate cake mixes for me.

This is the best dark chocolate cake I have ever tasted. Coffee is the key to bringing that deep cocoa flavor to its finest. Very easy recipe. Loved it'. I made coconut milk whipped cream to go with the cake instead of icing. Great combo. Will use this recipe for years to come. Thanks!

What a wonderful cake!  This cake was easy to mix together, moist and not overpowering.  I did however mix all my dry ingredients together and then all my wet ingredients (minus the coffee) and then blended them together.  I made sure the coffee was good and hot and mixed it in very well once all my ingredients were blended nicely.
To make it 'lighter' I halved the sugar and used unsweetened apple sauce in place of the oil and it still turned out moist and delicious.  The house smelled so good while this was baking!
I used the Special Buttercream Icing from this site and cut the cake into small squares, piped the icing on (tinted pink for Valentines Day) and placed a red gummy heart in the middle of the icing.  
Definitely a keeper for a quick hassle free cake.

I made this exactly how the recipe stated and it came out fabulous.  I made it as a birthday cake and everyone looooved it. Everyone had seconds and there was none left (which is a first)!!  So easy to make, and the texture was raved about, as well as how moist the cake was.  Will make again for sure!

This is an incredibly good cake!  I didn't have enough oil, so I melted a stick of butter in its place.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to bring out the chocolate flavor.  Goes together very quickly!  Mine had to bake about 40-45 minutes before it tested done.  Will make this one over and over!

Great one bowl recipe.  I like how you don't have to use cold coffee.  Made exactly as is.  Only cooking time was far too short.  Added an extra 20 mins.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest recipe I followed. It came out well. I made it for the birthday celebration of my son in his class. As soon as kids saw it, everybody started saying "looks yummy",and it was really yummy!

Tried baking it on two different occasions and both times it had no flavor, plus both times it burnt on the outside while still batter on the inside at 350 F.

I made the recipe almost to the t. I only cut back on the sugar a little bit, (I omitted half a cup) and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I served it with vanilla ice cream. I personally loved it! It is very tasty but my friends thought  it needs some kind of glaze on top. They thought it was a bit dry to serve on its own and suggested that I should serve it with coffee or tea instead.

I didn't over bake it by the way. Maybe baking for 20 minutes instead of 25 would make it more moist.

I will try to find a nice glaze and keep the recipe fo future use

This will be my "go to" chocolate cake recipe from now on. I was a little skeptical with the amount of coffee but, once I tasted the cake, I was sold. I made a minor substitution; instead of vegetable oil I use extra virgin coconut oil. I used this recipe for the "groom" part of my "bride and groom" cupcakes for a work bridal shower and everyone commented on how moist the chocolate cake was. Great recipe, thank you!

Love, love, love this recipe. I covered it with the Coffee Butter Frosting recipe from here.  Just for giggles, I sprinkled dry coffee grounds over the top and it added just the special thing our little birthday cake needed. My husband said "You better make this again." I guess so, since he ate four pieces.  :)  This one is a keeper.

Moist and delicious!  I even ran out of all purpose and had to use freshly ground soft white wheat flour for one and it was delicious.  I also used rice milk on one - again, delicious.

Excelent recipe! Everyone loved it! The only ingredient I changed, was 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup vegetable oil, instead of 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I used instant coffee: 2 teaspoon in 1 cup of boiling water.
Just the perfect cake. Thanks

This was moist and rich, however when mixing it up, I noticed there were no salt indications other than the baking soda.  I thought it was a tad flat in flavor and think that 1 tsp. salt might make the difference.  A definite keeper, but will add salt next time!

This is a moist, delicious, and straightforward recipe. I topped it with mocha frosting. The only negative is I feel there is a tad too much baking soda in the recipe as given. Other than that, wonderful, thanks for the recipe Nanci!

This is the first cake I have ever made and was very impressed! I wanted a light chocolate taste that wasn't too overwhelming and this by far fit exactly what I had wanted perfectly!  I just added 1/4 tsp of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and added the hot coffee at the end.  I didn't have a 9x13 pan so instead used an 8x8 pan and baked for 38-40 mins and used a 12 count muffin pan and baked that for 25 mins.  I sprinked powdered sugar on top and served with fresh strawberries. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Wouldn't make this again. It tasted bland...but it was moist. I was really surprised at how much we didn't like this cake. Followed the directions exactly. Figured with all of the positive reviews it would be a great cake but it really didn't turn out any better than mediocre. I've had box mixes that were much better.

Not sure why others said this is bland. I did not add salt as others mentioned because I read the reviews while the batter was baking. Next time I will add salt and then this cake will be fabulous. Note I used 1/2 the amount of sugar called for (there is plenty of sugar in the filling and frosting and I cut the sugar in half with those as well) and I made really strong coffee. The flavor is very good. After the cake is decorated, there will be plenty of sweetness. Good easy recipe to make. Oh, and I'm all about chocolate!!!!!!

This is the first time I made a cake from scratch and this cake turned out moist and delicious.  I covered it with the 1 minute chocolate icing which was also very yummy.  I did add a pinch of salt, not sure if it added anything but I will add a pinch of salt again since the cake turned out perfect.

This is one of the easiest cakes I have ever made! It is pretty fool proof too, given that twice I have forgotten the coffee and had to pull the cake out of the oven after several minutes of baking to mix in the coffee, and still it came out great!

I used half Splenda and half white sugar, still tasted fantastic! I tried it with dark chocolate cocoa powder and the coffee brought out the delicious dark chocolate flavor like crazy! Such a good recipe.  When used for cupcakes, decrease temp a little bit and cook for about 14 min. otherwise they'll be very dry.  Happy baking!

Spectacular recipe.  Another reviewer stated that this recipe was on the back of Hershey's cocoa at one time with the exception of 1) buttermilk instead of regular milk and 2) 1 tsp of salt.  I subbed with those and the cake was super moist and delicious!  Definitely making this again!

I made this exactly as written & found it had too much of a coffee flavor. My two 4 yr olds & husband didn't like it at all. I thought it was pretty good but next time I'll either skip the coffee or only put in a tiny bit.

This recipe was on the Hersheys cocoa container years ago, with two exceptions:  add 1 tsp. salt, and it called for buttermilk instead of milk.  I think the buttermilk does make a difference.  I sometimes bake it in a 15 x 10 x 1 to stretch servings.  Great recipe all around and a family favorite!

This cake was so easy i was sure it was gonna taste awful, but it was surprisingly moist and tasted really good, and it rose really high,  i tweaked it a bit, i added a bit of salt and added chocolate flavoring in addition to the vanilla flavoring required by the recipe...will definitely be making this again and again..thanks for sharing

Definitely add 1-2 teaspoons of salt, like others have suggested. I made 24 cupcakes with this recipe, and they were pretty good after I added salt.

We had guests last night and I was looking for a quick and easy dessert.  This looked good, so I made it.  Being in a hurry, I accidentally left out the vanilla.  It was still very tasty.  I will be making this again, over and over, I'm sure!!  I frosted it with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site, which was super easy and fabulous!!!
It does need salt, though.  I added 1/2-1 teaspoon of salt.

Easy to make, fun and somewhat delicious. It is bland and not chocolaty enough for me, but it's easy fixable with whipped cream, chips, milk or liquor poured over it. It tastes a lot better when cooled than when warm

This cake is moist and lovely, but lacked flavor, so next time I will try "blooming" the cocoa in the hot coffee for a few minutes first.  I might also try using melted butter for the oil, but messing with the consistency of butter (whether to cream it with the sugar, add it with all the dry goods, or melt it) can dramatically affect the texture of the cake, so I will have to experiment with it a few more times.  BUT, because it does lack a little flavor, my fluffy cream-cheese frosting really bumped it up, when otherwise it may have been too much...Either way, it needs more chocolate flavor.  My hubby suggested throwing in a cup of chocolate chips too...This is good enough to be your "go-to" cake...

I tried the first one apart from it sunk in the middle, the wife said it did not taste very nice, the second using half of the ingredients and adding a pinch of salt still did not rise very much@ but the wife said it tasted great:  not sure why it doesn't rise very much.

Fantastic.  Easy to make, no mixer needed.  I made cupcakes and they are moist and really good tasting.
20-24 mins. bake time.  I did cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.

This came out great!  We are not coffee drinkers so I just used hot water and it was still wonderful!  It was the most moist cake I have ever made from scratch.. We had company for dinner tonight and she was amazed that I had made it all by myself.. without a cake mix!  I will make this again and even fancy it up more next time..I just served it with whip cream on the top as I didnt have time to pick out a frosting! My husband just finished the few crumbs that were left in the bottom of the pan!  It's a hit at our place!

This cake was wonderful!  I made it for my 2 year old's birthday (substituted hot water for hot coffee) and it was still great.  I've also made it since with the coffee and that just gives it a richer and deeper flavor.  So much better than out of a box, this will be my standby for chocolate cake! (Update:  made this again for my son's 4th birthday cake and it got rave reviews.  so moist and so flavourful and SO easy!!)

Best chocolate cake I've ever had (or made)!  For the icing I used a recipe with a thicker consistency while the cake was still warm so it glossed up nicely, and then sprinkled crushed werther's on top... icing sugar on top is nice as well.

This chocolate cake was great.  It came out very moist.  I actually divided the batter into two portions and baked them separately because it didn't fit into my baking tin.  It came out as a perfect layer cake.  
Only comment is that it took about 50 minutes for each cake to cook rather than the recommended 25-35 min. but this might be due to my oven.

This recipe was really easy to make, pretty much as easy as a box cake. I did make some alterations that had been suggested in previous reviews. I added 3/4 tsp salt. I also used 1/4 butter instead of the oil because the butter just sounded more appealing. 

I learned as I was adding the ingredients that I was low on white flour so in a pinch I had to substitute 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. You can't even taste the difference.

I made cupcakes with this. The cake has a great texture and consistancy when baked. It's just missing somthing in the flavor department, it needs more chocolate flavor. But it still is good and I would recommend trying this recipe yourself.

This is great! I made it in two round pans for a layer cake... I didn't use coffe, but just another cup of milk... I frosted it with a condensed milk frosting... it's divine! But definitely add some salt to balance out the flavors!

This was so good.  The coffee was noticeable (and I LOVE coffee) but not overpowering so even my husband and kids liked it (not coffee drinkers).  I made a cream cheese frosting to go with it because there was enough chocolate for my taste just with the cake.  I tried cooking it in two 9" p-ans and even though I didn't use all of the batter, one pan overflowed.  SO I don't recommend doing that unless yours have high sides.  I'll be buying new pans so I can make this again, next time without the oven clean up.

Very good recipe!   I was desperately seeking an easy chocolate cake recipe that didn't require butter (as I was all out!) and this fit the bill.  I added some salt as suggested by other.  Turned out very good and moist.  Would definately make again!
