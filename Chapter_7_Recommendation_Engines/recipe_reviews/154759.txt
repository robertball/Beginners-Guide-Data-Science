I made this recipe from the Krasnapolski Hotel in Amsterdam on Christmas morning with the addition of 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese and 20 oz. frozen spinach, thawed, drained, and mixed into the batter along with 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese. Great served with halved grape tomatoes and shredded basil in a light vinaigrette, along with fresh fruit and crusty, buttered bread. This recipe makes wonderful left-overs, easily reheated in the microwave.

There are plenty of recipes for oven omelets full of veggies and meat, but I was looking for a very simple protein dish so that the fresh fruit and cranberry scones I served wouldn't have to compete with a riot of flavors.  This recipe was perfect.  The only changes I made were to skip the melted butter and just grease the baking dish with a tablespoon of butter, and I reduced the remaining recipe by half for an 8" square baking dish.  The Jack cheese is essential to the flavor.  I made it once with mozzarella and found that it was a bit too bland; but either Jack or Swiss gives it a nice more-than-just-eggs kick.  It makes a pretty dish and slices very neatly.  I will make it often.

This was good. Everyone liked it's a 4, certainly not a 5. I had to cook it around 40 minutes to make sure the center was cooked. I cooked, and added some crumbled sausage. If you make some toast you have a complete breakfast.

This is just plain easy and terrific!  I would make it again in a heartbeat.  All the other suggestions are great and will give them a try too.  I might like to try Chorizo sausage or maybe crab in it too.  A keeper for sure! Thanks!

Big hit with my husband and two boys. I actually used my cast iron skillet for this. Just plopped the butter in the skillet and stuck it in the oven while it preheated. I did add a little Frank's Hot Sauce and some fresh ground pepper. I think next time, seeing as this is so simple, I might saute some vegetables in the skillet with the butter, then add in the egg ingredients and throw it into the oven. Very VERY simple, which I appreciated. It's like a quick omelette!

I have used a similar recipe every Christmas for more than 20 years.  This recipe is a bit skimpy for  12 people.  I use 20 eggs, 2lb. cottage cheese and  2 lb. shredded jack cheese.  I add 2 small cans of chopped green chiles. This fills two pans: a 9"x13" + 7"x11" pan.

This was just delicious!  I tried it for breakfast this morning when looking for some variety from the norm- I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand- not quite enough montery jack cheese for the recipe so I supplemented the rest with parmesan.  I scaled the recipe down to  2 servings, and made them in 2 4 inch ramekins.  I cooked for about 20 minutes.  Divine, and very fancy looking with cut melon on a pretty plate.  I don't know why people would save this for Christmas, it was simple to prepare and divine to eat.  I'll be making it more often then once a year!

This sounded boring to me but I ended up being surprised at how good it is!  I made it just as written except that I omitted the butter.

This egg dish was easy to make. I didn't add the cottage cheese and I used an italian blend of cheeses. It turned out delicious.

Good recipe!  Made it with cheddar (medium) cheese.  Kids and adults all liked its flavor.  Made another with onion, garlic, red pepper, orange pepper, and yellow squash.  Also used colby jack with this recipe, worked out well.  Different flavor, but wonderful - takes longer to cook and need a larger baking dish, but well worth the wait.

A 20 year tradition WITH the addition of 2 4 OZ CANS FINELY CHOPPED GREEN CHILES - called Chili Egg Puff around our house and my family would literally kill me if I didn't make this Christmas morning - or any morning you have a lot of people to feed.  Even easier - Make it the day before and just bake in the AM - and individually FREEZE the leftover squares (if any!) and microwave for 1 minute on high - good as fresh baked.

Super easy recipe! My family likes seasonings so I added 1/2 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 1 tsp of sea salt, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of minced onion to this recipe.  Was just enough to give it a bit more kick.  Still tasted great reheated the next morning!!

This is a LOT like a recipe I make for Easter brunch (and sometimes for dinner) and my family LOVES it. I use half egg beaters though, as well as low-fat cheeses. I also make it the night before to save time and serve it with low-fat blueberry muffins.

This is not just made on xmas. I make it all year round.  It is to easy and good.  The perfect base for any number on possibilities.  I've made it just as and it's good but I love adding things to it.  Vegetable or meants and different cheeses.  Try it and you'll like it.  Only thing I do different is cook it longer but no big deal.

This was extremely delicious. I adapted this to my crock pot and it came out beautifully. I melted the butter in the microwave first and put it in the bottom of the crock. I didn't have a blender handy so I just mixed everything in a bowl. I was going to skimp a little on the cheese but glad I didn't. I put the mixture in on top of the butter and turned it on high for about 2 and half   hours. I would check it after 2 hours though. Mine was completely done in the next half hour. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was what I have been looking for for years...literally!  I tried the other casseroles on this site that received high ratings but they weren't at all like this. This was light and fluffy!  My family kept raving about it and saying how tasty it was.  I did add some chopped green onions and a can of crab.  After it was done I topped it with sliced avocados.   I am definitely going to make this again! LOVE IT!

A good, easy recipe, however it needs some seasonings. My family and guests enjoyed it as written, but next time I'm going to add some sauted onions, salt and pepper, and some hot sauce or jalapeno peppers or cayenne pepper. It needs a bit of a boost. I found the cheese didn't separate from the eggs as someone wrote, and I also found that cooking it for 30 minutes was fine in my oven.

very good! I used shredded mozzarella  in place of the monterey jack (all i had), and added some onion powder and garlic powder along with salt and pepper before baking.  I also put some thawed and drained broccoli in the bottom before adding the egg mixture.  Turned out great and i agree it is very adaptable! Even my 20 month old asked for seconds. very simple yet good!

Loved it! This was simple and delicious.I made this Christmas morning and made only half the recipe.I only had 5 adults and 2 children to feed and thought half would be plenty...what a mistake.We were all practically fighting over the last piece!
I will be using this recipe often, but will lighten it up by using reduced fat cheeses.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. The flour and baking powder along with the cottage cheese give it great mouthfeel. I'm always on the lookout for low carb options and this hit the mark. I sautéed four large scallions and two cups or fresh chopped spinach to give it some color and texture.  Because we like things spicy, I also added 1/2 tsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt; 1/4 tsp pepper; 1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapeños; and a couple of tablespoons of Crystal hot sauce. I reduced the recipe to 6 servings expecting the three of us would eat it all but there are leftovers for lunch because it was as filling as it was delicious

Oh so yummy.  Oh so easy.  I added a bit of freshly ground pepper and a bit of ground mustard.  My family devoured thus.  Will make again and again.  You could top it with veggies but I wouldn't bake them in because it may ruin the wonderful creamy texture.

This was a yummy dish. Though I did not put in as much cheese as was listed, it was really a nice light dish. I loved how the cheese seperated from the egg mixture, when sliced on the plate it was rather attractive! Oh, I also used my electric mixer rather than the blender. :) Thanks for this one! Fantastic!!

I really enjoyed this but the family had mixed reviews.  Some members didn't like the texture.  Others said it needed more flavor.

This is so good and super easy!  I halved the recipe for trying it out. I baked the full 30 minutes after checking it at to 20 and 25 minute mark. Excellent egg taste and texture. got a nice slightly Brown and crispy edge. I will make this for every day breakfast. Thank you!!

Similar to Dutch Babies except the oven isn't as hot so it doesn't puff up as much. Good with the cheese. For Dutch babies I make a fruity sauce while the eggs are baking, would go good with this too. Frozen strawberries and blueberries, a little sugar, cooked until syrupy.

I made this years ago and every year since, and didnt realize that I had yet to give it the rating it deserved - Excellent! its a great base recipe, perfect as is and malleable to taste.  My daughter loves this! and Im making it again this year as usual (I like to add a bit of tomato and spinach to it, and boost up the butter just a pat)

If you like quiches, you should def. give this a try. Here, we've never had one so I decided to make it for dinner this Wednesday night. I changed the cheese cause I never have that type [[some sorta mozz./parm. mix]]. I also added bacon an spinach to go with the whole quiche theme. My madre ate it cold from the fridge an said it was pretty good, my padre ate it but he didn't care for it, my lil brother basically..threw a fit. Not the fault of the recipe, but he did not like the spinach then when I told him there were eggs he further freaked out. Ugg.....BUT what ultimately I decided to give were four stars as my other brother ate half of it =) All in all, THANK YOU for this easy, easy recipe

Nothing to write home about. It was good. Not great. Not terrible, just filled our stomachs xmas morning. Was looking for something less sweet, more protein, yet simple and special, but will go back to the baked french toast next year.

This was eggcellent!  I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.  My husband ate it with homemade salsa and my toddlers ate it with salsa and without salsa.  This is a keeper!  Quick, Easy and Yummy! Thanks

This is the recipe that my friends and I have for Christmas Eve brunch every year.  We enjoy it with Mimosas.  It is easy to make and yummy served with sour cream and salsa!
