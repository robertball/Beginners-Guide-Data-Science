I have been a lurker around the allrecipes site for a few years now and many of the recipes I use have come from this site but I have never reviewed anything here before because I hate signing up for stuff online (usually leads to tons of spam) but this recipe compelled me to sign up so that I could leave my review!

What a wonderful cake!!  I was looking for something that used no eggs nor oil, and I found this one.  I was a bit skeptical but decided to try it anyway and it came out of the oven about 20 minutes ago.  YUM!!  My 7 year old (mr. picky)is eating some now.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.

I would suggest to the reviewer that had a bad experience with it, to try again.  Perhaps you had a bad batch of flour or something else that day.

I made it without any cloves (we don't like cloves) and loved it!!  I was a little concerned about the density of the batter while I was mixing it but the cake turned out beautifully.  I'll definitely be making this again!! (Thanks!!)

This is one of the best applesauce cake recipes I have ever used.  It is a perfect size in an 8 inch square pan.  I used butter not margarine, and baked it for 45 minutes.  I thought the batter was very stiff and was a little worried, but it came out perfect.  I used the ingredients exactly as listed.  I dusted it with powdered sugar when it was still slightly warm and served it.  They all loved it including the grandchildren.  Thanks for a great recipe, I'll use it many times I am sure.

I thnk I would rate this even higher if I could. I bake this for a friend who gave me alot of apples and said make me something. So i made apple sauce using gala apples and then used the apple sauce in this cake. The cake was moist and flavorful. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had. everyone loved this cake and I did not have a piece so I made another and I loved it. I used whipped cream cheese frosting fromthis site on it. perfect combo. Try this you will love it!

I was causously optimistic because there are no eggs. To say I was disappointed would be a polite understatement. I followed the recipe to the letter and turned out wet bricks that I didn't even trust in the garbage disposal! I was flabergasted due to all the rave reviews. I was tempted to try it again because I don't take to failure , but after reviewing the recipe and knowing I did everything it said to do I retired it to the trash.

We really enjoyed eating this cake.  My boys--2 and 5--liked helping to make it.  We made it yesterday and it is still moist and fresh-tasting today. (I used a 9-inch springform pan which worked fine.  The cake looked nice on display after we removed the ring from the springform pan.)

This was the first applesauce cake I ever made.  It was easy and it tasted soooooo good.  I left out the walnuts but added 1 teaspoon vanilla.

I am rating this based on the modifications I made.....  I did not use raisins or walnuts, as I had neither in the house....... I used HOMEMADE apple sauce, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for a different depth of flavor, added one egg, and added 1 chopped GALA apple into the batter........

I made these in muffin form, so I greased the pan, and covered the sides and bottom of each cup with cinnamon sugar before putting the batter in each cup.....

After they finished (about 20-25 minutes), I poked holes in each one while still hot, and drizzled caramel sauce over each one, allowing the sauce to drain into the muffins......Result???  ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bland nothing! This was loaded with flavor! I did use spelt flour, and thick homemade unsweetened applesauce, and it was fantastic. Next time I will halve the sugar, though, and I think this would be excellent with some diced apple for even more "zip" and moistness. I don't like raisins normally, but it was great in this. COOKING NOTE: Doubled recipe and baked in bundt pan at 325 for one hour. The crusty edges were the best!

I really enjoyed this cake.  I had never made applesauce cake before, and I was pleased with the results.  I didn't have any raisins, so I chopped up an apple to add into the mix.  It turned out dense and moist.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved this cake.  The applesauce makes it very moist and keeps the raisins plump.
Delicious!!!

Since I did not make the recipe exactly as written, I gave 4 stars....and wow-- I just got done eating a big mouthful of this cake and it is so good, very moist and flavorful!  I added about 1/4 cup more applesauce since that was all that was left in my jar and I wanted to finish it off and I added about 1/8 tsp of cloves and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg instead of the full 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I did not have raisins or walnuts on hand so I added about 3/4 cup of oats and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  After I poured it into the pan, I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon over the top and cooked it for 33 minutes and it was done all the way and browning on the edges.  We already ate half the pan for breakfast and I have a feeling it is not going to last through the day!

This was a wonderful cake, but I found I had to add more applesauce to make it moist. I added a total of 3 cups of homemade applesauce and it turned out wonderful!

I love this recipe. My son is allergic to eggs, and this cake has been a life saver for our family (quite literally!) I have made this cake for his last 2 birthdays, and many times in between. I use Smart Balance for the butter, and some times I use Turbinado sugar instead of white.
If the recipe is doubled it fits nicely into 2 round cake pans for a layer cake!

I was looking for a recipe that used only 1 cup of applesauce so I could use up last years homemade applebutter. The substitution worked great! I did add about a 1/4 cup of water because the applebutter was a lot thicker than applesauce.  Sure glad a reviewer mentioned how thick the batter was, otherwise I might have thought there was a mistake in the recipe. You can barely call it batter, its more like refrigerator cookie dough before its chilled.  I like this a lot better than my old applesauce cake & will use this recipe from now on.

I love to cook but hate to bake.  This was easy, good and makes a lot.  I doubled the recipe for a 10 x 14 pan and came out great.  What more can you ask of a recipe.

The" cake" is tasty and easy to make. I might categorize it as a bread. The recipe directs cook to pour batter. There is no way to pour the batter. It can be spread..not poured.

This was yummy, my boyfriend loved it! I added a little vanilla extract. I needed to cook it for longer than 40 minutes though. It needed at least another 10-15 min. I also made a cream cheese frosting which was great with it!

I made this substituting 1/2 cup of agave nectar for the sugar and 1 cup of whole wheat flour for white, and it turned out great! Very easy to make and had a nice flavor and texture- ideal for breakfast/brunch, or a healthy snack or dessert. Will definitely make this again! Note: baking time was only about 15 minutes in my oven in a 9" square pan, so make sure to check well before the instructed 40 minutes are up.

Instead of nuts and raisins, I added 3/4c of oats. Gives it the bulk needed and lower in fat. This is so easy to make, and stays moist! *IF* it lasted more than 2 days, I think it would keep up to 4 (without refrigeration) and still be moist. Thank you!

Definitely a keeper...we all really enjoyed it.  I did opt to leave the nuts out since my husband wouldn't have liked them and I put craisins in place of raisins since I don't like raisins.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe, only adding 2tbsp flour and 1/4 cup extra applesauce (for high altitude). It was moist and flavorful, and was gone in one sitting. The second time, I doubled the recipe, but used 1/3 the butter and 1/4 the sugar, and added a pint jar of apples from my home-canned stock. I then frosted it with maple cream cheese frosting (from this site). My husband couldn't stop eating it! Good recipe!

This is such an excellent cake, and so easy/ fast to make! We didn't have eggs, so I was looking for something sweet to make without. The batter DOES seem thick at first, but it bakes up wonderfully, and the applesauce makes it nicely moist inside. 
I took other reviewers' suggestions: omitted nuts & cloves (had none), substitute 1/4 cup oatmeal for 1/4 cup of the flour, used margarine, added 1/4 tsp vanilla. Husband LOVED this one, and he is not a big raisin fan. He came back for fourths..! It's sweet enough, just a dusting of powdered sugar on top is great. Yummy!! I look forward to more with a cup of java tomorrow morning!

This cake was delicious.  Tasty and moist.  I've made it twice now. The first time I used an 8x8 pan as suggested but the edges cooked way before the middle and the cake was somewhat soggy in the centre. The second time I made  this recipe I used a 9x9 pan and had even baking throughout the cake. Yes, the cake is not as tall but it is evenly done and just as tasty.

I was intrigued as this recipe had no eggs. A co-worker gave me a ton of homemade applesauce after his harvest and I tried 3 different recipes I found online. The homemade applesauce was perfect as I was worried it might lack a certain sweetness as with store/processed applesauce. More than pleasantly surprise how good that cake was...and easy to make! Bakers will know that typically "spice" cake aren't particularly sweet; ones made with any combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves etc. I made it again with store-bought applesauce and just as happy with the results!

At first I thought a mistake was made because there were no eggs listed. After reading a review I saw that this was just the way the recipe was.  I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad I did.  I made a few changes and it turned out superb beauce it was such a good recipe to start with.  I used brown suger and cut it back by 1/3.  I toasted my walnuts and used unsalted butter, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt, just in case.  I also grated in fresh nutmeg and since I doubled the recipe, I used 1 cup of oat bran for one of the cups of  flour.  My house smells divine, a perfect cake with a cup of tea or coffee any time of year but especially on a cold rainy day like today.

I've made this cake twice. Both times I used Earth Balance vegan spread in place of the butter to make the cake vegan.

The first time I used unbleached white flour and added one small grated zucchini.  That combo worked out nicely.

The second time I used 1 cup unbleached white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and changed it to Craisins instead of raisins. Also spread Tofuti "Better Than Cream Cheese" on it while it was hot from the oven. That worked out nicely too. A keeper -- thanks!

When I first took the cake out of the oven, my family was not impressed.  
However, the next morning they loved it!!  I agreed - it was Better the second day!  FYI - I did add 1/4 of oil as well.

I  made this cake for a church bake sale last year and now I am making another one for this years bake sale. It was a huge success.  I did leave out the nuts and raisins as most people may have allergies. It was perfect and would not change another thing with it.

Great easy recipe. I used nutmeg instead of cloves and added 1/4 cup cranberries with a handful of coconut to the walnuts. I was glad to search for a recipe without ingredients, because my cupboard needed replenished. This was so easy using my Kitchen-aid mixer. One bowl and ta-daah! Thanks.

The batter is very thick when you're ready to pour it.  Don't worry about it, trust the recipe!  This is great, and easy to modify or add additional spices as you wish.

Instead of cloves, and raisins (because I didn't have any), I used chocolate chips, and made them into muffins, cooking for about 22minutes. They turned out AMAZING. I will make these over and over again!

I make this recipe so often for breakfast.  It's easy and the whole family loves it!  I made a few modifications by using white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, leaving out the raisins and nuts (it seems to make it less dry), and trading the ground clothes for a little but of pumpkin pie spice.

This cake was very easy to make and came out very moist. However I can't taste any apple flavor at all. I think that the cloves kind of overpower the taste of the applesauce.

I had to adjust the recipe to make it gluten-free.  I suspected it would not work without eggs, but I gave the recipe a try as it stands, because if it did work without eggs, I wanted it in my collection!
I made the Applesauce Cake IV at the same time, so the kids and I could give them a taste test.  The recipes are very similar.  I had no raisins, so neither recipe was made with those.  I cut the sugar in half because we are on a very low sugar diet.
Although this recipe held together a little better than IV, everyone preferred the flavor of IV.  The biggest difference is that this recipe calls for no salt, and less ground cloves, so perhaps it would be just as good if one added salt and more cloves.:-)  As it stands, I will only make Applesauce Cake IV in future, with an egg or two added to help with the inherent gluten-free crumbliness.

I came across this recipe after searching for something to make with my 2 year old using leftover applesauce.  We made it as written, with the exception of obmitting the nuts.  For us, this cake came out nicely!  It had just the right texture and amount of moisture to be a sweet breakfast bread.  I think the quality of this recipe depends strongly on the applesauce that you use.  We used an unsweetened applesauce that was a bit tart.  The cake came out beautifully - just the right level of sweetness for us!  There wasn't any need to add a confectioner's glaze.  I got up this morning to discover that Hubby had helped himself to three pieces, so this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Had unsweetened applesauce I needed to use. Made this, was skeptical(no eggs), but great recipe. Not supper sweet which is good, a moist coffee cake, the husband is not crazy about raisins so used chocolate chips and pecans. 8x8 pan was just the right size for the 2 of us.

Made this to take to my daughter's kindergarten class for snack. It tasted good but I was expecting more of an apple taste - it actually tasted almost like gingerbread. I would probably reduce the cloves next time. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan and it takes longer to cook that way, so it was a bit hard to get the middle cooked through. Overall the kids seemed to like it and I would probably make it again as a filling snack.

I am not sure what happened to those who felt this was too dry. This cake is very moist, and had a wonderful flavor. This recipe is easy enough to bake in the morning to carry to work to share with co-workers as a breakfast treat instead of donuts.

Just finished making this cake.  I added a tsp. vanilla and extra cup of applesauce.  Didn't use nuts/raisins since hubby can't have them.  However, the cake was delicious and very moist.  I  will definitely make this one again.  It's a very easy recipe and quick to make.

I doubled the recipe using 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of oatmeal.  Instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar and added 2 tsp of vanilla.  I omitted the cloves and added a little more applesauce, cinnamon, and added a chopped apple at the end. My husband loved it and he is a health nut.  He devoured the entire loaf in one sitting which is the first time ever.  It was moist and personally I thought it wasn't sweet enough but my 1 year daughter loved it as well as my husband.  That's all that matters!

This cake was quite tasty and very easy to make.  But it did not look pretty at all.  The kind of cake to make for snacking, not to bring to an event or have for guests.

Great loaf! I was sort with the applesauce maybe by 5 tablespoons and added rum to make the one cup. I also only used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. My applesauce was already sweetened, so the adjustments were perfect! THANKS!!

With all the applesauce in this recipe, I had hoped for a moister cake.  It also seems to be lacking a bit in flavor, I might try adding more cinnamon or some allspice.  Cream cheese frosting on top is yummy!

This was SUPER moist, so moist I thought it was not done cooking. I omitted the nuts and raisins because I like neither. I also used cinnamon applesauce and topped with powdered sugar. My 3 year old enjoyed helping in on this recipe!

This was delicious! I have two young children, so I'm always staring at applesauce in the fridge. I made a few tweeks to the recipe for personal taste, and it came out fabulous. Just like grandma used to make! Thanks!

This cake is delicious! A few extra thing I did were: use margarine rather than butter, use sweetener in the recipe rather than sugar, sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar on top of the cake before baking, and drizzled the baked cake with homemade glaze (2 tablespoons of icing sugar and a few drops of water). This cake tastes great heated up!

This is a nice easy snack cake.  I had pear butter I wanted to use up so used that instead of applesauce and added 1/3 cup egg beaters.  The cake was mixed before my oven was hot - its so easy.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and enjoy.

What a great cake.  It turned out very moist and delicious.  My husband had never had an applesauce cake and thought that it was excellent and wanted me to make it again for him.  The only thing that I changed was to add a little vanilla and extra cinnamon.

Absolutely delicious, didn’t change a thing. Everyone loved it, and most certainly will make again without changing a thing!
Tastes like what I believe John Boy Walton’s favourite apple sauce cake would taste like!!

OMG, if I could give this less than one star, I would. Easily the worst cake recipe I've ever seen, and I have over 20 years of experience! I thought I had seen it all, but  Jeebus!

Okay, where to begin? 1) This recipe does not call for any salt. Any baker worth her salt (haha) would know that even in sweet baked goods, you need to add salt to prevent them from tasting flatly sweet, AND for the proper chemical reactions. 2) Two cups (2 CUPS!) of flour to 1 cup of apple sauce as the only liquid? You know what you get out of this ratio? A lump of dough that's even thicker and heavier than cookie dough. OMG. 3) This is apple spice cake. Brown sugar is needed for the beautiful, golden color, and the moist, fluffy texture! It should have been 1/2 cup of white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

If you must use this recipe, add in 1/4 teaspoon salt, just under 1 cup of milk, and replace the 1/4 teaspoon of clove with 1/4 teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spices.

This recipe is easy ---- and very tasty! I made it with the nuts and raisins ---- so good! I made a small change to the recipe --- I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I have a friend who has an allergy to eggs ---- this recipe is perfect for him! 
I read the reviews and saw the reviews that weren't so good. I'm not sure what went wrong with their cake, but I had no problem with it at all!

I've modified this recipe by:

1.  Substituting brown sugar for white
2.  Add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg
3.  Add 1/4 tsp allspice
4.  Add 1 full cup raisins (instead of 1/2)
5.  Exchanged walnuts for pecans

I also make my own applesauce...

Also, I start checking for the cake to be done within 25 minutes of going into the oven (I use an oven thermometer, and at 350f it takes a lot less time in my oven to bake).

I just made this and it is great. So easy but I did modify it because I was using all purpose gluten free flour. I added 1 xlarge egg to the mixture as gluten free flour takes a little more liquid than regular flour and also a little more than a tsp of baking soda. Will definitely be making again.

My family of 9 loves this recipe! The applesauce does not necessarily need to be chilled. We use chunky applesauce and maybe add 2 tbsp extra of it. We also didn't add the cloves, nuts or raisins and it is still divine. In my oven it only took 35 mins. Super easy recipe.

Easy, tastes great, did I say easy? I just whipped this up at midnight, so we can have it with breakfast and I have to say it is the easiest cake I have made. I made it exactly as the recipe shows, minus the nuts. I made it even easier by using my microwave bundt pan and this beautiful cake was baked in 10 minutes! It filled the bundt perfectly. It is a little denser than a typical boxed cake, but makes a perfect breakfast treat. Could even be sliced thin and buttered. Will be making again and again! Thank you!

I have tons of canned applesauce so decided to try this.  Very good recipe.  I had to take a picture of this.  I took this out of the oven and thought "someone must love me".  There was an image of a heart ontop of the cake.  As far as the flavor, very good.  Amazing it did not call for eggs.  Quick and simple.

This is one of my family's favorite.  For those of you who must eat glutten free, this recipe worked real well when I substited the flour for a gluten free "flour" blend.  Try adding a simple sugar glaze for those with an extra sweet tooth!

This cake is quick and delicious; it's also a great mommy-daughter baking activity.  My 2-year-old loves to help add the ingredients and stir, and since there are no eggs, she gets to taste the batter.  We have one of these cakes cooling on the counter right now.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

I have made this several times and kept forgetting to come on here and review it!  This is an AWESOME cake!  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the batter, but other than that, I didn't do ANYTHING different! This cake is great JUST by following these instructions in this recipe!  The only thing is for some reason my oven stinks at browning tops of things, so at the end of the baking, I turned the broiler on for about 3 mins to brown the top!  My husband LOVES this cake! A new family fave!

Quick, easy and good. I thought this would be gooey in the middle... it wasn't... but it was moist.  I also accidentally used nutmeg in place of cloves. This is still good and I would make it again :) Thanks!

After reading all the reviews, I was looking forward to making and eating this cake. I had my doubts when pouring it into the pan--it was so thick. My family all felt it was too dry and not really tasting of apples. It was like a spice and nut cake. If I make it again, I'll add a lot more applesauce and maybe an egg or two to moisten it.

A great recipe and easy to make.  I frequently substitute the applesauce with a couple bananas creamed with my mixer.  A great substitute.

This is really hard for me.  I hate giving anything a bad review, but this cake just didn't come through as far as flavor.  We found it to be extremely bland. I had to rescue it by spreading some apple butter I made yesterday on it. (From this site, Apple Butter II submitted by diane).  Now, on a positive note, the texture was magnificent!!  Light and spongy, yet very moist.  The top got an ever-so-slight crust to it that would hold up nicely to a thin glaze.  The bottom stayed moist, no crust at all - like a cake should be.  As a matter of fact, the texture is why I'll be hanging on to this recipe and doing a little experimenting.

Easy to make. Tastes great. My family loved it. Just don't bake it too long. I didn't have any raisins. Was good without them. I sprinkled cinnamon over it before I put it in the oven. I'd rate it about 4.8 .

Sounded simple and good so I tried it.  Took it to a family gathering and served it up warm with vanilla ice cream.  Delicious!  To dress it up I also sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  And to make it healthier I use half whole wheat flour.

I tried to sell this to my 3 and 5 year old children as "breakfast cake."  They loved the idea, but they were a tough sell.  I added 1/4 cup oatmeal in place of 1/4 cup of white flour and used one cup ww flour.  I also used applesauce I made this fall from my father-in-law's trees.  I used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  Overall, I liked the cake because it seemed healthier than eating a coffee cake or a doughnut for breakfast, but I would need to add something else to get my kids convinced!

I really like this cake.  I've made it twice in the past week.  It's especially nice because it uses no eggs and we're all out anyway!  I'm going to try using half white sugar and half brown next time I make it.

This cake is very easy and tastes delicious right from the oven. Only problem I had was that it seemed to dry out rather quickly and for a single person that is a problem. Still and all a very good breakfast bread type cake.

I can hardly wait to dive into this. I just took it out of the oven the entire place smells of wonder and spice.   Mmm looks delicious & I know it’s going to be. I made some changes?... was out of cloves, lots of walnuts and I used this product that I put in my shakes...Vanilla chai protein shake mix??. Rather creamy it looked wonderful and I’m sure it’s going to taste out of this world?.

Very dry had better very dissapointed . Maybe the lack of eggs it just was lacking in taste and texture. Just have to say the reviews that did like it added banana or more applesauce  or appkes,so if you do make this recipe better tweek it or you'll have DRY  cake. I don't see how people give 5 stars and change recipe it's not the recipe I go by stars when I look up recipe so not helpful .

I've made this every year for our Thanksgiving brunch for several years now.  It's easy, not too sweet and everyone loves the especially with a little dollop of whipped cream on top (though it doesn't need it! ). It's just perfect when you want something sweet without much fuss.  I made mine the night before and baked it in the morning.  Simple and delicious!

This was pretty good!  I made this with my home made applesauce and opted to leave out raisins/walnuts, but next time I will be adding something.  I did mix up some maple sugar oatmeal and butter and sprinkled it on top which was a good touch. This was very easy to make which is a bonus!

Not impressed.  Definitely not enough applesauce in this recipe, I added more, as the 'mix' was way too stiff - probably should have added even more.  Not enough spice, and definitely not moist.

I made this recipe just as directed and it turned out fantastic. The first time I made it was for a potluck and I could hear people at the dessert table talking about it and wishing there was more.
The only thing I did different was sprinkled some powdered sugar in the top for 'prettiness'.

The only thing I changed was that I doubled everything & baked in a 9 X 13 glass baking dish.
For convection oven, I baked it at 325 degrees for 40 mins.
Came out great!

This recipe didn't have enough liquid. I added 3/4 cup almond milk and 2 eggs. Used mix to blend.  For color I used 3/4 cup white and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I also used golden raisins rather than the black. with the extra liquid increase the bake time to about 75 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.  (this was with a loaf pan).

I made this using the recipe as written.  It is very good.  Quite heavy but delightful.  I think that if the original recipe said "put batter in" instead of "pour batter in" that people wouldn't worry.  The batter is quite thick. I used homemade applesauce (pressure cooker applesauce recipe from this site).  I think that I will cut back on the sugar next time as it is quite sweet.  The raisins also add sweetness!  The cooking time was as written.  My husband is really enjoying this!

Fabulous cake, easy and delicious! I put a brown butter icing over it that really took it to new heights, which I highly recommend. Hubby and son gobbled it up, and I’m not ashamed to admit I helped them. Try it, you’ll like it.

Made it in a bread pan with brown sugar, egg replacer, no nuts, and subbed craisins, margerine, also a pinch if salt. The best vegan cake/bread ive hard. My sister wants it for her birthday cake this year.  Comes out a bit dense so make sure you bake it as long as you can without burning the top.

Used stevia instead of sugar, nutmeg instead of clove, and an apple puree with probably a third cup fat free half-n-half. Only made this b/c it was simple and I had alot of apples going bad. It was pretty good, I'm not a real great bread or cake baker so I was expecting it to be a big doorstop.

This recipe produced a delicious and moist cake with plenty of flavor.  I made a substitution of 1/2 coconut oil for the butter.  It was a little messy in the mixing, but it worked out well.  I also added some dried plumbs (I think this recipe would work well with all varieties of dried fruit - I might try dried apricots next time). I will definitely make this recipe again!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Easy to make, good to do last minute cause it literally takes a few minutes but it’s just so so.  Crumbly on the fork and kind of dry.   Don’t think I’d make it again.

I would make it again. I used light brown sugar instead of white (not packed) and I used about 3/4 cup instead of a cup. I added a dash of salt, nutmeg and ginger as well. I did add the raisins but not the walnuts. I made it vegan and substituted  the butter with vegan butter. I also added a salted caramel icing.  I think next time I would put it into a loaf pan instead.

I needed to use some leftover applesauce from the daycare I work at, and I found this recipe. I didn’t have any nuts, so I left them out and, substituted allspice for the ground cloves as we only like them decorating a ham but not as an ingredients  for baked goods. The cake came out warm and moist and flavorful. I’m going to make a batch and give as gifts for the holidays! Thanks to the submitter of this recipe!

Yummy! But I did change it up a bit. I made it as muffins (for my daughters to have for breakfast) and I traded the raisins and walnuts for crushed pecans. I also changed the butter for 1/2 cup of oil and the applesauce for real apples. 
Yummy, healthy & Vegan!

Did not turn out well at all.  Texture was too gummy, even though it was thoroughly baked.  And the flavor was not appealing in the least.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I made it as listed , but added a crumbly topping to add on top of the batter. 2 TBS of butter, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1Tsp of vanilla, a couple of sprinkles of  any spice you like such as cinnamon or in my case pumpkin pie spice. Mix til crumbly and add to the top of the batter and bake as directed.
Your house will smell amazing!
Will make again.

I found the mixture a little too thick so I added extra applesauce (1 cup) and left out the walnuts. I used an 8X8 greased baking dish and baked on 350 for 43 minutes.The smell while it was baking was amazing. It baked up nicely. It raised as a cake should. It slightly crisped the edges. It was easy to transfer out of the pan and onto a cooling rack. it was nice and firm and easy to slice. It holds its shape well without a ton of crumbs from cutting it. The raisins plumped up perfectly. I used a dusting of powdered sugar to coat the top. I will make this again and again.

I made this cake today but I tweaked the recipe just a little. I added 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt. I used brown sugar and the cake came out beautiful and delicious. I will be making this again for sure. Thanks for sharing.

Moist and delicious!! I subbed allspice for the cloves, but I'm sure you could also just use 1 1/4 t. pumpkin pie spice.  I have added to my favorites and will be making often :)

I used to buy a spice cake loaf with buttercream frosting from the A & P. i haven't had it in years. this is extremely close - but only when it has time to settle a bit - make it in the morning and it's rich by evening, or leave overnight. The spicing is perfect and so is the amount of fruit and nuts. Excellent for a breakfast without the frosting or for  afternoon tea. Anytime really . thanks so much!

I had the cake complete before I realized there weren't eggs, and almost panicked. Certainly had trepidation. But it worked. The texture is great! I creamed butter and sugar, then gently stirred in applesauce, then the dry ingredients and raisins. The cinnamon and clove flavors are very pleasant. We wanted a go-to spice cake which is not too heavy, and this fits the bill.

Easy, moist and delicious.  It is similar to an apple  brunch cake recipe that I have, which also has a similar texture...don't judge the cake by the batter, and dont alter it until you've followed the recipe to a T first time around (except maybe skipping raisins and nuts).  The batter is thick, its ok without eggs, and follow the cooking time exactly (temp adjusted for your oven).  The cake was flavorful, moist and very good...and very easy to throw together.  (I did use homemade applesauce, that was made from fresh apples piccked last fall, no sugar, tart and full flavored, so perhaps that contributed to the full and very awesome flavor that I experienced with my end product).

Quick and easy, as promised. Moist and delicious, as well. Last minute budge issues created a birthday panic when we couldn't buy my daughter the cake she wanted. After looking at my available ingredients, I found this recipe. Daughter and I made it together and disaster was averted. She LOVED the cake. My other kids and grandkid only had positive reviews, as well. 

Thank you. This is my first applesauce cake and I'm kind of glad I had a budget fiasco.   :).   Making a cake with your daughter on her birthday is a really special treat, I think. 

She doesn't care for raisins so I left those out. No biggie and only alteration. Unless you count using cinnamon applesauce, which is what I had on hand. 

I'll make it again, for sure.

Made this yesterday. Always looking for new recipes to try out and this one doesn't disappoint! This turned out fantastic. Great easy recipe to keep on hand! The only thing I added was an extra cup of applesauce and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Took a little longer than 40 minutes to bake but I'm sure that had to do with the extra cup of applesauce. :)

This didn't work for me. Maybe because I used too much applesauce (24 oz. jar) and it didn't finish cooking in the middle (still batter) so I covered the dish with foil and put it back in the oven which did the trick but it came out sort of rubbery. The spices were great. I added allspice (1/4 tsp). Hubby didn't seem to mind but I expected something different. I'll give it another try using the recipes amount of applesauce and RE-review!!!!

Perfection !! I followed the recipe as is (isn't that the idea behind honest reviews) and this is my new favorite cake!! The spice level is spot on and it is a very moist cake.  I highly suggest waiting at least 12 hours or the next day before slicing into it, as today is very moist and heavenly and the raisins and walnuts made it even more divine!!

Easy to make. I had to bake it an extra 8 minutes to get it done. I also added a few chocolate chips for added flavor. We used butter frosting for additional sweetness. Very good. I will make it again.

This was such an easy recipe with great results! My family had seconds.  The texture is heavier than a cake, more like a moist bread or brownie but it worked  perfect with raisins and walnuts. I chose to use brown sugar instead of white. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Moist delicious cake. When I make it again I will reduce the rhubarb but will most likely add fresh strawberries with apples to add a hint of more sweetness.

I added an egg and it was delicious. If I had the right pan on hand, it would have been even better (more moist.). Not sure what chilling the applesauce meant. I didn't bother and it was still good.

Batter was too dry. I had to add a bit of milk, 1/4 more applesauce and two eggs. The finished product was still very dry.

I made two applesauce cakes this week using pears instead of apples. I had some I needed to use. Of the two recipes I made I liked this one the VERY best. Delicious. Yummy! I used the same amount of mashed pears as applesauce in the recipe. Used almond extract and extra pecans. Everyone raved about it.

Not bad. We made it when we needed a sweet that was mildly healthy. Added an extra 1\4 of a cup applesauce turned out great

I made this for a party because I had a lot of apples on hand to use up. It was very well-received and some people said it reminded them of pumpkin pie. That's great for me because my husband doesn't like pumpkins, so now I can use this recipe for fall time treats instead. The only thing is that it turned out more like a bread than a cake (not that I was surprised based on my modifications). It was delicious whether you want to call it a cake or bread!

Here are some of the modifications I made:

Used half the amount of sugar because my homemade applesauce was already quite sweetened.

Omitted walnuts and raisins because I don't really like them and I didn't have them on hand.

Baked in a bread pan, not 8 inch square pan, which probably contributed to its denser texture.

Topped with melted homemade caramel. You could probably melt store bought caramels and drizzle on top for a similar effect.

I made a double recipe and baked it in a large springform cake tin. I added 3 eggs and about half a cup of milk. I also used a cup of soft dates chopped in place of the sugar. It was divine! Hubby could not get enough! Will definitely make again.

This cake was good on the day I made it, but the flavors developed into amazing!! on the second day. Warning: If you like your cake light and fluffy, this one is not for you -- it's incredibly dense and moist. Please don't call it a "brick" when it's exactly the way it's supposed to be:)  I used about 1/2 the sugar called for, part of it brown, and I added some chopped granny smith apples. Couldn't be happier with the results!

This recipe is even better if you bake the batter in mini muffin tins and then toss the warm muffins with cinnamon and powdered sugar. Taste just like apple cider donuts!

This was an excellent cake!  I made it exactly as written and my husband and I loved it.  Next time I will add an extra 1/2 cup of walnuts because I just prefer more nuts, but it's excellent just as written too!

I used canola oil instead of butter - its all I had! I omitted raisins and walnuts, I did not want the texture. I also split the recipe and baked in a glass loaf pan for about 35 minutes. Wow! So moist and fluffy. This is a great, quick, easily modified, go-to recipe.

I read the reviews & looked at the pictures.  I saw that many commented on, & I could see by the pics, that this was very dense in texture.  So, I looked at my egg-less cake recipe to see if perhaps they added baking powder & yes, they did.  I added 3/4 tsp. of baking powder, cut the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. and I added 1/2 tsp. of salt since I used unsalted butter.  I had to cook it about 55 min. total (tested at 40 min. & every 5 minutes thereafter until toothpick came out clean) & it came out with the perfect texture.  I think I added about an extra 1/3 c. of applesauce also, but I didn't measure it exact (just used up what I had) &  It is very, very rich & delicious!  A definite keeper!!

Fabulous and Comforting!  I made this cake based on the reviews,  and am so glad that I did! (Disclaimer: I needed to use up some ingredients I had in the kitchen, so I made some substitutions!)  I used homemade pearsauce, and substituted 1/4  of almond flour, and 1/4 amounts of brown sugar respectively. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. The aroma from the kitchen was heavenly!  Afterwards,  I whipped up a maple butter confectioner's glaze. 
Such an amazing cake! So moist and yummy! I cannot wait to make it again as the recipe calls for,  as I will be sure to have all the ingredients on hand! Thanks for a great share.

Delicious. Made as a bundt, and without the nuts. Replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat so now it's "heathy" (ha). Freezes well and makes a wonderful breakfast.

This cake was excellent!  I did what other suggested with putting apple bits instead of raisins. I omitted the cloves (because I didn't have any).  I also used whole whet flour and mashed a banana instead of butter - so it was fruitier and healthier.  I was astounded at the results.  I will definitely make it again.

This is one of my favorite recipes. We make them as muffins. We take out the cloves, raisins and walnuts. I have also substituted 1/3 of the apple sauce for pumpkin.  I cook them for about 20min.

My kids love this I always lightly butter the top while its hot and lightly dust the top with powdered sugar.  It's so quick and easy to prepare.  They like it as a breakfast or a snack even works well as a dessert.  Just as good hot as it is cold.

Very easy snack cake. . . and it is delicious! I like the hearty texture. We enjoyed it with coffee last night and breakfast this morning. Recommend!  

I have an old applesauce cake recipe that uses a yellow cake mix and is made in a bundt pan. It is "fancier" than this one, but I honestly  prefer this cake.

I substituted canola oil for the margarine, and dried cranberries for the raisins, and this came our super. Now I am making it again,1 1/2 times the recipe to fit a 9x13" pan. It was gobbled up so fast that it didn't last until the weekend!

This is in my recipe box as "Pop-Pop's Applesauce Cake". My grandparents used to make this because my Pop-Pop had high cholesterol and this cake has no eggs. They used to make it with "Crisco" instead of butter, which actually contributed to the heart disease he died with. I've actually never made it with butter yet. I used melted coconut oil and it works great. Once it's baked, there is no coconut oil flavor. My recipe says to dissolve the baking soda in hot water and let it fizz, but it doesn't say how much water. I use 1/3 cup of hot water as I always thought this cake was a little dry. They always baked it in a 11x7 inch pan. I have doubled this in a 9x13 in. pan and frosted it with vanilla frosting also. This is a great old recipe in my family for many years.

I use half the ingredients and use all spice instead of cloves because I really don't care for cloves. Just what I was looking for and will make again.

This cake is fantastic. We added a bit more applesauce and used dried cherries, and it was moist and delicious.  Great way to use up all those fall apples.  Next time will make some whipped cream topping.

I made exactly as stated except I was out of raisins but had raisinettes. My hunny felt it had too much of a spiced tape. I used homemade applesauce that didn't have much spice in it to begin with. I may retry making it with raisins and less cinnamon and nutmeg.

I halved this recipe and baked into five cupcakes.  No nuts, raisins or cloves in the cupboard, so they were plain.  Baked at 350 for 22 minutes.  They were great!  Will do again.

Dense and chewy, and not in a good way. I used good strong homemade applesauce, but the apple flavor is overwhelmed by the cinnamon in this cake. If I make it again, I'll add an egg for the texture, cut the cinnamon in half, and use a pinch of nutmeg.

Very good cake!  I added a fresh chicken egg, & put it in a 9x13 glass pan.  (instead of a 8 inch square pan)  This cake came out very moist & yummy!  I will make this cake again & next time I plan to use homemade cream cheese frosting on it as well.  I think that kind of frosting would be really good on this cake!

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I added an egg by mistake and purposely added a tsp of vanilla extract instead of the cloves.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar as another reviewer suggested.  This cake didn't last one night. My husband ate more than half, and myself and the kids finished it off.  So moist and delicious.  Heck, even the batter tasted great. :)

We mow thru eggs, so it's nice to not have to use them in this.  And it's so quick and easy.  At the last minute before sticking it in the oven, I decided to give the batter a couple shakes of salt,and gave it another quick spin with the mixer.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It makes a good Sunday morning breakfast as we rush out the door for church.

Awesome cake even with my alterations. No cloves, so I added a dash more of cinnamon, and I used half brown sugar, half white. Since I only had half a cup of applesauce, I only made a half batch and baked it in a loaf pan for 21 minutes. Came out so delicious I momentarily considered eating the whole thing immediately. :)

Turned out fabulous, big hit with the hubby! Was surprised considering there is no egg in the recipe. I made the following substitutions: whole-wheat flour instead of white brown sugar instead of white no cloves

I made this cake using my own homemade applesauce (apples, cinnamon, vanilla, butter and brown sugar) which I made too much of and went in search of something to do with it.  I found this recipe and was skeptical about this cake not calling for eggs.  The batter is very thick and I was doubtful, but this cake came out surprisingly delicious and very moist. It rose nicely, too.  I used a bundt pan and ended up having to add an additional 20 minutes baking time.  Next time I will include the walnuts and raisins but even without, it turned out great! I wrapped half of this cake in aluminum foil and froze it, it still tastes great and is there for whenever unexpected company stops by.  This recipe is a keeper!!!!

My son loves this cake and has asked me to make it again twice since I originally tried it about a month ago! Instead of raisins (he doesn't like raisins) I added 1 whole apple finely chopped. Each time I make it I'm going to try other fruits and veggies in it. Thank you!

My grandfather used to make applesauce cake when I was a kid.  I don't have his recipe, so I tried this one...  Pretty close!  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, margarine instead of butter, and pecans instead of walnuts (since that's what I had).  Delicious!  Will make this again!

Absolutely delicious! Moist and easy to make - kept well too. It is heavy though. Used unsweetened applesauce and it worked out great! Topping (if wanted) should be thin and light. Will definitely make again (and have already given out the recipe to co-worker)

Okay, to be honest I haven't tried this particular recipe, but it is almost identical to the one I make all of the time.  Try making a hot sweet lemon sauce to drizzle over it with vanilla ice cream.  Heaven...simply heaven!  I will be trying this recipe the next time I make this yummy dessert!

This was a delicious cake! I loved it. It had just the right sweetness and had just enough nuts and raisins!
