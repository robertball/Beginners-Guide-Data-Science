I also left out the nuts cause I don't like them and these are wonderful.  I do have a little hint...if you like your cookies soft and fluffy, I use 1/2 baking powder and 1/2 baking soda.  They do not fall flat and they stay moist and chewy.  They are great this way.  I will always make my cookies with 1/2 soda and 1/2 powder.  Try it!!!

I love this recipe! I've actually made it twice now. Both times I had a little trouble with the consistency. I ended up adding only 2 cups of flour, and even still, it was pretty dry. So, I added the juice from the orange that I had zested which I would HIGHLY recommend, because it makes the orange flavor just a little stronger, and the dough a better consistency. I also used dark chocolate chips instead of white, and I'm a huge pecan fan, so I substituted the walnuts for pecans. Defiantly a new fave. Oh ya, under bake them just a little so that they come out chewy :)

WOW, are these good!!  I absolutely love them!  So good!  I had a little trouble getting the orange zest, but all I had were satsumas, and I take it they're not the best to zest, lol.  So I stopped after I had 1 teaspoon (that alone took over 10 minutes!) and just put 3/4 teaspoon of organic orange extract in the dough along with the zest.  My bag of white chocolate chips was 12 oz. which was a little over 2 cups, but I threw them all in anyways- I loooove white chocolate.  After the first batch was in the oven I remembered that some reviewers had said these cookies don't spread out at all, so I lightly flattened the rest with a fork and liked how those turned out better.  These have a perfect texture- I baked for 9 minutes.  I like that they don't have tons of sugar like some other recipes (although the white chocolate kind of makes up for that!).  I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and omitted the salt because I used salted butter.  White chocolate and orange are so scrumptious together.  These are sooo good and I think I might make them again for Christmas!

During the Christmas holidays I was persuaded to try this recipe by the enthusiastic reviews of my Cooking Friends--What A Dish!, Cookin'Mama,  LadyJayPee, IMVintage, and Tunisianswife, and I'm so glad I did--my family loved it. I used a combo of semi-sweet and the semi-sweet/white chocolate swirl chips and  finely chopped pecans. I also used 1/2 teaspoon orange extract, but I did not add orange zest (not a big fan!), and I added 1 teaspoon vanilla. The first time I made them, I used all butter, and the second time I used part butter/part shortening. I personally like the combo of butter and shortening in a cookie because I think shortening adds a little crispness. Great versatile recipe--on my keeper list!

These are wonderful with the delicate orange flavor. I made a few changes per other members advice. I like my cookies thick, soft, and chewy, so I used 1/2 tsp each baking soda and powder, made sure my butter was room temp, and packed the flour into the measuring cups. The latter ensures a slightly firmer dough that doesn't spread in the oven. And I did use only one cup chips...that was plenty for this small batch of cookies. (I got two dozen generously sized cookies.)

I enjoyed the flavour.  I have always loved the combination of orange and chocolate but I found that there was too much flour and the presentation was not pleasing (pale)so, I will make the following 
changes next time.  I will omit the white sugar and increase brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups, use the zest of a whole orange plus the juice of half the orange.  I will cut the flour to 2 cups, add a tespoon of ginger and use semi-sweet choc. chips (personal preference).   I also will baked at 375 F for 7-9 minutes for slightly crispier outer 'crust' while maintaining a chewy interior.

these cookies were easy to put together and were very flavorful.  My entire family of nine loved them.  My only suggestion would be to scale back on the white chocolate chips to half the amount called for.  So rich!  I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter.  They were soft, chewy, and gone in less than a few hours.

Very good, but I made the mistake of using orange peel spice instead of fresh orange peel/zest.  The orange taste was kind of funky.  I did add 1/4 tsp. orange extract, and would do that again.  I will definitely try this recipe again, but use fresh orange peel.  Thanks for the recipe!

If the cookie dough is any indication of how the finished product will turn out, I immediately knew these were going to be fantastic! Perfection in a cookie! I'm picky about the texture of cookies, and these delivered exactly what I was looking for. Some subtle changes I took with the recipe: added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, as I prefer a puffier, cake-like cookie. I added 3/4 tsp vanilla and more than a tablespoon of the grated orange zest. I added fewer chips than called for due to personal preference. Not too sweet, chewy on the outside, soft in the middle.... absolutely delicious. 3 1/2 year-old daughter (who helped me make these), and the hubby, could barely wait for these to cool before diving in! Next time, I will double, or even triple the recipe, as these cookies are impossible to resist. Thank you VERY much, Jennifer!

My girls made these. A bit of an event as my oldest doesn't do cooking. I just hovered in the background giving advice mainly on how to get the zest off an orange. They used about one and a half tbsp of zest as my youngest got a bit over enthusiastic and only a cup of white chocolate chips even they thought more would have been too much. They also left out the nuts as neither of them really like them. These were the best I'm not a cookie lover I normally just have one to see what they're like but I can't get enough of these. My girls say they'll be making them again next week. Thanks so much.

Very good! I left the walnuts out because my granddaughter doesn't like them but I think they would be GREAT with them. I used the zest from a whole medium orange and think I'll use two next time for more orange flavor. I also think I'll try them with half or even all chocolate chips. I really like the combination of orange and chocolate. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This recipe was recommended to me by another AR member and very good friend, Kez, and I'm so glad I tried them.  I didn't mess with the recipe at all and they came out great!  These were a big hit when I took them into work along with some other baked goods.  Thank you so much for the recipe, Jennifer.

SO GOOD!!!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, as that's what I had on hand.  I also did the half butter, half butter flavored shortening (I do this for all of my cookies, b/c I think it gives a better texture).

This is one awesome cookie!  I did not deviate from the recipe at all and it was perfect.  The buttery, orange flavor was point on and the walnuts gave it that extra oomphf!  Warning: highly addictive!!!

These were AMAZING. I made a few changes. I had no butter, so I used 1/2 c Crisco shortening and 2 T extra virgin coconut oil to add some crispness. Added a couple of capfuls of butter flavoring. I used 1/2 t each baking soda and powder, and added 2 little packets of True Orange, about 1/2 t of organic orange extract, and the zest of 2 small oranges for the orange flavoring. Whipped the shortening/oil/egg/sugars for about ten minutes. Decreased the nuts to 1/2 cup and the white chocolate chips to 1 cup.  I then added some more True Orange to a bit of sugar, wet the bottom of a glass, and pressed down on the cookies before baking, giving them a lovely orange-sugared topping. Baked for about 11 minutes. It made 42 cookies at about 120 calories apiece, for those who count calories.  They were INSANELY good!!!!! I cannot tell you how amazing these cookies were!

These were good!  Like Cookin'mama, I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour with good results.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  And like What a Dish!, I added pure orange extract (1/2 tsp).  I also used the zest from two satsuma oranges.   I divided the dough in half and used white chocolate chips (real ones) in half and mini-semisweet chocolate chips in the other, & used only half the amount of each (1/2c each).  Both were delish.  Thanks for the great cookie recipe, Jennifer!

Perfectly pretty, wonderfully delicious! I loved the orange undertones of the cookie - I don't think it's intended to be the prominent flavor, though, if you're a huge fan of the orange/choc combo, you could consider adding orange extract. BUT I wouldn't. :) I used macademia nuts, as I had them and thought they'd work very well with this recipe. A great new go-to recipe. What a gem!

I just finished baking these delicious cookies. After reading most of the comments, I decided to follow the recipe as is and taste after mixing them up.  For my taste I added the zest plus 1 t. orange extract and about 3 T orange juice.  As one viewer stated the dough was a bit dry and the juice made the difference and enhanced the flavor.  I have a convection oven so I baked these at 325 degrees for 10 or 11 minutes.  They turned out perfect! Thanks for sharing such great recipe!

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful.  I used fresh orange zest (the zest of one large orange), which turned out to be a little more than one tablespoon.  The orange flavor is wonderful with the white chocolate.  Highly recommend this cookie recipe for something elegant and melt-in-your-mouth.

I made these cookies as part of my annual Christmas cookie baking and loved them.  I used the zest from a fresh orange which is a definite must.  
I then changed the recipe a bit by reducing the white chips to 1 cup, reducing the walnuts to 3/4 of a cup and added a 3/4 cup of dried cranberries.
They were a huge hit and I've had several requests for the recipe.  They are now a part of my annual Christmas cookie line-up.

If there is a cookie hall of fame, this one should be in it. For a more intense orange flavor, added 2 Tbsp. orange juice concentrate. Based on reviewer’s comments, used 1/2 tsp. each baking soda and powder rather than 3/4 tsp. baking soda, and added a little more brown sugar than white. Fantastic cookies.

Who would have thought that orange and white chocolate would be such a good combination? This recipe delivered scrumptious cookies to the table. I received praise from all around for them. The orange taste/flavor was apparently just enough to be enjoyable and not overwhelming. Since I'm not a fan of nuts, I omitted that, which turned out to be a good thing since the amount of white chocolate chips was excessive already. Using less would be perfectly fine, especially for those who don't need that much sweetness. Perhaps cutting back on the butter would also be good since the dough was excessively greasy. Overall, this was a very simple recipe that yielded a delectable treat!

I combined a bunch of the suggestions and added my own twist and ended up with an orange-white chocolate pecan sandy.  I used half powder/half soda; packed the flour; used butter crisco; added both orange and vanilla extract; added the juice from the orange I zested; used pecans; and cut the chips in half.

What I did differently:  I refrigerated the dough for a while, rolled it into balls, rolled them in sugar, and flattened them before baking.  Mine took about 10-11 minutes to bake.  I melted the other cup of white chocolate chips, added orange zest, and vanilla and orange extract and drizzled it over the cookies.

I'm really happy with the results.  I think packing the flour allowed me to add the extra orange juice and not have the dough get runny.  The final result tastes like a very orange pecan sandy with white chocolate chips and the chocolate drizzle has a subtle orange and vanilla flavor to it as well.

As a quick note, after refrigerating and because of the flour my dough was slightly crumbly, but working it into balls in my hands solved that problem.

I normally don't like cookies that are not super moist and chewy, but these are wonderful.

Followed the recipe, but did add 1/2 tsp of orange extract to get a little bit more of the orange flavor.  I used a tablespoon cookie scoop, so they baked up all the same size.  This recipe produced delicious, very moist cookies that baked up beautifully.

Im giving these five stars because if I had followed the original recipe, thats what they would have been.  I followed other reviewers advice and added the juice from the orange.  While this did make the orange flavor stronger, this morning the cookies are a little too moisy- like falling apart.  Next time I might locate some orange extract and add that in addition to the zest.  I did add 1/2 t vanilla for another layer of flavor and I would keep this addition.  Overall, a really teriffic cookie!  Can wait to make them again and follow the directions. :)

These are yummy!  I didn't change anything really.  I was short a Tb of butter and added a Tbsp or 2 of water to help the batter soften a little after mixing.  The hint of orange was delicious and perfectly matched with the white chocolate chips and walnuts.  I did half the chocolate chips and this still seemed a lot for this recipe.  I would repeat based on the feedback I got from those that finished at work (:

Wow, these are excellent. A few of my husband's friends got ahold of these and they went nuts for them, which surprised me because I didn't think they'd go for the orange/white chocolate combo. I did increase the oranze zest by 1/2 a teaspoon or so; that made the orange flavor really stand out nicely. I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans. These would be a great addition to a holiday cookie tray. Thanks :)

My new favorite cookie; and translates beautifully to low carb subbing almond flour and coconut flour plus one tsp xanthum gum for all purpose flour and erythritol plus 1tsp liquid stevia for sugars. I also include orange zest and a bit of orange extract. Last night I threw in some craisins which I will do from now on...outstanding!

This is an awesome cookie!! The only thing I would change in the recipe is changing the orange zest to orange extract. I was able to taste the orange flavor more.

My fiancé is actually the one who chose the recipe as I was browsing through the site.  I printed it out, but I was hesitate to make it because it uses orange zest and I've never used it before. But he's been asking me when I was going to make it I decided to surprise him today when he got home.  I was really surpised when I tasted them--they are SO good!  The orange flavor is the perfect balance to the white chocolate chips.  My fiancé loves them and we almost spoiled our dinner because we couldn't stop eating them. (: he is taking the rest to work with him to munch on. I am writing this reviews for others of you who may be hesitating about making this recipe.  Try it, you won't regret it!  Defintely a new favorite, will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

These were really delicious. I was surprised at how well the orange flavor came through with just the zest. I left out the nuts so the kids could take them to school (due to allergies at school), but I can't wait to try making them with the nuts in!

My new favorite cookie! I read previous reviews and made the following modifications: reduced flour to 2 cups, used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp baking powder, used the zest of one medium orange (about 2 tbsp instead of 1 tbsp) and squeezed the juice from the orange in the the wet mixture and mixed before adding dry ingredients. I also cooked the cookies for 14 minutes. They came out a bit crisp with a nice orange scent and flavor.

Very nice, subtle orange flavor.  I only had 1 cup of white chips but next time I'll use about 1 1/2 cups to make them just a bit sweeter.  I also think I'll use 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening next time and see if they keep their shape a bit better.  Mine spread pretty bad and I'd like mine to look like that picture on the recipe!

I tried these cookies for the first time this year as part of our holiday cookies. They were easy, quick, and delicious. I made them with the white chocolate chips (used the whole bag) and also used 1 tsp of orange extract. YUM!

I do not like orange zest so I used 3 tsp of orange extract (I really wanted to taste the flavor) and I melted the butter before creaming it with the sugars. That's just a technique that I prefer. I also used both baking soda and powder for a fluffier cookie. Again just another technique I prefer. The dough is amazing, and these are some really yummy cookies! I will be making them again and again. The only downfall to this recipe is that it only made about 4 dozen and I'm sure I could've eaten MANY more! :) Oh yes, I also left out the nuts because I don't like them in cookies. :)

These went over really well at my club meeting and then at my husband's work (although one of my husband's co-workers said they were just awful - after the 5th one he started to feel sick!  ha ha!!!).
I omitted the walnuts (don't like nuts in cookies) and I substituted orange extract for the peel/zest.  They were a nice change and not dry at all. :)
I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I have had problems with them crumbling.  Anyone else have this problem?

These were interesting.  Good but a little odd.  Batter was very thick - I added about 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  They don't spread much at all when they cook but they do flatten out a little.  I would've called them 'orange creamsicle cookies'.  My husband said would've been better with regular chocolate instead of white chocolate.  My son liked them.  Not sure I'd make these again...

I bake cookies for our restaurant, and every Christmas I make up a lot of trays with a wide variety of cookies. This is one recipe that I make sure each tray contains. It has also become a favorite with my family.

These are delicious!  The light citrus taste really matched well with the white chocolate.  I reduced the white chocolate chips to 1 cup and increased the fresh orange zest to at least 1.5 tablespoons (I just used the zest of one medium orange) and they came out perfect.  You really have to use fresh orange zest for the best taste.  Next time I'll try it with butterscotch chips.

Very unique and flavorful cookie.  This has ALOT of white chocolate chips in it.  I might reduce the amount to 1 1/2 cups next time.  The orange taste is unexpected and fabulous.

What a great cookie!  Very easy to prepare.  They were very refreshing with the citrus flavor and would make a great spring dessert.  I shared them with the girls at the office and everyone loved them.

I just got done making these for Christmas, and we love them!  My family isn't crazy about walnuts so I used dried cranberries and WOW!  The 3 flavors play so well with each other.  This will be traditional cookie for sure.

Fantastic recipe. I didn't have enough white chocolate chips. I used 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips. I like bold flavors so I increased the orange peel to two tablespoons orange zest. This recipe has made the Christmas cookie list!

What a refreshingly delicious cookie! I think I'll try it with dark chocolate chips but I may have to increase the orange zest since the dark chocolate is a heavier flavor than the white. These are my new favorite cookies!

I added 1 tblspn freshly squeezed orange juice to batter. And used 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp baking soda.  Use all the white choc chips called for! So, so good.  Bake for 8 mins on convect bake setting.

I thought it was odd that vanilla was not one of the ingredients. I looked at the other reviews and saw a pattern of "dry cookies" comments. So I added a tiny bit of juice into the orange zest as recommended, and I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. I still used the amount of flour called for in the recipe. (I also substituted pecan pieces for walnuts). The cookies came out great and were not dry. I will definitely make these again!

I made as told except adding a little more orange zest then fold into the flour mixture and letting it sit for a bit to spread its flavor. I also use 1/2 soda and 1/2 powder for fluffy cookies and they turned out wonderful.  Will try with Lemon zest this summer time.  Thanks again.

These were tasty and very sweet.  I think that next time, I may just add half the amount of white chocolate chips so that more orange flavor comes through and they aren't so sweet (but that is just personal preference).  These were easty to make, too.

Excellent cookies. They don't spread out when baking so you need to kind of press them down a bit. I didn't have walnuts on hand so I used almond slices. The only thing negative (and this is a slight negative due to personal taste) is that the white chocolate was a too sweet for my taste. Next time I will put less chips in and probably use the mini size ones since I make my cookies more on the small side. Also, I like the orange flavor a lot so I will add more orange zest into the dough.

I personally like more orange flavor so next time I will add extra (I did add 1tsp of extract in addition to the zest). I also used 1/2 butter flavored shortening 1/2 butter. I made 1/2 the batch with nuts and half without. Good both ways.

These were great! I actually found them on a blog first called Orange Creamsicle cookies. The are really easy. You just need to make sure that you don't put too much flour because the don't last as long and they are more like a compact biscuit. I also waited till the end to put the orange zest in, and i did not put nuts in. I don't know why the pictures all look like that because my cookies looked way brighter and better. I guess I will have to submit my own picture or something.

I also add 1/2TB of orange flavoring to the dough along with the zest to get a more than subtle orange flavor. 95% of the people that have tried these have loved them.

My son came over and stuck his hand in the cookie jar, took one bite and said, GREAT cookie mom! Tastes like biscotti! I thought they had a biscotti taste an texture as well. I used a fully packed Tbsp. of orange zest along with 1 1/2 tsp. orange flavoring, omitted the walnuts and added about a cup of crasins with only a cup of white chocolate chips. I used only a scant 1/2 cup of white and a scant 1/2 cup of brown sugar and liked that these cookies were not overly sweet. I did also add about a 1/4 cup more flour to make the dough the consistency of chocolate chip cookies. And instead of 3/4 tsp. baking soda, I added 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/4 tsp. baking powder. The cookies didn't spread much so I flattened them out "slighlty". I made nice lage cookies and baked them for 15 minutes. They were not at all dry, but had a biscotti texture and taste to them. They were gone in a day and I am now making another batch. My son asked me to give the recipe to his wife, so I went out and bought her a citrus zester and attached the recipe. Great gift! Thanks for the recipe!

Nice twist on the standard "chip" cookie!  I made them with less sugar, as white chocolate is so sweet to begin with and I really wanted the orange zest to shine.  Also, I made them bite-sized ~ they are the perfect cookie to have with tea.  Delicious!

I have never reviewed a recipe and I cook from web recipe sites 100% of the time. These cookies are incredible. These will replace the chocolate chip cookie in my house! I followed the recipe to the T and I made sure that the orange zest was packed in my tablespoon because I love the flavor of orange in baking and cooking! Yummy Yummy!

These cookies are a delicious alternative to traditional chocolate chip cookies!  The only changes I made to the recipe were:  1)  I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, before I realized that it wasn't called for (oops!), and 2) I omitted the nuts.  I thought the orange flavor was exactly right--I would definitely taste a test batch before adding any extra flavoring.  The dough was quite thick--it was difficult to stir in the white chocolate chips, and the cookies didn't spread at all, so I would second the recommendation to flatten them before baking.  I baked them for only 8 minutes, and they turned out soft, moist, and chewy!

Delicious! My husband was not sure about the orange, but he loved the final product! Big hit in this house; I will definitely make these again. I did not have walnuts so used chopped pecans instead. I also think they would be good w/cranberries added.

The husband really liked these.  He is a big fan of white chocolate chips.  I thought the subtle orange flavor was very nice.  The only change I made was to squeeze half of the orange into the dough after zesting.

Fabulous!  This cookie is now my absoulte favoirite.  The texture and combination of flavors are delightful.  I did use a little more orange zest and also squeezed the juice from the piece of orange I was zesting into batter.(about a 1/4 of the orange)

I added three drops of orange oil to enhance the zest, gave cookies a great orange flavor.  I didn't realize I was low on white chips -- used one cup whitel, one cup chocolate.  I am a person that doesn't really like white chocolate, but in this recipe, I belive they fit the application better than regular choc. chips.   More subtle flavor with the orange with the white chips.   People liked them, but agreed they would be better with all white chips.

These are EXCELLENT!!  Wow, I loved this recipe!  I had some leftover white chocolate chips from Christmas time (the red & green swirly ones) and was looking for a cookie recipe to use them in.  So glad I chose this one.  I didn't have an entire T of orange zest, so I added a little bit of orange extract (didn't measure as I accidently spilled into the dough).  I will DEFINITELY be making these again.  The orange flavor with the sweetness of the white chips is so complimentary.

These are amazing! My parents loved them. I did what some other users did, when the dough got a bit too hard I softened it with a bit of orange juice. I also brushed the remaining orange juice over them when they were done. It made the orange flavor more obvious and kept them soft for days. Way better than your average chocolate chip cookie.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes. I have had this exact recipe for quite some time now, and everyone loves it. The only changes that I make in my recipe are as follows: Instead of orange zest I used grated orange peel (bought in a jar like regular spices). I use 2-3 teaspoons instead of just one. The orange flavor is quite a treat. I also use a whole 12-ounce package of white chocolate chips. 

As with all my cookies that I bake, I like them soft. To do this I usually take 45-60 seconds off of the bake time and let them cool on racks. This allows the cookies to harden, but not too hard. They are still soft enough to seem fresh from the oven.

Excellent.  I zested a whole orange and ended up with more than the recipe called for, but went ahead and threw it in.  I doubled the recipe but left out the nuts and left the amount of chips as-is.  Other than that, I didn't make any changes and everything turned out perfectly.  Curiously for me, my cookies did spread -- quite a bit -- but stayed soft as long as I pulled them out just as the edges were starting to brown.  A rather grown-up cookie, this one made people roll their eyes back into their head!

Usually I am happy with just a tiny sample of the cookies that I bake, but not this one; I love the delicate orange flavor of this cookie.  I used King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour (nobody had a clue!), milk chocolate chips, and flattened each cookie before I baked them. Fabulous!

Loved teh flavor of this cookie! I do think semi-sweet chocolate might be a tastier combo for my tastes so next time I will try that. I added a tsp of pure orange extract in addition to the orange zest & I subbed pecans for walnuts, to use what I had on hand. I had to cook mine for 15 minutes & they never spread out or flattened much. Be warned...if you try a bite of the raw dough, you wil be unable to stay out of it. ;o)

These cookies were very good, but next time will use more orange zest, because the orange flavor wasn't pronounced enough. I used 1.5 cups white chips and no nuts. I found them a little greasy and may cut some of the butter next time too. I will also try these with semisweet chocolate chips.

I liked the combination of flavors in this cookie.  The only complaint I have is that the cookies didn't stay soft for long enough, but then I am in a college apartment and they don't disappear as fast as they would with my family :)

Oh my, these are delicious! I love anything citrusy. I took a tip from someone and squeezed the orange into the batter for extra zip. My only complaint is they were a bit crumbly.

These cookies are incredible when made with macadamia nuts, so gave only 4 stars for original recipe. I  subbed 1 tsp orange extract for the zest because I had it on hand. The combination of the white chips, macadamia and orange flavours is so awesome! The cookies are soft inside and so good! A new favourite.

I do have a tiny bit of criticism....waaayyy too many white chocolate chips. I love me some white chocolate but holy cow these things had soooo many. It felt like I needed some batter with my chips! However they do taste wonderful!

This is a top rated Christmas cookie for my daughter and I
I love the orange zest and always end up putting an extra tsp in
Other than that, I don’t mess with this recipe at all
It’s just great and consistently good!

The best! 
 I make it 2-3 times a year(big batches) when our swimming club host meets and these have always been are winner. Crowds favorite! I Followed the recipe exact, just omit the nuts, because all baked goodies have to be nuts free and drizzled with little icing made out  of :powder sugar with few drops water and few drops fresh squeezed lemon juice and lemon zest .
FOR THE PEOPLE who say the dough is dry, I also had this issue before, but once I watched a video how to properly measure flour, and I realized I always add more than the recipe calls. Since I watched that video I have never had an issue with any recipe. Just google and find if you make the mistake I used to make and if you measure the flour properly.

I nice switch from the regular holiday cookie.  Turned out well, added a bit of the juiced orange.  Good but not my favorite cookie, though others liked it.

The first time I attempted this recipe was a little sweet, as I had put in too much white chocolate . The major change I did was instead of walnuts I used macadamia (The walnuts I buy always seem to have one in every 5 that tastes like plastic dipped in chemicals. nuff said) and it was delicious, mum can't get enough of them!

My friends request these cookies frequently.  Also found the dough can be dry so I squeeze a little bit of the orange juice -perfect solution! I also go a little easier on the chips.

These cookies were delicious! They had just a hint of orange flavor without being overpowering .  I left out the nuts and also reduced the amount of white chocolate chips.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and orange juice from the orange I zested. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. It was good but didn't taste much of the orange. Maybe orange extract would be better. I didn't have walnuts so didn't add it.  It was a good cookie. I'll make it again and add orange juice, walnuts and orange extract.

I was apprehensive about making these cookies. Not a big fan of orange but had the white chips to use. Boy was I surprised that they were just as good as the other reviews stated! Subtle orange flavor, not over powering. I made just like the recipe except I took suggestions from other reviewers to use 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and baking soda. The cookies are like a pecan sandy texture. Nice change from the ordinary chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Not difficult at all to make, and the cookie has a very nice texture.  Next time I'll add some orange extract to enhance the orange flavor; the orange taste was way too subtle as written.

yum! I did make a few changes, I wanted to go with lemon, instead of orange, so I added the zest of 1 lemon, and a bit of the juice. and used a good quality white chocolate bar, chopped, and some chopped Macadamia nuts. yum, yum!

Fabulous!   I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 substitutions. I had a lot of lemons on hand so I made a lemon version by replacing the orange zest with lemon zest.  I also used my favorite high quality, gluten-free all-purpose flour. These came out perfect, absolutely delicious.

Well, we just made these as per the recipe with the exception of leaving out the nuts.  They were a bit dry and crumbly, but they tasted good.  I'll have to try a different recipe next time or perhaps add more butter...

These were wonderful! I did follow the suggestion to use 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking powder. The cookies were nice and fluffy. Also, I didn't have fresh zest, so I used 2 TBS of jarred orange peel. The cookies have a nice orangey flavor that's not overpowering. These are definitely becoming part of my cookie recipe collection!

These are nice cookies.  the orange really doesn't pop even though I added a splash of oj.  I also did half white choc chips and half regular choc chips--white choc chips are just too sweet for me.  I liked the difference it made in these.  Overall, a nice little cookie although I wouldv'e liked a bit more orange flavor.  thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are FAB!  i add a fair amount of orange extract, since i like a really citrusy taste.  but otherwise, they're melt in your mouth good!

So good! If you like white choc, you'll love these. I had no trouble zesting the orange; just use a box grater and rub the orange on the side. I made one change, using 3/4 c brown sugar and only 1/4 c white sugar (my husband and I prefer the "blondie" taste of more brown sugar.) Also left out the nuts. These are like heaven just out of the oven!

Oh, man are these good!  I doubled everything EXCEPT the zest and white chocolate.  I cut up a 12oz bar of Ghirardelli and that was all it needed.  As other reviewers suggested, I used half baking soda and half baking powder because I like soft cookies and I also threw in the juice of the orange I zested.  Because I am making these for a 'fancier' occasion I am going to drizzle them with white chocolate (if there are any left!  Hubby has been citing 'quality control' issues and has eaten about 5 of them already.  I've never seen him eat more than 2 at a time, so that in itself is a great testament to this recipe!)

Loved the flavor of this. If you like Terry's chocolate orange you will really love these. I also omitted the nuts and 9 minutes is plenty of baking time.

Yum!! Would have given it 100 stars! I've made 2 batches this week! I don't like nuts so I left the walnuts out of this recipe and used some chopped up dried cherries instead for half of the batch. Very tasty. I also used the juice of the orange that I zested and it came out delicious!

These cookies were wonderful! i took the advice from another reviewer and added the juice of the orange (i didn't have nearly enough zest) and they turned out great! i also did 1/2 with white chocolate and 1/2 with dark chocolate- my family liked the dark chocolate better but i personally enjoyed them both =) and i'm not a walnut fan so i did't include those... i thought these cookies were pretty sweet but very tasty =) they were a hit! thank u!

these are perfection.  I added the juice of 1 orange and an extra 1/4c. of flour (my mom says it makes drop cookies rise more and I've got to listen to mom!) in addition to some vanilla and orange extract.  I also used milk chocolate chips and pecans.  I usually wait for feedback from my family and friends before I rate recipes but they are 5-star cookie, no doubt.  if you like chocolate and citrus, make these tonight!  thanks so much for the recipe.

Not a hit with my little son, unfotunately, but that's all right - it leaves more for me!  I ended up using a touch more butter than the recipe originally calls for and the juice of half an orange, as the dough was a little crumby for my taste.  They turned out great, though!

What a fantastic recipe/combination of flavors!  I added orange extract, left out the nuts, and added both white and milk chocolate chips to the batter.  YUM!

NOTE--I was pressed for time, and made these into cookie bars, instead.  I used a 9" x 10" rectangular pan, baked for 30 min and they came out wonderfully.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made these last night because my husband loves anything orange flavored. The taste was really good, but the consistency was a bit dry for my taste. I only used 2 cups of flour, added a little vanilla for taste (since I was a bit short on brown sugar) and added 1/4 tsp orage extract. I also only used 1 1/4 c w.choc. chips since that was all that was left in the bag and I could not see how you could use any more - there were about 20 chips per cookie! I would love to figure out how to make this cookie a bit moister.

I made a few changes & this still came out very tasty.  I had Dove Organic orange dark chocolate that I didn't care for at all.  I decided to hunt for a recipe that uses orange.  This looked good.  I chopped up the chocolate bars in place of the white & used applesauce instead of butter.  I also added cranberries.  I wouldn't recommend using applesauce because they came out a little flat & needed to cook about 13 min.  BUT with all my changes this still was very good.  Oh, & Organic orange chocolate is good, it's the Dove that was bad, it really isn't 100% organic & you can tell.

Great recipe! I love the orange flavor with the white chocolate and I think it is a sexy adult cookie.  Kids may not like it, but c'mon -- they have enough cookies of their own! :)  Included this in my Christmas cookie baskets and people loved them.

great recipe!  Such a nice change of pace for a chip cookie.  Didn't have white chips so subbed choc. chips and loved the chocolate/orange combo.  Only addition was 1 tsp. vanilla.  This is a crisp on the edges/chewy on the inside cookie; much like Tollhouse texture.  Thanks for the picture, as it represented the thickness and shape achieved.

Oh my gosh I love these!  The orange compliments the white chocolate perfectly!  I didn't make any changes to this recipe, but it sure calls for some cranberries in this.  So I will add some next time.  5 stars isn't enough for this recipe, it should get 10!!

mmm! these turned out fantastic! I reduced the white chocolate chips to one cup and it was plenty! I also used 1 1/2 Tbls. zest plus 1 Tbls. orange juice for lots of orangey goodness. I got 34 good-sized, soft, delicious, orangey cookies from this recipe.  they're almost cakey in texture ... really good.  also, i was almost put off the recipe by people saying they tasted like creamsicles cuz i HATE creamsicles, but i love orange cookies and wanted to try it anyway.  and i just want to report (for anyone else who hates creamsicles) that these taste NOTHING like creamsicles to me, so don't fear!  they kind of remind me of the hostess orange cupcakes ... super delish!

Pretty tasty...mine didnt flatten at all and I wound up with cookie balls(I used a cookie scoop)they looked pretty enough but I was expecting a flat cookie. The only thing different was I probably only used 3/4c white chips because I didnt realize I only had a partial bag. I will make these again and use more chips(probably not the whole 2 cups the recipe calls for) and definitley more zest or orange extract.

Pretty interesting recipe; definitely for subtle adult tastes. My five-year-old wasn't impressed. I used chopped pecans, and reduced the chips by 25%. Not my favorite, but I will make this again to add variety to my holiday offerings.

These were quite nice and worth giving a go.  I didn't have white choc chips, so used couverture instead and it was lovely.  I also added a little extra zest, as there didn't seem to be enough for my liking in the recipe.  I don't think they were the best cookies I've ever tasted, but I'll probably make them again as something different.

Great cookie recipe. It's the best one I've tried so far. I used dark chocolate instead of white and omitted the walnuts. The texture is similar to shortbread and the cookie isn't too sweet or soft. Thanks for the recipe!!

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips (personal preference), and extra orange zest.  The batter was a tiny bit dry in the mixer, so I also squeezed some orange juice in while it was mixing.  The flavor of these is great...the only other change I'd make is to add a little bit more sugar.
