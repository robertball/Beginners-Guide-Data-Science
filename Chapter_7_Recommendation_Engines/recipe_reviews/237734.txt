On a recent "all about me" page that my son brought home from school, this is what he listed as his favorite food! It is delicious and fun to eat. I do reduce the amount of ground beef used, as it can get almost too thick for dipping.

I made this for a fondue party and it was a hit. Barely had any left overs to bring home. I did put about half the meat the recipe asked for like one of the previous reviews mentioned to make it a little more dipable.
