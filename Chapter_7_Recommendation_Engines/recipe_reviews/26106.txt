This doesn't taste like it's good for you! I added about 3/4c. raisins, and substituted the margarine with 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and used applesauce for the apples.  Increased the cinnamon to a fat teaspoon, and added a pinch nutmeg,ginger, and cloves. This will be our new favorite cookie!

Taste absolutely amazing, but I had to make small changes: I added .5 C of brown sugar for extra sweetness, which I think was necessary after tasting them. I also had to add more flour after my first batch came out somewhat flat and near impossible to take off of the cookie sheet. I'd increase flour to at least 1 1/4 C. Also, a tip is leave them out of an air-tight container at least for the first night. I put mine in after they were out for about an hour, and they were somewhat pancake-like in "crispness" the next day. It didn't affect the flavour, I just prefer crispier cookies. Beyond those small changes, these were FANTASTIC, like a healthy bowl of apple cinnamon oatmeal inside a cookie. The house smelled great while they were cooking, too.

These make great snacks for kids... wholesome ingredients and NO refined sugars.  I added 1 large ripe mashed banana into the wet ingredients to increase sweetness.  I also used applesauce instead of chopped apples because my boys still have problems eating things with lots of texture.  I also would recommend increasing the cinnamon to one full teaspoon.  Making them this way, I came out with slightly less than 4 dozen, and the cookies were somewhat cakelike.  They were yummy and my toddlers ate them up!

These cookies have great texture, but all that honey doesn't make them sweet.  Add a half-cup of brown sugar to make them delicious!
Also, these were FAR too small; use bigger drops than 1 tsp.!

Thank you, I have been looking for a recipe like this; all-natural sweeteners, all food ingredients, something I can eat when hungry without feeling guilty or ill. 
I made a couple changes: I creamed 2/3 c applesauce in with the wet ingredients in place of the chopped apple to save work. I also used 1 c rolled oats and 1/2 c quick oats instead of all quick oats. I also used real butter in place of margarine.
These are VERY good and are quickly becoming my lunch. I'm going to bake a ton of them and put them in the freezer for quick snacks and breakfasts.

P.S. The cookies are very moist when made with 2/3 c applesauce and might fall apart easily when being removed from the cookie sheet. I used parchment paper underneath the cookies in place of greasing the sheets, so I didn't have this problem. I just slid the paper off the cookie sheets on to the counter to cool after allowing them to cool on the sheets for five minutes. They are a hold-in-the-hand cookie instead of a hold-by-the-edge cookie.

Thank you for this recipe!  I prefer to only use natural sugar and whole wheat flour, so I was excited to try these cookies.  I don't use margarine (I'd recommend using butter instead as there is nothing natural about margarine) and we have dairy and egg allergies in the family, so I replaced the margarine with the same amount of unsweetened applesauce and used 1/2 a mashed banana for the egg.  I also didn't feel like cutting up an apple, so I used 1/2 cup raisins.  I love the way they came out: moist, chewy, just the right of sweetness, and all wholesome ingredients!  My two year old and I gobbled them up!  In fact, my biggest problem was not eating all the cookies in one sitting.  They're so small; it's easy to have just one more!  I'm looking forward to experimenting with this recipe and will definitely try with the apples.  Yum!

Good recipe! I tweaked it a bit -- added 1/2 cup brown sugar for sweetness, 1/4 cup flour (used white instead of wheat flour) to thicken a little, 1/2 teas. cinnamon for more flavor, 1/2 cup craisins, and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Excellent!

These were all right cookies. The texture reminded me more of a spongy cake than of a cookie. Also, I would suggest shredding or mincing the apples as "chopping" did not make them small enough for them to be evenly distributed in the dough.

These cookies are an excellent healthy alternative!  They were very simple to make, and they stay very moist even after several days.

Very moist & chewy...and very easy to make.  I used 1/2 cup of chunky apple sauce instead of margarine.  This made me feel so good about eating them because every ingredient was healthy.   Ya gotta love that.  I used a tablespoon portion for each cookie and ended up cooking them for about 17 minutes instead of the recommended 10 minutes.  (due to portion sizes).  Will absolutely make again, however I would increase the cinnamon by a teaspoon or so, add a pinch of brown sugar...and I would love to try adding dried cranberries...I think they would be really, REALLY delicious !  I'll let you know how they turn out.  Thanks for the recipe....Very wholesome & tasty !

I used this recipe as a basic format but made  few changes.  They turned out wonderfully delicious and (thanks to the brown sugar) very caramel-y.  
Changes:
Almost 3/4 c brown sugar instead of honey, old fashioned oats, butter instead of margarine.

These had a really good flavor. They were more like muffins than cookies, but still really good. I want to make them again and maybe add raisins or chocolate chips.

This produces cookies of an unpleasant dry texture, which are not sweet enough, and lack that chewy element that oatmeal cookies are supposed to have. I'd never make is again.

Made these according to recipe and they were okay... way too small, that's why the calories were so low. Also, in reading the previous reviews, I am wondering why people think margarine is healthy? I would make them again, but would add brown sugar, a bit of vanilla, applesauce, and maybe apple pie spice...

Cut the apples VERY small... and don't use too many. More is definately not better in this case. Otherwise, this is a very excellent recipe!

Yum! Used flax seed as an egg replacer, dairy-free choc chips instead of apples and a dash of salt - HUGE hit with my little girls! A nice, healthier-than-average cookie! Also great for my daughter with multiple food allergies! Very soft, not overly sweet.

I tweaked it a little and put half butter (instead of margarine) and half applesauce and also added more applesauce instead of the chopped apple, I also added little bit of brown sugar and some stevia! My toddler loved them! so much cheaper than buying the healthy cookies at the store! can't wait to make different versions!

Almost followed the recipe with the exception of substituting butter for margarine and using a little less cinnamon, but adding some nutmeg and ginger. Also made them bigger, as my yield was 32. Loved the flavors and the textures, but would definitely recommend dicing or mincing the apple as chopped pieces were bigger than I liked. Definitely a cakey cookie, more like a bar.Might try adding some chopped walnuts to give it a little protein, then, call it breakfast! Think I will also substitute some of the butter for applesauce. Less guilt, more enjoyment! Can't wait to try these with my spiced tea.

Great cake like cookie.  I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and used applesauce instead of the apple and increased flour to 1 cup.  Also used 1 tablespoon of batter instead of a teaspoon.  They taste just like muffin tops!

I just made these cookies and they are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but didn't have margarine so I used butter instead. After they came out of the oven my 3 year old and I sat and ate a bunch of them. She couldn't get enough of them, and I don't feel guilty for giving them to her. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I have been on a mission to make the perfect healthy cookie and this is a step in the right direction. I used this recipe as a base and made several changes: 1. Butter, not margarine. 2. 1/4 tsp of almond extract along with the vanilla. 3. Used oat flour in place of whole wheat (about 1 1/4 cups) and added some ground flax seed (about 1/4 cup). 4. Added 1/2 tsp salt (this is essential and missing from the original recipe), 1/4 tsp Nutmeg and 1/2 tsp Ginger along with the Cinnamon (wich I upped to a full tsp). 5. Used closer to 2 cups of oats (old fastioned - not the quick cooking type) 6. Instead of apples I put in about 1 1/2 cups of a raw organic energy mix (seeds/nuts/raisins/crans). Holy cow! This cookie tastes amazing! Slightly cumbly but I think this has to do with the flour. I can't wait to try this with the apples too! This is a cookie you won't feel guilty about eating.

When made as written, these cookies don't have a lot of flavor.  I added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg to the second batch and it didn't help much. They are soft and pretty much like eating a bowl of oatmeal you can hold in your hand. 
I really like the healthy idea of recipe, especially where some reviewers suggested using applesauce instead of margarine,  so I am planning playing around with it to see if I can add some flavor to these things.

Or they stuck to the pan and were impossible to eat as a cohesive cookie....more like a plate of crumbs. tasty crumbs... definitely but they did not work. I suggest looking for a rewritten recipe of this. 

Because overall it was yummy and honey was a great healthy substitute for flavor.. but just a lot of mess even if you use a lot of PAM.

These cookies were great.  They turned out more like soft granola bar plumps of joy.  I made them semi-vegan though.  Kept the honey (not vegan), used Earth Balance butter (vegan), and subsituted 1/2 cup applesauce instead of egg in one batch and a really really ripe banana in the other batch (instead of egg).  I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to them which was great.  I also added a little more than 1 1/2 cups of oats because my batter was a little runny.  And another half of an apple bc my apples were small.  A few additions and changes but I plan on making them all the time!!

The dough is yummy, but once you bake it it's not as yummy.  They spread out too much and don't rise.  They looki like they should be crisp, but they're chewy.  I'm very disappointed by this recipe.

Thanks for this excellent recipe. They're so good I snack on them all day long! I did make a couple of small changes though to cut back on the calories and fat and make a little healthier - I substituted the margarine for 1.5 cups of apple sauce and I substituted the 1/2 cup of honey for 1/4 cup of Splenda brown sugar. Enjoy!

FANTASTIC. To make it a five star recipe though I made a few adjustments. I added about a 1/4 to a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Threw in some extra cinnamon. Used brown sugar in place of honey because I didn't have any. And, I used chopped dried apples that I had in my pantry rather than fresh. Also, used 1/4 c. real butter rather than margarine and mixed 1 packet of instant apple cinnamon oatmeal in with the oats called for. If I were to make this again I would DOUBLE the recipe. For a healthy cookie you CANNOT beat these. Delish!

I doubled the size of each cookie, and added raisins.  I found them a bit too cakey and will reduce the amount of flour and increase the oats next time.

I'm sorry, but these were terrible. I followed other people's suggestions and substituted the applesauce for the margarine, plus added raisins and brown sugar. They didn't ever leave the "ball" shape and tasted terrible.

Can't get them through the oven quick enough! My 3 kids (8 yr, 5 yr, 2 yr) are eating all the cookies from one tray before the next one is out of the oven! Definite hit!  After reading the other reviews, I was tempted to add brown sugar but I am glad I didn't. I don't think they NEED it.  Brown sugar may make them slightly better but my kids gobbled them up without so why add it if not completely necessary!

These are fabulous!  The only thing I did different was to increase the cinnamon from 3/4 t to 1 full teaspoon and added a dash of nutmug.  My entire family (including the picky kids loved them)!  I used a Fuji Apple diced fairly small.  It is cake like, but that's one of things I love about them!  A wonderful healthy snack without all the refined sugars!  I will be making this regularly!

very good! I adjusted a few things as in other reviewer's suggested like I used butter, grated the apples and used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of honey.  I also used 3/4 oatmeal and 3/4 crushed cornflakes.  Also, a dash of nutmeg. Turned out yummy!

If you are looking for a healthy, soft, very muffin-like "cookie", these are definitely worth a try, quick and easy to make...  

After reading reviews, I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the margarine, added 1/4 cup of ground flax for health benefits, 1/4 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut (for added texture).  I used 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon (instead of 1/4 teaspoon), 2/3 cup of applesauce (instead of the 1 apple chopped).  Also added additional spices: pinch or so of each nutmeg, ginger and cloves and added some dark chocolate chips.  I will definitely make these healthy snacks again.

While these were tasty I would say they were more like a muffin rather than a cookie. I, like others, added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2cup brown sugar and they were delicious!

I just took these out of the oven & ate one. I don't know why anyone would add extra sugar to these, they are plenty sweet enough. I too replaced the margarine with applesauce. I added a handful of cranberries but I had to add an extra cup of dry ingredients to get rid of the soupy consistency. I had to bake mine for 25 minutes before they started browning. All in all a guilt free treat that I have no problem feeding to my 10 year old diabetic child.  thanks

These are so delicious! We put up our fall decorations and these went perfect with festivities. Great hearty texture, flavor and healthy for my family. I did a 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c splenda instead of honey. Since I was out of honey. Loved them.

This is a cake-y, moist cookie with a delicate honey taste (used a mild, clover honey) - not very sweet.  I cut a large apple just smaller than chocolate chip size, and there was barely enough dough to bind everything together.  The addition of ground cloves, ginger, and nutmeg to my second batch was nice.  My cookies were just over 1 Tbsp. big, yielding 3 dozen, and baked in about 8 minutes.  The kitchen smelled so good!  On an absolute scale of cookies, it's a 3 1/2 star recipe (I'd like cookies to be crisper and more caramelized).  As a healthy, naturally sweetened snack, it's really yummy.

I just made these again, and confirmed that they are really good.  I just made two minor modifications - I grated the apple and added 1/4 c. brown sugar.  My kids and I all love them and they are far more healthy than most cookies.

I can't believe it but these were actually really good.  I was looking for something to make my Uncle who just got out of the hospital from heart problems.  These were low in cholesterol and sodium.  And they taste great!  I didn't make any changes because I wanted to see how the recipe turned out.  The only thing I might do next time is add a little more cinnamon and MAYBE a handful of brown sugar to add a little more sweetness.  But for how healthy they are, they were an awesome cookie!

very healthy and inobtrusively so; a pity only hubby an I did appreciate. My kids were not impressed. I'll keep this recipe anyway, because this cookie is basically good and can stay very moist for some days. Some may like it sweeter, but I think it's ok.

These are good.  I put raisins in as other suggested.  I think I may have gone over board on the apple (I used two small).  These were very moist cookies.  I think next time I'll make them with nuts...I just felt like they were missing something...and I think that its nuts.

The second time I made this, I made it exactly per recipe (except for using butter instead of margarine) and they came out perfect. Delicately sweet, appley, good to adults and my preschoolers.

The first time I made it, I subbed half-brown sugar with half-honey because I was short on the honey. Texture was fine, but I experimented with the second half of the dough to see if I'd like it sweeter - added a little extra brown sugar - and then they didn't hold together well. 

Will stick to the recipe from now on!

Was happy to find a good healthy recipe for oatmeal cookies. We decided they're more like "muffin tops" than cookies, and they taste pretty good. We left them out overnight which helped them firm up - right after they're cooked they're too mushy to pick up and eat like a regular cookie. We liked the amount of sweetness - not overly sweet like most recipes. Used butter instead of margarine, and added craisins and dried currants. I made them way too big - next time I'll make them teaspoon size. I would make this recipe again.

Following the lead of a few other reviewers, I used applesauce in place of the butter to make these more healthy. Don't. They needed the butter for taste. I don't know if the butter would have helped the texture or not, but they were extremely spongy.

This recipe was wonderful. Whoever said they were dry must have not followed the directions! They were extremely moist and chewy. I added about 2 extra teaspoons of honey, and also substituted butter for margerine. I recommend this to everybody. It's awesome!

Everyone loved these cookies.  When the oven buzzer went off after each tray load, my parents, brother, sister, and boyfriend came running to eat them up.  I honestly couldn't keep up, and now I'm making them again tonight.  Thanks for this great yummy recipe.

These cookies were quite good and my family ate them up pretty quick! Loved the honey instead of sugar. Although next time I would add pumpkin spice for just a bit more of a fall taste and perhaps add some raisins.

I loved this recipe, although I did change it a little to fit my tastes. I replaced the margarine with unsweetened applesauce like my fellow reviewer had done. The dough seemed really wet, so I did throw in some more oats (about 2 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups). Also, I'm not a fan of chopped apples so I mixed in 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. It came out just the way I wanted it to!

As some previous reviewers mentioned, these really are more like muffin tops than cookies.  However, they're fabulous!  My husband gobbled them right up.  I did add 1/4 cup of brown sugar and almost doubled the cinnamon... however, that's a personal preference.  Either way, they're delicious.

OK I take some of the blame that is why there are 2 stars for the good idea...I used raspberry flavored applesauce thinking that might help with the blandness and put a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon(its good for no need to skimp)still so very bland.  They were so dry they got stuck on the way down! This maybe from skipping the butter...but they didn't' even flatten out at all they stayed the shape I put them in the oven?

Was a little disappointed they didn't come out more like traditionally oatmeal cookies but they were still tasty. After the first dozen I switched to making them muffins instead of cookies and they make great muffins! The only thing I changed was using unsalted butter instead of margarine. If you like them a little sweeter you can put a small amount of sugar in them in addition to the honey. I made the second batch with about an eighth of a cup of white sugar in addition to the honey and they were noticeably sweeter without busting the belt line. I will not make them as cookies again but will definitely make them as muffins again as snacks or breakfast muffins. Very hearty and tasty!

So my kids loved them, ages 3 to 13.  I thought they were good but need a little more???  I love the fact the ingredients are healthy, and I also substituted the butter for unsweetened applesauce.  I will make these again, only next time I am chopping the apples tinier, so they are distributed better, and am going to bump cinnamon up to 1 tsp..

Love it!  I substituted applesauce for the butter.  This has to be one of the healthiest cookie recipes I've seen and my preschoolers love them.  We'll definitely make them again (soon) and might even try turning them into muffins.  An excellent soft cookie recipe with no sugar and no fats.

This is a tasty cookie and I don't even have a problem letting the kids have a couple for breakfast.  I added some toasted walnuts and although I chopped the apples this time, I would shred them like other reviewers have mentioned.  The sweetness was perfect for our household!

They are great!!! I added some ingredients though....1/4 additional flour (used all purpose), more cinnamon (I love cinammon, so I didn't measure the amount), 1/4 cup Brown Sugar, 1/2 cup Dried Cranberries and a little bit of salt...they were delicious!! Thanks!!

Best Healthy cookie recipe I've found, my husband and I love these and eat them as our "guilt free" cookies.  I sometimes make these for my kids but substitute the apple for chocolate chips (I know not as healthy but if they are eating whole wheat flower and oats its probably better than most breakfast cereal)!

So good! And they smell wonderful while baking. Instead of apple, I used 1 ripe banana (mashed) and I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the recipe. Also, since I don't have quick oats I used 4 packets of instant "brown sugar and maple" oatmeal, which I think helped the flavor. Their consistency is like that of banana bread, so they're more like muffin tops than cookies. I've been heating these up in the microwave and eating them with breakfast every morning. Will definitely be making again!

I used a pecan flavored syrup instead of honey.  Then I added a 1/2 cup of pecan pieces and butterscotch chips.  I also used butter because it gives the cookie a better flavor.  I will make these again. They are very moist, too.

Literally JUST printed this out, prepared it and served it to a potential Miss America Contestant. Seriously! Didn't have any whole eggs, so I subbed egg whites (which I'm sure is fine with her! :D) and they still turned out wonderfully. Moist, soft, and cakelike, a perfect late summer treat with some of the first and best apples of the season!

I made these tonight and they are excellent.  I found a couple apples in the fridge and wanted to make something with them.  Found this recipe and it was a huge hit.  My son actually said they were better than my regular chocolate chip cookies.  I like that there's no sugar, just the honey & apples. Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper for me. I will make more to take to work where everyone is very health conscious.

I made these with applesauce instead of margerine and maple syrup instead of honey and added raisins.  They turned out yummy!  The texture is kind of spongy and more like bread or a muffin than a cookie, but they are still really good!

Delicious! Will def make again. I increased the flour to 1 cup and also added brown sugar. They are cake like but very yummy. Make sure you grease the pan well.....they tend to stick. I could eat the entire batch. Oh and I added raisins too

This is a great cookie for kids' afternoon snack.  I added a bit of extra brown sugar and all the kids enjoyed these.  Everyone agreed that they had a mufin-like texture.  They stayed soft the next day.

I had a couple of spare apples, and liked this recipe. After reading some of the other reviews I added a bit of light brown sugar, and slightly more flour. I also used tablespoons rather than teaspoons to spoon out the mixture. The cookies came out very moist. The consistency was too cake like for my preference, but on the other hand my mum loved them. I agree that the oatmeal works very nicely with the apple.

These were good! I will say, though, margarine is AWFUL for you!  I substituted with butter (fat, yes -but at least it's truly natural). Next time I'd like to try the applesauce suggestion.

I made a few changes and have had trouble keeping these in the house.  Double the cinnamon (I love cinnamon), add 1/2 cup brown sugar as other people suggested, I used multi-grain flour, real maple syrup instead of honey because I ran out (add a bit more flour if you use syrup), and chop the apples really small so they distribute well. I used a Macintosh which kept its shape in the cookie and had a nice tart flavour.  My mom made this recipe using a Gala apple and they disappeared in the baking process which made for a not pleasing result.

I followed the advice of some other reviews and added 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, shredded the apple, and used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup agave syrup for the sweetner. The taste came out great, I loved that, but the cookies themselves came out flat as pancakes and so soft that they fell apart. I turned down the oven to 325F and it made them rise a little but they were still pretty flat. They were spongy and soft, so I would make them again as muffins.

These taste great considering they don't have any sugar in them.  If you are craving something sweet, this is not it.  I used real butter, added raisins, and added a little nutmed and ginger.

This is a good recipe, but not a sweet tooth's favorite.  I took previous reviewers' advice and added some brown sugar, some raisins, a bit extra cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and another quarter cup of oats.  Then for lack of time, I baked them in a 9x13 pan as bars.  They were definitely tasty, and were perfect for my situation because they were so quick and easy to make, with simple ingredients I had on hand.  But this goes in the "in a pinch" category, not in the "all-time favorites, everyone-asks-for-the-recipe" category.

Great cookie! I have a sweet tooth so I took the suggestions and added brown sugar (about a 1/2 cup). Also added a little more oatmeal (about 1/4-1/2 cup), and added extra apple. My husband was looking for something semi-healthy to snack on during work, and I think this hit the spot! Thanks!

The cookies were very bland.  Not inedible, but definitely not for someone with a sweet tooth like mine.  I think I'll try adding brown sugar next time and see if they're any better.

Wonderful cookies! The smell is great, and the cookies are chewy and moist after they cooled. A real keeper.

I really liked this recipe. I enjoy making recipes I feel are healthier for my family. I, too, substituted applesauce for the margarine. I also added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, to please the kids. They gobbled them up.

Overall this was pretty good.  I did tweak it here and there and it lasted about 10 minutes with the kids in my home day care.  I used regular butter not margarine, added 1/4 brown sugar, used 3/4 c. of oats and 3/4 crisp rice cereal.  I also added a handful of mini chocolate chips and 1/4 wheat germ.  Rather than an apple I used a little cup of applesauce.  I cooked them on a cookie stone, so no need to grease the pans.  I mixed all the dry ing. in 1 bowl and the wet ones in another, then conmined them.  I dropped teaspoonfulls onto the pan and baked around 13-14 minutes.  They are a bit more like a cake type cookie and they are not super sweet.  They do not spread out much so you can fit a lot on one sheet.  Perfect for kids or if you prefer a lighter cookie.  Will make many times more!!!

Too spongy, not what I was expecting in a cookie at all. The taste is not too sweet and flavor very bland. It would make a good muffin maybe. I will not make this again.

LOVED THIS RECEIPT!  I'm on weight watches core and this is a great cookie! I changed the 1/2c honey to 1/4c of splenda brown sugar and used Promise's Fat Free Butter Spread.  Also adding walnuts is really good but not on my diet!  Anyways, Made this last weekend and working on my third batch right now! My family can't stop eating them!

These cookies were very moist (almost soggy), and a bit to "healthy" tasting for my liking. A good alternative to the regular, "unhealthy" cookie though. I might try again with some Whole Wheat and some White flour.

We are on the heart healthy diet so I thought this would be a big treat. I was very wrong, Cookies were bland and not crispy at all. I cooked extra time, but they were just really bad. Sorry.

I really like this cookie! I used 1/4 c of margarine and 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce because I didn't have any apples. I also doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg and clove, and used 3/4 c honey. Even my brother, who doesn't like oatmeal cookies, enjoyed these! He described the taste as more like an apple crumb cookie than an oatmeal cookie. I will most certainly be making these again!

Very yummy cookie. We didn't miss the refined sugar at all! I used real vanilla and added a bit more cinnamon to bring out some more flavour. The cookies have a soft and tender texture.

I didn't have enough honey, so I used half honey, half maple syrup, and butter rather than margarine. These are indeed moist and not too sweet, just like I like it. I would try adding more spice next time, maybe some ground ginger. I'd never guess they were made with whole-wheat flour if I hadn't mixed it myself.

I thought they came out well and were a nice change from just butterscotch and oatmeal. 

One change I did make was to use Quaker apple cinnamon instant oatmeal for the oats (didn't have oats but tons of packets as we buy it at Costco) and cut the honey down to 1/4c.

Using wheat flour is an excellent idea to make cookies for the elderly too, who need mare roughage in their diet.Can definitely use mashed bananas...For sweetness as well as adding much needed potassium in the diet.

Very easy to make (used butter instead of margarine), and I wouldn't change anything in the recipe. This is a great healthy alternative, and measuring one teaspoon per cookie still makes good-sized cookies (just because they're healthy does not mean you need to make monster-sized versions).

These are far from moist, and how they got 48 cookies out of that recipe is beyond me.  However these cookies are not so bad, they aren't sweet at all though.  The apple adds a little bit of sweetness, and the honey a nice subtle undertone.  Good for a quick, healthy snack on the go, but this recipe could use a little spicing up.

Love these!  They are the ideal "first cookie" for my little gal. The cakey texture is a plus for a toothless grin.  I used butter, because I am more interested in a "natural" cookie low in sugar than reduced fat. Worked out just fine!  I also used maple syrup, since those under 12 mos cannot have honey - also worked out great! Yummy for Mama, and yummy for babe.

I just made these cookies and I think they're pretty good.  I increased the cinnamon (used a 'pumpkin pie' seasoning mix which was really nice) by a half tsp or so, and I also used two apples (grated) which worked quite well.  I think I will try subbing some applesauce for the butter (I used butter not margarine) to reduce some of the fat.  I'll probably use a jar or two of baby fruit as I have used it in cookies before with great results.  I am always on the hunt for a nutritious cookie/treat I can feel good about giving my toddler, and I think these fit the bill!

Really really good, moist and tasty. I used apple sauce for the margine. The apples give it a nice sweetness for it not having any sugar in it.

I agree with the other reviews about adding brown sugar.  I didn't add it this time but I definitely will next time - the honey doesn't add much sweetness.  They are good as far as lower fat cookies go, but not as good as regular oatmeal cookies.  The apples were a really nice addition :)

Good for a healthier cookie.  Texture was a little odd.  They were a little mushy.  Maybe more flour? I added brown sugar as suggested.

My 21 mth old toddler adores these. He helped himself to 3 cookies from the table while I wasn't looking (tisk tisk).Very healthy and just the right sweetness for us. Thanks for a great recipe!

i adore 'healthier' recipes and this certainly didnt sacrafice any flavor. i loved them! incredibly tasty alongside icecream, or soycream! 

i did make a few changes. i used earth balance butter. i added a heeeeaping cup of wwflour instead of 3/4, used unsweetened applesauce in place of an egg, nearly 1.5 tablespoons of cinnamon, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and two teaspoons of allspice. believe me, i'm glad i did. i also used 4 stevia packets alongside the honey, and a PINCH of brown sugar. 

i only had applecrisp apples on hand so i used one of those.

i used about two heaping spoonfulls of cookiedough per cookie, and the cooking time took about 4 minutes longer. 

delicious, not too sweet, and came out with the perfect consistency!!

I loved this recipe.  My youngest daughter really didn't care for it.  But my husband, who is diabetic likes them and they are low in carb so he can have more than one after dinner.

I am trying to lay off the sweets, but wanted to make a snack for bible study that I could eat. This recipe was a great find. Very yummy...I especially like the taste of honey in it. My only complaint is that they are too delicate, which might be partly my own fault for chopping the apple too big.

I made the recipe as written, only substituting butter for margerine.  They came out very moist and not too sweet which I like a lot.  I'll make them again using applesauce instead of butter and maybe adding some raisins.

Unimpressive, although that could have been my fault for replacing all of the fat with applesauce. I added some wheat germ and a ton of spices because they were kind weak on flavor, but I think with the addition of some milk they might have made decent mini muffins.

A great cookie to make with apples. I found the cookies not very sweet though. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the batter and then, once the cookie have cooled - a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar or icing sugar (or both).

Yum! Used butter instead of margarine (only 1/4 cup), brown sugar instead of honey, more cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice, and I may have added a few chocolate chips as well. These expand nicely, so you can make 48 itty bitty ones that actually turn out pretty satisfying. I also used an extra apple. Really really moist.

Yum! Used real butter, not margarine, and a sprinkle of brown sugar since I don't think I had quite enough honey. And I always use more cinnamon than the recipe says. For being a healthy cookie I think they're very good!

Cookies tasted good, but were a little dry. The recipe only yields 48 if you make very small cookies.

Very good.  halved the recipe but upped the cinnamon and added a Tablespoon of Splenda Brown Sugar.  Try it over low fat vanilla ice cream for a great summertime dessert.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not very good, at least in terms of what I think of when I think of the word "cookie." This is okay as a breakfast alternative, but it's not something I look forward to eating.

These were great!  I think they were spiced just right.  Hey Cindy, did you by any chance go to High School in San Jose, Calif.??  I knew a Cindy who married a "Carnes" after High School.  Anyway, loved the cookies!

Added walnuts which I roasted for 5 minute first at 350F. I'm going to use a little less honey next time. Used old fashioned rolled oats, half of which I ground up. Great recipe!
