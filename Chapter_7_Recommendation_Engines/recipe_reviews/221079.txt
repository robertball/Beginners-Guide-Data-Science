Excellent! If you are  looking for a true Maryland crab cake, look no further.  This is it! I have lived in Maryland, minutes from the Chesapeake Bay for 25 years, and this is practically identical to mine (I just use 12 crushed Ritz crackers, no bread crumbs), but I will try Chef John's version.  I'm very lucky, get fresh crabmeat all summer and Old Bay is a must, if you can get it. You must try this recipe!

WOW, these crab cakes were absolutely amazing!  Seriously...they are 5 star restaurant quality.  This recipe is super easy to make and require "normal" ingredients - most of which are standard in my pantry/spice rack.  For personal taste, I did add a little more Old Bay, red pepper and green onions and it came out moist, tasty, and the ingredients do not overpower the buttery sweet crab flavor (btw, I used the 16 oz blue lump crab from CostCo). One critic mentioned that they had a problem with them falling apart - I did not experience that at all.  You will need to allow a few minutes for the crab cakes to stand, and as you can tell by the picture, they held together wonderfully.  Other's mentioned having a problem forming the cakes - Try sprinkling a little bread crumbs in your hand as you start rolling them. Also, don't let your butter get too hot or it will brown too fast and remember that the quality of your crabcakes will depend on the qaulity of lump crab. These crab cakes are very "meaty" and not too bready, which is what I was hoping for. I made 5 crab cakes and they were a sufficient size.  Next time I'll try crab balls so they's go a little further.
My husband was very impressed and is still talking about them.  Hmmm, these things are so good they can be used as a tool for manipulation…or to put a smile on your honey’s face!  Enoy!

Well, I didn’t have fresh crabmeat, so I had to go with what I could buy out of the seafood section of our grocery store.  Other than that my only deviation was to use panko instead of bread crumbs.  I had no problem forming the patties, as mentioned on Chef John’s video, and mine seemed to stay together quite well.  I served these atop a salad of mixed greens, green onions, toasted almonds and feta, along with a balsamic vinaigrette.  These were good, although I’m sure they would have been better with fresh crabmeat.

Very good crab cakes, made the Maryland way. Just enough filler to hold the cakes together, and nothing to detract from the taste of the crab.. My only suggestions are to add a tablespoon of fresh minced parsley and to eliminate coating the cakes in the bread crumbs before frying. These crab cakes are delicious with fresh corn on the cob, sliced tomatoes and a potato salad.  Oh yeah, a cold brew or two. If any are left over (rare) they are delicious cold on saltine crackers.

Call me crazy but my husband and I are cheapskates and decided to use this recipe with canned tuna instead of crab. It was STILL DELICIOUS! I used 2 cans (4 oz.) since the tuna is pretty condensed in the can. Also, I cooked them for about 5 minutes per side and they were perfect. Great way to class up some tuna! I’m sure it’s even better with crab but using tuna when your pinching pennies won’t be a disappointment :)

WOW...These crab cakes are even better than the ones at a high class restaurant. I will most definatly make them again for guests, that is if I don't eat them all. Make sure you use the cayenne pepper.

I thought these tasted good. They are definitely a crab cake that is about the crab and not the filler. I had an 8oz container of lump crab meat, so I halved the recipe. (If you have never worked with fresh lump crab meat, it needs to be slightly sifted through for shells). To stretch the recipe some, I made 6 crab cakes with half the recipe. They were still a generous size. I served it with a homemade dill tartar sauce and vegetables. My only complaint is, I would have liked the center a little hotter. I had to turn the heat down to avoid browning the exterior before the interior was cooked and cook a little longer. It was still a little room temp. in the center, though, for my taste. However, I can definitely say these are of a fine restaurant quality.

I only use 4 to 6 crackers and if you broil, you don't need the bread crumbs.  I brush aluminum covered pan with olive oil and broil your crab cakes 2nd step down from broiler in 500 degree oven for 10 minutes.  No need to flip as the oil will brown the bottom. I also don't use all that slurry...just enough to hold the crab meat together.  I also use jumbo lump crab meat from the Chesapeake Bay as that is where I live.  Also, be gentle with the lump crab meat in order to keep the lumps.  I don't add salt either as the first ingredient in Old Bay is celery salt.  You can also be adventurous and add a tablespoon or two of finely minced green or red bell pepper,jalapeno, and/or onion.  This changes it up just a bit and still very good.

OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!  I followed the ingredients exactly using 6 live jumbo blue claw crabs, making 6 crab cakes.  It was a lot of work picking the crabs but they were left over from a crab fest and I didn't want them to go to waste.  I will be purchasing jumbo lump crab meat to make again. Jumbo lump contains no cartilage and is worth the extra dollars.  This recipe was so easy to make once I had my crabmeat.  It is certainly tops at our house.  Thank you Chef John for sharing!

These were awesome!   The only changes I made: using ritz crackers instead of saltines. (because I didn't have any)  And used panko bread crumbs.  Will definitely make again and again!!

Really enjoyed these crab cakes, love that they are mostly crab, little cake.  This said, even after two hours of refrigeration I found them a little difficult to form.  After forming I chilled for a couple of more hours.  Next time I will add a few more crackers, and make 5-6 smaller cakes, four cakes were huge, and perhaps that's why they wanted to break apart.  I sauteed in a super hot mix of peanut oil and butter to get a good crust and keep them together.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Chef John, it's a keeper after a few tweaks for me.

This is an excellent crab cake recipe - heavy on the crab, light on everything else.  In fact there was so much crab, and so little filler, I had a difficult time forming the cakes.  But once they were formed and in the pan I left them alone until they had a chance to brown. Then I was able to successfully flip them to brown on the other side.  The only ingredient I added was chopped scallions.  I served them with Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans, also from this site.  Thanks Chef John!

Loved the texture of these crab cakes.  Not overly bready, loaded with crab meat.  We did feel that it was on the bland side.  Will definitely make again but will add some fresh parsley,garlic and black pepper - perhaps a bit more Old Bay.

So, I just joined this site to continue my growing addiction to cooking. Only 30, but been cooking since I was 10. I have to give it to Chef John: hooked on his site and YouTube channel for a good while now. 

Which brings me to this recipe - Pure and simple shot at the crab cake with the emphasis on the crab meat alone. Love the saltine crackers! I couldn't help but add 1/4 cup of celery and a 1/4 cup of roasted red peppers. 

I'm glad to find this guy on this site. He's legit!

I made crab cakes! They were great and my husband loved them. The fresh crab is so much better than canned and the small amount of filler really lent itself to a crabby cake. I served with lemon on the side and made a Greek yogurt/dill sauce although I was the only one who used the sauce. I can't wait to make it again.

As a crab cake novice, I was confused on which type to use, lump or claw. After a quick google search, lump was found to be the type, it sticks together better and has the desired white coloring. Not a fan of spicy but I used chili pepper for a little kick and subbed in panko for crumbs. Lastly, mine took about 6 minutes a side, for that golden brown. Served with "Goddess" dressing from Trader Joe's. Yum-o!

I don't eat seafood, so this rating is based on my husband and sons review. They loved them and I did followed the recipe exactly and doubled the recipe so I had 8 crab cakes. I have made many Chef John recipes and all of them have been outstanding.

To help prevent the cakes from falling apart, try refrigerating them before frying.  I'm from Maryland and I see that some people claim they're bland and all they need to do is add more Old Bay.  I use about 2 tsp, not 1/2 tsp as the recipe calls for.  You can even bake crab cakes to save on calories, but in my opinion fried is the best.  I see that people eat crab cakes with tartar sauce (I can't even imagine), try a simple homemade cocktail sauce (ketchup & horseradish) instead.  YUM!

These cakes were amazing, they came out as good as any place we went out to eat. We used real crab meat not the fake stuff and followed the recipe tp the tee and  loved it. Thanks Chef John.

These crab cakes are awesome!  I added a bit of chopped carrots, celery, and onion to the mix.  They tasted great especially with fresh crab meat.

Excellent recipe!  Easy and it showcases the crab.  Fresh crab not available where I live so had to use canned.  It was still very good.  Can only imagine how good it would be with fresh. Used panko with a bit of chopped fresh parsley for coating.

Rave reviews all around!  This was definitely a hit!  I followed other reviews and replaced the Saltines with Ritz crackers, added extra cayenne (because I LOVE the spice), and threw in some finely sliced green onion.  Quite possibly the greatest crab cakes I've ever had (and yes I live in MD).  These cakes know where the focus should be - on the crab.  Just enough filler to hold it all together.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks for the recipe Chef John!!!

This was my first time making crab cakes and they turned out great. I followed the directions but added a few things: a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, two thinly, chopped green onions, and I used Keebler's Flatbread Crackers in the Sea Salt and Olive Oil flavor instead of plain saltines; and, I fried the patties in olive oil. Next time, I'll double the recipe because these are so outrageously, mouth-watering good. These are perfect as crab cake slider appetizer.

Oh my word, these crab cakes are absolutely delicious!  I made them almost exactly per the recipe (forgot the salt, but we're not salt people anyway so none of us missed it), and they have to be the best crab cakes I've ever had.  This is literally just crab meat and a tiny bit of binder to hold it together, which is why refrigeration is key.  The patties hold their shape better when they are cold.  Served tonight with corn and sweet potato fries, and they were a huge hit.  Next time I may change it up with extra Old Bay and Ritz crackers, but the crab cakes were amazing as is.

I made this recipe as stated, but did not use fresh off the boat crabmeat, but the container seafood you find in the fish/seafood area of some markets. I don't know what kind of taste I was expecting to get, but it seemed to be lacking something but overall it was good. I will make this again and take into account some of the other folks suggestions to see if that changes it... perhaps I didn't get all the liquid drained, but the cakes didn't fall apart, some cracks.  Thanks Chef John and to all the other cooks/chefs that have reviewed this recipe and made suggestions!

Fantastic and easy. Needed to add a touch flour to keep mixture together but awesome. Furst ever time making crab cakes too. I made 5 times quantity in slightly smaller size for July 4 and it was a huge success served with tartar sauce and lemon wedges. Two platters literally disappeared.

I cannot believe that this recipe is so fantabulous.  I used the same ingredients as the recipe, except it turned out to be only 8 oz of crab meat.  I was going to add chopped surimi flakes, but looking at the mixture, it looked like I didn't have to do anything to it. There was enough moisture to form cakes,  which, as soon as one side was done, I flipped the cakes over to finish them.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Living in Coastal Virginia - this is the real deal!  Too bland - be sure you are using only Old Bay seasoning - there is no substitute in the world for it.  Won't hold together - not really supposed to hold together - get the cakes into the butter - the cooking process will bind them - they aren't supposed to have a lot of breading.

These came out great and I’ll definitely make them again! A few changes though...I added a special garlic aioli mustard (instead of Dijon) and only about a teaspoon of it since it has a very strong flavor profile. Also I didn’t use cayenne, added about 4 tablespoons of mayo, added Worcester to taste (about 4x the amount), and used a cup of panko  breadcrumbs instead of saltines. Lastly, I baked them in the oven using coconut oil at about 475 for approximately 8 min on each side or until they weee golden brown (SO MUCH easier than frying them in oil on the stove and they came out fantastically).

I used panko as the bread crumbs on the outside (just what I had on hand), which I thought made the outside nice and crispy. As Chef John states in the video, forming them is a little tricky, but you can do it with some persistence. Otherwise quite easy to make. My wife and I really enjoyed them, reminded us of our trip to Maryland last year. Another very nice offering from Chef John!

Thank you Chef John!  I had to use crab meat from a can, but to be fair, it's what I had, and your recipe is what came up, so I used it even though I didn't have fresh crab meat.  This was awesome.

A decent crab cake.  As previously stated....they are a little bland.  I added a full teaspoon of dijon mustard.  Next time I will increase it a little more.  I also think it needs some acid...maybe some lemon zest and juice.  I added a tablespoon of green onion and cooked them in the cast iron skillet in a combo of butter and coconut oil.  A little more tweaking and these could be perfect!!

We thought it was a good, basic crab cake recipe, especially if you want a pure crab taste.  That being said, next time I will up the seasoning as was bland. I used pretzel crackers, 8, which were not too salty and I had on hand.  I used panko for the coating.  No salt. Next time I will use lemon infused oil and butter as they were a little too crisp, brown and lower the time to cook to 3 mins per side.

WoW!  Restaurant quality crab cakes.  I made two changes.  I sauted approx 1 tbs vadalia onion and doubles the old bay seasoning and they were terrific.

Perfect. My only change was using low sodium bay seasoning, not adding salt, no  cayenne and I held the cakes in my hand and sprinkled the with  the  breadcrumb instead of patting on the plate.  They held together that way. . My husband loved them.

This recipe is amazing. We live in the Midwest where it’s not easy to buy crab and I love crab cakes. I had leftover baked haddock and used it in place of the crab. They were incredible. Followed the recipe exactly other than the fish. Will definitely make again.

AMAZING & deliciously delightful. The crabmeat is the star! Not any other flavor comes thru ahead of the crab....then the rest just highlight that fresh taste!!!

So wonderful! Amazing flavor with not alot of fuss. Outside had a slight crunch. Inside is moist and flavorful. There is enough to this recipe to make 6 cakes that are a bit thinner if you want. I thought we were gonna eat all 4 but we were wrong. It is so dense that one thick crab cake, a person, filled us up. I am gonna have to sit up for a while. :P
I didn't have fresh crab. I bout 2 8oz containers of crab meat. Still amazing!  I can only imagine fresh crab like the recipe calls for.

Recipe is perfect, in fact the finished results were awesome! I didn't change anything major, only used about 4 tablespoons of butter, adding more half way through since crab cakes were absorbing more after being turning over. Also, my wife & I watched your video all the way through prep and cooking, you are the best......"Old Bay.... Not New Bay" was hilarious!                                                                            PS: In a separate post I wished for a recipe and video for Sweetbreads. Hope to see it soon!??                 Dick Bobb, Bailli, GeorgiaGolden Isles Chaine des Rotisseurs.

My kids just came back from Panama City Beach and had crab cakes twice from the famous Captain Anderson's Restaurant there. I made these per the recipe and made them into 6 cakes as I thought the four made for too large cakes, and I was worried about getting them done in the centers. Their response was that they thought as some reviewers have said, that they are good but a bit bland by the one's from Captain Anderson's. I did use canned crab meat because you can't get fresh in Kentucky. Next time I believe I would add more cayenne and maybe more Old Bay. However, with that said, everyone cleaned their plates and they were asking if there were more. So maybe Chef John beat Captain Anderson's by the result of the empty plates? And for those that are having trouble with them falling apart. These are not pancakes to be flipped. Transfer them to the pan with a spatula under them and slide them off into the pan gently. Then when it comes time to turn them, gently turn them over with the spatula underneath and support the patty and hold the uncooked side with your hand or another spoon or spatula and gently turn them. The cooked side will help hold them together.

followed the recipe to a T and they came out perfect!  Totally gourmet style, impressed how easy and wonderful.  my tip is to pack the cakes tight like a dense meatball so they cling together. loved them. Thank you Chef John.

I'd give this 3stars for what I achieved, but I'm sure it'd been much better if we used fresh crab like the recipe. Don't use costco canned Ocean crab. I know, just had it in pantry, wanted to try it. Saw the recipe. But I think the taste of the recipe comes from the crab. Duh. So I gave it 4 stars because it did make nice looking cakes.

Awesome! Mine fell apart a bit but I was using crab that had some butter in it, and I used the dried heal of very good ancient grain bead instead of saltines.  The butter I fried them in was from my first crab meal and was a mix of butter, olive oil, lemon and garlic, which added an extra layer of flavor. Ate them with a bit of tartar sauce and wish I had more! Yum!!

My daughter surprised me with this one!  WOW!! I am a crab cake snob, and these were GREAT. She changed a few things... no Worchestershire sauce or cayenne, and used Cajun seasoning instead of seafood seasoning.  She didn't coat with bread crumbs, but instead sprinkled with a little more Cajun seasoning.  Less carbs.... WAY DELICIOUS!!    We have made these again 3 times in the last 10 days. :)

This recipe is awesome & the video is helpful! Chef John's recommendation to only use fresh crab is spot on - it makes a world of difference! I didn't wait the full hour before forming the cakes, and I used a homemade version of "old bay"seasoning from a recipe on this website (so I could avoid paprika due to an allergy) , but those were my only deviations from the recipe. My husband raved about these, so thank you Chef John!

I made as the recipe stated. I think these are fantastic! They weren't quite as wet as I thought they were going to be, but you still have to be a little bit careful when you're putting them into your pan. I will definitely be making these again. Spot on!

Oh, my! Simple and delicious.. doesn't get much better than that, kids! My dinner companion loves this and said it was of restaurant-quality. I will never order crab cakes again. It's this recipe or nothing Rock on, Chef John and keep those recipes coming! I served these crab cakes with Chef John's Spicy Mango Sauce, sweet potato fries, and sauteed green beans. Delish!

This is the best crab cake I have ever tasted. I have never made them before till tonight and everyone even the kids loved them. They stayed together perfectly when frying. The only thing I did differently was added some extra old bay because some said it was bland and bye far It was not bland at all.

This was delicious! I set the bones on the side of the plate and then smash them with a fork and mix them into the flaked salmon. You don't even know they're in there and the calcium is good for you. Mary Ann

Excellent!  This was my first time making a homemade crab cake and it turned out just right.  Easy to make for a novice.  Nothing but crab flavor through and through.  I found I needed to bump up the mayo and Dijon just a little to get the consistency I wanted, and I went just a tad more on the old bay for flavor.  Served with a steak and my wife was impressed!

These were SO good! I like things spicy, so I made everything as is except I took a yellow chili pepper, minced and sautéed it in a little olive oil, cooled it, and tossed it into the mixture. I could have eaten 10 of these! I got rave reviews from my guests as well. I found that to reheat, take a little bit of butter (mixed with cayenne pepper if you like the heat), drizzle on top, and stick it in the toaster oven. Thank you for this recipe a hundred times over!!

Edit: I forgot to mention about the cakes falling apart while cooking. It was my first time making something like this, so it took a little bit of experimenting. I found that if I used one spatula to stop the crab cake from moving, I could easily slide another spatula underneath the cake. I then kind of pressed the two spatulas together to flip the cake and nestle it back into the oil. After a couple of tries, the cakes came out perfect. No mess! No falling apart!

I don't eat seafood but I made these for my boyfriend. He loved them! 
I would make them again but make them smaller and a tad more cracker to keep them together.

I followed this recipe to the t and I used fresh snow crab clusters that were on sale at Ralph's this week. These where better than 90% of the crab cakes I get in restaurants. The only thing shelling snow crab is labor intensive.

I have tried this recipe the only substitution was the crackers which were Ritz. I've been following Chef John for quite a while and found his recipes to be a wonderful culinary and palatable venue. The photo above with Rice is this dish, Enjoy!

I made these tonight, and i went by the entire recipe, except i had to go with imitation crab meat, and i found the mixture to be dry. i had to add more egg, and honestly i didn't care too much for this recipe. I love crab cakes, and have had many different ones, but these were not a favorite. this is just my opinion, and i'm not judging for others. My family didn't care much for them either.

I have been learning to trap blue crabs.  I got some and made this recipe. I doubt that I had a full pound of meat, but these were excellent.  I need to get out and catch more crabs.

I made these for dinner tonight along with mango-pineapple cole slaw and homemade dijon tartar sauce. I could hear my husband in the other room exclaiming about how good it all was. He said he had never had crab cakes as good as these. Thanks Chef John! You are now on my favorites list!

I was drawn to this recipe by reviews, along with the limited ingredient list. This is the first time I’ve made crab cakes and I will definitely make this recipe again.   I didn’t have breadcrumbs so I used crushed Ritz crackers. I also added the optional cayenne. It was served with spicy mayo.

Made this twice with left over king crab legs.  One hack that helped to keep them together during the crumbing was using a slider patty ring (or open top biscuit cutter) and parchment. I would put the ring on the parchment square, sprinkle crumbs in it, add crab cake mix, press down and add crab cakes to top. When you flip it into the pan, you have more control.

Very good to excellent.  Ingredients not spicy at all but let the crab flavor come forth.  Loved the panko crumbs on each side to let them get crispy.  From one lb. crabmeat I got 6 crab cakes and cooked 5 mins on a side.

This recipe makes a delicious crab cake.  However, I added about a teaspoon of very finely chopped green pepper and a couple tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese.

Great taste. I only had canned crab and fresh would have been much better. I also should have drained it better.  I dipped in Panko before frying. Cakes stuck together after cooking at high heat.p but fell apart initially. Served with Alfredo pasta.

Amazing!  Maybe I haven't used fresh crab in my prior efforts, but this was amazing.  I didn't change a thing, except adjusted to 2 servings.

The flavor is good and the recipe is easy, but my cakes would not stay together for the life of me. Probably user error. On the other hand, frying up the crab mixture as a hash until crispy and serving over salad with lemon juice was great!

I used Striper instead of crab and the striper cakes  were a hit.
With a squirt of fresh lemon this recipe is a winner and will be used again.

Instead of honey dijon mustard, I found this stuff at Sams Club called Sam's Choice Dill Mustard ( awesome flavor) and used that instead. I also add a little Texas Pete. Also to the cracker mixture,  I crush up the Texas Toast brand of Chipotle Tortilla Strips to give the flavor an extra push. Came out delicious!!!

I was craving crab cakes and made this recipe. I did not like it- actually forced myself to eat it so I wouldn’t waste $15 worth of crab meat. The flavors were just off. I added fresh squeezed lemon to try to help it, but meh.

They were ok. Cooking them in butter only, even at medium/low heat still caused them to brown/burn too much. I think I would consider frying them in oil next time. The cakes did set up nicely and held together ok, but not as well as they did in his video. To Chef John's credit, I didnt have fresh crab as it was out of season so perhaps the flavor was not as good as it couldve been. I would also suggest doubling the Old Bay as they were just a little bland until dusted after cooking.

I used 2 8oz. containers of white crab meat (not lump). It made 8 small crab cakes. I just added a little more cayenne and Old Bay. There were delicious! I will make these again.

If you have trouble getting these to hold together, form them into cakes and put them in the freezer for 15 minutes. They will still cook all the way through.

Hubby had problems with it sticking together. We'll either reduce the amount of crab or just make half a recipe cause real crab is way to expensive where we live.

My husband told me he felt like he was eating in a five star restaurant. I served the crab cakes with the Garlic Mayonnaise Aioli, a perfect match. Agree with Chef John that the patties were a pain because they were fairly delicate but just have a little patience with that part. The end result was out of this world!

I added  a large titch of pepper sauce in addition to Chef John's  standard recipe. I used the meat of one, whole, freshly-cooked Dungeness  crab. I served them naked and wouldn't change a thing. Great recipe you can count on with an expensive ingredient.

They were delicious! And this from my husband that thinks seafood should not be made at home lol... I did have a little struggle of them holding together when I flipped them but I think that was my issue not the recipe.. I will definitely be making these again.. I may try starting them in my cast iron and finish them in the oven ...

I had to use canned crab, which probably made the mixture drier, so I can't deduct a star for not using fresh as directed. I added an egg to keep it together. This had a nice balance of flavor, not overpowering the crab. Mine with the canned crab only rated 4 stars, just missing that freshness.

I don't use any breadcrumbs. I add diced onions (or diced celery) and diced butternut squash. I also melt 2 tablespoons of butter and mix it into the batter. Broil at 500 degrees for 11-12 minutes on a greased tray on the second shelf. Incidentally,  Kroger-brand lump crab in a can is actually pretty good, and it works out to be about $18/lb drained.

No changes!!!! Made as indicated and these came out GREAT.  Hubby is very very happy.  Although "real" crabmeat is slightly expensive it is well worth the expense.  Thank you for another great recipe to add to my rotation of seafood.  Must try.  I did make a tartar of my own recipe, but will try Chef John's next time.

Just made theses crab cakes for dinner.  Delicious but hard to keep together even though I browned until  crispy.  Still worth making again because  the few simple ingredients  really compliment the crab.  It’s a keeper.  Thanks Chef John you came through once again.

I used by products from salmon filetting-cut offs from bones, raw, previously frozen, chopped them coarsely, followed the recipe  exactly and it turned out to be the best recipe for fish cakes so far. I tempted to skip refrigeration but did not. It helped to make it sticky and keep it together without the need of adding an egg like some people do.

These are fine. I would add a bit more dijon and a bit more Old Bay than the recipe indicates. I made mine with canned crab and they still tasted good, so this recipe can work on a budget!

I substituted  2 cans of tuna, Ritz cracker, light mayo and used cooking spray. OH YUM- will have to try crab next time but delish with tuna as well. Paired with a mixture of thousand island/parsley for dipping.

a friend gave us freshly caught crabs, and this recipe helped to create amazing crab cakes.  I made some changes, used Panko instead of the saltines and about 3/4 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning.  Possibly because of using Panko I needed to add  more butter when frying.  We will definitely be making this again.Thank you Chef John, your recipes never fail me!

Delicious!  I refrigerated the mixture overnight, then formed mini-crab cakes the next day for a Christmas appetizer.  I coated them with the breadcrumbs and baked them in a 375 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.  The recipe made about 18 mini cakes.

Tried using leftover king crab meat to make these. I don't know if the crab pieces were too large, or if I made the patties too round/large, but they slightly fell apart while cooking.  Also, you'll want to make sure the patties are flat.  I think mine were too round because the edges didn't cook.   I didn't love the taste, it was kind of bland and slightly rubbery. I might have overcooked it to make it rubbery, but this felt like it needs a sauce to go with it for more flavor.

Made Chef John's crab cakes exactly per instructions as well as the remoulade 2.0 tarter sauce, but added some fresh dill -- wonderful, flavors. The crab I bought at Trader Joe's who sells the 1lb tin of Chicken of the Sea claw crab. I had no problem with the cakes holding together. I folded it all together in a glass mixing bowl, then "vacuum sealed" by placing a piece of Saran Wrap directly on the mixture. I let it meld for 24 hours as I did the remoulade. Final step before frying, I opted for using Panko. I'll add these cakes warm up nicely in a microwave for roughly 45 seconds. Yum.

Made this last night for my Wife.    Had the pan a little too hot and over cooked the second side just a bit.  All in all good recipe.  I dropped the cayenne pepper, as the wife does not like heat.  paired it with some asparagus, small salad and some pinot.

Husband loved it!! We're from New Orleans and love a good crab cake. I added 1 soft boiled sweet potato to add to the nutrient value. He had no clue. Good crab meat helps. Also added tarragon per another recipe. Will add lemon juice next time to brighten the flavor but they were yummy. Crispy on the outside soft and delicious on the outside. The sweet potato put it to the edge of moisture capability. Might reduce mayo to compensate for that. Thanks Chef!!

These were amazing! I'd never made crab cakes before, but everyone said they were as good as a 5 star restaurant! They fell apart a bit as other reviewers said, but nothing unmanageable and cooked just fine. I served them with a homemade tartar sauce.

Good, but a little bland.  Examine crab for shells and cartilidge before adding to mix; and make sure you really press all the water out of the crab so they'll hold together better.  Chill well before making into patties.  Made a half recipe.  Had to use veggie flavored Ritz for the saltines and added 1 Tbs. of minced green onion, green and white part; 2 Tbs. of minced celery, 1 tsp. of lemon juice,  1/2 tsp. of lemon zest and a few drops of Tabasco; added an extra Tbs. of bread crumbs to shape the patties.  To make the patties and help them to hold together, I used a quarter cup measure to scoop out even quantities of the mixture and then dropped each scoop one-at-a-time directly into a pie plate with the bread crumbs.  I then gently pressed the patties into the size I wanted and, using a thin spatula, turned the patties to coat the other side. Used spatula to lift out the patties and place on a cooking sheet (because its flat and not curved on the bottom like a plate) leaving enough room in between them so I could later easily lift them off the cookie sheet with a spatula and add to a skillet for frying.  The bread crumbs seemed to help the patties stay together rather than trying to shape in my hands, which wasn't working out at all.  Made 4 patties.  Will add some red pepper, onion, and jalapeno next time.

These turned out really nice. I've made them twice, and the 2nd time I added another egg to help them stay together while frying. It worked. I also added fresh lemon juice to the mixture. They were delicious.

Awesome!  I used a pound of leftover Great Lakes whitefish instead of crab as I live in Michigan and that's what we have!  I also used Panko breadcrumbs on the outside instead of regular because that's what I had on hand. They were amazing - crunchy exterior, super moist inside. Will make again for sure.

Homeade and delicious. 3rd time making and turns out good every time. I use claw meat because lump or jumbo lump is so expensive for 8oz. It may fall apart easier by who cares bc it still tastes good. Good alternative to always eating fish or shrimp weekly.

This was my first attempt at making crab cakes, ever, and I was not disappointed! I didn't have any saltine crackers, so I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs instead. I didn't add any salt because crab tends to bring out it's saltiness and I was correct. it was slightly oversalted, but that was from the crab, not the recipe itself.  I was very pleased with this recipe.

The only ingredient I did not add was the seafood seasoning because I was out of it.  I also very gently stirred in the crab meat to keep nice lumps of meat,  then tossed in Seasoned panko breadcrumbs.  My husband loved them too.

Great meaty crab cakes. I did add a small amount of very fine chopped red pepper and green onion. Don't forget Chef John's secret ingredient - cayenne pepper, and just a little garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and pinch of salt.  Chill crab mixture and sprinkle with a lite dusting of bread crumbs and drizzle with a little melted butter. Backed them in a 375 degree oven for approx. 15 minutes a side. I served them garnished with lemon wedges, tarter sauce, a dill potato salad, sliced herb seasoned tomatoes and corn on the cob. Hello summer !!

Used imitation crab. Have to say I would add more egg next time because the crab was too bulky and it fell apart. And if you use imitation crab you probably need more bread crumbs too. The tricky part is getting it to hold together when frying it in the pan. It tasted pretty good although I didn't get the perfect round cake.

This is a good base for crab cakes however with the listed ingredients, it is bland.  I dressed it up with lemon, different seasoning and fresh herbs.  Instead of saltines, I use a mixture of panko and Italian Breadcrumbs.  If you can't find Italian breadcrumbs use whole wheat fine breadcrumbs and add 1 a 1.5 tbsp of Italian seasoning.  Add 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice, fresh finely chopped Italian parsley and finely chopped fresh chives to the listed mixture.  If you find the mix too runny, add panko to thicken it up.  When frying the crab cakes, I use white wine and garlic and sauté them slowly and I serve them on a garden salad.  Use a dollop of cucumber & dill salad dressing atop the crab cakes.

We love these card cakes. It is simple and few ingredients.   Some friends don't like onion, so a lot of cooking requires airomatics myself that is what make a dish. But some times simple is good with guests.

Pretty much the same way I have made these for last 40 years, I just add a little Old Bay seasoning to the mix and only use the egg yolk but everything else is the same. I think these taste best at room temperature rather than hot. I don't add tartar sauce  or cocktail sauce just plain with French Fries. I use King Crab meat and the difference is huge! Snow Crab is good too....I really can't stand the canned but the frozen or the refrigerated lump crab is not bad. Also fresh Rock or Jonas Crab claws are very good. If using the frozen King Crab legs  or Snow Crab legs just taste the meat 1st as sometimes it is salty.  I buy the frozen legs and let them sit overnight in fridge than pick the meat out....takes a while but is worth it.

I eliminated the mustard and Worcestershire. I added some minced parsley and dill weed. used 50/50 of bread crumbs and panko. Made an aioli sauce. They were great!

Great recipe! Considering you don't add much to this recipe, it was filling and delicious. I lightly breaded them and still got the nice crispy outside.

This is a great recipe.  Since I didn't have fresh crab meat I used two cans of lump crab meat, added a small finely diced red pepper and used panko instead of crackers.  All of the adjustments were easy to make and they held together beautifully.  Topped with a little horseradish sauce!

Followed the recipe almost exactly except I used cornmeal instead of breadcrumbs to coat them before frying them.  It gave them a nice texture.

These crab cakes were delicious. I followed the recipe as written except I used claw meat instead of the lump. It was on sale at our local grocery store.  It was actually very good. I refrigerated the mixture for an hour, and refrigerated again after I made 6 patties.  I had no problem with them falling apart, yet you have to be very gentle handling them . After I sautéed them , I put them in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes so the inside was warmed through. Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper

These were absolutely delicious. This is my first review and I'm happy to do so. I followed the recipe basics, only using Ritz crackers vs saltines  and left out the Worcestershire as a personal preference. Superb recipe. I will be making again

This is what a crab cake should be, chunks of crab meat held together with a minimum of binder. 

I serve with a sauce made from a little mayo with a bit of sour cream, dijon and tarragon.

Loved this!   Used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs because that is what I had.   Placed them on a bed of greens with cherry tomatoes from the garden, asparagus sautéed in butter, bacon, and a vinaigrette made from balsamic vinegar, ground mustard, bacon grease, olive oil, and scotch (because it was open and the wine was not yet).   Even my kids, who had never had crab cakes, went back for seconds.   Fed four for dinner!

This is my go to crab cake recipe. My family loves it! A couple changes I make are adding 2-3 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley, omitting the salt (Old Bay has some salt in it), and adding 2-3 cloves of chopped garlic. I highly recommend trying this crab cake recipe!

While I was hoping they would be ok for a first-time attempt, my husband (the most critical of food critics) devoured them before I could even snap a picture!  Apparently they were delicious!!  Wonderful recipe!  Obviously easy to follow (if I could make it successful!) Thank you!!!!

If you don't have crab you can make these with fish. I made them with rock fish since my husband just caught some.  They were delicious.

I used Carr's Water Crackers, doubled the Mayo, and used crab picked from two steamed Dungenness Crabs.  and I always used Old Bay as a seafood seasoning.  These turned out moist, and delicious, and would highly recommend this recipe.  It made 5 nice sized patties which I fried till crispy on both sides, omitting the bread crumbs.

These are very light and tasty. There is another recipe similar to this one but with a lot more dijon mustard- something like 3x the amount. The mustard is not noticeable in this recipe. But I loved it. My husband like the extra crunch from the panko on the outside but I think I would rather skip that step.  If you only flip them once (4 Min per side) they will not fall apart on you. I will make these again.

I made no substitutions. Made it as described and it was super good. Goes well with a little sriracha or Sambal Oelek.

I really dislike seafood in general; it was not a big part of my diet growing up.  By some strange twist of fate I've ended up cooking for a small group of retired people for a living. They LOVE this recipe (along with many others I've found on this site that I can and do "tweak" if  I think it could "help"). I can tell anyone reading this that it's always a hit with my group of folks.  Making them happy  is my job, and this recipe works wonderfully for me.  I'm grateful to have found it.

This will be the second time I make these. I forgot saltine crackers both times, so I'm using breadcrumbs again. Totally delicious. Last time I used fresh-caught crab and it was the star of the taste show-not a lot of filler flavor. I was worried the cakes wouldn't hold together but they were fine. I made a chipotle aiole to dip the cakes in. Definitely a keeper! Tonight we'll try with store-bought crab.

These were excellent.  The only change I made was adding some fresh chopped parsley.  The recipie made 4 and I thought we would each have 2, but after eating 1, it was very rich and satisfying so we save the leftover for lunch the next day. As I have made these about 6 times now I recommend the 1lb package of Phillips Crabmeat from Costco.  $14.99.  Do not get the crabmeat from Sam's Club.  We had to throw that out.

I made these for a party. They were gone before I could turn around. I made one small change  I didn't have old bay in the house and I substituted a Cajun seasoning blend. I made a double recipe and made appetizer size. I ended up with about 26. Will defiantly make these again.

These crab cakes were the best I ever made.  I followed the recipe but used panko bread crumbs for a crispier coating. I also used my cast iron skillet.  I have a feeling these will become a staple in my family especially during Lent.

I made these as written.  I had a hard time keeping them together.  The crab cakes were huge.  Making them smaller would have been better.  I liked that there was a lot of crab and not much filler.  We found them a bit bland.  I might try them again, with some tweaking.

They held together well in frying and looked pretty, but they were very bland, even with they cayenne.  Everyone soaked them in tarter sauce after the first bite, in order to add flavor.  If I make these again, I will add more spice.

We had leftover crab from steaming crab legs on New Years Eve.  This recipe is awesome,  It is much better than any other I have tried.  Just enough binder that does not overwhelm the crab. My husband said these were "superior in every way" to the crab cakes he orders at a well-known restaurant.   It is now my "go to" crab cake recipe.

These are delicious! I may or may not have let mine get too crispy... oops! They still tasted fantastic. Next time I think I'll make them a little smaller; they are pretty rich and could be served as hors d'oeuvres. The only thing I did different was adding a good bit of garlic powder

The crab was the star in this recipe!  Delicious.  Only changes I made were: ritz instead of saltines, did not coat in breadcrumbs, let the formed cakes sit in fridge for about 2 hours to set ( they did not fall apart) and I sautéed in olive oil with 1 tablespoon of butter.

I literally made this a few minutes ago. I love it! I did follow the recipe almost to the T paying close  attention to the addition of salt & pepper "to taste".  I cooked them in batches of two at a time. By the second batch I did have to add more butter. That is about the only change I made. I would definitely make this again. Thank you Chef John!

I followed the recipe.  My first patty was a little thick and I had trouble keeping it together.  The other 3 were great.  We ate them with a lettuce and tomato salad and a baked potato.  Great 51st anniversary dinner.

This very tasty but 1 egg and 8 crackers are not enough to keep them from falling apart. I made these just like the recipe called for and they turned into crab hash because they fell completely apart. But this is a good started recipe we will twick it in the future.

Used fake crab meat  and thati cut too much and no paprika.  They fell apart,  even been after 2 hours in the fridge. Not much taste.  Try again with real crab

This was okay.  I've never made crab cakes at home before so I have nothing to compare it to.  I do like that it used butter instead of oil because oil can drastically changed the flavor in foods.

Pretty good and close to what you'd get in a good seafood restaurant. I made a creamy horseradish sauce to serve with them. Mix together 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup mayo and 2 - 3 TBS horseradish. Chill for at least an hour before serving.  Awesome crab cake sauce! Served these cakes along with Thia peanut noodles with sauteed shrimp in garlic butter and green onions for a wonderful seafood supper!

These are better than any crab cake I've ever eaten in a restaurant. The crab was expensive but well worth it. My fiancé couldn't say enough about this meal! He is a chef himself, so it took him a minute to believe I can cook. I use John's recipes a lot. Fabulous!

Delicious, especially with the remoulade sauce a la New Orleans, that was suggested on my daily recipes along with the crab cakes. Both served with local sweet corn, and I thought I had died and gone to heaven!

More breading than my husband likes got this 4 stars. I loved them. I know this sounds strange but take it from a Chesapeake Bay girl- no good crab cake recipe is complete without Worcestershire sauce. Do not leave it out!

I will not do this one again. I used canned crab meat which I drained first. I refrigerated it all day while I was at work, but it did not hold together AT ALL.

I agree with my fellow Marrylander.  Excellent recipe!  
 However not all crab meat is the same.  If you can be selective.  Too many imports coming in with cheap pricing and very different taste.  The best is Maryland blue crab then look for VA, NC, LA and TX.
Bon appetite

First time in a while I have seen a crab recipe that doesn't include green pepper.  Never put peppers in crab cakes, it dominates the flavor.  Lump crab meat should be used for crab cakes if you can afford it!  Canned lump crab works in a pinch, not as good as fresh, but it does the job.

If you are looking for a crab cake recipe that is all about the crab, this is it.  I have made these crab cakes multiple times with both fresh (caught that day) & frozen crab.  I get nothing but rave reviews from them.  I use about half the crackers & they are a little harder to work with because they fall apart easier, but the resulting taste is so worth it!  I do dry the crab meat in paper towels prior to seasoning which helps me to not need the crackers as much.  Also, you can prep it hours in advance and pull it out when you are ready to cook.

Just about the perfect crab cake recipe.  Easy to make and as good as any crab cakes you have ever had.  Don't skip the putting the mixture in the frig for a least an hour before cooking. It does seem to help to keeping the cakes together so the can be turned turning the cooking.  Mike

Excellent.  Just perfect!  Used 10 Ritz crackers because we didn't have Saltines on hand - worked wonderfully.  I'll probably used Ritz in the future too.  (Used 10 b/c I figured the smaller rounder Ritz equaled about 8 Saltines).

These turned out great! I subbed olive oil for the butter for frying but otherwise I stuck strictly to the recipe (something I don't usually do). I had no problem with them falling apart in the pan. These have a great flavor that went well with a lemon-dill sauce I added on the side. I usually tweak recipes (as I'm sure most of us do) but the next time I make these I won't be changing much. Thanks for sharing it Chef John!

Absolutely wonderful!  Served with an Old Bay Mayo which was great.  Just mix some Old Bay with mayo and let set for a while.

These were really good! I doubled the recipe and I used my own "old bay seasoning" recipe. I also had it with my homemade tartar sauce. Yum!

Oh my goodness!  These were so yummy.  The only thing I would change about this recipe is to maybe make a special note at the beginning that the mixture needs to rest in the fridge for an hour before you cook them.  (I'm bad about not reading ahead!). They were so flavorful without all that excess breading you sometimes find.  I made them with Chef John's Fried Green Tomatoes, which were also delicious.

yes this recipe is great! I used Tony's Chachere's seasoning instead of Old Bay and it doesnt require any salt or pepper. I will be using this recipe again and again! Awesome!

My daughter made these crab cakes for dinner tonight. She added a little more old bay seasoning and cayenne pepper than the recipe called for. The flavor was wonderful. The cakes crumbled a little due to the fact that there was little filler but it didn't affect the flavor. She served them with homemade tartar sauce and oven roasted asparagus. The crab cakes were very filling. We are stuffed! Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly. Too salty! Perhaps low sodium saltines would be better. I used fresh crab and I'm so disappointed.

Made these for dinner tonight.  I did not bread my crab cakes (personal preference), otherwise followed the recipe as written. They were absolutely wonderful.  I served mine on rolls with some lettuce, tomato and mango habanero salsa.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

We just mae this recipe today.  Have only ate crab cakes once in a restaurant and they were horrible.  These were absolutely to die for.  Great taste and very easy to assemble. I will be making these again and again.

Chef John, I've made alot of your recipes and they're always real good so tonight we tried this crab cake recipe.  Fabulous!  My husband is still raving about them, and I printed out your recipe and put it directly into my "it's a keeper" binder.  The taste of the crab meat really shines, and the other ingredients are just like a 'supporting cast' and they don't overpower each other. Which is just how a good crab cake should be!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I didn't even refrigerate the mixture before cooking them and I had no problem with them falling apart. I also don't have access to old bay here in Japan, so I used paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, and pepper. Chef John, you are the man!!!!

Wow! We desired something new and I was nervous because his video emphasized having the best of crab. My supermarket crab was good enough and we loved these!! (Ps: watch his video, it's great).   This was incredible (and crazy easy!!) thanks chef John!

I followed the recipe other then I added a full teaspoon of old bay, I followed all the steps but I still had problems with mine sticking together. They had a good taste, they just fell apart. I'm not sure what I did wrong.

Pretty good. I added more cayenne than a pinch, but other than that followed the recipe. The crab cakes held together pretty well in the skillet, so that bit of advice (from the video) kept me from chickening out and adding more crackers and breadcrumbs. I wonder if they'll still hold together if I add some dill next time...
