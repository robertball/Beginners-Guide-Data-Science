I tried everything that this recipe called for,except I put a little twist in this dish...with a little help from my boyfriend who happens to have at least four years restaurant exp.I used one teaspoon of onion powder,a teaspoon of garlic powder,one package of Lipton onion soup mix,and of course can't forget one twelve ounce bottle of chili sauce,and two tablespoons of Worchestersire sauce.I combined all of these ingredients into the ground beef after browning the meat,then I layered it on the bottom of the casserole dish.Then I added all the mixed veggies,layered with shredded chedder cheese,then two cans of cream of celery soup and then I topped it all off with one bag of tator tots.I cooked this dish at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.

This is an okay basic recipe, but I browned the ground beef first, then mixed in 1/2 envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and 2 medium cloves of minced garlic (I am a garlic lover).  I put the beef mixture in the bottom of the dish, then layered canned French cut green beans and canned corn (both drained thoroughly).  I can't stand cream of chicken soup, so I mixed a can of cream of mushroom with a can of cheddar cheese soup and poured half the mixture over the meat and veggies. Then I added the tater tots on top and spread the remaining soup mixture over that and baked.  Husband loved it!

Good basic recipe that was different than my regular version of tater tot casserole. There was no way you could convince to to layer the uncooked beef in my casserole dish so I browned it first with onions and minced garlic. I used a pkg of mixed veggies that included carrots, corn and grn bean, followed by a layer of sharp cheddar cheese.  I needed a little milk to make the cream of chix soup to work a little better but I poured about 1/3 of my "soup mix" over the hamburger, then layered the tater tots, and then the remaining soup mix over all.  I baked 1/2 time covered and then another 35-40 minuted uncovered and it turned out really well. When your tired of your tater tot recipe - try this one. Its not drastically different but its still a filling and tasty homecooked meal! Thanks!

After reading so many reviews of people who wanted to cook off the ground beef prior to assembling, I decided to make the recipe as written. There was no danger in the beef not being cooked through, however, you must be ready for the "slab" effect and be ready to cut through it.  I also agree that you might want to season the dish with some of your favorite spices prior to cooking.  other than that, I was very happy with the dish. I will definitely make it again and probably add some seasoning and shredded cheddar to the cream of chicken soup.

This really hit the spot today.  I took some other reviewer's suggestions and cooked the hamburger and onions before putting them in the casserole. I baked it for 40 minutes and it was great.  Next time I will add a few seasonings. Thanks Sunny for sharing this recipe.

Several reviewers said they used two cans of soup.  I bet they meant two standard 10.75-ounce cans.  Note that the recipe calls for one 19-ounce can.  I also cooked and seasoned the meat and onion first, and reduced cooking time to 40 minutes.  A pretty good recipe.

I browned the beef and onions together. Added a bit of garlic salt and lawry's seasoning salt. I substituted cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chix soup. Mixed everything up, added some mild cheddar on top before adding the tater tots. It turned out awesome! Everybody loved it.

Very filling; didn't need a side dish. However, it was a little bland. Next time, I will take some reviewers' advice and add some spices or Lipton Onion soup. Make sure you note the size of the soup can - 19 ounces. We didn't notice that and just used one of the small cans and then wondered why it was kind of dry. Will definitely make again, with some adjustments.

So easy to make.  I added season salt to the hamburger and precooked the meat and it turned out great.  We could eat this again.

I always make new dishes exactly as they are written. I debated making this for a few weeks and finally tried it. It has potential, but it definitely needs spices. I would suggest to anyone making this for the first time to mix your soup, vegs and meat together instead of layering it, also, use canned mixed vegetables. I baked my frozen mixed vegetables for an hour and when they came out, they were still watery. The soup never made it to the beef. I had to bake it for an extra hour,

Excellent!  It was the first time I made this dish and my fiance said it was the best he ever had.  A great compliment from a midwest guy!  I browned the beef first (just past pink), seasoned each layer with salt, pepper, & a little garlic powder, used two cans of mushroom soup with a little milk, two handfuls of shredded cheese mixed into the soup with 1/3 cup sour cream, more salt & pepper and a some parmesean cheese.  It was fast and easy and the family loved it!

This is great on any day!  I brown the beef first with garlic and onion.  While that's browning, I mix the frozen veggies with a can of cream of mushroom, and a can of cream of celery.  After draining the grease from the beef, I add it to the soups/veggies and stir all together.  I then top with the tater tots, bake until the tots are a bit crispy on top.

I made this as is the first time and it was good, just lacked a little flare for my family. Then I did a twist and added a can of vegetarian chili and a can of corn instead of the frozen veggies and topped the tots with cheddar. It was really good.

Its a good basic recipe. I never cook anything right to the recipe. What I did with this dish was i browned my meat with minced garic and onion. Seasoned with creola seasoning & pepper. I took 1 can of cream of celery soup & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 10.5 ounces each and a 1/2 cup milk. Put that in a mixing bowl added mixed veggies, Meat mixture and I cubed up in small cubes Velveta Cheese 1/4 block and mixed all together. Put in pan and topped with Tater tots. Sprinkled top with some more cubes of Velveta and regular shredded cheese. Finally topped of with Frenchs Onion. Covered And baked at 350 for 25 min. uncoverd and baked 20 min more. It was a smash Hit everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.

This was good, but I will make adjustments with the recipe.  Such as four cups of frozen vegies was a bit much.  I think two to two and a half cups would be better for this recipe.  And instead of the one can of 19 ounce can of cream of chicken, I will use two 10.5 ounce cans.  It's just a couple more ounces, but do believe that will make a big difference.  In all though, it was really good.

Not a bad recipe with some additional ingredients.  Tater tot casserole is what it is.  It's never going to fabulous!  But, this recipe is pretty good.  This recipe wouldn't have been as good had I not added some minced garlic, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, a splash of worcestershire, a sprinkling of onion powder, and a handful of shredded cheddar.  I cooked my meat with the onion like others did then baked it for 50 minutes.  Note that the recipe calls for a 19 ounce can of soup.  I'm sure many people overlooked that and bought the usual 10 ounce can like I did.  Luckily I had a can of cream of mushroom soup on hand to add.  All in all, it was a nice way to get my toddler her beloved tater tots along with some veggies and meat.

Excellent dish! I did as some recommended and browned the beef first with minced onion and three minced garlic cloves, some pepper, and salt. I drained the grease from the beef and then mixed all the ingredients except for the tater tots - those were placed on top. But instead of full sized tater tots, all I had were "potato rounds."  These are tater tots shaped like a disc instead of a cylinder.   I also did not have mixed veggies, so I used half frozen peas and half frozen corn.

I did not care for this recipe. I should have browned and seasoned the beef first.  There wasn't that much taste to make up for the beef.

Mushroom soup I find is a better choice than the chicken soup.  I also mix in a green pepper as well.  And like everyone says, brown the meat a bit first to get rid of some of the grease, unless of course your buying extremely lean ground beef.

Good recipe!  Made some changes to make it lighter- ground turkey, 1 (10.5 oz) can reduced fat cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup non fat milk, and canned veggies. Cooked the turkey with onion prior to adding to casserole.

Good basic recipe but needs some jazzing up. I have made several times and these are the tweeks that made us all go YUM!!!Brown the hamburger with onion and garlic, use 1 can cheese soup and 1 can cream of mushroom (or cream of chicken), season the veggie/soup mix with some garlic and onion powder, Layer as directed but add a layer of cheddar cheese on top of the veggie layer and below the tot layer. Lightly season the tots with season'd salt. Serve wtih Franks Red Hot Sauce- oh so good!

My grandma makes a similar recipe and I was excited to make this for my niece. This recipe is great because you can really improvise as you go.  I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground turkey. I browned the meat with a whole white onion then placed ingredients in a bowl and mixed with 3/4 a large can of cream of chicken which I thinned out with milk and the mixed vegetables.  I added all the ingredients to the pan then place a layer of shredded cheddar cheese over the top then added the remainder of the soup which I then placed the frozen tater tots on the top.  I use and electric oven and found that I needed to let it cook for the full hour and 15 minutes.  My 5 year old niece loved the dish of course when I asked her she said she liked the top the best.

This was fast and delicious! I took others suggestions and cooked the meat with onions ahead of time, and used cream of mushroom. Even as leftovers it was good!!

I hate casseroles, but this was quick and easy for a busy weeknight. All of the kids and hubby loved this. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.

This recipe was okay, I browned the meat with the onion beforehand, but in general I thought it was kind of flavorless and boring.  It didn't quite live up to expectations, but I may mess around with the recipe a bit to see if I can make it work.

My entire family LOVED this casserole.  Because my husband and I are lactose intolerant, I substituted 2 small cans of Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken.  As suggested, I cooked the ground meat and onion (to drain the grease) ahead of time.  I will assuredly make this recipe again.

We also liked this one alot, however, it seems that one can of cream of chicken soup isn't enough to make it as creamy as I hoped for. I cooked the beef first, for less baking time and layered it a little differently. I also added sharp cheddar cheese about 5 minutes before it came out of the oven, if you prefer more creaminess add a little milk to the soup.

Definitely brown your ground beef first and add garlic and spices as others recommend.  The one change I make is sticking enough tater tots in the microwave to cover a plate, heat up and mash with a fork when done.  Mix mashed tater tots into meat + soup mixture.  It gives it a bit extra bulk and tater flavor.  We still then layer the tots on top as the recipe says.  I love this stuff!

Love this quick, easy dish.  There is no need to cook the ground beef prior to baking. I've made this dish several times and the meat is always cooked after the directed time.  I do add additional seasoning to the meat, use cream of mushroom soup (26oz can) and add shredded cheese on top! SO GOOD!

I made this recipe for a very picky eater!  My whole family loved it with just two minor changes.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also pan grilled the turkey and only cooked the casserole in the oven for 35 minutes.  I also added a layer of cheese below the tater tots!  Very yummy!

Awesome!!  Although I did cook my burger first and then added the onion soup mix, mushroom soup and cheese soup to the cooked meat.  Then did my layering.

My husband and picky two year old really liked this. I browned my hamburger with onion, garlic powder and salt and pepper. I also cubed up a little velveeta over the hamburger in the casserole dish and I also added some shredded cheddar on top of the tots towards the end of baking. But still very easy, will def make again!

VERY TASTY, Very easy!! I've made this a few times with varying ingredients and it's always been a hit.  Most recently I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added garlic and Worcestershire sauce while browning with onions, Then I mixed cream of celery and cream of mushroom (both 10oz cans) together, then added a bag of mixed veggies and a bag of mixed Asian veggies. Once mixed I layered the veggie soup blend on top of the cooked turkey, then topped with tater tots, cooked for 25 min covered.  I removed the cover and then added cheese to the top and cooked uncovered for 15 more minutes.  YUM!

Kick everything up a notch!!!!!!!!!!!!  I originally got this recipe from the Duggars website.  I knew when I looked at it, it needed seasoning etc.   I added a layer of cheese on top of the broccoli( I decided not to use multiple veggies as it would get soggy).  I also added shredded carrots and a dash of crumbled bacon that I had from the morning.  After the layer of cheese I then added the tator tots.    I  used 3/4 of evaporated milk as well as cream of mushroom/cream of chicken soup.    The next time I will use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup- just a preference.  I sauteed onions w/ garlic, onion powder and some seasoning salt.  You can look at this recipe and know it needs some flavor and I am glad I kicked it up a notch.

I tried awheeler's version of this...it definitely had flavor...although something was a bit more salty than I would usually eat.  The consistency was hot and gooey on the inside and crispy on the top.  It reminded me of shephard's pie with more crunch. However, the more I ate of it, the more I disliked it and we threw out at least half the pan.

This was an easy recipe.  I followed the directions and followed the advice of other reviews and super seasoned my meat. I also added half a cup of milk to the cream of mushroom, seasoned again and covered with cheese. I covered with tater tots, and then I sprinkled cheese over the tater tots as well.

Overall it was ok. Hubby didn't care for it. I think if I make some revisions next time it will turn out better. I did follow other suggestions and browned the meat with the onions first. I used frozen veggies (will use can next time). I also used cream of mushroom and put cheddar cheese on top of the soup mixture and then added the the tater tots. The tater tots turned out great; very crispy. Overall I would say it was still bland even after adding salt, pepper and garlic powder.

I was really excited about this recipe, but rather dissapointed with the end results. The casserole was decent, but the flavor was rather bland. I think it really needs some spice (perhaps salt & pepper) and some type of cheese in it. My husband suggested that I try it again next time with tomato soup in place of the cream of chicken, which I might do. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't make this one again. Thanks anyway!

My picky kids really liked this!  I browned the beef with seasoning, garlic & onion, then used cheese soup mixed with some milk, topped with shredded cheese.  I also used canned green beans, corn & carrots, as my kids hate frozen vegetables.  My boys said this was a keeper!

Great idea, but a few additions make it even more tasty!
I used vension, which I browned with garlic, celery, 2 cans mushrooms and 1 onion. I added a beef boullion cube and corn starch, which turned it into a tasty gravy. Then, I added frozen peas and let that simmer for about 20 min. After that I followed the given directions, only cooking it for 40 minutes- the whole hour would have made the tater tots more crispy and nice, so that's what I'll do next time. Great comfort food, my boyfriend loves it too!

I HAVE to give this a five because my bf loved it so much...I couldn't eat that much of it because it seemed too rich.  The only thing different that I did was omitted the beef (we're a vegetarian family).  Will definately make again...

This recipe was just "okay".  It was pretty bland...needs something.  I think maybe it would be good to fry the meat ahead of time with some spices:  garlic powder, worcestershire sauce and pepper and add some cheese to the layers.  I would probably make this again using the above suggestions.

Couldn't believe I wouldn't have to cook the meat first but it wasn't a problem. I did make it in AM, refrigerate and increase cooking time to 1 1/2 hr.  Used 2 cans of soup.

This recipe is very good as is. However, I do dress mine up a little bit when I make it just to give it more flavor. I add a package of onion soup mix to the uncooked hamburger and stamp the meat into the bottom the casserole dish. Then add the onion and mixed veggies, a layer of shredded cheddar cheese, cream of chicken soup, and finally the tots. Delicious!!

My family loves tator tot casserole. We do it differently though. I cook the meat with garlic powder, salt, pepper, onions, and bell peppers. After I drain the grease I put it back in the pan and I add a family sized can off cream of chicken soup and cook it on medium heat for about 10 minutes. I line my baking dish with tator tots then spread my mixture over the top. Then I put 2 lbs of sharp Cheddar cheese and bake it on 375 for about 20 minutes.its fantastic this way.

Not bad but I made lots of alterations. Browned the hamburger with the onion and a half a packet of onion soup mix. Drained, returned to pan and added a can of mushroom soup. Poured mixture into a 9x13 sprinkled w/ Parmesan. Added a layer of frozen french cut green beans and sprinkled a cup of cheddar on top of that. Put the frozen taters on top of that and sprinkled with another cup of cheddar. Mixed another can of mushroom soup (10 oz.) with a few tablespoons of milk and poured over tots. Sprinkled ANOTHER cup of cheddar on top. Baked covered for the first 30 and uncovered the remaining time. It was pretty good but still seems like it's missing something! Next time I will add fresh mushrooms and scale back the cheese. (Only by one layer.) Maybe add a few shakes of A1 to the meat mixture.. great recipe to start with and make your own :)

Easy!  My husband loved.  We used 2 cans of french green beans, 1 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup and 1# venison.  We cooked venison and 1/2 cup chopped onion first and then I layered the green beans, added soup and topped off with tater tots.  Oh, I also added worcestershire sauce to dish.

This is really a great recipe to take care of things in our freezer that need to be used!  I substituted frozen meatballs for the meat, and added spices and Campbell's Cheddar Cheese and Creamy Mushroom soups, and also added milk and shredded cheddar as suggested by another review.  Threw in some mixed veggies right before I topped it with the tater tots, and it was great!  Speedy to make too!

At first I was a little weary about adding raw beef to the casserole, however that is what I did and with just a few more minutes than the recommended time the beef was perfectly fine. I did make a few alterations to my version of this casserole. Due to the reviews I did add a healthy amount of seasoning to my beef as well as 2 medium cloves of garlic mixed with the onion. Since I did not realize the recipe called for a 19 oz can of chicken soup I added a can of milk to the regular size can. I also added a light amount of butter to the layer of vegetables, added the tater tots, and baked for about an hour and 10 minutes. In the last 5 minutes I did add shredded cheddar cheese to the top of the tater tots as well. With these few modifications this recipe was definitely a keeper, even my picky husband really enjoyed this dish!

I didn't do anything but follow this recipie then read reviews which made me worry. I turned the heat up when it was half way done and it doesn't hurt to use a rack on the bottom. Remember to cover it so it won't burn. I added a personal touch five minutes befor it was done...I used garlic seasoning and mild chedder cheese over the tater tots when they were bubbly then coeked for the rest of the hour uncovered. This helped a lot and it was actually very, very good.

I took some of the suggestions; 1. browned the meat with garlic and onions.  2. added a can of cheddar cheese soup.  My husband and I both thought this dish was bland.  I'd definitely recommend spicing up the meat and adding real cheese.

The alterations I made was that I browned the beef first, drained it, then added 1 envelope dry onion soup mix, 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of mushroom soup and left the onion out. I also added half a small can of French fried onions to the top which was added at the last 10 minutes of cooking along with a generous sprinkling of Cheddar cheese.

Good recipe.  I cooked the hamburger first with lawry salt, garlic powder and minced onion.  I also use cream of chicken soup instead and top with low fat shredded cheddar cheese.

I made this for dinner last night, but I tweaked it for added flavor.  I seasoned the ground beef with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  Then on top of that I added dry french fried onions.  Also, I used frozen corn and greenbeans.  I used two cns of cream of chicken and put some fresh shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top of that.  I also used a bigger pan than the 9 x 13 nd it cooked faster.  My whole family loved it.

I have been making this same recipe for years. One of my kids favorites. The beauty of this recipe is not having to cook the hamburger! Everything in one pan no mess, and its easy to take uncooked to a freinds house and just throw it in the oven. I also put the soup on first and than the veggies, its a bit easier.

This wasn't bad. I followed the instructions except for adding some salt and pepper to the meat and subbing the mixed veggis for a boccoli/cauliflower mix that I had onhand. It was a little bland. Next time I make it I will definately play with the seasoning some more.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I always brown ground meat first and season it up with seasoned salt pepper and garlic powder.  I also add a little more cream of chicken soup and onion than called for.

Looks like it would be good, but after one hour @ 375, hamberger was raw.  Raise the temp and cooked for longer.  An hour just dosen't cut it.

WONDERFUL!!  I made it for my baby boomer parents and they ate not just seconds, but thirds!  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom instead.  It was super easy to make.  I made it the night before and put it in the fridge.  A very simple comfort food recipe!

bland.  It would be better if I had sauteed the beef with the onions. and possibly added some grated chedder cheeze at the end.  Maybe even chedder cheeze soup instead of the cream of vegetable.  I won't try it again though.

We used cream of mushroom soup instead, added some celery, spiced it up with garlic and some italian seasoning.  Instead of layering, just stir it all together.  Add tater tots on top of mixture and smother with shredded cheddar cheese!

Kids will love this if they don't mind their food mixed together.  I add one more can of soup, 10 oz of milk and some garlic powder for flavor.  A layer of chopped onion over the beef is good, too.  Also, definitely bown the beef first and cut down cooking time.

Great recipe. I used ground pork and cooked it first. My husband loved it but my son wasn't crazy about everything touching. Once I separated the tater tots he liked it. I'll defintely make it again. Needs to be spiced up a bit...garlic, cajun spice etc.

My family really enjoyed this after they got over the idea that the only way to eat tater tots is by themselves with ketchup.  However, I did use 2 cans of soup because we like it with more sauce. Also, instead of cooking the meat, just spread it thinner.  I think the meat cooking with it adds to the flavor.

This was delicious! It was a hit with my very picky kids. I did change two things, 1. I sprinkled salt on the (uncooked) ground beef. 2. I add two cups of shredded cheddar cheese. One cup layered between the veggies &  soup, and one cup sprinkled over the top 5 min before it came out of the oven. My only regret was that I only made one pan the kids ate it up quick!

Basic recipe, but after numerous church pot lucks, there are expectations. It needs extra onion, sour cream and cheddar cheese.  A little crispy bacon doesn’t hurt.

I made this after hearing a lot of Friends and Co-Workers talking about it and it was great , it was gone in minutes, I need to double the recipe next time for sure.

I'm not a fan of cream of mushroom soup, but you can't even taste it, great quick and easy dinner.

I too cooked the hamburger and onion first. Used one can cream of mushroom and one can French onion soup. Covered with Colby/jack before I put the tots on. Just about the best casserole I've made.the French onion soup gave it great flavor. Will be making again.

This was really good and I will definitely make it again-and it got the BF approval!
I did pre-cook the meat and onions and season with salt & pepper. I also used one 10.5 can of the Cream of Chicken  and one 10.5 can of Cream of Celery.
It was really good! Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

We love this stuff and actually you can get away with only using 1/2 pound of ground beef so it is very economical. We've experimented with different condensed soups. Plain cheddar or nacho flavors are very good. They used to make a white queso with green chile but we can't find that anymore and that was probably our favorite. I think next time I'll try some 505 green chile instead of a soup. This is easy comfort food and we always have the ingredients on hand. My kids are always happy when I make this and it is super easy, so a big winner in my book.

Nice comfy dinner that my 12 year old made all by himself. Against my better judgement, he followed the recipe (MY mom always browned the ground beef first!) except we subbed Cream Soup Base recipe from this site for the canned soup. Turned out delicious.

I used 1 can of mix vegetables & 1 can of corn. I browned the beef with onion, and seasoned with onion powder, pepper, and nature seasons. In large mixing bowl, I mixed 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 soup can of milk, vegetables, big dash of Worcestershire, shredded cheddar cheese, season and mix. Add drained hamburger, mix well. Baked in metal 9x13 cake pan at 350 covered w/foil for 35 minutes. Uncovered, raised temperature to 375 and baked another 20 minutes. Very good, will make again

This is one of those recipes that will always be a hit with young & old, my seniors at the local senior center loved it. It is also a recipe that you can play with by adding tons of additoinal ingredients to and it will still be a winner. Thanks for sharing!

Great! My only change was using 1 10 oz can of cream of mushroom and 1 10 oz can of cream of chicken and sprinkled a little salt, pepper and dried basil before laying down the tater tots. It was easy enough for my son to make with me!

I did not cook the beef first and it was fine.  But, no need for the cooking spray.  I enjoyed how patting the uncooked beef into the bottom of the pan made a great base to hold everything together when serving.  As others have done, I simply added some garlic salt, pepper, cayenne, and onion powder to the beef.  When the casserole was done, let it rest about 5 to 10 minutes.  While doing that, I put a few Kraft American Cheese slices on top..  This was very good, just like my mom used to make.  Thank you Mrs. G.

I caramelized the onions first with a bit of brown sugar as well before adding them on top of the ground beef. I also added lipton onion soup mix to the ground beef, however I did not brown in advance, I just put it in the oven. The ground beef with soup mix and any other spices, the onions, then the frozen vegetables (I used peas, broccoli, carrots and cauliflower) add the cream of chicken soup on top and then just finish off with some tater tots it was really good, a good mixture of flavours. I also added cheese to the top in the last 10 minutes, because what is a casserole without cheese.

I added a little milk, sour cream, and grated sharp cheddar cheese to the mix. Then topped it with the remaining cheddar cheese. It helped add a lot of flavor. I also cooked the hamburger prior to baking! It cut down on my cook time and was more flavorful with less grease.

So I followed the basic ingredients with a twist. Ground chicken which I cooked ahead of time in the skillet with garlic and onion. Added seasoning. Then did frozen broccoli, cauliflower, carrots mix and condensed cream of mushroom. It was delish and the man was happy to.

i did cook the beef and onion in a pan first as suggested and then near the end of the layering i added a layer of 2 cups shredded cheddar before topping it with the tots. kind of more like a cheeseburger casserole.  also i didn't have cream of chicken so i used cream of mushroom.

This is really good.  I used ground turkey and cooked it in a skillet with a little garlic and onion powder.  I skipped the onion and mixed the turkey, veggies and soup together (I used 2 cans of Healthy Request Cream of Chicken) and topped that with the tots.  I baked it for 40 minutes since the meat was already cooked.  It came out great! I'll for sure be making it again!

This is a great dish but I cook the meat with onions, little garlic, and celery salt. I use cream of mushroom. Once its done I leave a bowl of sharp cheddar because my husband love this dish with cheese! OH and my family hunts so I use our ground deer meet instead of cow.

my mom used to make a variation of this when i was a kid. instead of using cream of mushroom soup, she used cheese sauce made by campbells. i precook the meat, add worcestershire sauce to mine and use nacho sauce instead of soup. I LOVE IT and so does my family. tons of flavor, very filling, and incredibly simple.

I have never made tater tot casserole before, but I decided to try it for a quick and yummy dish! With some modifications this dish was delicious! Even my 21 month old twins loved it. I Cooked the meat with the onion, garlic, and a little bit of paprika. Then when I got to the soup layer I added a little bit more garlic powder and a little but of pepper. My family loves garlic so it made it tasty for us! Then I salted the tator tots just a little and it was great!

KID FRIENDLY! This was good but I did add some seasonings to the browned meat. I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and one can of cream of chicken soup. I used a 1 12 oz bag of mixed veggies which was about 2 cups and used crispy rounds instead of tater tots. It was just what I was looking for. I had something like this when I was a kid and had been wanting to make it for my girls, 3 and 1. Both girls loved it and I liked that it had veggies as opposed to other tater tot casseroles I have found. It was easy to make. I will deffinately make again.

Used other reviewers advice and browned the meat with onion and some minced garlic before baking. I also used two cans french cut green beans, and two cans cream of mushroom soup. Instead of using mixed frozen veggiess and the cream of chicken. Everyone loved it!

Great recipe! I used some of the reviewers suggestions and added the soup mix in with the pre-browned hamburger. This was very easy to make. I prepared the meat the night before so I wasn't in the kitchen the entire time my company was visiting. I will be making this again!

I seasoned the meat with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I used one can cream of chicken soup and one can cheddar soup.  I did not include the vegetables in this recipe.  It was a good recipe, and it would be easy to change up with different seasonings and soup mixes.  I also made this with ground turkey meat, which I seasoned and cooked prior to putting in the baking dish.

Husband raved about this recipe! I cooked the hamburger and onion beforehand. I did as a reviewer suggested and mixed together a can of cream of mushroom with a can of cheese soup. I also added shredded cheese on top! Very good!!!

Pretty good - perfect for a cold New England night!  I browned the hamburg with onion and garlic powder, and added frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower.  Also sprinkled with a little cheddar cheese.  Yummm!

I make this recipe, but always cook and drain the hamburger ahead. Also, we like it made with cream of mushroom and cheddar cheese soup, sometimes I use 2 cans of cheese soup with alittle milk.
We really love the cheese flavor with this recipe.

I made this recipe a little different.  I browned the meat, added the frozen vegetables - cooked.  Put the onions and soup over it and put it in the fridge.

When I came home, I added the potato tots and cooked it at 350 for one hour.  It was very good.  It's nice to be able to make it ahead of time.

What a great meal in one dish. So easy to prepare and all family members gobbled it up including my toddlers.  For the ground beef on bottom I used frozen meatballs from Costco.  They were already seasoned which I mashed upon the bottom.  I'LL make again and would like to try mushroom soup and grated cheese on top of tator tots next time.

Excellent! I substituted Krumbles (soy meat) for the beef, and it was fine. This dish doesn't pretend to be fancy, and it isn't; that's the appeal! It is merely hearty, tasty, stick-to-your-ribs fare, that was a SNAP to make.

Yuck.  I wanted the creamy, comfort food that my mom used to make and this was just layered bland beef (even with the onion and red pepper I added), vegetables and tator tots....won't make again.  If I attempted again I would use more soup, cheddar cheese in the soup and mix the veggies, browned beef all together, then put the tator tots on top and add more soup and cheese.  Not healthy, but much more tasty.

A most excellent dish, fast and easy, with lots of room to experiment with.
A few changes that I did, was to add garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, amarito liqueur (just a splash) to the meat.
I didn’t, have the chicken soup so I used mushroom instead with yellow cheese below the tots.

I browned the ground beef and onions together and drained off the fat, then added the frozen mixed vegetables and one can of cream of chicken soup. I poured it all in a casserole dish and topped it with the tater tots.  Baked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect. It is a quick dish to make and has everything in it for a good dinner, fast! I have already made it twice.

Easy to make! Frozen veggies were corn and broccoli and my son loves it. Broccoli is like death to me so no way I’m eating it, so the rating is his

Yummy.  I upped the flavor by using 2 ten ounce cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup. I also seasoned the meat before browning and layering in the baking dish.

I changed it up a bit and browned the ground beef first.It was too greasy used uncooked. Put it in bottom of casserole dish, then just put corn on top of it covered by a good bit of shredded cheddar cheese. Then put the tater tots on top. Grandsons love it and whole family.

omitted mixed veggies, used 1 can on cream of garlic mushroom soup, then a layer of shredded cheese (your choice) then tots on top, some shrinkage will occur as the beef cooks, use cream of onion soup if you wish or 1/2 and 1/2 of the cream soups of your choosing

Absolutely loved it. I have very picky eaters who ate this without a fight and asked for seconds. My inlaws thought this tasted a lot like potato pancakes. We added sour cream and chives once cooked. Definitely will be making again.

Very good!  I also browned the ground beef along with the onion and a clove of minced garlic then mixed it with the soup and threw in a handful (about a cup) before putting it in the baking dish, topped it with the tater tots and then crushed some French’s fried onions on top of that.  Next time I will also mix some French’s fried onions into the ground beef mixture.  (It’s good in a green bean casserole so why not?!!). This is a great recipe that you can tweak with many options.

It was very good! My 3 yr granddaughter had fun helping me spread the ingredients out . I added shredded cheddar over the hamburger.  At the end of baking, I added more cheese to melt on top. The tater tots stayed crispy. Fun, easy and yummy.

I don't know why everyone is freaked out about the meat going in the oven without browning it first.... that's how you make meatloaf after all isn't it? To me this just tastes like meatloaf with tater tots and it is just fine. Does need some spicing up for my taste so next time I will add some onion soup or similar.

I took this basic recipe and tweeked it. The result was delicious!  I first added sauted minced onion to the ground beef along with some minced garlic. As for the tatertots ~ let's just say I stepped it up a notch by adding a medium jar of medium spicy salsa and some cilantro. I basically took my tatertots, cream of mushroom soup, salsa, 2 c of grated cheddar ~ mixed them all together in a bowl and then spread the mixture on top of the ground beef and baked for 45 as directed in the recipe. I didn't do any fancy arranging of the tatertots. It was so yummy!  My husband loved it as did my coworkers when I brought in some of the leftovers.

Chicken soup mixed vegetables just ruined it for us
Chicken soup with beef just didn't seem right

We tried again
Mushroom soup no mixed veg
Cooked ground beef first with onion in fry pan
Sprinkled cheese on top of meat layer

Much better!

2 stars before tweaking it. As it reads, it clearly lacks flavor or seasoning. I cook the meat ahead with onion, garlic, worcestershire, an envelope of beefy onion soup mix, a little ketchup, onion and garlic powder. The veggies need a little salt. I use cream of mushroom soup then a couple of cups of shredded cracker barrel cheddar, and top with ore ida extra crispy tots. Sometimes, I only use canned green beans and corn instead of the frozen mixed veggies. If using the canned veggies, I dont add salt to them. Lightly salt the tots when it comes out of the oven. You would do that if you were having them any other way. If they aren't crispy enough,  turn on the broiler for a minute or two. My grandchildren give it 10 stars. LOL

While my husband loved it, I was not so keen on it. The only changes made were using cooked ground turkey and unfrozen vegetables.  Maybe it was the different types of vegetables that I used. I am thinking that next time I will just stick with peas...maybe that will be better? We will see.

This recipe is soooo easy. The first time I pre-browned the hamburger with the onion and it was great.... that took a little extra time tho. 
The second time I made it this week I just put the hamburger in the pan as directions called for. I used two onions chopped fairly large and 3 cans of mushroom soup instead.... I liked the mushroom soup switch better. Next time I’ll layer some fresh sliced mushrooms onto the veggies too. It is best to place the tater tots on it and not just dump them on and try to smooth out. 

Hash browns instead of tater tot s will be my next variation that I try.  Either way it must have been good, my room mate cleaned them both up....each time. I was able to have 3 servings out of two batches. Lmao. I love the recipe for its ease

As others did, I altered the recipe by sautéing garlic, onion and peppers in a separate pan with butter and Worcestershire and then adding to the beef after browning.  Looks good and once or cools down I hope it tastes great!  Also cooked on 350 for 45 minutes then used the broiler for 5 to brown tots on top.

A great crowd pleaser. I made the recipe in a 2 qt baking dish. I sprinkled some steak flavoring into the ground beef while it cooked. Added some taste. Also used just enough tater tots for one layer. Baked till tots started to brown. No left overs - WOW. How often does that happen? This dish will go into my meal plan rotation.

This recipe is super easy, especially during the weeknights when cooking is such a hassle. I made a few small changes, which were suggested by another reviewer. 

I browned the ground beef and onions ahead of time, and seasoned to taste with garlic salt, sea salt, and onion powder. I try to stay away from anything with MSG, yeast extract, or similar additives; so I use Pacific brand cream of chicken soup. Otherwise, I stuck to the main ingredients.

Since I browned the beef ahead of time, that cut the cooking time almost in half. I baked it uncovered for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. I then put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes since we like the tater tots to be crispy. Everyone loved it, which is quite an accomplishment!

Thanks for the recipe!

My version was good. I browned the hamburger meat first. This cut the cooking time in half and prevented a casserole dish full of hamburger grease. I also added cheese, because no casserole should go without cheese! It was a very simple and filling dish. Will be making it again!

This was pretty bad following the recipe exactly.  It's a good idea though.  Next time I'm going to try mixing an egg in with the beef and maybe some onion soup mix.  Or cooking the beef first like others have suggested.

06/26/2013 I tried this using the ingredients shown in the recipe. It was "OK" but not something I will make again without modification. Following the directions produces a hamburger patty topped with onions vegetables and tater tots. Also the finished product is quite bland as their are no seasonings used. The finished product also had liquid sitting in the bottom of the casserole dish probably due to the moisture in the frozen vegetables. I will be making this again in a few weeks with modifications and I will continue this review.

I wasn't a fan of this.  Hubby and I tried it for dinner and we had one serving each and decided we really weren't crazy about it.  We even tried to add slices of american cheese on top to give it a little more taste but alas it didn't do anything for it.

As a busy and most of the time an exhausted Mom, I rate this awesome! This recipe was so easy that I had my oldest son put it together. It was nice to come home after work to dinner already in the oven. He followed the recipe as written. While we were all devouring it, we each put a twist on the possibilities with this recipe. You can do tons of things. Wow! I have to say this will be on the menu 2 to 3 times per month. :)

I have to say I did not care for this one. I cant imagine how bland this would taste if you didnt take the review suggestions. I browned the ground beef & onion adding a packet of dry onion soup mix, garlic salt & worcestershire sauce. I added a layer of cheddar cheese also.  I wont be making this one again. It sounded better than it tasted.

My husband loved this recipe.  I read several reviews before making it about "adding flavor" so I sauted onion and celery in a pan before adding the ground beef.  I also seasoned the beef with lawry's salt while browning. Instead of using just cream of chicken soup, I used one small can of cream of chicken with herbs and one small can of cream of mushroom and added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese before layering the tots on top. Also, instead of using frozen veggies, I just dumped in a can each of green beans, corn and peas.  It turned out great.

i made this one for the guys and used their ground venison/pork mixture. couldnt even tell it wasnt beef. i browned the meat, mixed all ingredients together i pan. put mixture in baking dish, topped w/ some cheddar and tots. turned out pretty good. no exactly the healthiest, but the guys liked it! also, i used cream of mushroom instead. and actually the last time i made this i must have accidentally bought cream of celery, and it turned out just as good w/ that.

We love quick and easy casseroles such as this!  However, we are also big on flavor so in order to add a bit more to this recipe I season the hamburger while cooking with parsley flakes, garlic powder and basil.  I also buy the family size cans of soup and use one of them in each batch.  Yummy!

The top half was really good.  We used canned green beans and tater tot rounds (the short flat ones).  We also sprinkled some hamburger seasoning on the meat, but it didn't really have any flavor.  This would be good if you played with the meat seasoning a bit.

This was NOT good at all.  I'm not sure what it was...maybe the vegetables or something; but I will NOT make this again.  Thanks anyway.

This has become a quick & easy weeknight favorite at our house. I love the fact that you don't have to brown the hamburger before hand. Just throw it all together & do other things while it bakes. I do sprinkle the meat with garlic salt & pepper before I layer the other ingredients. This is one of my husband's all-time favorites. Thanks Sunny!

I love this casserole, My mom used to make it all the time. But my mom put cream of mushroom soup in it, and my husband doesn't like cream of mushroom soup. (of course I love it!) maybe he would like the cream of chicken soup with it instead

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this! Very bland. A good amount of seasoning should be mixed through the meat before putting it in bottom of dish. Also it took well over an hour to cook, and still the Tots were very soft, so I stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes. That did the trick. Probably would not make this again.

I used AUTUMNDELIGHTS suggestions and then melted a little cheddar cheese on top. It was very heavy. We used 2 10.75 oz cans of soup, but my husband and I still thought it needed more sauce. Next time I'll cut back on the meat a little, add a lot more veggies, and extra soup.

I found this to be fairly bland even with cooking the meat first and seasoning well. I did use "crowns" or hash rounds which came out very crispy.

THis recepie was not that great.  I'm the Queen of using spices in my cooking for loads of flavor, but this was just too plain. The ground beef at the bottom tasted like a plain hamburger-(I wanted cheese, katchup and a bun) the tator tots were alright baked on top, but the soup made the bottoms soggy.  Again, I wanted katchup to dip them in.  This is a recepie I tossed in the trash.  Sorry-

I made the mistake of trying to make the tater tots myself. Other than that it was good but I had to add extra seasoning for more flavor. My three year old tried to pick out all the different vegatables.:)

It tastes like it must have taken longer to make!  The vegetables were a bit undercooked (even after an hour), so I might trying thawing them first next time.

I thought this was a good family meal, but my husband didn't like all of his food touching each other, so it's probably not something I'm going to make again.  The soup sorta tasted like cheese on the vegetables.  :)

Excellent recipe! Very easy. I used 2 cans of standard size cream of chicken soup and instead of frozen veggies I used 2 cans of mixed.  Also the tators I used were more like a pound and half instead of 2 pounds. Although I am betting many kids will like this mine is not fond of a meal wear "everything is touching" each other.
