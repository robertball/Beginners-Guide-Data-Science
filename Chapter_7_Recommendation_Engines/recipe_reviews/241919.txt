The above recipe, on its own, is bland.  I added salt/pepper, garlic and dill.  That made it pop!
Will make again!

This was good! I opted to use this as a dip for tortilla chips, and that worked very well. I did add some salt, but that was my preference and my only change. This is on the thicker side, so to use it as a dressing you may have to thin it out a bit more. Thanks for sharing. :)
