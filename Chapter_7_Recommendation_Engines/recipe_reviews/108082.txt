Wow, yummy! This is the best dish I have made yet with quinoa. I reduced the quinoa to 1 c. (in 2 c. chicken stock instead of water), used balsamic vinegar instead of white, 1 c. dried cranberries instead of raisins, tobasco instead of cayenne, and added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I also toasted the pecans before adding them. This was fabulous - definitely a keeper.

I love the prominent flavor the sesame oil gives to this salad.  The second flavor that comes to the palate is lemon.   With the crunch of the celery, nuts, and sweetness of the fruit it makes a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. I did use craisins that I chopped, and I toasted the pecans.  I had the leftovers for lunch and added grilled chicken strips and fresh blueberries.  Fabulous salad that is very versatile. I will make this often.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this today to take to a potluck hosted by a friend who has celiac disease.  I received lots of compliments and I really enjoyed it myself!  The sesame oil makes all the difference.  It would also be great to alter with different nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc.  Enjoy!

I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, and toasted the pecans before adding them to bring out their flavor. This was delicious!

This is a yummy salad.  I omitted the sesame oil and added a bit of curry powder.  I rolled it inside some butter leaf lettuce.

WOAH BABY this is yummy! I love quinoa and am always looking for new ways to prepare it. Instead of raisins I added chopped dried apricots and toasted sunflower seeds/walnuts instead of pecans. I agree that 1 TBSP is plenty of sesame oil and I also found 2 TBSP of lemon juice a bit much so I added a little honey. The scallions are a must! No cilantro for me since I have a STRONG STRONG dislike of the stuff. A great recipe that is adaptable to a person's likes and whatever is hanging out in the cupboard. Thanks Natalie17!

I used almonds instead of pecans and added dried apricots.  I think almost any combination of fruit and nuts would work - so use what you like.  The sesame is a dominant taste but one I enjoyed.  I think the salad tastes better the next day.

Very interesting combination of flavors. I used more cilantro and extra pecans and celery for crunch. I followed others advice and used half of the sesame oil and it was plenty. My vegetarian husband scarfed it down. Will make again and again.

I've made this recipe many times now that it's always a hit! I love the taste of the sesame oil combined with the dried fruit. I mix it up with whatever veggies I have on hand...The only problem with the recipe as is is that the amount of water is too much. The quinoa turns out soggy. As a rule of thumb with quinoa, I double the amount of water (to amount of quinoa) and it turns out perfect! Great recipe!

This is a unique and delicious salad that is given a slightly nutty/smoky flavor by the sesame seeds.  Hard to stop eating. As with many other recipes that call for raisins - we substituted craisins.

I made it as written and it was good, but I ended up adding a bit more lemon, vinegar and cilantro for more flavor.  I also toasted the pecans. It was awesome the next day!  Thanks for a good, healthy recipe.

I used 1 c. chicken broth and 2.5 c. water, craisins instead of raisins, almonds instead of pecans, and balsamic vinegar instead of white.  While I made some changes, I think the base of the recipe is very solid -- as other reviewers have said, most dried fruits and nuts would probably work great in this recipe.  I was hesitant about the sesame oil, but it really works!

Amazing!!  I used the red quinoa.  Wonderful nutty flavor. I used half dates and half raisins. Great taste.  UPDATE:  I am going to add some pineapple chunks next time.

I had never tried quinoa before, but found that I enjoyed this very much.  I enjoyed this salad several times this week.  This is a very versatile recipe that can be altered to work with the ingredients  you have on hand.  I have skipped the celery because I didn't have it, subbed sweet onion for the green onions (didn't have those either), added dried cranberries and toasted slivered almonds instead of raisins and pecans.  I've never added the sesame oil because I can't find it in my little grocery store.  Of all the changes I've made, I would never, ever omit the cilantro!  It really makes the dish.  As another reviewer mentioned, the flavor is much, much better the next day.

Don't try this recipe warm. It was just ok but kinda weird. I cooked the celery and added a few portebella mushrooms to olive oil. After a few minutes I added the pecans. When the quinoa was almost done I added the raisins to it. When it was done, I added the celery mixture, sesame oil, vinegar, lemon juice, pepper and parsley to the quinoa. Let set a few minutes then ate with a piece of chicken, I will see how leftovers are tomorrow but don't recommend doing the way I did.

This dish just doesn't cut it. The only change I made was dried cranberries instead of raisins since that is all I had. I was very disappointed. I then added some mandarin oranges which definitely improve the dish, but it still needs something. I think a different dressing. I am slowly eating it as it is a relatively healthy dish with high protein, but I will not be making this one again.

This was great! I used a handful of Craisins & a handful of golden raisins. I didn't have pecans, so used walnuts. I substituted EVOO for the vegetable oil and unfortunately didn't have sesame oil either (but I'm sure that lends an awesome flavor). I used a key lime EVOO instead and rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. I love versatile dishes like this that allow easy substitutions & variations. Will definitely make this again.

Tasty salad that was extremely easy to make and a bit hit at a staff potluck.  I tripled the recipe.  Since i made this as a last minute thought, I ended up making some substitutions/revisions: I cooked my quinoa in a microwave rice cooker (which cooks rice and quinoa perfectly!) and substituted the water with chicken stock.  I didn't have green onions but added celery, red peppers, craisins, and frozen peas which I nuked slightly i the microwave before adding.  I mixed the oil, vinegar, lemon juice and sesame oil in a bowl before adding it to the quinoa.  After mixing everything together, I added some salt and pepper, then I let it sit over night.   In the morning, I ended up adding cumin and I found that really helped to round out the flavours!  Chopped cilantro, sesame seeds and toasted cashews were added just before serving.  Delicious!!

Unless you really, really like seasame, cut down on the seasame oil.  2T is way too much.  It overpowers the entire dish.

I had a salad very much like this when lunch was catered at work recently.  I added craisins, grated carrot and substituted the white vinegar for balsamic.    It was good, but my family wasn't too thrilled with it even though they ate it.  I suspect that it had more to do with "it's healthy" rather than the actual taste.

Fantastic Salad!  I made it exactly as written, with no changes and it was perfect. We are trying to work more whole grains into our diet and this salad is wonderful.

This was a great way to inroduce quinoa to the nonbelievers!  I used dried cranberries and cherries because i had them.  I also had some red quinoa so I used that and added some of the yellow or regular quinoa.  It was very colorful and appetizing with the fruit and greens. I made the full recipe for 3 of us and took the rest to work the next day. Two of my co workers had it with their lunch and took some home for their family members to taste to turn them into believers of quionoa also! I pointed them to allrecipes and this one

My husband and I both enjoyed this salad. I used toasted walnuts that I candied using honey. I also used a leek instead of green onions since that is what I had on hand.  I agree with other users that said that sesame oil is a must.

I really enjoyed this.  I used red quinoa, golden raisins, and substituted red wine vinegar for the distilled white.  Will definitely make again!

I thought the flavors of this salad were pretty good.I have been making grains like this ALOT lately.  To me the recipe has to have a dried fruit, some crunch from veggies, and a nut to be really good.  To be great crumbled cheese would be in it too.  For this I made as written except to only use 1 C. quinoa, 1 green onion, and craisins instead of raisins.  Would be good with some crumbeled feta I imagine.

I had to adjust with what I had on hand and adjusted to my taste, so it was pretty different, but it was so tasty, I thought I'd share...I grated in some orange zest, used 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 lemon juice, used less sesame oil, added grated ginger and a tsp of soy.  I also used craisins, green and red onion, b/c I used red quinoa (I dislike it when eating leftovers that craisins and red onion have blead into the dish.) I didn't have celery on hand, so I didn't add that.

This is a good basic Quinoa Salad recipe. Definitely let the quinoa cool more than 20 minutes, though. It was still pretty hot at that point otherwise. I liked the crunch and taste of the pecans, but overall the salad lacked flavor to me. I think using a toasted sesame oil instead of regular might help some. Maybe even a pinch of fresh ginger might be good. I'll need to experiment. It's got a nice mild flavor and great texture with a little sweetness. I just prefer something with a little more ooomph.

Very good salad! We added additional cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit more and I'll add some minced garlic next time I make it... but all in all a healthy, delicious salad.

I enjoyed this, but had to play with a bit before I felt the "wow" factor. Doubled the lemon and sesame and used chili oil rather than cayenne powder. With a dash of curry this was great with cashews and diced dried apricots. This is one of those recipes that offers a a wonderful "base" for whatever fruits, proteins or herbs you are in the mood for.

I made this recipe using craisins and toasted the quinoa for extra flavour.  I also used maple balsamic vinegar instead of white and lime juice instead of lemon.  My brother, who doesn't like grains, went back for seconds!  I loved this and will definately make it again.  Took the leftovers in my lunch the next day and it was even better!!!

I love the lemon and the sesame oil flavors  with the sweet from the fruit and the plus the crunch of the nuts and celery.  I rinsed the red quinoa before cooking (and added a bit of veg stock to the water.) A couple changes to use what I had on hand - I ommitted the onions, used balsamic instead of white vinegar, used EVOO instead of veg oil, added craisins, dried apricots, and dried blueberries instead of raisins, and used both toasted almonds and pecans.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used some frozen cubes of chopped cilantro from Trader Joe's. Fresh cilantro would have been that much better!

This is fantastic stuff!  I omitted the vegetable oil and used unfiltered, natural apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I wasn't too sure of it the first time I tried it, but after it sat in the fridge a day or two and the flavors blended, it was really, really good!  You might want to back off on the onions.  The longer they sat, the stronger they became.

I made this with dried cranberries, and it was very good!  Next time, I think I'll try using less sesame oil, since it was a little too strong using the given quantity.

Very tasty dish.  I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins as that was what I had on hand and I may have left out the nuts because I didn't have them.  I will definitely make this again.

Not bad.  The fundamental problem, of course, is that that Natalie17 is completely right:  quinoa doesn't taste like much.  This salad adds a lot of strongly-flavored ingredients to correct that -- cayenne, lemon juice, cilantro, sesame oil, etc. -- and while the end result is tasty enough, I somehow felt like it lacked cohesion.  It kind of tasted like all of those good, flavorful things mixed together, and I was sort of looking for something where the ingredients combined into a unique whole.  Having said that:  quinoa is really, really good for you.  This is a perfectly acceptable way to eat it.

loved this!  extremely healthy, quick & easy to make & well balanced.  we enjoyed the crunchiness of the pecans, the crispness of the celery, and the sweetness of the dried fruit.  it was great with a grilled chicken breast with arizon heat and cheese.

I would recommend only 1 Tbl of the sesame oil.  That was plenty.  I added some cranberries that I gently cooked with a little stevia and some fresh sliced strawberries.  It was very good.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was a hit at the baby shower. I added some sautéed mushrooms -- I love mushrooms. Then I hollowed out some small sweet bell peppers and stuffed them with the salad.  It looked beautiful and tasted awesome. Many requests for the recipes!

I found it disappointingly bland. I only made a cup of quinoa but kept the seasoning measuments the same. Still, it was very bland in my opinion. I ended up toasting the walnuts and some sunflower seeds, added a couple of pinches of Jamaican curry powder, about a teaspoon or so of light soy sauce, and a teaspoon of raw sugar. It was an improvement.

This was delicious! I love quinoa. I always try to follow the recipe to the T, but I didn't have raisins or pecans so I used dried cherries and chopped walnuts instead. The flavors were still really good. This is good as a cold salad too.

I made this following the recipe exactly. When I tasted it after mixing it up, I didn't think it tasted that good. It was kind of boring. But after it chilled in the fridge a few hours and I added the pecans and cilantro, it tasted a lot better. In fact, it was pretty darn good. I will definitely make it again!

This was awsome! great on it's own or served with salmon.  I was a little afraid to put the vinigar in so I only used a teaspoon.  You could barely taste it.  My family also loves spice so a added a teaspoon of chyanne pepper.  Wow!  This is a keeper.  The spicy and sweet really was a great flavor blend.  Next time I may add some dried cherries for more tart and spice.

I kind of combined this recipe with another quinoa salad I loved.  I highly recommend substituting asparagus for the celery and chopped dates for the raisins.  Great salad!
