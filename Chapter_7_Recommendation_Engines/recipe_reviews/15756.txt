this has a wonderful flavor - though the first time i tried it, it wouldn't set and i just ended up with a chocolate pudding.   The second time i tried it, i increased it to 4 tablespoons of corn starch and that solved the problem.  I don't know if that's an altitude adjustment (i live over a mile above sea level) or if it's just a general improvement

The other adjustment i would recommend makes the pie filling absolutely heavenly.  I reduced the amount of milk to 2 3/4 cups and add 1/4 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream.  That made this pie the best cream pie i have ever had.

I used 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch, an extra egg yoke, 2 cups cream and one cup of milk.  It turned out fabulous.  I also added 1 tablespoon of extra strong coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor.  This recipe takes a while but the flavor is so much better than boxed.  I will be using this whenever I want to prepare something extra special for my family.

I made this today for our Thanksgiving dinner as an alternative for those that don't like pumpkin pie and everyone loved it. First chocolate cream pie that I've ever made from scratch and I couldn't be happier with the results! 

I used 4 TBSP of cornstarchâ€”and whole milk [if that makes a difference].  I also let it cook a few minutes longer, rather than removing it from the heat as soon as it started boiling. Served it in a chocolate cookie crust with whipped topping.

ABSOLUTLY wonderful! I've made many pies, but never a chocolate cream, and I'm so glad I came across this recipe. I used 4 generous tablespoons of cornstarch and it thickened up nicely. I tried using a rubber spatula but that seem to create clumps, so I found that a wire wisk worked much better. Be sure to keep stirring! Also, instead of a regular pie crust, I used a store-bought chocolate graham cracker crust. I was practically licking the pot clean by the time I was done cooking. Add some whipped cream and chocolate curls and I know I'm going to have one happy father-in-law tomorrow!
Thanks for this recipe!

First of all - delicious!  Thank you so much for  sharing.  I made a few changes based on previous reviews.  I used 4 yolks, 1/4 cup cornstarch (which is 4 Tbsp), and I added 1 Tbsp of coffee because it was morning and I had it.  The biggest change I made is I made this in the microwave!  It is so easy - don't be scared to try it. (got the idea from a review of coconut cream pie on this site). I followed the directions but mixed everything in a microwave safe bowl.  Once it was time to cook it, I put it in the microwave for 1 minute increments, whisking after each.  I repeated the process until the filling thickened (about 12 minutes for me, but I have a small microwave - should be 8-10).  This is much easier than standing at the stove constantly stirring.  For my topping, I made my own whipped cream but I stablized it so it'd last longer.  I sprinkled 1 tsp unflavored gelatin over 1 Tbsp cold water.  Microwaved it for 30 seconds.  Meanwhile, I poured 1 pint of whipping cream into bowl of mixer.  Whipped starting at low moving gradually to high speed.  Added gelatin, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 Tbsp powdered sugar.  Whipped until cream held peaks.  (Don't overwhip or the cream will curdle).  Best chocolate cream pie ever (and so easy,too!).

I finally found a chocolate cream pie recipe that uses cocoa instead of baker's chocolate! This is a delicious pie. I was concerned after reading another review of this recipe, but I tried it anyway and am glad I did. It only took 15 minutes to cook on my stove, set up beautifully, and tastes great!

This recipe took quite awhile to prepare as the time it took to come to a boil was about 30 minutes.  This is 30 min. of constant stirring.  The pie was not as firm as I like and it was a little too bitter.  I may try it again with less cocoa in it.  The kids didn't care for it much.

Love this recipe.  This is the third Thanksgiving in a row I've made it; see a tradition developing to appease my chocoholic husband : )  Do use 4 tablespoons of cornstarch, and it's not necessary to stir *constantly* while waiting for it to come to a boil, just keep the heat moderate and stir frequently with a whisk, making sure to get the bottom and sides of pan to make sure there's no sticking or lumping going on.  And puh-LEEZE use real whipped cream--don't insult this lovely from-scratch pudding recipe by dolloping Cool Whip on top : )

chocolate cream pie isn't a big thing over here in england but i remembered it from visiting family in louisiana so had a go.  this recipe was A M A Z I N G!!!  really, really good.  so simple to follow - tho i did follow others by using slightly more cornflour (starch) and a biscuit (cookie) base - i added a bit of coffee essence with the milk too.  i shall definately be making this again.

Absolutely the smoothest choc. pie I've ever made.  I used homemade whipped cream topping and it really made it great.  So simple I will never make it another way.  Perfect chocolate flavor also.  All my dinner guests raved about it - it was so good.

Just made this to take to grandma's, yum! I added a teaspoon of instant coffee to intensify the chocolate but otherwise followed exactly and had no problem with it setting. My two little girls literally licked the pot clean! :)

I made this for my boyfriend when he said chocolate cream pie was his favorite. I took the advice from a few other reviews and used 4 tbsps of corn starch and a whisk for mixing. It worked out GREAT! My boyfriend said, "No disrespect to my mom but this is the best chocolate cream pie I've ever had!" Just like him, this recipe is a keeper! =)

One word:  WOW!!!  This was delicious.  I followed other reviewers advise and added 4 tbsp of cornstarch and I used 4 egg yolks.  I also had 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk that I didn't want to throw out so I just threw that in as well and decreased the milk by about 1/2 cup.  YUMMY

This was amazing filling! I used 4 egg yolks and dark chocolate cocoa powder. Used 2% milk and thickened up just fine after about 10 minutes. Alternately used a whisk and spatula to stir. Made into mini chocolate cream pies and topped with homemade whipped cream.

I tired making this last night. I did the option of adding 4 tablespoons of cornstarch as some suggested but it is still looking like liquid in the pie shell. How long does it take to solidify? Should I put it in the freezer? I'm ready to try this pie but looks like it won't thicken.

This pie is the BEST chocolate pie I have ever made and tasted! I followed other reviewers advice, and I used 4 yolks and 4 heaping Tbs of cornstarch, and also only used 2 3/4 cup milk (I used 2%). It was so chocolatey, thick and sweet. My family loved it! And it never got watery like other homemade pudding pie recipes I've made. This is definitely my go to chocolate pie recipe! Thanks so much Cecil for submitting it!

After reading a few reviews, I decided to bake this with tweaking this recipe a little bit: as mentioned I added 4 egg yolks, 4 heaping spoonfuls of cornstarch, 2 cups of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. I followed the rest of the recipe as it was. I did have to stir it for a good 10 mins at least, I didn't time myself, but you will see that the mixture thickens up and becomes non liquid - so you know it's ready! I wanted to make mini cakes, so I put the mixture in a pastry shell (I used Keebler ready crust Graham pack of 6, this made 12 mini cakes!).

 For the topping I decided to make a meringue topping, 4 egg whites, 1/8 cream of tartar, 6 tablespoons of sugar and beat until soft peaks form. Put the meringue on the mini cakes and bake at 350 for about 5-6 mins til golden. Let them cool down in the fridge.  ....Let me tell you, they were delicious!

It's rare that I give a recipe less than four stars,  but this one deserves it.  Let me start by saying that this pie has a great flavor.  Unfortunately, the recipe itself just doesn't make sense.  Only 3 Tbsp cornstarch and 3 egg yolks?  Obviously not enough to thicken 3 C of liquid.  I increased the cornstarch to 1/3 C and used 3 whole eggs and while it set just enough to hold its shape when cut, it still didn't set firm enough to my liking.  The recipe also makes a lot of filling - which is nice for those of us who like to lick the bowl ;)  but 1 C of whipped topping isn't really enough to cover the top properly.  I used 1 C whipping cream to make fresh whipped topping and it did the trick.  All in all, the recipe as is needs improvement, but I will tweak it and keep it on hand as a good base recipe.

I was really looking forward to making this and there really isn't anything wrong with it, I just ultimately found it a bit boring. Tasty though. The chocolate filling is VERY sweet - a bit too sweet and I never say that. I didn't have the time or inclination to make a pastry crust, so I made a chocolate cookie crust, and I made my own whipped topping, flavoured with vanilla and lightly sweetened with confectioner's sugar. I also didn't have quite enough milk so I used 1 cup of cream. Good but not sure it will be a repeat recipe for me.

Delicious.  Made it with some espresso and a mint chocolate cookie crust.  Tasted like a super rich and creamy peppermint mocha.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is written. It took forever to boil and then never set. It was like chocolate soup. Even if it had set, I would not have liked it. Way too sweet!

I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars to this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, but really should've heeded the advice of those that said to increase the corn starch to 4 Tbsp.  It was such a soft set.  The taste was extraordinary, but chocolate is just a bit too thin.  4 Tbsp next time, and it is a 5 star pie.

Absolutely fantastic! I've made this a few times now, and after a few tweaks, I've gotten nothing but compliments. Changes: 4 egg yolks instead of 3.. and 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch (for me, it didn't set right w/ just 3). Use whole milk. I add choc. shavings on top when I've had it on hand. Otherwise, follow exactly. Perfection!!

For taste, this is more than 5 stars!  Absolutely rich and WONDERFUL, HOWEVER, I wish I would have read the other reviews first.  I only used the 3 TBSP of cornstarch as called for and it did not properly set up.  I will make this again and increase the cornstarch to 4 TBSP.  FANTASTIC pie!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used 4 egg yolks and 4 heaping tbs of cornstarch.  I used 1 and 1/4 C sugar but will use only 1 C next time.  I added a little more than 1/2 C cocoa since we love our chocolate.  Boiled it for a good minute or two.  Poured it over a graham cracker crust.  It set perfectly and was delicious!

This pie is fantastic!! I made this for my daughter who loves chocolate pudding and she thought it was great. It is smooth and silky an I only had to stir it on the stove for about 15 minutes.  I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3 and used 2 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of half and half.  It's wonderful!

I made this for Easter Sunday dinner.   The flavor was good but it did not set up totally.   When I cut it, it was kind of runny.   I attempted to add more corn starch after i read some of the reviews, when I was stirring over the heat, but then I ended up with corn starch lumps.   The flavor of the pie was fabulous.   I made whipped cream for the top with another recipe I got off here.

WOW!! I made this using 1 1/2 the recipe for my 10 pie dish using 6 egg yolks and 6 Tbls. cornstarch. Also used a can of sweet & condensed milk & 1 cup 1/2&1/2 with the rest being milk - because I only had skim milk. I'm sure following it exactly like the recipe would have been just as marvelous!! I also made REAL whipped cream for on top - why put frozen foam on that beautiful pie!
This was my first chocolate cream pie - my church home fellowship group will go crazy - now I plan to make it for Easter for my family.Thanks Cecil!!

Yum yum yum!! I even forgot to add the vanilla but the end result was a dark chocolate flavor.  I also decided to use a pretzel crust which added a wonderful salty complement to the chocolate.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

I used 4 Tablespoons of corn starch and cooked the mixture for 3 minutes once it reached a boil.  This would be a good pudding with the 3 Tablespoons of corn starch.  I also stirred all of the dry ingredients together in the pan, added the egg yolk and the milk (2 cups half & half 1 cup non fat milk).  I used baileys for the extract.  Yummy.  This was so good and easy.

It is VERY rich and chocolatey.  I used Penzeys cocoa and it was almost too dark for my husband the milk chocolate fan.  But I love it!

This is the best chocolate pie recipe!!  My husband (who never requests sweets) asked if I would consider making a  Chocolate Cream Pie - he had a flashback to his childhood and remembered his mom's chocolate cream pie.  I looked around and found this recipe.  I used the exact measurements shown in the recipe except for the cornstarch.   I followed recommendations made by other bakers and creamed the sugar and eggs with a little milk until it got a pale yellow color and then added the balance of the ingredients and mixed it again until silky smooth.   Also from recommendations was to increase the cornstarch to 4 TBS, cook for a tad longer after it came to a boil and to stir, stir, stir with a metal whisk while the mixture came to a boil.  I let it sit to partially cool for 15 minutes and poured it into the prepared crust while still warm - this kept the silky consistency and didn't clump up.  I let it cool down more and then put it in the fridge over night.  Topped with sweetened vanilla whipped cream and I was in heaven.  I do not get excited about cream pies at all but OMG - this is amazing and made a believer out of me!!

AWESOME TASTE!  I grew up and whenever our large extended family got together my mom's job was to make the sweet tea and the chocolate pies.  This pie tastes just like what my mom makes.  I didn't give it 5 stars ONLY because I had to increase the cornstarch so much.  I wanted to make sure it set as we are having some international guests over for Thanksgiving.  I would increase the cornstarch to almost a 1/2 cup - or just double it depending on how many pies you are making (I made a double batch as I made 2 pies).  1/2 cup of cornstarch for 2 pies did the trick.  GREAT GREAT GREAT taste though!  THANKS!!!!!!!!!

I made this following others suggestions of an extra T of cornstarch, and extra yolk, and a mix of cream and milk, and it was a runny mess. The flavor wasn't terrible, but it wasn't spectacular either.  Will not make this again!  I don't know why it didn't set up.  It must need tons more cornstarch.

I have been making chocolate cream pies for many years because they are my husband's favorite. This was the best chocolate cream pie I have ever made, hands down. Rich chocolate flavor. Topped it with fresh made whipped cream. It was to die for. I used 2 whole eggs instead of the 3 egg yolks.  Did not effect the taste or consistency. This recipe will replace all previous recipes I have.

Delish!  This recipe stands alone, or is a great base for add-ins; coconut, bananas, etc.  Make sure you let this get to a good boil in order for it to set properly, the egg yolks must cook!

This one is always a hit!

Extremely RICH and creamy!  Delicious pie; if you love dark chocolate I highly recommend trying this pie!  YUM.
On a side note, I did change the milk to 2 3/4 c. and added 1/4 cup Irish cream liquor, which took it over the top!  And then, since it was an Irish Cream kind of night, I decided to add a splash of it into the whipping cream while mixing it up!  If I did that again, I'd add some sugar to it too (I didn't this time, and although it was good...well, perhaps I have a bit of a sweet tooth ...)
Thank you so much Cecil for the amazing recipe!  Well done!

The filling was pretty much just chocolate pudding.  I would have expected something thicker or richer considering you are making it from scratch.  It was good, just nothing extraordinary.

This is what I've been looking for. I've tried all those recipes with chocolate chips and chocolate bars. They were ok, but what I was looking for was a cocoa powder recipe. And I finally found it, and loved it! I did add 2TBLS more of cornstarch and a tad more cocoa. This is a fabulous recipe as a pie or pudding! Yummy, thankyou so much for this recipe!

Whoa! Way too much sugar!! I was so disappointed. It made us feel sick it was so sweet.  I ended up scraping it out of the pie shell and adding tons of milk and a little salt and cornstarch and brought it to a boil, AGAIN!, to make a less sweet pudding.  It is STILL too sweet. I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup or less, or even better just find a better recipe!

I absolutely love this chocolate pie.  My mom asks me to make it every holiday season.  I also add an extra tablespoon of corn starch when I use this for pie and make the recipe as written for pudding. I also like to add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to add a little something extra.  Yummy!!!

A really simple yet excellent chocolate cream pie.  The eggs I used were on the small side, so I added two extra yolks and also upped my cornstarch another scant tablespoon.  I brought the pudding to a boil (stirring constantly) - which did take quite some time, I'll admit, but I'd doubled the recipe and so possibly that added to the boiling time.  I also used whole milk and heavy cream (2 cups milk and 1 cup cream per pie). The pies set up perfectly in the fridge and I added slightly sweetened homemade whipped cream to the tops before serving. Really, really delicious. This recipe is going in the Keeper File.

I followed this recipe to a "T" except for the cool whipped topping. I used the egg whites to make meringue. The instructions for boiling did not say how long to boil. Once it started thickening I poured it into the unbaked pie crust and baked at 350 degrees for 10min. until the meringue browned.  After pulling it out of the oven I noticed that it was runny like pudding. The taste was great, a lil too sweet though. I made another one and followed Jay's review and used 1 more tblsp of cornstarch. I must had over cooked it for it was chewy. I may try this recipe again but will make a few adjustments.

This is an awesome recipe. Super easy, I used and oreo cookie crust instead of a pastry!!! I made the whipped cream from scratch it was a hit!!! Only thing is STEP 2 continuously stirring while waiting for it to boil, I had to put a chair next to the stove b/c my feet started hurting. . . 

OH AND FOR STEP 1 Put the sugar in the bowl first THEN the yolks it will mix better and for the cornstarch, cocoa and salt; add cornstarch and salt first, mix completely THEN add the cocoa. Then add about a half a cup of milk mix completely then continue to add milk til its all in , it will be very thin like water almost (I used fat free milk) but will thicken when you put it on the stove. . .

I followed the receipt as written. The taste was slightly bitter to my taste.  Perhaps I just like a smoother silkier pie?

This is very good but does need more cornstarch, it doesn't get thick enough. The flavor is just like my Mom used to make. But if it doesn't get thick enough makes a great pudding.

As other reviewers have noted, I used 4 egg yolks and 4 heaping TB of corn starch + some.  I added some extra cocoa for laughs, too :)  I forgot to add the butter at the end, but it didn't seem to matter...I used 1 cup of half and half to begin with along with 2 and 2/3 c milk so I guess that's why.  I made my own graham cracker crust using the Graham Cracker Crust I here on Allrecipes.  I cooked it a long time.  If this pie isn't solidifying for you, you didn't cook it long enough.  It was a very very thick pudding texture while still hot in the pot, so I know it'd be solid enough when it cooled and stiffened.
I used the 4 leftover egg whites to top this with swiss meringue.  I let the pie cool as much as my time would allow and topped the pie, then set it in a hot toaster oven for just a few scant minutes.  It was a perfect topping for this pie!  My secret ingredient for this was half a Tahitian vanilla bean that I left in there to cook along with the rest of it instead of using extract.  The reviews I got were so deliriously happy they are not appropriate for a family forum...lol.  I've already had 2 people tell me to make this again.  Great recipe, so simple if you don't have a lot of time to fuss.  Will make again very soon so my mom and I can have a pie all to ourselves.  Thank you Cecil and Allrecipes, you are awesome!

I used 4 heaping T. cornstarch instead of 3. I cut the milk to approx 2 3/4c.  The mixing was a royal pain with the sugar and egg yolks.  I could not get it to cream, just lumps so I warmed up  1/4c. of the milk (room temp in microwave) & beat that in with the sugar & yolks & got the smoothest consistency.  Then added the other ingredients.  It was luscious.

Very good pie. I used 1 tsp strong coff33 and the 4 T of cornstarch. Used 2 C 1/2/ and 1/2 & 1 C whole milk. I am no longer willing to "stir constantly until thickened" on a burner for any recipe. I use the microwave in short bursts and whisk well about every minute after the first 3 minutes until it's the desired thickness. Took about 5 minutes total in a high power microwave. I also preheated the milk for about 3 minutes on 70% power to make it mix well before I added it to the egg/sugar/cornstarch mixture. Used a high grade cocoa (Penzey's) and it was silky and nicely chocolately. Set up easily.

I added an extra tablespoon of vanilla, and it turned out absolutely wonderful! Next time, I will add a cup of cream in place of milk, but even as it is, I think it is rich and sweet and it set perfectly. I made mini pie shells and brought these into my class and they LOVED them!

This recipe is epic!  I used it to make a chocolate banana cream pie, and it turned out amazing.  I accidentally used 3 whole eggs instead of just the yolks, but I don't think it made a difference.  I also followed other reviewers' recommendations and used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of three.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is pretty good. Very easy to make, and a lot better than using box pudding. I would make again. I did not use cool whip, but made it myself.

Wonderful recipe!!!! Smelled heavenly while cooking and taste great.  As suggested in previous reviews, I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and I used 1 cup of cream to 2 cups of low fat milk. My son LOVED it; this recipe is a definite keeper.

Delicious.  We followed the recipe exactly.  I forgot how chocolatey homemade pudding can be; but we loved it!  Very easy pie to make, just be sure to cool completely before eating - makes it easier to cut (we were too anxious).

This was delicious!!! I did up the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons per suggestions, and I also added a couple tbsp of instant coffee, though I really couldn't taste it. When it started bubbling, I kept cooking it for a couple minutes too. This pie set up beautifully, and tastes amazing. Definitely a keeper.

YUM!!!!! This was fantastic! I used half dark cocoa and half regular cocoa. Made the best chocolate pie ever! Mix the liquids first then add the rest. Easier and cooks very smoothly then. Do not rush the boiling. I let cook for a bit longer until it was as thick as a very thick pudding. Try this you won't regret it!

This is chilling in the fridge, but we've scraped the pan clean to eat what was left behind! I substituted 1/2 cup of milk with sweetened condensed milk b/c I was afraid using all skim milk wouldn't let it set. I decreased the sugar to 1 cup so it wouldn't be overly sweet with the condensed milk and upped the cornstarch and egg yolks to 4 as suggested by previous reviewers. Can't wait to try this tonight!

This is a great recipe!  My family loved it!  I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch as others had suggested and used 2 cups skim milk and 1 cup whole milk.  I also used a graham cracker pie crust and spread the cool whip over the whole pie and sprinkled chocolate chips all over.  Looks great and tastes even better! :)

It was a total disaster. After reading various comments I decided to "go safe" and added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. The result was a runny mess with a suspicious flavor.   I might try it again, just for my mother-in-law's and my pride (she's a fabulous cook, and helped me with this disastrous recipe), but I must insist, the resulting goo didn't even taste good... :-(

If you love really sweet pies then this is your recipe. This recipe as written makes an extremely sweet pie. My 82 yr old Aunt, who doesn't care for chocolate loved it.  My son said it was too sweet for him. I have made it several times varying the amount of sugar in it and finally came up with 3/4 cup sugar pie that isn't overly sweet. As with my other cream pie recipes I used 4 egg yolks, and 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch then 2 tablespoons butter at the end.

This was very good, and reminded me of the pie my aunt used to make for the holidays when I was a kid.  I used just a tad less cocoa than the recipe called for, and 4 TBSP of cornstarch, and it was perfect.  And I agree with sandjo, if you are going to make chocolate pie from scratch, take a few minutes to make your own whipped cream - no fake whipped topping!  I just put heavy whipping cream into my Kitchenaid, add vanilla and sugar and let it whip. (If you let it go too long though, it will quickly turn into sweet butter.) Updated 11/24/11 - I've tried other chocolate cream pie recipes, but always come back to this one.  Everyone who tries it requests it again or asks for the recipe.  One friend even commented that she didn't think she could ever eat a chocolate pie made with pudding mix again after this far superior one!

Excellent - just like Granny used to make. A great chocolate flavor and very creamy texture. They were fighting over the last piece!   Creaming the eggs and sugar was a great solution - instead of the old way of cooking the cream then adding to yolks slowly then adding yolks back into pan to cook! Good option that won't cook the eggs too fast.  I used the Philsbury ready rolled crust and nobody knew the difference! I whipped the cream but Cool Whip would probably work as well.

My husband is a chocolate pie LOVER and so I usually cut corners and just use pudding mix and a ready-made graham cracker crust to whip up an easy dessert for him on the weekends.  He always raves over it when I make it.  This pie though - he couldn't get enough of!  Since I can't get pudding mix or graham crackers in Australia, I decided to give this recipe a try - and WOWIE!  It's soooo worth the extra work and not cutting corners!  It was the perfect after Thanksgiving pie!

My four-year-old thought this was the best! However, after cutting into it, the filling got thin, watery, and runny.  Just thought I would let everyone know in case you are serving this as leftovers.

I used 4 heaping T. of cornstarch like the other commenters recommended.  It set up just fine, though it did take forever to boil (don't all puddings?).  It was sickenly sweet--waaaaaay too much sugar.  I love sweets and chocolate and sugar, but even I couldn't stomach the cloying taste in my mouth.  Won't do this again.

I made the recipe as stated, except for adding an extra tablespoon of cornstarch (as others suggested).  The chocolate pudding didn't taste all that great...I would have preferred instant chocolate pudding.

I have made this twice now on two consecutive weekends, Christmas and New Year's, and it was a huge hit with everyone who had a piece of this wonderful pie.  I used 4 tbsp of cornstarch as suggested by some others, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I stirred constantly with a wire whisk and it came out silky smooth with not one lump.  This was my first experience with from-scratch chocolate pie, and I will never, ever use the pudding and pie filling mix again.  Not only does it taste fantastic, it is way too easy to taste this good.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  This will be a must-have on our dessert list for every holiday.

The chocolate filling wasn't firm enough- I'm not sure if adding more cornstarch like others suggested would help. The filling was delicious on its own as a pudding, but not the right consistency for a pie.

My family loved this recipe. I was even told that it was better than my great-grandmothers. Which is quite a compliment. I followed the directions just as they say and I wouldn't change a thing. My only suggestion would be to use homemade whipped topping. GREAT RECIPE!

My boyfriend requested a chocolate cream pie for Easter, so I found this recipe and decided to try it. We must have a horrible sweet tooth, b/c I keep seeing people say it was too sweet and I thought it was PERFECT. To be fair, I did top it w/ homemade whipped cream, so maybe that cut the sweetness some.

First things first, I did have some trouble w/ this pie setting up. HOWEVER, I only keep 2% milk in the house and that's probably what my issue was. I increased the cornstarch to 4 tbsp and that solved the issue.  This recipe made plenty to fill a deep dish pie crust to the brim and have some left over. This worked out well b/c apparently my boyfriend likes warm pudding...he was delighted! The taste was excellent and the pie is already gone, less than 36 hours later.

I chose this recipe after reading the great reviews. This pie is SO delicious. I ran it past my best "taste tester" - my no-nonsense friend Pete who always calls it like he sees it. He was literally was moaning over this pie, and kept mentioning it all night. That's a big win! I made the adaptations noted by many: 4TB corn starch, 4 egg yolks and added a TB of coffee... the coffee REALLY brings the flavor out so beautifully. Found this very easy to make. Over medium heat on a gas stove stirring with a whisk, it only took about 12 minutes to get it thickening beautifully.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it.  It was great -but way to sweet.  So, I read some of the reviews and tweeked it with 3 things.  I use only 3/4 - 1 cup of sugar and added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch(4tbs) and used 2 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.  I have now made this pie about 10 times since for all of the picky people in the family- and they all say its the best chocolate pie they have ever had in their life!

Added to my favorite list.  Awesome  flavors and balance.  changed recipe by adding a fourth egg yolk, 3 tblsp cocoa, 4th tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/4 c strong brewed coffee and substitute 1/2 c heavy cream for milk. Using 2 1/2 c milk rather than 3. Used lightly sweetened whipped cream topping. Also used graham cracker crust recipe with brown instead of white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  The best chocolate pie I ever tasted.  Texture & flavor perfect

I have had a problem every time I attempt to make chocolate cream pie with it setting, this recipe included.  I think if you take the directions very literally and take it off the heat as soon as it starts to boil, it will not set.  I actually poured out the filling the next day & reheated it until it was as thick as I thought it could possible get.  Turned out better, but then I had a layer of unset filling at the bottom (what stuck to the crust) with thicker filling on top.  I hope to try it again soon & I will be sure to really let the filling get thick before pouring it into the crust!

Tasted great and was a huge hit  for Thanksgiving.  The pie didn't solidify enough following the directions as printed though so I would boil it a bit longer next time I make it.

The pie itself was so soupy, it was like chocolate soup. I've never made this type of chocolate pie before and it was the biggest disappointment. I left it in the fridge for six hours and it would not set. Do not recommend this recipe, and I don't know what all the other bakers did right to make this work.

I just made this and am waiting for it to cool enough to pour into the pie shell and chill overnight.  It looks and smells delicious!  It took at least 15 minutes to thicken but I think it's worth it. I did use 4 tbsp. of corn starch and 4 egg yolks...I can hardly wait til tomorrow to taste it.  It's 12:06 a.m. so I will have to wait. Thanks so much for this recipe.. :)  Oh, and I'm  using whipped cream instead of  Cool Whip..  Good night.......Update:  Wanted to let you know that this pie is the best chocolate pie ever!!   Wow!  Will definitely be making this again!

This never solidified.  I followed every instruction for it.  It stayed liquid even though it was in the fridge overnight.  We will use it to pour over ice cream or other desserts, but it was definitely not a pie.  Very disappointed and will not make it again.

badly written for those not too experienced, like me.  when a recipe says to stir constantly until boiling and remove from heat, that's what I do.  it did seem thin, but this recipe had different ingredients so I thought that it would set up, no such luck. the other recipe that I have used says to bring to boil and stir for at least 8 minutes, WHICH IS WHAT THIS SHOULD SAY !!!! OR AT LEAST UNTIL THICK !!! all I had was chocolate soup that did not even taste good and a ruined pie crust. I did add and extra teaspoon of corn starch as other reviewers had done

So delicious!!!!!!!!! It was just amazing!! I used 2 cups of milk, 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream, and 1/2 a cup of water and it was amazing!! Of course, you don't have to use 1/2 a cup of water but I ran out of both cream and milk. :) I also made some homemade whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping and it was HEAVENLY!!!! I seriously suggest it.

I followed the suggestions of several of the reviewers and used 4 egg yolks and 4 tbsp. of cornstarch. I tried the suggestion of Ginnyg of heating the chocolate mixture in the microwave and stirring every minute. The mixture turned out perfectly and the filling was firm and not liquidy like pudding. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to lessen the milk by 1/4 of a cup and that was helpful, too. With these changes the recipe was perfect, rich and delicious. I topped it with real whipping cream.

This is a great recipe. I followed the recipe and the results are wonderful. I made a graham cracker crust. After I poured it in the crust, I laid a piece of plastic wrap over it so it won't form a skin. After it cooled, I topped it with whipped cream. This recipe completely filled the 9 inch pie plate. Thank You !

This recipe I have made several times. I have never been anything other than very pleased. I followed the recipe and made no substitutions for the filling. I did make a meringue in my stand mixer with the egg whites that would otherwise not be used, while stirring filling. (Can I classify that as multi-tasking?) Will make this many more times. I like the availability of the ingredients that this recipe requires, I seldom am without cocoa, milk, etc. Do not be afraid of turning heat up high enough to get the mixture going just stir constantly.

This recipe was PERFECT! I have never made a chocolate cream pie before. I didn't know I'd have to stir it 20 minutes to bring to boil, but it was worth every second! After I was mid recipe, I was concerned about it not being creamy enough  using the 1% milk I had on hand...so I used about 1/3 cup heavy cream as part of the 3 cups milk. And I saw a few comments about increasing the cornstarch, and I took it to 4 Tb. It turned out fabulous!!!! And my very picky boyfriend who grew up on frozen cream pies was blown away! This will be a new go to for me. ;)

Rating this at a 4 star because I made the following modifications, like most people. 4 TBSP of corn starch and 4 egg yolks instead of the recommended. I also substituted 1/2 cup of the milk for whipping cream and used 2% milk for the rest just because it sounded like a good plan. :) Amazing!

This was delicious!!!  I did use 4 egg yolks, 4 Tbsp. corn starch, and decreased milk to 2 3/4 cups as many suggested.  It was the perfect firm consistency for pie.  If you want this just to eat as pudding I could guess 3 Tbsp. cornstarch would be fine and you could probably use all 3 cups of milk.  I can't believe several people have said that this tastes the same as boxed pudding.  I've never had any kind of boxed pudding mix taste this delicious and rich. This is definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe is great. Works very well, and is delightful. Ok, if their are any Diabetics that would like to enjoy this or other cream pies, check this out. First off, I add 3-4 heaping tbs of corn starch. 2nd, if you dont want chocolate, simply dont add it. Try banana flavoring (2-3 tbs) and then add unsweetened fine coconut in the mix(qrtr cup). Follow all the instructions, but use splenda. When done, put mixture in cold steel bowl, and cover with saran wrap and poke a few holes in it. Make a stable whipped cream (gelatin, and corn starch) and pipe with a star tip till pie is covered. Enjoy! :)

This was easy to throw together and thickened up quicker than I thought it would.  I wanted it really thick and rich, so I followed the advice of reviewers and added an extra tbsp of cornstarch.  I also threw in a tbsp of PB.  My 2 yr old son said we should add marshmallows, which I thought might be a great idea, but instead I toasted some and used them as the topping (with a graham cracker crust!).  When chilled, it didn't set up as stiffly as I expected (more like pudding) but the flavour was outstanding!

I used a little extra cornstarch and a bit less sugar.  It was fabulous!  When using cornstarch, NEVER lick the spoon and return to the mixture - salvia causes cornstarch to not set up!  Just a reminder for the cooks since this is delicious!!

Just made this and the flavor is fantastic!  I did add an additional T of cornstarch, cut the sugar to 1 cup and used whole milk.   While I prewarmed two cups of milk in the microwave, I whisked all the other ingredients together really well in a large bowl. I added the prewarmed milk whisking well.   I then put it in the microwave for 3:30 minutes, whisked well, another 3:30 minutes, whisked well, and 3:00 minutes whisking well and done!  It is the perfect texture and flavor for a chocolate cream pie!

I feel like this pie should not have come out as good as it did. It was my first attempt at a cream pie so I read through all the reviews to make sure I did everything right (and to see where other people had issues...) I ended up using 4 egg yolks instead of 3 because they were small eggs.. and then guestimated about 4-4.5 tablespoons of corn starch because I saw how many people had issues with it being runny. The whole time I couldn't tell if I was doing anything right... it took about 15 minutes to come to a boil, and I tossed a handful of milk chocolate chips in there for good measure. A friend came over not long after I put it in the fridge to chill and kept insisting I cut into it. I put it in the freezer a couple times to try and speed up the cooling process. After a few hours I made some whipped cream and spread that on top and we gave it a go, and it was So. Good. It was still a little soft because it hadn't chilled all the way through but we didn't care at all. This was a super easy recipe and I'd totally recommend it.

I was supposed to make this pie for my boyfriends company party. I had to make it twice because I didn't read the other reviews. The flavor was good but it was a runny mess. The 2nd pie is currently cooling. I hope it's not running. I'm NOT making it a third time!

This was a big hit at my early Thanksgiving dinner this year.  Used the extra yoke and cornstarch and some 1/2 n 1/2 like recommended.  I'm sure it would have been too runny without it.  I also used the special dark cocoa but would probably use half reg next time as it was extrmemely dark but ohhhhhhh soooo good.  You could see it on everyone's face as they took their first bite.  I will never use a boxed pudding again.  My only gripe is that the recipe said to use frozen whipped topping.  This pie rates the real thing for sure!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it came out as a nice pudding...  I even added an additional tbsp. of cornstarch mixed with just a tad of milk and it still didn't thicken...  I'll try it again but next time I'll use more corn starch and an extra egg yolk...

Followed the recipe, except used 4 Tbsp cornstarch (as many have suggested) + Dark unsweetened cocoa (instead of regular cocoa) + crushed Oreo crust instead of a pre-baked crust. Used the dark cocoa for more chocolate flavor. The final filling texture was nice and creamy, but there was surprisingly little chocolate flavor to the filling. The Oreo crust had far more chocolate flavor than the filling. Tasted the filling alone, and there was a mild chocolate flavor. Will try a recipe that uses chocolate morsels instead.

I used the 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch that the recipe calls for and the pie did not set at all.  It was still delicious, but it was more like pudding in a pie shell.  Maybe it would have set if I had used 4-5 Tablespoons cornstarch like other reviewers suggested.

My 16 yr old son found this recipe and made it for his cooking class.  Turned out great and now I make it for holiday gatherings.  I make my own crust, a no-roll crust that's easy.  Someone always asks me for the recipe.

I lived in Minnesota for 20 years and still remember my first taste of Chocolate Silk Pie. Oh my. Since moving to NY state I've tried at least 2 dozen recipes in hopes of duplicating it. This is the closest in terms of the extremely rich chocolately taste. 

Almost TOO rich, but with whipping cream on top or meringue, whichever you prefer, it's perfect. Cut thin slices & serve with black coffee to cut the sweetness, cause it really is rich.

BTW, I had NO problems at all with this setting up. Just be sure to bring to a FULL BOIL like it says. I did not add or delete anything in the recipe and it perfectly filled a prebaked 9" crust without overfilling.

This was a great recipe. I tried it out today and my one year old daughter could not shovel it into her mouth fast enough. Also then montage of boys that I have at my house seemed to really enjoy it. I did use 4 tablespoons of cornstarch yet followed the rest of the recipe to the t. It was amazing and I am going to make this recipe again.

Delicious! I used 4 Tbsp cornstarch as suggested by several reviewers, it was already quite thick while still in the pot before cooling. This recipe makes 4 cups, enough to fill 24 3" tart shells with enough left over for 3 dessert cups. I could barely stop myself from eating it directly out of the pot, this is so good! I'm never buying box chocolate pudding again.

I am changing to this recipe after 43 years of making my chocolate cream with bar bakers chocolate.  This is easier and MOST delicious.  I did increase the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons.  I was worried about how clumpy the sugar, egg, cornstarch, cocoa mixture was before adding the milk, but I used a whisk and when it heated up the lumps cooked out. I used the extra dark cocoa since I didn't have any regular cocoa and my family LOVED it. This is my new old fashioned chocolate cream pie recipe.

My first attempt at a chocolate cream pie from scratch. Excellent! I also increased cornstarch to 3 heaping and 1 level Tablespoons. Very thick and creamy! I will be making this pie again and again.

3 1/2 stars - almooost 4.  Mine came together beautifully, but was SO sweet, it was almost inedible.  I say almost - I couldn't take any more than 2 bites, but my husband finished his.  We sent it to his work for the guys to eat, and even they joked about the sugar rush I gave them.  So sorry :(

OK somehow I didn't even have 1/2 cup of cocoa powder so I made up the difference with some instant flavored coffee mix.  YUM.  Didn't seem to set up despite my increasing the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons so I put it in the freezer overnight.  My 12 year old stated, "I could eat this for 3 days straight!"

This was a bit salty for our taste and it wouldn't set. I should have read the other reviews first and used 4 tablespoons of corn starch instead of 3. I've got plans to try it again with less salt and more corn starch, which will hopefully make big improvements. Pretty good though!

I added a little more cornstarch like others recommended. This pie turned out wonderful! It was my son's request for his birthday, and he loved it. I doubled the recipe for two pies, and there was still filling left over. My family enjoyed a rich, chocolate pudding on subsequent nights!

Very tasty and light in texture for a chocolate dessert. I followed the advice of others and added 1 extra egg yolk and used 4 tbs cornstarch. I would advise to taste the mixture before adding all the sugar - 1 c was enough for my taste. I added the seeds from 2 vanilla beans instead of using extract.

This pie is EXCELLENT!!  I did take the advice of some others who suggested 4 heaping TBSP of cornstarch and 4 egg yolks instead of 3.  Personally, I use a 9.5in. deep dish pie plate so I "up" each of the ingredients by 1/4 (so I actually use 5 heaping TBSP and 5 egg yolks, plus the extra of the other ingredients) and this makes the perfect amount of filling for my pie.  It sets up great and tastes wonderful...  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I made this pie as an alternative on Thanksgiving.  I did as others suggested and put 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also added a half of a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips to make it more chocolately.  Everyone loved it!

Soooo Good. My husband has asked for me to make him a chocolate pie for some time. I found this recipe and it reminded me of the way my grandmother used to make her pies. To my surprise it was exactly like my grandmothers. And a added plus was that my husband said it was the best chocolate pie he'd ever eaten. I did use 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and pie held up beautifully.

Very good and easy - if it didn't set for you - you probably didn't cook it long enough - the mixture will become thick and dark and boil ( large air pockets ) I did add extra cornstarch. It was delicious!

This pie was very tasty and a big hit with my family for Thanksgiving dessert. I would have prefered it a little thicker, next time ( and there WILL be a next time lol ) I will add a bit more cornstarch. But overall it was great !!

Excellent Chocolate Cream Pie, making a 2nd one today.  Per others reviews increased cornstarch to 4 TB.  Also, per my own tastes, I used 1 1/2 cups canned 2% milk along with 1 1/2 cups 2% milk.

This is a great recipe!  Rich and chocolatey!  Yum...with homemade whipped cream on top it was a wonderful treat! The only downside is that you must finish it within a few days or it gets a little liquidy...it's never a problem though to get it eaten in our house!

This was the first totally from  scratch chocolate cream pie I have ever made.  It is worth the extra time.  By far it is the best chocolate cream I have ever tasted.  Made one for our friends and they said they said they were in heaven.  I did take another reviewers advice and upped the corn starch to 4 heaping tablespoons. The texture was PERFECT!  This one is seriously well worth the time it takes to cook the chocolate cream.  I'll never use jello pudding to make a cream pie again!

Very smooth and rich and chocolatey :) As per other reviews, I used an extra TB of cornstarch and half a cup of coffee to bring out the chocolate flavour; as well, after I pulled it off the stove, I added in a few TBS of peanut butter and it tasted like a Reece's Peanut Butter Cup pie! ;P It was  a chocolate lover's dream! Next time, I'll try this on a graham cracker crumb crust (I DID have the crumbs on hand, but I wanted to use up an extra pie shell I had) with whipped topping (didn't have any on hand this time, but it was already quite decadent!). I also had some extra filling left over, so I just poured it into little containers to chill for a quick chocolate snack/dessert during the week :D Thanks for posting this recipe!

Mmmmm... This was delicious! I used half dutch process Valrhona cocoa and half regular cocoa, and the filling was super rich and chocolatey! The pre-made crust I had around seemed a bit smaller than 9 inches as I had a little filling that wouldn't fit. That's ok though.... just ate it like pudding while the pie was cooling. Shhhh don't tell!

I had high hopes for this pie.  After reading the reviews I used 4 T. cornstarch thinking that would take care of the problem of it not firming up. Well it still was way to soft, it was a soft pudding in a pie crust.  I also have to agree with the people saying it was to sweet. Even as a chocolate pudding it was just to sweet for me, and I have a big sweet tooth!  If I were ever going to try it again I would deffinatly decrease the sugar and add more corn starch, but I doubt I will try it again.

After reading reviews, I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and the pie still was a little loose after setting 24 hours.  The taste was incredible however. I also decreased milk to 2 3/4 cups and added 1/4 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream which gave the pie a subtle but unique flavor. Topped the pie with fresh whipped cream and garnished with shaved milk chocolate.  This was a big hit with the entire family!

This pie was just wonderful, the best chocolate pudding I have ever tasted.  I put it in a deep dish 9" pie shell from the fridge, used the whites to make the meringue topping.  I will make this again, you can bet on it.  My husband, daughter, dad and friend enjoyed it.  I did add one more heaping tlbs of corn starch and 1 1/3 cup of sugar, used 2% milk and 4 egg yolks as well.  Followed the directions and it was great.  It didn't take 30 minutes to boil but it did take a few minutes to prepare.  Well worth the time spent.  Think I'll have another piece right now.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Outstanding!  The texture is smooth, the taste is rich, and the pie plate is now empty.  I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch, as recommended by other reviewers, and the filling set up perfectly.  This will be my "how to impress dinner guests" dessert from now on.

Awesome pie!  I added the 1/4 cup bailey's and 2 3/4 cups milk like one of the other reviewers suggested and also used 4 tbles corn starch. I made sweetened whipped cream (1 cup heavy cream, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla & 2 tbles sugar) and it went so fast at my company party.  Excellent and I'll definitely make it again!  Thanks so much!

The flavor is good, and I like the idea of using cocoa powder instead of unsweetened chocolate bars, but this pie never did set up.  It's more like chocolate pudding, and I followed the directions exactly.  I wouldn't try it again.

This pie is great! Tastes exactly like my grandmother used to make. I only made two small changes 1)used slightly less than 1/2 cup cornstarch 2) 3 cups 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the milk. I also cooked in the microwave 5-6 min. whisking after each minute, saves time and you don't have stand over the stove 20-25 min.

Crazy Good. My favorite chocolate cream pie is from the Lion House and this was the closest to it. I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it up just a bit. I followed other reviewers advise and used 4 yolks instead of 3. I used 2 cups milk and 1 cup cream instead of 3 cups of milk. I also used 4 heaping Tablespoons cornstarch instead of 3. Other than that I didnt change anything else. I did make my own crust (a regular basic pie crust recipe using butter. I almost doubled the ingredients for the crust because I like my crust extra thick)

This pie is awesome!  I made two and gave one to my next door neighbor because he had done a favor for me.  He said it's the best pie he's ever had and it tasted just like his mom's.  He said he'll be asking me to make it for him often.  I followed other reviewer's advise and increased the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons and reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  It was creamy, rich and just perfect!  This will definitely go in my saved recipes file.

This was my first time making a chocolate cream pie from scratch.  I followed the reviews and added 4 tbsp of cornstarch instead of 3.  The consistency was perfect, but the taste was too cocoa-y, not sweet at all (at least for my tastebuds). That was weird because I tasted it when I mixed it in the bowl to be sure it was sweet enough, and it was.  But after it set, it tasted completely different.  My parents liked it though!

Increase the cornstarch and egg yolks by 1/3 as suggested, pour this into the graham cracker crust on this site and be transported to heaven. Chocolate cream pie has been one of my secret weaknesses since the first day I had a slice mumble-mumble years ago. I thought I had THE definitive recipe until I made this one. Truly 5 star.

Both my husband and I grew up with the chocolate pies made from instant pudding. The first time, I made this (for Christmas), my husband couldn't understand why I would bother making it from scratch. Then we tasted it. Now, we will never go back to the instant pudding pie. On this first try, I used whole milk and white sugar just as the recipe is written. Today, I made if for a second time, using nonfat milk and 3/4 cup splenda blend in place of 1.5 cup sugar. This lighter version came out just as velvety smooth and delicious.

This is an awesome recipe!  Please, Please read other reviews and take heed to their measurements!   I used 2 cups cream and 1 cup 2% milk and 4 heaping TBSP of cornstarch. I also cut sugar back to 1 1/4 cups and used heaping cocoa measurements too.  I am used to making homemade pudding where you have to watch very carefully to keep the eggs from cooking, but this recipe doesn't require this --yeah!!!  I stirred and cooked mixture for about 15 min and it was ready.  I did let it boil for approx 2 min while stirring constantly.  This ensures that the cornstarch is fully absorbed and combined.  The mixture began to set immediately so I know that it will set up properly.  The mixture is delicious and could also be used as a soft set pudding if the amount of cornstarch is cut back some.  I was eating it out of the pan before I remembered I was supposed to be making a whole pie!  It was not too sweet and I did use Hershey's Extra Dark  (dutch-processed) Baking Cocoa.  This will make a great company dessert!

I was looking for a good chocolate pie recipe for Thanksgiving as my husband doesn't like regular fruit pies. I found this recipe and made it and it was the most popular pie at our big family Thanksgiving! I got so many compliments from it and requests to make it again!!! I did alter a few things: I used 1 cup of milk and 2 cups half and half cream instead of 3 cups milk. Before I poured the filling into the chocolate pie shell I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the bottom of the shell to add more chocolate texture. I also sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the top of the cream to garnish instead of chocolate shavings. It was the richest chocolate pie I have ever tasted! Mmmmm! I am definitely making this again for Christmas dinner!

WOW!!  This was excellent!  I used 4 tablespoons cornstarch as suggested.  Since I had some extra half and half on hand, I used 2 cups/1cup 2% milk.  I used a blind baked crust, served with shaved chocolate and whipped cream.  My family loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.

Bless those grandmothers! This pie has all the wonderful flavor "cocoa" can provide. I topped mine with a mile high meringue and I never had to deal with what to do with any leftover pie. There wasn't any! Thank you for sharing a real keeper!!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! This was my first ever chocolate pie and it was a huge success! I used a store bought crust, added 4 tbsp. of cornstarch instead of 3, continued to cook the filling for about 3 minutes after boiling, and stuck it in the freezer to help it set a little quicker. Took about 2 hours to set. I had a family member request a chocolate cream pie (and she's going to pay me) - I am very confident in making this one for her! Thanks for a fabulous recipe! Edited: I tried this recipe a second time and tripled it.... turned out excellent!

I followed this recipe and it is wonderful, nice chocolate flavour. Could be a little firmer, next time i will add a little more cornstarch.  also i used 300ml of cream whipped with confectioner's sugar, as we can't get whipped topping in Australia, very nice too.

Great!! Substituted 2 cups of the milk with heavy cream for a richer flavor and use 1 cup whole milk. Added 4 tbsp of cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers and the consistency was that of a custard... much thicker than pudding (YUM!) used a graham cracker crust and it was heavenly!

This pie is delicious!  I finally found a great chocolate pie to make for my daughter-in-law who loves chocolate. I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch, put it in a chocolate crumb crust, piled on Cool Whip and sprinkled it with a little cocoa. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and will make it exactly the same next time. Everyone loved it at our Christmas dinner.

What a lifesaver! I promised my DH a chocolate meringue pie and discovered I didn't have the right type canned milk for my usual pie and needed something using whole milk. Thank goodness for this wonderful recipe! This turned out rich and very fudgy, lots of chocolate flavor, which I happen to like, but it may be a bit much for others. The filling set up perfectly and this was just like the ones my Grandma used to make with her double boiler. This did take about half an hour just to get the filling to a boil, but really very easy overall. I used the egg whites to make a meringue topping. Delicious and definitely a keeper in my house! Thanks again Cecil for posting this, you really saved my day!

Yum, Yum, YummmmmmO! My first homemade chocolate pie. The only change I made was an additional 1 heaping tspn of cornstarch as suggested by previous reviews. The filling cooked perfectly and set right up in the fridge. We finished the whole thing in one day. I'm making another one tomorrow and trying it with meringue instead of whipped cream.

This pie is smooth and has a good flavor but it is way too sweet. If I make this again I will make it with about half the sugar. We still have half of the pie in the refrigerator and that is only because it's just way too sweet and we'll have to throw the rest out. It did hold up it's shape well though. I think I'll give another recipe a try before cutting the sugar on this one. If you want something really, really sickening sweet and chocolately then this is a great pie.

I used the suggestion of increasing the cornstarch to 4 Tbsp; after it was thoroughly chilled, it still didn't hold up well.  While this ordinarily wouldn't bother me too much--I went back into the fridge to sneak another slice and the whole thing had just collapsed and was oozing this unappealing transparent brown liquid. Yikes! The taste was alright, but for the effort that was required in the process, it would have been more advantageous to make a pudding dream whip pie.

Everyone who ate this pie, simply loved it.  Just like the other reviewers, I made the following adjustments: "4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch" and "continued stirring while boiling over heat with my whisk an additional 4 minutes until it felt thick enough to remove from heat".

I loved making this pie and it tasted wonderful.  I used 4 tbsp of cornstarch.  I was amazed that while I was stirring and waiting for it to boil, it didn't boil it just all of a sudden turned into pudding!  I had a pot full of lumps and I started to panic, but a quick stir with the wisk and it smoothed right out.  It didn't taste grainy, it tasted like chocolate pudding!  I was glad there was a little more left after filling the pie so I could eat it up.

So good! Definitely use the 4Tb of cornstarch, as suggested by others. I'm making this again tonight(2nd time in less than two weeks!) to share at tomorrow's Super Bowl party. This seems like it might be good frozen, too. Thanks!

We couldn't have been more pleased with this pie!  We made it for Christmas dessert and it was a huge hit.  I upped the cornstarch to 4 heaping tablespoons, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  We will continue making this every year!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Took pp's advice and upped the cornstarch to 4 tblsp. So easy and the result was insanely good. I ate a bowl of it before it even went in the pie. Yumm!

Wow, this was delicious!  I took previous advise and upped the cornstarch to 4 Tbsp.  Served this to some friends in the UK, and they'd never had anything like it!  Big hit, and I will be making this again.  Not to mention, now I have a great recipe for chocolate pudding (as you can't find pudding mixes in the UK).

I've had great success with this recipe time and again. Just increase the corn starch to a generous 4 Tbsp and you're set. I also top with real whipped cream. I've made it with 1% milk since that's what we always drink and it sets fine if you just let it cook a little extra time, too.

The end product was good. But I would recommend mixing the dry ingredients, then the milk and eggs. Otherwise the dry ingredients start clumping and won't mix into the milk.

This turned out perfict.. Thank you for Sharing this with us.
 I have never seen a recipe for cream pie using this technique,  so I was concerned it wouldn't turn out. It not only turned out perfect,  your way will prevent any chance of curdling the eggs. I'm going to try this technique to make coconut cream pie. You made my day... thanks sandy

Ok so first time I made this it was good I followed a few suggestions from others on the cornstarch and the whipping cream substitute with some of the milk. But the cocoa powder stayed lumpy so the next time I sifted the cocoa powder and much better. It was really good.

I made this for my husband when he was telling me about his grandmother's recipe. I did what a few reviewers suggest: 4 tablespoons of corn starch (especially in humid south Florida) and I use 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 and 2 cups milk. I use a Graham cracker crust, premade and baked. The filling is silky and surprisingly chocolaty. Super easy to make, too!

the recipe is excellent I cut back on the Coco by 1/3 to make it a little less rich. I've also made this recipe as a sugar free. I have to play with it just a little bit as it weeped after it been set out on the counter for a while.

I made this for Christmas dessert, and took the advice of others by using 4 egg yokes and 4  tablespoons of cornstarch. I also used whole milk. The pie not only looked great, but it was delicious. This is a definite keeper and will be making this again.

This pie is so good! It's really smooth and creamy and has a fabulous chocolate flavor. My neighbors pay me to make pies around the holidays and this pie is one of their favorites. 

NOTES FOR IMPROVEMENT:
1. If you use the amount of cornstarch suggested the filling won't set and it will be more like pudding. Instead, I use 4-5 tablespoons of cornstarch and it sets beautifully. 

2. Use whole milk if you want a richer flavor. Skim milk works fine, but whole milk makes everything really rich and it makes you look like a pro chef.

3. I usually have about a 1/2 cup of the filling leftover because it won't fit into my pie shell. I would recommend saving it and it goes great on ice cream sundaes later in the week.

Fantastic! Thanks for a great pie! Made it with the suggestion of others, 4 tab of cornstarch and 4 eggs yoke.  It was the best chocolate pie we ever had.

Delicious. But a little bit of syrup drained out after I cut the first piece. I made my own crust instead of using a pie shell. I used 1 cup of flour and one stick of butter for the crust. It could have been the butter in the crust that caused the syrup. I used a double boiler.

The flavor is yummy but both times I've made this recipe I can never get it to set. I even cooked it much longer until it was very thick and it still was pudding like. other reviews say they added an extra Tbsp of cornstarch so this may be the fix.

This was the first time I made chocolate pudding from scratch and I was really impressed! The pudding came out so creamy and chocolatey! 
I followed the recipe exactly, and I don't think I'll change anything next time I make it.

awesome! used 4 egg yolks and health 3 tablespoons of cornstarch based on reviews.  It was a hit. I used chocolate crackers for the crust with a 1/4 t of cinnamon. Cooked fast make sure your crust is good to go. mine was in the oven HA!
I am going to add a few chocolate chips next time with the butter and vanilla. Great to make the day before and so easy. Have lots of whipped cream on hand.

I used the four tablespoons of cornstarch, as previous reviewers mentioned.  I used a half cup of heavy cream as part of my three cups of milk.  This maybe added to the creaminess.  It was delicious!  I also put a meringue on mine instead of the whipped cream topping.  Beautiful and yummy!

I've been making this pie for years and it's a favorite! I always make it with half the sugar and it's got that perfect semi sweet taste for me. This last time, (to lighten it up just a bit) I experimented by adding 1 cup cashew milk and 2 cups milk. Because I didn't know how it would thicken, I also added an extra tbsp of cornstarch. Thickened beautifully and tastes delicious!

I added one addition tablespoon of cornstarch (to thicken the pudding). I used 1/2 water, 1/2 milk (to save money), and 1/2 tsp instant coffee to give a richer flavour. I put the pudding in an oreo crumb crust. Divine!

This is a crazy good recipe!!  I did add 4 Tbs cornstarch only because of the reviews. I used high fat Dutch cocoa powder, whole milk and real butter. Itâ€™s a special occasion!   Permanently on my list of A#1 recipes.  Thanks for sharing this!

I put 4 tablespoons cornstarch just to make sure it would thicken but i find the mixture had a chalky texture.  Next time Iâ€™ll put just 3 tablespoons.  I wanted to put instant coffee in it but didnâ€™t have any. Iâ€™ll pick some up next time I go to the store so Iâ€™ll have it the next time I make this pie.

Followed the recipe to a T with the exception of the whipped topping recommended.  Didn't take long for the boiling to start as mentioned in other reviews, and set well once left in the fridge for an adequate amount of time.  However, the pudding is overly sweet - some might like that, but I feel like it is overkill when eating it.   I used unsweetened whipped cream, and I can only imagine what it would have tasted like with a sugary topping added in.  Will not likely be following this recipe again as a result =(

After reading reviews, added the extra egg yolk and the extra corn starch.   Since this is going for a Christmas dessert, I also crushed some peppermint candies and added them to the cocoa mixture.   They melted nicely and the flavor...  OMG.   Keep asking my hubby if I have to share.    The one tip I have is hold onto the vanilla bottle when adding it.   The pudding is very hot which makes the bottle of vanilla very hot when dropped into it, and also makes a huge mess on the stove.   Waiting for the pie to set to fop with whip cream and sprinkle with the rest of the crushed candies.

I have now made this pie twice without the success I'm hoping for. First time just pudding...second time I increased corn starch to 5-6 Tbsp thinking that would do it. Everything was going better until I put the meringue on it. Just like before, it started becoming more like an extra thick pudding. The taste is great but the consistency is frustrating me!!

Switch full fat canned coconut milk for instead of dairy milk and the pie worked great!  Also switched out an Italian meringue for topping ( it used the 3 egg whites left over from the recipe).  Delicious!!! Next time I am going to used a graham cracker crust so itâ€™s more of a sâ€™mores pie. Totally recommend!!!

I did the changes other reviewers suggested(more cornstarch and another egg yolk).  This pie is really easy and truly fabulous!  I never make pies but thought I would try this one,  and so glad I did.  I made my own whipped cream and bought a couple of Heath bars to crumble on top.  I did not use them because the pie didn't need them at all.  It is very sweet, but isn't that what a chocolate pie should be?  Make this for your family for Christmas and you will be a rock star!

A huge hit for Thanksgiving this year!  I increased the cornstarch, per the advice of other reviewers.  I also swapped out 2 cups of heavy cream instead of using just milk.  A graham cracker crust complimented the rich chocolate and a shredded chocolate bar upon the homemade whipped cream was lovely!  Be patient over the stove and the outcome is DELICIOUS!

Such a great recipe i used it for Thanksgiving after years of cook and serve byJello and I have to say this was far better, my guest took all my pies lol (i made my sister leave me 1).  the first attempt I did not deviate at all from the recipe it was perfect even the set for me.  The picture is of my 4th pie and a tiny adjustments here and there have been made just because I like to make things my own.  This is now my go to recipe very simple I know it now by heart and can whip up a gorgeous pie from scratch in minutes.

I made this filling xactly as the recipe states and it is the best chocolate pie I have ever had. It thickened nicely. i did not have to add any extra cornstarch.  I did make chocolate graham crust and homemade whipped cream. The pie is a hit. I was specifically looking for a recipe using cocoa powder and this was perfect.

I added the extra tbsp of corn starch and this worked beautifully.  It thickened up very suddenly in the pot - became startlingly lumpy got a moment, but I kept stirring and it became beautifully thick and silky smooth.  Don't worry about a boil, just wait for it to thicken before pouring it into the crust!

I wish I'd have read the reviews before making this. Other reviewers were correct in stating that it needed 4 tablespoons of cornstarch, not 3. I added an extra heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder and I only used about 1 and a quarter cups of sugar. I would make this again with the aforementioned adjustments.

A rich chocolate flavor. Used 4 Tbsps of corn starch, 4 egg yolks, and cooked via microwave for 1 min at a time, stirring after each until thickened.

It didn't set.  I see in the reviews that everybody is using extra corn starch to make it set, but I'm reviewing the original receipe.  I thought it was strange to add the eggs in first because I've never seen a custard made that way.  That appears to have been a valid concern.  Flavor was okay, but since it was a mushy mess it's hard to tell exactly.

Delicious rich chocolate flavor! I was looking for a recipe that used up my cocoa. I used 4 Tablespoons of cornstarch as recommended by others and it set up perfectly. So much better than packaged pudding mix.

I wanted to like this pie, whew not so much.  The technique is terrible (creaming 3 egg yolks into a cup and a half of sugar) and the sugar is way too much!  Very disappointed and honestly a waste of ingredients and time.

I have always use 3 tablespoons of cornstarch for cream pies and whole milk.   This recipe made a perfect chocolate cream pie.   The cream filling cooked up quickly on medium heat.  One new trick I used is to place all cream incredient into blender and mix for at least one minute.   I have always mixed my strawberry pie glaze in blender before cooking.   I thought this cream pie was more silky creamy than ones I have made in the past.

I used this wonderful pie as my inspiration.. I didn't have cocoa so I adapted ingredients from my chocolate pudding recipe and it worked perfectly.  I added an additional tablespoon of cornstarch (as others here have done) reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and replaced the cocoa with 1 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips (60% cocoa) stirred in after the rest of the ingredients in the recipe came to a boil.  It worked perfectly!

Delicious recipe!  I've made it before and it is lovely!  Thanks for sharing this one, it's a keeper!!!  For all those who added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch, it just takes a medium heat and some patience with the stirring and it thickens up nicely!  My hubby likes to finish off the bit left in the pot and the spatula!  Yum!

Please lesson to the extra cornstarch suggestions! After spending all the time in front of the stove I ended up with chocolate soup! Threw it in the freezer and made a frozen chocolate pudding pie!

Iâ€™ve made this a couple of times now and the pies all set successfully. I did up the cornstarch a bit, using rounded tablespoons, not level. Next time Iâ€™d like to experiment with a nutty crust.

Made this last night, figuring it'd give it enough time to set overnight and through out the day, yet by the time dinner was finished at 6 pm tonight, it was still a soup like consistency.   Prior to making it I read a lot of the reviews, I did increase the cornstarch to 4 TBS due to other reviews. I wish I could say it tasted good..

Super-easy to make. My 9-yr-old daughter made this (with my supervision/guidance) but opted for a graham crust, and added some marshmallows. She wanted a 'smores' pie. I read other reviews first and had her add extra cornstarch, which was not necessary. It came out a little too firm.

This was easy to make. I used a classic graham cracker crust and Hershey's cocoa. It seemed like it was going to be too runny, but it thickens as it cools. Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

I like this pie. The only problem I have is, it has to be frozen to stay together. After about one hour, it's melted, if I take it out for people to get a piece.

This wasn't bad, but it was too sweet for our tastes.  I added the extra tablespoon of cornstarch as a lot of reviews suggested and it set up well but I'd definitely cut if back to no more than a cup of sugar if I made it again.

This was delicious! Everyone loved it. I used an Oreo pie crust and it was yummy.  I made the mistake of keeping it in the fridge after I put on the whipped topping and it turned into liquid. 30 minutes in the freezer fixed it.

I went exactly by the recipe except I added 4 Tbl of corn starch to make sure it would thicken. Well it did not thicken although it came to a boil after about 10 minutes. I think it should maybe boil for a couple of minutes. It was a runny mess so I won't try it again. It was also a little too sweet for my taste.

This pie was very good.  I did up the amount of corn starch to 4Tbs.  I make cream pies in the microwave.  It is so much easier and faster.  I combine all of the ingredients except butter and vanilla, including the egg yolk.  Mix it up well with a whisk, microwave for 2 minutes, whisk again, microwave 2 minutes  whisk, then 1 minute whisk, repeat the one minute whisk cycle until firm.

I've made this so many times, I've lost count! A true family favorite.  In my version, I substitute half a cup of white sugar with brown sugar, and I also add half a cup of half and half with two and a half cups of milk. I always use at least 3 tablespoons of cornstarch.

I'm giving this 3 star surely because the filling was tasty.  However, that being said, this did not come out for me at all!  I read the reviews and noted that 4 tablespoons of cornstarch was needed for it to set properly so I used 4 tablespoons but otherwise I followed the directions and ingredients precisely as written.  I even stood at the stove and stirred constantly while it came to a boil and thickened up nicely.  I then let it set overnight in the pie crust.  Alas, the pie still never set and was a huge mess when trying to serve it.  My family ate it because, as I said, the filling was good, but I would never serve this to company as it was basically just runny pudding in a pie crust.

I followed the suggestions of adding one more egg yolk and increasing the corn starch to 4 TBL.  Next time, i would use a darker, richer cocoa power.   Every one liked it.

Great flavor.  I would increase cornstarch to 4 tbsp to firm up on pudding.

They didn't set and I followed directions exactly!!! Not happy !! I made 2 for Easter dinner and was so embarrassed when I cut into them and they were runnier than pudding. Everyone said they had great flavor but I was very upset with the outcome!!

Very good flavor.  I did add an additional T of cornstarch as recommended by others.  It set up very well.  Would use this again.

Very good but used 1 c. sugar instead of 1 1/2c. sugar, increased cornstarch to 4 tbsp., and used 2 tbsp. butter and 2 tsp vanilla. Topped w/ meringue topping using the whites of the 3 eggs, whipping w/ 2 tbsp. sugar and 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar until stiff. Spread onto cooled cream filling in baked pie shell, making a few peaks and swirls. Baked at 425* for about 10-12 min. until golden brown.

I will make it again, this is the 1st chocolate cream pie recipe that was creamy and pudding-like .  I did as the reviews said and used 4 egg yolks, 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch, 2 c light cream and 1 c milk.  You need to whisk the pudding as it cooks and it does take time but is really worth it.

I wanted a chocolate pie but didn't have any mix so I tried this one. I will never buy chocolate pie mix again. This is so much better. I used 4 tablespoons corn starch and it was perfect.

First time I made it. Followed directions to a T. It didn't set at all. Was a runny mess. I've got it in the freezer hoping it will set  that way. Kids disappointed they were looking forward to this. The liquid taste good shame it's not set enough to eat as a pie.

Made it just as it said and it came out wonderful!! It's even as good the 2nd day with no running as some reported. I was tempted to make the adjustments others suggested but I want a new recipe to stand on it's own, or not, before I play with it. Cook until it boils, I did it on med heat , and it didn't take anywhere near the 30 minutes, more like 15ish.  This one's a keeper!

Wish I would have read the reviews before I made this. Mine also was soup, never thickened. But I really enjoyed the taste, going to try again with less milk and more cornstarch.
Update
Second try was a success, less milk, and almost 1/2 cup of cornstarch. Was great and an easy recipe for a great tasting pie.

It was chocolate soup pie. I think there are two possible fixes to this. Either add more cornstarch as other reviewers have suggested or cook the filling longer once it starts to boil. 
Luckily I was just making it for the kids and they loved it, but had it been for company I probably would have been more upset.

Was in need of a last minute dessert.  I had pie crusts and the rest of the ingredients so I chose this one.   Not bad.  Kids were a fan (obvs), husband was not (he said the chocolate flavor tasted strange) and I thought it was pretty good.  Worth a shot and I'm sure it will only get better if I make it again.

Loved the flavor but mine didn't set and my mixture was nice and thick when I poured it into my crust. Didn't read reviews first (which I usually do)...someone should modify recipe as it sounds like a common issue. Also, I had a bit extra that wouldn't fit into crust...Would attempt again.

This is a very good recipe, I only gave it 4 stars because you've got to go with home made whipped cream.  Why people use hydrogenated oils (very unhealthy, worse than real fat) is beyond me.

I read all the reviews before making this pie and noticed many suggestions to increase the amount of cornstarch to 4 tbsp. rather than 3 tbsp.  I made the pie increasing the cornstarch and my pie did not set up, it was like pudding in a pie shell. Although I was disappointed, it was still delicious and rich.  Maybe my cornstarch needs replacing? Not sure what happened.

I wish I had read the review about putting more corn starch in it.  I ended up with chocolate pudding. It was really even runny for pudding! I probably won't make this again.

I've made this as a pudding and as pie. Amazing and so easy. I followed  some of the reviews and did half cream/half milk.  I also used 4 egg yolks and 4 tbsp of corn starch.  I live near the beach and the cornstarch kept it firm and not runny.  In one of the pies I substituted the vanilla with orange. What a great taste it had.  I no longer buy pudding in a box. This is our go to for everything that asks for pudding and that includes filling for my cakes.  Best pudding recipe ever!!

I did not read the reviews before making this and I wish I had. I spent an hour and a half at the stove stirring, trying to get it to set. 4 Tbsp of cornstarch and a whisk would have been helpful.

I made this today for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner. I increased the cornstarch to 4 TB as suggested but I think I will decrease the vanilla to one tsp next time. It seems like a bit much. Other than that it is perfect and I'm sure it will be a hit tomorrow!

I have made this every year for Thanksgiving for the last 5 years and other times as well. Comes out perfect every time! I followed one reviewer's advice about the 1/4 cup of Baileys and I use a little extra cornstarch, just to make sure.. about 1/2 Tablespoon...never fails and so good!

I am just starting out cooking and baking, and this is the first pie i ever made. The flavor was absolutely delicious, And it looked awesome after it was chilled. But when i cut into it the pie the filling slid right off the crust and was totally confused.

I followed the recipe exactly and it did not set up, so be sure to increase the corn starch.  I thought it would firm up more when cooled, but no such luck.  Tasty pudding, but not too appetizing oozing out of the pie crust.  I was quite disappointed.

Easy to make and delicious to devour! I used a Pilsbury frozen crust and baked it according to package directions. The most important step in this process is to continuously stir when over heat to avoid scorching or getting lumpy. It takes a good two hours to chill. If you don't wait, the pie will fall into a the hole from the first slice removed. Chilling allows the filling to thicken and congeal. I thought the recipe was simple and easy to follow.  yum!

Very good, it has a deep chocolate favor.  I did add an extra egg yolk, only because my usual chocolate pie recipe called for 3 egg yolks for 2 cups milk.  I doubt that made much if any difference.  This is my new "go to" chocolate pie recipe.

This pie tasted so good! It was amazing. Really really good. Definitely worth a shot. The only problem I ran into was that the pie was runny  even after being in the fridge all night. So I would put this in the freezer 1/2 -1 hour before serving just to give it enough time to set up and hold together. But judging on taste this one is a winner!

I took Jay's suggestion and used four TBS of cornstarch right off the bat.  It came out hot, thick, creamy, delicious. Great recipe.  I always have Cocoa in the house and every time I want to make a chocolate creation, I have no Baker's chocolate. This is a Cocoa recipe and really dark and delicious.

This turned out perfect and will be adding this recipe to my family cookbook. I read the reviews and decided to follow some of their suggestions:
  4 eggs yolks (instead of 3)
  4 T cornstarch (instead of 3)
  3 c heavy (whipping) cream  (instead of milk)
 next time I'm going to cut back on the sugar about 1/4c, I was a tad too sweet for my family. 
Thank you for sharing!

I will make this again for sure.....but I may cut the sugar by a little.  It was a little overly sweet for our tastes.  I also did as some of the others and added 1 extra tablespoon of cornstarch and the consistency was perfect.

easy, and full of that classic old fashioned chocolate pie flavor. Everyone loved it. I even made it smores chocolate pie, by putting marshmallows and hershey squares on top after its cooled and then pop it in the oven on broil for a minute to brown up the marmallows, and then serve it. I creates a warm crunchy top and cold chocolate graham cracker crust bottom. Mmm so good.

This rating is for the recipe as stated. There isn't enough cornstarch to thicken properly and WAY too much sugar. I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch, as some reviewers suggested, and found it was still a little loose. I'll try 5 tablespoons in total next time. I thought 1 1/2 cups was a lot of sugar so I started at 1/2 a cup and added to taste. I ended up using 3/4 of a cup. With those changes it turned out quite nicely. There was too much filling for a regular Tenderflake pie shell so I filled two shells to about 3/4 full. It would probably fill a Tenderflake deep dish shell.

This pie is the best..added a Tablespoon more cornstarch to it after reading the reviews..I learned a long time ago to cook the pudding in the microwave..it takes half the time ..just stir it ever few minutes, I added some instant coffee and placed  some Reeses cups on the hot pie shell to start the melting before adding the pudding ...Yum!!!

Used 4 Tbsp corn starch as others suggested.  Just keep whisking while bringing to a boil.  Mine was soupy until the last minute before boiling.  All the magic happens at once, be patient!

Just okay for my family.  Not sure exactly why though.  Maybe will try again with a graham cracker crust?  I even made my own whipped topping with heavy whipping cream.

Probably the best chocolate pie I've ever eaten. And an easy recipe, it doesn't thicken immediately, so I found refrigerating overnight or letting it sit out in a covered container was great for a super thick consistency. I like it as soon as it is done and warm, however. Excellent chocolate taste, not overpowered and as long as you stir pretty consistently (and I am notorious for forgetting to stir) it doesn't have any lumps. Smooth as silk. I will never make another pudding pie again, this will be my go to chocolate pie for sure.

I have made this twice in two weeks. I made it for church homecoming and everyone went nuts over it. So rich and delicious! My daughter and niece requested it again today and as I was waiting for it to bake, I glanced at the reviews. I was shocked at all the bad ones. I decided to wait until this pie was done before reviewing just in case it didn't turn out good. It was fantastic as well. It will be my go to chocolate pie from now on. I really can't believe that anyone would think this pie is anything other than a 5 star recipe.

Yum!!! This was so easy.  I used 4 egg yolks, 1/4 cup cornstarch  and half n half in place of milk  simply because I could. Go rich or go home! I made this in the microwave stirring evey minute and a half until it started to thicken,  then after each minute until it was nice and thick.  This is definitely a new favorite recipe.

I did everything exactly as the recipe stated, to a T. It turned out perfectly, except that it made more than one pie-shell full (which unfortunately means I ate a fair amount of the filling straight from the pan :-( ).

I absolutely love this recipe! I am occasionally blessed with a batch of goose eggs from a nearby friend who raises geese. I substitute one goose egg yolk for the 3 egg yolks and it comes out so rich and delicious. I use 1/4 Cup starch which makes the custard set perfectly.

If you want to make this recipe over the top, use real sweetened whipped cream rather than frozen topping. My mom use to make this pie, it was from a local restaurant, but it had 7 Tbsp. of cornstarch.  I made it in Texas and it was great, here in Ireland, I couldn't get it to set up, even with that much cornstarch. I'm going to try it here and use the 4 Tbsp. adjustment and see how that works. Mom also used reconstituted powdered milk because using whole milk made it way too rich. We'll try it again.

This pie tasted very good but the only thing was was that it didn't really firm up. I'm not sure if the boiling part was what i didn't do quite right but i followed the directions exactly. Maybe it was because i didn't chill it long enough but it was in the fridge for about two and a half hours. It did taste really good and had the perfect amount of chocolate. I will probably make it again but do a little experimenting :D

I read the reviews and decided to add more cornstarch than the recipe called for as well. I used 4 rounded tablespoons. It took just under 15 mins on the stovetop to start to bubble and begin solidifying. I tried a little of the leftover filling and it's a tad more sweet than I generally enjoy my chocolate cream pies, so I'll likely reduce the sugar by half a cup to a cup, next time. We skipped the whipped topping but if I'd had a little real whipped cream to whip up, it would have been good too (I just don't enjoy whipped topping). All in all, a pretty simple recipe with not too much mess, prep, or clean up and the flavour is quite good.

This was my first time making this.  I used a Keebler short bread pie crust.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I enjoyed the rich taste, but I think I'll use a regular pie crust next time to offset  the sweetness.  My ONE problem is that it didn't solidify like I thought it would.  I ended up with a pudding consistency mess.  I saw in another review someone added a tablespoon more cornstarch and that solved the problem, so I'll have to try that next time.

I read a couple dozen reviews before I made this.  like some other reviewers I used 4 egg yolks and 4 tablespoons of cornstarch. I also made another change since I'm trying to limit my sugar intake. I substituted 2/3 of the amount of sugar with Splenda. it took about 12 minutes on medium/high heat (stirring constantly) for it to thicken and boil. I used a pre-made graham cracker crust and topped it with Cool Whip.   it turned out perfectly and my family loved it.

I love this simple recipe for three reasons:  it calls for unsweetened cocoa instead of baking chocolate; there's no pouring the hot ingredients into beaten eggs (I do all mixing in the saucepan); and the taste is perfect. I've made this too many times to count. My family demands this pie at Thanksgiving and birthdays. NOTE:  Do increase the corn starch a little.  Amazing recipe!

Perfect every time!  I sometimes make this extra chocolatey by using an oreo cookie-based crust. One thing I did differently though, is I added 4 tbsps cornstarch instead of 3. Helps keep the filling nice and thick.

After reading a bunch of the reviews, I used 4 heaping Tbs of cornstarch and substituted out 1 cup of milk for 1 cup of heavy cream. It was a very rich and delicious dessert. I made 3 pies and this one went first! For an easier dessert I would make a graham cracker crust next time. Delicious! This doesn't start to thicken until it starts to boil.

I was surprised at how good the chocolate ended up tasting! However, the crust was like, "forget about it", so I pretty much ended up with chocolate pudding---very delectable chocolate pudding nonetheless. I was also curious as to why when I cut a piece, a water-y substance occurred...very dice-y, indeed. ;) Still delicious, and I'll probably end up making it again, along with unintentionally eating half the pie by myself, out of the tin, over the sink. YUM.

The flavor was wonderful without being too sweet. I substituted 1 cup of whipping cream for 1 of the cups of milk which made very creamy tasting. I had increased the corn starch to 3 tbl but  still to loose will try 4 next time.

For a lower sugar option, I used only 1/2 C sugar and added 3 drops liquid stevia.  I also substituted 1 C whipping cream for 1 C milk.
Came out perfect, and plenty sweet!  :)

(The trick with stevia is to substitute only part of the sugar with stevia, to prevent the weird stevia taste.)

Great chocolate taste.  I love cooking with cocoa powder.  I will add more cornstarch next time and definitely want to try the tip on adding some Bailey's Irish Cream.  I did substitute a small can of evaporated milk for some of the 1% milk I used for a somewhat richer flavor.

The first time I made it it was like chocolate pudding--very runny. But tasty. The next time I used Mexican chocolate (Ibarra) plus used 4 T of cornstarch and added 1 packet of gelatin,  the pie was smooth and firm enough to slice it without it loosing its shape.   The Mexican chocolate was delicious. I added cocoa powder to the whipped cream topping. YUMMO

I followed the recipe, and it didn't thicken like pudding should - it was slightly thicker than chocolate milk even after refrigerating 8 hours.   I ended up freezing it, which was the only way to make it edible as a pie rather than soup.  If I make it again I would double the cornstarch, and cut the sugar in half, because it was far too sweet.

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a big  hit.  After reading the reviews, I increased the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons.  I also cooked it longer than after it came to a boil because the consistency wasn't right.  I topped with whipped topping and mini chocolate chips.  DELICIOUS!!!

It was perfect! It's old fashioned so you have to stir constantly for a long time before it thickens. My mom calls that adding love!   It has to be medium heat with a whisk and when it finally boils you will know it! Let it cool thoroughly before putting it in the pie shell and refrigerate. The only change I made was real whipped cream and I used less vanilla only because I have pure vanilla (not imitation). Thank you for this recipe, it's a keeper! It set up fine for me.

This pie was just so good.  It was barely more work than a boxed pudding mix.  The taste was so, so much better!  I followed other reviewers' advice and used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.  It turned out perfectly.  I made it in the homemade graham crust from this website, and I made fresh stabilized whipped cream to go on top. Definitely a keeper.

Really great recipe.  I also made some of the above modifications (four tablespoons of cornstarch, an extra egg yoke, 2 cups of cream, one cup of milk) but I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup which brings out the chocolate flavor (I also use organic cocoa) more to my taste.  You also must whip fresh cream with a touch of vanilla and pipe it on the cooled pie, top with chocolate curls for a deluxe effect that will impress everyone!

Made it the evening before and it still wasn't set the next day. The filling is very liquid-y. Extra cornstarch needed. Will try again with this addition.

Outstanding! I read a lot of the reviews and took the following advice... 4 egg yolks, 4 tablespoons of corn starch and replaced 1/4 C of the milk (I used 2C half-n-half and 3/4 C of 2% milk) with Baileys Irish Cream. The pie set up perfectly. I used an Oreo crust and made my own whipped cream. Taking the 10 minutes to do it is absolutely worth it. This was by far the most decadent, rich and amazing chocolate pie I have ever had. A small slice goes a long way!

This pie is amazing. I followed recipe but added the extra Tbl. of corn starch. I made a crust with crushed vanilla wafers and topped it with homemade whipped cream and mini chocolate chips. Very tasty and pretty.

nice traditional southern recipe.  I did add one egg yolk to get the mix correct.   The coffee added by the arlier repondant was a great idea to make a mocha pie, but if you really want the chocolate flavor to Burst use just a small pinch of cayenne.

This recipe will not set up as is. I tried this based on the star rating and did not read the reviews. Most people changed the amount of cornstarch, I will try that next time. Flavor was great, the pie just did not set

I made this recipe with the addition of 1 more TBS. cornstarch , and 1 more egg yolk like some of the others stated.  I think it would have been fine withou the two additions. Turned out great. Set up nice. Very easy and quick.

Very disappointed. made this pie 4 hours ago and was getting ready to take it to my friend who is recovering and the pie didn't set. as I read the reviews now I see that almost everyone altered the recipe so it worked. although the flavor is wonderful, it's not pie....it's pudding with pie crust. Betty Crocker here I come.

Made this by request of the birthday girl; everyone agreed it was wonderful. Based on reviews here, I substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for 1 cup of milk and used 4 T of cornstarch instead of 3. The texture was silky, firm but not too firm, heavenly rich, and the flavor was decidedly (and delightfully) cocoa-like. I stabilized the whipped cream (I don't use Cool Whip-type toppings if I can avoid them) with 1 tsp of unflavored gelatin and topped that with shaved chocolate curls. Very pretty and quite decadent. Would make again.

Thank you Cecil for sharing your grandmother's recipe.  I'm sure it would make her proud to know so many people are making & enjoying this fabulous pie! I made this & followed the recipe except I did use 4 tbsp corn starch and 4 egg yolks instead of 3 because a lot of folks on here recommended it.  Came out great, just let it boil a couple minutes. I topped it with merengue, yeah don't put that whipped oil on this. It's not too sweet or too chocolatey like some have said, it's really really good. I made it for a get together with friends & they said it was the best they ever had. They're in their fifties & have tried plenty of pies plus they tell it like it is lol.

This pie was delicious. I substituted1 cup whipping cream and 2 cups milk-- I only had 1% milk. The stirring portion took a time long but the result was well worth the effort.   The pie filling was smooth and the perfect consistency.

I used 1 cup sugar, plenty sweet! Making your own lightly sweetened whip topping is a must, cool whip is too sweet.  I added a quarter teaspoon almond extract and used a homemade oreo cookie crust.  So good!!  This will be my go to recipe forever.  Thank you

This was excellent. Great texture, looked nice after it was sliced. I made my own whipped cream for it, though. Glad I did, too. It would have been a shame to top this with whipped oil. I also added another tablespoon of cocoa (I like darker chocolate).


For those of you who have a hard time with the boiling step of the recipe: start at medium low, let it come up to heat a bit. Keep stirring, then bump the heat to medium for a couple more minutes. Keep stirring (don't want it to burn). Then medium-high until it boils and comes together. Just keep stirring.


That's basically how I make my bechamel come together without waiting 600 years.

This has got to be one of the easiest pies around. Based on other reviews I used 4 T Cornstarch and because I don't have whole milk on hand I substituted with 2C 2% and and 1C Half and Half. I also added a shot of espresso. Total time to boil once in the pan was less than 15 minutes. Wonderful flavor, smooth texture, everything you would expect. Will definitely be making again.

So YUMMY!  I followed others advice and added 4 TBS cornstarch and increased cocoa by 1/4 cup. My crew likes graham cracker crust so I did that as well. It was chocolate goodness! BTW,it needs at least 6 hours to completely cool and set up.

Every year at Thanksgiving, my nieces ask me to make chocolate pie. I've been trying for 5 years to find "the one" and I'm thrilled with this one. Not too rich - the filling is a beautiful cooked chocolate pudding. Extremely smooth and shiny. BEAUTIFUL pie, both in a traditional pie crust and graham cracker. LOVED it.

Tastey BUT it didn't set for me either and I live East Coast coastline, so altitude shouldn't be the problem.  Next time I will take Jay's advice and add another tablespoon of cornstarch, because mine came out soupy.  I will update my review after the next time I try it.

We put the extra pie filling in small bowls and served them to the people who didn't want the pie crust.  Decided we like this better as a choclate pudding recipe than a cream pie.  Took others advice to up cornstarch to 4T and had no problem with it setting up.  Also took others advice on swaping some of the milk w/Mint Baileys.  Loved it!

I cut the sugar in half, made a graham cracker crust and also made my own whipped cream. Then it was the most amazing chocolate pie I have ever had!

DELICIOUS!!!!  This was sooooo easy to make and we all really enjoyed it.  Mine was a bit runny, so I will have to experiment with trying to firm it up a little more next time.  Presentation aside, though, it was absolutely decadent.  Thanks!!

I followed the instructions to the last letter, and it looked runny despite 2 consecutive days in the fridge. Once I tried it, I was very disappointed. It didn't taste good at all! To add insult to injury, it took me at least 20 minutes to get the sugar mixture to boil. I will not be trying this again.

I thought the pie was good but every time I make it, it never sets. What can I do to make it thicker and a little less pudding tasting. It basically tasted like pudding instead of a pie... :(

So by adding 4 heaping T.,are they adding 5 or 6 T.? I've also used canned carnation milk recon.in a pinch.This recipe is like my Mothers' but using flour instead of cornstarch. I'm only giving it a 4 star just because of the question about the cornstarch.

Did not set - after 35 minutes of constant stirring.  If I try this again, I'll increase the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons.  I ended up with delicious pudding.

As others did, I added an egg yolk, another T of cornstarch.  I also used 1 cups cream and 2 cups milk.  Instead of whipped topping, I made heavy whipping cream and stabilized it with dissolved gelatin and cornstarch.  Then I sprinkled chocolate shavings on top.

Well, I made my very first chocolate cream pie!  Patting myself on the back!   It turned out AMAZING! This recipe is simple and so delicious!   Thankfully I read the reviews and I too upped the amount of cornstarch.  It set perfect!   My hubby likes a stronger chocolate taste, so next time I will increase the cocoa!   Thanks for all the other reviews, they are so helpful, especially when trying a recipe for the first time!    I can't stop smiling!

this was an awesome recipe and it was really delicious, and it set pretty well bu my mom was impatient and cut it too early, it wasn't fully set yet so it was a little runny, I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch like pretty much everyone else.

So yummy!  Just the right flavor!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 4 tbsp cornstarch and 4 egg yolks ... it turned out perfect!  I used a deep dish pie crust and I still had a lot of filling left over (a cereal bowl full!).  Next time I'll get some mini pie crusts to use up the leftover filling.

I tried this recipe with real whipped cream on top instead of the whipped "topping" and it was wonderful! I made this pie for a family get together and the pie pan was practically licked clean :.) It wasn't quite as thick as I would have liked so I think next time I will try the suggestions another reviewer posted and see how it turns out. Yes, this takes a little while to make but the result is SO worth it! If you're looking for something that only takes a few minutes to throw together I suggest buying Jello pudding and using that. If you want a truly fantastic Chocolate Cream Pie try this recipe!

Made this one weekend to top off a dinner and everyone enjoyed it. The only thing I would add is for those who like meringue instead of cool whip. Otherwise, can't beat it.

This recipe turns out wonderful. I did like most added an extra egg yoke and another table spoon of cornstarch. I also cut the milk by 1/4 cup. It tasted heavenly. I topped it with the meringue II. All we need was graham cracker crumbs and our camp fire :).

The longer it sits, the better it tastes. It's very rich. The chocolate almost tastes like brownie batter.

I Love This Recipe.! I've never made or tasted a chocolate cream pie. For Thanksgiving my mother wanted everyone to make a dish. After a while of searching for the perfect dish, i finally came upon this. The recipe was easy to follow and it's DELICIOUS.!

My first choc pie from scratch, and it came out delicious. Instead of 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.

I used a store bought Graham Cracker crust.  I made this for a friend who loves chocolate.  He said he enjoyed it because the Graham crackers didn't overtake the flavor like they would in say, and iced box cake. The only think I would do differently was add less sugar.  This Recipe was a little too sweet.  Other than that it was easy and delicious.  I even put it in the freezer, uncovered to cool faster once it was in the pie shell.  It was a hit!

I made this pie Saturday and found it to be easy to follow, uncomplicated, and best of all - Very Tasty and it got lots of compliments from everyone who tasted it.  Yes, it takes a little time but was well worth it.  Will definitely use this one again.

very smooth and silky, great chocolate flavor!  Used the 4Tbsp cornstarch and it thickened great.  My husbands response was "Oh wow, wonderful."

I must say that this is one great tasting reci-pie
First time ever baking, was watching Julia-Julie and the first recipe she did was a chocolate creme pie. I then got a hankering for it. I have never had a C.C.pie. This recipe was easy and it is fantastic to the taste buds. My wife and kids cannot believe that I made this. They loved it and I can't wait to try some of the different tweaks that I have read. I made this according to the recipe above and it came out great. Thank you Cecil

I made this recipe as directed and the result was very salty, had to throw out the pie.  I made it a second time, omitting the salt, and it tasted better.  I used Hershey's Cocoa powder, maybe there is a better cocoa to use.

I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and used 4 tbsp. of cornstarch; however, that still did not seem to be enough.  The filling never "set".  Could this have occurred because I used 2% milk.  Something just did not work and am not sure what I did wrong.

This was a great pie.  I followed others suggestions and used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also added a small amount of Kahlua to the whipped cream.  Made it for my sisters birthday this past weekend and my dad requested it for his birthday next weekend.

Flavor is wonderful, but even after adding more cornstarch and trying this one a few times, It just wouldn't set.  I ended up with more of a chocolate pudding in a shell with double the amount of cornstarch.  I think I will stick with french silk pies, but will keep this as a chocolate pudding recipe!

The flavor was awesome.  My husband said it is the best chocolate taste he has ever had.  But this was definitely not a pie.  This turned out to be chocolate cream soup.  I ended up dumping all the chocolate out of the pie shell into a bowl and eating it as pudding because that's exactly what it was.  No firmness at all what-so-ever.  I even left it in the fridge for 24 hours before trying it thinking it would firm it up but it didn't.  Won't be making this again.  Sorry =(

depending on your stove, this may not take as long as other reviewers have mentioned.  It only took 15 minutes for mine to come to a full boil at medium heat.  Regardless, the time spent is well worth it.  Rich, chocolately, smooth - it's a chocolate lover's dream. Take the leftover egg whites and make a merinque for the top!

I made this in a prepared Graham Cracker Crust to save time.  My colleagues at work loved it!  A staff member had suggested I make it, so I found this recipe.  I did use 4 Tablespoons cornstarch.  It held even when sliced!  I was hoping it wouldn't be a puddle when I cut into it.  I definitely recommend using Watkins Vanilla. It really adds a ton of flavor!

The best chocolate pie I've made.  I prepared recipe as directed, but I did make meringue to put over the top.  Baked at 425 for 5 minutes to set/brown the meringue, then transferred to fridge to cool.  My crew loved it!

Really good. I used a ready made shortbread crust. I also used 4 egg yolks, 4 heaping TBSP cornstarch and 2 cups milk - 1 cup half and half. Was the perfect consistancy and so yummy!!

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  My mom always used to make pie with chocolate pudding as the filling.  I wanted the real deal so I made this while she was over cooking with me today. She tried it and immediately wanted the recipe.  Great flavor and simple to put together.

Fantastic! Not too rich- just right! Added a bit more cornstarch to set and used real whipped cream (personal preference). It was the bomb on Thanksgiving.

I really liked the flavor of this pie, but it ended up more like pudding in a pie crust.  I am sure that with some extra cornstarch and maybe use cream instead of milk it would set.  The only thing I did different was mix the cornstarch in with the milk first out of habit to avoid crumbs.

My love for cooking is well known at my place of work, so one of my co-workers asked if I would make a chocolate cream pie.  I didn't have a recipe for this particular kind of pie, so my first place to go is All Recipes and I picked this one.  I took the advice of previous reviews and added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch.  I also added some instant coffee to the mixture to enhance the chocolate flavor and made a graham cracker crust.  The constant stirring and waiting to boil is part of the making of this pie, but with any cream pie, it goes with the territory if you want a truly delicious result. I too started with a heat-proof rubber spatula and as the mixture thickened, went to a wire whip, which kept the lumps at bay. I smothered my cooled pie in whipped cream and chocolate shavings and brought it into work.  Well, the staff didn't wait until lunchtime to try this pie out - they were eating it at 8:00 AM and by 9:00 AM it was gone!  All of my co-workers said it was the best chocolate cream pie they had ever tasted in their lives!  Now that's a compliment!  This recipe will become one of my favorites too.  Thank-you for such a great recipe!

VERY chocolatey.  I have made this for three events and it was a big hit each time.  I, too, increased the cornstarch to 4 T. and made homemade whipped cream.  Fabulous!

Love this pie! I like that it is not a milk chocolate, and I think the sweetness is just right. The first time I made it I followed the recipe and it did not set. The second time I followed the tips of the reviewers and much more cornstarch and it was a very firm set - almost too firm! But the flavor is wonderful.

I love this recipe! The pudding turned out great. I did add more cornstarch than it called for. I baked a pie crust, but double the recipe to make to crust bottom a little bit thicker. Once I finished the pie, I knew I wouldn't do this pie justice without making the whipped cream also. It was a wonderful recipe and everyone loved it! Thanks

My family loved this pie. I prefer more milk chocolate. This was too much dark chocolate for me. I also increased the cornstarch to 4 Tbls. And I used 2 cups half and half and one cup milk. But if you are going to make this pie please don't top it with cool whip, use real whipping cream.

This pie is quite good. I am not a big fan of chocolate pies, however my husband is and he raves about this recipe. Per other reviews I use 4 heaping TBSP cornstarch and two parts cream or half/half to one part milk. It sets up perfectly every time and is rich and creamy. I recommend using a wire whisk to stir frequently and letting the mixture boil for at least 3 minutes. I also don't use Cool Whip because I don't care for the artificial taste - instead I top each piece with whipped cream when serving.

This pie is fabulously easy and so delicious! I made it a few hours before we had to be at a Christmas party, including baking the crust and it came out perfect. I also stirred in a couple of hand fulls of Giradelli chocolate chips after taking it off of the burner to give it that darker chocolate taste and topped it with freshly whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Great recipe.  I made it just as directed....only 3 TBLSP of cornstarch and it set perfectly.  The pudding did not take long to boil and get thick.  I split one recipe into two pie shells and topped with whipped topping, but would be great with meringue.

This was super yummy!  I cut back on the sugar, 1 1/4 cup, as other reviewers suggested, and also, 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3.  I also let it cook for a bit longer after it came to a boil.  My bf requested that I buy one, but I'm glad I didnt, this turned out perfect! Thanks for sharing!!

This would have been a 5 star no doubt, but I followed the recipes exact and it did not set right. I was making this in a hurry so I didn't have a chance to read other reviews.  The taste was AWESOME!  My DH said since it didn't set right it would be a great dessert layered in a glass with cool whip and gramcracker crumbs.  Next time I will make sure to do as others and increase the corn starch and replace 1 cup of milk with cream.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I think that this is a wonderful pie filling!! I used a grahm cracker crust and I added a meringue topping, I put a little more sugar in the egg whites than you normaly would to make it more like marshmellow. It tasted like a smores!!! I am going to fix it for Thanksgiving!!! YUMMMMY!!!

Fantastic! Not too sweet as some chocolate pies are, but not a bitter-sweet pie either. I used 4 tbsp cornstarch, and added an extra 2 tbsp cocoa just to deepen the flavor. It was perfect! It also makes a delicious pudding if served warm.

NEVER will I EVER use a box of pudding mix again (Sorry J-E-L-L-O). This filling not only came out better than a box, I made it perfect from scratch the FIRST time! :) (Woo-Hoo!) It came out smooth and satiny, no lumps and not too chocolately. Awesome! Tasted good hot, too.. not that I tried it or anything 8)  I made this pie by request for my daughter's Thanksgiving celebration at school. I will find out how well it did tomorrow after she gets home. I did make an adjustment, though. I used a store bought Oreo cookie Crust. I'll venture to the handmade when I'm not up baking at 2am.

I READ ALL THE REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT FOR CHRISTMAS. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FLAVOR. I WAS EXPECTING IT TO TASTE BETTER THAN A MIX, BUT IT DIDN'T...EVEN WAS KIND OF GRAINY.
I THINK I WILL TRY ANOTHER RECIPE THAT USES SOMETHING OTHER THAN COCOA.  I DID
INCREASE THE CORNSTARCH TO 4 TBSP AND IT SET UP NICELY.

Simple yet out of this world! I agree with the reviewer who said to use "4 generous tablespoons" of cornstarch. It was perfect! I garnished the top with mini chocolate chips and our guests loved it!
