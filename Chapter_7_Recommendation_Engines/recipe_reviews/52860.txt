These potato pancakes were really good.  I added thyme and green onion tops to give them extra flavor.  I also had to add an extra egg because my potatoes were bigger.  You can either fry these in oil as suggested, or lightly spray the bottom of your skillet with canola oil to cut down on the fat.  Of course the ones fried in oil taste better.  I served mine with salsa because I'm not a big fan of applesauce.
