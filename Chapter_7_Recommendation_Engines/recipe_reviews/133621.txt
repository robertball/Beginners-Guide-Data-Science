This is excellent and can be eaten over rice or noodles. The mix of mushrooms and peanut butter is great! I recommend using 1/4 cup green bell peppers and 1/4 cup red bell peppers if you have them.

Not too bad. We made a good amount of additions/substitutions but I agree with other people that if you don't there's not much flavor there. First it needs more than a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I ended up using a whole can. When you put in the meat like others have said add some garlic and ginger. We also added some chopped fresh cilantro which helped boost the flavor by A LOT. Delicious if you love cilantro like us. Once it was done it tasted like it was missing something and a good squeeze of lime juice really helped. I think next time we might try a little coconut milk too in order to give it a real Thai flavor!

We did not care for this recipe at all. Wasted a lot of good ingredients. I kept adding garlic ginger red pepper etc. to give it some flavor. Definitely won't make it again!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to put together with flexible ingredients and seasonings. I used grated cabbage and carrots instead of prepackaged cole slaw mix. Lots of flavor and healthy ingredients.

This is a keeper. I did use grilled chicken I had on hand and the red pepper flakes. Served jasmine rice on the side. Alena6

I used dark soy sauce which is thicker than regular and added a lot of garlic which I think really helped add much more flavor.

I made this just the other night and it was FABULOUS. I forgot the bean sprouts and it was still great. I will definitely make this many more times. SO GOOD!

I really like the idea of this recipe but it lacked enough sauce to coat and a lot of flavor. I added a ton of asian sauces and thickened with cornstarch.

We loved it although I did spice it up a little with crushed red pepper. Very fresh and flavorful. I'm going to make it again tonight as it went into the "keeper" file according to my family.

I cooked one chicken breast in the microwave for a few minutes on lowish number then diced it. As others suggested I added garlic ginger (at least one tablespoon) green and red pepper with the broccoli and mushrooms as well as increasing the amount of chicken broth-I used about 2/3 cup and should have gone with more. I used more peanut butter and I had crunchy only and then put on lots of cilantro at the end with the toasted sesame seeds. I thought it would taste boiled but the veggies were crisp. This was surprisingly tasty. it was also pretty quick to make

Wow! Great and tasty. Everyone liked it. Will keep this and make it again soon. Only could not find bean sprouts in our stores. Instead used a can of sliced water chestnuts.

Made this last night and loved it. I couldn't find bean sprouts at my store so I bought Brocolli Slaw mix instead. It was quite taste.
