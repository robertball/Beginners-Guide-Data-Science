I really liked this. Mainly, though because it was just so easy to make. I had 2 top sirloin steaks or 3/4 of a lb and made a 1/2 recipe. I was able to get 5 tacos. I used Trader Joe's taco seasoning and handmade tortillas. I only had jalepenos in a jar and a few slices of those worked fine in the salsa. I would definitely make this again, just because the taco seasoning was such a quick and easy way to season beef. I also just cooked the strips completely in the pan instead of only browning them to save time. Other sauces, salsas, or toppings, could easily be used also. TY

Crazy simple recipe. I didn't really measure anything. Used a red onion, most of two mangoes, and cilantro until I liked how it looked. I for

I didn't have time to marinate the flank steak; therefore, I decided to give this a try. WOW...This was easy and tasty and my picky kids even loved it.  Surprisingly tender.  I only used it for the meat recipe and I used the usual fajita fixings. This will be a weekly meal in our house.

This is the easiest steak fajitas recipe I've ever made.  I buy the large container of taco seasoning and basically dry rub the flank steak.  I buy prepared mango salsa from the produce section and add fresh jalape√±os.  I absolutely love love love this simple dinner.

I really wanted to like this.  I even cut the taco seasoning in half, as others had suggested.  Served it  with steak tacos...just did not work.

Very good! Flat iron steak worked well in place of the expensive flank steak, just sliced it nice and thin.

I personally thought it was a little too sweet. My husband didn't like it at all but he also doesn't like sweet and savory things. I think next time I'm in the mood for something like this I will try to tweak it to be a little more savory

I decided to just coat the meat with some of the ingredients found in taco seasoning such as garlic salt, onion powder and a touch of sugar. Turned out great! The mango salsa was fantastic! I cut the onion up quite small...loved that lime base to it all!

One of the best things I've ever made. I used fajita packet seasoning I bought from Sprouts. I also left out the onion in the salsa because I'm nursing my daughter & it affects her. We bought a good quality flank steak from Sprouts (a store like Trader Joe's) & didn't trim the fat. I added avocado & tomato slices to the fajitas along with the mango salsa & used corn tortillas. I cooked extra meat & reheated it in the oven the next day for leftovers. Still just as delicious!
