Very easy and delicious recipe.  I smoked a large roaster for about 4.5 to 5 hours and the chicken was very juicy.  I could not taste the herbs throughout the chicken, though; only on the breast area where the herbs were stuffed under the skin.  Next time I will try inserting the butter and herbs throughout the entire bird so there will be more of those yummy, herbal bites. Thanks!

Excellent! We actually used our charcoal smoker and smoked with mesquite wood instead of cooking this on the grill. The herbs really gave the whole chicken a nice flavor. I added bay leaves in the cavity and rubbed the skin down with garlic powder before cooking. Thanks!

This is very good!  I didn't have fresh oregano or basil so I used fresh rosemary sprigs.  I put butter under the skin with two fresh rosemary sprigs and fresh parsley.  I also put it inside the cavity with chopped onion.  The fresh rosemary flavor was delish!  We smoked our 5 lb. chicken for 5 hours at 225.  Great recipe!

Used soaked mesquite chips and smoked on gas smoker for 4 hours. Really nice flavour! ( I put an onion in cavity and used dried spiced except for parsley which was fresh.

The chicken came out much too dry for me, and I reduced cooking time by 1/2 hour. Definitely check the meat towards the end to see if it is overcooking. Other than that, I used apple chips and it gave a great flavor.

Very good! Made this in our smoker with hickory chips and the end result was a very delicious and moist chicken! Didn't have all the fresh herbs on hand and subbed with dried herbs. Also, tossed a couple sprigs fresh thyme in the cavity along with a quarter of a lemon (just because I had it on hand and figured why not). Seasoned outside of the chicken with salt and pepper (out of habit). Our chicken was 5.5-6lb and took about 4.5-5 hr hours to cook through (removed when internal temp hit 165 F). Let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Thanks for the recipe!

While the smoked chicken itself turned out quite nicely, I couldn't really detect the presence of any of the herbs. It seemed like a lot of prep work with very little payoff. Perhaps roasting might be a better option, with occasional basting.
