You have got to be kidding me! If I would have put all the add ins into the potatoes and onions I would've had soup. Nice taste with just the soup, but would of had to double the amount of potatoes to add all the extra liquids

The amount of liquids this asks for is not so inadequate if you want it to be creamier than most mashed potatoes recipes (as it was suggested by a prior comment).  My dislike here was that I found them rather tasteless and not comfort food-like at all! This recipe needs AT LEAST salt to bring it to -what could resemble, life.
