This is absolutely delicious and visually appealing, too!  I noticed one reviewer said it was bland and another said it was watery, so I increased the spices a bit and decreased the broth to 30 ounces instead of 48.  I also added a handful of golden raisins. Once you add the carrots and zucchini, cook for about 15 - 20 minutes or just until fork tender.

This is really a HEALING stew and has many cancer fighting ingredients and high metabolic spices (tumeric, clove, cinnamon, etc.). It is great for people fighting diabetes, cancer or just want good general health. In the recipe, I forgot that you should add about 2-3 minced garlic cloves with the onions. You can use chicken thighs, shredded chicken or mixed pieces for a more rich stew, or go without the meat and add more beans. Add more veggies of various colors. It is a great stew for fall/winter!

I made this last night for 9 people.  I doubled the recipe and put everything in the crockpot.  Wonderful!  To give it and extra kick we added mango chutney, which complemented the dish very well.  Even better the next day! This is a keeper!!! Thanks for sharing MYLEEN!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I made a few changes.  I used Chicken thighs instead of breast, and I added them whole.  They end up breaking up really nicely.  I was also out of cloves so I used all spice, and added garlic cloves in with the onions at the beginning.  But this recipe is GREAT.  Lots of nice flavors.  Make sure to salt it at the end to bring out all the flavors.

Not worth four stars, but better than three.  It was good, but considering the wonderful spices, I found it to be somewhat bland (my daughter said it was "watery").  I think that 48 oz is way too much chicken broth, if I make it again, I will cut back the broth by at least one third, maybe even half.  I also pulled the chicken out of the pot after simmering for about 15 minutes, because it was more than done, and I did not want to over-cook it (35 minutes total cook time is way too long for diced boneless chicken).  I added the chicken back in after the vegetables were done.  Next time, I may also consider using chicken thighs whole (with the skin and bone) to provide a richer flavor. It just lacked "oomph", but with a little work, this could be an excellent dish.

Awesome recipe. I worked for years at a gourmet Moroccan recipe and my family said I out-did the restaurant. I did mix it up a bit though. First I added about five carrots and an extra zucchini two small potatoes and a large onion instead. I also added about a half cup of raisins. I didn't add the chicken because my mom's vegan but instead halved a couple cornish hens, seasoned them with the same seasonings used in the recipe, and roasted them in the oven. This made for a more pleasing presentation, I think. I increased the amount of seasonings probably by at least 30% and the extra veggies helped soak up a lot of the liquid so it wasn't too soupie. For nutritional reasons my mother suggested adding a bit of kale so I'll probably try that next time. All in all a delightful and healthy meal.

It's really good dish- However, this dish is even better the next day - because it becomes more like gravy- instead of liquidy soup. It's very tasty- I added brown sugar and raisins to sweetened it. The raisins add little bit of sweetness in the soup- Very Good with Raisins.

This came out really well.  There was a bit too much liquid for the stated cooking time.  I increased the simmering time at the end of the recipe by 20 minutes and the problem was solved.  Using that much liquid made a nice stew-like "gravy" in the end, so I would not suggest reducing the amount.

I made this last night and oh my gosh, how wonderful. The spices were perfect, giving it wonderful flavor. Even my picky 6 yr old loved it. It did have a lot of liquid, but it worked for us as we used it for our bread and used the rest as a stock for soup tonight. Thanks for sharing!!

Good subtle flavors, though I might have preferred a little bit more spice. I was wary of the cinnamon (and accidentally added quite a bit!) but it really enhanced the chicken and was not at all overpowering. I ended up with something pretty watery, but it was still great with couscous, and I used the leftover chicken/sauce over whole wheat penne pasta the next day. Yum!

Loved it as is, minus some broth. Only used 32 oz of chicken broth and may use even less next time. The flavor was spot on!

I love this recipe. I have made a few changes that I and my family love:  1 tsp cumin, instead of tumeric 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 32 oz chicken broth 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (completely de-fatted and cubed) sliced spicy chicken chorizo sausages (I use Coleman Natural-the package says www.colemannatural.com) This can be microwaved and sliced over the top.  Otherwise the recipe stays the same. It's an amazing dish. For us who love Buffalo Chicken Wings, the increased cayenne fills the kitchen, but you can dial it down if you wish.

This was 4 star with the adjustments I made based on recommendations.  Added 1/2 more the spices.  Disappointed to read Myleen's post/review to add garlic with onion--she omitted it in the recipe.  Saw that too late and added it while stewing.  Thought she could have edited her recipe to add this omission.  I used a 48 oz box of chicken broth but reserved 2 cups for my couscous cooking liquid.  The 30 oz was still a bit too much cooking liquid.  But you might need that amount to cover the chicken so chicken can absorb flavors.  Also added 2 cans of garbanzo and 1/2 of raisins.  May add 1 cup next time.  Used 12 chicken thighs that I skinned.  Good but not perfect.  Anxious to try leftover tonight so see if the flavors improve.

Yummilicious!  I simply sauteed the onions, added all the spices (adding more of all the spices) then four cups of chicken stock. Put a whole chicken in and let it cook. Took the chicken out and put in the the fresh chopped tomatoes, some sultanas and zucchini in to simmer gently til done. Boned the chicken and put in a bit soda to counteract the acid of tomatoes, thickened with cornstarch and added back chicken meat. Gorgeous and so easy.

I thought this dish was very good!  I was worried about all the spices together but found that they merried extremely well together.  Really enjoyed the exotic taste of this dish.  Will definately make again! :)

I absolutely adore this recipe and have made it many times. My husband and 18-month-old daughter feel the same way! It's full of flavor and yet isn't too strong on any one spice. (I do decrease the cayenne a bit.) I would recommend decreasing the amount of broth by a cup or so, as it otherwise does get a bit too soupy. I also often add an extra zucchini just because I love zucchini! Mmmm, the way the couscous soaks up the liquid and adds to the final product is wonderful - I would definitely not go with rice or anything in its place. Please try this dish - you won't be sorry!!

This dish was good but the spices weren't as prominent as I had hoped. It was a bit bland for my tastes. Next time I'll try doubling the spices. Also, the zucchini didn't add anything to the dish. For veggies I would use a container of mire poix.

Very delicious! I halved the recipe, making it for 3 servings. With the updated ingredients, I still put a little less of the chicken stock in, but did put the whole can (instead of half) of garbanzo beans in. Made all the difference in the world!  I may not have had the pot hot enough when I put the veggies in, but next time I will definitely put the carrots in when the garbanzo beans are put in--they needed extra cooking time.  Loved it, husband loved it! He said he'd definitely eat it again, finished the whole bowl!

Tasty & healthy!  I was a bit leary of trying chicken with spices I normally associate with baking, but I'm glad I did.  I took the advice from other reviews and only used 30 ounces of chicken broth (48 oz. would have made this recipe much too thin).  I did not have whole cloves, so I used 1/4 tsp plus 1/8 tsp ground cloves.  I also did not have crushed tomatoes so I used diced (next time I will make a point to have crushed tomates on hand - the consistency would be better).  I'll be sure to make this again and again!

I didn't use the entire 45 oz of chicken broth.  This is like a spicy chicken soup on the first night and a stew the next night.  I used rice and it soaks up all extra liquid just fine.  You could easily double the spices in this recipe.  I added some diced potato and you could put celery in as well.  Definitely more delicious the next day.

I really wanted to like this but it was an odd combination of flavors.   Although... I should say that my 10 month old loved it all blended together into a soft puree!

I made this last night for dinner and was plesantly surprised but the mix of flavours.  I was a little hesitate with the idea of marrying chicken with cloves and cinnamon, but it really does go nicely together.

I changed the recipe a little bit (partly by accident as I live in the Netherlands and can't speak Dutch so I bought lentils instead of beans!!!).  I didn't have any tumeric or cayenne pepper but I added sweet paprika and pepper to the dish along with the cloves and cinnamon.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I have the leftovers with me for lunch!!

I was describing the dish to a friend on the phone and he was so impressed he's willing to forgo his usual dislike of vegetables and grains to try it out!

I loved the flavor, but I will definitely cut the liquid in half next time, as it came out slightly soupy. The combination of flavors was fantastic though!

Great recipe-chopped garlic and sliced fresh ginger sauteed with the onions makes it a better recipe.  I add chicken broth as needed rather than 48 oz.

This was excellent and my family really liked it.
I used Olive oil instead of vegetable, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves because I didn't have whole, 1 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1/2, and 24 oz of chicken broth instead of 46 oz (I think it would have been way too watery).
I also drained and rinsed the garbanzo beans to lessen the amount of liquid.  

I added the carrots and zucchini after browning the chicken.  There is no way they would have been cooked in time given only the last 10 minutes.  They were still firm and were cooking for at least 30 minutes.  I will have to cut them even smaller next time.  It was still delicious though!

This was a delish recipe.  I did make some adjustments based off of other reviews.  Mine were:

1. Only used 32 oz of Chicken Stock
2. Added 8 oz. mushrooms. (My family loves mushrooms)
3. Added a yellow squash in addition to the zucchini to add more veggies
4. Increased carrots to 4 from 2. 

Like others have stated, it is much better the second day!  I actually woke up and was craving it for breakfast.  So I though, "Why not?!"  It's healthy, full of protein, vitamins, minerals, and veggies.  I served it with sliced canteloupe on the side.  Made for a perfect meal! :)

Thank you for sharing.

Delicious! I doubled the spices also and lessened the chix broth and it was great. A new experience for me! I'm a Southerner and we don't eat like that in the South. : )

This was a really good recipe, although it seemed to be missing something to give it that extra oomph. I did make some modifications (mainly because I was lacking certain ingredients). I used squash instead of zucchini, crushed red pepper instead of cayenne, and added 3 cloves of garlic, 2 red potatoes, and a handful of raisins. I will be making this recipe again, tweaking it slightly.

Very authentic taste - my Moroccan boyfriend loved it!  (He even took the leftovers in a pita for lunch the next day with salad.) I used boneless thighs instead of breasts, added some hot peppers, and used corn/peas and green beans instead of zucchini. Delicious :)

Very tasty - I used chicken thighs instead of breast & I think that gives it a bit more flavor. I'm also going to put more veggies in next time. If you are a fan of hot foods, look for the sauce called harissa at an ethnic or gourmet market to serve with it.

This recipe was decent, but I didn't love it. I followed another reviewer's advice and put everything in a crockpot to cook it. I reduced the liquid to 12 oz. to account for cooking it in a crockpot and that seemed to be more than enough liquid. I'd be willing to make this recipe again, but might add more cayenne pepper next time to give it more kick.

Really liked this dish. It is better the second day. I also mixed the couscous with the left overs and it absorbed some of the extra juice.  Will definitely make again.

Thanks for postig this recipe, my family and I really loved the subtle interplay of the spices. It's always nice to change up the flavor profiles; know what I mean? I did make a couple changes to the recipe, but the spirit was the same. 1. I used homemade chicken stock 2. I added 2 stalks of celery (why not?) 3. I added a pinch of saffron that I had lying around. 4. I seared the chicken breasts whole, chopped them and added them at the last minute. 5. I finished with a little roughly chopped cilantro at the end (not sure about the Morrocanness of this ingredient, but it worked)

This was really wonderful and full of flavor if you make a few slight changes. I doubled every spice and added 2 tablespoons of garlic to the onion as it was cooking (I do admit I love garlic but the overall stew didn't have an overpowering garlic flavor at all). I also added salt liberally at several points, while the stew was cooking.  I added one chopped sweet potato when I added the chicken and it gave the stew an absolutely delicious little extra something, while helping to thicken it at the same time. Definitely let it simmer for as long as possible to let the flavors blend and to thicken. Absolutely delicious! I will definitely be adding this to my regular dinner rotation!!

Being half Algerian (yet a rather poor cook) my girlfriend asked me to cook some traditional North African food for her. This recipe looked close to the one my dad used to make for me. To all those complaining about how runny it is - that's generally how it's eaten, as the cous cous soaks it up...with plenty of bread to mop it up. Nevertheless my girlfriend wanted it thicker so I added some flour to it.  I didn't have any cloves to hand, but apart from that I followed the recipe nearly exactly. If you can get hold of some, eat it with a dollop of Harissa (a spicy pepper sauce) on the side. Yum!

I only used one can of chicken broth,as the reviews said it was watery and found that to be plenty. While cooking I tasted, and had to bump up the amount of spices, also adding garlic, cilantro and pepper flakes (we like spicy). I made the dish in the afternoon, refrigerated and served that night. It thickened and had a nice flavor. My family really liked this and I'll make it again.

Wonderful and healthy recipe. I substituted curry powder for tumeric for more flavor and instead of cooking the couscous separate, I took my box of whole wheat couscous and tossed it right into the pot when I took it off the heat. I've had a friend from Tunisia cook it this way and it really helps with that extra liquid problem other comments pointed out. The flavors were awesome and there was plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day!

my honey and i devoured this stuff.  it's even better the second day.  i bought half of a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store, used the meat for my chicken, and boiled the bones and fatty bits to make the chicken broth (easy and economical!).  i only made about 24 oz. of broth, and that was plenty.  more spices wouldn't hurt, but the flavor is great.  it's necessary to cut the amount of broth in half tho, and you could even reduce that a bit more.  also, i left out the beans and added a clove of garlic.  we threw in some black currants after cooking the first night.  it seemed more exotic that way.  the second night, i added a little garlic salt and no fruit.  it's yummy that way too.  i like mine with a little frank's hot sauce!  and finally, i didn't crush the cloves and don't see any reason to do so.  thanks for the marvelous recipe!!!

I'm not a big stew person, but I enjoyed this one for a whole week.  If i were to make it again, I'd add more veggies. I reduced the broth because I thought it would be more fitting as a stew.  As I was pouring it it, it looked like so much.

Delicious recipe, not too spicy for the culinarily timid if you ease up on the cayenne. However, I must strongly insist that a 48 oz container of broth is (a) WAY too much and (b) will take MUCH longer than 45 minutes to simmer down.  I've been using 16-24 cups of chicken broth made with Better than Bouillon reduced salt and that can easily take 2 hours to stew. Scissor-chopped whole tomatoes gives everything a nice chunky vibe, and I also add the carrots sooner -- my toddler likes his veggies softer.

Delicious meal! Added the garlic with the onions. Didn't have any chicken broth so used a bigger can of tomatoes and some chicken bouillon instead. Also didn't have zucchini, so used red peppers. It was delish! Served over couscous and made some roasted Moroccan butternut squash as a side. Very yummy!!

SOOO good! I originally found this recipe trying to recreate something a neighbor had made for me. Very close to their dish and absolutely delicious. I doubled the spices and cooked all but the tender veggies in the crock pot (didn't want them to be mush so I just saut√©ed them and threw them in at the end). I also didn't have whole cloves so I just sprinkled in some ground. Absolutely delicious! I mixed the couscous with quinoa to up the nutrient factor and I couldn't even tell! Absolutely tastier after sitting overnight too. Thank you!

I am havind a hard time picturing this dish as a chicken contest winner, because I find the chicken a little bit overcooked and dry.I used half the chicken broth, so actually double the spices but it was still pretty bland. I am not going to make it again.

I read the reviews prior to making, used crushed pepper, garlic, allspice because either forgot to pick up the original or thought i had and didn't. The broth I would be too much but it wasn't because couscous will have no flavor otherwise. One person of my family didn't care for it but I liked it. So next time I will make with original items to see what the difference would be.

My family loves this dish, I even get my picky eating children to eat all the veggies in here!  I don't put nearly as much broth because I don't like things too soupy, but do use some of the extra broth to cook my couscous in.  Also, the last 2 times I made this dish, I had a lot of fresh tomatoes on the vine and I quartered those and tossed them in instead of the can of crushed, and I think I prefer it that way to get some actual chunks of tomato.  If I weren't feeding this to my 7 and 5 yr olds, i would add a bit more cayenne, but otherwise it's great as written!  Thanks for giving my family a great new dish to add to our menu!

This is one of the favorite recipes in my house! I've been making it for about 6 years now and we still love it just as much. I've made it MANY times exactly as written, and my 5 stars are based on that. However, now I leave out the zucchini (because my husband doesn't like squash) and sometimes add sweet potatoes (because I love them). I have been making it in the slow cooker lately - it's best if I brown the onions and chicken before throwing it all in, but that's not even necessary. I use chicken thighs or a combination of breasts and thighs, and don't bother to cut them up because they end up so tender they just fall apart anyway. Tastes even better as leftovers!

In light of the comments I used whole boneless chicken breasts, one per person, and they were not overcooked at all, just right. I added an extra  tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 a tsp. of ground cloves. I didn't happen to have any whole ones on hand. Instead of cooking the couscous first, because it cooks so quickly, I did it at the end and used some of the excess liquid instead of water in the cooking of the couscous. It made it all so flavourful and the whole dish was delicious! We never had leftovers to try the next day. I have hearty eaters and they thought it was great tasing so it all disappeared in one sitting.

I just made this for dinner and I love it. I changed it just to fit what I had in the pantry but mostly followed it. I wasn't sure what I would think of the cinnamon, but I love it! It adds awesome flavor.

This was a great recipe although I did make a few changes. I didn't have gloves so I used crushed garlic instead. I was worried about it being runny so I cut the chicken broth in half. After the coucous was cooked I put it directly into mixture. I then added a bit more broth, a little at a time, to get the proper consistenc A keeper for sure although next time I will get cloves to see which is better..

My husband and I love moroccan food and this was a keeper.  I used yellow squash instead of the zucchini and a 36 oz. box of chicken broth.  It was really runny so I thinkened the juice with some cornstarch.  Most moroccan chicken recipes I've fixed in the past didn't call for cloves but I think it adds a unique flavor.

I made this last night and it was delicious! Like many people, I doubled the spices and cut the chicken broth down to a 32 oz box. I used some extra broth in place of half the water when making the couscous, it gives it a nice flavor. Very good, and I will definitely make it again.

My husband loved this and I thought it was quite good, too. I actually made the recipe for 2 servings and didn't add the beans, but added extra zucchini to make up for it. Also, added extra chicken broth to have more stuff to pour over the couscous.  Turned out great.

I loved this meal.  The kids seemed to like it.  My husband, who has an aversion to cloves, was not as crazy about it.  I took the advice of others and doubled the spices except the hot pepper and reduced the chicken broth to 32oz.  I also added a tablespoon of white sugar.  Next time I might cut back a little bit on the cloves and up the cinnamon slightly.  It was delicious!

Made this for dinner tonight and invited my neighbor over. We both loved it! And my 18 month old devoured hers!

The only thing I did differently was added just a bit more cayenne pepper than the recipe asks. The aroma in my kitchen was delicious and the meal had plenty of taste to it!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I made a few changes and it still turned out fabulously.  I was out of cloves so I substituted allspice.  I used about 4 chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned and omitted the chicken broth, zucchini, and carrots.  I also used whole skinless chicken thighs since I don't care for white meat.  This is a wonderful, rich, and warming stew that is great served with a dollop of sour cream.

Made this tonight and turned out great.  Very tasty - you can actually taste the various spices individually.  I used chicken thighs as well as breast meat. I also added raisins.  This is a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes, and it's a great dish for losing weight quickly.  It's high in protein and fiber, and low in fat.  I make the following modifications:
1) 32 ounces of chicken broth
2) 3 chicken breasts (approx 2 pounds)
3) 2 zucchini
4) 4 carrots
5) Increased all spices by 50%
6) I love couscous, but it can be expensive.  Sometimes I just tear up a piece of whole wheat bread.
7) I add the carrots and zucchini at the same time as the broth.  They need about half an hour to become tender enough.
8) Stewed tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes

Most of these spices are cheaper when bought in bulk at a health food store.

Delicious and easy!  Super flexible recipe too. Used combo of chicken thighs and breast, added a few sweet potatoes, doubled all spices plus quadrupled Cayenne and added a heaping teaspoon crushed red peppers (i luv spicy and it was still not that hot) plus added 1 heaping teaspoon each curry powder and cumin.  Used 20 oz Chix broth. Ate leftovers all week - left veggies crunchy (barely cooked thru) cuz I knew I'd be eating all week and it came out perfect!

I made this last night for dinner as we are trying to eat lighter and this is a lower calorie meal. I did made a few subtle changes but I don't think it was enough to drastically change the recipe. I used less broth (about 25 oz), used only 3 chicken breasts  and added golden raisins since most Moroccan dishes I have had include raisins. First, the smell while cooking is wonderful! I tasted along the way and before it was even done I knew it was a keeper recipe! It was very good and I loved the combo of spices. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

I'm glad I read the prior reviews. I did make the recommended changes including less stock (I went with about 24 ounces) and more spices and the family loved it.  I'll definitely make it again, but the 4 versus 5 stars is due to my final dish not being exactly as written here.

This dish is delicious.  I made some modifications that was needed. I seasoned the chicken before cooking.  I used 2 cans (14.5) oz of chicken broth instead of 48oz.  I also added the carrots in with the tomatoes, chickpeas and broth and let it come to a boil first before adding zucchini and letting it simmer and the carrots came out tender.  Lastly I mixed a tsp of flour and 2-parts water together and added it to the broth to make the stew thicken. I served it over long grain rice and my family loved this dish. There was no leftovers!

Unimpressed... And disappointed. It is more like soup than stew and the spices are quite mild for how much liquid this calls for. Among all the Moroccan stews I have had, this is the most mellow. If you are not a fan of spices, then this is your kind of Moroccan stew.

This is a really good recipe! This dish has warmth, a lot of vegetables and great flavor. After reading the other reviewers, I doubled up on the spices, added some chili powder for a bit of heat and also sauteed some garlic with the onions. I didn't have any broth in the house, so subbed in 2.5 cups of water and it worked out fine. I did cook it much longer than the time noted in the recipe. Hubby loved it, would definitely make it again! Thanks Myleen :-)

Excellent! It's on our regular rotation of meals. There's nothing like the warmth and spices of this meal on a chilly/rainy day!

loved making this dish.  lived in morocco for a semester abroad and was craving some couscous.  this was the closest thing i found to the real thing!  fed it to my father and my boyfriend and the 3 of us devoured it.  also used the left over stew as a tomato soup to dip grilled cheese in or just on its own.

This was quite good. I added about 30-50% extra of all the spices, and it was very flavourful.

This was DELICIOUS. I made a few changes, though. It didn't seem to have enough spice so I put in quite a bit more and some curry powder for that extra something (which I highly recommend), as well as some garlic. This was so flavorful. My taste buds are still dancing. My three year old (picky eater) even loved this meal.

Delicious.  I put everything in the crock pot and let it simmer and I added the zucchini only a hour before serving.   I used a whole chicken instead rubbed the spices underneath the skin and in the cavities.  The sauce is delicious and used it on spaghetti once the chicken was gone.  Will be making again!

I just made this tonight and really liked it. It is pretty much the exact same as a recipe I've been using for years from the Moosewood cookbook for "gypsy soup" except you use chicken. I didn't have turmeric (much to my dismay) and subbed curry powder which didn't detract from the taste at all. I did try adding raisins and didn't care for it. Probably because I am used to the gypsy soup recipe from Moosewood which does not call for them. I also served over quinoa due to having more nutritional value but think I would prefer it served just as a regular soup and not over a grain. The seasonings are fantastic and the Moosewood cookbook basically just has you use a green and orange vegetable. I love sweet potatoes or acorn squash as opposed to carrots!

I've made this a few times I leave out 2 cups of the broth then add one cup coconut milk to make it super special.  I also leave out the chick peas for personal taste.  Still a total keeper.

Can't believe I never reviewed this before!! This is one of my favorite recipes and I used it often.  I use 1/4 tsp ground clove, tomato sauce, and sometimes omit the chicken for a quick and easy vegetarian dish.  I also love it with chicken nuggets - I dip the nuggets in the sauce to give them extra flavor and a cool color! :)

My husband and I were both wondering how this recipe got rated so high.  I've been cooking for years and followed the recipe exactly as printed.  It was bland and somewhat sweet, but not very tasty to be blunt.  I actually ended up digging all the chicken out of it (because I couldn't stand to throw it out) and threw taco seasoning on it to make chicken tacos out of it. On a good note, my husband realized he likes chickpeas.

I thought this was pretty good.  Is there a mistake in the amount of chicken stock?  One 48oz can??  I didn't do half that amount.  It seemed way to much.

This recipe was disgustingly bland.  I recently ordered a few Mediterranean and African cookbooks, and fortunately had those on hand to go to, for information on how to rescue the pot of ingredients that I started.  The recipe posted is a watered-down version of a "Spicy Chickpea and Carrot Tagine" with chicken added.  The spice bouquet in the posted recipe is too weak, and the amounts of spices should be bumped up.  Also, the posted recipe omitted some essential ingredients for the tagine, including an essential one -- garlic!  Furthermore, the oil used should be olive oil and a bunch of chopped cilantro should be stirred into the dish before serving.  In order to rescue the pot of watery, bland stuff, I adjusted the spices and also steamed the couscous above the simmering tagine, to absorb water from the stew and concentrate the flavors.

Good but not great. Add chicken broth to your desired consistency. I used a little over half the suggested 48oz. I doubled the spices too. My only real gripe is that it doesn't taste very authentic.

This was very good, but taking the other reviewers advice I cut the broth by half. I will be making this again, but I will be doubling the spices. It was a little balnd for our tastes.

An excellent dish. I made it using dark turkey meat, which I browned with the onion and two cloves of garlic for about twenty minutes before adding the other ingredients. 1/3 cup raisins added a wonderful sweetness, and I doubled the carrots and zucchini. If you want this to be a stew and not a thin soup, cut the chicken soup down to 16 ounces.

Really liked but I don't think 48 oz of broth is necessary.  Half that amount would have been enough as another reviewer suggested.

Holy Cow! This was awesome. My husband liked the chicken but refused to eat the veggies, the beans or the couscous. He's such a punk. It scaled down to serve just the 2 of us easily, and the flavors were great. I did add some garlic when I was sauteing the onion, and threw in raisins with the beans and tomatoes. I'm excited to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, even though there's no chicken left since hubby picked it all out.

I just served this when my family was in town and it was gone before I knew it! Even my picky eaters gobbled it up. I did add about a cup of coconut milk to the sauce which gave it a nice flavor. In addition to the couscous, I also offered it with mango rice with sweet coconut milk. This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

Not something I'd cook often, but it was tasty.  My husband likes Moroccan better than I do, so big hit with him.  I think I'd want to serve the couscous seperately.

Mmm, lovely, a great stew to have this cold November week. I made a few changes, partly due to lack of ingredients, partly to doctor the flavour. I used half the amount of chicken (not a big meat-eater), no carrot, threw in a handful of raisins for extra texture, and added more spices until it was rich enough, probably doubled them all by the end. I also cut the broth down by half and it thickened up really nicely. It's a plus that I'll just have to make up a bit of couscous in no time every night before I pack this up for lunch. A winner.

The flavor is fantastic!  I'm vegan so I left out the chicken and used vegetable broth but those were the only changes I made.  It was very tangy and flavorful and was perfect over the couscous.  Delicious!  Thanks!!
