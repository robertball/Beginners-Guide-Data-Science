Used a dry Bar B Que rub instead of salt. Served with fried onion and fried bananna rings.

I couldn't believe how awesome these were! The batter  was so good!  I couldn't find flat iron steaks so I used flank steaks. I also used a light beer b/c that is all my father-in-law had :) and I chose to omit the hot pepper sauce knowing that my kids would not like it hot. The whole fam loved them. The only thing I would warn is they are a little chewy so watch the little ones when they eat them.

Instead of flat iron steaks I used cubed steaks and I omitted the beer.  I also used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of just salt and pepper.  The steak fingers were very tender and delicious.

There's a local restaurant that's famous for some steak fingers with green chile.  These are very close to theirs!  Awesome!!!

Outstanding!  I followed the directions exactly, even freezing the steak fingers after battering.  Although it is something I will have to do on the weekend because of the two prep times involved, I will definately be doing it again!  The kids came by and while they were "on their way to eat" they ate all the steak pieces before they left our house.  NO leftovers!!  I will cut back on the salt next time because it was a bit too salty for us, but over all it was just fabulous!  They were great with fried potatoes.

Another good variation, I like the egg batter but I'll stick with mine.

What a fabulous way to stretch a steak. Usually I serve one striploin per person but this recipe allowed two steaks to serve 3 plus a dog and have left overs. First off I made a rub with two large tablespoons of chopped garlic and Montreal Steak spice. I cut the steaks into strips and coated them with the mixture then let it sit about 4 hours. After that I floured, egged, floured again and  fried them. They were absolutely delicious. When my daughter saw what I was doing she wasn't too happy as she thought that this would ruin the steak. She was very pleasantly surprised. If using a tough cut of beef I would marinate it for 24 hours so it isn't tough but I found that the strip loin was a perfect cut and can be bought on sale cheaper than round or blade steak in the summer months and around Christmas time, After re-reading the recipe I realize that I barely followed it. lol. I did only exactly what I wrote. I guess this can be viewed as a completely different recipe. ( never froze the battered steak either)

I did not cover the steak in flour as well as I liked before freezing. I believe I could do better next time

The batter is great, really held together without flaking off in the fryer. I made homemade fries, salsa and guacamole which really complimented each other perfect! The green onions are a must when eating steak fingers as well. I did find and use flat iron steak at smiths. A 1.5 lb package made 24 fingers. Will be making more this week. Thx for the recipes!!

It's a great recipe, I have experience it with different alcohol and found it very tasty with Appleton estate rum.

Thank you for helping me make some great supper

This is our 7 year old's favorite food. Make sure that you use a dark beer that you like because the flavor is noticeable and changes drastically based on which type of beer you get! Cut back a little on the salt and this recipe is tried and true to leave no leftovers! Last time we doubled the batch and froze half. A few weeks later we fried them right up and it was a quick and easy dinner!
