This was really good. I used a large loaf of Italian Ciabatta bread cut in half. I used 3X the amount of garlic and I still think it needed more. The trick to getting the cream cheese and oil to mix is to do it in a food processor. Add the cream cheese and herbs and start pulsing, then very slowly add in the oil while pulsing the machine. If you do it right, the oil and cream cheese will form an emulsion and will not separate. I will make it again, but next time I think I will add feta cheese and garlic salt, it was just missing that extra punch of flavor.

I had a half a loaf of french bread to use up and made pasta for dinner.  This bread was really good. After reading reviews, some had trouble with mixing the olive oil and cream cheese.  I decided to drizzle oil on the bread first, then spread the mixture and broil.  Since my bread slices were small it only took a few minutes on low to melt.  I also drizzled a small amount of olive oil and grated parmesan after coming out of the oven.

Definitely one of my favorite garlic bread recipes! I stuck the cream cheese mixture in the frig. for a little while. It mixed a lot easier!

Very tasty garlic bread!  However, my experience tonight is that cream cheese and olive oil just don't mix.  It was impossible to get the mixture "smooth" - even using the electic mixer, once you stop mixing, it immediately begins to separate.  Not sure if there's anything to be done about that.  Anyway, that being said, it still tasted delicious and was an excellent accompaniment to our spaghetti dinner.

Very good bread! I only had extra virgin olive oil, and I was afraid that the flavor from that would be too strong, so I decided to use half softened butter and half olive oil and the results were DELICIOUS!!! Creamy, buttery, cheesy goodness! I will be using this recipe a lot, I'm sure! Thanks for posting :)

I used a Sour Dough loaf and 1 Cup melted butter instead of Olive Oil and I just heated the bread until it was hot and bubbly instead of broiling it.  It was a delicious combination of flavors!  It all got gobbled up at my Easter dinner!

I cut this recipe in half and used day-old ciabatta loaves that I bought off the clearance rack. I thought this might not work......I was kind of iffy about the ingredients and how good they would taste. The kids and I loved it though my husband was kind of on the fence about it. Not as hard as I thought it would be and using the day-old bread worked out just fine.

I used a loaf of soft Italian bread instead of French bread and it turned out perfect under the broiler. I also didn't have oregano or parsley on hand, so I substituted with a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Like others said, the oil didn't mix completely with the cream cheese, and I was a little concerned about drizzling MORE oil on top, but everything combined well in the oven. Definitely as good or better than frozen garlic bread!

Yum, yum, yum! I cut a loaf of bread horizantally instead of slicing it. I had no problems mixing my oil with the cream cheese, guess I'm lucky. Thanks for the recipe!!

It was quite tasty but I think the slice needs to be kept directly on the rack in order to be crisp properly.

This is awesome garlic bread. I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and added a little less than 1/2 cup olive oil to it and had no problem getting it to blend smoothly and it never did separate, even when stored in fridge for days. I put some of the cream cheese mixture on a kaiser roll, broiled until bubbly, topped with some sliced rotisserie chicken, parmesan cheese, drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil,  and then back until broiler until browned. Thanks for this recipe.

Pretty good. I followed several reviews and didn't use that much oil. In fact I probably used only about 2 tablespoons.

Very yummy! Made it as a side to bring and they were gobbled up! Like others, I had issues with the cream cheese and olive oil mixing so I microwaved it for a bit and then whisked it, and spread it on, whisking again as needed. Eventually it got pretty thin so I just drizzled the rest on.

The concept is great, but the flavor was weak. Not nearly enough garlic! I should have read the review that said "I used 3x the garlic and could've added more". I think if I triple the garlic next time, it might be just about perfect for us. I didn't taste the herbs all that much though either, so I think I may add a little more there too. Careful w/broiling! I burnt the first batch in only 3 minutes!

My opinion: way too much olive oil & maybe too much cream cheese for the amount of bread. Otherwise...delicious!!!

This was delicious.  I made about 6 servings.  It called for about 1/2 c. olive oil, which I felt was too much (I wanted to make the recipe a little healthier).  I used only about 2 tbsp for the entire recipe.  I also used ciabatta bread instead of French (personal preference), dried parsley instead of fresh (I didn't have fresh on hand), low-fat cream cheese, and a mixture of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheese instead of just Parmesan.  Once the garlic cooked in the olive oil, I poured all the olive oil and garlic into the cream cheese mixture as well as the 3-cheese mixture (instead of adding during broiling).  I sliced the bread lengthwise into 2 pieces, spread half the mixture on each slice (I didn't add any additional olive oil) and broiled it for about 5 minutes.  The edges of the bread started to brown sooner than I hoped, so I moved the pan down to a lower oven rack to let the cheese mixture melt a little more.  I served it with homemade manicotti and my husband and I loved it!  We will definitely add this to our permanent dinner list!

I have been making garlic bread this way for many years. I got the recipe from a chef. It always gets terrific reviews! Thanks for the recipe and the reminder of how terrific it is ...but you do have to watch it closely at it burns quickly.

I hate to say this, but this is not the most incredible garlic bread.  It was a mess to make because it was difficult to incorporate the oil with the cream cheese.  Quite frankly a whole cup of olive oil in this recipe is overkill.  When it was done, it looked pretty just like the picture - but the taste just wasn't there....

This wasn't really my favorite garlic bread.  Sorry.  I would have liked to have the cheese mixture cook a little more, but the parmesan cheese on the top browned so fast that the cheese mixture below it hardly had time to get warm.  Thanks though for posting the recipe.

This was quite good. I didn't get all of the olive oil mixed into the cream cheese, but nearly. I used an immersion blender. 
It tasted great and was a hit at our dinner party.

1 cup of olive oil for one loaf of bread! Yikes! No wonder people had problems with trying to blend it with the cream cheese. I used about a 1/4 cup of olive oil and stirred it into room temp cream cheese. This recipe seems more tedious than it needs to be. I didn't bother with the heating of the garlic and it would be much easier to slather the cream cheese on a loaf that is sliced in half horizontally rather than each individual slice. I actually used the cream cheese mixture on a thin crust pizza shell, so that I could slice it into wedges and serve as an appetizer. Definitely needs more garlic in order to be a garlic bread.

While we enjoyed this one overall, it needs a lot more garlic, and I even used a garlic cream cheese blend rather than plain cream cheese. I would also just go with the oregano, leaving out the basil and parsley. I liked the taste of the olive oil in the cheese mix, but the drizzle over top made it too dominant a flavor in the end, so I would leave that off as well. With those few tweaks, I will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is truly an amazing recipe, DH doesn't like cream cheese, but he just loved this bread. I made my own french bread, sliced it in half, spread the olive oil on the bread and broiled it for a few minutes until the top started to get dry, then pulled it out and spread on the cream cheese and sprinkled it with Parmesan. It's definitely a keeper, thanks for posting it.

Delicious! This is so creamy and wonderfully decadent! Works very well if cooking for a large number of people.  I made the dish for the people in my co-op and it was a hit for all! In order to save our house a little money, I bought the day-old loaves from Jimmy Johns -- at $.53 per loaf, they are a great bargain! Great recipe that has officially been added to my Italian night repertoire!

I thought this was very good overall, but I did change it a bit. I minced up my garlic and used more then the recipe called for- I love garlic! I didn't add any of the olive oil to the cream cheese mixture. It was a good way to cut out a lot of fat from the recipe and it was creamy enough without it. I also stirred in the Parmesan with the rest of the cheese mixture because I didn't want it to brown too quickly and not warm up the rest of the cheese. I used fresh basil because I had some on hand. It turned out great! Overall I thought it was a very good garlic cheesy bread. I'll be making it again, only with my modifications.

This was good but a bit too rich I thought.  I used half the olive oil called for and can't imagine using the whole cup.  I probably won't make this again.

This was good.  It was easy enough to make but mixing the cream cheese and olive oil did not work out too well for me.  I tried a whisk and an electric mixer and the mix would always separate.  I did not use the whole 1 cup of olive oil.  I only used a half cup, maybe a little less.  I may try this again because I really want to love this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this very much. I have no idea how many ounces were in my loaf, so I used half the amount of olive oil. I used whipped cream cheese spread, and preroasted minced garlic. EDIT: 11/12/09 I don't bother making any other kind of garlic bread anymore. I don't measure it, I just whip the ingredients together with the cream cheese and smear it on. I use all sorts of bread. Sometimes I think about trying another kind of garlic bread...but then I think, "This recipe needs cream cheese..." and I come back to this one over and over. The original amount of "stuff" for 1 lb of bread is still too much, IMO, but that's easily remedied by just..not putting as thick a layer on :) EDIT: Footnote...Use a fork to mix the cream cheese & olive oil. Smash the cream cheese with the tines of the fork, this even works with cold brick-style cream cheese. :)

Very good.  Different is what the bf said.  I agree; not my usual method of making garlic bread with cream cheese.  We both liked it though.  Put the mixture on Oat-Bran Bread I'd made a few days ago.  Very nice.  Thanks!

I had to drain some of the olive oil that would not mix but this may be due to lack of experience (I am new to cooking).  Otherwise the results were quite good and I will be making this again.

I wasn't overly impressed. Oil and cream cheese didn't mix well and the spread made the bread a little soggy. Overall, this recipe had a nice flavor but I'll continue looking for "the perfect" recipe.

Excellent.  Add more freshly grated parmesan - maybe 3/4 cup instead of 1/4 cup. Will definitely make this again.

I used butter instead of oil, I pretty much went half butter and half cream cheese.I feel this is way better than plan oil for flavor.Super good and my kids loved it. I used this on pre-made pizza shells too!Make sure you have marina sauce for dipping!

This was excellent!  I did not have a problem with the oil mixing, so maybe I was lucky.  The only thing I will try different is put a little more garlic flavor in the next time!

I wish I could give this negative star as cream cheese just does not work on garlic bread....worst darn garlic bread I ever had in my life.       I had to make a batch of good old reliable garlic bread as no one liked the cream cheese.

Easy "cheating" way: use Garlic Herb Cream Cheese instead. Spread it on your bread, top with parmesan and oil as indicated, broil and you're good to go.

I gave it a 4 star only because I did not follow it compkletely. I'm sure it would have been a 5 star. I catered an event this evening and they loved it. I didn't use oil but used butter and cream cheese.I didn't have basil so I omitted it. I did use some olive tapenade I had and mixed that in. It turned out fabulous. Now I can't go to bed because I ate too much. Ialso served the chicken florentine and almond crusted mashed potatoes. All got outstanding reviews. Thanks. Monkey Licoscos

I just got married 2 months ago, and I haven't had to cook until now. I made this tonight and my husband LOVED it. I used hamburger buns in a pinch, and used plain vegetable oil instead of olive oil, since I didn't have it...and this garlic bread was just amazing. Garlic bread is my comfort food, and I will definitely  be using this recipe until the day I die!

I made this knowing that my husband wouldn't like it because he doesn't care for cream cheese (crazy, I know!)  I love cream cheese but didn't love this recipe.  I didn't use the full amount of olive oil but followed the recipe otherwise.

This turned out great, it was quick to make and a very good taste.  I sprinkled a little mozerella and cheddar cheese on before putting in the oven, but I would wait until about the last minute to do that because it got brown way quicker than the rest of the bread.

One word: AMAZING. I am impressed and will be using this for all future garlic bread. I also made white cheese lasagna and the two were simply divine together. I don't know if it made a difference, but I used minced garlic... :)

This was fantastic!  I couldn't get the oil and cream cheese to mix well, but I tried my best and smeared the mixture on a loaf of french bread that I had cut horizontally. I doubled the cream cheese mixture to cover the bread. It was wonderful! Cheesy, crispy, creamy!

This had to be by far the best garlic bread ever! The only thing I changed was that I used Italien Bread instead and just made big slices. Me and my finace' both agreed that this will be made again very soon.

This was so-so. I really enjoy garlic bread, but thought the preparation method (and taste) to be mediocre compared to my "stand by" recipe. I think it was the cream cheese.... My bf didn't care for this either (but he doesn't care for cream cheese...). I halved lalala71's recipe (cut about 6 slices of bread from a 16 oz. French loaf). I did use 3 oz. of cream cheese (1/2 the recipe would have called for 2 oz., but since I had a 3 oz. block on hand, I used all of it) and a full tablespoon of garlic  because we LOVE a strong garlic flavor. I have one suggestion for anyone trying this. I found that softening my cream cheese in the microwave first, then adding it (and the spices/garlic) to my food processor and pulsing as I slowly poured in the olive oil kept my spread from separating as others have mentioned. Oh, and I don't think the olive oil "drizzle" is necessary (don't waste good olive oil for this, IMHO). An overall neat idea, but not for me/us. Thanks anyways!

Really good! I popped the cream cheese in the microwave for 5 seconds to soften it before mixing. I had no problem whisking it together with the oil just using a fork.

This was a good garlic bread, but the cream cheese base was not my favorite.

It was way better than the garlic bread I normaly make.  I added to much cheese but will definatly do this again.  I really like the idea of cream cheese.
