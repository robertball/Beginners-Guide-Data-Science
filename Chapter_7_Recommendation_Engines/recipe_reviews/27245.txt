One of the best dishes I have made in a very long time.  I did a few things differently; omitted the tomatoes and used a sun dried tomato pesto in place of the usual basil pesto, pounded and seasoned the chicken with black pepper and Italian seasoning before schmearing the pesto on it...then rolled the chicken in garlic seasoned Panko crumbs before baking.  Still went with the mozzarella at the end of the baking time.  Served atop buttered egg noodles and then smothered the chicken in some fresh baby bella mushrooms that had been sauteed in garlic butter and simmered in white wine.  My guest said he would order it at a restaurant without question.  Thanks for the base, Buitoni!

my husband and i enjoyed this but i made a few additions which include: in addition to pesto, season chicken with salt, rosemary and pepper.  Coat in pesto and then coat in Italian breadcrumbs.  Additionally, I made a vegetable red pepper marinara sauce and layered the plate - marinara, then wheat pasta (or yours of choice) and then chicken with pesto, seasonings and cheese to top!  We're having the leftovers tonight!

This recipe is very easy to prepare.  To kick it up a notch, I cut about 4 slits in each breast and then stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes before coating the chicken in pesto.  The chicken came out moist and flavorful.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I L-O-V-E this recipe.  I make it 2 or 3 times a month because it is so good and SOOOO easy.  I do change it up though.  I just spoon the pesto on the chicken instead of putting it in a bowl and I use a baking dish rather than foil lined pan and while it's cooking I bast the chicken with the juices which makes the chicken brown real nicely.  Instead of using shredded cheese I just put a slice on top and if I want it extra cheesy I make the slice real thick.  Once and while I might use a bruschetta mix instead of tomato which is also yummy.

I pounded each chicken breast prior to seasoning.  I coated the chicken with Italian breadcrumbs which I mixed with parmesan cheese, then I coated with Pesto sauce and baked for 25 minutes and 10 minutes longer with the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  After baking I broiled it for about 3-5 minutes for it to get a bit crispy.  It was so good!!!

Made this for my boyfriend and we LOVED it. I find that with the bowl you waste alot of pesto.  i placed the chicken in the baking sheet and spooned/spread pesto on each side.  Also, used olive oil, garlic salt, and oregano on the tomatoes. They were divine!! thanks for this recipe --

Perfect for a quick, weeknight dinner.  I used Kirkland Signature pesto from Costco and it tasted fabulous!

FANTASTIC!!!!Delicious & super easy & quick to prepare, absolute perfect meal. Only thing I might do different next time is cut slits in chicken so pesto absorbs inside...the out part was very tasty, but inner chicken needed a tad bit more. Over all "TOP 10 FAVORITE!"

This is an excellent recipe it turned out better than what you would get in an expensive resturant.

I made my own Pesto which had basil, olive oil, garlic and parmeasian cheese.  I did not put the tomatoes on it and I used asiago cheese instesd of the mozzarella cheese.

I served it over egg noodles with a fresh bread on the side.

This is a great EASY recipe. I have also used sun-dried tomato pesto instead of basil pesto. It is very good. This has become of our favorites.

A very easy to prepare and tasty recipe. I used cut up cherry tomatoes (it's what I had on hand) to replace the plum variety and the sweetness of the tomatoes was a very good addition to the chicken. I had lots of homemade pesto on hand, so used that for the recipe. Wonderful to have another fast and delicious way to prepare chicken for work nights!

We just made this tonight.  It is REALLY good.  I was not to sure about it, thinking that it was SO simple it would not taste good.  I used pesto from Costco.  I did not change anything about the recipe.    The chicken was moist and absolutely delicious!

I put the chicken in a bag with the pesto and then spooned the remaining pesto on the top before putting it in the oven. It was great.

I thought this seemed way too simple to be very good, but I was wrong -- absolutely delicious.  I did make a couple very small changes though.  After tossing the chicken in the pesto, I tossed it in seasoned bread crumbs, to which I'd added a shake or two of grated parmesan and a dash of red pepper.  Baked for 22 min at 400, then I didn't have any tomatoes so I put a smear of marinara over the chicken before smothering it with mozzarella and ground black pepper and popping it back in for 4 more minutes.  Definitely not a diet food, but very little effort for a very good meal.

This was good.  Tomatoes are not in season now so I really dont like buying them if I dont have to.  I used a can of diced tomatoes;drained, instead.  It worked fine.

The chicken was very moist and had a great flavor.  I didn't have a tomato so I skipped it and just lightly browned the cheese for about 3 minutes after the chicken was done.  My husband and kids thought it was great too.  It was even elegent enough for company.

I used this recipe to make sandwiches.  I chopped up the chicken into bite sized pieces, prepared as suggested (with the addition of garlic powder and black pepper before the pesto), then i toasted hoagie rolls and placed the finished chicken, with tomatoes (added italian seasoning) and melted cheese on top.  it was delicious! i will definitely make it again.

Delish!! Hubby and I thought it was the best chicken I had made in a long time. =) but I rate it 4 stars and not 5 because its not as pesto tasting as I hoped it would be.

Yummmm!!!  I did change a few things and I think it might have made it even better. I love sun dried tomatoes and used this instead. I also bought the fresh mozzarella cheese balls that comes in a container with oil. After the chicken was almost done I pulled it out of the oven and made a small cut to insert the cheese and topped it with the sun dried tomatoes. Put it back in the oven for 5 minutes and it was perfect..if you want to make this recipe even more easy you can buy pesto chicken at Trader Joes! (Perfect for guys trying to impress a girl, with little work as possible) :)

Fabulous flavor! I used the premarinated "pest chicken" from Trader Joe's and topped it with a slice of roasted red pepper. Baked @ 400 for about 30 minutes. I think the key to the fabulous flavor was letting the chicken marinate in the pesto for as long as possible.

I usually make this a little differently, I cut up the chicken in bite sized pieces and add a tablespoon of sour cream to the pesto. Then I cook it together in the oven for about half an hour and either serve it with a side or serve it on pasta. So good!

I love this dish!  Except, instead of using tomatoes, I cut a slit on the top of each chicken breast and stuff with julienned sundried tomatoes.  It's yum-skilly!

This is one of my favorites--so easy and versatile.  Sometimes I skip the cheese and occasionally the tomatoes and use the cooked chicken in other recipes.  Also, you can mix other spices with olive oil and salt and bake the chicken for other flavors.  The tomatoes can be exchanged for canned ones or even spaghetti sauce.

Followed another reviewer's suggestion to use breadcrumbs, it was great! I coated the chicken with the pesto then in Italian breadcrumbs. I didn't have any tomatoes, so I added the mozzarella cheese directly onto the breading.  The pesto taste was not overpowering at all and the chicken was moist.  Will make again.

I used sun dried tomatoes instead of roma.  After the initial baking time, just sprinkle them on top of the mozarella cheese, bake again for 5 minutes and voila!  GOOD STUFF!

This is now my husband's absolute favorite recipe, and I don't mind because it so, so easy to make. When tomatoes aren't in season, I sometimes top the chicken with a little bit of chunky spagetti sauce instead -it's just as good! I have found that you MUST COOK THIS ON A BAKING SHEET - I tried it once in a glass baking dish and it was pretty oily.

I would recommend loosely covering the chicken with more aluminum foil. Because of the oil content in pesto, it spatters like crazy! I thought this was fairly good; it scores points for being quick and easy.

My husband thought I spent a lot of time on this dish because it tasted so good.  I love that it is not only easy, but very fast to make.  The chicken is very moist as well!

Though it may be quick and easy, I thought this particular dish was terrible. Being a chicken lover and a pesto lover, I didn't see how it could go wrong...but in the end I felt it to be bland and oily.  The chicken was tender, but flavorless.  I won't be making this again

I didn't so much follow the recipe as much as the ingredients, and cooked it a little differently. However, the chicken was tender, and the pesto made for a great topping for the chicken. I served it with french bread, and the pesto and olive oil mixture I used for the chicken was SO good on the bread!

I would give this 3.5 stars if I could.  I was very excited to make this recipe.  I have become a big fan of pesto but for me this dish ended up a bit dry.  As a PP said, the outside was wonderful.  The inside was boring.  I may try to season it up and try again.

This was quite good!  Of course we love pesto!  I used the reduced fat pesto sauce and used a spoon to smother it on there.  Then I used a mixture of bread crumbs and Italian seasonings to bread the chicken.  We both enjoyed it a lot.

I love this recipe. I top with roasted peppers and feta cheese for the last 5 minutes. It's a favorite of my husbands. I'm not the greatest of cooks, but this always tastes perfect and it's so quick and easy!

Really good.  I used homemade pesto and just smeared it on both sides of the chicken once I put it on the baking sheet.  I do like this with cutlets, though, rather than large chicken breasts, or at least pound them thinner!

sooooo simple and sooooo yummy. i made fresh pesto yesterday and decided to use some pesto for the chicken. wow, it's the quickest/easiest meal you can prepare, but packed with flavour. i used some slices of fresh Parmesan instead of mozarella and it turned out GREAT--love the saltiness of it. I can see it being quite good with fresh mozarella too. highly recommended!

This was a great recipe.  To help with the dryness and taste, I marinated the chicken breasts in Italian dressing (use any of your favorite marinade) and garlic pepper.  It really helped with the flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is delightful!  I add quite a bit of garlic, pepper and a dash of salt.  The first time I made it I used a diffrent brand of pesto and it was better.(can't remember the brand)  The second time, I used a basil italian dressing which was good as well.

YUM!  I was surprised at how tasty this was.  Used chunky spaget. sauce and parm. because that's all I had.  Will keep pesto on hand now for nights when I'm tired or when I don't know what to make.

This is easy and so flavorful.  I add a little more pesto than the recipe calls for, for extra flavor.  I also place the sliced tomatoes on top of the cheese, and it looks fancy enough for a dinner party.  Try this!

My husband thought he'd walked into the wrong house because I don't normally cook things that look like the come "out of a restaurant".  He loved it. I let it marinate about an hour in the fridge first--it tasted great!

Turns out if you don't like pesto you won't like this lol but everyone else in my family LOVED it.  The chicken was lovely and moist and I served it with a nice pasta salad.  They say I've to make it again tomorrow!

This was very easy and very good.  The chicken turned out just right not too dry.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it needed a little more seasoning then just the pesto.  Next time I would add salt and pepper.

I just made this chicken with a few changes.  First, I marinated the chicken for 10-15 minutes with a few spices (italian seasoning, basil, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, meat tenderizing powder, garlic powder).  Then, I dipped the chicken in egg and then in panko (with garlic powder, parmesan, pepper and salt added).  I then put the chicken on a baking tray and spread pesto over the top.  Then I grated the mozzarella and put it on top.  It was EXCELLENT and i really think that the panko made a HUUUUGE difference.

This is a great and easy chicken recipe.  I did not change anything except maybe add a little more cheese than indicated .... I LOVE CHEESE.  This recipe has made its way into the regular meal rotation.  If you like pesto definitely try this one.

Definite keeper! I used Jennifer's suggestions - seasoning the chicken before spooning on the pesto and then coating the chicken with Italian bread crumbs. One of the easiest and tastiest meals I've ever made!

Excellent recipe.  Very flavorful without being to bold. Tender and juicy.  Is now one of the family favorites.  I accompanied it by the Garlic Linguine and fresh steamied broccoli, for a nice Italian tasting meal. Thanks

This recipe was so easy, and so impressive! My husband loved it- he thought the pesto would overpower everything, but it baked into the chicken very nicely. This will be great to make for guests- fast and easy to prepare, and makes a beautiful dish. The time it takes in the oven is just right for making a pasta sidedish (we made a pasta primavera). The foil on the pan makes for a super-fast clean-up, too!

I just wanted to give a quick thanks to whomever submitted this recipe.  I've been cooking this for the past year and it's become a family favorite.  When pesto sauce doesn't meet the budget, I've found that it can be replaced with Italian dressing.

Thanks again!

Very good.  I used homemade pesto.  Pounding the chicken breasts before coating with pesto would improve this recipe even more.

I love the idea of this recipe. It was very good and the family enjoyed it, but we all agreed that next time I will make my own pesto sauce. Thanks for sharing.

I have recently began to cook with pesto and this was definately a good place to start. It was simple, flavorful, and juicy. I will definately make it agian.

I'd say this is a great recipe for someone who is better at cooking than I am! I cooked the chicken too long, making it very dry. The mozzarella cheese helped that out a bit, but if I had made this well, I'd eat it every day!

oooh, this was good!  i followed the recipe to the T.  the tomato gave the chicken a little bit of juiciness, becuase the chicken kinda tended to become dry.  anything with pesto is always good!  and you can always use the leftover tomatoes, pesto and mozzarella cheese as little appetizers later on.  YUMMY!

Chicken came out tender and juicy, and the recipe was a snap. For all the pesto involved, I did not think the chicken was overly flavorful.

We used Barilla pesto (couldn't find Buitoni) and fresh (water-packed) mozzarella. The results were absolutely delicious!  It was so easy to make--and fancy enough for company.

Very good and easy.  Made it with my own pesto (used the "Pesto" recipe from the site) that had been in the refrigerator for a week.  I let it sit for about 30 minutes before I cooked it.  Will make again.

Bland and very oily.  Make something lighter and tastier with chicken marinated in italian dressing, chicken, and basil topped with cheese and tomato.  I was really disappointed by this.  Not made with Buitoni pesto, for what it's worth - the pesto might be really good.

This was a big hit with my whole family! Plus, since two weren't able to make it on time, I had to leave the chicken in the oven too long -- which usually means DRY chicken -- but it was still delicious!!! This was a great recipe!

I'm in the minority this time! I made this for Christmas (and even marinated the chicken in the pesto first), and it was a big loser. The green and red color would, I thought, appeal, but we're apparently not big on pesto on chicken (and I adore pesto). I won't make this again.

Beware the nuts!  I'm allergic to nuts and didn't realize that the pesto sauce has nuts in it.  The first three bites were delicious, though, and my hubby enjoyed my portion as well as his own. I did marinate the chicken in the pesto sauce for a few hours, and cooked the chicken with the mushrooms on it as suggested in the earlier review.

This was the best! So easy to prepare and while it cooked I made a tossed salad to go with the chicken.
