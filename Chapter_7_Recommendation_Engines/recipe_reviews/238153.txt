I made it twice, and I liked it more when I didn't add artichokes. Also, a teaspoon is a little too much salt (considering vegetable broth already has some salt in it). Peppers need to be sauteed much longer than 3 minutes and/or cut into smaller pieces or they'll still be much too crunchy.  Overall a great recipe that I will be using again (with my changes).

Made quite a few changes. I used saffron not turmeric as it is easy to come by in Turkey.  I did not use any vegetable broth but instead used 1 cup white wine.  Also I did not use bell peppers, artichoke or peas but instead used zucchini, mushrooms, tomato, eggplant, and three small hot chilies. Turned out flavourful and full of healthy vegetables.  I did sauté the vegetables before hand for 3-5 minutes before adding rice etc..

My son and I both loved it.  My husband missed the meat but if he could add some shrimp he would love it.  I used a wild rice blend instead of white rice because it is healthier.  This will be a regular at my house!

Made it exactly according to the recipe. My daughter is a vegan and she raved about it. I am not a vegan but will be having this many times. Thanks!

This was fabulous!  My vegan daughter is still raving about it a week later.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter, except I did not presoak the rice (couldn’t see why it would make a difference), and I also added some sautéed Trader Joe’s Soy Chorizo at the end.  I can’t think of anything I would do differently—a winner!  I served it with  the wonderful Vegetarian Sweet Potato Burritos, also from this site.  Thanks for the post!

Great recipe - used brown rice instead of white and added a Pasilla pepper and hot sauce (because I like it spicy), as well as Veggie Crumblers for protein.

Delicious! I did make a few modifications for ingredients I did or did not have - I did not use green or red peppers, artichokes, or peas. I used 3 zucchini, 2 Italian eggplant and 3 chopped tomatoes. Also, for the broth I used vege broth seasoning and 1 cup of dry white wine and a dried hot pepper. The flavor was excellent and I will definitely be making this again!

really good and easy. I am going salt-free, and this meal turned out delicious without adding any salt. I did, however add a table spoon of Bragg's liquid aminos for a kick, and 1 jalapeno pepper. Will make it again!

This was a fun recipe. I added some fresh hatch peppers and some saffron. I forgot the peas and artichokes, but that gives me an excuse to try it with those next time.

Very easy to make and tasty to boot. I only made two substitutions. Instead of peas, I used a cup of frozen peas, carrots, and green beans. I also substituted Adobo all purpose seasoning for the salt. Thank you for this flexible and tasty recipe.

This turned out really tasty. I made it for my hubby who recently made the decision to become vegan. He loved it! Made a few changes - left out the artichokes and added mushrooms and tofu for protein. Used brown rice instead of white. I will definitely make this again!

Recipe turned out well enough, I followed the advice of another reviewer and added Soy Chorizo at the end and that really made the dish in my opinion. Without adding it there’s something missing that I can’t quite put my finger on...but with the soy chorizo it is so good you’ll have to stop yourself from eating it all in one sitting.

I added more vegetables and used white wine instead of the vegetable broth.  A bit bland - I added more turmeric and then salted at the table. I will make this again, but try a few more spices while it is cooking.

So good- I made a few. Minor tweaks. I added saffron and used smoke paprika And added chicken thigh meat :) which I highly recommend. I fully failed at using brown basmati rice. It never fully cooked. Otherwise this recipe was fantastic.

This recipe is very bland. I did not have the garlic on hand and had to improvise with garlic salt but even then it could use more salt and add some black pepper, maybe even something spicy. Makes a lot of food though, so I will be trying again but definitely needs work.

I made this using a tomato paste packet. I did not use the artichoke either. The end result was excellent and my kids ask for it whenever they come over.
