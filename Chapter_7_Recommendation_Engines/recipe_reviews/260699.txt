10.24.18 This turned out pretty well. The ginger overpowered the orange flavor so I ll cut that back next time and add some orange zest to make it a bit more orange-y. Was a little concerned because when the chicken came out of the oven it really hadn t browned much even though I d given it a good spray of oil half way through. Not to worry once you mix it into the sauce it ends looking very good. Like this and would make again.

I had baked chicken and oranges in the house and needed a quick meal. I skipped the flour and egg as my chicken was already baked. I diced the cooked chicken make the sauce then heated the chicken in the in sauce. Made some Minute Rice put it in a bowl and sprinted some sesame seeds on top. Looks just like the picture and the taste...delicious! From idea to eating I had this made in about 15 minutes! YUM!

It was really good! But instead of using regular Panko are used coconut Panko also instead of making the sauce I used Panda Express orange sauce. Cooking time took about an hour,probably because I suck at cutting chicken

The sauce did not taste good-followed the directions-would not thicken, then tried it before putting it on the chicken and decided to not use it. Not sure what went wrong but no. The chicken was good though-we ate them as chicken nuggets.

Made this last night. Got a big thumbs up and "need to make this again" comment. Changes made were to reduce ginger as mentioned by others. Dish would have been overpowered if I used ginger as specified. To add to it I tossed in fresh broccoli and water chestnuts at the end. Served with jasmine rice. Very good and easy to make

I usually dislike reading reviews that aren't about the recipe because so many changes were made the recipe is barely recognizeable. But here I go. I liked the recipe a lot and did the chicken exactly as instructed. Where I went off the track was for the sauce. I'm not that crazy about soy sauce. And I had a bottle of Katsu sauce in the refrigerator. So I used Katsu (no soy sauce and no honey because the Katsu is sweet) juice of an orange garlic powder and lots of freshly grated ginger and the cornstarch. I really loved this sauce. The second go-round I added carrots turnips onions and yellow bell pepper--and served on rice.

The chicken was cooked perfectly but I didn't have the best luck with the sauce. We thought it was bland and not very orange tasting. I will try it again because my sauce didn't get too thick either. Thanks though.

This simple recipe was a big hit with my family... so big they requested I cook it at least twice a month! Hint: Add orange zest for deeper flavor layers. I also added chopped green onion to sauce. Yum! Adding toasted sesame seeds when plating is a great touch if desired.

This isn't very good at all. The orange sauce doesn't have much of an orange taste and the soy sauce overpowers it. The sauce with ginger and garlic powder isn't a good combination.

too much ginger!! I liked this recipe the first time I made it but after noticing how much the ginger consumed the flavor I had to make changes! cut the ginger by 1/2 - 3/4. way better (.....in my opinion) once the ginger was cut

Liked the breaded chicken part. Used Panko crumbs. The sauce was awful - too much orange and ginger. The smell was horrible. Glad the sauce was made separately so I didn t ruin the chicken! Will make the chicken part again.

I only gave 4 stars because of the tweaks I made to the sauce after following the recipe exactly as written. I used fresh grated ginger instead of ground....and I added 1/4 cup of orange juice concentrate because the soy sauce overpowered the orange flavor. To give it a bit of a kick I also added some red pepper flakes (my family likes spicy). Everyone loved it - and told me to make sure I make it part of a monthly rotation.
