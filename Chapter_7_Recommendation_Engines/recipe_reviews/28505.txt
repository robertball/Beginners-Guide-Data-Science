I needed a "different" jello salad for a recent potluck. Wow! This is definately it! Everyone enjoyed the refreshing, zippy combination of flavors. Thanks Elaine.

I made this over the holidays and it just wasn't quite what I was looking for or "remembered" as a child. I love nuts in anything but in this recipe it overpowered every single bite. All I could taste were pecans. It wasn't bad but I'll keep looking. As a child I remembered the mixture having cream cheese instead of mayo. Not bad but I probably won't make it again.

The grandchildren helped me put this together and the 4 year old was quite skeptical, asking me if I knew what I was doing putting all that "stuff" in her Jello! We put it in an oiled mold which made it extra special. Some of the grownups ate it..Kids and hubby aren't crazy about it though. Great, tasty and easy recipe Maybe more suited for ladies luncheons? - Thanks

This is the same recipe as Horseradish Gelatin Salad by June Pelo.  When I made it I thought it was to mayonnaisey.  My kids wouldn't eat it, though forced to taste it of course!

I really wanted to give this five stars, but the younger folks at the table didn't like it nearly as much as we older ones did.
