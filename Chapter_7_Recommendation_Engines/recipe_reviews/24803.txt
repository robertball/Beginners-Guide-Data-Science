This is very good!  It's a warm-the-tummy meal. I can just see eating it in a mountain cabin on a ski trip.( It reminds me of Frito Pie!) My husband LOVED it. In fact, he has requested that it be a "tradition" on Monday nights when he watches his football games. I used the Hormel Chili with no beans. I think next time I will garnish it with some other Nacho things like tomatoes, sour cream, guacomole, and hubby says especially sliced jalapenos for him. Thanks for sharing. I love these kind of filling, easy-on-the-budget homecooked meals

Sorry to say we were a little disappointed with this recipe. It was a little too soupy and rather bland. I might try it again with more seasoning.

Very good. I also added chopped tomato, and a dollup of sour cream. I made my own nacho cheese soup though. Too expensive and too salty to buy the canned.

My family loved this one! I made my own chili and left the chips whole and everyone mopped it up! I think this would be good to serve for a party with lots of topping options.

This meal was delicous.  I had tons of 6 inch corn tortillas so I decided to fry them in oil to make my own chips for this recipe.  It tasted so much better than nachos with regular tortilla chips.  Fattening but worth it!

Not bad.  I made about half as much and used nacho cheese sauce I needed to use up instead of the soup.  I also just mixed the chili in with the soup and milk so as to avoid dirtying 2 pans.  This is actually pretty good for what's in it.  We love the multi grain tortilla chips and they went quite well with this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Worked better just to use all these ingredients and make regular nachos...this came out a bit soggy and bland.

Ok, well, made this for March Madness game watching. First of all the taste is very, very good. The guys in my house loved it, but I thought that the texture was weird since the chips, obviously, get soggy immediately. They want again, but if it was up to me I wouldn't make again.

I love nachos and this was a nice change from my usual recipe.  My fiance and I finished up the whole thing but we were VERY full afterwards!
