Love it! Must use BAKING gumdrops/gums; you can't substitute regular gumdrops or JuJubes, etc because they will just melt. Adds colour & whimsy to your plate of holiday goodies. We replaced our old gumdrop loaf recipe with this one as it's much better.

This is the same recipe that my grandma made for years--I can still see her in the kitchen cutting up the gumdrops with her scissors.  One helpful hint is to keep the sugar handy to dip your scissors in when they get too sticky.  I've tried freezing the gumdrops and using the food processor but that doesn't work very well and was extremely noisy!!  This is a very tasty "fruit"cake--not what traditionally is thought of as a fruit cake.  I hope you decide to try this one and I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy this piece of our family's Christmas tradition too!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Glenda=-)

My mom used to make this every Christmas too. Someone had mentioned in their review they didn't cook the nuts.  If you warm the nuts in butter over low heat, the flavor will be more enhanced.  Anyway, my mom got this recipe from her Brother-in-laws mother way back when.  My mom had made the gumdrop cake for over 40 years.  I thought my sisters and I were the only ones who had this recipe.  Small world.  It's a tradition that we've carried on throughout the years. It's a sure thing Christmas is just around the corner when this is baking!

Very tasty and moist fruitcake and doesn't use expensive candied fruit either!  I didn't bother with frying the pecans, but did follow the recipe other than that.  I made 8 mini loaves to put on Christmas platters for neighbors and friends.  I would recommend everyone try this one, it's a keeper!!  I did drizzle two teaspoons of apple juice on each loaf after it had cool completely.

Lost my recipe and have been searching for one like it.  Was so glad to find this!  Thanks for posting it.  This is so much better than the traditional fruitcake-no moans and groans when you give it!  My family loves this and so did everyone I gave it to.

My grandmother made this when I was a child (I'm 72). This is the exact recipe....I make no changes. I get yearly requests for this fruitcake including from my daughter's coworkers.
