Excellent! Everyone liked it from kids to grandma. 

Made a few changes: 1. At the start: 1.5x the vinegar and teriyaki to make more sauce; added 1/8 C lime juice, 2T sesame oil, 1/4 t lemon peel at beginning of roast.  2. I added the red pepper 1 hr before the end of the roast.
3.At the end of the roast period, upped peanut butter to 1/2 cup and added 1 T hot sauce and about 3-4 T brown sugar (to taste) with the peanut butter.

I think this recipe suffers from an identity crisis.  There is nothing "Thai" about this dish.  Teriyaki, a Japanese sauce, is combined with peanut butter to emulate satay-style pork.  But that needs to be grilled for best effect.  In order to give it more of a Thai flavor, I added a kaffir lime leaf, a bit of fish sauce instead of the teriyaki, and some shallots.  All in all, the taste was okay, but too peanut buttery.  And shredded peanut butter pork on rice just felt...wrong.  It was tender and pulled very easily, but I think it is more suited to a sandwich or something.  Not bad, but I found myself asking "what do I DO with this stuff?"

Good!  I had to substitute low-sodium soy sauce for the teriyaki (thought I had some but I didn't).  Also used skinny pork chops and didnt' shred them.  Added some lime juice, and fresh lime slices on the side when we ate.  Made brown rice instead of white.

Really good. I did make a some of changes though. I used a 2lb roast with some ginger-garlic paste, adding no vegetables. At the end I stir-fried the peppers and some julienned (matchstick)carrots.  After all was combined I added thai chili paste and fresh cilanro.  The peanut butter thickens as you cook it, so I will try making a little extra sauce the next time. Great recipe.

This is my husband's favorite recipe. Be sure and thoroughly stir the peanut butter into the drippings left in the pan. It works best when the drippings are still hot. Then add the pork shreds back in and stir - YUM!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe yesterday.  While we did find it under-spiced for our tastes, we by NO means found it bland or flavor-less. We just added in our own extra red pepper, hot sesame oil, and teriyaki or soy sauce to suit our own tastes.  If you were serving this for a mixed crowd - this is definitely the way to go - as you don't know who is spice-adverse.  I must say though, that I didn't measure my PB exactly - so I may have used a bit more than the recipe called for.  

Also, after the pork cooled for a bit in the slow cooker - the peanut butter flavor really hit it's peak and it was wonderful!  Next time I make it - I think I will leave a bit more time for the shredded pork to cook in the juices and then SLIGHTLY cool in the slow cooker before serving.  I am looking forward to leftovers tonight.

Next time, I will add red bell pepper later in the cooking.  There was nothing left of these vegetables.  Also will add more red pepper and probably some Thai chilli paste, as I thought it was a bit bland.  May try to double the sauce so there is more of it, but this could also be that my slow-cooker cooks at a hotter temp.
Overall, a good recipe.

This had a nice flavor, but there was almost too much going on - too rich.  I put chopped peanuts and cilantro on top and it made it much better.  The green of the cilantro really helped to cut the richness of the dish.  I couldn't eat it without it.  I followed other reviews and added the peppers (and broccoli) much later in the cooking.  It was almost pointless.  They just disintegrated.  Only use peppers, and add them close to finishing the dish - maybe 1/2 hour or 45 minutes.

Very successful dish! The meat and rice seemed plain so I added a side of stir-fry napa cabbage, carrots, and onion done "fake pad thai" style (ketchup, vinegar, sugar. I'll make this again.

I love this recipe, but for me it needed a lot of tweaking - first of all, I'm a fan of a little heat, and there was not enough red pepper flakes to deliver that. So increase the pepper by a lot. I probably ended up using about 2 tablespoons.  More peanut butter - I wanted a sweeter, thicker sauce.  Other than that, wow! awesome!

Pretty Tasty. I will add about a 1/2 cup of Shriracha sauce next time, to add some spice.

This may be good, but it is not Thai. Teriyaki is a Japanese ingredient. I'm rating this low, because you can't put in some peanuts and call it "Thai." The teriyaki makes it taste nothing like a Thai dish.

Excellent flavor.  I like to top rice with some julienned red cabbage, broccoli slaw and some chopped cilantro.  Serve with lime wedges.  I've made it a couple of times and everyone (even my picky kids) loves it.  Maybe it's not traditional Thai, but it's delicious.

This was pretty good, made as directed. I wanted a bigger Thai inspired taste, so I doctored it up by adding 2 TBS sesame oil instead of the peanut butter. Right before I served it, I squeezed fresh lime juice, added Thai basil and cilantro and fresh bean sprouts. I plated the pork with sticky rice and boston lettuce leaves and the entire thing disappeared. Next time, I will double the meat! Thank you...

good dish. I liked how easy it was. It seemed to be missing some flavor. I think more soy sauce and less teriyaki would help.

The family really enjoyed this.  We like things a little spicier, so I added a shot of chile garlic paste at the same time I stirred in the peanut butter.  It gave the dish just the right kick!  The rest of the flavors were nicely balanced, too.  A definite make-again dish.

This did not go over well at all.  However, I admit I made some changes… I used fish sauce instead of teriyaki, red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar, and added some red chili paste.  It was probably the fish sauce that caused the whole darn thing to taste like tuna fish.  I added more peanut butter, added more red pepper flakes…nope, still tuna fish.  I can say that the pork shredded beautifully. My family will not allow me to try this recipe again, and I have to eat all the leftovers myself, but I’ve found that adding a little honey cuts that fish taste.

The flavour was so great. It was even better the second day. I'm not sure how integral the bell peppers are for the whole course of the cooking time- I'm going to try adding them in for the last 30 minutes or so and then they won't be so soft. Will definitely make this again.

I *LOVE* this recipe.  It's my favorite way to cook pork in the crock pot.  Sometimes we add pineapple chunks or sliced carrots for an added level of flavor.  It's delicious!

Good simple recipe, and delicious.  Modified to my own taste.  Added some sliced pieces of lemon grass and sliced ginger.  Made my own Teriyaki (1:1 Soy Sauce:Mirin).  Remove the lemon grass and ginger with a slotted spoon before adding the shredded pork back in.

Great recipe... took others advice and used a combination of fish sauce and low sodium soya sauce to replace the teriyaki, added 2 T sesame oil, lime juice and a chili paste instead of the flakes.  Delicious and my toddler asked for seconds!

Love this recipe! I added about 2 tbsp. of sriracha sauce for some extra heat.  The peppers turn to mush if you put them in at the beginning.  Adding them at the last hour is perfect (though unfortunately less convenient as a slow cooker meal).

This was great! All the food tasted great, the meals did not taste or look similar.  My husband did not believe that most of it was left over from the two crock pot meals.  Often a menu calls for buying unusual ingredients that you use only once, this one did not.  All the items bought in were used up. There was plenty of food for everyone.  I have recommended it to many friends.

The sauce was great and we served with lemon wedges. I like the idea of adding shredded cabbage too. A bit spicy so was not good for our toddler. The pork we used was TOUGH so I was surprised that  after all that cooking it did not get tender.

As many other reviewers have pointed out, this isn't really a "Thai" dish, but it's still AWESOME!!   A favorite in our house, even the pickiest eaters like it.   I've made it with many different cuts of pork and I rarely measure anything and it always comes out great.    I usually add some hot sauce, lemon zest and/or lemon grass (depending on what I have), as well as ginger and extra liquids.   Last time I added some lime zest to the rice before serving and that little extra really made the rice stand out.   Also, this makes great left overs.

I made this using pork loin chops. Very quick and easy to get going, good for the days when you don't have a lot of time. After reading the reviews, I waited until the last 45 minutes of cooking to add the pepper so they wouldn't turn to mush. I also added a couple of cut of carrots at that time, too. It turned out quite yummy, but I think it could have used more heat. Next time I will add more red pepper flakes.

I thought this was very good!  I increased the amount of teriyaki and rice wine vinegar so that there would be a little more sauce, and I, too, put the red pepper in the crock pot during the last hour of cooking.  I also increased the peanut butter, but next time, I'll use the amount suggested in the recipe.  Both of my boys tasted it and said that something was missing.  They then sprinkled it with "Rooster" sauce (Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce), and that did the trick!  It just wasn't hot enough for them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was okay. Although I like all the things that went into it, the taste got to me, and I ended up throwing half of it out. I wouldn't make it again.

I have made this recipe a couple of times because it is so good.  I spiced it up with hot chili flakes, and also added a can of pineapple at the very end for some extra flavour.  Delicious!

This was awesome.  I used a sirloin pork roast and served with brown rice.  If 6 stars were available, I'd rate it a 6!  I added 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of 1/2 tsp.  My husband told me to hold on to this recipe.  We'll be trying it again.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used pork chops cut into bite size pieces and doubled the liquids because I like a lot of sauce. I'll make this again.

This was wonderful! I followed the original recipe with the exception of adding the red peppers about an hour before it was ready and serving it with brown rice instead of white. I could/will definitely play with this recipe more and come up with fun ways to add flavors (i.e. adding cabbage, trying something besides peanut butter, etc.). I definitely recommend adding hot chili paste/sauce/whatever spice suits you! Yum and thanks! Oh, and excellent leftovers too!

My whole family liked this. I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I added a splash of white distilled. Also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar but I still didn't think it was sweet enough, at least, I thought it was missing a sweet element. No one else seemed to! I could have used a bit more kick, personally, but I'm the only heat-lover in this house. Served over Thai rice noodles.

My family enjoyed this recipe, especially the peanut butter sauce. The topping of chopped green onions and peanuts gave it a great crunchy topping.  It's a good crock pot recipe for those busy days.

Made this last night.  Family went nuts for it.  Husband, who wouldn't eat a leftover if he was starving to death, asked after dinner if he could have the leftovers for dinner tonight.  Used half a "picnic" packed shoulder and trimmed the fat.  Really, really flavorful.

The first time I made this, the red bell peppers turned out mushy.  The second time I made it i just added some jarred roasted red peppers with the peanut butter and it was much better.

This has become a standard in our home and is very quick and easy.  Only change I make is to add the red peppers at the end.  Great, easy and inexpensive.  Can't ask for better than that.

This just didn't do it for us.  The peanut butter made it too rich and covered up the other flavors too much.  I rated a 2, DH said it could be a 4 with some work, thus the 3 rating.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.

I thought this was really good.  I doubled the teriyaki, peanut butter and vinegar to make extra sauce, and added garlic.  I also stir-fried the peppers and some carrots separately to add as kind of a side dish.  It was easy and cheap.  I think it's important to use a quality teriyaki since that is where all the flavor comes from.

I was excited about this because I spent some time in Thailand and was looking forward to some authentic tastes.  I was disappointed.  I couldn't find teriyaki sauce with no sodium (I could only find low sodium) so maybe that's why we didn't like it, it was really salty tasting (that was my fault) but we didn't like the overall taste anyway.  My husband and I decided it was just okay, sorta bland, and we won't be trying it again.  Everyone's tastes are diffent, though, thanks for the easy recipe.

Loved it!  I used two port tenderloins and added some broccoli.  The next day, I heated it up and put some mild curry paste in, it added some heat and changed the flavour abit.  I'll use this again for sure.

This was quite good.  Based on the comments of other reviewers, I did not add the red peppers until about an hour before the pork was done - they were still tender but not mushy.  Next time I'll add a little more heat and maybe a little more peanut butter.

This is a family favorite! The only change I make is to double or triple the sauce because we love it so much! Oh, and also we sometimes add mint instead of green onions (because we have that growing in our herb garden and no green onions)  which combines with the chopped peanuts, meat and sauce for a delightful flavor.

This is a keeper. The only thing I did different was to add the peppers at the end, so that they were still crisp, along with thinly sliced sweet onion.

Followed the recipe to a T (except for the peppers.. I didn't want bell-pepper mush) but it was too salty and there wasn't enough sauce. Maybe cause i used unsalted unsweetened peanut butter? Otherwise the recipe works well. I will try to fuss with the proportions to get it just right. And, as others mentioned, it is not particularly flavorful but that is ok for me. My two girls at it as-is and my husband and I flavored it with garlic-chili sauce and/ou angry chicken (schricha or something like that?) et/ou lime juice. Yummy

The whole house loved this, I made it just as directed. Next time might add a little lime juice. Served with Spicy Green Beans and cucumber slices - yum!

My kids like this ok.  Hubby doesn't care for it.  I find it ok, but a bit much after a few bites.  Not sure how I might change it more to our tastes, but I think I will probably give this one more try.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I substituted Sunflower Butter for the Peanut Butter and Soy Nuts for the Peanuts due to food allergy to Peanuts.  My husband likes Asian/Thai food but it is difficult for us to eat at these types of restaurants due to the food allergy.  Recipes like this make it easier for cooks to make a Thai sauce with the appropriate substitutions.  The sauce may have been a tad sweeter than what would have been with the Peanut Butter, but it was still excellent.  My husband raved about it.

This was pretty good, I would make it again.  I didn't care for the texture of the peppers after being cooked.

This was delicious!  My whole family loved this dish.  I made noodles the next day with leftovers (we ate all the rice) and it was still delicious.  I also threw some in a tortilla for my daughter and she loved it.  I added chili garlic sauce vs the flakes, I will add more next time, it was not hot enough for me.  A definate keeper!

I actually thought this was better before I added the peanuts and the peanut butter.  Is that crazy or what?  Totally changed the dish in my mind but not for the better.

This turned out great!  I only had pork tenderloin (not shoulder roast) but it worked just fine.  It turned out really tender.  It wasn't quite as spicy as I expected, which I was kind of disappointed with, but it went over well with my family, including my sis, who tends to be on the picky side.

The first time I made this I couldn't find pork shoulder so I used pork butt. Then after using the pork shoulder I then decided to continue to use the butt. It doesn't have a bone all you have to do it cut the strings. I love it!

I really liked this recipe served with white rice. I did add the peppers at the end of cooking and that worked well.I made a huge batch and froze packets of it for a quick week night dinner!

Wow, fantastic!  Instead of red pepper flakes, we used Thai garlic chile sauce (about 1 tsp).  I also used a bit of cornstarch to thicken.  We ate it the first night over rice, and the next night on buns like BBQ.  I froze the leftovers, and am looking forward to a tasty, quick meal in the future.

This was very tasty, moist and tender. I would add more flavor to the sauce by adding additional teriyaki.

We're not the biggest fans of pork sholder but there was one taking up room in the freezer so I tried this out.  I was impressed with how tasty it came out (with some cilantro sprinkled on top) and how easy it was to make!

Awesome!! We are very picky about the recipes we try on this site. We usually only try the ones with tons of good ratings. This was REALLY GOOD. Couldn't find a 3lb Pork Shoulder "roast" so used 2.5lbs of Pork Shoulder "Steaks". Also, the only no salt peanut butter we could find was crunchy, and it still turned out great. Sauce was plenty thick for us. As some suggested I added 1 Tbs of Thai Chili paste and red pepper flakes. We served this over rice and it was awesome. Very rich, but awesome. Restaurant quality for sure. Thanks!!

This was okay, although I probably can't give it a fair rating since I'm not that big of a pork eater. Despite that, I thought all of the flavors blended quite nicely.

Delicious! Was even better the next day! So simple and easy. Next time, I will add the peppers in the middle of cooking as they did cook down a lot. Also, I will try the chili paste for some heat.

I was really enthusiastic about this recipe and it sure smelled good while it was cooking. Although I thought the peanut butter would be the perfect touch (and it was good) I think I am going to try it next time without the peanut butter and just thicken the sauce with cornstarch. I also added a couple of minced serrano chiles, and I think I will add 4 or 5 next time. I barely detected any heat at all even with the 2 I put in.
