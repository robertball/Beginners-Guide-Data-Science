My first review! I made this today, because it seemed easy and worry free. I followed the recipe exactly as written. When it was done, it just seemed to miss something, IMO. So I added some shredded colby and jack cheese, and a dallop of sour cream on top. Sooo much better with the cheese and sour cream! I think some lean ground meat would be a plus also!

This is great. So easy. I've made it a couple of times for work goodie days and everyone loves it. I've had to hand out a number of copies of the recipe. One lady made it for supper and added hamburger. There were no leftovers. I will keep this recipe and continue to make it.

Great recipe!  Made exactly as recipe stated, except I added chopped cilantro.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again.  Will definitely be adding to our meal rotation.

My family really loved this soup. I did not have green chilies on hand, so I added a bit of salsa. Very nice with cornbread.

I had every intention of following this recipe exactly.  I ended up leaving out the stewed tomatoes because several of the guys don't care for tomatoes and added a can of pinto beans because I had them.  I also added 1/2 an onion and 1/2 a jalepeno.  I served with cheese & sour cream on top and cornbread & tortilla chips on the side.  This only made 6 servings for us.

Super cheap, easy, and delicious. My boyfriend put in a small can of chopped jalapenos instead of the green chilis (by accident), which was a good mistake, since it made it spicy in a good way. I would suggest only using about half a can of jalapenos, though (even if you like spicy stuff).

This was very good!  I sauteed onion and garlic in EVOO and added hot italian sausage.  Also added an extra can of black beans.  I love spicy, so I subbed one can of jalapenos for the diced chiles.  Will make again..

This was delish.  I only used one can of tomatoes with chilies and 2 tbsp chili pepper (I figured I can always add more heat if necessary).    I had some turkey sausage in the fridge which I browned and added to it just because.  Everybody liked it.

This was a nice soup. For us though it tasted more like a slightly spicy minestrone and we were looking for a different type of black bean soup.

A great dish on a budget.  Adding this to the family cookbook.  Make sure to rinse beans (either soaked or canned) to get rid of extra salt/starch.  If you add the bean water, you'll get a thick, unappealing "sauce".

Were it up to me, I would have only given this two or three stars, but my family LOVED it.  I thought it tasted like a watered down chili.  I added some shredded cheddar to my bowl of soup and that helped.  If I make it again (it is so easy and the family loves it, so how can I not?), I will add an onion.

This is so easy and tastes awesome! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: one can green chilis instead of 2, frozen corn instead of canned, fresh minced garlic (I used 2 cloves) instead of dried, and only about 1/2 cup chicken broth because I had some left from a box. Also added one small yellow onion diced up. On a whim, I added a whole bunch of fresh cilantro during the last 30 minutes of cooking because it was going to go bad in my fridge! Because I was down a few ingredients, I actually did not drain any of the beans or the tomatoes and it still turned out fine.  I'm only rating this four stars because I think it needs the cilantro. It makes it taste fresh and balances the spiciness from the chili powder and cumin well.  I topped it with pepper jack cheese and crumbled lime-flavored tortilla chips and it was really hearty and filling.  Also freezes and reheats like a dream.  I ate this for lunch for a week! I'll make this again and again.

I left out the chili powder (my husband added some to his bowl) because we have little ones who dislike spiciness.  I also added cooked, shredded chicken and we topped it with Mexican cheese and sour cream.  Great soup for a busy family - I love slow cooker meals during soccer season!

Worked great for me, as is, forgot the green onions though.  Served for friends from Alaska, with chipotle-spiced steak and mushrooms, and a salad.  They always appreciate my home cooked meals.

Awesome! I tweaked this recipe just a tiny bit, added some more chili powder and a couple chopped up jalapenos, as well as 4 cloves of chopped garlic. Also a few tablespoons of my favo hot sauce Tapatio.  WOW. Nice and spicy, just the way I like it! This recipe is fine just the way it is, unless you're like me and dump tabasco on everything ;) I even liked it without any meat added, which is rare for a carnivore like me. Serve with some cornbread and you're happy.

This was just OK. It tasted sort of "canned." It sure was easy though. I threw it together in just a few minutes before I headed to work in the morning. I don't know that I would make it again. It wasn't anything special.

This was good.  It was a little spicy for me, but still good.  My husband loved it.  My 6 year old didn't like it, but he did eat some beans. I cut the recipe in half for 2 adults and 2 kids.  I still had some left over.

Loved it! I made a corn bread recipe from Allrecipes that went great with this soup. My husband loves soups and I always try to find something a little different. I will use it again!

I made this because I was in a rush, and even though I only had one can of chilies and no stewed tomatoes, it turned out great! This one is definitely a keeper for last minute dinners!!! Yum.

Very easy! I followed some of the previous advice and saved 1/2 the beans aside and blended the rest. It gave it a more hearty texture. My carnivorous husband loved it.

This recipe was super easy to make.  I added cayenne pepper, which made mine WAY too spicy.  Next time I'll mix in ground beef or turkey sausage.  And I'll scale back on the other spices.  It had a really nice flavor, though.

A little bland for our taste. Prefer chili more. Probably won't make again.

This is great - maybe even better with meat?

This is my all-time favorite winter soup!  I have probably made this 5-6 times.  My husband and I love spicy food so I have made changes, but it's still good as is.  I add 3 cans of green chilies and 3 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder.  I sometimes add about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it extra kick.  I also use half a bag of frozen corn instead of the canned corn.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

this soup is great! it is really easy, i made it in a few minutes before i went to work in the morning and it tastes great! i will definatly make this again. instead of adding the 2 cans of green chillies i added some chipolte peppers in abodo sauce, it was really good that way. and i added some yellow onion as well as the green onion. this soup is perfect for a cold winter day or a hearty summer dinner. great recipe!!

Easy and delicious! I used only 4 tsp Chili Powder and the dish still had a nice amount of heat.  I also substitued the Chicken Broth with a can of Swanson's Vegetable Broth.  Goes great with an ice cold beer and the Buttery Cornbread recipe available from this site.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful. Rich and hearty vegetarian chili, full of flavor and protein. Perfect to warm us up on cold winter nights. Thank you so much for posting!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It is definitely a repeat recipe for us. I did alter how much chili powder I put in, decreasing the amount to 2 tbsp. It still had plenty of kick to it!

I only gave this recipe 4 stars, that is until I added about 1 1/2 lbs. of round steak cut and browned with celery and onion.  Now, it is definitely a 5 star recipe.  My family loved it.

The funny thing about this is I printed out this recipe last year and didn't try it until last week.  It is a very flavorful, filing, soup.  My family was commenting on the aroma as it was cooking.  Next time, I have to make a double batch if I want leftovers.

quick and easy recipe. Very tasty, though I didn't have all the ingredients so I used a half large regular onion, fresh minced garlic and tomatoes, veggie griller meat, fresh corn and added coriander. Thanks!
