For those of you who are hesitant to try this recipe because of the cost of Gruyere, I have a tip. Grate cheap grocery store brand Swiss cheese; it costs roughly $3 per pound instead of $18 or so per pound like Gruyere. Then pour about 3 T. of white wine over the 2 C. of the Swiss, toss, and let sit for at least 15 minutes. When ready to use, blot with a paper towel to remove excess wine, and it will remarkably cook up just like Gruyere. Your palate won't know the difference, but your pocketbook will!

The following is my review for this outstanding recipe that I reviewed when it was still a personal recipe. Reviewed on Nov. 22, 2011 by Avon
Thanks Celeste for the perfect, perfect au gratin potato recipe. Such a simple and yet elegant taste. Easy to put together and whatever you do, don't skimp on the ingredients. Use fresh ground nutmeg, the heavy cream, the yukon golds, and most of all the gruyere. It's not everynight of the week anyone needs to splurge on something so decadent, but for a special occasion or to make a meal memorable, just do i t. You won't be sorry.

Potato perfection.   I chose to slice my potatoes a little thicker, perhaps between 1/8 and 1/4 inch, and only boiled them a few minutes to ensure they would not be reduced to mush.  I’d do so exactly the same next time.   These are, indeed, rich and creamy and develop a beautiful and extra delicious golden brown crust as they bake.  I loved the subtle flavor of the nutmeg (fresh does make a big difference I believe), which was an ideal choice to enhance, just slightly, the flavor of the potatoes as well as that gorgeous Gruyere cheese.  Not only were these a decadent  taste sensation, they were remarkably easy to assemble as well – no sauce to prepare, just layer cream and cheese!  After sampling these it will be interesting to see if I ever go back to traditional au gratin potatoes prepared with cheddar again.

It was very good.  If you happen to have a Trader Joe's around town, get their cheddar/gruyere cheese blend and use that.  It was perfect and not as expensive as a pure gruyere cheese.  I also added some chives and seasoned the layers with a  salt blend.  Lastly I broiled the top for a bit to make it more crispy and pretty to serve.

Recipe Group selection 3/17/12.  My only deviation from the recipe was using Jarlesburg in place of Greuyere, which was $21.99/lb.  This was so good with the lesser cheese, I can just imagine it as written.  Celeste, this is another winning recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.

Made this for Recipe Group...This is potato perfection!!! I could not believe how easy this was to prepare and the end result was fantastic...everyone RAVED! I had planned a different potato recipe and at the last minute decided on these, so I had already had whole, boiled potatoes, so I just peeled them, sliced them thin and proceeded w/ the recipe. I seasoned them w/ some garlic powder and salt (as well as the pepper and nutmeg) to compensate for what I did not do during the boiling, which worked out fine. Also, and I know this is major, so PLEASE forgive me, but I actually only had a very small amount of Gruyere on hand that my mom gave me, so I did end up using some creamy Irish white cheddar (Ballyshannon) as well, and it went perfectly. These were so creamy and flavorful...a real hit at dinner. I will def be making these again and again (probably subbing cheeses as needed, lol). Thanks, Celeste, for this wonderful recipe. :)

Made this for Easter dinner, which meant there wouldn't be a lot of time to prepare it after the morning church service.  I made the entire dish up to the point where it was ready to bake the night before, then covered and refrigerated it overnight. I was worried the potatoes would be mushy, so I sliced them a bit thicker than the recipe called for, but they were just fine. They baked while I roasted the asparagus and tossed the salad, and were perfect. I loved the Gruyere in this, and would definitely make it again. This reminded me of the individual baked portions of au gratin potatoes I've had at a local steakhouse - one of my favorite splurges there. Thanks for sharing Celeste!

The taste of these potatoes is wonderful. The one thing I would do differently next time is to simmer in water for about 4 to 5 minutes. I did 8 and it was too long. Excellent flavor I will make again for sure.

Celeste...these potatoes are so yummy! Quick to put together and so creamy, my family loved this dish. I nearly broke the bank on the Gruyere but it was so worth it!

Recipe Group Selection:  17, March '12  Oh my goodness is this a great potato recipe!  I halved the recipe, but wish now I would have made the full recipe.  I've never had, nor purchased Gruyere cheese (quite expensive at $15.98 lb.) but it was so worth it!  Lucky for us, I still have enough cheese left to shred and make another half batch.  Thanks Celeste for sharing - this was a great pick this week.

These weren't awful.  I just felt they were a little bland and not worth the cost of the cheese you put in.

I made these potatoes for a large group and everyone loved them so much there were none left over even though I made a double batch. The only thing I changed was I cooked up some bacon and then grilled sweet onions in a small amount of the bacon grease then added both the bacon and onion (sparingly ) in-between the layers of potatoes. They turned out great and now everyone wants the recipe. Give them a try, you won't regret it!

These were wonderful!  I was looking for indulgent potates for Easter and these fit the bill perfectly. I did sub in cheddar for some of the Gruyere, because the Gruyere was so pricey, but I don't think the sub made a lot of difference.  Perfect potatoes for festive meals!!!

Great recipe.    It is expensive to make & loaded with calories & fat.   However, it is a wonderful recipe for holidays & special occasions.  I did a trial run last night to taste the outcome (made it exactly as written) & it was terrific !!    Will be making again for Easter dinner & will probably not make again for many months.  Wonderful recipe, the best au gratin potatoes I have ever tasted !! Yummy !!

I doubled the amount of cream and cheese and did three layers instead of only two. I also put the dish together the night before to the point where you put it in the oven to bake, covered it with foil, let it cool and refrigerated it. I let it warm to room temperature while my ham was baking, took my ham out when it was hot, and baked the potatoes while I was glazing the ham. Potatoes came out when the ham went back in to bake the glaze and everything was perfect and ready all at the same time!

Made for Recipe Group. I love potatoes done this way. I sliced in the food processor, then grated some Amish Swiss, the Gruyere they had at the store was just a tiny little wedge. I developed Oooh Shiny disease while trying to boil the potatoes and overcooked them, so ended up with mashed potato gratin. I only put nutmeg in half the dish, then forgot which end. But whichever end I tasted sure tasted fine!! All creamy and cheesy and peppery, can't get any better than that! Thanks Celeste!

Update:  Costco regularly carries non-cave-aged Gruyere for about $11.00/pound. About half the cost of grocery stores.  Since this baked into a recipe, you can't tell the difference from it's pricier cousin.

Thank you for this recipe!  We've made au gratin potatoes a number of ways, but this is by far (and away) the best effort to-date.  Paired this with a juicy ham for Easter guests and it was the biggest hit on the table.  Elegant, easy.  the Gruyere cheese is what makes these memorable.  

I made a mistake and added about a 1/2 cup too much cream (used 1/2 and 1/2), but the ham took longer than expected, so by the time dinner was on, the spuds were perfect.

BLAND!!! I made these for Easter dinner, spulrged for the Gureye cheese, used Yukon Gold, garlic, the whole nine yards. A few folks liked them, but was not a hit by any means. Disappointed! Don't know until you try! I will not make this one again. Sorry Celeste!

Everything about this recipe was perfect, except that the final result was much too rich for my taste. Next time I try this, I'll use whole milk and see how it turns out. I was surprised that the potatoes didn't turn to mush - I cut them maybe 1/8-1/4" thick and boiled them for about 3-4 minutes. They were nearly done when I moved them to the casserole, so I thought they were going to dissolve into mashed potatoes during the baking, but they turned out with the perfect "bite" to them. The Gruyère melted and browned nicely, too. 54 minutes in the oven was just right.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  It lacked flavor and it looked like the cheese seperated or something.  I dunno.  There just wasn't a creamy texture like I was expecting.  I do believe I'll be searching for a different recipe for Potatoes Au Gratin.

Made this for Easter and it wasn't much of a hit at all. I expected a much creamier texture. Don't think I will make this again especially with the expense of the Gruyere cheese.

Seconds were taken by all on this. Creamy and tasty. Sort of expensive but the taste is worth it. Would compliment any meat dish very well. And could easily be doubled for a larger crowd. Nice pick Recipe Group.

Made this for Easter Saturday family dinner.  Was apprehensive as I had not even eaten this cheese before.  We were having nineteen people for dinner.  The only thing I changed was to double the recipe and use a larger pan.  Cooked the potatoes on top of the range for 8 minutes.  They were so delicious.  Only had one serving left to bring home.  True, the cheese is pricey, but the recipe is easy, quick and so good.

I made this exactly according to the directions but it was pretty disappointing. It came out very bland and the only thing that was redeeming was that the Gruyere tastes so good. I used really expensive Gruyere but ended up having to throw this out. I couldn't get anyone in my house to eat it! Maybe I'll try again and modify it. I gave it an extra star because I LOVE the idea of using Gruyere instead of cheddar.

have yet to get any creamy baked potato dish right, which isn't the fault of the recipe. I subbed a mix of mozza & swiss cheeses, and had to use mostly milk so that may be where the sauce part didn't turn out so well. Does need more seasoning though.

Awesome recipe! Made with Easter dinner today and was a big hit. Complemented ham and pineapple casserole nicely. Made a few adjustments since it was a last minute put together...didn't have cream so used can of evaporated milk, red skin potatoes instead of yukon, cheddar cheese instead of gruyere and was hesitant about nutmeg so used parsley. Also added onions to the pot of potatoes with extra garlic. Once all put together I drizzled melted butter over the dish before baking... YUMMY!!!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but after making it twice I can only say I liked it.  If I am going to justify the cost of the Gruyere, I have to LOVE it.  It was easy to prepare: I only boiled the potatoes for about 5 minutes, and the layering process was a breeze.  But, the final product is merely a mediocre, bland dish.  And in our house, a $20 side dish needs to be FANTASTIC!

we all loved it. Very expensive cheese but hey, it's Christmas! We wished it had more sauce but I may have not compensated enough for additional potatoes. Also, next time, will add a light sprinkle of salt or other favorite salty seasoning to each layer when assembling. I would say we're about light to average in the salt-to-taste department but it was just a little bland - maybe the cheese brand was less salty.

Should be called dreamy potatoes :). My husband thought this was better and different from the traditional gratin/scalloped potatoes.  I love gruyere cheese so much, I'm going to add a bit more of it next time.

Delicious if you follow the recipe. But... it's also fabulous if you make it with other cheeses like Colby-jack or cheddar or even a mix of cheeses. Go with what you like and you can't go wrong. I make this with 2% milk and it is awesome. So make as is or tweak for a different cheese flavor or to lighten it up calorie-wise. Any which way, you can't go wrong.

Sort of on the bland side...glad I fried up and crumbled some bacon and added it to the cheese sauce. Also, I hope the 1 quart casserole is a typo. I knew that 4 potatoes, 1 onion, and approximately three cups of sauce wouldn't fit into a 1 quart. Ended up using a 3 quart pyrex bowl so nothing would overflow in the oven. Will probably make it again, but will play with spicing it up.

We loved this recipe. I halved the recipe since it was just for the two of us I used half gruyere cheese and half sharp cheddar(already shredded) since other people who tried said that worked well also. I'm sure all gruyere would have been delicious but it is very pricey and we are used to using cheddar.I ended up using more cheese then the recipe called for since it didn't seem enough when I was putting it together.I added more until it looked right(next time maybe even more).It was very delicious but not as creamy as I hoped but my boyfriend only had compliments, even when we reheated some for leftovers. We still have more left, it is very rich and filling. I didn't have fresh nutmeg and if I can find it another time I make this(and this is definitely a keeper and I will make it again)I will try it. I put ground nutmeg inside not on top since usually my boyfriend doesn't like the idea of it in savory dishes(he didn't know) I put a little red pepper in it also and a bit more cream. I did what some others suggested and turned the potatoes off as soon as it boiled. Maybe a minute or two later since it boiled before I noticed, lol. I thought letting them sit in the water while putting the dish together would cook them more so I took them all out with a slotted spoon. A fork could pierce them but they were still firm. I was concerned about them getting mushy in the casserole being . They were perfectly cooked.I put in a little more then 11/2 lbs. of y.g.pot.I used an 8X8 dish

These potatoes are probably the best au gratin I've ever made!  The smokiness of the Gruyere really adds a unique dimension to the flavor.  

I chose to leave the peel on the Yukon Golds and I used a food processor to both slice the potatoes and shred the cheese.   I suggest doing this to make the prep time significantly shortened.

Also, I reheated the leftovers for breakfast and served runny eggs over them.  It was an amazing combo and made breakfast feel gourmet and my husband feel spoiled.

This recipe was not worth the expense or effort.  My husband and I made this on Christmas Day and were disappointed.  It lacked taste.  For the expense of good Gruyere cheese, we thought it would be a lot better.  We followed the original recipe and did not modify it.

I'm wondering, based on the fact that this has such a high rating otherwise, if the Gruyere that I purchased at the deli was just too tasteless. There was almost no cheese taste at all. These were good. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Delicious! Made this for a crowd for Easter. Followed directions exactly but had no time to peel the potatoes so I left the skins on. Took about 45 min in the oven to cook nicely. By the time we ate,  the dish was pretty much cooled but there was STILL nothing left of it by the end of dinner! Fantastic! Everyone loved it.

These were good....but they really didn't knock my socks off or anything. I think given the cost of the cheese being about $21.99/lb I will try a different (and cheaper) one for next time.

These were fabulous!! I followed instructions & ingredients this first time around, except I left the skins on the potatoes. They turned out perfect. I'll be making these again but may play around with the cheese a bit so it's easier on my budget. I can see many possibilities. YUM!

Celeste, thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  This is so much easier than making a rue with flour and butter, etc, waiting for it to thicken!   I always look at  new recipes'  as a "starter kit" and then I made it my own.  I found the gruyer and swiss cheese mix at Aldi  all in the same bag! (it was $4 for an 8 oz bag) The first time I made it I added some hot pepper blend cheese as a lot of people were saying it was a little bland.  The second time I made it I also added some pepper flakes and Ranch seasoning, some Mexican blend cheese and topped with sharp cheddar.  Also sliced an onion and mixed it in.  I also added a little extra half and half as I like it creamy.  Sorry, no measurements, just what I thought would be good.  Also, I didn't layer it, just threw it all in the pan and kinda of mixed together.  OMG!    I will be making this over and over.
....I was asked to make this again for a large group.  I made it the last time for a large group also.

I used the reviewer suggestion for Swiss cheese mixed with whit wine. I used one 7 oz. Cracker Barrel Baby Swiss cheese. I also put it together the night before for timing reasons. I resisted the urge to add more cheese as it didn't look like enough, but it was beautiful and delicious!  I took it out of the refrigerator about 2 hours before baking it; which was still about an hour and 15 minutes. My husband said he really liked them as did our guest. I will definitely make these again.

I did use half & half instead of heavy cream because I just couldn't find it.  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe called for.  The end result was not creamy, but almost dry.

You can use regular sharp cheddar cheese. pretty much any cheese you like works. My mother uses velveeta and they tasted amazing. I used a mixture of cheeses once and it worked out wonderful!

I made these potatoes for Easter with ham.  Very good but a little bland. I added some of the ham drippings to the potatoes when they were just about done and I also added some onion to the potatoes when assembling. They turned out very tasty.

I made a lower fat version using 1/2 greek yogurt and 1/2 heavy cream with a touch of garlic salt and onion powder.  I also LOVE rosemary, and was serving this with roasted hens, so I added fresh rosemary to the recipe which greatly complimented the Gruyere.  (not too much though- it's easy to overpower things with rosemary!)  Overall a quick, easy, yummy recipe that my whole family enjoyed (the kids asked for seconds!).  And I agree with other reviewers - the fresh nutmeg makes a GREAT addition.

I made a few changes...simmered the potatoes after I sliced them.  Used 2 cups of cheddar, added a tsp of cayenne.

This recipe gives no guidance on how much nutmeg to use.  I wound up ruining the potatoes by using too much.  We ate them anyway because at $26 per pound for gruyere I didn't want to throw them away.  You can't really call this a recipe when there's no amount given for one of the primary ingredients flavor-wise.  There's no way to taste them until they're done, either.  The garlic really doesn't add much flavor and they would have been bland if I hadn't overdone it on the nutmeg.  I feel like they need some garlic and onion in the dish.

All fairness...used Swiss cheese. Was not going to spend money for that cheese. Personally I didn't care for garlic in my potatoes. I will stick to my scalloped with onion, flour, milk, butter. I can add cheese.

I did not make any changes to this recipe.  My husband and I found them to be very bland.  I even forked out the money for the Gruyere cheese and was deeply disappointed.  Sorry, off my list it goes.  Sticking with my tried and true from now on!

A bit bland and I even added some onions. Plus, Gruyere is very spendy. Won't make this again.

I made this last night because I had all the ingredients on hand and I wanted a 'different' potato side dish. For me, the gruyere cheese just didn't work. It was funny because to me it was (way) too mild but to my son, it was too pungent. I did like the preparation, though, and may try it again with something other than heavy cream and a different cheese.

We tested the recipe with half the ingredients.
Pleased with the taste, although the amount of salt in the recipe turned out to be well below what we now believe it needs. Without adding more salt, it did taste bland.
Once we added salt the flavors did come out, and we really liked the taste.
I estimate that for next time, we will be using at least 3 times the salt indicated in the recipe.
I may also make the potato slices a bit thicker, as I would like the slices to be better preserved (I made them too thin with my mandolin, with the thinnest setting)

This was delicious and easy to make.  I made a few changes.  I used about 1/4 cp more cream and a little more salt. Def will make again. I might even try using a little pepper jack. BTW I found the cheese at Walmart for 3.98 for 8oz. It was applewood bacon smoked and it really worked great in the recipe.

Used different cheese and added  more heavy cream.  Infused the heavy cream with onion and whole garlic and warm the cream and removed the onion /garlic before applying to dish.

While I didn't have the Gruyere cheese, I tried Gouda and a little Swiss. I loved it, and will try it again with the correct cheese, but would make it this way again. Smells amazing!!!

I have to admit that I made these from a box....up until now.  My family loved this so much they ate the leftovers for breakfast.   Like some other reviewers, I didn't have Gruyere on hand, so I used other cheeses, but it was still fantastic.  I can only imagine how good it is with the real stuff.  This goes in the keeper file, thanks so much!

This is the best potato au gratin I've ever made.  I parboiled potatoes whole, cooled, then sliced.  Added finely diced onion and minced garlic with the layers.  Used an applewood smoked gouda.  Everyone at dinner today said they were the best potatoes also!!

Loved how fast and easy this dish was.  I did cut the cream and used half and half and came out great.  I also ran out of Greuyere so added a little chedder cheese and it was great!  I brought to a potluck two days later and everyone LOVED it!

I am eating this Recipe right now and I am very pleased with how it turned out.  I used Unpeeled Little Red Potatoes and Peeled Yukon Potatoes, and Sliced them Thin.  I recommend that you just bring them to a Boil, with your Diced Fresh Garlic and the 3/4 Teaspoon of Salt.  Then immediately remove them and place them in a single layer in a 9 x 13-inch Baking Pan.  Then add some Chopped Diced Zucchini, Onions, Red and Orange Peppers, Turkey Kielbasa, and Canned Mushrooms.  Sprinkle on some Grated Cheese, I used Fresh Middletown Tomme from West River Creamy in Vermont, and 1 Cup of Heavy Cream (with 1/2 cup of Water, since our Heavy Cream is very Fresh and Thick).  Now you have a Complete and Delicious Meal.  Going back for Seconds!

I have never rated a recipe before, but this recipe was such a hit for  my family that I had to rate this recipe. I have been trying to make scalloped potatoes for my family for years.  The other recipes were either too bland, too caloric, or just didn't work.  This recipe is perfect.  Tasty, easy, and satisfying.  Rave reviews from my teenager and husband.  Thank you!

I cannot tell you how often I have made these.  So good!!!  It only takes about 1/4 pound of the Gruyere cheese and I buy it in chunk and grate it myself.  I made it once putting the garlic raw in the layered potatoes.  We didn't like it that way as much as it took away from the cheese.  Awesome recipe!!!

Served it with Easter Ham and it was gone before the ham. Easy to make, doubled recipe and added more cheese.

What a great change on scalloped potatoes. I used smoky Gruyere cheese. The added garlic in the pare boil stage was a great touch.

Made these using my kitchenaid stand mixer slicer attachment. The potatoes come out thin so they crumbled after boiling. I will probably try just blanching them next time or maybe just putting them in uncooked. I also substituted the cheese for the smoked version. They came out incredibly creamy and yummy. Will definitely making these again.

Yum! I can't handle all the dairy in heavy cream so I substituted soy milk. It turned out great. I'm sure the original recipe would be even more decadent though!

These were delicious, however, I used a mandoline, which sliced the potatoes extra thin, then I proceeded to boil for 8 minutes.  I shouldn't have even par boiled, as I ended up with mashed potatoes au gratin.  Ooops!

I made the recipe as written and it turned out amazing! This is my go-to for au gratin potatoes. The gruyere is a little stinky when you shred it, but it tastes awesome once baked in this dish!

I usually mince up  a little celery and carrot and add to alot of dishes such as these fantastic potatoes.  It doesnt really change the taste but adds fiber etc. Probably  doesn't help that much but I have a very picky eater.

This was really good and relatively easy to make. I should have tasted it while in transit to the oven so I would have known to season it a little more. Other than that, it was a big hit with the family.

Really liked he rustic look of these potatoes, but they need SALT.  I layered salt, pepper and nutmeg between and on top, and I still thought they needed salt when served (and I'm not a big salt fan).  At 6,000 feet above sea level, it takes longer to boil water so I waited until my water was boiling, added the potatoes for 5 minutes - they were perfectly done.  Hint:  get all the potatoes sliced, then add them at the same time to the water for consistent cooking.

Very good, used a mandolin to slice the potatoes very thin, perhaps too thin, the result was almost like mashed, so next time I will simply use a knife.  Also, doubled the cheese since my family loves cheese and the more the better.

These are absolutely fabulous! I use a great deal of Gruyere in my cooking and this one is extra special! I don’t understand how any of the reviewers found this bland. That baffles me. Your cheese was cheap or you didn’t use enough salt. 

I mixed Jamison chicken soup base into the heavy cream and mixed it together prior to pouring on the potatoes.  I did this instead of adding plain salt.  The nutmeg adds a real spark. 

Thanks again Celeste! I am truly in love. This one is going into my permanent rotation!

I don't have a kitchen scale, so estimated "3 lb potatoes" as 7-8 small-medium Russet potatoes (didn't have Yukon gold). The result was not enough fluid to create a creamy sauce--what we got was lightly flavored, rather plain scalloped potatoes. This is after I added extra cheese, bacon, and thin-sliced onion to the mix. It should have been amazing, but...I give it three stars for basically just feeding us.

I liked this recipe, but it lacked a punch. I substituted paprika for the nutmeg.  It really  needed salt also. It looked great and with a little extra seasoning was really good.

Fabulous recipe. Made it several times and it's always delicious.
Pretty much stayed within the recipe. Used just slightly more garlic.

This is a great recipe for a beloved dish. I made for Easter with ham and steamed green beans. So easy and a delicious leftover. I buttered the baking dish first to ensure no sticking and I used the Swiss/ Gruyere blend from Trader Joe’s (exactly 2 cups in package). Otherwise I followed the instructions to the tee. I will for sure include this recipe in my repotoire!

I read lots of reviews that said these were bland but I wanted to try them anyway.  Those reviewers are right.  It's definitely missing something - it needs much more seasoning.  I'm always mindful of the amount if salt in dishes but this one definitely needed more salt and pepper at the very least.  They are easy to make and didn't taste bad, just not flavorful like other similar recipes I've made.  I probably won't make them again.

I had *high* expectations for this recipe. What could go wrong with these great ingredients? Heavy cream and Gruyere cheese! How bad could it be, right? Well, there is only a handful of us that have to say, "The Emperor has no clothes," and unfortunately, I am one of them. I prepared the recipe exactly as written (other than using dry nutmeg, not grated), but as several others have noted, the result was BLAND. Mind you, it certainly was edible and not horrible, but I expected so much more. What happened? First, note that the recipe as written calls for a very small amount of salt; it needs more. With two levels, add additional salt on each level. With as many potatoes as that called for in the recipe, 3/4 teaspoon is not enough salt, at least for us it wasn't. Some of the salt would stay in the boiled water, leaving the potatoes with even less than 3/4 teaspoon. Obviously I did not use enough ground pepper either, since the flavor was flat. I also leave open the possibility that I didn't use a premium brand of cheese. Often when I read a differing review on a recipe which most liked, I wonder  the reviewer is just being contrarian. That's not me. Look, I wanted to love this one, but I cannot tell a lie. If I ever try this recipe again, it's going to need a serious overhaul.

After having some of these leftover potatoes, I'm modifying my rating to three stars from two. They were much better the second time around, particularly after I added some salt and pepper.

My family who are straight up cheese fanatics...do not like this kind of cheese. I didn't love it either....maybe if you replaced this cheese with Swiss or something. I did leave the potatoes a little undone like one had said and then cooked in the oven and that worked perfectly....so not pure mush. Other then the flavor of this cheese it was nice and creamy and had a perfect consistency. I wonder if you could use Gouda. :-)

Wow were these good!  I did take the suggestion of using Swiss cheese sprinkled with white wine, what a cost saver and the end product was delicious.  I didn't have fresh nutmeg, but the ancient bottle in my spice rack seemed to have worked just fine and provided an unexpected delightful flavor.  Will absolutely make again!

This dish was bland and not creamy.  The gruyere cheese was not strong enough in flavor and the heavy cream separated to the bottom of the dish.  The sauce needed to be thickened into a roux.  The nutmeg did not make a difference.  An expensive fail for christmas dinner.

We used this as a side dish for our Christmas dinner. Very impressive dish, it was well received by our guests. The only changes we made were to boil the potatoes for only 4-5 minutes so they didn’t become mushy and we added some raclette cheese to every other layer.

I sort of combined a couple of recipes. I added sliced onion and sharp cheddar instead of gruyere since I had it on hand. I liked the texture of the potatoes when made this way.

I made these as written the first time and it was a dish of delish! Parboiling the potatoes first and draining them completely makes all the difference. The result is a creamy potato. The second time I made them I subbed half of the Gruyere with extra sharp cheddar and it worked out beautifully. I also sauted a finely chopped medium onion and 6 cloves of minced garlic in a tablespoon of butter instead of adding the minced garlic to the boiling potatoes.  I added these between the layers before baking.  This was gilding the lily a bit because this is already a dish of delish but the result was a dish with even deeper flavor. Thank you for posting it!

I used red potatoes and a mixture of other white cheeses I had on hand (provolone/mozzarella).
Very good. I’ll add some cheddar next time.

Very good, my family enjoyed it.  Be careful coking "very thinly sliced potatoes" for 8 to 10 minutes, you could easily end up with mush.  My wife tried to convince me to skip that step. Instead of skipping the precooking of the potatoes,  I cooked them for about half the time - so 3 to 4 minutes instead of 8 to 10.  That worked great.

Every time that I make the potatoes el Groton they are the centerpiece. I change up a few pieces here and there but over all still the same basic recipe.

In the US culture of too much salt and sugar, these potatoes are VERY bland!  I needed to add additional items to make it flavorful which honestly, is the idea of any recipe you make, it's individual.

Absolutely love the recipe!! We don’t have Yukon potatoes here in Singapore, so we used Holland potatoes — which turned out nice, not powdery and the sweetness of the potato does come out in the dish. Also, I did sprinkle a bit of salt together with the pepper and nutmeg—needed a wee bit more seasoning

I added some cubes ham to the layers. Was delicious. Used Swiss instead. A lot of liquid though. Next time I will cut cream in half and thoroughly drain potatoes before putting in pan. Will definitely make again

Wow! These are so delicious and simple to make. My dh has always said he hates scalloped potatoes, so I have never made them before. We had some leftover ham and my friend suggested I make scalloped potatoes. I am so glad I found this recipe to try. My husband was dreading dinner but was pleasantly surprised when he saw the dish. It was nothing like he expected and he LOVED this dish! He went back for seconds and asked me to pack the leftovers for his lunch! A huge win at my house. Thank you!

I did not use the garlic cloves in the water so I sprinkled some garlic salt along with the pepper and nutmeg.  Some reviews said this recipe was bland so I sprinkled a little extra salt on it as well.  I used gruyere like the recipe called for.  Costco sells a 16 oz block for $10.50.  I only had to shred half (8 oz) to get the amount the recipe calls for. I don't think the recipe fully shows off the flavor of the gruyere (overpowered by the heavy cream perhaps) so I can see why others have opted to use less expensive cheeses.  Overall, a very tasty dish and it went fast at the dinner I brought it to and received many compliments.

The gruyere cheese would have been $30 so I just used Swiss cheese. It was a hit with the adults, especially the crispy cheese on top.

I changed up the cheese . I had too cook it longer than called for because it was too soupy, but that was not unexpected because I started it at a lower temp as I was glazing a ham. The nutmeg was a nice touch !!

I made these for a family gathering so I had to double it. OUCH$$$$$. The results however were worth it. I didn't have even a teaspoon left over.  Special occasion dish for sure though between the $$ and the calories. Thanks for the great recipe.

Not feeling the love. I followed the recipe and felt they turned out dry. I've made potatoes au gratin many times and decided to try this new recipe and I'll be going back to my standard recipe next time.  I definitely think I prefer a cheese roux for the sauce where I get a more even blend and distribution of sauce. I did enjoy the flavor and liked the subtle garlic flavor from boiling the potato slices in garlic and salt for a few minutes so I may ad that step to my recipe.

I also thought they were to bland. The expensive cheese was good and it was very cheesy but even adding diced ham to the leftovers the next day it still needed more oomph.

I have a family member who doesn't do well with a lot of garlic, so I bruised the garlic just enough to get the skin off and placed the whole  pieces into the pot with the potatoes to get the flavor. I was able to fish them out when placing the potatoes in my baking pan.  I used applewood smoked gouda for my cheese.  It turned out really well and was enjoyed by all.

I have made  scalloped potatoes before but this recipe is definitely the best.  I used Trader Joe’s version of Gruyere cheese and not only was it cheaper,  it was so creamy and delicious.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't boil the potatoes because I thought they would moosh, so I skipped that step and followed the rest of the recipe as written. The potatoes were still a bit hard when they should have been done so I threw the pan in the microwave for 10 minutes and they were perfect! Creamy, cheesy… yum!

These potatoes are easy and delicious! I followed the recipe and only substituted shredded Velveeta cheese instead of the Guyere. Less expensive and very creamy. This is my go to potato side dish!

We loved this!  The only change I made was to add a layer of fried onions on the bottom of the dish.  I was afraid the potatoes would stick, and I wanted onions anyway.  It worked and OK I should add that I used Swiss cheese instead of gruyere and added white wine to it to make it taste like gruyere, and it does!

Was going to take a picture but the family ate it all! This was wonderfully decadent! Followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT used russet potatoes with the skins on. Turned out great. Even my picky 2 yr old grandson (who is going thru that non eating stage!) ate his and asked for more. That's a wonderful testament right there.

This was a little bland and a little dry. We had to add salt and pepper at the table, so next time I'll add a bit of seasoning during prep. Ours really did not turn out very creamy at all, perhaps because I only made a half recipe. Next time I will add more cream and cheese to create that creamy sauce. We enjoyed the Gruyere, especially the browned, crispy cheese on the top. We had never had this cheese before and found it to be very good. Though we found the recipe just OK as is, with a few tweeks, it would work.

This was fantastic!  I did add a pressed clove of garlic, some cayenne pepper  and 1/2 cup of monteray jack cheese to the sauce mixture.  For the cheese called for in the recipe I used cabot double double which is a mix of sharp and regular cheddar cheeses.  Will definitely make again!  Thank you to the person who posted this recipe

Yes, very satisfying and delicious. An easy recipe that comes out great.
 Made a couple small changes which worked well.
1. Boiled potatoes and garlic just 3 minutes to avoid mushiness.
2. Substituted (more affordable ) Gouda for the Gruyere cheese.
3. Added thinly sliced onions between the layers.

Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was excellent!

These were very quick and easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Served next to an Easter ham they were perfect. I was very careful not to overcook the potatoes  during the initial simmer and may have used a little more gruyere than the recipe requested. Fresh nutmeg is a must!

I used Swiss cheese and added a few onions. Also, just parboiled the potatoes 3-4 minutes.  It worked out well and I would make again for sure.

This was great. Extremely tasty, which one would expect from a food made mostly of cheese and heavy cream. I exactly followed the recipe and we really enjoyed it. I found it needed to cook a little less than the recommended time.

I made this recipe for an Easter side dish. I couldn't afford the cheese recommended in the recipe. So I used what I had on hand. Sharp cheddar and parmasam.  Everything else was the same. It was so good that I have requests to make it again. I will for sure.  Easy and delicious.

I was intrigued by the idea of nutmeg and Gruyere cheese in Au Gratin Potatoes. However the lack of onion for flavor and a shortage of moisture left this somewhat dry. Creating an actual cheese sauce may have improved this recipe.

Loved this!  Used gruyere and sharp cheddar combo for the cheese - nutmeg is key in this recipe but not too much - I only used it in the middle layer.. added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit --it did cook for a whole hour so allow time for that!
Note:  Any combo of cheeses you like would work in this recipe

I was disappointed in mine, everyone's reviews sounded so good I was looking forward to trying this recipe.  However, I will try making this again because I did make mine for a large group of 30 people so I actually did mine in a crockpot and had to adjust the ingredients accordingly so for now I'll rate it a three until I try it again.  UPDATE: I made this again as written and we still don't like it. I actually ended up using what was left and made it into a potato soup. I added homemade chicken stock, leftover ham, salt & pepper and thickened it with flour and milk which was really good. At least I didn't waste it. To get to the point this is expensive for what you get, not impressed.

This was pretty easy, even the slicing because I have a mandolin.  I decided to boil it a bit longer so I wouldn't have to wait for it to cook the whole hour.  My family really enjoyed it.  I used mozzerella and cheddar cheese (what I had) and it turned our great, even combined with the nutmeg!  However, with lack of cream, next time, I may used s ome cream cheese mixed with my 1% milk so it won't be so runny.

I must admit...I was excited about this recipe because of the cheese and the heavy cream...figured it had to be rich and awesome, right?  For all the world, I was shocked to find that they were quite bland.  I was even worried that I had used too much black  pepper, but no...very bland.  I would like to try again, but either barely blanche the potatoes or just cook them entirely in the casserole.  Boiled potatoes have a distinct flavor, and it isn't a good one.  Better luck next time.

I made a couple of minor changes.  I used Swiss cheese which is quite similar to Gruyère, but much less expensive.  I also chose not to peel the  potatoes.  The narrow slivers of peel added a bit of texture.  These were a big success with my family, and were so easy to prepare.  I'll definitely be making these again for family gatherings and potlucks!

This recipe is AMAZING ... soooooo rich & creamy!  The combination of Yukon Gold potatoes & Gruyere Cheese is very satisfying.   

I made the following changes:  
 1.)  I increased the garlic to 6 cloves, three in the pot of water 
        and 3 more minced, added to the layers of potatoes
2.)  I also ADDED 1/3 cup of Panko for to the topping.  
I think is is KEY to be generous with the freshly ground pepper and freshly ground nutmeg.  

RAVE reviews for Christmas dinner!
I will definitely make again.

Thank YOU!

OMG!! These potatoes we to die for! Honestly how can anyone say this is bland?  Absolutely the best au gratin potatoes I have ever eaten.  Made recipe as written ( if at all possible, use the Gruyere--its worth it) and turned out beautifully for Christmas dinner 2016.  A big hit. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  Will make again for special occasions.

These potatoes are AMAZING. I made the recipe as in with no changes. These were perfect.....the right amount of seasoning, nice and creamy and great texture. They remind me of the potatoes from Morton's steak house. The cheese and nutmeg really bump up the quality of the dish. Yes, and simple to make.

Your recipe is good but I will just give my take as I've made.. I sauté thin sliced leeks with garlic in olive oil but not too long which adds great flavor and also add some good parmesan cheese to the mix....Flying Chef Worldwide......

These potatoes were delicious! I cooked them for my husband's birthday dinner, and he and I agreed that I should make them for every meal. Unfortunately, they are so rich that they'll have to stay a special-occasion dish for us. The only change I made was to use Swiss cheese rather than Gruyere because my husband prefers it. I have to note, also, that my oven failed in the middle of cooking, and with a few adjustments and the use of a second oven, these turned out perfectly.

10.2.16  I used fat free half-and-half (what I had on hand) and substituted swiss cheese (again, what I had on hand), and these still turned out great.  Love having the option of another version of au gratin potatoes, and not using traditional cheddar made this recipe mellower.  Can’t say that I like one over the other, but I can say that these potatoes were REALLY good! ***UPDATE*** 8.20.18  I made this today with Asiago cheese instead of Gruyere, and it turned out well.  I used the fine shredding disc on my food processor, and the cheese didn’t melt as nicely, but that only is an eye appeal thing.  This one’s occasionally worth the indulgence.

I just made this and followed the recipe exactly and it is sooo delicious. My 2 yr old loves it too. (Husband is not too fond of cheesy dishes). I don't think the gruyere was too rich, but I do love cheese! I'm saving this one for the holidays!

This is my go-to recipe for au gratin potatoes.  I keep the ingredients as listed, but add more as I prefer.  I like garlic, so I added more of that.  I like my potatoes quite soft, so I used WAY more than one cup of heavy cream.  I baked these low and slow allowing the cream to absorb into the potatoes and adding more cream while baking as the potatoes dried but were still firm.  It will seem as if they're way too soupy, but keep baking for over an hour.  I think most times, I bake for almost two hours at 325.  The result is a rich and incredibly decadent potatoes gratin.

VERY GOOD EASY. Made as directed and turned out well.
Gruyere and nutmeg made for a nice different flavour.
So easy to oven bake in my oblong slow cooker then take in slow cooker to reheat at hosts house. Will definitely be making this many more times.

Used 8oz of Gruyere cheese and rest Swiss. Did add some white wine to Swiss and tossed together, as someone had suggested.  Made it night before and kept in refrigerator, which worked fine.  Allowed to set out for hr or so before baking.  But, was disappointed in flavor I n that it was not really tasty.  My husband agreed and no one in the group commented on the dish, which they usually do if it's exceptional. It did brown nicely and was creamy, just not full of flavor. Perhaps using all Gruyere would have made a difference.

So easy to make and incredibly good.  Best potatoes Au gratin I have ever had.  The only negative is the cost of the cheese versus a standard cheddar cheese, but for holiday meals it is worth it!

I have made this a few times and it's fabulous! I follow the recipe exactly...except I use Swiss cheese vs the Gruyere ...I cannot afford to use the Gruyere, it's cost prohibitive for my budget. BUT the Swiss is a great substitute. Soooo, use this recipe! It does not disappoint!

These were awesome and got rave reviews at the holidays!  Following the reviews, I substituted the Trader Joe's Gruyere and Swiss cheese blend and was very happy!  

It was also more forgiving then I thought!  I had to up the recipe at the last minute and ended up not having enough cheese.  Scrounged through my refrigerator and used a blend of what I could find, including cheddar and "Mexican Fiesta" blend.  

I must say that at the end of the day, it was awesome and no one could tell the difference!  Would DEFINITELY make it again... though this time I will make sure to have enough cheese on hand!  :)

I received a mandoline as a gift, and my first order of business was to try an au gratin potato recipe. Extremely pleased that I chose this one! I followed the recipe quite closely, and as I write this my husband and son are battling over the last few bites.  Everyone raved over this dish.

Wow. I used Boar's head smoked Gruyere cheese, tripled the recipe, and followed the recipe to a T. It turned out so great I cannot wait to make it again.

I made this for Christmas dinner with high hopes. We were all disappointed. We did not like the gruyere at all. Waste on money.

Delicious. Much better than the old recipe I used to use. Gruyere and nutmeg made the difference.

I made 12 servings of this.  I boiled the potatoes for 4 minutes.  Instead of Gruyere cheese, I used what I had... Colby Jack.  Since my husband was taking this to a potluck he wanted it loaded with fat (yuck!), so I added small pats of butter between the layers (3 tbsp total).  I used half-n-half instead of cream also.  I also cooked this in a crockpot for about 4 hours then finished it off under the broiler for 5 minutes to crisp up the cheesy topping.

Delicious! Great base recipe that can be tweaked in many ways. I added some onion powder and thyme to the water used to boil the potatoes which gave it a little more flavor. I also used a combination of shredded Swiss and havartti cheese, instead of the Gruyere.

I needed two 1/2 trays for a party, here are my modifications:
I used sliced Havarti, 1lb of deli sliced cheese 
5lb of gold potatoes
1 pint of heavy cream
-sprinkled a little more salt when I did the pepper & nutmeg since it was a little blah  
Otherwise, I followed the recipe all the way.  
Going to make this again, it was a big hit!

the gruyere in the middle is completely lost. I would use something like mozza, chedder or maybe swiss instead. there was no sauce after they cooked. I would include more liquid next time. the potatoes shouldn't be cut very thin as stated in the recipe, and even cut thick the potatoes should only be boiled for a minute, maybe two. I added shallots to mine but there cou I might try again with these modifications, but I was not impressed.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  My kids were not as crazy about it as we were.  I think they're not used to gruyere cheese which has a particular flavor.  The day after my husband and I made breakfast burritos using the leftovers as well as Easter ham leftovers in whole wheat tortillas...yummy!!!!

I have successfully substituted half and half in many recipes for heavy cream, but this didn't work week at all for this recipe. It came out thin and soupy instead of creamy. I think I'll keep looking.

This was my first-ever attempt at potatoes au gratin, and I found it very easy to make, which I appreciated. I used an apple-smoked Gruyère mixed with Fontina, and added quite a bit more garlic than was called for. My only critique is that they could be more flavorful: next time I might add some crumbled bacon and experiment with more spices. The family loved it as is, a big fave at Easter dinner.

We've made this four times now, and it is consistently great. Follow recipe exactly- no need to change a thing.  Splurge on the gruyere- it's worth it.  Used 10-12 oz- coarsely  shredded.  Sliced the potatoes a little thicker- that way they hold up better.  Careful not to overdo the nutmeg.
