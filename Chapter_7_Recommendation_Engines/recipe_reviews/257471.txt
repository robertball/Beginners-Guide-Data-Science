Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! Definitely making this again. Thought I made enough for 2 days of leftovers, but it was so good I ate it in 1.

Definitely more of a pasta 'bake' than mac and cheese.  I added more milk than originally called for and it was still dry.  I also halved the pesto and should have doubled the bacon.

After reading the reviews, I added a little less milk because we prefer a creamy mac and cheese.  In addition, I added a little less pesto so as to not mask the cheese flavor.  It came out perfect for us.  This recipe is so easy to adjust to your personal tastes.

I'm not sure if I should rate this a 5 or 4 star. I made some small changes by using penne and not elbow macaroni. I read the reviews about the sauce being too thin and reduced the milk to 1 cup. I think any more milk and it would have been more fluid of a sauce than I prefer. I didn't want the pesto to overwhelm the cheese sauce so I reduced the pesto to 1/4 cup. The lovely part is this recipe is versatile. I split the batch and added some chopped, cooked chicken into the second batch for a different variety. Pretty good recipe. Thanks!

We really liked this, but I do have to agree with the other reviewer that said this was more like a pesto pasta bake than a mac and cheese. Next time, I'm gonna make my usual mac and cheese sauce and add the pesto to that and see how it turns out, because I love the idea of this. It was still very tasty and we enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love pesto and love mac & cheese, so, this seemed like the perfect combination!  It had a great pesto flavor, but, didn't really taste like a "mac & cheese"to me.  The cream sauce is much thinner than a traditional mac & cheese, so, when the macaroni baked it soaked it up.  I think the flavor was good, but, I missed the creamy sauce you get from a traditional mac & cheese.   The pesto flavor is predominate, so, I think you lose the flavor of the cheese.  I did really love the taste.  It was even better the next day!

I did play with this some - but not too much. Mostly I played with the consistency of the cheese sauce to get it nice and thick (so added a fair amount more flour, but then also added a bit more liquid then called for; I used all whole milk since I didn't have any cream left). I left the bacon drippings in the pan with the butter as well, so had a little extra bacon-ey goodness and evilness in the pan. The pesto made this extra special, and my dish came out so rich, creamy, and really delicious. I loved it, and my family did as well. (I also left off the panko breading and just sprinkled the extra chopped bacon on top when it was finished with the initial bake). Perfect for Easter dinner.

We really enjoyed this! It was a great "grown-up" twist on regular mac & cheese. I replaced the regular milk with half & half, using about a cup and a half, in addition to the heavy cream.

A new fav!  I followed suggestions from other posters and lessened milk and pesto. It was delicious. I made a double recipe for the future dinners.

I will definitely make this again even though the sauce was curdled when it came out of the oven.  I followed all the instructions carefully but did use 2% milk instead of whole b/c we rarely use more than low fat milk.  That could have caused the curdling.  We loved the  pesto in the sauce, along with the bacon.  I also added some "off the block" shredded yellow cheddar and mozzarella over and above what the recipe called for, since we like it really cheesy. Thank you for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious!  The pesto is a really nice addition to the mac and cheese.  At first, I was worried that the pesto was going to overpower the dish but it was perfectly balanced with the cheese.  I made this as written and will make it again and again.

I used some of the suggestions from other reviews - more bacon, less milk, cooked the garlic in the bacon grease. I also added about four ounces of shredded mild cheddar. The result was awesome! This feels like a grown-up pesto and cheese pasta casserole, not your stereotypical Mac and Cheese. I will definitely make it again!

This came out very good. I modified it by reducing the milk to 1 1/2 cups and used about 12 oz of cheddar cheese. 8 oz extra sharp and 4 oz sharp. Will make again.

Very good dish. When I make it again I will decrease the amount of pesto and increase bacon and milk.

I made it the same exact way and it was delicious! But I think I didn't cook the noodles long enough so that was the only problem.

To be honest, I really didn’t like the bacon in this. I’d change it to chicken instead. The flavor is pretty good but the bacon kills it for me. All in all I like the pesto white cheddar mix.
