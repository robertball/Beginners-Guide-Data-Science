Love quiche, this one was just so-so!  Did not have issues with setting up, but just not a lot of flavor.   Next time I will use reg. 1/2 + 1/2 for richness and I personally roasted a poblano pepper which has 100 % more flavor than the canned stuff.  Sauteed shallots for added flavor next time........and maybe a smoked cheese! 

All in all can be improved with a few added ingredients!

Just awful. The custard didn't set up. Was soggy. Wasted all the ingredients.
