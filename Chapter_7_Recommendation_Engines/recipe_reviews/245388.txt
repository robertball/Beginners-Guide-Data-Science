What a great no-sugar recipe! It made WAY more than I needed, however. I frosted 18 donuts, and could have done a dozen more. So will cut recipe in half next time.

This did not turn out well as written. It is not sweet enough and is very clumpy. The cream cheese overpowers everything. I decided to look at the original personal recipe from the submitter's profile to see if anything was different. This published version doesn't have whipped topping listed! The original recipe calls for 1 cup of Cool Whip. I added the whipped topping, and this was smooth, creamy and spread well. It also tasted better. I posted 2 pictures, 1 without and 1 with the whipped topping.

Definitely reduce the amount of cream cheese, had to add a lot more peanut butter for my family.
