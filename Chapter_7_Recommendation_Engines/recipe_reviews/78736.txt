very easy dish, and the flavor is wonderful. I made it with wild duck which can be a bit gamey but it came out amazing

I didn't think it was that much work but I was looking for something with a bit more flavour.  If I made it again, I would add some cilantro.

Very good, even my 2 yr old loved it.  Will make again, very easy.  I cooked the duck the night before in the crock pot; it was easy to skin the next day.  I used regular white rice.

Tough call.  It turned out very delicious.  When I prepared it I did not use the entire amount of soy sauce, [unsure of the exact amount to use, since it said "drizzle"], and I needed to add some Sweet Soy sauce at the end. But overall, it was very good!!

4 cups of uncooked jasmine rice would feed an army. 2 cups works fine and to make it easy on yourself use garlic paste in a tube and ground black pepper. If using wild duck you will need to decrease the cook time by half or you will end up with livery tasting duck. Flavor combo is good but  adjustment are needed  if using wild duck.
