I did not make this in the slow cooker, I baked it in the oven at 325 convection for 35 minutes.  It's really nice, not TOO maple-y and will be a great topper for our morning yogurt or as a cereal.  Thanks for the recipe!

Since there's only 1 review so far, this must be new. (Interesting that the only review did not follow the directions and baked it in the oven! Oh well.) One question: when do you add the dates? They are listed in the ingredients and never mentioned again... Perhaps someone can correct this.

This is pretty good.  I baked it like the first reviewer as well, about 45 minutes in a regular oven at 350.  Flavor was good.  Definitely will make again.

Although the house smelled wonderful while this was cooking, the results were disappointing to say the least. I followed the directions exactly.  The granola was really bland, sort of like shredded cardboard.  I still like the idea of slow cooker granola, however if I were to try this again, I might double the applesauce, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, vanilla & maple flavoring.   Then again, it might be a good idea to call it a day and find a new recipe.

The great thing about slow cookers is you don't HAVE to check to make sure its burning. I followed previous reviews and baked it on a piece of foil. A casserole dish works as well. I omitted the extract, hemp and chia and substituted raisins for dates (dried cranberries would work as well). I did 1/4 teaspoon cardamom to zip it up but it still was a little bland. I would add more next time, pumpkin pie spice or mace might work as well. Lastly, if you bake it, remember to spray the surface with pam or something similar. A lot of the granola stuck and I had to tear it off.

My girlfriend and I really liked it, but it does have room for improvement. It smells wonderful and is very moist. I'm going to make it again, but I'm going to change the applesauce to pumpkin and make it more of a pumpkin-y take. This recipe was great with yogurt, but I feel it could use juuuuuust a bit more flavor.
