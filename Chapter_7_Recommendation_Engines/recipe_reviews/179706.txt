I was looking for a great rice recipe to serve with Filet Mignon or Prime Rib ( to mimic a favorite restaurant) and this is it !  I added green pepper slices but that was the only thing.. this is a wonderful dish.

Just to clarify-- If the rice is a little wet for you-- Just take the lid off at the end and let it cook for 5-10 minutes longer. It will be perfect.

This tastes like what Rice-A-Roni wants to be when it grows up. Next time I'll cut down on the butter and add a little less liquid. It was a bit wet for our tastes, but delicious.

Thanks for this!  Your recipe, minus the parmesan, was my mother's and grandmother's "rice pilaf."  It's awesome!

I used fresh mushrooms and garlic that I sauteed in a little of the butter called for in the recipe. My boys especially loved this rice, but both my husband and I thought it could use a little spice. Me on my own thought that the butter could be cut out a bit and maybe add in something else (like pureed vegetables) to replace some of the fat. It went really well with My Mom's Parmesan Chicken, which is also from this site, and roasted vegetables. Very simple, which this tired Mama appreciated, and it used on hand ingredients. I'll make this again, but play with it next time.

Delicious and simple!  I revised it a bit...skipped the onion, only used 3/4 stick of butter and sauteed chicken and added it to the mixture and threw it in the oven.  Presto!  Fabulous and EASY dinner!

My family totally loves this rice.  It is so super to make, and easy to customize.  My kids even wanted me to make it for Thanksgiving dinner.

This is wonderful rice - full of flavor!!!  I used chicken stock instead of the water and I only used 1/2 stick of butter.
It was YUM!!

This was great! I didn't have the consomme. I used water and three beef bullion cubes instead. I also cut the butter in half. It was great! The whole family loved it.

This was good, but could've used a bit more flavor. I didnt see a huge difference in the taste of this and a store bought rice-in-a-box product.

Did up an big old rib eye on the weber out back after popping this in the oven earlier.  I couldn't have asked for a better accompaniment!  This rice dish was right on what with the mushrooms, onion and then that buttery beefy taste.  Taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  That should say it all!

I thought this rice was lacking a bit of humpf... perhaps because I only used a quarter of the amount of butter?? After 45 minutes in the oven, there was still a lot of liquid so I cooked it uncovered for the last 15 minutes and it turned out ok.

If at all possible add in 1/2 bell pepper cut in large pieces, chicken broth instead of water and fresh mushrooms and garlic.  Exclude parm.....very flavorful and fast!  It's a family favorite for sure!

I hate to leave a bad review, but we tried this once and will not eat it again.  It was edible, but tastes like rice-a-roni.

This is by far my favorite rice recipe. Made it for a at home Valentine's Day dinner and me and my husband fell in love. I love that the oven does all the cooking!

I wanted to try this with fresh mushrooms.  Was out of beef consomme so I subbed golden mushroom soup which I didn't realize was gravy-like.  Used chicken broth instead of water as recommended and added an extra 1/2c. to make up for missing liquid from my soup/using fresh mushrooms.  After mixing, it smelled like basic rice and gravy which wasn't what I was going for so I added pepper to taste (I love me some pepper!), about 1 tsp chicken bouillon granules and 1/2 tsp dried thyme.  Then I topped with 4tbsp butter because I'm not Paula Deen.  Rice cooked up perfectly without need for additional liquid.  I only had Havarti on hand so I used that.  End result was tasty, mushroom rice (not gravy, yay!).  This was a snap to make with pre-sliced mushrooms.  Next time I won't bother with cheese, I prefer the rice alone.  When I finished my rice and put the bowl away I might have hovered over the leftover rice eating more spoonfuls.  My toddler loves rice so he happily ate two servings.
