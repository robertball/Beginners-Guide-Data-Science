I had all the ingredients on hand (so I thought) and made this for dinner.  I always have cream of mushroom and cream of celery in my pantry, however, this time  I only had cream of chicken so I used two cans of that.  I lessened the amount of pepper by half and it still was peppery and didn't have the dry mustard that I thought I did so didn't get to use that.  All in all it was a good dish, however, I'm sure it would have been better if I were to follow the recipe exactly. The cumin was the star of this show.

I made this on the stove top and it was easy to put together.  It has a different/odd combination of herbs and I was a little leery, but found they went together well. 1 T. is a lot of cumin and I cut back on it at first, but then added the rest and liked it in the stew. Also put only 1 1/2 t. of pepper in and that was plenty for us. Don't think we could have eaten it with the 1 T. called for in the recipe.
