I love this recipe and didn't change a thing, however, I didn't know whether I was supposed to drain and/or rinse the cannelini & kidney beans.

I doubled this recipes for my Bible study group of 12. I added a bit for spice for extra flavor. For the pasta - I added Orzo which I liked. The whole group enjoyed it. Very easy to make which was another plus.
I will keep this one on record and will make again.

My husband & I love this soup.  I used more spices than called for, and didn't drain/rinse the canned beans.  We have made this recipe many times & will make it again.

This soup was very thin. I had to add two cans of drained tomatoes to thicken it as well as some corn starch. It also needed more seasoning. I would NOT recommend this recipie. Try something else or buy it in the can, much cheaper and taste better!

What a great and easy recipe.
I added some red pepper for an extra kick and also some elbow macaroni.
This was an unbelievable side dish.  I also served it with some garlic bread.
Definitely a keeper.  THANKS  :)

I made a few minor changes to perfect this dish.  I added chicken bouillon cubes instead of the veg chicken seasoning- I used about 6 cubes.  This would also be good with some spinach thrown in or some diced sausage.  VERY GOOD! We love it.

This made a great Christmas week dinner enjoyed by all.  Did not add the green beans but did add more garlic.  For those who complained it wasn't thick enough....minestrone is not a thick soup unless you get it out of a can.  This is way better than canned!

The soup I made gets five stars, but I changed a lot of things from the original recipe, so this recipe only gets four. 

I didn't add the green beans, instead I used garbanzo beans, and instead of zucchini I added celery and green bell pepper. I also added more tomatoes and extra of all of the seasonings but the broth. 

This was delicious and filling, and got a lot of compliments. :)

Well, it was easy and fun to make, and a way to use up the zucchini, fresh green beans, and carrots I got from my CSA. And, while eating it, I felt really healthy and it filled me up so I wasn't hungry for quite awhile. However, I didn't really enjoy it. It just didn't taste that great to me. And my husband (who's not big on soup to be fair) really hated it.

Wow, this was great!   Just like I expected.   instead of the vegetarian chicken flavor seasoning, I used vegetarian chicken broth concentrate from a jar.  I only had 1/2 tablespoon which I didn't think would be enough, but it was perfect.  

Would definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!! It's not easy to get minestrone right but you did it!  I added 2 extra tins of tomatoes and used 3 beef stock cubes instead of the vegtarian chicken seasoning.  I was hearty, filling and most importantly - healthy! Well done, I will be making this soup every week!

Just made this today.  I gave it 4 because I thought it needed a little more tomato flavor and garlic.
  I added 4 large cloves and a small can of tomato sauce for a more depth in flavor.  
 I had some shredded zucchini in the freezer so I used that instead of fresh.
 Everything else was the same.
  Very good soup.  Very healthy soup.  Husband Loved it!
   A little cheese on top and wow, what a delicious bowl of goodness.

Perfect. I may have added more cayenne but made the recipe exactly as stated. I now make it once every few months in huge batches and freeze in indivdual portions. Super yummy and healthy!

Ran across this recipe while looking for something with green beans in the ingredients.  Fabulous recipe.  We had never had a minestrone soup.  I did some research and found that minestrone is basically a clean out the fridge soup and I set to emptying the fridge!!  My big kids liked this but the little ones balked at the chunks of veggies (like they always do).  Everyone still ate though and the older set really enjoyed it.  Changes made: Skipped the cannellini because we didn't have any, used fresh green beans and used real home made chicken broth.

This soup turned out very flavorful! The only variation from the recipe is that I added a BIG pinch of each herb versus just a pinch. I also threw in some onion and garlic powder for the heck of it. My pot wasn't quite big enough so I left out some of the water, brought it to a boil and then transferred it to my crock pot adding additional water. I let it simmer for a couple hours. I took the advice of another review and added some mini pasta shells. I am not quite sure why other reviewers indicate that the soup was too watery. If it was thick it would be more like a stew! Bottom line, we loved this soup!!! And YES it does taste a lot like the minestrone at Olive Garden!

I didn't bother with sauteing the garlic, onion, and carrots.  I just omited the oil and put the 'broth' ingredients in my slow cooker along with the seasonings (much more than a pinch).  I pureed the stewed tomatoes to give extra 'body' to the broth then added a can of diced tomatoes and just let it cook most of the day to marry the flavors well.  About an hour and a half before ready to serve I added the onions and carrots, 1 hour later added the canned vegetables along with the zucchini plus 1/2 cup of shell pasta.  I let is simmer for about 30 minutes making sure I didn't turn the zucchini into mush.

My favorite minestrone recipe. The flavor is just right. The only thing I do differently is that instead of adding the water and bouillon - I use one of those tall boxes of chicken broth. Works for me - and I get lots of compliments with this.

This is a great receipe. I tweaked it a little because that's how I cook. I used beef broth for the base, substituted Italian green beans, added one can of garbanzo beans, and 2 cups of fresh spinach. It's my most requested soup. Thanks

It tastes so good!!! Reminded me a bit of the soup at the Olive Garden Restaurant. Anyway, I just love this recipe and I think that it has become my new favorite homemade soup.

Truly one of the best Minestrone recipes out there.  Definitely add more of each of the seasonings though if you like flavor!

It was EXCELLENT!  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the beans as well ( I did) and it tasted delicious!  It wasn't too watery... just perfect... even my two year old enjoyed all the yummy beans and veggies inside (Would cut vegies to small bite size pieces for a toddler next time).  This will be a recipe I'll use in many years to come! Thanks for sharing!

This soup was very good.  The sauce was a little thin so I added half a can of tomato sauce and also used chicken stock instead of water (you could also use vegetable stock) to add a deeper flavor. I also added some chopped celery to the garlic, onion and carrot.  It was delicious!

WOW! This was the first word my fiancee said when he tried this! He loves minestrone, and this was the recipe that looked the best to us. He is a hardcore carnivore, so we added ground beef cooked with Worcestershire sauce. I also added a cube of beef bullion to the pot. We just finished the left overs, and I am making another pot tomorrow night. This recipe is fabulous! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is healthy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe because I was making it for a large group.  Everyone loved it.  I used the "Better than Bouillion" regular chicken base.  I suggest that if you use this product, taste your soup after you add 1 tbsp at a time so as to avoid it getting overly salty.  Thanks for the recipe, Ken! :)

I added Orzo pasta,corn,spinach and Turkey Italian Sausage since my husband is such a carnivore. He ranted and raved about it so much, we are having it again this week.

This is very good soup.  I added orzo (which I cooked before and added after simmering for 30 minutes) and didn't use as much water.  Very hearty!!

Excellent!!  I did make a few changes, though I tried to stick to the recipe as written as much as possible.  I omitted the zucchini, cannellini beans, bay leaves, vegetarian chicken flavor seasoning and cayenne pepper, since I had none of these. I added garbanzo beans, two stalks of celery sliced thin like the carrots, I drained every can except the tomatoes, and used only the tomato can and kidney bean can full of water.  At first, it seemed to be too little water, but the veggies cooked down and was perfect. It was not at all salty, but I refrained from adding it to the pot so each person can add their own amount to taste.  I liked garlic salt added to mine, and also an addition of parmesan cheese.  I ate 2 bowls, and almost wish I wasn't too full to eat more!  Can't wait to see how it is tomorrow reheated!

This soup is excellent in every way as far as I am concerned.  Only thing I do different is use vegetable seasoning in place of the chicken to please my vegan daughter.  I also add garbanzo beans and seashell macaroni.  Have made it for guests and have always received rave reviews.  Really don't understand the negative reviews but then again, everyone has different tastes :)

This soup came out so tasty, this is definitely going in my soup recipe rotation.  The things I changed was that I substituted frozen green beans for the canned, and two stalks of celery (diced) for the zucchini as it wasn’t in season.

I've been making this for years and love it.  Because I'm in England I use a good passata instead of stewed tomatoes. I, too, add a bit of spinach, and I add pasta and small Italian meatballs to it when it's cooked for a hearty complete meal. Also, I serve it with parmesan cheese to sprinkle as desired.

This soup was wonderful, it was flavorful without being too spicy. It was also very easy and inexpensive to make. I exchanged a small can of spinach for the carrots, and add pasta and a can of garbanzo beans. I am defiantly going to make it again!

I tried Ken's minestrone this last week. I was not impressed with it. The hardy flavors that are minestrone just did not come through. I'm sorry but I won't be using this recipe again. Andrea

02.03.13  I have cooked this soup today.  I followed the recipe 100%, adding a standard three-finger pinch of the herbs, a smaller pinch of the cayenne pepper, and 1-2 cups of noodles.  Fresh grated parmesan cheese on top.  This soup tastes very good. My wife who is vegetarian, and enjoys soup at any time of year, declared this soup better than my tomato soup.  We are to enjoy this recipe at one time every month !  Thank you Ken for sharing this recipe !

OMG, 10 stars ! This was delish !!! I made as directed but with one addition, I added small elbow macaroni as suggested by others: 2 cups;cooked, (actually 4 cups),I doubled the recipe. I've always known this soup to have pasta in it. Other than that I stayed true to the recipe. This was my first time making this, a little light on seasoning, I will amp it up next time. My husband hates veggies & was asking why I was putting in green beans & that "zucchini stuff", I shooed him away. Well, he loved it, veggies and all ! I doubled the recipe so I could have some for his family gathering & more for my vegan friend coming the next day. Good thing I did, the family finished off the first half & I had enough the next day for my friend & to share with a few other people. I still have plenty & am going to eat it all week until it's gone.. Great for people like me that still sticks to Weight Watcher's Points Plus 2 years after reaching my goal weight ! Thanks Ken !!

i loved this recipe, i just added a few of my own ideas. i used cilantro for the parsley. butternut for the zucchini, pinto beans and lentils. that was only because i didn't have peas and cannellini beans. My husband had two helpings. he said, " this is a meal not a soup!" and i drained a rinsed all beans! my kidney beans were mix and i had removed all skins from the chick peas, this is a very important step. thx for this soup recipe, will make again, by request.

This was a great recipe for a vegetarian soup. I used some fresh herbs and added chopped kale for the last 20 minutes while  the soup was on low. I also added the rind from a block of Parmesan cheese. I made some elbow pasta and added it at the very end. For my carnivore husband I put chopped cooked procuitto on top of his. It would have been too bland for his taste without it.

So yummy!  I don't normally like minestrone, but I needed something my little boy could eat after oral surgery and small bites of fairly soft veggies, beans and pasta seemed a nutritious choice. Grocery store was out of zucchini, so I used summer squash.  It added a nice bit of yellow to the reds and greens.  Also added pasta to give it some staying power to fill our hungry bellies.  Topped it with fresh grated parm and served it with fresh Italian bread.  Definitely will be making this again. Yum!

This was very good. I didn't drain any of the beans except for the green beans. I had to add more spices though, definitely called for more. I couldn't find the seasoning so I just used a chicken one I found in the store.

Delicious! This was my first Minestrone soup and my husband (very picky) and I both loved it. I didn't have cannelini beans so I used black beans, added more spices (to taste), peas, carrots, potatoes and garlic. Will definitely make again!

This was the first soup I've ever made. It has a lot of healthy ingredients, however the broth was very bland. I poached 2 chicken breasts and shredded them, I added them to the soup and then poured in the broth to add more flavor. All in all, it was a very hearty soup!

I don't like beans, but I love minestrone, so I didn't add beans.  Instead of water and powder, I used two 14oz cans of chicken broth and half a cup of water.  I added more than "a pinch" of spices, some small macaroni pasta, and two button mushrooms.  It was great, but a bit too strong on the tomato side.  I think next time, I'll drain at least one can of stewed tomatoes.

I loved it, I also added 2 Italian sausages, which I cooked with the onion and garlic.
I also omitted the oregano (my husband who is Italian hates it)

One of the few soups my husband will eat!  Says it tastes like Olive Garden. I add in some shredded spinach at the end and don't use any pasta.

I made this recipe this week after my husband "dared" me to make a good minestrone soup. I was very impressed on how easy this recipe is and how great it tastes! It tasted even better the next day!  After reading the other posts, I also left out one can of the water.  This was so good, I can't wait to make it again. I plan on sharing this recipe with others.

My first shot at minestrone and it was a 5 star soup.  I used my homemade Italian tomatoes, so I had to add a little salt and a little more bouillon.  I added a little more garlic (love garlic) too.  Was absolutely fantastic, my husband loved it.  If you aren't a big fan of spicy, leave out the cayenne pepper.  Otherwise, don't change a thing.
