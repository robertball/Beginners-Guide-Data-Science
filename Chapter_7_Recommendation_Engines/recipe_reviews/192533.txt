I have made this twice. I Followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it. I do this with all the recipes I rate to be fair, but I liked it even better the second time I made it. The second time I made it I seasoned the chicken with the spices and browned the thighs in light tasting olive oil with onion slices, then added the tomatoes. Simmered for 45 minutes, then added a splash of white wine, lime juice and fresh cilantro and cooked a minute or 2 longer when wine was cooked down. I Served it over white rice. Will definitely make again and again and use more tomatoes.
Update 7/17/17, I made this for the  first time in a while. I never make anything the same way twice lol, this time I did not add wine, lime or cilantro (because I didn't have any). Instead, I added a little chicken broth and curry powder and topped it with sour cream before eating it. I was hungry for a curry dish and this was fabulous!! I still seasoned and browned the chicken with sliced onions first, then added tomatoes and chicken broth and simmered. Yummy!! Great base tomato chicken recipe!!!

This was sooooo good.  I  only had 6 legs, I used a teaspoon of all the seasonings and through in a can of tomato sauce for extra gravey over  rice.  I also only used 2 tomatos.  Yum yum.  I will use this again and again.

Okay.  A little bit boring.  I added a bit of cayenne to spice it up.

This was really good as is! I did make a few changes in the end (I know people hate when you change a recipe- but this was really adaptable and I only made a few changes after tasting the final product)...I didn't have chili powder so I added some chili flakes instead. I didnt have ginger, so I skipped it. I used boneless skinless thighs and browned them in the coconut oil but with the tomatoes and spices in the beginning. Once it was done and I tasted it I added a tblsp. of sugar and a tblsp. of curry powder and a dash of salt. Adding these few  ingredients really brought everything together, but it would have been great without. While browning the chicken I also added a chopped onion and some sliced mushrooms I had in the fridge. I called it 'Indian chicken and tomato stew' and served it over rice. I served it to company and everyone raved and even wanted the recipe. I will be making this again. It was delicious! This is a definite keeper!

This was a very interesting mix of flavor. I did not have ginger, so subbed for 1 tsp of allspice and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Made in the electric pressure cooker putting onion garlic and chicken in after sautéing and deglazing pot with about 1/2 c chicken broth. Put tomatoes on very top to avoid scorching. Also sautéed the seasonings. Cooked on high pressure for 10 min with 10 min NPR. Will definitely make again. Thank you very much for the recipe.

Vet delicious. I made it, followed the recipe to a T and it turned out really good. I made it with chicken thighs and chicken wings both both turned out delish!

This is a very easy and very tasty recipe.  Yes, most definitely will make this again.   I did make a few changes, mostly because I did not have the exact ingredients avail.  I used chicken breasts, but did not thin them out.  I pan seared them, first, in order to speed the cooking process.  Since I didn't have fresh spices, I used the dried equivalent.  The last thing I switched, was using diced tomatoes (28 oz), as I didn't have any fresh.  All of this helped to speed the cooking, to about 30 mins, vice the 45.  My husband, who has taste issues, said that he liked this very much!

This is so good.  I never have turmeric, so I skip that part.  And canned tomatoes do a fine job.  Excellent served over spaghetti.

This menu was a nice change and consisted of items I always keep in my pantry.  I will try next time to add the tomato past or a little cornstarch so the sauce is a little thicker.  But other than that, it was a great recipe!

Enjoyed this easy recipe. Will be great for end of summer tomato blowout. Sure maybe a tad more spice is needed. With garlic bread on the side to soak up the juices we enjoyed. Chicken did not brown as stated before juice got going. Next time I will put chicken in first with the spices and wait on putting tomatoes in. Just to see if there is difference in something.

I think this is a great recipe that you can throw together in less than an hour.  It's not boring in the least.  It has some great flavor.  It's not powerful spicing, but it's not just salt and pepper either.  Very tasty and good for those who are sensitive to overly spicy foods.

I would agree with one of the reviews.  It would be really good if you seasoned the chicken with the spices and browned the thighs in olive oil first, then added the tomatoes.  Otherwise there is far too much liquid for the thighs to brown before simmering.  I also like the idea of adding the wine, lime juice and fresh cilantro at the end, for additional flavor.

This recipe was pretty good, but just a tad boring for me. My husband and I love flavorful food, and this was lacking a little. I served it over brown rice.

The spice combination is perfect. I made it with canned tomatoes because that is what I had. Delicious. However, I did sear the chicken in spices prior to adding the tomatoes as one reviewer advised.

Made to the recipe except for pre-browning the chicken as suggested by others, and sauted the spices, garlic, (de-seeded) tomatoes, and ginger before adding the chicken back in.     Served over baked brown rice.     Not at all spicy, ginger was NOT overwhelming.  DH happy.   Smelled great whilst cooking, and very easy to make.

Disappointed. Followed the instructions but chicken lacked flavor, even took the extra step to score the drumsticks before cooking. Wondering if this recipe would work well in a slow cooker...?

My kids and my hubby loved it!  I added too much chili powder and ended up putting some half and half cream to balance out the spice but overall it turned out fantastic.  I made it with a creamy Alfredo pasta, which turned out to complement the chicken.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!!  I made it on the spur of the moment, so was missing a couple of ingredients. I used ketchup instead of tomatoes and used minced ginger from a tube.  I also used breasts instead of thighs so it cooked much faster. Absolutely wonderful and I plan to make it a staple.

This recipe was SO simple, SO easy, and SO tasty.   
The only changes I made were...  I added a little vermouth when cooking the chicken and I used a small can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  
This one is going in my regular meal rotation.

Chicken gets very tender from the tomatoes. Really quick and easy one pot dish. I did follow one of the reviews and added cooking wine, cilantro, and onion. I didn't have cayenne so I added crushed red pepper and siracha. I liked the little kick and added flavor. I served it over brown rice which was perfect. The turmeric and ginger gave it an Indian food taste.

This was very good. I doubled it because it would not have made enough for my family.  It wasn't too spicy for my father which was good. My sons and I added hot sauce when we ate it. I partially cooked the chicken and removed it from the bones before making this.  My father is elderly and has a hard time eating chicken off the bone.  I think it could use some onions and peppers, and even some black olives. I will it that way next time.

Made this recipe this evening and it turned out really well. I did rub the chicken with the spices prior to browning in about a tablespoon of Wildtree Roasted Garlic Grapeseed oil (didn't have fresh ginger, so I added a heaping 1/4 tsp to the rub) It smelled heavenly! After about three minutes of browning on each side, I added the garlic and tomatoes. I used four rather large heirloom tomatoes from our garden. Then let it braise for 45 minutes, removed the chicken from the sauce and added a tablespoon of tomato paste and seasoned with the rub ingredients again. I served this over basmati rice with Palak Paneer, Raita and garlic naan. There was no fear of vampires coming to our house this evening with all the garlic ingested. Thank you sandradxb for sharing this recipe, can't wait to make it again!

I thought this recipe was just OK.  I may modify it the next time, but not sure if I'll try it again.  I always like to try new things, however, so thank you.
