Pineapple should not be drained. Doesn't have much pineapple taste. Husband didn't like them. I doubled the batch in the first place and after his complaint, I added a whole can of crushed undrained pineapple and a cup more of flour. Perfect.

made today, and have to say they didn't turn out like the picture. ended up having to add almost another cup of flour, to keep them spreading all over my cooking sheet, plus next time cutting one egg, this is basically a easy sugar cookie recipe with pineapple and lemon extract so it's needs to be thicken up because of the pineapple and the three eggs.

I loved this recipe. I like the cake like feel of the cookie. I didn't have any lemon extract, so used 2 tablespoons of lemon rind instead.  Awesome flavor.  I am going to use pineapple chunks next time just to see how that changes the cookie.

These don't have enough pineapple in them for my taste. I found them to be pretty bland.
