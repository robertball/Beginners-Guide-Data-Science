I made these three times in a week! Everywhere I went people devoured them! Yum. Definately make them in a jelly roll pan. If you use a 9x13 it's more like cake - which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you want cake. Either way these are light chewy and delicious!

I am only rating the frosting as I was only looking for a frosting when looking at the recipe. I usually never put frosting on brownies but wanted to this time. And it was GREAT! I used powdered sugar instead because I like a creamy not grainy frosting. I will definitely make it again!

Terrible. Not chocolatey enough and too sweet. If you like marshmallow cream puff cool whip parade chances are good you'll like this.

Great! These tasted a lot like my Grandma's homemade chocolate sheet cake but made flat bars. Thanks for the recipe!
