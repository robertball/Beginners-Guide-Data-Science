I have made these w/ my son and nephews almost every Halloween and they are always a hit! I use melted chocolate or frosting in place of the honey, and usually orange decorating icing/gel instead of the black. This is definitely fun for kids, and the adults too! :)

These turn out so cute and they are incredibly easy to make. I've made them a few times and they are always a hit. What kid (or adult) doesn't like a fudge cookie and a Hershey's kiss??
I do skip the honey part of the recipe, instead using the piping gel (orange looks great against the cookie and the kiss) to connect the kiss with the cookie. If some of it squishes out under the base of the kiss, it looks like a ribbon around the 'hat'. Just let them sit for an hour or so to dry and they are ready!

Really cute idea although I'm thinking a little frosting would work better than the honey.  Honey was kind of drizzled over everything after a few of these were taken off the plate.  Used dark choc fudge stripe cookies and dark choc kisses.  Flavor is average b/c afterall, this is just a fudge strip cookie with a kiss on top :)

Super fun and very easy!  My 5 year old made these with some minimal instruction.  These would be a fun treat to make as a class project.

Cute and simple, my daughter and daughter in-law thought it was a clever idea. I put them in lunch boxes for a cute seasonal treat. I did not use honey just frosting and I opted for orange frosting.

Very easy and fun for the kids to help.  We used a couple different items to 'glue' the kisses to the cookies instead of honey: melted chocolate was kinda messy but worked; nutella added a yummy flavor twist; peanut butter went really well with all the chocolate but harder to cover up with the decorating gell.

Such a simple and cute idea.  You would think it would be easy to decorate wouldn't you?  Well, unless you are talented like Andy Warhol, you might find the decorating a little more challenging than you would think at first.  I know I did.  The decorations on my hats looked like the witch had been flying in the wind at a high rate of speed.  The hats really had the "wind blown" look.  But I still adored them.   Made them for my three little nephews (ages 8, 6, and 4).  They loved them.  I will make them again, keeping in mind that decorating takes a bit more effort and time than it looks like it would. 

I used the honey to secure the point of the hat.  It doesn't take but just a dab.  I put the honey on one chocolate kiss and pressed another chocolate kiss against the first one, rubbed them together.  This made "glue" application very easy and fast.  No "glue" squished out at the bottom when applied to the hat.

As far as the taste, nothing exceptional.  But after all, this is not Gourmet Cookie Making 101.  It is just shortbread cookies dipped in fudge with a chocolate kiss on the top.  Worth the effort for a special holiday treat for your loved ones.

I'm not the most crafty person but I do try. The gel was too soft, so it made it hard to make the ribbons.  They're ok. I like the picture here much better than how mine look, but since so many others gave it great reviews maybe I just need to play w different kinds of frosting material for the ribbon. :/ disappointed

The honey did not hold the kisses in place. The kisses slipped around while trying to add the colored frosted rim. Finally gave up. Cute idea but too hard to complete.

Was fun to make - couldn't find yellow or white piping, so used red - made the hat look eerie.   Friends enjoyed it - great for chocolate lovers!

I made it by melting some kisses in a bowl floating in a pan of warm water.  I coated the bottoms of each kiss with a bit of melted chocolate and then placed it on the cookie covering the hole.  Then I placed the sheet pan of cookies in a cool place overnight  and they were ready to go.  I thought it was a very easy and fast way to attach the hat tops.

Really fun and easy! I substituted chocolate PB2 mixed up a little thicker than I would normally for peanut butter to adhere the Kisses to the cookies - which I think also added some flavor.  If you've never tried PB2, I highly recommend it!

I made these for my Bunco club at Halloween, very cute! I used an off brand cookie that didn't  have a hole in the center, I used icing to secure the chocolate drop and I didn't do the buckle. My grade school granddaughters helped and they took home a batch...they had fun and were proud of their cookies!

I made these for my granddaughters with mixed success.  They get five stars for the concept, but only 3 for execution, the main problem being that the gel is very difficult to control and looks very messy.

I used dark chocolate Fudge Stripe cookies, for uniformity in color.  Instead of using honey, I melted a few kisses in a small bowl and dipped the bottoms of the kisses for the hats into it before sticking them on the cookies.  That worked well and was less messy and more secure than I think the honey would have been.

If I were to make these again, I think I'd make a small amount of buttercream icing and tint it yellow for the trim.

Super cute but I used red icing and it would be better with a brighter color. 4 instead of 5 cause I used chocolate icing instead of honey and everyone loved them.

Didn't have any decorater icing. Used peanut butter and Halloween decorating pieces.  Also used a tiny bit of honey to stick the kiss on and then refrigerated for a few hours. They stuck together great!

Too cute! And extremely easy! I suggest getting a “backup” package of cookies- because I encountered a chunk of broken & that can make or break the total count. But, these are easily made, great for kids to assemble! Easy does it on the deco frosting. Very simple & visually appealing- they go quickly!

These were delicious and light. We added 2 tsp. vanilla.
We also experimented with adding dried cranberries to some of the batter. It tasted good, if you like cranberries. My husband graced his cookie with a dollop of whipped cream. The possibilities are never ending. Thanks for sharing.

These were fun and really easy to do.  I cheated and used some melted chocolate to attach the kisses.  Not a fan of honey. First time ever using gel and it wasn't the greatest but  didn't turn out nearly as bad as I thought it would.  Will need LOTS of practice to make the bow.  I really enjoyed making these.

I made these for the 'grown-ups' at work - they loved them!  I  used yellow decorative icing and put it on the very edge of the kiss when I flattened them on the cookie they not only stuck, but made a lovely ring around the kiss.

Super easy to make, and so cute! I attached the Hershey's kiss with frosting and made orange "ribbon" around the hat in true Halloween spirit. They're going to be a hit at my work potluck! My one recommendation is to not leave the cookies unattended while making these. I had to toss a package when my lab decided to lick all the rows because she dubbed herself "quality control."

I'm giving this 4 stars based on this....5 stars for ease and visual outcome of this recipe but only 3 stars for taste...hence a 4 star rating. It's still a store bought cookie and tastes that way so if your looking for a quick easy fun cookie to make with the little ones as helpers this is a great option but if your looking for something YUMMY GOOD to impress the adults this is not the go to recipe.

Very fun easy treat to make.  My 4 and 6 yr old great granddaughters helped make them to share at their schools.

I USUALLY  DO NOT MAKE THESE CUTSIE TYPE OF BAKING THINGS BUT I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  THEY CAME OUT REALLY WELL AND SO VERY EASY TO DO.  I USED ORANGE FOR TRIM AROUND THE KISSES AND PUT A DOLLOP OF ORANGE ON THE TIPPY TOP.  I AM BRINGING THEM TO A GROWN UP PARTY AND I KNOW THEY WILL BE APPRECIATED.
