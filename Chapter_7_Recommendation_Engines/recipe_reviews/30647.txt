Boo My hubby and daughter did not like. I on the other hand really liked it. Seems how it is just the 3 of us I won't be making again.

1 lb of mean is not enough. I had to add another 1/2 lb to get enough coverage in a 9x13 dish.

20 minutes was not nearly long enough to cook this. After 20 minutes the biscuit dough was still uncooked underneath the meat, and nearly burnt on the bottom. (maybe from the extra meat?)

I might try it again with store  bought bread or pizza dough.

This is quick and easy I just flattened the buscuit and made it kind of like a pizza. I would love to try it the way the recipe states. So easy and great tasting quick meal.

So easy and great for kids.  I used dried minced onions instead of chopped onions.  It added the flavor without the kids needing to pick out any onions.

Really enjoyed this.  For us, it served four.  Used three "layer" biscuits, pulled apart.  Filled an 11x7" baking dish.  Time was right on.  Thanks, Pam.

Very dry.  I added 1/4 cup extra BBQ sauce when I saw how dry the meat mixture was.  There were not enough biscuits to cover the bottom of the pan.
Even with the extra sauce, it was largely tasteless.

This was pretty good, pre-cooked the biscuits on the bottom for about 7-10 min also added a layer of biscuits on top. Made a mixture of BBQ sauce, Heinz 57, ketchup, brown sugar. I thought the BBQ only would be a little overbearing...Also added can of baked beans to the meat mixture for flavor and filling. I baked in an 8*8 pan so one can biscuits was sufficient.

My teenage sons and hubby really liked it. It was very easy to make, and the hot pepper sauce kept it from being too sweet with the BBQ sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Tried this out tonight, and it turned out pretty good.   Was quick and easy to make, though in retrospect I might just make chili and biscuits next time as it would take  little longer but the end result would be tastier.

I was hesitant at first with this recipe.  My roomate had picked it out.  It doesn't sound too appetizing with just the ingredient list but it ends up coming out really good.  I was pleasantly surprized!

This is a great recipe to prep in the morning before work.  I like to brown the beef and onions, add the bbq sauce and Tabasco, then put in a plastic container and put in fridge until I get home from work.  Then all I have to do is finish the last two steps.

I used ground turkey to be healthier and it turned out really well.  This was very easy to make; great for a fast weeknight dinner!  My 10 year old son loved it and he is very picky.

Good recipe.  It was hit with my family, we left out the onions and used onion salt instead, then we doubled the hot sauce.

I wanted a meal that was quick to prepare and quick for clean-up.  I flattened the biscuits and placed them in an 8 inch square dish.  I used Weber's Smoky and Thick Applewood Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce and left out the hot sauce.  I served it with a cold macaroni salad.  Dinner tasted like a picnic.  I'll make it again!

I thought this was pretty good for a quick, easy last minute meal. There were a few changes made based on availability and interests of all ;) I used 1 lb of ground beef, onion powder instead of onions for kids' sake, added garlic powder as well. I took the advice as another reviewer and baked the biscuits first ( 3 min.) then added the ground beef mixture (used Bullseye Hickory smoked BBQ sauce as well as a little New Braunfels Smokehouse Texas bbq sauce). I used about 4 slices american cheese cut up in 3 smaller pieces each and laid over meat mixture evenly, as well as added about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese as this was all the cheese we had on hand. Baked for 15 minutes. Biscuits were perfectly cooked and the dish overall tasted well put together. I will definitely make this again! 2 kids like it, 2 others didn't :)

Great, quick recipe.  Another idea instead of putting this together in a casserole dish is to press the biscuits into a muffin pan and fill the cups with the beef mixture and cover with cheese.  A family favorite for sure!

I wish I could say that I had the success that some of the other users experienced, but for me this recipe was a bust.  The final product was dry and bland.  There must be a particular barbeque sauce that's ideal to use.  Maybe more beef would have helped.  I don't know, but it was a disaster.  Sorry :(

I didn't have refrigerator biscuits so I made my own biscuit recipe and lined the pan with it.  It turned out great!  My husband loved it.  It perfect for when he comes home from working the afternoon shift and wants a meaty snack.

So simple yet so tasty!This was a hit with us all, the leftovers were even good cold, eaten out of hand...good lunch box fare. The only change I made was to use ground turkey and it was a 1 and 1/3 pound package. I am glad...one pound would not have covered the biscuits very well.

This was SO EASY!  And really good!  I have 4 kids, all of whom are "quirky" eaters and 3 out of 4 LOVES this!  So did hubby and my sister in law.  It was a great QUICK recipe for after football practice.  I doubled up on the bisquits, because it didn't look like enough.  And I only put in a dash or two of tabasco.  Definately a "do again" recipe for my family!  Thank you!!!

Very easy to make and tasty!  My very picky husband enjoyed this very much.  I didn't add the Tabasco sauce because I didn't have any, but we're not huge fans of hot sauce anyways.

This is a great recipe with ingredients you always have in the fridge and it takes no time at all to prepare. The kids are sure to love this one as mine did!
