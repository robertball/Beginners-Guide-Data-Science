Really great!!  I used this on chicken breasts and it turned out really well.  I applied the rub and put the chicken back in the fridge for a few hours and then applied some more.  The only change I might make is to maybe add cayenne pepper because I like it hot!!.

This was good, I like my rubs with a little more spice, but I did like this!

This was really good, a true all purpose rub. I used it on pork chops and chicken so far successfully. I will put in some cayenne and garlic powder next time as I thought it was missing that hint of kick. Very good recipe overall though.

As the name implies a good all-purpose rub.  Like other reviewers I thought it was a little salty.  Will cut it back the next time.  Also halved the sugar out of personal preference.

There was too much salt in this rub. Next time I will use one tablespoon of salt.
