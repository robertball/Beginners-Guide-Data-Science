Great Yorkies!!  The only note I would add is from a friend of a friend- who's a chef in London England!!!
- take out your ingredients and leave on the counter till room temp.
- mix together thoroughly and refridgerate pudding mixture for one hour.
-preheat the pudding/muffin tin for 3-5 minutes, till very HOT, and add pudding mixture- bake as recipe says.

Being of English heritage I too had this many times.  Only diff. my grandmother used a cast iron skillet instead of muffin tins. It came out puffy and round so she cut it in pie shaped wedges.  The key is getting the pan hot before pouring in batter so don't try to skip this step.

I only made the Yorkshire Pudding. I used about 1/2 inch of veggie oil instead of drippings (I like to save all the drippings I get for gravy!) I added an extra egg by mistake and heated the muffin tin in a 450 degree oven. (important!) I've found that the trick to perfect Yorkshire pudding is NOT TO OPEN THE OVEN during the first 3/4 of baking time. My puddings were perfect. I'm never swerving from this recipe; I've made it 6 times now and each time it's been PERFECT.

Excellent, especially the Yorkshire puds. Rather than waste the vegetables by roasting the meat on top of them and discarding them as one reviewer suggested, I too removed the rack but lined the roasting dish with non stick foil. I then added pieces of carrot, parsnip, kumara (orange yam), potatoes and butternut squash all tossed in olive oil and salted to taste, in with the beef for about 90 mins. Served it all with rich gravy and...viola!  Sunday roast to die for. Sadly though not a scrap leftover for sandwiches!

An excellent idea to use garlic powder.  Never come across until now.  We use English mustard powder, ground rock salt and five-corn pepper to dust the fat surface before roasting. When roasting, it's a good idea to get rid of the metal rack, and replace it with various washed, peeled (or unpeeled), halved vegetables: potatoes, parsnips, carrots, turnips will do.  Just enough to raise the meat from the bottom of the roasting pan. This adds flavour, and stops the meat drying out. These are not intended to be served at table, although uses can be found for them. Remember also to steam potatoes, until a knife begins to go in easily, then set them aside to cool awhile. Then roast them in pre-heated beef dripping.

This is one of the recipes that has help us revive the family tradition of getting together for Sunday dinner. The Yorkshire puddings make this meal special. We serve a horseradish sauce sauce with the meat and puddings. The flavors are great together.

I've read every review and haven't seen the way my mother-in-law used to make the Yorkshire pudding. Here is how she always served it.  Baked in a pie plate as is this recipe, but served by sprinkling sugar on top and squeezing lemon juice on top of that before cutting!  I had never eaten it before so this is the only way I know it to taste.  It's great!  Try it, you'll like it too :)

Here's the secret to perfect Yorkshire puddings - they never fail.  Measure out your eggs in a measuring cup.  Use the exact measure of whatever your eggs were and add the exact same amount of flour and milk.  Mix well and let it sit on the kitchen counter for about an hour.  Mix before pouring in a deep cup tin that has been smoking in a really hot oven - about 450 degrees.. the fat MUST be that hot.. then cook for 20 minutes and whatever you do, don't open the oven door while they bake!

I averaged this score to a four-star, since the roast beef was a 3, but the yorkshire pudding was a 5. The beef was pretty standard and a little dry. It didn't make any drippings, so I used butter for the yorkshire puddings. I had to use a different cut of beef (bottom round, if I remember correctly) and there wasn't a lot of fat on it, so I'm sure that had something to do with the meat being so dry and there being no drippings. The yorkshire puddings were exactly how I remember them from childhood when my mom used to make them though, and they were just great. I'll make those again, though probably with a different main course. I served this with "Mushy Peas I" from this site, and dinner was fantastic.

Very Yummy! I grew up in New England where this exact meal was a Christmas tradition. It is so important to already have the pan you will cook the Yorkshire Pudding in well-heated and to add any beef drippings along with a little butter!

A wonderful recipe.  So easy, but so delicious.  My mom always made the Yorkshire pudding in the same pan as the beef.  When you take the beef out of the pan, put the pudding in the pan and put it back in the oven.  One less dish to clean!!

Eeewww....meat was tough and tasteless...the pudding/bread/pop-over things were dense rounds of congealed baked goo.  (My son, reading over my shoulder now, is suggesting I reduce this rating further to a ONE!)

I'm still trying to perfect the puddings, but this was a great first pot roast! Cooked a 3lb roast on chopped celery and baby carrots with red potatoes. There was so much of the drippings, I could have filled the muffin tins with just that! Ended up putting around 4t of juice in and evenly distributed the pudding mix. Turned out well - thank you for the wonderful recipe!

You will want this meal every sunday! My husband is from Scotland and he insists on a Sunday roast with Yorkshire pudding.  Our grocer doesn't carry pre-made puddings so I found this recipe and use it every week!  I also serve it w/ an Au Jus gravy and lots of it!

This was very tasty.  However my roast continued to cook while it rested, as I only have one oven, had to make the pudding after taking out the roast.  So would cook it for a shorter period of time, to allow for the resting.  Also would grease the muffin tin, as the pudding stuck.  But was very satisfying and reminded me of my grandmother's cooking.

I am rating this recipe for the yorkshire pudding because I was looking for something to serve with a pot roast and found this. It was excellent. The only thing I did differently was to use bacon grease in place of the pan drippings because that is how I've always liked it best. I will use this recipe from now on. Thank you.

Rump roast is definitely NOT the cut of beef to use if you are planning yorkies and gravy IMHO. Rump roasts are much too lean and produce very little, if any, drippings. I made my yorkies in some leftover bacon fat in a 10 inch cast iron and they were light and delicious. The roast was cooked a perfect medium rare. But both would have much better with some gravy. A fattier cut of meat, such as a rib roast, would greatly improve this whole meal. The leftovers made a delicious beef vegetable soup. I added diced bits of the leftover yorkie to the soup. Very yummy!

Added some onion powder to the rub and roasted the beef to perfection. Pink in the middle but not raw. A one-pound roast cooked perfectly in about 35 minutes. Let it rest for 10 minutes. I've never tried making Yorkshire pudding before. They're quite easy, actually, and quite tasty. I see why people like them. This British meal is ... brilliant!

I don't use a rump roast for anything but pot roast.  I use a rib roast and follow Chef Johns instructions in his video for the roast, but this is an excellent recipe for Yorkshire pudding.  My Grandmother was English and used to make her Yorkshire at Christmas in the same pan as the roast also.  To the reviewer who ended up with Yorkies as "baked congealed globs".......you did something wrong!  You couldn't have followed these directions to get THAT!  Either you didn't bake it long enough or your pan wasn't hot when you poured in the batter!  And your batter should be room temp before you pour it into the sizzling hot pan.

PERFECT mixture.  What I've learned is...after making the pudding mix, let it stand on the counter with a damp cloth covering the mixing bowl for at least 20 minutes - almost becoming room temp.  DO NOT FORGET TO LAY AN OVEN LINER ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR OVEN or else you will be cleaning up a big mess :)

Big clue to GOOD popovers or yorkshire pudding: use unbleached flour.  The airiness and size double.

I don't understand why I need to get the eggs/milk at room temperature before they are combined and THEN refrigerate for an hour, but I take this suggested step and the puddings always turn out. I also only use vegetable oil in the pan (no drippings) because I find that the drippings tend to burn. Great recipe and surprisingly easy.

My grandmother used to make this. We love it. I usually do not use a muffin tin. I make it in the pan I cooked the roast in. That way I do not lose any of the drippings for flavor.  Then we cut it like we would a pan of brownies.

Fantastic!  My son had three helpings of this.  The Yorkshire puddings came out great.  I have never made yorkies before even though I am from England.  I also added roast potatos to the meal, and some home made gravy.  Delisio.  Will make this again.

I cooked this in a rotisserie oven at 375 for about 75 minutes and it was a bit overdone.  I also used a venison roast which was very lean so I didn't get many drippings.  I subbed melted butter in the pudding.  I've never had anything like this before so I didn't know what to expect.  The pudding was really strange looking, but tasted awesome.  And outside of me cooking it too long, the roast was fine.  Would definitely experiment with this again...

For those that have asked:  I was taught to always have eggs at room temperature and the mixing bowl and beaters refrigerated.  This is especially important with recipes that call for beaten egg whites.

This recipe was great.  I used a 3# roast because my grandmother told me that's the minimum size (?).  It's funny how the old lessons stick.  Next time I want to try the dry mustard along with the garlic powder.

Amazing recipe.  Great on both counts.  I've never made Yorkshire pudding before, but I've enjoyed it many times.  My Yorkshires didn't turn out as I would have expected, though I'm quite sure it was user error.  They looked a little funny, but they tasted INCREDIBLE!  Thanks!

I love these yorkshires, they come out with a perfect texture and consistency. I make them to go with lots of meals besides roasts. I wasn't a huge fan of the roast itself though. Not bad, I just prefer more flavour, and the roast here is quite basic. This is my go-to recipe for yorkies though!

My first  time making roast; I used an outside round oven roast.  It was so simple and good, and the Yorkshire pudding was very good too, only they stuck to the muffin tin, so next time I think I need more drippings.

I first made this for a picky friend who always had roast w/Yorkshire Pudding for Sunday dinner with his family. He loved it. My only change is to use either my pie plate or a 9X9 baking dish to make the pudding in. My pre-schoolers even like the pudding with the roast!

Very good!  I rubbed the beef with mustard powder as well as garlic powder, salt and pepper and the flavor was good.  I didn't get much drippings from my beef unfortunately, but used some canola oil to make up the difference for the yorkies.  They rose perfectly and tasted great with the beef and gravy!  Very impressive!

Downright delicious! For better drippings mind your meat's grade/marbling and sit on top of veggies as previously recommended; adds wonderful flavor!

Yorkshire  puddings tuned out wonderfully, but I used oil instead of drippings to cook them since my roast produced no drippings at all. I think to get more drippings the cut with more fat is required. Overall, I liked this recipe a lot.

Delicious roast beef! Made it last night for my boyfriend who is from England. I really love to find recipes that remind him of home. Only mistake (which was all mine) was I cooked it for 90 minutes for med-rare, but it wasn't quite cooked "enough." As I said, my mistake, I had nearly a 3lb roast rather than a 2lb as the recipe calls for. 
This was my second attempt at yorkshire pudding (first was a cookbook recipe), both times neither were great. I think I will start using the suggestsions in the reviews when I make it. 
But the roast was so good we used the remainders tonight for "bubble and squeek" for dinner.

Just like I remember it being made. Well done thisone was. The directions rather, not the beef. Yorkshire pudding, btw, at its best. Sure, you can use the butter as opposed to the pan drippings, but then again, why bother going thru the entire mess if your not willing to go 100%, nu? And isn't your family worth it?

This recipe was excelent.  I have never made yorkshire puddings before and they came out excellent.  I used melted butter instead of the pan drippings as I was making for a weeknight meal and I needed everything to be ready at once. It still turned out really good, however I am sure they would have been much more flavorfull if I would have used the pan drippings.  I will definetly make this again.

I've eaten Yorkshire Pudding since I was a child. Believe it or not, my first experiences with it was in our public schools' hot lunch in Denver, Colorado.
 The history behind Yorkshire Pudding is that it originated in England beside a SMALL piece of roast beef in order to stretch the servings of beef, due to the high cost of beef. LOL, another case of history repeating itself.

The roast beef turned out wonderfully tender and my first attempt at making Yorkshire pudding worked! It puffed up nicely. So, I guess I should have served it with some gravy as that was how I was told to eat it when I visited my friends in England, but I forgot... Next time, I will whip up some gravy to serve with the Yorkshire pudding and roast beef. Thank you for a simple yet tasty recipe!

The beef was good. My first time having Yorkshire pudding, so I don't know if they were good or bad. Not a popover fan, so as I expected, these won't be going into my rotation, but that is strictly a personal choice.

I lived in England for 3 years, and my children were born there. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding was my favorite meal there, and this recipe tastes the same! I would suggest you take the puds out of the pan when they are done so they don't get flat and chewy. Learned that the hard way! They were still good, though! I added potatoes and carrots to the roasting pan, and they were a great addition! Perfect Sunday meal, and leftover roast for sandwiches if you make a larger one.

The roast was good, I but would have preferred more salt.  I did sear the outside.  Also, I peeled 4 large carrots and layed them in a row on the bottom of the pan.  Rested the meat on top and placed sweet potato, red potato, onion, celery, carrots and butternut squash (all quartered or chopped) around the roast.  When done, the roast was perfectly pink inside and the vegetables were nicely roasted.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked the pudding in a cast-iron skillet.  I followed the directions to the t and it came out so good.  Though I've had it many times growing up, I never tried to make it and I was very proud of myself. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was very good. I added sliced garlic on top of the meat and then sliced peppered bacon. Loved the yorkshire pudding. I have been making the pudding as a breakfast food all my life but having it as a savory side was fun.

I sprinkled a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix on the top. Yum!

My roast was tough as leather, but that's not the recipe's fault. I added a couple tablespoons of herbs de provence to the rub and it was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. I roasted some baby potatoes and carrots alongside in foil also, but the star of this recipe is the Yorkshire Pudding, which came out PERFECT! Thank you! We ate all of them (there's only 2 of us), I'll make more tomorrow to go with the leftover roast I already threw in the crockpot to tenderize. :P

I've never had yorkshire pudding before, so I can't compare this to anything else. It was delicious though! You really have to let the meat rest for a WHILE so the juices won't run out when you cut it. Also, I did not really have any drippings. I used another reviewers idea to use vegetable oil. That was great, except it overflowed in the oven and smoked up my kitchen!! Please put a pan underneath! Also, I couldn't find any directions that it told how many muffin tins to prepare??? I used 6, this seemed OK. They really puffed up nicely and my husband and the kids were all calling dibs on the last one!! Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty.  I used the advice of others and sprinkled a generous amount of Montreal steak spice over the entire roast after brushing it with mustard.  I reduced the temperature to 325 for remainder of cooking time rather than turning oven off, resulting in a medium roast.  The pan drippings made awesome gravy.

I keep trying new recipes in the anticipation of a visit from my Vegetarian British grand-daughter-in-law this summer.  I can make, for her Yorkshire Pudding using butter instead of pan drippings.  Later I will revert to the original traditional recipe.

A very nice meal!  My husband and I had never tried Yorkshire Pudding before, so we didn't have anything to compare it to.  We really enjoyed it, though!  I cooked my roast in a terra cotta apple baker and it turned out very moist.

This was wonderful! Though I couldn't find a rump roast so I got a tenderloin one instead. The puddings were fantastic and everyone loved them, I had to make extra! The only correction I made was adding extra garlic powder, salt and pepper. Went great with peas, boiled potatoes and gravy.

Cooking temp was too high on the beef and the Yorkshire Pudding was a disaster. I used non stick muffin pan and the puddings stuck to the sides of the pan and all we got were doughy tops.   I pride myself with being a competent cook and would not make this again. Sorry.

This is a wonderfully simply recipe that makes a very tasty roast and yorkshire pudding.  When I make it I tend to put some potatoes, carrots and onions drizzled with olive oil around the roast well it's in the oven.  The flavor from the veggies and roast combine nicely when it comes time to make the pudding.

Back in the UK my kids used to eat any left over yorkshires with some jam (jelly) for supper so I never use the beef drippings. Instead I use a small dot of lard in each muffin space and heat until smoking hot.

Ok... I must admit that I've never actually had Yorkshire Pudding before.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, based on the rave reviews, but this stuff was not very appealing.  Maybe there is some user error... it looks pretty edible, but it tastes like flan with no flavor at all.  My roast didn't make more than one or two tablespoons of drippings, so maybe that was the problem.  The meat looks pretty good (we're letting it rest while I hastily fix another side dish), so here's hoping!  Just really has very little flavor at all. - Ok, this one gets three stars because the meat was excellent.  We either really don't like Yorkshire pudding, or this one went really wrong, but the meat part of the recipe is wonderful.

The family loved the yorkshire pudding, and that includes a picky husband lol.  I made my roast beef in the crockpot so iI couldn't rate this roast beef.  The yorkshire pudding though will probably become a family favourite.

I really did not care for this recipe.  I found it very bland.
