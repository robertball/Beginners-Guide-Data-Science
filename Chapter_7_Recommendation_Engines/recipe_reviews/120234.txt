Awesome recipe Joan! We went to an orchard this year and picked over 60 lbs of apples. I had 10 different varieties and wanted to make something that I could give out as gifts.  This bread was terrific! For my personal taste, I made these changes: I used 3 apples of varying degrees of sweetness, 1 1/2 c. sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of vanilla extract. I didn't have mayonnaise so I substituted plain yogurt. Not a fan of raisins in bread so I left them out. I have now made this recipe three times and each time I got rave reviews. Thanks for another "keeper" in my recipe box!

I just made this bread and it was moist, tender and very tasty.  I did not have the raisen's so I added approx 1/2 cup more apples.  On a scale of one to ten: ten!!  Fit for the most prestigeous visitors.

This is interesting - I use a recipe called "Rocky Mountain Apple Bread" from Sunset's Breads cookbook, except that the recipe states 3 and 1/2 cups of flour! Everything else is exactly the same! (maybe it's a typo here?) So if you are going to make this, I recommend using 3 and a half cups of flour and you will have two nice big 9x5 loaves of tasty apple raisin nut bread! Also, I soak the raisins (or sometimes cranberries) in hot water for maybe 10 min. before adding them to the batter, so they are plumper and juicier. And if you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can add a splash (like half a Tbsp) of lemon juice to the 1/2 cup of milk and let it sit a few min. and it seems to work great!
Hope this helps. Enjoy!!
(I give this 5 stars if you use 3 and a half cups of flour, not 2 and a half cups!)

i thought this bread was phenomenal! i left out the nuts and halved the recipe for a thanksgiving appetizer, and everyone loved it.  i used reduced-fat mayo, although the footnote says not to, and i still thought it tasted great.

Very, very good! Excellent after-school snack with milk or with a cup of coffee. I had apples in the frig and decided to try this recipe.  I didn't have raisins but added another apple as a reader suggested.  The fragrance of the bread baking is wonderful!

I hestitated even giving this recipe a 4  but did so based on flavor - not texture.    I guess I am in the minority but I did have to add more flour otherwise the raisins would have been on the bottom - very soupy mixture.  The recipe did not state how well the eggs, etc should beaten.  It would always be considered very important that a contributor state exactly if the liquid ingredients are to be beaten with a mixeror just whisked together.  This could make a bit difference to the finished product.   Unfortunately on this site it isn't possible to contact the author of a recipe directly which would be a big asset.

I thought this bread was good.  My kids loved it.  I left out the raisins because i didn't have any, and added a few extra apples.  I did use the low fat mayo, (the kind with olive oil in it) and it came out just fine.  It was done at about 45 minutes, not sure if that is because of the mayo switch or not, but watch the time when you are baking this.

I was on a Thanksgiving bread making marathon and tried this recipe to use up some apples and other ingredients...and it was really good!  It was pretty sweet, but I liked it that way. I didn't add walnuts because I can't stand them. I'm going to try it again without the mayo and see what happens, because I have been craving this bread for a week!

I served this to about 10 people and all of them liked it.  This is a good breakfast bread that balances the "healthy" and "indulgent" sides of breakfast foods.  Next time I will try brushing the top with buttermilk and butter to enhance the crust.

I made this for Christmas gifts and it was a hit!  Delicious, too.  I used my Kitchen Aid Food processor to do the apples and it made fast work of a tedious chore.

Great!  Substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and chppoed pecans for the walnuts....could use chopped dates/peanuts too....DELICIOUS!!!!  I did add a little more flour (3 cups instead of 2) so the dough wasn't as runny.
