WE make a recipe like this at my work but instead of onions and tomatoes we put diced chicken on it. It's so delicious!!

Quick yummy lunch. Instead of using regular flour tortillas I used a spinach herb sandwich wrap... perfect!

I bought a packaged artichoke dip at the store that no one liked. Instead of tossing it, I recreated it with this. I used pizza crusts instead of tortilla. The family loved it. I don't think they ever realized the base was the same dip!
