This is a VERY good low sugar recipe.What I liked best about this one is most low sugar recipes tend to cut out fat as well making a very dry cake, this one did not.

I used 2 1/4 cups of All-purpose flour for this one, and decided to substitute the sugar substitution with (you guess it) granulated white sugar, and finally, replaced the cream of tartar with 1 1/2 teaspoons of vinegar. It's rather dense, and tends to go well with coffee or tea. The cinnamon and chocolate did actually come together well in the end. The recipe is however flawed, as there is no indication of where the flour mixture is to be added (I added it along with the cold water/vanilla). Of course, no cake is complete without icing-- so I used a maple-syrup-meringue one for sandwiching and covering. Very good indeed.

Awful. I have made a lot of cakes from scratch and this recipe is needlessly complex and didn't rise properly.  Not sure how it tastes but it looks so awful that I am not going to try it.  Go with a standard chocolate cake recipe (i.e better homes and gardens) and sub sucralose for sugar instead.

A good healthy choice recipe for diabetics, you can also play around with this switching the granulated sugar for the one cup of water using diet soda 7up pop for added sweetness. I used unbleached flour along with 3 eggs including the yolk. It leaned to more of a more dense brownie type cake. I topped off with cream sweetened with equal sugar substitute & vanilla & fresh strawberries. I got lots of thumbs up when served at my office.  (Maybe they were just being nice..but I liked it :)

I made this cake for our diabetic neighbor's 80th birthday party - he said it was one of the best desserts he's had.  Complicated to make and didn't really rise, but still good.  I'll try it again.

This cake had so much promise. My birthday boy liked it as he is pre-diabetic and trying to reduce sugars and carbs. It was dry and needed a topping. After the tricky, but not impossible steps it took to make, I am so glad that he likes it and doesn't want me to search out a low sugar/carb topping. I think it would be wonderful with a fresh strawberry compote.
