I cooked this hot wing recipe for the 2012 Super Bowl and they were gone before any other dish, my husband loved them so much that I am making them again tonight.

I DID change something, actually with out knowing. I put only 1 kind of hot sauce, it was a hot sauce with ghost chilis, but these wings came out SUPER hottt!!  My fianc√© was pleasantly surprised, he loves spicy hot food. Even though I could only eat half a wing, they were exactly what I was looking for my S.O. GREAT recipe!
