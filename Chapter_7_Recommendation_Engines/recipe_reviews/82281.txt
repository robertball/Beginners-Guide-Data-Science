This is great but I wanted to share two shortcuts that I use. One is that I sometimes use sugar cookie dough and other times I just use chessmen cookies. These are wonderful no matter what the base and no matter what the fruit! Thanks!

Very good! I used premade sugar cookies and topped with fresh blueberries and strawberries. I also waited to frost them until about two hours before serving. I was worried the cookie would get soggy. Iâ€™ll be making these again.

I also used store bought sugar cookie dough which made the process that much quicker. Tasted great! Very good frosting recipe - simple and delicious.

Loved this recipe!  May 2 year old and 5 year loved that I let choose whatever fruit they wanted to put on them:)  Also, I made real whipping cream instead of frozen whipped topping.  Donna
