The flavor was pretty good, but the amount filled my 8-inch springform pan only half way, so cake was too thin.  (I should have been suspicious when the recipe called for half the amount of cream cheese as others!) I will probably try it again, doubling the filling recipe.

I don't like leaving neutral or negative reviews - but when spending $10+ to make a dessert I think it's best to give honest reviews.

The best thing this recipe has going for it is the portion sizing. Its meant to be a small cheesecake because you really do not need more than a 1 inch sliver.

Now down to the specifics. The crust instructions call for too much. It ends up making a very thick crust - which was too overpowering in addition to the dense cheesecake.

The filling results in a fairly overpowering flavor (and I like flavor) - but it almost has a truffle consistency - rather than cheesecake.

Also - the cooking time. Hmmm ... well you just end up with overbaked edges and a semi-solid middle. I would recommend covering the edges with foil to combat this. 

I guess I was thinking it would be amazing like the submitter stated - but I don't agree. I doubt I would ever make this again. If you are a coffee lover than its worth a try.

I just want to let anyone know, that this does not really qualify as cheesecake. It is closer to a flourless chocolate cake. I am not sure what it would have tasted like had I followed the recipe exactly, but the only thing I changed was to substitute bakers chocolate for the semi-sweet. But it was not the flavor I had issues with. It was the texture. I have never seen a cheesecake with cornstarch in it, and think I will try to modify a conventional recipe to be mocha rather than try this again. But if you want to try it, the user who said it was not enough to fill an 8" pan was right. (Double the recipe in a 10" would be my advice) Also, if you bake it, and do not like it a room temp, microwave a slice for 30 seconds and it is pretty good.

This was an okay cheesecake, definitely not the best I've ever made. The recipe was rather vague about what kind of chocolate cookies to use. I put some Oreos in my food processor, and mixed it with butter as directed. When I baked it, the butter separarated from the cookies and I was left with a rock hard crust that could not be cut, and butter all over the bottom of my oven. On the positive side, I doubled the filling recipe as indicated by other reviewers, and I put it in a 10-inch pan instead of an 8-inch. This worked out very well. Everyone who ate the cheesecake said the taste was excellent. I felt the Kahlua taste could have been a little stronger, but it did taste good, despite basically having no crust. I'm pretty sure that I will not make this again.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and I find it to be extremely tasty.  I like the texture and the coffee taste and will keep making it and topping it off with fresh whipping cream.  Great recipe!

Looked pretty and had a good texture. Didn't have enough flavor or sweetness for me to try it again

I made this cheesecake for 25 People and used Kahlua as the coffee liquor .. I thought it was Beautiful and so did the guests I made it for. I even had to print the recipe out for a few .. Great tasting but yes not quite the texture (fluffiness) of a normal cheesecake.. I give it a 10/10
