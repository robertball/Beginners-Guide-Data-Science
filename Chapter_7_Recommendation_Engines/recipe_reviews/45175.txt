I made it exactly like the recipe called for and it was fabulous!  If you want to try something a little different, change the vodka for tequila, orange sherbet for lime sherbet and OJ for limeaid-Tastes like a strawberry margarita smoothie!  It's 95 degrees today and I don't even care!

Wasn't quite enough vodka to make me smile so I added 2 more oz. ;o) I also used a scoop of vanilla ice cream in place of one of the sherbet. Was very rich, sweet & refreshing & will be enjoyed over & over again. Thansk for a fun recipe!

So refreshing for a warm 4th of July out on the patio! It was like a combination orange smoothie/strawberry daiquiri. We used homemade Coconut Ice Cream (to which I added pineapple), from this site, in place of the sherbet and a little less vodka (not my favorite). I can see adding rum & pineapple juice instead and making a pina colada smoothie! Endless possibilities. Great recipe!

Yum! I just wanted a single fruity drink.

I tossed in a few strawberries, some ice, a sherbert pushup pop (ha!), a shot of vodka and some OJ.

Turned out great. Thanks!

This was really good. I wanted to get my husband to try something new, since he always just drinks those little pre-made Long Island Iced Tea bottles. He liked them alot. I did add two more ounces of vodka, since we have a highter tolerance for alcohol. He was able to have two or three and feel good. It was a nice, mellow buzz and he did not have a hangover in the morning. I'm crediting that to the dilution of the alcohol with a healthy ingredient, like orange juice. I could be wrong... but that is my guess. :) I even had one... Nice and tasty.

Every start of summer we have a "Girls night on the deck" party where each person brings the ingredients to make a drink to share with everyone and the recipe.  This drink was by far the hit of the party!  I followed the recipe exactly and although it was more liquid than slush, everyone loved it and every copy of the recipe I made was taken by the nights end.  Thanks for the drink idea!

These were pretty good.  I only had fresh strawberries so I sliced them and put them in the freezer, I also only had 12 oz of orange juice but kept everything else the same, it was fine but would probably be better with the full amount of orange juice.  I think maybe a bit more ice would be nice.

I loved this! I put two more ounces of vodka and then did the rest and just a little more ice to make it more slushy. It was perfect! Thanks for the recipe

I thought this was a fun recipe to make.  I used my magic bullet blender to make it...I didn't have any orange sherbet so I used vanilla ice cream and used 2 scoops instead of one, added a banana, fresh strawberries, and added more vodka.  It was delicous...very summer.  Thanks for sharing...I was looking for a good Vodka recipe to make. =)

A very easy, fun and versatile recipe! Since Iâ€™m not a fan of sherbet, I swapped it out with extra creamy vanilla ice cream.

So amazing! I use half the sherbet and add more to taste if I need it. Oh yes, without sherbet, I've used a soft frozen Minute Maid strawberry lemonade tube. The 4oz tube was perfect. If you like your drinks sweet then you'll want to use more. This was super refreshing and I just called my husband to hurry home from work and try these. Yum! The best drink on this site, for sure.

I stumbled upon this recipe this evening and having run around all day, did not want to go back out for OJ so made a few revisions.  Surprisingly, it was still exceptional!  I am also not a measurer; just threw together a concoction based on what I already had on-hand: orange sherbet, lemon sorbet, frozen strawberries, vodka, triple sec, grenadine and ice.  The combination is definitely a winner!  :)

I didn't have frozen strawberries so I used fresh thnking it wouldn not matter much.  Wrong!!  DON'T DO THAT.  We did not like this drink at all and I am sure that is the reason.  I am rating this 5 because everyone else did and if I had used the PROPER ingredients we probably would have too.

Loved it! Didn't put as much vodka in as called for. I think that it makes a really good smoothie without going overboard. Might try it for breakfast tomorrow w/o.
