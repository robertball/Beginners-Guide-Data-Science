I used this recipe as a springboard for a salad that I made for our state fair. I substituted seasoned rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar and left out the salt and seasonings and added 1 T. of sesame oil. I tossed it with napa cabbage and other Asian veggies and topped it with bay scallops sauteed in sesame oil. The salad won me a blue ribbon and a great signed cookbook and $150 stainless steel pan. Eternally grateful to Trishie for submitting it -geranium's mom

I did it!!! I made a recipe "as is" no tweaking. This dressing is great, I loved it with veggies and tonight I marinated chicken breasts in the dressing for 4 hrs then grilled them -delicious. Family loved it, my youngest DS said they tasted like Subways's teriyaki chicken (his fav so that is quite a compliment) Next I want to brush this on broiled broccoli.

What a great salad dressing. It really has the perfect balance of sweet and sour. These are the kind of recipes that make you want to eat your veggies! Thanks for the recipe, Trishie :)

Wow, it's amazing how a few simple ingredients can create such a fabulous salad dressing!  We LOVED this and will make again for sure!  Served alongside chicken marinaded in 'Absolutely Ultimate Marinade' from AR and it was a great meal.  Thanks Trishie!

I just finished making this recipe "as is."  If I were to make it again, I would substitute rice wine vinegar for the red wine vinegar (the red wine vinegar is too overpowering).  I would also increase the olive oil to make the dressing more "stable" & less runny.  The ratio of vinegar to oil in the original recipe is wrong.

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars....like another I found it to be bitter, so following the advise given I increased the hoisin and honey. I have gonna give it 5 based on assuming that after it marrys for a while it will be perfect!

Wow! Really good. I wasn't expecting that much flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. Such a snap to mix up, with ingredients you always have on hand. Thanks for a great recipe, Trishie!

This was delicious!! I did scale the recipe to 1 serving and added a bit more hoisin and honey.  Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, I cut down on the olive oil slightly and to finish, I added about 1/2 tsp of sesame oil and about 1 tsp of soy sauce.  The end result was absolutely delish!!

I don't know, I thought something was missing. I added 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of sesame seed oil and that seemed to do the trick. I like my changes so I make this again, all the ingredients are staples so it's a great go to dressing.

Very good dressing!  I love how quick and easy it is. I added toasted sesame seeds to my salad and with the dressing it was perfect!  I will be making this again.  Thanks Trishie.  :)

I made this this afternoon intending to let it sit for a while before use. After tasting it to check on seasonings, I literally couldn't wait to try it on a salad! Very, very good. I might try using some peanut oil next time for a variation. Thanks, Trishie!

I added lime juice and used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine per suggestions. I added more hoisin and used sesame oil for some of the olive oil. I put over a salad with chopped lettuce, cabbage and carrot. Very tasty and healthy. I added cilantro to both dressing and salad.

Yum! Used this on a Mixed Greens with Mandarins salad in place if the Thai Lime Vinaigrette dressing on that recipe - I did add a little squirt of lime juice.  I think I probably used a bit less oil, too, as I tend to like dressing on the vinegary side.  I'm trying to eat more salads with dinner and this dressing is wonderful to go along with spicy Thai noodles or other Asian main dishes.  Thanks, Trishie!

Excellent, thanks for the recipe! I don't think I've ever had Hoisin sauce before. I'm kind of a vinegar wimp, so I changed the oil/vinegar ratio just a bit.

Changed out red wine vinegar with seasoned rice vinegar and canola oil for the olive oil and this worked.

I don't know why it took me so long to make this! Loved it! The hoisin added a flavorful sweetness! Thanks, Trishie, I would definitely make this again!!
