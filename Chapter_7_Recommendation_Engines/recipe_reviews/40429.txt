These were so tasty! While not my ideal opinion of what "salisbury steak" tastes like, this, in some ways, was much better tasting! It has a tangy zip, from the excellent addition of tomatoes, and because it doesn't call for adding a mess of canned and powdered soup mixes, the rich taste of the meat really shines through. Really, these are fantastic! I browned my patties in a skillet before baking so that I could use the hearty drippings to make the sauce with. Just sauteeing a large onion and some diced mushrooms in the meat drippings, then adding water, cornstarch and some beef stock made the absolutely perfect complimentary sauce for these "steaks", and I look forward to making this again! It's nice to find recipes that don't require a bunch of processed and pre-packaged ingredients in them, too... canned breadcrumbs, powdered soup, etc.? That's not my idea of homestyle cooking! Nothing tastes better than healthy, from-scratch homemade food, and this recipe is a nice testimony to that!

I was excited to find a salisbury patty recipe that didn't have breadcrumbs or other carbs in it.  Thank you! I just used a gravy recipe from another submitter and this turned out GREAT.  Don't sweat the nasty reviewer below... she seems to leave nasty reviews in her wake wherever she goes. ;)

This is very good and fast. I didn't use ground pork, just the beef and they were great.

This was good but can't rate 5 stars because I made a few changes.  I used 1 lb. beef and 1/4 pound of ground sausage, used dried french fried onions in place of the diced onion.  I cooked in the of 350 for 40 minutes.  This recipe made 8 egg shaped patties.  We wanted gravy so we used the recipe from the other salisbury steak (subbed water with low sodium beef broth).

These were wonderful, and gluten-free and dairy-free! I didn't have any pork on hand so I just used burger and made a brown au jus gravy for the top (along with mashed potatoes YUM!)

Very tasty dish.  I, too, like the 'no breading' option.  I did make a couple of changes:  added Montreal Steak seasoning to the mix and simmered anaheim chili slices in au jus for the 'gravy'.    It got thumbs up in our household!

Very simple & tasty dish.  We substituted low sodium dry onion soup since that’s what we had on hand.  Because we used “dry” soup, we added approx. ½c water to the meat mixture.  As others suggested, we doubled the sauce to serve w/ mashed potatoes.  Will keep & make again.

We skipped the pork and used ground turkey instead.  

A really yummy sauciness was created during baking, so we scooped that over the steaks.  The tomato really made all the difference and provided some very juicy bites.  

This is a huge recipe, so we made the patties and froze them in batches.  

My toddlers enjoyed then for lunch with me the next week. 

So easy, but don't forget the seasonings as they are important to keep it from being bland.  Hubby would have preferred ground beef, but still liked them.

I made a scaled down recipe for 5 people. Used 1 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork. I omitted the tomato because I didn't have one, Used 1 egg, 1 tablespoon chopped garlic and 1/4 of a medium onion, salt and black pepper. I baked on a deep cookie sheet @350 for about 35 minutes, flipped them over halfway through. After it was fully cooked I transefered to a baking dish and covered with Pioneer brand brown gravy. Served with "Bellas rosemary red potatoes and biscuits. Yummmy!

I made these ahead and froze them- that part was great.  The family however was split- half LOVED these and the other half could take them or leave them.
Used all ground beef.

This was a family hit! I made a few adjustments. I only used 2lbs of beef, added 1 cup of ketchup, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/2 cup water and 1-1/2 teaspoon Lawry season salt. I made 9 patties and baked them in a glass dish @ 350 for 35 minutes.

Quick and easy... I added a little salsa in place of tomatoes because I didn't have any.  Husband ate it, but didn't rave or ask for it again.

My husband really loves this recipe, so I will make it again. I made some mushroom and onion gravy to go with it on top of rice. It turned out really good. Thanks.

This recipe just wasn't our taste; maybe it was just the tomatoes.  I will try again without the tomatoes, use less garlic, and add some other seasonings, like Cavender's and seasoned salt because I do like the idea that this recipe has no breadcrumbs.

I found this a teeny bit bland, but when I tried to spice it up the second time, my husband said he liked the orignal better--and he likes even spicier food than I do! This is easy and fast and is often requested at our house.

I would give this a 3.5 if I could.  A bit too salty even though I used low sodium soup.  Family ate it without complaint, but there were no compliments.  Will make rarely if ever.

WOW ~ what a great recipe!!  Really easy to make and perfect for an Atkin's friendly meal.  I made this with "Patty's Mashed Turnips" (also found on this sight).  A super low-carb dinner!!

Excellent recipe! I wonder if a little italian seasoning could turn these also into the perfect meatballs. The flavor is wonderful!
