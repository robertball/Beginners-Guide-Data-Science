I am not a big fan of cantaloupe. I had some leftover after making a fruit bouquet for a party. This was really good. It did not taste like cantaloupe was in it. It had more of a peach crisp taste. One thing I would do different is the amout of sugar. It was a bit too sweet for me. Will definately make again.

I had a few small rather bland cantaloupes from our garden to use up and this worked well. I cut them into small slices instead of cubes and used a little less than the 1/2 c sugar. In making this again I would certainly use less melted butter on top-maybe half?. The cantaloupe taste was well disguised (my husband guessed peach first) but not entirely absent, and the texture/appearance was quite nice.  I'd make it again.

This is so freakin' amazing!  I was skeptical at first, but it just came out of the oven, and oh my!!  It is on the (very) sweet side and as others have stated, does taste like peach cobbler.  Would be great with cool whip or ice cream.  Can't wait for the hubby to get home and try it.

After finding myself with large very ripe cantelopes, I needed to find a recipe that would use some of it up.  I came across this recipe, made it, and took it to a family function. Everyone loved it but they all guessed that it was peaches.  Lol.

1/3 cup lemon juice sounded like WAY too much to me, so I only used 2 tbsp.  An entire cake mix sounded insane, so I used about 1/4 of an orange cake mix on top.  I only used 1/2 stick lite butter total (1tbsp went in cantaloupe mix, the rest on top of cake mix). I used 1/3 c splenda and just a spoonful of sugar and it was plenty sweet enough. The flavor was amazingly better than I expected, and I agree that it was kind of like a peach cobbler.  Disguised the cantaloupe good enough which is what I was looking for because I was tired of eating cantaloupe.  The top didn't get crunchy at all though.  Next time, I would add some oatmeal to the topping, maybe some nuts, and maybe a different kind of cake mix as orange was a bit too articially sweet. This was a unique recipe and could be tweaked to be really good I think.

Can I give this more stars, PLEASE????
Followed the recipe exactly - it was done 15 minutes ahead of schedule, but that just might be my oven. Tastes like peach or apricot - you'd never guess it was cantaloupe!

My Husband does not generally like cantaloupe, which is why I tried this recipe. I wanted to find a way to eat the melon we had without just eating it plain. When my husband started eating this tonight he said, "This is the best way to eat Cantaloupe in the history of the Americas!" he loved it!

Only changes I made to the recipe were use more cantaloupe, and I didn't put the 2T butter in the filling.

Wow... this is so good! I was skeptical, first about baking cantaloupe, and then about adding cinnamon and nutmeg to cantaloupe. But I was very pleasantly surprised, and will be making this many more times! Made as written, except I used Splenda on the cantaloupe, and then only used about half of the cake mix on the top. Yummy!

I did not care for this.  The fruit tasted okay, but not great, but the topping was gluey and not good.

This is a delicious recipe!  I followed it EXACTLY as written, using the exact amounts of ingredients called for, and I was totally pleased.  Will definitely make again... perfect for leftover cantaloupe!  My family (including kids) loved it!

I wanted to use my ripe cantaloupe and made this as well as the Cantaloupe Bread with Praline Glaze from this site. No one could tell that cantaloupe was the fruit--the seasonings over powered the fruit. Many thought it was a peach cobbler. In the end, I was asked to make the Cantaloupe Bread with Praline Glaze again but not this...sorry. It was edible but not great.

My garden is producing too much cantaloupe. This is very good.  Crunchy, just the right amount of sweetness.  Only change I would make is just a tad more cantaloupe - maybe 1/2 cup more.

Not a huge cantaloupe fan, but this is awesome!  Had 2 over ripe cantaloupes about ready to toss, so I thought I would try this...  The household was very happy about this one!

Suprisingly good!  I don't care for cantaloupe, but I absolutely loved this recipe!  I made a 1/2 batch just to try it out.  It was so delicious!  It does not taste like canteloupe at all!  I am making a full bath to bring over to my parents' house for Mother's Day dinner.  I am sure it will be a big hit!

Family loved taste like a peach cobbler. Didn't use cake mix. I had oatmeal bar cookie mix . Mix it according except for the jelly. Anyway divided the mixture in 1/2 placed in pie plate then cantaloupe mixture then rest of bar mix. Will make again since I still have cantaloupe but use less sugar it was a little to sweet which probably depends on the fruit

A great way to use ripe cantaloupe. I made according to recipe but to the cake mix I added about a 1/4 cup sliced almond to add a little crunch. Doesn't taste like cantaloupe, more like peach crisp to me. My husband thinks it taste like apple pie. If I have a lot of cantaloupe again I would make this.

I followed the recipe exactly but it wasn't golden brown at 45 minutes so I cooked it an hour. The butter wasn't enough to make a crust with the cake mix on top and it was both soggy and had pockets of cake mix in it (which is what I expected to happen, honestly, but I wanted to follow the recipe correctly.) I cut the cantaloupe pretty small and it still had way too much of that definitive cantaloupe flavor except for a few pieces which were pretty small. The texture of the cantaloupe was really off-putting in combination with the rest of it. Maybe cooking very small pieces of cantaloupe in the sugar and spice and butter mixture might make this better, as well as actually making some sort of dump cake or cobbler crust for it. As it stands, this recipe is definitely not something I would ever make again, it's going in the trash and I never waste food. Please don't let the positive reviews fool you; this was horrible.

This was SO good!  And I don't even like cantaloupe!!! Just follow the directions and it tastes like a peach cobbler - I couldn't believe it! I had cantaloupe left over from a fruit basket and didn't want to toss it, so I took a chance.  I was really skeptical at first, hot cantaloupe??? Really? But when it came out of the oven, wow, it smells great.  Just add whipped cream!!!

The reviews are correct...it's definitely hard to tell this was cantaloupe as there was no melon flavor...at all.  Good thing in my book.  Make sure you taste your melon and adjust your sugar amount...I did not add any extra sugar since my melon was naturally sweet and with the cake mix it was really still too sweet for my liking.  Everyone who tired this raved.  I won't use this recipe again but it has inspired me to create my own without using a box mix so I can control the sweetness.  Another suggestion, make sure your melted butter covers the entire cake mix top or you will have powdery spots.  Maybe use more than 1/2 cup melted butter or spread it out with a spatula after you drizzle it over the top

This was good, but I did some altering after reading reviews: cut the sugar to 1/3 c. and the cake mix to 1/2 a box [used Jiffy yellow cake, 9 oz]. It was still VERY sweet. Also, I cut the topping butter to 1/4 c. I added 1 c. more melon, 1 more Tbs. of lemon, and 2 more Tbs. w.w. flour.  I'm glad I did, as there would have been very little runny fruit and mostly cake mix topping. 
At first it had a faint peach flavor. The next day it did not, but was still tasty.  Hubby, who dislikes cantaloupe, didn't like it. But he was prejudiced ahead of time knowing cantaloupe was in there.

We couldn't get past the smell of it cooking. Tried it when it was finished and all you could taste was the cake mix no flavour with the cantaloup. VERY disappointing Next time I will try peaches and only 1/2 the box of cake mix.

With a little tweaking this recipe could be great!  It was waaay too sweet for me.  Next time I would add half the butter and sugar and twice the cantaloupe.  The crunchy topping was really nice.

Only had 2 lemons so I didn't have a full 1/3 cup juice. Also, hubbie is a diabetic so I used 1/4 c turbinado sugar for the full cup sugar. I also only used 1/2 of a yellow cake mix. We really liked it!
