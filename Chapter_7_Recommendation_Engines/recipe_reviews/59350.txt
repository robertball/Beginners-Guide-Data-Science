This particular Red Flannel Hash recipe was in my opinion, tasty but incomplete.  

The first time I ever had traditional New England Red Flannel Hash or "Velvet Hash" as some called it, was prepared by my husband's paternal grandmother.  Both she and her mother pepared this unique and colorful recipe with all the leftover vegetables and ham from the traditional New England Boiled Dinner.  The potatoes, carrots, turnip, cabbage and ham along with beets and onions, were ground altogether through a meat grinder and fried with butter in a cast iron skillet.  The condiment of choice was vinegar that was sprinkled on top for those that enjoyed that flavor. 

This recipe brings back many memories and the flavors are vivid reminders of living in the simple life in the country.

My Grampa used to make this, adding finely shredded leftover roast beef to the hash to make a colorful, delicious meal.  Quick, easy, and delicious!

For such simple ingredients, this was very, very good. I used fresh beets, purple potatoes, and olive oil. The vinegar adds so much flavor without being overpowering. I'll definitely make this again--next time, I'll sautee some onions and add them to the mix.

My husband didn't like beets until I tried this recipe.  Now he requests it specifically.  I added a beaten egg and 2 T. flour to make it hold together a bit better. If I have them, I'll add a turnip and some onion.  It makes a great side for a meatloaf.

My husband's boss goes to Nantucket for the entire month of August, just as his vegetable garden is kicking into high gear...so we ended up with a boat load of potatoes and beets and I needed to find a quick way to use them. I was so happy when I came across this recipe. So my only change was to use fresh beets instead of canned. I loved the crust that it formed on the bottom from the butter, yum! Was a perfect compliment to the ham slices and baked beans I served it with. Next time I might add carrots and onions as another reviewer had mentioned as well as a couple tablespoons of milk to keep it moist as it is browning. Thank you TiredMom of Six for sharing this recipe.

This is a great way to add some color to the dinner table. The combination of the beets, potatoes, and vinegar is excellent, and will certainly please even beet haters.

This was fine as far as it went, but I grew up putting a can of corned beef with the beets and potatoes. That is delicious.

I canned beets yesterday and had a few leftover.  This recipe was a good way to use them up.  I added a little onion powder and omitted the vinegar.  Husband and I agree....delicious!  thank you for posting.

My mother and father were from New England and Red Flannel Hash was one of the items I remember as being a favorite dish.  I never knew it was a New England recipe until I talked about it to friends after having suddenly pulled it up from my subconscious mind.  I had not eaten it in decades but one day there were both mashed potatoes and beets left over after dinner.  Aha! I thought, I will make Red Flannel Hash.  Everyone at my table made a grunt and a grimace.  That's how I found out that this is not a common Texas dish.  

My mother never just fixed it from scratch - it was always just a way to use left overs.  And she never added anything to the beets and potatoes - just butter to the frying pan to heat it up.  I still love it that way.  Some day I am going to fix enough of it to bring a serving dish to the dining room table and ask my Texas friends to "just try it one time!"
