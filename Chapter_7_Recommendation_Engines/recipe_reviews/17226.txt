I made this for a couple of friends and they loved it!!  However, I made a few changes and used a graham cracker crust instead of the toast.  Also, I didn't have any marshmallows or frozen whipped topping on hand, so I used about a half cup of "Reddi-Whip" and added it to the cream cheese and sugar.  Yum.
