I thought I was going to hate it.  Because I tasted it when it first came out of the blender and all I could taste was the tofu.  I let it chill overnight and then ate half of it the next morning because it was so good!  It did remind me of mousse or even ice cream!  I added a little bit more milk to it because I was having trouble mixing it in the blender.  I also added a tablespoon of peanut butter and a packet of splenda and equal.  I used 3/4 cup
chocolate chips because I had 14oz of tofu.

I wasn't expecting much from pudding made with tofu, but tried it because my daughter had a milk allergy... and it was really good!  I use silken tofu, and I think the pudding tastes like chocolate mousse, so that's what I tell people I'm serving.  They're always surprised when they find out it had tofu in it! :)

This is not that good.  You can taste the tofu.  I added a 1/2 c. to get rid of the tofu taste and it barely helped.  I won't make this again.

Excellent! Even my husband loved it, and he's very picky! I used a 12 oz block of silken firm tofu, 1 cup of semi sweet choc. chips, 1.5 tbsp water with 1 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp very vanilla soy milk, and 1 tbsp creme de cacao. I only had about 1/4 tsp vanilla extract left, so that's all I used. I blended the tofu in a food processor with the liqueur. Then I added the chocolate, melted with all the other ingredients. I blended until it was REALLY smooth. I refrigerated the whole thing for 4 hours. Thanks!

I loved this pudding! I used soft tofu instead of firm, and the texture was fantastic! (It was kind of like a mousse) No one could tell that this was made with tofu, and everyone who tried gobbled it up. I will definitely make this again, but I might try using milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

I tried this last night in my blender and it worked fine - just had to stop and stir with a spatula a few times. It's true that it tastes funny if you eat it right away. Make sure to give it plenty of time to chill. I'd say 24 hours would be ideal. Then top with some whipped cream and oh boy! We had the bowl licked clean. My husband is suggesting increasing the chocolate content a bit and I agree. I also took the suggestion of adding 3 tbsp of sugar to the original recipe. This recipe is my first attempt at using block tofu and I will be using it again soon.

LOVE IT ! This is actually the first "tofu recipe" that I have ever made. I melted my chocolate in the microwave. It didn't melt completely, so you got tiny bits of chocolate in every bite. My kids loved it with a nondairy "cool whip" type topping. Also good with a couple of sliced strawberries on top as well. 
Thanks so much for submitting this recipe, it's wonderful.

FANTASTIC! Wonderful texture and taste; a pudding that you need not feel guilty about eating the entire bowl, as you're gobbling up all those healthy isoflavins.  I think I'm gonna try it with Butterscotch Chips (or maybe even Carob) and see if it turns out as good as the chocolate. Thanks again for a super, low-lactose yummy pudding...methinks I'll make some more.....

Wonderful recipe!  I added 3 tsp. Splenda (sugar would work too) to make it just a little sweeter.  I topped each serving with whipped cream, mini chocolate chips and a few frozen raspberries.  It was a hit for dessert & so easy with the food processor.  I will make this often! Thanks Deda!  :o)

I received a coupon for a free package of firm tofu, and found this recipe, (as well as website), while doing an online search.
I'm a newbie to tofu, and I found the pudding to be quick, easy, and very "authentic" tasting! (It reminded me a little of brownie batter). 
I also happened to have all the ingredients, including some leftover chocolate chips, right in my kitchen. It worked out great!

I tried this recipe in an attempt to get my chocoholic (dairy sensitive) toddler to consume a little more protein today, and it worked! I liked it too, but I'm Polynesian and can eat the whole block of tofu plain. I added a little agave syrup (natural sweetener like honey) because I like things a little sweeter. Next time I might try this in my blender in two batches because it was a lot to put in at once and a little difficult to blend to the creamy smoothness I wanted.

This pudding is wonderful.....I added 3 packs of Splenda for a little extra sweetness and a tsp. of apple cider vinegar.    Serve this with fat free Cool Whip and you have a very healthy, delicious dessert.    PS.......I tried 1 tsp. raspberry vinegar instead of the apple cider and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!

This is a pretty good recipe.  Once everything is blended, it definitely needs to be allowed to chill for quite some time for the tofu to take on the flavor of the chocolate and lose the tofu taste.  I did add four single packets of turbinado sugar, a spoonful of peanut butter and used vanilla soy milk.  Also, used silken tofu upon reviewing other similar vegan recipes.   Again, make sure you allow this to chill overnight or for at least 4-5 hours before serving!!!

This was great. It reminds me of a Frostie (R).  I put it in the meat drawer so it would get really cold. That helped.  When I made it I just melted the chocolate in the microwave in a glass 2 cup measure.  I also put just under 1 T vanilla. A whole T seemed like alot. Next time I will use the whole T and see how that tasts. I have been trying to get Tofu in mine and my childrens diet and this was great. Now I don't have to worry if all they want is there Veggi and fruit and then this for dessert. There is enough protien to eliminate the meat that I usually serve at each meal. I also loved how there is no need to add sugar.  Thank you for submitting this

Delicious!  I think I have a new way to sneak some protein into my girls' diets!  Also a nice use for my "almost too old" tofu!  Delicious! I had a hard time waiting an hour to eat, so I ate it right away.  :)

I thought this was excellent.  It was so quick and easy to make.  The third time I made it, I put it in a graham cracker crust. I think it will also make a great filling for cream puffs.

I used the regular tofu from the supermarket (not silken because they didn't have) I think that perhaps I need to use a very fine blender because the tofu was too 'seedy' which is probably my fault. I used sugarless dark chocolate but had to make up for it with splenda. I also used rice milk instead of regular milk. I was trying to make something cool for my father in law but I'm scared to serve it. My son absolutely loved it and licked out the bowl. So in any event my son will have a healthy dessert which is thrilling. I will try again definitely with a mixer that will finely blend it.

I tried this recipe using Extra Firm tofu and it was pretty good for "health food!"  I found it to be more similar to mousse rather than pudding or brownie batter as one reviewer suggested.  I definitely recommend a food processor over a blender as my $100 Waring was very bogged down with it.  I will definitely experiment with this recipe again, trying less firm tofu.

I made this last night and it is GOOD. Very 
chocolaty and smooth flavor.  I used soy milk,
but you could use real milk. It is a very light
and fluffy pudding, texture is great.  We 
added whip cream on top!  Super simple to 
make and easy.  We'll be making this again 
and again! Thanks, Jenni, for your recipe!

Awesome.  I added a bit of coffee, 2 tsps vanilla, 2 tsps honey and a bit of sugar in the raw.  it's amazing and unless you tell someone it's tofu, noone will ever know.  Mmmmm...HIGHLY Recommend.

I'm guessing that the people who said the tofu taste was too strong didn't use the silken kind.  That's the most important part to making it taste good, though easy to overlook if you are not familiar with tofu.  If you use the regular kind, like you would use for grilling, the texture and flavor will not be very good at all.  I used a soft silken tofu, like some other reviewers.  I also used chocolate soy milk and only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Delicious!  It definitely has a distinct flavor that you would not find in regular dairy pudding, but it isn't a bad flavor at all.  Definitely worth trying.

I really don't eat much tofu- but I tried this with "Dark" chocolate chips, ans "Silken" tofu. It was EXCELLENT- I processed it until creamy and there is no weird soy taste! my non-veg family loved it too. I only chilled for an hour.

Good stuff!
So easy too!
I used dark chocolate chips and a little dark premium chocolate.
It wasn't sweet enough for my teen boys, but too bad for them, more for me ;-)
I have made this a few times now(luv it).
This time I did 70% chocolate and added 1/4 cup nutella(needed more soya), would do again!

Good stuff! Sets really well in the fridge. I used normal tradditional chinese tofu that my mom bought. Just had a cup and its delish. I added two packets of Fructose for sweetness and used chocolate soy milk. I think I added too much chocolate or something cuz there was a slight bitter after taste. I honestly can't tell it's made from tofu but there is a very very slight aftertaste of soy. I only noticed it cuz I was looking out for tofu taste. Great texture. Maybe I'll play with the flavours and try lemon juice for a lemon pudding instead of chocolate or use coco powder and a sugar substitute to cut down the calories. Will make again!

Excellent recipe!  I used Milk Chocolate Morsels, and 2 packets of Splenda (a sugar substitute) for a little extra sweetness.  A few "musts":  1. Use Silken Tofu; 2. After mixing all ingredients with your mixer, use a stick blender to emulsify and make it extra creamy; 3. Chill overnight to set and let flavors blend.  I'm going to try it with Butterscotch Morsels next!  A super recipe--especially for our lactose-intolerant loved ones.  Thanks, Jenni!

You can't quite forget it's tofu, but it's not too bad for a guilt free dessert. No luck on getting the husband to eat it tho. :)

Pretty good, really easy.  I halved the recipe to use up a half a brick of tofu left over from a stir-fry.  I'm sure you could do a lot with this recipe by adding different flavors either with light vinegar or liqueurs.  With a touch of raspberry, I might even use this as the filling in a vegan cake.

This was so easy and fast! Great tasty recipe. I did change a few things, I took another reviewers suggestion of adding more chocolate chips, so I added 1 1/2 cups, and 1 tablespoon of coconut sugar. Instead of soy milk I had almond milk and honestly I forgot to add the vanila extract and it still came out great!!.

This is Sooo Good!  I make it on a regular basis with the silken tofu.  Sometimes I add a tsp of Cinnamon to give it a little different flavor

This recipe is our new favorite! I read the reviews before making it the first time and decided to make a few adjustments before trying it. First, decided to double the recipe, so used one silken tofu and one soft tofu. Used chocolate soy milk for a double chocolate flavor as well as increased it to 3/4 cup for the double recipe. Also used organic chocolate chips...yes, found a difference in the flavor, much better. The little bit of extra sweetness in the chocolate soy milk seemed like the perfect little bit of extra sweet for the recipe. It certainly was for us. To keep the recipe healthy, a bit of agave or stevia could be added if needed, however our friends and us LOVE this as it is now!! Have made it this way many times since in our Vita-Mix blender in less than 10 mins and have some in the fridge right now. Very runny when first made, but thickens up quickly and flavors meld within a few hours. Has a mousse like texture and could be served in a 5 star restaurant.

Tofu is a fantastic ingredient when used right, but it can also be a disaster. This recipe definetly uses it right and is the best pudding I have ever made. It has perfect chocolate flavor and a smooth consistency.

I made this with firm tofu, but next time I will use silken as the pudding turned out VERY thick and mousse-like.

It is much better tasting the second day, and reminds me of chocolate ice cream! :)

Made with silken tofu the pudding is much creamier, and still just as good as when I made it with firm tofu.

Remember you are using tofu so it is going to have that tofu taste.  You can't expect it to taste like real chocolate pudding.  But it's still really good.  My kids and husband really liked it.  Tip:  If you use soft tofu you get a smoother texture and if you chill it overnight it has a better taste.

I used firm tofu and found the pudding to be grainy--and not sweet enough even after adding some honey.

My 1st experience with silken tofu--WOW.  This is great.  I love dark chocolate and went for the whole cup of chocolate chips...I was not disappointed.  It's a keeper.

I've come to actually like tofu, but even I would not use firm tofu for this recipe - definitely use silken and you will not be disappointed!  One note - when I blended the chocolate into the tofu I think my tofu was too cold as bits of chocolate solidified.  So I just returned the whole thing to the double boiler and cooked it down a bit til the chocolate melted.  My grocery store's going to have order twice as much silken tofu now....

A great recipe! Like many other reviewers I suggest you use Silken Tofu (I like Mori-Nu). The first time I made it I did not and it did not come out good, but the second time it came out delicious and smooth. Also, a whole cup of chips may be too much for some people so I would mix to taste. But overall a very good treat that does not make you feel guilty for indulging.

This was surprisingly not bad.  Like another reviewer said, you can't really forget that it's tofu, but I don't mind the flavour of tofu so it didn't bother me.  It does have chocolate in it, which has a lot of fat and calories, but it's still pretty healthy because of all the soy protein.  Also, you don't have to add any sugar, so that's a plus.

I really liked the texture of this pudding- very creamy (I used soft tofu). However, I felt the tofu taste was still very strong, better after 24 hours, but next time I will try using twice as much chocolate, maybe a little sugar. The 2-year old I nanny for really liked it, though!

You can definitely still taste the tofu, but much less so after you chill it for at least 2 hours.  I used silken tofu instead of firm and the texture was a cross between pudding and mousse- not bad!  I made it low carb by using sugar-free dark chocolate.  Overall, pretty good considering it's healthy, easy and in my case, very low in carbs.  Give it a try!

How fun was this? Yes, it was more like a moose than a pudding but great nontheless.  I will make again and maybe spruce it up with a quick graham cracker bottom or like another viewer mentioned, some different flavor chips.  Thank you for such a great dessert recipe I can give to my vege guests.

This was delicious!  I did make some small changes though: I used almond milk instead of soy (it's what I had) and I used brewed coffee in place of the water to enhance the chocolate flavor. I also had a 14oz block of tofu but still used the full cup of chocolate chips.  I did need to add some extra milk for it to blend well, I didn't measure though so I don't know how much.  After reading reviews I made it in advance so it could sit overnight, I did taste it right after blending and the tofu flavor is still pretty strong (I thought it was still tasty though).  After it sat overnight the tofu flavor is almost non-existent.  I would highly recommend tasting it before adding any additional sweetener.  I almost added some honey from the get-go since so many other reviewers said they added sweetener, but I am so glad I didn't!  To me it was plenty sweet as is.  I did use firm tofu like the recipe calls for since that's what I had on hand & blended it until it looked completely smooth.  It does still have a slightly grainy texture but to me it isn't off-putting.  Next time I think I will try it with silken tofu but it's still wonderful with the firm kind.

Interesting.  This definitely needs sugar in my opinion.  I was going to add some but forgot, so we added a bit of Splenda at the table and it was so much better with a little sweetener--whatever your preference is.  Bf wasn't impressed and quizzed me what was in it; he wasn't sure what he didn't like, but he didn't like something.  I'm guessing it probably was the tofu . . .he's very rigid about not liking tofu.  All in all, not too bad if you like chocolate (I'm not always a huge fan) and don't mind trying different things.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I only had silken tofu, so used it instead of firm.  I left out the water and soy milk because it seemed to blend up to the right consistency without them.  I also used the Ghiradelli baking chips (60% cacao) that I had on hand, so added about 2 tbsp of light agave nectar for a little more sweetness.  It tastes great- you would never know there is tofu hidden in there!

I tried this recipe with skim milk. Put 1/2 cup instead and used less tofu than required (about 12oz). No water in my recipe and no vanilla extract.

My first thought was hm.. this does not look dark enough. The picture doesn't show a dark color either so I guess it was ok. Also, it was too thick for my taste and I could still taste the tofu. I added one packed of equal sweet and that made it slightly better. 

I also later added more milk and just stirred to a melted ice cream consistency and it was OK. I do like it it satisfies my chocolate cravings AND makes me full but it's packed on calories IMO. One serving is too little I need at least two servings because one serving is just a few spoonfuls. Still a good recipe thanks!!

I used firm instead of silken-so it was chalky.  I had to add extra milk to get it blended and extra powdered sugar too.  My mistake.  Looked good.  Will try again with silken.

The idea is great, but I think for someone to like this dish, they would have to love Tofu. I tried it, excited that this was a new dish with chocolate, and that it had tofu (healthy stuff, but never tried it before, besides in Asian cooking). Reviews were great too, but the tofu flavor was strong and not for me.

This was just OK.  I was disappointed after reading all of the rave reviews.  You could totally taste the tofu.  I made it for my two year old, though, because she is so picky and I am trying to figure out how to get more protein in her.  She loved it so I guess I would say give it a try if you have a picky toddler.  Other than that I wouldn't serve it.  I did add two packets of splenda to sweeten it up a little bit.

Very different.....  I was looking for something different to do with a package of firm tofu.  The only thing I did differently was add a tbsp of Irish Creme liquer to it.  I think next time I do this I'll use silken tofu.  The texture is a little..... strange... with plain firm tofu, kind of grainy.

This recipe MUST be done in a blender or food processor - I learned the hard way that beaters just don't cut it. Also, I added a tabelspoon each of unsweetened cocoa powder and sugar to increase the chocolate flavor.

This is my first try at using tofu in anything, and I thought it was great.  I added two splenda right from the start, and blended it well.  I will try it on my husband tonight and see if he even notices a difference.

OMG!  This was amazing. My husband and I are dieting and I was looking for interesting desserts we could eat, and found this.  I new I would probably enjoy it as I'm a vegetarian.  but my husband (who definitely is NOT vegetarian) couldn't stop raving about it, even asked to bring some leftovers to work.  I did use light silken tofu, but otherwise no changes, threw it all in my cuisinart and blended put it into two corning bowls and put it in the fridge before dinner, by the time we were done and ready it was Perfect!! will definitely make again.

I added some agave syrup to make it a little sweeter.  Also added some whole chocolate chips after blending.  This seems to get better the longer it sits in the fridge.  I had it yesterday after cooling for 4 hours and could still taste some tofu.  Today after 24 hours, the tofu taste was gone.

This is really delicious.  I used silken tofu, a few more chocolate chips and a tablespoon of brown sugar because I wasn't sure if it would be sweet enough. It was actually more sweet than I would like, so I won't add the extra sugar and chocolate next time. Like other posters have said, the texture is very mousse-like with the silken tofu. I let it set overnight and it didn't have any tofu taste, to me. Will try again, next time with pureed bananas.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Use silken tofu instead and you will see a huge difference. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for firm tofu. Also try adding 1 tblsp of brandy to cover some of the taste of the tofu.  It works wonders.  Happy cooking!!!

Not sure what went wrong, but after the pudding cooled, there was a gritty texture (and it wasn't there straight out of the blender).  I LOVE tofu and I used really good quality chocolate, and I was extremely careful not to burn it.  I did manage to rescue it by adding orange extract and making them into popcicles.  As popcicles they were great!

I added honey because I found this not nearly sweet enough.  Even then, though it wasn't bad, it was just lacking something.

Really good.  I used silken tofu too & needed no water & a little less milk.  I thought it wouldn't be sweet enough, but it was perfect.

First off, if you hate tofu, tofu pudding probably won't be your thing either.    This is my second time reviewing this recipe.  The first time I used the firm tofu and never did end up with a smooth creamy texture, the flavor was mostly tofu-ish and very chalky.  This time around however, I used silken tofu.  It blended perfectly smooth and creamy and had an ever so subtle taste of tofu, but barely noticeable.  For those of you considering this recipe, I highly recommend using silken tofu and blending well in a food processor for best results.

This is pretty good, but I used the soft tofu instead. It mixes up much creamier. So because of the change, I didn't give 5 stars.

Very tasty.  I inherited some tofu that I had to use up.  I was working with 1/2 a loaf of tofu, but used the same amount of chips used for the full loaf.  This is a wonderful  dessert.  You can't even taste the tofu.  You can vary the flavor by using different chips.  I used white chocolate.

I didn't use the chocolate, added 1/4tsp of cinnamon,  and 3 tablespoons of Splenda. It was still a little bland. Put some frozen raspberries and pecans and it was amazing. This recipe is great though because the texture is very creamy and is very malleable to changes.

I am eating this delish dessert right now! it was so easy to make and I don't mind that light tofu taste at all. I substituted dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet milk chocolate, and vanilla soymilk for skim. This is definatley one of my favorite sweet treats! I am just starting to become a vegetarian, so its great to have something quick and easy to whip up with tofu

I thought this was okay, and I probably would not make it again.  I used a soft silken tofu and added two packets of  Splenda for sweetness (which it needed).  The tofu flavor definitely stands out (even after chilling for 24 hours), but for those who aren't very familiar with tofu, it would be hard for them to identify the source of the unusual taste; all in all, if you did not tell anyone, I think you could get away with serving it and having them think it's a mousse with a dark, complex flavor (when I served it, people guessed that it had a liqueur in it).

Sorry, no one really liked this recipe in our house.  Had a funny aftertaste, though whipped cream helped it a lot.  I followed the recipe to a T but ours was kind of runny.  The chocolate chips add a lot of fat and calories.  I guess this would be a good recipe for people who are lactose intolerant though!

I'm not a chocolate fan but the household is. I had a 12 oz package of silken tofu so adjusted ingredients to accommodate and used vanilla soy milk. It turned out very tasty and similar to regular choco pudding. I added less vanilla because of the vanilla soy milk, but added a bit of salt to boost the sweetness! thank you jenni
will do again

I had tofu to use up and found this recipe.  It was amazing!  I ate some of it right out of the blender.   I think the key was blending it for a very long time.  Probably a couple of minutes.  The longer I went, I watched the consistency get creamier and creamier.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract just because I like that.

Made a blend of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips, plus added a tbl of natural unsweetened baking cocoa. Added tsp of coconut sugar, 1 tbl brown sugar and used 2% organic milk (instead of the soy milk). I was raised on tofu so I knew I would like it, really did not think my grandkids would, but they loved it! I think the add'l sugars plus the darker chocolate did the trick.

Use SILKEN tofu. It make a huge difference. Not sure why this calls for firm as it makes the pudding chalky. I used dark chocolate and added protein powder. Delicious!

A good alternative for vegans.  I tried this pudding a couple hours after cooling and was disappointed.  However, a day or two later it tasted much better to me.  Either I had adjusted or the flavor benefited from time.  I took another members suggestion to increase chocolate chips by a 1/2 cup.  Not sure if this helped or not.

This recipe has become a favorite of mine! I have been using a smaller block of silken firm tofu (12 oz) and upping the soy milk to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4. For me, this makes the best consistency. I'm experimenting tonight with dark chocolate chips and skim milk instead of soy, we'll see how it goes!

I love Tofu..but I didn't like this at all. I even added more chocolate and it still tasted like tofu.

Really yummy but I tweeked it a bit:
Add an additional 4 oz of bittersweet chocolate.
Replace milk with espresso (I used decaf) and add a little extra.
Add sweetener of choice ( I added about 2 Tbs of Agave syrup).
Add about 1/4 tsp. salt

My kids don't like tofu but they loved this!  It's pretty intense in the chocolate dep't.

Since I like tofu I had a non-tofu eater try it..she said it was good, tasted just like choc pudding except healthier. I am not a choc pudding fan but thought this was exceptional. Will make again and again.

I am editing this up to 5 stars.  It was good right out of the blender...but it was fabulous once chilled.  We served it with soyatoo whip.  We all loved this!  We don't eat refined sugar so I used grain sweetened chocolate chips and sustituted agave for the water, just to add a bit of sweetness.  Great recipe!  Thank you.

This was surprisingly good. I used soft tofu for a smoother texture. But I made the mistake of adding extra chocolate chips because a couple of people said it wasn't sweet enough. What I wound up with was a frosting like texture that was extremely chocolaty and a little too sweet. I wish I had followed the recipe instead of adding the extra chocolate. But it was still very good the way I made it and even my roommate enjoyed it.

It was an interesting and a very healthy recipe, but it just tasted like tofu and chocolate. The taste of the tofu was too strong for me. Perhaps I can add more vanilla extract and chocolate chips in order to vanish the tofu flavour. However, they tasted better next day. the less tofu flavour I tasted and the more chocolate flavour I got.

I thought this was pretty good. I hardly ever follow recipes as written, so I added about 1 T of butter and used silken tofu and chocolate soy milk. Very good substitute for milk based choc. pudding. Kids loved it!

YUM! I have only cooked with tofu a couple of times even though I am a vegetarian and thought I would give this a try to use up a half of a box. I used Chocolate Rice Dream milk instead and this was super yummy!!!

I used the soft Tofu, soy milk and some 70% cocoa chocolate left over from Christmas.  It tasted really good.  Unfortunatly for me the combo of soy products and chocolate gave me a migraine (my fault for not recognising it).  It was almost worth it.

I thought it tasted really good...  It took a while mixing till it came out nice and smooth but it is well worth the time.
Thanks for the Recipe!

YUM!!!  I substituted almond extract (only half the amount) for the vanilla because I was out.  So good!  Very quick to make, great texture and great taste!

I was so surprised by the wonderful mousse like texture of this pudding! the taste of tofu was a little strong but it was still great. As a fun note, if you're also making the Vegan Chocolate Cake, try using dark semi-sweet baking chocolate instead of the chocolate chips and it'll make a great topping for the cake.
