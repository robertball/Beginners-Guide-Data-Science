I was looking for something that was easy enough to make after a long day at work, yet still tasted great.  This definitely fit the bill!!!  I love the brown sugar/soy sauce combination - it's like a kicked up version of the same ol' teriyaki or something!!!  And, I just marinaded it before work (9 am) and then cooked it up at 6.  Dinner was served by 6:45.  Easy breezy!!!  Thanks Lisa!  :)

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the suggested cooking method.    In my experience, baking meats uncovered = dry tough meat.  :(  Especially without any marinade to soak around in!!!

The secret, if you don't already know it, is the sear the chops on each side (time depends on how thick the chops are), then baking it COVERED on low heat (I used 350) WITH the marinade for 20 minutes (I used 3/4 inch thick bone-in chops).  The picture to the left is the fruit of my "labor".  :)  Me and my hubby started gnawing on the bone it was so good!

Very Good! Moist and Tender. I used thick chops, so I baked them about 1 hour and I covered them to help keep them moist. A nice easy recipe that tasted great.

Absolutely loved this recipe! It was extremely easy and very good! I did cover the meat with tin foil while baking though - i wanted the meat to stay juicy.  My fiance raved about it and thinks i spent a long time in the kitchen to make such a "great dinner" - i would never tell him it only took 5 minutes to mix the marinade and 2 minutes to put it in the oven!! :)

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was excellent.  I added a tiny bit of orange juice to the marinade.  I then followed another reviewers step of searing the pork chops, then putting them in a covered dish in the oven for 20 min.  Very tasty.

Excellent grilled!  I didn't crush the rosemary enough the first time, but the second time I did, and really enjoyed the flavor!  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I'm not generally a fan of marinades, but this one was very good.  The rosemary and soy sauce were both subtle; a good thing in my book.  Still, just a little on the salty side...

I made this on Mother's Day and used a pork loin and cooked it in an oven bag after it had been marinated overnight. It was so easy and a HUGE hit! I will be doing this again. I served it with oven roasted veggies...so good!

I used thin-cut pork chops and they ended up too salty, and the rosemary was a bit strong. I had to finish the pork chops myself the rest of the week because my husband didn't want anymore after the first serving. Maybe these would be better with thicker chops, but I did not like the scent or taste enough to try again. Thanks for sharing.

I haven't cooked with rosemary much, so this was a pleasant new dish to me! I let these marinate for the indicated time, but there was just a little too much soy sauce flavor for me. I may scale that back a little next time.

These were great!  I only marinated for 2 hours and then cooked them on a Foreman Grill and they still ended up tasty!

I made this recipe with the exact ingredients except I used a thicker cut, bone-in pork chop.  Then I only marinated for about 1 1/2 hours.  It was a HUGE hit for my husband and 3 picky little girls.  I did use half fresh rosemary and half dried rosemary.  I also placed them on the grill.  Great summertime meal.  Will be adding to my recipe collection.  Gotta love those Dakotans! :)

I thought these were just okay. My husband really liked them and my picky seven year old even ate them. I think they were have tasted better grilled rather than baked. They were very tender but personally I didn't care for the taste.

A tasty recipe - I used fresh rosemary (1 tsp chopped) and based on another reviewers comments added about 2 tbsp of orange juice to the marinade. The chops were grilled on a BBQ and were very tasty. Next time I'll add some garlic and ginger just to liven the flavour a bit more.

I really enjoyed this.  I tryed it on pork first and loved the taste and how ternder the chops were but when I tried it with boneless skinless chicken breast I fell in love.  I don't think I will ever use this recipe with chops again but I will use it with chicken over and over again!

Wow. I followed directions exactly. They actually tasted like sausage, which would have been ok if I was eating sausage. My husband hated them, on the bright side, the pork chops were very tender. Will not try again.

I paid heed to the reviews that suggested searing the chops first, then baking covered with some of the marinade.  It was good, but not so good as to become my go-to recipe for pork chops.  I'm still looking for that.

Really enjoyed and very easy to do.  I marinated in refrigerator for 3 hrs then cooked them the marinade, covered.  Should have removed the foil halfway through because they didn't look very appetizing.  I put them under the broiler to brown them up a bit.  My pickiest eater still didn't want to eat them but don't let that deter you from trying these chops!  I plan to use the leftovers in a pork fried rice.

It was ok.  I wasn't impressed.  Like other people said, it reminded me of breakfast sausage and it was too soy saucy.  I won't make this again.

I tweaked this just a tiny bit, but it still came out great.  I ran out of brown sugar so instead I used the soy sauce and rosemary, but threw in half a lemon cut into wedges with the maranade and let soak for 8 hours. Then just before baking I squeezed the lemon juice onto the chops and baked covered at 350 for 30 minutes. (chops were small)   They came out perfect! Moist and tasty, my kids even loved them!

Would have been five stars for the flavor but since I followed the directions to a T and baked uncovered for 30min....they came out too tough and wasted a dinner :(

Easy and quick, but too sweet. I suggest less brown sugar (1 table spoon is all that is necessary). When following the direct recipe the chops do come out tasting like breakfast sausage.
I liked the tenderness of the chops, and would use the recipe again with my omission.

I've made this a few times now and usually marinate them all day or overnight for best flavor.  I have baked them, grilled them and used various cuts of pork and they are always wonderful.  Thank you for an easy and delicious way to prepare pork chops!

Oh my gosh!!!!  This was absolutely divine!!  Definitely a very prominent rosemary taste, so if you don't like rosemary, this recipe may not be for you.  But I thought it was absolutely delicious!  We grilled ours and the pork chops got nice and carmelized.  Mmm!  Definitely a regular in our house!

My family loved this recipe! The chops were very moist and the rosemary gave it a wonderful flavor! Thank you for helping me out of the ground beef and chicken routine! This is going in my favorites recipe box!!

Absolutely delicious!  I only had time to marinade for an hour and they still turned out perfect.
