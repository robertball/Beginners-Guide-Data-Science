I followed the advice of a few reviewers (and my own instincts) and made a few changes: I cut the spinach in half and the breadcrumbs in half; I added 2 eggs to make it cuttable; I skipped the dill and poultry seasoning and instead added 1 teaspoon minced garlic; I also substituted 15 ounces of ricotta for the 8 ounces of cottage cheese.

Will definitely make it again, but with some alterations.  I used 1/2 the spinach so it stayed good and cheesy, but I should have cut the breadcrumbs too (way too much).  Next time I'm adding garlic and taking out the poultry seasoning (made it taste like stuffing to me).  Note: tastes great the day you make it, but loses its appeal the next day as leftovers.

I liked it..but changed it a bit- used mozzarella instead of feta, omitted the dill and poultry seasoning and added four eggs to make it 'cuttable' ...it was delicious! oh, and I used frozen spinach without any problems, I just made sure that I defrosted it and squeezed all of the water out.

This is such a flavorful dish, you wouldn't know you were eating spinach!  Rather than going to the extra effort of buying or making a pie crust, we just baked it in a shallow casserole dish.  The only change I made, was using ricotta cheese rather than cottage.  It's a little on the salty side, so, if watching your salt, cut back a bit on the poultry seasoning.  I used the left overs the next day in an omlette and it was amazing!  Will definately make again and again and again.  This may replace the boring green bean casserole at Thanksgiving!

So yummy! Made a few changes- saute'd onions in some olive oil, then threw in the spinach and cooked them for about 3 min's. Then I added feta and instead of cottage cheese, I used a dollop of creme fraiche. I let everything cook together in the pan for a couple of minutes, then placed it in the casserole dish. I omitted the butter and just sprinkled breadcrumbs on top and baked it for about 10 min's. Unbelievably tasty!

A nice light dish, good with soup.  It's kind of like a warm salad.  Oh yeah, and note to self: next time don't use frozen spinach....

Very yummy!  Only when I make it, I use about 1/2 of the ammount of bread crumbs the recipe calls for.   I prefer to taste the spinach and cheeses most and the crust least.  This is a very quick and easy alternative to spanikopita!

mmmm this is so delicious!  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the poultry seasoning.  It doesn't need it.  I also added an egg.  It tastes just like spanikopita and it was so easy.

First, i shall reduce the amount of the spinach, then followed with add more eggs. here i use 5 med eggs but the spinach i used was almost 2 pounds. Mix 2 kinda cheese; Ricotta & Cottage together. I omit the dill instead of oregano, black pepper, nutmeg, salt, pinch of poultry seasoning and i only use garlic (since my hubby doesn't like onion). Last, i accompany this pie with slices of Foccasia bread & red wine!...Hemmmmm..mama mia...

Wow.  Exactly as advertised, this is a super easy home version of one of my greek restaurant favorites!

I made mine with some diced chicken breast instead of poultry seasoning to make it more of a meal than a side.

The only thing I thought this recipe fell short on was the topping.  I was not a fan of the bread crumbs as a substitute for filo, although it was way easier.  I think next time I might try puff pastry instead...  kind of like a greek style chicken pot pie.

Loved this.  Followed the recipe except added sliced tomatoes to half.  Also, made one in a pie crust and one without.  Great both ways, but loved the one with the crust more.

I'm sorry but we didn't enjoy this at all. The onions over powered the entire dish. I may make it once more and omit the onions and add 5 eggs to help hold it together.

I absolutely LOVED this.  Wow!  Such a keeper.  I added 3 eggs, cut the feta to ~1/2 cup.  Cut the bread crumbs and butter by half.  So delicious!  I will be making this very often.  Great served hot or cold!

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I used about 4-5 eggs, and instead of breadcrumbs (I was out) I used crumbled pita chips, YUMMY! Went with reviewers suggestions and only added dill, oregano, black pepper and 2 crushed garlic cloves.  Definitely will make again.

Really great recipe for adults and kids alike! The sauce makes enough for two recipes so I freeze half for next time... and there is always a next time! Also, the baking time seems to be short I usually end up baking an extra ten minutes.

I just microwaved and squeezed some frozen spinach, added egg whites, paprika, and oregano, layered with cottage cheese and sprinkled with breadcrumbs before baking.  It was great, and a little lemon would make it better.

This did not turn out at all like I expected. It would probably be ok as a way to make spinach as a side dish to a meal, but to just have this as a main thing (or as an appetizer, as was my plan), and it's just way to spinach-y. It hardly comes out cheesy at all. Also, I was hoping to be able to cut small squares and let people eat with hands as appetizer -- no go on that.

Easy and close to authentic Greek dish.  I made it once as the recipe suggests, and a few other times with premade pie crust without breadcrumbs & butter, but they both came out great.  #1 Vegetarian Crowd pleaser.

I fully admit I eyeballed the measurements, left out the poultry seasoning, and added eggs, BUT I'm giving it 5 stars for the basic concept--you chop up fresh spinach, DON'T cook it ahead of time, and it turns out great! It wasn't watery, and everybody loved it.

It was delicious! I halved the spinach and bread crumbs. I used 3 tbsp or butter instead of 4. I also omitted poultry seasoning. I used italian bread crumbs instead of regular. It took about 2 hours in total. Next time I'll add mote spinach, i don't think there was enough.

As usual I wish I had read the previous reviews prior to cooking.  I halved the spinach and used a variety of seasoning from my spice cabinet as my only alterations to the recipe.  In the future I would also halve the bread crumbs and add an egg or two.

This was great!  I substituted oregano and the juice of 1/2 a lemon and bit of lemon zest for the dill and poultry seasoning to create a bit more of a spanikopita Greek flavor.  It turned out wonderfully!  I may add a beaten egg or two next time to hold the spinach mixture together a bit more though.

I customized this, so I am not sure if it is 4 stars as written or not. I added red bell pepper and a couple of cut up artichoke hearts, plus extra cottage cheese. I didn't have feta, so I used gorgonzola, which was a bit harsh, but milder the next day.

This was very good & nutritious.  We didn't use quite as much spinach called for, but found it very tasty.
