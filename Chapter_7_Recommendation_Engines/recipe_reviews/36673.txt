This is delicious and very healthy!  I used garlic and herb feta, doubled the garlic for more flavor (good idea!) and next time I'll add more salt and pepper - possibly some Tabasco (I like the heat!).  We'll definitely be having this again!

I LOVED the taste, but my tomatoes fell apart as soon as I tried to scoop them out of the pan.  Maybe I stuffed them too full?  I think next time instead of stuffing them, I'll just make it a casserole with diced tomatoes.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The rice mixture tasted great, I could eat it on its own!  Would make again, thanks.

I thought this was great!  Be very careful when scooping out the tomatoes though.  And I did have one burst because I overstuffed it.  I'll be more careful next time.  Thanks!

We jsut lvoed these and will definately make them again. I did not have any fresh organo but used dried, I eyeballed the amount...Turned out great. I let mine list for about 8 minutes before serving and with gentle handeling had no problems keeping htem together. I used jumbo shrimp because that is what I had and found that I could not get enough shrimp into each so I recomend stayign with medium or even small shrimp.

To increase the flavour of the filling, I added pureed artichoke hearts to give it a nice complimentary taste. I also suggest instead of serving it in shelled tomatoes, to use red peppers instead. Much more portable and won't destruct upon impact! ;)

I made this exactly as recipe states.  The filling was o.k. but needed some kick.  I'll try adding hot sauce next time.  Also, you need to be extremely careful when removing tomatoes from baking dish or they will fall apart.
