My husband and I really enjoyed this.. on the advice of our grocer we used monkfish (he called it "the poor man's lobster!) and it was excellent-this made this delcious recipe very very reasonable-allowing us to enjoy it much more often!!!  It was wonderful!

Excellent, and a keeper! I did change the procedure a bit by adding the cayenne pepper to the melted butter.  I then added the meat and the shell, covered to steam whilel I prepared other ingredients. This step added flavor directly to the lobster and gain addition flavor from the shell.  Remove meat, keeping warm and discard the shell, proceed with recipe.

Absolutely brilliant. As I live on the East Coast of course I used fresh lobster. Also added a little flour in lieu of egg yolks because of family health concerns; otherwise rich but delicious. Not a weekly choice, but certainly for special occasions.

Very rich and creamy!  I did take the advice of cooking the lobster meat and shells in the butter.  I added 1 cloves finely minced garlic and 1 cup sliced mushrooms.  Served over linguini pasta.

I made this as a topping for rib eye steak, originally. But the sauce is sooo thick with seafood (I only had cooked crab) that it worked much better on crackers and toast. Before adding the cream/egg mixture, I sweated 1/4 cup minced onion and 1 tablespoon chopped garlic - mmm added sweetness and texture. I used 3/4 teaspoon of cajun seasoning instead of salt, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Tasted great the next day warmed and served on plain crackers. I could have eaten a plateful! Gotta love heavy cream and butter in anything.

We all have to agree to form an alliance to not tell anyone how easy this recipe is! It is a restaurant quality recipe that takes minutes to cook.  I sauteed mushrooms in garlic butter and heated the lobster chunks that I had prepared earlier, in the same pan.  I also doubled the sauce and should have tripled it.  I served it over linguine with lemon wedges and Vigo Swamp Heat.  I also threw some leftover peas in the pasta to add a veg.   BTW, I am in St. Kitts and used spiny lobster.  Delicious!

THIS IS AWESOME!  Since moving to the midwest I've missed out on my favorite dish - Seafood Newburg.  I found this and thought I'd make it for my birthday - I strayed because I was looking for seafood and not just lobster - so I used fresh lobster, crab and scallops (as fresh as you'll get in the midwest) plus a bag of salad shrimp.  I also added in mushrooms because they needed to be used up and it turned out fabulous.  My husband even thought it was better than the stuff I used to get on the East Coast.  I served them over Puff Pastry Shells with asparagus and riesling wine!  SUPER!

OMG!!!! Could a simple recipe get any better??? I say "no".....This baby carries a WOW factor!!!  I made as directed with the exception of adding a bit of sauted fresh chopped spinach and small amount of red pepper for some color. I served this DELISHIOUS recipe in phllo dough cups which I made in my muffin tin along side a beautiful med rare ribeye steak which I blackened prior to grilling. The combination of the richness of the lobster newburg and the heat of the blackened steak was a definate winner!!!  Will most definately make again and play around with the versatility of ways to serve this recipe.  Next timme I am considering incorporating crab and scallops and tripling the sauce and making a nice seafood lasagna........Oh My...  I am so drooling on my keyboard!!!!!! LOL!

This recipe is so easy to prepare and absolutely delicious.  I added more nutmeg and omitted the cayenne and it was so creamy.  We could eat it every week, but Maine lobsters are pricey in Phoenix :-)

Total waste of perfectly good lobster tails.  Very, very bland - kept adding cayenne and nutmeg more sherry, still bland.  Steam those lobsters and dunk 'em in butter.....

This was a delicious way to eat lobster.  Perfect if you are looking for a change from steamed or grilled lobstertail.  will definately be making again.  Next time i might add a bit of flour or cornstarch in addition to the egg yolks to thicken it up a bit more to serve over pasta noodles.  Yummy!

OMG this was FANTASTIC! We added flour instead of egg yolks and smoked paprika instead of cayenne. I'm thinking about using milk next time just to see what kind of sauce I get I think it will be similar just not as fattening.

Excellent and easy to make.  The second time I made this I doubled the recipe, and added more sherry and more nutmeg and eliminated the salt.  The results were a smoother taste with a more pronounced flavor of nutmeg.

Wonderful recipe, though instead of serving over toast, I serve it in puff pastry, very rich and yummy for special occasions.

How can someone rate this low because of fat content?  Please, if you are concerned about that eat something else.  This was extremely good.  As lobster is expensive, I am sure most people only eat this occasionally anyway.  I used about a pound of lobster tails, and this was a great change of pace.  Served with grilled ribeyes.  What a meal!

Good flavor. It is different from the type of food I would usually make but my husband wanted this for his b-day and said it was great. I cooked the lobster in some water+Old Bay seasoning.

There's nothing better than live lobster, but I used imitation this time.  I did add a little sherry and additional salt and papper, but was still very good over toast points.  Husband loved it - will definitly make again  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was so rich and delicious! Everyone who tried it loved it. I made it again the next day and ate it for lunch and dinner. We tried it over rolls and it was good, but it was exceptionally great over sourdough or white toast. Great recipe!

This sauce is amazing! I made stuffed shells with chopped cooked shrimp, crab in a can, a touch of nutmeg, salt and pepper in the ricotta. I put this sauce over the shells and served 2 shells as an appetizer. Everyone, even the kids loved this. Next time I'll add scallops, crab and shrimp to the sauce and put over shells and serve as a meal.

Awesome sauce! I actually made the sauce to pour over a lobster and muenster cheese omelette (I had left over lobster from the night before). I also threw the shells in to flavor the sauce and used old bay instead of salt. I reduced the sherry to 1 tbs. I topped my omelette with this sauce and sliced green onion over the top.  It was incredible.  As good as it is, I am sure the original recipe (as served over toast) is just as good!  Thanks!

Delicious and easy! I used the frozen Langostino tails from Trader Joes which made everything that much easier. They have a similar sweetness as lobster meat. We tasted the suace before serving and my 24 year old son suggested a squeeze of lemon juice. I did like the addition of something acidic, but either way would have been wonderful. He had his on toast and raved about it. This is also perfect for anyone following the Atkins diet as I am. I simply left out the toast and had it with asparagus. Will make again for sure.

Really good recipe for a beginning cook. Made this for the BF and myself because we were craving seafood. Hit the spot but it's sooo rich! Took a bit to thicken and actually added a little flour for it to thicken quickly because of time.  May try stuffing this in pastry next time like others mentioned - if I can get the sauce to thicken up enough. Would be fantastic for pasta!

Outstanding.  Sprinkled it with some bouquet garni and served it over pasta for Valentine's Day.

This was so easy to make and so delicious! I served it over rice and with fresh bread on the side (because that is how I remember my mother serving Newburg when I was a kid) and even my 3 1/2 year old daughter cleaned her plate!  If not for the fat content I would make this weekly!!

This was great!  I used flour instead of egg yolks as suggested by others and a local bottled hot sauce in place of cayenne.  I also omitted the nutmeg.  It was a hit with the whole family and I will make it again a a seafood newburg.

This was very good even though I made it with imitation crab meat.  Our fav local restaurant has a salmon or steak newburg that is delicious so I replicated it with this and put it over grilled salmon filets.  Yummy.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half and it was still very creamy and thick.  I do wish the recipe said how long to expect to cook it until it thickens.  I had to guess at the timing of all my other food.  I think it is missing something but can't put my finger on it yet.  I'll definitely make this again!

use white wine instead of sherry and was fine.  I did have a problem with the butter and the cream seoperating, because it may have boiled for just a second before removing from the stove.

I prepared this recipe using two tails, which I steamed in the shells, served over eggs noodles. Makes a very rich dish. Since I live alone, I shared with my elderly neighbor, who happens to be a gourmet cook himself, he raved and wanted the reciped right away. So, I turned him on to this website. Now we have a new member.

This recipe was a hit!  I made a few modifications.  I sauteed a shallot and minced garlic in the butter and skipped the eggs and added flour instead.  I also omitted the nutmeg.  To serve, I made puff pastry circles and filled with  mashed potatoes and topped with the recipe.  It was heavenly!

This recipe was good, but I really had a hard time enjoying it. Extremly high fat content, the recipe should come with a warning.....Take extra precaution, enjoy this recipe with a cardioligist close by.

I was looking for a decadent recipe for Christmas dinner, it was a huge hit! Very rich. 
Instead of toast points I used Pepperidge Farm puff pasties

The recipe does not say when to add the cream.  I just did it at the end while warming up the lobster, but I do no know if that is the best way.

I was in the mood for seafood the other night and found your recipe.  I used Madeira this time only because when I went to my bar it was what I saw first.  And I used puff pastry shells instead of toast because I had them already in the freezer.  Wonderful, quick and easy yet very elegant!  I think a lot of people might be a bit scared because to the butter and the constant stirring.  But there really is nothing to be worried about.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for friends as part of a Thank you dinner.  This was absolutely great!  Everyone raved about it that evening and the next day at a BBQ we attended.  This was easy and fast.  Served in puff pastry shells next to bacon rapped filets with a side salad.  I took the lobster meat from tails, diced the meat and cooked it in the butter as it melted.

quite tasty, although a little rich for our dietary tates, but still a wonderful occaisional treat!  I have tweaked it a bit to make it a bit lower in calorie count and fat content, and will share that recipe directly.  Very Delicious!

Horrible in every way possible. Followed recipe to the T and I have to say it was tasteless, had NO flavor and was nothing like a newburg sauce that I have had in restaurants.  Can not understand how people loved this.  Total waste of shellfish. Stay away from this one for sure.

This turned out pretty well, but a few tips for future cooks. Be very patient when you start cooking the egg and cream mixture as overheating and over stirring turn the mixture into scrambled eggs. Even adding extra cream to try and thin it out after the fact was not particularly effective. It still tastes very good, though. It would be even better with day old bread, since the fresh bread I used got a bit soggy from the sauce, even though I had double toasted it.

I finely chopped a small white onion and finely chopped a Jalapeno from my garden (as I didn't have cayenne pepper).  I then sautéed this mixture and added the juice of the lobster.  Then I continued with the original recipe!!  Tasted great!!

Omitted the egg yolks and used a tablespoon of flour to thicken.  Also sautéed some sliced mushrooms and diced onions with the garlic.   I used spiny lobster and after removing the meat from the shells broiled the empty shells which turned them red and then stuffed the shells with the mixture when serving.  Was very easy to make and delicious and will definitely be making again.

Made this for my boyfriend, I think he’s going to marry me now! Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and baked it in puff pastry, folded around the lobster Newburgh. Definitely on my favourites list.

Simple and delicious. I want to point out the importance of not letting it come to a boil. If it does. The cream an butter will separate after awhile and it won’t be pretty :)

Followed as directed, but at the end, I added a shrimp paste (a dozen pre-cooked, small shrimp ground with the mini food processor).   Preparing sautéed sword fish and was inspired to top it with the sauce, then  a few whole shrimp on top of that.  I love that this recipe uses no flour, and after seasoning it, the taste was exquisite!  It was rich and flavorful.  Perhaps I added a teensy more than 2TBS Sherry?

It was a little salty and I only used half the salt, I would omit it entirely next time.

Out delicious sauce - that's all I ended up with (on toast) as I wanted to be the gracious hostess. Will wait until the lobsters go on sale for less than $7.99 a pound and make more, much more. Being huge lobster eaters as we are in this house, next time I would add more lobster. Yum.

I ended up substituting a lot here but I was definitely inspired by the basics of this recipe. I used coconut cream instead of heavy cream, and red wine vinegar instead of sherry. Added minced garlic and half a lemon squeezed in the butter sauce prior to mixing it with the egg mixture.  After the sauce thickened I added pasta, steamed broccoli & Brussel sprouts. I let cool for about 5 minutes allowing the sauce to thicken. Then added Italian seasoning and garnished with Parmesan cheese to taste. Basically Frankinsteined your recipe but it came out delish-ee-oso!!

I think based on all of the other reviews that this could be great. It was way too salty for my taste. I used white wine because I didn't have sherry and another review stated that they'd made this sub audit was good. I think sherry would have been better. I

Very flavorful! I did take others advice a bit. I sauteed Very little white onion, green onion and one garlic clove minced in the butter and then added the Sherry. Then I pretty much completed the recipe as is. I used Lobster from a container, claw meat and tail meat so delicious. I did add a touch of Cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce a bit more. This would be very tasty on angel hair pasta or in a Green pepper or atop mushroom, then baked with a little parmesan sprinkled on the top. Thank you for a wonderfully, easy recipe!

My husband and I like this very much.   I took some of the others suggestions added mushrooms, shalotts, more pepper and nutmeg, with 5Tbs marsala.  Doubled sauce recipe.  Will do this again with other seafood.

Decadent! This is a keeper for those special occasions. IThe only thing I did different was added sauteed mushrooms.  I used frozen Lobster and squeezed out ALL the excess water. I did make 12 servings to serve 7 of us and glad I did (I would say there was enough left over for 1 more serving) It was the right amount with a bunch of men at the table. Had this been a ladies luncheon the regular serving size would have been fine. If I wanted to be picky I would add a little more of the seasonings

Made this exactly to the recipe, although I doubled the sauce.  It was rich enough but pretty bland overall.  While I realize Lobster is a delicate flavor and doesn't need to be overwhelmed with others, this really does need something more.
I have never been to Red Lobster so can't attest to a comparison of flavors in that regard.  I will definitely add finely diced shallots in a future rendition but not likely garlic as that is too overwhelming.  Will definitely do the mirepoix in the broth for steaming the tails.  (as per the original Delmonico's recipe).  The three tails I bot worked out to 3/4 cup of Lobster meat which was adequate for two peeps but expensive to serve more so if needs to be moh bettah if I'm going to do this again.  As written, you may as well make Hollandaise.  It's not much different.
I'll try again using Chef Anotoine's tweaks with a little help from the original recipe.  I'm sure it will be great but not with the recipe as written.

As others have stated, this is a restaurant-quality dish that is incredibly easy to make.  I made it exactly as written, and it was perfect.  I used two whole lobsters, but next time I will use either lobster tails or perhaps try making Crab Newburg, using Alaskan king crab. Most of my time was spent extracting the meat from the whole lobsters, so avoiding the whole lobsters would speed up the process.  I will also try using canned milk instead of the heavy cream, as an experiment. If I don't give up too much in flavor, the canned milk would make it more healthful.

This is totally awesome!  Easy to do and the taste is fantastic!  I can't wait to try it on shrimp, halibut and cod or maybe try serving it with rice or quinoa, instead of the toast.

This is the recipe I've been looking for! You can add shrimp, scallop, any kind of fish to this recipe. Adjust all the spices to your own taste. I crumbled up some buttery crackers and spread on top and broiled. Served with rice. This was excellent!

This had a great flavor and was so easy to make!  I sauteed the lobster tail in the butter for a few minutes before starting the recipe & also added an extra kick of cayenne.  I thought it needed more lobster, but at $27 for 2 tails, I think I'll add lump crabmeat to accompany it instead!!

I ended up making this a "seafood" newburg with shrimp, scallops, crab & lobster but it was delish!  Made it for my mom's bday & everyone loved it.  Boyfriend has already asked when I'm making again.  My only complaing:  maybe my family has huge appetites or something, but I adjusted for 10 servings & it still didn't seem to be enough!

I made this recipe to serve at a Sunday brunch. It kept well in a chafing dish and I spooned it into puff pasty shells to serve. It was an elegant way to enjoy this deliciously easy dish.
