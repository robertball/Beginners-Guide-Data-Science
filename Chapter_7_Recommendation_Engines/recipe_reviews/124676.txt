Not too impressed. Followed recipe exactly. At recommended cook times - found to be a little undercooked. Lemon pepper didn't really do much for flavor enhancement.

I liked the cooking method as well as the lemon-pepper seasoning. I added garlic salt and coarsely chopped red bell pepper for color.

Wonderful! I never knew I could make broccoli taste so good! I squirted some fresh lemon over the finished product. My husband and I devoured it. Thanks for the recipe!

We loved the lemon-pepper seasoning in this! Decided to add a squirt of lemon juice and a clove of minced garlic... might even be tempted to add the diced red pepper suggested by others next time... and there WILL be a next time. Thanks for a great new way to do up the broccoli!

Absolutely delicious!!!!!  I'm a picky person and I ate it up and wanted more.  My 3yr old and 2yr old gobbled it down as well.

Thank-you for this recipe, our family really enjoyed it.  I cooked the broccoli longer and used a cover for a few minutes.  I just tested the doneness until it was done how I like it.  I also used some lemon juice at the end.

Still very raw tasting & lacking in flavor. I should have cooked it longer & squirted lemon at the end.

This is a really tasty, if very simple, way to do broccoli! Even my husband, who is very picky, liked it.

My family LOVED this broccoli.  My husband told me that I am forbidden to cook broccoli any other way.  My one-year-old would have eaten the entire bowl of broccoli himself if we'd have let him.  The broccoli is so flavorful and tangy!  Yummy!

Thanks so much for this, I was pretty in need of a broccoli recipe for dinner and came across yours this afternoon. Everyone loved it :)

I varied the recipe a little by adding chopped onion and some water to soften the broccoli. I must say the butter and lemon-pepper flavors complement each other really well!

I have to agree with the other reviewer who said this was lacking in taste.  Both my husband and I like broccoli and we both felt this recipe somehow took away the actual flavor of broccoli!  We thought it was possibly a good recipe for people that don't hate broccoli.    BWT, I did add fresh lemon juice at the end as others suggested.....still didn't do anything for me.

This recipe was easy and very, very tasty!  I loved how the broccoli stayed crisp.  We added a squeeze of lemon and it was a winner!  Definitely going to make this one again!

Very easy to cook and tasty to eat!  Turned out perfect.  My son says "it is truly awesome."  Downside- I didn't make enough and he gobbled it all up.

Easy delicious veggie dish. I needed a quick vegetable to go with dinner and this worked perfectly. My family enjoyed it. Thanks.
