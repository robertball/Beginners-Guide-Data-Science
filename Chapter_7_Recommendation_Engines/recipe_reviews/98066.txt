I made a few changes... instead of apples, I used celery and instead of pudding I used Cream of Mushroom Soup. Don't you hate it when people completely change the recipe & then complain about it?  I'm only kidding.  I made this as written and it was really very good.  Gone in under an hour.

This was a huge hit at my family's harvest nite!  I used apple pie filling cause I was feeling lazy, I also used reg. grahams.  I let it set for about 16hrs and that was plenty.  The texture was surprisingly thicker than I would have thought and really tasty! I also used marzetti's caramel dip to pipe all over the top in a nice thick layer and that sent it over the top!

I made this twice for parties/ potlucks and it got great reviews. It is very tasty. Both times I used apple pie filling (a 32 ounce jar) instead of bothering to peel, chop, and cook apples to basically make a pie filling. With all the other shortcuts, why make your own pie filling (unless you have apples you need to get rid of)? 

I personally don't think the cinnamon grahams add much and the 2nd time making it I just used regular grahams (maybe because my store bought pie filling had plently of cinnamon in it).

Easy & quick to make (with the store bought filling). Yummy. Makes a 13" x 9" dish very very full though.

I made this for a Sunday dinner that we do for the building fund. It was one of the first desserts gone and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I used no sugar added apple pie filling 2 15 oz. cans, could not find any cinnamon graham crackers so added 1/2 tsp. to each can pie filling!  My husband loved it & everyone else

This was a great success at a work party.  I used all fat free and low fat products.  It tasted great and was guilt free!

OMG This is THE BEST....A friend from work has made this one twice to share at work and it is gone before you know it! The last time she made TWO because it is so popular. Today we thought of other fruits we might like to try in place of apples like maybe bananas or kiwi or a variety like a flan. This is most definatly a keeper...can't wait to make it for family! Thanks SoccerMum !!!

i thought that it brought out the taste of the caramel and the apples very well.  I tried it twice, once with a store bought apple filling and once with real apples and the real apple way is amazing.  Also having cinnamon really helps to give it a balance in flavour

I took this to a family dinner and it was gone in a flash.  I used a 10x14 pan instead of 9x13 and it worked wonderfully.

This cake is awsome! While making it, it seemed like there was way too much of the pudding mix and not enough of the other layers, but I was wrong. It was perfect. Highly recommended!!! It was easy to make and super fun to eat :)

I made this recipe for a school function, so I made it into individual servings, the kids liked it but when I sampled one I thought that the bottom graham crackers end up too soft and mushy.

Made it exactly as directed, but put a thin layer of cool whip over the caramel. It was a big hit at work!

Not my favorite - or a big hit at the party.  The caramel topping makes it very, very sweet.

Taste was OK but this was a real mess to look at and got gross-looking very quickly.  Probably won't make again.

This recipe does not get the credit it deserves. It’s so much better than I expected. I did use canned apple pie filling, although I think the homemade version would be even better. I just didn’t want to put all that time into it until I knew if I’d even like it. The sour cream really pulls this recipe together so don’t leave it out!
