This is really good. I made it with petit cubed beef with taco seasoning added to it. Served it with a southwest salad and a few tortilla chips.

Even my 6 yr old liked it. It definitely needs pico or salsa. Extra cilantro for sure.

My boys reall liked this dish! I followed directions exactly. Topped it with fresh cilantro, salsa and guacamole. Served it with warmed low-carb tortillas on the side. It tasted healthy, not too salty. Yum!

This was great! Very versatile, my boys put it into a tortilla for a burrito, I put it on a bed of lettuce for 'cantina bowl salad' and my husband just ate it as a bowl. I did add corn,  and put a cilantro lime vinaigrette on top, I also use farmhouse mexican rice instead of knor , I'm sure there was no difference made because of that.  The Cilantro and the Pico de Gallo is a must!
