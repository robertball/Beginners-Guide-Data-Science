Loved this recipe! I didn't have the cheese mix they asked for however, so I used mozzarella and cream cheese instead. It was excellent!

Made for Sunday supper.  Everyone liked it.  Kept some orzo plain for Jake & Ty but they both ate chicken.  Cooked thighs in a broth for a few hours and then just put in a pan with Sundried Tomato dressing with Italiano cheese and heated until cheese was melted.

This was delicious! My husband isn't an asparagus fan but said that this was great! I couldn't find the cheese specified so I just used an Italian blend. The chicken didn't get done so I threw it in the oven at 425 for about 15 minutes. Perfect!

I didn't have the dressing or the cheese (or the asparagus!) so I used vadallia onion dressing and havarti cheese and broccoli. It came out just a tad too sweet but that was the fault of the dressing. I actually really liked this and the kids did too but next time I'll try with the dressing per the recipe!
