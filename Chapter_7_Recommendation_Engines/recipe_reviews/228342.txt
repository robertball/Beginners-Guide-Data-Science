A delish cake for mocha and cinnamon lovers. The mocha and cinnamon go great together and weren't overpowering. A very good cake, indeed. Just make sure to not over beat and over bake. The texture of the cake is light and fluffy. I dare you to try it!

I followed the recipe perfectly other than I didn't make a sheet cake. I made a double layer 9 inch round cake. Turned out fabulous!!!

The cake was delicious, even though I made a substitution: I used 8 oz. of  strong coffee to substitute for the cup of water and espresso powder. 

I used the icing from Texas Sheet Cake V recipe, which is like fudge.

This was a hit at the house.  I made it earlier today and cut into it about an hour ago already two rows are gone.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the only exception that I kept in the oven an additional 5 minutes because the middle was quite jiggly.  Will make again and again..

This is HEAVEN.  Very moist, and the coffee and cinnamon flavour just brings out the chocolate even more.  It didn't last very long in our house, let me tell you!

Batter tastes good...it's in the oven right now. Went together very easy..except...did anyone else see the variance in  ingredients? The ingredient list is different than what is listed in the directions. Very confused. I made it according to directions. Looks like it is taking g a little longer to cook ??

This cake tastes great! I made it into two layered 9in cake. I baked it for 25 mins. I used brewed coffee and removed the water from the recipe because I didn’t have instant. The frosting was JUST enough to ice it. Working with hot coffee and hot cocoa can be interesting. I think it’s best to wait for those ingredients to cool down before using them. Incorporating them while hot effects the texture of the cake. Over all family loved it and it had great flavor!

I made this in a 9 x 13 pan and it took about 40 minutes to bake. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more powdered sugar for the icing and added chopped pecans on top of the cake.

Made it exactly. My family couldn't get out of it! I do believe I have created a tradition with this one. I love that it is casual yet, I could dress it up to make for a special occasion.

Really didn't care for this. The old man thought it was good, but for me it lacking something. Will probably not make again.
