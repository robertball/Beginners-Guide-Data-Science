Made this for a dinner party last night and it got rave reviews.  I felt that the sauce was a bit too thick needed some water, so I strained the water I used to rehydrate the mushrooms and added it to the sauce.  I simmered it about 15 minutes extra and it loosened the sauce up just perfectly.

This is a magnificent dish for those that love the heady, earthy flavor and aroma of porcini mushrooms. Easy to make, delicious to eat!

Try adding a "secret" ingredient at the very end:  a few tablespoons of milk or cream!  It takes this sauce to a new level!  I threw the carrots and pepper in my food processor as well as the mushrooms.  The thin slices absorbed the cooking liquids for an amazing taste.  I used canned crushed tomatoes and lots of crimini and oyster mushrooms (fresh.)  This is now my favorite pasta sauce recipe.

Loved this over thin spaghetti.  Used white wine instead of red with no problem.  Will definitely make this again.

i used fresh baby bella mushrooms and fresh tomatoes (recipe didn't specify canned or fresh) and a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes. I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe called for to get the right texture, but thought it was plenty moist without adding more water. tasty and healthy.

Easy to make but I just didn't find it that tasty. Turned into a gloopy unappealing substance and texture. I ate it happily, but my fiance struggled to eat it. Of note, I used white onions instead of red, dried porcini's, and dried basil instead of fresh.

I couldn't find porcini mushrooms so I used what was available in the market. Using fresh tomatoes and port wine, this dish was delicious!

Followed recipe to the letter.  Found the dish extremely bland.  Would not recommend.
