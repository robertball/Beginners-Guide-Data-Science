This is either spot on or so close you can’t tell the difference. As written, this will make almost 7 cups of chocolate liquid as I first mixed the ingredients in a Vitamix® blender before dumping into a Cuisinart® 2 quart ice cream freezer bowl. To allow for expansion, the liquid should remain 1/2" below the top of the bowl but came a little closer to the top than that. A few spoonfuls for sampling purposes made sure there was no overrun. Used the 3 ingredients as written plus 1 tablespoon Scharffen Berger Unsweetened Cocoa Powder to make it more chocolaty. Sampled it at this juncture, and it tasted like a Wendy's® frosty. Then experimented by adding vanilla extract, and liked that version a little more. Next added some Kahula®, and that was mighty good too. All sorts of easy variations are possible. Nice heist, SCJasmine . . . if you get the Coca-Cola® formula, I’ll be really impressed!

I agree - it taste like Wendy's! Please not this recipe makes a lot! I had to split the mixture because it wouldn't fit into my Kitchen Aid ice cream attachment.

This makes a ton but is really yummy. I can actually get two or three batches of this from one mixture. Of course normally it is just my hunny and I. I think it tastes closer to a Friendly's Fribble but still amazing and hits the spot

I made this recipe twice this weekend.  The first time with Vanilla Almond Milk and the second with Dark Chocolate Almond milk.  It was just as yummy as when I have followed the recipe as written.
