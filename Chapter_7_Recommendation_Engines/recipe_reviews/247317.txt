Good turkey meatballs. Definitely had to add more breadcrumbs with the egg to dry out the meatballs. I also must have made them smaller because they were a little over done at 25 min so I'd suggest checking them after 15-20 mins depending on how large your meatballs are rolled. I also didn't have seasoned meat so I added tastefully simple Italian garlic bread seasoning and the taste of the meatballs came out just amazing. The first time I also had a fresh lemon and second time used the lemon peel from a bottle and the fresh seemed to make it better, but not by much. As always, fresh ingredients always end up better but if you don't have it, you're not missing out on too much. I will be making these again and perfecting some of the changes. Enjoy!

I made these meatballs and they were absolutely delicious. This is actually my 2nd time making them. The first time, I followed the recipe to a T, but the meatballs had to cook longer because they were extremely mushy. This time, I skipped the lemon rind, bread crumbs, and egg. They came out crispy on the outside and nicely firm on the inside. I would definitely make it again, eliminating the same 3 ingredients.

This was delicious.  I used unseasoned turkey and added my own Italian spices.

I’m growing basil and oregano so I was looking for a recipe that called for both. This was a winner. I was skeptical of the lemon rind but really added some pizzazz. My recommendations are that you add more bread crumbs because the turkey meat isn’t as firm as beef. I actually crushed some saltine crackers (about 6) to add to the mix. Also added a little garlic salt, garlic pepper and used 4 small garlic pods instead of 2. I also found that the 24oz of sauce just didn’t go far enough for the amount of meatballs. I would recommend doubling.

Love this healthy recipe.  Used this to make excellent meatball subs.  Will make this a household continued recipe.  Did need to cook the meatballs a little longer than suggested.
