This was surprisingly good. I added an extra tbs of brown sugar because I didn't think it was sweet enough. I checked the chicken in 2.5 hours and it was done. It was so easy to make this. Thanks you for sharing your recipe.

I cooked it on high for 3 hours and it was delicious. I served it over white rice. So easy and yummy! Will definitely make it again.
