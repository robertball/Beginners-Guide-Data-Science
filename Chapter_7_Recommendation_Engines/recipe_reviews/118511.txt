I doubled this recipe to serve four. Before mixing the oats in with the dry ingredients, I ran them through my food processor for a finer consistancy. One of the BEST waffles we've had. The combination of the whole wheat flour, ground oats, pecans and blueberries was amazing. VERY filling.

Great waffles. I left out pecans, added only 2 tbsp of oil an increase milk by 1 1/2 tbsp. Very tastefuls. thanks for sharing.
Update... Once, I forgot to add sugar and now, I can say I prefer them without it. Oh, great with orange juice too instead lemon!!!

I like this recipe! I used whole wheat flour instead of white and applesauce in place of the oil. I used mixed berries instead of just blueberries! It was yummy and very filling! will make this again!

These were great. Crunchy outside soft inside. I added buttermilk instead of milk and skipped the lemon juice. I also added 2 tbs of ground flax seed and a splash of vanilla. Next time I will try beating the egg white to a soft peak before adding to the dry ingredients and I will skip the pecans to make a softer textured waffle. I used the honey syrup recipe from a cornflake waffle recipe on this site it was a very good on the waffle.

Great recipe.  I made it as written with frozen blueberries.  The oats and pecans add a nice texture to the waffles.  I would add a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla next time.  It yielded 3 waffles.

My husband's one comment was "stout".  These were a great deal heavier than I would have liked.  Perhaps with 1/2 the oatmeal and more liquid it would have worked.  Just too heavy for us.

Makes two good size waffles that are consistently tasty.  The waffles also have a bit of weight from the oats which keeps me full longer.  One of my personal favorites.

this was delicious! i didn't have the quick cooking oats so my husband said to cook the oatmeal first and then add to it so i did.  i used whole wheat flour instead of the white and walnuts instead of pecans.   then i put the blueberries on the top after i cooked them.

these were pretty good- i increased the servings to 10 so i could put a bunch in the freezer. the only thing i would change is they are a bit crunchier than i prefer, would be good either figuring out how to make them a little softer or possibly adding banana? will try these again!

These are so delicious and filling; I love making this recipe on a lazy Saturday morning!  To make them more Weight Watcher friendly, I substituted applesauce for the oil and left out the pecans.  My waffle iron produced three servings instead of two, which made this into a six Points Plus breakfast.  These are a regular item in my breakfast rotation!

I see that I added this recipe to my box around this time in 2007, so I guess I've been using it since then! We use this recipe often; I switch out the blueberries for whatever fruit I happen to have (tonight it was apples and cinnamon). I also use regular oats since I don't buy the quick-cooking kind; this has never seemed to matter. Thanks for the great recipe!

These definitely taste "healthy" and not in a good way. Too dense, not enough flavor - we choked down a few.

Perfect, delicious brunch for 2!!!  Used frozen blueberries I had (did not thaw which was correct).  Used buttermilk (didn't have milk).  Threw in a spoonful of flaxseed.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that my boyfriend and I are going to enjoy again and again!!!!

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars if I could. The waffles were good, but not worthy of 5 stars. They were a little denser than I like. Even with the addition of cinnamon (1tsp) and vanilla (1tsp), the waffles were a bit on the bland side.   I tripled the recipe so we would have some leftover to freeze; the recipe made 6.5 Belgian waffles. I used 4 Tbsp of oil instead of the calculated 3/4 cup, which I thought was a bit excessive; the waffles turned out fine with less oil.

Definately a 5 star recipe.  I've made the posted version previously which was great.  Tonight I made a slight variation by using applesauce instead of oil.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of blackberry freezer jam to each waffle (in the batter).  These turned out perfect as well.

These waffles are very easy to make and taste great.  It was the perfect amount for breakfast with my boyfriend.  I made these again this morning with the blueberries, and the waffles stuck like crazy to the waffle maker.  We liked them but I guess the blueberries require a bit more of a delicate hand than I thought!  We'll try again another time--perhaps fresh blueberries are not the way to go!  Still tasted delicious though!

This was good, although I was hoping that the blueberries would have added a little more sweetness. I opted to not use the nuts, not a big fan of nuts in my baked goods...We added about 1 tsp vanilla, and that made them better in my opinion.

Good blueberry waffle!  However, I didn't like the flavor as much when you leave out the blueberries (I made some waffles without blueberries- my husband isn't a big blueberry fan).

Flavor was very good - but my husband was looking for waffles more crunchy on the outside.  Maybe it was the oats - or maybe the waffle maker?

These waffles were indeed fabulous. They are heavy, and so filling, I went for hours without being hungry!! The only thing I did differently was use almonds and not pecans. I will warn you they didn't smell particularly yummy while cooking, but the taste was wonderful!

Yum! I subbed out 1/2 the AP flour for white whole wheat flour to make them healthier. Also if you double the recipe it'll make 4 huge hearty waffles! These were so filling and so delicious...especially great w/ a side of thick cut bacon ;)

A...MAZ...ING! I absolutely loved these waffles. Changes I had to make: Buttermilk instead of milk (therefore I also omitted lemon juice), white sugar instead of brown (I was out of brown sugar!), increased frozen blueberries to 3/4 cup (I like more blueberries). The next time I make this I will double the recipe.... these went fast and my five year old ate hers without complaint. This one is a keeper.

I've made these as written and they are really yummy. However, I've tried these making a few changes to make them healthier and find it makes no difference to the taste or texture. I replacef the ap flour with half ww and half wheat germ, replaced the oil with applesauce and replaced the egg with 1 tbs ground flax seeds mixed with 3 tbs water. I usually get 3 waffles out of this recipe.

These were pretty good.  They are hearty and very filling.  My son liked them at first, but filled up quite quickly, as did I.  I think my husband would like them a lot, so I'll definitely be trying the recipe again, but I don't think it's going to be a household favorite - just a nice change of pace when we'd like something a bit different.  I followed the recipe closely, but subbed white whole wheat flour for the ap flour and just eyeballed the pecans and berries rather than measuring exactly.

Tried this recipe just this evening. Used freshly ground soft white flour to make them more nutrious... other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Not too sweet just right. Had blueberry sauce on top to add to the blueberry flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I am very satisfied with this recipe! My fiance says these are the best waffles he's ever eaten, and that he wants his waffles to be made this way all the time from now on. Two things, it seems as though my brown sugar went MIA so I had to use white sugar. Also I didn't have blueberries so it was just a plain waffle...nevertheless it came out delicious and filling, which is great, because I'm not a fan of those waffles that are mostly air in the middle. I love me a waffle that has some substance to it! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. This recipe is a keeper.

This was a great hit. They were very filling. I added some vanilla and used stevia instead of brown sugar. I would make them a bit sweeter next time. I served with whipped cream and syrup. I will definitely make again!

This is the only waffle recipe I use for ANY waffles.  I have made it exactly as the recipe states, but I have also substituted whole-wheat flour for the white flour, and substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil (leave in 1 Tbsp of oil + 1/4 cup applesauce).  We have also substituted strawberries or a mix of berries.  Just tonight, I added 1 tsp cinnamon and substituted about 2/3 of chopped apple.  This recipe is excellent and versatile!
I have come to figure out that this mix makes exactly 2 full waffles (2 rounds in the waffle iron).
Thank you so much for sharing!

Used GF King Arthur Flou,r so I had to add a couple tablespoons more "milk". Used coconut oil for my oil and just used the pecans - no blueberries today. We had peaches so I put them on top. Batter was thick but made exactly one whole waffle.

These were really good! We just got through eating them. I am so full! I substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose flour and left out the lemon juice, pecans and blueberries. I also doubled the recipe (my husband can eat a lot!) but kept the oil the same. I will be making these for breakfast all the time!

We thought these were pretty good. I did use Kashi instant vanilla oatmeal packets in place of plain oatmeal though, so that added extra sugar and vanilla flavoring. They would've been good with regular oats as well, we just would've needed more syrup to sweeten to our taste. The nuts added a layer of texture that I'm not sure enhanced my overall enjoyment but the flavor was nice, so we give this 4 stars. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been fair and tried these 2-3 times, but I just don't find them all that great. They are tasty, but not the best blueberry waffles I've ever had.

WOW! These are so good and healthy too. My family loved them and now I make enough to have them the next morning too. The only thing I changed was doing half regular flour and half whole wheat flour. They are so hearty and filling that I can't even eat a whole one. Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought these were okay.  The kids did not like them, but they are picky eaters.  I could have used more blueberries, or maybe mushed them up before adding to the batter so they were more spread out.  I just thought the texture was a bit off - maybe its the oatmeal.  I'm not sure - they were really dense feeling to me.  I would make again for the baby for the fact that they are pretty healthy - I subbed the oil for applesauce as another reviewer suggested.  She liked them and doesnt add anything on top of them.

Great taste; very hearty. I subbed half the oil for applesauce and added in about 1/4 c wheat germ (leaving out 1/4 c flour), and used part whole wheat pastry flour.

This was a GREAT waffle recipe. The only changes I made were adding another Tbsp of Brown Sugar and I added one well ripened banana, smashed into a goo. ;-) We slapped these in our waffle maker. it's round and the top lifts up. I put a half cup of batter and it was the perfect amount to make 3 waffles like this. Really Great!

Yummy! I used a packet or 2 of instant oatmeal w/pecans instead of oats and pecans (since the measurements were about the same). Turned out delicious!

I have made this twice now and the only changes I made was I used whole wheat flour for  1/2 of the flour and white all-purpose flour for the the remainder and I sifted it, plus I used walnuts because I was out of pecans.  I also added about a 1/4 cup extra milk as I thought they were a bit thick the first time I made them.   My twin 3 year old toddlers eat them without syrup or butter, I  just cut a waffle up in a bowl with a banana and a glass of milk.  Healthy, filling and yummy!

I thought these came out pretty good, but my husband thought they were a bit starchy.  I think I expected them to be a little more blueberrish, but they were still good.  Next time I think I will try a different recipe... maybe it was the quaker oats my hubby didn't like so much.

These were delicious! I doubled everything except the oil to make 4 Belgian waffles. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Outstanding recipe and will definitely make again! Thanks.
