Great recipe. I substituted 2 cups Pamela's Gluten Free Baking Mix for the brown rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch (it includes those same ingredients). I left the rest as is and ended up with 30 standard-size muffins. They came out moist, which is not usually the case with gluten-free baking. They're not very sweet, which worked well for me, but they're still flavorful.

Great muffins, even if your not gluten -free.  My family loves them.  They're not really sweet-just perfect.  They go great as an accompaniment to soup on a cold day.  I've made them 3 times and I can't recommend any changes.  The only down side is the number of ingredients.
