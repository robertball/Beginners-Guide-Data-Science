Most excellent. I've used more cheese than the recipe requires, both in the batter and on top. It came out finger-licking good. Five stars.

My husband and I loved this tasty casserole.  I used the 14.5 oz. cans of corn and it turned out great.  You can add or subtract from this recipe pretty easily and still come out with a great dish.

This was excellent -- although I made some substitutions since I wanted some of the ingredients in the other recipes that sounded good too.

I doubled the recipe; used 1-1/3 c. Jalapeno cheese instead of cheddar cheese, used cream cheese instead of sour cream, used Glory Foods Corn Muffin Mix (2 boxes since I doubled), topped with 1/2 c. Finely Shredded "4-Cheeses"  Combination by Kraft and topped with salt, pepper and Emeril's Original Essence Seasoning and a sprinkling of seasoned bread crumbs.

The cream cheese I used wasn't totally softened so it didn't blend as well as I would have liked but this recipe was so much better than the one I made a month ago (an old family favorite w/o eggs and corn muffin mix using green peppers and swiss cheese).

It received rave reviews by the entire office at the Holiday Party!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was such a hit that the family wants me to make it for Christmas. The only tip I would offer would be to bake it for about 10 minutes less than called for and let the carryover heat finish it off. The original way was a little too dry. This way it stays really moist.

This recipe was a definate hit.  I made it for a family reunion and Thanksgiving dinner and both times I took home an empty dish.  Very, very good and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing this one, everyone loved it.

Totally awesome!!!! I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar in the recipe and 1 cup on top. I also baked it in an 8X8 pan cuz we wanted it thick and I baked it for 30 minutes and 25 minutes with the cheese on top. This is a keeper for sure and we like it better then the other corn casserole without the cheese we always made from this site which we gave a 5 star also.

Althoough this recipe was extremely easy, I thought it had a rather bland taste, and I would probably not make it again.

What can I say in one word? "Delicious!" This was a croud pleaser for sure. I did add some ingredients and I used jalepeno corn bread mix instead of regular. I ended up addind green onion and half a red bell pepper for color and flavor. I think this enhanced the recipe in a good way for sure.

Oh my gosh this was soooooo good!!!! I couldn't get enough of it last night, I really could have eaten the whole pan!  This will definitely be my new go-to recipe for corn casserole.  Although, mine took longer to cook, about 10 minutes extra.  Thanks!

This was really good.  I had to cook it twice as long though.  45-50 minutes until it was golden brown and not liquid in the center.  I also put a bit more sour cream in and it was not a good idea.  Put only 8 ounces otherwise there is too much of a bite to it.  Otherwise, good consistency and very enjoyable!  We had it at Christmas dinner with ham and it was very well received.

very good, but I did make a slight change...added a can of chopped green chiles as we like to kick it up a notch. Great with so many things, guests all kept commenting on how great it was.

I was looking for a recipe that reminded me of the one my aunt always made for the holidays, but this wasn't it at all. Judging from the recipe alone I would say that it came out too doughy, I definitely wouldn't put the same amount of corn bread mix.

Only had about 4oz of sour cream so I made up the difference with some ricotta. Apart from adding a bit of salt and pepper I made it as written, and it was a big hit, especially with my two little ones.  Wasn't as dry/cornbready as I was expecting. Next time I will halve the batter, and add some fresh diced jalapenos for Husband. Thanks!

This is a new tasty twist on corn! I started making this several years ago. It started out as a side dish for Easter dinner. My nephews liked it so much that it is requested as a side dish for EVERY holiday meal now! My oldest nephew begged his mom for months to make it until she finally asked for the recipe a 2nd time & made it for him!

This was a big hit for Thanksgiving.  Even my pickiest eater liked it.  I would suggest to bake for 35 minutes, add the cheese, then return to oven for 10 minutes.  I baked according to recipe and the cheese on top was a bit overdone.

I really love corn and cheese so I decided to make this recipe. I didnt add the onion, and instead of cheddar I used colby jack. I read reviews and people said that it was bland. So I added salt and pepper to the mixture. It still came out with barely any flavor. I didnt like this recipe.

This was pretty good and I'd do it again!  I added a couple things to bring a little bit more savory flavor to it (added some salt, fresh cracked pepper, smoked paprika, and garlic powder).

The taste was EXCELLENT. Made it for family dinner and everyone loved it. I felt it was a little on the soggy side, so i might add a little more dry ingredients, and I support the adding of some salt. I also added a Jalapeno and it gave it a pleasant kick.

I didn't really care for this recipe much.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 14 oz cans of corn, and the whole thing turned out kind of bland.  Maybe a little salt would have helped... not sure if it would have made enough of a difference for us to love it though.  Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

Very good! I doubled the recipe but only had 1 can of creamed corn and it still worked wonderfully!  I also used frozen corn instead of canned.  I didn't have enough sour cream when I doubled it so I used cream cheese instead and it was sooo delicious!  Everyone loved it!

Great starter recipe. I added cream cheese and extra cheddar cheese for more flavor. I will use this recipe again.

I have made this recipe over and over again and it is always a huge hit.  If you feel like you need extra flavor try adding the mexican mix of cheddar.

I make this dish every year for Thanksgiving. It goes great with the green bean casserole that is always there. It is always a hit! I leave out the sour cream and I sweat the onions first so it is more like bread, and the kids will eat it.

This was a good alternative to a standard corn sidedish.  My husband & our guests loved it!  I cooked it a little longer than the recipe recommended because I was baking another dish at the same time.  Turned out yummy!

I loved it. I took other viewers advice and decreased time by 10 minutes and it was very moist. Next time I will add all the cheese inside and none on top and add more than it required, I love cheese.

I did not add the onions.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and added jarred jalapenos.  Easy, quick, and delicious.  What a great side dish to have with turkey.

I have never attempted to make a corn casserole ever, and this was extremely simple, and everyone at the Thanksgiving table LOVED IT!!!!  My husband is from Wisconsin, (as we know how they love cheese, LOL), and him and his family loved it!  I'm making it for our Christmas together because they requested that as my side dish to pass!  All I did was add extra cheese to the recipe for baking, and extra for the topping, and it turned out fantastic!  And, I even made the recipe doubled, and it came out perfect!  Enjoy!!

I make a very similar version of this.  Everyone thinks it is the best corn casserole ever.  The sour cream makes everything moist, and how bad can anything be with lots of cheese?!

Note - I never measure the cheese.  I put in a liberal amount of shredded cheese with the casserole, and top it with as much as I think it needs at the end.  

This beats opening a plain old can of corn any day!

Very BLAND. Followed the recipe, it was easy & the presentation was nice, but it was sorely lacking in flavor. Could really use some pizazz. I wouldn't make it again, but if someone is going to try it, try adding minced jalepenos, maybe some red pepper, etc.

I liked this recipe alot.  It couldn't be easier to prepare.  My personal suggestion would be allowing it to cool considerably, or serving it as a cold casserole.  My husband doesn't like "sweet" dishes that aren't intended as dessert, so this wasn't to his tastes.  But it suited mine just fine!

I made this a second time. I tried it once more time because the editor of Allrecipes.com corrected their mistake of omitting what to do with the muffin mix the first time. Fixed correctly, it turned out OK, although I do think if I made it again I would add less muffin mix and maybe double-up on the corn.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. It didn’t set up. It turned out more like a spoon pudding sort of like a underdone bread pudding. It Tate’s good so will still have it with my chili but wouldn’t recommend it. Sorry.

I love corn casserole, & this did not disappoint. I doubled it, but only had 1 can of creamed & 14 Oz of sour cream. And didn’t measure the cheese...just did a couple handfuls in the casserole, then thoroughly sprinkled the entire top with cheese halfway through. Was delicious. I took it to a youth group supper for my kids, and the teens scraped the dish clean. Will definitely make again!

Even if you don't like corn this is terrific tasting casserole.  It's a hit at all my family get together s.  I do not put onions in my recipe but substitute it with onion powder.

It’s kind of bitter for some reason. I like corn casserole sweet. Maybe it was the light sour cream and the reduced fat cheddar not sure...

This is a great recipe.  I do make a couple adjustments.  I use 1 cup cottage cheese instead of the sour cream, and I sauté the onions in 3 Tbs butter and pour onion/butter mixture into batter before baking.  I come back to this again and again.  Great with bbq pork.

I've had varied versions of this before.  Never with onion and without butter.  SO GOOD!!!

Doubled the recipe with the exception of the corn.  I used 2 cans of drained whole kernal and only 1 can of creamed corn and stuck with the one small onion.  HIGHLY recommend sweet Vidalia onion.  Cook time  is a solid hour.  I mixed all the cheese into the casserole rather than adding some to the top.  I did rotate 180* half through, but my oven needs it.

Next time I think I will swap a can of whole kernal for some Glory Foods canned yellow squash and onions!

It's a very simple recipe and is good in a pinch. You can't miss with this casserole. I would add something to give it more flavor for company but I like it the way it reads. I like it for holidays because of all the other dishes you have to make, you can throw this together lickety split. No worries.  :p

Loved it and will make it again. Cooked in a crock and cooked it longer and lower to make sure the middle was done.

I made a lot it was very good. My biggest mistake I brought more cream corn thinking it was whole kennel corn. So, make sure you check the items needed before leaving the store. I add some frozen spinach and chopped tomatoes.  Delicious!

This was good, although I couldn't taste the cheese at all in it. But maybe it's not supposed to stand out. Either way,  it was good and my boyfriend who is a big corn fan really liked it.

The overall consistency was good, however, the onions need to be cooked prior to adding.  Without cooking the onions prior to adding they ruin the dish.

Yet another recipe that calls for raw onion. Even though the onion cooked in the oven for 40 or so minutes it still had a bite to it. I don't know why but that just bugs me!! Overall this casserole was just ok. There was something that just didn't sit with me well but it might just be a taste preference.

I have been looking for a good, easy corn casserole for years. This is it! I made a double recipe, came out wonderful. Cooked it for at least an hour. Didn't put cheese on top, put lots in casserole. Used southwestern cornbread mix and some extra spices. Several of the comments were concerned about the dryness of the dish.  Just in case, I went ahead and added a couple of tablespoons of mayo. It turned out just perfect! I WILL be making this again!

Great recipe, so easy to make.   It comes out moist and tasty.  I use more cheese than the recipe calls for, maybe double, and my kids love it.  When their friends come over, I'm often asked to provide the recipe to their moms!

My friend Mary made this and brought it to my Halloween party last weekend and I wanted to sit down and eat the entire thing myself! This is one of those dishes that you take a bite and it is so delightful you almost want to burst into tears of joy! Very satisfying dish. I'm all about flavor and this not only had flavor but it had goody goodness and a bit of crunch as well! This is one of my new fall favorites. I wonder if you could kick it up a notch by adding a bit of thyme and or a little beer?

I had fresh corn leftover from corn on the cob, I used that.  I added generous salt and pepper and sprinkled paprika on the top before baking.  Really yummy, I will definitely make this again.

One of the many reasons that this is one of my family's favs as well as mine is because it is pretty resilient if you bobble it--too wet--cook it longer--10 minutes before time don--check it--if dry--stop the cooking--got 10 oz sour cream left or even 12--dump it in--used you 9"x13" panns already--I used a smaller deeper pan and cooked a little longer--I like my cornbread a tad sweeter so I add 2 Tblsp. of sugar--seldom can anyone mess this recipe up--Oh--substituting an 11 oz can of shoepeg corn works well as do the larger amounts (14 oz) that someone else suggested.  Occasionally I will ad a little melted butter or omit onion (daughter doesn't like onion)--also recipe is quite adaptable if you have the ingredients and are also cleaning out frige-once I added 6 oz cheddar-2 torn up slices of Gouda, some Havarti and three slices of extra sharp cheddar on top--this recipe is amazing--Love it

This was the best corn casserole recipe I could find that incorporated cheese, and it was A HIT!  I'm sure the recipe would be just fine exactly as is, but I just added an extra egg, doubled the cheese, added about 1/4 cup sugar, and a bit of green onion.  I feel the extra cheese was pretty necessary.  The sugar make it taste a little bit more like corn cake, which everyone loved.  And the green onion just gave it a bit more flavor.  Overall EXCELLENT.

This was a hit out Thanksgiving! For the most part I followed the recipe ...I did not put the cheese on the top of it (just in it) and I also added a can of green chilis. Oh, I also added a dash of garlic powder. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

Cooking time was no where near enough.  It took about 1hour for mine to cook.  I agree is was bland.  
Hint - If yours tastes gritty the cornbread is not cooked enough.  Cooking it longer will get rid of some of the grittiness.  Or it might have needed more moisture if it's gritty and dry.  I cut back the sour cream and added milk and it worked out okay.

Great recipe and really easy to make. I have tried other corn casseroles that call for butter and come out super soupy and greasy. This one is creamy and delicious!

I've made this twice and i changed the recipe just a little bit the second time.  I added some jalapenos to it and it really disappeared at a church dinner.  I may actually make it for the christmas dinner too.

I loved this - didn't change a thing on the recipe.  I've made twice now and both times have came out perfect.  I think I'm going to try adding some jalapeno's next time and give it more of a jalapeno cornbread - yum!!!!!

We were disappointed in this dish. It was soupy and we could still taste the gritty corn bread mix. I made a honey ham and wanted something to compliment it. This wasn't it. We each ate was served and then pitched the rest.
