Very nice, simple recipe for cake mix cookies.  I used 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and skipped the almonds (I didn't have any).  They baked to a perfect not-too-soft/not-too-crispy cookie in 9 minutes as stated.

E-Z and good looking, that about sums up these cookies.  Funny enough I had bits and pieces of nuts to use up in my cupboard and this recipe helped me do it.  Next time I would add a teaspoon of vanilla.  These lacked a little punch for me, but still they got gobbled up in no time.  I'll keep this beautie!

These were fantastic. It took about 5 minutes to get everything put together, and they baked up beautifully. They didn't spread or rise much, and they took a bit longer to bake than the recipe said (about 12 minutes), but they are delicious!

Wow, my parents said these were the best chocolate chip cookies they've ever had. Even though all the nuts I had were walnuts. I wasn't crazy about the cookies, so I'd give them four stars but I'll bet they taste better when you make them with the right kind of nuts. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using it again!

These were very good cookies. I made them exactly as written. (Not knowing whether to use salted or unsalted butter, I used the "sweet cream salted" butter I had on hand.)
I baked these for the full 11 minutes, but I thought maybe another minute or two might have been better. Also, my yield was only 17 cookies instead of the full "2 dozen" written, because I tend to make cookies too big.
I only have one minor complaint, though. I thought there were way too many almonds to top the cookies. 3/4 cup was far too much to cover the tops of 17 cookies (maybe 1/3 cup would have been enough in my case), so I can imagine that 3/4 cup is still too much for 24 cookies. But all in all these were very tasty cookies - I managed to make them last me for 4 days instead of just 1!

Delicious! I made a small change - instead of rolling the balls in the almonds, I added sliced almonds to the batter itself.  Everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

These were a hit at our superbowl party.  I added a dash of milk and used peanut butter cups instead of chocolate chips.  They were great!!

These were pretty much gone before I was able to eat two myself. The only thing I did differently was add 1/4 cup water to the mixture, because without it my electric mixers were groaning under the stiffness of the batter. But otherwise great recipe! I seriously don't know how they were all eaten that quickly.

We made these with a French Vanilla cake mix, and omitted the nuts from half the batch, and put in 1/2 cup walnuts in the other half of the batch.  I thought the cookies without the nuts were way too sweet, but the nuts improved the other cookies.  None of the kids they were fed to complained about either set of cookies.  :)  It was a decent recipe to use available supplies (I'm out of baking soda).

This recipe was great! I was unsure what to expect using cake mix, but the cookies turned out lovely. Great in a pinch (I was out of flour.) I added coconut and peanut butter chips instead of almonds. Very creative recipe, thanks!

My husband has deemed these "the best cookies ever made!"
I made a few changes:
I used a triple chocolate mix instead of yellow cake, added 1/2 cup of water like someone else suggested, mixed in 1/2 cup of coconut and used butterscotch chips instead of the sugested add-ins. This recipe is not only easy and tasty, it's fluffy and wonderful!

If I could give 4 1/2 I would. Not THE best choc chip cookie recipe, but definitely very good. I wanted to make pecan pie bars, but realized I didn't have corn syrup and had already started the recipe, so this worked instead. I only used pecans. I prefer totally from scratch cookies, but these would work in a pinch for sure:)

these turned out to be a waste of some expensive nuts. i've tried another cookie recipe from a cake mix and hubby loved it - but these  surprisingly had no flavor for all the ingredients that went in them. i will not make these ever again.

WOW!  I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use for a cookie exchange for the holidays that still tasted great.  I tested this one out on my family tonight and they love them!!!  I did not use any nuts because my family does not care for them, but they still turned out fine.  I used DH Classic Yellow Cake Mix with mini chocolate chips.  Also I made some with peanut butter chips and some with both chips mixed togther.  Everyone loved all the different types!  This was easy and fun!!  I am sure it will be a hit with the 288 that I have to bake for the exchange!!
