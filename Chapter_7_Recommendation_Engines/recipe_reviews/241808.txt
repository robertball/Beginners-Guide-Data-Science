This stew was amazing! I made a few modifications... added salt & pepper to taste, one onion and 1 tsp of corn starch to thicken. I also cooked mine in the slow cooker for 7 hours (on low) and the depth of flavor was awesome. Would definitely recommend the slow cooker if time allows. Not to mention, it made my condo smell delicious.

I made this to take to a pot luck. I followed the recipe except I used frozen peas and I did not precook my rice and I used chicken legs that I had in the freezer.. This was delicious and the emptied the pot. If you don't precook the rice it will thicken the stew and you won't need to use corn starch. I will be making this again for sure.

I tried this recipe for the Spring Bling event that I am participating in with this recipe of Chicken Stew. I and everyone else think it should a soup instead of a stew.  If I were to make it again I would use frozen peas instead of canned and I would name the dish  Chicken Vegetable Medley which is more appropriate for this type of meal. It is good otherwise.

This was delicious and satisfying for my entire family. I did make a few changes in order to avoid a trip to the store. The initial 4c of liquid was split between water and broth, for flavor. When I added all ingredients to pot, I subbed rosemary, black pepper, and no-salt seasoning in for bay leaves. I added spices again at halfway point. I simmered for 1hr 30m and the liquid had disappeared so I added 2c broth at the same time as the rice and all was good after the last 15m of summer time. Tastes like autumn!

Absolutely delicious! I think I brought it to a boil a little bit too fast though because my chicken did not end up coming out shredded. I'm not sure, but I believe if you bring it to a boil a little more slowly, really letting it take it's time, then the chicken might come out a little more shredded?  Either way the chicken was tender and delicious. I changed the recipe and added frozen peas, increased chicken to almost 2 lbs of chicken breast chopped, and added one chicken bouillon cube.  It was scrumptious, and it did come out as a stew. I will definitely be making this again.  I would add a picture except the picture just looks like… well, chicken stew.  Nothing to look at but definitely something to taste!

This one is a real keeper. I did tweak it a bit...added a cup of chopped onions, a couple of dashes of garlic powder, some salt and pepper. The leftovers were even better.

I made this using leftover turkey. I added additional spices, replaced 8 oz of water with a can of cream of mushroom soup, and omitted the rice. Scrumptious

This dish is a scrumptious flavorful stew.  The addition of sweet potato adds a wonderful dimension of taste.  A touch of sweet to a savory dish!  It's quick and easy, give it a try!

Delicious, I will definitely make it again. I added balsamic vinegar and turmeric to intensify the flavours.

Can’t say I was a fan.  No flavor by following the recipe.  I added salt, pepper, onion but I still think I’ll make this again. Not a favorite

Very easy and very tasty.  I followed some of the other recommendations (used chicken broth instead of water, added a teaspoon of pepper and rosemary for seasoning).  I also added a chopped onion and a little minced garlic to the vegetables.  I used 1/2 cup of uncooked multi grain rice to the broth while it simmered.  It turned out perfect, the stew was just the right thickness and it was delicious.

This made a very hearty stew. I modified it slightly using all chicken broth instead of water, plenty of salt and pepper as well as rosemary and thyme.   It was delicious.

It needs some help.  Was bland.  Used chicken stock instead of water.  Added a generous amount of salt and pepper.  And it still had little flavor.  Maybe sautéed onion?  Or more spices?  I needed to add a cornstarch slurry to make it stew-like.  Otherwise it was soup.

Delicious!!  Added fresh rosemary, mushrooms, pepper and onion. Used chicken stock instead of water and 1 can of diced tomatoes. Excellent flavor.
