YUMMY! Just make sure the cream cheese is softened or it will be difficult to mix! Made it in a 9 x 13 pan -that worked well. Makes a lot and is very filling so I froze 1/2 of it just fine.

Nice change for breakfast.  I didn't have any green onions, so i skipped those.  I think it would have been nice with them but I don't think I would add the whole cup.  The only other changes I made were to cut some calories.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, replaced half of the eggs with egg beaters and used skim milk.  It was more egg-like and I was expecting more of a bread consistency, but it was still very good.  It makes alot.  I made 2 loaves and 9 muffins. (if you make muffins...don't fill it too far, when it rises the egg spills over the top)UPDATE:  Because it is titled "bread" I(without thinking) treated it as a bread and stored it in ziplock bags and plastic wrap and put it in the bread box--2 days later it was DISGUSTING!!!(rotton & molded)  Store this in the refrigerator.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but the green onions are too much.  Next time I will leave them out.  My bread fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan.  Next time I will let it cool for 10 minutes before I try and remove.

What a creative recipe!  It definately makes more than a Bundt pan. I used the leftover batter to fill a greased muffin tin and ended up with not only a phenomenal breakfast quiche-like bread, but individual muffin-size serving as well.  KEEPER!!!

This is an unqualified hit!  The only difference I use is: I read it wrong the first time and added the bisquick to the milk and eggs.  Worked fine.  I get a bundt pan and a loaf pan from this recipe.  I usually freeze the loaf pan. The bundt pan makes a beautiful presentation for guests.  Thanks for sharing Mary!

Followed directions exactly.... except I halved the recipe and used 2 bread pans.  The taste was great!  The texture was of a heavy moist bread.  I will probally make this again, we served this with peach smoothies.

I love breakfast casseroles, but this one was lacking something. The texture was a bit doughy and the flavor was a bit bland. I served it with salsa to add some oomph. I did have to substitute chives for the green onions because that was all I had. It took a bit of coaxing to get it out of my well oiled bundt pan too. Not a bad recipe, but not one I will repeat. Too bad, because it looked lovely for serving.

I tried this as is...and it was ok. I made some changes and tweaked and this is how I found it to be the best. 1. I ommitted the cream cheese all together. I added an extra cup of shreded cheese and 3 extra eggs. I also made this once in my muffin tin and it was great this way. I froze the muffins and now I can pull on out and microwave it real quick and have quick hot breakfast

I did not like this bread at all.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and it did not turn out because it was not done.  It looked wonderful, smelled great, the top was all golden and appeared to be done.  When I turned it out on the plate it was a gooey mess in the middle.  I did pick around the egde to taste it-- I didn't care for it.

This was good.  I will make it again, but it took almost twice as long to cook as it was supposed to.  Also, it's very dense, I think next time I'll make it in a casserole dish...it stuck to the sides of my bundt pan.

I add a can of diced green chilis, diced red peppers and only use 2 and a half cups of milkthis really makes it great! On the baking time, this is very good however you have to bake it about 20 minutes longer than it says for it to get done unless you make it into breakfast muffins then decrease the time to about 23-27 minutes, depending on your oven.

The flavor is GOOD but my toothpick came out clean but when I turned it over on my rack...egg mixture poured out all over my counter. I baked about another hour and then enjoyed! (BTW, I used Pamela's GF baking & pancake mix for the baking mix!)

Smelled wonderful, but not enough flavor. A cross between bread and quiche. I halved the recipe and used 2 loaf dishes, cooked perfectly in 40 minutes.

This looked great when I read the recipe, but as much as I love cream cheese I won't put it in again. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I couldn't add that, but next time I'll be sure to add cheddar, salt and pepper and definitely OMIT the cream cheese.

I am happy with this one.  I did tweak.  I used full amount of sausage and halved everything else.  Left out the green onions and added my own seasoning.  Came out just the right size and perfect.!

I made this for breakfast Sunday morning. It took a lot longer than 45 minutes to bake. Cut into it and the center was still runny in the middle. Returned it to the oven for an additional 30 minutes. My family was disappointed with the flavor. Maybe some syrup would help.
