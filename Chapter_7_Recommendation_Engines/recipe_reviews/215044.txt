I have had this salad without the arugula or cheese, and it was so delicious!  I can't wait to see how it tastes according to this recipe!

I love this, a couple things I did different were; I couldn't find just arugula, so I used a spring mix bag salad, and with the dressing I put about a quarter of a pack of Splenda in it, just to sweeten it up a little. Great salad.

Amazing!  The subtle sweetness of the watermelon mixed with the creaminess of the feta and tangy dressing-the flavors truly compliment each other.

My 12 year old daughter had a sample of this at Publix and asked me to make it.  It's wonderful!  So fresh, delicious and EASY.

Used crumbled feta cheese - Didn't use onions or tomatoes
Use dressing as described and 11/2 cups arugula

I really had my reservations about this recipe but had a watermelon that needed to be addressed as well as a plethora of cherry tomatoes in my garden.  I happen to have feta cheese in the house too.  My only change was to use baby romaine mix and sweet white onion.  I will make this salad again.  Thanks!

I cook for a very large group of people and eat happy that we had the ingredients to make this for the salad bar. After dinner I got the feed back of this recipe and they hated it. ugh.. The didn't like the feta in it at all and thought I was crazy for making it. sorry this one was a fail, not one good feedback.

This was a light and refreshing salad. The variety of flavors made it tasty, and I really enjoyed the dressing. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of water produced by the melon - it left a liquidy pool in the bowl and caused the feta to become mushy. (I understand this is just natural because it's made with watermelon.) Next time, I will do as directed and serve immediately... and tell people not to let it sit.
