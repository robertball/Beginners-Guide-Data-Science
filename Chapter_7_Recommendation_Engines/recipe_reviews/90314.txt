I loved this recipe. To start with I much prefer brownish gravy to the white milk gravies for most country-fried steak. Secondly I don’t know where others get their cube steak but the cube steak I get is slashed up with the mechanical tenderizer but NEVER seems to be that tender. Recipes that call only for breading it, browning it, then pour gravy over it, always leave me with nothing but a tough, breaded piece of meat with gravy on top. (Our cube steak isn’t that cheap to waste on poor cooking either.) I live in the South where people make Country Fried Steak all the time. The best, most tender, (homemade) versions of the dish that I’ve had are ALWAYS simmered in the gravy like this recipe. I’ve simmered before too but still it was not “melt in your mouth” tender and kind of bland. I was intrigued to try this recipe with the smaller pieces of steak trick to see if it helped. It does immensely! I pretty much went by the recipe. I cut my steak into strips. Also the onion soup is a nice rich starter flavor instead of just plain meat gravy from drippings only. The smaller pieces tend to soak up more of the gravy flavor than the big steak size pieces too. I sautéed some fresh onions and some canned mushrooms to add to the gravy and give it a little more home cookin’ restaurant quality depth. I simmered this for closer to two hours on very low heat, stirring and adding water as needed. Very tasty and tender. From now on this is MY Country Style Steak too.

I had some cube steaks that had spent way too long in my freezer.  I hate to tell how long they have been in there.  This recipe did an excellent job of rendering my elderly cube steaks palatable.  I just chopped off the freezer burned part and gave it to the neighbor's dog. (He's still alive so far.) The only thing I did different was to deglaze the pan with a little two-buck chuck Cabernet Savignon before adding the onion soup mix.  And I threw in a blob of minced garlic.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and substituted one cup of milk (I only had fat-free) for one cup of the water.  This was absolutely delicious served with garlic mashed potatoes and Smothered Green Beans from this site.

Excellent.  My boyfriend had asked that I make cube steak ... but I was up against his recollections of how his now-departed mom had made it! Apparently I came close.  One caution, though: I have a low tolerance for saltiness, and the salt in the soup mix was enough; I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt (because that's what I had), and it was still plenty salty!

Best use of cubed steak I've found. Comes out fork tender.  I used garlic powder not garlic salt, and made the gravey with 1-1/2 tblsp flour, 2 cups water and one cup milk. It was not at all salty to me made this way, and I liked the extra gravy.

This was great.  Thanks Mandy Sue for the recommendation.  I left the steaks whole and seasoned the flour that I coated them in with some Mrs. Dash Mesquite Grill Seasoning.  And the only onion soup mix I had was with mushrooms so I used that.  If I had fresh or canned I would have addede those in too.  Oh well, there's always next time.  Thanks SUZANNER.  I am sure I will make this again.

This interesting variation on cube steak was good served with mashed potatoes.  To control the saltiness, mentioned by another reviewer, I only used 1/2 envelope of dry onion soup mix, and omitted the garlic salt as well as salt and pepper.  I didn't feel that it needed to cook 1 hour because cube steak is tenderized and cooks so quickly.

We thought this was just great!  I was surprised at how good it was thinking that a poor little cube steak would be cooked to death for an hour.  I cut the steaks into thirds and used the garlic powder instead of salt.  Also took the meat out at the end and thickened the gravy a little more with another TBS of flour and 1/4 C water.  Was wonderful with mashed potatoes and green beans on the side.  We'll have it often I'm sure.

This is one of my husbands favorite comfort foods. It reminds him of a dish his mother made when he was little.  The gravy is wonderful served over mashed potatoes and we liked it with sauteed mushrooms and green beans. Go easy on the salt though...We actually  omitted the salt b/c the sodium from the onion soup mix was all our family needed. I sliced up onions and baked it instead of cooking it stovetop. Either way...great meal.

This was an easy recipe to put together and very tasty!  I added some garlic powder and pepper to the flour before coating the meat.  I also left the cube steaks whole since I had some extra time to let them simmer longer.  After reading other's reviewers comments I decided to make a little extra gravy for the potatoes, so, I used 1-1/2 tbs of flour and 1-1/2 packs of onion soup mix.   After browning I used just a little red wine to deglaze the pan and add a little richness.  We like our gravy a little creamier - so I used about 1-1/2 cups of water and 1 cup of 2% milk (what we had). If you like a brown gravy - stick with the water.   I did not add any additional salt or garlic salt since I knew the onion soup mix was very salty on its own.  After whisking together to make the gravy I added the steaks back, covered them and let them simmer for about 1-1/2 hours.  I then took the lid off and let them simmer for another 1/2 hour to help thicken the sauce.  If the gravy is too thin you can remove the steaks, turn the heat up and add a little cornstarch dissolved in cold water to thicken.  Mine was a good consistancy though so I didn't need it this time.  The meat was fork tender and had good flavor. The gravy was still a little salty to me, but, my husband really liked it.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and baby peas.  It was good comfort food on a chilly night and different way to make cube steak other than country fried steak with white gravy that has a lot more fat.

i thought it had plenty of flavor, just might not have been what i was feeling on that particular night... was easy to fix and all the ingredients i had on hand... will make again and since i have to be in the mood for the onion soup flavor, ill use brown gravy like one reviewer said.  definitely worth keeping and toying with some or leave it as is.. good either way... now ive got to invest in a new frying pan so all the breading doesnt come off when my steak bits are cooking lol.  thanks for the recipe.

My husband loved this one. He is a very picky eater, who thinks no one can outdo his mom in the kitchen. This is one recipe that he said tops his mothers! Music to my ears!

This was really great on a cold winter night. I had all of the ingredients on hand. I served over baked baby potatoes and used only 2 cube steaks totaling .75 lbs. It was just enough for my family of 4 (6 and 8 year old kids and parents). What a great way to stretch a small amount of meat. Came out very tender and flavorful.

This was great! However, I did make a few adjustments. I didn't use onion soup mix, I used fresh cut onions along with a brown gravy mix. Therefore you dont need to add the flour to the gravy. With doing that, my gravy turned out perfect in color, texture, and taste. Great recipe though. Thanks

Very easy and enjoyable meal.  I followed the recipe as written with only a couple of excpetions suggested by another reviewer.  I used 1/2 low-fat milk and 1/2 water and increased the liquids to total 3 cups so there was lots of gravy.  I also added a can of sliced mushrooms.  I didn't add salt due to the onion soup mix and used garlic pepper as the seasoning.  Since I increased the liquids, it propaply could have used a little more salt, but then again, we like salt.  We served this over mashed potatoes, which was the perfect accompanyment.   Our veggie of choice was green beans.  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing.  Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I may add a bit of Worchestershire Sauce and a sprinkle of hot pepper such a cayenne because we enjoy those flavors and the bit of heat.  Thank you for sharing.

I've made this several times and I make it in the crockpot!   I cut each piece of cube steak in half (if the pieces are too small, they just break apart).  I dust each piece with flour and quickly sear/brown the meat in a couple of Tablespoons of cooking oil.  Then (directly in the crockpot), I mix 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup with 2 bottles of Beef Gravy & 1/2 envelope of dry onion soup mix (a whole envelope makes it too salty!).   Add the browned meat, submerging it in the gravy and cook on Low for 6-8 hours.   Before serving, remove the steak to a plate & cover to keep warm.  Heat the pan drippings (from when you browned the meat), add several Tablespoons of flour & brown it.  Then stir in the thin gravy out of the crockpot to thicken it.  Makes a delicious, rich gravy and fall-apart tender Country-Style Steak!!    Wonderful!

Wow! I think I've bought cubed steak once as I've been afraid of the quality.  Seemed like something from the school cafateria "mystery meat" counter.  My husband was looking for more after we finished.  My daughter ate it in 10 seconds flat.  PERFECT with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  Economical, easy and it looked like I put a lot of work into a decent looking/tasting dinner.  Huh!  Who knew?  I'm going back to the store for their sale on cubed steak to stock up.  Oh, and don't even think of changing a thing in the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe except instead of adding water I used a can of low sodium chicken broth.  Tasted great.  Next time I will add mushrooms and fresh onions too.

Very good recipe!  Thanks Mandy Sue for the recommendation, we really enjoyed this and it was so easy to prepare.  The only changes I made were to leave the steaks whole, omit the garlic salt, and I added a little milk to the gravy.  This is something I will definately make again, thanks for the recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this turned out to be. I used onion gravy mix instead of soup (didn't have any) and didn't add the extra flour and used garlic powder instead of salt. The cube steaks were tender and tasty.

This was wonderful. My fussy boyfriend even liked it and wanted more.  He told me the next time I make it to double the recipe so we could have it again the next day!  It reminded me a lot of my grandma’s country steak – or as she called it: “Cube steak and gravy”.  The only thing I did differently was to replace one of the cups of water with a cup of milk.  I also added about 1/4 cup more water about half way through the cooking time. My gravy was getting a bit too thick. I also seasoned the steaks before I fried them with salt and pepper. The steaks were tender and the onion soup mix gave the gravy excellent flavor. Great recipe! I plan to make it again soon!

Very delicious!  So flavorful from the onion soup mix.  I added onions and mushrooms to mine and that added a nice touch.

Yummy!  The only thing I did different was to slice an onion into the skillet before I started to simmer and  add a little milk and cornstarch to the gravy after about 30 minutes.  The non-meat eating daughter loved it.  We had it with roasted veggies and yukon gold mashed potatoes!  This is definitely a keeper!

Very good. I did add some red wine to the mix, let it cook down. Wow, served over rice. Great quick dinner.

Thank you for this recipe!  I make this at least once a month now because it is just so tasty and everyone in my family loves it!  Occasionally I like to change it up a bit and add a can of condensed golden mushroom soup or cream of mushroom.  Makes for a rich, flavorful gravy and I usually freeze the leftover gravy to add to future beef stews!

Wonderful way to use cube steak.  I love the idea of cutting them into smaller pieces because I usually have to cook the life out of them to get them tender, but this was quick and easy.  I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt since I don't like very salty dishes and I used some milk instead of water as another suggested.  Turned out wonderful.  Thanks for submitting this one!

My husband loves Country Style Steak. I never made it often because I thought mine tasted sort of bland. This was great. Smaller pieces of meat definitely made it more tender. The onion soup mix made wonderful tasty gravy. I did not find it too salty, but I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I will certainly make it more often now that I found this recipe. Thanks Suzanner

Yummy! What I did to make my cubed steak more tender was after it browned I placed them in a foil lined baking sheet (making a tent) in a 250 degree oven for 35 minutes. After making the gravy as noted I placed the steaks back in the gravy pan and served....

This was great...the closest to "made from scratch" country-stle steak this southern girl has tasted.  I did omit the garlic, and I used 1 c. water and 1 c. 2% milk rather then 2 c. water, which gave a little richer flavor.  My gravy was very thick, so I will add a bit more milk next time.  Also, I added a bit of water to the pan after removing the meat and before putting in the soup mixture because I had no liquid left, just nice brown bits from browning the meat.  This helped lift the brown bits and dissolve the soup mix, and worked very well.  Next time, I'll start with a bit more oil.  I did cut the meat into large bite-size pieces before flouring, and it was very tender.  Actually, this was my first endeavor with country-style steak...and this recipe is a definite keeper!  I served it on rice with a side of asaparagus and some nice oven-baked rolls.

First you need to know that my Mom made cube steaks all the time when I was growing up and I HATED them so much that I have not eaten one since Dec 1989 when I moved out. Now 17 years later I'm out of work and on a budget and the grocery store had cube steaks on sale so I was like I can find some recipe on line to make these almost edible and to my surprise this recipe was WONDERFUL! I will be making these again that is for sure.

WOW!  Great recipe.  This was my first time using cubed steaks.  I've never known what to use them with before.  So here is what I did;  I kept the steaks whole and after frying them and putting the gravy together according to the recipe, I threw everything in my crockpot and let it cook on low for 2 hours...it was amazing.  The steaks melted in your mouth!

This had decent flavor, but had to tweak it a bit, hence the 4 stars. I used london broil (bc it's so lean) and I had to use it before it went bad. Instead of water, I used half beef stock and half red wine to give the gravy some depth. The addition of red wine gave the gravy a rich, deep color and helped to tenderize a cheap piece of meat. Next time I will use sirloin for more tender results. I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and steamed green beans with carrots. Yum!

This turned out really well. I was a little worried just by the look of the dish when it was finished cooking....dog food. But it sure didn't taste like it!!! I used beef broth instead of water and left out all the added salt due to the onion soup mix...it has a lot of salt already in it! I also used plain garlic and not garlic salt for that same reasoning...too much salt. :/ It says to simmer for 1 hour but I just couldn't wait that long...it smelled so good! We ate it 20 minutes early and it still turned out wonderfully tender and juicy. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green sweet peas! YUM! :)

I made this last night and the onion soup is a great idea but the end result is way too salty!  I didn't even add additional salt & what I thought was going to be "planned" overs tonight were inedible.  I should have stuck to Momma's tried and true recipe.

A nice, comforting easy weeknight meal.  Nothing special but will fill your stomach for sure.  I've made this three times already and served it with either mashed potatoes and buttered egg noodles.  Both are very good.  The last time I added sliced onions and mushrooms for a more filling meal.

This tasted really good, but I did not love the texture my gravy came out with.  It seemed like when I added the meat back to the gravy a lot of the flour that was cooked on the meat came off into the gravy and made it lumpy.  It tasted good enough I may try it again.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a hit.  The one thing I do differently is to lightly sprinkle both sides of the cube steak with Adolph's meat tenderizer and fork it a bit prior to cooking.  The meat is so tender after cooking it on low (275) for hours you can cut it with a fork.

I don't usually enjoy the consistency/toughness of cube steaks, but decided to try this recipe because of the many high ratings. This is the first time I have ever made cube steaks at home and I am very glad I tried it. These were surprisingly tender and very tasty!

I followed the recipe with two small changes: 1) substituted minced garlic for the garlic salt and 2) omitted the salt (to taste).

I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the first cube steak recipe I actually enjoy!

Enjoyed this very much.  The key is slicing the steak before cooking.  I actually used my kitchen shears rather than a knife to cut the meat.  Also, by slicing the steak I could fit all of it into my fry pan.  Sauce was good and thickened up well.  No complaints here.

Nice down home recipe. I made this recipe exactly as stated except for I had an onion dip mix packet so I used that and added extra pepper. I was worried because there was little to no juice in the pan (even though I cooked the meat on medium) so I added a tbsp of water when I added the flour and onion mixture. This created no problem. The meat turned out tender and the gravy was tasty. I look forward to making this again.

I am giving this four stars only because of the lack of aesthetic appeal. It looks pretty nasty...think cafeteria food. However, it tastes really good! Has a good country fried steak flavor. I think next time I might add some sliced onions and maybe some mushrooms. I served it over egg noodles.

My husband liked this so I will give it three stars but, I wasnt' a huge fan of this. It had the dullness of a tv dinner. Not sure what would make it better... Probably won't make this again.

Yep, slicing the cubed steak was the ticket.  Only way to go.

This is a great recipe.  I used cube steak for this recipe and it was a wonderful.  The gravy is awesome!!!!  This is simple and definitely comfort type food.  I made this with soymilk in lieu of water because I thought the gravy might be a little creamier and sweeter and it was.  I served with buttered potatoes and Okra, Corn,and Tomatoes from this site.

After reading reviews, I sauted the steaks after dipping them in the flour seasoned with 1/2 teas. each garlic powder, onion powder and seasoned salt. I used  garlic oil to saute the steaks, then removed and followed the recipe from there.  We thought the steaks were super tender and we could cut them with a fork but still felt the recipe needs more flavor.  Next time I will use beef boullion instead of water and add some worchestire to the sauce for more flavor.  I will try this again.

This was really simple and yummy! I used a can of Campbells french onion soup instead of the dry onion soup packet and I served it over egg noodles...I will definitely make it again.

This was a great way to cheat at gravy.  I normally brown my cube steaks whole.  I always try to follow recipes to exactly the first time.  So I cut up the meat into cubes.  I had to brown the meat in batches to ensure they browned properly.  After the third batch the remnants on the bottom of the pot began to stick.  I didnt want it to start burning so I rushed to brownt he last batch.  Of course that batch didnt get as crisp as I would have liked.  But you really couldnt tell in the end.  I am a pretty good cook so I dont think this was my error.  I still gave this recipe five stars because it came out tasting great and that was the only problem I came across.

This was ok. I should have read other reviews first. Then I would have used less soup mix. I would also use garlic powder instead of salt as it was a bit too salty. I may try it again with those changes.

This was another recipe that had to be adapted for my family.  I read all of the reviews prior to making it and it seemed unanimous that the salt content was high.  I used garlic powder in place of the salt (I didn't use any salt at all actually).  I also seasoned the flour with garlic salt and pepper prior to dusting the meat.  I loved the idea of cutting up the cube steak - it seemed to take up less room in the pan!  I did add fresh mushrooms, onions, and fresh garlic and extra beef stock to the gravy (we like gravy, so the addition of the beef stock to the water bulked up the amount of sauce).  Served it over egg noodles.  We will be making this one again.

This had excellent flavor! The one inch cubes didn't seem to cook all the way in an hour...they were still a little pink. Next time I will add three cups water for the gravy, the gravy cooked away after an hour and was pretty thick, but I may have had it at to high of a temp. I don't think that milk is necessary as previous posters have suggested. I will be added this recipe to my tried and true recipe book, just with an extra cup of water :)

We had this last night and it was really good.  I did make some changes...
First I had more meat but only one pack of Dry Onion soup.  I used Tastefully Simple Onion onion to add a little more oomph without as much salt.  I also didn't bother to dredge the meat first.  Instead  as the small pieces were browing in a little oil, I sprinkeled the flour on top and stired it up to coat.  Then added water and milk.

Yum, that was all I heard at dinner!  I don't care for the Lipton onion soup mix, so I changed that and used a package of dry Onion gravy mix.  It left the gravy lacking a little in flavor though, so to cure that, I added another cup of water with a dissolved beef bouillon cube in it!  Solved the problem and everyone devoured it.  Thank you for such a great and EASY way to prepare cube steak!  Oh, I mustn't forget, as someone else mentioned, do cut the cube steak into smaller pieces as it does give it more area to cook/tenderize.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I did change it up a bit, I added 1 can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and a little bit more water.  I let it cook over the lowest heat for about 2 hours.  It was great over rice with fresh aspargus on the side.  Thank you for this easy recipe.

This was really yummy!  My husband really enjoyed this dish.  I took others' advice and didn't add additional salt since the soup mix has plenty.  The leftovers made a great quick stroganoff (sauteed mushrooms, made a gravy from leftover sauce, beef stock, a little thickening and a last minute dollop of sour cream - served over noodles).  My husband RAVED about the leftover concotion - the meat was even more tender than the first time.  This dish is easy, versatile, and satisfying.  Thanks!

I made these last night and they were terrific.  My variation was.. I sliced up some onion and had some mushrooms, so I sauteed them separately and set aside,  I cut the cube steaks in smaller pieces and cooked as directed.  I made the gravy then added the steak, onions and mushrooms and put it in my electric fry pan on low for about an hour.  It was really good and my husband asked me for the leftovers for lunch.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe./

This was an awesome recipe. Modifications: I seasoned the flour to coat the steaks with garlic and onion powder, salt, pepper, and season salt. I saved this flour to make the gravy. Instead of the water I used beef broth. I sprinkled the onion soup into the pan, added the beef broth and eyeballed flour sprinkling it into the broth. After bringing the gravy to a boil, then I added cut up green peppers (I love green peppers with my cubed steak). Simmered the steak and peppers for about an hour. I made this with corn, mashed potatoes, and a cheesy pull apart butter and cheese biscuit bake. Huge success!

Made as per the recipe. No changes needed. Very yummy. I'd suggest doubling the recipe only because our family of 4 would've had seconds if we had had enough.  Made with sliced potatoes and green beans.

I've made this about 3-4 times since discovering it. I tweak it occasionally using ground beef and the cube steak. I prefer to use the beef onion soup mix flavor. yummy to eat on some jasmine rice :)

This was my first time making cube steaks in my life.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for subbing garlic powder for garlic salt, and it was perfect. Everyone just loved them!  We have had these at least 3 times since that first time.  Today is a busy day and I'm making a crockpot variation of this recipe; we'll see how it turns out!

I grew up on Cube steaks~ but Mom never made them taste this good! I was only cooking for 2, so I used 1/2 pkg. of lipton soup mix & 1 c water. I simmered the steaks(whole, not pieces)for an hour then added flour w/ milk to make gravy just before serving. The steaks were very tender & tasty! I don't think I'll make them any other way! Delish!

OK, after reading a good amt of reviews I coated steaks in flour seasoned with seasoning salt. I browned the steaks, removed from pan then put flour onion soup mix in and browned a bit. Deglazed that with a lil red wine then added 1 c heavy whipping cream and 1 c water to pan. I threw in 2 minced garlic cloves then put the steaks back in covered and simmered for almost an hour. It was great.  Cant wait to make again. I think I will add mushrooms next time

This was delicious!! Substituted 1 cup of milk for 1 cup of water and served over mashed potato with a side of green beans.

This was yummy. Served it over rice. Didn't have any leftovers. I did add a TB of garlic to the gravy and used a little garlic powder instead of garlic salt. That was the only change that I made. Will make again!

I am not a big fan of cubed steak, but my husband bought some so I had to try it. I have to say, it really wasn't bad at all, and my husband and daughter both went back for seconds. I didn't let it simmer as long as stated (because I didn't read it in advance & everything else was ready), and it still turned out delicious. Since my husband bought about 6 packs of cubed steak, I'll definitely be making this again.

I've always floured (with garlic, salt, and pepper) and browned my steaks whole and then cooked down onions in the drippings and then made a brown gravy with the drippings, but this is so much easier and tastes EXACTLY the same as my old recipe. Thank you for making my life easier!

Wonderful recipe. My husband doesn't like cube steak much. He says it's too tough but he loved it this way. The cube steak was tender and the flavor was great!

This was delicious! I agree with others about omiting the salt to taste, I think there was enough flavoring just with the onion soup mix and garlic.

Usually I try to follow recipes exactly so I can give a fair review but I did make a few changes. I used Kentucky Kernel seasoned flour instead of plain flour and along with the 2 cups of water I also used a can of beef consomme. Also when cooking my oil soaked right up so i added butter and to make a rouge with the onion soup mix and flour. I served it over rice since I had no potatoes and everyone loved it.

My husband loves this recipe. I don't use the oil and fry it whole in a non-stick pan. I also don't use 2 full cups of water, I just add it to the consistency I like. I think 2 full cups would be a little thin.

I made this "as is" except I did add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.  I didn't add salt because of some of the other reviews (I used garlic powder instead).  It was very tender and seasoned well.  We will be making this again!  I think hamburger patties cooked in this sauce would be very close to the Salsbury Steak dinners in the frozen food section.  Yummy!

I find that two cups of water is a little too much for me. But that's personal taste. I use this recipe but without the steak for sauce on my potatoes sometimes. It's amazing!

Excellent, easy recipe. I did chop an onion and sauted in olive oil. Instead of water, we added beef broth-might be a bit too salty that way. Will try 1 cup broth/1 cup water next time.

I used "fresh" home grown beef. It had little or no fat, so I didnt have alot of juices. I had to improvise with more water and flour. My husband and I devoured it.

Made this as written for my family last night and got rave reviews.  This is very close to my mom's old recipe only easier.  It is a quick prep.  I did use 2 lbs of meat, so I did have to add another TBS of oil.  Will be making this again.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was a keep per my husband.  I followed recipe except used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as the soup mix (I used beefy onioni) was plenty salty.  I used a ternderized cube steak from the store, browned in oil, prepared the gravy as directed, then add the meat into the gravy and let simmer for only 20 minutes.  It was very good, but would have been even better had I let it simmer longer, which I will do next time around.  This will be a keeper.

To say that this was a hit at my house would be an understatement.  Comments were, "this is the best gravy I've ever had!", "Honey, you hit a HOME RUN!" from the husband and kids, in fact they are fighting over the leftovers as I'm writing this.  I did modify a bit: kept steaks whole, added garlic powder and Montreal seasoning to the flour before drudging meat through it.  Also, to keep the gravy thicker, I added 1 cup of milk and only 1/2 cup of water and it was perfect.  Highly recommend.

Wow really easy and tasty!  Like others, extra salt beyond the soup mix is really uneccessary.  I forgot to cut the meat up so I was a bit worried it might not turn out as tender but it was perfect anyways!  Will definately make this one again.

Wonderful, easy recipe. I de-glazed the pan with some cheap red wine I had hanging around but followed the recipe to a "T" with that exception (and I didn't add any salt). This is a great dish that's easy to re-work based on personal taste. Five star winner for sure....(Hubby LOVED IT). Thanks for the great dinner tonight!

This was yummy. I followed the recipe exactly, and the meat was so tender! I had no idea cubed steak could be cut with a just a fork ...

This was ok. I let the mixture simmer for over an hour- I added mushrooms and sauted onions. Instead of the soup mix I used french onion soup. The taste was a little off and the meat was a funky texture. I will not make again but thanks for the recipe!

I get alot of venison cube steak from my dad and have never been a big fan, so it usually sits in my freezer.  I thought I would try again, and found this recipe to be the best cube steak I've ever tasted.  It was SO tender.  Did modify the recipe as follows for the pressure cooker:  After browning steak and removing from pressure cooker, I deglazed the pan with 1 cup water, added 1/2 package onion soup mix, returned cube steak to pan and cooked under pressure for 10 minutes.  Quick released pressure and added one cup milk to pan, heated to a simmer, stirring to combine until gravy thickened.

Pretty good. This was easy and used things I usually have on hand. I used beefy onion soup and ground sirloin. I used an egg wash to help the flour adhere. I added a little bread crumbs and a tiny bit of season all to the flour. I only simmered the meat patties in the gravy for 10 min. My husband wasn't too impressed with this recipe, but I liked it and my son had two servings. Thanks, this was a nice comfort meal.

Loved this recipe.  I also cooked the cube steaks whole. I added about 1/2 cup of milk, 1 can drained mushrooms, and 1 Tbsp. flour to the gravy. This turned out great.  We will be using this recipe again!I have also used brown gravy mix in place of the onion soup mix.

My family loved this!! The meat turned out super super tender.  The gravy was great on mashed potatoes.  Very easy to make too.  I served with mashed potatoes, steamed carrots, and steamed  broccoli. This will definately get made around here again.

Eh, not that great.  The steak was still tough and didn't have much flavor to it and the gravy in the end was way too watery so I added some cornstarch mixed with water.  Again, not that great.

Made it just as stated in recipe and was very impressed with the flavor.  I cooked it on low longer for about 3 hours and it could be cut with a fork.  My kids enjoyed it too with mashed potatoes.

We were looking for a different way to fix cube steak and this was delicious!  Even the kids liked it.  There wasn't a ton of gravy left over to serve over mashed potatos but it was the perfect amount for the steaks.  I think this would also be good without cutting the cube steaks up.  For us, this was ready in a little less than an hour.  It's a keeper!

Terrific recipe!  I doubled the recipe to feed my crew.  Substituted 1 can evaporated milk for some of the water and added a sliced onion & some beef broth.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

this was super quick and easy, we loved it! i halved recipe for just the 2 of us. left the 2 steaks whole, and was glad i did. my only flub was that i wasnt watching the browning of the flour and it started to burn whooooops! still tasted good though. i simmered for about 30mins and then transferred hubbys portion to a slowcooker set to low so he could have it hot when he got home from work late. i ate mine after only 30 mins and it was done and tasty. served with mashed potatoes. will do this again, but will watch the onion/flour more closely!!!

We really enjoyed this.  I used beef broth for the water, but other than that follwed the recipe.  Served over mashed potatos, but think I'll try noodles or rice next time.

My family loved this recipe and I will be cooking this often! Definitely the easiest gravy I have made before. The only things I changed were: I used mushroom onion soup mix and added a half a cup of beef broth (low sodium) to liquid portion of the directions. I also sauteed mushrooms with onions and added them to the pan once the meat was half done.

Good, but would have been too salty if I had added salt.  Next time, I'll use only half the onion soup mix and add some dried onion.  I used 1 cup water and 1 cup milk.  Next time, I'll use 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream.  This is a keeper!

My family & I really enjoyed this.  Serve it with homemade mashed potatoes for a wonderful comfort meal.  My family likes lots of gravy so I stretched out the amount of gravy a bit by using a can of beef broth and then adding 1 1/2 cups of water.  Also, I put the salt, pepper and garlic powder(not garlic salt) directly on the meat before dredging it in the flour.  The gravy does not need the extra seasoning.

I made this recipe yesterday and we where all surprised! My husband said.."I never have thought about cutting the cube steak up." I used onion/mushroom soup mix (because thats all I had on hand and omited the salt, using garlic powder instead, as the soup mix its self is plenty salty enough for our family. I also added a can of mushroom pieces. It ended up being a bit to thick. But I was having some electric skillet mayhem, it would not turn down low enough. So I added a bit of apple cider to thin it back down. It was awesome. I served it over rice with pea pods for our veggie. It will becoming a favorite meal at our house. My husband already said "Dont lose that recipe!"

This was great!! I only used 1/2 pack of onion soup mix, and mixed 1C water and 1C milk for the creamier gravy.  I only let this cook about 30 mins and hoped for the best since I was crunched for time. The meat was still pretty tender!!  Boyfriend said "mmm...good gravy!" He eats almost everything I make, but when he comments on it, it's a keeper! I cleaned my plate too, and can't wait to eat the leftovers! Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed recipe as stated, however the gravy seemed to be missing something. I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy and let it simmer briefly.  Then I put the meat covered with gravy in the oven at 350 degrees for about 1/2 hour/45 mins.  It was excellent!!!!!  My fiance couldn't get enough and we had company over, who all had seconds and there was none left! Will make this part of my regular rotation. Thanks!

I put in oven rather than simmered on stove.  Good.  Could have been more tender but that may be because I put it in the oven?

I made this recipe today for Sunday dinner.  Great recipe...as the others stated...take it easy on the salt.  The onion soup mix is loaded with sodium.  Also substitued the cube steaks for round steaks, and the flavor was awesome.

I was really not happy to see Corey come home from the grocery store with  minute steaks, however this recipe made them a joy. We had no onion soup mix in the house, so beef bouillon made the gravy instead. I seasoned it with worchestershire sauce for a bit of oomph and tossed in about half a tablespoon of brown sugar, too. Thanks, I never would have considered chopping the steak in to bite-sized pieces. That step, plus long simmering, certainly helped to make the meat tender. We'll make this again.

This recipe lacked flavor.  I thought that if the steak was cooked for an hour it would become tender, but it never did.  I don't know how this recipe could be improved.  I will not make this again.

Cube steak is very reasonably priced where I live.  We love Chicken Fried Steak, but are trying to cut down on fat.  This recipe was easy to preapre and very good.  To cut cost and sodium, I used 1/2 package Beefy Onion Soup Mix, garlic powder and added 1 T. dried onion.  I cut the steak into about 1x2-inch strips.  I will make this often and plan to try it in the crockpot.

This recipe was very good. I added 1 cup of milk instead of water and cooked in a Dutch oven for 1 hour in the oven at 350 Degrees. My husband loved it!! I will make this again!!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was very easy.  My husband loved it and said it tasted very much like the dish his mom makes (so it is a definite keeper).  I did end up using a little over 2 cups of water, though, to keep the gravy consistency -- it thickened considerably over the 1 hour cooking time.  I may have had the heat up too high.  I think the 1 hour cook time is the trick to making that meat so tender!! Thank you so much for sharing.

Made this a few weeks ago and everyone loved it.  Was great on wide noodles.  Making it again tonight.  I did omit the salt and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Had a little sour cream in the fridge so served it in a separate bowl and it was delicious with a dollop on top of the meat.  You could just mix some in the gravy and have a stroganoff type meal.

This was easy to make and tasty. I will definitely make it again.  I used some red wine with the water for the gravy and added some cooked onions.  Next time I’m going to try some sautéed sliced mushrooms.

I made this exactly as posted and it was really great!  I've had a love/hate relationship with cube steak.  I grew up eating fresh butchered cube steak.  Today's pre-packaged meat just doesn't hold a candle to my memories of it.  It's always too dry, too tough, and bland.  This recipe was very flavorful but , still, a little dry and tough.  I'm blaming the meat, not the recipe.  Next time, I'll experiment with the cooking time.  BTW......the gravy was so good that I bagged up the extra and froze it for another meal!

This was so good. The only change I made was I didn't cut up the steak. I also used 1/2 cup less water because I was afraid the gravy would be too thin. Would definitely make again. Quick and delicious.

I loved this recipe. It made the cube steak very tender and the added bonus of the gravy is wonderful. Very flavorful

This recipe is similar to my recipe, with a few differences. I use pork tenderloins and "cube" them myself. Combine the water with chicken broth to make the gravy more savory. I sift out the dried onion pieces in the soup mix because I think they overpower the dish. Instead, I sauté an small chopped onion in the pan drippings.

This is the meal my husband requests almost every time I ask him what he would like me to cook for dinner!  We love it.  I always double the recipe because the leftovers (if you can manage to have any) are even better the second day.  

One suggestion for you to try, for your liquid use half water and half milk.  Make it either way, you will not be disappointed!

This was a fantastic way to make cube steak. I expected it to be good but was shocked at how much I liked it. The meat was VERY tender. The flavor was perfect. I added some cajun spice to the meat before flouring. Will definitely be making again! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good recipe! Didn't use onion soup but half a bouillon beef flavor. I also used some recaito and added left over flour for a quick brown, then ware, gradually. Added the steaks and some dry Rosemary to taste. Around 1/4 cup water needed extra for the gravy. Served with made from scratch mashed potatoes.

So simple, so yummy. Reminds me of Sunday suppers at Grandma's. Definitely substitute 1 cup of the water with milk. And don't be intimidated by the 1 hour simmer time. The longer it simmers, the tendered it will be. I took the advice of another reviewer and deflated the pan with some cheap cooking wine. Adds a richness to the gravy.

This recipe has the potential to be really good; however, a whole pack of onion soup mix made the gravy too salty. I see from other reviews the same complaint. The next time I make this recipe, I will try half a pack of the soup mix to see if that makes it more palatable.

This got rave reviews, and it was so easy to make that I felt that I cheated somehow.  I pan fried my cube steaks, then put them in my Casserole Crock Pot, and poured the gravy over them once I had made it in the frying pan.  Toward the end of the slow cooking, I added some half and half to the gravy, then served the steaks and gravy over rice.  This was my husband's favorite thing to ask his mother to make.  Tonight he made me promise not to tell her that he liked this version better.  Don't give away our secret!

I really don't want to ruin a good piece of meat so after reading all the reviews, I decided to follow the general recipe but I added sliced onion, 8 oz fresh mushrooms and chopped garlic at the beginning with the steak.  I used cornstarch in place of flour to coat the meat. After removing the browned meat, I de-glazed the pan with 1/4 sherry then stirred in the flour and soup, let brown,then water. I did not add any additional salt or garlic powder. I let it simmer on the stove for an hour. The result was a thick flavorful gravy which went well with baby gold potatoes and sauteed Swiss chard.

This recipe is very good! I was looking for something different to do with cube steak since we get it in a freezer meat package and country fried steak gets old.  I doubled the gravy, dumped the meat into a 9 x 13 casserole dish when it was browned, added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, poured the thickened gravy over it and baked it  covered on 350 for an hour. Meat is very tender and the veggies really compliment the gravy. We ate this over rice. I was told this needs to go in my rotation. :)

the steaks don't have to be cubed salt and pepper meat then egg dip then flower. fry take meat out make gravy use milk instead of water. cut meat into small cubes this will let the moister back into the meat after frying use extra milk the more it cooks the tender the meat will be mix meat into gravy simmer stir often cover, if you want more flavor use 2 packs of brown gravy mix. this also work for pork or just about any meat. you don't need all that extra breading. serve on top of rice or potatoes or try stove top dressing.

Loved this recipe.  I did not cut the cube steak into bite size pieces but served it whole.  I added Marsala cooking wine, Mushrooms, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt to cut the amount of salt. Simmered it for one-half hour and it was very tender. Served it with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli.  It is a "keeper" in this house!

This is a good recipe but you know how one always believes they know better - in I come! That said, I followed the recipe but added three packets of onion soup mix (a cup of water added for each packet) - also adding one can of cream of mushroom soup - added one large onion and about 15 fresh mushrooms sliced - all added to six large cube steaks - it turned out fabulously - so very tasty and it was accompanied by egg noodles.  Again fabulous.

This was a good base recipe for what I actually made. I used my own blend of seasonings & floured & cooked 8 cube steaks. I followed the recipe & used a pack of beef onion soup mix to make my gravy. I tripled the amount of gravy because my family loves gravy. I then cut some onion circles & put the steak, onions & the gravy in my slow cooker on warm. This was terrific over mashed potatoes.

This recipe was very delicious! I did not coat with flour before frying, I only used the flour to make the gravy. My intentions were to make them less breaded. However, they still ended up being pretty breaded, which was fine still. This is a keeper!!

Not sure we liked the texture or flavor very much. Also too salty for our tastes and I didn't add the extra salt.

I think cutting up the cube steaks did help them get more tender.  I used my kitchen shears to cut them up.  I ended up simmering them closer to 1.5 hours because we weren't quite ready to eat.  Good flavor and very tender.

I had to add more oil and more water for the gravy to have a smooth consistency. I did not add any salt and it was salty enough. The steaks came out very tender and delicious.

This turned out really good. Had the family going for seconds. I followed the recipe the way it was listed with only one difference. I added mushrooms to it before I added the cube steaks back in. Turned out really delicious.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  I got tired of eating chicken fried steaks so I was looking at the different recipes and found this one, and plus I had all the stuff to make it.  I was so full by the time I got done eating the rice that I served it over.

Great! My husband really loved this recipe. Really enjoyed the flavor. Made a few changes, did not have dry onion soup mix, used minced onions and powdered beef bouillon. It came out great anyway,  I will use this recipe again.

Changed it up some...Used low sodium beef broth in place of water, added sauteed onions and mushrooms and used garlic powder on the meat to season before ccoking.  Hubby went back for seconds but I thought it needed some brightness...maybe parsley or some peppers?

We do not like cube steak. Flavor was good though and if I used a better cut of meat I'm sure Hubby would think higher of it.

please just follow the directions!  don't make any substitions.  season liberally with the garlic salt and additional salt and cook as directed.   if it gets too thick, just add more water but this is a can't miss recipe!  served over rice.  perfect amount of sauce/meat ratio.

A hit with the husband who went back for seconds!  Served with hot buttered noodles.  I added a cup of milk as others suggested, along with the water and a little extra flour.  It was nice because my husband was late, but I could just let it keep simmering and get more tender.  Ended up simmering for about an hour and a half with no problems.  Will definitely have this again.  Mashed potatoes next time!

Easy to make and good. My childhood memories of cubed steak was a chewy uninviting piece of meat. But I believe the secret is cooking it long enough so that the tendons of the meat break apart and tenderizes.  This was a hit! For a cheap cut of beef this is the way to go.

Just ok. I was rather disapointed with this recipe. I love onions and my husband loves cube steak so I thought "win win situation." Unfortunately it just didn't click with either of us.We ate it because thats what we had, but won't make this again.

5 stars for easy, and 5 stars for delicious! It just so happened that I had a packet of onion soup mix in my pantry, and I needed a topping for my baked potatoes. And too, I had a few pieces of steak that needed to be used up. This recipe was so amazing, highly recommended!

Great gravy.  Be sure to deglaxe pan with red wine as suggested by others before adding flour and onion soup.  Still cube steak though...just not a very good piece of meat and very hard to disguise.

My family and I LOVE this recipe.  I have tried it with pork chops, cubed steak, even plain old hamburger patties and it always tastes wonderful.  This is now my husbands favorite recipe.  Thanks for thisyummy new addition to our tastebuds.  :)

Easiest gravy I've ever made.  Doubled the recipe and had some to carry in my lunch; girls at work loved it!  Perfect dish for a "potatoes and meat" kind of husband!

The cube steak turned out tender and it went well over mashed potatoes. I will make it again. I might add some green pepper to it next time to add a vegetable to the meal and to make it more flavorful.

I made this recipe for my first time ever cooking for my in-laws. I've heard the typical comments from my husband that I can't cook like his mom, etc., and I'm very new at cooking and not too good at it. but when everyone tasted this, they were blown away! my mother in law wanted the recipe and my husband stole some to take for lunch the next day so we couldn't eat it during the dinner! it was amazing! so easy to do and the best country style steak I've ever had!

After work I'm always trying to find something warm to make that matches the level of energy I have after a long day.  This was great - I served it over homemade mashed potatoes.  It fed three of us (me, my husband, and 15 year old daughter.)  If cooking for my entire family of five, I would've had to make two batches.

This recipe was wonderful! I kept the cube steaks whole, but otherwise followed the recipe to the t, which is unusual for me.  Typically I would make cube steak into Chicken Fried Steak and always had leftovers, but with this recipe I had my children begging for more!  There were actually sad faces when it was all gone!  Just wonderful, my husband wants to have it again tomorrow night.

I really liked the ease of this recipe compared to the traditional way I have been making chicken fried steak for years.  The only change I made was I used "beefy" onion soup mix instead of regular and I used garlic powder instead of garlic powder because I thought it was pretty salty anyway.  I prefer the way I have always made it, but I really did think it was good and will make again because it is much easier.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! The picture does not do the recipe justice. The tenderest cube steak I have ever eaten. I used olive oil instead of vegetable and used two cloves of garlic instead of the salt.

Great recipe I cut the cube steak them into smaller pieces like 2 inche . I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt since I don't like very salty dishes and I used 1 cup water and 1 cup of  milk instead of water as another suggested I cooked in the slow cooker for about 6 hours in low . Turned out wonderful.

Easy & delicious! I didn't have onion soup mix, so used french onion soup in a can instead of water and added envelope of brown gravy mix & a little garlic powder (personal taste). Also, I did this before church so put it in the crock pot on low. Thanks for the idea. I'm sure it would be just as good following the recipe exactly.

We were looking forward to eating this when it was cooking on the stove, but it disappointed me because it turned out to be too salty.  I probably won't be making this again and if I do, I will be putting less salt into it.

I gave this four stars. I have had to do some tweeking on this and I think I finally got it. I add about a fourth of a cup of beef (or chicken) stock right before I add the onion soup mix and flour mixture. This gives it just enough to make a GREAT gravy. That is all I have changed!!

Ok...This was way better then I thought it would be.  The meat was so tender and the gravy was yummy.  I only used half of the soup mix and it gave it plenty of flavor.  My daughter who is a VERY picky eater had seconds and then wanted me to save the left overs for the next day for her.  I served it over mashed potatoes and had corn and biscuites with it.  This will be a stable at my house.  Thanks

This was an excellent recipe.  Changes: I left my cube steaks whole instead of cutting them. I liberally added Adobo, black pepper, garlic powder and seasoning salt.  I didn't coat them with flour (less work).  Added mushroom onion dry soup mix and sauteed fresh garlic and onion for the gravy.  I added a touch more flour and it made a nice, thick brown gravy.  There were no leftoevers, not even with the picky kids.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Instant hit! Thanks!

I added a can of chopped tomatoes and used beef broth instead of water. Good recipe.  Someone here mentioned glazing the pan with some wine and that is a great idea I'll try next time.

This was very good. I wasn't sure about cutting into bite size pieces, but it worked just fine. However, I think next time I'll just leave the steaks whole. The flavors were excellent!

My family liked this meal. I enjoyed it as well, but it wasn't anything I couldn't wait to make again. I loved that it was so simple. I mashed some potatoes and found that I didn't need to season them at all due to the seasoning of the gravy. The combo was perfect. I also used a homemade onion soup mix to avoid the msg found in Liptons. If you are interested in that, just search for it on the internet as it's not listed on allrecipes.

Easy recipe to prepare, and tastes great; very kid-friendly recipe.  The only change I made was to substitute the all-purpose flour with my own gluten-free flour mix (food allergies in the family).  Thanks for submitting SUZANNER!

Had never cooked with cube steak before, but the simplicity of this recipe and the delicious result made this a "keeper" in the good-in-a-hurry file!  Jewell

This is the ONLY way to make cube steak. I made this quite a few times since I first saw the recipe about 6 months ago. It is one of my wife & sons favorite meals. Making it again tonight...for my in-laws.

It was not bad, but didn't go over so well with the family.  I think my hubby was looking for a more traditional chicken fried steak.

This was excellent! I have never been good with cube steak, but his turned out great! I cut mine in finger sized pieces and it was tender and the gravy was just right. I did deglaze my pan with a little wine and added a bit of beef broth as it cooked to make more gravy, but that's all. Next time I'll remember to add mushrooms. This is definitely a keeper for us. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

After reading the reviews I decided to make this for dinner last night.  Afraid of having a "too salty" dish, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and omitted the salt.  In the end, I should have used a little more.  Another alteration I would make is to mix the salt, pepper, and garlic salt with the flour so more of those flavors get into the meat better.     It sure smelled great while it was simmering!  Hubby came down from upstairs to see what it was that smelled so good!

I thought that this was really good and the family enjoyed it.  I cooked the meat longer at first and it didnt' take an hour for me, I didn't have the time.  I also added mushrooms.  This is a keeper for sure.

I followed the directions....mostly....always have to my touch in recipes...I crushed garlic and chopped onion in the oil...before I browned the meat...and I didn't have dry onion soup mix....used mushroom gravy instead and it worked just fine....

I don't like the dried onions in the soup mix, so I used a small sieve to leave those out.  In place of water I used beef broth with excellent results. In addition to this recipe I made Wine Soaked Mushrooms from this site and was not over-eager to serve them on their own.  So I added them to the gravy and everyone expressed how good the gravy came out. We have never made cubed steak for our 13 and 16-year-olds, so their opinion of the steak does not count; however, my husband and thought it was "spot on."  TY for sharing.

My boyfriend gave this recipe 3 stars but I think it deserves 4 stars. We both agreed that it would be much better with pork, which I will try next time. I did make one substitution - I used leek soup mix instead of onion because that's what I had. The gravy tasted amazing but the steak was overdone, and I only cooked it for 45 min instead of the full hour.

I was looking forward to a change from the usual creamy sauce treatment. Unfortunately, this was really bad. It needs additional seasoning of some kind, but not more salt because that's already in abundance in the onion soup mix. The meat was tender, but it tasted mostly of the soup mix.

Hubby made this the other night.  It was simple,easy and delicious.  I will definately make this again.  I will use axis venison instead of cube steaks.    04/2009 Made this with axis and it was delicious.  I added garlic, onion powder and season salt and pepper to flour.  Served over brown rice.

Really liked this.  We had to use more flour to make the gravy, along with more water, but the flavor was excellent.

I thought this was great.  My son also liked it.  The only thing I changed was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Served it with mashed potatoes.  Great comfort food!

When I made this its probably my fault it came out inedible because I used the wrong kind of meat.  I made it with casserole beef pieces and the meat came out like rubbery leather... again probably my fault because of the meat.  We couldn't even eat it because of that.  As far as the sauce, it was just OK.  To me it was very similar to gravy, but then again I barely ate any.  I have to say that the recipe was super easy to prepare which was nice.  I think I will try to make this once more time with the proper cut of meat and hopefully I'll have better luck.

Wonderful!  I also took suggestion of substituting milk for the water.  It made for a wonderful gravy on top of smashed red potatoes.  This recipe gave me another option on what to do with all the cube steak I have in my freezer!

This recipe was better than I thought it would be!  As others mentioned, I did not add additional salt (garlic powder instead) but did use the entire envelope of soup.  I also used 1 cup water and 1 cup cream; after cooking, I added sour cream to the gravy and, boy!  It was as close to my mom's beef stroganoff as I have ever tasted since she made it over 10 years ago(she had the recipe in her head, never told anyone and now it's lost forever!).

This was excellent.  I changed a few things but I think it's better than my Mom's. I used a clove of fresh garlic (instead of garlic salt), two and a half cups water and one cup milk (I love gravy), and left out the extra salt. Served it over rice and my family loved it.

I did not add salt and used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt and it was salty enough. If I made it again I would add more seasoning and chopped onions. Maybe some beef broth too. Served it over mashed potatoes.

My family really enjoyed this meal.  I only used 1 cup H2O and about 3/4 Cup of milk because we prefer a creamier gravy.  I added a can of mushrooms at the end which complimented the recipe nicely.  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful recipe for cube steak.  My husband and 2 year old loved it.  I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt, and didn't use any extra salt.  It is still a salty recipe, so if you are under a salt restriction, wouldn't be so good.

This was a great recipe for cube steak. The cube steak was so tender and juice.  My boys are picky eaters and did not eat cube steak when I made it for dinner. My boys ate it and loved it.

I made this exactly like the recipe, and we liked it alot.  We eat quite a bit of cube steak (my husand's favorite, for some reason) but this recipe was just enough different to make it a nice change.

Absolutely the best cube steak I've ever made (maybe even eaten).  The leftovers were frozen and they reheated beautifully in my convection oven.  A winning recipe.

I threw the sauce away.  Even skipping the salt and using garlic powder instead of garlic salt it was way too salty.

Excellent flavor and exceptionally tender.  I added 1 tsp dry mustard and 2 Tbsp brown sugar along with the garlic.  I had to add almost an additional cup of water during the hour it simmered since I made it in an electric skillet.  I will probably use a regular shell sirloin or chuck steak next time I make it -- I didn't care for the texture of the cube steak.

I had never had cube 
steak before so I had no clue what to expect from this recipe.  My husband wasn't thrilled with my plans since he doesn't like country steak but what a great turnout this was!  It has been a long time since I have made something that my whole family enjoyed but this recipe did the trick!  Everyone loved it!!  The only thing I did differently was I didn't cut up the meat and it was still very tender.  Later in the night we took buttered bread and dipped it in the leftover gravy.  It was amazing!  Thank you Suzanner for the recipe this will definitely be added to our regular rotation.

This dish is so yummy! However, like other reviewers, it was a bit salty for me so I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Next time I will leave out the regular salt as well. Plus, it was really easy and time saving! I cooked for myself, and it is definitely something I will make again!

This was so tasty! We both loved it! I'm from South Louisiana & we don't eat bland food...EVER...I don't know what the reviewers did to it to make it "tasteless" but it had plenty of flavor for us! You just have to add seasoning! Just remember to taste it & add seasoning based on what you like. A recipe is a guideline to go by, so you can adjust it according to your preferences. 

I only used 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix & I didn't cut my steaks into bite sized pieces because they were already pretty small. I'm not a lover of leftovers, but we will definitely be eating the leftovers tonight!!

Not a bad recipe at all and very quick to make.  I liked the ease of using the onion soup mix and I did omit salt as the coup mix had enough taste to it.

Great recipe, just too salty for me. I would suggest using low sodium onion soup, not adding salt, and using garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I just do not like a lot of salt. My husband thought the recipe was great though. I will be making this again and he can add his own salt after the fact! I also did not cut the cubed steak into bite size pieces.

My husband loves cube steak, and he loved this.  I will keep this in the rotation for maybe once a month since he has to cut back on his sodium and fat content.  Thanks for the post.

this was a pretty good recipe.  didn't read the instructions well so i didn't cut up the beef into bite sized pieces.  will definitely do that next time as the meat kept sticking to the pan (non-stick pan at that!)making the coating come off.  i did have to add additional water over the course of cooking it.  but still, very good!

This was very good. It stretched to feed a family of 5 and then leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks for this recipe exactly as it is!!

I enjoyed this recipe, but I accidentally overcooked it (not one to cook any sort of red meat).  If it hadn't been so tough, I think it would've been excellent.  Will definitely try again.  Also, I also only used 1/2 of the onion soup pkg and a little garlic powder (no salt and pepper).  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans

This is one spectacular recipe!  It is so easy but doesn't taste like it and the gravy is wonderful.  Thank you for sharing such an awesome recipe!

This was just ok.  The taste was alright.  I cut down on the salt.  If I made it again I would not cut the meat up so small, maybe just in half.

This was a very good recipe. The only thing is that my son found a half of package of the onion soup and added it to it. Made it to salty. But will definitely do it again. I was thinking of using some of the other instand soups the same way, would be great too.
