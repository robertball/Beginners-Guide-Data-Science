I had this when I was under the weather in Dublin and it really seems to work. I tried this recipe at home when I had an ear infection and after a couple of glasses, at least I wasn't in pain anymore, and I actually did feel better in the morning. I'm firmly in the leave out the sugar camp of the Hot Irish Whiskey devotees, and I also add some extra lemon juice. Thanks!

I'm mixed on this one. I really liked it & then I thought it tastes like lemon water. After a couple who cares?

I'm feeling absolutely crummy today and indulged in a little alcohol (I don't drink much anymore only because it messes with my blood sugars) in this drink because I just need to zone out and try to feel better. This was very good, most soothing and just what I needed. NOTE: I did not use sugar, I used one teaspoon organic honey.

We went on a trip to Ireland last year and were treated to this drink by one of the locals. This is exactly how it was done right down to the spoon so,  on authenticity alone, the recipe is perfect. They really are delicious and oh so comforting on a cold evening. Thanks for putting this out there.

Yes, this does the trick every time. I use honey instead of sugar. But, watch with these! They're too good! You might find yourself taking two sick days and finishing a liter of Jameson's (not that this happened to me ;-)

I thought the cloves might taste too strong, but they don't. A lovely drink.

Nice and simple.  My husband enjoyed it as much as I did. I may try this with a bit less auger next time but overall very pleased!
