I gave this recipe a try, as I am always watching my calories, and found it to be very tasty, indeed! I didn't even try the version that uses real sugar. My only issue is that I have yet to find 12 ounce jars. I ended up purchasing pint sized jars, which are 16 ounces. So I will just have to adjust the recipe to fill 16 ounce jars. Not a big deal, and certainly not a recipe flaw. Just my lack of motivation to hop from store to store in search of 12 ounce jars.

I used this recipe. Very good. Made it again and I did not use cinnamon or nutmeg. Used 1/2 cup instant decaf coffee, (which I put in coffee grinder), put splenda in coffee grinder and made all a powder texture.
Used 1 1/2 cups non dairy creamer. Hazel nut or vanilla are great. I will be looking for other creamers for different taste. I gave several jars away at Christmas time. Makes a great gift.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I mixed it with hot milk instead of water I heated in the microwave about a minute. I have found milk is better than water, taste wise. The mix is as good as any instant coffee drink mix one could buy at a store, at a fraction of the cost. It works well for road trips and camping as you only need some hot water and no machinary. I made 1/4 of the recipe to try it. For the chocolate drink mix I used Carnation sugar-free chocolate instant breakfast. I was short a tsp or so and subbed a little plain unsweetened cocoa. Make sure to have the Splenda in something other than the packets. I found it took 10 packets to make just 1 Tblsp amount. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup. As a result, I cut the amount of Splenda in half and it was plenty sweet. I put all of the ingredients in my Vitamix machine for about 30 seconds and it turned to a nice powder consistency.

I didn't really care for this, but I made it as gifts for Christmas with sugar cookies. I put it in mason jars and topped with dried marshmallows. I've gotten several comments about how good it was, so it was appreciated and I'll probably make it again as gifts.

Very good!  I used white sugar instead of Splenda. Added mini marshmellows on the top of the jar and gave for gifts.

This was an excellent cappuccino-on-the-go mix!!!  I JUST finished making this mix and putting it in jars (they'll make some excellent prizes for my sister's baby shower!).

Before I jarred the mix, I tried it (of course!).  It tasted quite a bit like cappuccino my mother makes (she was spoiled by Italy, so...).  I prefer my coffee products a little sweeter (I like a little coffee with my sugar...), so I added a couple of chocolate chips to my sample, and they added just the extra touch of sweetness I wanted!

SOOOOoooo...  I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the mixture before putting it into the jars.  Yummy!!!
