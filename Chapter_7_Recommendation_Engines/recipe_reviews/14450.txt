Wow! Another really tasty tuna salad! I cut the recipe in half for one can of tuna. I used celery instead of green pepper and Frank's red hot for the hot pepper sauce. I'm a huge fan of Frank's! The rice wine vinegar was an interesting addition here, but there was not enough mayo. I mean 1 Tbsp. for a whole can just doesn't cut it for me. I used light mayo and just added it to my own personal tastes. This was interesting in terms of taste, color, and texture. It was very good on toasted whole grain bread.

I thought this would be great as a pasta salad so I doubled the recipe and added Penne pasta. It was delicious! Perfect summertime lunch.

This recipe makes an outstanding tuna salad.  I added diced celery, sliced cherry tomatoes and served it on a croissant with romaine lettuce.

This tuna salad was delicious and so pretty.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I left it out, and it still tasted great.  I was easy to make, but a little time consuming for me, because I am a slow chopper.  This is a keeper, will definitely make again!

This was quite good, by the recipe, but after making it, I found I missed some of my favorite standard additions to tuna salad. Added boiled eggs, celery, celery salt, and onion powder for a flavor my husband and I were a little happier with. We'll definitely continue to use the flavorful variations from this recipe, as well. Altogether, this was a nice change!

I'd like this recipe, however, I didn't feel that it was any more special than any other tuna salad recipe.  I would make it again though because it makes a nice presentation.

This is SO EASY to make (coming from someone who usually only opens a can of tuna and adds mayo) and I've gotten compliments on it both times I've served it at parties.  One person even told me three months later that it was the best tuna they'd ever had.

Very tasty!  I'm trying to eat lower carb, so this was great over greens alongside some grapes.  I added slivered almonds and since I didn't have onions...some onion powder and a sour cream/onion dip mixture with the mayo.  I also used some jalapenos for heat and some leftover fresh basil I had.  You can add just about anything and it will taste great!

This is a very pretty tuna salad.  I made half the recipe for the two of us, using all green onion because I didn’t have any red.  I added a little celery for some crunch and increased the mayonnaise until I got the consistency I wanted.  This was very good, although I think I would have preferred it as a chicken salad, but that is strictly personal preference, and no fault of the recipe.  I’ll make this again, but I’ll try it with chicken next time.

Very good, I don't do green onions, just double the red. Miracle Whip makes it tangier and some jalapeno juice for my hot loving boyfriend.

Love this recipe!  I  have modified this recipe several times depending on the ingredients on hand.  However, the flavor is in the rice wine vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good "basic" recipe but I found it needed a little something more. I added capers and some course mustard which gave it a more "robust" flavor. I soaked the capers in a bowl of water before using so as to minimize the sodium.

this was okay.. bf liked it more than i did.. i only had green bell pepper so i just doubled the amount.. left out the red onion and subbed cilantro for parsley.. after tasting the final product i added more garlic, rice wine vinegar, and hot pepper sauce (frank's)
