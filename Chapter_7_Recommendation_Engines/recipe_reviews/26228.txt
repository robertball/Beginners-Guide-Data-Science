I thought the butter in these cookies give them a very good flavor.  They baked up much bigger than I expected  so next time I will roll them a little thinner or bake them a little longer.  I did use more sesame seeds than called for.  I like these cookies very much.

My dad was a baker and used to make cookies that tastes exactly like these! I made exactly as written and found them to be very easy to make.  I dipped the whole rope in the milk and  sesame seeds and then cut them into bite size pieces, instead of dipping each individually.  It saved alot of time!

Rosaria, thanks for this recipe!!  The cookies look and taste great.  I did use much more than 3/4 cup Sesame seeds however. I also found that it was easier to divide the dough into eighths before making a "rope" -- it was just much easier to handle.  Also, when I cut the rope into 2 inch pieces, I gently rolled the piece again (before dipping in milk) to get it into a shape and size that worked and looked inviting. To those who are considering making this recipe, the prep time is a little misleading --- it takes much longer than 10 minutes to get all the ingredients together and the dough mixed to the right consistency but, it wa well worth the effort!

I made these cookies exactly the way the recipe stated and found them to be delicious!  My husband loves them.  They browned up nicely, just the way he likes them.  Definitely will make these again in the future.

Very easy and good.  My italian friend used to make sesame cookies and these are every bit as good. I would use less sesame seeds.  Thanks for the recipe.

When these cookies first came out of the oven, I thought they were too sweet and I also thought that coating them completely in sesame seeds was too much. After they sat for a day, they had virtually no taste/sweetness at all. They were pretty cookies, but eating one was like chewing on a bland crunchy biscuit covered with sesame seeds. It definitely needed something extra.

Loved them!  Everyone who tasted the cookies said they were a hit.  I'll probably make a double recipe tonight or tomorrow

Just baked these for a friend who doesn't like sweets. A perfect treat without so much sugar. Delicious crunch of sesame seeds makes these cookies. I agree you can roll a longer piece, dip in the milk, dredge through the sesame seeds and then cut into two inch pieces.  For anyone who likes a sweeter treat just serve these cookies with homemade strawberry jam.  Yum!
