I found this recipe a while back, and since I love salmon I decided to try it.  I LOVE this recipe, the basting really seals in those flavors while you are grilling.  For those of you who don't want to grill, you can bake it instead...I put aluminum foil down on a baking pan (9x13) and bake the salmon covered for 20 minutes, and then uncovered for 20-25 more minutes at 375-400, depending on your oven.  Baste it frequently, like the original recipe implies.  BEST recipe ever for salmon!

I really liked this recipe.  I did make 2 changes.  Instead of using ground ginger, I used fresh (and doubled the amount).  I also used the juice from the ginger.  The other change was that I baked it in the oven.  It made the sauce so sticky and delicious.  Can't wait to make this again, thanks for the post.

My son and husband loved it. I marinated it for 8 hours then baked it in a foil packet 375' for about 35 minutes.

This was really good with the following changes. I marinaded it for about 20 hours. It needed a little more sweetness so I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. It also needed more green onion, so I put in two more. It wasn't salty enough, but that was my fault I used low salt soy sauce. I baked it (with some of the marinade in the pan) at 400 for 30 minutes, basting it twice. With these changes it could be a five.

My Dad loved his father's day grill.  We used this marinade with tuna and it was delicious!  I forgot to pick up green onions, so I used chives and a sprinkle of onion powder.  Yummay!  A keeper.  This marinade would be excellent on any fish, shrimp, scallops, or pork.

Great flavor.  We grilled this on a cedar plank for about 15 minutes. Oiled the plank, put it oil side down over the hot coals, flipped it when slightly charred, topped it with the salmon and let it smoke.  No need to flip the fish. Excellent, will definitely do again.

This was really tasty.  I let the fish marinate much longer than the recipe called for and squeezed a fresh lime over it when it was done.  Impressed several people with this one.

I never liked salmon until I tried this recipe! My husband was very pleased as well, he said it was the best salmon he had ever had. It was easy, inexpensive, and I didn't even have to marinate the salmon for very long at all and the taste of the marinade was still grilled into the salmon. This is great!

This fish was delicious.  I used salmon steaks and marinated them overnight.    The only changes I made were to add a little more honey, more green onions, a splash of sesame oil, and a little cayenne pepper for a KICK!  And for more intense flavor, I took the leftover marinade and reduced it to make a glaze to drizzle over the top of the fish.  Yum!

Oh my goodness!!  I'm not sure exactly how long we marinated this...probably close to an hour.  But I followed the recipe exactly and grilled it on a gas grill on some aluminum foil.  It was the best salmon I have ever tasted.  Incredible!!!!!

My husband and I love this recipe.  We choose to bake rather than grill.  We add crushed red pepper to it for a spicy taste.  I even cook a second batch of this marinade in a saucepan to pour over our white rice.

This marinade was fantastic.  I like the honey and orange in this.  However, the salmon never really picked up the flavor after 30 minutes.  I left half of the salmon filets marinading in it overnight and that was better.
I used the George Foreman Grill for this which made basting impossible.  Perhaps a more conventional method allowing for basting would be better.  
I will be on the lookout for variations of this recipe and try again.  Good mix of flavors.

So good!  I came on here to find a quick salmon recipe because I didn't want to have just lemon or butter.  I have made this twice within the last week.  The only change I made was using Orange Pineapple juice since I didn't have just orange juice.  The first time I made it I marinated for 30-45 minutes, the second time I did 24 hours.  The only difference I saw was the change of color.

I liked this recipe because it featured ingredients that I always have on hand.  It was quick and easy.  It turned out pretty good - very moist.  For me the soy sauce was a bit overpowering, so I'll probably reduce it next time.  I think I'll also take the suggestion from another reviewer and reduce the remaining marinade into a glaze for a nice sauce.

Amazing marinade! I added a little more green onion, but that was only for personal prefrerence. My parents loved the marinade- they couldn't wait to try it on chicken or even wild fowl!

Very good, and easy.  I tried this using the oven (~35 min uncovered, 350).  I forgot to marinate it and it still tasted great.  Probably from the basting.  Thanks!

What a GREAT recipe! I hate to drop names but, I used Kikkomans soy sauce. The flavor is truly unique in that it's not overwhelming with sodium, therefore it actually brings out the wonderful flavors of ginger and orange. I swear by it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. This marinade can be used for any meat, poultry, or fish. We really enjoyed it on Venison. Overnight marinating is best. KUDOS!

Absolutely love this recipe!  I usually marinate this overnight. I have started to bake this instead of grill.  Once it is cooked I turn the broiler on and brown the top.  That makes the top glaze a bit.  Yum!

I cooked this in a foil packet which was really easy (375deg for about 40 minutes) and the flavor was nice.  But I would suggest marinating it longer and I also reduced the marinade afterwards in a saucepan and used it as a thicker sauce which made the flavor stronger.  Too much soy sauce in my opinion (the citrus and honey were overwhelmed), but still a good recipe.

Tasty recipe, similar to other grilled salmon marinades I've tried.  Much like those, marinating it overnight is better, and using the marinade as a dipping sauce while eating seems to be the best way (especially if using the George where you can't baste).

This recipe is just excellent. To make it absolutely over-the-top my husband used a smoker box and hickory wood inside during grilling - giving a smoky flavor to balance the sweetness. This is definitely a keeper - my 2 year old loved it also!

This was pretty good, but the flavor wasn't very strong.  The fish wasn't as moist as some other recipes I've tried (and I've tried a lot!).  There are many other recipes that I prefer over this one.

EASY!!! I didn't have the set ingredients, so improvised with 3/4 orange, soy sauce, sushi ginger, fresh minced garlic, and a green onion - blended on puree - put in a ziplock with fillets and then added the honey - marinated, grilled, ate - tummy is a happy camper!!!

Really great, simple dish!  I tested this out tonight on my husband and two daughters (ages 4 & 2), as I'm hosting a dinner group this weekend and this was a recipe that interested me.  My only substitutions were to use orange pineapple juice instead of plain orange- all I had- and to use some extra green onions.  Even my 2 year old ate all of her portion and asked for more. The only change I will make for next time is to increase the time I marinate the salmon.  I marinated it for approx. 4 hours.  This gave the fish a chance to pick up some of the great flavor, but I think putting it in in the marinade for longer would make this even better!

This was good. It's very similar to my favorite salmon marinade, which is a maple glaze. I used fresh ginger and garlic. I marinated it overnight and cooked it in a grill pan, and the texture was perfectly moist. I also marinated some scallops, which were delicious. I'm going to try baking this next time.

After marinating overnight, even with holes poked in the salmon, the flavor was very faint.  Not as strong a marinade as I had expected.

I really don't like salmon that much, but with this recipe I really love it....I didn't have any orange juice so I used some bottled  sweet red chili that I had...it turned out great.  The first time I fixed it, I liked it better because it had more time to marinade and it had a sweeter flavor.  But in all it will be fixed again.

This was so delicious. I loved that it had no oil in marinade. I marinaded my fish for couple hours and basted frequently through grilling. Best I had so far.

This recipe is delicious.  I didn't have any honey so I used brown sugar instead.  My boyfriend loved it.  We will definitely make it again.

It was good, but too salty for my taste.  I marinated it overnight and I think I used Too much soy sauce.
