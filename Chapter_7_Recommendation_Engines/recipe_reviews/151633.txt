We make these burgers a lot during the summer. A lot. What makes them even better is melted swiss and carmelized onions and mushrooms. 

When we make them, the whole neighborhood
comes to check them out. They just HAVE to know what smells so good!

Very good tasting burgers! I used ground sirloin for this and sprinkled them with a little krazy salt then followed directions. I was skeptical how this could be any good with barely any ingredients. This was similar to the French Dip sandwich with the au jus like Arby's serves, only better! I served this on onion buns, these were soooo tasty.

I found this on the soup can and my husband loves it!  I always make sauteed onions and mushrooms (add a little of the soup to this for extra flavor) and I use ground turkey!  It's awesome!!!

Try this recipe for a juicy, yummy change from the usual burger.  Thankfully, a recipe without cream soup! Here is my version: 
2# ground beer
2 t minced garlic
2 T Worcestershire sauce
1 large onion, sliced
1 can French onion soup
1-2 t wasabi (optional)
6 slices Monterrey or Pepper Jack
6 hamburger rolls

Mix all together; shape into patties. Heat non-stick skillet to high.  Brown one side of patties then flip, reduce heat to medium-low, add onion, cover pan. Stir onions occasionally, cook until burgers are cooked though and onions are golden.  Add soup, raise heat til simmers, simmer for 5 minutes.  Broil buns with cheese.

I thought it was very tasty and easy to make as well. I fried some onions prior to cooking the hamburgers and then added them to the dry onion soup mix. My husband didn't care for these at all because he felt that dipping the hamburger bun in the sauce made it soggy and he doesn't like that texture. But I loved it and thought it made a great midweek meal.

Very good - produces a tasty,  juicy burger.  You could really do this with any liquid.  beef broth and red wine,  beef broth and teriyaki etc.  I still like grilling outdoors, but this is the only way I will ever make them inside.

Really fast, especially using pre-made hamburger patties.  My husband liked these more than I did.  I may try topping leftover burgers with a little mayo.  We used baby swiss and pepper jack instead of american cheese.

This is great, quick, and simple...perfect for a weekday supper. Be sure to use hard rolls if you plan to dip them in the soup. I fry some onions in olive oil first. Remove the onions from the pan leaving behind as much oil (flavor) as possible to brown hamburgers in. Remove the hamburgers and pour off most of the oil leaving as much of the "bits" as possible. Add minced garlic to the pan and cook just until fragrant. Pour in the soup and heat. Add the hamburger back in and cook until done. I like to top the burgers with provolone while they're in the pan so it melts nicely. I also toast the buns well, especially if I'm dipping them in the soup. You can add any spices you like into the beef or the soup to make this recipe your own! It is great...even my extremely picky kids eat them!

These are great, but I will try for a little more flavor next time by cooking longer in the soup or adding the lipton soup mix.

I grilled the burgers halfway on te George Forman grill, added about 2 TBS ketchup to the onion soup in the skillet, then added the grilled burgers to the sauce for about 5 mins.  Then, I topped the burgers with sautéed mushrooms and Swiss cheese, and set on grilled buns.  Delicious!!!  We loved these and will be making them again!!

What an unbelievably moist and flavorful burger. The can of french onion soup is really what sets this otherwise plain burger apart. The soup adds just the right hint of onion and salt...and I must say the onion is more of a smothered onion taste so it is not overpowerering for folks who don't like onions.  I added a bit of garlic powder and smoked paprika to the ground beef mix and for a few of the burgers added a packet of onion soup dry mix as suggested by other reviewers.  We love onions so adding the dry mix was preferred by our household, but if you are not an onion person go without.  Finally, we didn't want to brave the cold and grill so I fried the burgers just a minute or two in the pan to brown, took them out of the pan, mixed the soup in the hot pan to get up the pan drippings (after skimming off all the oil of course) and then put the soup and the burgers in a pan in the oven to bake for 10 minutes. Yummy!  
Topped these off with the carmelized onions they were awesome. This is a definite keeper.

Just made this tonight...and the burgers were awesome! My husband said they were very good and delicious. I used swiss cheese, and did NOT put any seasoning in the meat or on the patties...and they tasted just fine. I also sauteed some onions in a little butter with a little sugar and balsamic to add on top of the burgers and used onion buns for all out onion flavor, but other than that made exactly as it says to. Excellent!

I HAVE ALWAYS USED A 1 LB PKG OF GROUND BEEF, CHUCK,OR SURLOIN COOKED AND CRUMBLED UP IN A BLACK IRON SKILLET. (NOW I USE 1/2 GROUND TURKEY AND 1/2 BEEF).  POUR OFF GREASE.   THEN I ADD THE CAN OF ONION SOUP AND COOK 5 MIN TO GET THE FLAVOR IN THE BURGER.   THEN SPRINKLE 3 TBSP OF FLOUR ON THE BROWNED BURGER AND STIR ALL AROUND TO THICKEN IT.    SERVE OPEN FACED WITH EITHER SWISS OR AMERICAN CHEESE.    SUPER YUM!!

Don't change a thing.  Recipe is perfect the way it is! SO good! My husband and I absolutely loved them.  My husband cooked the burgers on the grill until they were medium and then we put them in the soup in a sauce pan on the stove for about 5 minutes, topped with american cheese and put on a bun.  We spooned a little extra sauce on top and served them with some soup in a ramekin on the side.  To die for.  I am having a BBQ soon and we are going to try to make these as mini sliders.

I'd like to give it a 3.5. It was easy, good, and worth a try. I love french onion soup and really enjoy using it in different recipes, so I was excited to try this. It was good. Nothing spectacular. Great if you want easy burgers without getting out the BBQ. but I likely won't make it again.

Burgers were very juicy.  Used dry soup mix to make the liquid equivalent.  I personally like more flavor with seasonings on my burgers,  but the kids loved them as is.  Overall,  as I said earlier, a very good juicy burger.

I am not a french onion fan, but my husband loves it. I made this for him today, except I added Simply Asian Sweet Ginger Garlic to the ground beef and it gave the sandwich a great flavor. 

He loved it and I would make for him again

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. I read in some of the reviews that regular burger buns tended to get soggy in the sauce so I followed my wifes advice and grilled some chabada bread instead. Great texture and flavor. My family loved it.

This was fantastic, especially for being so easy.  I made 2 changes. 1) I used the whole can of soup for the two of us and even added some extra water to get more jus. 2) I used Swiss cheese instead of American, because it's the more traditional selection for French Dip and a personal favorite.

I loved this recipe.. However it look a little bland so I added Cumin seeds, cayene, chili powder, cruched red pepper.. and a little corn starch towards the end of cooking to thicken up the sauce so I put it on the bun. OH MY!!!  was it good!!!

These were so delicious. Very juicy! I tried many recipes for Campbell's soups. Some were ok, some not so much, but this one I will make again!

Haven't tried this one yet but I've been making something similar that tastes just like it.  Brown the meat and drain the grease, then add the soup and cook down. Open hamburger buns and put on top to steam slightly.  Put meat mixture on bun and you can top with cheese but I think it tastes great without.  Add a salad and you have a great meal.

We loved this burger! We used 1/2 lb of ground beef since there are only two of us but used a full can of soup and served it as gravy for some mashed potatoes

These burgers tasted REALLY good! I made 5 or 6 smaller burgers to make it diet friendly and sprinkled a tiny bit of garlic powder on the burgers and it came out fabulous. This was simple, quick, and tasty. This is definitely a keeper. My family is more of the beefy onion type but they all thought it was just as good, I thought they were better. Serve with with vegetables for a more diet friendly meal.

I love making these burgers. I grill the burgers on my George Foreman, and when they are done I add them to a skillet of soup. One can for 4 burgers. I let them simmer until they start to caramelize turning the burgers every so often. I use onion rolls and top with Mayo, lettuce tomatoes and cheese. So good!!!

Whenever I make burgers, I always use onion soup mix! Sometimes dry, sometimes canned, but always always with the addition of green chillies!! That little heat make the burgers stand up and Sing!! I'm making these again tonight and I am going to stuff a couple of them with blue cheese! AAAAHH Thank You for an outstanding burger recipe!!!             ♥ Patty ♥

This recipe did produce a juicy burger, however it was a little bland. I think if you started with well seasoned patties, it would make a world of difference and really kick up the flavor. I sauteed some onions and mushrooms and added on top of the burgers, but it didn't taste like the mushroom and swiss burger from that fast food chain. I will make these again with a few changes.

I made these for my picky home from college son and they were a hit! So juicy and tasty! He uses no condiments on his burger so the taste has to in the meat and boy was it! I truly enjoyed it also. Happy I found this!

Absolutely Amazing!
Great flavor and tenderness from simmering the burger in the soup.
I picked up premade 1/4 Lb burgers from the butcher and cooked them on medium/high for 5 minutes on each side before adding the soup. Served on broisch rolls with muenster. 
They were perfect

I think it would be better if it was grilled for a few minutes after.  I thought the burgers were a tad bit more soggy that I would have liked.

We switched out the American cheese for Swiss, and it tasted like real french onion soup. Very easy to make, but they are the juiciest, most flavorful burgers!
