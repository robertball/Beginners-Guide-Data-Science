Delicious. Cut down the apples, though. Used 1 Gala I had to 4 medium white potatoes. Mixed half mayo and half bleu cheese salad dressing, and added the crumbled cheese to that. Needs quite a bit of salt and pepper, I thought. So just kept tasting until happy. This will be a go-to for parties. Dressy Potato Salad. :)

I loved it- and my guests! I never use exact measurements and I never peel anything (potatoes/apples) and it still turned out delicious! I mashed the potatoes with the blue cheese to help mix it in, which worked nicely. I will definitely make it again ??

I made this and really liked it. Next time I will use a little less blue cheese as I thought it was very strong. I will also use a little less apple and a little more potato. I saved a little of the blue cheese crumbles to use as a garnish with coursely ground black pepper. I'm still giving it 5 stars because it really is original and was well recieved by my guests.

This was pretty good.  I would mix the blue cheese into the dressing though so the blue cheese flavor is more evenly distributed.  The apples add a nice crunch and bright flavor to the salad.
