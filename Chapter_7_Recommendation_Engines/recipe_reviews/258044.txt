Followed the recipe, did not change a thing. Glad I didn't because it was very good as written. The cinnamon sprinkle over the rice and the strawberries was to me what took it over the top.

6.9.17   Texture was very creamy, and flavor really was classic rice pudding.  Just a tad on the sweet side for us; I'd probably cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup in the future (personal taste preference).

Rice pudding is by far my favorite dessert so I had to make this recipe, I actually had to make it twice.  The recipe is delicious and it truly wears the "Classic" name  well.  The first time around I made the recipe exactly as called for and it came out a little soupy even though it did thicken up after chilling it.  The flavor was great, there just didn't seem to be enough rice.  

Second time around I made it with a bit more rice, using 1/2 cup of rice to 1 1/3 cups of water (as stated on the Uncle Ben's box and used 1 1/4 Teaspoons of corn starch.  The result was exactly what I was looking for and this recipe is now in the book for us.  Thank you!

Uncle Ben's Classic Rice Pudding is indeed the classic rice pudding recipe, enjoyed by my adult family members. I remained true to the basic recipe, adding a few of my own touches. My friend , Barbara of Scherer Farms in Bandon, OR, an Ocean Spray (R) supplier, gifted me a bag of her luscious berries which I rehydrated in orange juice. (Grand Marnier or Triple Sec would be nice too) I also freshly ground cinnamon that paired well with the cranberries. The pudding was lush and creamy when warm but as is with cooled pasta and rice, the custard was totally absorbed making the consistency dense and heavy, yet still very tasty. If serving this pudding cold, I'd recommend decreasing the rice to 1/4 cup. By consensus, everyone agreed that the servings should be 6 ounces rather than 8 ounces. It was too generous a serving after a big meal. Thank you Uncle Ben's Converted Rice, and thanks to my family for this delicious opportunity!

I followed the recipe exactly except i accidentally used a whole egg instead of yolk, and it was still delicious!  A little too soupy, but I think thatâ€™s because of the extra whites.

I made a couple of changes, using brown rice, instead of white. I also added vanilla extract and raisins. Turned out awsome!!!! Will make this again.

I would make it again. I did use cardamom instead instead of cinnamon, but that is just personal preference. The color of the final product is very yellow due to the egg yolks. My family loved the pudding and no one said anything about the yellow color. This is my first
Time making rice pudding, and I am happy with the results of this recipe.

I usually make rice pudding in my pressure cooker because of the convenience however this recipe was as effortless and just as good. I wasn't sure about a recipe with corn starch but it's pudding so it makes sense and didn't affect the taste.  Will make again.

This rice pudding tasted so good, both warm and cold. It's so creamy. My only issue is that I thought 1/3 c sugar would be too sweet, so like another reviewer, I cut it down to 1/4 cup, which was still nice and sweet. I love rice pudding for breakfast, so I think I would cut the sugar to 3 T if using for that purpose.

It was a very tasty pudding, very different to the recipe I'm used to. It didn't take me 25 minutes to cook the rice, it was just a few minutes. It was a little bit sweet for me so I added an extra 1/3 of a cup of milk. I used raspberries  as  I had some that needed to be used. Very creamy . Next time I make it I will reduce the sugar a little and I'll try to cook it for a little bit longer so the rice is even softer.

My family really loved this. Definitely a classic. I thought it was a tad too sweet but I was outvoted by the rest of the family they all thought it was perfect. I served it cold. Made a great cool dessert after a hot day.

This was wonderful! So creamy and delicious. The only tweak I made was to use half cream and half skim milk - just to give it a little extra creaminess. It's sweet and custard-y, with the perfect ratio of  rice to custard. I did add the optional blueberries and cinnamon. So yummy!

This recipe is simply delicious.  Rice pudding has been a favorite dessert of mine since I was a little girl, and I am very picky about it.  It can't be too thick, it can't be too runny, and the taste has to be just right.  This recipe is as close to perfect as I've ever found.  I followed the directions to the "T" and added a bit of cinnamon and whipped cream to the top.  I had to fight my kids for the last bite!

I veganized this recipe using soy milk (almond, coconut or any other plant milk would be great, too) and 2 flax eggs (you could also use the Follow Your Heart Egg or EnerG Egg Replacer), and I used coconut sugar instead of the white sugar. It's quick and easy and very delicious! It reminded me of my childhood, when my mom used to make rice pudding for us. Next time, I think I'll add some raisins like my mom used to.

This was so so easy to get together and had a rich and creamy taste.   I did have a problem as some others did of having too much water left over when the rice was cooked, so, I just strained it and returned it to the pan.   Mine turned out quite a bit thicker than it seems did for others, so, I think I may have boiled it too long once adding the egg yolks.  It had good flavor though and I would make it again.  To make it more traditional I added cinnamon and raisins.

I knew I should have doubled this recipe!    It was very hard for me not to add cinnamon as that is how I was taught.  Once I added raspberries though, this was a hit in my house!  I followed other recommendations of reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup - next time I might reduce that more.  All in all, a fabulous dish....8 thumbs up!

This recipe is a little different than the one I normally use for rice pudding, which calls for me to bake the dish, so I was a little skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised at the results. It was creamy, rich, perfectly sweet and downright yummy. I topped mine with a little sweetened condensed milk and raspberries. So good! I'm glad I bought the big box of Uncle Ben's rice.

Made the recipe exactly, and absolutely loved how creamy it is. It's almost exactly a traditional, old fashioned, 150 year old recipe used for rice pudding. It's supposed to be this creamy, as historically this is how rice pudding is made...with milk or cream, sugar and long grain rice...thickened with corn starch and increased in richness by the egg yolks. Part of the reason it is so creamy is because of the converted rice used...if it were a long or medium grain I think you'd see the same amount of rice absorb more. A short grain rice would make it a bit sticky. So, in terms of taste, absolutely 5 stars...texture may be a bit more like 4 stars. But the thing that totally won me over was the glorious yellow skin that formed over the top of the rice pudding...I love that creaminess with the film, telling you the rice pudding has been perfectly made...it gives me that Anne of Green Gables feel... Enjoy!

This is the first time I made rice pudding.  I live at high altitude and I think the altitude had an effect on the rice. My tips would be to use 1 and 1/4 tsp. corn starch and use 1 and 1/3 cups of rice as recommended in Howard's review.  Also, when the rice comes to a boil remove from heat or your rice will lose the creaminess.

This was so good! I will try it next time with 1/2 cup of rice. I had to pour off some of the water before adding milk. I will make this again! There was 3 of us and it was eaten very fast! Yummy!

I have this a four because the pudding part was absolutely divine but had issues with the rice. Mine took longer to cook and still didn't absorb as much liquid as I expected. Could be the heat in my burner but I don't know. To be honest in past I've used this converted rice with great success so I'm not sure what happened. Directions easy to follow and yield a silky beautiful pudding. Definitely thickens as it cools. I'll make again but play with the rice part.

We don't eat sweets for dessert so this was a delicious cold breakfast on a hot morning. I simply made it the night before. After reading the reviews, I made a couple of changes. I used 1/4 cup of sugar and added a 1/4 cup of rice. For us it was a perfect balance of ingredients; not too soupy and not too sweet (because we added fresh berries). The rice cooked perfectly and even the next day held its shape yet was tender to the tooth without being mushy. It's a beautiful and elegant dish; definitely brunch worthy.
