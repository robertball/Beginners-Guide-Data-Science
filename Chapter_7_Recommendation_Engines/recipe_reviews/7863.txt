This was, surprisingly, a little bland.  However, after it soaked into the cake a little longer (2nd day)it tasted delicious.  I made a three layer cake and put this between one layer and an apricot filling between the other layer.  They complimented each other well.  I topped it off with Special Buttercream Frosting also found on this site.

This filling is a basic custard, very nice texture.  I did need to add more amaretto.

I just made this and loved it, I am a chef and making a cake for a friend that loves almonds.  I didn't have the liquor so I used almond extract, I just used a little bit more almond extract, about 1 or 2 teaspoons, and I put in one tbsp of vanilla extract.  I would recomment this to anyone, it's super easy and good. :)

Very good and easy to make. I substituted almond extract for amaretto liqueur.

I did not have any luck with this filling.  It turned out very lumpy and smelled bad.  I didn't even get past that to find out what it tasted like.  I'm not sure what happened, if it was me or the receipe.  I guess I'll have to give it another try to find out.

Perfect for my petit fours! Not too heavy of a taste, but just enough! I love the custard texture.

I used 1 T almond extract and 1t. vanilla. It has a little too much extract taste from the almond but I'm using this in some bread pudding so hopefully this will be ok for that. It is a little bland too. I love almond flavored desserts and cookies so a little disappointing. To keep this from clumping, you need to consantantly stir with a whisk. It starts out clumpy but it will stir out.

Maybe it was something I did wrong, but it tasted like tapioca pudding to me. I will NEVER use this again. I didn't put this on my cake.

I made this as a filling for chocolate cake and it wa a HUGE hit.  I did use a quarter cup or so of almond paste instead of Amaretto liqueur because it was left over from making an almond cake.  I grated the paste to make sure it would mix well.  It was wonderful!  I also added mayby a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  Very very good.  Thanks Carol!

It was ok.  Just wanted to use the egg yolks I had left from making the White Almond Wedding Cake, and found this.  Came out very thick and really didn't make too much, but was still ok for using as a thin filling for between layers.

Yuck, tasted like straight up alcohol. I guess I did something wrong but my custard was lumpy, chunky, runny, and inedible. I had to toss the whole batch.

I used 1/3 cup sugar and tempered the eggs in after the rest of the mixture had come to a boil. Cooked over med-low heat for about an extra minute after tempering the eggs and then added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp almond extract along with 1 tbs amaretto. Came out really smooth and delicious. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with scrambled eggs with milk in it. Best to temper those eggs!

Delicious!  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract for a little extra, and doubled the recipe for a three layer 9" cake.  Yum!
