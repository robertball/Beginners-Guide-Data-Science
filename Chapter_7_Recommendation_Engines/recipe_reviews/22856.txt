Super delicious! I've made it twice in one week. The glaze is just firm enough not to be runny but isn't unnaturally firm. For a single pie use 1-1/2 cups water, 1-1/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons cornstarch and 3 tablespoons Jell-O powder. Also, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice (this really adds fresh flavor). Quarter the berries to get more glaze flavor mixed through, especially if the berries aren't the ripest.

I've been using this recipe for years and is very quick, easy and delicious. It's known as the Shoney's Strawberry Pie at my house because it is SOOO very close to the pie that Shoney's restaurant serves.  I use less water, cornstarch, and sugar than listed here. I do recommend having your water boiling and slowly STIR in the sugar and cornstarch (that you have already measured out and mixed together) otherwise the cornstarch can lump up like lard in the water and become insoluble.

Very good and easy.  I added a thin layer of custard at the bottom, lined with strawberries cut in half and covered in glaze.  I made the glaze recipe for 1 pie as listed by another reviewer.  It still made ALOT.  I only used half of it.  Gave enough strawberry flavor and sweet, but if I used the whole thing, it would have been too goopy and sweet.  I topped each serving with a little whipped cream.  Yummy!  (If you want to add a layer of custard, mix 1 T. sugar, 1 T. cornstarch, pinch of salt, 1 beaten egg yolk, 1 c. milk, half'n half or cream and heat, stirring constantly until thickens.  Take off burner, add 1 t. vanilla.  Let cool slightly, spread into bottom of pie crust.  Let cool completely before adding strawberries.)

This is similar to my grandmother's recipe.  It is requested often.  The only variations are less water (1 cup), more cornstarch (3 Tbsp) plus the addition of 2 Tbsp light karo syrup.  This is the only strawberry pie my family makes.  It is wonderful!

Soooo delicious!!!  I made this pie in 5 minutes flat.  I reduced the sugar by using a 0.6 ounce package of sugar free jello instead of a 3 ounce jello package.  Also, the jello was blackcherry, not strawberry, which gave it a VERY FRESH taste.  I'll definitely be making this extremely quick and yummy pie again!!!!

Tastes just like the original strawberry pie that was served at Big Boy's restaurants when I was younger. (Their pies now just do not compare to this.)

Very refreshing! I liked the idea of using Splenda and suger free gelatin, and even used a low calorie premade gramham crust instead of pie crust. Fantastic! I will make this everytime strawberries are in season, and I think using 'peaches" with peach jello would be just as good...

This is a definite keeper. Will be my family summer dessert. My children loved it. Instead of sugar I used splenda and sugar free strawberry gelatin for those counting calories it was incredible.  My dad and husband were impressed.

This is very good. I made it as called for except halved to just 1 pie (and I slightly shorted it on sugar), cutting the strawberries into pieces. Served it with whipped cream, in a shortbread crust. I thought the whole thing together was great. However I think the gelatin flavor was kind of lacking as is. I meant to add some lemon juice to it per suggestions, but forgot. So, that is why I give it four stars, the filling as-is was not astounding. Still really good though.

Perfect!  I "painted" the crust with melted white chocolate chips to prevent a soggy crust.  I also combined the sugar and cornstarch before adding to boiling water, and sliced my berries.  Two thumbs up!

I had high hopes for this pie!  I sliced my strawberries instead of leaving them whole.  The glaze mix looked firm enough...but after several hours of chilling, I had strawberry pie SOUP!  The pie was firmer the next day, but then the crust was soggy and the berries were soft.  I don't know if it was slicing the berries that did it or if it was the 2 cups of sugar??  It was VERY sweet and almost tasted medicinal.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added lemon juice, which really helped to tone down the sweetness.  Will probably not make again.

This pie came out perfect and tasted fantastic! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly with just a couple minor changes. I used sugar free gelatin to cut down on the calories and I halved the strawberries instead of keeping them whole. I also recommend using more than 2 quarts of strawberries. I used 2 quarts per pie because I like my pies full! I was worried it wasn't going to set right per what other reviewers had said but it was perfect! I took one of the pies to a bbq and it got devoured! Everyone loved it. Will definitely be making again!

Excellent.  Only change I made was to cut back on the sugar by half a cup.  Works well with other kinds of fruit (raspberries, peaches) and jell-o, too.  This is a definite favorite around here!

We loved this.  The only difference was I sliced up my strawberries and added Cool whip over the entire pie.  I am making this again for when hubby gets back from Japan.  :)

Fool proof crowd pleaser. I look forward to making these every summer. So many variations are possible, but the original is perfect and super easy. A shortbread crust and cream cheese base make this is perfect fresh summery pie!

Great recipe!  Same as the one I grew up making with my mother, except we coated the pie crust with a thin layer of soft cream cheese.  It keeps the crust from becoming soggy from the gelatin and it adds great flavor!

This is a great recipe, I made it yesterday, and Hubby said the only thing that would make it better, is fresh strawberry's from our garden.He is right.  The only thing I did different, was I used no sugar gelatin. Very good and a keeper for sure.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is awesome!!!The only thing I did different was to use the Strawberry Daiquiri flavor jello  and I cut the water by 1/2 cup. If you like strawberries you have to try this it is restaurant quality for sure and use deep dish pie crusts you will need them!!!!

This is a great, light dessert!  You can eat a big piece and feel like you haven't had anything.  I never change up recipes, but I did use low calorie jell-o and light whipped topping.  Guiltless!

Tasted pretty good.  It was very sweet.  I wish the sauce would have held together a little bit more solid, but the pieces didn't fall apart when I cut it like it has with other recipes.  I stirred the glaze into the berries and poured some on top as well.

Strawberry pie is so simple and delicious to make.  This recipe is a very good one.  I halved the ingredients as I only made 1 pie and I cut my strawberries.  I thought it was a little on the sweet side and next time I would cut the sugar back to about ¾ cup.  It doesn’t get much more “summer” for me than a slice of strawberry pie with whipped topping.

Very tasty. I added a little bit of lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Oh, and to eliminate lumps, I mixed the corn starch with 1/2 cup of the water before adding it to the saucepan with the rest of the water and sugar.

I made this as the dessert for a cookout party we had and it was a success but I will make some changes the next time I make it...

Firstly, I only used 1 cup of sugar since many reviewers talked about how sweet the original recipe was and 1 cup was not quite enough.  Next time I make it I will try using 1 1/2 cups to see if that is adequate.

Secondly, I used 5 tblsp cornstarch and the filling/glaze congealed too much as it chilled and became a gel.  I think the 3 tblsp would have been enough.  

I'm getting ready to remake the pies with my suggested changes and we'll see how that goes.

All in all, though, it was still darned good and I would serve it again - I just think these changes would make it superb!

Very, very good! I thawed out some strawberries i'd frozen in the beginning of the summer for the filling and used peach jello in place of the strawberry. I then placed everything into the Easy Pie Crust recipe from this site. The resulting pie was amazing, and everyone, even my dad who doesn't like strawberries, thought it was great.

Everyone liked this. I subbed plain flour in the place of cornstarch -- worked fine. Easy pie, but I guess I expected better flavour. I had to halve the ingredients and because we can't stand really sweet foods I only used 2 tblspn of sugar plus jelly. Dh and kids said they wouldn't want it any sweeter, so if you're not a fan of too much sugar keep that in mind. Dh did make a request for a little layer of caramel next time. Overall, a keeper but I will play with it. Maybe using real strawberry syrup instead of water?

Easy, excellent recipe.  I had very large strawberries, so I quartered them, other than that I didn't change a thing.  Everyone said it was the best strawberry pie they had ever had.

This was so yummy.  I used 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar, 3 T cornstarch and the sugar free black cherry jello and graham cracker crust.  It really was a good blend of tart and sweet and was very refreshing.  Very easy and very delicious.

My boyfriend's mom made this for dinner last week, so I got the recipe and made it for a picnic with a group this weekend. Everyone loves it. I used a graham cracker crust--it was super easy and tasted great. I also used sugar-free jell-o. I didn't add sugar, and I'm not sure that it needs any. Though, if the strawberries aren't particularly sweet, the extra sugar might help!

Next time I will omit the gelatin.  The flavor was good but I didn't like the texture.  Very easy recipe, not too sweet nor plain.  Flavor is very good. I made my own pie crust for this recipe.

I adore strawberry pie, but I don’t like the goo that goes with it. The jello was a good addition that thickened it just right. Made whipped cream for the top and had no leftovers.

I made this using 1 cup sugar. It was plenty sweet enough, especially considering that the jello is sweet also. It was good but a little too jello-y for me. Not sure what the solution should be. Maybe more strawberries?

I starting making this pie last summer. For those watching their sugar, I use sugar substitute and sugar-free Jello, Still taste great! My husband wants me to make it every week when fresh strawberries start coming in.

I cut the sugar back a bit and it was still very, very sweet.  I also put some cool whip on the top cause it tasted a bit like eating strawberry jam without it.  It was pretty good and very easy and quick.  I will try this again, but next time, cut the sugar by half.

I have been making this pie for the last three years when we have berries in season. It's best with fresh picked berries. I've also subbed peaches and peach flavored jello and i almost like it better than the strawberry version. Was wondering if anyone has tried any other fruit... cherries for instance? And how it turned out. Thanks!

I made 2 of these strawberry pies and took them to a pool party.  They were the hit of the party and not a crumb was left.

This recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL...I made this pie last night and I gotta tell you it is soooooooo good...I'm going to make another one today for my neighbor...I believe she will enjoy this pie as much as I did...I followed the recipe exactly as stated except I boiled the 2 1/2 cups of water BEFORE I added it to the sugar and cornstarch. I also used SUGAR FREE Jello....I had extra strawberry glaze because I only made one pie last night but that was OK with me...I'd far rather have extra than not enough...I covered the berries with as much glaze as my pie shell would hold...This recipe is a definite keeper.  Not only is this pie easy to make it is sooooooo yummy...THANK YOU SO MUCH for this recipe...I LOVE THIS PIE.

I topped this with whipping cream and it was a wonderful Strawberry Pie.  The only thing I did different was add a dash of salt and a little lemon juice to brighten the flavor as I do with lots of dishes I prepare.  Before making this I had read some other recipes and there were comments that they did not make enough filling for 2 pies, so naturally I wondered if I would have enough.  Let me assure you that if using bought 9" Deep Dish Pie Crusts (I used Pet Ritz)you will have plenty of filling.  My two pies were filled completely full.

I took a risk and made this for company without making it for myself first. It was delicious and was gone by evening's end. I like my pies stuffed full, so even though I stuck to the recipe, I used the most of it to fill one pie. I had a small amount leftover that I saved and ate later. This is a keeper!

Yummmm...I've made this twice (when strawberries are on sale! It's very similar to Marie Callendar's strawberry pie. I left the strawberries whole and used only enough glaze to coat the berries and maybe half way up the crust. I eat it with fresh whipped cream.

Very good pie recipe. I did add an extra tsp. cornstarch. I did not have a problem with the filling being runny. My family and friends gobbled down and I made two pies!!

BOMB!!!!  Will be making this one again for sure but might try and make the gelatin sauce a little less firm.  I used tbsp. of lemon juice and also used tropical flavored jello since strawberry flavor is not my favorite.  Worth making for sure!

This recipe worked very nicely with frozen strawberries.  I just defrosted and drained my strawberries really well before I put them into the crusts.  The recipe made enough glaze for 3 pies... easily.  The glaze set up really well and everybody in my family was amazed that "the pie didn't run".  Will be making it again... and again... and again.

Everyone thought this pie was good (strawberry pie is hard to beat). Being my own worst critic, I thought the glaze jelled a little to much so I might have cooked it to long? I probably decreased the sugar to much fearing it would be too sweet.

I don't care much for strawberries but they are my husband's favorite.  I was surprised that even I liked this pie.  Great recipe!

Loved this! The perfect pie for a summer night. I only made one pie (later wished I had made a second!). To do so, I halved all the measurements. I ended up having more than enough. I know another reviewer gave different measurements for one pie, but I think it would be too much of the liquid. However, I did add a little lemon juice and salt as that reviewer suggested and quartered the strawberries. Excellent recipe with a beautiful presentation...just bought more strawberries to make another one tonight!

This was pretty good.  I did find it a little too sweet, so if I make it again, I will decrease the amount of white sugar.  The sugar in the Jello more than adequately will cover it.

i know that this could be a five star recipe. i attempted to reduce calories by using splenda and sugar free jello. i do not recommend! somehow the splenda left a bitter aftertaste. next time i will indulge and follow recipe precisely. it is a pretty dessert and simple.
