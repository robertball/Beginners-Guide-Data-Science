My sister in West Va gave this recipe to me, and I have made it
many times..It is the best cookie I have eaten..the only fruit I put in is the candied cherries, it is unfornutate that we can only buy these at thanksgiving or christmas.I too thought the batter would not cover the fruits and nuts, but it is perfect..I highly recommend....

These are best if you seal them up for at least a week before serving. 

I first found this recipe in a circa 1965 magazine, and found that it got even BETTER if you soak the raisins OVERNIGHT. It works well with 'most any full-flavored liquor such as a dark rum or a brandy. I'm working on a light-batter version as well.

These came out dry for me though I haven't had one today, all reviews indicate they are better a day after baked. I made them larger than the recipe indicated and baked them 14 min. That seemed to help. The flavor is great though. I used spiced rum.

I made these for my brother who was serving in Korea and have sent them every Xmas since.  I wrap 2 back to back in Saran & tie with Xmas wire or yarn.  No need for a metal can for mailing.  Just fill the box with the wrapped cookies & add a few candy canes.He refuses to let me stop this tradition.  I'm 73 now!

Good.  I was a little concerned that the amount of batter I had wouldn't cover all the fruit and nuts, but it did.  The bourbon is very strong, I used Jack Daniels.

These cookies are excellent!  I have made other candied fruit based cookies and these are by far the best.  I couldn't find candied lemon but I was able to find Fruit Cake Mix in a 32oz. container and it contained orange and lemon peel along with cherries, pineapple and citron.  I used the whole 32 oz. container and added more whole pecans than indicated as I love nuts!  These are wonderful and I recommend to anyone, even those who typically don't like fruitcake!  I did use dried cranberries soaked in Brandy as I didn't have raisins nor bourbon!  The taste is exceptional!

Christmas and Lizzies go together.  This is such a special recipe.  Thanks for providing this as I had lost my Woman's Day recipe from the 60-70's in the move.  I only soaked the raisins in Rum overnight.  I also added candied pineapple to the fruit mix just cause it was available.  Merry Christmas.

My mom has made these cookies every year for the better part of 30 years and I love them.  I have also tried making a more natural version with dried cherries and figs along with the bourbon soaked raisins and they were delicious.  They're easy and unique, and they freeze well too.
