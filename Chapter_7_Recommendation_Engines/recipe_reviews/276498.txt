So delicious and satisfying! Upped the garlic a bit  and served with a basil marinara, grated fresh Parmesan and a salad. Healthy comfort food.

So easy and the whole family liked them! Nice to have them baked--less mess, less constant attention. Next time I'll spray the pan .

I made these for my daycare kids, they were a hit. Only changes I made was to use stovetop stuffing instead of breadcrumbs (didnâ€™t have any) left out most of the garlic and I grated about a cup of zucchini into the mix. They were moist and delicious!
