Really good.  Onions caramelized in 30 mins. I substituted red wine and added thyme as suggested by another reviewer.  The soup was really wonderful and my husband asked me to make it again. I only had whole wheat bread - which was a horrible substitute. I agree this really only serves 2 people.  ( Also! Make sure you have bowls to put under the broiler before you make!)

Really good the only thing I would change is adding garlic and using a combination of cheeses - I use parmesan, provolone and swiss.

Made a few minor changes:  Used vegetable broth rather than beef.  Added a sprig of fresh thyme along with the bay leaves.  Finished the soup with a traditional splash of brandy.  I agreed with a previous reviewer that this does not really make six servings (unless you eat your soup from a custard cup).  I filled two french onion soup crocks and had just enough left over for a small lunch-size serving.  Also, it took over an hour for the onions to properly caramelize to a nutty brown color.  At the thirty minute mark, the onions had no color at all.  So give yourself a little extra time for this recipe.  You won't be sorry.

Yummy onion soup.  I used vidalia onions, only 1 bay leaf and out of necessity, Honey Brown beer in place of the wine.  The beer accented the sweetness of the onions nicely.  After tasting the soup, I added a pinch of thyme... Delish.  Thanks!

This gets 5 stars b/c it is easy to make and the result is delicious - I followed the directions exactly and it was a great soup.  The onions smelled up the house pretty bad though, so make sure you leave all the windows open :)

Used vidalia onions, red wine, 1 cup of water, 1 bay leaf, and 1 tablespoon Worceshire sauce. All great suggestions.  6 servings did turn out to be equal to three servings.  Took over an hour for the onions to cook and they still weren't brown, but by then we were too hungry to wait any longer.  I don't think I sliced my onions thin enough.

This recipe was really good! I took into consideration that everyone who reviewed it said that it was actually only three servings-so I doubled the recipe. I also did as others suggested and added worcheshire sauce while on the stove. Also sprinkled some paprika on top of the cheese before it went into the oven. Absolutely fantastic!

I am really impressed with how this came out! I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but I still had to have a bowl...so good! My onions took about an hour to caramelize, and I used chicken broth instead of beef broth because it was all I had on hand. It was a little on the tangy side. My french onion soup-obsessed boyfriend preferred it this way, and thought it was a change I made 'on purpose'. I used a teeny bit less white wine and only 1 bay leave, and added salt and pepper to the onions as they were caramelizing. I also buttered the bread and sprinkled it with garlic powder before toasting in the oven. I'll definitely make this one again!!

My son wanted a bowl of onion soup one evening.  We went through Allrecipes and chose what we thought was the simplest to make.  It turned out great!  It was so quick and easy to make.  We love onion soup and tasted many at various restaurants and this comes pretty close.  I did buy sweet white onions and used a good bottle of wine.  Also used shredded mozzarella with guyerre cheese instead.  I've made it twice and both times it turned out well.

I made this for dinner and was very impressed. We had it with crusty fresh bread on the side as well as in the soup, the swiss cheese was yummy! I always play around with recipes but this was a great base to start with!Many thanks!

I made this a couple nights ago and the hubby loved it. I thought it was a bit sweet but good, perhaps it was the wine I used. The only subsitution I made was vegetable broth instead of beef broth. I do agree with other reviewers about both the longer cook time for the onions and that it really only serves about 3. Good recipe. Thanks.

Really simple, really good on a winter night.  Used only one bay leaf and a pinch of thyme. Have made it with and without the flour and either way is good.  My daughter loves this!

To get a rich color and onion flavor, try placing your onion rings in a covered bowl and microwave first for 20 minutes.  Transfer to a dutch onion with a little butter and cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping up the brown bits.  Deglaze the pot with a little water and continute to cook and stir another 6 minutes. Do this 3 times and on your final deglaze, use the wine, cook down till it evaporates, then add your broth, bay leaf or whatever and go from there.

Made today.  I found it to be lacking in the robust beef flavor of others I have had.  Next time I will add some garlic and use all beef stock in place of water.  Used a combination of cheeses which my family enjoyed.

Caramelizing the onions (I only used 3) took me more than 1 hour and at Med Heat. I skipped the wine and added a pinch of thyme. It was a tasty and filling soup.

I have made this many times with several variations.  You can substitute chicken broth for beef or red wine for white.  It's also good with whatever type of onion you like.  I like this with sweet onions or red onions. I also typically add black pepper and substitute pepper jack cheese.

This was really good. Adjusted for our tastes. Added 2 Cloves of Garlic with the onion. 1 T of W Sauce, Omitted the Wine and increased the Broth. Sauteed the Vidalia Onions for 1 hour and then simmered for 30 minutes. Used Swiss & Provolone Cheeses. I do agree, this only made 3 Servings and I think there was too much onion to broth as it evaporates as it simmers, I just kept adding broth... Overall very good soup.

Onions never did get brown, not even after an hour. I thought it was a fair recipe, but too sweet, too much basil and not enough salt.  Added some soy sauce, as well as a little thyme. Makes enough for 3 servings. Not bad at all, but not great.

I used this recipe as I couldn't find my standard one from a Working Mother Magazine article circa early 90s and this seemed the most similar.  I too had a hard time getting the onions to brown.  I used 5 organic white onions and cooked them for over an hour and there was no carmelization at all.  I used a dutch oven and not a stockpot so I would have more surface area to brown the onions. I added a sprig of fresh thyme and 2 minced garlic cloves too.  Instead of canned broth, I used 2 boxes of organic Pacific Brand broth from Trader Joe's and my husband liked the less salty flavor. Subbed gruyere for Swiss and added a bit of heavy cream just before serving too as a splurge for Xmas eve dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful. The half an hour spent on cooking the onions is absolutely necessary as it gives a fantastic creamy taste and texture. With a splash of cream it is magic. Didn't have any white wine on hand but didn't seem to miss it. Like others have said the recipe "for 6" makes enough for 2 really, which was perfect for us.

Really good! Onions took longer than 30 minutes, though (I only used 2). I think I simmered it too long because it was very thick but still great! I added a clove of garlic and used less wine

This soup was good but too sweet for my taste.  Perhaps my onions were just sweet onions.  I did add a whole lot of crushed black pepper to the soup.

Next time I'll use just one bayleaf - 2 made it just a bit too strong.  Otherwise - it was great!

I made this soup last week for my picky husband.  It came out good - although I needed to add a table spoon of Worcestershire sauce for a little extra flavor.  When all was said and done - I think I would add red wine instead of white and I might add a bit more Worcestershire.  And I would cut the onions rather than keep them whole because it was a little messy to eat.

Absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of different reviewers and reduced the amount of water to 1 cup, and also added 2 beef bouillon cubes (one of my cans of beef broth was "low-sodium" so I needed the extra kick from bouillon).  Wonderful recipe that tastes just like it does in a restaurant.  Thanks!

HOLY COW this was soooo good! As a child, I was never fond of onions, but last week, on an impulse, I bought 10 lbs of onions for $1.49.  Then I needed to make something with them!  My boyfriend had the ingenious idea to make soup!  So I found this recipe and on Friday night I whipped it up.  It was fantastic!  The wine really added a nice touch.  I used all the same ingredients, but the quantities might have varied a little.  I'll be making this one again for sure!  Oh, there were 2 soups leftover (with bread and cheese and everything) which we ate the next day.  The bread was totally soaked with the soup liquid and it threw the whole thing into a new dimension of deliciousness! I did cook mine quite a bit longer than suggested by the recipe, about 30 minutes of cooking the onions alone, and then I boiled the soup a little to cook the onions a bit more and to reduce the liquid a bit.

Delicious! I made a few modifications. Substituted thyme for the bay leaves (didn't have any), mozzarella for the Swiss (also didn't have any), and used red wine for a more full-bodied flavour. With some salt and pepper the flavour was great. I'll definitely make this again.

Yum-my.  We used Sherry and only 3 sweet onions (they were very large), and it took almost an hour to get the onions almost-caramelized (I got impatient), and it was super yummy.  Just what my prego craving called for :)

I skipped the wine because I was out and the flour (I do not like a thick broth).  I added a little bit of thyme.  I really liked the addition of the bay leaf.  I do not carmelize the onions just cook them until soft and the soup is still good.  I also use mozzarella instead of swiss.  With these additions this will be the soup recipe I keep. Thanks for the recipe.

i've tried so many french onion soup recipes and this soup was amazing and simple! i used non-meat beef stock cubes because i don't eat meat and it was so good my husband kept going for more! it definitely needed salt and pepper but that could be because i used the bouillon. thank you!

I acquired an enormous bag of huge onions in Costco for very little, so it occurred to me to make French onion soup, since we love good filling soups for supper, and I was afraid they would soon go bad.. After studying a bunch of recipes I picked this one, and was mostly very happy with it, but there are a couple of things I need to change when I make it next time, and as I still have lots of onions, there will soon be a next time.

I changed a few things: due to not having, amazingly, having any beef broth, I substituted veal broth that I had had for a long time and needed to get rid of. I didn't quite have enough, so I topped it up with chicken bouillon. Don't quite know how much 28 ounces is, but I made a liter and a half of broth, which seemed to be about right. I didn't add any extra water. I had run out of bay leaves, but added a half teaspoon of  dried thyme. Went out the next day and bought bay leaves, but next time, I'll keep the thyme as well - it was excellent! 

I saw no reason to use both butter and olive oil to sauté the onions, so used only butter. However after half an hour they weren't caramelized. I didn't have time to continue, but next time, I'll either up the heat or cook the onions longer, as I imagine caramelization would make this soup even better. I also used some slightly stale thick-cut sour dough bread instead of French bread, which I think was brilliant! I may try the suggestion next time to substitute vermouth or dry sherry for the white wine.

I made this multiple times and each time the onions took longer than the 30 minutes to become translucent and browned around the edges, it took approximately 50 minutes. I increased wine to 3/4 cup as it needed more flavor. Other additions that helped the flavor were adding garlic salt, cracked black pepper and fresh thyme. I put the thyme in when I put the bay leaves in an removed it when I removed the bay leaves.

I don't usually use the broiler so I wasn't sure if I needed to do the high or low setting. I should have used the low. I ended up burning the cheese and bread. I didn't really car for the soup either. I've had this soup once before.

I rated it 5 because of its simplicity. I did need to substitute red wine as I was out of white. I would say to really watch cheese as it broils as mine browned really FAST! Everyone loved it and I will certainly make again

Outstanding!  I had a goal of learning to make French Onion Soup the way restaurants serve it, bought the oven handle bowls, and followed this recipe (I always look for the easy-to-follow ones).   My first time and it was great. Was a bit sweeter than I expected but we all loved it.   It is a forever keeper!

this was such an easy onion soup to make with simple ingredients. i used red onions because that was all i had and i substituted marsala wine for the white whine. i ended up using a little more liquid which was chicken stock just because i had it in my fridge (maybe a cup) and i couldnt taste any difference. my friends and i loved it so it will definately be made again.

Delicious!
Although I found that the 6 servings really only equalled 2 servings (granted, we filled two french onion soup bowls right to the brim).  Very easy to make.....and very good too.  Will make it often.

Fantastic! This is the first time I've ever made French Onion soup & I doubled the recipe & it worked great! The only thing different I did was add some Worcestershire sauce & topped with Asiago cheese. This was a hit with the whole family. THanks for a great & EASY recipe!!

This soup is incredible!! I used sweet onions for sauteing.  I also substituted red wine since I was out of white wine and vermouth.  I also added pepper and thyme while sauteing the onions!! Perfect anytime!! My husband ate the whole pot and I will make more this week!!

Unfortunately I had only chicken broth & beef bullion cubes. Really diminished the rich flavor the onions needed. I should have waited to cook it another day

My husband and I loved it just the way the recipe is except I used sherry instead of white wine.  Will be making this regularly.
