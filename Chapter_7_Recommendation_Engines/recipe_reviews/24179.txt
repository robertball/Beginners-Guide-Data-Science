This was pretty unusual.  I served it as a dip, but I think it would be better as a topping for grilled pork or fish.

I won't be making this again.  Way too much balsamic vinegar and the combination with onions was too wierd for me.  It definitely can't be eaten on its own.  My husband had a little bit with his meat and didn't mind the strong flavor when mixed, so maybe that's the way to use it up.
