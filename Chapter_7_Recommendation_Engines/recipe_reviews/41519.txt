Very good and easy! I used only 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, (which was enough for us) and reduced the garlic and onion powder by 1/4 tsp! I had to microwave the mix for a few seconds so that it was easier to spread over the crossiants but the result was tasty and they went well with our dinner. Would make for a good appetizer and I wonder if they would be good dipped in pizza sauce...something I might have to try next time!

Saw this listed on "Recipes of the Day." Read the recipe and thought, Wow that's easy. I can use up the can of crescent dinner rolls left over from Thanksgiving. I was just about to take out of oven, my two sons, 13 & 11 said, "What smells, so good? Are we having Pizza for dinner?" Well, we had them as an appetizer while waiting for the pizza man to deliver our pie.  Thanks McCormick!

Very good- I added a few red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  No leftovers on these!

Very simple recipe.  I also put the cream cheese mixture in the microwave for a few seconds and it was very spreadable.  I served this with a marinara sauce and pasta and these were great to mop up the sauce!

These are good and very simple to make.  They are definitely best right out of the oven though.  I would make these again...

These were good. However I am a cream cheese lover, and I would have liked more of a cream cheese taste.  The bread sorta soaked up the cream cheese and left the seasonings, which were good, but I think next time I'll use more cream cheese.  Very easy and good though.

I definitely needed to cut the Italian seasoning in half. I added more parmesan and then topped it with the last little bit of mozzarella I had.  I still dipped them in marinara sauce.  Not on my list to make again.

I can't find crescent rolls where I live (Australia), so I made some puff pastry shapes and then spread the cheese on top when done baking.  Initially I tried to make pinwheels wiht the puff pastry, but the dough never fully cooked in the center.  It tastes just as good spread on top after the baking!  My guests ate them all up!
