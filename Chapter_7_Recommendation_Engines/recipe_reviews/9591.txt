These pretty cookies are light, tender and buttery but still have texture and crunch from the oatmeal and Rice Krispies.  Another reviewer commented about "greasiness" and, since I'm familiar with cookies like this with that characteristic, I preemptively cut the oil back from one cup to 2/3 cup.  That obviously did the trick because greasiness was not an issue.  Just for something different I used rainbow chips (readily available online) rather than chocolate chips.

These cookies are wonderful! The only thing lacking is the directions. Here's how I made them: Cream the butter. Cream sugars in. Add egg and mix well. Add oil and vanilla and mix well.  Add cream of tartar, baking soda and salt. Mix well. Add flour, one cup at a time, mixing well after each. (Up to the point, I used a hand mixer.) Mix in oats, then cereal and chocolate chips, by hand. I never time anything, so I can't say how long I've baked them, but they are a tender, crispy...wonderful cookie!

These were so yummy.  I found 12-13 minutes was the perfect cooking time.

These cookies are delicious. They have a really good buttery taste. The consistancy is like potato chip cookies. I think it is possible to use a little less oil which I am going to try next time.

I never write reviews online unless something is extraordinarily bad or overwhelmingly good.  Thus said: BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE EVER.  A melt-in-your-mouth, light and crispy texture with a wonderful *rich* flavor.  Thanks J.Clark - you win!

After reading the reviews I used 1/2 C. oil & 1/2 C. Almond Butter instead of p'nut butter cause I wanted a less subtle nut butter taste. I used 2 C. brown sugar & omitted the white sugar cause I love the taste of brown sugar. Great cookies but I'd like to make them a bit more moist.

I was really excited to try out this recipe based upon review; overall, I'm pretty satisfied. I did find that to keep the cookies rather chewy, you have to way undercook them, like 8 minutes at most or they will be like powdery crisp cookies. The second time around I actually altered it a bit; I put 2/3 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/3 cup of peanut butter chips, 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, the rest as normal. They were really good and literally had EVERYTHING.

These are great and they get gobbled up super fast, so it's a good thing they make a lot. I agree with the other comments that next time I'll try less oil--maybe as little as 1/2 of what's called for.  Still, it's a keeper!

These cookies were amazing.  I substituted Cocoa Pebbles for the crisp rice because that was all I had in the house.  I also used regular Oatmeal - not quick cook.  I will be making these over and over!

These cookies are amazing.  Soft bite, almost like shortbread, great flavor.  Makes a lot, too.  The classiest of chocolate chip cookies!
Baked for 18 minutes at mile-high altitude.

THESE ARE THE BEST!!!! I made lots of changes and they still came out great.  I left out the rice crispies, and added an extra 1/2 cup of oats (might even do more next time).  Also added about a cup of sweetened coconut flakes, and 2 cups of butterscotch chips.  The only negative on this recipe is that the directions (or should I say, lack of directions) are terrible.  I baked for about 15-20 min.  Just make sure they are browned and cooked all the way through.  I made one batch that was very light golden brown and it was very crumbly when it cooled.  The more well done ones held up way better.  I think it's the cream of tartar that makes them spread and become more crumbly, so just watch out for that when you are baking them.  Even with all those changes, these were OUTSTANDING.  Will definitely make again and again.

My daughter made these last night and they were wonderful.  She reduced the amount of oil to 2/3 cups as some of the other reviewers suggested to reduce greasiness. Also the recipe doesn't say how long to bake but it took 14-15 minutes.  I like my cookies a little crunchy but know that I'm in the minority.  The flavor and texture was wonderful and you can easily experiment on different candies to use. She used M&M's. Yum!!

I made these cookies for our family Christmas gathering.  Everyone loved them!  My 16 year old nephew even asked me for the recipe!

I use about 3/4 c oil instead of the full 1 c.  Also love to make it with half m and ms and half chocolate chips.  Favorite choc chip cookie recipe!

I am a cookie "goo-roo" and am always skeptical of "new" recipes..this one was FANTASTIC!!! THe ONLY thing that I did differently was to use crushed cornflakes instead of rice krispies (as that's all I had on hand) and it turned out BEAUTIFULLY!!! Everyong at my party was excited about the subtle crunch associated with these  cookies. I plan on making them for my next cookie exchange as they were THAT delicious!

Delicious cookies. I also added 1c unsweetened shredded coconut, 1t almond extract, a handful of sesame seeds, 1t ground coffee (which I add to all cookies and soups), and 1c chopped pecans...pretty much everything I could find in my pantry. Consistency was great and flavor was delicious. Thanks.
