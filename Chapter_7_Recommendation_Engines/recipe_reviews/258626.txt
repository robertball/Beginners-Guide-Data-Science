A simple, light salad.  I increased the recipe for a dinner party and at first used too little dressing, so the lime taste was lost.  After adding more of the dressing, it was delicious and became a recipe I would make again.

This was simple, straightforward, fresh, and tasty. I think the dressing could have used some herbs but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. This made a great main dish salad on a blistering hot summer evening. Thanks for sharing!
