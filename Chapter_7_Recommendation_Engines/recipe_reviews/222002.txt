Although I've been using allrecipes for over 10 years, I've never found a recipe that I've enjoyed so much that I would join just to rate it, until now! I am 50 plus years old and have been addicted to stuffed cabbage and peppers for most of my life. I have tried hundreds of different recipes. NONE have even come close to this one! My search for the perfect stuffed cabbage or pepper is over! I will never use another recipe. I'm actually getting ready at this very moment to use the filling minus the rice to make homemade ravioli. Thank You Chef John for such a PHENOMINAL RECIPE!

When I asked my boyfriend what types of things he likes to eat are,  after much prodding, the only thing he named was Stuffed Peppers, noting that his mother makes them often.  Later, he said "why don't we just go eat them at my moms?"  Clearly - mom had some good stuffed peppers.

Last night I took a stab at making Stuffed Peppers for the first time ever, for my boyfriend, and used this recipe.  I halved the recipe, and halved 2 large peppers and filled them that way, to make for easier leftover servings.  As I prepared them, my boyfriend stood over me, smirking... and said "your way is a little different."  I could see he was skeptical!!

Presentation wise, these peppers looked the part.  Beautiful.  We sat and ate, and for the first few minutes, didn't speak.  I was getting nervous... I don't think he likes them.  Half way through my plate, he quietly says "These aren't like my moms."  I said "sorry babe..." and before I could finish he exclaimed "THEY"RE BETTER!!!!  THEY ARE SO FREAKIN GOOD!"   And they were!!  As I sit here writing my first review, I'm eating the leftovers.  YUM!!

The only thing, and this may be because I eyeballed halving the recipe, is I wish I made more sauce.  It was delicious and we poured some on extra rice on the side, but there wasn't a lot left for the leftovers.  It was so delicious I'd want extra sauce to pour ridiculous amounts of!  YUM!!  May be different if you do the full recipe, or maybe worth doubling the sauce, or 1 and a half.

Best stuffed peppers I've ever had. I followed the recipe almost exactly - I didn't have beef broth so I just used water and it was still delicious. Thanks!

We made a double recipe of this, using 8 bell peppers (16 halves). The servings are very generous. I followed the recipe pretty well though I did use less of the cheese as I didn't feel like opening another bag. It got rave reviews from everyone. I loved it, my husband loved it, and the kids loved it. The green peppers and bright red sauce make for pretty contrast, and the savory flavor is wonderful. We had quite a lot left over and the leftovers taste just as good. I would highly recommend making a huge batch, and freezing some. It's cheaper and tastes better than the boxed frozen stuffed peppers.

Probably the best peppers I have EVER eaten! They were fantastic!
I did change it up just a bit because of what I had on hand. I had a 2 pound package of 93% fat free ground beef, so I skipped the sausage. To
mock a spicy sausage flavor, I added some fennel seed, pepper flakes and ground sage to the meat. I used brown rice instead of white rice. For the diced tomatoes I used rotel style tomatoes and drained them. I didn't have any parmesan cheese so what was I going to do? Light bulb moment... those pizza parmesan packets they give you when you order pizza! I have a ton of them so I added about 12 packets of that to the meat. I didn't add the cheese on top until the last 20 minutes and I ended up using mozzarella on top. Served it with some whole grain spaghetti that was tossed with onion, garlic and pepper. TOTALLY delish! I am SO full and I am fighting the urge to go munch on more... the sauce was great too!

I made half of the filling mixture for this recipe and it was plenty for three smallish green peppers (6 halves).  I prepared these early in the day, covered and refrigerated them.  I omitted the pork sausage and used fresh tomatoes.  The recipe is confusing because it instructs you to stir the rice and parmesan into the meat mixture.  Then later instructs you to sprinkle the remaining parmesan (what remaining parmesan?) over the top.  So not knowing how much to put where, I just winged it and used 2 T. in the meat mixture and sprinkled more on top after baking.  I baked these covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 more minutes and my peppers were still crisp tender.  I wouldn’t have wanted to bake them any longer.  This was good and the hint of balsamic vinegar was a nice addition.

I don't think I ever knew real stuffed pepper love until I met these.  Wow.  Other than using red bell peppers I didn't change a thing.  Confusion over when to add the cheese, in the mixture or as a topping, or 1/2 and 1/2.  I added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there.  It would've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a LOT of stuffing, so much I piled it as high as I could on each pepper.  Not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me, but I think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given.  Spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier.  If you think is good the first night, it's double WOW reheated the next day.

Yes I tire it, and it was a big disappointment!  After one bite, my wife wouldn't eat it and I ate some only because I spent 2 hours making it!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using red bell peppers instead of green peppers.

I thought this recipe was great.  My family was only so-so about it but they don't care for stuffed peppers at all.  The only complaint I have about the recipe is that made as is, you have way too much filling or not enough peppers.  I used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over.  I even over over stuffed mine and had extra.  I could have easily stuffed 3-4 more peppers with the filling.  I just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce.  Thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper!

These are truly the best stuffed peppers I have ever eaten!  I made them twice in one week because we couldn't get enough of them.

The BEST stuffed peppers I have ever eaten!  And I was really counting on it, because I used two large, beautiful bell peppers from my garden ... the biggest I grew this summer, and I wanted them to be memorable.  Chef John's recipe did not disappoint.  These were far better than the ones I remember my Mom making with tomato soup (that I never cared for).  These babies were the bomb.  I cut the recipe in half because I only had the two peppers, and just my husband and myself to feed.  The leftovers, taken on a camping trip and reheated, were awesome too.  Five Star Stuffed (homegrown) Peppers, eaten at a picnic table overlooking the McKenzie River ... beat that, gourmet restaurants!

Chef John does it again! I have never made stuffed peppers before, but now I am going to be making these frequently! This recipe is SO tasty! I used whole peppers with the top third cut off. Make sure you really pack the meat/rice mixture into the peppers. This makes it more solid and easier to eat. If you don't they will fall apart when you cut them open to eat. This recipe makes way more meat/rice mixture than you will need, so plan accordingly. UPDATE: You can easily make these healthier by substituting extra lean ground beef (I used 4% fat), turkey hot Italian sausage and brown rice. They still turn out yummy and added bonus: healthy!

These are delicious! The best stuffed peppers I've ever tasted and that's saying a lot. The sauce is really good and I don't normally like tomato sauces. You must try these. I didn't have the sausage on hand so I used all ground beef, but followed the recipe exactly. I'll be making these a lot from now on.

this was my favorite stuffed pepper recipe so far, even with substitutions.  I used 1.3lbs ground turkey instead of ground beef and omitted the sausage (because I didn't have time to defrost the sausage I had).  It was plenty of stuffing, though my peppers were pretty small.  Didn't use beef broth, instead added 3/4 cup of the juice I drained from the diced tomatoes.  

Peppers were cooked perfectly not too hard or soft.  Loved the tomato sauce mixture for dipping.  Next time I will try adding the sausage, I think that would take it to another level!  Also, 8 pepper halves do not fit in 1- 9x13, you'll need another small 8x8 to fit all your peppers in.

Wow, these were good!  I didn't have the hot Italian sausage on hand. What I did have was an 8oz package  of Bob Evans breakfast sausage.  I mixed that up with my ground beef and other ingridients.  I also used more than four peppers so I kept them whole instead of slicing them in half.  After they baked I topped them with Sharp Vermont white cheddar.  Sooo good.  This is the first time I didn't brown my meat before stuffing the peppers.  They turned out delicious!  Will make them again!

I use this recipe to stuff TONS of peppers and save them in the freezer, during harvest season. They are absolutely wonderful and I can't wait til a cold winter day when I don't wanna cook. The only thing I changed was a little more sausage! Great flavor.

Excellent. My Italian husband said it was the best stuffed peppers he has ever had! I did make some changes: I parboiled the peppers, omitted the sausage, and used leftover homemade marinara for the sauce. The only thing I would change for next time would be to cut the salt in half. One teaspoon is enough as it was slightly too salty. But I will definitely be making this again.

I served these to company and we all really liked this dish. I followed the recipe as closely as possible and it made just enough stuffing for 6 medium peppers. I had to substitute the cheese as I couldn't find Parmigiano-Reggiano so I used an Italian 5 cheese blend, and I used dried parsley. We had 2 peppers leftover and they were even better the next night.  I will definitely make them again, but next time I will boil the peppers first, only because we like them a little softer, and I'll make sure I have the right cheese and parsley on hand. I will also make them a day ahead and will use more cheese, again our preference. I will start looking for recipes by Chef John - this was great!

My first attempt at making stuffed peppers and I have to say they were some of the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I used red bell peppers and didn't have beef broth so substitued white wine. We ate them as left overs for several days and they microwaved just fine. I had a lot of stuffing left over so froze it and will have an easy weeknight recipe next time around.

Best stuffed peppers I've ever had; and my family agreed!  Used chorizo instead of italian sausage - very tasty!  But this recipe took alot longer to make than the directions stated.  My advice - mix what you can ahead of time!  If the meat were even mixed up the night before - it would "season" well and still be delicious.  This recipe also makes a ton of stuffing.  I had four very large bell peppers (don't just try green!) and we had them stuffed very full plus huge mounds leftover!  Yum yum yum!

Love this!  I cut the recipe in half, used whole grain brown rice (no one could tell) and tossed in a few diced mushrooms with the meat.  I tossed a few bread crumbs on top of the stuffed peppers with the cheese before baking.  Absolutely the best stuffed peppers I've ever had...

This is the best stuffed pepper recipe that I have ever had. If you follow the recipe exactly, which I did, it does make a lot of stuffing but I froze the stuffing and then thawed it at a later time when I had more peppers. (Great way to cut down on the time and effort when making them again.). When I made the sauce (before i cooked it with the peppers), I was a little concerned since it tasted different than the sauce I was used to having with stuffed peppers but, once the peppers were cooked with the sauce,WOW, was it good. The flavors blended nicely.  Leftovers were fantastic too. One note is that I did used red, yellow and orange bell peppers since that's what I had available but I did follow the recipe exactly for the stuffing and sauce. Thanks chef!

I made this last night and it was fantastic. I've never loved stuffed peppers because I find they can be very bland. These were spicy. Not like burn your mouth spicy but flavor enhancing spicy. Next time I make these I will add more spicy sausage. Other than that the only thing I changed was I added a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the sauce.

The time it took and multiple steps before even stuffing the peppers was way too long, a lot of work and the clean up with all the bowls, chopping boards, pots and pans was no party either. I was worried about the Cayenne and Pepper Flakes because of the kids so I went VERY easy on them. When they were done and I tasted a bite, I immediately had a rush of the heat in them. I would never serve to kids. I don't think you need either or the name needs to be changed to something like hot and spicy. If you are good at something you know just stick with it and don't try and get fancy. I learned my lesson and will make my usual next time. For me, nothing special about the taste of this recipe (other than the heat). Save your time and $$$ and stick to your own or one that is much more simple. Thank you for sharing and I'm sorry for being a downer but I read reviews and go by them as I'm sure others do as well. I just wanted to be honest.

Delicious. I'm not a stuffed pepper fan, but found some gorgeous yellow peppers at the farmer's market so came looking for a recipe. Other than yellow peppers and making 1 1/2 time the sauce (next time I'd do 2X)made exactly as written. I guess I'm a stuffed pepper fan now! Versatile recipe that will lend itself to all kinds of modifications to suit what you have on hand or your personal tastes. Thanks Chef John...(on the parmesan confusion in the recipe, I added 2 ounces to the meat mixture and then sprinkled another ounce or so on top of the individual peppers before putting in the oven.

These are so good, a teenager who has been giving me the silent treatment for weeks actually broke the silence to thank me.  I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I may do differently next time is use a bigger dish and double the sauce...the sauce is divine.  Wow.  Thanks Chef John, for another winner  :)

I made this as written, except I used quinoa instead of rice. It was delicious! It was just enough spice and the sauce is great! I also topped it with cheddar cheese. Mmmm

I used brown rice in the filling and cut the parmesan cheese in half. In the sauce, I cut the beef broth by a quarter cup and added a quarter cup of burgundy. I just happened to accidently forget both the balsamic and the cayenne. I did throw in a few spices to the sauce (Italian seasoning, basil, oregano and a little brown sugar). Before I baked them, I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar on top. These are the best stuffed peppers we've ever had. One of the previous reviewer's hit the nail on the head that the sauce is what makes this dish. That and the parmesan in the filling. We all loved this recipe, even my picky youngest child. THIS IS AMAZING. Totally making this again.

I followed this recipe exactly tonight and found it to be just okay. It was a bit of work to put together but stuffed peppers usually are.  However these just didn't seem to have much taste. I have other stuffed pepper recipes that are way better so I'll go back to tried and true.  I had to try this because most of Chef John's recipes have become my favorites.  Just not this one.

As written, this recipe is about 3 stars. First, this makes far too much filling for the 8 bell pepper halves being made.  I ended up only using half of the filling that this recipe made, so I put the remaining filling into a vacuum seal bag and froze it.  The filling otherwise tastes great.  My biggest issue is the cooking instructions.  Next time, I would absolutely cook the filling mixture first in a skillet.  Cooking bell peppers in the oven for 70 minutes renders them mushy.  Cooking the filling in the oven also meant all the grease from the meat dripped out into the already thin marinara sauce, leaving it water and greasy.Next time I will precook the filling in a skillet until almost done, then place the filling in the bell pepper halves and cook at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes uncovered. Instead of putting the marina mixture on the bottom of the pan, I will keep that separate and place on the peppers when they are served.

These are amazing!!!.. perfect combination of flavors. It makes a ton of filling so I used an extra green pepper and still had some left!  Only thing I added was a few cherry tomatoes chopped up and used a bag of mixed white cheeses. Incredible flavor!!! And save yourself time and use instant rice. Great great recipe!

This was very good. I used red, yellow and orange peppers.  I don't understand why all pepper recipes use green peppers; they can be bitter.

This recipe is soooo tasty!  I have made it two times now and I think I have nailed the perfect combination of ingredients (I made a couple modifications from the original).  

My changes

-I use Basmati rice, 2 cups cooked.  
-I throw the garlic in with the onions during their last minute of cooking, so it gets split between the sauce and meat mixture.
-I use tomato sauce, not marinara (which is what this recipe originally called for, anyway)
-I add 1 tsp of worcestershire sauce to the tomato sauce.
-For the meat I only use 1 lb of mild Italian sausage, no ground  beef.
-Because the sausage already has so much flavor, I cut the salt down to 1 tsp.
-I like to use sweet bell peppers; red, orange and yellow.  I find them much more flavorful than green.

Whether you try my changes or stick to the original,  I'm sure you can't go wrong.  Best stuffed peppers ever!

These are the best stuffed peppers I have ever made, and one of the best outcomes for trying a new recipe!!!  A little involved, as there are 3 steps to making--first the rice, next the sauce, and last, the actual stuffing mix.  Not to mention cleaning and cutting the peppers.  It consumed my counter space, so be prepared when you begin.  I made as written, EXCEPT I omitted red pepper flakes and cayenne, and used sweet sausage.  To get a hint of spiciness without the heat, I subbed Rotel MILD for the diced tomatoes.  I was so very tempted to put cilantro in place of the italian parsley, but held myself back!  That's a little 'twist' I'll make next time--perhaps halving the two.  And maybe subbing red wine for the Balsamic vinegar, so many possibilities!  We had leftover peppers tonight, and they were better than they were last night--the balsamic vinegar seems to have mellowed and melded better with time!  I'm freezing the rest, so imagine those will be very delicious, too.  I recommend this highly, and will be my 'go to' for potlucks, as well!

I'm kind of in the middle with this recipe. I just thought it was okay, but my husband really liked them and my kids, well 2 out of 4 ate theirs. I think that I like the Stuffed Green Peppers I better from this site, but I think that next time I will combine some aspects of this recipe, such as the sausage, ground beef, and parmesan with the other stated recipe. I was expecting the sauce to be amazing due to reviews, but really I like using the tomato soup better and it is less work.

This is a fantastic stuffed pepper recipe...it was a hit with my hubby, my 12 year old, my 3 year old, and my 1 year old! I wasn't too spicy, but had a kick of flavor other bell pepper recipes tend to miss. I didn't have fresh Italian parsley so subbed fresh basil. Can't wait until tomorrow night's dinner....leftovers! :)

Very easy and as alway's Chef John has not failed me yet!....I made some minor adjustments, due to not having some items (I used fresh tomato instead of canned, I used wild rice, I was forced to use garlic powder, I will use fresh next time) even with my minor changes, this was a hit with my family, I am already looking forward to left overs tomorrow!

I must say...excellent! I have never rated a recipe on this site but I just had to for this one! The only changes I made was substituting the ground beef for ground turkey, threw in a little bit more red pepper and used whole peppers standing upright. Great combination of flavors and spices! Thanks so much for a great recipe!! Definitely a keeper!

I've been using allrecipes for at least 3 years and am finally joining to tell you that this is a great recipe. I made about 1.5 recipes worth of filling and used 9 peppers (stuffed 18 halves). I made two pans and intended to freeze one, but my family of five ate almost all of both pans. 

I accidentally mixed the cheese in with the filling instead of putting it on top, but this was still really good.

These were the best stuffed peppers I have ever had.  So often, stuffed peppers have no flavor, but not these! I used ground chicken and sausage and they were great.  I will be making these many times over. Delish!

I'd love to review the recipe, but as usual with so many recipes on this site, the cooking time was drastically off, and the peppers came out of the oven after 45 minutes with completely red, raw meat inside. So they're currently back in the oven for who knows how long until the filling is actually cooked...while my family patiently waits to eat. Do people ever actually test these recipes for accuracy?

First time trying these they were very good and easy to make without the high cost. Topped with feta for me and fried egg for the boyfriend. I would make these again.

I made this tonight for my family and all I can say is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out awesome. The marinara sauce is a must. I served these on a bed of rice, drizzled sauce on rice and placed peppers on top. This combination of flavors sent our taste buds into over drive. Thank you for a world class reciepe, and this will be in the family forever. I rate this at 10 stars. Thanks chef John.

Definitely 5 star worthy. It's the best recipe that I have found on this site. The sauce was awsome. I used 8 peppers instead of 4, cut the tops off and removed the seeds. It was perfect for the amount of peppers for the filling. The filling would not have fit in 4 peppers cut in half. 
The wife loved it too! Will definitely make again.

My family loves this recipe.  I use tomato sauce instead of marinara, I use a pound of sausage for 1.5-2 pounds of beef and I double the sauce recipe. I usually buy 6 large peppers to make 12 peppers and then I use any leftover filling to make a small loaf in another pan (also put sauce in the pan.)
I cook a little longer than it says to make the peppers softer and I also add mozzarella cheese the last 20 minutes, to give it a nice topping.
I use large peppers and it is a meal in itself, serve with a salad.  For the holidays I am going to try to make the recipe with smaller peppers to make appetizers.

I've made the earlier version of Chef John's Stuffed Peppers and prefer that recipe to this one. My family and I just didn't care for it. The texture is great, but the whole thing just didn't seem to go well together. The initial red sauce was wonderful, the peppers just the right doneness, the interior a bit bland, but the flavors seemed at war with each other in mouth.

 I will admit I didn't have the hot Italian sausage, maybe that's the lynch pin to this one.

This recipe is great and I made it exactly as written. The sauce is really good- the balsamic giving it a nice touch. When I make this again, like other reviewers, I may double the sauce.  These freeze and bake later beautifully.

Made it exactly as described.  Not my first attempt at stuffed peppers, by any means, but one of the more involved recipes, and a long cooking time.  Liked the ratio of meat to rice, and the texture of the stuffing, but 3 sources of hot spice (cayenne, red pepper flakes and hot Italian sausage a little too much for the green peppers, and the flavor of them.  Might try this one more time with sweet Italian sausage and see what happens...or just maybe move on to another recipe.

After reading the reviews, I was extremely excited to make the best stuffed peppers ever. No such luck. I was pretty disappointed as was my family- these were just average. I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy. The tomato sauce WAS bread-dipping worthy, other than that, certainly nothing to write home about. My search for a great stuffed pepper recipe continues.

I used organic short-grain brown rice made in my rice cooker in beef broth.  Other than that, I followed the directions/ingredient list exactly.  This recipe will be in my top 10 rotation.  It is soooo good - a little kick from the hot sausage and spices puts it over the top.  I'm so glad I picked this recipe for my first time ever making stuffed peppers.  FYI - the recipes doesn't say to drain the diced tomatoes, but I did (it just seemed like the right thing to do).

Really delicious! I used Mild Rotels for the tomatoes (will use original next time). The sauce is good but next time, I will add garlic for more flavor. I used Texmati rice (cooked according to package, not this recipe) because it has an excellent flavor. One other helpful note: This recipe yields enough filling for 6 full peppers or 12 halves. Divine aroma while baking, too!

I have yet to find a "Chef John" recipe that isn't bland and very dry. I think this is the last one I'm making. His recipes lack so much flavor. Sorry but I don't recommend this recipe.

OMG!!   These were the best stuffed peppers I ever had.  Loved the flavors and that little bit of heat.  I am going to use the same filling and sauce for stuffed cabbage the next time I make it.

I came across this recipe and it immediately brought to mind the stuffed peppers my grandma used to make for the family.  I hadn’t had them in so long and immediately started thinking what night I could serve these to my husband and son as they hadn’t had them before.   As I set the dish on the dining table, I thought “what a beautiful dish with the green pepper layered on the tomato sauce base, they are almost too pretty to eat”, but eat them we did and they were delicious….  No alterations needed!  Thanks Chef John for reawakening a childhood favorite!

It's a good recipe. My only comment is "waaah?" Where did Chef John get the idea that this recipe is from the U.S. during the depression?  It's an Eastern European staple that's at least 200 years old!

My husband was always asking me for stuffed peppers.  I put it off for 6 years because I personally do NOT like stuffed peppers.  His family recipe was ground beef, rice, and tomato sauce in green peppers--no thank you.  I decided to try this recipe because the ingredients were much more in line with my style of cooking (Italian-American, here!) and it didn't disappoint!  The only thing I do differently is I add a little lemon zest and a pinch of ground allspice to the meat mixture.  So good.  Even my two girls eat these up.

This was phenomenal! It has been the best stuffed pepper dish that I have ever had! It had a nice sweet flavor combined with the just the right balance of heat from the red chili pepper and the cayenne pepper. Not too much, just enough to enhance the complexity of the rich flavors. I will definitely be making this again... Often.

I made this because my husband always likes stuffed peppers. Had a couple of questions while following this recipe. It does not say to cook the beef and sausage before adding to the rice mixture but I did. Also I just cut the tops off of 7 large green bell peppers and stuffed all of them. I will use less sausage next time and no red pepper flakes because it was a little bit spicy. Other than that it was a tasty dish!

I never made stuffed peppers before but the reviews sounded so great, I decided to give them a try. I'm Sooo glad I did!  These may be my new favorite dish!! I only made a couple changes. I used Johnsonville mild brats in place of hot Italian (didn't want them too spicy for my young kids). I used all 5 brats in the pack. I also added half the canned tomatoes and cut up small pack of variety colored cherry tomatoes I had. I used minute rice also- Anything to save time:) Couldn't find the cheese that was called for so I did a 5 cheese Italian mix. Added half to meat mixture and rest on top. you will have A LOT of filling left. I ended up using more peppers (5 green peppers halved to make 10). I also used  balsamic pomegranate vingear (couldn't find plain one) and I think it only added to the wonderful flavors. Next time I'll try yellow or red peppers too! I will be making this often! ! My Hubby and 2 young kids loved these as well!! Great recipe!!!!!

Amazing!!!! Taste was perfect. The only thing I changed was that I did not halve my peppers. I like them tranditionally fully stuffed like a bowl! I also added some more spices... It was originally a bit bland for my taste but maybe thats just me.

These were good. I would have preferred that the peppers got a little softer, so if I make again will parboil the peppers prior to stuffing them.

We thought this recipe was okay, but not exceptional. I made the recipe as written, except I used mild Italian sausage instead of hot Italian sausage because that's all the store had. Perhaps it's just as well because I thought the dish was a bit too spicy. The flavors were harsh and didn't seem to blend well. Perhaps it was the balsamic vinegar, pepper flakes and cayenne together or the chopped tomatoes, but the dish seemed very acidic.

These are excellent, the basalmic adds a taste that is unlike anything else! I doctored up my tomato sauce with mushrooms and used Quinoa instead of rice. I used Venison and these were the best stuffed peppers I've ever had

BEST STUFFED PEPPERS MY HUSBAND AND I EVER HAD.  Just add less salt than the recipe calls for.

Went exactly like recipe, except I used grounded Turkey.  But these were better than family recipe and just enough kick but not overpowering. Nothing but props for this recipe will be using it again

Really good. I followed the recipe to a tee except I added mozzarella to the top at the end (if you can see my picture, yay!) I think the italian sausage adds something special to the filling, which is basically like a meat loaf. Next time I think I will add even more italian sausage and cut down on the ground beef. This recipe makes enough filling to overstuff the peppers, it makes pretty generous portions.
After stuffing the peppers I had one scoop of filling left over and I made a patty and fried it. That practically knocked my socks off, it was SO GOOD! The stuffed peppers were really good too but not as good lol, so I may even try to modify this recipe and make fried patties. YUM! The braising liquid is very delicious and next time I will try making more of it.

These are the best Stuffed Peppers I've ever had!  I made it almost exactly like the recipe except I added a diced, seeded jalapeño pepper into the meat mixture.  It gave it an extra little kick!  Just like all the other reviewers, I have to say, that sauce is so good!  The last bite was just as good as the first and the only reason I stopped eating them was because I was too full to continue eating!  This recipe is going into the recipe box, it is definitely a keeper...Thanks Chef John!!!

These were the best stuffed peppers EVER! I doubled the sauce, as per earlier reviews. I used brown rice and also turkey Italian sausage. Gave some to a neighbor and she loved them too! Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

made these tonight and they are great! I did add mushrooms and saute'd them with the onion but thats the only thing I added. And I used 4 LARGE green peppers, NOT halved, used the whole pepper. It does make a whole lot of meat mixture, the extra I put in the freezer. Will make again for sure! I like that the meat and spice flavors were not covered by a 'ketchup' flavor.

My initial review is "just ok" but I need to try again to make sure. I prepared these as directed, but I froze them right after baking to use as lunches, so I didn't eat any fresh. When thawed, they were fine but bland and needed lots of salt and spaghetti sauce to give flavor. I have to try again to see of this was due to the freezing or the recipe. I do know that there wasn't enough sauce or cheese for my preference, so I will double the tomato sauce and add some extra cheese to the topping, probably mozzarella.

Good but kind of bland; needs garlic.  My husband is taking the left overs for lunch tomorrow; he asked me to sprinkle cheddar on top so when he microwaves it it well melt over it.  That might make it less bland.

WOW!  I just made these for dinner, and I can't believe how good they are!  I didn't have the hot italian sausage, so I used sweet italian sausage...everything else was exactly the same.  My husband can't wait to have some leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This was a great recipe!  I had a pound of Italian sausage and 3/4 pound of ground beef so used all of that and it made enough for 5 people with leftovers.  Had to make more of the sauce and used 3 more peppers to use up all the filling.

Delicious!  I used all ground beef because I had a package that was already 1 1/4 lbs.  It got rave reviews even from my cousins that were in the restaurant business.  They said, “best stuffed peppers I’ve ever had!”  Coming from them, that was quite a compliment.

I thawed some ground beef to make this and learned I have a distaste for frozen ground beef. I don’t like the smell of it cooking. Consequently, I ruined what would have been a fun to build and very tasty supper. I may be weird but I’m only using fresh ground beef from now on. I learned the hard way by learning to cook since my wife passed away.

These came out great.  The only thing I added was paprika, because thats how I've always made stuffed.  I KNOW, I'm not rating the recipe as is, but it is great.  The family loved them.  It was a nice economical addition to our rotation.  Will be making it again (with paprika) lol.

This was delicious and great for freezing later. I did make some changes. First off I browned the meat because I wasn’t assembling all at once, and I thought raw meat was asking for trouble. I used fresh tomatoes, 1lb chopped instead of canned, because my garden overfloweth! I added about a teaspoon of sriracha sauce to the mix, and for cheese topping a blend of parm and cheddar (just parm in mixture. It made a ton so luckily I had extra peppers. But they were as good as my Moms.

I found this recipe and thought it sounded great, but no way did I have the time to spend 2 hours waiting to feed the kids. So, I cooked the meat with the ingredients listed to mix with it and I cooked the rice before mixing it in with the meat mixture. I also boiled the peppers. I reduced the liquid called for in the marinara mix, probably nix the balsamic altogether next round. Kicked the oven up to 450°, baked for 8 minutes then sprinkled with the cheese and baked another 2. Was delish!

This was completely revolting and I'm usually a big fan of Chef John. I'm not sure what it was, but that combination of meats, spices, and broth shoved into peppers smelled awful and tasted worse.

The video doesn't match the recipe. The reviews are so good I am going to try it anyway but I just wonder why chef John changed it.

First I must say I do not care for stuffed peppers but my husband does and after 20 years of marriage I figured I should give it a go.  I made the recipe as written and I too must say it makes a huge amount of filling.  I was able to fill 6 large peppers.  I didn't find the recipe difficult or time consuming.  I would suggest reading through the recipe before you start, do all the prep and then you can just breeze through the process.    I still don't care for stuffed peppers but I did like the subtle amount of heat this recipe provides.   My husband liked it and said, "stuffed peppers are always even better left over."   My two teens tried them and didn't care for them but I think its just because I don't make a lot of this type of thing so its not in their pallet.   I gave the extras (after saving one jumbo for hubby) to my elderly parents to provide a meal for them and I know they will like them.   So, I would say it you like stuffed peppers, you will like these and if you've never made them before it's not difficult at all.

Very good, possibly the best stuffed pepper recipe ever. I'm from Pittsburgh where everyone got there own recipe for this dish, but by far this one is my best. Don't leave out the  balsamic vinegar, adds a nice touch. Husband loved it!!

Delish!!!  I made a triple batch for my family reunion.  I made 2/3 of it into cabbage rolls and the last third into stuffed peppers. We ate some of the peppers for dinner last night.  Very flavorful. 
 This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've tried several stuffed pepper recipes and this one tops them all.  The sauce is so flavorful with just a tiny kick.  My hubby loved it too and printed it out for "our" recipe book.  It's definitely a keeper!  Thank Chef John!

The best stuffed peppers I've ever had! Delicious, and very flavorful, but not overpoweringly so, so people with a range of palates should be able to enjoy them (I know that was true in our house). Easy to make, and since I'm cooking for two, plenty of delicious leftovers! I made the recipe exactly as written, except for using red peppers (my preference).  The peppers themselves came out perfectly cooked (soft, but not disintegrating), the filling was superb, and very well complemented by the simple sauce. This recipe is now part of our regular rotation.

Made the recipe following all the directions with no changes. Came out DELICIOUS! I have never made stuffed bell  peppers before. It took a long time to prepare and cook but so worth It! This is the only dish I will eat that includes rice in it. Video and instructions are very easy to follow

Well this is a fabulous recipe, unfortunately I didn't read the instructions throughly and placed uncooked rice in the peppers. I decided to write a review for anyone out there who made this same mistake. I don't want to throw it out so I decided to make soup, this cooked the rice and well it was excellent! Lol :)

Yummy! Made as directed with the exception of cayenne pepper. I didn't have any on hand so I used chili powder. This was a hit with my hubby and three year old. My first time having stuffed peppers and won't be my last. This recipe made a lot of extra filling. I reserved the sauce after removing the peppers and plan on using it on some pasta for my preschoolers lunch as the sauce was very flavourful.

This was delicious and easy to make, but took me an hour to prepare.  I bought the biggest green peppers I could find, so ended up having to use two baking dishes instead of one.  Next time, I won't buy such large peppers.  I like the little bit of heat in this recipe, but would stay away from the red pepper, cayenne, and hot Italian sausage if you are sensitive to even a little bit of heat.

Love, love, LOVE! I'm fairly new to cooking but no one would know that with this recipe.  I do blanch my peppers first because I like them to melt in your mouth and they come out perfect every time! I make them at least once a month and I get rave reviews every time.

Delicious and relatively easy to put together! I made these the day before and refrigerated them until about 30 minutes before I was ready to bake them the next day, which worked out fine. We like our peppers pretty soft, so I always clean and cut the peppers into halves beforehand and freeze them that way when they thaw and bake they are the perfect softness for us. The family really loved these and I will def be making them again~YUM! Thanks, Chef John, for another winner! :)

The meat was completely red and raw. My family couldn't eat it. They said that this was a huge disappointment. It took them 2 hours to finish this. I was really disappointed when they came out. For some reason, the pepper EXPLODED in my oven. The sauce was just water in my mouth and it had no flavor. The Parmesan was overpowering the peppers. But what I'm most angry at is the exploding pepper. Will not try this recipe again. This is one of the most horrible foods a I have ever tasted. I will continue to try more of your recipes, see how they turn out.

SO GOOD! These are a house favorite. I use Jimmy Dean mild or regular ground breakfast sausage instead and these turn out excellent every single time. Other than that minor difference, I follow the recipe exactly. I'll forever suggest this recipe.

This is one of the best recipes I've come across in a long time. I changed it for a no carb option and switched the rice for riced cauliflower.  I put cauliflower in food processor till it was consistency of rice and sautéed with the onions. Probably used about 3c. of riced cauliflower for recipe. Turned out perfect.

Oh my!  Absolutely delicious!  I haven't made stuffed peppers in years, but plan on making this again next week. The only thing I had to change was that I used chicken broth because I didn't have beef broth.  I used all spices/ingredients in the suggested amounts.   This recipe filled 7 upright peppers.  (Plan on increasing recipe to fill 9x13 dish with 10 or 11 peppers.)  I was so surprised by how delicious the sauce is also.  This dish is so good that I would make this for guests in a heartbeat.  Thank you, Chef John!

CHEF JOHN! 
OMG, these were unbelievable! 
No hesitation in awarding this recipe 5 stars! 

I made a few adjustments for personal taste, but stuck pretty closely to your original recipe. 

- I omitted the pork sausage, as I wanted the beef flavor to shine. 

- I cooked the rice in beef broth for added flavor. 

These are hands-down the best stuffed peppers I've ever had, and I live in a huge metropolitan area with TONS of eastern European influence! 

KUDOS! This is world-class!

This was really good!  I used brown rice and ground turkey.  Baked them in a dutch oven instead of using baking dish and foil.  Less clean too as I sauted the onions and prepared the marinara in the dutch oven on the stove top.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very impressive ChefJohn, as are all other recipes, by you, that I have tried.  The first time I made this I had no sausage meat so used only ground beef, I thought it was excellent, as did my DH.  The next time I did use sausage meat too & wow,  it was actually even better. The balsamic vinegar is the kicker, do not omit it.  It is a big recipe so I have been sable to share with friends as there are just two of us, everyone now thinks I am just the best cook ever! :D

I made this the other night and it was a winner for sure! I made a few changes along the way- i used pork chipolatas and I made my own marinara sauce also I used a few red peppers along with green because my partner does not like green ones. The sauce needs to be doubled it is so amazing! (my housemates dipped their bread in the remaining sauce that was leftover in the pan haha) I used 7 average sized peppers and the sauce was stretched a little further than I would want. I also did not have aluminum foil so I made the first batch uncovered and I actually preferred them like this because the cheese became a little golden brown and added some nice texture. The second time we made them as directed and certainly preferred the cheese a little more cooked. all in all great recipe I will make again with DOUBLE sauce next time!

OMG were these good.  I used Del Grosso brand marinara sauce (called "Sunday Gravy").  I made these quickly and forgot to add the canned tomatoes.  Also, forgot to buy Parm-Regg cheese so I used just a basic powder parm cheese I had on hand.  Even with these changes the recipe was still fantastic.  My rice never turns out good when made as stated in this recipe.  I add 1.75 c HOT water or chix broth to rice, cook covered on low (or highest simmer setting) for 18 min. Remove from heat, and let rest covered for an add'l 5 min.  Turns out perfect.

Outstanding ! The best stuffed pepper meal I have ever had. I did change the recipe with one item. We used a half pound of ground beef and a half pound of ground venison and it produced less fat because of the lean venison and a very flavorful filling with out any gaminess traces. Instead of mixing the filling mixture by hand we used or Kitchen-aid mixer with the mixing paddle attachment to get a thoroughly blended filling. I expect the ones we froze will taste just as good as the just out of the oven ones.

Fantastic stuffed peppers. I was looking for a good recipe for these as the couple I tried out fell short. I got some lovely large green bells and the stuffing mixture and sauce was just perfect. Didn't change a thing. Thank you Chef John!

This recipe was very easy to make, although I did not have the sausage, I imagine it would bring more depth of flavor. I had 4 large yellow peppers and after stuffing had a lot of mixture leftover. I would think a half cup of uncooked rice would do. But it was fine. I just put the rest of the mixture in the pan with the sauce and the pepper tops. I was also weary of mixing everything with the raw meat- and if I do this again, I may cook the meat just to see how it changes the flavor- with some browned bits, it may be different. I would think you could add anything to this like diced mushrooms or carrots or zucchini or beans. My husband liked it, my one daughter ate the mixture (not the pepper), the other daughter that loves yellow peppers wouldn't touch it (she's only 4 so that explains that) and I enjoyed it, yet felt like it needed something- just not sure what.

Chef John...thank you for this recipe! My girlfriend who is not a big green pepper fan really enjoyed it. It was even better the next night. I used the Lundbergs Wild Blend instead of white rice and I thought it added good texture to the filling. Awesome!

This recipe will make your taste buds sing. I followed the recipe except I used rotel. It is such a great recipe it didn't need any changes. I did make it once without the hot pork sausage...it was bland, you need the hot pork. I have one child who doesn't eat bell peppers, I just use a single serve cassarole dish with a little sauce on the bottom and the filling on top cooked like the peppers. We fight over the leftovers.

These were really good. Yes, it makes way too much filling. And I tried to halve it, which never works out for me. I didn't
use sausage, personal taste, just all ground beef.

Loved it!!  Very flavorful, even better the second day. I used quinoa instead of rice for more nutrition and it worked fine (I make quinoa in the rice cooker, same settings as white rice, as I prepare the other ingredients to save time). I used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles which enriched the flavor and fresh grated Parmesan cheese as well as fresh garlic (instead of the canned kinds) and it was well worth the extra effort :) Quality ingredients = superb flavor. My dad, boyfriend and brother loved it!!  5 stars!

I was a little reluctant when while preparing and realized that the Hamburg goes in raw. I read it through a few times to make sure I didn't miss anything! These by far, are the best stuffed peppers I've ever made!!!! Thanks Chef John

As so many before me have noted, these are the best stuffed peppers ever!  I had planned to make stuffed peppers for dinner, but couldn't find my recipe.   Thank goodness I lost it and found this one!!  I modified the recipe out of necessity, as I did not have time to go to the grocery to get the extra ingredients "my new favorite recipe" called for.  I did not have pepper flakes or parsley,  and I did not use  substitutIons.  I prefer lean meats, so I used ground venison in place of the ground beef.  Instead of the sausage, I added another half cup of rice.  I added a tablespoon of olive oil to the meat mixture for added fat.  The tomato sauce was superb and there was plenty to pour over the peppers at serving time.  As the recipe didn't state how to divide the parmesan cheese, I put 2/3 of a cup in the stuffing mixture and 1/3 on the top of the peppers.  I thought the amount of stuffing was perfect for my 4 average to large sized peppers, which I cut in half length wise.   Really push the stuffing in and you'll have them just  nicely heaped.

This was absolutely delicious. After reading the reviews, I made sure to have extra peppers on hand in case I had extra stuffing. I doubled the recipe because we were having a huge family gathering. I had enough to fill 16 large peppers. I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved them. The sauce was absolutely incredible too. I've never been disappointed with any of Chef John's recipes and these stuffed peppers were a big hit with my entire family, even the kids. It's now considered one of my favorites to bring to gatherings as well as a monthly meal in my home.

I've made this recipe three times to the absolute delight of my entire family. Each time, I've not had the ground beef and sausage available so have substituted Meatless Ground and vegetable broth (tasty vegetarian meal!), mild pork sausage, and leftover surf & turf (steak and prawns). I always omit the cayenne and red pepper flakes for a family member who doesn't appreciate spicy and there is still plenty of flavor. That I can substitute the main protein each time while consistently getting rave reviews is a testament to how good this recipe is. Thanks Chef John!

I have never really tried stuffed peppers until today. This was filling and delicious. If you want to speed up the process some prepare all the stuff earlier than when you want to cook it.  I also had to cook the meat and sausage before using it to fill. It may or may not have lost some flavor though, but either way it was great. I actually decided to make this after my husband asked for some homemade stuffed peppers. He was more than satisfied and those that ate it loved it. (My kids are super picky about spices) this came out perfect either way, and there is still some filling left over even after I over stuffed the peppers. However, this may be due to a bit more meat than a pound and the 1/4 lb of sausage (I'm not sure how much i actually used on both but i am sure it was over the amount called for). This will become a regular in my house but now i know what to do better. Awesome recipie, thank you.

A+!
I have made this recipe a few times, and each time my family sings its praises! Very moist! A little spicy but that's great for us.  (You can easily decrease the spice by omitting the chili pepper flakes or using mild or medium sausage).
The only change I made was sautéing the garlic with the onions.

I had left over filling so I fried it until well done/crispy...Yummy!
A definite keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  Didn't have red pepper flakes on hand so I used a little extra cayenne.   I love garlic and onions so I used more onions and garlic and sauteed some garlic with the onions.  Oh, and I parboiled the peppers although I feel like that may not be necessary.   Topped with muenster cheese.  Don't skip the sausage as some reviewers have, it really adds important taste.  Only thing I will change is next time I will use less beef and add veggies like okra and corn (personal preference).   I was skeptical about the sauce, but it is perfect.  Can't praise this recipe enough!

I have made this recipe several times; it is EXCELLENT!  I usually don't have Italian pork sausage or marinara sauce on hand, so I just use all ground beef and salsa.  This recipe easily makes enough to stuff six to eight bell pepper halves.  After cooking, I freeze what I don't plan to eat right away.  They freeze wonderfully; thank you, Chef John!

I will definitely make this again and hopefully give this 5 stars! I made changes that probably effected the overall outcome. I used red peppers instead of green (a change we liked), but used mild Italian sausage instead of hot, wish we had stuck with the hot, even though I added fennel seed and sage I felt like it lost some of the flavor. I doubled the sauce based on other reviews and had way too much left over. Personally, I will cut back slightly on the balsamic vinegar next time, but can't wait to try this again. That is the fun part of cooking, try & change as you go to make the recipe perfect.

The recipe went together very easily and tasted fantastic! I used long grain rice and quinoa cooked in beef broth, vermont sharp white cheddar and dry parmesan, half beef half turkey, rosemary and green onion instead of parsley, and garlic diced tomatoes.  Most of the changes were to adapt what I had on hand and probably were not needed. I did spoon the tomato gravy on top a couple times throughout the cooking process too. I may make it a little spicier next time with another pinch or two of cayenne or try diced tomatoes with chillis. Yum!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  While it was my first time preparing stuffed peppers with raw meat,  I liked how they turned out and preferred the taste of the peppers with the longer cook time and flavorful sauce base. I used a cup of cooked quinoa in place of the rice but aside from this made no substitutions. 

I will definitely prepared stuffed peppers using this method next time. 

While I agree it was difficult to understand how the cheese was to be divided,  next time I would probably use half in the mixture and half atop the peppers. I might even add more to the top!

Amazing! By far, the best stuffed peppers I've ever had. I use ground turkey in place of the beef. I also cook the turkey and sausage before stuffing into the peppers. It cuts down on the baking time and allows me to cook them just until the peppers are perfectly cooked to my liking. ( I like a tiny bit of crunch left in the peppers). I usually use brown rice that I have boiled in reduced sodium chicken broth and it adds a nice flavor. This recipe is more time consuming than any other stuffed pepper recipe I have tried but I promise, it is worth every minute spent in the kitchen!

I was hesitant of this recipe because it seemed weird to me to put the meat raw into the peppers. The overwhelmingly high ratings persuaded me and they were delicious. Next time though, I will boil the peppers for a few minutes before stuffing them to soften them up. Don't forget to pour the sauce from the pan over the peppers before serving like I did until I realized they seemed kind of dry without it.

I had a lot of fun making this. I followed the instructions pretty closely but made done adjustments. 
-i used white cheddar instead of parmesean... Just wanted to make use of what i already had on hand. Cut it into tiny blocks.

- instead of red pepper flakes i used sriracha sauce. Same reason as above. I didn'texactly measure but it was close to 2 tbsp

-i used a whole jar of marinara. I felt like the recipe needsmore moisture to keep the peppers from drying.

-lastly i rotated the dish. halfway through...alll ovens have hot spots. I also "basted" the peppers frequently Sitting the last third of cooking with the tomato sriracha mixture in the pan.


All in all i was happily surprised. Thanks john!

I lost my old recipe my mother used from an Old Betty Crocker cookbook.  I decided to try this, I'm so glad I did.  I didn't use the pork sausage because my husband doesn't care for it and I used Colby Jack cheese because that's what I had.  It's so delicious.   The best stuffed peppers I've ever eaten. I'm eating leftovers for lunch now!

I just found this recipe 2 days ago, made no changes, and  hubby loved them as did I.  Served with mashed potatoes and Chef John's gravy that has cognac in it.   WOW!!!  My hubby is still raving about both.  A side salad topped off the dinner.  I followed his video...very helpful!

I followed the recipe with no alterations and it came out delicious!  My boys, 8 & 12, asked for a second half which is remarkable.  The combination of flavors are well balanced and the little extra cheese on top really launches your taste buds into overdrive.  A simple dish done right, will be making this again soon.  Just make sure your pan is deep enough as I almost had some spill over.

Delicious. Made it with no changes, other than salt added to sauce. Very good! I made extra sauce and poured that over egg noodles.

This is definately a "make again" at our house. I used sweet italian sausage as I am not a "hot food person"  still an  
awesome recipe.  I might try using1/2 hot sausage next time. The balsamic vinegar adds a little unusual taste to the 
sauce that we really liked.

This recipe was amazing. I added about a quarter cup of ground parmasan cheese to the meat and also about a quarter cup of the tomato sauce mixture to the meat as well.

Loved them! I brought it to friends'home and my friend said "My mother taught me how to make stuffed peppers when I was moving away from home. It was one of her signature dishes and I thought the best peppers in the world. These are way superior! May I have the recipe?" 
I did not follow the recipe exactly but would guess they are delicious the way written. Here are the changes I made. I used only sausage because that's all I had, I used brown rice instead of white (Trader Joe's has a quicker cooking brown rice which I love), and I added cooked chard because had some in the refrigerator. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used Italian seasoning and finally, I used red peppers instead of green because I like a milder taste. They were a 5 star and I will be making them again.

Amazing!!! Loved this recipe. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of ground beef & pork sausage, added extra red peppers and a little more cayenne since I wasn't using hot sausage. Also I used quinoa instead of rice. Oh and dried parsley instead of fresh. Even with all that, this dish is a winner. It had so much flavor!!

Wow, this recipe was amazing! I love stuffed peppers, but my husband doesn't like them. This recipe had so many good reviews that I thought I would give stuffed peppers one more try for him. He loved this recipe! The supermarket didn't have organic ground beef, so I substituted ground turkey for the beef. The peppers were still delicious, and now I'm curious to try the recipe with beef next time.

Another 5-star from Chef John! I do use two modifications that I think really push it over the top. The first is using large poblano peppers  that I've roasted and skinned on my outdoor grill. It really give it a nice flavor (I saw someone do it on Guy's Grocery Games). The other is I mostly cook my ground beef and Italian sausage before I mix them with the other stuffing ingredients. It keeps the grease down substantially. Otherwise, this is a go-to!

Very good.  I made these with a whole pepper, and made into a pumpkin face since it's the week before Halloween.  Very good pepper filling.

I added shredded cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. Very tasty.  I served it on a bed of brown Jasmine rice instead of putting it in the bell pepper.

With a few adjustments these came out delicious!! First, I omitted spicy sausage and used regular because I have a picky 4 year old and I thought that the cayenne and the red pepper flakes would provide enough kick (and they did). Second, I omitted the crushed tomatoes altogether and just poured some of the sauce over the peppers before baking. Finally, I did not use beef broth, I rinsed out the tomato sauce can with some water and poured it into the skillet instead. Served with mashed potatoes, with the sauce poured over them. These were the best stuffed peppers I've ever made/had. My husband had two helpings and leftovers tasted just as good the next day.

I tried this but I also added a small diced eggplant sauteed in E. virgin olive oil.  I had my meat sauce already made from using leftover sauce from meatballs. I sliced the sausage thin while partially frozen, it was easier to fry.  This is a good recipe. Family wanted more!!!!

So fast to put together. I loved the flavors. We really like the tomato sauce that the peppers cooked in and I think I will double that the next time. I did change a couple of things. I used mild italian sausage instead of hot, so that my kids would eat it. I also forgot to put the diced tomatoes in the meat mix, but didn't miss it too much because of the yummy sauce. This recipe is a keeper!

This is hands down the best stuffed pepper recipe! I followed the measurements exact for the most part, however I did add more of the black & cayenne pepper, salt & hot red pepper flakes. DE-LIC-OUS!!!  I also added stuffed tomatoes & red & orange peppers for a more colorful & fun dinner. Prior to baking everything, I topped the stuffed veggies with olive oil & a garnish of Parmesan. OUT-STANDING turnout!!!

Wonderful recipe! I did use instant white rice instead of long grain white, used my home canned tomatoes for the diced and a three cheese blend that included Asiago.  I made a 2 serving portion size and filled 2 green peppers and 1 red pepper.  So good and pretty too.  DH wants this again soon.

Made these true to the recipe with the exception of using mild Italian sausage instead of the hot because I was a little leary of the spice factor. Next time I will use the hot as the recipe called for. It was excellent and I plan on making it again soon ;0)

I didnt have any sausage handy so I just used extra ground beef and it was very bland.  I scooped out the meat and added 1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp pork seasoning and 1/2 tbsp italian seasoning, which made a huge difference.  

Next time I'll leave the rice a lot firmer before I add it to the meat since it continues to cook when the peppers are in the oven and turns mushy.

I'm afraid I have to be redundant and say "Best stuffed peppers I've ever had!" My husband, after every bite, said "Wow, these are fantastic!" or "I am lucky to have a wife who can cook like this!"
  I didn't put in cayenne pepper because I don't like it. Also, I didn't have any sausage on hand so I diced 2 pieces of bacon and used that instead.  And I used orange bell peppers instead of green because they're not bitter.
  Right now I'm visiting my daughter and her husband and I'm planning to make these tomorrow for a grand Sunday Dinner.  Try this recipe; you'll be so glad you did!

I've never been a huge fan of stuffed peppers...but I'm a fan of Chef John and I came across this recipe and happened to have a ton of peppers I needed to use ...so I gave it a try. THESE ARE AMAZING.  This is by far the best stuffed pepper recipe I have ever used and it produces the best stuffed peppers you'll ever taste.

I am torn here & not really sure how to rate this. I have tried several of Chef John's recipes and have always been impressed. Until now. I am giving serious consideration to fixing this again to try and figure out what I did wrong.

OK....so here we go.  Fixed again today....better this time, so let's say 4 stars.  Entirely possible that my take on this is skewed by the fact that I don't get along with bell peppers.  I like them...but they don't like me.  I did follow the recipe & we will see.  Sweet wife just walked in the door so I'll see what she thinks shortly.  In a good mood as she just got a mani-pedi:-)....and dinner is ready!!

Edit: Wife gave a thumbs up:-)

Caution....makes a LOT more than you will need for 6 peppers.  If you are doing dinner for 2 (4 halves), consider cutting the recipe in half.

Thanks Chef John.....

I bought four large peppers and the filling fit perfectly.I followed recipe to the T except the cheese recommended is way to costly for my budget ($12.00) ,so i  bought a good quality wedge of parmesan cheese ($5.00).This turned out to be one of the best recipes i have ever made,however next time i will double the sauce because it compliments the peppers so well.Take it from a 60 year old guy from freezing cold Minnesota who does all the cooking for his family,you will love this recipe!!!

Delicious, satisfying as and totally yummy on a cold night. I cut the salt by half. I was confused when to put in the cheese, so I added it to the meat and topped the peppers with a bit of grated sharp cheddar. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was FANTASTIC.  My husband and I loved it, and so did my one-year-old.  Not a scrap of food left.  No adjustments needed to recipe.  I did use minute rice because I ALWAYS mess up regular rice.  It worked perfectly.

I love this recipe. I wanted something different than my old recipe. I used ground turkey rather than beef and used a pinch of chili flakes. I love red, orange and yellow peppers and they are in season so I used them. I definitely will make it again.

I have already made this twice. I had never made stuffed peppers and then is just so easy. The only thing I do different is I use a variety of colored peppers, it just looks pretty. It is just me and my husband so there is always extra for me to share, they are a hit and anyone who has tasted them sings my praises

A few nights ago I made this recipe.   Easily the best stuffed peppers I have made.   I really liked putting the tomato sauce mixture on the bottom of the pan and stuffing the peppers with the raw meat mixture.   This made 8 large servings, so we froze half of them for another meal since there's only 2 of us.    I only made one change and that was to use turkey sausage links in place of the spicy sausage because that's what I had on hand.   Also I had a partial package of Italian Cheese blend so I used that so I didn't waste food. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made it tonight for dinner and it was excellent. The only thing I did not put in was the sausage only because I didn't have any. Even without, the flavor was amazing, I am definitely making again.

Another fabulous Chef John recipe! I overstuffed my peppers and had   enough extra filling for at least 1 more pepper. Next time I will be more careful not to let the mixture spill into the dish because the spilled rice absorbed a lot of the delicious sauce, leaving less to spoon over the cooked peppers. Fantastic flavor, will make again!

"These peppers rock" is what my eight year old said when he tired these. I used season pork sausage instead of Italian sausage because that was what I had on hand. Excellent, bursting with flavor.

This was a huge hit with my family. The heat from the Italian sausage was excellent, and the only thing I changed was brown rice rather than long grain.

Sauce was really good.  Liked the addition of the hot sausage and cayenne which is usually not present in the traditional stuffed pepper recipes.  However, I like it better when the peppers are cooked first and the meats are browned before stuffing the peppers.  I thought the meat was a bit gummy and the peppers a bit too hard even though I cooked them longer then recommended.

Really good. Will make these again. I was a bit leery of putting the meat and peppers in the oven totally raw, but the sauce does a good job of cooking the peppers. It took about an hour, though, and I wasn't 100% sure the meat got cooked, but it sure tasted delicious!

I made these for my sister and brother-in-law who like spicy food. They were not disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly and although I am not a fan of very spicy food, they were still awesome! I will make them again, omitting the cayenne and using mild Italian sausage. I will keep the red pepper flakes because I think it is critical to the flavor of the sauce. Just happy I found this recipe!

Chef John, these are FANTASTIC.  Absolutely the best flavor combination and best stuffed pepper I've ever had.  I only had ground turkey in the house so I used that instead of the beef.  They were wonderful.  Thanks for sharing, I'm keeping this one.

I made this exactly as per the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing! What an amazingly delicious way to make stuffed peppers. As others have mentioned this makes a lot of filling so I added another pepper. To say this was a major hit is not an understatement!

I've made this about  5 times now and it's always a winner with my picky-eater wife and kids. I use mild sausage. So good!

This is the second time I made it, I love it!! Trying to be a bit healthier so the second time I made it with ground chicken and a pkg of chicken hot links (5 in package) took casing off and added the whole package. It was absolutely delicious. Thank you Chef John for this absolutely delicious dish!!!

DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe exactly as written. What a terrific combination of ingredients and flavors... Italian sausage, balsamic vinegar, beef broth. This is definitely a do over in my house!

I've made this recipe twice now and we've LOVED it both times. I can't stress how yummy these peppers are. I used ground turkey instead of beef and the first time I made them I browned the meat because cooking it raw seemed odd to me but the second time I followed the recipe exactly which allows you to heap way more filling into the peppers. It was definitely better to let the meat cook in the oven. The sauce was absolutely amazing, and next time I make the full recipe, I will be doubling the sauce, it's lick your bowl good. YUMMY!

So yummy! All my kids love these. You can tweak the meal content and also switch out rice for quinoa for more protein.

I made this Keto style, replaced rice with riced-cauliflower. Also, I did it casserole style....chop the bell peppers up and cook in skillet with meat and all the rest. It's the same recipe, just UNSTUFFED Peppers.  Easier to portion it out I don't have to eat a whole bell pepper.

It was pretty good. I didn’t use sausages but wish I did, I would’ve appreciated it more I think. I used plenty of herbs in both the sauce and meat mixture, but still found it lacking in flavor a bit. Might add extra cheese next time. It’s true that it makes a lot, i used 3 large peppers and one small one, but I wished there were more sauce for the leftovers. Ended up using an extra smaller casserole dish to fit everything and froze some of them.

I'm not a huge pepper fan. I'm not that crazy about rice either but my 97 yr. Old dad requested stuffed peppers so I chose this recipe.  It was so amazing.  I was so scared to put balsamic vinegar in tomato sauce thinking it was a big mistake but I trusted the process and I'm so glad I did. This will be a regular meal for us now.

Ok so o used what I had.  I had turkey burger Italian sausage style so instead of beef broth o used chicken bone broth.  That was the only change.  Wow!!!  Chef John makes awesome recipes.  My husband didn’t hesitate in seconds.

This recipe is excellent, as written. Great flavor!

I added some extra sauce, and put some sliced white mushrooms in it for some more texture.

Will make this again and again.

I couldn’t find a 10 ounce can of diced tomatoes. The only 10 ounce cans I could find was Rotel. Is that what it’s supposed to be?  I made it using 10 ounces out of the 14 oz can and everyone loved it.

This is a 'company' worthy meal.  I served it with cooked apples and warm buttered bread.  I was amazed how much the onion marinara magic added to the flavor.  
The written recipe is slightly different from the video recipe.  I used 1.5 pounds of a meat and filled 6 peppers, as per the video.
I will also share, it takes quite a bit of prep time and longer to cook than either the recipe or the video direct.

Another winner for Chef John!  Couldn't be more pleased with how this turned out.  I had some of the meat and also the tomato sauce left over, so I froze them individually.  Next time I can just thaw, stuff and bake...easy!  Thanks again for a great tasting recipe!

Fabulous!  I've made this a dozen times and it's 5 Stars as written, but here are my tips...
SAUCE:  It really makes the dish and I now nearly double all ingredients  with the exception of beef broth which I replace with 1 tsp bouillon base (comes in a glass jar).  It's too soupy otherwise. 
VEGETARIANS:  I make half using Gardein Meatless Ground.  I mixed the finished peppers up once and NO ONE could figure out which half was real beef. 
CARB CUTTERS:  I replace half the rice with riced cauliflower and it comes out exactly the same. 
SPEED:  This takes ages to make.  I use steam (microwave) rice and riced cauliflower.  Last night I used already cooked ground beef and turkey mix that I froze a few weeks ago and reduced the cooking time to 70 minutes.  My husband said there was no difference in taste. 
INGREDIENTS:   I use high quality parmesan (Sartori GRATED) and marinara (Rao's).  I also use sweet onions because they taste so good and don't burn my eyes.
YUM!!!

This recipe was a hit with the whole family. I tried to make exactly as is but I was missing a few ingredients (parsley, romano cheese) so I skipped or substituted them... I mixed in parmigiana cheese and topped it with shredded cheddar and it was still great. Thanks!

Subbed in raw chopped zoodles instead of the rice.  Also added a bit of shredded cheddar on top for the last few minutes of baking.  Definitely a family favorite!

I would definitely make this again. Maybe for company! 
 
For changes, I used one cup of cooked rice, used sweet Italian sausage, and slightly increased my amounts of that and the ground beef. I also nuked the peppers for 90 seconds before filling them.

Delicious.  I didn't have Italian sausage so I used plain ground pork.  Also thought sauce was a bit too thin so next time I will adjust how I prepare the sauce.  Other than that great filling

Great recipe!  I've made this several times and make only 1 change - COOK THE MEAT BEFOREHAND.  The first time I made this it was delicious but seemed to take hours in the oven for the meat to cook.  Now I just toss the stuffings together (with cooked meat!) and bake for 30 minutes.  Perfection!

Love love this recipe!  I make it frequently and eat off of it for days.  I add a whole pound of sausage and fry up the remaining stuffing and add rice to it for another meal or two.  So flavorful!

Good receipe, My preference (and audience) prefer more kick so I will add more spices next time, and a little more salt.  Substituted chirizo for the sausage, which might explain the need for more kick.

I used what I had.  I did not have a can of tomatoes so I chopped up a regular red juicy tomato.  I didn't have parsley, so I used cilantro.  I used brown rice and Paul Newman's tomato basil pasta sauce.  I used a can of beef boullion, but it seemed weak, so I added beef broth concentrate for added flavor and we all loved it...well done chef!  In my household, it is difficult for all of us to agree on a desired meal.  This one hit it out of the park.  Thank you!

I'm one of those who had never made stuffed peppers without cooking the meat first, and even though it took a while to cook, it was great! My husband ate 3 pepper halfs and literally licked his plate clean! The only changes I made were to use only 1lb of sausage (no beef, adjusted rice accordingly) and I didn't have marinara so I made a quick sauce with canned tomatoes and added the beef broth and balsamic vinegar as directed. The sauce did end up a bit watery, but it didn't stop us from gobbling it up and saving the leftovers! It did make a lot of stuffing. We just piled it on and it was fine.  The peppers were soft, but still had a bite in the time given. I would say if you like a softer pepper then parboil or cook longer, but these were perfect for us. Will become a regular! Thanks!

This version of stuffed peppers is my all-time favourite. It can be converted to meatless by using Yves Veggie Ground Round. Everyone loved it, including my meat-lover friends.

Every time I make this, I have to share the recipe! I'm not the biggest pepper fan, but this was fantastic. I had a bit of a snafu, when I cut into my peppers, part of them were moldy. I was already into the process didn't know what to do. I wound up layering the sauce, meat mixture and cut up peppers into a casserole format
 It was great!

I have made stuffed peppers for years but decided to try this recipe and I’m so glad I did! The main difference from my old way is to stuff with a raw meat mixture versus a cooked mixture. What a difference it made! So amazingly delicious.

Very good!  Substituted more beef for the sausage and had enough filling for 5 peppers. I used red, yellow and orange peppers. I also used half the salt and double the cheese. My family ate it all up.  Definitely a keeper.

If you like food with flavor this isn’t it. I followed the recipe as written and it’s bland. I like chef John but this was very  disappointing. I chose this because of the likes but I’m guessing the likes is due to the fan following. My advice to anyone reading this is to try a different stuffed peppers recipe.

Absolutely delicious!
Halving the peppers made it a much more manageable portion size. Leftovers were even better than the first night. Freezes well after baking. 
I used El Pato spicy tomato sauce and added a little crushed red pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe.
Will double this and freeze half right away next time.

This is an outstanding recipe. I did add more tomatoes. The peppers were not quite done and baked another ten minutes. I will either steam or bake the peppers before filling.

Absolutely will make again. Followed the recipe as closely as possible. Substituted one pound of venison for the beef. I find venison works very well with Italian type spices. Kind of a lamb substitute. Enough flavor that comes through in a remarkable way with this recipe. Great job Chef John.

These were really yummy. I followed the recipe exactly. My only feedback - less filling and more sauce! The proportions are a bit off. I ended up stuffing some jalapeños I had on had because there was so much left over filling. I would also double the sauce next time because it’s so good.

Amazing! Best stuffed peppers EVER!  Only thing I did different was to use red and yellow peppers instead of green peppers!  Crazy good!  Don’t even think twice about trying this one out,  you will be glad you did! This recipe is now in my recipe book!  Thank you Chef John!

Best stuffed peppers I ever had!  I had to improvise on a few ingredients but the results were still fabulous. Had no sausage so used only ground beef, had no beef broth so I used a packet of au jus mix I had on hand. Used the green lid type of parmesan cheese since I had no fresh, and used a Google search to find what would replace balsamic vinegar. .. that was apple cider vinegar and brown sugar. The sauce is FANTABULOUS and really makes this dish. I upped the sauce to 1.5x what the recipe calls for,  and next time I'll double or even triple it... it's so delicious spooned over mashed potatoes on the side.  I also added some dried Italian seasoning because I only had a small amount of fresh parsley left.  This makes a TON of stuffing, we ended up using several more green peppers and the last of the banana peppers in our garden. This will definitely be a staple in our rotation. Thanks, Chef John, for the fantastically delicious recipe!

It turned out really well. I added extra garlic and a bit more cayenne and used both parmesan in the meat mixture and Romano on top of it all.
This dish depends in large part on the quality and taste of the sausage. For our taste, we often prefer fairly hot Italian sausage. Many kinds that are labeled as hot have very little hot flavor. I also made this with a sweeter, milder Italian sausage. I added some extra herbs, 6 cloves of garlic and increased the cayenne and red pepper. Really tasty.
NOTE: The preparation time listed for this meal is 30 minutes. Starting with a great deal of chopping, cleaning the peppers, mixing the meat, etc., it took 1 1/2 hours. Then it takes an additional 1 hr and 15 min to bake it. I may be slow, but this meal was a chore. Worth it, though!

I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception, that I added chopped up linguica instead of Italian sausage and added 1 teaspoon of spicy smoked Spanish paprika. Very tasty!!

My family loves this recipe. We make exactly as the recipe states. Make it!! I personally would prefer a little less rice (1/2 cup vs 1 cup) but my boyfriend LOVES the rice. We use basmati, as that's our fave. 

Delicious !!

Great recipe, I ate the extra tomato sauce straight out of the casserole dish. Next time, I would sub for red peppers, and mix some of the tomato sauce in with the rice & meat.

If you make this dish make sure you have enough time.  I prepped the peppers the day before and it still took me about an hour to put together.  Hubby didn't like the sauce so much but loved the stuffing.  I like the idea of halving the peppers.  Next time I will make my own sauce.

Outstanding and well worth the effort.  I used Better Than Bullion instead of broth.  It will become a standard in our home.

This made A LOT of filling! I ended up making another 1/2 batch of sauce and filled an 8" baking dish too! I had a bumper pepper crop in the garden and used  large bell peppers (7) and  Poblano (3) (which I would not use again - the sweet bell pepper adds great flavor).  I didn't have the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, so used Parmesan and Romano and some mozzarella on the top once the foil was off.  Make sure to use all the spices; it does not turn out very spicy. My friend and I enjoyed this very much.

I recently got a meat grinder. I ground fresh chuck steak and added mild sausage and quinoa. Otherwise followed the recipe. Excellent. I made 13 stuffed peppers today.

Excellent recipe.   I added thinly sliced raw onions to the tomato sauce along with fresh basil.  I added dried onions to the meat mixture.  Cooking time seemed right.  I will be making this dish very soon.  Try 375 for 1 hour  then uncover and cook an additional 25 to 30 minutes.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes

I am not a fan of stuffed pepper however my hubby grew some of the best bell peppers this year. We had several and I needed to use them. I went by this recipe and didn’t change anything with the exception of using my own homemade marinara sauce. These are fantastic! This is a keeper!!

Hubs asked if I saved this recipe.  It was so very good.  I had a plethora of peppers from my plants so I decided to try this one based on the reviews.  It did not disappoint.  Only changes I made to this recipe was to use sweet Italian sausage.  There was enough heat for us with the cayenne and red peppers.  I also added a 1/4 cup of pesto to the mix as I have a lot in the fridge that needed to be used.  Else, the recipe was made pretty well as written.  Very tasty.  Thanks.

This is my 3rd time making these. Ive used ground turkey only, ground beef & sausage, tonight it will be ground chicken with Italian sausage. I like to add a dash of either worcestire or balsamic vinegar to the mix as well. Magnific!

One of my fav's of Chef John's. I cook it just often enough to have the recipe memorized. I really don't change much about it at all; why mess with perfection? 
Tonight I had a big can of Tomato puree as opposed to tomato sauce that I normally use so didn't need to thicken the sauce. Otherwise, when I have the tomato sauce I just thicken it with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in a tiny bit of water. (We like a thicker gravy over our stuffed peppers.)  All spices stay the same. 
The combination of spices and the use of two meats make this flavor combo have an all day cooked flavor. I have made this for all my family members including mom and dad and they not only raved, but swore it was the best stuffed pepper they've ever had. I freeze them after the first night's meal and they reheat beautifully. Maybe better? Is that even possible! :)

Super tasty! I used a couple orange peppers out of my garden. While they were a bit small it still turned out well. Had to make do with a couple items I was out of. Shredded a chunk of old VERY sharp Beechers cheddar as I had run out of parmesan. I also cooked all the meats before stuffing to reduce cooking time. Cooked at 375 for about 45 minutes. Turned out great! Definitely a keeper

Made this for the first time and did not change anything. Very flavorful with a little heat. I agree with another review that it makes a lot.  I used 6 medium size peppers  and still had a little left.

I always end up returning to this stuffed pepper recipe.  My family likes the milder taste of the yellow and orange bells so I use them instead of the green.  Also, I do cook the meat mixture ( adding in a little of the tomato sauce) before stuffing the peppers and putting them in the oven, and then only bake them for about 30 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!

I love all of Chef John’s recipes that I’ve made and this one did not disappoint. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. My family ate the whole thing. Nothing was left.

Awesome! Even my picky toddler scarfed these down! The only thing I changed (to save on the heat) was I left out the hot sausage and used ground turkey instead of beef (just a preference) everything else I stuck to exactly and they turn our great everytime :) Oh yeah, these have become a go to recipe for this busy Mama!

Delicious! The balsamic vinegar gives the sauce such flavor. Used red peppers instead of green. Will definitely make these again.

I made this twice, in less than two weeks, we enjoyed it that much.  While I despise people who rate based on all the changes they made, I’m giving this recipe 5-stars because it is so flexible as to what you can do with it.   I did make some changes based on what I had in my home, and I didn’t stray too far from the original recipe.  I saved time by using a package of Seeds of Change Quinoa and Brown Rice w/ garlic.  It’s an 8.5 oz pre-cooked package and it saved a bunch much of time!  I also used ground turkey as it’s what I had, and healthier.  I didn’t have marinara sauce, so I used a drained 14oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and a 4oz can of tomato paste, both with no added salt, for the base sauce.  (The Worcestershire is the key ingredient here!) The second time I made it I only had sausage, but more than it called for so it worked well.  You’re thinking, “Yeah, she “despises” people that change recipes, and look at what she did!”  I substituted based on availability and it was still fabulous, so I know if I did it exactly as posted that it would be just as fabulous!  This is a keeper and I look forward to making this for company as I know they’ll be impressed...it’s that good!

These are soooo delicious!  I made them stove top as opposed to baking them and they were perfect!  Love the addition of the beef stock to the sauce.

Best stuffed peppers I have ever eaten.  Fantastic hit with the family.  This will be my new go to recipe.  It was easy and was made with ingredients I usually have in my pantry.

I gave it four because it had nice flavor.  It is to expensive to make for a whole family, it took way to long to prep.   I cook for the VFW and I always try the recipe on the family first.  It was good, but they liked mine better and there were know left overs for lunch.    I personally think it’s the same as your meat loaf only you put it in the pepper haves.

Made this recipe, it was fantastic, wouldn’t change a thing.  Before baking in oven made a sauce of 1 can tomato soup, one can diced tomatoes (untrained), a little spaghetti sauce and 1/4-1/2 c water and poured it over & around peppers before tenting & baking.

This was my first time EVER making stuffed peppers (I love to cook, just have never tried making them).  I tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible.  The changes I made were ground turkey (my daughter wanted it instead of ground beef) and I used a little extra marinara and fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned.  It has a big hit.  I will definitely make it again.  It was served with a side salad.

I chopped the tops of the peppers and cooked them with the onions to add more depth and flavor. I added a half of can of sweet corn to the pepper’s mix and it all turned out great! Great recipe and will be making again soon.

This recipe was great! I boiled the peppers for 5 minutes and cooked the ground beef and sausage before filling the peppers and then baked it in the oven.  I also added some mozzarella.   Will be making again next week!

These we’re great. I made the recipe pretty much as written but used a bit less broth as I didn’t want it too soupy. Great flavor...I think all these ingredients would make a great pasta sauce.

Chef John's Stuffed pepper recipe is amazing.  The prep 
takes a bit time but it is so worth the finished product.  I used Uncle Ben's prepared rice which I heated in the microwave to save time cooking the rice.  I definitely think this can be prepared ahead of time and cooked when needed.  So delicious!!

Made this but had to use ground chicken as that is all I had on hand, also jasmine rice. I found the sauce too acidic so instead of sugar to help with that I added some real Canadian maple syrup.  What an amazing sauce.  Everyone loved it.  We each had 1/2 pepper and were so full.  Will definitely make again.  Freezes really well too.

I loved this recipe! I have made it several times and it always turns out great. The only change I make is I don't use spicy sausage, since some of the kids can't handle much spice. I do recommend you try this one for sure!

I swapped out beef and sausage for 99% lean ground turkey, chicken broth for beef and added an egg to the mix and they came out amazing!

My husband and I really enjoyed this! I saw some previous reviews that said it was bland but honestly have no idea how anyone would think that, but everyone has different tastes. The only change I would possibly make when cooking this again would be to reduce the amount of salt. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious and easy.  Saves the step of blanching the peppers, all done by baking longer.  If you have the time, well worth it

thank you chef John. Great recipe. I have been making it for years, didn't change anything.  Last year I started using  "Italian sausage with pepper and onion pasta sauce"  instead of marinara, also good. My entire family loves it.

No changes.  Made it per recipe instructions.  They were delicious.  This was one of my grandma's favorites and I had it often growing up.  My wife, who does not eat beef, commented on how good I had the house smelling, and made her hungry for piuzza, LOL!

I made this as directed except I had no sausage, so I just used more ground beef. Even with this substitution, the stuffed peppers were delicious. I do like the peppers more tender than they turned out to be, so next time I will parboil them first.

It was ok.....tasty.... but the consistency was not quite what I was looking for. I omitted the sausage because I don't care for it; otherwise I followed the recipe carefully. I am looking for a taste that I remember from many years ago (like 40) and a recipe/flavor that was more simple.I will keep looking. Judi D

I love this recipe. I make it every few weeks since I found it. Although I put only half the rice and add an extra .25 lb of ground meat. I also only make 8 peppers and make 2 meat patties that I bake in spaghetti sauce for my kids because they do not like the peppers.

This was Deee-licious!  The only tweaks I made to the recipe were the following: I didn’t use the cayenne because I don’t like things crazy spicy, I put a whole pound of the Italian sausage in because it only came in a lb at the store and I had no use for the leftover, I made some extra sauce because the jar of marinara I bought was 2.5 cups and, again, I had no use for the leftover, and I added some shredded mozzarella on top in the last 25 minutes.  I don’t think any of these tweaks make a huge difference to the overall recipe, I just didn’t want to waste anything.  The peppers turned out amazing and very filling...looking forward to leftovers this week!  The sauce was super flavorful and, while I was worried they wouldn’t be fully cooked due to how over-stuffed the peppers ended up being, they were perfectly done after the full 65 minutes of cooking!  Chef John proves himself yet again with this recipe!

My mom made this recipe when I was young.  It was one of the most exotic thing she made (we lived in rural Ohio at the time).  I followed the recipe pretty much to the “t”, but I did substitute basmati rice.  I thought it would bring a nice flavor as I, somehow, feel this is a Middle Eastern dish.  I also did the version in the video where you slice off the top, and not halve the peppers (as mom did).  Things came out well and after eating have two recommendations:  sauté the garlic with the onions.  Added raw, it was a bit overpowering.  Secondly, I’d increase the meat ratio against the rice.  The biggest conundrum I had was a side dish.  Which, ended up being mashed potatoes.

I love Chef John and this recipe is simple and very good.  What I like about him is his simplicity in explaining recipes, including the rational for taking certain steps and his down to earth approach. Eg. I will never use bottled  lime or lemon juice in a recipe where it really counts!  Plus, his recipes taste good.  Try the Quiche Loraine.  What I really like about this particular recipe is the flexibility with which he approaches the combination of possible flavors.  As a child, I loved this dish but never cooked it.  I came home late tonight and although this took a bit longer to bake than I expected, it was easy and I could use what I had on hand (after I told my husband not to arrive home from work  without several peppers) and  the taste  is fantastic.

The sauce is the best part.  I like to cook my meat and rice mixture first and par cook the peppers as well.  But baking them in this sauce is awesome.  I love to spoon it on when serving.

Amazing!! The balsamic vinegar was a beautiful addition to my homemade sauce. I did use only precooked (drained) ground beef and added...wait for it .....1cup mashed butternut squash. It helped to “hold” the stuffing together, adds a bit of healthy veg and moisture. Could not bring myself to add the fatty pork nor to cook the beef in the pepper itself. What an incredible melody of tastes. My husband loved it!! ( He was expecting the bland crumbly hamburger/rice mixed with grease concoction )Can’t wait for the leftovers. Will definitely make again

These were excellent! The addition of the sausage was perfect, although I used sweet and not hot. The sauce is awesome and would be good on other things too.  I might cut back on the rice, I used Jasmine and there seemed to be a lot of it.  Definitely a keeper!

This is the most incredible stuffed pepper recipe I’ve ever made. The only addition I made was adding more cheese. My family and I are cheese addicts

Was very disappointed because I have enjoyed better recipes from Chef John. First off the video did not match the recipe. Different ingredients and technique. I was confused as how to put together going back and forth from the video and actual recipe. The video made an onion and tomato sauce to line the bottom of casserole and create a sauce to serve on top of  baked peppers but it ended up too watery.  Used the filling from the video as well but it turned out dry and not very tasty. Cooking the peppers whole dominated the flavor. I would have preferred cutting  the peppers in half and topping with more cheese and sauce.

I made a healthier version by replacing ground beef and Italian pork sausage with ground chicken with Italian chicken sausage.  I also used brown rice.  These were the best stuffed peppers that I've ever made!

Followed Chef John's video version using red peppers - I don't care for bitter green ones - made extra sauce using a larger can of just tomatoe sauce - didn't even season it up - stuffed peppers needed a little extra salt that I used - they were delicious with the sauce served at the table for spooning over - simple  - but good!  Thanks- I trust Chef John - BTW big problem recipe is not the same as video clip - paid no attention that.

Absolutely delicious!
Cut the recipe in half except for the sauce. Sauce amount was perfect for 2 bell peppers. I used a spicy marinara so omitted the hot sausage and red pepper flakes. Also used yellow bell peppers as we don't care for green but this recipe rocks!

I have made this several times and it always turns out beautifully. Typically I make my own marinara but this last time I used a premade sauce. Definitely worth the extra bit of time to make your own, even though you'll be adding the beef broth, balsamic vinegar, etc to it. I would also suggest doubling the sauce (or even more!). Once again, Chef John delivers a delicious recipe.

This got rave reviews from my family! I used ground turkey and turkey Italian sausage to make it healthier. I also didn't have beef broth but I had onion soup mix, so I mixed up a cup of that and omitted the onion from the recipe. It was all absolutely delicious - the sauce is just amazing!!

My whole family loved these, even my picky-eater! As others have said, make some extra sauce. I did so by adding the remaining 8 oz. from a 24 oz. jar of marinara sauce, and making a little extra onion. It was perfect for the 3 very large (extra large maybe) peppers plus two smalls I had on hand,making 10 halves. I had a wedge of Asiago on hand so I used that in place of the Parmesan. Pack the stuffing into the peppers solidly and it should be about right for 4 very large peppers or so. So very delicious!my husband says they’re the best he’s ever had. I used black rice (purple when cooked) which adds a slightly nuttier flavor, and healthy Anthocyanins to the meal. As others have said, they’re even better the second day.

Not very good. I usually like Chef John's recipes. I did not care for this at all. The flavors were flat. I followed the recipe as I usually do the first time I make something. After that I make changes. In this case I am not going to bother to save it at all. I think I could have winged it without a recipe and come up with something better.  My husband also thought it was not worth making again.

Very good recipe here.  I particularly liked the tomato and beef broth sauce.  The sauce spooned over the peppers just before serving was to die for.  The only thing I'd mention is the cooking time was a bit inaccurate IMO.  I had to cook mine for closer to 35-40 minutes after removing the foil to get the peppers to the proper consistency. I'd say an hour covered and then 20-25 min uncovered would be more like it.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Give it a try.   You won't be disappointed.

The best stuffed peppers recipe I've ever tried. I double the sauce recipe because we like to use extra, and I reduced the amount of rice.  I tried mild sausage the second time I made it.  Was also delicious.

Great base recipe, but a couple of suggestions.  This dish needs way more cheese imo.  add 1/2 cup of parmesan and 1 cup of Mexican cheese combination to the mixture.  The idea for having a marinara sauce is brilliant, but this recipe is not the best.  I use my own marinara sauce recipe that has red pepper in it (example below).   That brings out the flavor of this dish much better.  Of course, top these off with some more of the Mexican cheese to caramelize on top.  If you liked this recipe before, try these tweaks ;) .

I made it exactly like the recipe called for. The sauce is tremendous.  I like not having to cook peppers and hamburger before baking. I do always add extra seasonings and cheese in everything I make. We just like it that way. 
I would serve this to company, its that good. I had extra stuffing, I just added to each pepper. can"t wait for tomorrow when we can eat leftovers!!!

These are the most delicious stuffed peppers I ever ate.   I followed recipe exactly but I used red peppers as I prefer them and i needed 6 peppers to for the amount of mixture it made.  I would cut down the Parmesan cheese next time but they were still delicious!! Everyone who ate them couldn’t believe how good they were!!

Absolutely the best stuffed peppers I have ever made, the entire family loved them and asked to have them again; so we will be adding them to our rotation. 

Followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the red pepper flakes and cayenne and used mild Italian sausage, as my daughter will not eat anything with even a hint of heat.  I also increased the sauce by half.  Great recipe!

This was really good.  Made it as written and my family loved it.  Once you've made it, you can adjust a bit to your liking, but it was good as is.  I even made one pepper without rice for my wife who is on this Keato thing.  She was mad because I didn't allocate more for her.

I just made this for dinner and it was a big hit! I made a couple of small substitutions. First, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef or pork. Secondly I used regular parsley, plus a microwavable sachet of brown rice with black beans for the filling. I noodled a bit with the seasonings, and added some garlic powder and quite a bit of salt and pepper. For the marinara sauce I used a pre-made roasted garlic pasta sauce from a jar. I am guessing I just about doubled the armount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and it was perfect to keep the turkey from getting too dry. I would definitely make this again - I love you chef John!

Not sure if it made a difference, but after I had the filling and sauce mixed up, I had to stop due to a family emergency, so the 9x13 with the sauce got thrown in the fridge as well as the bowl of the raw rice & meat mixture and it had to sit overnight.  So the next day I brought everything to room temperature, split my peppers and went from there. I doubled the sauce and used rotel instead of plain tomatoes. After I topped the very overtuffed peppers with the cheese, I spooned some of the sauce over the peppers, tented foil over the pan and threw them in the oven for an hour.  Took the foil off and let them go for another half hour.   They got to rest for at least half an hour also before we ate.  Spicy!  Very, very good.  The leftovers were even better!  Will make again for sure.

I would agree with the other reviewers. Make twice more sauce. Instead of pouring all of it at the base of the pan, I recommend adding some on top of  each of the peppers before placing in oven. (which is what he does in the video, except I didn't watch the video until after I made them!).  The rice dried out in the oven and was crunchy on top.  The recipe fills  a lot more than 4. I recommend adding another 2 peppers or decreasing the amount of rice, and meat etc.  Overall, I thought the flavor was okay, my husband was not a big fan of the dish. I wouldn't mind making it again, but with those changes I listed above.

Blackened peppers under broiler coated with olive oil and topped stuffed peppers with toasted  panko and grated parmesean. Didn't use Marinara, used diced roasted tomatoes, Baked in Cast Iron Skillet coated with browned butter.  Marvelous!!! (Had excess "stuffing" so baked it in pottery individual baking dish for leflt overs.

We loved the recipe, it was very tasty! However, if you watch the video/tutorial, it is not consistent with the recipe. Example: Chef John calls for 4 peppers halved in the written recipe and in the video he’s got more peppers than that and they are served upright and whole with just the tops cut off. A few other discrepancies, but I’m not going to watch again to point them out in this review... still really liked the outcome. Will double sauce for next time and maybe add more sausage. Other than that, it was delicious!

I've made this 3 times and they are by far the best stuffed peppers we've ever had. I made them whole, upright, our preference. Did not use the cayenne, pepper flakes, or salt for other's dietary reasons. I used long grain brown rice instead of white and multi-colored peppers instead of green. I also diced the pepper tops and sauteed them with the onions and divided as in the recipe. This is our keeper.

Delicious meal.  Very appetizing in appearance as well.  Made it as directed, and we loved it.  I think the balsamic and onions added to the marinara made it extra special.

Recipe is good, as all of Chef John’s are. As a suggestion, I’d recommend using a large enough roasting vessel, so as to leave a little space between peppers. If the peppers are wall to wall crammed together, it will take longer to get the sides of the peppers tender. All and all, a hearty dish. I also roasted the extra meat and rice mixture in a shallow meatloaf pan.

Delicious! Will make again. Did everything but the beef broth & cheese. Used a little water instead of broth & used nutritional yeast instead of cheese. So good!!

This was delicious! I followed the directions, except I didn’t stuff the peppers. I cut them up and made it like a one pot stew.

I picked Gigantic peppers, so much so that a 9X13 dish barely fit in the halves. After removing the pepper stem I chopped up the remaining pepper (2 red and 2 green) tops and added them to the mixture with half a zucchini chopped.  Tasted great with merlot.

This was delicious! I did change a few things to make it vegetarian but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I replaced the ground beef with a meatless version like Quorn grounds and replaced the pork sausage with Cannellini beans and the beef broth with vegetable broth. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this during the week, doubled the recipe but didn't have sausage so used 2 lb organic ground beef. I didn't have enough fresh parsley so used some dried. I bought a small hunk of Parmigiano Reggiano - yikes, pricey, but grated it and mixed it with some Trader Joe's Parmesan so that there would be enough for the recipe. I used 4 green bell peppers, 2 red, 1 yellow, and one orange, mixed up the colors in two separate casserole dishes. The only canned diced tomato  I had was bigger than what was called for, so drained off some of the juice from 2 cans, and there's plenty of the red sauce.  I watched the video several times, ignored the fancy work with the peppers - just cut them in half and stuffed them - they were big ones. This is the BEST Stuffed Pepper recipe I have ever prepared or eaten, absolutely scrumptious. Thank you Chef John.

Quite good...good flavor... easy to put together. I did microwave the peppers slightly to  soften before stuffing.

I made these for 3 people I thought liked stuffed peppers, turns out they never had liked them much - but they loved these. I did too. I did omit the cayenne, just because my mother isn't partial to too much zing, but it really didn't suffer for it. Making them for just myself and my husband, I definitely would have included. These stuffed peppers were really excellent, I'll be making them again.

AWESOME!!!!! These are the only stuffed peppers I make. My small changes: I use instant rice. Pre-cook the ground beef, drain and set aside. In the same pan, brown the sausage into crumbles and cook completely; drain and set aside. In the same pan cook the onion in sausage drippings. Continue as directed. Sooo good. Worth the effort and they freeze beautifully.

Made as directed, I thought this could use a little tweaking. First of all, the filling is rather bland and dry, I think the amount of rice is too much to the ratio of meat/sauce. Add the rice slowly and make sure it doesn’t overtake the meat mixture, I will definitely cut back if I make this again, likely half, this will also help with the issue of having far too much stuffing for the amount of peppers. The sauce mix is delicious! I’m not sure why this isn’t used as the sauce in the meat/rice mixture. Next time, I will just double the sauce mix and use it in the pan and in the pepper instead of the diced peppers. Also, it’s best to use a low fat meat as the fat can’t be drained off because the meat isn’t precooked before stuffing the peppers. Maybe these tips will help? Recipe is a good starting point though.

This is the best stuffed pepper recipe ever! I have made it twice now and it's a huge hit with my family. If you have a pressure cooker put 1 cup white rice and 1 cup water or broth and cook at high pressure for 3 mins. So much easier than cooking on the stove!

I don't like green peppers, but my husband does, so I cooked a portion of the stuffing in the sauce  beside the peppers. The flavors were outstanding and we  both agreed that it was delicious. I only cooked four peppers for the two of us so had enough stuffing left for another meal, and I froze that. I think that the beef bouillon and Worcestershire Sauce added a lot to the recipe. We will definitely be using this one again and again.

Excellent recipe! I used apple cider vinegar as substitute, 1 pound of bulk italian sausage, marinara and spiced red pepper pasta sauce, italian seasoning.  Prior to stuffing I blanched or boiled the peppers cleaned/whole in water for 5 minutes.  Shortens the overall cook time.

Chef John always delivers!
I doubled the recipe and increased the parmesan in the meat mixture. I didn't have time to prepare a marinara from scratch so I used store bought dressed up with extra diced tomatoes and Mirepoix. Every time I open my spice cabinet and see Cayenne, I think of Chef John!

We had a big pepper harvest today, and were able to stuff 12 small to average peppers with this recipe, using 2 lbs of beef. It was excellent despite the fact that we had to make some adjustments: no sausage, cooked the ground beef first to get it done faster, chopped up provolone and a little mozzarella instead of Parmesan, left out the pepper flakes and cayenne. We should have made more sauce; we used canned tomato sauce with added herbs from the garden and some garlic, which worked just fine. So happy to add this to our list of recipes for enjoying our peppers!

The uncooked meat in the stuffing browned up well with the longer than usual baking time.  The peppers themselves came out tender but still a bit crisp.  I used only two peppers but made the full amount of sauce, since I like my food swimming in gravy.  I'll be making my stuffed peppers this easy and tasty way from now on.

Best stuffed peppers I’ve ever had. I used Pablano peppers because that is what I had in the garden. I will never make stuffed peppers with bell peppers again!  I cut them in half length wise and laid the filling on top.

This was the best stuffed peppers recipe I have ever tried! I used red and yellow peppers as they were on sale.

These are without a doubt the absolute best stuffed peppers I've ever tasted.  I made them exactly as stated in the recipe and they couldn't be better.  I especially love the sauce.  I used four very large peppers and the amount of filling was right on.  Each pepper half makes a generous serving and only a light side dish is needed to have a complete meal.  I've thrown out all my other stuffed pepper recipes.

Used apple cider vinegar, worked well, minimal ingredient. Added thinly sliced raw onion to marinara sauce for bed for peppers, delicious at serving.

This takes quite a bit of prep and lots of pans but the smell once it was in the oven was divine.  I followed the recipe except I only had 3 peppers and so had six halves.  I did not, therefore, add the full amount of rice to the mix since I didn't have enough pepper halves to accommodate all the stuffing.  I did serve some of the remaining basmati rice on the side.  We did like this quite a bit but I would likely add some other spices next time.  Hubby thought it could use more "tomato" in the beef mix.  It was good but not great.

These are the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I say this knowing, full well, that my mother's were superb! I have made these several times now and the only thing that I have changed is that I use a mixer of sweet and hot Italian sausage in addition to the beef. I also sprinkle the locateli on the top when putting the peppers back in the oven for the last 25 minutes. We like sauteed spinach with garlic as a side and a loaf of good bread to soak up the luscious gravy. This is a Dish of Delish!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used regular, not hot, Italian sausage. I thought 1 cup of rice would have been too much but the ratio was perfect. I stuffed three large green peppers and two large zucchinis. Loved the tomato sauce too. I’m going to try the filling with cabbage next.

I made some pretty significant changes due to a myriad of dietary restrictions in my group, so I used lamb instead of beef+sausage, chicken bone broth instead of beef broth, and cauliflower rice instead of actual rice, but *wow* was it still so good. And super easy, too! 12/10, would make again.

Definitely a keeper! This recipe was absolutely delicious. We were on a bit of a budget last night, so I had to substitute the parm-regg with the regular powdered parm. Of course, powdered Parmesan is way more salty than the cheese itself, so I only added about 1- 1 1/4 cups. I also only baked it 15 minutes with the foil off because of that. Other than that, it was delicious and absolutely AMAZING when combined with the sauce. This recipe will be very much loved and used this coming winter!

made for a dinner party, really excellent!.  Slightly tangy and interesting. Made no changes to the recipe, but used a serving idea from one of the other recipes on allrecies.com, which made it showier.  Used medium peppers and cut off the stem end at about 1/2 inch and reserved the tops.  Stuffed peppers and baked as instructed.  Baked tops separately, covered, for about half an hour.  Served peppers with the "hat" on top, a lovely presentation.

I had an abundance of yellow and green zucchini from a friends garden so I subbed them for the peppers. REALLY good! I used brown rice and my own homemade marinara. Will put this on the winter rotation for sure:):)

We made this tonight following the directions exactly as written. We did multiply it to serve 12. This recipe turned out great. We will definitely be making it again as a base for cabbage rolls. I might add a little more cheese next time.

AMAZING!  These were the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I didn't have any beef broth so just added the rest of the diced tomatoes and a little bit of tomatoe sauce to make up the difference in liquid.
After watching the video,I used parchment paper then the foil, best trick ever, wish I knew this one a long time ago all the cheese remained on the peppers and not on the foil.
Thanks again Chef John gotta love ya!

Delicious recipe. I made one change since I am trying to eat fewer carbs. I added cauliflower rice to the ground beef instead of rice. My family did not even notice the difference.

I've made these a few times and each time need more than 4 peppers to use all the filling! This time I used 6 peppers with a smidge left over to fill half a hollowed out zucchini. 
Delicious recipe as is!

These were the BEST stuffed peppers I've had!! Absolutely excellent. My wife also said they were the BEST she has ever had. I did have to bake them longer than 45 minutes, they weren't quite tender enough. Other wise did not change a thing. I will definitely make again!!

Nice flavor.  I made it exactly as written (except forgot the parsley).  Next time I will drop back on the rice. The proportions of meat to rice was all wrong.  Also, 4 garlic cloves is a little strong.  Next time I would drop back to 2 or 3.  Finally, i would prefer a little thicker sauce--so I'll make my own and cook it down.

Not a 5,  but with some tweaking for personal taste, it could be a favorite repeat when there are tons of peppers in the farmers market.

I did make some changes. We used a breakfast sausage since we didn’t have any Italian sausage. I also used rotele hot tomatoes in place of regular ones and lastly couldn’t find the cheese so we used a combination of Colby Jack and  mozzarella cheeses. My opinion this came out real good. In fact the wife and plan to make it again.

I've never been a fan of Stuffed Peppers but over the years I've warmed to the flavor of cooked green bells.   Glad I decided to give this version a try-the flavors are more interesting than the standard recipes.  Probably key was the fact that I used Rao's Marinara sauce.  Next time I'll probably use their spicy version.  My husband loved it because there was plenty of extra sauce.  Only changes were to use brown rather than white rice and used a full 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes (drained the juice and added to the sauce),

Fantastic. Best stuffed pepper recipe ever. I've made it a few times exactly as written, so now I feel comfortable using the recipe as a guide and just "winging it".
Changes I've made to suit my taste: I use 1/2 lb. of spicy italian sausage, italian canned diced tomatoes, and usually have plenty of filling to stuff 5 large peppers, halved lengthwise. I usually add mozzarella to the parmesan that goes on top. 
I spray the foil with Pam so it doesn't stick to the cheese. I add about 5 minutes to the final bake time, since I have so much filling inside of huge peppers - want to be sure everything is cooked thoroughly.
My husband who "hates" green peppers in all forms cannot get enough of this. ;)
Enjoy!

Excellent! We used chicken Italian sausage as we had it on hand. We also used red bell peppers from our garden, which is why I went looking for the recipe in the first place. We used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of a 10 oz. can since that's what we had. A little more sauce doesn't hurt ;) Our bells were not huge, so we used 6 bells and they barely fit into the pan but it worked. We have 4 young kids and they all liked it a lot. Thanks for the recipe!

OK-OK so I  had two servings. I put this in "My Fitness Pal" and they gave it 421 calories. I used Chef John's Tomato Sauce for the marinara, and next time I think I'll just use that sauce alone for the base. This one was too thin (maybe because I didn't check the recipe and put in a whole can of beef broth instead of just a cup). Also I left out the pepper flakes and the cayenne because my wife doesn't like the heat. Since she didn't like it anyway, I'll do the pepper in next time. The filling is really good, and the peppers were perfectly done. All in all a very good recipe. Thanks Chef John

Another hit from chef John! Used red, orange, yellow and green peppers, as I like the sweeter mild flavor of the colorful ones.  Added some fresh basil (as I had it in my herb garden) and topped with fresh mozzarella cheese for final 10 minutes (because I like it!) Also, used sweet basil marinara from this site with my changes as noted in my review. Delicious!

This recipe was good but 1 cup of uncooked rice yields way too much rice.  I only used half the amount.  Otherwise, it was very tasty.

I always add extra garlic and fennel to this, not because it needs it but because I like a lot of those flavors. I use a jar of spaghetti sauce and a 15 oz can of tomato because it's more convenient and I like extra sauce.  I also use better than bouillon instead of stock and don't add extra liquid to the sauce because I like it thick (but it's good either way). It does take 1.5 hours to cook in my oven (I use a meat thermometer).

I left off 1 star like I  left out the cayenne  & extra red pepper flakes, too spicy. Used 1/2 pound lean ground beef & 1/2 pound  spicy Italian sausage.  This was the perfect spiciness without the volcano lava feel. ?? Over all the flavors are yummy. Beware,  you can feed an army with this measured as is.

Great Recipe!!!!
I substituted  white rice for Wild Rice for xtra flavor.
I also used ground breakfast sausage to my
Ground beef mixture,and a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce

Halving the peppers is definitely the way to go.
I was able to make 6 halves and they were 
Overstuffed with filling.
This meal was a big hit!!!
They were gone in minutes

Thanks Chef John!!!

And as always....

WE EN...JOYED

The BEST stuffed peppers my husband and I have ever had!  I would definitely serve this to company and this will be my go to recipe for stuffed peppers. It's the mix of the pepper and savory, incredible tasty suffing is amazing. Not too much rice, not too much meat, not too saucy, not too much cheese - this dish is perfectly balanced. And I did not change one thing, exept we used red peppers because I don't care for green peppers..

I've never been a fan of stuffed peppers ... until today. This was awesome ... although admittedly, I realized that I left out the tomatoes about 20 minutes after it went into the oven. Left out the cayenne and red pepper flakes because we can't do spicy. No matter, it was still delicious! Dad even liked it and he hates everything!

I really liked this recipe.  I used hot Italian sausage, which I felt added an extra depth of flavor. Next time I will use different colored pepppers. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this recipe with a few modifications like cooking the meat before stuffing the peppers and shortening the cooking time to 40 min. I also added some mushrooms. It was a hit.

I’m not a fan of peppers, but man was I in heaven eating this dish. I followed the recipe exactly... except I Instapot (12 min) the rice and used jasmine rice. Drizzling this sauce on top is incredible. I haven’t made any other Stuffed Pepper recipes, but I have made chef johns and he is spot on.

These. Were. Amazing! My fiancé and I absolutely loved them. I decided to make these last minute as I had two peppers that needed to be used and I wasn’t feeling a trip to the grocery store, so I had to make a few substitutes based on what I had on hand. This recipe was very forgiving and I feel like it’s a recipe that you can adapt to suit your tastes or what you have on hand.

This was a really good recipe. My family is not a spice fan so I used sweet Italian sausage and omitted the hot spices and it was very delicious. I will make this again.

I didn’t read through the directions so I cooked up the hamburger and sausage and added tomatoes etc. to the cooked meat. Cut peppers in half the long way and mounded the meat mixer on the pepper halves. Then I only had to cook the peppers for 45 minutes because I already knew the meat was cooked through. The recipe was very good. My husband told me it was a keeper.

cant even begin to tell you how good these are.  definitely a keeper recipe.  My happy accident was to make stuffing with full lb of spicy ground pork so I had a lot leftover.  With so much, I rolled leftover stuffing into balls and threw them into a muffin
tin and baked them alongside the peppers.  Two meals made in one oven.  very very good

OMG! These were fabulous!  I followed the directions as written, except I cut the tops off of the peppers instead of halving them.  I only had a small amount of meat mixture left over after stuffing 4 peppers.  I cooked them 1hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered.  Perfect! Definitely will make again!

It's recipes like these that make me feel like a great cook! These were amazing, beautiful presentation and everything. I did have to make a couple adjustments because I didn't have enough Parmesan, I added shredded cheddar and some feta, just to give it a little pizzazz. I didn't have tomatoes so I used the whole jar of marinara (spaghetti sauce) which turned out better because I had plenty of sauce that way. Served with corn on the cob... yum!

I liked these but my boyfriend thought they were bland. I would make them again but make sure to add the salt and pepper. I don't salt things much.

They turned out great.  I ended up with way too much stuffing but maybe my peppers were smaller.  I cooked up the extra in a loaf pan for left overs.  I did use quinoa instead of rice because my husband is diabetic and it’s a better choice.  The kids loved it.  I did use mild sausage because of them.

This turned out great, however I think I may need more seasoning in my meat mixture. I also may try browning and seasoning my ground beef in a skillet prior to get more flavor, but I'm sure I'll have to alter the baking time. All in all a great recipe.

My peppes must have been huge because I could only fit 6 halves into the 9" x 13" baking dish.  We're not big rice fans, so I used quinoa instead.  Seemed like a lot of sauce and it was a bit thin, so next time I think I'll leave out the beef broth.

Sorry.  I thought they were bland.  I will, however, try them again.  Next time I will make extra sauce and add a lot more of it to the meat filling.  The recipe has potential.

The reviews on this meal say it all. The very best stuffed pepper recipe I've eaten. I didn't use sausage because I didn't have it on hand, but next time around I totally will and can only imagine how amazing it'll be. Very flavorful and a crowd pleaser!

Best stuffed peppers I have ever made!  Used Minute Rice (less work), and chorizo, and added 1 teaspoon Italian herbs, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  This was enough for two dinners for my hubby and I, I will happily freeze the rest and look forward to eating it again!  My hubby says this is a $50 dinner - high praise indeed from one who does not pull punches if he doesn't like it! :)

I made this recipe for my boyfriend-who is not a fan of cooked peppers and myself. I followed the recipe exactly except I used red and orange peppers instead of the green, I like more sweetness. It was wonderful! It has a nice kick but not enough to deter someone who doesn't like spice. Even the boyfriend devoured them despite his aversion to peppers. This will become a staple for me, great version of a classic!

There is a reason this recipe has 1K reviews and 5 stars. It’s sooooo good. I saw that some people stuffed the peppers whole and topped with the lid but I opted to cut in half. I also used quinoa instead of rice. I stuffed the peppers as full as I could and I still got 11! The leftovers reheated well. Next time I make this recipe I think I’ll put a bit of panko, olive oil, and herb mixture on top the last 10 minutes for a bit of a crunch!

This recipe is spot on! Because so many others said there was way too much filling, I bought extra peppers. Did not need them. If you buy large peppers and stuff them tight and high, the amounts are perfect. As directed, I sliced the peppers in half. So delicious! Even had one for breakfast today that was left over. Thanks Chef for another great recipe!

This was surprisingly good. I used red bell peppers rather than green, and brown rice rather than white, but otherwise followed the recipe closely. It's a time-consuming recipe, but I'm sure I'll get faster as I cook this more often. It's definitely going into a regular rotation in my cooking repertoire. Delicious!

We made them! My husband and I cooked them together and they were a hit! We used ground sirloin, no pork. And I made the rice the night before. We did decide to cook the meat about 75% then add it verses adding raw meat.

It’s delicious! Almost perfect recipe except for cooking time. Baked as mentioned in recipe but meat was still a bit raw inside. Baked for 45 mins covered and 50 mins uncovered. Used 5 red / orange / yellow peppers. Still have enough filling for 3 more! Used Classico roasted garlic and onions instead of marinara sauce. Used 1 tsp salt instead of 2. Used chicken broth instead of beef. Used grated mozzarella cheese as toppings.  Everything else was the same even the techniques mentioned in the video. I placed the leftover filling in the freezer for a future batch. :) my bf said it tastes really good (and he makes his own stuffed peppers)!

I've made this dish twice now and it's the best stuffed pepper recipe that I have tried.  I made two ingredient changes to make it a tad healthier.  I replaced the rice with quinoa and replaced the Italian sausage with extra lean ground turkey.  I used equal parts of turkey and ground beef.  The last time I made this recipe, I assembled it the day before I baked it.  To cut down on the baking time I decided to boil the peppers in salted water for about 5 minutes, and I also cooked the meat through before I assembled the peppers.  The next day after work I didn't have to bake them as long (heating them through only took about 30 minutes)  and dinner and clean up were a breeze.  Even our picky 10 and 6 year old boys ate every last bit!  Thank you, Chef John!

This is the first recipe that I have come across that is rated 5 stars, so I had to try it! I had to use the ingredients on hand so a few substitutions were made: I used a little beef gravy and garden style spaghetti sauce in place of the beef broth and marinara sauce. Instead of pork I used hot turkey sausage. Even with the exceptions this was a fantastic recipe. Next time I will use shredded chicken-yummy!

This was excellent!!! I added a little more Italian Sausage and a little less Ground Beef.  Any ground meat combination would be GREAT in this recipe. The sauce is out of this world good!! Thank you Chef John for sharing this recipe! BTW...leftovers were fantastic, too!!!

Let me start by saying I was skeptical of this recipe I created one years ago and couldn’t remember my ratios..I made this with a few changes like a even pork to beef ratio a teaspoon Worcester sauce and a few additional seasonings..I had filling left over and tasted it after cooking and was shocked this is pretty much better than the recipe I made up eons ago..we will see how everyone else feels about it and I’ll update

I LOATHE green peppers, especially Stuffed green peppers!  But someone gifted me a pile of them, and my boyfriend likes them, so.... I thought what the heck, let's give it a try, although I had no intention of eating them. I followed the recipe, and reviews.  ( I doubled the sauce) And I used Rotell to replace the tomatoes. ( just using what I already had on hand. I had a little extra rice, and a little extra sausage, so I threw that in.  It filled two casserole dishes, plenty of stuffing to fill 20 (halves)  It smelled so good, I wanted to try it, (but was prepared to gag.)  This recipe is AMAZING!  I'm a convert!!  This fed no less than ten adults, even the "non pepper  eaters" like me.  RAVE reviews all around!

I substituted the ground beef and pork sausage with ground turkey and hot Italian turkey sausage. I followed the rest of the recipe and it was a big hit. I will definitely be adding as a favorite! Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely delicious with just the right amount of "kick" to it. I made the sauce and ground beef mixture the night before so all I had to do was put it all together and into the oven. So easy to make and a real treat to eat. Cutting the peppers lengthwise was a great idea because I could pile them high with stuffing and we were not overwhelmed with excess peppers.  Next time I  just might put a little of the sauce on top of the peppers before putting in the oven but no other change.   Too good the way it is.  Yet another Chef John winner!!!

Great dish.  I followed recipe precisely with the sad exception of excluding the pork sausage, simply because I had none.  Its absence may account for the dish's lack of zing.  If you shy from zing, leave out the pork.  Next time I'll include sausage, and may add a few hot pepper flakes to elevate this already quite sound dish.

This is a good recipe for stuffed peppers. My son kept saying how great it was during the whole meal and he's not a huge fan of peppers, so that's saying something. My dad wanted to know the recipe, but commented that this was a little on the spicy side. I used cayenne pepper instead of crushed red pepper flakes in the same volume and it was a little too spicy for our tastes. Next time, I will go with 1/2 tsp black pepper with the rice and meat and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper in the red sauce and I recommend that anybody else do the same the first time they make this unless they like their food spicy.

This recipe is great. I only use 1 lb of ground turkey instead of using both beef and sausage and there is always more than enough filling for 6 bell peppers. If I have any extra, I make little "meatballs" and just place it directly in the marinara sauce. They cook nicely and everything always tastes amazing. I have made this recipe several times and it always is a hit. I also add a little of my favorite hot sauce to the top. It gives it just enough of a kick but nothing too crazy!

These are amazing! I’ve made these multiple times and can’t get enough! My picky eater loves them too. I don’t add the extra tomatoes it calls for, just the Mariana sauce. Everything else I do!! Soooo good.

This was a good recipe, but I would suggest two changes.   1) brown the meat first so that the grease can be drained.   2) add a couple of beaten eggs to the stuffing to add flavor and to better hold it together.    But otherwise, it's a great recipe.

This is one of our favorite meals. I make it every other week or so.  There are only few changes I make: Large red peppers are more tasty than green; I cut the peppers in half, top to bottom, and remove the ribs. Since there are only two of us now, I use four 8x8 aluminum pans sprayed with non-stick spray, place two peppers in each pan then fill the eight half peppers with stuffing. Next I cover the pans with heavy duty foil and write baking instructions on the foil. I cook one that night then freeze the rest. A salad and to

Yum! I’m dairy free so I took that out and tossed a couple of diced tomatoes on top instead. It had a great flavor and the sauce was excellent. I will be making this again.

Decent recipe and was tasty.  My only gripe is I used 3, rather than 4, peppers, and still barely had enough meat to fill them.  Also, instead of putting all the sauce underneath, I spooned it on top of the peppers/meat.  As it baked, sauce did venture down underneath.  Was good, and will make again.  Only change will be to up the quantity of meat to a total of perhaps 1-1/2#.  Served with mashed potatoes and froze leftovers.

Great recipe!  The balance of the sweet peppers to the spicy sausage and cayenne pepper was perfect.  I used jasmine rice and it worked wonderful.  
The peppers were still a little crisp on the bottom, but the tops were soft.  We liked the different textures.  I will keep making this one!

As good as my the ones at my favorite restaurant.  My BF is very particular about food and he LOVED them.  The only change I made was used red and yellow peppers as we don't like green, reduced the salt to one teaspoon and baked about 15-20 min longer than indicated.  I tested with meat themometer and it was not even close to done with original directions.  They were def better the next day so in the future I will make the night before.

I am a huge fan of reading reviews -- especially when they are at the extreme 1 star or 5 stars.  This recipe was extremely tasty but I did make a few tweaks.  I added 8 oz of hot Italian sausage, additional garlic and red chili flakes,  and substituted ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I would also recommended making more sauce to make sure the meat in the "middle" of the pepper gets the flavor as well.  Loved having extras to bring to work especially since it is already portioned out.

Made this exactly as directed. I used 10 oz Rotel original tomatoes and Rao’s Tomato Basil sauce.  This had a nice amount of kick which we loved.  BEST. STUFFED. PEPPERS. EVER.  Forget the recipe with tomato soup; this is the new standard.

Made this multiple times exactly as stated and it turned out perfect each and every time.  Not only do I love this recipe but my family asks for it all the time too.  I especially love Chef John's recipes and videos.

Outstanding!  The hot italian sausage is a super flavorful addition.  I heated up some leftover mashed potatoes, spooned some of the sauce over it, kicked back,  and what a savory meal!  My only deviation from the recipe was to use quick cooking rice and reduce the salt from two teaspoons to one.   The second time I made this I used very lean ground beef.   (The first time I made it, I used ground beef with a higher fat percentage and needed to skim off a little fat (not much though) from the sauce at the end.)  BYW, I've made this recipe twice and both times  the quantities worked out exactly as stated in the recipe.  Some reviews indicate that there's leftover filling, but that's not my experience.   So I found this recipe very accurate.

This was fantastic! I followed the directions, but put a bit of shredded Cheddar cheese on top during the last 20 minutes of cooking. 

I agree, this makes more sauce than 4 peppers worth.  The next time I make this, which will be very soon, I will use at least 5 peppers. I will also parboil the peppers first as another review stated. They were still a little crunchy for my taste. Overall, at least 5 stars, if not more!!!

I thought the flavors were great in this recipe I made a few changes I used veal and pork, I felt that the meat needed to be more firm, so I added crumpled bread crumbs to keep it from falling apart from the peppers, other than that I enjoy this dish.

I've never written a review before, but this recipe warrants it.  Best. Recipe. Ever.   Made it with a couple of modifications.  Used red and yellow peppers because I didn't have green.   Used Aylmer's Accent Chili diced tomatoes and left out the Italian parsley and cayenne pepper.    I will be making this recipe a lot!!!!

Wow, was this ever so good! My hubby has been asking me to make stuffed peppers for some time now. I put it off because I didn't think me or the kids would like it.  When I came across this recipe, I had bell peppers and marinara sauce in the refrigerator that needed used up, so I decided to give it a go. The whole family LOVED it, including the youngest 6 year old. We all agree it should go into our regular meal rotation!

It's a good recipe, you can't go wrong as is. My husband who doesn't care for stuffed peppers had seconds! It's even better for lunch the next day!
I've made it with brown rice too. I prefer to parboil my rice then add 15-20 mins extra cook time with a little water in the baking dish so it doesn't get too dry.  I also add some cayenne and red pepper flakes to the mixture too (I like my food spicy). My advice: give this recipe a shot :)

I have never had Chef John steer me wrong. These are delicious. I made the rice, and cooked the onion and sauce the day before, as well as prepped the meat filling, all the day before since it takes awhile in the oven, on weeknights, time is short. These were great for dinner, and the leftovers were amazing for lunches.

I made some changes because I had to, but I'm sure if you follow the recipe to the letter, it will be awesome! For example, I used fresh tomatoes, removed the skins, and diced them because I don't like the "tinny" taste of the canned diced tomatoes available in my neighbourhood. I strongly recommend making double the sauce, because it's really good.

I would give these 6 stars if I could - we LOVE them. If it's possible, they're even better the next day for round 2! If I have any leftover filling (that's after stuffing 5 or 6 peppers - it makes a lot), I freeze it and use it in spaghetti sauce. A winner!!

So I wasn't really a stuffed peppers fan.  But I was asked to make them enough times that I reluctantly said fine.  They're surprisingly good.  Only changes were to add a pinch of sugar to the sauce and use regular sausage - not hot - cause that's what I had.  Filling makes a ton.  Which is fine, I freezed the filling and made more peppers tonight.  Really love this!

Really good recipe.. but if youwant to make this recipe over the hill and blow this recipe away..

Take all the drippings left over in the pan and put in a pot and bring to a gentle boil. 

Whisk in pre blended flour and milk to make a tomato gravy.

That's the stuffed pepper secret sauce!

Just do it!

Amazing. The sauce really makes this recipe. Also, I cooked mine for almost 2 hours waiting for my DH to get off work and it was still delicious. It only made the peppers that much more tender. Definitely a keeper!

The only change I made was to add a bit more Italian sausage and a teaspoon of sugar (southern thing).  My folks gobble this dish down.  Never, never have to worry about leftovers  'cause there ain't any!!!  Yes sir, keeper... Thanks, Chef John.

Delish!  Made it exactly as written.  I was concerned because my hubby and I both didn't like these as children, but we both cleaned our plates.  I did have some left over stuffing even though my 4 peppers were very large, just put that in the freezer for next time, should fill about 2 more.

I did not use the rice because I wanted to serve mashed potatoes with it.  I substituted breakfast sausage for the italian sausage as we do not care for italian sausage.  I was out of balsamic vinegar but the sauce turned out very tasty with just the marinara sauce and the beef broth and onion.  I was in a time crunch so I cooked the meat and parboiled the green peppers for 3-4 minutes.  It was a big hit.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These were absolutely delicious. We ate them with steamed Italian green beans. Sauce was so good we sopped it up with crusty bread. The ultimate comfort food.

The peppers were not well done, I like them more tender. I will use this recipe again and I will bake the dish at least 15 minutes longer (1 hour total).

I've made this many times and love it! I'm sometimes lazy and just use my homemade spaghetti sauce instead of making this sauce. Then I just drizzle the balsamic vinegar over the peppers before I stuff them. I've tried using only hamburger or only sausage and have found that the mixture is best. Anyway, this is a keeper!

Awesome! However, I did have to substitute with a can of tomato sauce for the marinara sauce, nor did I have the cayenne pepper or the sausage. I realize this is a lot to change, however it was loved by all and even better the next day.

Made just like the recipe except used Mild Italian Sausage, and used Pace Salsa for the sauce to cook them in instead of Marinara sauce.
They turned out excellent, moist, tender but not soggy. I think next time the only other thing I would do differently is to add more seasoning  to the beef onion mixture as it seemed a little bland, otherwise perfect

These were delicious! My husband and youngest son loved them, my older two kids didn’t care for them but I’d definitely make them again. I prepped them on the weekend and cooked them on the weekend to make weeknight meal prep a bit easier.

I love this recipe!  I made it exactly like the recipe, with the exception of using turkey breakfast sausage instead of beef and pork.  The recipe made enough for dinner and some leftover that I froze.  The flavors are amazing.  I will be making this again!

These stuffed peppers were fabulous.  I did not change a thing.  I did cook for a little while longer uncovered but it did not change the flavor or texture.  Definitely worth the time spent putting this together.

This recipe is amazing! Made it today, and because I never follow a recipe completely, I made a few changes. I didn't have marinara sauce so used tomato sauce instead because it's what I had on hand. I didn't use any cheese because I'm not a fan of melted cheese. And I used one red, one orange and one yellow pepper just because they're less bitter in my opinion. Otherwise, followed the recipe. These were the best stuffed peppers I've ever made. Highly, highly recommend!

This is fabulous! I have never left a review before but I do love Chef  John's takes on recipes. I'm always looking for new recipes with low carb counts,  so I did replace the rice with chopped up cauliflower and it was still fabulous. I did not use the marinara sauce because I prefer my food with not too many taste overflows and found the tomatoes within the pepper mixture plenty.I have put this recipe on my "must make frequently" list....and that's a hard list  to get on.  Cheers Chef John.

I've been making stuffed peppers for years but wanted something a bit different, this is it!  I was leery when I saw the amount of sauce generated from baking but I don't think I'd change anything; my husband said they were excellent and he thought the way I made them before were thumbs up.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Wonderful Recipe! My neighbor said they tasted better than her mom’s (but not to tell her). I’ll be making it again. The only thing different I did was to cook the rice in chicken broth instead of water, and I also added frozen corn to the stuffing mixture. Gives it an extra little pop!

This is how I have always made them bit with 2 additions. First, I pre-boil the peppers for about 3 minutes before filling them and I add diced peppers to the filling for more green pepper flavor.

Delicious recipe.  I cut the peppers in half lengh wise  as shown in the recipe picture and it came out nice. I did not add additional cheese on top. We felt 1 cup was enough.  I will put this in my favorites.

I really liked this, as did my elderly neighbor (who originally asked me to make stuffed peppers for her). Like others, I had a LOT of filling left over, so I ended up putting it into a loaf pan and freezing it. Several weeks later I took it out and baked it in a 425-degree for two hours (one to defrost, one to cook). I put BBQ sauce on the top for the last 30 minutes. SO GOOD!

So I used this recipe as inspiration for Mexican stuffed peppers.  I used taco seasoning in the meat with some additional spicy chili powder and cumin, and rotel tomatoes instead of marinara.  Turned out awesome!

So tasty, very large recipe for just two people.   SO knowing that in advance, of course,  we put half in the freezer for another busy day.   I have enjoyed the filling as a stand alone for lunch.   Yummy

Chef John, 
You are awesome and I follow you and make many, many of your delicious dishes. I have a question however regarding this recipe. You say to reserve half of the onions....what happens to the other half? I added my half batch to the sauce.  Maybe I missed something? But other than this, the peppers were awesome. Thank you.

I had some large green peppers I needed to use quick so I found this recipe. It turned out really well. The filling was perfectly cooked and the peppers were tender. Of course, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I had some tomatoes from our garden that we had just stewed with onion and garlic, so I used those for the sauce base and in place of canned diced tomatoes. I didn't use sausage as I wanted to only use things I had on hand. I used less cheese as I needed to share it with another recipe. I mounded the filling up high because I only had 3 peppers that were usable, but it still cooked perfectly. My husband liked it but said it needed salt, which made me realize I forgot to add the salt. If I use stewed tomatoes in place of marinara again, I would probably add a few herbs and more balsamic vinegar. Thank you Chef John! I have a list of other recipes of yours I'm planning to try.

So delicious! This is my go-to recipe for stuffed peppers. I've never eaten or made any better than this! The only thing I do differently than the recipe is I use only ground beef (usually don't have hot pork sausage on hand) and cook it in the skillet so the baking time is a little faster and the sauce gets more beef flavor.

omg this was so good, i could eat the sauce with a spoon. I'm not a good cook, but i made this successfully. It's a little labor intensive for a kitchen klutz like me, but OH MY GOSH. this is the best stuffed pepper recipe EVER. The sauce makes it. LOVE.
PS they freeze wonderfully. i got to eat them ALL since husband is a neanderthal & like haunches of animal.

The only change I made to this recipe was to substitute ground bison in for the beef as we don't typically eat much beef and we used yellow and orange bells instead of green.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Will definitely make this one again.  Hubby loved it too, kids not so much just because of the slight spice of the Italian sausage.

This recipe was fantastic, which will definitely be made again.  My only mistake was I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used Penzeys Crushed Red Pepper a little to liberally.  Still was great but next time I'll cut that back some.  I also used brown rice and MILD Italian sausage.  Next time I may try to

Delicious.  I made additional stuffing mix, created meatballs from the surplus and surrounded the peppers with them in a lasagna pan while roasting.  This assured plenty of leftovers to add to meals throughout the week.  
Thanks Chef John, another terrific recipe.

This was good but next time I'll add a little less Worcestershire sauce as I personally felt it kind of overpowered the taste of the sauce.. other than using a real onion & garlic close instead of the dry powders I followed the directions exactly and it was a hit.

This recipe was very tasty. I didn't use any of the marinara, just cooked the peppers. Only change I made was ground beef instead of sausage because I'm not a fan of sausage. Will definitely make it again!

I made it twice and with some substitutions and it was fantastic. I used organic chicken stock instead of beef broth and Royal Blend brown rice with flax instead of white rice. I used arugula instead of parsley and Romano and shredd Mexican cheeses instead of Parmesan. I used a chipotle hot such instead of pepper flakes and cayenne and I used the contents of two sweet Italian sausage links and a pied of organic ground beef. I a

Outstanding recipe! Directions were clear, measurements were perfect, and definitely the best stuffed peppers I have ever had! I did substitute brown rice for white, and it worked out very well. Putting extra Italian cheese on the top of the peppers really made them great. Considering that I hated stuffed peppers when I was growing up, it's funny be singing such high praises for stuffed green peppers! I would definitely recommend trying out this recipe; I know I will be making it again!

These peppers will definitely be added to my rotation of family favorites that I make regularly.  I made them exactly as the recipe was written, but I omitted the rice because I try to follow a low carb diet.  Even without the rice, they were delicious.  They did take longer to cook than the recipe said. It ended up taking 90 minutes for them to be cooked completely through.

Our friend wanted some stuffed peppers, he lives alone, and and since I had just picked peppers out of the garden, I decided to try Chef John's recipe. I'll just chime in with everyone else and agree these are delicious! I ended up with leftover filling but better too much than not enough. Using marinara for the sauce is sheer genius and worked like a charm. I have already printed this off to put in my file. Only the BEST recipes go in it!

Amazing, like everyone else has said. I made this LOW-CARB by replacing the rice with sautéed cauliflower rice! The sauce is the bomb; we spooned a ton of it over each pepper and more for our bowls before serving! Thank you!

I don't often review recipes, but when my husband gave this a "fantastic" tonight, I felt compelled!  I have made the same stuffed pepper recipe for years, but I will now ditch that one for Chef John's!  I didn't have everything on hand that this recipe called for ... and although I know how much some people hate it when reviewers alter the recipe, I will mention my changes so that others might benefit.  First, I used all ground turkey (but will add turkey sausage next time), I didn't have the Italian parsley and used dried parsley, and I don't eat beef, so I substituted chicken broth.  Also, the can of tomatoes I used had basil, garlic and oregano.  I can't imagine this being any better, so these substitutions were acceptable!  I also used a mix of red, green, and yellow peppers ... this is really, really excellent and will now find a home in my permanent recipe file!  The sauce really makes a difference!

My less-than-perfect rating is either due to unrealistic expectations based upon the amazing reviews of others, or because I cheated on a couple of the ingredients. That said, it was as good as any I've ever had, but it didn't blow my mind.  I used green pepper halves as suggested in his revision video of this recipe, and I think that was a good decision.  Next time I'll get garlic and not substitute garlic powder, I'll remember to buy balsamic vinaigrette, and I'll add more salt (fixable after the fact).  All in all, good meal.

I made this three times, once a week for the past three weeks. My hubby loves it, and so do I.  Sometimes I put my homemade meatballs, broken up and some sausage in too and add my own homemade sauce.  I do not use turkey or chicken meats for this as my hubby is not fond of it. All in all, its a great recipe and I will continue to make it often !!!

Made these stuffed peppers for dinner,  following the recipe exactly as written.    My hubby and I both loved them.  Will definitely make them again, but will cut down on the amount of meat and rice.   I had enough stuffing left to make a small meatloaf.

Needless to say, I did not follow the recipe exactly because I was working from memory.  After I retrieved the recipe, I went almost exactly as written except for the following.  So, first change was, I cooked sausage and hamburger meat on top of stove.   I made certain to drain it really well because the thought of serving greasy stuffed peppers is  a stomach nightmare.  I used long grain dark rice that cooks in 40 minutes. Only cooked it 20, so as not to make it mushy by overlooking since it would finish in the oven in the marinara sauce.  Added more tomato sauce to the meat mixture around a cup more and also added some olive oil to the meat mixture.  I was afraid that since I had drained the meat, it would be dry, but that wasn't a problem since the peppers are floating in marinara sauce.  I allowed them to float overnight in the refrigerator to allow the flavors to mix.  I used 4 large green peppers cut in two, with holes punched in the bottom. Also cooked it almost 2-hours at 325 in a preheated oven with the roasting pan sitting on a cookie sheet and covered with aluminum foil and parchment paper directly over the peppers.   The cheese was beautifully melted and certainly not stuck on the paper.  It smelled and tasted wonderfully and I got many compliments from the Barnes Family Reunion, in fact, 2 people asked for the recipe.   This recipe takes longer to prepare than specified and longer to bake, too, but it is worth the prize of a rich, delicious stuffed pepper.

Best stuffed pepper I've ever had, and my wife said the same. I spiced it up a bit using only hot Italian sausage and diced tomatoes with green chiles. And since I really don't care for green peppers, I stuffed poblanos instead. Everything else as written minus the cayenne and crushed red pepper, as I really didn't need any more heat. Another hit for Chef John!

Very tasty! I used ground turkey and chicken caprese sausage to lower the calories so I could use all that Parmesan!  I also used a flavored instant rice. I shouldnt have used the salt because of the flavored rice. But it was a hit!

This was easily the best stuffed pepper recipe I have ever tried! I put everything together a bit differently due to time constraints but the combination of spices and flavors was outstanding. I cooked the filling and sauce (mixed together) on the stove and then put a little remaining marinara sauce on the bottom of the pan then baked the filling inside the peppers for about 25-30 min. It was fantastic. Peppers were a little undercooked and crunchy but no one seemed to mind. Also I had at least twice as much filling as I needed (to be fair I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef) but that worked out great because my kids loved eating the filling just by itself.  My boyfriend requested this dish again so I know it was good! Lol! Will definitely make again!

Made per the directions. End result was fantastic. The acidity of the red sauce and balsamic vinegar complimented the bitterness of the green pepper.

Absolutely fantastic!!! So flavourful and well-enjoyed by all! Only changes I did was added sautéed cut up mushrooms to the filling, omitted the pork, and used lean ground turkey instead. Also, since I didn't have much parmesan, I put some in the mixture, then added shredded cheddar cheese on top for the last 5mins of baking. Terrific recipe, a MUST TRY!

I followed the recipe as written, only change was I used 1 clove of garlic instead of 4, just a matte of taste, and I used uncooked minute rice instead of cooked rice, and it turned out fabulous! I literally could not stop eating. My whole family loved it. Will definitely make this again and again! Oh and I also topped with mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan.

Super tasty recipe, the balsamic vinegar really adds a lot.  I didn't have sausage, but did have a sausage seasoning blend so I used another 1/3lb ground beef, added some Italian seasoning and cayenne, and made my own 'sausage.'  The only other change I made was to add about 1/2 cup of the sauce mixture to the ground beef mixture.  It turns out the hubster doesn't like bell peppers, but LOVED the ground beef mixture so  I'll be using this recipe sans rice for either meatballs or meatloaf.

I made these exactly by the recipe. My husband LOVED them. My tween and teens took their required "thank you for cooking" bites and that was all. I don't eat red meat, so I can't say. My husband did say they were a bit dry, so I'll add more sauce to the mixture next time.  He has requested them for Father's Day. Thank you for sharing!

These are consistently delicious! I just use a bag of microwaveable brown rice for ease of use (read: laziness) and they turn out great. The sauce is excellent and if you have leftovers make sure to save the sauce too. I also use whatever color peppers are the least expensive.

I made this recipe exactly as Chef John has it listed. We both thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It would be great  for company. With a salad, hot bread, and w nice wine. The filling is enough for probably 5 peppers. We certainly will use this recipe again.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe states.  Only adjustments were for more hot pepper flakes, and a little more sauce.  This was amazing.  I will definitely make this again.

I made the recipe as written except I didn't have Italian parsley so I used regular. This recipe took me a while to do and knowing that I made a double batch of it and put the meat and sauce (separately) into the freezer. Really glad I did because it was exceptional and everyone really enjoyed. I put the green peppers into  deeper enamel roasting pan because I don't like foil touching my food. It worked perfectly. My compliments to Chef John. He is my go to for a great meal.

Have made these many times over the past several years.  Absolutely the BEST stuffed peppers I have ever had.  My entire family loves them - even my picky 11 yr old grandson.

Made according to directions. Husband ate every bite.  Gave it an A+.   Since I am vegan I made it using tempeh italian sausage that I made and it was wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made it exactly as shown. It was good but I was hoping for this amazing sauce and TO DIE FOR stuffed peppers and didn't get it. My family said they were good but weren't overly enthused. I did make extra sauce for topping. I could make again but it definitely isn't a go to recipe like I hoped for.

Does anybody realize that the printed recipe is completely different from the video? I haven't made it yet (had to put stars in to get published), but I intend to use the video recipe.  When I do I will post.

My family loves Chef John's stuffed peppers! I made two changes the first time due to ingredients on hand and have stayed with those changes. I use red peppers instead of green peppers (we like the flavor of red and they've been on sale). Also, for the cheese I mix Mozzarella and Parmesan, we like the mixture. I haven't seen the other type in the extremely rural area we live in, so this works!

I made this one,  and it was good.  I changed some of the ingredients  as I did not have them all and this one was way too large for just one person so I reduced it by half.

Disclaimer: I've never had stuffed peppers before.  However, after having these AMAZING peppers, I'm not sure I'll ever try another recipe.  The sauce was amazing.  The meat mixture was flavorful and not dry at all.  The instructions and prep were easy to follow for a newbie.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!  Only changes I made was brown rice instead of white (it's what I buy in bulk) and I didn't use quite as much cheese.

I'm a vegetarian who cooks for a meat-eating family. I still remember how meat tastes, so, when I looked at this recipe, I thought it would be terrific. Besides, you really can't miss with Chef John. Every recipe I've tried of his has been outstanding. My boyfriend loved this the first time he ate it, but the kids, who are the bigger stuffed pepper fans, didn't. Each time I make it, fewer and fewer people eat it. I honestly don't understand that, but, since I'm not able to try it myself, I need to go with their review.

I made this as directed, except I drained the diced tomatoes before adding to the beef mixture. This was a home run tonight at dinner. I planned ahead and made extra for lunch this week, I need a new lunch plan! These were ahhh-mazing!

These were the best peppers I have ever had!  Used Bob Evan's zesty sausage, 1/2 a roll. Paul Newman's marinara.  I didn't find it time consuming, microwaved the rice.  Cleaning as you go sure helps!  I will most definitely make these again and again.  Made 4 peppers, and have enough mix left to make 4 more in freezer.  Yum!  Thanks once again Chef John.  Always enjoy your recipes.  :-)

Followed the recipe provided, except no pork as I don't eat it and I used different peppers (Red, Yellow, Orange as well as Green).

I really enjoyed the flavour from this recipe, I've since made them again using 50% rice and 50% quinoa and there is almost no difference in the flavour.

Another hit by Chef John!

I have made it twice now. The second time I made twice the stuffing, and put half of it in the freezer for the next time. The flavors are great and it's very filling.

Really really good. I only made six stuffed peppers and used the rest of the filling to make a kind of meatloaf. That was also very good. I would a little more salt to the rice filling, though.

My husband loved it. He stated that this recipe was better than the preboil one that I normally use. It wasn't as watery and tasted like actual bell peppers.  He said that he was sad he could only eat two!

So this was my first attempt to make stuffed bells. I followed the directions  so I could review fairly. It was DYNAMITE! My husband said it was a keeper. I like this recipe because it calls for marinara sauce and not tomato sauce. I've never even eaten  stuffed bells so I really don't have anything to compare it to. My only regret is that I didn't cook this sooner. Chef John these are amazing. Thank you for reading my review.

I added 1/2 tsp salt when cooking the rice. I reduced the salt in the beef mixture to 1/2 tsp. Used 2 cups Classico fire roasted tomato sauce. Only added 1/2 c. parmesan to the beef mixture. I used 94% lean beef, so I added 1 tbsp olive oil to the beef mixture. This makes enough filling for 4 very large peppers or 6 small peppers. I topped the peppers with mozzarella cheese during the last 15-20 mins of baking.

These were absolutely delicious! I have to admit I was hesitant about not browning the meat prior to stuffing the peppers but it turned out beautifully. Except for the sausage I followed the recipe exactly. I used half of the sauce for the bottom of the dish and poured the remaining sauce on top. So glad there was a lot of sauce. A must in my mind with stuffed peppers. Definitely will be making these again! Thank you Chef John.

It makes a LOT!!  Very hearty dish!!  It calls for 4 bell peppers.  I would use large ones or use 6 medium ones.  Also messed up & cooked the hamburger & sausage with the onions etc instead of putting everything in the bowl & then stuffing the peppers & THEN baking every thing  .So, then I  baked them for. 40 mins & then removed  the aluminum foil & baked them uncovered for another  20 mins.  They were really good!! My husband ate two of them!! I could only eat one.  They were really good!!

My husband & I loved this recipe! Chef John is my favorite & I have loved all his recipes. My husband kept saying .. " I can't believe how good this is.. it's even better than my Mom's"! The only change I made was to use  3/4 can of Italian stewed tomatoes without the liquid because I didn't have a can of the 10oz diced tomatoes. I will definitely make this again ??

These are the best stuffed peppers I've ever had.  I followed the recipe as written.  The hot Italian sausage, red pepper flakes and cayenne give it good amount of kick which my faimily loved.  The sauce was delicious.  We will definitely make this again.

Excellent! I made this without the diced tomatoes and added less pepper (we don't like things too spicy).  They were so good and will make over and over again.  Thank you!

Yum. made as is. I did have a little extra beef so used a the full jar of marinara. this recipe made far more than enough for my 5 peppers.  I probably can do that many more and froze my extra filling. the red pepper flakes and cayenne do give it a bite.  delicious.  for the top I used some shredded mozzarella and parm to make it look pretty and add some cheesy goodness to help offset the heat.

I used ground chicken and spicy pepperoni chopped finely.
And cooked for 1 hour covered at 375, then uncovered topped with old cheddar for 20 min at 350.

I don't like rice, so I did not include rice. Instead, I added@ 1/4 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also added basil and oregano. I didn't measure those two spices, just added what I was comfortable with.  I love the fact that the peppers are still crisp, and not soggy. Highly recommend!

I chose to make this because it seemed  more tasty than the typical stuffed peppers.  We loved it!  I will make it next time we have a dinner party.  I made no changes.  Great the way it is.

Used Michael's of Brooklyn Marinara.  1 lb lean ground meat, 5 ounces hot chicken sausage.  Followed the video directions but only used 2 LARGE green peppers cut in half, uncooked (I was raised to parboil them first, but trying without cooking for the longer cook-time WITH a tray underneath and the parchment paper/tinfoil cover).  1 small Success Basmati instant rice bag & left out the vinegar (Michael's sauce is TOO good for vinegar).

Made these exactly according to recipe and came out terrific.  Bell pepper was extremely tender and the cheese was not overpowering.  I give it four stars because they do take a while to make, but they are worth it.

Delish!  I used Minute Rice, and used a can of beef gravy instead of the broth - to die for!  Also substituted red wine vinegar for the balsamic.  I made enough to share with family and they were asking for more!!

A-MAZ-ING!!!! I have made my fair share of stuffed peppers, never from a recipe- always just kind of eye-balled it. I will never do that again. The flavor of these peppers was exactly what I had been trying to achieve. I did use sweet sausage instead of hot as I am cooking for a family with young children. I also used red peppers (I always do, I think green are too bitter). I am eating the scraps off of my daughters plate as I write this! Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow. Only thing I will do differently next time is have a loaf of crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce. Thanks Chef John, you never disappoint!

Another home run for Chef John!  I used yellow and orange peppers.  To go old school, I used a can of tomato soup instead of the marinara.  They were delicious!!

I've always considered stuffed peppers kind of blah, but these are seriously delicious.  I think it's the sauce, garlic and the bit of hot sausage that makes the flavor great.  My family doesn't love green peppers so I used a mix of red, yellow & orange but otherwise followed the ingredients to a tee.  However, to simplify and expedite, I figured if the meat didn't need to be cooked, neither did the onion or sauce, and I think this worked out fine.  After 45 min covered and 25 min uncovered at 350 my meat was still a little pink on the inside so I will cook probably 30 covered and 40 uncovered or a little hotter next time to perfect.  Great recipe, thank you!

I used red, yellow and green peppers.  I also added more rice, sausage etc when I made the stuffing.  I then served the pepper over a small bed of the stuffing and drizzled some of the marinara on top.  This was a great recipe my whole family enjoyed.  I'll be making it again.  :)

Turned out great! I was trying to prep this  before lessons/sports, so that when I got home all I would have to do was throw it in the oven. Because of this, I did not fully read the directions and cooked the meat in a skillet prior to placing it in the peppers. I'm sure it would have turned out even better if I cooked it the way in the recipe. I made mashed potatoes for my kids since I wasn't sure if they would eat it. Not as healthy, but a tasty combination! They loved it!

This is one of my go-to recipes. My husband, mother-in-law, and I all enjoy cooking and serving up great meals to please everyone, including two toddlers, and this one sure is a crowd pleaser. My MIL can be very picky but she can't find any fault with this meal. I usually add a TBS each of dried oregano and basil and we leave out the red pepper flakes and cayenne because the little ones are still too sensitive for anything remotely spicy. This does make a bit too "too much" filling as written, but we cook it up in meatball type shapes in the same pan and serve over rice and with some sauce spooned on top for the kids as leftovers. Thanks Chef John, your recipes are some of my favorite on Allrecipes!

Totally and completely loved the flavor of these peppers--the BEST I've ever made, according to my husband, and I have to agree.  I didn't have any pork on hand so mine were only of the ground beef and I used red peppers like Chef John's video showed.  Also, due to watching the video, I did stuff Whole red peppers without halving them.  OMG, so good.  I'll be making this probably twice a month, at least, due to requests from hubby.  Another fav from Chef John!!

This really is an amazing dish. I make it often. If you really want to kick it up some add some chopped mushrooms to the sauce and pepper stuffing. Saute them with the onions. I top mine with mozzarrella cheese during the last 20 minutes of baking as well. I also double the amount of sauce with these because my family prefers a lot of sauce. One of my kids will not eat peppers. So I also make spaghetti noodles with this and he eats the sauce over the noodles. Fantastic meal for sure!

This was my first time making stuffed green peppers.  This recipe was very easy to follow and the peppers turned out really good.  The only thing is I wished I had bought two or three more peppers.  I had a lot of the mixture left with only four peppers.

This is a great recipe, coming from someone who never makes stuffed bell peppers!  We received a bunch of bell peppers this summer from our CSA and I thought I would try it.  Everyone loved it, including a son who would never touch a green bell pepper.  He ate FOUR!

Great flavors. May need more cooking time than noted to get the peppers nice and soft. I recommend making some extra sauce  to be set aside for leftovers. Also, when the peppers are finished, use your torch to  make your cheesy cap crispy!

The sauce is wonderful, the combination of tomato sauce and beef stock and balsamic vingear makes a delicious gravy.  The peppers were flavorful and I couldn't stop eating them!

I made this with smoked Italian sausage, which was pretty tough - so I diced it finely. I also forgot to add salt to the stuffing, and had way to much of it.

Everything still tasted very good after adding salt on top. The remaining stuffing I fried as burger patties and that was awesome, too. Thanks a ton, Chef John!

I used 1/2 of the red pepper flakes and regular Italian sausage in instead of hot.  We are not a spicy loving family.  Everyone lived them.  Would loved to try to convert this to a soup.  Will be making again.

I cut this recipe in half for two of us.  I was out of rice but I had a mixture of farro and wild rice from the night before, it was great and I think I like the "grainier" texture even better.  I followed the rest of the recipe the same and it was a keeper.  I had not had this recipe in years but I do remember my mother fixing this when I was a child (she's 100 now) so I am sure she learned to fix it from her mother in Croatia where Sweet Peppers are probably the favorite vegetable.

Unbelievable!  This made a person who always hated stuffed green peppers love it.  I would not change one tiny part of the ingredients or directions.  One tip:  do not even think about using a slightly smaller pan to bake.  There is a lot of sauce that can and does spill out, from my clumsy experience.  The "stuffing mix" made enough for 7 green peppers and I put the rest in a small casserole to bake on the side.  Incredible eating experience.  And now I want to cut up one of the leftover peppers to just add to a can of chili with beans.  The leftovers will be very welcome.  I shared a photo of the glory, and thank you so much Chef John.

The stuffed peppers were great! We thought they were so flavorful!  I used orange, yellow , red and green peppers.
The parmigiano is the winning ingredient that puts them over the top. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this for my husband who loves stuffed peppers. Only change I made was I used a mixed brown/wild/red rice and a regular pasta sauce. He said they were great! Next time I am going to use Venison and Pork mix.

Excellent recipe. I used half the marinara in the bottom of the pan and half in the pepper. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and put them in the sauce.  I also browned the meat before combining with the sauce. Best stuffed peppers I've ever made.

I haven't stopped craving these since the day I made them.  They are full of flavour.  The kids loved them.!  I did substitute the hot Italian sausage for bratwurst.  I would recommend  this recipe to my friends and family.!

I used 90 second microwave rice, ground turkey to cut down the fat, added a little Cayenne Pepper instead of red pepper flakes to the meat mixture and also added some to the sauce. This was amazing! with the perfect kick! I had been craving stuffed peppers for a while, thinking about what my mother used to make. This was even better! I will make this again and might add some fennel seed and a small amount of chopped mushrooms, as those are the only things I can think of to make this even better. But even without, this recipe was awesome. I'm so excited I have leftovers :)

I used ground sausage, no beef.  My husband says I need to make this once a week.  My son loved it as well.  I will try it with beef next time just to see if it makes a difference.  It's a winner.

The wife and I both loved it! Only changes that I made were, I added more rice (accidentally made to much) and a little more Italian sausage. I didn't have enough bell peppers from my garden, so I used a couple of poblano peppers also. Will be making this again soon!

My family loved this recipe!  I used 4 bell peppers as directed and had enough extra of the beef and rice mixture to have stuffed at least one more pepper. It was delicious and we will make again as all leftovers were eaten which isn't always the case at our house!

I never thought I like stuffed peppers until I made Chef  John's recipe.  I've made this several times and it's a keeper.  I've turned my friends onto this recipe as well as CJ.  When I'm looking for inspiration, I always check with Chef John first.  He's never let me down.

Personal preference, perhaps, but we just didn't like the combo of flavors here--the sauce itself was good, but really did not care for the Italian sausage and Parmesan. Also, the stuffing amount was immensely overgenerous, we had TONS leftover after stuffing four large peppers.

I made this but I altered a few things, I only used one teaspoon of salt and I added another teaspoon of season salt for flavor. I also doubled the red pepper flakes for more of a kick. I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried, and at the last ten minutes of cooking I added mozzarella cheese on top.  It was so delicious, so flavorful, even my husband who is such a picky eater loved it.

I made this recipe just the way he wrote it. It was delicious and easy to do. I've never been a big fan of stuffed peppers but my mom likes them and I made them for her. I Will definitely make them again and I will double the amount of sauce. I made the peppers standing up on end instead of cut in half and laying flat and they took longer to cook. Next time I'm going to try cutting the peppers in half and laying them on their sides like in the picture.

Delicious!  I used all beef because I don't like sausage and they turned out soooo good and they're easy to make which is a plus.  I agree with another reviewer that there is a bit too much filling, I would just cut back on the rice next time.  I will be making these again!

Very good! I used red/yellow/orange peppers instead of green because of flavor preferences. I omitted the cheese because my sone won't eat that. I used a brown rice/quinoa mix for extra nutrition. Because I started late, I browned the meat first, then stuffed the peppers. I can't wait for lunch time to finish the leftovers!

This was THE best stuffed pepper we have ever had!  I brought a couple of the left overs to work for my boss and coworker and they both said they were phenomenal!  My husband said he has  never tasted a better pepper - EVER!  We will be making these again, REAL soon!  LOVED THEM!

I once made stuffed peppers from a church cookbook that said to put the uncooked rice into the meat mixture and let it bake. Needless to say it was inedible and I was crushed. Afraid to face failure again, I didn't make stuffed peppers for a very long time. But I decided to try this recipe and I'm glad I did. It's easy to do and cutting the peppers sideways is a revelation that I'm embarrassed I never thought of myself. Blame the years of Stouffers ads, I guess. These came out beautifully and got rave reviews. We ate all of the peppers but I think this would freeze well.

Made this vegetarian by subbing veggie broth, portobellos and eggplant. Also used brown rice- very good! I used giant green bell peppers- next time I'll either use smaller ones, or add some diced peppers to the filling, so that each serving has a little more.

Followed recipe exactly. Result was excellent. Did have an abundance of leftover fillings. Next time I will go for two or three more peppers than what's called for.

I love this recipe and so does my family. I make it as directed to a T. BUT!! 3 things to add.  (1) It is perportionate. I cut up 6 peppers to fit the filling, still room in the advised pan for recipe. (2) timing is way off for prep. Allow AT LEAST 1 HOUR MORE  FOR PREP. Three different pans to cook plus cut time of ingredients. (3) this is my personal opinion. I do not use green peppers. Bitter tasting. But very much cheaper on the pocket is why this recipe calls for them from the cook. Go for yellow or orange if you can afford the difference in price. The taste difference is fonominal and you will thank me.

This recipe made the best stuffed peppers I've ever had. Even my husband the picky eater loved them. They were even better the next day. The combination of beef and hot Italian sausage is perfect and the balsamic vinegar adds a nice flavor to the sauce. The only modifications that I made to this recipe were to stuff the peppers whole and divide the sauce (about half on the bottom of the pan and then the other half on top of the peppers). If you stuff whole peppers, you will need to increase cooking time accordingly. Mine took around an hour and 20 minutes but were well worth the wait!

Excellent. I cooked Italian hot sausage earlier in the day and then cut into small pieces for this recipe. I did not use ground beef. I also did not use the cayenne or red pepper flakes as the sausage was hot enough. Nor did I use the beef broth but added a couple tablespoons of the marinara sauce to bring the stuffing all together. And did not use 10oz can tomatoes but one big fresh tomato cut in pieces.  Lastly, I did not use Parmesan but feta instead. Since everything was already cooked I baked it for 30 minutes covered and then 15 minutes uncovered. The peppers (used red and orange, not green) were perfect, not soggy, and not too firm,  but nice and tender. Definitely a great recipe!

Stuffed peppers are one of my favorite comfort foods of all time. Grew up eating my grandmother's recipe which I thought could never be topped, I was wrong. These are the best stuffed peppers I have ever had, the wife agrees, and my two girls devoured them (and they are not fond of bell peppers). Excellent recipe, will make again, and again, and again...

I don't know what it is, but I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It is so tasty! I have followed it "as is" and I have also tried it with a couple of revisions. Let me just say that there are NO revisions necessary. It is just perfect the way it is! I really believe that those who absolutely hated this recipe, must have done something wrong. I really don't see how you could not like it or how it could possibly be too salty. Like many other reviewers said, it is great with green bell peppers, but I also really like it with orange and red, maybe even a little more.  It is also true that this dish is even better the next day. The last time I made it, I cooked it fully, put it in the refrigerator until the following evening after work, and stuck it in the oven to warm it up. It was perfect! I let the parmesan get a little crusty on top and it was devine. I love it! One important thing to remember is the importance of grating your own parmesan cheese. Do not ever use the stuff in the can that we often use in the United States. It is not the same! You must must must must grate your own good quality parmesan. It is worth it. I promise. Mix some of the parmesan into the meat mixture and put more on the top after you stuff the peppers. It is so good! I serve this with homemade garlic mashed potatoes. I thought the rice in the peppers might be too much starch with the mashed potatoes, but it is not. It is perfect and one of my all time favorites.  Thank you for a really good recipe!

Loved this! I used fresh tomatoes, since my garden was full,of them! I boiled water & dropped them in for a few minutes then plunged them in cold water; the skin on the tomatoes slides right off! Chopped them fine then followed the recipe. I made a pan for a family with a new baby & a 16 month old. They loved them too!

I halved the recepe (2 peppers) , it had very good flavor.  Was a little more dry then I preferred, I did not have diced tomatoes, so that could have been part of the problem.  However, I think uncovering the food and letting it cook another 20 minutes could be too much time, especially if the rice and beef are already well done, so carefully taste it and watch it during this time.

We really enjoyed these. I made 2 small changes. Because I did not have marinara sauce, I used spaghetti sauce. And I did not have sausage, so I used some ground chicken in its place. Otherwise followed as directed. They turned out really well. The filling was nice and dense and, with the sauce, this was a very satisfying dinner. Will be making again.

Holy Moly! I don't think I can say anything more. I have always been a big fan of stuffed peppers, but this recipe takes the cake. The yummiest stuffed peppers I have yet to taste. The only changes we made was using chicken stock in place of the beef stock (which I did not have on hand), and we used 20 ounces of diced tomatoes (which was the perfect amount IMO). Heaven in my mouth. Super excited for leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was okay, but I like my regular stuffed pepper recipe much better.  I think the sauce would have been better with about 1/2 the beef stock.  It ended up way too watery.  **My initial rating was a 3, but after heating up the leftovers, I upped my rating to 4 stars.  Maybe the flavors had a chance to meld a little?  I'm not sure, but these are much tastier today than they were last night.

Really good. Next time I would buy 6 peppers. The filling makes too much for 3 peppers. Used Fresh Tomato Marinara Sauce off AR.

I was reading some of the negative reviews and worried how mine would turn out. I made a few small changes but we LOVED IT! Instead of 2 tps of salt I used 1 tps. Instead of marinara sauce I used pasta sauce, which I should have used the whole jar. The sauce was so good after cooking. And I used an italian blend cheese, replacing Parmigiano-Reggiano . Yes, the recipe makes a lot of the meat stuffing. I piled it on top. Overfilling it so I didn't waste the extra. My husband an I  ate them for dinner. He had 2. I had 1, but went back for seconds. It was unbelievably AWESOME!

Absolutely the best stuffed peppers I have had. Sorry mom!  I have made these a bunch of times...I now also add a can of corn and a little less rice,  homage to mom's.

Made it exactly as written. First time ever making stuffed peppers. Very good, but I did not have any marinara sauce on hand so used jarred. Next time I will use a simple marinara from scratch. (I find that most jarred sauces leave a bitter aftertaste.) Family requested to add it to the rotation! Looking forward to making it again.

I had a bunch of green peppers to use up from my garden. This was my first time preparing stuffed peppers, so I am so glad I came across this recipe.  The  sauce was delicious, and the filling made a generous amount in filling six large peppers.

I had several ripe green peppers in my garden and decided to make stuffed peppers.  Although I have never made or eaten stuffed peppers, I thought I'd try something new.  This recipe is absolutely delicious!!  I made it according to the recipe.  The spiciness was a nice surprise and pleasing - and the peppers had a marvelous flavor!  I was concerned that I should blanch the peppers before stuffing them, however, there was no need to add that step as they were very tender!  I did bake for them the entire length of time - the full additional 25 minutes.  My peppers were more of a medium size so I had extra meat mixture that I froze for next time!

This recipe is a keeper!!  I can't wait to make it again when my children are home for the weekend!

This was an awesome recipe! It ended up filling and piling up over the tops of 10 pepper halves, making hearty servings.

We added smoked gouda slices on top of the leftovers stuffed peppers. They microwave really well.

I made these last night for a pretty varied group, taste-wise. Everyone, from the kid who only eats buffalo wings to the friends (he's a picky gourmand; she considers salt & pepper to be "too spicy") absolutely loved them.

Instead of rice we used fresh corn from the cob.

The marinara sauce we used was made from home grown tomatoes.

I used 1 lb of wild boar sausage and did not combine hamburger and sausage. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! I had about half of the mixture left after I stuffed my peppers (I had 5 small instead of 4 large) so I'm going to freeze it, save this recipe and have it again!!

Excellent recipe!  Just a little touch of heat but very good. One half is enough. Enough filling for 5 peppers. My husband doesn't like stuffed peppers, but he loved this one and so did   Will make this again.

I made these tonight and they were delicious. I was lucky and used my garden peppers, my marinara sauce from this site and used some canned stewed diced tomatoes that I had canned. The only thing different from his recipe is that I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan cheese because that's what I had on hand. Good recipe!

I really can't say enough great things about this recipe; it was just wonderful. Even my picky BF, who doesn't usually care for this type of dish, raved. I made it to spec -- didn't change a thing or omit anything. Once it was done, I found it could have used a bit more marinara (I prefer a saucy stuffed pepper) and I felt the need to add an additional dash of salt. This is restaurant-quality stuff right here. Thanks Chef John! Your recipes never disappoint!

Due to allergies i don't use garlic, but this was tasty without it. We used red peppers from the garden and a Mexican cheese blend instead of the Parmesan (store was out of fresh Parm).  Plan on almost two hours to make.  The final has a just a touch of heat.

This was excellent. Husband even said "delicious!"
The only change I made was to add freshly cut corn to the meat mixture. I will definitely make this again.

Husband asked for his garden peppers to be stuffed so I searched for a Chef John recipe.  He raved about the flavors.  I have been pleased with all of the Chef's recipes I have tried but this recipe took a ho hum dish and elevated it to a delicious entree I would serve to guests.  I used sweet sausage since we did not want any heat in the dish.  Yummy!

Probably the best stuffed pepper recipe I have used. I do use diamond crystal kosher salt and found two teaspoons just the right seasoning. Made 7 medium well stuffed peppers!

I've been making various stuffed pepper receipes for over 30 years...this one is the best by far!  My entire family LOVES them.  I've now made them five times and about to make them again.  I double the recipe and freeze half for leftovers.  They are a special occasion recipe.

I didn't want super crunchy peppers so I boiled the peppers for 5 minutes in salted water. I also cooked the beef and sausage before stuffing the peppers. I sprinkled just a bit of mozzarella on the peppers for the last few minutes of cooking (which I shortened considerably since I cooked the meat first.)

I used lean ground beef and mild Italian sausage  because that is what I had on hand.  They were a big hit in this house and will be making it again.

We loved this! Only change I would make next time is less Parmesan, it was just a little too much it was overpowering the other flavors. But delicious regardless!!!

This is the first stuffed pepper recipe I've ever tried-- and it will be the last... because it's THAT good.  My mother said they were the best stuffed peppers she's ever had.

I needed  a basic recipe so that I could used what I had on hand to make my stuffed pepper.  I cook for one so, in order not to throw out to much food, I used the same ingredients for different recipes.  This turned out to be a good choice for me.  I can't wait to "really" try this recipe!

This recipie is absolutely delicious !!! I halved red peppers and also hollowed out zucchini to make stuffed zucchini boats. The meat stuffing does make a lot so I just used my food saver and froze the unused meat stuffing for the next time I make this I have the meat ready to go.  I cooked this covered for 45 min and then uncovered for 45 min I wanted the cheese to get nice and brown.  The peppers and zucchini were still tender firm and delicious.  Thank you Chef John !!

This was real good. The recipe makes more of the stuffing than needed, so don't worry about not enough. I will make it again, maybe for the firehouse.

There was enough stuffing for 5 large peppers.  I used the entire jar of marinara sauce.  I browned the meat with the garlic & drained it before adding it to the other ingredients.  This won raves from the family.

Although it takes a little more work, the payoff is totally worth it: I pre-cooked the meat, then poured off the fat and rinsed with hot then cool water (with disposal running) to get nearly all of the grease off. This means you could use less expensive hamburger and sausage, though I used 85% lean beef and 50% leaner Italian turkey sausage. It still yielded way more fat than I'd like.  
While I was prepping the ingredients I put my sliced peppers in a 400 F oven and pre-cooked them for about 20 mins, turning halfway through. With the peppers softened, I filled them and continued cooking with the foil cover for about 20 mins and finished off under the broiler a few minutes until cheese lightly browned. Turned out great! The only other change I will make next time is to use less beef broth or maybe omit altogether. The sauce was a little on the watery side.
I am delighted that I had some leftover stuffing that will freeze well, because I want to make these again in a month or so, and all I have to do is precook more peppers. 
Thank you, Chef John!!

My adult daughter and I love stuffed peppers but I hadn't made her any in years.  I found this recipe and made them tonight.  She said, " This is AMAZING".  I Agree!  
I didn't have sausage site I just used all hamburger and added some Italian seasoning.  Also, I just cut the tops off the peppers (instead of cutting them in half) and removed the seeds and membranes.  Then  lined them up in my dish and stuffed them.  I love the 'pepper bowls'.

Delicious... I have made stuffed peppers without a recipe many times before.  My boyfriend has very little culinary skills and I needed a recipe for him to follow.  I asked him to make these for me.  They were awesome.  Now months later, he is making them again tonight for dinner! Can't wait!  Yum!

Absolutely fantastic! Made this 3 times now. On the third time, I wanted to cut down on the grains so I substituted riced cauliflower for the rice. No one could tell...Both my kids gobble it up every time!  I always make my own maranara sauce too, never stuff from a jar.

I substituted some left over spaghetti sauce for the marinara sauce and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I fed it to my husband's construction crew and it was gone in a short time. They loved it! I will definitely be making this regularly.

Love Chef John. But the first time I made this the meat was still pink in the middle, which is...you know. So next time I cooked all the meat in a frying pan first, then cooked as directed. Delicious!! This is how always cook them now. And I use 5-minute rice. The only stuffed peppers I'll eat and my teenage son loves them too.

Awesome dish! My husband and son devoured them. I added mozzarella instead of parm on top. For the leftover stuffing, just added some to the pan...put the rest in a little tiny casserole dish and baked it- in the oven with the peppers- for a shorter amount of time. Six stars for this recipe!

Very quick and easy to make. What started as just a quick meal has now turned into a craze by friends and family. Everytime they hear I'm making them, I have to cook for an army.  Would recommend this to anyone.

Amazing! I also tried it using overgrown summer squash from the garden (just scooped out the seeds) and that was fabulous as well.

I believe these were the first stuffed peppers I've made since my senior year of college (~40 yrs. ago) and they were worth the wait! Have never cared much for green peppers, but these were sooo good I ate two for lunch and one for dinner. As others have noted, you end up with an excess of stuffing, but I simply froze it and will use it in spaghetti sauce at a later date.

This was amazing!  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I forgot to buy the diced tomatoes.  I diced some fresh tomatoes and it worked fine.  As others have noted, the recipe make s ton of meat stuffing.  I would suggest buying at least two more green peppers.  Because we had so many, I gave 4 halves to my neighbors before I tasted it...now I wish I hadn't...LOL!  Both my husband and I went back for seconds last night and we each took one to lunch today.

Great recipe! I put all of the parmigiana in the mixture and just used a little more from the bag for the topping.  I also used kosher salt instead of regular.

Again...Amazing!!!

My family loves this. I went to make it the first time and discovered some of my peppers were bad. Not being able to get to the store and already deep into the prep process, I cut up the peppers and did a "deconstructed" stuffed pepper casserole. Used chorizo instead of Italian sausage and dumped it all in a 13x9, topped with Chihuahua and it was prefect. Great in a tortilla!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except that I blanched the peppers for three minutes and followed with an ice bath.  The peppers came out perfectly.  I really liked the flavors, the only thing that i was hoping for was a little more robust and thicker marinara.  Next time, I'll eliminate the broth and add a cup of marinara, for a total of 3 cups.  Also, the stuffing makes like a meat loaf.  If you like a less dense stuffing, pre-cook the meat.  I'll probably do that too.  Frankly, this is good, especially the spices, but it isn't perfect.

This was excellent.  The only change was I cooked the meat first, ( I didn't read the recipe through).  Was still perfect.  I was worried the peppers wouldn't cook and soften enough because I used large thick peppers, but no problem.  This is now my go to stuffed paper recipe.  You won't be disappointed.

I LOVE this recipe!  I followed it to a T with one exception...I used brown rice in place of the white.  Other than that, it is as written.  We loved it and I will most definitely be making this again.  Thank you , Chef John, you never disappoint :-)

Worth the effort.  It is a bit time consuming, but what makes it worth it: the flavor, leftovers and easy to prepare a few hours ahead. 

The sausage made the difference in this recipe.  I always follow the recipe exactly the first time.  The only change I made was cutting the recipe in half.  It was really spicy and  delicious.  My husband absolutely loved it and it wasn't too spicy for him.  I had leftover filling, so I made meatballs with the mixture and cooked them with the peppers.  Almost as good as the stuffed peppers, but just almost.  I made this with green and red peppers.  I personally loved green peppers stuffed, but my husband doesn't.  I pleased everyone.  Thanks Chef John.  I love your recipes.

The flavor was delicious with the addition of sausage but I knew from experience the recipe called for too much rice.  I cut the rice in half and still had to pack filling into 8 huge bell pepper halves to use it all.  I didn't have marinara sauce to I substituted a can of stewed tomatoes.  Also my sausage was very spicy so I omitted the cayenne and red pepper flakes.  I will make this again with my changes.  Thanks Chef John

The only change I made to the recipe was using a jar of pizza sauce in place of the marinara sauce as that is what I had on hand.  This is the best recipe for stuffed peppers I have ever made.  Normally I hate the cooked grocery store peppers but the seasonings seeped through into the peppers and they were awesome.

Thank you!  Very good dish.  I used left over cooked pork loin instead of the ground beef.  I filled about 10 small bell peppers and still had more than a quart of the filling left over, which I froze for a quick meal later.

The best stuffed peppers ever! I was sure I would like them seeing as though this is Chef John's recipe. But, I never imagined that I would enjoy them so much I prepared this meal 2 days in a row. These peppers are absolutely amazing! The only thing I changed, and only because I found I didn't have everything it called for, I substituted Tabasco sauce for the cayenne pepper, and also I used mozzarella cheese. I will definitely make this again in the near future. Thanks Chef John!!!

Rating this 5 stars despite altering it a bit. It turned out very good. I used all beef and less tomatoes in the meat mixture. I did this because I wanted to add a egg to mixture. I knew there would be too much meat to stuff the peppers, and I wanted it to hold together for a few porcupine meatballs to bake along with peppers.

Man! If my mom made stuffed bell peppers like this when I was growing up, I would not have been so hesitant to try this out. I'm glad I did try it, because they're fantastic! I followed the recipe to a tee. There was a lot of the filling, so we had to overstuff the peppers, but that wasn't a big deal.

Excellent!! Made it with ground turkey and mild Italian sausage and brown rice. Four and two year old weren't crazy about it, but hubby and I loved it! It's a great dish to make when you have a little extra time to cook. Will definitely make it again.

We loved this dish !! I had a time line as it needed to be quick.  I had cooked rice leftover, made home marinara sauce (easy) and added a bit of leftover sauce, placed the peppers empty in the oven over the sauce. covered COOKED the beef mixture , mixed the onions and seasonings , added the rice. by the time that was done the peppers were ready. Stuffed the peppers, and baked for half an hour covered, uncovered added the cheese (cheddar ,that what I had on hand)   and bake until cheese browned. ..Boy was it good... Served to people who had never had stuffed peppers.. Easy recipe to  make with spices" you"  like.  GREAT. RECIPE 
Thanks Chef John (:

I don't usually comment but this was delicious! I followed it fairly close. I didn't have sausage all I had was ground pork. It was a little friggy but I broke up each task in the afternoon. I was nervous about the raw meat but it worked out so well. Thanks for the great recipe Chef John.

This recipe is GOLDEN. The flavor from both the meat within the peppers and the sauce will have you going back for seconds. I have a super picky eater for a husband, in terms of not branching out past chicken fingers and spaghetti, and he gave this a try purely based on how marvelous it smelled out of the oven. It got his rare seal of approval but honestly it didn't matter because I love this recipe so much I would make it just for myself if I had to! Thank you Chef!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers and it was delicious! I will definitely make again, the only problem is I live alone and maybe should cut this recipe in half???  Very tasty.

I do not like bell pepper. My husband does. I used yellow peppers which helped. We both loved the filling.

The only downside to this recipe is the time it takes. Best stuffed peppers I've had, and the peppers themselves don't get mushy and gross. The balsamic and sausage are awesome additions. I use ground turkey, and I've made these again and again.

Another superb Chef John creation.  These peppers have a perfect combination of flavors and textures.  I'd say that if you spent two hours making it like Mike diD, you spent way too long and should find another avocation,  DEFINITELY FIVE STARS!

The best Stuffed Pepper Recipe ever!  My husband and family love it.  Did not change a thing other than I used orange peppers.  I'll be making this many times in the future.

I love this recipe and so does my whole family!  Even made it for my brother-in-law who is a chef and he loved it!  If you want to cut down the overall cooking time, I would suggest cooking the beef and sausage in a skillet some first, then combine with the rice and everything else, you won't need to cook in oven as long!

Chef John does not disappoint. My teenaged son and husband love this recipe. Very hearty version of stuffed peppers with a little kick as well. Had some meat stuffing left over but that's not a bad thing.

turn out great!! was first little skeptical because of not par-boiling the green peppers .. I used 1lbs of deer meat and 1/2 lbs sausage from local meat market.. used a garlic infused olive oil to sauté onions,  used regular jar of spaghetti sauce. As other reviewer stated there was  plenty of leftover filling.. I just put that in a freezer bag . put it in the freezer for later use for either  2-3 stuff pepper or stuff pepper soup.. my 5&9 yr old loved it.. Which I was suprised my 9yr old even went for 2nds.. served with spring mix salad.. WONDERFUL as with every chef John recipe.. never fails.. thanks for sharing! again you make me look like a gourmet chef to my family

I have probably made stuffed peppers one time but being that it was a Chef John recipe, I gave it a shot.  These were amazing!! I subbed hot italian turkey sausage for regular sausage, lean sirloin ground beef , and added mushrooms to the onion mix but otherwise ingredients were spot on.  Will definitely make again!

I used Best Marinara Sauce Yet recipe on Allrecipes.com and followed the recipe and video, (which are slightly different).  We absolutely loved these stuffed peppers.  Since it was our first time using this recipe we used four different color of peppers to see if we had a preference.  I only substituted chicken broth because I was out of the beef and it was amazing.  I just do not understand how some people stated there was no flavor.  They may have only followed the video only which Chef John stated was NOT a full recipe as it wasn't completed yet and to check on the website. Thank you Chef John for another amazing recipe/video.

I made this almost to the letter (didn't have any cayenne pepper), and it's SOOOOO good. Takes a bit of work, but it's totally worth it. I ended up having a lot of extra meat/rice stuffing mixture, so I just spread it out in the pan, around the peppers. Once the peppers are eaten, I'm planning to serve the leftover sauce/meat over rigatoni!

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked them at 350 30 min. covered, 30 min. uncovered like another recipe recommend (only because it seemed right to me). These were really good and I will make them again. I stuffed 2 smallish peppers for me and hubby and formed and froze the rest.

It makes enough for about 6-8 peppers, but it is a phenomenal recipe. I added a cup of corn, as well as cheddar cheese for the last 20 mins, but otherwise it's great how it is!!!

I love anything with peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and robust flavors in general. These were great and easy to make. I found yellow, red or orange peppers definitely give this a better taste. Meat can be prepared ahead and part can be frozen and thawed later to cut time on weekdays.

Oh my goodness!!  If I could give this more than five stars, I would!  I always just like stuffed peppers, OK, but these I loved!  I didn't have Italian Sausage, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My marinara sauce was a 24 oz jar, so I made three servings of angel hair pasta mixed with the remaining 8 oz of sauce and served with the peppers.  Thanks for another great recipe!

I used red/orange/yellow peppers and pre-cooked the meat to a beautiful brown (1 Lb sausage, no ground beef). Definitely skip the salt. This is an excellent recipe, and by browning the meat, the oven time is drastically reduced. I even froze some (raw, with the rice/sausage cooked, of course), and it was delicious 2 months later when heated in the oven. Suffered no ill effects from freezing.

Best stuffed pepper recipe I ever made - maybe because it's the only one I've ever made!  Used red, yellow, green, and orange peppers - made a ton of stuffing....more than I needed for 8 half peppers.  Needed to use a lasagne pan as I couldn't get all 8 in a 9x13 pan.  I liked the sauce.  Don't think I changed a thing, but FYI, this is a kitchen trasher!!!  Well done Chef John.

Loved it! The only change was exchanging quinoa for rice.

I love Chef John's recipes and I rarely modify them.  However, this recipe has way too much rice in it.  It made the texture too grainy.   I also feel it needs more flavor from the meat.  Like cut back on the hamburger and add more Italian sausage.  I want to try it again with these modifications.  Definitely double the sauce it's delicious over  creamy chicken rice (Knorr).

All time best stuffed pepper recipe...I made the recipe as is, delicious. Second time however I decreased the amount of liquid and used frozen organic brown rice you pop in the microwave to cook/steam (the kind in a bag). I also cooked the meat in a skillet with the onion and all the items mentioned in step six except the tomatoes. Then I just mixed it all together adding the tomatoes. Much quicker prep and cook times. I do spoon the liquid over the stuffing often once in the oven, it keeps it super moist and the flavor soaks in.

Best ever. I usually leave out the spicy seasonings to keep the happy wife happy. This time I took a risk and followed the recipe to the letter. Sue and all the family loved it. My guess is if you didn't give it 4 or 5 stars you almost followed the recipe. Try again.

I wouldn't say this recipe is 5 stars but it is good. takes a lot of time though. I wasn't a fan of the sausage and would use only ground beef next time. it makes a lot of food though which is good. got 5 peppers out of it.. so 10 halves. has a nice amount of spice to it. warm and comforting on a rainy day like today!

This dish was amazing! This was my first time making stuffed peppers and I was very excited. I halved the recipe. I followed it almost exactly, except I flipped the ground beef to sausage ratio, and I also used ground sausage instead of hot sausage since I didn't have any hot sausage. I also forgot the parsley. I actually had enough to stuff 3 peppers instead of the two I should have had by halving the recipe (I used a combo of red and green bell peppers).

The peppers had a sweet and salty taste to them and were delicious! I think it would be great with hot sausage too, and I'm not a person to have very spicy food.

My husband and I made this together and followed the recipe exactly. We very much liked this dish especially since I have to avoid wheat and the rice was so much better than a pasta ingredient. 
We are going to freeze the remaining ones to enjoy at a later time. Would definitely make this for company.

I thought these were pretty good. I followed the recipe for the most part only making a few changes. For the pork sausage I used Tjs spicy vino formaggio chicken sausage. I also cut the salt and pepper in half and used no salt diced tomatoes. I did a generous tablespoon of dried parsley for the fresh. I also subbed 2 dashes of hot sauce for the red pepper flakes. I lined the baking pan with foil and just mixed the sauce ingredients in that pan. For the baking, I added 10 minutes to the cover and uncovered cook times. For ease, I would probably cook the rice cooker in advance next time. Ty

I loved them. My other half just liked them. He found them "too spicy" which I laughed at since I only used mild sausage. Good stuff though. Had waaaay much leftovers. Guessing I didn't use large enough peppers maybe? Either way, good recipe if you have the time.

Absolutely delicious!!  My entire family (including 3 little ones) devoured these!  I have made them twice now; the second time I made a couple modifications.... I reduced the salt to 1 tsp. and used red, yellow and orange peppers instead of green (just personal preference).  There seemed to be more filling than there was room in the peppers, so I baked the rest of the filling in a small separate dish.  (My 2 year old just likes the filling anyway, so this worked out great for us.)  This will definitely become part of our dinner rotation - it is by far one of my most favorite meals from Allrecipes.  Thank you, Chef John!

Made these a while back when my (then BF) husband said he was craving them. I never ate stuffed peppers much less made them. Found this recipe with all the rave reviews so I tried. He raved about them. Fast forward a couple of years and my FIL was coming for a visit. DH suggested I make him the stuffed peppers, so I did. After his second helping he turned to my husband and said, "Your mom's peppers are good...... But I believe these are better than hers!" That was my proudest moment and the second I knew this recipe was a huge success!

This was delicious.  I was a little unsure about the balsamic in the sauce and the beef broth but I made the recipe as is and it was scrumptious.  My husband loved it.  Thank you for a really great spicy twist on this old recipe.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow! This was delicious and what a generous amount the recipe made. I used organic brown rice instead of white, Rotel Extra Spicy instead of the regular diced canned tomatoes, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the red pepper flakes instead of the 1/4 teaspoon. It was just right, nicely spicy and we loved it! My husband has been telling people about it all day (I cooked it last night).

I thought these very very good as per recipe.  I too had alot of stuffing left over so I added a bunch of marinara sauce to make a bolognase for over pasta the next day.  Made a very tasty spaghetti sauce.

This was very good! I would have liked a little more seasoning in the filling and it was a little on the dry side, but there was so much yummy sauce in the bottom of the pan to spoon over the peppers when serving it made up for it.  Will definitely make again.

This was a great recipe! I changed a few things due to lack of ingredients called for.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of the marinara sauce, cut the cayenne out and cooked the meat before baking. I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried and used the parmesan in the green can. I also added mozzarella cheese on top after coming out of the oven. 
All that said, I followed all of the other directions to a T and it was a hit! My husband went back for two servings and took the rest for lunch. Thank you for the recipe!

I made these and everyone loved them. I made a few changes out of personal preference. I used arborio rice and cooked it in chicken broth instead of water. I used red peppers instead of green because they are way more flavourful, cut the salt in half , doubled up on the sauteed onions, and added one can of condensed cheddar soup. The stuffing mix was enough for 7 peppers, cut in half, so 14 servings. Its a go to recipe in our house. Greetings from Canada

Really REALLY good. I've made this several times. I cleaned it up last time using ground turkey and turkey sausage, omitted the mixed in parm, and used half quinoa/half long grain white rice (in same pan since they cook the same). I also topped with mozzarella instead because I prefer it over parm. This is officially a staple recipe in our house.

5 star+ if I could. Unbelievably good. I made exactly as the recipe calls for. Added a little of the Parmesan cheese after baking 45 min - then back in the oven for 10 minutes. 
I think I would add a little more pepper flakes next time for a little kick. Yuuuuummmmm. My husband and guests said it topped my other good recipe x 3.

This was my first time making stuffed peppers and it was easy and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used half mild italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  I did not cut the amount of sauce in half.   I love meals that once they are put together I can put in the oven and and clean up my mess so that I can enjoy dinner without looking at pots and pans.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe takes simple meal and makes it complicated. The whole process of seasoning the marinara sauce with balsamic vinegar was too much.

Best stuffed pepper recipe ever! I've made dozens and this one is the best. The sauce makes it shine brighter than all the others.

Outrageous! This was excellent, especially the sauce. Husband said it made the "top five" list of his favorite meals.  I used all sausage (hot and regular Italian sausage, removed from casings) instead of ground beef, and sautéed it before mixing with rest of ingredients, and also precooked the peppers a bit in the microwave, but followed recipe otherwise.  Had enough stuffing left over to fill several more peppers (at least another meal for two), froze it to make again soon.  Thank you, Chef John!!

This has been a staple on our menu since I learned to cook. However, this recipe delivered a flavor that reinvigorated our love of the dish, so much so that, by demand, it will find its way into our regular meal plan. I made some "improvements" by substituting canned tomatoes with fresh, using homemade chicken stock instead of water when making the rice, and using my homemade spaghetti sauce in place of the store-bought variety. Superb!

Delicious but prep time was over an hour. Good for a weekend meal not an after work meal. Or prep the day before I would recommend.

This recipe was a big hit in my house. The last time I made stuffed peppers, six years ago and a different recipe of course, my husband said I didn't need to make this again. He ate two and a half peppers and three slices of bread. This dish is great. I did make three small changes. I used elk meat instead of  beef, orange peppers instead of green, and black current balsamic vinegar vs a regular balsamic.

I made the recipe as directed except I added about 1/2 Ragu to the hamburger meat (didn't have sausage) some onion powder, and some Tony Chacherie seasoning. I had a ton of hamburger meat left over after I stuffed 4 whole green peppers, so I just added it to the pan. This is really good--just add in your own special seasonings you like to spice it up a bit.  also had a lot of leftover rice so I used it as a side dish, and added some corn on the cob.

Big fan!!  I promised to bring dinner to my sister-in-law when my brother was home after surgery.  Brought this with a fresh salad.  Stuffed peppers?  They looked entirely underwhelmed.  Later, great kudos - even from my 16-yr-old nephew!  My brother texted, "thank you thank you thank you!"  These are not everyday stuffed peppers.  The filling is incredible, sauce terrific.

These were very good and this is a lot coming from me since stuffed peppers are not my favorite dish.  I did make some changes, however, and I apologize for that but they ended up to be so good that I thought I would share. I did not have any sausage so I did not use that.  I sauteed in olive oil a half onion and two garlic cloves diced until softened.  I mixed 1 pound meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork, and veal) with 1 egg, 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs, some oregano, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper , the onion/garlic sauteed veggie mix, 1/4 cup shredded mozzerella cheese and 1/4 cup cooked brown rice.  I sliced red, orange and yellow peppers in half  (removed seeds) and stuffed with a handful of the meat mixture.  I coated baking dish with a light amount of olive oil and added the peppers and I put the sauce (followed Chef John's sauce recipe) on top of the peppers and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes.  They were YUMMY!  The meat was very moist and tasty .  The peppers were cooked perfectly and the sauce had a slight touch of sweetness.  The others who ate them went back for seconds and raved over them stating, "these are the best stuffed peppers I have ever had, including my moms when I was growing up and I thought hers were the best."

Amazing flavor! Made per the recipe except I didn't have any fresh parsley so used dried. The filling is very generous for 4 peppers so I used six, but I agree that more sauce would be great so will double that part of recipe next time.  Will definitely  make these again next time I'm craving stuffed peppers!

So yummy! My kids love this recipe & even my husband, and he's picky. I leave out the red pepper seeds & just add them to mine on my plate.
Hubby isn't fond of balsamic, so I leave that out. Never any leftovers!

I can't believe how awesome these were. My parents used to make stuffed peppers when I was a kid and they were just awful. Because of this, I found the great reviews for this recipe so shocking that I had to try it. The reviews are well-deserved. The meat mixture is fantastic and actually makes the pepper taste better. You also end up with a lot of the flavorful sauce which is great because I wanted to drown my pepper in it. I used spicy Italian turkey sausage instead of regular and left about a third of a cup of the rice out because the peppers I had were small (so they couldn't hold as much filling). Chef john is just the best.

I made this according to the recipe! I cut the peppers in half through the stem and they looked gourmet! Not only that, but they were the best I have ever made, and I have tried many different recipes! This one is a keeper! Put it in the recipe box!

Oh my God. This is really really good. I cooked the meat by itself and drained the grease. Used 6 peppers. And used a little more cheese.
This was so good I can't wait to make it again.
Oh and I blanched the peppers for 90 seconds before filling them.

This is a new favorite! Great dish with tons of flavor. The only change I made was I cooked the beef and sausage before mixing everything together and stuffing the peppers. I baked the stuffed peppers for 45 minutes covered and additional 10 minutes uncovered. They were perfect!

This recipe is amazing and so so good, I did not use the crushed red pepper flakes, used regular Italian sausage instead of hot and substituted chicken in place of the beef, will most definitely be making this again.

Excellent dish, perfectly tasty. A few changes I made.

Just cut off the tops of the peppers, boiled them for a 3-4 minutes each. 

Only used beef, onions, 3 cloves of garlic,  1 cup of marinara sauce, 1 cup of rice, and some salt and pepper. All cooked in 1 skillet. 

Baked at 350 for 30 mins, added parmiggiano at the end with a little basil on top.

Will make again!!

No Way. The cheese in this just doesn't belong. Perhaps another kind? Yucky as is.

This dish was a great hit last night at the dinner table. I am not a fan of green peppers nor do I like my foods overly spicy. So I added my own touch to this recipe. 
I used ripe peppers, red, yellow and orange. I exchanged hot Italian sausage for sweet Italian sausage. I omitted the cayenne and I made saffron rice instead of white.

I followed the recipe and had extra stuffing after filling 8 bell pepper halves, which I'd rather have too much than too little. Delicious and we really enjoyed it. Will definitely make it again.

I like my food really seasoned & flavorful and usually have 2 adjust seasonings but this recipe didn't disappoint. Measurements are spot on, no changes or tweaking required!  The sauce is AMAZING.  My Hubby is finicky and even he had seconds. Thanks Chef John!!!

I've never rated a recipe on Allrecipes but had to with this one.  Made it exactly as is and used rice leftover from the previous night which made it super easy to make after work. My husband raved about it and said it was even better the next day.  Definitely will be standard meal in our house!

I've been trying different stuffed pepper recipes for a while now, and with this one, I can stop my search.  It was by far the best.  We all loved it, though I made a few minor changes, most just depending on taste.  The biggest one was I cut down on the spicyness - to me, stuffed peppers shouldn't be a spicy dish.  So I used sweet Italian sausage instead of hot, cut out the cayenne, and just 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper.  it still had some spice to it, but not too much.  Also used a little more diced tomatoes, and next time might add 4 oz or so of tomato sauce to give it a little more juiciness.  I used 1/4 cut LESS rice, so it would be a better balance of rice to meat.  And finally, I cut back on the parmesan a bit - thought a whole cup was a bit much, and didn't sprinkle any on top.  It came out very flavorful and will definitely be making it again.

This is the BEST ALLRECIPES DISH I Have made!!! My husband said it 4 times " man this is good... Honey... Wow... What's in this? .... 
I used sea salt and lowered the amount just a tad and ran out of garlic so I only used about 3 tsp but there was SO MUCH FLAVOR. Also I used apple cider vinegar. I don't ever cook with the other so I didn't want to spend the $$ on it  and I didn't use but a cap full.  The sweet sausage came in 5 links so I used 4 for full flavor along with the pound of grand meat, spices and some of the rice. I made 5 bell pepper halves and froze the rest of the filling. The sauce is yummy and the meal was perfect. I will make again.

Delicious! I substituted ground turkey for the beef and used sweet peppers because it's what I had in the kitchen, but they came out amazing. Will definitely make again! I look forward to making more recipes from Chef John's Kitchen!

I can't rave enough about this recipe.  Since my childhood, I have only tolerated stuffed peppers.  My mother made a somewhat bland recipe, most likely straight out of the orange Betty Crocker cookbook.  Given the option, I would probably never choose to eat them again.  But, of course, my daughter loves stuffed peppers and so I will make them for her, occasionally even if I don't enjoy them.  Last night I decided to see if Chef John had a stuffed pepper recipe because I consistently love every recipe I've tried of his.  And as usual, this recipe didn't disappoint.  They were devoured and even eaten as leftovers, which is a miracle in this household.  Thanks, Chef John for always coming through with delicious recipes!!!

Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews first because I love Chef John's recipes. But was confused about the meat sauce. Surely he didn't mean to use it raw with sausage in it. It was so good even though I browned the meat first but definitely won't next time to see if it makes any difference. Loved the addition of the red pepper & cayenne to give it a little zip. Hubby said they were the best he'd ever eaten.

These were, without a doubt, the best stuffed peppers I have ever eaten. I followed the recipe almost exactly - the only changes I made were to add shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the filling during the last 5 minutes of baking, and since I didn't have fresh parsley, I used 1-1/2 Tbsp. parsley flakes. ( I used Paul Newman's Original for the marinara sauce.) The sausage, pepper flakes and cayenne gives the dish the perfect kick. Thanks, Chef John, for another winning recipe!!!

These were a BIG hit I my house! I have made stuffed peppers for years, but these were by far my family's favorite! I made three minor changes... #1 - I did not precook the rice, I just added it uncooked. #2 - I left the peppers whole instead of slicing them in half. #3 - Since I  had so much sauce leftover in the pan, I decided to cook up some pasta and I mixed it with the sauce and then served it as a side dish to the peppers. It was amazing! I already have saved the recipe! Delicious! Thank you!

Wonderful recipe! The only thing we did different, since we were pressed for time, was cook the sausage and ground beef on the stove top first. We used a cast-iron skillet to brown the meats.  Still turned out amazing! Loved it!

This was by far the best recipe. One comment, the recipe doesn't state what to do with the other half of the onions so I added them to the sauce.

For some reason, every time I've made stuffed peppers, I've had an abundunce of "stuffing". The key is omitting some ingredients, most definitely the rice. It's bulky and is not necessary. If you want rice, serve it on the side. I also omitted the sauce and sausage and still had to pack it down. Also, don't worry about putting half of the sauce on the dish under the pepper. It adds nothing and if anything, makes the pepper soggy. Lastly, tear the white pith from inside the pepper and discard. This will give you more space that you will probably need.

I made this over the weekend but excluded the rice since my husband isn't much of a rice eater. These came out beyond delicious. I used turkey Italian sausage with lean hamburger, an entire jar of Prego spaghetti sauce & garlic paste with the rest of the ingredients. It really hit the spot on a very rainy and wind Sunday. The hubby who said he wasn't really hungry at the time seen my plate and went into the kitchen to serve himself one & then went back for seconds. I will definitely be making these again!

These were the best bell peppers I have ever had. I doubled the recipe and added half sausage and half beef. A couple TBS. of Italian seasoning, 12 cloves of garlic. Next time I'm going to add some bacon also. Thanks John!

This was a favorite in our house when I was growing up.  This recipe is a match to mom's.  Great flavor! Thanks for sharing.

Best recipe for this dish I've EVER tasted!  To add a tiny bit of additional flavor, increase the pork to 1/2 pound!

WONDERFUL!!! My husband loves stuffed peppers but was very partial to the 1st recipe I ever made  & skeptical to try a new one. Not so! We had all the ingredients miraculously on hand & it turned out so good! I was nervous about putting so much raw meat into the peppers & expecting them to cook but they were cooked all the way through after the 45 minutes! (I put a thermometer in the middle of the largest one.)

Tried a few stuffed pepper recipes on the internet. This is the best one so far. I like to use yellow, green, orange and red peppers. Cut off the bottoms so they sit up straight and parboil 1st. Didn't have balsamic vinegar so used tarragon vinegar. This was a great Italian twist on the dish. Next time I'll use 6 peppers and ground turkey with the sausage to lighten it up a bit. Loved the sauce too.

Very tasty! I had a lot of stuffing left over though. I think you could easily stuff another pepper or 2 with what I had left.

OMG!!! This is my first time to post a review. My husband asked if I could make stuffed peppers for him. He said his mom use to make them for him all the time. Well....he said these are the BEST he's had. YAY!!! I followed the receipe with only a couple of changes. I used mild itialian sausage and shaved Parmesan cheese as I couldn't find the other at my grocery store.  It was sooo good. I did have quite a bit of meat mixture left over, so I froze it and will use it in the near future. It was a little time consuming, but worth every minute. Love it!

Wonderful!! Only changes I made were to use 1 lb ground venison instead of beef and 0.5 hot Italian sausage. I omitted the cayenne since I added extra hot sausage.

I knew that I liked stuffed bell pepper!  I was just waiting for the right recipe to come along. This is the third stuffed bell pepper recipe I have tried and my husband and I love it.  The sauce is truly what makes this dish.  I did add an extra can of diced tomatoes.  During this recipe I also learned how to soften the bell peppers to create the best texture.   I use to blanch the bell peppers in water.  Instead of blanching, I sprayed oil on a pan and on the bell pepper, heated the oven at 350 and placed the bell peppers cavity down on the pan, put it in the oven for 20 minutes.  Will be making this recipe a lot!

I made this precisely as directed -well, except that I used 3 baby bella mushrooms, chopped, instead of ground beef and added some additional seasoning to the sauce (Penzeys Roasted Garlic and Frozen Pizza Seasoning, mostly because I used plain ol' tomato sauce, not marinara, because it's what I had)- and while I wasn't sure about the sauce at first -just by itself, I thought the beef broth and balsamic vinegar just made it weird- but I was amazed how well it worked with the stuffing and the peppers. Scrumdillyumptious! I loved this for dinner! I did have a ton of stuffing left over though, so I put it in an 8x8" pan, topped with what I had left of some homemade Alfredo sauce and a little mozzarella and baked it up. My husband seemed to prefer that to the peppers. Haha. Either way, good-good stuff. Another winner from Chef John!

My go to recipe for stuffed bell peppers! I use quinoa and ground turkey as a healthier option  and you can't  even tell the difference. The flavor is so savory and the bell pepper adds a nice bitter element.

This was my first stuffed pepper recipe,  it was delicious, but 2nd time i made some tweeks which included no sauce in the bottom of the baking dish, stuffing was lean ground turkey,red onions and garlic, and mild green Chile, then pre-baked the peppers to soften them, then stuffed and topped with cheese! Thank you for this tasty recipe!

These came out amazing.  I didn't have the cheese but I used Monterey Jack and it was still amazing.  Like many others you will need more than 4 bell peppers.  This makes a lot.  Next time I will cut the recipes in half.  Chef John always has great recipes.

Made for company and we all loved it. I used less cheese, and used a jar of pasta sauce for the bottom, leaving out the vinegar.  I googled how much is a #10 can of chopped tomatoes and found it was 1 1/4 cup.

I made this as is except I kept the pepper whole in the oven instead of halving them.  There was too much filling for the four peppers, so I cooked up what was left to eat later.  I loved the spicy kick to this!

So flavorful.... My family loved it. My husband is a chef and I'm usually intimidated when it comes to cooking for him but this recipe by far was the best I've done for him. He loved it.

Very good recipe...the only alterations I made are that I used all ground beef - no pork as I do not like it.  Also, I partially cooked the beef so that it wouldn't be so compacted in the pepper.  It worked out perfectly!  Plus I upped the red pepper and cayenne pepper a little because of not using the sausage.

This is absolutely fantastic.  I didn't use balsamic vinegar since my husband is a celiac and I didn't use the red pepper flake or cayenne pepper.  The filling was great.

LAWWWWD HAVE MERCY.  These stuffed peppers turned out AMAZING!!!  The only difference that I made for my peppers was replacing the long grained rice for brown rice.  I think I'm going to make these again this week.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Fantastic! The filling was so moist and flavorful. The sauce was great too. Instead of 4 green peppers, I used 1 green, 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange. I also backed off just a little bit on the cayenne pepper because my husband doesn't like things too hot. They came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

Ok. These are amazing. Like "go to the store now and make them tonight" amazing. I crave these things like no one's business. And I don't even normally like peppers.

 Tips: 1. Buy 2-3 extra peppers (it makes a lot of filling)  2. Double the sauce. Trust me. It's that good. (plus you'll run out if you don't)  3. Parboil the peppers for about 3 min.- otherwise they'll still be slightly crunchy  4. Use brown rice if you want to make them healthier (you can't even tell)

As stated, make more sauce. I usually freeze half of it. Also, It kinda takes a while to get the feel for how much stuffing you should make. But when I have just had too much, I would make up a burrito, cause there is always someone who is Leary of the pepper.

Great recipe.  Only difference was adding italian seasoning.  But otherwise made as suggested.  I like tomato sauce combo at the bottom of the pan.  Very flavourful.  Thanks Chef John, always love trying out your recipes.  Thanks for posting!

Not going to lie - this took a bit of effort - but oh wow was it worth it!

I split 2 large capsicums - and found I only needed half of the stuffing to fill the 4 halves. Maybe capsicums are bigger in America? **Note. (Day later). I just realized I misread the recipe! More fool me for only using 2 capsicums to begin with! 

Anyway - incredible dish and well worth doing the separate stages of cooking.

I made this for my family last winter and they loved it!! I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did different was par-boil my peppers, which were yellow, red, and orange as well as the green.
If you are skeptical about the balsamic, don't be it just adds a depth of flavor, which to me takes it to the next level.
Served as is because it was a hearty meal.  
The prep is a bit time consuming so do it on a night when you are able to relax and enjoy putting it together.
I will make this again, in fact I was on this site looking for the recipe  again to make later this week. This is really a tasty meal.
Hope your family enjoys this as much as we did. 
 Sidebar: this recipe had my inner FOODIE singing opera after tasting these peppers!!!

The peppers tasted fine.  My husband loved them. But the recipe is poorly written: parts are vague, and other, more obvious parts (like how to make rice) are painfully long and drawn out. I stumbled through it, and it turned out perfectly edible.

These didn't have any special taste and were rather bland. They didn't taste bad but were just lacking flavor.  Also, with this recipe you need way more than 4 peppers! There was so much left over meat that didn't fit in the peppers and didn't have time to grab more peppers. The sauce was pretty good but there wasn't enough of it! I would recommend doubling the sauce to account for the extra peppers needed.

Great recipe. My husband loved it.  I can't imagine how good it will be when I have and use the correct ingredients.  I used chicken broth instead of beef, ground chicken, millet cooked in chicken broth, and crushed tomatoes, and I forgot to add the Parmesan cheese.  I also missed that I was supposed to halve the peppers so cooked chicken with other ingredients for a bit then over stuffed 5 peppers.

The flavour was awesome! The stuffing was enough to fill 8 small - medium size whole peppers.  I used a bigger pan than recommended because the sauce was spilling over the edges.

Absolutely delicious with minor changes 
- use double the amount of bell peppers b/c this is a huge amount of stuffing
- can use all ground beef instead of sausage
- can use water instead of beef broth or omit water entirely because it is very wet
- can use basil instead of parsley (what I had on hand)
- also added mushrooms! This helped add some chewy texture to an otherwise mushy albeit delicious dish
2nd time making it, shortened the cooking time by boiling marinara mixture and adding to raw beef to cook it slightly and then cooked 30 minutes in the oven. Mixture is much wetter so will try to do with only half the mixture next time.  Spoon sauce on top of bell peppers.

Excellent.    One of the best recipes I've ever prepared from this site.    Italian sausage wasn't available to me, used fresh ground pork and spices that would make it somewhat italian.    Cannot brag enough on this.    Cut peppers in half because we prefer them that way.

I didn't have sausage so I just didn't use any. I also used ground turkey instead of beef and I didn't have any balsamic vinegar or beef broth. I substituted the beef broth for chicken broth and it turned out delicious. My husband couldn't stop eating them. Next time I'll be sure to get the biggest peppers I can find. I had extra filling and simply coated the pan with the rice mixture in hopes of not wasting it.

I used 1/2 pound ground beef and 1 sausage link, sushi rice made in rice cooker, water instead of beef broth, marina instead of diced tomatoes, dried parsley instead of fresh.  It was great!  It had some kick to it with the crushed red pepper, cayenne, and spicy sausage.  I had just enough to fill my 4 peppers.  My peppers happened to be red, yellow, and orange.  They looked pretty!

Only change was I used garlic powder and used a cup more of sauce. I didn't want it to dry out and I love more sauce on top . These were the best I've ever had I will be making these again it was a big hit!!!

These were delicious but took me a lot longer than 30 minutes to prep.  I pretty much followed the ingredients but used traditional Italian sausage as opposed to hot since my husband doesn't like spicy food. I did brown the meat before mixing the ingredients so that added a little extra time.  The sauce was super delicious.  Will make again.

Ny father said these were the best stuffed peppers he has ever had in his life (he's 85!).  I followed the recipe exactly except for subbing sweet italian sausage for the hot and red and orange bell peppers for the green.  Absolutely the best stuffing and sauce, and we are looking forward to making this a regular in the supper rotation.

This was amazing I would make it exactly as it was again next time the only thing is that it does make a lot of filling.

Oh - also I only had 1 cup of Marinara Sauce so I used 1 cup of tomato sauce to make up the difference.  I also only had Parmesan in the container and used that instead of freshly grated.  Still totally BOMB!

I love this recipe although I have an important suggestion.. when I make this I only cover the bottom of the baking dish with a little bit of the sauce and then on the second banking time after removing the foil I put the rest of the sauce in the over to bake. Otherwise the suave gets extremely greasy and you can't spoon it over at the end. I posted a picture to show how much grease there is. I also drain the peppers on a paper towel before serving!

This is good.  A little too much sauce and grease but very tasty.  I did some with rice and some without and both were excellent.

Turned out great!  This my first attempt at stuffed peppers.  I used Jambalaya rice instead of white, topped it with Monterey Jack cheese,  and left or the cayenne and red pepper flakes. I also cooked the meat before stuffing  the peppers. My kids even liked it! :)

I made this a few days ago and I love this recipe! I really loved the flavor of the sauce. The filling made enough to make double the peppers. I got the largest my grocer had which was more medium in my opinion.  I didn't have the fresh herbs so I used dried Italian seasoning. My family enjoyed them.  Thanks Chef John!!! This one will stay in the rotation.

These are awesome peppers! I was looking for something a little more sophisticated than Campbell's soup, and Chef John never lets me down! Sure, they are a little work, but well worth it! Make your own marinara sauce as well. You can't get better peppers than these!

AMAZING!!!  I made this recipe exactly as prescribed, omitting the balsalmic (only because I didn't have any on hand...) and it was delicious!
My man will eat anything I put in front of him, but this dish actually elicited a request to put this into the regular dinner rotation, so I knew it had to be good!  Goodbye boring spaghetti night, hello stuffed peppers!  He even asked for the leftovers to go into his work lunch the next day, and said they were better the next day after being reheated!
Because the ingredients are so similar to the Bacon Mushroom Swiss Meatloaf recipe, I prepped that at the same time, and stuck it in the freezer for a busy/lazy night...  review on the meatloaf--pending!
TOTAL WIN!

This was my first try at stuffed peppers. My husband absolutely loved them. I left out the parsley and guessed on the measurements except on the meat and rice. I had tons of extra stuffing so I cooked it in another dish next to the peppers. The sauce that you cook it in is the best. Definitely a keeper. Oh and it was cooked exactly as stated in recipe.

Loved this recipe!  Used fresh tomatoes on hand, didn't have marinara sauce or canned tomatoes.  Had mild Italian sausage only and it was very delicious!  Will make it for next dinner party at our home.  Will try this mix in stuffed cabbage next time. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Chef John!

Wouldn't change a thing.  I had extra stuffing and went out and bought more peppers.  Next time I will freeze for the next time I make them.  Wonderful flavor.

Taste was good but I felt it was too salty. It calls for two teaspoons of salt and you already get sodium from the sausage, cheese, and marinara sauce. I served two of them to my husband and he didn't go back for more.  After eating it all I wanted was water. If I were to make it again I would omit the salt but honestly I just might take it off my intended rotation.

This recipe was delicious! I have made stuff peppers before, and my fiance thought they were just okau, but he couldn't get enough of this one! It was a late night when I made this, so I changed up the cooking directions to speed up the process. I added the seasonings and cooked the meat in a pan, then drained the excess grease. I then added about 3/4 of the sauce mixture to the meat, and a little bit of plain marinara to thicken it up. Also boiled the peppers for about 5 min to soften them. II stuffed the peppers with the meat/rice/sauce mixture and topped with cheese, then baked for about 20 min. They were still absolutely delicious and cut the cooking time in half!

This is an excellent recipe! I have made it three times and the only thing I've done differently is adding the same amount of sausage as I do the ground beef. It is, by no mean, lacking, we like a more sausage-y flavor.

Great, delicious recipe! I have been looking for a good stuffed peppers recipe for a while, and this is it. Only change I made was to use leftover brown rice, around 1 1/2 cups, I prepared for dinner the night before. Great recipe to have as leftovers as well when heated in the oven!!

My husband and family loved this recipe! I used ground turkey instead. I also cooked the turkey and sausage before stuffing the peppers. This way I didn't have to bake them as long. I can't wait to make this again!

Delicious!  I did partially cook the meat before before making the meat mixture to get as much fat off as I could. Otherwise, followed the recipe... so, so good!  Thanks, Chef John!

These were delicious.  I took a little liberty with the recipe since I made a double batch.  I par boiled 6 halved multi coloredeppers for about five minutes to make two pans of six halves each.  The filling as written filled all 12 halves.  I did add onion powders, garlic powder, basil and oregano to the mix with plenty of back pepper and salt.  Made the sauce for two pans using a 24 oz jar of marinara, an 8 oz can of sauce, and broth, etc. ingredients as made...a definite do over!

This recipe was very good, but extremely time consuming.  I made using ground turkey.  The tops got a little hard because I left them in the oven too long (because I fell asleep while they were cooking).  I will definitely make again.

The only thing I did different was I used instant rice because I didn't have the other that day.  But this is amazing we loved it great flavor.  Next time I am going to double the sauce we like a lot of sauce.

These really are delicious! My whole family enjoyed them. I followed the recipe except I had no balsamic on hand so did a tablespoon of red wine vinegar with a teaspoon of sugar added to it. I also had to bake mine about 12 minutes longer, but I stuffed mine pretty full so that's probably why. Also, I used regular sausage and omitted most of the red pepper/cayenne, only adding a small pinch, because my kids reject any spicyness outright (I have a 3 year old). Still tons of flavor and will replace my old traditional B.Crocker recipe!! Even had some leftover to freeze for another day!

I mainly followed the recipe w a few changes. One main change added a delicious twist. Instead of having the marinara on the bottom I the pan I ended up doing something different. I had some home made Katalina dressing left over from a previous recipe. In a skillet I added about a cup of chicken stock, cup of Katalina dressing, 3 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons fresh basil, 1 tbsp of fresh oregano, 1tbsp of pepper flakes, and pepper to taste. I heated it up on the stove until it was reduced to a thicker consistency. In stead of placing it on the bottom of the pan, I scooped 2 tbsp on the top of each stuffed pepper w the cheese. Delicious sweet and spicy twist !

Just came across this recipe, made it, and have to say these were the best stuffed peppers I've ever made.  Didn't change a thing.  Used homemade marinara sauce.

This was amazing,  a lot of work but worth it. I had a little too much grd beef and sausage but it all worked out in the end. It definitely had some "heat" to it but I really liked it. My hubby says it is a keeper. Lots of flavor, smells wonderful cooking. Took longer than 45 min. covered as my peppers were large and had a lot of meat in it but once I smelled the peppers, I knew they were cooked through and I used spaghetti sauce, not tomato sauce. I may have to add more sauce to the leftover peppers tomorrow but that is ok. They'll still be good. Chef says marinara sauce and then states tomato sauce. He also says add 1 cup of cheese to the meat mixture but how much to put on the peppers before putting into the oven? I just added all the cheese to the meat mixture. I can sprinkle more cheese on later.

I love stuffed peppers, but this is the best I've ever had.  I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground Italian sausage.  I did not put the cayenne pepper because the red pepper flakes and Rotel made it spicy enough.  This will be a regular!

This recipe is awesome, it tweaked a few things that I did when making stuffed peppers.  One MAJOR thing though:  like all stuffed peppers, these taste MUCH better if you cook them for a longer time, on lower heat. At 45 minutes on 375, like the recipe calls for, they will be cooked but have no flavor.  A crock pot works great!

This is a delicious way to make stuffed peppers!  The main change I made was that I only used half of the rice that it called for otherwise it might have just been a little meat with a lot of rice.  Also, I used the left over beef broth (making just 1 cup wasn't convenient), to cook the rice in and it gave it a nice flavor.

This is absolutely, hands-down, the BEST stuffed peppers recipe EVER.  I didn't have marinara sauce, so I made my own using tomatoes from my garden and the "Fresh Tomato Marinara Sauce" recipe from this site (which I must say is also 5-star.  Thank you Chef John for another favorite recipe!

This was, without a doubt, the best stuffed pepper recipe I have ever made or tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change a thing.  I plan to use the filling and sauce for stuffed cabbage as well.   Thanks to Chef  John for this recipe.  I will be using it often.

DH said Five Solid Stars! He absolutely loved these stuffed peppers remarking they were the best he'd ever had. I was blessed to have lovely Sweet Red Peppers in my garden for this recipe. Used venison sausage and venison burger. Followed the recipe without changes besides using the venison. The texture was great and the flavors spot on. I surely recommend this recipes. Thanks Chef John

This was excellent. I replaced the red pepper flakes with fresh jalapeno. One jalapeno wasn't enough, next time I will use two.

Loved the combination of seasonings in this recipe. I did modify to make this healthier & they were AMAZING. 

Used 2 lbs of ground chuck & no pork.
Used brown rice
Cooked the beef and drained the grease before mixing with other items.
Used red peppers, cut in half, dropped in boiling water for 5 minutes, drained & then stuffed.

The flavors are mildly spicy. These are the best flavored stuffed peppers I've ever cooked.

Will definitely cook again.

Best stuffed pepper recipe I have ever had! I never post but this is worthy! I made my own marinara sauce. I also used a little full fat mozzarella in place of some of the Parmesan Reggiano because I ran out. It was wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

I've always enjoyed stuffed peppers, but my kids, not so much. I decided to try these as the sauce base was a little different than my standard recipe. The flavor is amazing!  This is definitely my new go-to recipe for stuffed peppers!!

Made this recipe for the first time tonight. These are fantastic. I will definitely be making these again. I've already printed the recipe and added to my cookbook! 
I halved the recipe for just my husband, 4 y/o, and myself.  Next time I may make the full recipe and freeze half as they take nearly 2 hours to make.

Loved this recipe.  My husband isn't a big fan of stuffed peppers but loved this recipe.  I didn't have sausage on hand, so I used all ground beef.  Also, didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used a fresh tomato.   For the sauce, I used my homemade pasta sauce.  They turned out fantastic and can't wait to have the leftovers.  Would be great with a side of pasta.  Will be using this recipe in the future.

Made almost exactly to recipe- added a little more sausage. Delicious! Lots of filling leftover- froze it for another small dinner soon. Wasn't disappointed with this recipe at all.

Delicious!  I made it with a little extra sauce that I spooned over the top for the last 20 minutes of baking.  I missed the step of adding the cheese with the meat mixture and only added on top, it was still fantastic.  This will be a family favorite!

I made this recipe with the ingredients I had on hand, so used brown rice, ground turkey, omitted parsley, and had the cheese optional. 
The red peppers and cayenne pepper called for by the recipe made me think it would make it too spicy, but it wasn't the case at all. There was double the filling for the bell peppers called for (I think 7 bellpeppers at least to use up all the filling), and you would need a bigger pan than a 9x13 to fit everything. I baked the extra filling in a separate pan. For dinner, I served these in bowls and topped it with the tomato sauce and put cheese on top. TIP: I pre-made the filling earlier in the day so assembly was quick when it came time to bake.

I goofed up and browned the meats on the stove prior.  It still turned out okay and I didn't have to worry about the meat being completely cooked.  I wanted the peppers to be completely soft, so even though the meat was already cooked, I left this dish in the oven the full length of time.  I used five peppers and still had some filling left over.  We liked this and even though Chef John's recipes always have a lot of steps and use a lot of dishes, I'll make again.  I think I'll cook the meat prior next time too.

The best stuffed peppers ever- make these. I did use sweet sausage because my younger kids would not be able handle hot sausage. It sill came out beyond delicious. I doubled the recipe to freeze the mixture for peppers next week.

I had every intention of making stuffed peppers but the last thing I felt like doing was running to the store to buy the peppers, so I made a gorgeous gravy instead. Cooked the onions in the olive oil, adding the fresh minced garlic during the last minute or two. Scraped that skillet clean and cooked up the ground beef in it. Drained the beef, added a 24-oz. jar of Rao's Homemade marinara and the rest of the ingredients. For the sausage I used two long grillers (what are these called? Longer than a hot dog, like what you might get on a long roll with peppers and onions). I had these already cooked from the day before so I sliced each one in half lengthwise, then sliced each half into thirds lengthwise, then crosswise to make a small dice. Next time I'll try using ground Italian sausage and will cook it with the beef. I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes (undrained) because I didn't have regular. I had a beef broth liquid concentrate so I dissolved 2 tsp. in a cup of water and added that...and then I added an extra quick squirt of the concentrate. I also doubled the balsamic. No salt or black pepper, but I did use the cayenne and the red pepper flakes as instructed. I covered the pot and let it simmer for an hour to cook down a little. Used this gravy on top of spaghetti squash and topped with Parmesan and the parsley that I forgot to add to the sauce. You've done it again, John! I'll be making this again and again, and I know that the stuffed peppers will also be phenomenal!

This recipe was AWESOME! I was on the hunt for something quick and easy - didn't have a taste for anything in particular and came across this recipe. This is the 3rd recipe I've made from Chef John and my family was very pleased with it. The only mistake that I made which I think was a good one...was that I accidentally added the diced tomatoes into the skillet with the cooked onions and balsamic vinegar - instead of adding the marinara sauce. I let them simmer for a bit and then took them out with a slotted spoon and then correctly added them to the bowl with the ground beef, sausage, etc. WOW! I think the flavor from the balsamic vinegar, beef broth, etc. was AMAZING inside of the stuffed peppers. Obviously - you don't have to make the same mistake that I did but they turned out great and were full of flavor!

I thought this was to die for!  I followed the recipe pretty closely and it was amazing!  I did use mozzarella cheese for the topping instead of parmesan because I ran out.  I used a 10 oz can of Rotel with green chiles and used 1 Tablespoon dried parsley instead of fresh.  So yummy!

I've made these several times now, and the whole family loves them.  Fresh italian parsley is a must, don't cheat with the dried stuff.  These also make great leftovers because they almost taste better after sitting in the fridge for a day or two.  Thanks, Chef John!

These stuffed peppers were the absolute best! Flavor was unbelievable! The only change I made was that I replaced the ground beef with extra lean ground turkey. 
Chef John, you are fantabulous!

This was my first attempt at stuffed bell peppers in quite a while.  I vaguely recall earlier efforts as not being terribly successful.  Still, I bought some beautiful bell peppers and needed a dinner recipe that would feature them.  I tried Chef John's version of stuffed bell peppers, and they were a HUGE hit!  I modified the recipe slightly based on what I had in the cupboard.  I used red and yellow bell peppers rather than green.  I didn't have Italian sausage on hand, so I used 1.3 lbs of ground beef.  To give them a spicy kick, I substituted a can of Rotel for the diced tomatoes, and a small can of chopped green chiles for the Italian parsley.  I didn't have finely grated cheese on hand, but I did have a shredded four cheese blend, so I used that instead.  They were so good, I had one for breakfast and we are looking forward to leftovers tonight!  This recipe will definitely become a frequent favorite for my household!

I have made these several times and will never make stuffed peppers any other way. I shared them at work and people want to buy them. Chef John is one of the best.

OMG AMAZING!!!!! I have always been one to hate bell peppers just never really liked them. I could cook with them in things but the thought of eating this much just as the pepper itself made me never want to try it. This is now my new favorite dish. The flavors were amazing. it was a huge hit with the family. Will also be using this as a recipe for spaghetti sauce as well.

Made for the first time tonight.  The only change I made was dried parsley since I didn't have fresh. My husband said they were the best stuffed peppers he has ever eaten. I'm not a big fan of stuffed peppers but I thought these were fantastic!  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. Will definitely be making these again and again.

Chef John has another winner!  I used sweet Italian sausage instead of the hot and cut back on the black pepper to reduce but not eliminate the bite.  The sweet sausage added a very positive flavor element.  The cooking time (45 min + 25 min) was on the nose. The whole family liked it.

Asked my husband what was his favorite dish. He said stuffed peppers. I had never made them before so I turned to Allrecipes and found chef John's. I followed the recipe except I used a bit more crushed red peppers (my husband loves spicy foods). He LOVED them they are now his favorite out of his favorites ?? . When I make them for the kids I will have to omit the heat.

Tried this recipe and I loved it! The flavours were really good and blended well. I didn't have the onion so I sub'd some onion powder into the sauce and it was yummy. I don't like onions much anyways, but that's beside the point. I only had 3 large peppers so I halved them and used only about half of the recipe and froze the other half for a later date. Great recipe!

This was so amazingly delicious.  My husband, who never eats leftovers, requested we eat this for lunch tomorrow.  They're the best stuffed peppers I've ever tasted.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes (we have a toddler and I was concerned about heat), and used red wine instead of beef broth (which necessitated a pinch of brown sugar to even out the sourness).  I also threw some shredded mozzarella on the top with the Parmesan.  I can't wait to make this for company.

Wow!! the title to this recipe should be: "Not just another stuffed pepper dish"  I added cherry tomatoes at the begging of the recipe to the half onion on the pan and think it was an amazing addition. This recipe is just an amazing combination of ingredients made perfectly. 

Thanks Chef!!!

This is by far the best stuffed pepper recipe I've ever tasted.  I made it last night for dinner and I am eating it again right now for lunch!  I am the only one in my family who will eat stuffed peppers so I hadn't made them for a long time. I had a craving for them, so I searched for a new recipe.  This is a keeper that will go into my recipe box and I will definately be making more often!  The fam can go to McDonalds!

I made this recipe tonight and it was a big hit.  Normally when I make stuffed peppers I brown the meat before mixing it with the rice.  This way seems so much better.  The filling turned out juicy and I loved the flavor of the sauce.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 pound of ground turkey instead of Italian sausage and ground beef because no one in my family likes sausage.  Also, I used whatever leftover rice I had in the fridge, it was probably about 1.5 cups cooked.  Also, I had half a jar of marinara and so I used plain canned tomato sauce for the rest and a beef bouillon cube plus 1 cup of water for the beef broth.  I had enough filling to make 5 generously stuffed peppers (I cut the tops off to stuff them instead of cutting them in half).

These were the best stuffed peppers we have made.  There was so much flavor in the sauce in this recipe.  I feel like many of the stuffed pepper recipes we have tried before were rather bland. Not this one. Would highly recommend.

Love this recipe. I like a little more spice so I used Rotel instead of regular diced tomatoes.

I just don't know to change my screw up.

This is my first recipe review on any site. I had to debate a little on  whether to rate this a 4 star or a 3 star. In the end I decided to go with the 4 stars because it still was an amazing new take on an old fashion dish that can be a little boring. It was better than the normal, that's for sure.

PERSONAL OPINION: 
The sauce was too greasy for my liking which I explain below.  

The reason I almost went with the 3 stars is because when I've made this dish in the past,   the sauce was mixed in with the hamburger mix and and then stuffed into the pepper. This allowed me the opportunity to drain the excessive oil and fat from the hamburger. In this recipe because it says to pour it into the baking dish, the fat from the meat drains into the sauce. While I know this adds to the flavor of the sauce, it makes for a very heavy and greasy dish.

CHANGES FOR THE NEXT ATTEMPT:

What I will do next time (and what I recommend for anyone here who wants a lighter dish) is prepare the sauce IN step 4 as usual and after letting it cook for a minute,  in step 5, I'll  instead just set it off to the side rather than pouring it into the baking  dish. This way I can still drain the grease after 45 minutes. Then in step 8, I'll  pour the sauce in and let it cook for the last 25 min. I can't imagine it will alter the taste at all but please correct me if I am wrong. A pound of hamburger and 1/4th pound of italian sausa

Thank you Chef John!

These are delicious!  I have made them 2x in the last month. Added 14.5oz can of diced tomatos to the sauce; used a 14.5oz can in the meat mixture instead of 10oz.

 Added both pinch of cayenne pepper & 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper to the meat. Still added 1/4 teaspoon crushed pepper to the sauce.

 Used 6 red peppers cut in half.  

Used vegetable broth in place of beef broth

well it was good but i kinda strayed from the actual recipe. i cut out the pork sausage and just stuck to the lean ground beef and also used chicken broth instead of beef broth. i added corn and chopped celery to my beef mixture and then sprinkled in Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper in place of red pepper flakes and paprika. great recipe.

So I made this exactly how it was written.  Was really good!  The only thing I may change is adding more of the spicy aspects.  More red pepper and more cayenne pepper.

I used this recipe to stuff yellow and orange peppers, I didn't have any green peppers on hand.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and skipped the pork sausage completely.  The filling mixture was very generous, I was able to stuff two small peppers with plenty stuffing left over. I took the suggestion of another reviewer, Tastebuddy, and used the leftover stuffing to stuff cabbage.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating, but, I think I need to make a couple of changes. We found the filling and sauce to be excellent. My store did not have the hot Italian sausage, nor the fresh Italian parsley available. I bought mild Italian sausage. We both thought the recipe was zingy enough. I substituted dried parsley, instead. Also, we thought the peppers were not cooked quite enough. Next time I will parboil them. All in all, a very good recipe.

Best stuffed peppers I have ever made!!! My husband couldn't get enough of them. Instead of just using the green bell peppers, I used one of every color to try the difference in taste. I liked the orange one best my husband liked the red best. All were fantastic though.

Excellent recipe. I used turkey meat instead of beef, and it still turned out great. If you want to season more, do so. It's worth it

Loved these! Yes, they're labor intensive and take up a lot of dishes but I absolutely love this recipe.  I use ground chicken or ground turkey when I make them to cut down the calories, and I think that allows the spiciness from the hot sausage to shine as well as the cayenne and crushed red pepper flakes. I've made these for both my family and friends and everyone left happy and full.  I recently made them for my "chicken-a-tarian" friend and even without the sausage she loved them, so there are a lot of alternatives you could use while making these to increase/decrease the heat and to make them healthier.

By far, my favorite recipe on this site. The presentation is fabulous, the taste even better. I think the italian sausage is what makes this recipe so good. I like to slightly higher ratio of sausage to ground beef. But honestly, this recipe does not need to be tweaked at all.

One of my all time favorite recipe's! I make it exactly as written, no tweets necessary. Just the right amount of spice, and especially like the pinch of ground cayenne pepper. Delicious!!

I didn't read the directions and browned the meat first and it still turned out fine.  I didn't have cayenne so I use Sriracha sauce.  Very good!

Really good with a few alterations! I used orzo rather than rice. I also used brat meat. Another recipe recommended using Campbell's tomato soup as the base so I used 1 cup tomato sauce and 1 can tomato soup. I also added a little basil to the sauce. Make sure to add some of the sauce to the peppers.

Excellent! I love cheese, so I added more parm than called for, and I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top before baking to add a little texture. Will make again -- maybe as a loaf next time instead of stuffing a pepper.

great recipe! I used beautiful extra large green peppers and the amount of filling was just right, if I had to use smaller peppers I would make more to avoid overfilling. Only other tweak I made was to use brown rice instead of white. Wonderful savory flavor.

My husband loved this recipe.  I thought it was just OK.  I roasted my peppers (cut sides down) in a 375 degree oven while the rice cooked to make them more tender.  I liked the combination of Italian sausage and ground meat, however if I make these again, I think I will use sweet Italian sausage to make the flavor a little milder.

Because I had a few bell peppers in the fridge, I decided I wanted to make stuffed peppers. My fiance told me he wasn't a big fan of those things but absolutely loved this one. Both he and I had seconds. Yummm. So simple and so delicious! Thank you!

I haven't made stuffed peppers in years... Completely forgot how to make them and am so happy I did!! These are amazing, they truly make you look like a super star! My boyfriend couldn't get over the homemade, old school taste of these stuffed peppers. I am so glad I decided to try this recipe! Highly recommended!

Love this recipe! Actually all of Chef John's recipes that I've tried I love.
The only thing I do differently is omit the sausage & add 1 tsp of fennel & 1/2 tsp of sage (recommended by another review) & use organic ground turkey.
Oh, & I use organic chicken broth instead of beef. :)

This is more satisfying than any stuffed pepper I have ever made. I used brown rice instead of white and it was absolutely delicious. In the future, I will cut salt amount in half. My husband and I do not like a heavy salt flavor. I will also try this filling in stuffed cabbage.

Very good!  This recipe is a bit time consuming but worth the effort and the wait.  For the amateurs, make sure you wash, cut, chop and gather all of your ingredients before you begin. It will make things go much smoother.  I'm not usually a fan of changing recipes on the first try but this one seemed easy enough to adjust.  I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for another time.  I used the leftover beef broth in place of some of the water to cook the rice.  We're trying to eat healthier so I used brown rice instead of white and turkey in place of the beef.  Even with the adjustments, this was a super delicious meal.

I really like these stuffed peppers but they take a long time to prep and cook so be sure you leave yourself over two hours.  I found receipe needed more diced tomatoes, I used double the amount, try with seasoned crushed tomatoes very popular in grocery now. Use sweet sausage if you don't like the heat. I usually cut top off of pepper instead of halfing to give a bigger serving.

Reminds me of my nana's! Wonderful. I just omitted the cayenne & red pepper flakes, & parboiled the peppers for 5 minutes before stuffing & only had to bake 1/2 hour.  Did not use sausage either. Thank you!

best stuffed peppers ive had! i actually hate stuffed peppers, because the ones my mom made all the time when we were young were bland and she always used green bell peppers. 
my changes :
1 pound hot chicken sausage (no need for 2 diff meats)
red bell peppers
brown rice
thats it. sooo freaken tasty!!! 
this makes a lot of filling! i froze the leftover filling.

These were phenomenal! I misread the ingredients and used 2lbs of sausage... So needless to say I wound up with enough stuffing mix for 7-8 whole peppers. Since I only bought 5 (and the pan only fits 5), the rest of the meat mix I turned into sausage patties (~10 of them) which I've been eating for a quick breakfast. So good! Additionally, just one of these stuffed peppers fills you up for lunch.

Great go-to recipe for weeknight dinners.  Takes a little more time to prepare, but well worth it.  One time I forgot the parmesean so I improvised with other cheese.  Not great, DO NOT forget the parmesan!

My husband and I loved these!  They were too spicy for my kids, so next time I'll use sweet Italian sausage and still add the pepper flakes.  This recipe is definitely my new go-to recipe for stuffed peppers.  To mix it up, I plan to make these again with bread stuffing instead of the rice.

I never made stuffed peppers but this turned out pretty good with a few modifications:  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so that was omitted;  if you watch the YouTube video of this recipe, the chef uses spaghetti sauce.  I added a couple of teaspoons of sugar to the sauce in the pan.  I felt the sauce was too bland without it.

I've made this a couple of times now. I add a ton more balsamic vinegar to add some tang, but that is the only change. I usually make the night before and refrigerate. Because they're cold, I cook at 375 for an hour and five minutes, then uncover and cook for 15 more. They come out perfect!

Fantastic!  I made a healthier version substituting quinoa for rice (cook according to package), and turkey Italian sausage for pork!  I've never made stuffed peppers before, but I'm making this again! Great, great, great recipe!  Thank you!

This recipe is excellent. Husband loved it. Thought it was a little spicy BUT I doubled the hot pepper flakes...my fault. My husband said I can make this any time. I did use equal amount of hot sausage and beef. Also, The tomato based sauce is so useful for other recipes. I used it for a base recipe for vegetables with rice. This is recipe is so good. Chef John's recipes as a whole are very good. I always look for recipes of his.

I cooked the meat with the onions, mixed homemade sauce is with the meat, along with all other ingredients, cooked it all together In a skillet.. Stuffed the peppers with the concoction, topped with cheese. Baked in a dish.  Way too much filling for 4 bell peppers, so I froze the remainder for next time. Yum!

Absolutely outstanding!!!  Best stuffed peppers I have had.  They took a bit to make, but well worth it!!

I poured the sauce from the pan over the peppers upon serving.  I think this made them even better!

The technique and texture for this recipe was WOW perfect.  The seasoning for me was off. It as a mix of tex mex and Italian.  Next time I will make it without the cayenne and use a mozzarella/ provolone mix on top.  Might even try it with sweet Italian sausage! Don't not make this just think about preferred seasoning!

UPDATE:
I've updated the rating to 5 stars after making a few changes.  I added chopped chicken liver and stuffed peppadew peppers instead.  Everyone loved them and the small peppers had just enough kick.  I also added some left over spicy, bloody mary mix minus the alcohol.

The recipe is great!  I only gave it 4 stars because I don't particularly care for bell peppers but my family gave it a 5.  It was filling and the stuffing makes very generous helpings.

Perfection!  I make my own tomato sauce (bypassing the beef broth part of the recipe here) in the blender with fresh tomatoes, apple cider vinegar, oregano, basil, red pepper, onion and garlic and then just pour that all over the stuffed peppers.  Brown the sausage a bit before putting it in the stuffing, this makes the flavors pop (I use hot sausage).  I also use plenty of shredded Italian cheese to top the peppers, but I don't put that on until the last 10 minutes.  Great as leftovers or frozen.  Love this recipe so much; I have probably made it at least 10 times :)

Delicious! I gave this a vegetarian twist and subbed veggie ground round and veggie chorizo sausage for the meat in this recipe. I reduced the baking time by 15 mins (since veggie meat doesn't need to be cooked) and it came out perfectly.

I used wild rice with these and canned vodka sauce drizzled over the top - baked at 405 so that it wouldn't take quite as long, and they turned out great! I loved how the wild rice gave the stuffing a little texture.

I'm a huge fan of stuffed bell peppers and this recipe was quick to put together and super yummy.  My husband was very happy to have them prepared the "granny's way" (his words) instead of submerged and stewed the way I usually prepare them.  I prepared as written except I subbed red  wine vinaigrette because I didn't have the vinegar.

The only add-on I do is sometimes put a thin slice of swiss on top so that the kids like it better, but it really is perfect without the added cheese.   One note - do not ramp up the feta.  I thought it would be good with a little more one time and it just over-took the dish.  Stick to the recipe and you're good.

WOW! I am not normally a fan of stuffed peppers but these were AMAZING! We made these because my husband loves stuffed peppers and I thought these sounded like a recipe I could enjoy, too. My husband made them and followed the recipe exactly (we used pecorino romano which does make a difference), and even as a novice cook he found the recipe very easy to follow. He felt like a gourmet chef after following your recipe and listening to me rave about how delicious it was. Thanks, definitely making these again!

Fabulous!!! I have made stuffed peppers thousands of times thousands of ways! But this is now my favorite! The only thing I did differently is I omitted the diced tomatoes because I thought that would be over kill. And I was right! My husband who loves my grandmother's old recipe actually loved this one the BEST!!!

Stuffed bell peppers is one of my favorite foods ever.  I always use the whole pepper and cook them in the slow cooker so I did that with this recipe as well.  I did everything else exactly the same and they were great, but not my favorite.  I like them to have more of a Latin flavor I guess. This Italian flavor threw me off.

Great recipe!!  I had enough filling to make 6 stuffed peppers. I had Amazing left overs for lunch the next day. I followed the recipe almost to a tee except I only used ground turkey and spiced up the meat a little with oregano and Italian seasoning.

Well, Chef John, you have done the impossible! I have been cooking for my husband for six years. In all that time, his comments about the meals have ranged from "nothing wrong with it" to "it's fine". I made your stuffed peppers even though I myself can't eat them (food intolerance) and I was sure it was going to be another lackluster response from him once he tried the dish. For the first time, E-v-e-r, he said, and I directly quote ... "Excellent!" He even said it with enthusiasm, something never heard before. Wow. O.O

These peppers are fan-f'in-tastic!! I use ground turkey, removed the casing from Italian turkey sausage, and chicken broth. We don't eat red meat or pork, so this was a great alternative. The flavors were wonderful! I could pull my chair up to a table and not be shame to drink the sauce right from the pan! Sauce was AUH-MAZING!! 

Thanks!!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers and they got rave reviews.  I used ground turkey, hot turkey sausage, dried parsley and red/yellow/orange peppers instead of green.  The recipe does have a bit of punch that we enjoyed, but I feel like it has a lot of flexibility to add, remove or modify as needed.  Next time I'll use brown rice as an even healthier option.

This is by far the best stuffed pepper recipe I've ever tried! Even my picky 9 year old loved it! The ONLY change I made was to add a tablespoon of brown sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity. Wonderful!!

I love these stuffed peppers. I am eating one as I write this. I did make a few alterations because of what I had handy and they still turned out great. Made this for my lunches at work this week. My coworkers will be so jealous. No cafeteria food for this gal this week.

This rivals my moms and thats saying something ! Spectacular although I must say I like it with the red and yellow pepper more than the green peppers. Its also MUCH better the next day. Double the sauce though and DONT wimp out on the pepper flakes and spicy sausage, Its not a spicy dish, dont worry

I never really liked stuffed peppers but I sure am converted now. My husband and I LOVED this recipe and the sauce is awesome delish. Two minor changes which didn't alter this wonderful recipe. I didn't have time to bother cooking rice so I used orzo. We also don't eat green peppers too bitter and like the orange, yellow and red for color and sweeter flavor. Thank you Chef John

This is the best stuffed pepper recipe I have ever tried! They are so delicious. I made some adjustments to the recipe to make it more low calorie. I used ground turkey instead of beef and sausage and I substituted chicken broth for the beef broth. They were incredible. I will definitely be making these for many years. Thank you. I have tried many, many stuffed pepper recipes and this is by far the best ever!!

This was yummy although I did not cook the peppers long enough to allow them to soften. I could not cover them entirely with the foil during the first 45 minutes as I was out of foil! I believe this kept them hard but...they were very tasty. They taste even better the next day and we enjoyed these a couple of times. I recommend them and will make again.

Prepared these peppers as written and loved every mouthful.  I wouldn't change a thing, best stuffed peppers I've ever had.  I would note that the meat/rice mixture was enough for probably 10-12 medium/medium-small stuffed peppers.  I liked it in the smaller peppers as it gave a better pepper to stuffing ratio.  I froze the extra mixture for another time.  I'm already looking forward to it :)

Really liked the recipe. If you like spice I would add more crushed red pepper. Really liked the sauce from pan over the peppers? I based over them as they cooked. I would double the sauce to serve over the finished dish.

I never thought I'd like stuffed peppers, I've never made them before, but when Chef John posts, people listen.  Only because it was a CJ recipe, I went out on a limb and made them for the first time to accompany my ham & turkey Christmas dinner!  I have total faith in you John.  
I wasn't disappointed and neither were any of my guests.  They wanted more!  I could have made everyone two halves each, that's how good they were.  The other hit was Chef John's Sweet Potato Casserole.  YUM!  I love Chef John!

After reading  A LOT of reviews, I thought this was going to be one of the best things we ever tasted. I was wrong. It wasn't anything special and kind of on the bland side. The "sauce" was the consistency of water and had no flavor. Nobody had seconds or wanted the leftovers (and there was a lot), so it was a waste. I'll use this cooking method again, because I was looking for one that didn't require browning the meat first, but I'll do something different with the meat mixture, and definitely completely change the sauce.

Very tasty!  I made the recipe vegetarian by substituting ground round instead of beef.  My only complaint is it was super salty.  Next time I will use salt-free tomatoes and tomato sauce.  Other then that...delicious!

Yum! I used red bell peppers, instant brown rice, sweet Italian sausage (not hot), dried parsley and some extra Cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes (because that's what I had on hand) and it came out great! I cut the sauce and meat recipe in half and used it to stuff two big bell peppers. I didn't have parmesan, either, so I just added some white cheese on the top for the last 20 minutes. 

The sauce is great and we drizzled it over the top of the peppers before eating. I was a bit skeptical because it looked a bit time consuming for a Monday night, but this one is a keeper!

omg was this the BEST stuffed peppers ever.  I used all ground beef as I didn't have the sausage and used cheddar cheese on top as the kids used all the parm.  I used 4 1/2 peppers as that is all that would fit into the 9*15 dish.  So 9 halves.  It depends on the size of your peppers but the filling was perfect and the perfect amount.  Thank you so much.

i have made this plenty of times everyone loves it the only changes I made was to use orange peppers instead of green, I also used jasmine rice instead of long grain rice. I also triple the sauce and use the left over sauce as a sausage pasta sauce base, makes an amazing sauce thanks chef john.

We didn't have any sausage for this recipe but it was still great without it. 2 peppers per person + a french baguette was surprisingly filling!

Just made these peppers for my husband who is not a fan of stuffed peppers.  Since it's vegetable season, we are overrun with peppers.  These are by far the best I have ever eaten (my husband went back for seconds and is planning them for lunch the next day). Only changed ground pork for sausage since that's what I had in the house.  Would definitely make them again.

I used fresh cajun pork sausage instead of the ground beef and Italian sausge, but I'm in southwest Louisiana and had that available to me. I also boiled the bell pepper for about 5 minutes before stuffing them. This was amazingly delicious.

I did not have any sausage. So, I left it out. This recipe is totally off the hook!!! It is the best stuffed pepper that I have ever eaten. If you don't think so......you did something wrong.

I followed directions exact.  I never ate these before although I do remember my grandmother making stuffed peppers...so I have nothing to compare the taste to...but these were very tasty.  My husband and 13 year old really liked them.  We will be making these again!

Granted, I used fresh green peppers I had just picked out of my garden,  but I have to say there's were the best stuffed peppers I have ever eaten, no matter who made them.  My husband who can be pretty picky, shoveled it right down.  Followed the directions exactly.  They were great!

The best stuffed peppers I've ever had!  Absolutely amazing!  The recipe as shown makes enough stuffing for 8 whole bell peppers, easily.  I just cropped the tops off and cleaned them out.  No cutting the peppers in half and doubling them, so you'll need 8 whole bell peppers for this, not 4 cut in half.

Chef John did it again. Another 5-star winner! Family loved it. I did put mozzarella cheese on the top, which made a lovely presentation. I could not find finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, so substituted Parmesan cheese instead. Next time I cook it (already getting requests after 3 days - lol), I am going to use ground turkey and quinoa! Great recipe to double batch and freeze for another meal!

I loved these green peppers. My six year old even loved them. I served them with additional white rice mixed with the sauce and peppers. I added about a cup of mozzerella cheese to the top of the peppers and melted in the oven for the last five minutes. I also used soy sauce because I love soy sauce with rice and stuffed green peppers.

I doubled the recipe to freeze some of these and was very glad that I did. I substituted ground turkey for hamburger, mild sausage for hot and I used the boxed tomato and roasted pepper soup that Aldi's sells instead of tomato sauce (I ran out and didn't know until it was too late). I did double the sauce as some other reviews said and had quite a bit leftover but better too much than not enough. This was fantastic.

This is my second time trying this recipe and it is amazing! I followed exactly as written and it does not disappoint. The filling is definitely extra, so you can stuff more peppers than the amount called for, but it is so good that it's worth getting more green peppers. Thanks Chef John!

AMAZING!! That's it. I did omit some things I didn't have in my pantry, but they were fabulous! I had some leftovers and cut the peppers into bite sized pieces and had soup the next day. It was just as good that way! Oh yeah, I did sprinkle some shredded cheese on top- we're dairy farmers, it's just not a meal without cheese :)

Very good recipe though I did make changes....
*Used Ragu thick n chunky. 
*Used basmati rice was on hand (next time won't cook will let it cook in juices)
*Used extra cayenne..and red pepper flakes.
*used an Italian mix of cheese fontina parm mozzarella provolone romano ,asiago.
*rotel tomatoes with grn chiles.
*added the remaining cheese last and bumped up cooking time....I kept dousing the mixture with the sauce in the pan....
DELICIOUS!

I made this for my parents tonight as a "thank you" for letting us stay with them until our new apartment is repaired.  Since I'm a vegetarian, I substituted the beef broth with vegetable broth, beef with Quorn Grounds, and the Italian sausage with Lightlife Italian Sausage.  I didn't change anything else and it turned out absolutely fantastic!  My dad was apprehensive at first, but after trying it exclaimed, "My god! This is actually REALLY good!  Wow!  I really like this!  I was skeptical, but wow.  I am in shock.  This is good!"  

This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

I was looking for a new twist on stuffed peppers and THIS IS IT! They look and taste amazing- I think it is the vingegar in the tomato sauce. I grabbed a hint from another site and rubbed the peppers with olive oil and broiled them for 10 minutes- Perfection :)

This recipe is fabulous!!  I have made them twice and the whole family loved them especially my son who never eats anything!  The sauce is delicious!  Next time I will double the sauce recipe so I have extra because it doesn't make much.

Seriously, Chef John you rock!  I had extra peppers this week and was thinking about what I could do to "get rid of them".  Now hubby wants me to make sure I make this more often...  I guess I'll have to overstock on peppers more often.  I made it to recipe (1st time to see wha to change- turns out nothing needs changing) and it was dee-lish!

Best stuffed peppers ever!

It is a lot of prep work, but boy it's worth it!

This was delicious! I didn't have any sausage, so I just used all beef. It was still very good! I will definitely be making this again.

Great meal.  I used both red and green peppers - and had some left over filling - so be sure you buy large peppers - but I will definitely make this again.

Yum!  This is so, so good!  The only things I did differently were to use brown rice and omit the red pepper flakes and cayenne since I cook for little ones.  Such a great recipe.
