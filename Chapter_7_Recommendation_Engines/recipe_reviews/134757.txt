Hi! I'm the submitter of this recipe. Just wanted to say that I only add 1 cup or 1 1/2 cups of water. After cooking the onions, garlic,..etc, add the clams and stir to mix all the ingredients together, then add the water/flour mixture and stir constantly until the sauce thickens. If you desire a lighter version, then add more cooking water (personally, i like it pretty thick). I always strain and freeze the remaining cooking water, so i can use it later in my stews, soups, etc...). Hope you like it!!

This is an excellent recipe, and I realy enjoyed last night (as a tapa dish). One modification: I do not add too much water to the pan to steam the clams, only a thin layer of water to prevent from burning the bottom of the clams. The clams will start loosing liquid very quickly, and this will be enough to make a rich sauce. If you need more liquid, then add it after adding the thickener- this way you wll never go wrong with the amount of liquid in the sauce! Thank you for the recipe!

Fabulous flavor!  The only problem I had was that the sauce didn't really thicken.  I think I may have used too much water when I boiled the clams, and I put all of that water into the sauce.  Next time I will use less water to boil the clams.  However . . . I did save the broth in the freezer for when I make a chowder.  Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

i found it easier to do step #2 first, then add the water and boil the clams -making it a one pan meal.

Delicious and delicate flavour. This is my favourite type of recipe, simple and elegant. My boyfriend and I enjoyed this with a fresh loaf of crusty bread and bottle of white wine. Clams are relatively expensive here so I had to substitute 1/2 of them with shrimp, it was still very good.

I did make one little change. I used bottled
clam broth instead
of water. WOW this was 
excellent ! I'll make this again and again.

I enjoyed this recipe.  Definitely start with step # 2 as AmazonTo Andes suggested and just barely cover the bottom of a tall pot with water as Patty suggested, the clams will release plenty of liquid as they cook. I  reserved some of the cooking liquid to add the flour to, I didn't want to dilute the taste with water. I can't get cherrystone clams where I live so I subbed littlenecks. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
