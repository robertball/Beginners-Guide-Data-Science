These are so easy yet so good. I just finished a batch, I made a few alterations, I doubled the recipe, added a 1/4 cup butter to the batter(i LOVE butter :]) I let them rise for about 15 minutes(this made them more fluffy), I didn't fold them in half, I made them like biscuits and beat and egg white and 4 tablespoons of butter together and brushed them on top. They came out awesome I will definatly be making these again.

The fact that these are called "rolls" is misleading. They are in fact biscuits. The flavor was okay but they were not nice enough to serve with our Easter dinner. We ended up making something different.

These "rolls" did not rise.  Although they did have a good flavor, these are definitely not yeast rolls, they are biscuts.

My husband loved these.  No-they aren't a true yeast roll, but we found them to be lighter than a biscuit too.  I did allow the rolls to sit in a warm spot for about an hour before baking, and they rose a little.  Maybe that's what made them so fluffy.  Skipped the butter inside, but did brush them with melted butter when they came out.  I will make these often instead of biscuits.

Oh my. This is fabulous. Im not sure what was done to make some people think these taste like biscuits....but they are melt in your mouth yummy! I cut them thicker and didnt add any butter till they were done then just brushed some over the tops... we will be eating these often!! Fast and easy! (and I subbed milk/vinegar for the buttermilk, too).

My husband really liked these. He said it was like the best of both the yeast roll and the biscuit.  I liked the ease too.  Will definitely be making this again.

These are definitely more biscuit like than yeast rolls but they were still good.  The dough was quite easy to work with and not very sticky so they could just be patted out with little extra flour.  They were too sweet though so next time I'll reduce the sugar to 3 Tbsp, and also probably skip folding them over with butter in the center and just brush the tops with a little melted butter instead.

As others have said, these are biscuits, not rolls.  I couldn't get them to rise at all, which may have been more an issue with my cooking than the recipe, though I don't generally have trouble getting recipes to rise.  Will not make again.

I rate these a 4 only because they aren't really yeast rolls.  What they are, are delicious soft fluffy biscuits.  This is the recipe I will be using to make biscuits from now on.  I used the dough to make pizza pockets and they were awesome.  I think the yeast addition just helps make them soft and fluffy.

This is a winner!  I'm giving this recipe five stars because it's so easy, so quick, and tastes as good as if if I had spent all morning making them!  These will be the rolls I'm serving for Thanksgiving dinner.

I made these tonight to go with pasta and added a bit of garlic powder to the mix. I did allow them to set for a bit but they did not rise measurably. Even though they are still a very good biscuit. They are tender and with the added butter flavorful. They won't make it to my regular rotation but when in a pinch for time I can see making them again. I too added the butter to the mix and then brushed with a bit more melted butter when they came out.

I gave it one star for sounding good.  My husband took one bite and I tossed the entire pan of rolls in the trash.  I make OUTSTANDING buttermilk biscuits, but my husband also likes a dinner roll and like so many people have said these were so much like biscuits but not by a long-shot even close to anything resembling anything good.  My yeast was bubbly and good and everything should have worked out fine, but ewwwwww.  Not good eats.

These should not be called "rolls".  They are biscuits.  There was no flavor and they seemed a bit like eating hockey pucks.

I don't understand why the dough wouldn't rise.  It's basically a pizza dough (if you take it easy on the sugar)   After trying to get the dough to rise in a warm spot for 30mins, I knew I would end up with flat biscuits.  I rolled all the dough out at once, folded it in half 2x and baked them.  They were the hit of the evening. Next time, I would put the butter tabs in between layers of dough since the butter melted right off and stunk up the kitchen.

They came out like biscuits and tasted too "flour-y".
