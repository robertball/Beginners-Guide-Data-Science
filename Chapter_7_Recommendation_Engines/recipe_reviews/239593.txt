I added 6 oz if chocolate and  made the raspberry glaze. It was delicious.  I wrapped the pan in foil and put it in a baking pan with hot water around it. It did not crack at the top. Everyone loved it.

This recipe does not have chocolate, despite the name. I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (melted in the microwave) and added the melted chocolate to the cream cheese and sugar mixture, prior to beating in the eggs. It added a nice extra flavor. I also found the cooling in the refrigerator only took 3 hours instead of 4. I put the raspberry sauce around the edges and down the sides right before serving instead of directly on top, and I lined the top edge with whole fresh raspberries. Overall, very tasty!
