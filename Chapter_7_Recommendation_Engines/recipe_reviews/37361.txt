Great sauce w/ berries!  However, I think it would be better to eliminate thickener (flour) and use evaporated milk to achieve creamy consistency.

This is a hit every time i serve it!  It has become my fall back when i need a fancy dessert.  I recommend garnishing it with fresh mint.    
It is particularly good over cakes.

This is a WONDERFUL summer dessert recipe!  Our dinner club loved it.  Very rich, yet light enough to serve after the heaviest meal.

It wasn't fluffy enough.  And it was a little too strong on the vanilla flavor.
I like another fruit dip a lot better.

Disgusting.  Basically, it's egg yolks smeared over your fruit.

This is great!! I made this as a part of a romantic dinner for my wife. I was a bit nervous since it was my first time making this particular recipe, but we were both pleasantly surprised at how flavourful it is. I will certainly make it again.
