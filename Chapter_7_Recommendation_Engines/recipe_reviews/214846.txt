I halved this recipe and was disappointed with the thickness of the bars. I also thought that these were just ok, not really the cheesecake flavor I was seeking. The recipe was saved for me because I used crushed homemade pnut butter cookies for the crust and after tasting the mediocre filling, I topped it with strawberry jam and fresh whipped cream.

3 days later and I'm STILL getting people RAVING about these - no joke. I accidentally deleted the photos I took, but I chose to swirl the homemade caramel sauce into the bars. This resulted in some minor "cracking" at the edges from the caramel swirls but what it did for the flavor certainly made up for it! I chose to use all cracker crumbs instead of pecans. These were very substantial--a thicker than normal cheesecake portion--which made for an even prettier bar! YUM! Crowd-pleaser!

I only had three boxes of regular cream cheese, so I added 8oz of honey nut cream cheese to substitute.  It worked great!  They came out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

-I doubled the amount of butter because 1/4 cup wasn't enough to make the crust.
-Used Splenda instead of sugar
-Used 4 packages of cream cheese, but the only ones I could find were 229 grams instead of 250 grams.
-Didn't use any foil because we were out.

I really liked these, and my friends and coworkers loved them. The graham cracker crust wasn't at all sweet, but the cheesecake was plenty sweet on its own. It had a nice creamy, decently light texture, which I think is important for cheesecake. No heavy Cheesecake Factory tuff here. I did think that the Splenda made things a little overly sweet, so I'd probably just do regular sugar next time.

This was my first attempt at homemade cheesecake I was a little afraid to try it but after reading the reviews I decided to go for it and am glad I did.  
I baked mine 15 min longer than called for and it came out perfect.
Bunco girls could not get enough of it.  My Mom did not care for it but she likes things that are sweet which this cake is not.  It is perfect melt in your mouth subtle rich.

This is really delicious!  I thought it was really hard to serve/cut off of the foil.  I think I would either use parchment paper or nothing the next time I make it.  But it is really good!
