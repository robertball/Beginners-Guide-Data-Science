I typically don't like fish, but this is a recipe I'll make again.  I thought it was a good, very easy, basic recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp. sea salt and 1/2 tsp. fresh cracked black pepper to the marinade.  Then I put the fish in a Ziploc bag, poured in the marinade, and shook gently to coat.  The marinade had a good flavor, but wasn't overpowering, which I liked.  Watch the cooking time--be sure that you get the center of the fish to at least 145 degrees.  We had our gas grill preheated to medium heat and it took us about 8 minutes per side.

This is one of the best ways of preparing halibut I have ever tried. I only marinated for
an hour as the marinade really tenderizes the fish. My family raved about it!

I consider this a 'safe' recipe.  No raves, no boos.  If I make this again, I will use salt.  This recipe lacks zest.  I am not sure what spices it needs, but it needs something to liven it up.

Salmon and Orange Roughy can be used in place of Halibut.

Mango Salsa is excellent with this.

This was just ok for me.  I was really surprised, because I love grilled fish and I love lime juice and herbs.  It was the first time I've made halibut at home, and I think I will stick with salmon.

As-is, the recipe could be bland, as others have mentioned, since it has no salt and pepper. Unless you're on a very restricted diet, do yourself a favor and add a bit of each to taste. Halibut is a very light fish anyway so benefits greatly from a little seasoning. (To paraphrase Emeril LaGasse: "You have to season the fish, because it won't season itself.") You can even use a bit of seafood seasoning such as Chef Paul's (yummy stuff). Another minor variation I've enjoyed: reduce the oregano and thyme by half, and add 1/4 tsp. dill.  Finally, it doesn't need a long marinate time; I use 30 min and it's great (with the adjustments above).

We changed it up alittle bit. Let the halibut stay in lime juice for 5-6 hours total. Also I just put in my herb garden...we live in California so fresh is the way to go on herbs! Big difference. Loved it with a nice Chardonnay from Napa. Keeper for sure!

It was pretty good.  I think I overcooked it though.  I did it in the broiler for 10 minutes (1 inch thick fish) 5 minutes on each side.  Next time I will do it on the grill.  The flavors were okay, nothing spectacular.  I served with mango salsa which I love on its own anyway.  Served with scalloped yellow squash.

This was the first time I ever tried to grill this fish. It was outstanding. My husband and mother-in-law loved it as well and they prefer battered fish.This is a keeper of a recipe!I did have to change it a little. I used lemon juice instead of lime and added 1\2 tsp of minced garlic. YUM

This was definately edible, but not great.  My husband and I agree that the sage/thyme/rosemary mix isn't for this fish.  That's more of a pork thing.  Next time garlic and lemon, like usual.

A keeper!!  I used my george foreman grill and i used whole bone in fish my husband had caught.  we didn't care for it with catfish, but it was superb with the spot tail.  I grilled the fish with sliced limes on top.  next time i will add soemthing for a bit more kick.

Great recipe!  Couldn't grill so I used a cast iron skillet and used foil on top to steam it all around.  Didn't have too much time to marinate, but it still turned out great.  Will definately make this again.

did not care for the rosemary combination with the other thyme basil and oregano. just not my taste buds. made a jalapeno peach sauce and a berry chiplote sauce to drizzle over fish. that was awsome.

WOW! I am super-restricted on carbs, so halibut is a wonderfood for me.  This recipe was awesome - sweet, tender halibut in no time at all!  Didn't use anything but the marinade (no salsas) and still loved it.  I plan to put this one into heavy rotation at our house!

Turned out wonderfully, though I did make some changes.

I was pressed for time, so I cut the halibut into "nuggets" and cooked them in the marinade - I didn't have time for marinating.  Also, I used a pound of fresh Alaskan halibut and didn't measure the ingredients - just judged to taste - and a little extra lime juice made the halibut really tender and really sweet.  

Thanks!

I prepared the recipe as written and both my husband and I liked it.  We both thought that the variety of herbs slightly overpowered this delicate, delicious fish .  I'll make this again but will probably season it less or try different herbs.
