I useed 6 apples, sliced. When apples and sauce were cooked, I removeed apples and cook down the sauce to thicken it. Brush sauce onto the rolled out crust and then completely cover with apples. Sprinkled a tsp of sugar across the apples and also sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice. Then layed  the lattice. Brushed lattice with remaining sauce. Then bakeed. When finished baking I filledl in lattice with remaining sauce and let it dry. Drizzled the cinnamon sugar glaze on top and let dry. delicious.

Good stuff! I cheated and used pre-made pie filling. They were still yummy. If cutting straight strips is a problem, try using a popsicle stick as a guide.

Not very tasty. Recommend serving on the day of baking otherwise they get kind of soggy.

Followed the recipe to the T. Tastes amazing but very time consuming.
