We liked this sandwich but because spinach by its nature is so bland, I sauteed sliced garlic in the oil before I wilted the spinach in it and I used a couple of slices of provolone cheese instead of the cream cheese. Also, don't be afraid to salt the spinach because it needs it.

Quick meal idea! Used regular brick cream cheese, about 3/4.  Added 2x the spinach because it cooks down. Buttered the bread and toasted in frying pan. Delicious! Great leftovers though the mixture does solidfy, making it harder to spread. Will add more salt to taste next time.
