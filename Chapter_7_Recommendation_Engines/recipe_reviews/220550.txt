Yep, it's simple, just what I was looking for.  Also, it's best not to ruin fresh tuna with too many strong flavours hiding it.  Tasty and the husband really liked it - he's not really a fish fan.  I didn't use nearly the amount of dressing that was called for as it's unnecessary.  A couple tablespoons underneath the steaks in a flat pie plate and a tablespoon poured over the top of each and gently rubbed onto the edges too does fine.  We didn't have anything to oil our grill with so used a grill basket (greased with a paper towel with EVOO on it). I also like Tuna a la Veracruzana, another easy option.

I marinated the tuna steaks overnight and they literally "melted in your mouth". Good thing I made twice as many as I thought I needed because everyone wanted another!
