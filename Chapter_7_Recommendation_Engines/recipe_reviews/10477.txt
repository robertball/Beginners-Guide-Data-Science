Wonderful recipe! The only thing I did different was, I found Andes baking pieces in the store so I mixed 2 cups of them up with the dough and skipped the "frosting" portion. They are so yummy...I plan to give them as Christmas gifts.

I have actually been making these cookies for a couple of years after recieving them in a cookie exchange. They are very good. One recomendation...use Andes Mint Parfit mints rather that the Creme de Menthe mints, the light green color makes for a prettier cookie. All you do is press the mint into the cookie once they have cooled just sligthly - you do not have to spread.

One more recomendation I wanted to add (cant belive I forgot) I add 1/4 tsp. of mint extract right after the eggs.

This cookie is SO good! I followed the recipe exactly and had perfect puffed cookies. I think the people that had a problem with flat cookies was that when they melted the butter and sugar, they OVER melted. I actually did mine in the microwave. I did it for 1 min. with the butter, sugar and water and then just wisked until all the butter was melted. Then added the chips, microwaved for 1 more min. and then used a wisk to stir the chips until they were all melted. The batter at that point it still pretty thick, not thin like it would be if everything was much to hot. Make sure to let it cool well! Also, when I chilled the dough, I put it in a rectangular pan and put it in the fridge. Let it cool all the way through! I promise, your cookies won't be flat!
I WILL make this recipe over and over! My kids and husband ate them all up!

This makes a great cookie! The only problem is waiting to let the Mints melt then letting them cool To where the chocolate hardens on top so you can stack them.  To help this along I put then in the fridge for 8 min. Then put a layer of wax paper in between them!!!

This is one of those stand alone cookies where the cookie itself is out of this world.  The mint just gives it just the right elegant touch that you can serve it to the girls when they come over for coffee.   It says 36 Andes mints, but you really only need 18 since you cut them in half!!  Then after you finish this recipe, why not impress everyone by using the rest of the Andes Mints and making "Thin Mint Crackers."  They're IDENTICAL to Girl Scout cookies, and gives you a reason to buy a big box of Andes!  BTW, this took me 9 min exactly to cook, and I really recommend putting the baking sheet BACK in the fridge after you've placed the mint and swirled so chocolate can set and you can then store in lock~n~lock container at room temp.

I make these every year, everyone goes nuts about them.  If you can't find the green Andes mints, use the black ones and add green sprinkles. A half mint is about the right size for the size cookies I make. Now they have Andes mint chips that work well.  

Just adding to my review, some of my grandkids aren't that wild about mint, I tried using the new Andes Cherry Jubilee mints and the kids went wild!  I made 10 dozen and they were gone in a week!

"Chocolate mint wafer candies" is a little vague, but I guess any kind of chocolate would do! I used thin, chocolate covered mint patties (Necco Haviland chocolate mints} and they worked out perfectly. This is one good cookie, perfect for Christmas, and the recipe directions are spot on.  Minty, chocolatey, creamy, chewy, all in one.  Delicious.

WOW! So easy to make. I made two batches using the exact recipe for each and made close to 20 dozen! I made the balls small, half a mint was just enough. I used a melon baller and scooped out just enough to fill the scooper level. Mine were a little flat, but still soft. I would recommend covering the dough when put into the fridge to chill as the dough got a little dry on the top.
I ran out of Andes mints, ended up with Junior Mints on the second batch. They are ok. I tried to spread the Junior Mints as I did the Andes mints and they don't spread as well so I just left them sitting on top whole. The cookie was small enough to take a bite and still get half the Junior Mint taste. I definatel will only use Andes mints again, and will definately make these cookies throughout the year! Best cookies ever!!

This is my new favorite Christmas Cookie recipe.  I made these last night and my husband and I LOVED them.  
Like other users have stated, this recipe makes more than 3 dozen cookies so make sure you have enough mints for the tops!  I got 4 dozen generous sized cookies out of this recipe.

I substituted a bag of Andes Creme de Menthes pieces and 1 TB cocoa for the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  This gave the cookie itself a nice minty taste as well.
I was nervous about the consistency of the dough once I was finished mixing it - it was more like brownie batter or drop cookie dough.  But I stuck it in the freezer for about 30 mins and it was very easy to work with.  

These cookies came out perfect.  Nice and chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside, like a good chocolate chip cookie should be.  I'll be making these again, and again, and again.

We love this cookie. Instead of mint Andes, I used The chocolate cherry Andes. Tastes wonderful! Just like a chocolate covered cherry!

I found that the cookies look "prettier" if you melt the andes mints together in a bowl and drizzle them on top of the cookie.

Wonderful cookie! My 7-year-old is begging for another batch...so today, Christmas Eve, I am baking MORE cookies. He loved them so much he wanted to help me make them so he could "learn how"...  Highly suggest using Andes mints and pressing half wafter "into" the cookie a bit...will "break" the top a little but it's fine when it cools...  Also suggest rolling your dough balls, then storing in refrigerator until they get more firm. Took straight from fridge to oven and cookies seem to set a little "higher" when they baked...  Made these for a cookie exchange and they were wonderful!

Cookies were really moist and chewy.  Brownie like texture. Baked for 8 minutes, removed from oven and placed mint on top of cookie and put back into the oven for 1 minute and spread. I tried the Andes mints and York peppermint patties. The York peppermint candies were hard to spread and looked terrible.  The Andes mints were perfect, spread easily and looked great.  Thinking about trying the cookie base w/o mint to make chocolate half-moon (black & white) cookies.

I entered a local cookie bake-off (about 25 entries) using these cookies today. I am not a really a mint fan, but... apparently the judges were because I won! I used Cadbury Pep Mint Patties (chopped into small pieces) and I melted the chocolate in the microwave & then quickly spread it on the cookies. I did that simply for time because the Pep patties are THICK and would have taken forever to melt on their own. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes resulting in chewy almost brownie like cookies. On their own, the cookies are a little on the blah side, but with the peppermint "icing"- Fantastic! I can't count how many times I heard, "Mmm this tastes exactly like a girl guide cookie!!!". They're chewy, rich & an overall winner!

I was looking for a plain chocolate cookie recipe to make for ice cream sandwiches and found this one. They were AMAZING and so easy! I didn't use the mint candy at the end. Instead, just let them cool and made them into sandwiches with homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream. So good - will definitely be making again!

If you like thin mints, you will love these.  They are so much better because they are soft.  I made them according to instructions, but I did add 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract to the dough.  They baked for exactly 8 minutes and were perfect.  I used the Andes mints for the frosting and it left a pretty green swirl on the top.

These cookies taste great--chewy like brownies.  I was confused, though, about what "mint wafer candies" were.  York peppermint patties?  or Andes candies?  I tried both, and the peppermint patties turned out pretty gross.  The Andes candies melted much better.

Not a huge fan, I make baked goods for work almost every Monday for 50 people and am known as the best baker. But these cookies remained on my platter for days and half got thrown away. 
With the amount of butter / choco chips & mints used, they are an expensive alternative to a regular chocolate cookie.

I just love these!  They are far better than Thin Mints IMHO.  Sometimes I can't find mint wafers at the store so instead I'll use mint chips and add a couple mint and a couple chocolate chips.  When they melt I swirl them around and it makes a pretty marbly pattern.  Fabulous recipe.

I also added the peppermint extract to the cookie dough like someone else suggested.  Before I baked them I rolled the cookie dough in granulated sugar to give them a more dressed up look.  Before they just tasted great - once rolled in sugar they became cookie swap worthy.

We have a winner. Although mine ended up being flat, they were still deliciously chocolatey and chewy... just they way I wanted them! Rather than using water, I used creme de menthe... yum! And to deviate even more from the recipe :) I used mint and chocolate chips in place of the semisweet and then just used a few chocolate chips on top...let them melt and swirled just like the recipe states. I wanted to review it still since I don't feel my modifications were off so much that they didnt warrant a review. I loved these and they are hit with my coworkers too!

Loved these cookies!  Easy to make and came out perfect and moist.  I used "After Eight" mints cut into fourths for the topping because I'm in Sweden right now and can't find Andes anywhere.  Still turned out great and was a hit at the X-mas party!

I made a lot of different cookies for our Christmas Cookie gift platter this year and this was the favorite of my 7 year old. Chilling the dough is really important. I started with this dough and let it chill for at least 2 hours while I worked on other recipes.  This gives you a nice brownie like consistency to the cookie. Every time I do a cookie recipe that uses melted butter and sugar in it I let the dough chill first and it seems to keep the cookies from getting too flat.   I had my Andes mints halved and ready to go when I took each sheet out of the oven. I put the mints on immediately and let them sit for about a minute. They melt and smooth out beautifully using the back of a spoon. I also did some with just the Andes baking pieces mixed in, but the frosted ones were far more popular.   For my own tastes I found this to be a little overly sweet, but I had to make extras for my son and husband since they didn’t want me to give them all away.

These are really yummy. I didn't change the recipe and I'm glad I didn't! In order to get them to puff up and look pretty, refridgerating them is really, really important. Don't skip this step and expect to have pretty cookies. Since I couldn't find the Andes Mints, I used 1/4 tsp mint extract in the dough, I think more could be added, but it was perfect for my taste. I "iced" them with regular chocolate using this recipe's method of just placing the chips on top and letting them melt, and it worked great! Wonderful cookie, these will be part of our Christmas cookie collection from now on. Thanks! :-D

After searching more than a dozen stores for Andes mints (I kid you not), a friend suggested I try mint chocolate chips instead.  So I put 4-5 mint chocolate chips on each cookie and let them melt the same way so I could spread them once they'd melted and they were soooo yummy!  Just as good as they were when I made them last year with the Andes mints!  This recipe is fantastic!

Delicious and very easy - they actually taste better after they cool and the mint has had a chance to set than they do hot out of the oven.  They would be prefect around the holidays.  My tips: Don't overcook - take them out while they are still underdone, because they firm up as they cool.  Don't make them too small, either, or half an Andes' mint will overwhelm the chocolate taste (walnut-sized balls of dough worked well for me). Also, they will get a tad messy as the mints melt (in less than 5 minutes), so just keep an eye on them and use a paper towel or tinfoil underneath to catch the melting chocolate.

OMG!!  These are SOOOOO Good!!  My husband couldn't stop eating them.  And I found out why when I ate the first one.  I put 3/4 of Andy's chocolate mint square since I made each cookies big.  I ended up having only 20 cookies total.

These are lovely.  I used the dark brown andes mints and added green sprinkles.  I only used half of a mint per cookie.  Also, these overbake very very easily.  I baked only 8 min, no more.

These were very tasty. I mixed some mini York peppermint patty baking pieces into the dough instead of placing a mint on top of the cookie. I have requests to make these again. Thank you!

These are incredible cookies.  The mint frosting is very creative and tastes great!
The chocolate didn't melt completely so I put them back in the oven for a minute to melt it
and then they were delicious.

Yum!  Combining two of my favorite things!  I didn't have whole Andes candies, so I just the Andes pieces I had on hand and just mixed them in with the batter.

Yum! These cookies are chewy on the inside, slightly crunchy on the outside. the 1/2 mint on each cookie is just enough for a great mint taste without having it be over powering. very yummy and packages great. Make sure to allow time for the chocolate to harden before putting the cookies into containers. made a ton of cookies (probably close to 4-5 dozen for me)

A very good recipe that makes a lot more than three dozen.  I would have liked a stronger mint flavor, and next time would either put some peppermint extract in the dough or use a whole candy on the top.

This is my new favorite cookie!!! I tryed this recipe three different ways. First off, way to much work using Andes mints with the green wrapper. Way easier to buy the Andes mint chips, found next to the chocolate chips. All you do is sprinke a few chips on the top of the baked cookie, wait one mintue then spread with a knife or the back of a teaspoon. I also tryed mixing the chips into the batter. Very good but not as good as melting the chips on top. I also mixed white chocolate chips into the batter. Again, good but over kill. Does not need the additional chips in the batter. Last, I tryed 60% dark chocolate chips instead of the semisweet. WAY BETTER!!!! Love the rich darkness!!! These cookies taste like Girl Scout Thin Mints...YOU WILL LOVE THEM!!! Forgot, try them cold or frozen...TOO DIE FOR!!!

these cookies are SO GOOD!!!!!! i found that i you melt the chocolate in a plastic bag and then use it as a pipet to drizzle the chocolate on, it looks SO MUCH BETTER, and also the chocolate hardens a lot quicker. SERIOUSLY GIVE THESE A SHOT!!! so yummy! :)

My husband and friends really liked these. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the size of the cookies and I didn't put mint on top of all the cookies. Because they were larger, I melted a whole Andes mint on the top.  On the other half of the cookies, instead of the mint, I spread melted white chocolate because not all of my company likes mint. The white chocolate cookies were the first to go, but the people that tried the mint ones really liked them.

Chocolate and mint and chocolate and cherry are two of my favorite combinations.  As per others suggestions, I used Andes Creme de Menthe thins as well as Andes Cherry Jubilee thins.  I make my cookies very small so I end up getting about 8 dozen from one batch, so even using 1/2 a chocolate with each cookie, I need 2 boxes of Andes candies.  These cookies tastes great as written but aren't that pretty, so to make them prettier and to distinguish between the mint and the cherry ones, I crushed some candy cane (actually ribbon candy since that it what I had) over the mint ones and pressed 1/2 of a marashino cherry into the cherry ones after swirling the chocolate "frosting" part.  This makes for two distinct, beautiful delicious kinds of cookies with minimal extra effort from one batch of batter (about 4 dozen of each).

Yum!  I made this recipe for my cookie exchange and instead of all Andes mints, I did half with Andes toffee rectangles (same size as mints) and those were just as delicious.  Make sure not to overbake, as I did for half and they were hard (I did 10 minutes then put back in to melt chocolate 2 minutes and this was too long).

Awesome cookies. I made a few batches. The 1st time I made the balls a bit big and got 40 cookies. They also spread into each other b/c of their size. They still came out good-nice and chewy. The 2nd batch I made much smaller and it made 56 cookies. Hershey kisses makes mint kisses now so I used those on the 1 batch and the Andes on the other. I used the remaining Andes as decoration on my plate.

Decadent cookie. The chocolate mint melted on top is so good. A few changes were done: the butter was increased to one cup and the salt was increased to one teaspoon based on another recipe that was similar to this one. I beat the sugar and butter(softened) and then added the melted chocolate chips. I served mine with a glass of milk and I got a refreshing taste after each sip because of the mint.

I made this for a work Christmas lunch and everyone loved them.  I had everyone asking me if I made these from scratch.  Very easy to make and extremely yummy.  I definitely recommend these if you love chocolate mint cookies.

Great cookie!  I found this recipe when trying to find a chocolate cookie to use with Andes Creme de Menthe chips.  I make the recipe as written, only instead of putting the mint candy on top after baking, I mix the chips in before baking, then drizzle with green icing when they're cool.  They taste & look great for the holidays.

I didn't have time to bake these right away, so they stayed in the fridge for at least 3 days. And, surprisingly, they're still good! I didn't have Andes mints so I just added mint flavoring to taste. Bravo to these cookies!

These are so delicious. One batch made about 50 cookies for me.  I used Andes mints on top.  It's a very easy recipe to make.  I will definitely make these again.

Love these cookies.  They are a nice, chewy, cookie and the melted chocolate mint(I used Andes creme de menthe) on top makes them delicious.  Simply yummy & addictive!

The store I went to was out of Andes mints so I tried peppermint patties and they didn't work.  Finally found Andes mints and they worked great!

Our family gave this cookie 5 stars. They are easy, delicious and different. Will definitely add these to our holiday cookie exchange. Our only mistake was doubling the recipe out of fear that the original recipe wouldn't provide enough. This isn't a dough that refridgerates well - so only make what you need. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked these cookies.  This recipe worked really well for my family because my husband doesn't really like mint chocolate flavor, so I left a few without the andes mint topping.    I don't have much experiece baking, and I was a little worried about how thick the dough was.  But it gives them a nice brownie-like texture.  Be aware that the toping takes a long time to dry & harden.

This is my "famous" holiday cookie recipe.  I crush candycanes by putting them in a bag (and put another bag over it, in case the bag punctures) and wacking them with a hammer.  I put about a tsp of the fine dust into the batter and then decorate by putting the candycane bits on top of the "frosting".  It is a HUGE hit at the office every year.  A co-worker loves them so much that he has been known to eat NINE in one 3 hour period.  I am not allowed to make anything else during the December pot-luck.  :)

Pretty good...be sure to roll into balls rather than use a cookie scoop so dough is well compacted.  Easy to overcook so take them out when time is up for sure. These look pretty but mint can be "too much" .  Placed a whole nut on top of some instead of mint. Yum.

I added 1 1/2 tsp of mint extract to the batter after the eggs.  And instead of melting Andes, I melted mint m&m's in a saucepan, over low heat, until melted and the shells had fragmented.  Then I spread the m&m's over cooled cookies.  The result: an excellent minty cookie with a slightly crispy, minty, chocolately, festive "frosting".  The holiday m&m's added little bits of green, red and white. They looked more like a Christmas cookie.  Awesome recipe as is, and to build on!

I skipped the last part, adding the mints on top,  "While cookies are baking unwrap mints and divide each in half. When cookies are brought out of the oven, put 1/2 mint on top of each cookie. Let the mint sit for up to 5 minutes until melted, then spread the mint on top of the cookie."

Instead I added 2 capfuls of Peppermint Extract to the mix when I added the eggs, and it came out exxxxxcellent!!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and these turned out great.  I let the batter sit overnight which I think made the difference.  I also used a cookie scoop to portion the cookies, then rolled the cookies in my hand and flattened the cookie slightly.  The cookies only needed 8 minutes to bake.

AMAAAAAAZING!!! Crisp outside and fudgy soft inside with a hint of mint on top. I used the ingredients as written, though mixed them up a bit differently. As suggested by another reviewer, I microwaved the butter, suger, and water for 1 minute, stirred, added in the chips, and microwaved for another minute. This worked GREAT! When all was mixed, I refrigerated overnight. The dough was quite firm in the a.m., but the 1" pampered chef scoop worked like a charm. I made these for a cookie exchange when it's always risky trying a new recipe. No need to worry here. This recipe certainly delivers!!

These cookies are very good mint cookies. I wasn't sure what 'mint wafer candies' were. I used mint baking chips-i had to kind of make an indentation in the cookie so they didn't roll off but they worked fine. Next time I might follow another reviewer and get andes mints or something. This batter is very different then any other cookie batter I've seen, but the cookies are different and so good.

Best seller at the bake sale!  They were delicious and my family cant wait for more.  I gave the andes mints a rough chop and threw them in the dough. I think they are best when they've had a chance to cool and set up.

Very good cookies!  I did buy Andes pieces so when the batter was made, I stirred in the pieces.  Cookies turned out wonderful but next time I will do as the directions indicated and melt pieces or 1/2 of piece of candy (which ever I have on hand).  I think that may make cookie looked "prettier"  !!! (just my opinion--nothing to do with taste!)

These are my daughter's favorites, everyone loves them.  I put about 2/3 of a wafer on each, then put chocolate chips on the rest when I run out of mint.  This has also got to be the best cookie batter ever.

I used the advice of the reviewer who stated they just mixed the Andes baking chips during the melted chocolate stage (rather than as "frosting").  Also, based on another review, I was very careful not to overheat when melting the ingredients on the stove.  The cookies turned out PERFECT!  THANK YOU!

Holy cow, these are good. I did as another suggested and just added Andes pieces in after the dry ingredients. Really, really yummy.

These are WONDERFUL!  I changed it just a bit.  I took the mints and melted them with some more chocolate chips and dipped the tops of the cookies in the chocolate.  They taste just like those famous girl scout cookies that everyone can't get enough of.  YUM!

These are my new favorite Christmas Cookies to make and eat!  I love that the "chocolate mint frosting" sets up quickly and then you can store them to keep moist!  Thank for a great recipe!

I made these for the office cookie contest and WON!!!  I followed the instructions exactly except I used Nestle Toll House Mint Chips instead of Andes. I divided up the brown and green chips, melted them, and piped the chocolate over the cookies like Jackson Pollack! I called the “Peppermint Pollacks” and they were a huge hit!

This recipe was fantastic!  I doubled it, and I got over 90 cookies!  I usually cheat and make cookies from a mix, but this will be my staple chocolate cookie recipe from now on,  There are so many different variations that you could make from this base.  For the mint, I used the Andes creme de menthe pieces.  These cookies were so yummy!.  Even my husband, who hates mint liked these!  I am looking forward to making more cookies, and adding different things like peanut butter chips or white chocolate chips.

WOW - the best cookies ever.  Better than the girl scout cookies i spend big bucks on - sorry girl scouts. The comment recommending that you microwave in place of cooking on the oven is a great suggestion.  1st time using stove top - cookies were totally flat - followed the microwave instructions and they came out perfect - like the picture.  Followed all other directions to the T.

These were wonderful and so easy.  I only chilled the dough in the freezer for 15 mins and had no trouble at all with the dough.  I did as another reviewer suggested and microwaved butter/sugar mixture for a min and then whisked it until all was well blended, also did the same when I added the choc chips.  I used the Andes Creme De mint.  I got about 5 dozen cookies out of this.  i had to wrap them up very tightly and put them in my fridge downstairs to keep from eating at the very least a dozen cookies in a sitting!

One word sums up my cookie experience: DISASTER. The cookies were flat as pancakes and stuck to the pan. Unfortunately, I had to throw away almost all of the recipe. Considering I'm not at a high altitude, I really don't know what could have happened. I followed the recipe exactly. It seems that a few others had a similar experience...

Warning--ADDICTIVE---Warning---ADDICTIVE.
Trust Me! I'm Serious!  These sound a little complicated to bake but they are easy.  I made according to the directions except I followed Joelle B's method for Step 1 in the microwave. (Cook butter, sugar and water for 1 minute in the microwave and then whisk until all the butter is melted. Then add the choc chips, microwave for 1 more min. and then use a whisk to stir the chips until they were all melted.  Let cool real good before moving on to step 2) Chill again real good at the end of step 2 so you can easily roll balls.  I rolled into small balls. You will need to bake several batches so I recommend parchment paper so you can easily slide these off your baking sheets and move on to the next batch. Let cool after baking for 1 minute before placing the Andes mint with green on top.  I did not press the mints in as some suggested - I didn't want the dents in the cookie tops.  After the mint melts in a couple of minutes it's easy to swirl and frost the top.   Remember my warning - these are addictive!

if you like mint chocolate you need to try these cookies.  i followed some suggestions from others---i microwaved the butter, sugar & water for 1 min, mix until the butter is completely melted...with the chocolate chips, i also microwaved for 1 min.  i also placed batter in a rectangular pan before putting in the fridge and made sure it's completely cooled off. *thanks for the suggestions* the cookies turned out great! a must try, will definitely make this again :)

Great cookie recipe - I would REDUCE THE SALT a bit if you don't like your cookies tasting salty, I personaly kinda like it but that's a matter of personal opinion. When baking I would recommend a BAKING TIME of between 12-15 minutes. I did my first batch for 10 and they were still dough like in the middle. Lastly I would NOT recommend using MINT EXTRACT. I did and it was like eating cookies after brushing your teath! Stick with the CHOCOLATE MINT DROP in the middle and that's plenty mint flavor to go around!

These cookies are great. A word about those of you who rate recipes. It NEVER ceases to amaze me that people will alter a recipe with their own "ideas" then proceed to criticize the original recipe because it didn't turn out "the way the were expecting." Please people, in the future, if you alter a recipe and don't like it, don't rate the original recipe poorly. Only if you have followed the recipe exactly do you then earn the right to review it!!!!

This cookie is pretty good if you like girl scout's thin mints!  They taste better after you let them cool overnight.  Make sure you have alot of room in the kitchen to make it.  You have to let the chocolate on the cookie cool and that can take couple hours.  You can't stack the cookies on top of each other so make room!

You are in for a treat if you make these!! (and a possible weight gain, too! lol)

These were really easy to make AND they taste wonderful.  
One suggestion... make the balls small!! I messed up the first batch by making huge walnut sized balls which spread all over the place and made a huge mess!

OMG! I just finished making these cookies and I have to say they are awesome! If I could rate it a "10" I would!! The dough was effortless to make and they cooked perfect. They are so darn yummy. Also, a word to the wise, make sure you use a whole mint on top (not half like the recipe says)and do not move them to a cooling rack for at least 10 minutes and there will be no mess at all.

very very very good. made these with my friend today, there were many casualties that had to be eaten on the spot. after all can't give broken cookies to people can you? they are a bit messy right after being taken out of the oven and I highly suggest NOT using a wire cooling rack to cool them...they're so gooey they fall right through. but paper grocery bags that are cut open and unfolded work great! we ended up having more mint chips than plain chocolate chips so we put about 1 1/2 cups mint chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. they turned out great! yumm.

Fantastic - these were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly - the only change I would make is to use the Andes mints with green tops, so people would know they were mint.

I made these cookies for a Christmas party with no prior experience how how the would turn out.  I am sooooo glad I did, they were FANTASTIC and taste like the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies, but WAY better since they are perfectly soft. They keep for days too without compromising taste or texture. I have been giving this recipe to everyone.  I plan on using the chocolate cookie recipe again and experimenting with different icings for fun.

These were super-easy, and a hit with everyone. I made them just as the recipe directed, no variations. I used Andes mints--almost two packages of them because the recipe made soooo many cookies, almost 7 dozen! I almost always make cookies bigger than the recipe calls for, but in this case, smaller was better. A rounded teaspoonful is really about the perfect size for these cookies. I took them to a Christmas party, and they were gobbled up by kids and adults alike in no time. Many rave reviews. Great, easy recipe.

These cookies are excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, and I used the Andes Creme de Menthe candy. Turned out perfectly. I even refrigerated my dough overnight, because I started too late in the evening. When I resumed baking, they were just fine after having the dough in the fridge all night. Jamieson loved them.

This was a great recipe!  I thought it would be tedious and messy, but it really wasn't.  I didn't have any problems with the balls sticking to my hands and I rolled them in granulated sugar like another member had suggested.  I had to cook them a little longer (12 minutes), they were too gooey in the middle cooked at 10, then I put the mints on top and put them back in for 1 minute more.  I also ended up with five dozen cookies instead of three, but it was fine because I bought extra mints!

LOVE the texture! I used mint chocolate chips instead of plain and a cookie scoop so they would be the same size. I just left them in the ball shape and they spread just right. I pulled them out, sprinkled with some chopped Andes pieces and swirled the tops after a minute. I even left a few without the topping and they were good too, but I prefer the dual mint flavors.

Made these twice.  Both times I got rave reviews.   I added mint extract for added mint flavor in addition to the Andes Candies. I also made the mistake of following a reviewers advice and leaving the dough in the fridge over night. It turned into a rock hard solid mass that I had to chisel apart -adding a splash of water as i went along until i was able to get it back to a dough.  So I will make these again because they are amazing and I think I will take anothers advise and roll them into balls before chilling! great idea!

I make these cookies every year. My family loves them. Yes, they use melted Andes Mints on the top and here is a hint. Make a variety of flavors by using the mint flavor AND also use the cherry jubilee and toffee flavors that Andes makes. The Cherry Jubilee and the Mint make  nice platter of cookies.  See the flavors at the Tootsie web site

I doubled the recipe to make cookies for those I work with as well as a few neighbors. I used a Tablespoon to measure each ball so they would all be the same size and yielded about 125 cookies. So, one recipe (unless you make gigantic cookies) should make about 60 or more nice size cookies. They are delicious too! I got rave reviews for sure! Don't skimp on chill time, the longer the better. And don't crowd the pan, they'll look nicer if they don't cook together.

Used mint chocolate chips. No matter how long I cooked them, they ended up becoming crisp when they cooled. I was a bit perturbed until I realized that the texture, crunch and taste were exactly like Thin Mint cookies without the chocolate coating!!!

FANTASTIC!  Don't leave them to cool in the fridge too long.  I had to leave the dough on the counter for a good hour to "warm up" so it was pliable again.  Another reviewer said she rolled the dough into balls & then refrigerated. I will be doing it that way next time.  My cookies were quite small and I ended up with 96 cookies. I only baked them for 6-7 min.  I used knockoff after eights cut into quarters.  They turned out fabulous.  I also sprinkled them with green coloured sugar(which I made with white sugar,green food colouring smooshed up in ziploc bag).  They did not flatten out like other reviewers said there's did.  This will be a Christmas cookie staple in my house from now on.

These came out excellent.  I substituted Hershey's Mint Kisses for the Andes Mints and the Red and White stripes of the kisses gave the cookies a candy cane effect.

Good gravy are these good! After I mixed the ingredients the 'dough' looked like brownie mix and when I took it out of the fridge it was harder than I expected - but it rolled up nicely. I did make small balls and this helped make the cookie a nice bite size. I used the Andes candies chips on top but found them a bit messy, so I figured out to use parchment paper and this helped the cookie plus helped keep the tray from getting messy. The cookie is nice and soft and does taste like a girl scout thin mint.

Delicious!  These cookies are a sinful treat!  Instead of putting the mint on top I stirred in about 1 1/2 cups of Andes mint chips.  Excellent!

These turned out great - much better than I had expected. We decided to try the mint pastilles as the candy center. The cookie looks like a chocolate version of peanut butter blossoms, with unearthly pink and green kisses in the center, but super yummy.

Just wonderful, melt in your mouth cookies.  Chilled the dough for more than an hour, and had no issues with sticky dough.  Scooped them out with a small cookie/meatball scoop which made rolling them a breeze.  Baked them for 8 minutes, and left them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes while the Andes mints were melting.  Found it helpful to have the mints cut and ready to go, so they can be put on the cookie right away, allowing them to melt beautifully.  I swirled the melted mint wafer with the think side of a flat toothpick.  This prevented loss of chocolate on a bigger utensil and allowed the two colors of the wafer to shine more.  They were the hit of my kiddo's school bake sale!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made these for the first time, using Andes baking pieces right in the dough. The dough is a little bit of work, but these bake up like a dream and are so good I will make them again.

I made these cookies and could not find the andies mints. I used the mint areo bars and just cut each piece into about 3 or 4 and let that melt on top and spread it around! They were amazing. I will make these again for sure! Thinking about giving them out for Christmas as well!

I'm terrible at making cookies. I'm not sure why. But I followed the directions with the exception of baking soda because I couldn't find baking soda in Mexico. I used an instant yeast and doubled the requirement. They were awesome! My family loved them and I gave some to a couple of security guards at the school. I think I'll give these as Christmas gifts for people I've met here. Thank you for sharing!

These are truly delicious!  My boyfriend and I are foodies, so very discriminating when it comes to recipes ;).  These cookies are moist, soft, and have just the right amount of mint - not too strong but you get a nice flavor with every cookie.  Plus they are super easy to make, and the melting of the mints on top is a no-fail icing system.  Big thumbs up!

These were good...but nothing to write home about. Mine turned out flat...crispy on the outside and chewy and bendy in the middle...for true mint lovers only. They froze well...but i will probably not make them again.

Oh my goodness!!!!  These cookies are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they came out perfect!  I loved working with the dough - it was almost like a thick chocolate mousse.  Rolled chilled dough into about 1" balls (did not flatten) and cooked for 9 minutes.  Put on Andes mints immediately from oven, then swirled after 5 minutes.  The most amazing thing about these, besides the taste, is that they are soft and chewy like the large bakery cookies, but even better!  I made approx. 7 dozen (doubled recipe) for about 15 people and they were literally gone in 1 day!!! I was begged by many to make more.  A definite keeper!  Thank you!

I made the dough 2 nights ago, and baked them yesterday morning. I don't know if I would advise making the dough and refridgerating overnight necessarily because I did need to let it warm up a bit before I could even scoop out some of the dough. That said, it was a wonderful recipe that I took to a family event and got raves from all those that tried them. They reminded me of the peppermint patties candys. I made 44 cookies with this recipe. When I was getting ready to ice them with the candies, I didn't think that a half would be enough once melted to adequately cover the cookie top. WRONG. As a result, I didn't have enough candies to frost all of them (36 in a box). Next time I'll know different. And there will be a next time.

These are exactly as described, melt-in-your-mouth. My husband and son couldn't keep their hands off of them. I only got to eat a couple. I added vanilla to mine as another reviewer suggested and they turned out great.

love these, only thing I add is 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp mint extract to the batter, and I use 1/2 an andies mint on top of each cookie (same directions for letting sit 5 minutes then spreading with the back of a spoon).

If you like Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies, you'll love these.  When you put them on a Christmas cookie tray, they're almost always the first to go.

I hate to give this a low rating, because I had such high hopes for it! My cookies turned out flat as crackers. I adjusted for higher altitude, but I think the problem is the melted butter. If I try this recipe again, I may try just softening the butter and creaming it with the sugar instead of melting it fully, since typically a flat cookie means your butter was TOO soft. Good idea, though!

Maybe because I'm at high altitude (Boulder CO), but these didn't work for me at all.  I followed the directions precisely and the dough looked fine, but didn't set in the oven and then immediately deflated when I took them out.  I left some in for the time directed and some for longer, but neither turned out well.  Also, they weren't coming off of an ungreased pan well so I tried greasing a pan but the cookies still wouldn't separate from it easily. Disappointing... they sound great, but I wouldn't try these if you're at a high altitude.

These are the best cookies I have ever tasted. Hands down the best. I made them for Christmas last year with about 10 other cookies and everyone was fighting over the last couple. These were the first ones gone off a huge cookie platter. The cookie was even better a couple of days later if they last that long because the cookie gets so moist and chewy. I'm gonna go make some more right now. Next Christmas I will for sure make a double batch.

Made the cookies with the Andies Mints.  Went to a cookie swap last night and won the "Best Overall Cookie" with this recipe. Would definitely make it again. Merry Christmas!

These are soooo good.  I bought the Andes mint chips and mixed 2 cups into the batter before baking.  These cookies came out great.  Will definitely make these again.

I made these cookies for the first time at Christmas last year and they are now one of my favorites! I thought they were easy to make and tasted great! I really liked the mint on the top. I will probably make these every year from now on.

Made these at christmas with the Andes bits. Spread some on top and also stirred some into the batter. The green was pretty and festive and the flavor was good. The cookies turned out a little flat, but were soft and moist!

I added some peppermint extract, which isn't the recipe's fault, and they were bad.  My mother commented that they looked ugly.  I'm a little afraid to try again...

My sister and I used a whole Andes mint atop each cookie and just barely spread it around, so there were some green swirls on top.  A treat to look at, as well as eat!

I made this recipe to try it out on the family,because they are my best critics.They absolutely loved them.It was the Christmas cookie hit this year,so I made them for a cookie exchange at work. They all loved them as well.Whom ever suggested using the Andes mint,was brilliant,they worked so well.After I put 1/2 the mint on each cookie,I did pop them in the freezer to harden,worked out great!! Thanks so much for a new favorite cookie for Christmas. I will probably make them more often if I can find the mints for the top.

Great idea!  I used a different cookie recipe (caramel filled chocolate cookies from this site) and topped them with the Andes mints as well as After Eights.  Both worked but the Andes were creamier!  AWESOME!!

These cookies tasted OK, but were not at all what I expected. Even after varying the baking time, they were still as flat as pancakes. I might make them again, and use shortening instead of butter, and cake flour instead of all purpose. To the credit of the original recipe, my boyfriend did enjoy them.

Delicious and easy cookie to make!  Use 1/2 of an Andes mint per cookie and a melon baller...works like a charm.  When you mix the dry with the wet ingredients, it turns to a fudge-like consistency.  One batch made several dozen (you'll need that many because everyone loves them!)

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange and ended up with 102 decent-sized cookies.  I experimented with the 8-10 minutes trying to keep them from going flat.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  I ran out of Andes mints and ended up using mini mint Hershey bars in dark, milk, and white chocolate, plus mint Hershey kisses.  They all work equally well.

Everyone loved these.  Made them exactly as written.  Apparently my cookies were smaller than the submitters cookies because I got 7 dozen.  At that size, 1/2 mint is plenty!  I found there was no need for mint extract in the dough.  I did find that it was necessary to cover it to chill.  Otherwise it dried out and wouldn't roll well.  Thanks!

Awesome!  These are fantastic!  I got 4.5 dozen.  I followed the recipe exactly for the dough.  I left in the fridge longer than one hour because of time, kids, etc.  The consistency once I started working with it reminded me of fudge.  It was a bit crumbly as someone mentioned, but I rolled into balls with my hands they were fine - made nice little balls (probably 3/4 inch in diameter or so).  I ended up baking for 11 minutes since at 10 minutes then seemed a little too undercooked for me.  Then I place a full piece of candy  (Andes creme de menthe) on half of the cookies and on the other half I used the Andes chocolate toffee thins (hubby isn't a mint fan).  I put the candies on right after the cookies came out of the oven and let them sit for about 5 minutes and then spread.  The mint ones sometimes slid off a bit so just check. . .the toffee ones kept their shape and didn't slide (probably because they are a bit "rougher" from the ground up toffee).  In any case, both turned out to be super yummy delicious!  I gave them as teacher gifts for my son's preschool class.  Am also going to make them for a cookie exchange.  Yum yum yummy!  I thought the full piece of candy gave the mint ones enough mint flavor (some where concerned about not being minty enough with 1/2 piece).

Thanks for a great cookie recipe!!!

Wow!  These are great cookies!  I followed someone's suggestion and used the Andes mints with the green center.  I used the chopped ones and just sprinkled them on top.  The green color makes the icing really pretty.  They made fantastic Christmas gifts! My husband is not a "sweets" eater, but I couldn't stop him from eating these!

Wonderful recipe! These cookies remind me a little of Girls Scout Thin Mints. They were very easy to make and freeze well. I followed the recipe exactly except I was 2 Andes candies short, so I used chocolate chips on top for the last few cookies. I plan on taking them to a cookie exchange next week. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were deelish and super-easy!!  I didn't change a thing, but bear in mind that you will need more than one box of Andes candy if that's what you use. I think I got about six or seven dozen cookies out of this recipe.  We decorated ours with colored sugars and sprinkles for Christmas!

Excellent cookies as is even tho I had my problems!  First let me say that I am NOT a baker, and a novice cook at best.  I followed this recipe to the T, so I thought.  I used York peppermint patties as the "Chocolate mint wafer candies" but I didn't realize that one serving was 2 cookies.  (Printed recipe reads 18 servings so I made 18 cookies!  Didn't see the "original recipe yields 3 dozen" part on the website version!)  Cooked 8-10 minutes, pulled them out of the oven, put the mint candy, cut in half, on top, pressed them into the cookie a little bit and waited for melt.  Didn't melt so I checked the cookies and they were sooo not cooked enough.  Put the cookies back in the oven with candies on top for another good 10 minutes and they cooked into a large, bakery style cookie with a thin mint chocolate topping oozing over the top!  Some melted over onto the pan but that was a bonus!  OH MY GAWD!  Next time i will double the recipe and do it exactly the same way!  SOOO GOOD!

Superb recipe - great tasting and easy to make! I go all out and put a full Andes mint on top of each cookie. The chocolate melts down into all the cookie crevices creating perfect cookie goodness!  For those who said the cookies were flat, the butter probably wasn't cold enough.  Before rolling into balls, put the dough in the fridge for 15-30 minutes.  The chilled dough allows it not to spread so quickly in the oven, resulting in a thicker cookie. Also, use a cookie scoop to ensure all the cookies are the same size and cook evenly for the same amount of time. These cookies are pretty but they taste even better. Perfect for a cookie exchange and just as good 2-3 days later as the first day (and I'm not really a chocolate cookie person!!!).

Good tasting cookie. The only suggestion I would do is add crushed peppermint bits to melted mint to add a more christmsy flare to them!

Every Christmas this is the cookie that's requested. If your lucky enough to find them Andes Candies makes a cherry flavor at Christmas which would give you a Chocolate Covered Cherrie taste. Yum, Yum, Yum.
Happy Baking.

OMG!  This was even better than I thought it would be!  Just the right amount of mint - not overpowering as some I've tried.  I used a small cookie scoop (1 tablespoon) and the cookies were about walnut sized.  I got about 4 dozen cookies.  This is a definite keeper!  I'm thinking it'll be a wonderful addition to my homemade gift baskets!

Uh, the math doesn't compute. The recipe makes three (3) dozen cookies, but yet it says to use 36 Andes candies but put only half a candy on top of each cookie. If you do that, you're going to have a lot of halves left over. The recipe SHOULD read use 18 Andes, not 36. If you were using a WHOLE Andes on each cookie, THEN you would use 36.

These were quite a hit over the holidays. I was a bit concerned when I first read the directions but decided to give it a go. They turned out wonderfully moist and ever so chocolate-y! My husband insists that I have to make these every year now. :) Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Terrific! I only used one package of chocolate chips (12 oz) and they tasted delicious. 2 cups is a little annoying since that is technically a package and 1/4 of another (standard package size). Anyway, plenty chocolatey!

Loved these! Made with left over chocolate bars and a friends home made "mints"  the mint and amaretto ones were the best.  These did become a very flat cookie for me, but they were very soft and had great flavor!

delicious! Made it exactly like the directions said and came out great! (although I think I would like slightly less flour) I thought the batter was going to be too wet and sticky but after cooling it in the fridge, it was very easy to roll into balls. Tasted a lot better after it cooled!

I made these for my husband's workplace cookie bakeoff and they won!  Amazing soft cookies- they needed exactly 8 minutes in my oven.  I did add 1/4 tsp mint extract before adding the dry ingredients and I used the Andes creme de menthe baking chips on top (no need to spread just place on top and they melt beautifully).

Very easy and nice looking cookie. My young children were able to do a lot of the "work" involved in baking these so they are great for family baking. The flavor didn't knock my socks off but it was good.

Just made this cookie and can't think of words to tell you how yummy it is.  The flavor is very much like Girl Scout chocolate mint but the cookies is softer, not a hard wafer.  It's going into my top 5 cookie recipes.

Great cookie!  I used the mint truffle Hershey's Kisses and it was amazing.  Tried peanut butter cups, but didn't like that as well.  Mint definitely does the trick.  Will certainly make again.

I stole this recipe out of my mom's recipe box AGES ago and wondered if it had made it online...and it did! :)  (amazing how it's almost identical...I think she got it out of a magazine)  So yummy.  Made them for some coworkers for the first time this week and got rave reviews!  Fudgy, chewy, and minty goodness!

These are delicious and chewy, and taste like girl scouts thin mint cookies, but better.  You can use the mint and chocolate chips that nestle puts out at Xmas time, or Andes and they taste the same.  Love them!

I made these tonight for a Christmas Cookie Exchange party.  I had a feeling these were going to be amazing, and they really are! I also read another review where if you don't want to put Andes mints on top, you could put the cherry filled candies as well.  The cookies are wonderful. I also made sure not to overmelt the butter, rather keep it the lowest heat possible and continuously stir. The cookies came out perfect!

Love these! Really great flavor. Mine weren't flat and crispy like others stated, I was worried about that after reading the reviews..but for some reason mine came out perfect. I made the recipe just as stated. I used my Pampered Chef "small scoop" and it made about 50 cookies (needing 25 Andes Mints). Will def. make these often, rave reviews! Thanks a lot for sharing!!!

Great cookies! Using a melon baller makes it so much easier than rolling into balls- and you could cut the Andes mints into 3 pieces. I actually got almost 100 cookies out of 1 batch, so luckily I had some Andes mint chips to use when I ran out of the wafers.

These are really good.....I used the Andes baking pieces......Which was a pain in the butt....Trying to get the pieces to stay on top of the puffy cookie.....Next time I will use half a real (rectangle) Andes or horizontally cut a York patty mint.....Very good cookie though.  Make sure you use good semi sweet chips.....b/c the chocolate flavor really comes out......

These are fantastic! I melt the butter, sugar, water and choc. chips in the microwave. The only thing I change is to add 1 tsp vanilla.  I scoop out w/the Pampered Chef small cookie scoop, bake for 8 minutes, then put a whole Andes mint on top as soon as removing from the oven. By the time I have put the mint on the last cookie on the sheet, I go back and swirl w/a spoon. I then transfer the cookies (on the parchment they were baked on) to a cool cookie sheet & put in the freezer for 5-10 min or so until the chocolate has set. These are great at room temperature or straight from the freezer!  My only complaint is that the cookies come out a little flatter than I wish, but it sure isn't a deal breaker! I'll keep baking these over & over again.  Thanks for a great recipe. **ADDED: I have also used Hershey's mint kisses with good results. We like the Andes the best, though**

These tasted really good, my only problem (and not sure anyone else had this issue) was that the mints did NOT melt, even when I put them back in the oven for a few minutes!!!  Other than that, they were yummy!

Made according to the recipe and baked for 8.5 minutes.  Perfect!  I have worked my way through the to 20 cookie recipes on this site and was wanting something different.  My son wanted a mint-chocolate variety and I scored on my first try.  Thanks Susan!

These were really easy to make and taste great!  I had to bake them for about 9-10 minutes.  Not too much mint and the cookie texture was really nice.

So good!  We put the whole Andes mint on top and then crunched up some candy cane candies on top for a little color.  These are ever so tasty if you happen to like mint.  I added a drop or so of peppermint oil to the batter after adding the chocolate chips.  Delicious!  And they freeze very well, too!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and the cookies were fabulous!  I baked for 9 minutes (using dark, non-stick sheets) and the timing was perfect.  Don't worry about leaving the cookies on the sheet to cool with the mint on top; the center stays soft and chewy for days.  For me, this recipe yielded 4 and a half dozen fairly large cookies.  Huge hit, will definitely be adding these to the rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Hint: you can use all the flavors of the Andes Mints that they sell. I have used the cherry and the white mint with just as much luck. I have made these for years. Target usually has ALL the flavors available between Thanksgiving and Christmas. (I was just there 11/17, and they had 4 flavors...chocolate, white mint, toffee, and cherry).

Delicious.  I love anything mint.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and mixed in by hand a package of Andes mint pieces after the dry ingredients were added.  Much easier than cutting and frosting the cookies and the taste is just as good, also the bits of green mint that show through are attractive.  I forgot to chill the batter first, just baked the cookies right after mixing. I also used a small cookie scoop rather than rolling the dough, another time saver. They look just fine to me and more important, they taste wonderful.

I made these tonight for my boyfriend and his buddies and they turned out exactly like the photos...and tasted great!  I did refrigerate the dough for about 10 minutes before I used a small cookie scoop to form them.  They look like I put a lot of effort into them.  Will use this again!

These are very good but the reason I rated 4 instead of 5 is it's the topping that makes the cookie. Without the melted candy the cookie is just ok.

UPDATE #2: SENT MY BF W/ SOME OF THESE TO SHARE AT WORK. HIS MOM (A DIABETIC) HAD 2!!! UPDATE: THESE ARE W-I-C-K-E-D GOOD IF YOU LET THEM SIT FOR A COUPLE DAYS. MY BF & I DIDN'T CARE FOR THESE HOT OUT OF THE OVEN BUT WE DO NOW!!! THE MINT FLAVOR INTENSIFIES W/ TIME, MAKING THEM TASTE LIKE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!!!!! Good cookie! Made these w/ my niece Sat. night. Every time my sister & her family come to visit (she has 2 kiddos - one of them LOVES to cook!) it is a tradition for my nieces to spend 1 night w/ me. We usually bake a batch of cookies & then watch a movie or play Rock Band... lol. These were not only EASY to make (my niece practically made them herself), but also very tasty! Many cooks have offered great tips & tricks for those interested in reading all of the reviews. The tips most helpful to me were Joelle B. & DenaB's (thanks!). I made 20 decent sized cookies using my 3 T Pampered Chef cookie scoop. It took 9 min. for my cookies to bake to perfection - a slightly chewy, brownie-like consistency. I used Andes creme de menthe wafers (1 per cookie), but would have liked to have tried w/ another variety (I thought I saw Andes raspberry & caramel varieties b4, but couldn't find them at the store... perhaps these flavors are seasonal???). Overall good cookie, but the mint taste was a bit weak (IMHO). I think I'll add 1/4 t mint extract or 1/2 semi-sweet / 1/2 mint choc. chips next time to jazz these up a bit. Thx. :)

The cookies, even without the topping, are phenomenal - very moist, with a rich chocolate flavor. I've tried a few different toppings on the chocolate cookies, and every one has been a hit. I really like mixing up a confectioner's sugar glaze, adding a drop of green food coloring & a bit of mint extract & drizzling it over the cookies.

About half way through baking I didn't like how flat they were so I decided to use a mini muffin pan. These cookies were moister and more chewy than the cookie tray ones.  I ran out of Andes Candies about half way so I used chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and Dove Chocolate candies.  All of them were lovely but not as wonderful as the Andes Candies.  I wish I would have read the review about the chocolate covered cherries before I went shopping.  Chocolate covered cherries would be amazing in these cookies.  Next Time!

Wow. this cookie is just amazing. Just fantastic. The only tweak I made was to also chop up some Andes mints and add it to the mix. What I loved about the cookie was the "frosting". What i usually hate about cookies that have frostings is that they dont dry in a good way. They get crumbly or stay wet so that you can't stack them. Using the andes mint as the frosting is brilliant. It turns back to a chocolate after cooling and gives the cookie a really yummy mint kick. I suggest though that if you do add andes mints to the batter, that you don't add peppermint extract. That would be way too minty. I cant wait to find the cherry andes to make this cookies with. I am also going to try it with white choclate chips in the future. Everyone must try this recipe. It is perfect for everything. Also turns out very pretty.

these were great! very easy to make!

I did pop the chocolate mix into the freezer to cool it down quickly because I was worried I'd scramble the eggs.

For those who complain about flat cookies, make sure you don't use a mixer! It's imperative to mix by hand!

I had trouble getting the cookies into the oven, the dough was so good. I used Andes mints and had to stir a bit more to make sure everything mixed well before I added my dry ingredients. I was making these as a surprise for my husband while he ran out on an errand so I put the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes. I mixed the dough every 5 minutes to make sure it all cooled even. The dough rolled up nicely and my husband gobbled the cookies right up!

If I could give this 4.5 stars I would. The cookies come out incredibly well, moist and chewy, just like a brownie, but the "frosting" was the part I wasn't super thrilled with. I used two different types of mints, to see which worked best, and the Andes were better. But I still think maybe I would like some melted chocolate with peppermint extract instead of an actual mint. 

I also used a double boiler instead of melting the butter, sugar, water and chocolate directly into a pan. I thought it would help shield the chocolate a little better and prevent it from burning.  Warning though, this batter is very very thick, and it was difficult for my hand mixer to get through it. 

Overall though, these are a huge hit, and I will be making them again.

These cookies are as good as reviewed!  We loved them.  I made some with traditional Andes Mints and some with the Andes Mint Parfaits.  We thought the Mint Parfait cookies came out much prettier because they are more "minty" in color.  I would make them again with the Parfaits!  YUMMY!

I'm giving these cookies 5 stars because everyone who ate them loved them, although I'm not a big fan of Mint, but I still new they made a good cookie. The only thing I'd recommend is that if your packaging them with other cookies, they give the other cookies a minty taste, so I would just package them alone. Made a great christmas cookie!

Really good cookies! I took the advice of others and added some mint extract to the dough. I broke an Ande's Mint in half and just pressed it into the warm cookie. Next time I will melt it around to look more like the picture so you don't have just a lump of the mint chocolate. Will defiantly make again!

These cookies are so yummy!I just got the last pan out of the oven and I think I found my new favorite cookie. I used 2 boxes of Andes Mints, which when you break them in half makes 96. This recipe makes lots of dough and I ran out of mints so I used mint chocolate kisses on a dozen of them, they weren't as good as the ones with Andes mints. I put the cookies in the frig on cooling racks and this set the chocolate so the cookies are easier to store. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am not a fan of chocolate and these were the best cookies I have ever had.  They are really easy.  Just plan to let the dough sit for an hour before baking.

Fantastic!!!  I made these and shipped them to Afganistan for my son who is serving over there.  They shipped well and he loved them.  All of us here on the homefront loved them also.

I made these around Christmas and everyone seemed to like them. I used the Andes mints, but ran out and used the Hershey mint minis. They both worked, but the Hershey's looked a little crystalized after they set. I also thought that the cookie would have been better if it wasn't so flat.

WOW!  These are probably the best cookies I've ever made.  They melt in your mouth.  I would HIGHLY recommend a standing mixer for this one--the dough had my hand mixer smoking!  But they were definately worth it!

These were every bit as good as everyone said.  I'm so excited to give them to friends, especially the one who buys boxes and boxes of my daughters Girl Scout cookies at cookie time.  They really do taste very much like the Thin Mints everyone craves.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Change nothing!! These are fabulous, and I now have a new favorite cookie. They are (taste-wise) similar to Girl Scouts thin mints, but only all grown up. I will absolutely make these again!

I made these tonight and they are soooo good! Soft in the middle with a little bit of crispness to the outside.... they're fantastic! And they're so cute and little too! (I used a melon baller to shape them.) 
AND this recipe made about 112 cookies! Perfect for my Christmas parties coming up!

The cookie was like a brownie - the andes mint melts quickly in just a minute or two and spreads easily.  I baked a triple batch for a cookie swap party - perfect! a huge hit!  My party theme was mint.  We had cookies and cocktails - mint cookies, candy canes everywhere, mint bourbon iced tea.....great!!!!!

Very good chocolate cookie. Quite popular, and more than one person said they tasted like Girl Scout cookies. Lends itself to lots of variations, too, and super easy to make. A keeper.

After chilling for 1 hour the dough was very crumbly, and after baking the cookies were also crumbly. They had great flavor but the consistancy of the dough wasn't there. Maybe I just suck at cooking.

Great taste - very brownie-like.  However, they rose very high in the oven, but when removed, they flattened to almost nothing. (I may try a bit more flour next time.) I used junior mints, which looked terrible when spread, so I just pushed it into the cookie and left it like that.  This made a lot of cookies!  Thanks for sharing.

Really YUMMY, easy and fun to make...we got 6 dozen, which I thought was right b/c the recipe calls for 36 mints, which we divided in 2...anyway, we topped ours with some crushed candy canes to make more festive, am taking 4 dozen to a cookie exchange, and they look and taste great!  Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of refrigerating longer than 1 hour...got caught up in other holiday activities, but just picked up where we left off and they turned out perfect!  One of our new holiday favorites, will be making a second batch for teachers next week!

These are wonderful and really easy to make.  On the recommendation of other reviewers, I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and it adds a nice touch - especially for Christmas.  I was worried about them being undercooked when I took them out after 10 minutes, but they were fine.  Soft and chewy!

These are wonderful!!  Have made these for years.  Use Andre mints, put them on as soon as the cookies come out of the oven and let them melt on their own and they will spread easily! Leave some cookies plain for those who are mint lovers (like my daughter and son-in-law). They also freeze really well so you can save some for later if you can get yourself to save any.  Also I use a full piece of mint on each cookie for a a thicker frosting and mintier taste!!!!!

I couldn't believe how easy these were to make! I was hesitant about putting half a Andes chocolate on top but it worked perfectly. To shape the dough I used a teaspoon and then rolled it, perfect size! Delicious!

These are delicious. They come out of the oven looking under cooked at 8-10 minutes but firm up nicely after cooling. Finding Andes or other chocolate dinner mints close to Christmas is impossible. I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate squares and cut them in fourths. Worked perfectly.

I made this recipe  as written but baked them a little differently. I baked the cookies 9 mins. Then I took them out added the half mint. Put back in oven for another 1 or 2 mins. Took them out swirled the mint with a toothpick to make a little chocolate puddle then sprinkled crush candy canes on the melted chocolate puddle.  Even my hubby commented how good these cookies are. Ive had this type cookie before but not this recipe. This is a keeper for any Christmas cookie tray.  Perfect!!!!

I love the way these cookies came out! Great texture and flavor. I felt they were too minty (though some said wait until they are completely cool). However,  I didn't use Andes because I don't care for their mints (I'm a mint snob). I used Munson's (only in New England) mini mint patties They are my favorite. Could be too much for these cookies. I may try other mints (maybe even Andes). I only baked 3 to taste. The rest of the dough is in the freezer, and I can adjust the mint issue. I cannot rave ENOUGH about the cookie component! Just perfect. I followed the recipe to a T and no issues at all! I will definitely make again.

Made these a few days ago and wow! Got them to stay a little soft, but the taste is incredible. Just the right amount of mint in the flavor to make the cookie almost refreshing but not like you mixed Listerine into the batter.

Delicious! Like a thin mint only way better! At first I tried to cheat and MIX chopped Andes in with the batter, but once I finished the cookies they weren't minty enough so I put the candy on the top to melt. WOW, so good with them mixed in and melted on top! One thing I would do different is shape into balls BEFORE I chill the dough because once the dough was chilled I had a heck of a time scooping it (in fairness I chilled it all night). I had to let it sit out awhile. My cookies came out a bit flat, but they were super good so I won't try to fix that. I took them out of the oven when they still looked raw, and they cooled nice and chewy. Really good cookies!

These cookies were fantastic. Chocolate cookies don't usually temp me, but I couldn't stay away from these. I added 3/4 teaspoon espresso powder to the butter/chocolate mixture to enhance the chocolate flavor.  Also, I made some of the cookies with the Andes mints and some with Hershey's tuxedo kisses. I didn't spread the kisses, but rather left them in their kiss form. The white kiss was a nice visual contrast to the chocolate and the flavor was delicious! I'm making more of each variety for New Year's Eve party favors.  I'll add stickers to my treat bags that say, "Kiss 2017 bye-bye" and "2018 is 'mint' to be fabulous".

Delicious! Rather than spreading a mint candy over the top, I stuck peppermint Hershey's kisses in the center after baking (like you do with a chocolate kiss in a peanut butter thumbprint cookie).

WOW .... This recipe was incredible. Super easy to prep, and fun to finish after they come out of the oven. I created a few different toppings like, 
Peanut Butter Chocolate (melted peanut butter with chocolate chips, swirled and spooned a dab on top of the cookies)
Also... 
White Chocolate Raspberry 
(Melted white chocolate chips, added a few tbsp of good raspberry jam)

Have fun and be creative :)

These are SO delicious!!  They quickly became the family favorite and I had to made them again right after the holidays.  I followed the recipe almost exactly--I couldn't find any of the Andes candy mints so I bought the Andes chips (in the baking section with the chocolate chips) and added about a cupful in the batter and then put them on the top of the cookies when they came out of the oven.  They melted and I spread them around.  These cookies are awesome!  Highly recommend them.

These were a huge hit!  They are delicious!  

If you had a problem with flat cookies it is because the dough wasn't cold enough. If you are in a hurry to bake them,  roll the cookies, put them on a pan then put them in the freezer  for 15 minutes or so they will get cold faster.

This was a hit with a kid crowd but not with me.  I couldn't get past the poor quality green foiled mint chocolates used as a frosting.  I guess that is my fault for not using a top quality chocolate.  Four stars because the kids loved them.

Good cookie but I made the mistake of using what I had on hand, a peppermint kiss, not many takers for that. In fact I saw where most pulled off the candy and just ate the cookie. I would make these again just use what others recommended.

This is a delicious recipe! When I made them I didn't have any chocolate mint wafer candies. So instead I put 1/4 tsp of mint extract into my chocolate mixture while it was still on the stove. They turned out awesome!

These are tasty little treats! I followed directions except I added a splash of mint extract to the batter after adding the egg (note to self: next time turn off the mixer first, having mint extract thrown back into my eyes is one of my most painful experiences to date!) I took the cookies out after 8 min although they looked a little soft to me; I should have gone with my gut and left them in another 1-2 minutes. They're still perfectly good, but the center is kind of gooey and not completely baked. Very brownie-like texture, and even with the mint extract added the mint is a mild complement to the chocolate.

Ridiculously delish cookies. Tip for pretty green minty swirls on top of cookie: let the Andes (or other candy) mints melt on warm cookie for a minute, flip candy over and swirl with toothpick.

These are delicious! The only type of candies I could find were ghirardelli dark chocolate with white mint filling but they worked out really well - as someone else said, you only need 18 since you break them in half. The mint flavor was obvious but not at all overpowering. I was making them for Valentine's Day so I added some festive sprinkles, too. I baked them for 9 minutes but think I could have even done 10. It helped to put them in the fridge for at least an hour to let the mint candy/topping fully cool.

I really like these.  I am a beginner cook, and this was my first attempt at cookies.   I did over cook some, so some came out crispy, and some came out soft, both are equally good IMHO.  used the After 8 Mint patties and they melted nicely for the most part (some of the cookies were already cooling, so I put them in the oven a few seconds to melt the candy).  I will definitely make this again!

This is such an excellent and versatile recipe!!  I did not use the mint candies.  I split my batch in 1/2.  I folded mini M&Ms into one 1/2 and rolled the other half into ping-pong sized balls wrapped around coffee flavored chocolates.  These cookies were moist even into the next day.

I can't wait to make these again and I highly recommend these.

I made these with self-rising flour, omitting the salt and baking soda, hoping they would be okay. I also used 1 C of chocolate chips and 1 C of Andes mint chips since that was all I had. The cookies were still delicious!

What a fabulous cookie!  Using the microwave made this so much easier!  I put the butter, brown sugar and water in the microwave for 1 minute, stirred until the butter was melted, then added the chocolate (see below) and cooked another minute.  I made do with what I had on hand, so I used 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of the Andes baking pieces.  It made the dough nice and minty!  When they were done baking, I put about a  measuring teaspoon of the Andes baking bits on top for a few minutes before spreading them to make the frosting.  I know some of you used the Andes bits in the cookie and not as a frosting, but to me the frosting makes it a 5-star recipe!  I plan to use the green Andes mints at Christmas for the top and take these along to our cookie exchange.  Highly recommended!

These were wonderful! I think the brown sugar instead of the typical white sugar is the key to these cookies being really moist. I couldn't find Andes mints so I used Ghirardelli mint squares. They were fantastic! I followed the instructions for half the batch, spreading the candy on top once it melted, but for the other half I put a whole candy on top and just slightly pressed it into the still-warm cookie to keep it in place and then let them cool. For those of you familiar with Ghirardelli chocolates, the have a label with an eagle on top and they looked really cool with the image preserved. I want to try these now with other kinds of Ghirardelli chocolates (caramel, raspberry, etc.). Great staple recipe!

This cookie is fabulous.  I did it both ways, by adding a few mint chips on top and spreading it as a frosting and also by eliminating the frosting and adding the chips into the batter.  Both ways are excellent.  This is being into the cookie trays that we are baking as a fundraiser!  Its that good!!!

OH MY GOSH!!  I absolutely LOVE these cookies - and so does anyone that has one when I make them.  Similar to the famous 'thin mint' cookie - only waaay better.  Only thing that I have substituted in the past while making these is I will sometimes add some mini chocolate chips to the dough before rolling (if I have them)  but you don't even have to do this - the recipe is great either way!!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

These were SO good!  Used Andes Mints which were perfect in flavor and texture for melting.  While delicious and chewy, they did turn out cracker-flat.  I think I may have melted the butter too much.  Next time I will follow the review of many others on here and do the butter, sugar and water in the microwave for 1 minute, then whisk until butter is melted.  Add the chocolate chips, microwave another 30 seconds and whisk until melted.  Also, must let cool very well before storing, or the topping will melt onto anything that touches them.  EDIT:  Tried these again and made sure not to over-melt the butter, using the method I posted before.  Didn't work.  They still turned out cracker-flat.  What on earth am I doing wrong??  Maybe I need to cook them a little longer?  I have no idea!  I also tried using the Andes peppermint bits for the top and it did not work at all.  They do not melt and just looked awful.  Definitely stick to the regular Andes.

I would actually give it 4.5 stars, because it is really good and the only thing I have to criticize is, that I expected it to be more minty. That's why I am going to try and add 1/4 tsp mint extract to the cookie batter next time. I had it in the oven for 9 minutes and they turned out perfect. Easy and yummy recipe!

This cookie is excellent! I didn't have high expectations for much of a minty flavor but the whole cookie tasted like mint despite only having mint in the frosting. A co-worker of mine and I agreed that it tasted like Christmas.

Yum, Yum... I had these at a BBQ and searched out a recipe for them and this one is it! I added 1/4 peppermint extract as another reviewer had suggested.  I also had bought junior mints not knowing which candy was on top and they worked just fine... next time I will try the Andes mints to cmpare ease of melting/spreading.

These little gems are wonderful! So easy to mix! up. I used my small scoop to form the balls and that cuts the work in 1/2. I didn't have Andes style mints so I used Mint White Chocolate wafers. They look so pretty and taste delicious! A definite keeper. But because they are so rich, I will probably reserve them for special occassions rather than use it as an every day cookie.

Awesome recipe. I follwed someone else's advice and added 1/4 TSP ofmint extract. I also made my balls really big so 1 batch only made 18 cookies, and were baked for 11 minutes. I also used 2 Andes candies for each cookie. So if you like big cookies double the batch and buy more Andes!

To die for ! I used peppermint chocolate and mixed it in with the semisweet chocolates in the saucepan. I did try topping the cookies off with the chocolate, but I think that way is too messy when storing them. Next time I'd put all of the flavoring in the saucepan, Rather than topping the cookies with chocolate, I'd use peppermints that were crused to top it off ! This is soo good. The best chocolate cookie recipe : )

These cookies are awesome! I didn't change the recipe except that instead of Andes, I used dark chocolate squares with white mint filling. This recipe made 4 dozen, and I did big cookies too! I made these for my mother for her birthday instead of a cake. She told me that they were better than a cake. I would definitely make these again. Yum!

The first pan I made didn't flatten out quite enough, so the mint on top kept sliding off.  For the rest of the batch, I flattened the ball of dough a bit -- problem solved!  I used traditional andes mints, half a mint on each cookie.  YUM!

My first batch at 9:30 cooking time were undercooked; the next batch at about 11:00 minutes cooking time were much better.  Andes mints were not available, so I used Hershey's mint chocolate chips (about 5 per cookie) and smeared them in a spiral with a plastic spoon.  I used margarine and my cookies were a bit flatter... don't know if that was the reason or not.  I stuffed peppermint candy cane ice cream between 2 cookies and made little ice cream sandwiches which were DELICIOUS.

These are sooooo good!  My husband loves anything mint and chocote (and so do I), so these were a huge hit.  Everyone who tried them thought they were awesome!  I ended up having alot of Andes candies left over, so I would say that you could put one whole mint on top of each cookie for extra minty deliciousness. :)

Loved the recipe, but i altered it a bit. After i added the dry ingredients, i stirred in a bag of andre's mint chocolate chips. I had to bake it a bit longer than 10 minutes. They are always a huge hit!

Oh, my!  These are unbelievably tasty!  Per others suggestions, I also added about 1 tsp of mint to the dough just before I added the eggs. Rather than 1/2 mint per cookie, I used a whole mint per cookie; just laid it on top as soon as the cookies came out of the oven, let it melt for a minute or two and then smoothed it out with my knife.  I substituted milk chocolate chips for half of the semisweet chips, and they were great!  Thanks for a fabulous cookie recipe!!!

I just made these and they are awesome!!  My family is a big fan of mint/chocolate flavour so it's a big hit here at home.  I followed the recipe as is and this batch made me 55 cookies - about 2" wide.  I am including these in my xmas batch this year!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I have made these cookies 2 years in a row for my holiday cookie exchange and they are always a huge hit.  They are so yummy and pretty-looking especially if you add the crushed candy cane on the top.

SOOOO ooey-gooey and yummy!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 tsp. of mint extract right after adding the eggs.  I will definitely make these again...can't wait to try it with the cherry andes. :)

These cookies are awesome.  Hershey had a pepperment kiss out last Christmas, and I used those by putting them on top of the cookies as they were coming out of the oven.  They melted and kind of made a circle of mint chocolate on the top.  Then, after they had cooled, the mint was kind of chewy.  Awesome.  I couldnt stop eating them.  I actually bought several bags of the kissed so I could continue making them throughout the year.  They are fabulous.  Im hoping Hershey has them again this year.

These taste more like cake than cookie, but still good. I took to a family function and no one really touched them. Oh well. My hubby and niece liked them.

OMG - these cookies were awesome! This is my new favorite cookie!  If you like Girl Scout Thin Mints, you can't help but love these cookies.  Keep them in the fridge - they are great cold right out of the fridge.

Oh, the flavor and aroma is truly wonderful, even with the regular Hershey's chips!  I followed the recipe exactly and made sure to chill my dough thoroughly; the 1T size cookies made a flatter, crispier cookie, the 2T size is more puffed and chewier.  I used Junior Mints instead of the Andes-could only find the creme de menthe Andes and did not want that green color for my purposes-and found that "squishing" the junior mint a bit to crack it before putting it on top the cookie helped it melt and spread a bit better.  The junior mint size matched better to the 1 T cookie.  Using a measured scoop and a double batch yielded 96 1T cookies (with no snitching lol)    My best idea was using peppermint-flavored Decors to add some color and even more interest-just sprinkled it onto the melted mints on top.  My husband loved these and wanted 4 dozen to take to work; and I am going to be shipping some to my brother in Iraq.     For the last dozen I ran out of junior mints and just dipped the cookie dough balls into a dish of the Decor sprinkles before baking.  I think these will ship better, were much quicker, and just about as pretty.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe, it is definitely Christmas Cookie material~!

These were really good!  I needed to cook them way longer than 8-10 minutes but that could've been my oven.  14 minutes in my oven and they still came out chewy.  18 minutes and they were a little overdone but everyone loved them.

This is literally one of the best cookie recipes I've ever tried. A couple friends and I made these cookies tonight because we were craving something chocolaty with a wonderful hint of mint and this was just what we were looking for. Because we didn't have any mint candies, we instead used a bit of mint extract and they turned out very well! I highly recommend these cookies to anyone who is looking for delicious and easy to prepare cookies.

Followed recipe as is and these are pretty good. I was able to keep dough in the freezer and just cut off a chunk and bake a dozen when ever I had that thin mint craving! I used Andes baking chips on the top and had no problem with them melting. Took 3 dozen to a BBQ for Mothers Day and they disappeared fast.

Absolutely unbelievably delicious.  I want to make these every day, but alas, I don't want to get my friends and myself chubby. :)  No suggestions as far as recipe modifications thus far... they seem to be perfect the way they are already.

Horribly unhealthy for you but SO delicious!  I made these for my cousin's birthday and there were almost NONE left!  I found Andes chips (in the baking aisle at Walmart), so instead of melting 2 c. chocolate chips, I melted 1 c. regular chocolate chips and 1 c. of the Andes chips. I added the rest of the bag (plus some of a second bag) into the dough and skipped the topping altogether.  People were comparing these to Girl Scout Thin Mints "but softer and better!"

it's worth mentioning - for cautious cooks like me! - that because of the melted chocolate/butter/sugar, the dough could be very runny after you add the flour, before you chill it in the fridge. It will, though, harden up a lot as the chocolate sets.  I was freaked out by how liquid it looked in the mixing bowl and ended up adding at least another cup of flour until it looked like cookie dough rather than chocolate sauce - after the chilling, i had to scoop the dough with a spoon to make the balls. But it still tasted great, if not quite so soft! I will make again and this time have faith in the recipe...

Wow!  I am a terrible baker, and needed a cookie to bring to a holiday cookie exchange.  I made these and I can't tell you how wonderful they came out!  Out of 18 different cookies everyone couldn't stop raving about my cookies.  They taste like Thin Mint girl scout cookies, but even better...I know, I didn't think it was possible either!  Also, if you keep them in a tupperware container in your refrigerator they keep for as long as you can keep from eating them!  The only change I made to the recipe is that I used a full Andes mint on each one instead of breaking them in half.  You will not be dissapointed by these!

These were pretty good cookies. I did as others did and added some of the chopped mint pieces to the mix. I also sprinkled the pieces on top of the warm cookies. If you like mint, you'll like these cookies.

I made these for christmas cookies this year.  They were wonderful.  Since I was snowed in the day I decided to make them, I used mint truffle kisses since I had them on hand.  I ground them in my food processor and then melted batch amounts in the microwave and spread it on the cookies after they cooled.  This allowed me to control the presentation a little better.  The first one I tried to melt the candy on and then spread and it flattened the cookie.  I think that may be the problem that some people are having.  Other than that one, all my cookies were puffy.

These are knock-down, drag-out AMAZING cookies.  I did use Butter-flavor Crisco (just makes a better lookin' cookie!).  MILK choc chips, and therefore cut the brown sugar to one cup.  Milk instead of water.  And, Andes Baking Chips.  (Mixed some in with the dough).  Then, sprinkled the Andes Baking Chips over the hot cookies and spread.  IF these last until Xmas, I know they'll be requested year after year.

These were OK.  I only had 1 cup of chocolate chips so I substituted 1/2 cup cocoa for the other cup.  The cookies turned out really flat...even though I chilled the dough and even chilled the rolled batter before I baked them on cool pans.  The peppermint patties did not melt enough to swirl around on the cookies.  I even tried to place the candies on the cookies 5 minutes into baking.  This only made the cookies come out even flatter.

Very good cookies! This recipe made 7.5 dozen so I had to use 45 chocolate mint wafer candies. Very well liked.

These were wonderful. I used 1/2 c wheat flour in place of all-purpose, but I may try more next time. I freeze all my cookies, so I haven't had any trouble with them drying. I've been taking them out in the morning to pack in lunches, and they aren't dry at all then.

These cookies are amazing just as others have noted!  I did decide to make a few changes to make them more healthy.  I replaced 1/3 of the butter with applesauce, replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, and added 1 cup of thinly grated zucchini and a dash of wheat germ. I will make them again for sure!

Let me just start out by saying that I'm not a chocolate lover...despite that, these cookies were amazing! They certainly didn't last long in my house. Great recipe!
I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used regular granulated sugar...came out great.

Very good flavor.  A little dry though.  I took andes mints and put them in a Wilton bottle for melting chocolate candy and melted the mints in the microwave by heating it for 20 seconds then shaking then putting it in for another 20 seconds till all melted.  Then I squirted the mints in criss cross design all over the cookie...they looked great :) and tasted pretty good too!

These cookies are so good (I LOVE mint) and turned out great.  I did try to chop and mix the rest of the mints into the last batch and they were too runny.  Leaving them on the top was much better!  I will make these again!

These cookies are delicious!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated and I thought they were excellent!  I brought them to a Christmas party and I got lots of requests for the recipe and I came home with an empty plate!  This cookie will be a regular on my baking list! Thanks!

These cookies were SO SO good!  Almost like little brownie bites.  As did some other reviewers, I made a couple modifications to the directions of the recipe in order to make an already simple recipe even more simplified.  I did not cook the butter/sugar/water/chocolate mixture on the stove.  I did all of the heating in the microwave.  In a glass bowl on high heat, I cooked the butter, sugar and water for one minute, stirred well.  Then I added the chocolate chips, stirred well, and cooked at high again for one minute.  Then I stirred it again until the chips were completely melted into the mixture.  From there I followed the directions exactly.  I used whole broken up "After Eight" mints on some and used a really delicious chocolate orange truffle bar on some of the others.  They were fantastic and very easy to make.  I will definitely be making these again.  My thighs thank you for sharing the recipe!! :)

I made these last year during the holidays and they are SOO GOOD! They end up tasting like a chewy Thin Mint. YUM!
Only thing is make sure you store them in an airtight container or a ziplock baggy because if the air gets to them they get a bit hard.

Wow what a great mint cookie. Nice fudgy flavor,chewy and just the right amount of mint without the addition of mint extract. My son loves anything mint and this will be a keeper for Holiday cookies in our house. Nice Job.

These cookies are chewy and delicious! When I first made the dough I was concerned because it tasted bland to me.  But after we baked them and let the Andes mints melt on...they are out of this world! I am going to make them for a holiday luncheon this week! UPDATE:  I made these for a bake sale yesterday and they were sold out within the first 30 minutes!  I had at least 10 people ask me to send them the recipe!

Can I just say as Rachel Ray would say "YUM OH" These are delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly...Although like other reviewers I used half of and Andes Mint on them. After I melted the mints on them I took the cookie sheet and stuck it in the freezer until the next batch came out of the oven. This seemed to help freeze the icing just enough to be able to stack them. I also cooked them for just 8minutes and they were perfect!! I am taking them to a cookie exchange this evening and I dont know how many I will have left to take! I made 3dozen.

Another wonderful tasting and super easy recipe from this site!  Loved these cookies!  I followed the recipe as written with good results.  I used a cookie scoop and got just over 5 dozen cookies out of this recipe.  Half an Andes mint didn't sound like much, but it worked out well and had the perfect amount of mint flavor.  I'd like to try these cookies with some other chocolate flavor...if I could find some thin orange chocolate that would work, I think the flavor combination would be devine.  I will be making these cookies again.

These cookies are WONDERFUL: moist, flavorful, and easy. I did as the recipe said with the exception of adding 1/4 tsp. mint extract to the mixture. The cookies would probably be just as good without the extract, just less minty if that is your preference.

These are really good cookies.  I used Andes baking chips and they were hard to get on the cookies without falling off and melting on the hot pan.  Next time I will use normal Andes mints.  I thought 8 minutes was perfect.

Yum!  My husband has declared these his new all time favorite cookie!  I added some mint extract to the dough and could not find Andes candies so just used some mint chocolate.  I think they will be so much better with the andes as they are more minty.

Sooo good and sooo addictive.  We made these last year for Christmas and they are now part of our annual cookie baking fest.  I honestly am not really a fan of the mint/chocolate combination but these rock.  We make them exactly as written.

Delicious! Followed recipe as it was, though I did add just a tad bit of peppermint extract after the egg. (Very minimal, but a noticable boost to the actual cookie!) They tasted like girlscout brownies.

These are delightful!  Everyone tasted them and was asking me how I made them and said how great they were.  I tried some with a whole andes mint and some with a half and I don't really know which way I like them better.  I just know I like them and will be making them again!

These were flat out fantastic. I, like most everyone else, used half an Andes mint on each cookie and it turned out perfect. I also substituted the mint topping with leftover chocolate chips for my friends that don't like mint and they turned out great aswell. The thing I liked best about this cookie is that it tasted a lot like a Girlscout Thinmint, but soft and chewy!

I went to a cocktails and cookies party and brought these. They were the hit of the night. I will be making them again soon. Recipe was easy to follow and I didn't make any alterations.

Delicious!  Everyone loved them and they were easy to make :) I did add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and they turned out great, but I'm not sure how much difference it made.

Well, I've made these 2x this week, & each time they were wonderful. This is the best basic chocolate cookie recipe I've found! Adding the mints on top just makes them that much better! Used the Andes mints as recommened, but am thinking of trying Rolos or something like that next time! Thanks!

Every year at Christmas I add a new cookie recipe to my collection of tried and true recipes.  This year I made these cookies and they were unbelievably good.  I could not keep my hands off of them.  They will definitely make a repeat performance next year.  I made them about a week before Christmas and they still tasted good by New Year's Day.  They probably would have been good for longer but I polished off the rest of 'em!

These cookies are EXCELLENT! They are a huge hit everywhere I take them! The only thing I changed was adding half Hershey's Chocolate Mint chips instead of the full amount of chocolate chips. It made it more minty and very delicious. I also added green sprinkles to the frosting to make it look nice...Thank you!!!

These were delicious!  They were a hit at Christmas.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the butter mixture.  I found that I had to bake 12 minutes on my baking stones.  I didn't have the Andes mints on hand, so I used 1 thin mint (by Necco) on each cookie.  After they were completely cooled, I melted white chocolate and put it into a parchment bag and drizzled it over the tops.  They were very pretty as well as tasty!  They disappeared quickly.  I will definitely be making these again.

These were very easy to make.  I ended up with 100+ cookies out of one batch of dough.  The suggestion to use a mellon baller definitely helped.  I used Andes mints and did not add peppermint extract to the dough.  I would have given them four stars, but I took them to Christmas dinner yesterday and everyone loved them.  Two people asked for the recipe, so I bumped it up to five stars.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for the fact that I left the cookies in the refrigerator overnight... DON'T DO THAT!  They still were delicious, but they were really hard to get out of the bowl (the dough was beyond hard)... and the cookies came out looking weird.  But they tasted so good and I had given them all away, so I made another batch today and put them in the fridge for only an hour.  This batch came out beautiful and delicous.  I would definitely used Andes candies on top and I do not think you need peppermint in the dough.

These turned out so well!  I didn't have enough chocolate chips.  But I had bought chocolate mint pieces to put on the top.  So I used both chocolate chips and the mint chips.  Then I topped them with the mint pieces.  In the future, though, I will use the larger mints.  The little mints were a bit hard to handle.  But I didn't lose anything in the taste!

Wow! What can I say! Simply put this is the best chocolate cookie ever! TIP: If you don't have or can't find Andes Mints (I live in Greece where Andes Mints are unheard of) just melt a chocolate bar in the microwave or in a double boiler with some butter and add peppermint extract to taste. The chocolate topping tasted just like Andes mints!!

This is a keeper! This recipe supposed made 18 "servings".  Not knowing what that meant, I doubled the recipe and am still baking them!  I counted 90 cookies so far.  They came out flatter than the photo showed, but are absolutely wonderful!  I put the cookies in the refrigerator for a short time so that the "frosting" would set quickly and I could store them.

These cookies came out great. My cookies came out 2-2.5 inches wide so half an Andes mint was perfect. I was able to spread the mint about 30 seconds after putting it on the cookie. It quickly melted as I was spreading it but you need to lightly spread it since the cookies will still be soft. I refrigerated it more than an hour and the batter became very hard so I had to leave it out for awhile so it wouldn't be too hard to scoop out.  I was able to make a little more than 4 dozen cookies.

If there were 10 stars, I'd give this all ten.  I LOVE chocolate and mint together, so there were perfect.  They were so easy to make, and the Andes candies melted, then set up so nicely on top of the perfectly round, flat cookie.  YUMMY!!!!!  On Valentines day, I'll try the cherry Andes Candies.

Delicious!  I couldn't find the Andes mint in the store so I had to use After Eight mints - they still worked perfectly and I think I'll use those from now on since they came out so nice!  These were sooooo good!  They will now be one of my 'staples' for parties.  :)

Delicious and travels well.  I added chopped nuts to the batter one time which added a little more character.  Another time, I sprinkled chopped nuts on top of the melted mint once the mint sat for 5 minutes.  In addition, instead of cooking the butter, sugar and water in a pan, I used the microwave and melted the butter (approximately 1 1/2 mins. and then added the chips and microwaves on high for another one minute and then removed the mix and stirred - less clean up and a quicker process.  All in all, an excellent cookie for any time of the year, but especially at the holidays.

I made this cookie for my cookie exchange and everyone liked them.  I added mint extract to the dough as suggested by others.  The chocolate cookie was very easy to make and tastes great.  I would like to try it with other flavors also.  I used a table spoon and the cookies were a good size but the recipe made a lot more than suggested.

These are very rich and delicious! So rich I didn't want to eat more than one at a time, so that was a good thing!!! When I first mixed the dough before chilling it looked almost like brownie batter and I was afraid that it didn't turn out, but it was fine! I used a knife tip to swirl the mint on top.

Loved this recipe!  I used a melon baller as suggested by others, very quick and easy to make into the balls.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and they turned out perfect, just like the photo.  This recipe is a keeper!

Just finished making my cookies for a cookie exchange at work. I wanted to try these out first. I usually hate making cookies because they take so long, but thanks a TON to the person who suggested using a melon baller. I used mine, and it rounded them nicely, as well as sped up the whole process.
Everyone is talking about Andes mints, and I have no clue what these are. I don't think we get them in Newfoundland. So I was really confused as to the type of mint wafer to use. All the mints here have white fillings (After Eights?) and I didn't think they were the right type. So I ended up buying mint chocolate chips, and putting 3 chips on each cookie, and then spreading them when they softened. That worked really well, and they looked like the picture, but someone else said something about a green color with Andes mints. So I am assuming Andes mints have a green filling, and then covered in chocolate? So do you swirl it all together?

Very delicious cookies. I baked mine for 9 minutes and used Andes mints which, because of the green color, gives the melted chocolate a lighter swirl. Very chocolaty and the mint flavor is a surprise.

Great recipe!  I used 1 full Andes chocolate for the icing and they are awesome!  I've had to hide some in the freezer so my husband doesn't eat them all!  I made mine a little big so I had to adjust the cooking time by 5 minutes!

These cookies turned out great.  I removed the cookies from the oven at 8 minutes, when cracks started to appear on the tops of the cookies and they were soft and chewy just like brownies.    If you like crispier cookies I would leave them in for the full ten minutes.  I added 1 tsp of peppermint extract when I added the eggs to give the cookies a stronger mint flavor.

I used Andes mints also and they were perfect.  I ended up chilling for a day and a half and was worried when the consistency was like a thick fudge.  I still went through with them and my daughter said they were the best cookies she's ever tasted in her life.  They were that good.

These have a great flavor but they come out a little crispier than I would have liked, even after only 8 minutes of baking.  I"ll make these again but I wish they were softer.

Just make these--you won't be sorry. As a busy mom, I appreciate how many cookies this recipe makes. I usually can get over 40 cookies! I've started to flash freeze half of them  in round balls and store them to make another time--so great to have them at the ready. I also wasn't sure what "chocolate mint wafer candies" meant, but I can tell you half of a Andes mint works perfectly or also Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate Melting Wafers (found at my local grocery store) work great as well. These look so pretty and kids and adults devour them!

Absolutely perfect recipe, as-is. One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made, and I've made a lot. I did sprinkle crushed candy cane  bits on top for a finishing touch.  Tip:  Roll the dough into about 50 balls -- for 40 cookies, larger cookies than apparently is intended  -- and press the balls slightly, so they are flattened slightly, about 1/2 to 2/3-inch thick discs about two inches wide,  before you drop them onto the cooking sheet. This results in larger but perfectly shaped cookies that cooked to perfection at 10 minutes on the dot.

These cookies are so yummy!  I used a level scoop that held 1 1/2 tbsp to size each cookie and got 43 cookies.  Baked them for about 9 1/2 minutes at 350.  They are very delicate when warm so I let them stay on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring to a cooling surface.  That 2 minutes is a perfect time to put one Andes mint on each cookie.  Smear the melted mint a couple of minutes after removing from the cookie sheet.

Loved these moist cookies.  I could not find Andes and used 1/2 of a Dove Promises Dark Chocolate Mint Swirl.  They took a little longer to melt than an Andy, but same concept.

I have used this site for years and never reviewed a recipe...until now. These cookies were fantastic - easy to make and so delicious!

I could not find wafers so used a Lindt chocolate bar cut into pieces. Wow!  Definitely a 5 star recipe!

It’s a little too rich for me but the dough was very easy to work with. It’s very dry and they don’t spread much do you have to flatten them s tiny bit on the pan before you bake them.  I’d make it for s party or something but not for my house, we couldn’t eat them fast enough due to the richness!

We followed the directions to a T. They turned out perfect. At sea level altitude and a 350*F oven, 10 minutes was the perfect amount of cooking time. They are gooey and minty when eaten 5 min after baking. Yum!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes!  This yields a crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside chocolate cookie.  The recipe, as written, works perfectly every time.  I use Andes mints on top because they melt beautifully, taste great and are easy to find.  I have spread homemade caramel on top of these instead of the mint.  I thought the result was okay but the mint is definitely preferred.  Today, my kids got the great idea of turning these into ice cream sandwiches.  The texture of the cookie is perfect for something like this!  Their idea made me start thinking that this might be the perfect cookie to make homemade Oreo's with.

I have made this recipe for years for Christmas and throughout the year to work.  I have to keep a copy of the recipe handy because they are gone in a heartbeat and everyone wants the recipe.  The only thing that I do differently is to use an entire Andes Mint wafer on each one.  My hubbies all time favorite and I do a ton of baking.

This is my go-to cookie. I have made this cookie more times than I can count. I use Andes mints and cut them in half for each cookie. I have also chopped them up and put them in the batter. It makes for an even stronger flavor. I would totally recommend making this.

Excellent Cookies, I took the advice of others and used Andes Mints.  I also put them in the refrigerator for 15 minutes after I was done frosting the cookies.  YUMMY.

Big hit!  I made the cookie exactly as listed.  Only thing I changed was that I chopped up the Andes Mints, melted in a ziploc bag, cut off the tip of the bag and drizzled the mint chocolate across all the cookies.  Added sprinkles when chocolate was still warm.  It's sets and hardens pretty quickly.  I think it had a better presentation.  Word of caution....don't overcook these.  Definitely better to take out a little undercooked and let them sit for a few minutes.  I will definitely make these again.

These are very good cookies. I will definitely make again. They turned out huge so the next time I will for sure make the dough balls much smaller. The cookies just have such a good taste I wish I had not put the Andes mints on a few of them so I could have tried plain.

Used half semi-sweet and half mint dark chocolate. Let the dough resting one night in the fridge. The dough was quite sticky when put on a tray (with 2 tea spoons, had to use some confectioner's sugar to help)) but the cookies came out perfectly raised and moist. Doubled the proportions for a total of 72 cookies.
Gave only a 4 stars as I think these cookies need a little kick : dark chocolate chips or crushed mint candies in the dough, or as others suggested, to replace the water with cream of mint.

I love this recipe!! I've made it exactly as is and substitutted 2 cups of chocolate chips with Hershey's Mint Chocolate chips for the extra mint flavour. I much prefer the mint chocolate chips. 
 Love the Andes mints for on top.

They were very good cookies. Following another review, I added 1/4 tsp of mint extract after the eggs and it was a great call! Definitely added to the cookies.
Also, we put in some peppermint bark on the cookies instead of chocolate mint wafer candies. They turned out quite well with that (would recommend it, but the Andes mints work well also).

Made exactly as stated.  I used a small cookie baller...... fit 24 per cookie sheet.  Bought 2 packages Andes Mints, broke each piece in half put them on about 1 minute after coming out of oven, waited 4 minutes or so to soften then spread over top with the back of a tsp.  Cooked 9 minutes.  Cooled in fridge on wire rack.  Made about 86.  I can't believe how good these are!  I'm anxious to see what the family thinks comes Christmas!

I make these cookies every year, doubling the batch because they are such a favorite!  They turn out delicious and chewy following the original recipe.  The only thing I did different was use Irish butter instead of traditional butter,  and I baked them at 325 instead of 350.  I will continue to make these for years to come.

Double the recipe for a church potluck.  I used 1 teaspoon per cookie of the Andie's chips instead of the wafers.  Worked pretty well. We left the dough in the fridge for 2 nights and then cut it with a butcher knife before rolling.  Turned out very well.  Making them again for Christmas.

Great-cookies spread out and were flat, but looked and tasted great
1/2 recipe made 36 (use small scoop), added mini-choc chips.  Bake just under 8 min.  Looked perfect!

Just as good without the mini chips mixed in, too

1 full recipe makes about 48 (large scoop).  Flatten slightly.  1 mint per cookie

I made these last Christmas as the recipe was listed. I was a little skeptical when my dough was on the creamier side.  But after letting it cool in the refrigerator  for an hour it stiffened up. Still a little skeptical because I've never worked with dough this consistency. I expected them to be flat disks when they were done baking but I was wrong.  They turned out beautifully. To my husbands surprise,  these were amazing.  All my friends and family loved them.  Great recipe!

I am a novice baker and honestly, more often than not, my baking attempts end with questionable results.  This recipe is so amazing that my cookies turned out perfect!  I even took them to a cookie exchange and won 3rd place. I followed the directions to a tee.  They were so soft and fluffy and the mint on top was heaven.  This is going to be my go-to recipe for cookies.   Baking more right now!  Thank you!

This is, by far, the best cookie recipe I've ever made, and I get more compliments on these cookies than any other that I make.  I've used the recipe exactly as written and had the cookes come out perfectly every time.  I've also used mint or cherry chips in place of the chocolate mint candies and had the cookies turn out beautifully and SO tasty. I love the fudgy texture and flavor of these cookies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Way too  sweet for a cookie that's going to have chocolate candy melted on top. It has a lot of brown sugar in it. which I think didn't even mix, anyway. The dough was pretty tough to work with. I'm not unhappy that I tried them, but I wouldn't make them again.

This was a very dense, rich chocolate cookie recipe, even with half the chocolate chips. So I used 1 cup choc chips instead of 2 for the melted ganache and substituted 1/4 cup cocoa for part of flour. I added mint m&ms instead do Andes mints on top. Baked for 8 minutes yielded a tough cookie...6 minutes was perfect for me.

The store didn't have the chocolate mint wafers, but an equally good recipe can be made by substituting one cup of the chocolate chips with mint chocolate chips, and then after the cookies are baked putting a few mint chocolate chips in the top to make a gooey chocolatey centre. Great recipe served hot with vanilla ice cream!

Add mint extract. Put Andes chips in the mix like chocolate chip cookies or add 1/2 Andes candy about 2 minutes before the end of being to help melt.

these cookies came out wonderful!  I microwaved the butter for 1 minute then stirred in the brown sugar, water, chocolate chips, and microwaved for one more minute.  This was enough to melt everything together well, without overheating the ingredients.  After stirring well, I let the mixture set for 10 minutes.  I used a small cookie scoop and the recipe yielded 6 dozen 1.5" cookies.
The second time I made these using two small cookie scoops for each cookie (4 tsp total), rolling into balls and pressing semi-flat.  This yielded 3 dozen cookies.  8 minutes made them too gooey, 9-10 minutes was just right.  I left them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes after putting a whole Andes mint on each.  Then removed them to a cooling rack and spread the mint around.

Quite good and made the kitchen smell great.  How can you go wrong with chocolate and mint? Gave it a 4 instead of a 5 simply because, while delicious, it's not particularly unique.  A tasty, crowd-pleasing cookie for the holidays or all year round.

Everyone at work LOVES these. Cookie wise they are my favorite. Instead of melting the andes mint candies on top, I chop them up and add it into the batter.

As a puffy, chewy cookie I refrigerate them and eat them cold. Along with the mint, it is a delicious and refreshing treat!

These cookies were so much better than expected!  I also used 2 Cups Andes baking pieces mixed in instead of the candies on top.  We baked them on parchment paper lined cookie sheets and they were perfect!

I made this recipe once before and they came out wonderfully: soft, cute little cookies with a delicious topping. So, i was hugely disappointed when I made them a second time and they came out flat, huge, and stuck to the pan. I did use a butter substitute the second time, so my suggestions are: do not use butter substitutes, and use parchment paper to make your life easier. I will hold out hope that these come out next year when I make them for Christmas, but I think I'll have to give up if they don't. I don't think they're attractive enough for a Christmas cookie plate when they're so flat.

These were great with no changes to the recipe! The second time I made them, I added colored sprinkles after I spread the mints on top, just to make them a little more festive for Christmas. My son doesn't like mint so I used Hershey's chocolate instead. He loved them!

I really like this recipe. While I was at the store, I also picked up the Peppermint Crunch Andes (red and white mints). I thought it might make pretty holiday swirls--I tried it on a few and they don't melt and spread as well as the chocolate and ended up pretty messy. The regular mint ones were really, really nice.

I think I'd rather melt the chocolate mints into the cookie batter and put the chocolate chips in before baking or cut the mints up and bake in the cookies.

These were really great...made exactly as recipe says except used egg whites for one of the eggs.  I think people are right on about not cooking the butter.  My batter was so thick even before I put it in the fridge I could barely get the spoon through it soI had nice puffy cookies.  Next time I will not put andes pushed in in cookie....dont need to..will just leave them on top and let them melt and then swirl them around the rest of the cookie.  I baked for the full 10 minutes.

I am not always a huge chocolate mint fan, but I made these for a co-worker who loves anything chocolate mint. They are delicious! I bring treats to work every so often, and these are always the fastest to be gobbled up. The cookie is thick and brownie-like. I use half of an Andes candy and use a toothpick to swirl it into a circle after it melts a little. Looks a bit like a thumbprint cookie. I'll be adding this to my Christmas cookie list this year.

My husband has always claimed that his favorite cookie is a good, old-fashioned chocolate chip. However, the last two times I've asked him for a dessert suggestion, he has immediately mentioned these. A new favorite, and great with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream!

i have only tasted them (so far) not long after cooking them, but they sure are tasty!  however, they were kinda flatter then i would like, and more crunchy.  i followed recipe exactly (and added 1/4 tsp of mint extract) and read reviews to make sure i made them good. making them smaller (when i put the dough balls on the cookie sheet i made them about the size of one of those rubber balls you get in a 25cent machine) seemed to helped a little.

Great cookie! Received very well at my annual cookie swap. I didn't pay attention to the actual yield of 3 dozen, so when I saw the serving size of 18, I doubled the recipe. Heck of a lot of cookies, but really good. If you like Andes candies, you'll love these, and the chocolate cookie itself is actually really tasty alone.

Followed recipe exactly and cookies were flat and crispy - like chocolate crackers. The mint flavor was overpowering. Tasted okay, but after eating one I didn't want to eat another. Left the candy off after the first batch, added pecans and chocolate chips, and reduced baking time - made them much better.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used Andes for the "chocolate mint wafer candies". My family thought these were delicious, but I thought they were just OK.

I LOVE these cookies! So simple to make, and always a HUGE hit. I like to use Andes Candies for the top/icing and they always come out delicious. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

My family insists on these for Christmas.  I, too, sometimes use the cherry Andes Candies- makes them taste like chocolate covered cherries which I love.  I make it slightly different in that I use only 1 Tblsp of water, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp salt.  I have also found that if the candies are old (left over from last year) that they don't melt as well.

This recipe is wonderful! I had some creme de menthe flavoring so instead of using mint candies I added a half teaspoon to the cookie batter, then I melted some chocolate and added another half teaspoon of flavoring to the chocolate and spread it on top. I was very happy to see how moist these cookies turned out.

Soo good! I followed everything as written except my cookies were small so I ended up cutting the Andes mints into quarters. It was also because I was afraid my one box wouldn't be enough. So luckily the 1/4 pieces were perfect! It was enough of the minty flavor and a good amount to top the cookies. Easy and yummy! I got reviews that they're even better than the Girls Scouts' Thin Mints! :) These will definitely be my next holiday go-to cookie! :D

I love these cookies, but alot people dont like mint cookies i guess. The only this i did different was I used 1 1/2c of choc chips and 1/2c of choc mint baking chips. I didnt use the extract. For some reason it makes double what the recipe says around 32. When thier done i sprinkle a couple mint backing chips on each. Thier so worth making.

Yes, these cookies are flat. It's the nature of the recipe. If you don't want flat cookies, don't make these. Personally, I don't care what a cookie looks like. I find it more important that it tastes good. If you want a delicious cookie regardless of whether or not it's flat; try these. I followed the recipe exactly using Andes mints. They were chewy and yummy not crispy at all like some reviewers' results. Everyone in the house enjoyed them. I'll be adding them to my Christmas staples. Thanks a bunch!

First time I made these, they were awesome!  Even my son who doesn't like mint very much, loved them.  I gave them, along with a few other kinds of cookie, to about a half a dozen people for Christmas and literally EVERY person I gave them to commented that they were so good. They are not exact, but along the lines of a Girl Scout thin mint cookie.

I read other's reviews and figured this must be a delicious recipe - and everyone was right!  This is an amazing cookie recipe!  I was a bit worried because I didn't have quite enough flour, but it turned out just fine.  They were somewhat flat (but I didn't mind) and chewy - which I LOVED!  YUM!    I made two changes - I used mint chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I used hershey's mint mini chocolate pieces for the topping - they came in white chocolate mint, milk chocolate mint, and dark chocolate mint.  The white chocolate mint was the best!  I also covered and refrigerated the dough overnight because I was too tired to make them after letting it set for an hour.  The next day, I set the dough on the counter to soften up and as soon as it was ready to scoop out, I made them!  The recipe made about 4 dozen cookies for me.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!

These are so delicious!!  I'm not even a huge fan of the chocolate-mint combo but these are so good I had a hard time getting myself to stop eating them.  I think the recipe is relatively simple and easy to make.  I made a batch a couple of days ago to freeze for Christmas, but I've discovered that I think these are more delicious frozen than they are room temperature!  I can't keep out of them and I'm going to have to make another batch this week.

Delicious...perfect as written. I refrigerated the dough then used a melon baller to scoop the dough into even portions. My cookies were baked to a chewy consistency after 9 minutes. This is a great recipe to do with kids!

These are perfect and simple to make. I melted chocolate mints and dipped the cookies for extra mint chocolate goodness, let them set up on wax paper. Do yourself a favor and eat one while they're still a little melty. Delicious!!

Absolutely decadent!  The dough can be a bit messy.  It you aren't picky about them being perfectly round, you can just drop them from a teaspoon vs. the rolling.  My new favorite Xmas cookie!

Yummy! I made these for the first time last night for my "Christmas Goodie Baskets" for family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, etc and they were so good I could hardly stay out of them. The recipe made a lot which is great if you are planning on baking, freezing and giving them away during the holidays. More importantly, they were excellent and will be a regular on my Christmas Goodie Trays. I used Ande's Mints and had quite a little production going popping them in and out of the oven, letting the mint's sit a few minutes to melt, then spreading them all around. It's a good thing they were so good because I made a double batch, he he. Thank you Susan

These cookies were AMAZING! I am not normally a huge chocolate cookie fan, but these were the exception. I made them for a tailgate party and they were gone in no time. I could not find Andes mints anywhere when I was buying the ingredients, instead I used Hershey mint truffle kisses that just came out for the holidays and they worked beautifully! They truely do taste like thin mint girl scout cookies.

I followed the recipe to the letter and the cookies turned out AMAZING! I would like to note, though, that if you double the recipe, you will need at least three boxes of Andes Creme de Menthe mints, although the recipe indicates otherwise. I will definitely be making these cookies again and again.

These cookies are great! Like previous reviewers I used the Andes Creme de Minthe IN the batter instead of melting mints on top.  My procedure was a bit different. I didn't chill the dough for an hour or roll the cookies into a ball. I just put them right on pans like normal drop cookies and they turned out great. I will definitely be making these again.

This is the one that started it all, for me.  This is the first recipe I tried on this site.  Nothing has yet surpassed it.  I bet I've made 20 things from this site and these cookies are easily the little kings.  The women at my wife's work have dubbed me Chef Jeff, thanks to these.  I've taken them across 3 states and across the street and everyone absolutely loves them.  I've made them with Andes mints and Pearson's mints.  Andes are the way to go.

I followed the recipe all the way until the last step.  Taking the comments of other viewers, I put Andes Creme de Menthes pieces on the top to give them a greenish touch.  Fabulous.  Made that for my 7 yr old son's school party last friday and it was a hit.  Crispy outside, soft and chewy in the centre with a hint of mint.  Teachers from next doors came it for a piece.  I already received order from my daughter for her girls' gathering next week.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe is great. I also modified this recipe into a chocolate orange cookie. Just follow the directions, except add a teaspoon of orange extract after the chocolate has melted and cooled, and put a half wedge of a Terry's chocolate orange in place of the Andes mint.

I took these to a family gathering and only came home with 6.  These were a HUGE hit.  I was told that they are better than the mint girl scout cookies.  I was very happy with this recipe!  Will use again and again!

I'm not a big chocolate & mint fan, but the group I made these for liked them pretty good.  Be sure to tell people that they have mint in them though because they caught some off guard who thought they were all chocolate.  My cookies did puff up, but cracked all over the top; however, the melted candy hid most of the flaws.

Delicious!!  They also got rave reviews from the people I shared them with at church.  It doesn't say what size to make the cookies, but I used a 1 tbsp. cookie scoop, and it made a ton.  I baked 5 dozen and there is still more dough leftover.  They're great!  Edited to add- it made 7 1/2 dozen (89) cookies.  Next time I'll probably make half a batch!

These are fantastic!  I brought about 85 of them to the office, and they were gone by noon!  People who don't even like chocolate were asking me for the recipe!  You cannot go wrong with these.  I used a whole Hershey "Bliss" piece on each cookie.  At first it looked like the mints wouldn't harden (but stay gooey), but after they fully cooled they were stack-able without any mess.  Definitely try this recipe!

Fantastic cookies. I made one change: I added about 1.5 Tablespoons of cocoa powder (to a half-batch) to make them super-chocolatey. I also used Ghiradelli 60% cocoa chips instead of semi-sweet. They turned out fantastic, thanks for the recipe.

This cookie is absolutely unbelievable--- not to mention easy! The chocolate cookie came out soft and moist, and the mint frosting adds a bit of pizaz! My friends are always begging me to make them. Can't go wrong if you love chocolate and mint together.

They're very good fresh out of the oven, but dry out really quickly. I microwaved them for a few seconds, and that helped a bit, but I don't think I'd make these again. Maybe in a quarter-batch so my family could eat them all fresh from the oven.

These were so good! Next time I'll use a little less flour.. they were a bit dry. I used chocolate chips with mint and mixed them in the dough, turned out great!

Really yummy cookies. I used "After Eight" mint patties, the only ones available to me where I live, and they worked out just fine. I'll be making these more often.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It was not that special.  Wish I had tried adding to the batter instead of melting the mints on top.  Cookies did not look that festive, and the taste was bland.  Might try adding cinnamon.

This cookie taste just like the mint girl scout cookies.  Mine turned out flat even though I listened to other reviews and let the dough cool.  It makes a lot of cookies!  I bought two boxes of andies candies and I ended up cutting the 2nd box into thirds.  They freeze very well.  Excellent recipie for beginers as this was the third cookie that I have made for Christmas.

Just a really delicious cookie. It gets requested a lot during the Holidays around my home. It's a little time consuming "wrapping" the dough around the mint, but so worth it! And pretty to look at with drizzled chocolate-mint on top!

I often think choc. cookies are a bit dry.  These weren't.  They had a nice chewy consistency.  I used my cookie scoop instead of rolling balls, so it went really quickly.  It made about 80 cookie-scoop size cookies.

THE BEST COOKIE EVER! this cookie is very easy but sounds hard. i dont know if you have "after 8" mints in the usa but that is what i used and they were wonderful. after 8 is like a very thin peppermint patty. wow these were amazing. i did not care for the cookie itself but once the mint was added it was fantastic. we put the left overs in the freezer. the frozen cookies tasted like mint girl scout cookies and i put them in the microwave and they are even better! do try this cookie as u will not be disappointed.

awesome recipe! delicious cookies and even looks  delicious. i lessoned the chocolate chips by 1/4 cup as theres plenty of butter and sugar already added.  i also melted Andies mints in the microwave and poured the chocolate mixture into the dough. This way, no need to wait for the chocolate 'frosting' to solidify. absolutely wonderful!

Wow, what a great recipe.  These are not over sweet and the melted chocolate chips give a chewy texture.  I made them as written for the first batch, then for the second, I topped the warm cookies with peanut butter filled kisses instead of the mint wafers.  Both were excellent.  Great cookie, thank you!

Great chocolatey, minty, cakey little cookie.  So easy and so yummy.  I only had to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes for it to firm up, but I also used a scoop to make my dough balls.

These cookies are very tasty!  I followed the recipe to the letter, and the cookies turned out perfectly - nice and soft, with a delicious cool mint chocolate flavor.  It can be a little tricky keeping the mints on top of the cookies as they melt, but you get the hang of it after a few slide off!  Easy to make, tasty and good-looking... what more could you want in a cookie?

Very chocolaty. Yummy! Everybody liked them. I did not have any mint candies so I substituted them for bittersweet chocolate chips. When I took them out of the oven i gently pushed in a chip and let melt. Very good!

I didn't change anything about the recipe, except microwaving the ingredients to start instead of using the stove.  1/2 mint is the perfect amount to use...1 full mint would overpower the cookie.

These cookies are divine!  Seriously, my new favorite cookie recipe.

These cookies are really fantastic. I made them for a church luncheon and everyone loved them! Now the pastor tells everyone, "I know someone who can make Thin Mint cookies...only hers are better!" The only change I made to this recipe is that I melted Andes mints in a sauce pan and spooned a bit of the melted mint chocolate onto each cookie. It is time consuming, but I figured it would look better.

Made these for the first time tonight.  All I can say is, I will NEVER have buy another box of Thin Mints - these are even better!

Made them almost exactly according to the recipe - just added 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract after the eggs, as a previous poster suggested.

I used this recipe for the dough, and then stirred in white chocolate chips. They turned out great. I'd like to try it with the mints too.

Amazing cookies! I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a bit more work than I would usually put into a cookie, but it was worth it! I don't think my chocoates were wafers, however. They were part Hersheys and part Ghiradelli dark chocolate with natural mint ("Mint Bliss"), because that's what my husband picked up at the store for me. I broke the squares into quarters and put one on each cookie. They melted perfectly and the cookies tasted almost divine! Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't know what I did wrong but these cookies did not work out for me.  I didn't have the wafers, so I used a bag of mint chocolate chips. I also doubled the recipe so I wonder if that is what did it. The dough itself was more like cake batter, and the cookies, although they smelled very minty, cooked really thin and ended up being crispy, no matter how many batches I made, and I ended up having to throw it all out.

These were good cookies. Made these for Christmas gifts and had same problem as another person with the mint flavor mingling with the other cookies on the tray. Will probably make again but will not package with other cookies.

I made these cookies exactly as per the recipe and they were wonderful...very chewy and tasty.  I found that my small Pampered Chef scoop with a 1/2 Andes candy mint on top of each cookie worked perfectly.  My only complaint is that when I put them on a cookie tray with other cookies, some of the other cookies began to taste like mint (especially soft cookies like chocolate chip and shortbreads).  Any ideas on how to prevent this?  I think these are a great Christmas cookie, but am hesitant to make them in the future for Christmas because of them tainting the other cookies on the tray. Thanks!

These are the best cookies I made all day (and trust me, I made alot)! :) I used the Mint Parfit Andes Candies and just set them on top of the cookie as soon as they came out of the oven. After a few minutes I swirled the candy around the top of the cookie with a toothpick... very pretty pale green and chocolate swirls. Did I mention that these are DELICIOUS?! Soft, chewy, and just the right amount of mint.

I had problems - Perhaps the insulated cookie sheets were the problem? - or my high altitude (Denver).   My cookies turned out flat and very very hard once they cooled... so be careful if using those insulated sheets - it required a longer cooking time which I think ruined the cookies.  Or maybe it was the altitude - not sure?  Normally my altitude doesn't affect cookies too much - but who knows!

These are delicious!  I used the mint truffle hershey kisses and left them whole. I believe they are only available at Christmas time.  I don't recommend refrigerating overnight though.  It was VERY hard the next morning.  Will definitely make again and follow the 1 hour chill time.  Thank you!

I first made these 4 or 5 years ago, and they heve been my favorite Christmas cookie ever since.  I even make sure to take a stash of Andes candies with me to West Africa (where I work) so that the years I'm not in the U.S. for Christmas, I can still make these cookies!!

Pretty much perfect as is...

I use a half of a mint on top of each cookie.  To get a nice minty swirl in the frosting, it works well to set the mints on the tops of the warm cookies quickly, and then go back and flip them when they are only slightly melted, and then swirl.  

These look fantastic if you sprinkle some red, white and green sprinkles on top.

The cookie alone is SO good. I'm hoping to experiment with other toppings perhaps a peanut butter frosting, or some kind of cherry topping and hope to enjoy these year round.

These are great! This was my first year of attempting high-altitude Christmas baking, and of four recipes, this was the only one that came out really well. For anyone else at high altitude (I'm at 5300'), my changes were: 375 for 6-7 minutes, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 4 tbsp water, 4 extra tbsp of flour.  Will definitely be making these again!

These were good cookies, but they are not my favorite.  Andes mints are definitely the way to go.  I tried After Eight mints and junior mints because I couldn't find Andes.  When I did find Andes they were way better!  Take the time to find the right mints.  It is worth it.

Amazing cookies and so pretty too!  These will definitely become one of my Christmas staples every year.  I might add some mint extract next time for more of a minty cookie, but my husband loved them as is. I prefer a whole mint on mine, a half just didn't seem enough.  But otherwise a perfect recipe!

A 4.5 rating would be perfect for this cookie.  They are very good but not the very best.  I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and I think it would be fine either way.  If you want more of a chocolate taste, skip the extract.  One thing I did learn was not to make these when are distracted with a sick child.  You can't ignore the time constraints built in to this recipe.  I rolled one batch into balls and then had to run tend to him.  The dough was warm when I put them in the oven, and those cookies were mess!  The dough really needs to be and stay chilled.  The other (chilled) batches were fine, and I would recommend immediately rechilling any dough in the bowl between batches.

Great Recipe!  I absolutely love mint and chocolate together so I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I followed everything, except I used the Andes creme de mint candies.  I used a whole candy for each cookie, and I pushed it into the center when they came out of the oven.  I then put the cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes to re-set them.  They were awesome! I might try to do the "frosting" thing next time, and I will definetly decrease the sugar to 1 c.  I would not recommend adding mint extract if you are using Andes, becuase they are minty enough!

These are like brownies in a cookie!  Simply divine!!  The first time I made them, I didn't have the time to chill the dough very much.  They still turned out great but were pretty messy.  This last time I actually chilled the dough for close to an hour and it was much easier to work with.  I was actually able to get them into "balls" and they looked much more pretty coming out of the oven.  I also discovered there is two different sized of Andes mints.  I originally used half of the small mint and it wasn't enough chocolate.  I found the bigger mints and half of those are perfect!!!

These cookies are great.  My husband and I love the mint!  (We also added mint extract.)  Half way through baking, I got a little tired and pressed the remaining dough into the pan, brownie-style.  Both the cookies and the bars taste great.

These turned out so good! I used an entire Andes mint on each cookie instead of just a half. This made about 50 cookies when rolled into 1 inch (or so) balls.

Oh my goodness these cookies are SO good!  I used my cookie scoop so the cookies were a little larger and I used an entire Andes mint per cookie.  I didn't buy enough mints so I improvised and whipped up a chocolate mint frosting to cover the remaining cookies.
My only advice is to make sure you watch the baking time carefully.  I over baked my first batch and the bottoms were burnt.  They were still edible but not as chewy as the rest, which are to die for!

If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  These are easy and will now be my 'go-to' holiday cookie for years to come.  (I just chowed down 4 cookies in barely 3 minutes as they were so good)!

My 11 yr old son says these cookies rock! I think next time I'll look for the mints that are green on the outside -they will look prettier.  I made a double batch of these for a cookie exchange...have more than enough cookies for the exchange and my family. Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a delicious cookie..I used Andes Creme de Menthe mints and they worked great. The taste of mint was subtle and they were not too chocolately. I baked them for a cookie party and everyone loved them. Great recipe!!

These are so great!  I didn't add any extract and I think they are minty enough as is.  I melted my butter and sugar in the microwave for about 2 minutes then stirred in my chocolate chips.  I used a melon baller to make sure all my balls stayed the same size...and I got 81 cookies.  Totally delicious!!!

I am right in the middle of making these cookies right now and I am fearing that I messed up. I bought the "milk" chocolate chips instead of the "semi-sweet", will that make much of a difference??

These cookies were sooooo good.  I was looking for a recipe for a cookie exchange and found this one and am glad I did!  I baked them last night and everyone loved them.  They are fudgy, easy and very pretty.   I used half of an Andes mint at first but then I made the cookies bigger and used a whole mint.  They are also good without the mints too (but I like them better with them).  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

This really was easy to make and they taste great! They are a little more time consuming than what I usually make (i.e. drop cookies!) but simple nonetheless. I made them for a recipe club today and everybody loved them!

TOO GOOD!  The cookies did spread a lot but who the heck cares...YUM!!!!  I'll keep the dough better chilled next time--and there WILL be a next time.  I incorporated Andes chips as others suggested.  Due to the spreading issue, I reduced the baking time to 7 minutes.  Chewy and sinfully delicious.  Thanks for this absolutely wonderful recipe!

Wonderful flavor.  Even better after they are completely cooled.  I melted the initial ingredients in a double boiler rather than directly on the stovetop.  Excellent!

Yum! These were so awesome! I loved them just the way they are dude. Didn't need to add anything. Although me and my friends did find some of that chocolate topping (for ice cream), warmed it, and dipped the cookies in it. Totally drool-worthy!!!

This has to be the best cookie recipe I've ever tried.  A perfect balance of mint and chocolate, chewy and crispy.  No complaints from me!

I included this cookie in my annual Christmas Cookie baskets and it was by far everyone's favorite!! My sister in-law even begged me for the recipe! Needless to say I think this cookie will be a permanent staple in my Christmas Cookie recipe box!

These are soooo good!  I honestly cannot say enough about these cookies.  Mine baked up crispy on the outside, chewey on the inside.  They are very chocolaty, good and rich if you have a craving!  I didn't put the mint chocolates on top of mine, but instead I mixed in 3/4 of a bag of butterscotch chips.  Fantastic.  I think these would take other add-ins well.

I was expecting great things, but was disappointed by this recipe. I found that the Andes mints overpowered any cookie taste. I made some of these for my boyfriend who tried them, then never ate another one. For the same taste and less work, just eat an Andes mint.

My whole family raved about these cookies.  They are super if you love chocolate and mint.  The pecan and apple pies we made for Xmas dinner didn't disappear as everyone went for these cookies that were just sitting in my cookie jar! It's a keeper.

GREAT recipe!! Made them for my Christmas cookie basket as a new edition and received RAVE reviews - even had to share the recipe! Reminds me a lot of a girl scout cookie but with a brownie texture. Absolutely delicious - this will be a permanent addition to my yearly Christmas cookie baskets!!

LOVED these! OMG. What a great chewy fudgy cookie. Couldn't find any mint wafers, so just used plain chocolate wafers on top and put a tsp of peppermint extract into the batter. Great taste. I will be making these anytime I need a yummy chocolate fix, can't wait to try some new flavours.

These were amazing and super easy! I used half an andes mint and let sit for a few minutes, then used a knife to spread. It worked perfectly, then soon after i spread holiday sprinkles on them, and they looked amazing! Only precaution is make sure you don't overcook them. They dont "brown" like most cookies, so just look at the texture!

Absolutely wonderful!  I crushed up some candy canes and sprinkled them over the mints while they were setting up. One hint: If you have multiple types of cookies you're baking at once, bake a batch while the dough is setting up in the fridge.  This worked out well for me.

These cookies are excellent.  Chewy and tasty.  I followed this recipe to a T except I was in a hurry so I just placed the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes instead of refrigerating for an hour.  I made the balls small like other reviewers recommended.  I also refrigerated the cookies after they had cooled somewhat to help the melted Andes mints set up faster.  Once they set up, they stayed nice and firm - not messy at all so I could stack them in the cookie jar.  My daughter who's on a major mint chocolate kick loved them!

Good but not great, so I just couldn't give them 5 stars.  I do suggest using a full mint wafer per cookie.

I absolutely LOVE this cookie! It's a must-make for anytime, just not during the holidays! It's a big hit with everyone around here.... Think Thin Mint cookie but soft and chewy... Yummy!!!

I was skeptical about these cookies but made them anyway b/c of the good reviews.  I must say, they are great!  
Thin, yes, but still soft 2 days after baking.  Perfect amount of mint and chocolate!

Fantastic for Holiday Magic! This recipe made beautiful cookies...not a broken one in the bunch. The hardest part was the time involved preparing them and the wait to cool. Will definitely be in my list of Christmas treats next year.

These are amazing!  Like thin mints, but better.  I used Andes chips for the "frosting" and when that was semi-set I sprinkled the Andes red/white peppermint crunch pieces on top.  What a keeper!  Used Ghardelli chips for the cookie itself.

I was expecting a rich, brownie-like cookie and what i got was more like crispy flat cookies which didnt seem to go well with the mint. I had volunteered to take these to a Christmas party but it looks like I will be making something else instead 
:(

These cookies turned out fabulous!  The only problem was that I put the dough in the fridge over night, instead of just 1 hour.  The dough was as hard as a rock when I took it out.  I had to leave it on the top of the stove, while my oven pre-heated, to melt it a bit to even work with it.  That was the only snag.  They came out wonderful in the end though!

wonderful cookie. I made 1 batch as is and was surprised at the number of cookies it made. I even made a batch and used the raspberry/chocolate swirl chips (3 on each cookie) instead of the mint for a wonderful variation.

This is a great cookie - wonderful flavor and great texture, very soft on the inside. I added dark chocolate M&Ms to the batter as I rolled them to make them even more festive. I baked them for 9 minutes, and that was perfect for our oven. Used 1/2 of an Andes mint for topping. We'll be making this one again. My husband and my mom both loved them. Perfect for shipping to friends and relatives for the holidays.

The cookies taste great but don't make the best presentation as they are extremely flat.  They looked nice and puffed when first taken out of the oven, but that sure didn't last.  I added crushed candy canes for a festive look.

I made these cookies with my 2 children and we had so much fun!  They were able to make the cookies with the melon-baller,split the Andes mints and put them on top, then swirl them when they melted a bit...and they were delicious without changing the recipie one bit!

I really enjoyed these cookies and found the recipe to be right on the mark.  I only baked the cookies for 8 mins and pulled them out when they still looked under done... this way they turned out super moist and the mints melted into the cookie a bit instead of just laying on top.  Definitely try this recipe - the entire cookie tastes just like an Andes mint when done.  Delicious!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  These were the best cookies I have ever made.  I used ghiradeli (spelling?) mint squares for the frosting (1/4 of a square per cookie).  Sooooo yummy!

These were very yummy, my husband and kids both raved over them. I followed the recipe and like others I did add 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract to the batter.  Next time I may try it without the extract. With the mint on top it probably was more than enough.

My husband made the cookies  from start to finish and they are really good. I was unable to find Ande's Mints so I bought Ghiradelli chocolate mint bar instead. It seemed to take a little longer to melt though. We melted white chocolate chips on the last batch. YUMMY!

On the first batch, I think I made my balls too big because they were still liquidy in the center when I pushed the mint in.  The second batch I made them smaller (maybe the size of a large marble) and they turned out perfect. I'm already thinking about other flavors that would work good with the chocolate cookie, for example Cherry Hershey kisses?  Or even white chocolate?  Above all, VERY good cookie!

These cookies are fantastic.  I made them for a cookie exchange and got rave reviews.  The only thing I did differently was added 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint extract to the dough prior to refrigerating.  Other than that, the cookies are perfect as written.  The brown sugar gives them a terrific, irresistable texture.

I made these cookies, along with an assortment of other Christmas cookies, for co-workers, and they rant and raved about these mint cookies! I used the Andes mints, as one of the other reviews had suggested, and they turned out perfect! A couple of people have requested the recipe, so I'll be sure to pass it along. Thanks, for the wonderful recipe!!!

Excellent! I used Junior Mints - 2 per cookie.  I sqaushed them slightly before I put them on, and they spread wonderfully.  My roommate thinks the Jr. Mints gives an odd aftertaste, but I couldn't tell.  The cookie itself is super easy to make and very good.  I also dipped the tops of one group of cookies into crushed candy canes - which is very pretty though I think people might have trouble eating them!
