I worked in a hospital for many years and this was a standard on our hospital menu. Staff liked it as well as the patients. We used cinnamon instead of red hots, but the rest of the recipe is very similar.

This smelled just like candy but the texture was very strange with the applesauce.  Nobody would eat it.  Sorry.

Not bad.  You can tell there is applesauce in this--the texture, and a bit of the taste is still there.  Really, though, this tastes like cinnamon jello to me.  Not sure the type of jello makes a huge difference since the cinnamon flavor is mostly what you taste.  I don't have strawberry gelatin, but I used mixed fruit, which has strawberry in it and it worked.  I cooled in 4 ramekins, which makes for the perfect serving size.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this stuff! but I used strawberry jello cuz I don't like raspberry. I think I started a trend because I made this for Thanksgiving potluck for my church singles group and it showed up at the Summer BBQ a few weeks ago! LOL

My great-aunt used to make this. I made again for the sake of nostalgia and I think it is quite interesting. Someone said you can used lemon jello, but I would recommend sticking with the raspberry. It's probably the best way to go in the world of strange mid-century jello salads.

My family lives this salad. Want it spicier? Add more red hots. Less spicy? Add less red hots. ?? It's great with ham!!! My company always loves this salad-especially the kids!

Always a staple for Thanksgiving, my grandma made this recipe every year. Now that she is gone, I have upheld the tradition, and we all count on it to be included in every holiday meal.

My candy said "red hots"; and while they were certainly red, they didn't seem to add much spice to the mix. But really, it's the texture that makes this salad only "okay" to me -- the applesauce gives it a graininess that, while edible, doesn't thrill me. It's an intriguing recipe, though, and I'm glad I tried it! I appreciate your sharing it.
