Sweet...yes.  Spicy...yes.  Sticky...no Very good flavor but I had the same problem other reviewers mentioned about the sauce not thickening up. I will make it again with the following changes: 1. Dredging the chicken strips in flour before sauteing, which will help them brown better and help thicken the sauce. 2. Saute on med.-high heat instead of medium. The heat called for in the recipe is not enough to sear the chicken. 3. Simmer the sauce while I am preparing the chicken, then add to the chicken as called for. Because, it took much longer than 8-10 minutes to reduce the sauce, and the chicken dried out. I should add my husband loved this recipe. The flavors are good. Thanks.

A-MA-ZING...simply amazing!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour first.  Then I sauteed an onion and some peppers and set aside.  Next was to quickly sear/brown bite-sized pieces of chicken (you want that crunchy coating) and added the sauce and cooked veggies to simmer.  For the hot sauce you MUST use Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (Rooster Sauce).  It MAKES the dish.  My chicken was sticky, sweet and spicy just the way it was supposed to be.  What an amazing flavor profile.  I'm thrilled with this recipe!

AWESOME AWESOME chicken. Used ground ginger and 1 tbs. of hot sauce but could hardly taste it. If you like spicey, use both. My came out VERY sticky! Here's what I did: cut up chicken into small chuncks, put in bag with flour and shake until lightly coated. Put in frying pan at #8 of 10...very hot, until started to really brown. Took several minutes. Then I added the sauce, tossed, dropped to #3 and put lid on until rice was done, probably 15 minutes. Continue to use the same pan even though the chicken sticks and burns on the botton!!!! All that stuff makes it sticky! Will make again and again!

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  I did notice that when I poured the sauce over the chicken, it seemed to be taking way too long to reduce.  I was also afraid of over-cooking the chicken, so I took it out of the pan.  When the sauce reduced to a thick molasses constistancy, I put the chicken back in to coat it.  I think the juices of the chicken were keeping the sauce from reducing properly and I wanted the chicken juice in the chicken, not the sauce.  This came out good and we enjoyed it, but the chicken was a trifle dry.  Next time I'll remove the chicken as soon as it's browned, reduce the sauce and then add the chicken back.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really delicious, tastes like something from a local restaurant that we really like. I did make several modifications though. I lightly floured the chicken and then seared it in a pan sprayed with Pam on medium high, and sprayed the chicken while cooking instead of using oil. Turned down to low after chicken was browned before adding the sauce. I used 3 Tbps of soy sauce, an extra tablespoon of brown sugar because we like our meat sweet, and used squeeze tubes of garlic and ginger which gave the sauce a thicker consistancy and made it super easy to cook & thicken, it was finished in minutes! Also, I added a chopped sauteed vidalia onion, so good with the sauce! Served over rice.

Delicious, easy, and quick dinner. In addition to suggestions from other reviewers, I use low-sodium soy sauce and lots of vegetables. I also like to top the final dish with chopped toasted cashews.

I try lots of new recipes and this is the best one I've tried in a long time.  It scored a huge homerun with hubby and all three kids (5, 8, 11).  It is a rare feat to find something that everyone raves about.  Just the right mix of sweet and spicy. So quick, simple and made with ingredients I always have on hand.  I'll be making this over and over again. FYI:  I doubled the sauce and dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper before frying.  I cooked the chicken in two batches, cooked it until completely done, then added 1/2 of the sauce. It "stickied" up quickly and I didn't need to cook it the extra 8 minutes the recipe calls for.  I think it might have burnt if I had done that.  My 11-year old couldn't stop raving - "Mom, this is like the stuff you get at the Chinese restaurant only 10 times better!" Give this one a try!  UPDATE:  My kids asked for this a second time this week and I obliged!  I tripled the sauce this time thinking I'd like some extra sauce to serve over rice.  BIG MISTAKE - it thickened up too much and wasn't saucy enough to serve over rice.  AND it also completely changed the taste and texture - the sauce was overwhelming and the chicken was "goopy" rather than "sticky" like the last time I made it.  We were all disappointed with the way it turned out tonight. I will stick with the way I made it the first time.

With a few tweaks this could be a staple in the dinner rotation.  I had to use powdered ginger because when unpacking the groceries they had forgotten to pack the fresh ginger...and how many times has THAT happened?  A lot!  I also doubled the sauce amount and it turned out to be too much/too intense.

Exactly what I have been looking for in a asian type recipe.  My 12 year old son loved it - as did all of us.  After reading the other reviews I did tweak the recipe and it turned out perfect.  We like a lot of sauce, so I doubled the sauce and cut the amount of chicken in half.  I did put the chicken in flour first like other readers suggested.  Also, since so many had problems with the sauce thickening, I made up the sauce in a bowl and then added about 1/2 tbls of corn starch mixed in with about 1/4 cup water.  I mixed this into the sauce before I cooked it.  It turned out perfect.  I also adjusted the amount of hot sauce (used asian chilie sauce), garlic and ginger to our taste.  I also cooked up a frozen bag of asian type (stir fry) vegtables and added them to the chicken and sauce at the end.  Added water chestnuts too, which were so good in the sauce.  Can't wait to make this again!  My son is so picky, so when he eats a whole bowl of anything, you know it is good!  Someone said the soy sauce taste is very strong, and it is, but we like salty and soy sauce.  However, next time I might cut back on the soy sauce a bit.   Enjoy!

It was neither sweet nor sticky, but had an overwhelming soysauce flavor. Won't make again.

This was really quick, easy and good!  I did cut the hot sauce down to 1 tbsp and that was plenty spicy for us.  I also floured the chicken strips before putting in oil and that gave the chicken a good texture and helped thicken the sauce.

Very good.  Place the meat in a bowl with 3 T. cornstarch and 1 T. water.  Toss and work it in so all of the cornstarch is absorbed.  This will thicken your sauce and has a smoother consistency than flour does.  I doubled the sauce and added my favorite stir fry vegetables and served over Jasmine rice.

I love the flavor of this!! Original recipe is great as is, I think! I have tried this on the fry pan with chicken breast or thighs and I have also baked it in the oven... Either way, the smell is intoxicating and I can't wait to it it! MMM MMM!

This is AMAZING....the only thing I did different to the original recipe was to dredge the chicken in flour to ensure a thickened sauce.  Thanks Kate for a great recipe!

This was very good. I didn't have any hot sauce so I doubled the ginger and sauteed red pepper flakes in the oil before browning my chicken. It gave it the perfect kick! The sauce was just right and tasted wonderful over rice! I added carrots just to give some color too.

WOW! Thanks Kate for this awesome recipe! I only used 2 chicken breast halves but kept the remainder of the ingredients the same. I shook the chicken strips with 1/2 cup cornstarch in a bag and let them rest for a few minutes before frying them in a preheated skillet with veg oil. I used Sriracha sauce (rooster sauce) for the hot sauce.
I served the chicken and sauce over hot steamed rice. I served Green Bean Amandine on the side (recipe from this site). Next time I'll serve a side green salad with "Famous Japanese Restaurant Style Salad Dressing" from this site. A must is to have watermelon slices on the dinner table. Watermelon cools the tongue and cleans the palate.

As previously mentioned, dredge chicken in flour prior to browning and you'll get a thicker sauce, which we like better.  I always double the sauce and sprinke the finished plates with toasted sesame seeds prior to serving just for a little something extra.  You can adjust the heat level to suit your preference and this seems to be a dish that almost everyone likes.  Sugar snap peas are a good side with this.

Yum, thanks for the post. I added a couple of Tbsp more brown sugar to sauce as I used "naturally brewed" soy sauce which seems to have a stronger taste that I felt needed to be mellowed a bit with the sugar.
Before I stir fry chicken, I always dredge it in some cornstarch and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes before cooking. It makes the chicken VERY tender and thickens whatever sauce you add to pan after it has cooked for a few minutes.

This would get more than 5 stars!  YUM!  I followed the other reviewers and cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces and dredged in flour before browning.  I doubled the sauce and it was perfect served over rice.  I used sriracha chili sauce.  I also sauteed a small onion and threw it in while the whole pot simmered.  Plenty sticky and plenty GOOD!  This one is a keeper!
NOTE: THIS DOES NOT NEED ANY SALT!  I used low-sodium soy sauce and it was just perfect with no salt.  If I added salt, it would have been too much!

Always double the sauce and it is a weekly favorite w/ my beau and I. We've learned to leave out the chili sauce... first time was way too much and we cried while we ate but was still fantastic! **letting it cook longer will thicken the sauce also and really infuse the flavors**

Delicious!  I have to admit that I did tweak a bit by taking the suggestion to dredge the chicken in flour before cooking.  I'm glad I did because it really did ensure for a nice sticky sauce.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used Sriracha (which in retrospect I shouldn't have doubled because WOW, talk about heat!).  Next time around I'll still double the sauce but perhaps add a bit more sweet and a bit less heat.

Absolutely delicious, complex flavor! I think fresh ginger really makes the sauce (I'm not usually a ginger fan, but it tasted great!) and I used only 1 T of Frank's RedHot. Perfect spice amount for me - not hot but added a little kick and boosted the flavor. The sauce didn't thicken on it's own for me either (there's no thickening agent..). Many of the other reviewers suggested coating the chicken with flour, but I am watching my calories, so I just added a tablespoon of cornstarch (mixed with a bit of water first) to the pan after it had simmered for about 5 minutes. Thickened immediately and became very sticky.  The boyfriend loved it and coworkers complimented the smell of the leftovers! Will be making this again for sure!

I make the sauce and let it simmer till somewhat thick.  For the chicken chunks make a batter of 1c. cornstarch, 1/4c. soy sauce and 2 eggs...mixture will be thick, dip chicken in and fry till brown and crispy.  After finding this batter this is all I ever use for my Chinese recipes.  I serve several chicken chunks over rice and pour the sauce over everything. Out of this world!!

I thought this one had already been featured because I know I got the recipe from here and have been making it for some time now.  Everyone loves it, including the kids, I just adjust the hot sauce accordingly.  The only change you may need to make to get the sauce to thicken is to add corn starch to it.  That's it.  You don't need to dredge the chicken, etc.  Just add corn starch.  Works every time!!!  LOVE this recipe!

This was sensational! I took the advice of other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour. I then cut up some bell pepper and onion and sauteed those in a little oil. Then I took them out of the pan and added a little bit more oil and browned the chicken. Then I took the chicken out and, because the pan was still really hot, when I added the sauce to the pan, it boiled immediately, but got nice and thick and sticky. Then I added everything back in and simmered it. I will make this again and again because my husband and I both LOVED it!

Sweet, sticky, spicy. I used 3 chicken breasts and did not salt the chicken at all.  The sauce made it plenty salty. There was not a lot of sauce for spreading on rice, but it suited us just fine. If I doubled the sauce, I would definitely dust the chicken with flour so the sauce would thicken up more.

Awesome! The only reason I dropped a star was because of the necessity of changing the recipe in order to allow the sauce to thicken. I followed top reviewers' advice of dredging the chicken in flour, browning it first at a pretty high heat, then removing the chicken and cooking the sauce in the same pan, deglazing it and getting all that yummy brown chicken flour off the bottom. It thickened right up and tasted incredible! I also added 1/2 to 1 cup veggie water (from cooking veggies to have on the side), to stretch the sauce out a bit without just doubling ingredients and thus making it too intense. It was a great idea and I would definitely do this again -- we like sauce. :) Also, I don't have hot sauce and we aren't huge on real spicy stuff, but I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and it gave it just enough of a kick without burning our mouths. Even my picky husband loved it, and my 14-month-old too! :)

I made this recipe as part of the forgotten treasures blog by mis7up ("rested" in my box since october 2009...).This was absolutely yummy!!!! I made it in the slow cooker, as I was in work all day. I used slightly less hot sauce as my family is not keen on hot..Will definite put in my chicken rotation!

Followed this recipe but doubled, maybe even tripled the sauce as per other reviewers suggestions... also floured chicken before browning it.  Sauteed red and green peppers and onions on the side and then added to chicken mixture.  Served atop rice and with a side salad.  Even the boys loved it!  The chicken is nearly carmelized when it's done.  Today I'm eating the leftover chicken and sauce on top of the salad and the sauce makes the  most delicious dressing!  Yum!!

The flavor of this was stinking fabulous!  I used dried ginger and used sriracha sauce.  I also doubled the garlic.  I sauteed the chicken (which I tossed with flour) in one pan and thickened the sauce in a separate pan.  I then combined it all together and served over rice.  I served this with lemon roasted broccoli.  Fabulous!

5+ stars - My husband said that the sauce would taste good even on ice cream.  Took about 5 minutes to prepare the sauce, 15 minutes to cook, and 30 seconds for my kids to ask for more.  I made the teriyaki potatoes recipe from this site, and we even scooped up the very little sauce that was remaining in the pan and spooned it over the potatoes, which made them even better.  This will definitely be a staple in our household.  Thanks!

Good recipe, I added a few things. I followed other reviewers' advice and tossed the chicken in flour. I used low sodium soy sauce, and didn't notice a difference. I would definitely recommend using Sriracha Chile Sauce (rooster sauce) as the hot sauce. The Sriracha made the sauce a little thick, so I added an extra splash of soy sauce to thin it out. Also, I sautéed half a sweet onion and two bell peppers then later added the veggies to my chicken at the same time the sauce was added to simmer. Great recipe, would definitely recommend the above additions/substitutions.

Super easy and tasty. I would have given it 5 stars but as the recipe stands it is a fairly salty. Next time I will use unsalted Tamari or soy sauce, I am sure it will get a 5 with that adjustment.

I have tried everything to find the perfect sweet and spicy sauce I get at Asian restaurants and this is it! I love it. I followed the recipe except lightly coated my chicken in flour before cooking  (make sure the pan/oil are hot). I will definitley be making this again!

This is one of the first main dishes I've made from Allrecipes that my family has actually liked.  (I've had great luck with desserts/cookies etc..., but not main dishes)  I used chicken thighs, doubled the recipe and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and water.  My husband just said I should have tripled the sauce and made it a little spicier.  Served it over rice, and there wasn't quite enough sauce for the rice.  Thank you Kate!

i made this recipe with chicken thighs.salted peppered dredged in flour and fried them in some olive oil about 8 min each side. then added the sauce. i added to table spoons of brown sugar and i had a ginger and garlic paste so used that (two teaspoons total). cooked chicken and sauce together for10 min or so.  made with some super sticky sushi rice and edaname.  BIG HIT will make again. i poked holes in the chicken to make sure it is done.

The first time I made this, I dredged--well, bathed--the chicken pieces in flour, and the sauce was a gooey, stickey mess.  Very unattractive too.  The flavor, however, was great.  I gave it another try, only this time, I sprinkled a little flour over the chicken while it was cooking.  It came out perfect.  Will definitely make again.

You will definitely want to replace about 1/2 the soy sauce with water if you don't want it to be super salty. If you're in a hurry just use some popcorn chicken from the deli or freezer section.

Pretty good.   *Drizzle with honey after cooked if you need sweeter** I floured/fried too, and used less hot sauce and added thinly sliced onions/carrots.  Good for buffet for party. If you don't want it sticky keep covered for 10 minutes cooking, turning once.  To make sticky, just cover for the first five and then uncover for last. The sauce has to reduce to get sticky.  I used two whole breasts and cut real thin.

This was really tasty & easy...what a great combo!  I did take the advice of others and double the sauce (for 2 VERY large chicken breasts and 2 heads of broccoli).  It was a tad salty to me (which is odd in my world), so I think I will try w/reduced sodium soy sauce next time.  I browned the chicken in just cooking spray to reduce the oil, though I did dredge the chicken pieces in flour, first.  I chopped my broccoli very small and next time I will leave it a little larger for more flavor and better presentation.  THANKS for a great weeknight recipe!

Fantastic recipe! After reading the reviews, I made the following mods: used chicken tenderloins chopped up instead of breast, doubled the sauce ingredients, dusted the chicken in flour prior to sauteing and added a couple of cups of chopped fresh broccoli. Also, as others said, the sauce was still runny after cooking with the chicken for 8 min so I added 2TBS cornstarch mixed in with 1/4 C water into the sauce and it thickened up immediately. Will be making this again!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!! I made a couple modifications. I tripled the recipe and used Sriacha (Rooster Sauce). I used a low sodium soy sauce to make more healthier. I also upped the brown sugar and honey.

Dredged chicken in flour and browned for a couple of minutes befor adding sauce.  As far as thickening, I had to add water twice, while cooking, to keep from getting too thick.  Next time I want to add a little dark meat and cut back on  the ginger  and soy sauce
a little, just to suit my taste.  And people unless you can stand the heat be very frugal with the rooster sauce.

I also make this in the crock pot. You can fry the chicken or not. It can also be made in the oven. Leftovers are great in salad.

mmmmmmmmm... yummy. did everything as is cept i only had powdered ginger so i subbed for the amount of that ur supposed to use in comparison which is just a couple of taps from the container. i did have a problem with getting it sticky, even after taking others' advice about coating the chicken with flour and heating the sauce on a med-low heat before adding, but i didnt have any problems like others with it being dry. oh yeah, i also added some veggies: celery, onions, and red bell peppers, so i think that helped the chicken stay tender and i also went ahead and added the sauce right before the chicken was done cooking so it would stay more tender. it was basically done, but i thought it would help. overall a pretty good dish.

This was outstanding!  It was so good after I made it with chicken I used this recipe with salmon.  I doubled the sauce and added 2 drops of sesame oil to the sauce, used 3/4 to marinate the salmon overnight.  While the salmon baked in a 350 oven I chopped up a bunch of colored peppers and an onion.  Sauteed them with olive oil and garilic.  Then added the rema ining marinade to the peppers.  Served with brown rice , brocolli, and green onions and sesame seeds sprinkled over the salmon.  Like other reviewers have indicated the ginger and Sriracha hot sauce MAKE this dish.  Save yourself some time and buy the ginger in the tube from the produce section. Easy, peasy, YUMMY!

Very, very good. Plenty of heat and flavor. Drenched chicken in flour before stir-frying it, and cooked the vegetables separately before chicken.

I started with 1 T of rooster sauce and didn't think it would be hot enough so I added another squirt.  Woo it was hot! Used 2 small breasts for whole recipe and added a bit of minced scallion to sauce mixture.  Cook the chicken, remove, stir fry veggies, remove, add sauce to reduce and thicken.

I echo other reviews in that you must dredge the chicken in flour first. Medium high heat is required to brown the chiken quickly so it doesn't dry out. Also, double the sauce recipe especially if you're serving the chicken under rice.  A small bag of chinese vegetables would be great in this.  Just make sure your veggies are completely thawed first before adding them to the sauce.  I only gave it three stars because I had to do too much tweaking to make it work.  For such a simple recipe, it shouldn't make you crazy.

This is an amazing recipe.  I've made it twice already.  One of those recipes that you wish you had know about long ago.  By far one of my favorites from this site.  I liked that it was fast and easy.  I would suggest to double the sauce.  I reduced the hot sauce the second time because the 1st time it was too spicy for my youngest daughter.  Yet she still liked it so much that she asked me to make it again with less hot sauce.  I also would recommend that you let it continue to cook because the sauce will thicken if you let it cook long enough.  If you don't have the time or patience then you can thicken it with just a tad of cornstarch dissolved in water.  We just serve this with steamed rice.  Easy and satisfying.  In our opinion Restaurant quality.  No left overs either time.  Thank you Kate!

This was not to my taste.  Way way too much soy sauce.  It tasted rather like vitamin B syrup.  I didn't even finish cooking it.  There are lots better sweet/sour recipes out there.

This came out freakin AWESOME!!!  I didn't have any ginger, but I had everything else.  I took everyone's advice and dredged the chicken pieces in flour.  I also eyeballed the sauce, make sure you taste it!!!  My husband loved it!!  He was asking for 2nds and 3rds, but it ran out!!!

This is really good. A solid recipe that we enjoyed but will tweak a bit next time.   I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and coated with cornstarch.  I added yellow red and green peppers, celery and water chestnuts.  Served over white rice.  Thanks.

Oh, YES!!  We loved this!!  I made the full recipe of sauce for just two chicken breasts and I thought it was just the right amount of sauce.  Because so many reviewers had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, I made it in a saucepan early in the afternoon.  I simmered it for 8 minutes; then let it sit at room temperature until dinner.  I browned/cooked the chicken, poured the sauce over and heated through. Thick sauce, and no chance of over-cooking the chicken!  I was a little concerned about the soy sauce, so I only used 3 T. and I used 1 T. of hot sauce (Frank's).  It was just right!  Thank you!  We'll be making this one again for sure!!!

Yikes!  This was hot.  I used the Chinese-style chili/garlic sauce and it was on fire.  My family likes that kind of stuff and the flavor was absolutely great, but next time, I think I'll cut back a bit.  I added green onion and cilantro and cooked until nice and brown before adding the sauce.  also good to just let it soak before cooking in these things.   Served with jasmine rice and cool cucumber salad.  With modifications, this will be a 6 star.

This dish was very easy to make and it tasted wonderful. The flavors came together really well. I paired it with jasmine rice and an oriental veggie blend. My husband enjoyed it as well. It's one of our new favorite dishes.

I made this; had everything on hand.  Had purchased a package of thin sliced chicken breasts, so I used those.  I also used Sirracha, since I had that.  My sauce didn't really "thicken", but it was fine since we were having rice.  My thinking is this:  if I make this again, either cook the breasts whole, then slice, or make sure your slices are pretty thick.  Some of my really thin pieces of chicken were dry, almost jerky like!  However, the sauce has a good taste, it was pretty HOT, as in spicy, but I peppered my chicken a good bit.  My daughter's boyfriend really liked it and said it opened up his sinuses!

This is the best sauce ever!  I made it for 2 people, but used all the ingredients because I like a lot of sauce for the rice.  I had 4 burners going.  1 pot for the rice.  1 pan for the chicken.  1 pot for the sauce.  1 pan for veggies.  I sauteed carrots and peppers with garlic & onions.  When cooked, I added them to the cooked chicken and combined everything into the sauce pan.  And put that mixture over the rice.  What really made it delicious was the green onions I added to the pan after everything was basically just simmering.  They gave it such a wonderful flavor!

Sweet, Check! Sticky, Check! Spicy, Check! 
This recipe was deeeelish!!! I made the following adjustments: 5 tbl brown sugar, 3 tbl honey, i used minced garlic instead of fresh chopped out of pure laziness, and omitted the ginger completely (didn't have any in the pantry) I made these adjustments due primarily to the fact of what I had on hand, second the 2 tbl of hot sauce (I used tobasco sauce) was way too hot for me thus why I "uped" the honey and sugar to tae away that nostril burn every time I stirred... As far as cooking adjustments, yes I lightly coated cubed chicken in flour like previous reviews had suggested and used medium high heat to brown the meat in a dash of preheated veg oil, reduced the heat to medium low added the sauce, covered and simmered for about 15 minutes while I made the rice.... DELICIOUS recipe served over rice! Next time I may cook some sugar snap peas to mix in that would be delightful! Thank you so much Kate for this wonderful recipe! Five stars all around!

A wonderful recipe with just enough "bite"!  I did make some "minor" changes based on our own preferences.  Since I dislike ginger, I eliminated it and made up for some flavor by adding sesame oil to the oil when I browned the chicken.  (I removed the chicken while I prepared the sauce.)  The sesame oil's smoky flavor was a plus.  Because I like "crunch" in my Asian dishes, I added a drained can of diced water chestnuts to the sauce once it was reduced, added the chicken again and heated the mixture for another few minutes.  I served it over scallion flavored rice with steamed broccoli on the side.  It was a delicious change.  My only negative is that there wasn't enough sauce.  Next time I make it, I will double the amount of the sticky goodness!

OMG!!! This was awesome! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour and started the sauce before the chicken to thicken and added after searing. The flour soaked up a lot of sauce, so next time I may double it. Thank you kate for sharing this, I will make this many more times!!

I use this sauce for Asian chicken wings. Here's what I do: 1) In a plastic bag, mix 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper to 1 cup of AP flour. Put all chicken pieces inside, coat well, and let stand for at least 1/2 hour. Deep fry at 360 F. 
2) If making a lot, put cooked wings in an oven proof bowl in a preheated 170 F. oven.   
3) Add at least 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce and warm to about 130 F. in microwave. Stir and let stand ~~ keeping warm.
4) Pour sauce over wings and toss to coat.

After reading the reviews, I noticed a lot of people had trouble thickening up the recipe. I floured my chicken like someone suggested and the sauce thickened just fine. However, waaayy too much hot sauce for my personal preference. I did enjoy this though, and will try it again, but with less hot sauce!

All it needs is a half cup of cold water and 1 tbs of cornstarch stirred together to thicken the sauce and make it "sticky" . You can add it to the chcken and sauce after the chicken has brown !!! YUM!!!

This has great potential, though it was too much soy sauce for our tastes. Next time I'll cut down on that and/or increase the brown sugar. I also took other reviewers' suggestions and coated the chicken in flour before cooking. The sauce thickened up almost as soon as I added it to the pan, and wow, sticky is the perfect description! My husband also suggested adding toasted sesame seeds. We'll try making this again, thanks.

So very good! It was pretty spicy, but I'm sure each brand of hot sauce will be different. I simmered the sauce separate from the chicken and only combined them at the very end. That way, the chicken was not dry.

Yum! To quote my hubby's EXACT words: "This tastes like Kung Pao Chicken!" I'm not a fan of Asian foods (I like some, but not most). I have also never tried Kung Pao Chicken before. I msut say, if this is anything like it, I'd be in for a real treat! My chicken was a little sweet, a LOT spicy and super sticky! To achieve this, I did make a slight modification. After cutting up my chicken, I placed it in a large Zip-lock bag, added ~ 1/4 c. of AP flour, s&p'd generouslly and shook like crazy lol! I then heated my oil (medium-high to ensure a super hot skillet) and browned my chicken really well (this took a few minutes). I then added my already mixed sauce ingredients, left the heat as is for a minute or two and then reduced it to "3" and started timing. The flouring step and high heat (to allow everything to bubble / boil slightly) helped thicken my sauce nicely. NOTE: Kate does not specify whether to use Tobasco hot sauce or hot chile sauce (i.e. Sriracha). I chose the latter and was very pleased with the end result. Served with honey roasted red potatoes (STEPHNDON), this was a nice meal. My hubby suggested serving this over sticky rice next time (we didn't care for potatoes on the side, but because they seemed to complement this entree and we've had rice a LOT lately, I gave them a try). Thanks SO much for sharing Kate. I can't believe I waited this long to try your recipe! :-)

We love spicy food but I think I would cut the sirachi sauce a little next time as it burns more and more as you get through the meal.  I floured the chicken and only used 2 large chicken breasts but all of the sauce per the recipe and the balance was good, the thickening was pretty good but not perfect.  My fiance doesn't like white rice but I think that is the best accompaniment for such a hot dish.  I will make again!

I found this to be way to salty even after I added additional sugar and honey. I probably would not make this recipe again.

Only change would be to increase the amounts to have a little extra sauce. Otherwise super easy and a wonderfull flavor.

Liked the flavor overall, but made a few tweaks the second time I made it. Used just a pinch more fresh ginger and garlic. Also, floured the chicken breasts to help the sauce thicken. Without that flour, it was too saucy and not sticky enough. I didn't notice an overwhelming soy sauce flavor, but I did alter the recipe slightly so that may have done it.

I made two chicken bottoms (with skin) with this recipe. I floured the chicken and seared it till crispy on both sides. I removed the chicken from the fire, placed in a baking pan over sliced potato rounds, and poured the sauce into the frying pan. I cooked it for a couple of minutes until thick and then poured it over the chicken and potatoes. I baked it tightly covered at 350 for 1 hour, and then uncovered it, raised the temp to 400 and baked for 20 minutes. It was AMAZING! I did not change a thing in the sauce - it was heavenly. I used Frank's Red Hot, and because it was so spicy, I may use a little less next time. But omg, it was sweet, spicy, and sticky all right! Definitely a keeper!

This was good chicken and was delicious but the sauce itself was a tad too salty for me and as much as I like ginger flavour, I didn't like biting into the small chunks of it. I served this over mashed potato casserole and it was a good combination, but I do agree the sauce is more suited for rice. I will make this dish again, but I'll be using reduced sodium soy sauce and mincing my ginger to get the flavour without having those tiny chunks getting in the way of me enjoying this dish to it's fullest. Thanks for sharing.

The flavor of this chicken was just amazing!  I agree with others that the sauce was a little runny.  Iadded a tiny bit of cornstarch at the end and it was perfect. Also, I only used about a 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  Personal preference.  We are "heat wimps".  Love, Love, Love this!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

This was GREAT!!! I made it last night and my fiancee & I both loved it. I used ground ginger instead of the root, and used 3 Tbs. of hot sauce. Also, I used whole chicken breasts that I pre-grilled in my George Foreman then finished cooking in the sauce.  I served it with teriyaki noodles and sugar snap peas and it was like something you'd order at an expensive restaurant.  Will definitely be making this often and passing the recipe around.

A quick, simple and delicious meal. The flavors of the ingredients really blend well together. Though the dish has a little bit of a kick to it, I could stand it slightly more spicy, so I may add a little extra hot sauce next time (I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce). Also, I used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger root, which I'm sure would have made the dish even better. As a previous reviewer said, there will be entirely too much sauce if you double the recipe, however, if you're the kind of person who enjoys a little extra sauce, you may want to make another half a serving, which also goes great over rice.

Took the advice of other reviewers, floured chicken, sautéed and then added sauce.  I doubled the sauce and use chili garlic paste for spice.  I like it sweet and this was not as sweet as I hoped so I'll double the sweet components next time.  I also added sautéed onion, red bell pepper and frozen green beans at the end.  Delish, a great starter Asian chicken dish.

Pretty good. With bsc I always flour first. That is certainly the thing to do. I simmered the sauce first, and sautéed up veggies first as well. As for spice I used a sweeter chili paste, and everything fresh. So delicious. Easy to get together

Incredible recipe!! Did follow tips: used flour, used 1 T of "rooster sauce" and also ground ginger (measured less than fresh ginger).  I served w Japanese style green beans & frozen bagged chicken fried rice.   The whole family loved it & there were no leftovers

I've been making this recipe for a few years and it is always delicious AND sticky. The chicken caramelizes in about 10 minutes each time (no need for flour) I water down the tamari  (3 TB tamari and 1TB water) so it isn't as salty. thanks again for a wonderful recipe.

I wish I had read the other reviews before making this. I followed the recipe as stated, except used ground ginger and garlic powder. I agree with another reviewer....I was surprized that it got such high ratings. The sauce was very thin and the hot sauce over-powered everything. When I re-read the reviews, I realized the other reviewers altered their recipes so completely that they were not even close to the original recipe, IE: flouring the chicken before cooking, adjusting the measurements of the ingredients, etc. If one of those reviewers posted their recipe, I might try it again.

This was an excellent recipe!  Floured chicken and browned in skillet.  Added sweet onion as well as slices of yellow and red pepper.  Simmered sauce until it was thick.  (Used 5 chicken breast halves and double the ingredients for the sauce).  Everyone loved it--even the kids!

Very good recipe and low in fat and calories.  We used a "very hot" hot sauce which made for some really nice but intense heat!  Sometimes it can be difficult to find good recipes that are low in fat and calories.  Don't be afraid to try this one.  It's EXCELLENT!  We served Zatarans yellow rice as one side and asparagus as the other.  Great meal.  THANKS Kate!

Very tasty and not at all spicy.  Strongly recommend doubling sauce if you want any to go over the rice.  I listened to previous reviewers and dredged chicken in flour which I will NOT do next time.  Made a very tasty paste instead of sauce but since that was my fault, I'm not decreasing the number of stars.

I love all of these ingredients so I had really high hopes for this.  Even with low sodium soy sauce the salty taste was just too much.  3 stars might be a little generous - if I got this in a restaurant I would send it back.

YUM!!!  This was so delicious.  My family raved about it and begged me to make it once a week.  I added a little corn starch to my chicken before frying just because of other reviews.  That is the ONLY change.  For the hot sauce I did use the siriachi (I forget how to spell it) or rooster sauce as some call it.  I do believe that made a big difference in the taste.  I don't think regular hot sauce would be as good.  We had very sweet, very sticky, very spicy, and VERY delicious chicken.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Excellent.  Mmm...good.  You can adjust the recipe according to how sweet or spicy you like your food.  My son loved it!!  I will definately make this again.

Wow, this recipe is really, really good! I used ground ginger (because that's what I had on hand) and chicken thighs (because that's what I prefer) but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. If you let the chicken simmer for a bit over medium heat, the sauce definitely gets sticky -- and it's just as good as what you would get at most mid-priced Chinese restaurants. The sauce does pick up quite a bit of heat from the hot sauce, so if you aren't crazy about spicy, you might want to cut that back to 1 tablespoon. Really good and super easy overall!

Excellent flavor! Took advice of other reviewers and dredged chicken in flour prior to sauteing. Must use the Sriracha hot sauce. It makes the dish.

Was glad I read the reviews first, otherwise dinner would have been wasted food.  Made the sauce separately which made sense in order to thicken properly.  Also allowed for taste test.  As written, it is very salty and kinda of blah on flavor for us. I had cut back on hot sauce (1T on doubled recipe) as 4 year old was eating too.  It was just a lot of strong flavors crashing into each other.  I added a couple pinches of chinese 5-spice, another 1-2 T of honey to sweeten it up and 1-2T peanut butter.  Viola!  After lightly browning floured chicken (another necessity I feel), I added the very thick sauce, tossed to coat over the heat, and put over rice.  I'm still stunned by the compliments from all including the grandson who normally just eats when he likes it or says I don't like it.  Still used 4 large breasts cut up, and doubled sauce because I was putting over rice.  3 stars for the original recipe, as it is a good base...but, I would taste before coating your cooked chicken, so you can adjust if you want.

WHOA SOY SAUCE! I even doubled the honey and brown sugar but all I could taste was soy soy soy! I thought it tasted great, but, definitely not a "sweet sticky" dish - spicy, yes, but only because I added cayenne. I think next time I'll try some sort of thick teriyaki sauce, plus the other ingredients, and leave out the soy all together, or maybe just add a splash. Hubby wasn't thrilled with it but he ate it. The sauce did go amazing with the rice though!

This was a fantastic recipe!! My wife and I absolutely loved it! I think I slightly overcooked it with the chicken and sauce together in the pan, so the 8-10 minute estimate was too much I think. Also I think next time I make this I will ad just a tad bit more honey as well because mine came out more spicy than sweet. Overall it was great! Highly recommend this one!!

WAY TOO SPICY!!! Per other reviewers, I coated my chicken in flour and sauteed it, then removed it from the pan and doubled the sauce. This dish was incredibly spicy even though I did NOT double the hot sauce. I might try this again with only 1 tablespoon (or less!) hot sauce next time.

I made this sauce exactly as it was written and it was all that was promised, sweet, sticky and spicy!  I did do something different with the chicken though.  I took 6 chicken breast strips, coated them in an egg bath and dredged them in a mix of panko, flour, salt and pepper and fried them in oil until browned on both sides!  THEN I put them into the sauce and spooned it over to serve!  The family went NUTS!!! Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli!  It was quick, delicious and nutritious! This is a new Family Favorite!!!  Thank you KATE!!!

Love it, but I made some changes.  I added yellow,green,red peppers and onions (cube) and to make the sauce thicker I added corn starch to the chicken before cooking it, run out of flour.  I also added hoisin sauce to the soy sauce.

This is soooooooooo good! 
The only thing I changed is the quantity of soy sauce, I put half of the amount that calls for.
I cooked some sticky rice that you can buy at asian super markets, it is actually called sweet rice.
Thanks for this recipe.

I loved the flavor of this dish! I doubled the sauce and it was enough to coat the chicken. Followed others' advice and dredged the chicken in flour prior to cooking in the oil.

Delish...w/some adjustments. I, too, dredged to chicken in flour but added some cornstarch. I doubled the sauce. After browning the chicken I removed it and poured to sauce into the pan with the drippings from the chicken. It thickened nicely. Chicken stayed moist.  Will def make again!

Really good way to use up extra veggies for stir fry. I used a little more hot sauce and honey since I had chik-fil-a chicken pieces (my friend's husband works at a perdue chicken factory yay!). I saw a review that said it had an overwhelming soy sauce taste, so I used 1/8 cup since I don't like a strong taste like that. I simmered the sauce while the chicken was cooking.  Also, used ginger powder and dredged my chicken pieces in flour seasoned with pepper, paprika, adobo seasoning, and a few shakes of seasoned salt. Served with stir fry veggies, chopped onion slices, orange pepper slices, and rice.

I'm sorry,but I didn't enjoy this recipe at all. I've rated many recipes from this site,and gave great ratings! (I'm trying to say that I'm NOT picky! :) ) I followed the recipes ingredients exactly,just floured my chicken pieces,and browned in oil first. I then put chicken,and mixed sauce in my slow cooker. Cooked on low about 2 or 3 hrs til done. The house smelled like garlicky,soy sauce! And tasted the same! I'm sorry to say that,but I can't describe it any other way. Maybe I'll try again,and use stove top because maybe the crockpot messed it up! :) thank u!

Really, really good!  Followed the advice of others to dredge the chicken in flour and the sauce was perfect.  I cut back to 1 Tbs of hot sauce (Sirachia--not spelling that right) and it was plenty hot.  Served it with lo mein and we LOVED it! All the flavor of take-out Chinese without all the greece.

Very good recipe and very simple!! Changes I made: Coated the chicken pieces in a tablespoon of flour along with a bit of salt and pepper. I think this helped thicken the sauce a bit, too. Doubled all the sauce amounts except the hot sauce (we used 1 heaping tablespoon of Chinese chili bean paste). Next time, I will use only 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup either water or sake, as 1/2 cup of soy sauce made it a tad salty. Other than that, made it exactly as written and it was awesome! Perfectly spicy, nice and sticky. Already planning to make it again! Simpler than a lot of mixes!!

Very good and easy to make. I doubled the sauce and I did dredge chicken in flour with a little corn starch added.  It thicken up perfectly!  I added steamed  broccoli,  carrots, onion and red and yellow peppers and served it over couscous. It was great!!  Next time I'll make more sauce!

I made this for my family a few days ago and they absolutely loved it. I dredged the chicken in flour and cooked separately as some other reviewers suggested; also, I added a little cornstarch (mixed with water) to thicken the sauce a bit. Added the chicken in with the sauce after both were finished cooking to let the flavors meld. My brothers devoured this is one sitting. Thanks!

Excellent...even though I didn't have the fresh ginger root. For our taste, I'll cut back on the hot sauce by 1/2. I put in 1  1/2 tbls and it was still pretty zippy for us. As with the other reviews, I dredged the chicken in flour. I also sauteed onion, green pepper and red pepper and set aside. Then seared the chicken in a med-hot electric skillet, added the veggies and the sauce. Covered and turned down to low for 10 minutes. VERY moist and tasty!!

Ok... so this recipe turned out to be a happy accident for me. I've been excited for days to make it and first ally did today. I followed advice of a lot of reviewers and dredged the chicken through flour after sprinkling with salt and, pepper. I doubled the mixture (minus the hot sauce, 1 tblspn was plenty), and let it start reducing in a seperate pot while Browning the chicken in large pan . I removed chicken from pan after browned and stir fried green, red and yellow peppers and some onion then added it all together and cooked for about 10 minutes until "sticky". I served over rice made with 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 water. Here's where the accident comes in.... as I'm cleaning up and before I sit down to eat I realize that I had actually used terriaki sauce instead of soy sauce! It still tasted great. As always topped off with duck sauce but that's just personal preference.

Excellent. Followed some other reviewers advice with the sauce. I combined all the sauce ingredients in a small pot turned heat to medium high and brought sauce to a boil then added about 1t flour to thicken then added my cooked cubes chicken. Served over rice and broccoli with a couple more shacks of soy sauce.

This was a great recipe.  I do not know much about hot sauce and got a bottle that had many Spanish words on it and one word I could recognize "habanjero."  I thought, "SURE!"  I used just one tablespoon of it and it made our mouths burn and tingle for quite some time!  I think this recipe is a great recipe!  Next time, I will cut in half the amount of hot sauce again because our palates are just not used to that much heat.  It is still an incredibly wonderful recipe full of flavor and is so easy to make!

I made this the first time the other night and followed the directions exactly. Like other people said, the sauce didn't thicken, but my family tends to like thinner sauces anyway so it wasn't a problem for me. The second time I made it I added a little corn starch while it was simmering to thicken it. It worked perfectly, but make sure you follow the directions on the box (you have to mix the corn starch with a little water before you add it to the dish). All in all it's a great dish; I love it, my family loves it, and it's quick and easy to make. =]

This was so easy and it was so delicious!  I took the advice of everyone and dredged teh chicken before cooking.  I also cooked the sauce and chicken separately until the last minute.  We added pineapple and cashews and served over brown rice.  I will definitely make this again!

This is wonderful!  Very flavorful.  But WOW is it spicy.  I used two tablespoons of Sriracha hot chili sauce and my mouth was on fire!  So for anyone like me who isn't good with very spicy food, I'd recommend cutting down to 1 tbsp of the hot sauce.  Even so, this was very, very good!  Thank you for the recipe.

EDIT: If your sauce is not thickening up, you do NOT need to add cornstarch or flour your chicken.  You just aren't cooking it at a high enough temperature.  Turn the heat up, keep cooking (and stirring!) and it will reduce down and be sticky in no time.

yummy! Here is what I did. I sauted the chicken and then put it aside while I made the sauce and then let it reduce for 10-15 minutes before adding the chicken back in.  If the sauce doesn't thickin up for you I would use some cornstarch. I used two large cloves of garlic and some pickled ginger slices cut minced up and it was wonderful. Def will be making again.

This was really good. I did add a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up. Our's turned out really spicy, it was too hot for even my hubby who loves spice. Never time I wouldn't add both tbl. of chili sauce but other then that, this was great with rice.

Wonderful. I dredged my chicken in cornstarch instead of flour. Also used the rooster sauce instead of hot sauce. It tastes just like a restaurant dish - even a bit better! The cornstarch really made the sauce thicken and stick to the chicken. Will make this one again and again.

Great flavor in this chicken!  Like others, I found that it was sweet & spicy, but not sticky.  This sauce does need floured chicken or added cornstarch to thicken it up, so don't wait for your sauce to thicken by itself (you'll end up drying out your chicken).  Other than that, it's still a very tasty chicken dish to serve over steamed rice with a veggie.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I don't know whether you call this americanized chinese food or someone's attempt at making something 'asian', the combination of flavors are odd and wasn't as tasty as it was made out to be.

This recipe is marvelous. You can thicken up the sauce without flour if you add Guar Gum to the sauce prior to adding it to the frying pan.

I thought this was pretty good and really easy.  I cut down the on hot sauce, only using 1 tsp as my kids don't like really spicy food.  It almost needed some vegetables, I think next time I might add some red peppers and water chestnuts.

I don't think you could fairly call this spicy, at least not in my book.  I added jalapenos, onions, and crushed red pepper and it still wasn't as hot as I had hoped.  It is definitely sweet and sticky.  It has a flavor reminiscent of teriyaki chicken.  It's good and I'll probably make it again for my husband.  He loved it but it was a tad too sweet for me.

This is wonderful. I have made it three time now in the last four days not just for me but other people and it was loved by all.  I did add red & green bell pepper and white onion cut same size cube.  As other reviewers said it's a must to use "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (Rooster Sauce) I can't imagine using Tabasco or Frank's Hot sauce not the right flavor.  But need to be aware the the Rooster Sauce can vary a lot from bottle to bottle.  Try this recipe if you like spicy because that it what it is.  Thank you for the post kate!

Very easy & quick, so great for weeknight suppers. Couldn't believe it, but my school-age children really loved it, and they are NOT adventurous eaters. I did  lighten up on the spice, but it's easy to adjust something like that to taste.

I thought that this recipe was great other than the fact that it was incredibly (almost unbearably) spicy.  I think that I was using very hot hot sauce and don't think that this problem is the recipe's fault.  I am used to using a medium heat hot sauce and poured in the wrong one.  Even with the excessive heat, you could tell it had a great taste and I will definitely be making again without so much spice :) As far as sticky goes, my sauce went into the chicken rather than having enough to make sticky, next time I might make a little extra sauce.  Overall a good recipe T

WOW!  This is a great recipe!  I followed a few other reviews and dusted the chicken with flour before cooking.  I also only used 1 Tblsp of hot sauce since we have young kids. I added some to my portion to meet my tastes.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I double the ingredients for extra sauce, but not the hot sauce.  The kids still thought it was too spicy.  My sauce never thickened.  Not sure why, but served with brown rice and broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe and my family really liked it.  I added mini-portabello mushrooms and green onions to spruce it up some.  I also added cornstarch mixed with a little water for shine and for thickening the sauce.  I think that the cornstarch is one of the key ingredients missing which makes it sticky.  I also added Kitchen port (browning sauce) to make the glaze darker.

I absolutely loved this dish! It was like eating at my favorite Asian restaurant. The only change I will make next time is to back the hot sauce down to 1 tablespoon. I used Louisiana and found it to be too spicy and I love spicy food. I have already shared this recipe with friends. Thanks, Kate, for a super recipe.

Have you ever had lettuce wraps from PF Chnag's???  This is it! I had everything already in my kitchen so I made two batches of the sauce then I used about half to 'season' some ground chicken.  I made it like you would taco meat then wrapped it in lettuce.  It was perfect!!! This was AWESOME!!

Zippy and different. The first time I made it I did add some cornstarch because the sauce wasn't thickening on its own. But the second time I made it the sauce thickened just fine without the cornstarch. This sauce also works great with pork. Oh, and I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Update: added some grated orange peel for a little different flavor this time, and it was fabulous! 2nd update: I have made this many times now and have yet to figure out why sometime the sauce thickens up just fine, in close to the amount of time stated, but other times it won't thicken on its own. I always use the same pan and burner, so it just mystifies me. I have made this with grated, chopped, and ground ginger, and have decided that grated works best. I usually double the sauce and add chopped fresh brocolli or some stir fry veggies that cooked seperately at the very end, stir just to coat and serve over rice or Thai noodles.

Very good and easy, will definitely make again! Has a little kick (I used Tabasco hot sauce). I doubled the sauce and served over jasmine rice. There was more than enough sauce, I probably didn't need to double it.  The sauce didn't really thicken, I'll try adding cornstarch next time. Great flavors.

One of my all time favorite dishes!....And the taste is phenomenal!....A weeknight staple for us....the family loves it!
So economical!...KUDOS*****
I also tweaked it a little and used spaghetti noodles and broccoli florets with the chicken...In order to obtain the thickness and stickiness, add a tsp. of corn starch to about 2tsps. cold water, stir and add to the sauce....and let simmer an additional 2 or 3 minutes...it's worth it, No more Chinese takeout....DYI!

Found the soya sauce overwhelming so I use 1/2 s.s and 1/2 honey garlic sauce. (Asia section of grocery store). Also dredged chicken in  flour and add some cornstarch to sauce before adding it to the chicken. Thickened very nicely.

Loved it. Like everyone else, I added some flour to the chicken and frozen Chinese veggies. My personal rendition was to add a few tbsp's of sweet and spicy chilli sauce that is used for dipping egg rolls into... delicious??

I dipped the chicken in gf all purpose flour before putting it in the pan - waited until both sides browned, turned the heat to low and poured the sauce on top. The dish was done in 10 minutes! I added green onions and served the chicken on top of quinoa. Such a quick, easy, and DELICIOUS recipe!

Yum!  Double sauce. Cut chicken pieces in chunks, shook with flour, salted and peppered, and fried in skillet. (Make sure to cook chicken most of the way before adding veg.)  Added frozen broccoli and poured heated sauce (without any hot sauce and 1/2 tsp ground ginger) over all. Added corn starch at end to thicken up sauce.

Really easy and flavourful. I had few ingredients laying around and this recipe fit what was in my fridge. I dredged the chicken in flour and let the sauce simmer and begin to thicken while I seared the chicken. For the sauce I doubled the garlic and squirted in extra sriracha (the only hot sauce I would recommend with this recipe). I used China Lily soya sauce. I steamed julienned red bell pepper, onion, and broccoli until tender but still with a bit of crunch, and stirred it all into the simmering chicken last minute of cooking. Next time I will double the sauce. Served overtop of steamed rice.

Sooooo good! Made a few changes however. I read previous reviews and kind of made some adjustments from there. I only did half the amount of soy sauce (subbed gluten free soy sauce) that it called for. Didnt want it to be too salty and over powering.  I didnt add ginger, I am not a big fan, so I added a little bit of orange juice. In order to get it sticky you really have to let it boil on high and let it sit. I did flour the chicken, but with rice flour, since I'm gluten free. Helped make it crunchy and really added some substance. I just loved this! I will def save this recipe and make it again.

This was really really good and super easy. I used 2.5 Lbs of chicken so I doubled the sauce recipe. I also put the chicken in a bag and coated it with some flour like others mentioned. I used ginger seasoning instead of fresh and for the hot sauce I used 3 tbspn of regular redhot and 1 tbspn of habanero hot sauce..so pretty spicy but really good! Def sweet/spicy and sticky. Served with rice which helped with the hotness.

This either deserves more than 5 stars, or I need to go back to other recipes and only give them 4!  I've made this twice in the past week which is something I just don't do!  It's the absolute perfect blend of flavors without being "bad" for you.  It tastes like a restaurant dish. I've been making with 20 oz chicken thigh meat and sprinkling a small amt of flour like others suggested - not sure if it's necessary, but I did it both times I made it.  I don't like having a garlic after-taste, so I've only used 1 tsp, and I've omitted salt, pepper, and oil.  My first go was too salty tasting and I identified our soy sauce as the culprit - I recommend using a low sodium version and it will be much better (ours was).  My next way to make this will be to add some orange zest to the sauce for an orange chicken.  We had over rice & stir-fry veggies.  AMAZING!!

This recipe is a keeper! Delicious with just the right mixture of sweet and heat. Some reviewers had problems getting the sauce to thicken and found the soy sauce too salty and over-powering. I dealt with this by using reduced sodium soy sauce and by boiling the sauce separately from the chicken, adding a teaspoon of corn starch (mixed in cold water). It thickened very nicely and was just the right level of saltiness. I browned the chicken in sesame oil while the sauce cooked and added the sauce to the chicken at the end...Fantastic!!

Sorry to be one of those annoying "I changed a bunch" reviewers... but here we go. I tossed the chicken with salt, pepper, cornstarch and a little flour. I browned it in a heavy skillet and removed it from the pan. I doubled the sauce and added a couple of tablespoons vinegar to make a sweet/spicy/sour flavor similar to General Tso's chicken. I put the sauce into the same skillet and scraped up all they yummy bits. When I added the chicken back into the sauce, I also added a half-pound of frozen broccoli. Simmered for 10 minutes. Deliciousness! Thanks for the great base recipe.

I liked this recipe and give it a 4~5 just for ease. The chicken is not crispy like at the restaurants, but they coat it in cornstarch and basically deep fry it. This sauce mixture is similar to bottled stuff I have bought but way better. I followed the recipe, but used low sodium soy sauce, 1/2 the ginger suggested, and approximately 2 teaspoons of sirachi hot sauce for the hot sauce. I basically fully cooked cut up chicken, in a pan heated with corn oil on temperature 7, with a little salt, pepper, and adobo all-purpose seasoning. Then added the sauce stirring for just a couple of minutes more. I served with stir fry blend fresh vegetables, from tjs, cooked the same way but without sauce. Lastly, I garnished with sesame seeds. I would make this again for ease alone.

I have made a similar recipe for many years, will post my recipe soon. I can say that this recipe needs cornstarch though for it to be sticky and no oil is needed.

Impressive looking dish and so simple to make.  As a bonus, it tastes wonderful!  Dredging in flour, shaking off the extra and doubling the sauce..... it came out perfect.  Note: the chicken breasts I used amounted to 2 lbs of chicken.  Thanks for sharing!!

I made the exactly as the recipe calls minus the 2 tablespoons hot sauce. Only used a dash since we don't like spicy food. Served this with Jasmine rice and steamed broccoli and it was absolutely delicious. I couldn't stop eating the chicken. I poured the leftover over top of the rice and it was even better reheated in the microwave the next day. Trick is to not over cook the chicken so it tastes nice and moist.

I love to cook and needed something new to make.  This was a hit!! I did dip each piece in flour and spices prior to searing and after reducing the sauce is was very nice and sticky :) Made a double batch of the sauce and used chili sambal for heat.  Great recipe for a family dinner that kids will enjoy as well... no matter what age.

Tasty and super easy!  I used chicken thighs (what I had on hand) and substituted chili-garlic sauce for the Asian hot sauce (I thought I had a bottle of Sriracha, but nope).  Great combination of flavors and it comes together really quickly.  I served it with homemade fried rice and stir-fried baby bok choy.  Thank you!  ADDED COMMENT:  I've made this 4 or 5 times now and this is my favorite method---I always use chicken thighs, and double the sauce.  I also add about a teaspoon Chinese Five Spice powder, and let the chicken and sauce bubble away for about 20 minutes by which time it's a lovely, sticky sauce as promised!  It was a five-star recipe originally, and just suits our family using this little variation---Thank you again!

Absolutely loved this.  I put my chicken pieces into flour before places them in 1/8 inch of vegetable oil to sheer/brown. I also sautéed bell peppers and onions separately then added them into the mixture after draining some of the oil from the chicken. Other than that, followed the recipe and the sauce thickened and ended up being delicious. Only thing else I'll mention is that you should be very choosy about what hot sauce you use as it adds a lot of flavor (not necessarily spice unless you have a very hot hot sauce). I would highly recommend this dish though as my family loved it.

This was awesome!  I did as others and dredged my chicken in flour and browned it before adding sauce to same pan.  This produced a nice deglazing effect.  I also added some green onion.  Other than that, no other modifications needed...and one of the best parts...had everything but the fresh ginger in my kitchen!  Will be making again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum, this was super delicious, even my picky 5- and 6-year olds loved it. I fried the chicken pieces coated in flour before tossing the pieces in the sauce per other reviewers' suggestions. Will definitely make this again.

The recipe needs some work, so I found it to be better like this.  

Mix all of the ingredients in a ziploc bag or bowl and add chicken.  I also added 1/8 c vinegar (any kind is fine, I used blueberry and it was really good!), cilantro, and instead of hot sauce, I used 1/8 tsp sambal (a little goes a long way, so be mindful of that lol).  I shook the bag and marinated it for an hour.

Then, I heated 2 T olive oil over medium heat and removed the chicken from the marinade and reserved the sauce; then browned the chicken on both sides, about 3 min per side, and transferred to a warm plate.

Then I added 2 medium sliced onions to the pan and sauteed for about 1 min, then added the marinade to the pan.  Brought it to a boil and  reduced to simmer, then added about 2 T cornstarch (combine it w/ 2 tablespoons water and blend before adding to the sauce to avoid lumps).  

I whisked well and when thickened to the desired consistency, then added the chicken back to the pan.  When the chicken was cooked through and coated well with sauce, I added more cilantro and served it over basmati rice.

A decent base recipe, but I felt it needed a lot of tweaking to be great.  :)

A nice, quick and simple supper to put together.  I think the title is a little deceiving as the dish wasn't sweet nor did it get sticky.  But, it was delicious.  I think if you started this dish on the stovetop and finished it in the oven, the sauce would have gotten sticky.  The taste was great and we enjoyed this chicken dish served over sticky rice.  I like that the chicken wasn't breaded as it made it a much lighter dish.  The only change I had was to use low-sodium soy sauce.

This sauce is excellent! I took the advice of others and doubled the amount & it was probably my best attempt at homemade sauce. I dredged my chicken in a mixture of flour, corn starch, & a pinch of Chinese 5-spice and cooked till crispy. I threw red & yellow pepper and broccoli on top and covered it long enough to steam the veggies before stirring in the sauce. Wonderful & easy.... What's not to love?

One of the best meals I ever made! Grated rind and juiced 1 orange then added to sauce and reduced. Flowered chicken . Used Sambal Sriracha chili paste (1tbsp).  Grated fresh ginger and garlic. OMG this was good. I can't prove it but I think I had an out of body experience!! I have left instructions to my wife to print this recipe and lay it in my coffin when I die. Yes. It's *THAT* good!

This became a favorite the first time I made it. My suggestions are to increase the amount of sauce ingredients, because once it thickens it becomes a glaze. So if you want an actual sauce that can be drizzled, the sauce recipe must be doubled. Like other reviewers, I opt to add ground ginger. Also, I like to add 1/3 C cornstarch and the chicken to a ziplock and shake to coat.

I literally created this account so I could leave a review. This is the first thing I've ever cooked at home that made me think, hmm, this could be from a restaurant. What an awesome dish! Im a 25 year old bachelor who cant cook to save his life and even I made this thing. Biggest tip was what a few other people have said; make sure to "dredge" (learning new words!) the chicken in flour before throwing them in the pan to cook. This really thickened the sauce and allowed it to stick to the chicken. BALLER RECIPE.

Really great recipe! I used teryaki sauce instead of regular hot sauce, added red pepper and cilantro and I used chicken thighs on a bed of couscous! Delicious!

Loved this recipe. I made this last night and my hubby asked me to make it again tonight! That NEVER happens. I also used the sriracha (rooster) sauce and it gave it the perfect amount of kick! Like others, mine did not thicken up at all. So next time I think I will do as other reviewers suggested and dredge the chicken in flour first. Also, like someone else said, it was a tad too soy saucey (salty). Next time I will reduce the soy sauce a bit. Oh and I loved the suggestion to add vegies! Looking forward to making this again!

This turned out sweet, sticky and spicy.  My husband and I loved it.  The fresh ginger really made this dish.  I followed this recipe almost exactly.  Here's what I did for a perfect outcome.  Dredged chicken in corn starch, omitted vegetable oil (used PAM spray), browned chicken, removed from pan and set aside.  Added sauce, cooked for a minute or two, re-added chicken.  Cooked on low-medium heat for 9 minutes, continually stirring.  I really let the sauce cook down until I got a tacky texture and sauce was sticking to pan.  Next time I will add some pineapple chunks, bell peppers and onion.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I did dredge the chicken in flour. I didn't use hot sauce, my family doesn't like it. I did add red and green peppers and mushrooms, which I added after browning the chicken. It turned out great!! Will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good and had just the right amount of spice.  I followed the recommendations of others and battered the chicken in flour and cooked the sauce separate before adding to the browned chicken.  It definitely got sticky because I added it to the chicken skillet on med-high heat, but burned very quickly.  If I would make again I would definitely turn the heat down and just let it simmer for longer.

OMG, this is sooo good, quick and easy!  I took a chance and did what others suggested and lightly floured strips, what a delicious dish! My son stated wow Mom can make Chinese Sesame Chicken, taste the same I must agree.  My husband Mr. Picky even said this was a keeper, they both asked for seconds. 
I was in a rush and was able to make this for the first time and it took 45 min.  Next time it will be 30 min. because I'm not reading and double checking recipe.
I'm very pleased!

I followed other reviewers and floured the chicken before frying it, I skipped the oil and used cooking spray instead, cooking the chicken over med- high heat for about 8 minutes. For the sauce I followed the ingredients exactly. I read other reviews where people had issues getting the sauce to thicken so I combined a teaspoon of corn starch with 4 teaspoons of hot water and mixed it in with the sauce after pouring it into the pan. I let it simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes and it turned out great. Sticky, sweet and really spicy!

Really a very good dish, and quite simple! I cut the chicken into smallish pieces, instead of strips and I coated it in corn starch before cooking. 

I would use no salt, and a little less oil next time, but it came out delicious anyways! The spicy and sweet combo is perfect.

This recipe is easy and has great flavor.  My husband said I could make it as much as I want.  That is high praise from him. No changes needed.

The adaptation I've been making using this recipe is amazing, haven't actually tried it exactly as written but here's what I do:

Sauce: leave out the brown sugar, use equal parts soy sauce, honey and Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, and ground ginger and garlic from the jar.

Cooking: bone in chicken thighs, bake 20 minutes @ 400F with salt and pepper, remove from oven and cover with mixture, back in oven for 10 minutes, remove and turn over, back in for 10 minutes.

Perfection!

Definately cut chicken in smaller chunks and shook in container with flour...also cooked red pepper, onion and mushrooms and added them in after browning chicken...also added a little extra brown sugar and cut out the hot sauce (I have a real sweet tooth). My whole family LOVED it!!

It's a good recipe with a very delicious combination of spices and it's easy to adjust the sweet and spciy to your preference.  Just make sure you cook it long enough on high heat and the sauce will thicken to give you that perfect stickiness!

Love this.  I coated chicken with flour.  I didn't use hot sauce and I added 1 1/2 tbs of orange juice.  I browned chicken then transfered to a paper plate  while boiling the sauce for a few minuted.  Then added chicken back to sacue and it stuck to chicken right away.  turned out tender and sticky!  Will make again

Five stars only by adding TONS more brown sugar and honey than called for. Also by following other reviewers' suggestions of dredging the chicken in flour. The chicken isn't really sticky but the sauce is definitely tasty when adding more sugar. Also, I quadrupled the sauce recipe  and added stir-fried  celery, green peppers, carrots, and green onions and added them to the mixture.

I absolutely love this recipe and so does my family and the many friends I've served this wonderful dish.  I doubled the sauce keeping the hot sauce at 2 tablespoons.  I also added a cacophony of stir fried vegetables to the mix.

only reason this isn't a 5 star is that i wish i had tripled the sauce to allow for mixing w/ veggies and rice. I added carrots and green beans. amazing flavor. This will go into my regular rotation for sure

This recipe is wonderful! I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, dredged in flour, and cooked in coconut oil; I NEVER use vegetable oil. At first I was tempted to cut the honey amount in 1/2, but I was really glad I used the full amount; it was perfect. I served it over brown rice, and it would have been nice if the rice had more sauce so next time I will double that.

This is my new favorite chicken dish.  I dredged the chicken with some flour before frying it and cooked the sauce down on the side.  Then I just tossed the sauce in once the chicken is done and cooked for one minute extra.  I diluted the soy sauce with a few tablespoons of water so it's not so salty and I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  YUMMY!

This recipe was so yummy. I had no problems with the sauce not getting thick and sticky like previous reviews, and I followed the recipe exactly. We enjoyed this with brown rice and stir fried veggies. Will make again and have shared this with friends.

Very good. I did others advice & double the sauce since we added the veggies & served over rice as the submitter suggested. Next time I'm going to reduce the hot sauce a tish just out of preference. Would like to try as an appetizer also.

Was great--- just a might to hot for our taste. Would cut the hot sauce in half next time. Other then that it was good and it definitely got sticky for me. I dredged the chicken in flour first. That must be the trick.

***** DELICIOUS!! Followed directions, amounts, cooking time and it was Fabulous!!  I made it with my grandchildren-oh no!!  We have renamed this recipe "Sweet, Spicy, Sticky Kitchen Counter Chicken!!  The two of them wanted to measure and stir the honey into the sauce mixture! I neglected to tell them to put the sticky spoons on the small plate to to keep the counter from getting sticky. They laid those spoons all over, there wasn't a spot on the counter that wasn't sticky. We all LOVED this recipe.  We're always going to enjoy a good laugh remembering the time we made "Sticky Kitchen Counter Chicken."  Be sure to double the sauce recipe. It's a must try!!

This stuff ROCKED - if you like General Tso's you will love this!   Like others recommended I dredged the chicken strips in flour and also used powdered ginger as I did not have any fresh ginger root.  Easy and GOOD!

This wasn't exactly my favorite but it did turn out well and had some 5 star reviews from the other people in my house who ate it, so I'll give it the full 5 marks. :) Served it with home made fried rice.

My husband and I both LOVED this!  Tossing the chicken in flour before cooking it worked well, and when the sauce seemed to be having trouble thickening, I just sprinkled a teaspoon or two of flour right into the skillet and *shazzam,* it thickened right up beautifully!  Great recipe - thanks!!!

DELICIOUS!  I doubled the sauce since we like lots of sauce on our rice but next time I make this I will omit the salt as there's soya sauce in the recipe which is salty enough.  As the sauce did not thicken I added a bit of cornstarch disolved in water and added it to the pan at the end.  It thickened beautifully.  Thank you for posting this yummy and fast recipe! :)

OUTSTANDING! I dredged the chicken in cornstarch, and deglazed the pan with a bit of sherry and chicken broth. One tablespoon of hot sauce (habenero) was plenty.

This dish was...so delicious. I kept trying the store bought Asian sauces and was constantly disappointed. Thankfully, I then discovered this dish and I will now never go back to the store-bought wasteland! The name of the recipe was perfect, as it turned out sweet, sticky and with a perfect amount of heat to it. I did, as per other suggestions, dust the chicken with flour before putting them in the pan. I'm now going to have to start having fresh ginger on hand, because this will definitely become a regular dish. Trust me, make double this recipe...because you'll find yourself wanting more.

I made this last night and it was wonderful.  I doubled everything for the sauce except for the chili, because I like lots of sauce over rice.  It was still a little hot for our tastes (we have two small children they ate other things) so next time I will probably cut the hot sauce in half so they can try it too.  
I cooked in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies (thawed and patted dry) and served over rice with a side of edamame -- Yummy!
Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is fantastic! I'm definitely doing to keep it in mind to make again. So easy and delicious. You just make the sauce, through some chicken tenders in a skillet, pour the sauce on them, and wait about 10 minutes. It turned out wonderful. The flavor is great. I served them over baked veggies so the veggies absorbed the flavors of the sauce. I must admit the sauce is a bit liquid-y and not particularly sticky, but it certainly is spicy and sweet. The amount of hot sauce they recommend is perfect, and I recommend using chili sauce. I used chili sauce and it tasted awesome. Thumbs up!

Great recipe.  Such a nice combo of flavors.  I added a couple handfuls of roasted peanuts to my sauce.  I might consider adding either sesame seeds and/or thinly sliced carrots next time to change it up.
As a base recipe though this is fabulous.

We really liked this recipe and I did followed other reviewers suggestions to dredge in flour, then fry on medium high heat  instead of medium.   I first simmered the sauce  separately to reduce while browning the chicken.  However it was a tad too spicy for us and we do like spice.  I will make it again but add only 1 1/2 T of the sriracha sauce and up the honey to 3T.  We like it a little sweeter.  I also simmered separately, red and yellow peppers, carrots, red onions and added some pineapple chunks at the end. It's a tasty way to add any stir fry type veggies so it becomes a complete meal.  We all know we should eat more veggies and even veggie haters should like them this way! I also liked that there is very little oil in this recipe so it's pretty healthy too.

Very delicious! I dusted my chicken strips lightly with flour like several other reviewers, and I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and some chili powder. I browned it, then I added some sliced onion, frozen sliced bell peppers, and frozen french green beans. I let the water from the frozen items cook out some, then I added the sauce and let simmer for eight minutes. One more tweak in the sauce, I used finely chopped fresh ginger from a tube, Gourmet Garden brand, I love that stuff! It keeps so much longer in the fridge than fresh items! Anyway, the chicken was sweet, sticky, and spicy, and was great served over white rice!

I was really looking forward to this dish but it was a little disappointing. I thought it was a bit too salty and not at all that sweet. I omitted the hot sauce and just wanted it sweet & sticky. I added an extra teaspoon of brown sugar to sweeten it more but it didn't really help. My husband took over and added Mirin, which helped a lot. He cooked the chicken in sesame oil and also added waterchestnuts, bamboo shoots & broccoli to make it more of a stir fry. We put it over rice. The sauce didn't thicken so he added cornstarch and it helped a little but after mixing everything with it, there wasn't much sauce left. It was enough to coat the chicken and vegetables but it wasn't saucy and that's how I like it. Not sure we'll try this one again. It was decent and we did eat it but I've had better.

Very tasty and cooked perfectly. I added broccoli to mine. I wont crave this as much as typical Chinese food (must be the MSG!) but will definitely be making again.

Very good!  I really enjoyed this.  Although, I did coat the chicken in flour that I had seasoned with salt and pepper before browning it.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I only used two chicken breasts but did not half the recipe for the sauce so I think if you were using four breasts, you may want to make a bit more sauce.

Very good!! I added cashews, green onions and a bell pepper and served over rice. As others suggested I dredged my chicken in flour and reduced my sauce as the chicken was cooking. Will def. make again.

This is so good.  I cooked sauce while preparing chicken.  I also added red pepper flakes and extra honey, chia seeds and just a tad of corn starch.  I gave this 5 stars because I altered this great recipe to my liking.  Thanks for sharing.

My entire family loved this dish.  I sliced my partially frozen chicken breasts on the diagonal, so they cooked quicky.  I did toss them in flour/salt/pepper as other reviews suggested.  This helped the sauce thicken up nicely.  For the sauce - I didn't have any hot sauce, but subbed half the amount of red pepper flakes.  Really delicious flavor, a keeper recipe!

It was very good.  I halved the hot sauce and it was still a little too much for my family.  I doubled the sauce.  I dredged the chicken in a flour/cornstarch mixture with a little salt and pepper (I omitted the s&p from the sauce) and it thickened up very nicely.  Will definitely make it again.  Oh, and added some sliced carrots.  Broccoli would be good too.

This is a variation on a theme; I have a similar recipe that I LOVE and I often use to prepare large amounts of chicken drums and thighs for large family get-togethers.  I double  the liquid ingredients and add ketchup in the same amount as the soy sauce. I do not fry the drums and thighs but put them in a large roasting pan., drizzle the sauce over it and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. I often make this recipe using 10 lbs of drums and thighs. It is always a crowd-pleaser! I never tried it with boneless breasts on the stovetop but will be making it for new years eve!  Thanks for the recipe!

Sadly, this has been in my recipe box for some time and I haven't tried it till now. An excellent recipe. Great flavor. I did the sauce on the side with a bit of cornstarch and added it back to the chicken ( and onions & broccoli). Using fresh ginger is the only way to go.  Way better than any takeout. Thanks

This is a great recipe, I did follow the reviews though and dredge my chicken in flour and pepper.  I also cooked the chicken on high heat to give it that nice crispy-ness, turned it over for a couple minutes then lowered the temp and added the sauce. It worked out great, the chicken was crispy and the sauce was nice and thick. Great recipe thank you for sharing!!

Made this for dinner last night, doubled the ingredients for a big batch. Used a bunch of veggies: corn, peppers, onions, broccoli. Was very good over brown rice. Honestly, I thought it was face meltingly hot (I used sriracha, rooster sauce) will definitely not use as much nest time mostly because I want to taste all the other awesome flavors, not just HOT! Still a great base to tweak to your liking.

As a new cook I found this to be very easy and very yummy! I have served it to a few guests and they all love it as well.
I use a little more ginger and only 1 tbs of rooster sauce because I don't do well with heat. My boyfriend adds more hot sauce to his but says it blends well even after cooking.
I also toss in some bell peppers and onions and let them simmer in the pan for a little while to soak up the sauce. Without the veggies I thought it was a little lack luster but adding them in makes this a really tasty dish we never have leftovers.

This is a fast and easy recipe. The trick to getting a thick sauce is using superior dark soya sauce.

This was excellent!!  I had to omit the hot sauce because BF can't handle it, but I did sneak in a few pinches of red pepper flakes.  The only other change I made was to flour+cornstarch coat the chicken pieces (4T ea, in a bowl, used tongs and coated in batches) because I've been wanting to try that.  Worked great, and it helped the sauce to thicken up quickly once that was added.  I made a mix of veggies to go along with this but don't think I'll bother with so much next time, maybe just a little broccoli and carrots.  Oh, I did saute some onions before the chicken, will keep those, they were super good in it.  Served over white rice. Most definitely a keeper for us!  BF went nuts for it.  Ok, so did I.  Thanks for sharing :)

Oh my! So amazing and perfect! My chicken got perfectly "sticky" I took the advice and dredged my chicken in flour and i let it cook in the sauce until it reduced to a sticky mess. I worked at a chinese restaurant for 2 years and this totally fits the bill of the general chicken. Thank you kate for giving me an amazing dinner!

Great recipe - I doubled the sauce.  Next time i would add a little extra sweet and cut the soy sauce a bit because it was a bit overpowering, but it was delicious!

Wow, this is a very good recipe! I made a couple of changes to this recipe, someone suggested to cook chicken on med high heat instead of medium heat which I did. Second change I did was on the chicken strips, I put 3 tablespoon cornstarch and an egg and mixed it with the salt and pepper.

The chicken was perfectly tender and moist. 
And The taste was "spot on" as chef Ramsay would say! 
My boyfriend loved it and wants me to make it again for a potluck we are hosting. 

Thank you for putting this up!

My new favorite dish.  After finishing it up last night, my son asked me if we could have it for dinner again tonight.  Mine did not get sticky either but I thought it was because I added a package of sliced mushrooms and a sliced red onion after I cooked the chicken.  I then coated the mixture with the sauce and cooked as directed.  It made the dish more of a stir-fry.  Delicious.

The only thing I did that was different from this recipe was to shake the pieces of chicken in corn starch.  I fried them in canola oil.  I drained them on some paper towel, before pouring the sauce over them.

This recipe was unbelievable!! I did shake the chicken in a plastic bag before dropping in the hot oil in high heat for a few minutes. Also, for the sauce I mixed in a tbs of ground ginger, a dash of red pepper and a tbs of tobasco. It was spicy! but my husband and I enjoy very hot food. Sauce came out sticky because I simmered it for about 2 minutes before dropping it in the chicken and lowering the heat to low. Also covered it for the last 5 minutes with a lid. Will definitely make again. Great taste!

My kids don't do spice, so I had to leave out the hot sauce. I suspect I would have thought it a 5 star recipe had I been able to use the hot sauce. Thank you so much for a quick easy meal that we all liked, I will make it again!

Full of flavor!  I cut down the hot sauce a bit, and might cut back more next time.  I agree that it isn't so sticky, but it does taste good.  I made mine with crispy fried tofu strips and small pieces of bell pepper.  I think beef would work well, too.

I did not care for this recipe. My first problem is I should have never salted the chicken as the recipe suggests. Once the soy sauce is added there is more than enough salt to give the chicken flavor. This recipe was just way too plain for my taste. I love asian inspired food and this just did not satisfy it for me.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. I did change it just a little; only added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, a pinch of ground ginger, and I did dredge the chicken strips in flour after seasoning them with salt and pepper. Dredging them in flour really helped thicken up the sauce and also gave the chicken a nice crispy coating. Next time I make this I will probably either add another teaspoon of brown sugar or cut down the hot sauce to 1-1/2 tablespoons.

This recipe had been stashed untried in my recipe box for awhile. I had chicken breasts on hand, but very few ingredients to make it into an interesting dinner. Voila'! The ingredients listed here are readily available, so it was an easy choice for me. In spite of having 2 T. of hot sauce in it, it was not overly hot. My daughter who does not like spicy food thought it was good; the rest of us loved it. If you want to add some heat, I'd add some red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper to the sauce. On its own, however, it is easy to make, quick to put on the table and yummy! I'll be making this one again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a good base recipe and we loved the flavors.  I did modify the recipe slightly based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I subbed 2 tablespoons of agave nectar for the brown sugar and honey.  I used Siracha (sp?) as another reviewer indicated.  I also had some Sweet Chili Garlic sauce in the fridge so I added about a tablespoon or so.  I used only 2 chicken breasts (as there are only 2 of us) and dredged them in Cornstarch/Flour/Salt/Pepper before sauteeing them crisp in olive oil (pure, not evoo).  This got the chicken nice and crispy and also allowed the sauce to thicken and get "sticky" quickly.  I served this with crisp sauteed veggies and Thai sticky rice.  Because I used the Siracha, Sweet Chili Garlic and both fresh garlic and fresh ginger, this dish had a bit of a bite to it, but I WILL be putting this one in my recipe box and making again soon.  It was quick and easy and very very tasty...much better than any takeout when you've got that craving for Asian food.

Delicious! In my version, I marinated the chicken in a paste of soy/oyster sauce/sugar/cornstarch for about an hour. Added four chopped scallions to the aromatic veg. Sauce started thickening instantly when added to the pan, and after the chicken was returned, finished in about a minute. This recipe adapts easily to many variations according to what's in the pantry. Leftovers reheat very well.

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly as stated except I used 2 chicken breasts instead of 4 (since it's only my husband and me). I had no problems with the sauce becoming thick and it had a really nice kick to it. I served it on top of basmati rice with steamed sugar snap peas on the side. Great recipe, I'll definitely be making this again!

LOVE THIS.  My husband is a huge fan of this.  But I do suggest you use low sodium soy sauce or it will be really salty.  But after that adjustment its a delicious dish.

After cutting 4 chicken breasts into chunks, I tossed with about 3/4 cup of flour, salt, pepper and paparika.  I diced about 1/2 med. onion and cooked with 1 clove fresh garlic and about 1 TBSP of olive oil.  I then added the rest of the sauce ingredients and cooked until the thickness I wanted.  I then browned the chicken in a little more olive oil then added to the sauce and cooked until done.  I only added 1 TBSP of sriracha hot chili sauce even though I doubled sauce and it was the perfect amt for us.  I almost forgot, I didn't double the amt of soy sauce either, I just substituted 1/4 cup of water with a chicken bouillon cube instead of an additional 1/4 cup of soy sauce. Slightly spicy and sweet.  Loved it and will make often!

Delicious.  I used crystalized ginger and a little ginger powder because I didn't have fresh ginger on hand.  Next time I will try it with fresh ginger.  I doubled the sauce and used some with some shrimp I had on hand.  Also very good.   I also added about a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken it up a little more.  This ones a definite keeper!

Dredged chicken in flour, as others suggested.  Halved hot sauce, as hubby isn't a big fan of spice.  I've made this probably 4 times so far.  Very good!

This was amazing! My family loved this recipe. I did follow the advice of others by coating it flour and frying it but I also cut the chicken into bite sized peices and added pre cooked shrimp in the last two miuntes of cooking. And seriously when i went back for seconds they were coming out for thirds they ate it that fast. Will definitly make again and again.

Too hot for me, I ended up rinsing off the chicken and started the sauce over.  I added 1/2 tsp ginger instead of 2 tsp and about 2 tsp of hot sauce instead of 2 tbsp and loved it. Great flavor, I'm too weak for 2 tbsp of hot sauce!

This is a tasty and creative recipe.  I've used it several times with tofu and it turns out great.  I don't care much for hot sauce, so I substitute with red chili powder.  Delicious!

This made a good dinner! According to other reviewers, I shook the chicken in flour after sprinkling black flour on it. Then I doubled the sauce. I added NO extra salt because soy sauce is so salty on its own.  I had mushroom soy sauce and Tamari soy sauce on hand, so I used half-half. Honestly, I felt that the soy sauce was very overpowering. In the future I would use maybe half of what the recipe calls for in terms of the soy sauce, and substitute chicken broth or water. It was the main flavor I tasted, and a little on the salty side.

This was awesome. I was a little concerned at first that my kids would find it too spicy, but everyone loved it.  It does have a little kick though!  I followed others advice to flour and brown the chicken.  I then removed the chicken from the pan and in the same drippings, sauteed 1 red and 1 green pepper.  I then added the chicken back to the pan with the sauce (which I had simmered in a pan for about 10 minutes to thicken it slightly) and then simmered everything together for about 10 minutes. I finished the sauce with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and green onion. Delicious!

To get the sauce to be sticky you need to bring everything to a rapid boil, not just a simmer. Always make more sauce.

This is a great, quick recipe that takes boring chicken to a new level. More often than not, this is the recipe my husband requests when we have uncooked chicken on hand. I usually make a few adjustments to the recipe. I exchange a generous sprinkling of red pepper flakes for the hot sauce (to me, the vinegar base of the hot sauce detracts from the overall flavor of the dish). I cut the chicken into chunks rather than strips—the chunks seem to soak up the delicious sauce better and it's faster to cut chunks than strips. I also usually water down the soy sauce, so it's probably more like 1/8-cup soy sauce and 1/8-cup water, just to reduce the saltiness of the dish a bit.

This stuff is really great! I've made it several times. I did double the sauce and served it over white rice with steamed brocoli on the side.

I made this tonight and am already posting a rating because it was that good. Hubby said it was restaurant-quality and delicious (and he's not one to lie to save my feelings - last night's dinner was "bland"). I doubled the brown sugar and reduced the soy sauce to 3 Tbsp. Also reduced the ginger because I was using dried. With the chicken, I dredged it in a flour/ wheat germ/ paprika mixture before frying (didn't bother with salt, as the soy sauce has plenty), and then removed it from the pan. I simmered the sauce alone for 4 minutes, then put the chicken back in and simmered everything together for another 4 minutes. As the name of the recipe implies, it was sweet, sticky, and spicy. I served it over steamed white rice, and we both ate too much. Will definitely make it again.

Just Ok. Made it the other night and it was just ok for us. I think my ginger may have beena little old, though. I definitely got the heat...but not the sweet. Not bad, just not good enough to earn a spot in "the rotation". Not my "it" chicken asian recipe.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this! And so did my husband..so much so that we were fighting over who was going to lick the  serving spoon before we tossed it in the dishwasher! The only thing was...I used 2 tablespoons of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce instead of regular hot sauce and it was SO spicy. I should have known better..so it's my own fault for not scaling down the measurement. I also added scallions and served it on top of white rice from the Chinese restaurant. It was EXCELLENT!! Quick..easy and wonderful!!

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because even though it wasVERY easy to make, it was just very salty. I think next time i will cut the soy sauce & garlic in half. Other than that, it had amazing flavor and was super easy to make. Will be making again soon though =]

This was awesome.  I did use the suggestion of dredging the chicken in flour and it helped thicken the sauce quicker.  I will make this again and next time I think I will add water chestnuts for crunch.

Really great flavour.  The dark colour of the soy turned the kids off, but they did try it:  succes with one and not so much success with the other.  Perhaps I should try less soy sauce, or use the "light" version?  My husband and I loved it.  I did follow one reviewers suggestions and put the chicken pieces in a little flour with salt and pepper in a ziploc baggie before heating up.  If you use enough honey, it really does end up "sticky."  Thanks!

This is absolutely delicious. By sheer chance, I made the sauce before I started preparing the chicken, so the garlic and ginger had a nice bit of time to permeate the other  ingredients. I also followed others' advice and cubed the chicken and dredged it in flour before frying. The coating kept the chicken nice and juicy, and the sauce is so pungent that the chicken still absorbed the flavor, even with the coating. I was bringing it to a family dinner and wanted to add some vegetables without spoiling the taste of the sauce (which is perfect). So I made some extra sauce, simmered cubed red and yellow peppers separately in that, drained the sauce from the peppers, and mixed everything together just before serving. I think next time, I'll try adding scallions or onions as well. It was a huge hit. I can't thank you enough for this recipe!!!

I have to admit I've never made anything like this before so this review is based on taste not authenticity. The hot certainly was HOT (but that is an individual preference I guess) but it balanced out very nicely with the sweet aftertastes. My husband suggested (with tears rolling down his cheeks!) that I make this again next week but add a little crunch like water chestnuts or celery.  I think adding cashews or sesame seeds would be good too. This recipe is a great starting point for me to a whole new cooking cuisine. I WILL make it again, exactly as written. Thanks Kate.  This one's a keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe but made the following changes:  I lcut my chicken into cubes and lightly coated them with flour.  I also allowed the sauce to cook by itself for 5-6 min while I prepared and browned the chicken and then added the sauce when it was thicker.  It was great but next time I'll saute some veggies and onions to add to the mix.  It felt slightly boring.....

Excellent recipe! Stands up on its own but my family loves it so much I switch it up every now and again by adding steamed broccoli or water chestnuts, have also done toasted sesame and peanuts but as I said it stands up on its own. The only change I make is to brown the chicken  breast , then I slice then into strips. I always carmelize onions in the pan after removing the chicken breasts(we love them). Thanks for this great recipe!!

Excellent recipe---and easy to adjust for one serving.  I served it over couscous and loved it!  Because chicken breasts go from lovely to tough in a heartbeat, I cooked the chicken and sauce separately.  Took other suggestions and gave the chicken a light dusting of flour; browned it and added to the thickened sauce, cooking for only a couple minutes.  Perfect!

EXCELLENT!  I basically kept the same recipe, except I put salt, pepper and flour in a zip lock bag and shook the chicken to coat.  I tripled the recipe and used 3 pounds of chicken and it fed 10 people easily.  I also dry roasted some sesame seeds and added it to the mixture.  There aren't many recipes that I come across that every one (4 adults and 6 kids) likes/loves and this is one of the few!  Will definitely save this one and make again!  Thanks for sharing!

I also followed the advice of the others and coated my chicken in flour. I also used ginger soy sauce, which made a huge difference. I like how you can make it as hot (or not) as you prefer. This is deliciously sticky, sweet and spicy!

Very delicious recipe. Reminds me of General Tso's chicken. It was too spicy for me. To get an idea of my tolerance, I usually eat medium heat salsa. The second time I made this I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken cubes in it for about five hours. Then I discarded the marinade and cooked the chicken in the remaining sauce. I ate the leftovers on a salad for lunch today. It was even better the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish was awesome.  The sauce didn't get as thick as I anticipated but maybe didn't simmer long enough or could add flour or starch next time.  :-}

This was very good. My husband really liked it, which is a big deal. It was easy to make. I did not have regular hot sauce, so I used sriracha sauce. If you do this, you might want to lessen the amount unless you like it very hot. I agree it didn't thicken well. I did not want to take the time to dredge my chicken in flour, so I simply added a little cornstarch right before I served it. It thickened it right up, and seemed more true to the Asian roots of the recipe.

Pretty darn good and the boys got 2nds, which surprised me. I coated the chicken in flour and sauteed half a yellow onion to add in as others suggested. I doubled the sauce but then ended up using only half because it was intensly soy sauce-y despite all the add-ins. I also used chinese hot chili garlic sauce in place of the hot sauce. I would make a few additional tweaks next time. Less ginger. And I would like to cut the intensity of the soy sauce perhaps by using about 2/3 of the amt called for and substituting the other 1/3 with orange juice. Quick-streamed brocolli would be an excellent addition to this recipe. (We had it on the side and I ended up mixing mine in.) It was, indeed, sweet, spicy and sticky!

This was so good! As suggested, I covered the chicken in flour, and I also substituted a little bit of garlic salt for fresh garlic, and used ginger powder.  Delicious and not hard at all.  (Tastes good with ketchup...)

Very Yummy!! It is 5 stars once I made several modifications. I added sliced scallions and a bit more brown sugar & honey. I used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger. Next time, I will definitely use less soy sauce!

This was a VERY tasty dish and I'm so glad that I found it! Here is how I modified it: I coated the chicken with flour and salt and pepper and didn't use any ginger- forgot to buy it- and then used 1/8 cup teriyaki and 1/8 cup soy sauce, just to reduce the sodium a bit. It was pretty spicy- I used Sirachi sauce which I agree is a MUST- so next time I may make it a tad sweeter. Tasted even better than a restaurant!

Love this! I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and shook in in a bag with flour before frying. A little on the salty side so I might try low salt soy sauce next time. Served over rice, hubby loved it.

I made this for a Super Bowl party. I made enough for 60 people and it was just wonderful. The only changes I made were I added some chopped green onions and sesame seeds to it at the end. I also thickened it a little with corn starch. Every drop was eaten and I could have used more. I will be making this again for sure.

This turned out really good!  I did take others advice in their reviews and floured my chicken before cooking it and I think it really helped the sauce thicken up during cooking too cause ours was really thick and syrupy.  I also cubed my chicken instead of cutting it into strips and it turned out really good.  It is really spicy though, but we like it that way!

This is quite tasty and easy.  I dredged the chicken strips in flour before cooking them.  I added sauce after briefly searing on a pan that had been sprayed with olive oil spray.  I liked the flavor (though I added the quantity of fresh garlic and fresh ginger) and it took me two seconds to put this together.  Thanks!

I used low sodium soy sauce and doubled the sauce and am glad I did both! I added some broccoli florets, served it over brown rice, and topped it with chopped scallions. My boyfriend SCARFED it down! It's really yummy and easy to make!

This was fantastic!  I had to make some changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients......I used Tabasco sauce in place of the hot sauce (and only used 1/4 of the amount stated), I added more honey + half of a fresh lemon........DELICIOUS!!!!

This was very simple and pretty good. I left out the hot sauce b/c my husband and kids are not big on heat, but I bet it would have been very good with a little heat! Mine ended up needing another pinch or so of brown sugar and it came out a little on the watery side so I mixed 1 tsp of cornstarch with a little cold water and mixed that in - that did the trick. All in all a good meal to serve in very little time.

Add more sugar next time. Spicy, but not as sweet as I would have liked. Soy had an overbearing flavor.

I wish I'd read the previous reviews about flouring the chicken first because my sauce never thickened.  The flavor was very good.  I just wanted more of a thick consitency to the sauce.  I will definitely make it again but flour the chicken.

I love this recipe!  I follow other reviewers comments and double the sauce.  I also replace the fresh ginger with 1 teaspoon of ground ginger for the doubled recipe because I don't like a strong ginger taste.  I add a dash of chili oil in place of the hot sauce.  I've cooked this with larger pieces of chicken and it comes out fine, especially with the extra sauce.  I make this again and again.

I made this yesterday and my whole family LOVED it.  It is very rare everyone likes the same thing.  It tastes just like authentic Chinese chicken. I only put in one Tbls. hot sauce.  I didn't think my kids would like it so spicy.  I opted to use an immersion blender to mix the ingredients together and then marinated the chicken for a few hours.  Then I put the it all into an 8X8 Pyrex oven dish and baked for 45 minutes.  Also, I made sure to pound out the chicken beforehand so it would be tender.  Tastes great with plain rice and broccoli.  Definitely a keeper.

This was really easy and good. I steamed the broccoli seperately and added it to the end. I also coated the chicken with flour prior to cooking and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the sauce when cooking. Overall very good. Would definitely make again!

Followed advice from others:  dredged chicken in flour, doubled the sauce ingredients, and added frozen broccoli for the last 5-7 minutes.  Sauce was thick enough; easy recipe with interesting flavours and it would have been fantastic if I hadn't doubled the hot sauce.  My husband loved it but it was so hot that I couldn't eat it.  I had to add a lot of sour cream to my serving!  Will make it again with less hot sauce next time.

Excellent! BF said this chicken was "off the hook". I did not have fresh ginger so had to use dried. Used thighs instead of breast. I also dredged the chicken in flour first. The sauce thickened up perfect. Will be making again.

My family went crazy for this.  Although mine did not get that sticky, and I really can't figure out why! I did exactly what it says.  Regardless, it still was delicious! I served it with rice and it was gone in a flash.   So, I made this again.  I floured the chicken as suggested, and it came great!  I wouldn’t say it was "sticky" but it was thicker, and everyone loved it.  This will, without a doubt, be on our dinner rotation.  Thanks!

Edit 2016:  I have been making this now for 8 years and I must say, every time I make it I want to drink up the sauce. What I usually do now is brown the chicken in an oven safe skillet. Mix up the sauce and add about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Pour the sauce over then chicken and throw it in the oven until cooked. This usually gets us the best consistency. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds and serve with rice and any veggie.  My family still goes crazy over this, there's never any leftovers!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I followed the advice of some reviewers and coated the chicken pieces with flour before I cooked them.  This makes the sauce thicken without any added cornstarch.  I add a spash of sesame seed oil to the sauce.  Very good

Took longer to thicken up the sauce then the recipe calls for.  Very good, and very little ginger flavor just some of the tangy taste. The chicken and sauce are really good mized into rice and veggies.  i used uncel bens fried rice that i mixed it into.

This recipe is amazing!  Two musts to make it perfect...dredge your chicken pieces in flour and you must use ROOSTER sauce; it can be located in your oriental foods section by the soy sauce.  We use 1 tsp because it is very hot!  I omit the ginger and double the garlic it's up to you but we love garlic. All my friends and family love this recipe!

The chicken and sauce is delicious.  I used Rooster sauce, too, and it was REALLY REALLY hot.  I used all four Tbls (doubled the sauce) but next time I will cut that in half.  Can't wait to make this again!!

This recipe is very easy to put together, and tastes like I got it from a Chinese restaurant!  The one change I made was: instead of just browning the chicken, I used a cornstarch/salt/pepper/chili powder mixture and coated the chicken with that.  I heated about 1-2 Tbsp of oil and fried the chicken in there, before adding the sauce mixture.  Frying with cornstarch instead of flour gives the chicken that authentic Chinese taste (A trick I learned from the Food Network).   When the chicken and sauce were combined, and sauce thickened, I added sesame seeds for that authentic look. I also chopped some green onions as a garnish after plating.  Thanks for a great recipe, Kate!

This recipe is one of my favorites of all the chinese/asian chicken recipes that Ive made from here!  This was sooo good and flavorful, and sweet, and had a nice kick with a little spice.  I tossed the chicken in a little flour before sauteing.  I also used Sirachi for the hot sauce, which is A LOT spicier than your ordinary hot sauce, so I just used a fourth of what it called for.  I also doubled the sauce since I was serving over rice.  I like mine saucey!  I also added just a touch more honey to get more of a stickiness to the sauce.  This was super fast and easy to make.  Definitely a favorite for us and will be going into the regular meal rotation!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was one of the best recipes i have ever made. Taste like chinese food (honey seared chicken). I did like other reviewers said and dredged the chicken in flour first. I also doubled the sauce because the original recipe does not make enough. Will make this again and again. I think the sauce would be great on ribs too!

I'm only giving this three stars, but it has serious potential for 5. The problem: it was SOOOOO spicy!!! It was practically inedible.  I read some of the reviews before I made it and got the idea of using the Rooster hot sauce...  If you do that, SERIOUSLY CONSIDER cutting the amount of hot sauce from 2 tbsp to about a half of a tbsp.  It smelled great while cooking and I couldn't wait to dig in, but it was uncomfortably hot!

As per other reviews, I coat the chicken in flour--never had a problem with the sauce being too thin. I served this once with diced and sauteed red pepper to give the dish more color--made it spicier too! Served with white rice and egg rolls. This dish is fabulous--tastes like something from a restaurant. One of my favorite recipes from this site-- serving it makes me feel like an accomplished chef!

This had a fantastic flavor!  I have been looking for a sauce recipe like this for so long.  I've tried dozens of store bought versions but nothing compares!  Like other reviewers, I dredged the chicken cubes in flour before browning.  I also added onions and peppers to the mix.  Our family likes our food fairly mild (flavorful, but not super spicy) so I cut the sriracha hot sauce to just 1 tablespoon and this was still too much for us.  Next time, I will use 1-2 teaspoons to gear the spice down a bit.  I know this sounds trite, but this recipe has definitely made it into the rotation.

This was an awesome recipe! It kind of reminded me of General Tao Chicken that you can get at Asian restaurants. I think that these changes are necessary: I reduced the soy sauce by half, increased the honey by 1/2 tablespoon, and--*this is key*--tossed the chicken pieces in flour (with a dash of salt and pepper). I cooked the chicken at a high temperature until it was nicely browned, and then added the sauce and cooked for 20 minutes at a low temperature. The flour makes the sauce thicken nicely. Lastly, I used Chili Garlic Sauce for the hot sauce, which worked really well. Yum!

Delicious! I was looking for a different way to cook chicken and I found it with this recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and coated the chicken with flour before browning. (I cut the chicken into bite-size chunks too.)  I also doubled the sauce and heated it separately before combining it with the chicken.  This sauce is very tasty and it really sticks to the chicken so every bite is so flavorful. I didn't have garlic or ginger, so I used the powdered variety.  The whole family loved it and asked that I make it again.  It's a keeper!

Eh, it was okay. I followed the recipe to a T..w/ the exception of the garlic.  I didn't have fresh so I used powder.  It was good, but I probably won't make again.  Christopher liked it so I gave it 4 stars.

This chicken was awesome!   I made exactly as the recipe stated and it was absolutely delicious!  My chicken did not get sticky, the sauce did reduce and get thicker, but it was still saucy.  Regardless, it was delicious.  I served this over brown rice and the sauce tasted great over the rice.  Also served this alongside roasted asparagus and mushrooms (recipe on this website) and it was wonderful with it.  Thank you, thank you for great recipe  -  this will be made at our house alot.

Wowza!  Spicy!  I cut the hot sauce in half and still cleaned out my sinuses.  Whew.  It was very good, but I think (because I'm a hot wimp) that I'll cut down the hot sauce yet again.

This is an awesome recipe! However, I did do some adaptations (thus only 4stars)... I rolled the chicken pieces in rye flour, (they browned sooo nicely - and rather quickly - on med high heat.)used a bit of extra garlic, added some chopped red onions, didn't have hot sauce so I used sharp paprika... I used raw brown sugar (along with the rye flour it is a healthier option than the packed br. sug.) I also didn't have any problems to make the chicken sticky... to make a little more sauce - I added a bit of very hot (nearly boiling) water and stirred immediately. My husband loved it - was asking for more, I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!!!!!! (I served with broccoli + Basmati rice)

I took the advice of a lot of reviewers and went with bite size chicken pieces dredged in flour. Had the coating and texture of any breaded chicken you would get at a Chinese restaurant. Very good.

This was very good. I had no trouble getting the sauce to thicken. I didn't have any ginger and added a bit more hot sauce but other than that I followed the recipe exact. My husband and I both loved it. Served with rice and green beans.

Yummy!!!!  Just add a little cornstarch to mixture before you put it in the pan with the chicken, it will thicken right up, mine did.  I also floured the chicken so it would brown better.  I doubled the sauce recipe so I would have enough to put over rice.  This dish is so good, I had left overs  for lunch the next day!!

This is an amazing dish. I love spicy and this was just a bit too spicy for me. I will use 1 tablespoon of hot sauce next time. I steamed some frozen stir fry veggies, added it to the chicken mix and put it all over brown rice. I will make this again for sure!

I asked my husband to rate this and he said a 4 out of 5.  He said the spiciness was a nice way to mix things up and said to make it again sometime.  3 changes: I breaded the chicken, used 3 breasts for 3 people with same amount of sauce, and used less hot sauce.  It was still super spicy.  Thanks!

I didn't measure any of the ingredients. Just threw em' in as the chicken was browning and apparently that worked, cuz it was awesome! Very quick and simple! I added some broccoli to the chicken and it went great w/ the sauce, too!

amazing! followed the recipe to a T (minus the ginger as i had none :C ) and it turned out phenomenally. i am by no means an experienced chef (in fact i'm a student who can't be bothered with complicated meals) and this was a simple, delicious meal. highly recommend with rice and a garden salad.

Sweet & spicy... yes. But, I didn't wait to boil down to be sticky because I was in a hurry. I actually think that turned out to be for the best: or it would have been WAY too salty (and I didn't salt the chicken). I gave 4 stars: not so much that it lacked in flavor or ease, but because I didn't like the saltiness, the minimal amount of sauce it made, the chicken cut in strips, the lack of veggies in the recipe and the amount of hot sauce. After not boiling down, halving the hot sauce, doubling the sauce, cutting the chicken in to bite size pieces and adding snow pea-pods, mushrooms, red onion, water chestnuts, & baby corns it became a 5 star for our family that will be made again very soon!

I loved this so much but I am only giving it 4 stars because I did make a couple of changes based on other reviews. I used 4 tablespoons of honey, 3 large cloves of fresh garlic, hot pepper flakes (I didn't have hot sauce) and I added a dash of seaseme oil. I DID NOT salt the chicken, I only used pepper and did not find it too salty as others have mentioned. I also found that it needed to really boil to thicken it up and even then I had to add a little cornstarch. I only used two chicken breasts so that may have been part of the reason why. I then threw in some baby corn, red pepper, and carrots that I had already stir fried. It was awesome! I served this with brown rice and it was all gone!

I love this recipe! I make it exactly as the recipe states and it's sooo easy and so quick! I serve it with some rice and steamed broccoli or asparagus for a really easy dinner. It's very easy to adjust the spice level to your preference. Thank you for this recipe!

Well this recipe was good.  I cooked mine a totally different way and it turned out perfect, sweet, sticky and spicy.  What I did was I had chicken wings so I baked them in the oven until almost done. Took them out drained the juice than added the sauce.  Only thing I changed with the sauce was I added one tablespoon of corn starch so that it would be sticky also since I double it I ran out of soy sauce for the second batch so all I had was terriyaki soy sauce,which added great flavor.  So than when I added the sauce I let the chicken cook uncovered, this helped with browning the chicken off and allowing the sauce thicking.  So when I put the chicken on one big plate, I added the remaining sauce in the pan on the chicken and it came out perfect (we ate it over rice), also since I double the sauce and only added three tablespoons of hot sauce. Thanks this recipe was great it is a keeper.

This recipe was very good but very salty (soy sauce) and a little too hot.  The 2nd time I made it, I cut the soy sauce in 1/2 as well as the hot sauce.  It was delicious over jasmine rice.  Will definitely make again!

It was ok not the best I cut the hot sauce to one teaspoon because my 5 year old isn't a big fan of hot things. I thought she would have liked it but she said that it tased like soap. I diden't find that however next time I will try with the full amount of hot sauce

Excellent!!  One of the best things about this recipe is that I typically have all the ingredients on hand, so it's a great go-to recipe when I have to put dinner together at the last minute. I substituted ground ginger and a few drops of chili oil and it was plenty spicy without being over the top (we have a toddler at the table, so it can't be TOO spicy).  While the chicken was simmering, I put together a Chinese Napa Cabbage Salad and the sauce had thickened perfectly by the time I finished the salad.

Delicious! I followed the reviews and tossed the chicken in some flour before browning them at high heat. I removed the chicken before adding the sauce and scraped up all the gristle and let it simmer for a minute or two, then added the chicken back in to finish cooking. Chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and sticky! Served with rice and stir fry vegetables(pre-mixed frozen bag).

I like it a bit spicier, so I added some extra hot sauce. I also really enjoyed putting green bell peppers in it as well!

I have made this several times and my family loves it! They say it tastes just like a restaurant. I make it just as the recipe says except I double the sauce. I also add veggies like the editor's note suggests. Serve it over white rice and it is a complete meal.

I made this tonight and absolutely love it! I followed the recipe other than I did dredge the chicken with flour as others recommended. It was fast and easy which is important to me. My husband can’t wait for me to make it again. I served it with cauliflower rice and salad.

I followed the recipe, except  I did flour the chicken before browning as others suggested.  I used Sambal for the hot sauce, since the type of hot sauce wasn't given. It was hot but not too hot.  My husband liked it, so I will be making it again.  Thank you for sharing!  It was very tasty!

My family loves this! I use the same ingredients but different proportions to make extra sauce (3X everything but the soy sauce, ginger and hot sauce [sriracha]), and I keep the chicken and sauce separate.  I coat the chicken pieces in cornstarch, cook them and remove them from the pan, then add the sauce ingredients to the same pan. The remnants of cornstarch help it to thicken. Then we serve the sauce over the chicken (with rice and veggies) right before we eat. Chicken stays crunchy and there is a lot of delicious sweet/spicy sauce.

Okay listen, I'm 17 and struggle to make mac and cheese without messing something up. My whole family is trying to diet right now and I've become so tired with plain, old chicken so I took to the internet to find something tasty AND low calorie. By some miracle, I made this dish last night and it tasted so unbelievably delicious. I served it with white rice and some steamed broccoli and it was so darn good that I'm considering making it again tonight. Seriously. The video recipe helped me so much, I followed it exactly and it turned out wonderfully.

Followed others' advice of dredging the chicken in flour and browning it separately first. Once it was browned, took the chicken out of the pan and set aside. Reduced the sauce on medium heat for about 4 minutes until it thickened, added the chicken back in with the onions, green peppers, broccoli and cooked everything together for 5-6 minutes on medium/high heat. Turned out amazing!

The sauce thickened up fine for me (I guess that was an issue some people were having?), I used dark brown sugar. Maybe the higher molasses content helped? I'm not a chef so I wouldn't know for sure. It was a little too salty for me, so next time I make it I may cut back on the soy sauce or add more honey.

Very nice recipe.  As others have commented it is not sticky.    I remedied this by coating the chicken in corn starch prior to frying.  Toss the fried chicken in the simmering sauce and the sauce thickened up nicely.  The chicken is sweet/savory and sticky.  Good served with brown rice and steamed broccoli.

In our quest to eat lighter and lose some of these middle aged pounds we have acquired, we are eating more chicken breasts. Did I mention...I don't like chicken breasts? So I scour recipe sites and calculate calories and all so I can find something palatable.  This recipe went beyond that for me. I really liked it a lot! The right amount of sweet and spicy! It will be on our keeper list even when we accomplish our weight loss goals! Thanks for a winning recipe!!

Tasted great! The sauce does burn, and doesn't thicken up real well when cooked with the chicken, which isn't a problem in the taste department. Dredging through flour was a good tip. I was low on chicken so subbed in a package of sliced baby bellas for the difference, will do again! Sliced onions sautéed and then added back in at the end was good. I used a habenero based hot sauce, and loved the slow, building heat it gave this dish. Also a dash of red pepper. Will make again! (And when you do future self, go easy on the oil, and go ahead and cook the mushrooms and sauce with the bird after a head start)

This was ok. I wouldn't call it a keeper though. Like others I cut back on the chicken and added vegetables but it was like just missing something. Sesame oil? Cashews?

Was definitely not sticky. Had to use cornflower to thicken sauce. The sauce however was flavoursome and nice. I'd cook again.

Like most cooks added flour to the chicken. Used sambal instead of hot sauce. Served it with fried rice and broccoli. Flavor was really good, kids and wife loved it and will for sure make it again.

Although I'm tempted to give it 5 stars because my family all loved it, I felt it was lacking something.  Also, I think it would be EXTREMELY spicy as written.  I used 1/2 Tablespoon, so a quarter of the spice, and it still had a real kick.  I did dredge in flour first, and the sauce did thicken up.  Probably because I  didn't use as much hot sauce, the color was lacking, so I felt that it didn't look as appetizing as I expected.  The flavor was good though, and based on my family's reviews, I will make it again.

I added Sriracha  instead of regular hot sauce and it added a kick! I also sprinkled some flour over the chicken and sauce mixture then mixed it in to thicken the sauce up. After i added the flour i let the mixture thicken over low heat. I am very impressed with this recipe and it was spicy, sweet, and sticky!

I thought this was a good recipe.  The only change I made was coating the chicken in Panko and cooking in oil so that the chicken got crispy.  Then just put the sauce over the chicken and cook till hot.  My family loved it!

The taste is nice, it was quick and fun to make. Changed the recipe somewhat, though, after having read the suggestions.
I added pineapple, like suggested, but instead of draining it, I also threw in the syrup.
Then I let it all simmer until the chicken was nicely done and still juicy and then I took it out with a slotted spoon and set it aside.
I let the sauce caramelize and then put the chicken and pineapple back in and mixed it up till it was sticky and good.

I did as others suggested and lightly floured the chicken before cooking in the oil. I used cubed chicken tenders as well. I also added onions and peppers. Next time I will double the sauce, there wasn't a whole lot to spare. 
My family loved this dish. It will be a regular dish in our house now.

Loved this ... Easy, quick and delicious! BUT when I taste tested it before serving I realized in seconds flat it would be way yummier if I added PINEAPPLE chunks! So I opened up a quick tin, drained it and added the pineapple to skillet and tossed them in to blend in with the sauce, chicken, onion and peppers. Kids loved it and so did I. Will make it again for sure. Oh and I dredged the chicken in flour like others suggested.

Great flavors. I dredged the chicken in flour, salt, pepper.  I also microwave/steamed some broccoli, red pepper, and carrot to soften them up.  Used siracha hot sauce in the sauce. Cooked the chicken, removed it then put the sauce in the pan....after awhile added the chicken and veggies, eventually had to add some corn starch to thicken.  It was delish and will definitely make again.

After reading other reviews, I followed the advice to 'flour' the chicken pieces before searing them.  I added 2 Tb of flour and 2 Tb of cornstarch to a zip lock bag, added the bite size pieces (my knife skills for cutting strips isn't all that great), and shook them a few times to evenly coat them.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients and heated up separately in a small saucepan.  Hot sauce of choice was Sriracha.  After adding the heated sauce to the chicken pieces, it only took 3-4 mins for the sauce to thicken and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  I served it with basmati rice using chicken stock in place of water, and steamed broccoli.  My son who cooks for a living, said the meal was restaurant quality!

Turned out fabulous.  Just recommend you tweek the ingredients to your pallet (ie: spice, heat).  You know yourself the best.  You make or break your own cooking experience.  
My rule of thumb.  If you can take the heat - don't get out of the kitchen, just use less hot sauce :D

Make sure not to use a hot sauce that has too much salt in it, I used a sweet as spicy one and it was like I was eating chicken drenched in pure salt. Way to much Soy sauce not enough sweet. The sauce overall was not sticky either so I had to add a few other things to make it bearable.

Probably deserves 4.5/5 - but I will say when I doubled the recipe do NOT do as I did and doubled the amount of soya sauce  -too salty!
But otherwise very yummy! The girls loved it!!

I'm not sure what all the reviewers are talking about when they say they sauce did not reduce. I did cut the hot sauce in half to accommodate 2 small children. The sauce reduced perfectly in 8 minutes and the chicken was cooked through. We served over Udon noodles with a bag of frozen veggies thrown in. My VERY picky 5 year old (who doesn't eat ANYTHING) told me it was the best thing I've ever made. My husband (who thoroughly enjoys acting as a food critic) told me he was disappointed there weren't leftovers. Apparently, I now have to make this once a week.

As others have mentioned, I dredged the chicken in flour and started simmering the sauce early. I also added onion and broccoli.

I didn't have enough sauce to really have the rice soak it in. Next time I will try 1.5x the sauce recipe.

My husband who does not like chicken ate it all and enjoyed the flavor.  We all liked it, however, I overcooked the chicken.  i should have made thicker pieces and next time i might cook the sauce a little before putting the meat back in.  The recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is so simple and delicious! I used thighs one time and breasts the second time. The thighs were much better, as the breasts were a little dry. Will definitely make again! Thank you for posting!

I made this last night, and my husband and I both loved it!  I added a little more garlic and fresh ginger because I grated more than it called for.  Used sambal oelek as the hot sauce - was really good.  Didn't bother thickening or reducing down or flouring the chicken because I wanted lots of sauce for the rice.  Will definitely make again!

One of the tastiest dishes from AllRecipes that we've ever made. It really does taste like it comes from a restaurant! We also dredged the chicken in flour and doubled the sauce like other reviewers. Served over brown rice with some chili garlic sauce...amazing!

Tastes great! It wasn't sticky, but i didn't want it to be so i didn't let it reduce as much. I only used one tablespoon of hot sauce because i'm not used to very spicy foods but it tasted amazing with rice onions and brocoli!

This was really yummy!  I doubled the sauce (except I only used 1 Tbsp of hot sauce).  I dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with salt and pepper and browned it well before adding the sauce. Then, separately, I stir fried sliced onions, bell pepper, broccoli  and mushrooms, and I served the veggies and chicken together over sticky rice. A definite keeper!

It was far too much soy sauce and ginger, completely overwhelmed the chicken.  I would not make it again.

Fantastic recipe. I stir fried the chicken first. Did not use flour as some noted - corn starch added later. Made the sauce separately (doubled) - used more garlic and ginger than recipe called for and added sesame seeds to it. Sauted onion, red pepper and some broccoli, then added back chicken and sauce. Once sauce is boiling I added some cornstarch mixed with water slowly until the sauce thickened. Viola - served with rice and some chopped cashews on top.

I didn't have a problem getting the sauce to thicken up and get sticky. Which surprises me more than anyone because as cooking goes I'm a novice at best. Here's what I did.

I made this using the pre-cooked chicken strips from Tyson. First I browned the strips in a hot skillet with a little oil. Then I poured them out and did the sauce separately.  The only change I made in the sauce recipe was to double the amount of brown sugar. 

The skillet was still really hot, so as soon as the sauce hit the pan it started to bubble and thicken. Then I put the chicken back in, stirred it around in the sauce and everything got thick and sticky.  Tasted wonderful. It had this nice sweet asian flavor with just a little spicy kick on the back of the tongue.  Everything was great. Then I started screwing up, lol!

Like many, I wanted more sauce. Great,  I'll  just follow the recipe and make another batch.... and another. What I didn't  think about was the fact that each time I doubled the recipe I also doubled the hot sauce. So by the time I finished the dish was very spicy. Really good but really spicy. 

So next time I'll double all the sauce ingredients EXCEPT the hot sauce. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious!

This recipe was delicious... and I'm not a big fan of spicy foods. I did not have fresh ginger or garlic on hand so I used powder (halved the amount) and only used 1 tbsp Sriracha hot sauce and I found it plenty spicy! I also took the advice of others and coated the chicken in flour before frying which kept the chicken super moist and helped thicken the sauce. I will definitely be making this again!

I coated in cornstarch before browning and had no problem with the sauce thickening.  I might increase the sauce next time.   My teenager, who is fairly tolerant of heat, thought it was a little too spicy.  I used two TBS of Tabasco.  Next time I might cut this to one, and maybe increase the sweet elements.

I double the recipes for my family of five and also tripled the sauce recipe. The kids thought it was to spicy so next time I will cut back on the hot sauce a bit. I thought it was wonderful as prepared.

It was too hot for my family (and even me except for my husband). I prefer something on the sweeter side. If I make it again, I will use half of the amount of hot sauce. I just wasn't big on the flavor.

Excellent combination of flavors.   I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted with Worcestershire.  I omitted the ginger as we are not fans of ginger.  I served it over rice with green beans. My husband and daughter liked it and approved it as a "rotation" meal.  As others mentioned,  be patient and let the chicken cook until it is "sticky".  I will certainly make this again and use soy sauce  to keep it as written.  Thanks!

Was  very good. and I will be making  it again. Though I did dredge in flour before cooking, but was still liquidy..so I added corn starch and water--and that helped!!!  Otherwise, everything else is perfect ?.  Thank you for sharing !!

Super duper yummy recipe! My end product wasn't exactly sticky, but that didn't matter. My boyfriend and I found that following this recipe and adding whatever veggies we had on hand made for a delish dish! My only recommendation is to think as you spice up your dish with hot sauce (we, of course, used Sriracha) bc it can be very...very spicy! You always have the option of adding hot sauce to your own plate at a later time, anyhow.

Sweet and savory, I used about half the amount of hot sauce called for --Chohula Chili & Lime hot sauce since it's what I had on hand--- turned out delicious, but not very spicy and not very sticky either. Sauce DID NOT thicken in the pan. This wasn't an issue for me as sauce absorbed well into the rice & stir-fried veg I made to go with. Husband raved about this recipe and I will definitely make again.

Well, this was dinner.  I coated the chicken in cornstarch to help thicken the sauce.  It did.  :)  Flavor was right there in the middle - not bad or good.  'Wasn't any of the adjectives in the title.  "Slightly Asian" may be a better name.   'Hope that wasn't being mean; not my intent.  Didn't wow anyone.

I made this last night for myself and my friends. After reading the reviews and that some people were saying that the sauce was not thick, and did not stick, i done this to my recipe.
I made up the sauce and added a little cornflour, and heated up the sauce seperately from the chicken in a saucepan on a low heat and continously striring until the sauce thickened slightly. I then dredged the chicken pieces in some flour and cooked for a minute on each side in a frying pan a few at a time and keeping them warm on a plate and covered with foil. After all the chicken had cooked i transfered the chicken back to the pan, and added the sauce, and then continued to heat through for around 8-10 mins, depending on how thick your peices are. The sauce coated the chicken and it was a nice consistency. Everyone enjoyed, and i most certainly will be making this again.....

This recipe is amazing! I dredged the chicken in flour as recommended by some others. Covered the chicken after I had flipped it with a sliced vidalia onion and a green pepper, poured in the sauce and kept the heat just high enough to simmer. I tossed everything together a few times for the 8-10 minutes. Served over white rice. Perfect balance of sweet and spicy! Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious!!! My husband and I both loved it and can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. I followed the recipe exactly except that I coated the chicken in flour before pan frying it, which did help thicken the sauce. I doubled the sauce since we put it over rice and it was perfect. Definitely recommend. Also, I used sriracha for the hot sauce and it had the perfect amount of heat.

Very yummy!
Only changes made were: toss chicken pieces in flour, and I used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce.

My boyfriend and I just decided to start using allrecipes.com and this was the first thing we made. Amazing dish. My boyfriend and I both are not a huge fan of spice so we tried it without the hot sauce and was still amazingly delicious. We chose to also bread the chicken pieces with a mixture of corn meal and garlic powder and then fried and then added the sauce. Will definitely make this again!

Made twice now.  Delicious!  I doubled the recipe - says serves 4 people but we ate 8 portions for 5 people!  Served over quinoa. Added fresh red pepper, an onion, and fresh broccoli.  I used approx. 1 Tbsp of cornstarch and water blend at the end to thicken it.  I would not recommend to add salt to the chicken - soy sauce has plenty already.  I omit the hot sauce - some just add it at the table, if they desire.

I made it using the suggestions like using flour on the chicken... and it came out delicious!! It was sweet, spicy, and sticky. It was a hit with my family. I also reduced the amount of hot sauce to a teaspoon and so the spiciness wasn't over powering but you could still taste it.

Amazing flavor...it was sweet, slightly spicy and sticky. My family devoured it and wanted more! I will be making it often for it is also simple. I added green and red peppers and mushrooms to go along with veggies and put it all on top of brown rice to serve.

Amazing!!!! My whole family just loved this dinner!! I doubled the sauce, sauteed 3 bell peppers, onion and garlic in olive oil and set it aside. Tossed the chicken with flour, salt and pepper, sauteed it in the same pan I used for the veggies on high heat and scraped the pan as i went along, I then added the sauce, cooked it for a few minutes scrapping all the yummy pieces off the bottom of the pan, added the veggies and cooked till sauce was thickened. Served it over brown rice and devoured it!!!

This is DELICIOUS!! I combined a few tips people gave -
1) I reduced the sauce on a separate pan on medium heat for about ten minutes while I was cooking the chicken , giving it time to thicken before combining everything.
2) I cubed the chicken, sprinkled on salt and pepper, and rolled them in flour. 
3) I seared the chicken on medium high heat in vegetable oil until it was brown and crispy on the outside but not fully cooked, just a couple minutes.
4) I put the chicken on a plate and covered it while I chopped broccoli and carrots, put some salt and pepper on them and put them in the same hot pan to crisp the outsides.
5) Then I combined everything and let it simmer until the sauce was thick and the chicken fully cooked, 5-7 minutes.
It tastes amazing but if you're sensitive to spice maybe cut the hot sauce to a tablespoon, it was pretty intensely spicy (used siracha).

Absolutely amazing! I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still s little too salty to my taste so next time I won't add any salt to the chicken while sautéing it. Otherwise, it's a great recipe!

I made this with pork chops instead. The sauce didn't thicken but it was delicious just the same. Will definitely be adding to my menu.

This was definitely sweet, spicy and sticky! Followed the recipe but doubled all the sauce ingredients-  I did dredge the chicken in flour before browning. I thought it was too spicy. We will make again with half the hot sauce.

Very good!  I substituted the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce because that's what we had.  I also cut the hot sauce in half for our children.  I diced the chicken into bite size pieces and lightly covered in a flour, salt, pepper, and lemon pepper mixture before browning.

Excellent flavour and the family loved it.   The only change I made was to reduce the hot sauce to 1 Tbsp, using  Sirracha sauce which gave it a nice kick. Garnished with sliced green onions and cashews to give it colour & crunch.  This is a keeper

So, my moniker, "kitchen challenged " is not an exaggeration, in that while making this meal I set off the fire alarm, which prompted 2 Chicago fire trucks to come screaming through the city to my aid.   Although the fire trucks were not needed (I'm so embarrassed), I will most DEFINITELY be making this dish again, and risking another visit from the fire department ... It was that delicious!  Thank you to chef Kate Martin for this wonderful recipe , and to the rest of you with your hints (adding flour and veggies)... I will do my very best not to set off the alarm next time!

Great recipe and easy to customize. I have to lighten up on the hot sauce because my kids and hubby can't do super spicy. Great balance of flavors and super easy to put together. I didn't give this 5 stars because I think the cooking method is a little vague and thigh meat is much more appropriate here for the high powered cooking necessary to reduce down the glaze. I have marinated sliced chicken thighs in the sauce and put it all in the pan on high heat till everything is cooked through and the chicken is sticky.

Loved this! If you are going to use cornstarch and a liquid for thickening,try using OJ instead of water.It adds another level of flavor.It doesn't sound like it would make much of a difference,but it really does.

I substituted hoisin sauce for the hot sauce since I can't eat that, and gave my husband some crushed red pepper flakes to sprinkle on his food so he was happy with it.  I added some chopped scallions to the sauce. Before cooking, I dredged the chicken in corn starch.  The sauce was very thick and I had to add a little water during simmering.  It came out great.  Next time I would prefer low sodium soy sauce in this recipe, and I would double the sauce and add broccoli or other vegetables.  Hubby loved it.  Tasted like Chinese take out.

Very tasty! My DH and I thought it tasted just like PF Chang's. For the most part we make this as is, though we do dredge the chicken in cornstarch or flour and fry the chicken before adding the sauce. This helps give the chicken that "Chinese takeout" crunch and helps thicken the sauce. And like in the editor's note, we add onion and broccoli. Delish!

This was delish! My 7 yr old even ate it the next day for breakfast! Definitely sauté the chicken in flour to help to thicken and brown.  I also doubled the sauce recipe for extra sauce as I served my dish over rice. Rave review from across the board with my kids and husband. Which are all hard to please with one meal.

The hubby went crazy over it and said the sauce was sensational. Doubled the sauce and went easy on the Sriracha as others mentioned (about 3+ tablespoons) and may go easy on the honey next time as I found it a little sweet. Added a cornstarch slurry while boiling (about a quarter cup of water, and 1 tbsp of cornstarch) and that worked beautifully to thicken the sauce and make it stick. Just remember to stir it like crazy until it thickens! Served with snow peas and brown rice.

Its really a delicious recipe.
I used chicken thighs instead.
I preboiled the sauce mixture
until half the mixture, and a little sticky before I added the chicken
I mixed flour in the chicken mixture before frying them.
I loved it. Im sure I'll cook this over  and over again. Next time with broccoli.

As per other reviewers , I coat the chicken in flour /garlic powder / pepper before frying it in a cast iron pan.  I heat the sauce separately on the stove and mix them together at the end letting it get a little stickier. I also usually double the batch.

I just made this tonight and it turned out spicy!  I did double the sauce recipe and used Tapitio for the hot sauce and served over rice.  I think the flavors were really good but next time I will cut back on the hot sauce, maybe by up to half. I enjoy spicy but this was a little too much for me...

Really tasty, super easy!  I added about 2tbsp of frozen orange juice concentrate to give it a little citrus flavor and reduced the hot sauce a bit.  Served over rice noodles with stir-fry veg, it was delicious and the family loved it.

Very good tasting. Used buffalo sauce and added a dash of tobasco for a kick. Using real raw honey is a just. No issues with the consistency of the sauce. I used more chicken than the recipe calls for and everything worked out flawlessly.

It turned out better than I thought. I think directions should have the meat be cut into strips. My season was a lot spicer than I thought but I'm not complaining. Smells delicious! Overall, this dish was easy to make and follow!

Followed the instructions but also dredged the chicken in flour to get a crunchy texture.  We will be making this a staple at our house.

Spicy but not sticky or sweet. Grilled the chicken and cooked the sauce separately. Was good with mushrooms and zuchinni mixed in.

Really good! Taste like chinese restaurant!Used 1T siriracha and it was perfect to my taste,though it is too hot for little kids.Could be made without any hot sauce.Served with steamed broccoli and rice and it was perfect.Maybe reduce the amount of soy little bit next time.This is in my recipe book now.KEEPER!

Delicious with a few minor tweaks.  I increased the amount of sauce, used dried ginger and decreased the amount of hot sauce.  Would also be good with sauteed onions and green peppers.  Also added flour to thicken up the sauce.

My husband and I both really enjoy this one.  It's easy to make and delicious!  I like to dredge the chicken in seasoned flour first and add green onion at the end.   I usually serve it with jasmine rice and veggies.  Thanks for a great recipe that will stay in rotation for sure.

If someone gave this to me and said it was from a restaurant, I would 100% believe them!
I did as many other have, and coated the chicken in a little flour before tossing in the pan.

Amazing flavour and so easy to make.  The sauce was perfect and had no problem reducing, just simmered for 10 mins over the chicken.  The only changes I made were to add chunks of onion when cooking the chicken, and used ketchup and chilli powder because I had no hot sauce. We loved it - i'll be making it again and again, thank you Kate!

This was a hit! I used Sriracha for the hot sauce, and it was a little too spicy. Next time I'll back down the heat and I'm sure it'll be perfect.

This was a great recipe. I followed the advice of others and let the sauce reduce down without the chicken. I also doubled the sauce so there would be enough to cover the rice.

Sauce it self if really tasty but sauce is really runny if you follow this recipe. And chicken will be over cooked. I will make some change when i cook next time. 1. SEAR CHICKEN with flour. 2. ADD STARCH into sauce mixture and bring to boil before use. 3. Add VEGGIES like broccoli and carrots.

This recipe was super easy and fast. The only thing I will change next time is to use less soy sauce - as it didn't really thicken. However, it was delicious over white rice!

Rave reviews!  14 yr old went from not hungry to having 3rds!  That's a success in my book.  I use a little less hot sauce because of preference of the house and I took the advice of others reviewers and coated the chicken pieces in corn starch and sauteed in batches.  I poured the sauce in the pan and added some snap peas for a few minutes and then added the chicken back in for a couple more minutes and this was plenty of cooking time for the chicken and peas.  Will definitely be making this again very soon!

I loved this recipe! I used one teaspoon ground (dried) ginger and only one tablespoon sriracha and there was great flavor and warmth. I will definitely be making this again when I'm feeling like some yummy and fast Asian food. Thanks:)

I loved this recipe.  Was I didnt have any hot sause, just two to go packets of Tabasco sause. It was just a little to hot for me.  I also added 1/2 cup of water to pan after putting in the sause.  I also dipped the chicken in flour as reccomended.

Try adding a table spoon or two of corn starch to the chicken before browning. Helps thicken the sauce!

Same issue with sauce not thickening correctly but I will figure it out eventually. I have played with it even adding a little home made Jalapeno Jelly once. We love garlic and spicey so for us we add more kick our favorite hot sauce for it is Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce and extra crushed garlic but again excellent! This is my favorite with lots of veggie or with rice and asparagus. I use organic brown sugar and local honey. Enjoy!!

Love this dish! I added strips of yellow pepper when I added the sauce and a minute before the end, some spring onions to add some crunch. 
Cooked beautifully on highest setting on induction hob. Needed the extra power boost to stir fry it quickly. 
A real kick to the sauce but superbly sticky and sweet at the same time. Thoroughly recommend.

DElicious!! Very easy and quick to put together. You can do the dicing and combining of sauce early, then it all goes together in under 15 minutes! Very spicy!

My favorite Asian recipe to make! It tastes just like take-out, but healthier. My boyfriend said "YOU made THIS?!" -> He thought I had ordered it from down the street. :] I used sesame oil in place of vegetable oil, and Sriracha as the hot sauce. Served it mixed with white rice and sauteed onion/green pepper. Pairs very well with the Chinese Chicken Fried Rice II recipe (minus the chicken).

I added green beans and baby carols to give it more color, also marinated the chicken in the sauce for a couple of hours to make sure the flavor is soaked in. Great flavors!

This was SOOOO good!  I did follow the advice of some others and dredge the chicken, which I had cut into small chunks and marinated for several hours in a combination of soy sauce, olive oil, fresh garlic, and a little brown sugar.  I also sauteed some coarsely chopped onion, sliced mushrooms, and pieces of asparagus, removed them from the pan and browned the chicken, then added the veggies back in before adding the sauce.  Oh, and I didn't have hot sauce, so I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce.  Served over jasmine rice.  It was as described - sweet, sticky, and spicy.  Will definitely enjoy this again.

This is just delicious, except I put 2 tablespoons of sirracha hot sauce in it and it was so spicy that neither my husband or I could eat it, and we like spicy. This time I'm going to add only 1 teaspoon of sirracha in it. Oh, and I lightly floured the chicken first.  It's a great recipe which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. A minor adjustment takes care of the problem. Thanks...

My family is hard to please and we LOVED this recipe! I used the amount specified but used ground ginger and garlic granuals and split the hot sauce between 1 Tbs of Sriracha and 1 Tbs of Valentina. We have found our new chicken recipe!

Amazing, even my finicky 5 yr old ate it.  Added fried vegs to with chicken and sauce - onion, cabbage, yellow pepper.  Cooked sauce while cutting and flouring chicken.  Did not add spicy (small children) but did add sesame oil which hit the spot. On white rice - Delicious!

Made tonight finally. I had attempted a few nights ago, but the dog ate all of the raw chicken when I left the room for a minute!! I had simmered the sauce for about 8-10 minutes as others had suggested. Tonight, however, I just went straight to cooking the chicken and poured the previously simmered sauce on it. I left everything else the same. This was just ok, and will not likely make again. I have other chicken recipes (like the Kung Pao recipe from this site) that we like better. We did add some peanuts to our individual servings after it was cooked as it seemed like it needed something. Broccoli would have probably been good mixed in too. Also, the smell was a bit overwhelming, but the taste was better than the smell.

The sauce didn't thicken, but the flavor was great, and after making it, I can see how easy it would be to customize it, or even use this sauce in other dishes, like stirfry veggies. Really quite tasty.

This was the best chicken recipe EVER ! I Even messed up a lot making it and it was so good that I ate it right out of the pan! Whoever said Sairacha sauce to be included was  right! Awesome sauce! I'll be eating this along time! I Made it with fried rice but you really don't need to and I added the sautéed vegetables. Too good! Thanks!

The recipe was delicious! I usually make recipes "as is" before making any changes, but based on other reviews, I wanted to make sure my meal was "STICKY" so I thinly sliced the chicken in long strips and then coated them in CORN STARCH (3-4 tbs) by tossing them in a bowl. I just think corn starch is a better thickening agent than flour. Also, for a meal like this I think SRIRACHA (rooster sauce) is the only way to go! However, a little goes a long way and I added too much, so I ended up doubling the sauce with low sodium soy sauce, but I'm glad I did!!! I don't think the original amount would be enough to coat chicken/leave enough to coat whatever you're serving it on top of/with. I served over rice with some broccoli and it was DELICIOUS! We will be eating this again, and again, and again.

Followed this recipe,except that I used sriracha  hot sauce + added some red pepper flakes,cause I love how it neutralizes the sweetness of the sauce. Also, I lightly used a flour/ cornstarch dust on my chicken,which was seasoned with a rub (spicy chicken recipe from allrecipes). Made stir fried vegs(almost anything you already have) + steamed rice= everyone  LOVED it! Definitely a  keeper...p.s.  I work in the food industry+ was a baker for 20 yrs....it's a hit!

Amazing and easy! Took suggestions and coated chicken breasts in flour; heated the oil very hot. I also prepared and heated the sauce in a separate small pot while browning the chicken with my only substitute being powdered ginger. My chicken breasts were thicker so next time I'll start the sauce once I turn the chicken. Once I poured the sauce over the chicken, it bubbled and thickened right up. I did turn the heat down as to not burn the sauce and chicken. I had to turn my chicken a few times since they were thick. Not dry at all, some of the most moist chicken I've ever made on the stove! Preparing the rest of the chicken for a freezer meal!

Love it! Did as others suggested and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking. Next time, I think I'll double the sauce and add some steamed cabbage strips to the last few minutes. Served with rice and peas.

4 stars b/c it wasn't sticky. Yet it was tasty and would attempt it again only I would maybe cook out the liquid of the honey, brown sugar and soy sauce FIRST, till it started thickening then add chicken.   And I would also try dredging the chicken in flour, as a previous reviewer mentioned.

This recipe was very good. The only thing I did differently was narrowed it down to one tablespoon of hot sauce because it came out a little too spicy for me. Other than that I loved it! Very easy to make as well.

My husband gave this a 10/10 for me it was a wee bit spicy but that might be due to the extra hot hot sauce. I had read other comments saying they struggled to get the sauce sticky so I addendum about a table spoon of cornflour to the sauce.  Turned out perfectly sticky.

Great! But make sure you cut chicken into bite size pieces AND cover in flour. I did my chicken pieces in a zip lock bag with flour. Shake n toss the bag! 
I'm making this again!

This is a huge hit with us. We lessen the amount of hot sauce because I'm a spicy wimp, but there remains enough heat that my husband, the spicy king, is happy.

It was a hit! I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to help with thickening. Also I'm a sauce girl so I doubled the measurements for that. Also I added bell pepper for color

The sauce itself is delicious! I doubled or tripled it. I also cut my chicken into medium sized cubes, dipped it into batter and Fried it. Served it over rice with lots of sauce and some green onions.

Yum! I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper, then coated cubed chicken (I didn't cut mine into strips). Then cut up an onion, sauteed it in the oil, and added the chicken. I added freshly cut strips of carrots, chopped broccoli, and a stripped red bell pepper. I added half a can of pineapple juice and chopped pineapple, and the sauce it calls for,  then let everything simmer. Next time I'll add mushrooms and cashews.

Had I not made some minor changes to this recipe it would have been far to spicy and I don't think the sauce would have thickened as nicely as it did. Overall this was a great base recipe and my chicken came out fantastic. 2 tbsp. of hot sauce is FAR too much. I'm not sure if it was because I was using Hot "Pepper" Sauce, but thank god I added the honey before the hot sauce because I ended up tilting the bowl to the sink and letting pretty much all of the hot sauce roll off the honey and into the sink because it was just too much hot sauce. I would recommend no more than half a tbsp. if you like it more on the spicy side and add some red pepper flakes while cooking it, which is what I did. I also dredged the chicken lightly in flour beforehand and while it was cooking with the sauce, I cut the chicken into bite sized chunks. The final result was a nice balance of spicy and sweet, and the perfect consistency teriyaki sauce. It was slightly sticky and thick enough to stay coated on the chicken but not so thick that it clumped into a thick gel. I was very pleased with this recipe overall and would recommend using the sauce while cooking some stir fry veggies on the side.

This was an awesome recepie. I modified it a little based on what I had. I didn't use ginger root, I used teriyaki instead of soy, and I used saracha as the hot sauce as others had suggested. I also sauteed onions and green pepper in garlic before cooking the chicken in it. I had no problem with the sauce thickening, but I also doubled the ammount of sauce so there was a little to put on the rice as well.

Based on previous reviews, I made the sauce on the side first.  It thickened up just fine for me.  Then, I cooked the chicken and added the sauce to it.  I used chicken thighs, because I didn't have any breasts, and they were juicy and delicious.  The level of heat was perfect for me.  The first bite was awesome, but by the time I got to the end of the dish, I think the soy sauce flavor was just too strong for me.  The next time I make this, I will probably cut back on the soy sauce, like maybe half as much.  Then, I'll taste it and determine whether to add more sugar or honey.  I didn't get much of a sweet flavor, just a lot of heat and soy.  Perhaps cutting back on the soy will bring out more of the sweet and I won't have to add any.  We'll see.  This recipe is a great start, though!!

I loved it!!  Boyfriend wants a little milder version and asked me to try it next time with some onion, broccoli and maybe shredded carrots. I will try that for him!  For me it was perfect with amazing flavor. Served it over brown rice. Also followed the suggestion to flour the chicken, cooked and removed and added sauce to the same pan and brought it up to full simmer. Then added chicken back in to coat and turned to low while cooking the rice. It was thick and perfectly sticky. Quick and easy!

Very good! I didn't have enough soy sauce so I used terriaki sauce as a sub, also I have really light weight kids so I used half the amount of hot sauce-- and took others advice and dredged the chicken in flour, as well as cooked down the sauce while I browned the chicken. It was a hit!!

I really like this recipe. I took advise from previous comments and made some adjustments also. I dredged the chicken in flour for that golden crispness and doubled the recipe for the sauce adding a little more honey about 1/4 cup and only the 1/4cup hot sauce. Came out perfect! The first time i made this i followed the recipe exactly and too spicy for me. Second time with minor adjustments and even my husband loved it. He took some to work and shared now everyone wants some. Will make again and again thanks :)

This is excellent and my whole family loved it.  I took the advice of others and cut my chicken into bite sized pieces, placed them in a ziplock bag, and then coated them with flour, salt, and pepper.  Seared on med-high heat with grapeseed oil before adding the sauce.  It worked really well and we loved the flavor.  Served over brown rice.

I dredged the chicken in flour, like many reviewers suggested.  Sticky, yes, but sweet and spicy was a maybe. As the recipe stands, the salt from the soy sauce was overwhelming. I might make it again, but I will halve the soy sauce.

Loved the flavors but I doubled the sauce recipe and there still wasn't enough sauce for 4 people! If you want sauce on your rice I would triple or even quadruple the sauce recipe. Great recipe!

I used corn starch to thicken the sauce, and heated it in a sauce pan.  It was too soy-flavoured for us, so I added 1 tbsp of orange juice and 1 tbsp of peanut butter to give it more depth of flavour.  I dredged the chicken in corn starch too, and it was a delicious meal!  My gluten-free version was hit.

This recipe is amazing! The flavor is so tasty and savory. I made the reciepe as is except I did use a little flour on the chicken for searing. Also toward the end after the sauce simmered a bit I added some chopped onions and broccoli. It tastes like something out of a restaurant! Thank you for this wonderful reciepe! It will be in the rotation for my family.

This was really delicious!!  I did cut the soy in half, used a squirt of sirracha for the heat, and floured the chicken pieces before browning, but otherwise prepared the recipe as written.  I feel that if I had used all the soy called for, it would have been much too salty for my tastes.  I also used reduced sodium soy.  The whole family loved it.  Thank you for sharing.  I will be making this again!!

I thought this tasted SO GOOD for how fast I was able to make it. I also dredged the chicken in flour before searing it. I serve with mushrooms and broccoli. I steam the broccoli first, and toss that in with sliced mushrooms at the end of my cooked chicken/sauce, and mix it all together.

Really easy and had good flavor. I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour before browning on med high. The flour definitely helped the sauce thicken and get stickier. I will make again with double the sauce!

The whole family liked it - even a picky 11 year old.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I added flour and cooked the chicken first then set it aside while cooking the sauce so I could control both a little more.  I doubled the sauce so there would be enough for drizzling on rice.  I used regular ginger powder which was fine.  It was sweet, spicy and sticky.  Next time will add some chunky veggies.

This was really good. I floured the chicken before browning it and used a few dashes of cayenne in place of hot sauce, but followed everything else exactly. I would up the sauce a little bit next time, but only to account for the broccoli I threw in when the chicken was almost done cooking. I had NO problem with the sauce not thickening up (almost immediately) but I had the heat on medium-high when I put the sauce in. I actually had to add some water because it was thickening up too quickly. This will definitely make my regular dinner rotation.

Mine turned out perfectly, and it was delicious! I also cut the chicken into chunks and rolled them in flour before frying. Made this dish into a meal with white rice and Crispy Edamame recipe on this site.

Wow, so good! Next time I will try adding flour to thicken up the sauce. I don't care if it's "sticky" but I would like it to be less runny.

Very good flavor! I dunked the chicken in egg and flour and  cooked the chicken in oil. I mixed the sauce ingredients and cooked it on the stove top while I fried the chicken. I removed the chicken from the oil and poured the sauce over it and added chopped green onions. The whole family lived it.

This was a hit! My son is a picky eater but he absolutely loved thia recipe. I did not dredge the chicken in flour...i doubled the sauce and used 1tsp of cornstarch instead. Substitute fresh garlic for Goya powdered garlic (no difference)! This one is a keeper! :)

This recipe needs a little work. I think it would have greatly benefited from some fresh flavor and maybe an acid to overcome the soy flavor. Next time I might add cilantro or a touch of rice wine vinegar. I breaded the chicken like others suggested, but crowded the pan because I am impatient and hate to do things in batches. I do think it would have been better with a crispier exterior on the chicken. Overall, a very simple recipe with ingredients I almost always have on hand. Very versatile, I added broccoli, sliced garlic, and water chestnuts.

I simply loved this recipe!!!! Thanks for sharing!  I too, made a couple adjustments. I dredged my chicken in seasoned flour (w/ground black pepper and a little salt). While browning the chicken, in a different pan, I sauteed thinly sliced sweet onion, freshly chopped asparagus & thinly sliced red & yellow bell peppers. I added the sauteed veggies to the chicken, then added the sauce which was made same as recipe called for (except I didn't have fresh ginger, so used ground ginger) and this was a hit in this household!  The only other adjustment was I decreased the amount of hot sauce, but added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  This is one of my favorites now! Thanks again for sharing!

This recipe is awesome. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs meat instead of chicken breast meat and lightly dredged with flour and pan fried.  My daughter loved it and she is one of the pickiest eaters ever.  Quick simple and tastes great.  This is a winner.

This recipe is awesome provided you follow the video.  The written recipe omits the flour sprinkled on the chicken. Flour is needed to make the sauce cling to the chicken.  With flour the finished product is restaurant quality.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change that I made was dredging the chicken in flour as recommended by other reviewers.  The recipe had the perfect amount of spiciness for me (using my handy-dandy sriracha).  I did find that the flavor of the ginger overpowered the garlic though.  Next time I will slightly decrease the ginger and increase the garlic.  

Very quick and easy recipe with a deliciously sticky result.  Will definitely make again.

This was great. I ended up using about two T chopped garlic and ginger.. I also used two T brown sugar and  4 T soy sauce. Nice and spicy.  Like others I lightly floured chicken wit  S & P . Whil it cooked because it started to stick I added 2 T butter to help me loosen it. I heated the sauce separately while chicken cooked and then added it when chicken was browned, turned it to low and put a lid on it while I waited for rice to finish cooking. We will be making again.

This was really good.  I followed top comments and dredged in flour, I can't imagine this recipe without doing it.  To the sauce I also added 2T of ketchup and about 1/4c of orange juice.  I stir-fried about 2 1/2c of broccoli, water chestnuts, and diced carrots, after cooking the chicken and setting it aside.  Once the vegetables were done I added the chicken and the sauce on high.  The sauce thickens quickly.  I don not think a double of the sauce is necessary unless you like a ton of sauce.  My wife who doesn't like much spice liked it.  My 5 year old complained about the heat a little but I put ranch on hers and it went down.  I used Sriracha.  In the future I will mix the sauce without the Sriracha, set a small amount aside for her meal, and then continue with the recipe.

This is such a great recipe if you need new ideas for your family.  I always toss my chicken in cornstarch before browning because it really tenderizes it. I would definitely recommend sauteing the chicken in batches as not to overcrowd the pan and accidentally steam instead of brown. The sauce flavor is great and I always serve this with cocunut rice. A keeper! Thank you Kate.

Awesome recipe. Definitely toss chicken in flour before browning. I also did not have fresh garlic or ginger in mine, just shook a little of the powder in there from the spice rack. I taste tested the sauce on plain rice to get the flavor and heat I wanted before putting on the chicken. A word of caution though, mine was VERY SALTY. Will use low sodium soy sauce next time. Used 2 chicken breasts and added some broccoli and garnished with toasted sesame seeds. Served over rice. YUM!

I enjoyed this recipe, but I modified it in a few ways so that it would appeal to me.  I added agave nectar to sweeten the sauce, dredged the chicken in seasoned flour, and added cashews and scallions at the end.

Great combination of flavors! Like several reviewers suggested, I coated the chicken first (mixture of flour and corn starch). Since I prefer something other than just meat/poultry, I added a little onion and some bamboo shoots. And for my personal taste, I cut back the hot sauce a little, tasting as I seasoned. I would note that I used half the chicken, but the full ingredients for the sauce - and there was none too much of the yummy sauce. If you're using the full 4 chicken breasts I'd recommend doubling the sauce ingredients.

I really like this recipe. The problem I read alot about was the sauce not sticking to the chicken, so I went ahead and added a tablespoon of flour and it worked great!!! My whole family really enjoyed this recipe, quick and easy for a busy school night! I also used siracha for the host sauce, the first time I used regular soy sauce and it seem to salty, the second time I used the lower sodium soy sauce and it worked out great!

I would give it a 5-star, but I had to alter the recipe some. Review from "Rebecca" was most helpful. 

---Sweet...yes. Spicy...yes. Sticky...no Very good flavor but I had the same problem other reviewers mentioned about the sauce not thickening up. I will make it again with the following changes: 1. Dredging the chicken strips in flour before sauteing, which will help them brown better and help thicken the sauce. 2. Saute on med.-high heat instead of medium. The heat called for in the recipe is not enough to sear the chicken. 3. Simmer the sauce while I am preparing the chicken, then add to the chicken as called for. Because, it took much longer than 8-10 minutes to reduce the sauce, and the chicken dried out. I should add my husband loved this recipe. The flavors are good. Thanks.--- 

Just be careful to not burn the sauce when simmering (cook on medium to medium-low).

I followed others advise about dredging the chicken in flour first.  This adds a crunchy coating to the chicken - excellent!  Also doubled the sauce and added a bag of stir fry veggies and chunk pineapple to round out the meal.  The sauce wasn't real thick, but it worked out fine with the veggies. Instead of using regular rice we made a quick stir fry rice.  Makes a quick wonderful meal.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe with a gluten free version, meaning I used Tamari sauce instead of Soy.  To me it really is sticky, sweet and spicy.  The sauce stuck to the chicken and the plate...and the fork.  :-)  The second time I made it I dredged the chicken in GF all purpose flour and tossed in some sesame seeds.  It made it a bit crispy and I added some sesame seeds.  That second time took a bit more oil though.  A keeper definitely.  Thanks.  Will make this again.

I thought it was fine. I did shake the cut-up raw chicken pieces in a mixture of flour, salt, and pepper before cooking them. Maybe because my chicken breasts (though boneless skinless) were so huge, I should have doubled the sauce. I also found the sauce to need more salt. I *did* use low sodium soy sauce, but I pretty much always use this type of soy sauce, and don't usually notice recipes to need salt even when I use this soy sauce for the called-for regular soy sauce. I might try this again, but will check reviews to make some changes. I stir-fried some broccoli with it, so at least it will make a nice meal for the next few days!

Very easy, fast and delicious. The whole family enjoyed it. I used chicken thighs and dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper before frying.  I doubled the sauce and cooked it for 10 min on med heat. Served over rice. Next time will try over egg noodles. Will do it again, and again, and again...

Loved this recipe but I did tweek it although this recipe can totally stand on it's own without any changes.  I do try to lower salt in all of my cooking so I didn't salt the chicken before cooking.  As with traditional chinese cooking I did dredge the chicken in CORN STARCH not flour. It thickens better than flour.  Also used a low sodium soy sauce.  I do like a little more sauce so in addition to the 1/4 cup soy sauce I added another 1/4 cup of water, no additional seasoning.  The result was great... Lots of flavor and the additional water didn't weaken the flavor at all.  Corn startch thickened the dish nicely.  Note:  For gluten free people use corn starch and tamari or amino's in place of the soy sauce.  I doubt you would notice any difference in flavor.  Great recipe and everyone raved about it!  Thanks!

I am giving this 5 stars for simplicity and great taste! The only change I made was coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. I only added a dash of hot sauce ( two changes I guess) as my son doesn't handle spice. Served with white rice and sautéed green beans. This is a keeper!

The sauce was over the top DELICIOUS, however the directions need to be changed a bit. First off, you really don't need to cook chicken strips for 8 to 10 minutes. No one should cook chicken strips for more than 1.5 minutes per side, period, DONE. My chicken came out so overcooked I alsmost thought it was inedible. That sauce however saved it, there was enough in the pan to dip the chicken in. I'm going to try marinating the chicken in the sauce for at least an hour before cooking. The sauce never got thick either, maybe a little cornstarch would help, or reducing the sauce BEFORE you add the chicken. Either way the sauce was the star of that dish. I made a second double batch to use in the future.

This is so very good. I used chicken tenderloin strips and I used 2 teaspoons of powdered ginger because I never have ginger root on hand and also used low sodium soy sauce (just a personal preference regular soy sauce is way too salty for our taste). For the hot sauce I took other reviewers suggestions and used sriracha hot chili sauce (found it in the international isle at grocery store) I doubled the sauce and used a little extra honey and brown sugar (maybe an additional half tablespoon of each) and used a little extra sriracha sauce. I added a little salt and pepper to the chicken then tossed the chicken strips in flour before pan frying and they had a nice golden brown crust on them before pouring in the sauce I removed the chicken and poured out the oil from the pan, put the chicken back into pan and  poured in the sauce and then added a tablespoon of corn starch mixed with a little water and the sauce thickened up and finished cooking the chicken. I think next time I make this I may cut back on the amount of corn starch the sauce got very thick. I made Goya Mexican rice chicken flavor and added some peas and corn to it and put the chicken on top of the rice and we had a very good satisfying dinner. You wont be disappointed with this dinner, the chicken is juicy and very flavorful thank you for sharing and thanks to all the helpful reviews !

I like a lot of sauce so I doubled it like a few people recommended. I microplaned the ginger since I don't like biting small chunks of ginger. I should of tasted the sauce before I grated the 4 teaspoons ginger. It over powered the sauce. Note to self, use a lot less ginger if you microplane it. Other than flouring the chicken and adding less hot sauce and adding red pepper flakes, no salt (low sodium still has a lot of salt) this dish was great, even with the strong ginger taste. My son and husband ate it up even though they are wimps when it comes to spicy foods. Will make again with less ginger.

I will give it 5 stars with these changes.  Add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the flour, and double the amount of the sauce.  The cornstarch will thicken the sauce a little, and when served over rice, the extra sauce is good.

Loved this easy chicken recipe! I followed others advise and floured the chicken before cooking. My sauce turned out great and the chicken had a nice glazed stickiness. I would definitely make this again, but will have to back off on the saracha hot sauce this time for my kiddos.

We really enjoyed this!  I used five chicken breasts, so I increased the sauce ingredients by 50%.  No problem.  I also chopped up some baby carrots, green onions, zucchini and added snow peas. I added those to the pan after I had removed the chicken (two batches) and allowed them to stir fry in the chicken juices that were left in the pan.  Then when the veggies were nearly finished, I added the chicken and sauce to the pan. I stirred in about one tsp of cornstarch, brought the sauce to a boil, then reduced the heat to medium. It thickened just a little bit, which is what I wanted so the sauce would be thin enough to pour over the rice. Next time I will chop up the garlic and ginger more finely.  We served it with rice.  Great recipe!  Just the right amount of spicy and sweet!  Thank you, Kate! :^)

Never use powdered ginger in an Asian inspired recipe! Always us fresh ginger! Try adding 1-2 teaspoons of cornstarch to the sauce mixture at the end just to tighten up the sauce and make it glossy and thick. Bon Appetit!!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I doubled it but didn't have enough soy sauce, so I used part water. It was still pretty salty. I might try low sodium next time. I also used flour on the chicken before cooking. Overall it was pretty simple and tasty. Thanks :)

I don't typically like "sweet" chicken dishes like this, but this was delicious. DEFINITELY use sriracha hot sauce and coat the chicken in flour first. Sauce was just the right consistency. I sauteed an onion before the chicken, set aside the onion, cooked the chicken in the sauce, then threw the onion and some par-cooked fresh broccoli in. Great dish!

Family loved this.  Floured chicken pieces first and used sesame oil in pan instead.  Sautéed a pepper, scallions after chicken.  Added sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds at end.  This will become a regular dish for us.

Delicious! The sauce did not turn sticky like pictured, but was a wonderful marinade and was great with rice! I used less hot sauce since I didn't want it that spicy and would use powdered garlic and ginger next time to avoid pieces floating around

I make this recipe multiple times a month but I sear some jalapeños first and then add the chicken with a light flour coating so the sauce thickens more.  This is one of my favorite recipes ever.  It's easy, quick and even better the second day!

With my husband working 12-hour shifts, I make two meals for him to bring in with him to reheat. I am not the greatest cook and he is rather picky, especially with chicken dishes. That said, he really enjoyed this dish and now I make it for him often! I follow the recipe exactly, other than using ground ginger rather than fresh. So glad I found this recipe!

Loved this recipe and am planning to add it to our list of favorites. My skillet was super hot before I added the sauce and didn't have a problem with it thickening up. My 18 month old typically eats everything but this was just a little too spicy for her. So next time, I'm only going to use 1 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce. But she ate the rice and vegetables and was fine. Can't wait to serve this again!

This recipe is amazing! It always turns out good! I do dredge my chicken in flour, and yes I start the sauce at the same time as the chicken so it gets to simmer for a little while. It really gets thick once its added to the chicken!

Easy recipe that doesn't disappoint!

Delicious!  I doubled the sugar & honey and halved the hot sauce.  Left the soya sauce as listed.  I made it early in the day, poured the sauce over the chicken and put it on a low heat in the oven so that the Flavors would have time to mix.

Great reciepie. There was only two of us so I did half the chicken, but used the same amount of sauce. I did 1/2 the hotsauce, added about a teaspoon of garlic powder, and used ground ginger. Turned out perfect. 

I seasoned and cooked the chicken first, in my favorite cast iron, after seasoning it for 5 minutes with onions and garlic. Took the chicken out, added veggies. 

After a couple minutes, I coated the veggies in the sauce. A few minutes later, I mixed in the chicken. I turned the heat off and just let the sauce and chicken mix together. 

Turned out amazing! healthy too after adding so many veggies.

My family loved this recipe!  After reading some of the other reviews, I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the soy sauce mixture before cooking it, and it was perfect.  I doubled all of the ingredients,  but I cut the hot sauce in half because my son doesn't like the heat.  I also added 3 green onions to the chicken cut in 1 inch pieces for my own spin.  We will make this again!

This was delicious. I sautéed an onion, mushrooms and red pepper until soft and set aside. I then seared the chicken which I had dredged in seasoned flour. Once the chicken was brown I added everything into the pot. Cooked for about 15 minutes until chicken was cooked through. The sauce reduced nicely and coated everything with its sweet/spicy (from the sriracha) taste. The whole family loved it.

I followed everyone's advice and dredged the chicken in flour.  I sauteed onion in the wok, added shredded carrot, snow peas and mushrooms.  Since I have a vegetarian stepdaughter I added the sauce to the veggies and set them aside.  With a little more oil to the wok I fried the chicken until nicely browned then returned 3/4 of the veggies back into the wok.  The other 1/4 was for my stepdaughter's vegetarian dinner.  I added more garlic and ginger than called for in the sauce.  I'll make this again.

This was ahit last night! I did change this recipe a lot, I didn't use anything spicy or hot and added all the ingredients to taste and doubled the sauce. I also added PINEAPPLES! It was sooooo good! Even though I pretty much did my own thing with this your recipe wad the basis for it. I don't think u can go wrong with this combination of ingredients, period! Lol. I did lightly flour the chicken before using olive oil to brown it and when I added the sauce I did added a few sprinkles of flour to help it thicken. It turned out perfectly, wish I had made more. This will definitely b a favorite in my house. I served it over brown rice mixed with sauteed green peppers and onions:)

I tried my luck with this recipe  tonight. I did what everyone suggested and coated the chicken with flour. I don't think it would have been as good if I didn't. I got a frozen bag of stir fry veggies and added fresh jalepeno. I wanted my sauce a little thicker so I added a little more flour. Quick, delicious, and cheaper than ordering take out. Thanks for the recipe and thanks everyone who added to it.!

Delicious! I browned the chicken and added a bit of flour (about 4 tea spoons) to the oil and chicken mix, then put the chicken on a separate plate and added it back to the sauce after it thickened.

Review update - I make this recipe at least a few times a month.  It is a fast weeknight recipe that I know I can have on the table in under 45 minutes.  Originally I used to dredge the chicken in flour, but I don't bother with that anymore.  You can if you want that nice crust on your chicken.  I use cast iron, so I don't have to worry about not getting a nice crust!  This recipe was seriously awesome!!!  I followed the recipe almost to a T, except the ginger.  I only had dried/powdered ginger.  So I used just a tsp of that. Figuring that the dried would be much stronger than fresh.  I dredged the chicken in flour, salt, and pepper and pan fried in the oil.  I also added 1 diced red bell pepper (sautéed).  Hot sauce I used was sirracha (red rooster). Even the leftovers were awesome! Will definitely make this again!!!

This is super good and easy!  I definitely suggest doubling the sauce, using at least one clove of minced fresh garlic and adding 1 TBSP cornstarch to the sauce mix.  You could also add chopped onions, bell peppers , water chestnuts, or ?  I will be making this again and again!

Add slightly more brown sugar and only 1 tbs hot sauce for a less spicy taste if you're like me and can't do anything too spicy!

Great recipe.  I tweaked it a bit for our own tastes by adding a bit of sesame oil, siraccha, green bell peppers and a little seasoned rice vinegar.  I also drudged the chicken in flour.  It was fantastic!

This was awsesome after some tweeks. Cut down on the sugar 1 tbsp then added sweet Chili sauce. Really made it sweet and spicy. Will be making this again.

Yummy!  I dredged the chicken in flour as others suggested then baked it rather than frying it and it was a hit with the whole family.

Excellent! I doubled the brown sugar and the honey in the sauce recipe. I added 2 tbs. of hoison sauce too. Separately i made a slurry of cornstarch and water and added it to the pan after the chicken finished simmering. This thickened the sauce right up. Turn off heat and let sit few minutes before serving. I only sauteed the chicken with just salt and pepper and it came out just perfect. Thick sauce.  This tastes closest too general gao's chicken

This was an amazing recipe. It's requested by my family all the time! For the hot sauce we used Tuong Ot Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, otherwise known as "Rooster Sauce" or " Sauce." It was perfect.

Made as instructed with one minor exception. My rice was not going to be done before this dish so I lightly covered with foil. I think the flavors had more time to develop this way.  Next time will reduce the hot sauce as this recipe is as states: SPICEY! Flavor is great without any flour.

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious!! I followed the advice to dredge the chicken in flour. I used chicken tenderloins so they would cook faster. I added fresh green beans and red, yellow and orange sweet peppers when I added the sauce to the already cooked chicken. The veggies stayed crispy and the sauce thickened up no problem during the 8 minute recommended cooking time. I love this site because I love to read the reviews and the tweeks to the recipes. I agree with all the reviews that this is a keeper. All of my kiddos loved it and agreed it tasted like something from a restaurant. We will definitely be making this easy, wonderful dish again!!!

I couldn't wait to try this and was so happy I did.  Although it was too spicy for my daughter, my husband and I really liked it.  I did some changes based on the reviews...I cut tenders in half, put salt, pepper and garlic powder on chicken then dredged in flour. I used Frank's Original hot sauce and it was spicy (I added 2 tea because I doubled sauce). I doubled the sauce although I don't think I needed to and won't next time.  I sauted some green beans (1/2lb) and sesame seeds and placed in bowl then I sauted the chicken. I took out the chicken and added to the green beans and had white rice as side.  This was so good will be making this again!

Next time I make this, I will add more honey, brown sugar, and hot sauce, in order to balance the saltiness of the dish.  I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  We topped with chopped green onion.

Great!! So much flavor. I took advice from others and dipped in flour first however I'm not sure it was necessary since the sauce thickened right up for me. I followed the directions otherwise and it is yummy! We will have it again! I served it with Sweet and Spicy Green Beans from another recipe on here and wow it was a great meal!!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I did dredge the chicken in flour before browning it, which probably helped thicken the sauce a little.  I also use Sriracha for the hot sauce.  It was pretty spicy and not that sweet, so next time I'd increase the brown sugar to 2 Tbsp and decrease the hot sauce to 1 1/2 Tbsp.  But I will make it again with those changes!

This recipe is VERY good, it was slightly too spicy for my taste. I cut up chicken legs instead of using the breasts. My hubby loved it, though! Next time I will definitely use chicken breasts and will probably cut out some of the hot sauce.

I love this recipe! I cannot eat the ginger or the spicy, so I take it out and it still tastes amazing! To make it sticky just put the cooked chicken in a pan, add the brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic and hot sauce over it, and put it in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I do that with my sweet and sour chic\ken and it works well.

Made this exactly as is.  Was very disappointed.  I think it was going as an Asian inspired dish but the flavors lacked and felt confused.  I read the comments but seemed like to many changes to be the same dish.  We ate it for dinner but no one wanted to eat the leftovers.  Will not be making this again.

Delicious!  It tasted like a spicier version of General Tso's Chicken.  I followed the users' suggestions and coated the chicken with flour. I did not have fresh ginger so I halved the ginger and used dry, powdered ginger. The recipe did not make much food, only two whole chicken breasts worth of chicken. (There was, however, a little sauce left over.) The next time, I will double the chicken and ingredients.  I will also make steamed broccoli to go along with it. It's a keeper.

It was wonderful! The only thing I did different was, I added a few La choy rice noodles as a garnish and the crunch of the noodles broke up the softness of the rice and chicken. (:

This was an excellent recipe: easy and quick to make with just the right amount of sweet and heat. I added two green peppers and two red peppers to it for a garden fresh dinner.

This recipe was off the hook!  I was pretty liberal with the sugar and honey because we like the sweetness, and also reduced the soy sauce just a touch as some other readers had suggested that it had been a little heavy .... my only wish is that there had been a little bit MORE sauce at the end when we plated because it was SOOOO tasty!   Next time I'll make a bit more sauce to add to the finished plates.   This is going into the "family favourite" file ... and easy to cook, to boot!   Thanks so much!

This is great recipe, but I kinda use my trick for the sauce. I simmered the sauce into the separated pot, so all the flavor from the ingredients get together. then to make sauce ticker, i used corn starch. Corn starch definitely makes sauce ticker it tastes much better :)

Absolutely delicious. Very quick and easy to make, which is a bonus!  Have made it twice, and my family loved it both times.  Will definitely make this again many times.

This recipe is awesome. I used Siracha hot chili sauce like I read in one of the other reviews. I copied everything on this recipe except I have learned using this recipe works with almost any kind of meat. I used shrimp and chicken a few weeks ago and my family absolutely loved it. I'm making it again tonight at the Grandparents house.

Really yummy. Loved the combination of flavors. I agree with other reviewers- double the recipe for the sauce and add a bit of thickener, either cornstarch or flour diluted in water. I added some stir fry veggies and served it with white and brown rice. So good! This one is a keeper!

My chicken was tender and juicy because I decided to bake 3 (large/thick) boneless breasts in a 11X7 baking dish with minced garlic and sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper. I covered it loosely with foil and baked it at 375 degrees for about 35-40 minutes (keeping the juices to add to the brown rice I had in the fridge). I let them set for about 10 minutes on a cutting board before cutting them in 1/4-1/2" strips and shredding the strips with my fingers into bite-size pieces.

I didn't change the sauce much, but I did double the recipe. I used low-sodium soy sauce, Frank's Thick Hot Sauce and then added a tsp. of the Chili Garlic Sauce with the rooster on the bottle. I also added about 1/4 cup of orange juice.

I cut a red pepper into slices and added some broccoli florets and I threw them into a large hot skillet that I had sprinkled sesame seed oil in (almost enough to cover the bottom). I tossed the veggies around the hot skillet for about 4 minutes or so til the broccoli florets were bright green. Then I added the chicken strips and the sauce and let it get bubbly hot. I then mixed about a tbsp. of cornstarch with a 1/3 cup of orange juice, stirred it until smooth and added it to the pan, stirring til the sauce thickened. Wow! Yummy!
I added the juices from the chicken to the brown rice in the same baking dish and warmed it in the oven while I was making the sauce etc., and it was really delicious when we added the chicken & veggie combo over the top of it.

This dish was GREAT!  I've been trying similar recipes and this is by far the BEST!  I followed the recipe as-is except for 2 things which were recommended by other reviewers.  I dredged the chicken in flour first, and used Sriacha for the hot sauce and it was amazing!  I didn't have the problem of the sauce not thickening quickly enough, so not sure why others experienced this problem. My husband and I both loved it and as we say "this one goes in the rotation"! Thanks for a great recipe!

It wasn't sticky (after letting it simmer upwards of 13 minutes), it wasn't particularly spicy.  Not bad, just not very impressive.

It was sweet and hot and probably would have been sticky but I did not allow all the juice to condense.  I used two tablespoons of hot chili paste and must admit was slightly too hot.  I added another half a tablespoon of brown sugar and all was OK.  It had a good flavour and I had added broccoli and capsicum.  Receiving the email today with the recipe advertised was a God-send as I had a visitor for dinner and was pleased to have something so easy to put together.

very very good-I did take other suggestions and dusted the chicken with corn starch instead of flour-it gives it a crispy yet not breaded crust.Thanks for sharing

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I had to add a.little flour to thicken up the sauce, but that is no big deal. I think it is perfect as is, but if you have young children, you may want to reduce the hot sauce to only one Tbsp.

Love this recipe! Have made it a couple of times and love how quick it is. I use Sriracha as the hot sauce. The only thing I do different is I cook the sauce separate to get it to thicken while the chicken is browning. Once the chicken browns, I add the already thickened sauce to the chicken and it gets nice and sticky without over cooking the chicken. Works wonderfully!

We liked this quite a bit, but I think the ingredients/directions need to clarify what is meant by "hot sauce".  I interpreted it to mean something like Tabasco, but knowing how hot Tabasco is, I reduced the measurement to only 1 Tbs.  This was still almost too spicy and we were very happy I had served this with egg drop soup and white rice, which helped to dowse the fire.  I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of dry ground ginger instead.  We'll definitely have this again, but I'll cut the Tabasco sauce back to only half a tablespoon in the future.

The basic concept behind this recipe is spot on, but as other reviewers noted, it requires some modification. The chicken needs to be lightly coated in flour. The sauce should be partially reduced in a separate sauce pan. Once the breaded chicken is nicely browned and cooked through toss in the sauce which will thicken and turn sticky almost immediately because of the flour coating on the chicken. The sauce was incredible as is, but I may try to add some orange zest to it next time.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. Wow. I made it for friends on Friday night. No leftovers whatsoever. Made it again on Saturday night for dinner leftovers for the week. It's now Monday and I have 1 serving left. Made a few changes after reading some reviews. Dredging the bite-size chicken pieces in flour before cooking them really adds to the dish. It almost helps the sauce stick to the chicken more. I sauteed a diced onion until soft then removed and set aside. Then cooked the chicken and removed and set aside, then added the sauce to the pan to cook for a few minutes before adding the chicken and onions back in the pan with the sauce. It helped the sauce thicken and avoided the chicken to be overcooked. I also doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the sriracha sauce (3 tbsp is great - 4 tbsp is a little too much heat). At the very end, I added some fresh uncooked broccoli to the pan when I added the chicken back in. Allows the broccoli to cook some, but stay crunchy. Favorite recipe on this site by far!!

Like many reviewers, I added vegetables to the mix and there was still plenty of sauce.  I also floured my chicken before cooking.  I was getting tired of waiting for the sauce to thicken, so I added a tiny bit of cornstarch/water mixture and it was instant perfection.  I would recommend low sodium soy sauce as it was quite salty, but I expected that.

This was awesome!  I doubled the sauce (except for the Srirachi hot sauce-used only 3T.) and dredged the chicken in flour before browning it.  Added a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables and skipped the rice. Love, love, love!

Simply Excellent.  I added the cornstarch as well... but the sauce is fantastic.  This can be added to any cooked, cubed chicken for a QUICK meal that my family loves.  Serve with lo mien noodles and it is a HIT!

This was a tasty recipe and easy to tweak according to personal taste.  I did flour my chicken first, which seemed to help with the thickening of the sauce.

Recipe as written would have been too salty, as others mentioned you need to cut down on the soy sauce.  I also used 1 teaspoon ginger and it was plenty.  Overall this recipe has a good base of ingredients you can tweak.  I used sesame seed oil in place of veggie oil for more asian flavor.  I also left out the hot sauce to make it more kid friendly.  For even more kid appeal I added a little peanut butter.  I placed my chicken in the crock pot and let it simmer in the sauce for a few hours, the chicken absorbed the flavors really well.  I served it over noodles with cabbage and broccoli, the family loved it. You can probably also add some orange juice to give it a citrusy flavor.

Delicious! I didn't use as much hot sauce so my kids would eat it & they loved it! Used ground ginger because I didn't have fresh, but would taste better with fresh. Followed other reviewers and dredged in flour first. Cooked chicken in Le Creuset braiser so pan got nice and hot, which helped sealed in flavor and brown chicken nicely. The sauce did get nice and sticky because I used a good pan. My kids are going to call it "Sticky Chicken" from now on.

This was really good. I didn't have trouble with the sauce at all as some other reviewers did. I did cut the chicken in cubes instead of strips and dredged them in flour before searing. Next time I might double the sauce since it disappeared so fast!

Swapped out the vodka with regular cooking wine, and used chicken cutlets instead of whole breasts and seasoned with extra rosemary and poultry seasoning. . .the personal touches make it fantastic!

This was a good recipe but I think the soy sauce should be cut down by half. Also I added 1/2 cup water and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit. Turned out well but just a little too salty.

My husband and I loved it! We had to adjust the portions for hot sauce because of the type we used. This is great served with chow mien too!

I really appreciate the wonderful feedback from all the reviewers.  I will definitely hold back on the hot sauces since we don't like too hot.  And will definitely coat the chicken before cooking it.  My only question is, do I use flour or corn starch?  Will there be a taste difference?  Thanks tor all the great tips.  I can't wait to make this!

So good. Made this last night for dinner and the bf loved it. I did coat the chicken in corn starch before browning so that helped a lot with the thickening of the sauce. Will definitely be making this again. Love Love Love.

After reading that some people said the sauce took too long to thicken and the chicken dried out, I got scared and doubled the amount of sauce. This was a mistake, as there ended up being an excess of sauce (even when I bumped up the number of chicken breasts to 6). Next time, I'd stick to the recipe's instructions for the amount of sauce to use, but also coat the chicken in flour, per other reviewer's recommendation. 

I really liked this recipe for the first couple bites (especially the kick from the hot sauce), but then I started to get salt overload. 

Next time:
- I would still coat the chicken in flour (I used whole wheat flour to coat the chicken and don't think it made a difference in taste compared to using regular, all-purpose flour).
- I'd try using low sodium salt and keeping the 1/4 cup, or halving the soy sauce and adding water. But it was way too salty as written.
- I'd add in half an onion (sliced lengthwise), and 2-3 bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces 

This recipe still gets 4 stars because I can tell it's a great base recipe. I'm sure after tweaking it a little, it'll be even better!

I like to add green onions at the end. Also, I never measure the Ginger and garlic but it's always good. This is my go-to recipe when I want a quick Asian-esque dish.

My husband absolutely LOVED this. It was a bit too spicy for my daughter and me...but that can be easily modified.  Like many suggested, I dredged this in flour first and they came out great!  I also sprinkled some sesame seeds at the end of cooking time.  Definitely will make again.

I have made this recipe several times.  I love it and the best thing is so does my family.  We love Asian style cuisine and this hits the spot every time.  I top it with green onions and cashews.  For those that are complaining about the taste, most recipes are versatile and you can add or subtract spices as desired.  I added more hot sauce because I like it hotter, it's a simple fix.  Thanks for the addition to my menu.

This was wonderful. I followed other reviewers and coated the chicken in flour before frying it. I also added some sauteed onions and red bell peppers. It was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I did add a splash of mirin at the very end to round out the flavors. Really delicious and quick. Next time I might try using 1 tbsp honey and 1 tbsp maple syrup, just for a twist.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe! I followed what other reviewers did and put flour on the chicken... I also used the Srirachi hot chili sauce which was amazing. I don't think that I could imagine this recipe with hot sauce as stated, but whatever floats your boat. I will definitely be making this again... Thank you for the recipe!

I don't think it was sweet enough and think there was too much soy sauce.  Next time, I'll add more brown sugar and less soy, and turn the chicken down for a few minutes before adding the sauce (it only took a minute or two to reduce vs. 10 minutes per recipe).

I'm sorry but I don't understand the high ratings. The sauce was thin and salty, not "sticky" or "sweet" like the title of the recipe claims. I will not make this recipe again.

I made this for my fiancee the other night with very minimal modifications - I used maple syrup instead of honey and omitted the ginger. everything else was followed according to the recipe and he LOVED it! I served with the House Fried Rice recipe from this site and it was a huge hit. Thanks!!

I made this using sliced boneless chicken thighs. I cooked them until they got a nice crispy crust on them and then added the sauce. I used 1 tbl of sriracha and I thought it was just right, my husband thought it was too spicy. The chicken stayed crispy and sticky (I didn't add any flour). I served over brown rice and sir fried carrots. So quick, easy and delicious.

Easy enough for a child to make. It seems I did some of the same things others have done to improve upon an already good recipe. I tripled the sauce ingredients except for the soy sauce and added even a little more brown sugar. I also dredged the chicken ( which I got the butcher to cut up into bite size pieces for me; I always look for the easy way to do things) in cornstarch instead of flour. Instead of mincing the ginger and the garlic I grated the one and put the other through the garlic press to add more flavor. At the end of cooking I added some steamed broccoli and served it over sticky sushi rice. It was a sticky, delicious, quasi-Asian meal.

Super delicious! Doubled the sauce ingredients but left the hot sauce at 2 tbs.  Threw a little cornstarch slurry in to help thicken and also threw a bag of frozen stir fry veggies I steamed at the end. Flavor of the sauce is wonderful.

We decided this one is a definite keeper!  Lightly dredged the chicken pieces in peppered flour, then browned.  When almost brown, added a thinly sliced, small onion and cooked until softened, then poured in sauce.  Probably used a little less soy and a little more honey (didn't measure) and 1/2t powdered ginger; it thickened beautifully.  Actually had to finish cooking with the lid on or the sauce would have burned down.  It was SPICY, but I guess the hot sauce you use will determine the heat factor.  We ate with a 'flavored' rice vs. just plain, as the sauce IS sticky and wouldn't have been enough to flavor/sauce rice on its own.

I made this as my main dish with white rice and tempura vegetables. It tasted amazing! I used 'House of Tsang: Szechuan spicy stir fry sauce' instead of hot sauce though which i think really made a difference in the flavor. This is an all around good dish.

My sauce didn't thicken either but I didn't mind. I doubled the sauce and added steamed sliced carrots and steamed broccoli. I cooked 1 cup of rice and mixed in. It was awesome. Oh and I used chili oil instead of hot sauce.

My family loves this and it is very easy and quick to prepare. It's better to dredge the chicken in flour before cooking for a crunchier coating. Also, do not double the sauce. I tried this because I wanted a little extra sauce for my rice, but it turned out way too salty.

 How is it Kate's fault YOU forgot to triple the sauce? The recipe deserves 5 stars on it's merit, not because you forgot to add something. I and my family loved it and will be making again.

liked the flavor of the sauce- but the method was lacking- not sticky.  i think the sauce would be a great marinade.  my family enjoyed, but it wasn't what i expected.

I love spicy food, but this one was just a bit too intense.  The flavor was good otherwise, so next time I'll try cutting back on the spice.  Based on some reviews I dredged the chicken in flour before throwing them in the pan; I'm wondering if this is why the sauce came out a bit too sticky - almost a bit clumpy.  Will try without flour next time.

We really enjoyed this recipe!! I followed ingredients exactly but cooked at a higher heat... Got sticky almost right away... Very tasty, and requests for more from both my 9yr old son and hubby.  Will definitely make this again!

This was a bit of a disappointment.  it was very salty and not sticky at all.  I also used some very spicy hot sauce which made it hurt my lips!  It did seem similar to what you might get at the Chinese takeaway and it was nice to have made it at home, probably in a more healthy way.  I won't be making it again but was glad to try it.

This was excellent-- I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the the hot sauce in half so that the kids would eat it without complaining.  Not only was this delicious, it was so simple to make!  Can't get better than that.

This was an awesome recipe.  I did dreadge the chicken in flour and I doubled the sauce and used hirachi sauce in place of hotsauce.  That wouldn't have had the right flavor.  Thank you and I will make this again and again and again

The spiciness of this recipe must depend on what kind of hot sauce you're using.  I used Tabasco Pepper Sauce and since I'd read reviews that this came out too spicy, I started using only 1/4th the called-for hot sauce.  It was DE-LICIOUS!  The family loved it.  Great with Margaritas.  I steamed sugar snap peas and tossed them with the chicken and sauce and made white rice to serve over.  I also doubled the sauce.  I can't rave enough about this dish.  JUST ADD THE HOT SAUCE A LITTLE AT A TIME TO SUITE YOUR TASTE!

This was just Meh...for my family.  I basically followed the recipe with the exclusion of the fresh ginger root.  DIdn't have frest so I used the ground kind you find in the spice section.  My husband liked it the most.  I think Orange Juice would have added to this recipe, but didn't think about adding until it was already plated and we were sitting down to eat.  Probably will not try again, but I apprecaite it being submitted.  It's really great trying new recipes!  Everyone's taste is different to what isn't great to me might be fabulous to you!

Delcious! I floured the chicken, as suggested by others. I also doubled the sauce and blanched broccoli, which I added at the very end. I served it over brown rice.  I can't wait to make this again! Thanks so much!

This dish was decent but nothing earth-shattering. I mostly followed the recipe but used dried ground ginger and garlic powder instead of fresh. I also subbed in some red pepper flakes for the hot sauce. The sauce was nice, though I added some cornstarch for thickening purposes. Served with brown rice (great for soaking up sauce) and steam-fresh green beans. Interestingly, I found this recipe was better the day-after when it had been reheated. It's a quick meal for a weekday night if you're looking for something decent but not impressive. I may or may not make it again.

This was fabulous!  I dredged chicken tenders in flour and pan seared in olive oil, only for crispiness on the outside, not to cook entirely.  Then I placed the tenders in my crock pot.  Mixed all sauce ingredients in glass bowl, subbing in ground ginger and 1 shake of crushed red pepper for the fresh ginger and hot sauce, and poured over tenders.  I cooked on low all day while I was at work.  When I returned home the aroma was to die for!!  I served over rice with steamed broccoli.  The chicken tender, the sauce thick enough.  Oh!  Simply delicious.  I did not double sauce and didn't think I needed to.

we loved it.  I did the flour thing too. My family said it was like eating General Tao's chicken without the breading.  I used Rooster sauce.  One pan and fast thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I added a green bell pepper and sliced onion and doubled the sauce, adding a tad more chicken. I also used thighs instead of breast as they are more juicy and tender, dredging them in flour before browning. It was yummy over rice! I really enjoyed the prep and cooking. It was a fun meal to make, great for a cooking together date night. Will be making this again! =D

This is the easiest and quickest meal to fix.  The sauce is delicious.  However...the only complaint I got was that it was too hot, so next time I'll use less hot sauce.  Loved it though.

Wish I could give this 10 stars! OMGosh this is good!  I did increase the sauce 3x, as I wanted more for the rice. And as per some of the other reviews..I mixed 1/2c flour and 1/2c cornstarch and dredged the chicken in that first, before frying. (I like the crispy chicken and wanted more of a glaze on the chicken) I did have to add some more oil and batch cooked the chicken, as it wouldn't all fit in one pan. To make it go a little further, I added about a cup of cashews, a cup of mushrooms, and a cup of sliced onion (after the chicken was done frying, I threw these last 3 ingredients in until the onion was tender) then added the sauce. Great recipe when made just as written and even after adding some texture to it. Thanks Kate!

I really liked this recipe.. I did actually cook the sauce seperate, shallow fry the chicken till golden brown and finished off in the oven.. I then poured the sauce over and I thought it was really good... The sauce shoudl be doubled. I also added Crushed Red Pepper, and 2 tsp cayenne pepper... I think it was great.

Very tasty! Kids absolutely loved it. Next time I will double the sauce to have extra to drizzle over the rice. I also added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and cooked it in a sauce pan before I added it to the chicken. The kids are fighting over who gets the leftovers for tomorrow!

Yummy dish - easy to make! I dusted my chicken in cornstarch first before browning. I also didnt have any brown sugar on hand, so threw in some chunk pineapple while it was thickening. Turned out delicious, thick and tasty!

Made this for the first time this week, and the whole family enjoyed it.  I doubled the sauce since I was adding broccoli - and it tends to soak up sauce.  I did not double the ginger or the hot sauce - I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids, but followed the recipe for everything else.  Next time I will probably toss the chicken in some corn starch before cooking, as the sauce never thickened.  Otherwise, this is a good recipe.  We will make this one again!

This is my husband's new favorite recipe. What I changed: Added jalepeno peppers and tripled the sauce. We like the sauce to drench the rice.

This is like takeout without the drive!  I added extra honey because my kids like things sweet; the sauce thickened up in about 15 minutes.  Next time I would cut the chicken strips larger because the chicken does dry out easily.

Oh my goodness!  SO YUMMY!  I read other reviews before making the recipe and took the advice of those who shook the chicken in flour before cooking.  I also cooked the chicken and then removed it from the pan before adding the sauce.  I also added 1 vidalia onion and one red pepper, both sliced and sauted separately from the chicken and then sauce.  I doubled the sauce recipe except for only 1TBLS of hot sauce.  I also used ground ginger in place of the fresh (none on hand).  Will definitely make this one again and again!

I have to agree with one of the other reviewers- it wasn't sweet, it wasn't sticky.  It was overwhelmed by a really strong, salty soy sauce flavor.  Easy to put together, but I would recommend cutting the amount of soy sauce (which I measured out exactly with a measuring cup when I made this) and perhaps trying to add more of the brown sugar for some more sweet.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.  No need to get take out with this one.  The sauce tastes great.  I used the suggestions of the other reviewers and removed my chicken from the pan while reducing the sauce.  I also added a little corn starch to the sauce to assist in thickening.  This is going to be a regular. Thanks so much!

I doubled the sauce as reviews suggested and added carrot chips (already sliced and bagged), snow peas and sauteed mushrooms (my personal choice) for color and fiber. I also used 3/4 tablespoon sriracha instead of 2 tablespoons (figured I could always add more) and a bit of water with cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Delicious!

Flavor was awesome...unfortunately a bit too hot for me even tho I used only half the hot sauce called for.  Will change some things to compensate for not using hot sauce. I only used 2 chicken breasts and the sauce thickened so well there wasn't enough..I like sauce...will make some modifications next time.

Makes a very good and quick meal. I reduced the chicken to two large breasts, and added two chopped red peppers and one coarsely chopped onion. I took others advice and tossed the chicken in flour before browning.

Used only 1/2 of the hot sauce (Sricha) as I was worried that it may be too spicy for my kids.  It turned out really good.

Delicious, quick and easy. I did need to thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slury, but otherwise, very tasty. Will definitely make again.

Yummy Yummy Yummy!  I added stir fry vegetable to the chicken and doubled the sauce, I also added a thick water flour roux to the sauce and it thickened up nice. This is definitely going into the rotation!

This recipe was delicious!! My parents said it was 'PF Changs worthy'. I doubled the sauce ingredients, we like a lot of sauce soaked up in our rice.
There is a LOT of sodium in this recipe, I used 3/4 balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 soy sauce. Balsamic vinegar is a great healthy alternative to soy sauce, which is packed with sodium. It still tasted great, I think it made it tangier.
Enjoy!

Delicious! I could eat this whole batch of sauce with a spoon! I added a quick saute of carrots, green onions and snow peas. Will make again!

This recipe was delicious! I made a few minor alterations, I dont like garlic so I skipped that, and I threw in a few other spices I almost always use. As far as the sauce thickening - I cooked the chicken as directed, added the sauce, then removed the chicken and added a little bit of flour to the remaining sauce, it thickened very well, and I then poured the remaining sauce over the chicken, served with rice and vegetables. 

*If adding flour, careful not to add very much, a little bit goes a long way, and make sure to stir constantly

I don't normally write reviews but I felt it necessary for this spectacular recipe! I used a small bag of chicken tenderloins and it was VERY easy to cook. The sauce exceeded my expectations! WINNER!

It was an easy recipe. For me, it took a little longer to make because my "slight OCD" and maybe the pan i used, but it still came out nice. Instead of using regular soy sauce, i used low sodium soy sauce and it was still delicious.

Great recipe.  I loved the taste.  Followed some of the reviewers tips:  used ground ginger,  the hot sauce I used is Sriracha (ultimate favorite), coated the chicken with flour and reduced the amount of soy sauce.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because it gives the chicken a better consistency.  I am going to email my best friend and tell her to check this recipe out!

I loved this and so did my husband!  I am not the most proficient cook, but this was easy to follow.  I didn't change anything.  The only thing that was off was that it wasn't sticky, but the flavor was so good that the sticky didn't matter to us.  (I used tabasco sauce for the hot sauce).  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is the bomb - the only thing I change as I double the recipe for our family of 5 is to use 3 Tbsp. of hot sauce as we love the kick - but our youngest doesn't like it that hot - trust me, at that it still has kick. I also ad a package of frozen Asian blend vegetables which make it a great meal w/out having to have a wok. TY for the recipe - my family LOVES it!

This dish is amazing and has had my whole family asking for thirds!!!! I decided after baking it in the oven to put the chicken and the marinade in a large skillet to thicken up the sauce and fully cook the chicken while consistently flipping to bast. I also triple the marinade recipe so there is plenty to drizzle over finished chicken and sticky rice. then top with chopped green onions....... Definitely one of my favorite recipes!!!!

Made as dictected per sauce.  Fried up chicken wings added sauce and WOW! Little sweet, but followed by heat.  Loved it! Fried our wings and simmered in the sauce, best recipe.

I didn't like it. Apart from the soya, I couldn't taste anything else. I added 1 green bell pepper and 2 carrots. It was easy, but I don't think I'll make it again.

This recipe turned out really well.  I'm a novice cooker and hadn't used ginger root before and it gave the chicken such a unique kick.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This was really great!  All 4 kids and hubby loved this!  The sauce was exactly what I was looking for.  I doubled the sauce and used 6 skinless highs cubed and dredged in cornstarch (with the salt and pepper) and fried in a little oil.  I then set the chicken aside to drain on paper towel.  The only other things I did different was that I used Sirachi instead or plain hot sauce, and I used about a tbsp of corn starch, mixed with a little water, to thicken the sauce before I added the chicken.

4 star as is, but DEINITELY 5 star with few changes from other suggestions.  (1) Dredge chicken cut into bite-size pieces in flour to aid with crispy outside and thickening sauce. (2) We like hot food. Other suggested Sriracha garlic chili sauce and I totally agree HOWEVER, it is hotter than the avg hot sauce so start with 2 tsp - 1 Tbsp and add more if you like but don't start with 2 Tbsp in recipe until you try it first.  If you're wondering where to buy Sriracha, I can get it in my Asian section at Walmart superstore or Ingles here in NC or of course an Asian market. (3) I added veggies - onion, tricolor peppers, baby corn, minced jicama, carrot and broccoli because I like my veggies. (4) I doubled the sauce to accommodate the extra veggie ingredients. (5) I like others suggested, brought the sauce ingredience to a slow boil in a seperate pan so not to dry out my chicken and let in cook down a bit before adding to the seared chicken and it thickened up nicely.

This was delicious! I added cornstarch to the sauce mixture which made it nice and thick. I also added crushed red pepper flakes to make it extra spicy. I dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper and pre-cooked it until really golden before adding the sauce. Turned out great. Was a crowd pleaser at my house!

As other reviewers have stated, this may be sweet and spicy, but it is not sticky.  It is very delicious and I didn't really miss the sticky part!  The sauce will not thicken up as stated in recipe.  However, it is still very yummy served over rice and steamed broccoli.  The only change I made was instead of using fresh ginger, I used ground ginger I already had in the spice cabinet.  If making it again, I may double the sauce part. I felt there really wasn't enough.  But I like extra saucy stuff to mix over all the rice.

This recipe was great just like it was directed to make.  I didn't change anything.  Its only fair to the person that submitted it.  My husband and son really liked this recipe.  I added to my faves and will make this again.  I served it with rice.  Next time I will stir fry some veggies for on the side.  Thanks for the recipe.

The rating should be 3 and a half stars but I rounded up.  I mixed all of the ingredients for the sauce and put it into a seperate pot to pre-cook.  I followed other people's directions and flowered the chicken and (also following someone else's review) I put the chicken into a pan with only Pam sprayed on the surface of the pan.  It started to stick a lot so I sprayed more, which didn't help so I added a little over a tablespoon of canola oil and that helped the chicken not stick.  After putting the sauce into the pan, it thickened up quite well.  It ended up a bit too thick but it was fine.  Next time, I will use oil instead of Pam, which was not in the directions of the recipe but in the comments.  On a bright side, my husband liked it!

Yum!  Tastes like a restaurant dish!  I doubled the sauce and reduced it a bit, since we like more sauce to pour over the rice I made with it.  Be sure and use Sriracha hot sauce, as another person suggested.  I will make this often!

I took advice from others and tossed the chicken in flour before browning.  After the chicken was brown on the outside, I added the sauce to the pan.  I used ground ginger.  I would definitely make this again, but I would probably reduce the garlic and hot sauce a little.  Thank you.

definitely not sweet, spicy or sticky. just salty. yuck. i followed the recipe, other than dredging the chicken in flour, but it didn't thicken until I added some cornstarch to the sauce. its a good base recipe but i think it needs more flavoring than just soy sauce, I couldn't really taste anything else. I served it with rice and it just looked and tasted very unappetizing. Won't be making it again.

Definitely toss chicken in flour before cooking.  2tsp. ground ginger worked just fine.  We used Marie Sharps hot sauce from Belize & 2 Tbsp. was too much!

fantastic!!! just like in restaurants!  i julienned my chicken, then dredged my chicken and "seared" it on HIGH for 1-2 mins.  be sure to let the chicken dry/set after you dredge it.  
thank you for the recipe!

Awesome. Dredged in flour first but added sauce after browning for a few minutes.

too hot--use less Siracha; like the idea of dredging
chicken in flour before cooking

Well, I have to say that this is pretty good. I didn't actually start my dinner making this recipe. I was making a sweet and sour chicken recipe from this site until I tasted the sauce and decided that wasn't as great as I expected, so here I am. I did this exactly as written, except for omitting the ginger (because I wasn't expecting to make this recipe). It turned out pretty good considering the chicken was already fried with the sweet and sour chicken coating. My only problem was that it is really spicy, and the sauce didn't thicken, so it wasn't sticky. All in all, it is pretty good. Thanks!

Great recipe.  The kids loved it.  I took the advice of previous reviews and dredged the chicken in flour (with salt and pepper) and the sauce turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper in our house.

This is great!   The second time around, I halved the hot sauce (I used Sriracha), but that was just personal preference and no fault of the recipe.  While it thickened up perfectly the first time, the juice from the chicken breasts and a little too much peanut oil left it pretty thin the second.  I spooned out a bit of the sauce and mixed in some cornstarch before adding it back to the pan and it turned out perfectly!  Thanks for sharing!

A different twist on chicken.  Very tasty, very easy.  Do add flour when browning the chicken.  I didn't bother dredging; I just sprinkled some in with the cooking chicken.  I also set aside a bit of the sauce and cooked up some fake chicken for my vegetarian.  Again, really easy and yummy.  I already have requests to make it again.  A keeper.

I made this using pork and in a noodle stir-fry-- it came out delicious! I dipped the pork strips in flour before sautéing and sautéed some onions, peppers, broccoli, and snow peas to mix into the dish. Used Sriracha for the hot sauce and double the hot sauce; let the sauce simmer while I cooked the veggies and pork. I mixed the sauce in with the noodles, pork, and veggies and let it simmer together for a few mins. before serving. Very easy & delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Just made this last night and it was spectacular. I didn't have ginger root available so I used 1 tbs of minced orange peel. For the chicken, I coated it in a flour and spice mix called kickin' chicken. I reduced the sauce in a separate pan, then added the seared chicken. Also, I lightly buttered some green beans and broccoli florets and steamed them so they remained slightly crunchy. White rice was the base, with the chicken and sauce atop the rice and the vegetables atop that. Delicious!

Liked this a lot - just a tad hot for our tastebuds. I'll probably add a bit more honey & Br. sugar next time---its that sweet tooth of mine! I saute'd some broccoli and a pepper to add a few more veggies - served over brown rice.

This recipe came out great!  After reading other reviews, I also coated the chicken strips in flour and sautéed on high until they were lightly browned on both sides.  I simmered the sauce in a separate pan while the chicken was browning.  Once browned, I poured the sauce over the chicken and simmered it for another 10 minutes.  This came out very sticky!

Im giving this recipie 3 stars as written. But with a couple of small changes, it is easily a 5 star recipie. The first time I made it, I followed the directions pretty much exactly. And it was okay. The sauce did not thicken even after cooking for 20+ minutes.   So the second time, I dredged the chicken in flour, as suggested. I also doubled the sauce, because I had a lot of chicken and some veggies (peppers and onions) to cook in it. But did not double the hot sauce. I used 3 tablespoons. My husband and I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this. It was a little too spicy for the kids though. So maybe next time I will used 2 tablespoons of hot sauce. Also I used powdered Ginger, only because I was out of fresh, and it turns out just fine that way too.   All in all, this is a tasty and easy recipie. Definately worth trying. And tweaking for your own tastes. And some veggies and steamed rice and you have a great meal!

Yum - just like eating at a Chinese restaurant.  BF and I made this last night.  We used 1/3c lite soy sauce, 3 tsp fresh ginger, 3 TBS hot sauce and doubled everything else in the sauce.  The sauce didn't thicken too much but it didn't bother us.  Fresh ginger is a must!  Served over steamed veggies and ginger rice.  Can't wait to make this for company!

Amazing taste.  I was about to make this dish for dinner and my husband said "no just relax and I'll cook dinner tonight".  I handed over the laptop with the recipe pulled up and OMG this was a wonderful dish and not only because my husband offered to cook dinner.  He changed it up slightly by adding some teriyaki and 2 tbls siracha hot sauce.

This recipe was too spicy for me, even though I cut down on the hot sauce called for in the recipe by half. I followed other reviewers' advice and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking. I also added green pepper and onion. In the end, all I could taste was the spiciness of the recipe. My boyfriend, who likes spicy food more than I do, like this recipe, though.

AMAZING dish for the whole family (me, hubby, 4 year old, and 20 months); with a few small tweaks.  We buy chicken pieces with bone/skin on to save money (yes, its a bit more work to get skin/bones/fat off for nice chunks,  but WELL worth it, never any dryness).  I made this twice & the 2nd variation was PERFECT.  Sauteed mushroom & onions in butter. Meanwhile I coated chicken w/ flour/paprika/pepper/garlic powder mix - shook in baggie, let sit.  Removed mushrooms/onions and added chicken *carefully* to hot oil.  Cooked this for a good 5 minutes for some crispiness! (chicken was NOT dry!!).  Added back shrooms/onions and A dded sauce - all same BUT used terikayi in place of soy, 1T Franks red hot, and 1/8t only ground ginger (its the equivaltend to almost a T of fresh!).  Cooked it for only 4-5 min, got thick just fine.  EVERYONE loved it.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Easy. Fast. Tasty.   Will experiment with adding some cornstarch next time because I really want that sticky aspect.

This was fantastic....Im only giving it a 4 star because i revised the recipe to reviewers comments and also spiced it up a bity by adding cayenne to the flour to coat the chicken....I liked it so much i want to make this again tonight.

EXCELLENT! Husband says it's better than take out! I used a lot of pepper, garlic and onion powder mixed with flour to "bread" the chicken before I cooked in a pan with some butter on high heat. Reduced soy sauce to 3 tblspn as others suggested. I did not add the hot sauce, however the pepper on the chicken gave it a perfect kick! Fresh ginger I think is also key.High recommend and will make again and again!

I did as a few had suggested and coated the chicken in flour first.  I also doubled the sauce recipe.  Very delicious.  I served it with brown rice and snap peas which I also tossed with ground fresh ginger.  It was a perfect meal.

This was very easy to make and had a nice flavor.  I wish I had thrown some veggies in the pan as well - it would have made a nice stir fry.  I didn't have any issues with salt - used a low sodium soy sauce and only used pepper to season the chicken.

Very tasty, but I will definitely limit the hot sauce. My mouth was on fire!  Looking forward to making it again when I can enjoy it without guzzling down milk.

Really good base recipe, but I tweaked it a bit.  I sauteed green peppers and onions in oil and then put aside.  I then cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and added them to a flour mixture of corn starch, paprika, salt and pepper.  Fried the chicken in oil until crisp and cooked through. Added sauce along with the green pepper, onions and a can of baby corn. Simmered for approx. 10 min. and served over rice. Yum!!

This is a great recipe! I use 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 3 tablespoons of hot sauce. I cook it all in a wok and use rice noodles instead of rice. What a great recipe. Thanks!!!!

This was good. My family loved it and cleaned the pot! They kept going back taking Chicken out of the pot after their dinner was gone. I made it like the recipe but like others suggested, I added flour as well. It was very easy to make. Will definitely make it again.

This was good but came out very hot and not too sweet. I'll make it again but next time I'll add more of the sweet ingredients and cut back on the hot sauce. I used the flour and it thickened up just fine.

FANTABULOUS!   I did dredge the chicken in flour prior too and it turned out perfect!  Personally if I was making it for just me, I would make it sweeter.  Hubby on the other hand doesn't like sweet food....so I give it a thumbs up-just the way it is.

This dish made the whole house smell like a good Chinese restaurant! I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce, dredged the chicken and added a TBS of toasted sesame seeds. My family loved it and there was not a nugget of chicken left.

Awesome!  We dredged the chicken and it was perfectly crispy.  With low-sodium soy sauce, it makes something relatively healthy even more nutritious.  I'm thinking of using red-pepper flakes instead of hotsauce to reduce the sodium even more.  Definitely a re-make type of meal!

I have to agree with an earlier post.  Cook the sauce in a different pan.  I followed this receipe and my chicken turned out too hard and dry by the time it was finished.  The sauce was so-o good and I think it'd make a good dipping sauce.  I'm going to try just that when I make Chicken Tempura!

A few changes:   Coated the chicken in flour  Cut soy sauce amount in half and replaced it with oyster sauce   Added 1 extra tsp of hot sauce (Sriracha)   Cut out the ginger root and added more garlic (not a big fan of ginger)

So good! I followed the other reviewers' advice and coated the chicken in flour before cooking it on high heat until very brown. Then added the sauce and simmered with the lid on for 10 minutes. I put in 2 T of siracha and it was a bit too hot for my taste.

We loved this recipe.  I did make two changes.  I floured the chicken before frying and I added 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce to increase the volume.  All three of my kids loved this chicken, which is amazing.

Worth keeping & making again.  Did not use as much soy sauce as called for. The spicy sriracha sauce added a nice touch to the flavor.  Also added onions, bell peppers [slivered], and celery.  Next time {& if I have them] I will add cashew  or peanuts to really make it like a it is an Asian dish.

Excellent sauce! Mixed it and microwaved it to blend it together just before pouring over the seared chicken; it coated the chicken perfectly.

This was nothing short of amazing! I made this tonight and will definitely be making it again. I didn't have honey so I used light corn syrup instead and I left out the ginger all together. I used Frank's hot sauce (the best hot sauce in my opinion) and it was PERFECTION. I used the advice of others and coated the chicken in flour before browning, then I added the sauce and it thickened while simmering (about 20min).

I followed the recipe exactly as listed and it was amazing - so much flavor! It took less than 30 minutes to make and my boyfriend raved about it. I recommend pairing the dish with rice (the rice soaks the sauce up well). I will definitely be making this dish again! :)

Oh man... SO good! It is kind of like a new take on buffalo chicken wings/strips. I didn't have any ginger, so I just left it out and was still good. Also, dipped it in ranch and it was YUMMY. Will definitely make it again!!

This was sweet and slightly spicy but not sticky.  The flavors were very good and I'll make it again reducing the cooking time because the chicken was overcooked.  Eight to ten minutes is the right amount for cooking a whole breast, but too much for strips.

This recipe is incredible!  Like others have stated, I would add a little corn starch to the sauce near the end to thicken it. Otherwise, though, it's perfect... we serve it, with the sauce, over white rice.  Yum!

This is awesome! I just had it for dinner and I want to make it again tomorrow! I scaled the recipe to 3 servings and followed the ingredients to a T. I dredged the chicken strips in flour and browned on med-hi heat and then added the sauce and it came out amazing! Sticky, sweet and spicy! Try this out you will not be disappointed.

Delicious chicken! The only thing I changed about the recipe is the fact that I doubled everything (other than the amount of chicken) so there would be twice the sauce.  My boyfriend and I loved it, served with a simple baked potato and a nice vegetable.  Definitely worth saving this recipe!

I, too, dredged the chicken and that worked very well. However, I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I had to triple the sauce ingredients (EXCEPT hot sauce) to get enough to cover the chicken.

Delicious!  I dredged my chicken pieces in flour, per the recommendation of other reviewers, and added broccoli to the dish during the last couple minutes.  I didn't add the ginger, because I didn't have any.  It tasted like something from a New York style Chinese restaurant!  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! For those having thickening issues try adding a tbsp of cornstarch and a tbsp of cold water to the recipe and cook the sauce a bit before adding it to the chicken.

It was a little spicy for my taste.  I didn't like the ginger chunks, so I will use a micro-plane to zest it next time, and put a little less in.   I dipped some cooked broccoli in the sauce and it was out of this world!  I am looking forward to turning this into a chicken and veggie stir fry next go around.

I think this recipe may be slightly overrated.  It was ok, but a very heavy soy sauce taste.  The sauce didn't thicken as I had hoped.  If you are looking for a better sauce, check out the crispy orange beef recipe on this website.

This was really good! We added green onions, served over rice with egg rolls. Dredged the chicken in flour as other reviewers recommended, and our sauce actually was really thick. Will make again, but according to author intended direction.

This was so easy and delicious! I don't usually like "Asian" food, but this was so good. My roommates and my boyfriend loved it, too! I added a little less hot sauce (about 1/2 as much) because I'm not a fan of spicy food, and it came out just right.

I made this recipe with a few of the suggested changes...floured the chicken.  Used spray canola oil with just a touch more real canola oil.  Lite soy sauce, couldn't find the hot sauce recommended, used "Trader Joe's Hot Sauce.  Used garlic in a tube, and fresh ginger.  After I made it, I found it to be very stong, and hot.  I thought it needed a little more "sweetness" to it, so I added approximately 1/4 cup plum sauce.  Loved the results, as my boyfriend agreed.

great flavor...I had the same problem with the sauce sticking. I even dredged the chicken in flour prior to browning. After my chicken was cooked, I took it out of the pan and then thickened up my sauce with a little bit of cornstarch. I then returned the chicken into the thickened sauce. I will definitely try again.

Loved it!  Came across this recipe today, and decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I followed the recipe, but did change the fresh ginger for powdered, only because I'm not a ginger fan, and find the powder not as strong. My husband raved and said this is a 'keeper'.  If you like a little heat you will enjoy this. It was very easy to prep and cook. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome! I loved it. Not really "Sticky," good all the same. I have to be careful actually, after adding the sauce I have to turn the heat WAY down to keep the sauce from burning. Otherwise the flavor was good!

This is great!  The sauce didn't thicken up, but it didn't matter.  Will definitely make again, perhaps dredging the chicken in flour, as others suggested.

I also dredged the chicken with flour first.  I used Sriracha chili sauce.  Was very spicy and yummy.  I think next time I might double the sauce.

4.5 stars. This was awesome. I doubled all ingredients except soy sauce and hot sauce. I used low sodium soy sauce and Franks hot sauce. I should have used a little more hot sauce. After sauteeing the chicken I sauteed some scallions and garlic in sesame oil, then added the sauce and chicken and let simmer for about 15 mins. I served it over white rice. Will definitely go in regular rotation.

Very easy recipe, and it went over well.  We are tired of just plain chicken breasts!   2 things I changed, and ONLY because I had to. I had no honey....so the only sticky product like that was maple syrup.  I was worried it could ruin it, so I did 1 TBSP....also dipped chicken in floured and cooked on high heat. It turned out great! SOOO if you have no honey and still want to make it, there is no maple taste at all doing it this way :)

I am pregnant and hate chicken right now, but because I really want the protein, I decided to make something with Chicken. I am so glad I came across this recipe because I loved it!! In fact, it just might become one of my cravings. :) Really, this is so delicious. The only change I made was to coat the chicken in flour before browning in the oil. Doing so made the sauce clump up and become very sticky - yet it coated the chicken just perfectly. I even forgot to use the salt and pepper and it still came out amazing. Thank you for such a fantastic way to eat chicken!

We are crazy about this recipe. The first time I made it, the only change I made was to dredge the chicken in flour, as recommended by a few others. Next time, I added some pineapple chunks, dried cranberries, and sesame seeds. I also double the sauce and serve with rice. So delicious!

This was sweet and medium spicy, but the soy saltiness was way too strong for me in this dish. Seeing this was an asian type dish I used Thai sweet red chile hot sauce, but then also used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper sauce called for, louisiana style hot sauce. I used ginger paste from a jar. This was good but needs a few tweaks to make it great.
UPDATE 8-2015: I made this again using 2 chicken breasts cut into cubes, and then sprinkled it with a mix of kosher salt, black pepper, and yellow curry powder. Then I coated it with plain self-rising flour and let it sit while I made the sauce and heated the pan. Although I cut the chicken amount in half to only feed 2, I left the sauce amount as is. I did cut the soy in half since it was too much last time and then added in some Sweet Mirin and a little Teriaki to make up the difference. I used Sriracha sauce but cut it back by 1/2 tsp. I used powdered ginger. I tossed in some broccoli florets that I cooked in the microwave and then some slivered almonds and served this over steamed Jasmine rice. What a delicious meal! I love this recipe.

I made this dish because I had all the ingredients in the pantry.  We all enjoyed it.  I used low sodium soy sauce and only 1 tsp. hot sauce since my 1 year old was eating with us.  Served with roasted broccoli and brown rice.  Fast, easy, and tasty...a working mother's dream come true!

My friend and I made this and of course couldn't quite force ourselves to go by the recipe, we doubled the sauce but cut back the soy sauce and used more honey. We also floured the chicken strips and added fresh steamed broccoli and a can of water-chestnuts. It was FANTASTIC!!!

The family really enjoyed this one... said it was a new take on orange chicken. I had no problem getting the sauce to thicken, although, I did take others advise and lightly coated the chicken in flour. I also doubled the use of oil. and added a drop of sesame oil to the sauce mix. I thought it was just hot enough, used tabasco sauce.  But I did think it was a little too gingery for my taste. But very good! Served with white rice and broccoli.

I am new to all recipes, and this is my first review. I dislike how people make a ton of changes to a recipe and then review and try to make it their own so I wanted to stick close to it. Very good. I did flour the chicken but I think it would have been just fine without doing so and less of a mess.  I also doubled the sauce. DOUBLE the sauce its awesome!   Unfortunately a lot of people said it was too hot so I only used half of what it called for (Definitely use roosters).  To anyone who is nervous of it being too hot..use half and then taste to see if you want more. I used 2/3 what it called for and it was perfect for us. I added a package of frozen oriental veggies for the last 5 mins and served with white  rice.   Very good and will make again.. the sauce is great next time im using shrimp!

Followed the recipe to a tee, except for hot sauce (I had only 1 tbsp left).  Way too salty.  Chicken pieces don't need the seasoning in addition to the soy sauce.  If I was to make this dish again, I'd use half the soy sauce with chicken stock.  My dish came out nowhere near as light as the dish in the accompanying picture.  I won't make this again.

This was absolutely delicious and I was quite the skeptic. I added flour like others said and I didn't double the sauce because it was only for 2 servings, so I left it. I think I would double it in the future because it tastes so good on steamed rice. Great recipe!!

Delicious and easy! The sauce thickened very well, though I did (after reading several review) dredge the chicken in flour. I doubled the sauce and added a little more chicken and some red peppers. Served with rice. Will definitely make this again!

super! I did coat the chicken with flour before frying, but even without that the sauce should thicken just fine. My husband liked them so much that they were gone before I got a chance to serve them!

Total hit with the family. I bought chicken tender cuts and doubles the recipes because based on the other reviews I had a feeling this was going to gobbled up.   I used the flour per other reviews and I also used Sambal and a little tabasco as my hot sauce, so that cut the need for 4 tbsp of hot sauce.   I felt like I had made something I would normally pay $14 for at PF Chang's. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe that is tasty and simple to make. I floured the chicken with all-purpose flour as suggested. For hot sauce, I use chili garlic sauce found at most Asian market. It came out great! Perfect with white rice. The great thing about this recipe is that you can add other ingredients to make it more interesting. Next time, I'll add shrimp.

this dish was very very good.  the flavor is right on the garlic, sweetness, and spicy are great.  i used 3 chicken breast and doubled the sauce.  i had no problem with the sauce getting thick i just simmered it longer.  i served it with rice and it seemed like a great pair.  i used ground ginger and extra garlic.  the only complaint is that the heat level was very very very high.  my hubby loves hot stuff the hotter the better but with this dish he said it was a bit much ?? maybe it was cuz i doubled the sauce?? overall a great dish next time ill make with less hot sauce.  thanks for sharing......UPDATE***** WE MADE THIS LAST NIGHT WITH SHIRACHI sp?? CHILE SAUCE   AND IT WAS RIGHT ON.  THANKS

Like others, I floured the chicken in order to help thicken the sauce - I also added another tablespoon of hot sauce as we couldn't taste it with the recommended amount. Even before that though it was delicious, which is why I gave this five stars. I served the chicken over rice noodles, and it was a hit.

Quick, easy and so tasty! I coated the chicken in flour, salt and pepper before cooking and it came out very sticky. Used tabasco sauce for the hot sauce- that is all I had on hand. I also added red chili peppers and onion to the sauce (with a little extra ginger). Served over coconut rice with veg on the side.   My husband loved it! Next time I might add some bamboo shoots and snow peas.

The was absolutely delicious! Alterations are as follows:  Doubled the sauce.  Cut chicken tenders into bite size chunks.  Tossed in cornstarch.  Fried just until golden and removed.  Used a new pan to mix sauce ingredients, sustituting only ground ginger (2 tsp. for doubled recipe) and Szechwan Chili Sauce for the hot sauce (1 heaping Tbsp for doubled recipe).  Added the chicken and brought to  a boil and simmered till sauce thickened, 2-3 mins.  Thin red pepper strips and water chestnuts were added in with the chicken.  Steamed broccoli and Basmati rice on side, drizzled with the sauce.  Awesome.

'We need to have this more often!'  Quoted from my 8 year old son.  Very good and so easy.  From the other reviews I couldn't decide whether or not to use cornstarch or flour to dredge the chicken, so I used both before putting the chicken in the skillet.  I used Very Hot Tobasco-about half of the called for amount to be kid friendly-and fresh grated ginger.  Added a drizzle of sesame oil at the end.  The whole family was very pleased.  We will definitely have this again.  I served it with Fried Rice Restaurant Style, and Best Egg Rolls from the site.

Really good it's a simple, easy, and tasty dish that can be great for everyone.  I would suggest you use a little bet less soy sauce because its very strong on the meal and the sauce doesn't thicken so it wasn't sticky but i would dry flour like the other reviewers have said. Thanks and Delicious dish!

I made this almost exactly as written (only reducing the hot sauce by about half because I am a bit of a wimp) and it was delicious. I make it a couple times a month as it is a quick and easy weekday meal.

LOVED IT!!!!!! Will be a regular for sure!  I used low sodium soy sauce and only 1 tsp. of Sriracha hot sauce since my husband can't tolerate much spice. I also coated the chicken in flour and then seared til brown before adding the sauce. Next time I will add zucchini and cashews or peanuts to make it like kung pao chicken, only BETTER!

This has quickly become a favorite in my house. As with most recipes, I've played around with it a bit. I always flour the chicken first, which helps to thicken the sauce. I double all of the sauce ingredients - but for the liquid, I do 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup orange juice. This cuts back on the sodium and gives it a nice orange flavor in the background. I use sriracha as the hot sauce, which is very potent, so I just add it to taste. I steam some broccoli and throw it into the pan so it soaks up the sauce. Served over brown rice, this is a great, simple meal.

Absolutely incredible, and CHEAP!!! I doubled the sauce mixture and used ground ginger (I'm not the biggest fan of ginger, so I only used 1/2 teaspoon) and only 2 teaspoons of a very hot chili sauce. I coated the chicken with flour (per another reviewer's instructions) before cooking it in a wok. I used a rice cooker to cook jasmine rice and steam broccoli, then spooned pineapple tidbits over the rice and served it all together in a bowl with chopsticks. Incredible!!! Just like something you'd get at an upscale Chinese restaurant.

So good! I took the advice of others and coated the chicken in a mixture of flour, salt and pepper before frying in the oil.  The sauce turned out perfect, and it is now one of my husband's favorite dishes! UPDATE: I had a craving for this, but didn't have any fresh garlic or ginger on hand, so I subbed a scant 1/8 tsp ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. There was a definite difference in taste, but we still enjoyed it. I also cooked the chicken all the way through, and added the sauce and some frozen broccoli  to simmer at the end. Chicken was moist, and it looked so tasty with the green of the broccoli. I won't ever leave that out from now on!

I thought this was really good, I only used one T of the hot sauce and was happy I did, it was pretty spicy with just that.  We served over rice.

Soooo good. Based on other reviews, the first time I made it I added more hot sauce--we like things spicy, but I definitely overdid the spice--when I put the sauce into the pan the spiciness filled the apartment (and our lungs. oopps). Anyway, so you don't end up unable to finish your meal due to the intense burning in your throat...make it spicy to taste! Trader Joe's crushed ginger and garlic are perfect for this recipe. I dice the chicken breasts and dredge in a flour/garlic salt/pepper before browning (would recommend this), and I make double the sauce. :) You will like this--you can adjust it to your tastes; it's quick and easy and delicious! Oh, and I've used Karo syrup in lieu of honey (ran out); it was fine as a substitute, but the honey adds a slightly heartier flavor. :)

This recipe was AMAZING!! Changes I made: Used 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce, 3 tbsp of soy sauce to start off with. Sauteed chicken separately in veggie oil, then when it was cooked all the way I added the sauce mixture.  The key to getting the sauce mixture right is to keep tasting it and add more of what you think it needs.  If it tastes too much like soy sauce, add more brown sugar and honey. I also added water chestnuts towards the end and they added a great extra touch.  Veggies would also be great in this recipe.  I can't wait to make it again!!

This was really quick and awesome! I only used 1 tbsp of hot sauce and it was plenty spicy enough for my tastes.. but I guess it can really depend on the brand of hot sauce you are using too. I also added some carrot strips which paired really well with the sweet-n-spicy gingery sauce. Will definitely make again!

This is a fantastic recipe. Me, being the foodie I am, tweaked it just a tad. I halfed the soy sauce and added wine for the other half. I halfed the hot sauce because someone near and dear to me does'nt do hot. I also added frozen stir fry vegetables and boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Next time, I will probably add a little corn starch to the sauce before I add it to the chicken, just to thicken it up a bit. The taste was fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was super yummy.  It was very simple and quick to make.  I did, however, double the recipe for the sauce so there was extra to drizzle over the rice I served with it.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated. It had a good flavor, but I feel like it was missing something... maybe some onions or peppers to add texture and variety. My sauce did not thicken very well either, perhaps I should have breaded the chicken as others suggested. My husband loved this, but I just thought it was okay. Would make again with some changes.

Wow, very, very good recipe!! We loved it and will make it again and again. I did lightly dust the chicken with flour to help the thickening process, but that was the only change I made. I served it with rice and sauteed garlic asparagus from this site! Everything was awesome! Thanks Kate!

My husband and I really loved this.  It thickened up just fine for me and I didn't need to coat the chicken in floour.  I used a mixture of breast meat and thight meat.  I used Sriracha hot sauce for the hot sauce.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I cannot remember the last time my family commented so positively about a meal.  My two sons (12 & 10) went for 2nds.  We love Asian food and this tasted just like it came from a fine restaurant.  I doubled the recipe, with the exception of the ginger and hot sauce.  Next time, I will triple the recipe (for more sauce)and add thinly sliced scallions when serving.  I, too, coated the chicken with flour before cooking.

This is another one of those recipes I have been meaning to make forever and finally got to it.  This was very good.  Nice amount of heat and good flavor.  I did double the sauce and I'm glad I did.  The sauce really coated the chicken and the chicken absorbed all the flavor in such a short time - I was pleasantly surprised.  Was good over some jasmine rice.

Very good recipe. Did coat chicken with flour first, and used a little less hot sauce. I would not double the sauce as I do think it can be overwhelming.

This was so delicious, it is sinful that it was so easy.  The smell that came out of the kitchen was incredible.  My son tells me I have to cook again soon, I believe I will. I took the advise of other reviewers and floured the chicken the next time I will try without the flour.

My husband and I loved this--we're fans of heat in our food so we loved the amount of hot sauce but I can see how it would be too much for some people.  I added broccoli to the sauce and used cornstarch to thicken it.  Turned out great!  Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe so many times with and without my alterations and I like it both ways.  However, with my alterations, you get a stronger flavor and more of a sticky coating than a sauce.  I double the sauce ingredients, cook broccoli in the sauce, and add 2 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp water into the sauce at the end.

YUM!  My husband eats everything except bananas.  He’s the least fussy person I’ve ever met.  Whenever I try new recipes his stock answer is ‘Ya it’s good, I’ll eat it again.’  To this he took a bite and ‘Mmmmm!  Ohhh mmmm!  This is REALLY good!’  Therefore this is a keeper recipe!  Alterations to original recipe: Lightly coat chicken pieces with flour (I made half with & half without flour, floured chicken is way better).  When you do that, there is enough sauce for 3 chicken breasts, not 4.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This will definitely be in our rotation.

This was really good!  I gave it four stars because it was a little on the salty side.  Next time I might try a little more brown sugar or possibly low sodium soy sauce.  Otherwise, I did as others suggested and coated the chicken with flour lightly and the sauce thickened up nicely.  It was so good!

This was absolutely delicious! I took others suggestions and placed about 1/3 cup of flour in a plastic bag, seasoned with salt and pepper and shook it up with the chicken.  I cranked up the heat to about 7 on the oven to brown one side then put it at about 5.  Also added about a 1/2 cup of green onions after the chicken was browned, then added the sauce.  I put three good squirts of siriacha to the sauce and about 2 teaspoons of rice wine vinegar and a few hits of crushed red pepper. The sauce was awesome! I only used 2 chicken breast and I still felt like it may have needed a little bit more sauce just because it was that good! Thanks for sharing :)

I made this for dinner last night and fell in love!  I can't wait to eat this again!  I halved the recipe for the sauce and only used 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts cut up into bite size pieces and it was plenty for 2 adults and 2 young kids.  I took the advice of others and floured the chicken pieces before browning them, and then followed the directions exactly and had no problems with the thickness of the sauce.  It became thick and stuck to the chicken perfectly.  I also reduced the hot sauce to just 1 TBS. and it was perfect for me and my kids.  I'm drooling just thinking about eating this again.  Man I wish I had leftovers!!

Excellent- served over jasmine rice with a side of steamed broccoli! My only recommendation is to use low sodium soy sauce because it is kinda salty! Quick and delicious, my husband and I both loved it . . . its a keeper!

Good basic recipe for asian-style chicken. Soy, Honey, Brown Sugar, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Sauce are the basis for a decent sweet & spicy sauce. Dredged the chicken in flour. Cooked over high heat.

Fantastic! There seems to be some people here that say this is not sweet or sticky. The way I made it, it was definitely both. I tossed the chicken in a flour/pepper/garlic/paprika mix, and some excess flour ended up in the pan. I think the excess flour helped the sauce to thicken better.  I doubled the sauce, as recommended by others (a definite MUST!), with the exception of the hot sauce.  I cut that back because of what some other people here recommended. I felt that it was not spicy enough this way (but I like pretty spicy food). When I make it again, I will add a little crushed red pepper or a little extra hot sauce. I served this over white rice with steamed broccoli on the side. Overall, it's an absolutely amazing meal. Especially since it is soooo easy to make.  I will definitely be making this over and over again. YUMMY!

Good recipe with good flavor.  I did add garlic powder to my chicken as well.  I would make it again.  I agree that the chicken does need to be coated in flour.  My chicken was not crispy but was still delicious.  My husband really enjoyed it however the 4 kids mostly picked at it and left the majority on their plate.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 6.

This was a quick, simple and flavorful dish! I doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the soy sauce in which I substituted apple juice. It was a tad spicy so next time I will not double the hot sauce! Overall delightful and will be a go to recipe when I am short on time!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!! I will definitely make again. The only change I made was cut the hot sauce down to 1 tablespoon because my mom doesn't like things too spicy.

Yum! I added onions, carrots and red peppers to make a stir fry out of it. Love the flavour of the sauce! I've made it twice, once dredging the chicken in four and once not. I liked it better when I did.

Delicious - reminiscent of a dish you might expect from a Chinese restaurant (think General Tso's chicken).  I followed previous viewer's advice and lightly coated my chicken in flour/salt/pepper, then browned in a little oil on all sides in a saucepan.  After draining chicken (from any excess oil), I threw it back in saucepan and added the premixed sauce ingredients (again taking other reviewer's advice and cutting ginger and hot sauce to 1/2 suggested measurement).  The sauce thickened up nicely (because I doubled the suggested measurements, it wasn't really sticky) and was really delicious.  Will definitely make this easy, quick and wonderful dish!  Thanks!

Way too much soy sauce.  Should have listened to other comments.  Will make again but half the soy sauce.  So salty this way it burned my lips.

YUMMY!  I truly enjoyed this dish.  I took a couple of people's advice - dredged the chicken in flour, added 1/2 the hot sauce and 3/4 of the soy sauce.  The balance was perfect.  Even my picky husband who doesn't like chicken liked it.  I couldn't believe it!!  Definitely a keeper!

so delicious!!!!!! it was like eating chinese food at my favorite resturant!! i also lightly floured my chicken before cooking then which thickened up the sauce perfectly. for a side dish i made a simple chicken fried rice (from seasoning sold in the asian food isle at any grocery store) and also some hot and sour soup. it was one of the best meals i had eaten in a long time!!

VERY spicy and sticky! Not so much of the sweet. The hot sauce tended to overpower the other flavors. I'd recommend increasing the sugar and honey if you want more sweet flavoring.

If you like a lot of sauce (as in cover your chicken, vegetables, and rice) - double it!  If you just want to coat the chicken, probably leave it as it is. I added some frozen stir-fry vegetables and they were great!  I would, however, watch the amount of ginger - maybe start with less and work your way up to the full amount.  I found it a little overpowering.

Simply wonderful!  I took the suggestion of others and dredged the pieces in flour prior to browning, and I doubled the sauce but only using 1 tablespoon of Siracha sauce.   It was very hot(too spicy for my 5 and 2 year old boys), but my husband I loved it. I had no problems with the sauce thickening, and it adhered to the chicken beautifully with the perfect combo of sweet and heat. I will be making this frequently.

3/17/09:  Wonderful!  I doubled the sauce and only used 1 T. Thai-style chili paste/sauce rather than the hot sauce.  It was perfect for us although I might add an additional 1 t. next time--just for more bite!  I also added broccoli for a one-dish meal served over white rice.  8/6/17:  Still using Thai-style chili paste but no brown sugar. Added broccoli and carrots with extra sauce. Coated chicken with cornstarch. Next time will use flour.

Outstanding!! I doubled everything (including the chicken) and followed the recipe to the letter. For us it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy - it's just as good cold the next day! I definitely recommend simmering the sauce in a separate pot to thicken while the chicken is browning. Can't wait to make this again..thanks for sharing!

Came out perfect...EXCEPT I substituted Chile Garlic Sauce for the Hot Sauce and 2 tablespoons made the dish super spicy! (next time I'll only use 1 tbl.)But it still tasted amazing!! And putting the chicken in flour before cooking is a great tip as well. I served it with Jasmine rice and roasted green beans! Can't wait to make it again!!

Loved it!  My husband said- "this is a keeper, would like to see it again!"  I dredged the chicken in flour, as many suggested.  The sauce thickened without a problem.  Yum!

This was fantastic!  The only thing I will do different next time is to cut the chicken into thin strips and let the sauce permeate a little more. The husband definitely declared this a do again.

Very Good. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder--tasted fine.  It was sticky and sweet.  But, not as spicy as I thought it would be. So, next time I will add more hot sauce.  I made extra sauce and poured it over the chicken before serving for a good sauce for rice.

It's a bit hot for me.  I had to add about a tablespoon of water to it so that it did not become too thick and start burning.  It was as sticky as can be and taste great.

If I could rate this a 4 1/2 I would - made it for dinner tonight, and it IS a keeper!  The lower rating is just because I followed some other reviewer's suggestions to: coat the chicken strips with flour, slightly brown them, remove them from the pan; add the sauce ingredients and cook until they come to a boil for a minute or two, then turned the heat down and added the chicken to finish cooking and thicken the sauce a bit.  While it really wasn't "sticky", the sauce did thicken nicely.  I did add about 1/2 cup water, initially because there just didn't seem to be enough sauce, but I think it helped to keep the sauce from being too salty, as well.  I did use only 1 T. hot sauce, but added 1/2 t. red pepper flakes, just because I don't like the vinegary taste of bottled hot sauce.  Thanks for a wonderful, quick and easy recipe! (With  a little night-before prep, you could have dinner in the time it takes to cook the rice.)  I served this with sticky rice, steamed asparagus, and fresh fruit; I also sliced a couple of green onions to sprinkle over the top.  It is now in my dinner rotation.

Like other reviewers I dredge my chicken in flour, and cut into bite size morsels. Two other small changes I made were I fried the chicken up in fire oil instead of vegetable oil, and I topped with sesame seeds after serving over rice. It was too spicy for my boyfriend, so next time I think we'll halve the hot sauce, and maybe add some pineapple juice...I don't know why other people had trouble with the sauce reducing and getting sticky...mine was sticky before it ever touched the pan, and only got stickier!  Awesome recipe

This was super easy and delicious! I halved the recipe but ended up making a second batch of the sauce so that it would cover the rice completely. I also ended up throwing in some chopped carrots and broccoli to make it into a stir fry type dish.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Wow!  My taste buds are still singing!  We really liked this.  I added green onions at the end, just for some color.  I used San-J brand Hot & Spicy Szechuan Stir Fry & Marinade for the hot sauce, since I was pretty sure that the recipe was not calling for 2 T of Tabasco Sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce if I use four chicken breast halves.  I only used two this time it seemed like the perfect amount.

This is a delicious dish.  Very quick, yet very tasty.  I made brown rice which I mixed with steamed vegetables, a side of fresh asparagus, and cinnamon applesauce.  My husband just loved this recipe and asked me to keep it!  I love that the chicken had a little zing at the end.  Definitely a keeper!

The chicken was definitely spicy. My kids couldn't even eat it, but I really enjoyed it. The only thing I will do next time is decrease the hot sauce by half. I served it with Fried Rice and Parmesan Asparagus.

Even though I doubled the sauce ingredients, I still wanted more sauce to eat over rice.  So I added about 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1 tsp cornstarch.  That decreased the "stickiness" but made it more "rice-friendly" and did not reduce the delicious flavor.  To add a hint more flavor, I included a small amount of Oriental Five Spice.

This is my new favorite! I made it exactly like the recipe and served it over rice, and it was great!  I like my sauces a little thick, so I'll add a thickener next time.  I'll also add some vegies of some kind --- green onion, green pepper, etc., just to add some cruchiness to it.  Wonderful as is, though!

Wonderful recipe! The only thing I did, like others suggested, is dredge the chicken in flour to help thicken the sauce. I also doubled the sauce because it's so good over lots of rice and added stir fry veggies.

This is pretty darn good. I double up on the sauce (with the exception of the hot pepper sauce, which I keep the same), and serve it over rice with fresh steamed broccoli.

I thought this was excellent!I did adda  bit of flour at the end to thicken it up. Also, I didn't really measure anything, just added a little of all the sauce ingredients, but it turned out! I can't wait to make it again! There is something magically yummy about the combination of garlic, honey, soy sauce, hot sauce, brown sugar & ginger (used dried instead of the chopped root). Combined over chicken and slow simmered=food for the gods! I added mushrooms & rice with veggies. Spicy/sweet goodness!

Yeow! This came out spicy! I used 2 Tblsp of the Sriracha ("rooster") hot sauce as suggested in some other reviews.  It was really good, but even my husband suggested I back it down to just 1 Tblsp next time. The other suggestions that I followed were to coat the chicken in flour first, and also cook at a high heat prior to adding the sauce ingredients.

Oh my goodness!!  Dee-lish and so simple. It really did taste like it was from a Chinese deli. My spin on this was to cut the chicken strips into cubes and after reading others suggestions (and I thank you)I coated the chicken in flour  and browned until it was crunchy. I only used two chicken breasts but made the sauce per the recipe. Which makes me wonder if it would really have been enough for four breasts?? It was interesting to read that so many had trouble getting the sauce to thicken mine was perfect after ten minutes. The meat was well coated with a rich sticky caramel colored sauce and the smell was amazing. The only thing I did different with the sauce was to increase the brown sugar to 2 tblsp. which was actually an accident. I also threw in a hand full each of chopped red pepper and green onions for flavor and eye appeal with the sauce. Will definitly be making this again!

We really liked the flavor of this chicken, although I totally forgot to add the hot sauce.  I would double to sauce amounts next time as it not quite enough for three breasts.  I chunked the chicken instead of cutting it into strips.

AWESOME!!! I can't say enough good things about this recipe. Like others, I coated the chicken with flour before sauteing. For the sauce, I used one tsp ground ginger (my grocery didn't have fresh ginger that day), one tablespoon hot sauce (for my toddler's sake), and one Tablespoon plus 2 tsp brown sugar. At the end, I added some steamed broccoli and lightly sauted, sliced onion. I'm not kidding, this recipe ROCKS! I will never order Chicken w. Broccoli from my favorite Chinese place again - this was MUCH better! I (and my husband) can't believe that I made something so good. Thanks! :0)

This was spectacular! I listened to some other reviews and floured the chicken before cooking. It added some texture and probably made the sauce stick to the chicken better. Quick and easy!

Mmm, had this for dinner last night.  I dredged the chicken pieces in flour as others had suggested and the sauce thickened up perfectly.  I used 2 large chicken breasts which was just the right amount for the sauce.  For the hot sauce I used Thai Kitchen Sweet Chili Sauce plus a good shot of Tabasco.  Had heat, but the kids liked it too.  I served it with quinoa but admit it would be better with rice.  Will make again for sure.

Really good!  Even my picky husband liked it.  I cut the hot sauce to 1T and floured the chicken first.  Had to add some broth because the flour thickened it too much. Pretty quick, too.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Delicious. Had to substitute the ginger root w/cinnamon and used about half of the amount. I also added flour to the chicken strips since everyone else seemed to like that idea, and after dipping chicken in sauce and adding to my large cast iron skillet, I dumped the rest of the sauce in, making a thick sauce. Almost too sweet.

Loved this recipe. I love spicy & my hubby does not. So i compromised and used 1 Tbsp of hot sauce. I also used Braggs amino acid sauce instead of soy sauce (a lot less sodium & really tasty).  I cut the chicken into 1/2 inch by 1 inch pieces. I floured the chicken & browned it in sesame oil. Then after turning it once, I added 1/2 cup of chopped celery & 1 cup broccoli. Turned out wonderful. Served over white sushi rice. Perfect amount for 2 people. Yum!

This was pretty good-I think the soy sauce flavor was too dominant though.

Four stars simply because of the changes I made. Very tasty chicken dish, however I did change it a little. As others recomended, I dusted the chicken in about 1/4 cup flour then browned the chicken. I also doubled the sauce recipe, I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger and it was plenty for our taste. I didn't use a much hot sauce  either but that is our preferance. I didn't cook the sauce down as the recipe states, I like a saucier dish.I put frozen peas, two chopped mini carrots, a small onion diced and a clove of glaric. It was very good and easy. My grandaughter loved it. Will add to my recipe box. thank you for a nice change of pace recipe : )

This was an easy, quick, and delicious recipe!  I also lightly floured the chicken.  I doubled the recipe but was afraid that the chicken would be too spicy and too salty for my daughter.  So I used 1 tbsp. of Asian Chili Sauce and 1/4 soy sauce and doubled everything else.  Here's what I found.  It could have used more soy sauce so next time I'll use 1/2 cup and while there was a hint of spiciness I'll up the Chili sauce to 2 tbsp.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks.

Such an easy weeknight dinner, with a nice zip. Was tempted to flour the chicken as one reviewer suggested, but decided to follow the recipe exactly and my husband agreed it was delicious. Served with veggie fried rice. Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe!

The aromas were amazing... the flavors were good. I didn't get the sticky part, which is what I was hoping to have happen with this recipe...something different from other Asian recipes I have made. It was still good, overall. Just not quite what I hoped for.

Very good and very spicy.  Next time I will only use 1T of hot sauce.  Very easy to make and quick.  Next time I will add some vegetables  to the mix.  Will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Edit: I used Sriracha hot chili sauce.  I have never tried it before.  Wow is that stuff good

This was really good, I followed other reviewers and floured the chicken first, It turned out really well. I also used Mushroom flavored Soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce.

This is going to be a staple in my house!  So YUMMY!!!  Added broccoli, onions and red pepper strips.  I cut down the hot sauce because I was worried about how spicy it would be but ended up adding some red pepper flakes at the end.  Topped with a little toasted sesame seeds and served over brown rice.....awesome meal.

Delicious! Tastes just like PF Chang's lettuce wraps. I reduced the hot sauce but I do not like too much heat. I have made this several times - definitely a keeper. I think I will make it for dinner tonight!! I usually serve over rice with brocoli.

This was great.  It was a perfect week night meal because it was so easy to prepare and it didn't take long at all to cook.  This will stay in my recipe box.  I doubled the sauce and served over rice.  Delicious!

I thought this was one of the best recipes we've tried from this site.  My kids screamed about how much they would hate it, and then ate two servings each.  My husband told me to please not lose the recipe or change it at all.  I did dredge the chicken in flour first.  We had rice and roasted vegetables with it.

Wonderful! Mine definitely turned out as the recipe states - sweet, sticky, & spicy. I didn't have any problems with a thin sauce - it perfectly reduced and left a thick sticky sauce that stuck to the chicken. It did take me about 15-18 minutes to completely reduce.  I used Sriracha hot chili sauce. It is a thicker sauce than most "hot sauces" and has great flavor - but, word of warning it is very hot! You can find it on the Asian food aisle in your grocery store.  I added some broccoli florets to the chicken and served over jasmine rice.  The next day I took the leftover chicken-heated it and wrapped it in a tortilla with some lettuce and a little chili mayonnaise.  YUM!

Good, easy and a great base recipe that you can modify to suit your personal taste.  I took others advice and lightly floured and cubed the chicken, browned and then placed the sauce in.  I also steamed some fresh green beans for 5 min. while chicken was browning and then put those in the sauce with the chicken and served over Jasmine rice with some  thinly sliced scallions for a garnish.  I used Thai chili and garlic paste for the 'hot' and I only used 1 tblsp., I think next time I will forego the hotsauce altogether just to see how yummy this is without it.  Thank you for sharing this.  This will stay in my recipe folder :)

This was very good.  A bit too salty because of the soy sauce, so next time I wouldn't salt the chicken.  It could have used a bit more "heat" too so I'll go heavier with the Frank's Hot Sauce next time too.  Served it over rice which soaked up the "sweet, sticky, and spicy" sauce very well!

My fiance LOVED this! So much so, that he wants ne to make it again tonight! ;) I used the ingredients I had on hand, so I used ground ginger and garlic salt in place of fresh. Also used La Victoria Salsa Brava hot sauce. I spiced the chicken with garlic, pepper, and red pepper flakes, and boy was this dish SPICY!! I may omit the red pepper flakes next time. Served with brown rice and broccoli for a delicious, filling meal!

This was pretty good and very easy.  Had everything on hand because the ingredients are pretty much staples in our home.  I had 4 very large boneless/skinless chicken breasts so doubled the sauce.  I did not coat my chicken in flour or add corn starch, and my sauce thickened up nicely anyway.  Next time I can see myself wanting to add onions and maybe celery as it is a recipe that would take them well.  I did cut the hot sauce in half as we don't like things too spicy.  I served with steamed white rice and asparagus.  Turned out to be a nice and satisfying meal that was super simple.

I read up on the reviews first and then I did the following: sliced and fried an onion in a bit of oil and then peeled and thinly sliced a carrot and fried a little bit with the onions, then I removed them from the pan and fried the chicken which I had coated in flour.  I made up the sauce in a separate pan and reduced it a little and then poured over the flour coated fried chicken and the sauce thickened beautifully. Thanks!! Delicious...

Excellent!  I had no problem getting the sauce to thicken.  I did cut the garlic, soy sauce and hot sauce in half due to our own taste preferences and low salt diets.  But we loved it just the same.  Great with a glass of 2% milk, egg noodles, fresh garden salad and chilled fruit.

This was great, but needs some adjusting.  

I added more meat and doubled the sauce to feed our family of four (with some leftovers).  I only used 1 T. of hot sauce for the whole thing (1/4 of what the recipe called for) and it was still plenty spicy.  I can't imagine trying to eat it with an entire 1/4 cup of hot sauce!

I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces (rather than strips) and dredged them in flour and salt before cooking them.  It made the sauce turn out really well.  If you cut the chicken up like I did, it will only take about 2-3 minutes to cook through.

This was so easy and delicious! I basically doubled the recipe and added some thawed broccoli after the chicken was browned then added the sauce. It does help to lightly flour the chicken and I added 2 tbsp cornstarch to help thicken the sauce up. Turned out great!! I'll definitely make it again!

This was an excellent, tasty and indeed spicy chicken dish!  The proportion or amount of each ingredient was perfect. However, I will add more of each ingredient - other than the chicken and oil - to make more sauce, which I must say, was similar in taste to teriyaki.  Although I liked the idea of cutting the chicken in strips, I will keep the chicken breast in tact and cook it in the oven for about 30 minutes before putting in a skillet to brown it and then adding the sauce mixture on top of the chicken.  I will definitely make this Chinese-tasting chicken dish again.

I pounded the chicken thin before slicing and I coated the chicken lightly with flour as others suggested.  I sauted in seasame seed oil instead of vegetable oil and I ended up doubling the sauce but only added 3 tbsp. of hot sauce.  I also added some water chestnuts to the chicken and sauce and served over white rice.

I gave this five stars because it was SOOO easy and my family LOVED it!  So did I.

I took one peron's advice and lightly coated my chicken with flour (dusted it) and I had to use 1 TBSP of buckwheat honey (stronger, darker and not as sweet as regular)in addition to regular honey since I was almost out. 

It was so easy to prepare and just cooked away as I fixed rice and broccoli.  It does have a kick to it, but I like that and it probably would have been a touch sweeter if I had enough regular honey, I may even add an extra bit next time.

It was sticky, reddish brown, spicy and slightly sweet.  My son said he wasn't crazy about the spicy part but he couldn't stop helping himself to more..I pointed that out to him. 

This recipe is an easy to prepare winner as far as I'm concerned and the fact that it has very little oil/fat in the recipe is a nice touch too.

Very, very tasty. We made it with penne which we had left over from another meal and it was SO good. Very spicy & full of flavor. I used powdered ground ginger because I didn't have time to go buy any fresh root but it was still great. We'll definitely make this again!

My husband and I both LOVE this recipe! It sure is spicy!! The only thing I change is I cut the chicken into chunks and shake them in a little flour before I brown them in the pan. The small amount of flour helps the sauce to thicken and stick to the chicken. Delicious! My husband asks me to make it all the time. We pair it with white rice and honey glazed carrots.

This was actually pretty good. I didn't have alot of soy sauce, fresh ginger or chicken breast but I worked out. I used chicken legs adn powdered ginger instead.  It was too hot for my 3 yr old but his father likes spicy foods, so it was great for him. I served it with white rice and corn mixed with string beans. Was a winner in my house!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added a little flour to thicken up the sauce as suggested by others and also tossed the chicken with a few toasted sesame seeds when it was done.  I also added a little extra ginger--next time I think I may add some matchstick ginger pieces to it as well.  Very good!

This was good. I did double the sauce and cooked it down first and then added the cooked chicken. Nice dish, not 5 stars though.

I haven't reviewed anything in years, but this is AMAZING!  I cut the chicken in chunks and floured it before cooking, then removed the chicken from the pan to make the sauce. I let the sauce boil down and reduce for awhile. It got really sticky! Then I put the chicken back in the pan to coat it. I plan on making it again next week for my parents.

I would probably give this recipe 4.5 stars...I thought it should be 5, my husband a 4. Some of my changes: I doubled the sauce, with decreasing the soy sauce and the hot sauce a little; cut the chicken into chunks, tossed them in a mix of flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder. The sauce was very thick and sticky, so I added a couple tablespoons of water once or twice during the cooking time to thin it out.  I will make this again with my changes...it was a little spicy for me, but just right for my husband, so I guess I will leave that and keep the man of the house happy!

I doubled everything for the sauce, except the soy sauce.  I used 1/3 cup soy sauce.  I also coated the chicekn in 1/4 cup flour and then fried in about 3 tbsp oil.  I also only used 2 chicken breast.  We like alot of sauce and was awesome over white rice.

This is a great tasting, very easy dish! I only gave it four stars since it wasn't as sticky as I expected, but tasted perfect nonetheless! I adjusted the recipe by doubling the honey, then doubling the sauce and it was just the right amount. I also sautéed some peppers and onions...thought pineapples would have been a wonderful addition for next time. I served this with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Will DEFINITELY make again :) Thank you!

I would only change the hot sauce measurement to a few dashes, rather than 2 tablespoons.  Other than that, this is perfect and we make it all of the time.

Great Asian-like flavor!!! 4-stars: Had to double the sauce even w/ 2 chicken breast. Used powdered ginger, out of fresh garlic (used powdered), and only a few drops of hot sauce. Added cornstarch/water to thicken. Served over jasmine rice w/ green beans and buttery dinner rolls. Will make again. Thanks!

So good. It does not happen very often that we all like the same thing but my family loved this. It was sweet, it was spicy but not sticky but that was okay because I served it with white rice and the rice absorbed the sauce perfectly. It was the pefect balance of sweet and spicy. Not too much of one or the other. I will definately make this again.

Absolutely easy.  Absolutely delicious.  Made exactly as directed.  Flavors were a perfect blend of sweet and hot.  Added jasmine rice and steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  Recipe will definitely become standard meal.

My husband just made this and it was delicious. He followed the other reviewers' advice and floured the chicken first. I looked at the previous reviews and was bewildered by the people finding this recipe too salty, the recipe says to salt to taste? How much salt did they add that made it salty, it was not salty prior to adding "salt to taste".

Love this recipe!  I made this for dinner last night, but used chicken drumsticks i had in the freezer.  I par-boiled the skinless drumsticks in salt water first, drained, then simmered for about 10 mins with the sauce.  I doubled the sauce recipe but kept the same amounts of hot sauce and soy sauce.  It was perfect!!!  Just spicy enough (though my husband said it was really spice) and sweet and sticky.  I served it on jasmine rice with steamed broccoli on the side.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  *** I also used ground ginger and garlic powder instead of fresh ***

A great dish after following the advice of other reviewers.  I simmered the sauce down a bit before adding it to the chicken, and I dredged the chicken in flour to aid in thickening it.  Lousiana hot sauce added the perfect heat to this recipe.

This was wonderful. I did lightly dredge the chicken pieces in flour before cooking them and it was just the thickening agent the sauce needed. it was perfect. next time I think i will add a bit more sauce and then some snow peas and water chestnuts to this. I also cut down on the hot sauce to 1T and it was good. might just kick it up a tad more next time.

Not as spicy as we had hoped, but we like it hot! Dredged the chicken in flour first, as others had done. Sauce was great, thickened up nicely. This is a good starting point-will tweak to suite our taste. Thanks for sharing.

This is the 1st recipe I have felt compelled to review because it is great. My whole family loved it. I recommend dipping chicken in flour first to help thicken the sauce. I will definitely make again!!

The chicken was very tasty - I thought it was going to be too much garlic, but it was just right. Tastes a lot like the pre-packaged stir fry sauces that come frozen w/ all the fixins, but fresher. I added stir fry veggies, and made some rice. Good, but if you're in a hurry, you're just as well off getting the frozen.

This recipe would be 5 stars easy if you just change two things: dredge the chicken in flour before sauteeing to help the sauce thicken (and kick the heat up to med-high), and use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Chicken breast strips cannot withstand a saute and then a 10 minute simmer in the sauce while it thickens, and I don't tolerate overcooked chicken. Thighs, on the other hand, handle this method perfectly.  Prepared with these few changes, the recipe is fantastic.

Great recipe! I'll admit that there was more hot sauce than I would prefer, but my company had a majority of hot & spicy lovers in it, and they couldn't get enough!  It made for a very pretty presentation, too!  I served it over jasmine rice.

Delicious! By far my favorite recipe from this site. My boyfriend could not stop commenting on this recipe. I doubled the sauce upon reviews and it was worth it. Added chicken to a bed of white rice and drizzled the extra sauce on top of the whole meal Update: Just tried this again and it was delicious. Coated the chicken in soy flour and gave it a nice coating. The sauce turned out great too!

This was really good - I tossed in fresh vegetables to the chicken mixture (so I had to make more sauce): broccoli, carrots, onions and mushrooms, and I let that simmer for awhile until the veggies became soft but still a little crunchy. I served it over a bed of rice and both me and my husband loved.

This recipe was amazing!! My boyfriend and our roommate both loved it and any meal that pleases two middle-aged men works for me!!  I enjoyed a lot!  Great served with white rice...so quick and easy...I didn't even wait for the sauce to thicken very much...it left more to go over the rice!

my guys loved this one. Husband's only complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce. Must admit I cheated a bit -- my son's palate is a bit wimpy, so I used Heinz Chili Sauce instead of hot sauce. It was still yummy

I found this recipe to be just so-so. There was nothing wrong with it, really, it was just a little bland and I've made better Asian chicken using "easiest teryaki marinade ever", "amber's sesame chicken" and "almond chicken stir fry" recipes off of this site.

This is so good ! I had to use dry Garlic and Ginger, all I had at the moment, will use the fresh next time, but I don't think it could be that much better ! My house smelled heavenly for two days afterward. My picky husband gobbled it up !

excellent--even my extremely picky daughter chowed down on it.  one reviewer said that it was good with pork instead of chicken; i would bet that it would also work well with beef. more thoughts at a later date: since sticky chicken is almost always made with chicken thighs in chinese restaurants, i made it that way, which means that the chicken doesn't dry out while the sauce thickens. added carrots, onion, and sliced red and green peppers - very tasty. agave syrup can be substituted for honey, and using sriracha hot sauce ensures the heat!

Wonderful flavor.  A bit too spicy for our taste, and I cut the hot sauce by a tsp.  Will only use 1 Tbsp. next time, and go from there.  The sauce didn't really thicken, so I threw in a couple tsp. of corn starch at the end and that worked nicely.  This would be excellent with some stir-fry vegetables thrown in, too.

This was a great recipe, it had a really nice thai taste to it. The fresh chopped ginger root REALLy made the sauce, I would definitely recommend using it to the dryed spice. I did make a few adjustments as follows:  -3 Tablespoons of hot sauce instead of 2  -About a teaspoon more honey and sugar     to counteract the salty soy sauce  -A dash of nutmeg,cinnamon and cayenne   pepper  -1 teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce Hope you enjoy!

Made exactly as directed for 5 people. Everyone said this was exceptional, professional quality and “will you make it again?!!” Served it with brown rice and green beans with Fresh garlic & almonds. It was lots of fun to make, and really tasted great!! The ginger flavor was subtle and blended well with the Franks Red Hot and honey!. Delicious!!

Loved it. I used chicken tender filets, cut into pieces, floured with seasoning before stir fry on med-hi heat. I also heated the sauce in a separate pan before adding to meat/veggies to reduce it so it thickened. 

I modified the sauce to include a dash to sherry wine, rice wine vinegar, mirin, and sesame oil. I used whatever hot sauce I wanted then topped with chili garlic sauce and garnished with green onions.

This could be a 5 star recipe if it didn't need so many changes.  I put the chicken strips in a bag with flour, salt, pepper, and onion powder and  shook until covered.  I cooked the chicken on med-high then turned down to med.  I mixed the sauce ingredients together and found there would not be enough  so I did 1.5 x the sauce.  I used ground ginger and put 1.5 tsps, it probably could have used closer to 2.  I put 8 dashes of Tabasco sauce as that is the only hot sauce I have.  I cooked the sauce and tasted it before adding the chicken--it was way too strong.  I added some of the water I boiled the broccoli in, about a cup (but I recommend to add per taste--apple juice would probably work great, too).  Plus I thickened the sauce with 1 T cornstarch in 3 T water after I put the chicken in.  before serving I stirred in 2 cups chopped broccoli florets.  Not bad at all, I plan to make this again sometime.

Excellent!  I followed sauce to a T, however, I have doubled on occasion. I preheated my pan (stainless steel), then tossed cut boneless skinless thighs, (our preference) in around a tbs of cornstarch (makes for crispy chicken), added to oil basted pan, high heat, (chicken won't stick if you let pan get hot enough) tossed around till browned, then added my sauce that I pre-mixed, swirled it quickly in hot pan to coat the chicken.  Sauce will thickened up quite quickly, and let simmer about 5 minutes to finish chicken.  Add a touch of water if sauce is too thick.  Served with fresh green beans and whole grain brown rice. Yum!  I make this often.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and did exactly as followed. The only changes was using powdered ginger and garlic, as I lacked any fresh. And I used low sodium soy sauce. 

This was definitely spicy for me, but not intolerable. If/when I make it again I'm going to use only half the hot sauce. 

It thickened for me. The key may be boiling off the excess water (in the soy sauce for example). It's the same method/idea in making jam. 

For a first time make, I'd say it went over well, just a little too hot for our taste, but no one in the family really complained and it justified eating ice cream afterwards. :)

Great recipe.  Like some of the other commenters, I dredged my chicken which made it turn out tender and made the sauce stick to the chicken really well.  I also added a little rice vinegar to the sauce because I always seem to overdo either the soy sauce or honey initially and it does a great job of cutting whichever flavor I overdid (this time the honey).  We also added some broccoli and shredded carrots directly into the chicken and sauce mixture to make it a full one-skillet meal and it was awesome.

The recipe overall was very good! I enjoyed it and will make it again. this time I think I will add peppers or Broccoli. I altered the heat and added half the recommended hot sauce. Perfect heat to sweet ratio if you or you spouse is not into very hot foods. Thanks!

Made it mostly as stated plus a suggestion from the reviews. I fried all of the chicken strips after coating them in flour, salt, and pepper. A little trick is to put those three in a ziploc bag and shake it up to coat the chicken. Then, after I fried the chicken completely, I mixed the chicken into the sauce in a large bowl instead of simmering. Not my favorite flavors (not a big ginger fan), but was a big hit with the family. Overall, easy to make!

Loved this recipe! I used cornstarch instead of flour to coat my chicken and Braggs Amino since i cannot eat gluten. Also added 4 Thinly sliced baby carrots, tossed in a few handfuls of honey roasted peanuts and some diced red bell peppers that I had in the freezer. Put a teaspoon of sesame oil in the sauce. It was phenomenal over cauliflower rice. Was NOT disappointed! Will make this again when I get hungry for Kung Pao Chicken.

This came out amazing. I followed people’s suggestions to cut the chicken in bite sized pieces and coat in flour prior to putting it in the pan. I used Sriracha for the hot sauce and added sautéed broccoli, peppers, and onion right before I simmered the sauce. Served with brown rice and it knocked everyone’s socks off.

This turned out absolutely amazing. I didn't make it exactly how the recipe called, however. I fried the chicken (diced up some thin chicken breast, tossed them in egg white then a seasoned flour) while grilling some white onion slivers. Once the chicken was cooked I moved it over to the pan with the (now slightly browned) white onion and added the sauce. I let that simmer for maybe 10 minutes while mixed it all together and it came out PERFECT. Poured the chicken over a bed of white rice and garnished the whole bowl with green onion and sesame seeds. Freaking. Wonderful. Oh, and I pretty much doubled the amount of honey. Will be making this again.

Thumbs up to this dish, with a few minor adjustments. I halved the soy sauce and  added water to make up the total amount. I went really heavy on the garlic(can never get enough!) and added a pinch of cayenne pepper powder for a bit of heat. I followed someone's suggestion to pre heat the sauce-that worked very well.

Based on tips here, I coated the chicken with a light dusting of flour. Added the sauce right to the pan with chicken, it thickened up quickly. Added cilantro and a few toasted cashews before serving - it was DELICIOUS. The cashews added the perfect texture and the cilantro added a nice flavor. My picky bf went back for seconds.

Made it as suggested in the video  but also sauted the chopped garlic and onions separately.
Flour dredged the chicken, cooked for a few minutes in peanut oil (instead of veg oil), with a cup of chicken broth along with the mixed sauce, and added the onion garlic saute mixture. Let it simmer for 8 minutes and added cooked noodles and toasted sesame seeds.
It's a great recipe!

I doubled the sauce (but not the hot sauce). My chicken breasts must be larger than normal because I used 3 and barely fit them in my large skillet. I would use 2 next time. It was easy to make. (I did dredge my pieces in corn starch as others suggested to help thicken the sauce). I added some broccoli pieces too. The flavor was good but oh-so-spicy. If I made it again, I would put less hot sauce and more broccoli in it. The chicken was perfect and flavorful.

I thought this was great! I followed the recipe as is but the consistency of the sauce wasn’t right (which is why I think some weren’t experiencing the “sticky” side to it). So I played with the sauce a bit (adding a touch more brown sugar, honey, and more hot sauce) and it came out perfectly. I used it to make lettuce wraps with Asian white rice topped with chopped up honey roasted peanuts and sesame seeds(picture posted above). It was a big hit here! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Easy but super salty. Go for the low sodium and add some more sugar as it’s not very sweet. But a decent start

I did make a couple of modifications, but this was a homerun at my house!  I am very sensitive to heat, so I used only about 1/2 the amount of hot sauce, and I used a sweet chili sauce to make up the difference.  I also did 1/2 fresh ginger root and 1/2 powdered ginger.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was absolutely delicious served over sticky rice!!

Mine turned out really well! Unfortunately my sauce didn’t thicken up like I wanted to. It wasn’t sticky. The dish still had great flavors though...I could taste everything.It had a very nice spice and goes well with broccoli and rice. As other’s have recommended you should dredge the chicken in flour so it can get a nice brown look. I think this dish would be good with teriyaki sauce too. I will definitely be making this again in the future??

Terrible! This was so salty I could barely eat it. I usually follow recipe's exactly, as I did with this one but I should have used my better judgement concerning the salt because I knew it didn't sound right. I only sprinkled a small amount of salt on the raw chicken as directed but even without doing so this dish would still have been way too salty...and I love salt! 
It was not sticky or sweet either. The sauce never thickened and again (against my better judgement and experience), how would it since the recipe doesn't call for any flour or cornstarch.
I simmered it longer than directed while I cooked plain (no salt) rice thinking it would thicken, and thinking that the rice would now help counteract the salty chicken but I think simmering it longer only caused the chicken to be completely permeated with the salt.

I have made this many times, it is one of the best chicken recipes out there in my opinion. The only thing I change is to cut the hot sauce a bit, double the sauce. Sometimes I dredge my chicken or not it is good either way. I am adding my review because I made a mistake that turned out great last time I made this. I forgot to pull the chicken out of the freezer! I had a pork loin that I was going to put in marinade for next nights meal so I decided to try it. I diced it in cubes and cooked just like the chicken. It is just as good over pork!

Not impressed.  Read the reviews and cut back on the soya sauce and hot sauce but it was so boring, I ended up adding them back in. It's okay but not even as good as what comes out of a jar.

Coated the chicken in flour and seasined with salt and pepper. 

Doubled the sauce ingredients except for soy sauce. Used a quater cup of soy sauce and added 1/2 cup of Campbell 's chicken broth. 

As i fried up the chicken, i deglazed pan using chicken broth. 

I used 2 Heaping teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with 1/2 cup chicken broth and added to sauce. I allowed sauce to thicken slightly before adding the cooked chicken. 

It turned out delicious with the changes made. With changes, i would rate it at 4 and 1/2 stars.

Cubed boneless thighs and tossed in cornstarch. Only used a couple dashes of hot sauce to keep the kids happy. I was afraidnit might be too sweet with that much honey, but it wasn't . Husband said it was better than other Chinese chicken recipes I've tried. That's good to hear, because it was much easier with fewer ingredients!

I did not make any changes to recipe except that I cut it in half because I made it for me and my husband. This was the only mistake I made because we both loved it. I will make full recipe next time. Easy to make also!

I did shake the chicken in flour before I browned it in oil, then I followed all the steps and added broccoli and zucchini from my garden to the sauce. My husband loved it!

The suggestions in earlier reviews were great.  As a bachelor that does not do much cooking this turned out to be a pretty easy project. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will add a few vegetables - wow I  actually sound like I’m kind of a cook.

Good flavor but I wish I would have read the reviews before making it.  It did NOT thicken up and get sticky.  It did not get brown on the medium heat.  In reading at least one review, I agree about making the sauce first and getting it to thicken up and THEN adding the chicken. Good idea, but needs a good it of work to live up to what is promised by the recipe.

Delicious! but VERY spicy. Which means my husband LOVED it and I had to cool the heat. I breaded the chicken as recommended by another reviewer. I also added broccoli from the garden. It'll make a great dish in the winter

The sauce never thickened even when practically boiled to the bottom so it did not stick to the chicken very well.

After reading some of the reviews, I only used 3 tbsp of soy sauce and added about 1\4 tsp of red pepper flakes for a bit more spice. I also cooked the chicken and sauce separately and combined them at the end. It worked out well. I served the chicken with rice. Next time I want to add a green (maybe broccoli) of some sort, too.

I made this just as the recipe states but after tasting a bit added more hot sauce cause we like things a bit spicer and it was fantastic!!!!! As other reviews have stated it didn’t thicken up very much but I don’t care as I like it a bit saucier and it would be great poured over rice. I loved it just the way it was and this is now in my rotation!!! Great recipe!!!

This is a simple but rewarding recipe.  I made it and I loved it. I did change it a little by adding broccoli as mentioned. I also added red,green and yellow bell pepper strips and onion. I paired it with yellow rice and Jiffy corn bread. The sweetness of the bread and the heat of the sauce made an excellent combo. Can't wait to make it again.

Made this with 1 extra tbls of brown sugar- added broccoli and shivered carots and and onion. During the last minute I added a slurry of cornstarch and water. This thickened it up beautifully. I also used chicken  tenderloins. This was quick an easy and we loved it and added and I will definitely make often

I doubled the sauce recipe.  I tossed the cut up chicken pieces in corn starch before I fried them,  I read that on another review. It thickened up nicely.  For the hot sauce, used sriracha, and only 3 tablespoons for a double recipe, not four.  SPICY!  Does everyone use Tabasco?  I then added a little more ginger and then more brown sugar to sweeten it some.  EXCELLENT!!  My family loved it!  It is a keeper.  Served it with rice and steamed broccoli.

mine came out sticky, sweet, but not as spicy as I hoped. Maybe my ginger was at fault.  Topped with toasted sesame seeds. my guests liked it better with potatoes, than rice.

I like the recipe.
I made several changes. I seasoned my chicken with a blend.
For 4 chicken breast, I  increased the sauce ingredients and added corn starch after it did not thicken.
I prepared rice and broccoli with peppers and onions .

Absolutely delicious!  Made according to recipe except added broccoli and onion. I might try a “tad” less Siracha next time. We loved it.

Absolutely  delicious ! Used thin sliced breasts chopped up . I did do  as others suggested with dredging in flour . That must be the trick . As mine  thickened up fast.

Really good, did drudge chicken in flour (not sure that was necessary) and next time will cut back on the hot sauce, served with rice so I didn't won't the sauce too thick as others suggested doing.

Delicious with a few changes:
1. Stirred in about 2 tbsp of flour to the chicken before frying it.
2. Added onions, red peppers, mushrooms and snap peas (pre-fried the onions, peppers and mushrooms, then added in at the end to simmer with the rest of it)
3. Subbed Rogers Golden Syrup for the honey (gives a more complex flavour).
4. Used Thai Sweet Chili Sauce as the hot sauce.
5. Doubled the sauce recipe.
I served it over rice and it was sweet, spicy, sticky and delicious

This is amazing!  I thought I would need double the sauce but, trust me, you don’t. It would make it soggy. I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and browned it in the oil. Once it was almost brown I added fresh broccoli and tossed it on medium high. After 3 minutes I added the sauce and simmer on low for a couple of minutes.

The only change was to dredged the seasoned chicken through corn starch and then browned.  Turned out perfectly. Also used gluten free soy sauce which makes this dish completely gluten free. Hubby loved it and will make it again.

I doubled all of sauce except for soy and dredged chicken in flour before browning.  Once sauce was incorporated and thickened I removed from stove. 
Once chicken was browned I removed from pan and added to the sauce and let sit.  I sauted my veggies and when done I added the coated chicken into pan. Stired and served over pan friend noodles. Tasty and sticky and chicken tender.

This is a very good sauce...just needs one minor addition to thicken. A teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a little cold water added to the sauce while still cold. Will thicken immediately!!  Allow to cook with chicken a few minutes to cook the taste of cornstarch away. So much simpler than many other recommendations and much less messy.

Tasted good but the sauce wasn't super flavorful and it never became sticky. I cooked it a little too long waiting for the sauce to thicken and the chicken was a bit dry.

I used dark soy sauce and it was absolutely delicious. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and it turned out fine. Everything else remained the same. I also used the same sauce (with added apple cider vinegar) to dress a side salad. The rice was so good after I worked the sauce in there too. All in all, excellent recipe that I’ll be making again for sure. Next time I’ll try light soy sauce.

I made it again. This time I added veggies to the chicken. Perfect.

Overall it was a very good dish.   I doubled the amount of sauce so the chicken and coated the chicken with gluten free flour so it  was nicely coated.  I reduced the hot sauce and garlic by half.  I will make this again but I will use a sparingly amount of garlic and hot sauce.  Although, I had reduce these ingredients by half it was still too hot and garlicy for my taste.   I served it over rice and with snow peas.  There was enough left over to make sliders the next evening.  I used Hawaiian rolls and topped the chicken with cole slaw.  My husband was a fan of this recipe.

I used Sriracha which adds a great depth of flavor.  I did dredge the chicken in flour and added onions before putting the sauce in. I followed the recipe other than adding extra ginger and garlic and about half a cup of water to the sauce to prevent it from burning. The sauce thickens quite quickly and I did cook over a low flame it with a lid on for 8min timed. Served over rice noodles. 

Will definitely make again! It is not extremely spicy. I was happy with the little kick but you'd definitely want to add more hot sauce or pepper if you really want some heat.

I made this recipe for my family and it turned out great except we added a bit more Brown sugar for a little more sweetness. I myself think it was a little too spicy but my husband and children didn't think so. I will definitely be making again.

Recently I have been making food that is too spicy for my kids (mostly because I am still learning) So I only put 1 Tablespoon of hot sauce instead of two. But otherwise I followed the instructions. I served it with rice and peas. The leftover sauce from the pan went well over the rice. My family really enjoyed this one.

I added green and red pepper, a little corn starch and some cilantro and it was quite tasty. Instead of Tabasco sauce, I used garlic chili sauce.

Loved it!  Did dredge the chicken lightly in flour and sauce was very sticky, used jarred garlic and regular soy sauce.  I only used a heaping tablespoon of sriracha and it had plenty of kick for us.

I used Tiger Sauce since it didn't specify a hot sauce, added extra pepper flakes, halved the brown sugar. I also used boneless thighs and dredged them in corn starch. High heat, enough oil to sizzle(almost smoking) for a quick browning and dumped the whole mess in a crock pot on Low for about 3 hrs. Delicious! Will definitely make it again but next time I'll just use the corn starch slurry to thicken it. I think it may look prettier with a glossy sauce and naked chicken vs the chunky I got from dredging.  Didn't have any sesame seeds but sprinkled some chopped green onion tops on it for color and it looked as good as it tasted.  Served with rice and steamed broccoli.

PERFECT dinner for a weeknight! But next time, I will add little bit more of the sauce. And the hot sauce too.

Definitely a do again dish!!!

Very good tasting (and sticky) chicken recipe.  I doubled the "saucy" ingredients and eliminated the salt.  Soy Sauce is salty enough.  Like other reviewers, I dredged the chicken strips in flour (approx. 1/2 cup) before frying.  I used high heat and cooked the chicken strips until they really started to brown, then added the sauce and reduced the temperature to medium low.  I allowed the sauce to reduce (and get sticky) for approx. 15 minutes.  The chicken remained tender and was not dry.  Great flavor.

Very tasty...I split it in half and made one batch without the hot sauce for my kids, and they loved it.  Served it with "Fried Rice Restaurant Style" and will definitely make it again, possibly with some corn starch to thicken up the sauce.

So yummy! If there is excess water from very cold or frozen chicken pour it out before adding the sauce to get a better thickness.

Great recipe! I got all excited to make this and of course I  find out I'm out of chicken breast.  So I actually used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I didn't even cut them up, just cooked them whole. I followed the recipe pretty much, I coated the chicken in cornstarch like some suggested and I used liquid amino acids instead of soy sauce.  I diluted it with a little water ( I find it to bit a bit salty) I  couldn't add the hot sauce because of kids sensitive taste buds, but I know it would've been even better! It was so easy and everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this twice- first time I followed directions as is.  Not enough sauce for me personally, so I doubled the sauce directions the second time. PERFECT! Two friends asked me for the recipes immediately and I sent them the link  :)

SUPER delicious.  I followed the reviewers’ recommendations of doubling the sauce and using flour for the chicken, and added broccoli.  Next time I want to use shaved carrots as well as sesame seeds.  Definitely adding this one to the regular repertoire!  Thanks for posting it!

WOW!!  This is sooooo good, just like something you'd get from a Chinese restaurant.  In general I prefer to use chicken tenders instead of breasts.  So I use those and cut them into small bite sized pieces. I also took other peoples advice and floured the pieces before cooking, adjusted siracha sauce to my taste, served with rice and Asian veggies and it was perfect!

Very easy especially when you take time to prep before...I did all the measuring and dicing and mixing before...then just put together when I was ready. I had thick breasts, so as they cooked,  I had to add extra soy and brown sugar (which made it even better to me).  Really is an easy recipe and doesn't take too much time, but it will taste like it does.

Delicious! Used sriracha sauce in place of hot sauce and it added a fantastic kick to the sauce. The sauce came out amazing, will have to make this for all sorts of side dishes. Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli for a filling meal! Will definitely be making again

WOW, amazing chicken! It was soooooo good! I made only a few changes after reading people's reviews. I made the sauce FIRST (which I doubled, except for the hot sauce, I only used 3 tbl, because I had 7 huge breasts). As the sauce was simmering in a separate sauce pan, I heated the oil on med/high in a non-stick frying pan. I then began to prepare the chicken. After I cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces, I put them in a large bowl and tossed some flour to coat.  I then seared the chicken for about 1-2 minutes on each side. (They are still a bit pink inside.) After they have browned, I put them aside. I did two batches. By the time the chicken was browned, the sauce was bubbly and somewhat thick. I quickly poured the sauce over the chicken, covered, and simmered for only about 6 minutes. The chicken was not dry at all! I served it with white rice and sauteed broccoli. Next time, I  think I'll add more honey  and brown sugar because I didn't detect any sweetness at all.

Tasty and easy; although I am not of asian descent I feel as though the recipe is fairly authentic to the cuisine. It was a delicious recipe, however my family eats out a lot so I feel as though it was not overtly better persay than restaurant quality. So, for that reason only I probably won't experiment with this recipe further.

I know people don't like it when you give a recipe 5 stars and then include the changes that make it 5 stars, but that's what the reviews are for.  I always read the reviews before I make something, but won't even look at a recipe with low stars, so I love it when people take a good recipe and make it better.  I followed others advice and floured my chicken before frying it in a large frying pan until golden, then I added the sauce  (minus 1 T of hot sauce, I love spice, but find 1 T is a perfect mix of hot and sweet) and cooked until it thickened slightly.  The first time I made this I cooked the chicken on a higher heat which smoked up my house and it was hard to control the browning, some was burning while I frantically moved the chicken around the pan.  Now I fry it on a low/medium heat and it browns perfect and when I add the sauce the pan is a nice lowish heat so the sauce doesn't burn.  You may have to experiment with this recipe, but it is worth it. It states that it serves 4, but don't be afraid to add more chicken, there is more than enough sauce.   It is like General Tso's  chicken, but better because you made it yourself.  I serve it with rice and steamed broccoli.  Better than take out.

I made this recipe with a few changes . I used worcheshire sauce for the soy sauce ( I was out). Dried ginger powder for fresh ginger root. I added a bit more salt and eliminated the hot sauce. My husband gave me a compliment. I will make this again.

Next time I’m going to cube the chicken instead of strips. I also doubled the sauce but overall it was good.

This was ok . Not my fave flavor on this one , I had to add a bit more brown sugar & honey  or it tasted a bit sour  ( this improved it without making it sweet ) I first tossed the chicken in flour so the sauce would stick . I served with brown rice .

I added a little flour to the chicken to help thicken things up and give the chicken a little sear.  I cooked the chicken and removed it t allow the sauce to thicken a bit.

I'd suggest doubling the sauce ingredients, except for the Soy (at 1/3 cup) and the hot sauce (siracha) I would recommend 2 TBSp for mild and 3 TBSp for medium heat.

Everyone raved about how delicious this meal was! I used 3 large chicken breasts cut into small bites, I ended up needing to triple the sauce recipe to coat all of the chicken. I did toss he chicken in flour prior to putting in the pan, as others had suggested. It turned out great! I served with white rice and teriyaki veggies.

Delicious recipe!! I agree with other reviewers about the sauce not thickening up. I added about a TBS of whole wheat flour and simmered a bit longer, and that did the trick. It was a big hit with my boyfriend and I. Even his picky teenagers son said he liked it! ??

I love this dish.  I added Snow peas, and water chestnuts.  I also put a few dashes more of hot sauce. And before I cooked the chicken, I coated it in flour. I will make this again.

Really good!! Made it last night, my dad and I loved it! Added some chilli flakes for that extra kick. 
Good veggies to add to this are tender stem broccoli, mangetout, capsicum and baby sweetcorn. 
Super delicious

Overall, the flavor was great. I would make it again and take everyone’s recommendation of adding flour to the chicken pro to cook it to see if this sticky portion of the recipe works.

Hubby and I loved it with rice.  I did add starch flour to the chicken before cooking it in olive oil.  I made the dressing ahead to have it meld for at least 1/2 hour.  I added the dressing after the chicken was cooked and covered to make a thicker sauce.  I would definitely have this again.  Would have added broccoli but didn't have any.  Made Mediterranean Kale salad from this site on side and it was delicious.   A great healthy meal.

Very good recipe. Thanks!!

I kept to the recipe ingredients. Doubled the sauce except for the soy sauce which I used maybe an extra tablespoon. Floured the chicken and used Sriracha for the hot sauce. 

One of my new favorite chicken on rice recipes.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written although I did as others suggested and took the chicken out of the pan then added the sauce and reduced it before putting the chicken back in. It was sweet,spicy and sticky. I will make this recipe again!

It was a good, weeknight meal, very easy to put together. We added some broccoli to the meal to make a nice stir fry-type bowl.

I'd recommend adding in some cornstarch, otherwise there's no way the sauce is going to thicken up.

The only way this deserved five stars is after I doctored it up....otherwise I would have given it two stars. I tasted the sauce and all I could taste was soy sauce. It was not sweet at all!  I added a lot more brown sugar and honey and a tiny bit of sesame oil. It turned out sweet and sticky this time and was very good. Next time I won’t put as much soy sauce or ginger and I’ll serve it with wings.

I combined tips from others as follows. I used 1.75 lb chicken for 4 people. I doubled the sauce but halved the hot sauce. I coated the chicken in flour and pan fried while the sauce was on low. My 13 year old loved it but my 16 year old said it was too hot and could barely eat it. So if you don’t like spicy foods, only use half the recommended hot sauce. There was none left and it was enjoyed by 3 out of 4. Oh and the sauce perfectly coated the chicken but did not make enough to be considered a sauce that you would eat over rice.

When you put the sauce on the chicken cook it in high and cover. It will help to make the chicken sticky.

This was a super good recipe.  But I would at least double the sauce ingredients if you like more sauce for your rice.   I will make this again!

This was super easy to make but I found that I had to make double the sauce to cover all the chicken and it was still not sticky. It was flavorful sure and spicy but not saucy and sticky. I probably will not try this again.

Everyone including me loved this dish, I made it 2 days ago and got request to make it again. Instead of adding broccoli,  I used it as a side dish.  I didnt add flour, it wasnt in the recipe, I happened to watch the video tonight were it said to add 2 tablespoons of flour.  Myself I think it's to spicy but they like it spicy so I will make this tomorrow with the flour. I wish that the sauce recipe had more quantity, wasnt able to garnish dish with any extra sauce.

Made lots of changes on this one. Instead of honey, used brown sugar. Browned the chicken with an egg wash dipped in flour .
Added sliced green and red bell peppers, and also sliced fresh mushrooms. 

Sauce consisted of the brown sugar, hot chili oil, sesame oil and soy sauce to give it some spice. Came out delicious and served it over a bed of jasmine rice!!

I doubled the sauce recipe. Maybe that was a mistake? It never thickened. 
Way too salty and chicken got over cooked waiting for the sauce to thicken.

Family liked. Marinated chicken in mixture. Then drained it off and boiled it till sauce thickened. Then put chicken in and cooked so it did not dry out. Next time I will add an additional tablespoon of honey and green onions as garnish. It made for a quick easy dish that is tasty without added calories of cheese, cream or bacon. Thanks for the submission- we will make again

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was sooo spicy. Way too much ginger and hot sauce. It never thickened up, so was not sticky. Soy sauce was overpowering. My husband and I couldn't finish it. Definitely would not make this again.

I pretty much followed the directions and did the same thing that  Christy Vella  Noland suggested. I used Frank’s RedHot wings buffalo sauce. Added a 16oz bag of frozen Florentine style vegetables after chicken was browned and turned down to 3, put lid on pan and let cook for about 6-8mins longer. My son who doesn’t like food too spicy, when I told him I could make it less spicy next time said not to change a thing! Was a quick dinner, will be faster now that I know what to do! I may just double the sauce next time, hubby likes ITV a little more saucy, think the veggies sucked up the juice a bit too. Oh only used 2 breast, diced up, had enough for 4 of us.

I used this as a base and made some changes.  I added Baby Bella mushrooms and chopped onion.  I also used about 1/4 of a cowhorn pepper instead of pepper sauce.   I believe I made it better. At least to my tastes.

Only omitted hot sauce.  The sauce never actually thickened - I don't know why and I don't care - it was absolutely delicious!!!! The taste w/o the hot sauce replicated my favorite Chinese restaurant's garlic sauce to a tee!  Thank you sooo very much, it's a keeper for sure.

We read the reviews about the sauce not being thick enough so we battered the chicken with an egg/flour mixture and fried it up a bit with a few tablespoons of oil. We also stir fried some onion, broccoli, belle peppers, carrots and celery to go with the dish. We tripled the sauce and added chili flakes to it and about a cup of water. To finish we added some cilantro and toasted cashews  on the top. The additional water helped cut the saltiness and it had no problem thickening up with the flour which we poured over rice. The dish was fabulous, the taste was great.  One of our favourite dishes!

Made this tonight. Used pork tenderloin as that's what I defrosted for dinner. Made the sauce as per recipe (no ginger, husband's preference) which delivered, however next time I'll only use 1 tablespoon sriracha. Also stir fried some green beans and added and topped with thinly sliced green onions. Will definitely make again!

I made this for 2.  I dredged the chicken in flour as recommended and sautéed some onion before adding the chicken.  I made sure the chicken was half-cooked before adding the sauce.   I had to double it and it was not enough to simmer the chicken in.  I put a lid on it and put it on low to finish cooking.  Taste was good and I will make again.

The idea was great , but I got nervous about the amount of hot sauce.  My better judgement said, "that's too much."  Then I read a review that said otherwise so I put almost all of the 2 Tbl in.  So sorry I did.  Way too spicy.  I diluted a batch for my husband with some chicken broth.  Guess it was OK but he'd already had a bad day and wasn't talking much.

This is one of my favorite recipes now, it's very easy and doesn't take long to put together.  I added shredded carrot, 1 onion and a bag of frozen broccoli and doubled the ingredients for the sauce.  My husband loves it.

I agree with others that these are really tasty but not sticky. I usually mix in some corn starch to thicken the sauce. My husband loves this dish and requests it often.

This was a great sauce recipe. As far cooking the chicken goes, I tossed the pieces in corn starch and fried them. I also replaced the hot sauce with red pepper flakes.

I added onions and bell peppers to the dish. Unfortunately, the extra moisture made it almost impossible to get the sauce reduced. I got it to thicken up some. It was still really tasty anyway. Very easy to make. When I make it again, I think I will add a little more hot sauce since I like spicy food and the veggies really tame the heat.

Such a hit in my house! Doubled the sauce (but not the hot sauce). Used pork and sprinkled it with corn starch before cooking. Had to replace maple syrup for honey due to allergy. I make this at least once a month to raves!

This was tasty!  I dredged the chicken in flour prior to cooking, added onions, carrots and broccoli to chicken and sauce and served over brown rice. Filling dinner.

I changed the directions a bit. I used a saucepan instead of a skillet. Fried the garlic and added it at the last serving part. I used cornstarch instead of flour and fry it for 10-15 min. Added sesame seeds for a nice aroma and then added the sauce. When the pan is too hot with all the cooking, the sauce thickens but you have to turn of the pan immediately so it doesn’t over cook.

I took other readers advice; doubled the sauce adding 1 tbsp. Cornstarch and 1/4 cup water.   Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and coated with cornstarch.  Sauteed 2 red peppers and an onion, cut up in chunks, and a cup of snap peas.  Removed, then cooked the chicken until no longer pink, removed from pan.  While pan was still hot, I cooked the sauce, then added chicken and vegetables, simmering for a few minutes.  Served with Balsmati rice, was delicious!

Very good but a little spicy for me.  Less hot sauce next time--personal preference.  I mixed the sauce and let it get warm  and then added it onto the chicken.  I cut the chicken in nugget size and dipped in flour before browning. I will make again.

I am a vegetarian but my family isn’t so I doubled the sauce and divided It between the chicken and I made sautéed peppers onions. I then added fresh pineapple chunks and served it over Indian rice.  So delicious. My sauce did stick all I did was turned the temperature up.

I am a full time fire fighter and I made this for dinner.  the recipe was just about perfect however I did make a few changes. I followed many of the of the members suggestions and used flour on the chicken. several members had trouble getting the sauce to thicken in the pan. I got around this problem my building the sauce in a separate pan using corn starch to thicken the sauce. I like a lot of sauce so I used water in equal amounts to the soy sauce and then adjusted the sugar and other ingredients to taste. it helped with the saltiness.

I’ve tried making this twice. Once by the recipe, the next I didn’t do so much hot sauce and added more honey. Still, the hot sauce overpowered the dish.

Pretty good and easy! I agree with comments, needs to simmer with the sauce on high or will not thicken. Added onion and used ground ginger. Very good!

This was wonderful. I don't know why so many could not make it sticky, but mine was very sticky. I added paprika to two tablespoons of flour and coated the chicken before frying, it deepened the color.  I used Siracha sauce to make it spicy.  I will definitely make it again.  I will use only 1/8 cup of soy sauce.  It was a bit salty for the family.

My mate and I are on a "watch how much you eat" kind of diet so we eat a lot of salads. I'm always looking for low calorie chicken recipes. I made this chicken and put it in a salad of iceberg lettuce, chick peas, Mandarin oranges, radishes and sesame sticks. Scrumptious!!

I loved this recipe, it has the perfect amount of sweet and heat! I did replace the hot sauce with some Korean chili garlic paste and I used ground ginger instead of fresh...I also added a little corn starch to my mixture to make sure that the sauce thicken the way I like it. I served it with some Jasmine rice and steamed veggies....DELICIOUS!!!!

I made this and everyone loved it!  They thought it was better than our favorite Chinese place. I made everything the way it was written except the ginger. I didn’t have any on hand. I can’t wait to make it again with he ginger because I love it. I just used powder but I love it fresh.

I read some of the reviews  and listened to the changed they recommended.  And it turned out amazing. I used corn starch instead of flour to coat the chicken. I also used tin foil to cover the first batch of chicken that was cooked to keep warm.  I ended up steaming the broccoli. Mixed it all together and it was delicious.  Huge hit at home!

Had a good flavour. Followed other reviewers and covered my chicken with flour before putting it in the pan. I also added sesame seeds to the sauce. The sauce turned out sticky and sweet. I will make this one again.

The taste was fine.  However, I followed recipe as is, and the sauce remained liquid with no stickiness.  After following exactly, I tried to get it to be sticky with extended cooking, and then finally by adding cornstarch mix with water.  The cornstarch thickened the sauce, but still it was not sticky.  It was pleasant tasting, but I will continue to look for another recipe.

Delicious! Used other reviewers idea: 
"1. Dredging the chicken strips in flour before sauteing, which will help them brown better and help thicken the sauce. 2. Saute on med.-high heat instead of medium. The heat called for in the recipe is not enough to sear the chicken. 3. Simmer the sauce while I am preparing the chicken, then add to the chicken as called for. Because, it took much longer than 8-10 minutes to reduce the sauce, and the chicken dried out."

every time I make this recipe I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and then I coat with flour. on medium-high heat I sauteed up so it Browns nicely. I premix and usually double or triple the sauce because I make a lot of chicken and once your chickens browned you can pour the sauce over and let it simmer as it says, I promise you the sauce will thicken nicely! this recipe is always a hit at my house!

I have made this recipe twice. The the sauce thickened up perfectly. However I though it could use more honey as it was not as sweet as I would have liked. The second time I made this I added another Tbsp of honey and it was perfect. Great flavor, great for quick weeknight dinners.

I made a couple of extra batches of the sauce to freeze for even quicker meals.

Yes, changes! From reading several reviews, I made quite a few changes, and it was the best Asian type meal I've ever been able to make at home.  I pounded the chicken a bit to tenderize.  Cut into strips. I marinated for about 2 hours  in 1 tsp fresh ginger, 1 crushed garlic clove, and about 2 tsp soy.  Like others, I coated the chicken, but I used rice flour instead of corn starch. I cooked the chicken and set it aside. I cooked sliced onions, green peppers, and some celery, set aside, then I made the sauce.  About 2 tsp of rice starch added, plus 1/4 cup white wine and about 1 tbsp of white vinegar, and about 1/4 cup water. This made the sauce very tasty but not overly salty or overpowering.  Hubby doesn't like heat too much, so I left out the hot sauce, but put in about 1/2 tsp chili flakes which was just right for us. The sauce thickened nicely after about 5-6 min on medium high heat. Then I turned the heat down, added the chicken and veg back in to get hot, then served on basmati rice.  Absolutely delicious!  I also had steamed broccoli on the side for a bit more veg.

I did the same as others on here and coated the chicken strips in flour. It worked a treat. The family loved it. It's now a regular favourite of the kids when Dad is in his kitchen mode!!

This was awesome! It was quick and easy and didn't take a ton of ingredients, so I was able to whip it up on a week night. Even my picky 8 year  old had two helpings. The kids don't like it too spicy so I reduced the amount of hot sauce by a 1/4 - doubled the sauce, put only 1/2 tbsp of hot sauce (rooster) in, and did add a little cornstarch paste to help it thicken quickly. The chicken was tender and the sauce was not to sweet and not too spicy. I might triple the sauce next time because there really wasn't enough - and toss in some stir fry veggies to make a complete meal. I will be definitely be making this again!

This was too hot for us. Next time would add less hot sauce. It's good with broccoli, carrots, bell pepper and water chestnuts. Can put cashews on top.

So good!!!!!!! The flavor is amazing and putting the chicken in flour like everyone suggested worked like a charm! My sauce wasn’t too thick but it still covered all the pieces perfectly and tasted so good with some jasmine rice!

This is fabulous! I dredged in flour as others did, and I reduced the amount of hot sauce to a scant 1 Tablespoon as we do not like a lot of heat, feeling that the amount of heat 2 T. would create doesn't let the other flavors of the dish shine though. It was just spicy enough for us. I added some sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds just before serving over rice. I removed the chicken from the pan before adding the sauce and let the sauce reduce a few minutes, but it did not take very long and as it coated the chicken it got thicker. Wonderful flavor. Do not expect this to be very saucy. The chicken is coated with the sauce, but there was none for the rice but that was fine.

Wow this is tasty...I can't think of how I could better this as far as flavor goes.  I live alone and only used 2 chicken breasts but made the full sauce amount using sriracha.  I did throw in some thawed green beans to the sauce while it simmered and used flour in ziplock bag to coat chicken pieces. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmy!

I did a lot of tweaking this recipe to my family's liking. This is a great base recipe though. I quadrupled the sauce and used 5 very large chicken breasts. I used 2 extra tablespoons of brown sugar, cut the soy sauce in half because I made it before and it was way too salty for my family's taste. I used ground ginger, and instead of hot sauce I used Sriracha sauce and a teaspoon of hot pepper paste. I did as others suggested and floured the chicken pieces then fried them. I cooked the sauce until it was almost as thick as it should be then added the chicken pieces. It thickened up quickly and my chicken was not dry. Delicious recipe though! Will be making this often.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was WAY too spicy. Also, agree with other reviews that the sauce did not thicken up enough. The flavor would have been decent had the spice been dialed down, but even so I'm not sure I'll make this again. I think the chicken needs to be tossed in flour or something before browning, also I think dark meat might be a better choice so the chicken doesn't get so dry.

Amazing recipe! I used salmon instead of chicken because we eat mostly fish and 1 tablespoon on cayenne instead of the hot sauce then paired it with some brown rice and roasted veggies! Amazing, thanks so much for sharing! PS no problem getting mine thickened...maybe because our subbing the liquid hot sauce for a dried pepper flake.

I really like this recipe.. Its important to flour the chicken though and let it brown for a few beforehand.  I keep the sauce recipe intact, and although it doesn't look like its enough, its how its supposed to be.  It isn't supposed to be saucy, but rather sticky.. let the sauce cook on medium until it gets sticky, watch to make sure you burn it.. good dish with rice

I did the recipe "as-is" and have zero idea how it got such high reviews. My wife didn't eat hers. I ate mine simply because I didn't feel like making something else, and was starving. I also added some sesame oil, which at least made it palatable.

Super fast prep and cooking time. I made it in a cast iron skillet and added some lemon juice to balance out the sirracha! Did not use ginger because I didn't have any and I just cooked it on low to have the sauce thicken.  It was a hit!

Delicious with rice and broccoli! After reading reviews, mixed the sauce in a pot and cooked while getting the chicken ready. Also, I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. 
Sauteed the chicken, then added the sauce and let that simmer a minute while getting the rest of dinner ready.

I tasted the marinade before pouring it on top of the chicken.  I added more honey (approximately another tablespoon).  This is a great recipe to make right before you eat because the marinade doesn't have to sit on the chicken for a long time.  My family loved it!

Came out amazing! One of my favorite recipes.. make this often at my house.. I actually have to double the recipe because my family loves to eat. I cook it in a Wok and add broccoli, carrots, bean sprouts and scallions with no spicy sauce because I cannot tolerate spicy food at all.

I loved this...and so did my dog, who decided to help himself to what I had left over in the pan on the stove.  I made it as written but I did not have soy sauce on hand so I used coconut aminos instead (which I prefer over soy sauce anyway).  Excellent flavors!

Nice balance of flavors...you may find that the dish is salty enough with the soy sauce to omit the other calls for salt in the recipe.  TEENAGER APPROVED: My teenage daughter heartily loves this dish!!  

I served it over a bed of Jasmine Rice & Broccoli.

NOTE:  After reading that others failed to get the sauce to thicken as detailed in the recipe, I used a bit of Corn Starch & Water at the end of cooking, which works like a charm.

This is a delicious recipe, however, I think marinating it for at least a few hours would make the chicken more tender.  It was tougher than I am used to.  That is my only criticism as the flavors together are fantastic.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sautéed onion and red pepper strips  prior to cooking the chicken. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and dredged in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Once browned, I added the onion and red pepper along with the sauce (1 TBSP of sriracha sauce), covered the pan and reduced the heat to 3.  I served the chicken and vegetables over brown rice.  This dish was a enjoyed by my husband (who doesn't like spicy food) and I.

This was a tasty treat.  The only problem was I made the sauce and there wasn't enough to cover the chicken so I made another batch and poured it on and there still didn't seem to be enough to simmer so I ended up making 3 batches of sauce and it was so great!  My sauce never ended up thickening up as it simmered so I ended up taking out the chicken and adding some cornstarch mixed with cold water to the sauce.  Worked like a charm!

Everyone loved this and it disappeared quickly. Made a double batch of the sauce but only added half the hot sauce because my 8 year old doesn't like as much heat as the rest of the family. Served extra sauce over rice. Very yummy.

This was so easy and tasty too! I followed other reviewers' advice and first dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Once the chicken was browned, I removed it from the pan, added a little more olive oil, and threw in some broccoli and cauliflower florets. I took the veggies out when they were just crisp-tenderand and poured the sauce in the pan to thicken. After about 5 minutes, I added the chicken and veggies back to the pan and coated them with the sauce. Next time I may try skipping the dredging part and adding a little cornstarch and cold water to thicken it. Not much, just enough to coat everything well. There didn't seem to be enough sauce to go around once I added all that broccoli and cauliflower!

I added garlic salt and dried parsley to the flour before dredging. I used Sambal oelek as the hot sauce, and I served mine over garlic lime white rice sprinkled with fresh chopped chives from my garden. So delicious!

Read that it didn't stick to chicken very well. Made it, brought it to a boil in microwave, 700watt 4 minutes. Than added to browned chicken in pan. Also, made it a little hotter with extra hot sauce. Served with rice and steamed veggies. It was very good.

Great recipe. I dredge the chicken in corn starch before I pan fry it. It's crispy and everything then thickens nicely. I even make this as a weekend snack.

The chicken burns! It's so hot! Don't do the 2 table spoons! Not if you don't take spicy food well. 

I found the recipe very easy and I would make it again though without much hot sauce.

Another delicious meal from all recipes! Very little changes necessary but flouring the chicken was the ticket to having the sauce stick. I also cut back half as much on the hot sauce and had my family add at the table if they preferred...some of us don't like our food so hot! But we all loved it, very tasty!

Based on comments of there not being enough sauce I doubled it but only used 1 tablespoon of hot sauce (next time use 1/2 a tablespoon - it was a little too spicy for me). 

Cooked the sauce separately from the chicken then added everything together.  

Turned out really good!!  Severed over brown rice with broccoli.

Yes definitely will make again, best to use boneless thighs. I bought bone in this last time and I prefer the boneless by far!  Didn't have orange juice so used pineapple  juice this time.  Awesome sauce.  Grandson loved them and said to send his mom the recipe.  From a kid that has been super picky but is getting more adventurous  as he's now a teen.

I thought the chicken was very tasty and very easy to make. There wasn't any sauce for the rice so next time I would double the sauce next time to make it more "saucy".

Amazing!!! I cut the hot sauce in half because I have littles that don't like a lot of spice, it still had quite a kick. The sauce is soooooo tasty. I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces, and dredged in flour, then pan fried. Also added sliced onion, bell pepper, and broccoli. Served over rice. A massive hit with my family.

I'll make it again using my changes. There was just way too much soy sauce and that was all you could taste, so I used more hot sauce and brown sugar  with a bit more honey to cover the soy taste. :)

This is one of the few recipes that both of my children enjoy. I usually double the sauce, then serve over Jasmine rice and top with toasted sesame seeds. I have substituted chicken thighs for the chicken breasts when I haven't had the breasts on hand. On the side, I usually choose either broccolini or baby bok choy to accompany this meal. I have also thrown the vegetables right into the sauce and chicken as well instead of serving them on the side. Great weeknight meal.

I made this exactly as written except I substituted shrimp for the chicken and added snow peas. I served it over Jasmine rice, and garnished with some chopped pecans and diced green onions. My husband practically licked his plate clean. Definitely a keeper!!

My tolerance for spicy is very high so this wasn't spicy at all. I will add another 1-2 tablespoons of hot sauce next time. Also - I added the broccoli as advised in the footnotes. Delicious.

I used 2 tablespoons Sambal Olek for the hot sauce.  I then spent an hour trying to dial down the spiciness! Learn from my mistake, if you use this type of hot sauce, which is really a  chili paste, don't use 2 tablespoons!  Otherwise the flavor was great! I'll certainly make it again with less heat.

I dredged the chicken in flour as the reviews suggested. I only had ground ginger- not fresh so I used 1 teaspoon not 2 but it could've used a touch more. I only used 1 tbsp of hot sauce because my kids are young (5&7) but they definitely could've handled the 2 tbsp of hot sauce.  I also ran out of soy sauce so I substituted about half with teriyaki sauce.  I had no trouble with the sauce thickening and I used a non stick pan and it wasn't a mess. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they weren't dried out at all. Turned out well. My picky 5 year old loved it. Next time I will make more sauce and put some vegetables in with it. Wasn't enough sauce for more than the chicken.

I made the sauce to serve over leftover  rotisserie chicken. everyone loved it. I doubled it to have more to go over the rice, and I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to help it thicken.

The first time I made it was too hot for most of us so next time I cut the hot sauce by half and also added a bit more honey.  I also followed someone's suggestion and dredged the chicken in cornstarch before browning.  Everyone loves it this way.

I just made this and it is SO GOOD!! Very simple to make!  My sauce didn't thicken up either so I added a little bit of corn starch. Also instead of adding hot sauce I just added cayenne pepper. DELICIOUS!

I meant to take a pic of this but it got eaten before I had the chance. If you don't like things too salty just add more sugar but this was a huge hit here. Will definitely be making this again.

I made the recipe as written for my son and made a diet version for me in which I used 1TBSP truvia in place of the sugar and the honey.  My son loved his version and my modified version was really good.  I will definitely make this one again.

Absolutely LOVE this dish but made a few minor changes worth mentioning....After waiting for the sauce to thicken it seemed likely that the chicken would end up over-cooked so, I removed it from the sauce, set it aside in a bowl.  I added about 1-2 teaspoons of flour to the sauce (I didn't measure) and stirred over low heat with a spoon, making sure all lumps were out. The consistency of the sauce was perfect! In the meantime, I fried red and yellow bell peppers in a separate pan and added them to the sauce when I transferred the chicken back. The peppers remained crisp and the flavor of the sauce did not mask the flavor of the peppers.  Served with white sticky rice...YUMMY!

I followed the instructions that Rebecca used. I also added a bit of water to the pan to make sure the chicken didn't dry out. Turned out perfect. For the hot sauce I used siracha and was the perfect amount of spice even for kids. Little ones had a glass of milk nearby just incase though. In case you did not see Rebecca's review the changes would be: 
1) Putting the chicken in flour before putting in pan.
2) Heating up the sauce in a pot before pouring over the chicken.
3)  Use medium high heat instead of medium. You can turn it down to medium once the sauce is in the pan with the chicken.
I served it on top of rice with brussel sprouts. Perfect dinner with leftovers for lunch at work tomorrow!

I made this dish last night, it was a big hit! Really yummy. I definitely recommend flouring the chicken. I also sautéed chopped green & red bell peppers and snow peas that I added to the dish when I added the sauce back in. I also doubled the sauce because I was planning on serving it over rice (we like saucy rice) I thickened the sauce at the end by adding a tiny bit of flour slurry. I also garnished the meal with some sesame seeds at the end. Next time Im going to try adding some chopped cashews! Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

The flavor of this sauce is magnificent!  I followed other reviewers advice and dredged the chicken in flour first. I had 3 decent sized chicken breasts that I cut into bite sized chunks. I think I may have had too much chicken for the recipe because the sauce disappeared immediately when I added it to the chicken. There was no way to let it simmer as it was no longer liquid at all. It was definitely sticky though. I quickly mixed up a second batch of sauce and added it to the chicken.  The chicken was very sticky for sure. There was no problem with getting the sauce to reduce. Actually just the opposite.  I'm not sure what I did differently than the other reviewers who had a hard time getting it to thicken up. There was no extra sauce for the rice, but that was fine. It tasted delicious! Very sticky, very sweet, very spicy! Just perfect! Thank you for the recipe.

OMG so good. My husband loved it, his only complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce. I coated the chicken in seasoned flour. I also cooked it in the wok. Definitely something I will cook again.

Just ok.  I would cut the soy sauce in half if making it again - it was too salty.   However, there are other chicken stir fry recipes on the site I  like a LOT better.

Very good recipe, the only problem would be the sauce is not very sticky. But that is an easy fix. I substituted the honey for maple syrup and it seemed to help a lot!

Great flavor! Whole family liked it, even the picky ones. I omitted the hot sauce, since my youngest can't "take the heat" and doubled the sauce, since we like our dishes saucy. Served it over fried rice.

Fast and tasty. I did not have hot sauce, so I just added more garlic and cayenne pepper and covered the bites in flour as recommended by others. Tasted good, but I missed something, not sure, what it was. I thought salt, but that is not it. Probably I will find out next time :)

The sauce didn't thicken up that much.  I ended up adding more homey and a bit of flour.  I might add more honey to start with next time and some red pepper flakes for a little more heat and flavor.

This was a delicious meal! I took others' advice and dredged the chicken pieces in flour before searing it. I also sauteed onions, brocolli and red pepper ahead of time and then added it back in with the sauce and chicken. I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was perfect if you dredge the chicken in flour like so many other reviews suggested.  I used Sriracha sauce which added the right amount of heat.  Overall, excellent recipe, easy to prepare and a keeper in this family.

This is a fantastic recipe. Some people wrote that they couldn't get the sauce to thicken, I simply used a bit of cornstarch and water that did the trick.  Dredging in chickpea flour with a little more peanut oil than recommended 1 tablespoon also kept chicken strips moist. Agree that Sriracha sauce makes the dish a taste sensation. Other than that made it as described, so simple and yet exotic. I Love Allrecipes but I don't often take the time to review, however, this was so good I made an exception.  5 stars for sure.

I followed the flour dusting for the chicken. Used olive oil and high setting on the stove.  I waited for the oil to get hot then threw in the Chicken.  Nice crispy coated in 10 minutes.  I added pineapple chunks and red orange and yellow baby peppers. Start the sauce in another pan. When the sauce came to a boil pored it over the chicken,Peppers and pineapple. I had no issues in the sauce thickening. Pineapple  added a sweet kick that stopped it from being dry.  Best of all what's his face loved it.

This was awesome! loved it , no more buying the frozen oriental  chicken dishes. For the chili sauce I used Sambal Oelek which was to hot & spicy. So next time I will cut that to 1 TBL of Sambal Oelek  & 1 TBL Hoisin less hot more sweet. As so many of the reviews say breading the chicken made it better. I did not use flour instead Cornstarch. Going for the breading like frying Tofu. This was very good & I think it would also be good with beef as well as chicken.

I have made this a few times already.  The flavors are really good...but, like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the sauce not thickening.  I add some cornstarch as its simmering and that seemed to help.  Also, I use reduced-sodium Soy sauce so that its not so overpowering.   Overall its a good recipe, just need your own tweaks to it

Just OK - I had to thicken the sauce with cornstarch and water mixture.  That was after I coated the chicken in flour.  We all ate it, but no one was raving about it.  I thought the kids would like it more than they did.

Thought I'd give this recipe a try today, it turned out to be really good. The only thing I would say a speaker for with the salt because of the soy sauce. I did tweak it a little bit to my liking by adding a little bit more honey and ginger.

- Very Salty ... Try to use the soy sauce with no or less sodium !!
- Actually it is 2 serves not 4 specially with chicken amount!

As others have stated, the sauce didn't thicken but that didn't take away from the flavor. It could've been a Little sweeter. It didn't look quite like the picture either. Maybe my 4-chicken breasts were too big as well as I had to double the amount of sauce. 
Other substitutions that I made:
- uses liquid aminos rather than soy sauce to reduce salt content
- marinated the chicken strips in the sauce as well prior to browning (may explain to different look)
-used powdered ginger and garlic

I made this at the end of last week and can honestly say after having a good Chinese takeaway tonight, I'd much rather have this! I took on board other people's experiences and floured the chicken and also added joulien sweet peppers which I sauteed first along with a bit of extra soy and honey. Is now officially a firm family favourite, thanks! ??

I was very disappointed in this recipe after all the rave reviews.  This is the 1st recipe on this site that I really didn't like. It was not sweet and not sticky and had a overwhelming taste of soy sauce, Yuk.Followed recipe but will not make again.  Honey Glazed chicken from this site is similar and tastes better.

Followed some other suggestions and shook the chicken pieces in flour before browning it, and then I used sriracha as the hot sauce as suggested. I steamed some broccoli and added it to the mix and it was perfect over rice!

Made this the other night and the chicken turned out perfect! Only downside is it was a little spicy and very soysauce-y, so to combat that I would maybe add a touch more honey, one tbsp less of hotsauce, and 1/8 cup of soysauce instead of 1/4.

Excellent recipe! I did what the others suggested and dredged the chicken in flower. I added a half tsp. of corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up and simmered it while searing the chicken. I even added a fist full of fresh snap peas to the sauce after it was heated through. I was very happy with the results! The sauce was thick, the chicken was sticky and very spicy! I agree with the other reviews that using Sriracha is key. If you don't love spicy food, I would cut the Sriracha portion in half. Will definitely make again!

WAY too spicy.  My kids and I can handle spicy, but this recipe is way to spicy (if you're using Asian hot sauce).  I put in a quarter of what the recipe calls for, and it was still inedible for my kids.  It was good for me but gave me a runny nose.  Other adjustments - I sauteed the garlic and ginger before adding the other wet ingredients.  I also used flour to thicken the sauce.  I also used some chicken broth.  Flavour was fine except for the spiciness.

Really good and easy to cook, although, before I started cooking it, I read some of the reviews and I followed some of the suggestions other people did. I cooked the chicken and the sauce separately and also I add some sweet peppers, onion and mushrooms.

Very good dish. I found the ginger taste a bit strong, but that's a matter of personal taste. I cut down on the ginger and upped the garlic a bit and it's great. I did have the problem that a lot of others have had with the sauce not thickening. Next time I'll try adding a thickener and see how it goes.

This was really delicious!  I doubled the sauce recipe because the chicken breasts I used were unusually large plus I like a bit of sauce!  I simmered the sauce separately while preparing the chicken (per one reviewer's recommendation).  I also used Sriracha hot chili sauce (per one reviewer's recommendation) as the hot sauce.  I cut the chicken into chunks (again, they were unusually large and strips would have been too big),  coated with s/p and flour.  Sautéed at medium-high heat and when the chicken was about done I pour the simmered sauce over the chicken.  The sauce reduced nicely, had an excellent flavor though was a touch too spicy for my taste.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I will only use 3 Tbs Sriracha instead of the doubled 4 Tbs.  Served over rice with steamed broccoli.  Perfect!!!!

I made it with the same suggestion others have made by adding flour to the chicken and cooking the sauce separately while the chicken was cooking. I was a little concerned about the amount of hot sauce but it was perfect. Amazing flavors. My only wish was I had made rice to go with it. This will be a go to recipe.

I made this dish, but I had to teak it a little. Since I didn't have honey on hand, I substituted Karo syrup. It worked! Instead of putting it on simmer after I pour the sauce over my chicken, I cranked up the heat for the last 7-8 min to reduce the liquid in the pan and allow the sauce thicken. Excellent, quick, and easy dish!

Quick & easy recipe!  I did add a small amount of corn starch to the sauce to help thicken it and I  a few generous shakes of red pepper flakes. Served over jasmine rice. Husband said it reminded him of Kung Pao Chicken ??

Good recipe for Saturdays & Sundays when relaxing with family or friends.  It's different enough to wake-up taste buds.

Definitely add flour to coat chicken pre-browning, then add in sautéed onions and red peppers to sauce. I also reduced the soy sauce to a 1/5th cup to minimize salt intake.

This was delicious and so easy to make. My only adjustments was doubling the sauce and adding a half a cup of water to the sauce

I didn't like this recipe. The sauce was way too runny, and so I tried adding corn starch which made it better, but they soy sauce drowned everything else out and was WAY too salty to eat (and I used low sodium soy.) So, meh.

Awesome is right!! Sweet & Spicy! I added a little bit (maybe 1tsp) of Nellie & Joes Key West Lime Juice to the sauce mixture, used ground ginger instead of fresh & halved the hot sauce (hoping it wouldn't be too spicy for my 2 yr old). I also used chicken thighs cut into "strips", then coated w flour using a bag & browned in batches. I sautéed an onion before adding the chicken & sauce together. AWE-some!!

This is pretty much a spicy version of teriyaki chicken. I made no alterations except added 1/2 TBS cornstarch to the sauce after it didn't thicken at all at cooking. That helped, but it wasn't the sticky glaze I had anticipated. I served on top of coconut rice which was an excellent companion. Four stars because the flavor is good, just not what I was expecting.

Made exactly according to instructions, except followed others ideas regarding flouring chicken and browning it first.   Made the sauce in the morning & put in fridge.  Then just the work of a few minutes to cut chicken into bite size pieces, flour, fry and then add sauce for 10 minutes.  Great

I flowred the chicken and cooked the sauce first. A couple things I learned while cooking it was to add about have a cup of water slowly to the chicken and  sauce while it's cooking. I also used rosemary and tarragon at the end and mixed it in

This is my new favorite dish. I made it the first time with some of my wife's advice to lightly flour the chicken with some pepper. From there I made a few other changes and even added peanut butter. It's very yummy.

The flavor is great but for some reason my chicken was tough and we didn't want to eat it.  So instead of throwing it out I used our antique meat grinder and ground it all up, sauce and all. Then mixed it with some miracle whip making a sandwich spread out of it.  Boy was that good.  so good I had to make it again just so I could grind it into a sandwich spread.  It is also good on ritz crackers

The flavor was really great, and this dish is very easy to make, but it turned out to be extremely salty.  I would suggest not putting salt on the chicken, and using low sodium soy sauce.  I also will not put salt in the rice next time I make this.  It was very good otherwise, and with those changes, I think we will enjoy it more next time.

I made this for dinner last night and it's one of the few recipes I've ever made that I just couldn't bring myself to eat the leftovers.  I didn't like the way the sauce smelled as it cooked which made it difficult for me to enjoy the finished meal.

Super easy to make and delicious.  Used Sriracha as opposed to just straight hot sauce which added quite the kick to the dish.  Added sautéed veggies (broccoli, carrots, peppers, mushrooms) in with the chicken and doubled up the sauce. Had to add corn starch to thicken up the sauce.  Put it over rice and wound up with a delicious dinner! : )

This was a tremendous success! Flavorful and easy. I did triple the sauce ingredients because I wanted to make sure it wasn't dry. Like other readers I dredged my chicken in flour before sauteing along with some zucchini cubes. Pour the sauce over everything about 5 minutes before serving and it should reduce to a nice glaze. It turned out sweet, spicy & sticky.  Definitely a keeper.

Did make some changes. Added onions, green bell pepper and mushrooms. Doubled the sauce which gave a nice amount of coverage. Think I will cut back on the hot sauce next time since I am such a wimp. Other than that it was great!

Based on reviews, I was expecting something really, really good.  As is, I only give this 3 stars because the soy sauce completely overpowers the flavor; and I really like soy sauce!  I will make again, but next time I will use low sodium soy sauce and see if that helps!

I really loved the flavor of the sauce.  My only change was to add a few drops of sesame oil to the sauce for flavor and used siracha as the hot sauce.  I did mix equal parts of corn starch and flour to dust the chicken with prior to frying which thickened the sauce perfectly.  I will definitely make again.

I first sautéed chopped onion & garlic then removed from the pan.  I followed others recommendations & floured the chicken then browned it. I also added chopped asparagus & broccoli florets. I used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular and red peppers flakes instead of hot sauce. The sauce never thickened for me but that was okay; it still was tasty. I served over brown rice. My husband & I both really liked the flavor.

Delish!!!  Loved it!  I did what others suggested and put some flour and the salt/pepper in a food storage bag, cubed the chicken small.  I used Crisco tot fry them up 1/2 bat at a time.  I tripled the sauce and added some fresh Orange peel.  Added steamed veggies and served with Basmati rice!  Basmati rice is superb!  Not starchy.  It came out nice and sticky!

My husband, who often doesn't like to try new things, said "this is a keeper!". I added a bit more brown sugar as my soya sauce was quite salty plus I added a bit of water to the sauce to make it go farther. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Great flavour.

I made this for dinner tonight and halved the hot sauce.  As others have noted, the sauce didn't thicken up, but threw the chicken on a plate of butter lettuce and used the sauce as dressing.  Very good!

The sauce does not thicken well, and it takes a WHOLE  LOT LONGER than 1 minute per side at medium heat to brown the chicken.

Delicious.  I didn't get the thick sauce that the recipe says will happen.  I roasted some carrots and made cauliflower rice to go with it.  Not a fan of cauliflower but wanted to be healthier, the sauce covers a multitude of sins, so it worked perfect!!!  I may try a little cornstarch slurry with some of the soy sauce next time, but I will definitely make it again.  Very easy and tasty.

I think I will reduce the ginger called for in the recipe, other than that it was good! Also, I added about two tablespoons flour to the sauce and chicken mixture to thicken it up.

Follow others suggestions by adding flour to the chicken and simmering the sauce while you start the chicken. Great taste and nice heat! Will make again.

It was excellent!  Followed directions but reduced the amount of hot sauce by 1/2 just because my significant other minds the heat.  Doubled the marinade just to make sure we had enough and served over rice...Perfect!   2nd time added steamed broccoli and it only got better.

Everyone, even my pickiest liked it.  Spicy!   I doubled the sauce because I like the option to add more sauce when serving over rice.  But, it  wasn't necessary as I ended up with a lot...will stick to the recipe next time.

I made this for the first time today, and it looked as amazing as it tasted.   I just tweaked a few minor things.  I used ground ginger and jarred minced garlic in place of fresh.  Also increased the brown sugar by 1 tablespoon.  Definitely use sriracha sauce as the hot sauce.  Sriracha is pretty spicy, and the heat was a little too intense for even us, and we love spicy.  Next time I'll reduce the sriracha by a third.  I wanted to make sure the chicken had plenty of flavor, so I seasoned the chunks with a generous amount of salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I coated the chicken in 3 tablespoons of corn starch and mixed, letting the corn starch mixture become like a batter.  I let it sit for 15 minutes or so, while I prepared my side dishes.  When I was ready to cook the chicken, I took the advice of other reviewers and turned the heat to medium-high.  It gave the chicken a good sear, and the sauce thickened and was a beautiful color.  I was so proud of this gorgeous, wonderful-tasting dish!  Give it a try.  I know I'll be making it again!

This dish had a slight sweetness to it and was very spicy. The sauce was not sticky and not thick at all. Still, it was really good served on a bed of white rice. I added water chestnuts and will add broccoli next time.

W will like it better the next time I make it. I didn't  see the tip about the flouring the chicken first.  We like spicy, so I used extra hot sauce. I know our spice level and the hot sauce I used. I'll also remember the broccoli!

This recipe sounded great. I agree with others though, it was waaay too salty and had too strong of a soy sauce taste. Maybe need to add some chicken broth to the sauce to help it out?

I made this with just 2 chicken breasts that I cubed, seasoned, and floured. I thought it was the right amount of sauce for 2 breasts and it thickened up nicely in about 7 minutes. I followed the sauce recipe exactly and it was really good. 2 tsp of fresh ginger is a lot for that amount of liquid but I love ginger and it was great. Added chopped, roasted almonds to top. Would be great with some vegetables , too.

We loved this!!  I coated the chicken in flour as others suggested. Also, instead of using a regular hot sauce I used an Asian chili garlic hot sauce.  My husband and I both thought this turned out better than take out.  We added broccoli in step 3 and covered the pan for a few minutes to steam it a little. Yum!

Very easy to make!  Had the combination of spicy and sweet.  But I would cut back the amount of soy sauce a bit, as it was a little overwhelming.  Plus, the sauce did not thicken as it was supposed to.  Had to spoon it over the chicken, which worked.  Will try making it again, with a few changes!

This was amazing. I doubled the entire recipe except for the hot sauce which I left as is. It needed longer than 8 minutes to caramelize, probably because I doubled. I used Tamari soy sauce, watered down a bit because it is very strong. My kids loved the spicy kick, this was much more successful with the kids than other similar recipes I have tried.

This was tasty, but though I followed other reviewers' suggestions to double the sauce and dredge the chicken in flour, there still wasn't enough sauce and it sort of clumped together on the chicken (it was actually TOO sticky).  Still tasted good but wasn't visually appealing.  We're wimps about spice so I used a few shakes of crushed pepper instead of hot sauce.  Served over rice with sauteed veggies on the side.  I'll definitely try this again and dredge the meat more lightly.

Very good but I too did as other reviewers and lightly dredged cubed chicken in flour, garlic, salt & pepper. I also added red pepper flakes but I like it spicy!  Will definitely make it again.sweet, sticky and yummy! Served with rice and broccoli.

I did see all the other reviews about it not being thick enough, so I shake the chicken up in a bag with 2 TBSP of corn starch, and it's perfect. I also add some fresh broccoli about half way through cooking. So easy, so delicious!

I followed the recipe and wasn't too impressed. It wasn't sticky and I tried over rice. Even thought of throwing in some pineapple but didn't. Not sure what but something needs to be reworked in this recipe and I'm going to give it a try.

Great recipe although we like our food a little spicier.  I added more Frank's when reheating the leftovers and that added the extra kick.

I made this hoping to make my boys happy and they loved it!!! I also covered the chicken in flour and had no problem with it thickening up. We love spicy foods so I added a little more of my own ground hot pepper mixture.  The only negative comment from anyone was that there wasn't enough and I needed to make more!!! This was definitely a hit in my home and will make over and over.

Really good. my daughter hated. Still, I can't wait to eat again. I cut back on the ginger and hot sauce. Still had plenty of kick!

Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces and add some vegetables. Which will make my daughter throw up! 

This one is a winner.

Sorry, but this just didn't work on many levels.  I added some red and orange peppers at the end to add some crunch while I was waiting for the sauce to thicken up.  But that never happened.  In the end, the soy sauce flavor was overwhelming and it was way too salty.

We loved this however I did some alterations. One person said all she could taste was soy sauce, so I added 2 tbsp. ketchup and that rounded out the flavor of the soy. I also sautéed broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, pea pods and chopped green onion along with the sliced chicken. Also, dredged the chicken in flour first---it was wonderful, this is a real keeper!

Made mine super spicy and followed the recipe exactly as listed. I didnt have any problems with my sauce thickening. I did dredge my chicken strips in flour before i laid them in the pan so they could brown better. Didnt have any sesame seeds to sprinkle on top but I am sure that would have topped my dish right off.

I made this just as written, added a little homemade chili sauce. Do let the sauce bubble around the sautéed chicken to thicken it enough to be a sticky glaze.   We loved it!

was very tasty.  I do think I'd reduce the soy sauce to 2 T., because it was a bit too salty, even with reduced sodium soy sauce.   will be adding to my routine.

Absolutely amazing! It is our new favorite!!! What a wonderful flavor, and so easy to make. I was surprised Thought it would take awhile, but it was very quick. I used two Big cloves of garlic and wow! Highly recommend this recipe! It would go well with anything. We had it with rice and green beans. Next will be broccoli.

Delicious! Duplicates that take-out flavor. 
I made a total, one wok meal out of it by cooking broccoli, mushrooms, onions and some orange peel strips - sort of orange beef from chicken. I added some grated orange peel to the sauce, and slivered strips from onion tops. And a few sesame seeds, as I think the main picture shows. My mistake was to cook the vegetables in the sauce while it was thickening - they got a bit too soft. Next time, the veggies will be stir fried separately, and all combined at the end. I thought 2 tablespoons of hot sauce was too much, but the heat blended in nicely during the simmering process. Great recipe!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  Sometimes I make it with skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead of the breast.  I think I like it even better with the moist and flavorful thigh meat.  But it's delicious either way.  I serve it with rice and either a nice green salad or some roasted veggies.

The only changes, I added sliced carrots, broccoli stems, and onions strips. Also use bite size chicken. It was really easy and quick.  To me this is a good filling stand alone dish.

The changes I made were 1.5 tlb of hot sauce instead of 2. I coated the chicken in cornflour and cooked the chicken  on a high heat with rapeseed oil and put it to one side.  I added the sauce to  a really hot pan for a minute before I put the chicken back in and it thicken really quickly so I added a little water and I also added water chestnuts.  It was absolutely delicious and my husband has asked for it again in the week. The chicken was so soft and tender. Just like from the Chinese  !! Lovely

OK, I decided to make a few changes to the sauce/recipe, and give it another try.

First, I omitted the honey and double the brown sugar. (Had virtually no effect on the overall taste of the sauce).

Second, for this application, I doubled the sauce recipe but only added 3 tablespoons of hot sauce.

Third, I cubed the chicken. Slicing it thinly makes it really easy to turn to shoe leather if you're not careful. Cubing makes browning it a LOT more forgiving.

Fourth, I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 2 hours. 

Fifth, I mixed some cornstarch in with the remaining sauce before I added it to the cooking chicken. 

Last, I added a nice big handful of dry roasted peanuts. 

I'll be darned if this wasn't a really tasty "almost" Kung Pao Chicken.

Read the recipe and the comments.  So I also coated the chicken in flour, used Sriracha sauce for the spicy, cooked/reduced the sticky sauce on the side until it thickened, and added broccoli.  I served it on a bed of long grain rice and slivered almonds on top.  Delicious!  Next time I'm adding pineapple chunks.

Yes, will make again!
Sauce does have a kick. I mixed the sauce in a pan to reduce it before pouring over chicken. I reduced soy sauce to 1/8 cup due to salt and added pineapple juice for the remainder of the liquid. I did bread the chicken with flour before stir frying.  Added and sauted onion and pepper wedges the last couple minutes with the chicken, before pouring the sauce in. Excellent, was sweet,  sticky and spicy!  Served with fried rice and broccoli.

SO EASY !!  And our new go to, nothing planned for dinner recipe...this is WONDERFULLY tasty.  I had siracha on hand instead of hot sauce and so we decreased the amount  to 1 Tbls.  Also thickened slightly at very end as we were too impatient to wait for reduction, it smelled so yummy 

Thank you for sharing!.

I was excited to make this my 17 yr old son is very picky and this sounded like it could be a keeper. 
Not. I followed the recipe EXACTLY - the sauce didn't thicken and it tasted like 100% soy. So salty and just bad. I removed the chicken at one point to give the sauce a chance to thicken without drying out the chicken but didn't hsppen. Instead of throwing it all out( kosher meat is very pricey )
I doctored it up with vinegar, more sugar and hot sauce. So it was OK but I could never replicate that which I did and why bother? I'll just look for another revipe

This was really good!  Like chicken wings without the bones.  I didn't think the sauce was going to thicken so I kept on going with a fairly high heat and all of a sudden it did.

This was such a great one dish meal! I did dredge in flour (great tip) and added broccoli, matchstick carrots, green onions and snap peas. I added extra Sriracha, we like it hot! I will double the sauce next time also. Like others, my husband was disappointed there were no leftovers:-)  

I can hardly wait to do this for guests, as sure winner!

Very good!  I made one change and that was to cut back on the amount of hot sauce, for dietary preference.  All in all a very good recipe!  Will be making again!

Floured the chicken, browned in pan with oil then added sauce. We don't like spicy so only added a dash of hot sauce. Used one tsp fresh ginger, everything else as in recipe.  It was sticky good. Next time think I'll double the sauce. Everyone loved it, will definitely make again!

Very taste!  I only made 1 change to the recipe.  I kicked the heat up to medium-high while sautéing the chicken and after the sauce was added.  The sauce only took 8-10 minutes to thicken and become beautifully sticky cooking at medium-high.  Chicken did not dry out or become chewy.  I will definitely make again.

Great flavor and easy peasy! I did bring to a boil the sauce first separately then added to almost cooked chicken (cut into 1 inch cubes and dredged in flour via ziploc bag). Sticky, sweet, hot...and I doubled sauce no problem, maintained its goo and flavor!

The spices are just right, but after reading 10 years of reviews there seemed to be timing problems. So...I cooked the chicken and veggies separately. ( Two chicken breasts and about the same volume of broccoli, mini carrots, and onion). Stir fried both. Sauce done separately but instead of doubling which I felt would have been too much soya sauce I thickened with 2 tsp corn starch then thinned with chicken stock to about double sauce. Then combined and reheated. Great recipe. Sriracha sauce definitely a plus. Thanks to the author and all who added their comments and made this recipe work the first time for me.

Great recipe!! Lost track of ingredients for sauce vs. how much chicken but started with the basic recipe and winged it till a great dish was enjoyed by all. Like others I to dredged the chicken lightly in flour then into the pan til light brown on both sides.... maybe a minute or so on each side. Only thing I'll do different next time is double double the the sauce sauce.

For those of you having problems getting the sauce to thicken and be sticky. Just add 2 heaping teaspoons of corn startch to a glass with a bit of water , stir it up and pour it into the sauce and chicken and stir it around. This works perfect amd is awesome.

This is a great quick recipe.  I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews before making it so, I followed the recipe as stated. My sauce didn't thicken and the chicken was already cooked so we ate it with the thin sauce. We really liked the flavor and I served it over rice with a salad.  A couple of suggestions... I will dredge the chicken in flour so the sauce thickens and I will not salt the chicken pieces since there is a good amount of sauce sauce.  I will also add veggies next time. This one is a keeper!

I took rebecca's advice (currently she's got the top positive review - and some great advice) and dredged the chicken in flour. It did become sticky and was very tasty. It was a little too hot for my wife but I thought it was terrific. Good recipe with that change.

I haven't made it yet but it sounds yummy, that's why I gave it a 5.  I watched the video and after reading the sauce ingredients there is no way the sauce will thicken.  I would maybe add a Tablespoon or two of cornstarch. Can't wait to try it!

liked this recipe. a bit too sweet for hubby - but the spice was great. I used Vietnam chili-garlic paste and doubled the sauce; i coated the chicken with cornstarch. the sauce didn't thicken as much as i like - next time i will thicken it up with a cornstarch/water mix.  i blanched sliced carrots and broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes. then submerged in ice-water to stop the cooking.
I drained the vegs while  I cooked the chicken in a TBL or so of toasted sesame oil and removed it from the pan when finished.
i sauteed green onions, garlic, sweet onion   and mushrooms before adding the  cooked chicken back to the pan. then i added in a handful of peas. Next i added the sauce in and cooked down for a few minutes on medium high heat until bubbling  and thicker than what i started with.  
Served over white rice.

Pretty good chicken, I would suggest low sodium soy sauce but that's the only change

Coated chicken w/flour before cooking. Didn't add salt, only black pepper to chicken. Sauce came out thick

I did make a few changes.  Cut the chicken into bite size pieces, flour and  pepper them before cooking.  Also salt  is not necessary as the soy sauce has lots of sodium. I did not have fresh ingredients on hand so I sub ground ginger and garlic powder which came out just fine.  I used Sriracha hot sauce.  I have made this many times and will continue to do so! :)

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because as written it doesn't work.......I omitted the hot sauce as it does not lend to the Asian flavors already prominent in the recipe, using 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes instead. I also added one heaping teaspoon corn starch to the sauce to thicken it as it heated. Otherwise this is a good basic recipe for a nicely flavored chicken dish, add some stir fry vegies and the changes above and it is a great recipe.

Great recipe! I cubed my chicken and dredged in flour before cooking. Make sure not to over crowd your pan so your chicken pieces will brown. I like the bite of fresh ginger and garlic. Added broccoli florets and served over rice.

Great recipe! I didn't have ginger, so I used powdered ginger and used a bit less soy sauce. Will definitely  triple the sauce recipe next time. I also did as other suggested and added some flour to my chicken so the sauce thickened nicely. My kids loved it and they are quite picky!

An enormous hit. My wife thought it was a little too spicy for her, but can easily make an adjustment the next time. I made twice the sauce recipe and thickened it with 1/8 cup of corn starch and water. Also added broccoli.  Really delicious.

Very delicious recipe!  Only thing is that I didn't have fresh ginger on hand, so used ground ginger instead.  I'm sure it affected the intended flavor, but was delicious nonetheless.  Will definitely make again.

What a great recipe!  I used 2 lbs. of chicken tenders and doubled the sauce.  (Next time I will triple the sauce.) Used 2 tsp of sriracha instead of how sauce and felt it was a little hot for my family so will use less next time.  Dredged chicken in cornstarch and added onion and bell pepper per other reviews.  Will definitely make again and again.  (Might add broccoli next time.)

I have made this recipe twice, and it has turned out very well both times.  My experience would suggest that the recipe is quite forgiving, I barely made the effort to measure the ingredients the second time around, and it still turned out great.  As with some other reviewers, I did add a teaspoon (give or take) of cornstarch dissolved in some water to thicken the sauce.  A great quick and easy option using ingredients I generally have on hand!

Absolutely lovely flavours! I found 2 Tablespoons of hot sauce to be far too spicy so I used 3-4 dashes of franks hot sauce, it adds a subtle smoke and spicy taste very complimentary to the sweetness of the honey and the sugar. After the chicken turned golden brown I poured in the sauce which was indeed far too runny so I made a slurry from 1 tablespoon flour to 1 tablespoon water and incorporated it into the pan to thicken the sauce which worked just great. Thank you for sharing! xoxo

Of course it didn't turn out exactly how the picture has it look, but it was still very delicious. It had just enough spice combined in it to make it savory, but the spice wasn't overpowering at all. I would make this dish again.

This is my go-to chicken recipe. It never fails and it's always a hit. I usually double the sauce since I like to drizzle it on white rice. Definitely thicken the sauce up in a separate pot. 
My tip: After combining the sauce and chicken, toss in some peanuts to give it a nice crunch. Cashews and regular peanuts work well.

Delicious. Sauteed one red bell pepper and one onion, removed from pan and set aside. Crisped and browned dredged chicken breast and set aside. Made sauce exactly as written, with my hot sauce being sriracha. After a few minutes, added vegetables and chicken,  gently folded in & tossed. Served over white rice and garnished with peanuts & scallions. I had no problem with my sauce being thin. Fantastic. One could also easily change out meats, vegetables or make completely vegetarian.  Thank you for the recipe, it's a special one.

It was really good but I recommend adding water to the sauce to stop the overwhelming flavor of saltiness from the soy sauce. Also add flour to the sauce so that it can thicken.

I only used 2 chicken breasts in this recipe due to it only being my husband and myself but kept the original amount for the sauce. I also added broccoli and some yellow peppers then served over rice. This was a quick AND delicious meal that both of us enjoyed. It definitely had a little bite to it. Next time I am going to add jalepeno.  Great stir-fry sauce! YUMMY!

I doubled the sauce because I like to have some to put on my rice or potatoes. I used with boneless pork chops. It was amazing.

Made it but added snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and onions. Flavor was great and everything was good however adding the vegetables added water so it didn't get sticky. Next time I may steam the veggies and add them after the sauce thickens enough to make it sticky.

I will definitely make again. The video was a great help. I'm going to double the sauce because I'm a "dipper". I will also use low-sodium soy sauce or cut out the salt, it was a bit salty for me. Husband loved it the way it was!!!

This was pretty good.  Doubled sauce to have enough for rice.  Only used 1/2 tsp hot sauce and added some cornstarch to thicken up sauce.  Didn't have fresh ginger so I added 2 tsp ground ginger powder to the doubled recipe.

Was very good, but it didn't thicken at first for me. I added a little bit of flower toward the end when it was in the pot almost done and it thickened right up, just like general toes chicken sauce

I  enjoyed the dish as well as my spouse.  I  did dredge the chicken tenders, I  used those in place of breasts,  and that made the sauce thicken better. At the end I added steamed broccoli and served it over rice.  Quick meal and very tasty.

It doesn't taste like it does at the Chinese restaurant. I've made this twice. This time I cut back on the soy sauce and the ginger.  It was much better that way - still spicy but not over the top.

The dish is wonderful.  For me  it was a little to spicy, but that's an easy fix.  And I will be making it for guests next week and I'm sure it will be a big hit.

We liked it and I will make it again.  I doubled the sauce but next time I won't double the Sriracha sauce. .  We like hot but that was a little much and I think I will add sautéed onions next time.

My husband loved this!  I personally don't like things very spicy, so next time I think I'll just use 1 tbsp of hot sauce. As well, similar to other reviewers, my sauce wasn't thickening up at all and I was afraid of overlooking the chicken, so I removed it, then sprinkled in about a tsp of flour to help it thicken.   It seemed to work well. I then added the chicken back in and stirred it together before serving.  It had a great flavour, even if I did find it a bit hot for my tastes.

Simple to make, and a treat to eat. Served over jasmine rice. This one will be made again, soon. I did choose to go with 3/4 part Sriracha and 1/4 part thai chili hot sauce (very hot) for the hot sauce portion. I like it hot.

This recipe was very tasty.  I used worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and I didn't use nearly as much hot sauce because I don't like spicy foods.  I definitely recommend this recipe and will make it any. :)

It was way too hot.  Next time I will use less tapatio.  Ginger adds spicy flavor also.  I used low sodium soy sauce, so it was not too salty.  Healthier than Chinese take out and easy to make.  I will add broccoli next time.  This was a hit in my family.

i doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the soy sauce.  i used 1/3 c. rather than 1/2 c.    i also added 1 t. of corn starch to thicken (other readers suggested dredging the chicken in flour but i decided to thicken the sauce).   i added a chopped red pepper and onion chunks.   get the sauce going and add the cooked chicken at the very end so as not to over cook it.    served with fried rice, an egg roll and beansprout/mushroom side.  excellent.

As written it's a decent basic, but you're better off using this recipe as a starting point and following personal tastes. I tossed the chicken in cornstarch before browning in 2 batches, sautéed an onion & lotsa garlic, added a can of water chestnuts since they were handy, THEN poured sauce over the whole thing.

Served with rice noodles and garnished with sliced almonds, green onions & sesame seeds that needed using up.

Very good. Not much oil is needed to brown your chicken --  I evidently used a bit too much, and between that and the chicken sweating out in the heat, I had to cook the dish a bit longer to thicken the sauce to my liking. This meant for slightly overdone chicken, but it was still very, very good. In the future, I'll likely try and use less oil or reduce my sauce a bit before adding it to my chicken.

This was pretty easy to make.  If you like to prep ahead, make the sweet spicy sauce the day before.  If you don't have hot sauce you could trade off with red pepper flakes or take it to the Korean side and use a red pepper paste.  I love this dish.  It's very attractive and can be used in many way. I am going to try it as a glaze for BBQ chicken or ribs.

Made this and it was awesome. Used less hot sauce (Frank's)  because my family doesn't like things very spicy. But the sweet sticky slightly spicy was a hit. Will make this again for sure!!!

Really great recipe!  I did simmer my sauce until it thickened then added it to my chicken that I floured before cooking.  I doubled my sauce and  sprinkled on some toasted sesame seeds and prepared it with fresh green beans and rice!  Huge success!

I haven't tried this yet but plan too.  I've read the other reviews that this isn't really either sticky or sweet.  I'm thinking a tablespoon of orange marmalade or kikomans thai chili sauce could help with this, perhaps both.

5 STAR Recipe!!
 We have already made this twice. Here are the changes we made. We quadrupled the sauce. Used even more ginger and garlic because we like both. Used Tapatio hot sauce. We used cornstarch in a bag to dredge the chicken before frying. Added 1 onion, frozen stir fry veggies, fresh mushrooms and zucchini to the sauce. We then served it over thin spaghetti noodles. To die for!!

I used ginger and garlic seasoning instead of fresh (cheaper and in the cabinet!), and I used garlic hot sauce. Absolutely delicious!

My husband and I have made this 3 times now and LOVE it.

I make a few changes:
I use slightly less hot sauce, as my husband likes spicy things but can't handle too much heat.
I use a tsp of ginger powder, and a tsp of chili flakes as my seasonings (I don't currently have garlic powder on hand).
I also add a couple tsps of flour when the sauce is on the stove with the chicken to help it thicken up, as I have found it doesn't otherwise.

This is a very solid recipe. I do make changes to the recipe each time I make it. I added sweet chili sauce and did not use ginger. I also did not use that much soy sauce due to the other reviews. This is a great base to the sauce and leaves room for creativity.

I loved it, and I solved the thickening issue at the last minute with some corn starch. Just kept sprinkling it in until it was thick enough, but otherwise I didn't change a thing. I used Tapatio hot sauce, so it was pretty spicy.

I made this as directed and my husband really REALLY loved it. I'm rating on his behalf since I wasn't able to have any. I did coat the chicken in flour as others had suggested and it turned out very tender and perfectly sticky. The only other adjustment I made was substituting ground ginger for fresh ginger because I didn't have fresh ginger on hand. I'll definitely be making this again since my husband loves it so much. Looking forward to trying it for myself next time!

This was so good! I changed a few things by adding and sautéed sliced carrots, red peppers, onion and snap peas. There was definitely enough sauce to cover everything. I also decreased the amount of hot sauce to a little less than a tablespoon because I can't handle the heat! It was still packed full of flavor and provided a little kick. When everything was cooked I topped it on a pile of jasmine rice. I will definitely make it again!

It was OK. Unfortunately we found it to be far too salty. If I try this again I will make sure to use only about a quarter of the soy sauce called for, no additional sauce at all and, perhaps, a bit of broth to top up the liquid aspect of the sauce. If it needs thickening I would just use some cornstarch.

When I tasted the sauce, It was too sweet for my liking, so I added more soy sauce and lemon juice. I used the chili garlic paste instead of hot sauce because I didn't have Tabasco. I used ginger powder because I didn't have fresh ones. I would think that fresh ginger would make it better. It was a good combo of sweet, salty and spicy. I would cook it again.  And it was so easy to make!!

I generally followed the recipe but I used diced tomatoes (1/2 can) instead of tomato sauce and I added about a teaspoon of siracha sauce. Instead of cooking on the grill I used a flat pan on the stove top. They tasted amazing. My husband said they reminded him of an Italian restaurant we used to live near. Success!

The original recipe may be better, but I took the advice of others to first dredge the chicken in flour.  I do not recommend doing so unless you at least double the sauce, as the fried chicken breading will quickly absorb the sauce as it cooks.  The flavor was actually quite good, but the chicken was too goopy for my liking, and I could still taste a bit of uncooked flour.  I would be more inclined to cook the sauce separately, let it reduce and thicken, then pour it over crisp fried chicken strips.  All in all, a pretty good dish.

Delicious! It was a little too spicy for my wife, so I will cut down on the hot sauce next time. I will also make more sauce, because I didn't have quite enough.

Worth making for sure, yum! Serve with steamed Jasmine Rice and Broccoli.

I followed this recipe exactly,  besides doubling up the sauce because I cut the chicken into bite size pieces. I used sriracha for the hot sauce and it was good... But, too much soy sauce, and not sweet enough. Next time I'm probably going to do 1/2 the soy sauce that I did this time and replace that with... I don't know, maybe pineapple juice? It's a solid 'base' recipe but to be GREAT it needs a few changes.

1. USE LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE. If you don't, it's too salty.!! (learned that last time)

2. I say double the whole quantity of sauce. Comes out kind of dry. Taste-wise though, amazing.  I'm going to whip up a double shot of that sauce before I put my left overs in the fridge. 

3. When you throw everything back in to add the sauce, it's pretty easy to throw a pound pre sautéed with ginger green beans in there too. 

Problem I always have with recipes like this is temperature of the stove. My chicken never comes out crispy like they do in Chinese restaurants.

My wife made this and we loved it.  The changes she made was to use already cooked chicken nuggets/pieces that were breaded.  She used Rooster sauce (Sirachi?), mince ginger, served it on white rice, and I poured a tad more honey on each piece.  I had been looking for this recipe ever since the Legends restaurant closed in New Albany as we loved their Honey Ginger Wings.  She wants to try and add some fresh pieces of pineapple to the recipe in the future.

This was a hit with our family! We have a large family so I used 10 chicken breasts and tripled the sauce recipe. Some of us don't like too much heat so I halved the the hot sauce using Sriracha as someone recommended. I also followed another reviewers advise and cooked the chicken in batches adding a little of the sauce each batch to thicken. Then took the remainder of the sauce, added water chestnuts and bean sprouts and thickened on the stove. Will definitely use this recipe again.

this was okay. i ended up marinating my chicken strips overnight in the sauce. this needs more of something . The Soya Sauce was really pronounced...could probably cut back on that a tad.

Didn't turn out how it says it is supposed to, but was pretty good. Next time I won't follow the instructions I will add everything else that the other reviews say to. Would definitely suggest adding flour to the chicken before you cook.

I watched the video ahead of time and so I coated the sliced and seasoned chicken in flour prior to putting it into a large pan to brown. I noticed the oil disappeared with the first layer of chicken so I added as I went along and as needed to keep things browning.  I made 1/2 a batch but used a full batch of the sauce because I also added some sliced carrot, cauliflower, celery, onion and brussel sprouts.  I pre-steamed the brussel sprouts, cauliflower and carrot to soften them a wee bit so they wouldn't be soggy later .. When added together, it was incredible.  I also tossed some green onion and black sesame seeds (didn't have the white) over the top to dress it right up.  I will definitely make this many times. It was fabulous.

My daughter and I loved this recipe. I made some changes and followed others suggestions with dredging with flour. I made mine with 2T sriracha and used ground ginger. Also, while the rice cooked I made a 1tsp ratio of cornstarch slurry and added to the sauce to thicken. We are keeping this one!

Very good!! I followed other users and dredged my chicken in flour and it really helped. Also added just a dash of corn starch. It was spot on! Very sticky and definitely had some heat to it. Definitely recommend.

Yum! My husband and I are big fans of simple stir fry, but I'd only ever used the low-sodium bottled sauce.  I hated using processed sauce for something so simple, so I tried this.  I dredged about 2lbs chicken and pan-fried it first, setting aside.  I  sauteed two bags of stir fry veggies in the chicken drippings, then poured chicken back in with triple batch of sauce (thickened with a little cornstarch)and stirred and simmered until it was all coated and cooked through, and the sauce thickened.  I did need to add some water to thin it.  Such a yummy sauce!  Better than bottled, for sure!  Served over brown rice.

It was fine. Nothing to brag about and nothing Ill make again.  I found it to be bland, not as much flavor as Id like.  I added broccoli as one reviewer suggested and that added more interest.  I also topped with green onion and sesame seeds.  Served over rice.  The kids liked it.   Perhaps It would be better if i were to marinate the chicken beforehand .

Great recipe! I dredged the chicken in flour as suggested and added broccoli and red and green bell peppers. I pureed the ginger and garlic in the sauce and reduced it at the end (removing the chicken and vegetables first to avoid overcooking) which gave me a thick and flavorful sauce. It made a very filling lunch over some plain white rice. Definitely will make again! Thanks!

Very tasty.  I cut the hot sauce to 1.5 Tsp and mix flour with chicken. Everyone like it
2nd time is used Siracusa hot chilli sauce. 1Tsp would have been enough.   And I simmer sauce for about 15 min before putting on chicken

We didn't have as much hot sauce, so we used less than the recipe. Which was fine. It would have been too hot for us if we used the specified amount. We liked it and thought it had a good flavor. It did get sticky, but we had it on high heat. We also dredged in flour like others suggested.

This was wonderful! I did make a few changes/additions: I doubled the sauce recipe which was wonderful as written, I dredged the chicken in corn starch for a little crispier texture, and I julienned carrots & snow peas and did a little stir fry on the side with broccoli and sweet onions as well.

This was tasty but WAY too salty. To reduce the salt content, I recommend cutting the soy sauce to 1/8 cup or less and omitting the salt on the chicken. You can always salt it later if needed.
FYI, I used gluten-free soy sauce but I doubt that makes a difference in saltiness compared to regular soy sauce. Also, because I don't like hot sauce, I substituted 2 shakes of cayenne pepper. That's a matter of personal taste, of course, and again I doubt that it affected the saltiness.
We cut up the leftovers and made a chicken salad (adding mayo and celery basically), and even in this form, it was still too salty.
I'd make it again and enjoy it with the above modifications.

Cooked with both chicken and broccoli and served over rice. It was definitely a little salty, not too bad, but especially the broccoli and rice, but otherwise delicious. Would recommend using a low sodium soy sauce to mitigate the saltiness.

It is everything you say it is. We all loved it a lot, and my husband even requested it a second time during the same week. I found it a little spicy but the guys didn't. It seems to get hotter the longer you cook it and it also thickens more the longer its cook. I chose to take my portion out before adding more hot sauce. I served it over brown rice and stir fry vegies on the side.  It is very filling and not a lot of calories. We will be making this again and again and we all thank you for this great recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe! It turned out great!  I followed the recipe but followed a fellow reviewers suggestion and added corn startch vs flour for a crisper taste, worked out really well.  The only thing I would do differently is add more hot sauce.

I love this recipe!  I doubled the sauce ingredients, added bean sprouts and snow peas.  I didn't want the sticky so I did not dredge the chicken in flour as suggested.  I also substituted sriracha and tabasco for the hot sauce (I like spicy food) and used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I added sesame seeds also.  So yummy!  Will definitely make this again and again!

Definitely a keeper. I also cut the chicken up in small bites   And then tossed it in flour. I also made twice the sauce so I could pour it over rice and broccoli. My kids don't like spicy so I omitted the hot sauce and then sprinkled my plate with crushed chili peppers. My 7 year old even ate it and said it was really good!

I made this recipe the other day and we loved it! I will definitely make this again, I made it exactly as directed and even though the sauce didn't get sticky, the flavours were amazing and we like the runny sauce because we were able to mix it in with the rice. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. The only change was dredging the chicken strips in flour seasoned with salt and pepper before browning in olive oil. Meanwhile reducing the glaze and then adding to the chicken so not to over cook the chicken.

This recipe is so quick and easy to make!  I loved the spiciness of it, but will cut down on the hot sauce next time, so others in my family can enjoy it, too.  I used double the amount called for of ginger and garlic, and added about 2 C Oriental stir-fry vegees.  I like sauce for serving over rice, so didn't want my sauce to thicken and get sticky.  I didn't give it a chance to thicken.  Following other reviewer's advice, I removed the chicken from the pan after browning, then added it back in after vegees were almost done, and sauce was somewhat reduced.  Next time I might try doubling the sauce, but that is the only change I would make.

Nothing "sticky" about this recipe, but of it is delicious. I added more "spicy" to it with more Paprika and a little cayenne pepper, just because that's the way I like it. Served over rice! 
Next time, I think I'll use chicken thighs instead of the breasts.

Great! Was not sticky, but it didn't matter, it tasted great. Served it up for supper with brown rice. Kids and husband loved it, will make again.

I used sriracha for the hot sauce, low sodium soy sauce, added broccoli, red, and orange peppers during step 3, then added a half Tablespoon of cornstarch to the mix to help thicken the sauce. Family loved it.

Chicken dried out in the time it took to reduce the sauce. I'll also use a little more brown sugar next time, and a little more honey. I'll also probably just put the sauce and chicken in at the same time.

I make this dish over and over and it's wonderful!  I did follow one other reviewer's decision to dredge the chicken in flour first and it comes out beautifully sticky.  Sometimes I add broccoli and green pepper as well.

I made the change everyone suggested - dredged my chicken in flour - and the sauce thickened and everything was delicious.  Easy to make, I usually have all the ingredients on hand, my family gave it thumbs up.

Followed the recipe, I'd recommend most cut back on hot sauce. I used two tablespoons of Louisiana hot sauce, next time I'll use one, I also added corn starch for thickening.

Very good. The only change I made was coating the chicken in flower, salt, and pepper before cooking in a pan with cooking spray. My family loved it! Even my 18-month-old daughter wanted seconds...and thirds. :) We will make it again.

This is a five star recipe with some adjustments. 

I took the advice of several reviewers and lightly floured the chicken before putting them in the pan in the oil. I then followed the recipe from there. 

It did need longer than stated, I let the sauce thicken on the chicken while I made some Asian flavored noodles. It might have needed longer because I put a little too much oil in the pan, but it was perfect after letting it sit on low for awhile. 

This recipe is definitely a keeper, though!

Here is another 5 star recommendation! Delicious! I followed the recipe (doubled everything for sauce because I had six chicken breasts and wanted extra sauce) . Not too spicy, not too sweet but you can easily adjust to your taste.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers...I coated bite-size pieces of chicken in flour, cut hot sauce in half (thank goodness for me), etc. To me, this recipe was just OK. I felt the sauce was a bit cloying. However, my husband liked it....once he put extra hot sauce on it. Go figure.

I love that this was so fast and easy to whip up.  The flavor was nice, but nothing special.  I will definitely keep this recipe for those times when I want to make a tasty meal but don't have a lot of fresh ingredients on hand.  I hadn't read the other commenter's reviews about the sauce not thickening up when I made this, but luckily I followed my instincts and used cornstarch.  The consistency was great and I had no problems getting the sauce to thicken.

This was REALLY good. I took the advice of tossing the chicken pieces in flour before cooking which not only helped the sauce thicken up but also created a bit of a crunchy coating on the chicken. I used ginger powder and only one tbsp of honey and it still turned out great. The only thing I will do differently next time is use low sodium soy sauce as mine came out a tad too salty for my taste but that's a personal preference. Really good. Give this gem a try!

Awesome! You really should dredge the chicken in flour before putting in pan, and have that pan on medium high. I like to serve with white rice and stir fry veggies.

It called for a bit too much soy sauce so it was a bit salty. But otherwise it was great.

Omg! Amazing! I took others advice and dredged the chicken in flour. Used curry instead of ginger because I just don't have ginger in my house. (One teaspoon). Added broccoli as requested from the boyfriend. We loved it!! Has nice heat to it too. Will be making again!!

Amazing!  I dredged the chicken chunks in flour, like others suggested, and added the broccoli, like the editor suggested, and everyone loved it.  This is now firmly in the family rotation.  Oh ya, also left out the hot sauce so the little ones would eat it and it was still great.

Very easy recipe.  Used boneless chicken breasts and cut into small pieces.  Needed to cook longer than the time indicated.  More like 8 minutes each side. I doubled the sauce because the measurements didn't seem to add up.  Glad I did because based on the recipe there would have been nothing to serve over the chicken. Served with rice and steamed veggies.  Very good but double up the sauce.

I think this would have been good except I over cooked the chicken so it was quite dry. If you're into sweet with a little spice defiantly worth trying, just stick to the recipe instructions and only cook the chicken for 2 min before adding the sauce mixture.

Very good!  I dredged the chicken in cornstarch before cooking and it helped the sauce thicken beautifully.  Also, toned down the hot sauce because more would have been too much for my family!  I would make a little extra sauce next time though.

So if you make this dish, I recommend making more sauce than what's listed above. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. There wasn't anything that made me in a rush to make it again.

I followed the directions although left out the hot sauce as we don't like the heat.  The dish was easy to do but the chicken ended up very salty.  I had to let it sit for about 1/2 hour because we had something come up and couldn't eat right away.  Was the saltiness from the soy sauce and/or letting it sit>

To spicy, next time I'll cut back on the hot sauce. Other than that was delicious. The sauce thickens if you let it sit for a while, uncovered, after cooking. It's even better the next day!!

Argh I forgot the flour dredge everyone mentioned! Flavor here is awesome! Wouldve liked to have double the sauce it was so good and I only used 2lbs of chicken breast. The thinner sauce does make this feel like a lighter type dish which is not a bad thing at all. I would choose this over takeout any day. Great meal!  Four stars instead of five because it doesnt say how much chicken in lbs and there wasnt enough sauce.

I have made this several times and it's a favourite for the kids.  I always doubled the sauce no matter how many breast I use. I also add fresh broccoli and cut them small and  add them as I wait for all to join the table.  We like them crunchy. Delicious. I also add powder ginger if I don't have fresh.

Made this for dinner for my boyfriend and I, such a quick and easy recipe. Only thing is, I did what others suggested and dredged the chicken (this was new to me, so thanks everyone!). I also did not use chopped fresh ginger, I was lazy so used powdered ginger instead (from the spice aisle). I'm not sure how much this affected the overall taste but it was still delicious. Last thing- I am not the biggest fan of super spicy food, so I went a little lighter on the hot sauce (used sriracha), but my boyfriend added a lot more to his plate of food- still was delicious with the perfect amount of spicy for me. Thanks for this recipe!

I'm reviewing this because I need leave "notes" and I don't see that option anywhere anymore!  This was good but a little too heavy on the soy sauce.  I doubled the sauce except the soy and the hot sauce I kept the same.  I recommend dredging the chicken pieces in flour as well as one person stated, but the 8-10 minutes was adequate for me to reduce the sauce, even at double the amount.   My husband loved this and my picky 4 year old even ate a few bites (for him that's good!).  There was barely any leftovers for 2 adults, but we had this as a main course served over rice.

The taste was excellent! I changed it up just a little. Instead of fresh ginger root (I didn't have any) I added 2 teaspoons of ground ginger. 
   When I make it again I'll cut the hot sauce in half; it was just a little too spicy for my family. But over all it was excellent!

Loved it!  Great on its own or as a base recipe.  You can add different veggies or use in a wrap.

I followed the instructions with some minor changes. I cut the chicken into cubes and floured it before cooking. Also. I used habanero hot sauce, so I only used 1 tbs., which is a good thing because it was pretty spicy. All in all, it was pretty good.

My husband actually made this and I liked it. It was sticky and sweet, but we both agree it needs more of a kick. We have plans to tweek the recipe next time.

i am a vegetariann so i used this for the sauce over veggie chicken tenders hahaha also i personally didn't have brown sugar or honey so i used white sugar and coconut nectar instead and i used half franks red hot hot sauce and half sriracha for the hot sauce. i also used about a fourth of a cup of barbeque sauce for that added flavor. it came out really well. i didn't really use exact measurements and i added ingredients to taste but it's very sticky,  sweet and spicy :)
i think all recipes are more suggestions and all measurements should be to taste and everything comes out great

I followed the instructions as posted, except I took others advice and lightly floured the chicken before browning it. Doing this made it thicken right up within the 8-10 minutes the recipe stated it would. The only thing I added differently was I used a ghost pepper hot sauce as requested by my husband. Let me tell you, even 1 tablespoon was WAY too much when using a sauce of that caliber! He loves it, but it was too hot for me. lol I made a second batch and used the Rooster sriracha sauce and it was perfect!

I used 2 drops of Tabasco sauce, and had to use syrup instead of honey. But it turned out good nevertheless! A bit too much soy sauce, it drowns the other flavours a bit but will still make a again!

I did it just as said in recipe, w/o garlic, just because I had none and instead of hot sauce I used mild ketchup and it turned out just perfect. Perfectly sweet, yet not to sweet, ginger and dash of pepper gave it that mild but tingly sensation. Even my sister loved it and she is pretty tough crowd.
I'll most def do it again. Love it so much.

Very yummy! I only alter it a little, like doubling the sauce and a little less hot sauce. This is a regular meal in our house. Thank you for sharing this! For those of you who don't know....a little corn starch and I mean half teaspoons at a time or flour will thicken any sauce for you. Or remove it from heat, as it cools it will thicken

This was great.  I dredged the chicken in flour per suggestions in reviews and I added a tsp of corn starch to the sauce to make it thicken. I used Sriracha for the hot sauce. I used a cast iron skillet, very hot, and it cooked the chicken and thickened the sauce perfectly. We added the broccoli and served it over brown rice.

This was pretty yummy. I found myself wanting more sauce for the rice and vegetables I served with it, so I will double the sauce the next time I make it. Also my mother-in-law is sensitive to spicy food, so we cut back to 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper. This will go into my regular meal rotation.

This chicken was great! It was really delicious and very easy to make. I didn't make any changes except I left the hot sauce out. I also only used three chicken breasts because it was all I had. The chicken had a somewhat dry texture, which my family liked, and it wasn't sticky at all. We loved it! I will make this again!

This needed more....starting with more sauce for the amount of chicken. I would double the sauce  and also add broth then thickening with corn starch or flour . Then I would decrease the chicken but make up for it by adding a bunch (2-4 cups) of Asian style veggies to round it out.

This is a great recipe, especially if you are looking to make a quick week night meal!  I doubled the recipe and added shrimp. I seasoned the chicken & shrimp with onion and garlic powder (omitted the Hot sauce; used ground ginger). I like the flavor created by the soy, ginger and brown sugar.  It gave the dish a flavor similar to the sauce used in your favor take out dish, but with out adding oil and the accompanying fat & calories.

I did add a corn starch slurry when I noticed cooking without the lid did not thicken the sauce.  I used 1-2 tspns of cornstarch, and just enough orange juice (about 2 tspns) to moisten the starch and make it fluid.  Then I turned my heat to high, pushed the meat & veggies to the sides of the pan, and poured the slurry into the center of the pan while quickly stirring.  It thickened perfectly. Best of all my husband enjoyed the dish as well!

Amazing. I wish I could say I made it as is however I used what I had on hand. First I used 3 large boneless, skinless, chicken breasts with rib meat. I did dredge them in flour before browning due to other reviews. I did not have fresh ginger so used 2 table spoons of ginger ale. I cut the hot sauce down because my 2 and 4 year olds were eating this as well. And lastly I added finely chopped onion while browning the chicken. We served over white rice with a touch of brown sugar sprinkled on it. Everyone loved it and I will be making this again!

This was a little too spicy for the bulk of my family and I did not even use all of the hot sauce. I also had to substitute powdered ginger for the fresh. We all really enjoyed it, just a little too spicy for most. Will probably try it again with less hot sauce or a milder variety.

I made this with chicken thighs and followed the other reviewers advice in coating with cornstarch.  The taste was good, but it was too salty.

This turned out great. Perfectly sticky with great flavor. I coated  the chicken pieces with flour as others suggested. ( I used  boneless, organic chicken thighs from Costco- used all 3 packages). I also simmered the sauce in a separate small pot while the chicken pieces were frying. (I doubled the sauce.)  I quicly fried the chicken pieces in batches, browning on all sides.  Once all the chicken was done, I put all of it back into the frying pan (cast iron) and poured the sauce over it. I simmered it for about 10 minutes. I also added a little asian chile sauce and hot sauce at the end to give it a little spice.  Served with brown rice. Perfect!

The hot sauce doesn't seem to work right for this recipe. The soy sauce was overpowering. Will not make again.

I've made this several times, and my family loves it. I don't do the flour dredge or cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I just turn the heat up and let it boil for a couple of minutes. Works great for me!

Made exactly as directed and this was just ok. It was quicker than our usual recipe which was part of the draw, the chicken is not fried which was another draw for me and I am a sucker for honey. It was a bit too sweet tasting, too much soy  and lacked the complex layers of flavor in Chinese cuisine that our family enjoys.   I am always looking to find a simpler and healthier way to get yummy chinese food on the table but I think this is not it for our family. I will stick with our  usual recipe that takes more time but has a much better flavor and consistency.

This could have been more like 2 and a half stars if there were half star options but since not, and since I had such high hopes and was let down, it gets 2. 
It wasn't too hard to make, which is nice, especially considering most Asian inspired food. But... 
-Way too much. This should have been half the size that it was. And it's not easy for novice cooks to change portions, especially when it comes down to as little as teaspoons worth of stuff. 
-Not sweet at all. I used all the honey, all the brown sugar, and tasted none of any sort of sweetness in the final dish. 
-Super soysaucey. That's the main flavor of this all. 
-Not spicy at all. Maybe it's the hot sauce I used but there was no heat whatsoever. 
Not sticky at all. I even followed the suggestions and dredged the chicken. It made it a little better but not by much. 
If I make this again, I'll probably add more sugar and/or honey. Also more hot sauce. Hopefully this'll mellow the soy sauce too. I'll make a lot less chicken. I'll dredge the chicken again. I'll also work a crust up on the chicken before I bother with any sort of sauce.

I made this recipe as written and it was just okay.  The sauce was more salty than sweet from the soy sauce and it didn't thicken up and get sticky at all.  I cooked for close to 15 minutes, but the sauce stayed runny and I didn't want to over cook the chicken (too late).  Most of the 4 and 5 star reviews list a number of modifications for a reason.  As written, this was edible, but not something I would make again.

Whole family loved this! I doubled the brown sugar, used ground ginger , and halved the hot sauce for the kids. I also simmered the sauce separately first, then added to chicken. Just before adding , I mixed 2 t. cornstarch with 1/4 cup of sauce and blended back in, to thicken the sauce better.  I recommend doubling the sauce recipe - everyone wanted it on their rice as well.  Super tasty!

This is a great recipe. However,  the first time I made it, being experienced with asian style dishes and chicken's tendency to make slop of sauces, I added 1 tsp cornstarch and 1 extra tablespoon brown sugar to the sauce and coated the chicken in flour prior to searing. Turn the skillet to HIGH (not medium) and let the oil get hot. Add chicken and sear, turning over small pieces with a spatula, for a minute or two. Searing is very important here, as it locks in the chicken juices and is the difference in dry chicken or juicy chicken in these kind of dishes; browning does not cut it with this one. Turn to medium and cook chicken as directed, but do not add the sauce yet. Add sauce to another small skillet or non stick sauce pot, and let it simmer a little (not a lot, you'll burn it) until it is desired consistency. If it is too thin, add another 1/2 tsp corn starch, but it shouldn't be. When chicken is nearly done, add sauce to chicken and let cook for one minute. Turn off heat. It will give a result that looks more like the picture and is very sticky. Additionally, my husband dislikes spice, so the second time I made it, I removed the hot sauce and added 3 tablespoons honey and 2 brown sugar. I think in the future I'll add that much even if I return the hot sauce, as it balanced the garlic and ginger more smoothly.

Very nice. To thicken, I stirred up some corn starch with a bit of water and added it. Also added some 2" long slices of green onion, some broccoli and chopped squares of green pepper. Because I like it spicy, I added in a few pinches of chili flakes too. Good stuff !

We loved this dish and it was very easy quick and easy to make. We added sliced red bell peppers and sweet onions to the chicken when it was time to add the sauce. My family voted for a little less spice, so you may consider using half of the hot sauce stated (we used sriracha sauce) if you don't like spicy. The sauce did thicken a little, but not as much as I thought it would. Add a little cornstarch if you want thicker sauce.

I followed other's advice and dredged the chicken in salt, pepper and flour.  Sautéed onions and red bell pepper  before the chicken then added it all together. The sauce thickens up nicely from the caramelizing sugar. I only used 3 Tbsp of soy. 

My husband loved it. I am going to add peanuts next time I make this. Not that the extra flavor is needed, but I think the flavors will go together nicely.

I really liked this recipe and didn't have problems with the sauce. However, out of habit, I did lightly flour the chicken and seasoned with salt/pepper. Also, since I didn't have fresh ginger and garlic on hand, I substituted with tsp ginger, 1 tsp garlic powder. I used 1 tbsp chili/garlic sauce (husband doesn't handle spicy stuff too well anymore). Added some frozen, whole green beans the last 8-10 minutes of cooking. We thought the sauce was great, but wished I would have made more sauce. I'm not sure why others complained about the sauce, but perhaps the little flour I added helped thicken it. Otherwise, I really didn't change the recipe. Good flavor, although it does not taste like an Asian dish. Then again, there's no reference to the dish being Asian, it's just being assumed by the reader.

This meal turn out delicious. The sauce wasn't thick but that didn't bother me. It went well with steam rice and veggies. The sauce its self was amazing. I added an extra tablespoon of honey so the sauce   wouldn't be spicy.

I followed suggestions, and coated chicken stirfry strips in tapioca powder, then browned in batches (keeping others hot in my oven)   I added some red pepper flakes to my sauce mixture because my husband likes some heat   After chicken was cooked,  about 10 minutes in all,  I returned all to fry pan, added sauce and put my Chinese noodles on to boil, and microwaved my package of stirfry vegetables, everything was done in 3 min after dumping sauce on chicken.  The sauce was enough to coat the chicken and thickened up well   If you want sauce for the noodles or rice you will need to at least double it.  I did not add any salt or pepper,  this was a hit and will be regular rotation through the month. YUM

I would definitely make it again! My family and I loved the flavor, and it was just the right amount of spice. Following the other reviews, I thickened the sauce using a bit of the soy sauce and some corn starch. I also made one and a half times the sauce, using 1 tablespoon and the extra eighth of soy sauce for thickening at the end, after the chicken was cooked. Finally, I used 1 lb. of chicken breast tenders instead of the chicken breasts.

Made it with the suggestion of other cooks by lightly dusting chicken with flour first. Also added broccoli once chicken was browned along with a couple teaspoons of water & covered briefly for broccoli to steam. Personally next time I make it I'll add half the fresh ginger (my husband's not a ginger fan), along with fresh mushrooms and sliced water chestnuts for some crunch.  I would rate this recipe as 4 1/2 stars

I've made this twice now, and made two minor adjustments. First, be sure to cook with stainless steel cookware - the chicken will sear nicely and the sauce will become thick and sticky within 5 minutes. (For those who are not accustomed to cooking on stainless, the key is to use quality stainless cookware, and to pre-heat the pan for about 5 minutes to avoid excess sticking.) At the suggestion of another reviewer, I coated the chicken in flour, which made it even better. I  added sesame seeds at the end and steamed some broccoli, red pepper, carrots, and rice. Excellent!

I used whole, thinly sliced chicken breast (was too lazy to cut up into pieces) and it turned out great! I did dip them in flour before frying them over high heat (obviously longer than just a minute or two) and doubled the sauce. Had no problem with the sauce thickening but it didn't really come out sticky. It was no big deal though because it tasted great. Next time I will probably triple the sauce to have more to pour over the rice.

Very good, will cut back on the hot sauce just a tad next time. Also, I  dredged the chicken in flour before I cooked it.  Tossed with stemmed carrots and broccoli  and a touch of sesame oil  over white rice, was very good !

Quick, easy, i had all ingredients on hand AND spicy enough to be very tasty!   The only thing extra I did was to saute some peppers and onions to add to the pan at the end.

Delicious! However, I only used 1 tbsp of hot sauce  instead of 2. It gave it just enough heat. It wasn't sticky. Husband wished it was saucier.

I loved!  This will be on my roster from now on.  I think the issue of too runny a sauce is from using low quality soy sauce.  Splurge, it doesn't cost that much more.  My sauce thickened way too quickly and was too thick so that I had to add a bit of water.   We like it a bit sweet so I doubled the brown sugar.
I also added bits of red pepper and some yellow onion very thinly sliced.  The whole family loved it.  Thank you!

I usually use chicken breasts for chicken cordon bleu or breaded chicken.  This time, I decided to surprise the kids with a new recipe.  I never regretted choosing this one!!!  The kids loved it and even said that they wanted it for lunch the next day.  Like the others, I coated the chicken strips with flour before frying.  I'd like to emphasize on LIGHTLY coating the strips because although you wouldn't have any problem about the sauce not thickening up like the other reviewers, too much flour will dry up the sauce. :)  I didn't have any hot sauce on hand but I did have sweet chili sauce so I used 1tbsp honey and 1tbsp of the sweet chili sauce.  I added a little cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is awesome!

WAY too salty! I might make it again, but next time I'll either add less soy sauce or some water and a sauce thickener. Other than that, the taste was fine and the sauce did thicken after about 6 minutes.

I added water chestnuts, fresh mushrooms, onions, yellow and orange peppers. Then served it  on top of rice and drizzled the excess juices over everything. Great recipe!!

We have made this several times and it is always gobbled up in one sitting! The teenage boys, who love both chicken wings and sweet sour Chinese chicken, thought this recipe was "the bomb". Like other reviewers, I pan fried these after coating in flour and it got a nice crunch which contrasted with the sweet and sticky sauce. A bit salty; will try lower sodium soy sauce next go.

Yummy!!!  Cut back on the soy  even using the low salt type  & ginger.  I'm not a ginger person.  No honey I used agave instead cut it to by tablespoon. Added  dribble of hot sauce & chili sauce too.  I doubled the sauce but next time I will triple for lots of sauce. Oh yes I put some broccoli in it as well it was great. One thing after we sat down to eat, green onions over the top would be good added as a  crunch garnish!! Will do that next time!!

Very good recipe. Even my picky 8 year old ate this. Added a bag of frozen broccoli. Served with white rice. Easy and quick on a busy weeknight.

I doubled the recipe because I had alot of chicken and alot of people to feed.  I read that people were complaining that it wasn't thick so I added 1 tablespoon corn starch and 1 tablespoon water mixed it then added it to the sauce before I poured it over the chicken thickened up real quick.  Taste awsome .  Will definitly make it again.

I dredged unsalted chicken in flour.  No problems reducing sauce and the chicken was nice and sticky.   I think the salt in the soy and hot sauce put it at salt overload-and I do like my salt.  I would try again, using low sodium soy and maybe plain cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.

Followed the advice of flour dredging the chicken and it worked perfectly. I also put two tablespoons of ginger root instead of two teaspoons because I can't read. It actually didn't make a difference! It turned out fantastic but I didn't cook a side dish so I ate this with oatmeal. Would make again!

Excellent meal.  I coated the chicken in a little flour as one of the other reviewers recommended. I added a bag of stir fry frozen veggies at the end.  Easy and delicious!

I'll definitely make this again and I'm thinking about trying the sauce with shrimp. I followed the suggestion of other reviews and lightly coated my chicken with flour (about 1/3 cup). I also let it simmer for about 15 minutes and it turned out quite tasty!

I have lost count of how many times I have made this recipe. Every time it is incredible. Sometimes I coat the chicken in salted and peppered flour before I brown it sometimes I don't. Sometimes I double the sauce to add vegetables. Sometimes I make the sauce and vegetables on their own. Also amazing with pork. Memorize this sauce, your family will ask for it often. 
Hint: For cold season I add orange juice and zest and make this with broccoli. The spice helps open the sinuses and although it is warm and comforting it doesn't feel like "health food." It is the easiest way to get boys to get their vegetables.

Family really liked this recipe. Followed the other reviewers advice. Cut the chicken and put in a gallon bag with 1 T flour with salt and pepper and shook until the chicken was coated. Browned in hot skillet and set aside. I did 2 T brown sugar and the rest of the ingredients the same.  Added those to the cleaned out skillet and reduced to the thickness I wanted. Then added the chicken just to heat it up again. Served it with roasted broccoli and carrots and 1/2 cup whole wheat couscous per serving.

Unbelievable!! I made this last night for me and my husband and making more tonight for the kids to try. I did follow others and shook the chicken in flour beforehand.  Extremely easy and quick to make. I served over Jasmine rice with a side of broccoli. Tonight with rice and Edemame. YUM!!

I thought this was fantastic. My kids, who are picky eaters, tried a few bites and decided they did not like it, but I think if I make it a few more times, they will come around. I dipped the chicken strips in flour, as others requested and everything turned out great. I didn't think I would have enough of the honey mixture, but I was wrong.  Will definitely keep this in my 'favorites' to make again.

This was an excellent (and easy) dish.  As suggested by other reviews, I coated the chicken in flour.  I also stir fried an onion and a bell pepper  to add some fiber and nutrients.  The result was a simple delicious meal.  If you are cooking for people who are sensitive to spicy foods, it might be worthwhile to cut the hot sauce down to 1 1/2 tbsp (sriracha is the best!).

Really delicious, and the taste sticks to you for a long time. 


I added chicken stalk to the sauce(half cup), nice addition i think. I sauce took much more than 10 mins. Next time I will try with flour. 
Would love to make it again.

A fairly simple, straight forward, and exceptionally tasty meal.  I found that doubling, or nearly doubling, the marinade allowed for better flavor and provided additional sauce to pour on accompanying rice.  When I first made the recipe the sauce didn't thicken up in the suggested time, so I cooked the chicken a bit long and it came out perfectly.  All in all, an excellent and fairly easy meal!

Fairly easy to make. I used Sambal sauce for the hot sauce and it was perfectly spicy yet sweet enough.

This was very good. Next time I would cut the hot sauce. But that is just me. Everyone else loved the heat... but I do the cooking, so I will half it next time. I think I cooked it down more then other people cause mine was sticky. 
Thank you for sharing. very good!!

I was very pleased w the tenderness of the chicken and the consistentcy of the sauce, but I thought the flavor could have been better.  The soy sauce made it way too salty.

Definitely salt, pepper, and flour the chicken before browning it! I needed 2x the amount of sauce indicated.
It tasted amazing--just like what you'd get from a Chinese restaurant! Even my picky family loved it.

I did add the flour to the chicken, also added vegetables- sliced onion, red pepper& button mushrooms  as well a broccoli.  I pre steamed the broccoli.  I added the sliced veggies once the chicken was browned, then  the broccoli & sauce.  also subbed Chinese chili paste as I didn't have any hot sauce.  Very tasty

Turned out ok. Used the flour tip and had no problems with the sauce not being sticky. I used 2tbsp Sriracha for heat which for our taste was a bit much. Next time I'll use just one Tbsp Sriracha and I would double the ingredients for the sauce  so we have enough for rice or noodles. It's a good recipie will make again.

Loved it!! I had to use ground ginger but it still turned out great. Will be making this again and again!

Update: I make this at least once a month. It is one of our favorite recipes! I actually prefer it with 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger over fresh (I know, I know, it sounds wrong but the flavor is nice and strong).  I sometimes add a little extra of the sweet ingredients.  It works with leftover rotisserie chicken too.  Oh, if you have trouble with the sauce thickening, it may be because you are using chicken with added solution. Drain the chicken juices (after cooking chicken but before adding the sauce).

I liked the flavor--it was definitely sweet and spicy.  I did dredge the chicken in corn starch before placing it in the skillet and had no problems getting the "sticky" consistency.  We like spicy foods, but will probably cut back to one TBSP hot sauce next time I make this recipe.  I also agree with other users and will use reduced sodium soy sauce next time as well.  Thanks for submitting.

This was amazing. My picky fiancé loved it as well. . I used half the amount of chicken and added some stir fry veggies. I did dredge the chicken in flour before frying. It was well worth the extra few minutes. Can't wait to make this again.

I followed the recipe as written.  Perfect blend of sweet and spicy! Delicious and so easy to make. Next time I will add some broccoli, julienned red peppers and pea pods. I used brown rice as a side dish and it complimented the chicken to perfection!

I made this with just a couple small tweeks, was EASY and DELICIOUS! Will definitely make again! Adjustments made: dredged chicken in coconut flour, added a tbsp of rice vinegar and 1 tsp corn starch to the sauce.

I took Rebecca's advice and dredged the chicken through flour prior to cooking.  Also, we are not HOT fans, so I backed off the Red Hot sauce by 1/2.  My sauce thickened right up, ahead of time, to the point I had to pull it off the heat before it began to dry up.  Very tasty meal.

We loved this! So easy!! I shook the chicken pieces in a bag with flour and a little pepper and it came out great. It was definitely sticky. I also threw in some onion and red pepper when simmering the chicken. I doubled the sauce, but only used half the amount of hot sauce since one of my boys does not like spice, and it still had a great flavor with a hint of heat. I served it with rice and steamed broccoli.  I will definitely make this again!

This was so yummy. I did coat the chicken cubes in flour. I did add a little more hot sauce and honey. I cut up some jalapeños, onions, green onions and red peppers. I served over steamed rice and sprinkled some sesame seeds over the chicken and there ya go!!!! Definitely making this again.

I followed the suggestion of flouring the chicken. I also used sriacha in the sauce. This was amazing. I served over rice with stir fried bell peppers and onions. I made a little extra sauce for drizzling over the rice and veggies. We loved it! I garnished with sesame seeds.

I liked this recipe. I halved the hot sauce as my family isn't into spicy. My husband didn't care for the flavor from the hot sauce and it was still a bit too spicy for him and my 6year old. my twin 3 year olds ate it up though. No problems with the sauce thickening.

I floured the chicken and used powdered ginger, it was very good but a bit too spicy, next time I will try 1T hot sauce.  I made it again and doubled the sauce but only used a dash of hot sauce, very delicious

Oh my goodness, wow this is so good. I added a squeeze full more honey. All I did was simmer the sauce with peppers. Then I added in the floured chicken. It would've overcooked if I had done the chicken first. The flour thickened up the sauce. I used sriacha hot sauce.  I made two servings  just so I wasn't disappointed. Definitely happy with the outcome and going to make it again.

Great recipe!  I reduced the ginger & the hot sauce to suite my family & double the sauce.  I followed some other reviewer's advice & threw in onions at the beginning & bell peppers at the end so they were crisp.  Next time I will add equal parts cornstarch & water (likely a TBSP of each mixed together) to thicken the sauce.

I thought this was wonderful! I added a bit of extra brown sugar to combat what other reviewers said about the sauce not thickening. It cooked down in 7-8 minutes and was sticky and perfect. Will post a photo to show my tenders in the deep, beautiful sauce.

This recipe was overall amazing. My chicken turned out fairly sticky, and did have both the sweet and spicy flavors.  However, I made the following changes based on reviews:
-after cutting the chicken into very thin strips, coat lightly on flour, this will help brown the chicken before drying it out
-minced the garlic and fresh ginger instead of chopping, because it will help it to cook down in the sauce
-use half the amount of soya sauce, as it did have a powerful soya sauce flavor according to other reviews -at this, it still was quite powerful
-simmer sauce in a pot on medium heat while cooking chicken, to make it thicker
-cook chicken on high heat,  not medium
-if you like spicy, add in another tablespoon or two to the sauce while simmering -we like spice, so adding this was definitely a good idea
-pour the sauce over the chicken while it is hot and let the chicken coat in the sauce off the direct heat with a lid over it, for 5-10 minutes. 


I served this over a bed of rice, and it was definitely an amazing addition to the dish. 
Overall, the chicken was amazing and I got tones of compliments from my family after making this. I will definitely make again, and recommend to others!

This was a quick and tasty recipe.  I added a tablespoon of flour to the skillet once I poured the sauce and stirred everything together.  Next time, I will add more vegetables but we will definitely have this again!

It tasted pretty okay, but it that amount of soy sauce was way too salty for me once it reduced down.

I'm leaving a star off because although the flavor was great, the sauce was too watery. Next time I'm going to dredge the chicken in flour or something to help with that. It also seems like it's a dish that would be even better with vegetables.

this was fine but certainly not sticky. it tasted good but was too salty according to my wife. worth making again but would do it with reduced sodium soy sauce and read other reviews on how to thicken it up. otherwise, really simply dish to use up chicken pieces or other random veggies.

This was ok. I floured the cut up chicken and sautéed a bit before adding the sauce, as other reviews has mentioned, but this seemed a bit bland and as others stated, the sauce never really thickened. Not bad, but probably wont make again. There are lots better recipes for less work on here...

I've made this SO many times. It's so easy, tasty, and always a hit. I do cut the hot sauce by about half because my hubby can't handle the heat. I also add about a tbsp of flour to thicken it up: Perfection!

My family and I LOVED this dish! It was a little spicy for the little one, but even he cleaned his plate! Even though I used low sodium soy sauce, the dish was still a little salty for our liking, so I plan to leave out seasoning the chicken with salt before cooking it. But all in all, it was a great dish! Thanks for sharing!!

The sauce has great flavor. But it does come out runny as written. I even simmered the sauce for 30+ mins before mixing in the chicken. It goes great with stir fry veggies and rice.

We loved it.  The sauce thickened just as described. In fact, I had to add a little chicken broth to thin it out a bit. We like a little sauce on our rice.

As good as any Chinese take out.
serve it by itself over rice or stir fry vegetables and then mix together. very sticky not spicy and very good. experiment and make it your own.Do not add any  vegetables  to the chicken
while cooking ,the sauce needs to cook down to thicken and the water in the vegetables will not allow that to happen 
be patient and it will thicken. Add other ingredients afterwards.

I wish I could give this more the 5 stars! one of the best dishes I have made from the site! I took the advice from others and floured my chicken. I doubled the sauce since I was adding veggies to make stir fry. I also didnt add as much hot saucy so my 16 month old could eat it. Added sesame seeds too. I cooked sauce separately from chicken. Had a hard time thickening it so I just added some cornstarch and water. The flavors from this dish are impeccable!!

Awesome recipe it's a new family favorite. I only made one change on the ingredients I added siracha instead of hot sauce to keep the Asian theme going. I also did dredge my chicken before cooking with flour, salt and pepper and a couple of spoons of cornstarch. Cornstarch gives it that crunchy texture so sticky sweet spicy and crunchy perfect!!!

It was very yummy! My ginger root was not good, so I subbed ground ginger, took into consideration what everyone was saying and simmered the soy sauce mixture while I prepared the chicken which I mixed 3 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp water before I cooked it. It made a nice browning effect and made the sauce just the right consistency. Just next time I think I will decrease the hot sauce, was just a little to spicy. I also used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

Floured the chicken strips prior to cooking.  I simmered the sauce separately in order to reduce it prior to adding it to the chicken.  The result was perfect.  Sauce was nice and sticky and the chicken wasn't overdone.  The flavor of the dish was great.  The only thing I will do next time is make more sauce so I can have extra for the rice and veggies.

This was delicious! I used reduced sodium soy sauce and no hot sauce because kids don't like spicy. I did like other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour before browning. I also stir fried some peppers and onions for a few minutes, set aside, brown chicken, then added veggies back with the sauce and cooked 10 minutes or until sauce was thickened.

Easy and fast recipe.  I followed advice of other reviewers and tossed cut up chicken with flower before cooking.  I followed the rest of the directions and it turned out great but next time I would cut back on the soy sauce or use low sodium as it was very salty.

As others, I made the changes for a thicker sauce, I also added vegetables. The hot sauce I used was made from habaneros,  and the end result sooo spicy.

Delicious chicken.  I used 1 Tbsp of hot sauce and that was spicy enough for me.  I added some corn starch to help thicken the sauce.  I cubed the chicken and added sliced zucchini (as part of a challenge).

Awesome. I forgot to add soy sauce and it was delicious without. Followed others advice and cooked sauce separate ahead of time then added to chicken. Also dredged chicken in flour. I didn't have ginger root so I substituted 1 tsp ground ginger. Definitely will make again!

Only used 1T hot sauce; it was enough.  Sauce could have been a bit thicker.  Added broccoli, carrots, green pepper.  Overall, we enjoyed it.

It was good.  I overcooked the chicken slightly on the first one minute per side.  My bad.  Other than that, it was great.

We loved this recipe. I did double the sauce, simmered it while cooking the chicken. I did dredge the chicken in flour and cut it into bite size chunks instead of strips. I also sautéed an onion and pepper and set aside. Then added the chicken to hot olive oil and browned slightly. Added back the vegetables and added the sauce and it immediately thickened nicely. Next time I will add some pinaple chunks for a little more sweetness. I served it over long grain organic brown rice. Delicious indeed!

I mixed up double the sauce and used half to marinate the chicken in the fridge, then I grilled the chicken. The other half of the sauce, I cooked to reduce it then poured over the grilled chicken. My hubby loved it! Thank you!

The flavor was great (I love ginger in my chicken) but it was really watery.  Next time I might double the ingredients for more, and perhaps add a touch of cornstarch to help thicken it.

I was missing hot sauce so I added Worcester sauce instead. It was a good sub but I would have preferred the hot sauce.

UPDATE 01/2016 I made it again and the sauce did not turn out right.

I took another reviewers advice and cut up chicken into pieces and dredged in flour in a plastic bag. Cooked chicken in olive oil and should have used vegetable oil. Made up the sauce first. After chicken cooked, then added the sauce and lowered heat for few minutes, then turned off and put on lid. Meanwhile was steaming broccoli and cooking rice. Put broccoli then rice on plate and topped with chicken. Did get sticky due to using flour. I also used fresh ginger for first time, less is best as powerful taste, but good. Can keep rest of ginger stalk in freezer.

This is absolutely delicious. I throw together the sauce into a small sauce pan and simmer (I double the sauce because I serve over rice and I like enough sauce for the rice to soak some up). Like many others, I cut my chicken into chunks and toss in a ziplock with flour, salt, and pepper. I sear the chicken on med-high to high and then toss the sauce in and cook over med-low. Sauce is sticky, sweet, and spicy! This is a family favorite. Toss some broccoli florets and green onion in for even more flavor if you've got some around!

Wonderful. I didn't have any issues, but I did double the size of the recipe and added 2 teaspoons of corn starch and 2 of flour to thicken it. For the hot sauce I used Sriracha and boy is it spicy, but amazing!

I made it exactly like the recipe called for, just with a few additions.  I doubled the sauce.  I cut up 6 chicken breasts.  I doused the chicken in flour salt & pepper mixture before browning.  I then added broccoli, onions, and carrots to the chicken before adding the sauce.  I cooked the mixture for 10-15 minutes and served it over rice.  Was a big hit!  Will make it again.

So delicious! I floured the chicken like some suggested and seared for one minute on each side on med high heat. I didn't have ginger so I left that out and used Sriracha for the hot sauce. To thicken the sauce just mix in a tsp of corn starch diluted in water to the sauce.

I made it exactly as written except for substituting 1/8 tsp ground ginger for the ginger root because I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand.  I used siracha sauce for the hot sauce.  My husband loved it.  We will definitely make it again.  The only change I would make would be to cut back the siracha sauce a little bit because it was a little too spicy for my daughter.

Sauce doesn't thicken because there's nothing to thicken it. Adding a corn starch slurry would but I didn't because we ate it over rice which absorbed the yummy sauce. 
Instead of hot sauce, which are usually bitter, I added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Also added extra tbsp of honey to better balance soy sauce.
To make super tender chicken and a full meal:
Chop 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 green bell pepper and 1 small white onion. Add peppers & onion to skillet on high heat with 1/4c water and cover. Steam for 4 min. Scoop out peppers & onions, add chicken to pepper water on high uncovered til chicken half done. Add veggies back in & sauce. Keep on high so sauce boils to slightly carmelize, constantly stirring. Serve over jasmine rice.

This was so good!  A little on the spicy side for my younger kids...but I will just add less Sriracha next time.  I also shook the chicken pieces in a ziplock bag with flour/salt/pepper before putting in the pan, cooked the sauce down separately and added to the already cooked chicken. Yum!

I absolutely loved making this.... I agree with heating the sauce before putting it on the chicken!! the sauce was thick enough and it was spicy enough for me! Definitely making again!

I make this dish a lot.  I frequently substitute tofu to make it vegetarian.  I sometimes add onions while I'm cooking the tofu.  I use about 1/2 the hot sauce  because otherwise it's a bit too spicy for us, and I add some corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.  Very yummy! Thanks for sharing.

I read most of the reviews and made the adjustment. I sautéed some onions green peppers and broccoli and placed them to the side. I made my sauce and I doubled it...so glad I did and I let it simmer and then started my chicken. I toasted my chicken with corn starched and browned it. I added my veggies and chicken to my low simmering sauce...and LAWD HAM MERCY...Deeeelious! Tasted like restaurant Asian food and of course I did rice as my side.

A mix between the recipe and a couple of the other reviews and the whole family loves it!! Huge hit. All ingredients stated the same just a few tweaks....simmering the sauce as I cut and prepared the chicken, lightly coated chicken in flour, then seared on med-high heat till chicken was browned and then added the sauce, cooked in low till rice was done....

My family really liked this recipe.  It's easy and will definitely be in my regular recipe rotation.  The only change I would make is to use reduced sodium soy sauce, as we thought the sauce was VERY salty.

Not a hit with this family.   I am usually pleased with a dish with this many stars and ratings.  This recipe, followed exactly, was a disappointment.  Not one person, including the kids, at my table enjoyed this.

WONDERFUL. I mixed some flour with the salt and pepper and tossed the chicken in that before throwing it in the skillet. I added sweet chili sauce to add some thickness and it turned out awesome.

Great recipe! I make it all the time with plain rice and salad for dinner, boyfriend loves
It. I made a few changes though, less soy sauce and put flour on the chicken before cooking it up as it helps the sauce get sticky and thicker.

Love this recipe, but a little too spicy for my buds. I decreased the hot sauce to my liking and I have made it several times now with a bunch of Asian veggies and rice. Family loves it!!

Definitely double the sauce!! Because I didn't have all the ingredients the recipe calls for, I used 1/2 a tbsp of white sugar instead of brown sugar and used 1 tsp ground ginger instead of ginger root.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it wasn't to much for my taste at all. I did dredge my chicken in a flour/boubon flavor packet (in my supermarket, the packets are with the asian foods). As I do with all my food, I used a little chicken broth when I mixed in the sauce. I sautéed in a tri-pepper blend and a can of french green beans. There are countless ways you can add to this recipe! This is a keeper!!

This has turned into one of my most popular dishes. coating the chicken in flour and pepper is a must. This recipe would easily lose a star without it. This dish still tastes great if you freeze it to eat another time.

Made this for my family tonight, and they absolutely loved it! I did have a similar issue with the sauce not thickening BUT it was an issue easily resolved by adding a small amount of cornstarch.

If you notice your having the same issue with the sauce not thickening, while you have it simmering with the chicken, add about half a teaspoon (or even less to start) of cornstarch. Add until it reaches your desired thickness!

So I've made this maybe half a dozen times now. As written I think the recipe warrants a 3 star... You absolutely need to dredge the chicken in flour before cooking to get a good result. Also I summer

This is made in my kitchen nearly weekly. Sooo good. I double the sauce recipe but cut the ginger (I use ground) and garlic in half after making it a few times. Roll chicken in flour prior to cooking. Add sauce, stir to coat, simmer for a minute or two, add more flour, stir, and you're set!

This dish was amazing! Perfect amount of heat and the sauce thickened up perfectly. I did lightly dust the chicken with flour before cooking and I also added broccoli, then served over rice. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Made this recipe several times now and I do put a bit of flour on the chicken so that the sauce thickens up, I make double the sauce amount and then put a lid on the frying pan and let the chicken simmer while the rice is cooking.  Delicious!

Made this up for the first time...
many people tried it and demanded
for me to give them the "Secret Recipe"
I usually am very reluctant on serving any
new recipes but in THIS case I made it up 
to everyone RAVING about the outcome...
FANTASTIC to whomever provided it... Thank You!

Followed others' suggestions to dredge the chicken in flour by putting chicken in a ziplock with flour and shaking it up. Seared chicken on high heat and added the sauce for 8 minutes uncovered until done.

Sticky ... no ... sweet ... just right ... spicy ... not so much, I did go without the chilli sauce, added the broccoli and mushrooms just to soak up the liquids, and it did thicken slightly after a little while, served with basmati rice...great dinner ... thoroughly enjoyed ... thank you for this :D

Had this for dinner tonight and it was a hit.  Did the chicken in cubes instead of strips and I added broccoli florets, chopped yellow onion, julienne carrots and red pepper.  Sautéed veggies first and then added them to the chicken and sauce at the end.  Totally on my favorite list.  Only thing I will do different next time is add some corn starch for a little thickening.  If you like lots of sauce I would recommend 1.5X the recipe.

I added the broccoli, but should have added it later. Even though I dredged my chicken in flour the sauce still took a long time to thicken and the broccoli was a little mushy. I used 1/2 the amount of srirachi hot sauce and it was a little too spicy for my taste. Will adjust the recipe next time. Flavor of the sauce was really good.

I really love this recipe! Just made it and served with rice noodles, spinach and tomatoes. The flavour is absolutely incredible! I won't be ordering a Chinese takeaway any time soon, this is 100% better and homemade! Thank you

It was delicious both baked and sauteed.  I think I like the baked version the best.

I used tofu instead and also dreaded tofu in gluten free flour... sautéed onions, bell peppers and mushrooms with a little salt and chile flakes. then set aside while I pan fried tofu. I doubled the sauce adding little more hot sauce to my taste. this came out great!!

I personally did not use the flour because I'm gluten intolerant. With that being said , the recipe still turned out delicious! Sweet and spicy !!

The sauce does not thicken at all. Everything got over cooked waiting for sauce to thicken. Was not sticky or good at all.

Loved this recipe!  Dredged the chicken in flour as previously stated and glaze came out perfectly!  Didn't have fresh ginger and garlic and substituted powdered versions and flavor was perfect!  All the kids loved it too!  Keeper for sure!

This recipe is great!! I did follow others suggestions in mixing some flour in with the chicken before cooking. It definitely helped thicken the sauce. I also cooked the chicken and added the sauce after it was cooked. It has the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I used Siracha as the hot sauce to spice it up.  A very fast dish to serve when time just isn't there. This will be a staple dish in our home.

I have made this a few times now, and keep forgetting to rate it. This is a really good dish. I always double the sauce, so there will be enough for the rice as well. I usually don't double the hot sauce though, because the first time I did that & I couldn't eat it, it was so hot, but my boyfriend loves it. I serve it with basmati rice and Asian seasoned vegetables. Good stuff. Thanks so much for the recipe. Oh, I usually thicken the extra sauce with a little cornstarch, other than that, I make just as recipe calls for.

This was exactly what I was looking for: a perfectly harmonious combination of sweet and salty flavors with boneless chicken. As per other suggestions, I covered the chicken in flour. I browned the chicken first and then put it on the side. Then I cooked the sauce until it reduce to a thicker consistency. I added back the chicken and continued cooking another ten minutes. I threw some sesame seeds on top and it looked beautiful!

This is my "I forgot to go grocery shopping, but we have chicken breasts and random things in the cabinet" meal. It's super fast and easy and very hard to mess up. I like to add worchestershire to it every time and I typically use sriracha instead of hot sauce. The measurements aren't concrete so it's no problem to change it to fit your tastes. We like the hot more than the sweet so we don't use as much brown sugar.

I've made this 4 or 5 times now and it's been great every time. It's very forgiving, too. I've substituted chicken thighs, more brown sugar instead of honey, all different kinds of hot sauces... Never too hot or too sweet or too anything. They all work very well! I love to top it off with fresh chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds. Thanks for a great addition to my regular dishes.

Amazing! The burst of flavors is unbelievable. Used sriracha sauce and it was really quite spicy.  And for sure coat the chicken in flour before cooking it.

This was pretty good and the kids liked it enough.  The biggest issue was that there was not enough sauce for 4 breasts and it thickened up so fast (like in 30 seconds) that the chicken wasn't even cooked, I had to add a couple of tablespoons of water to thin it out because it was sticking to the pan so badly, and then I covered it to allow the chicken to cook.  It was still a very sticky coating, even with the extra water added.  I might try reduced sodium soy sauce next time because it was very salty (but tasty!)

Really tasty with a few adjustments.  I substituted teriyaki for 1/2 of the soy sauce because I ran out of soy sauce and it turned out very well.  I also cubed the chicken and tossed it in flour prior to searing, then removed chicken from the pan and reduced sauce and added chicken after sauce had thickened, as other reviews recommended.  I will definitely double the sauce next time, and I will continue the teriyaki and soy sauce combination because it would have been WAY too salty with the recommended amount of soy sauce.  Great flavor and a nice warm finish without being too spicy.

I found this dish too be way too salty.  Next time I'll use only 2 tbs soy sauce and make up the rest of the liquid with chicken stock. I also took the chicken out of the skillet as soon as it was cooked and continued to boil the sauce until it was thick. I tossed the chicken in the sauce and had truly sticky chicken.  Served it with steamed rice and roasted broccoli.

I loved this!  Will make again.  I did what other people did and floured the chicken before I cooked it.  I think that helps with the stickiness of the sauce too.  I doubled the chicken but not the soy sauce or hot sauce.

Very tasty!  I followed the suggestions of others to dredge chicken in flour, which worked perfectly to create a crunchy brown coating and thicken the sauce. Also used Sriracha for the chili sauce. Was a tad too spicy for my 6yo, would suggest using 1/2 the amount of Sriracha for milder tastes. Also added broccoli and bok choy. The family absolutely raved over this.  Definitely putting into the fave meal rotation.

AAAAAHHHHMAZING!!! I followed the recipe as is, the only change I've made so far is adding cooking time to let the sauce thicken up. i will be adding veggies as I master my cooking skills. But for now it's PERFECT.

Easy, quick and delicious Asian-inspired chicken! We dredged the chicken in flour as recommended by other reviewers. Also substituted hot sauce for 1 1/4 teaspoon of Sambal. Turned out amazing, we will be adding this to our list of staple dinner dishes. Thanks!

Set them aside.brown the chicken add your sauce and simmer till it thickens (tip simmer your sauce before adding to chicken) drain any excess oil from pepper and onion add to chicken garnish with chopped green onion. Yum Yum  good

I really like this recipe, but it just needs a little something more to be a 5-star recipe to my taste buds.  I would prefer it a touch sweeter and a touch less soy saucy.  My husband loves the recipe, but thinks it could use a little more ginger.  I think it has enough.  To each their own, I guess!

YUMMY!  I did dredge the chicken strips in flour first but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used one of the Uncle Ben's packets of already cooked brown rice for the base of this dinner, and it was perfect to soak up some of the heat from the Sriracha that was pretty hot for my husband.  I would think that the grated fresh ginger makes the dish, so I highly recommend that you have some in your freezer ready to grate when you decide on this meal!  Next time I may make a little more of the sauce!  This will be added to our easy quick mealtime dinners!  Thanks, Katemartino!

My family loves this recipe!  We are vegan so I make it with cubed seitan and it is delicious. I double the sauce though because we like a lot of sauce.

After reading reviews, made with these changes- dredge chicken in flour first, increase heat of skillet, left out ginger, heat sauce before adding to chicken, substitute red pepper flakes for hot sauce. Amazing!

Fantastic. We cut the hot sauce a little bit, since most of the family anti-spice. Otherwise, I dredged in flour and made per the recipe.

Very good for the flavor but super hot for my husband and my taste buds. I make it with 1/2 tb of hot sauce now. It's not very sticky for that sauce though.

Mine was very salty tasting.  Definitely need to use low sodium soy sauce.  I double the sauce.  It didn't really get thick so I added some corn starch mixed with water.  I added cauliflower instead of broccoli.  At the very end, I added cashews! yum, accept the saltiness :(

This was one of the best dishes I've yet to make off this site. The description should be changed to spicy, sweet, and sticky because this recipe has some serious heat to the average "non-heat seeking person". I did substitute siracha sauce which Is really meant for this type of dish.

Going to add red pepper flakes for a little more kick and clear jel to thicken the sauce   Otherwise this is an awesome sauce recipe. Will be using it on chicken wings and pork loin.

I would probably make this again. It tasted a lot like the General Tso's chicken mix from some stores. I decided to flour the chicken before I put it in the skillet. This is very nice on rice and isn't too difficult to make either. I think the "Sticky" is understated though. It certainly gets sticky after it is put up in the fridge, but is more than edible.

It came out delicious.  I added flour to the chicken and added a little more brown sugar and honey to the sauce.  It came out just like the recipe said, sweet, sticky and spicey. Would definitely make it again.

I followed other reviews and floured the chicken and used only 1Tbls of sirachi, low sodium soy sauce and didn't have any ginger. Turned out great! Just enough sweet with a little tang, my family loved it! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

The original is too high in sodium, so I used my own personal soy sauce recipe (I guess I should submit it ;) ) that is mostly molasses, beer and homemade veggie stock and made my own hot sauce (1/2 white vinegar, 1/2 cayenne pepper). I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground. I've marinated this overnight and used the foreman grill but this was the first time I've followed the cooking directions exactly and thought it was also the best tasting!

This was a big hit for the house.  I did reduce the chicken to two breasts, cut in bite size chunks dusted with flour, and tripled the sauce except for the hot sauce and add a teaspoon of corn starch before pouring over chicken.  Will be making this again and again.  Thank you for a great recipe

This was really good. I did lightly grill the chicken first and then made the sauce separate and added the chicken back in after it was thickened so as not to over cook and dry out the chicken. The kids loved it!
Made this a 2nd time and used another reviewers suggestion to coat the chicken with flour before frying. Fantastic!

Good quick meal. Would recommend adding veggies in with it. I like spicy so added a third table spoon or rooster sauce. Would also recommend cooking chicken in two different. Batches to help consistency of crispness. Also would recommend a little extra brown sugar as well as dredging chicken in flour.

Tastes yummy!!! I tripled the recipe and lightly coated the chicken with seasoned flour (salt & pepper), sautéed the chicken pieces for 2 min on each side. I also cooked the sauce in a separate pan for 8 minutes...

Last step I placed cooked chicken pieces in glass dish, poured sauce over the chicken and baked for 10 minutes on 350. Came out very tender and flavorful. 

I used raw honey which is thicker too.

I followed a few tips and floured the chicken prior to browning.  Also used garlic paste.   The sauce didn't look as if it may have adequately covered my ginormous chicken breasts so I only cooked about 21/2.   They turned out so good.  I recommend this recipe to anyone that enjoys the spicier side of chicken and rice.   (Just say no to veggies).

I didn't read the reviews until after cooked everything & saw the thing about the thin sauce so dumped a bunch of arrowroot in & reheated it so sauce thickened up quickly. Beyond that followed recipe rather closely and certainly tasted different than I expected, but it was still good. In the future I may use more sugar & honey or less hot sauce to make it taste more like I expected it to.

I used worchestershire with a splash of soy b/c I thought the soy would be over-powering. Nice flavors but sauce was a little runny. Will thicken up next time.

This was not sweet (even though I added extra honey and brown sugar) and it wasn't sticky. Just spicy. 
Not bad. Just not was I was expecting. 
I won't be using this recipe again.

Very very good! Tried it for the first time with too very discriminating teenagers...aka fussy. 1 out of 2 giving it a 4 out of 5 is excellent. The other teen is virtually impossible to please. This meal is delicious and fast to prepare. 
In the future when I make this for adults I will play with the ingredients to make it spicier, add some veggies, ginger for some more flavour.

Didn't really care for this.  The sauce didn't thicken up like I thought it would.  Will not be making again.

It was absolutely scrumptious , everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and coated the chicken with flour. I served it with quinoa pilaf. Will definitely be making this again!

It was as quick and as tasty as stated.  I needed a quick chicken recipe to fo with a baked mac and cheese casserole and steamed veggies. My in-laws and children loved it! :-)

Outside of the hot sauce being dominant there was not a nice medley of flavor as I expected. I would call it nutritious.... Won't make it as is again, need to overhaul

I made this a few days ago and it was a hit. did make some changes as others suggested.. Dredged chicken in flour and cooked it over medium heat separate from the sauce. heated the sauce in a separate sauce pan and added to chicken when it thickened and chicken was just about done. used Sriracha hot chili sauce instead of hot sauce. Used chicken strips cut into bite size.. Turned out GREAT! will make this again and again!!! Thank you all for your input it is most helpful..

Liked this very much!  Though, I would advise to also follow the advice of reviewers and change the method slightly:: I  heated the sauce in a small sauce pan, while sautéing my chicken pieces in a separate pan. When chicken was 3/4 done, I added the heated (and, by that point, thickening) sauce & cooked the chicken the rest of the way like that on low heat. The result was perfectly saucy, sticky, spicy-sweet chicken bites. Super easy too! Absolutely lovely with rice and steamed broccoli. Will definitely make this again ( & again, & again)!

I followed other people's advice here and dredged my chicken strips (three step dredging - flour+egg soak+flour again with seasoning added to flour - salt, pepper and cayenne pepper). Took very long to make it but was worth it. I also added bell peppers and onions following another reviewr's advice and that added a lot of flavour. But the sauce turned out to be very less. I had to make a second batch with double the quantity..so essentially the sauce finally used was thrice the amount mentioned in original recipe. Iused Sriracha hot chilli sauce as er another advice i found in reviews section. The final dish turned out to be spicy, sweet and sticky, just perfect. thank you everyone for all the helpful comments that helped me make my first ever chicken dish :)

I took the suggestion of dredging the chicken in flour  ( I used whole wheat) and browning first which added texture.  I served it with jasmine rice instead of plain rice and the combo was delicious. I waited to add the siracha until seeing because my kids don't like spicy.  I loved it with,  they loved it without so it worked out well.  Next time I'll double the sauce because I would've liked a little more to top the chicken and rice.  Yummy and easy!

Delicious!
I followed some of the others suggestions & drudged the chicken in flour prior to putting them in the oil.
I also used ground ginger instead of fresh and Sriracha hot chili sauce instead of hot sauce. 
Served over rice with a side of broccoli florets. 
Absolutely amazing!

I don't like spicy, so I only put a dash of hot sauce.
I also coat the chicken in plain flour each time and it goes really sticky ??

My whole family love this and its a winner with the kids ??

Dredge chicken in flour then cook in oil on high heat; 1/8 tsp. Ginger;  reduce sauce a bit before adding to chicken; make sure chicken is on low and pan isn't too hot when adding sauce or it'll burn;  didn't add the spice;  good with carrots and basmati rice

It was actually very delicious.On my part I cooked the chicken to long and it made it very hard.Instead of using fresh ginger root we used a tube one and it tasted the same.Thanks  for this idea and we will make this again soon.

This was delicious and even my super picky 9 year old loved it!

Ad others suggested,I dusted the chicken pieces in flour to help the sauce stick and it worked great. 

However,it was very spicy (and we *love* spicy here)and my 3 year old couldn't handle it even after I doubled the sauce and did not include the hot sauce when doubling. So basically double the sauce, 1/2,the hot sauce. We love it, but if my 3 year old is going to eat it next time,I will have to dial back the spice more. 

Definitely a keeper though!!!!

Love, Love, Love this!!! The recipe was Soooo Gooood! I used siracha as the hot sauce and did not use any ginger becuase I did not have any on hand. I change the recipe to make it sweeter (more honey & brown sugar) or more spicy (more hot sauce) depending on who I make it for... I put an extra tablespoon on honey & siracha... It turned out more like spicy & sticky chicken, but that was just fine with me because I love spicy food! I put rice and frozen stir fry veggies in the rice maker while cooking the chicken, put the steamed veggies in the pan with chicken as I pour the sauce in. Comes out wonderful every time!

Loved this recipe. Although I did cook the chicken separately and the simmered the sauce in a separate pan. I then added the "almost" cooked chicken to the sauce. Also decided to cut down on the amount of hot sauce (to 1 tbsp) and it was just the perfect hint of spice amongst the sweetness. Definitely a keeper.

I tried this recipe last night and I don't know why all the other reviewers are having issues with the sauce. I did mean to cook 2 chicken breasts so I adjusted the recipe to 2 servings but ended up using one chicken breast. I used a hot sauce that I wasn't particularly fond of for this recipe thinking that with everything else the flavor would mesh with everything else and be good. I was wrong... next time I will either leave out the hot sauce or find one that I am more fond of. Other than that, the recipe was very easy and I wouldn't change anything about it.

I made this for my husbands birthday dinner. He LOVED it. I did make some changes to the original recipe. I used the flour as recommended by many reviewers. I coated the chicken with flour, salt and pepper then cooked it until both sides were browned. Then I added the sauce and cooked for 3 more minutes. I used half the soy sauce and it still seemed to be over powering so I added a few tablespoons more of brown sugar and garlic.

This is hard to rate because I didn't follow the recipe and I think I caused my own problems, so I'm giving it five stars because it tasted great.  I modified this recipe based on the reviews, by dredging the chicken in flour before browning it.  This didn't work out well for me, with the sauce overthickening and just turning the whole thing into a goopy mess.  However, it was a delicious goopy mess, so I'll try this again!  Next time, I'll skip the flour.  If the sauce doesn't thicken enough, I'll try adding just a light sprinkling of flour the time after that.  I served this with rice and vegetables.

Easy to make...but I cut the hot sauce in half because I am not a fan. So I don't know if it's that or the chopped ginger but wow...sweating, burning, nose..etc...  I'll make it again but just tweak the hot things a bit.  It's a good, fast recipe and I sure appreciate that..rice cooks while this does. [I did cheat and add a bit of flour during the simmering process...it's not necessary since the thinner the sauce is, the easier it is to put over the rice]

The sauce was yummy!! I tossed the chicken in seasoned flour before frying it and I had to use buffalo wing sauce instead of hot sauce because that's what I had. Everyone asked me to make it again, and my Chinese exchange student raved about how good it was. I also tossed in some stir-fry veggies to make it a one-pot meal, served with rice on the side.

It was great I felt I could have seasoned the chicken more but I added some Cayenne pepper to give it an extra dash of heat. I also added gren, red, yellow peppers for kicks and giggles.

Wonderful. I did as several suggested and put the chicken in a bit of flour before frying. Nice and crispy. I also added 1 tbsp. of siracha instead of hot sauce and doubled the sauce recipe. It was the perfect amount of spice and sweet. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing this great recipe! AAA+++

Tried this recipe and everyone loved the flavor. I did try putting the chicken strips in flour like some people suggested; however, when I browned the strips in the pan, the flour came off and it all became a gunky mess. Looked gross, although it still tasted great. I think it's probably because I was trying to brown too much chicken in a small pan. I added some sauteed onions and orange juice to the sauce, partially because it didn't seem like very much sauce, still hardly wet the amount of chicken I had, 3 1/2 large breasts. But again, flavor was A+. Thanks for sharing!

The taste was great. I could have added a bit more honey but it came out deiclious. Didn't add much hot sauce since my boyfriend isn't the spicy type, but just enough to give it a little kick. It is sticky enough, I did add some xanthan gum to make it a bit more thick (the sauce). After it was all cooked, I added sliced apples in the pan and then some seeds to give it a more Asian flare.

This was the perfect recipe for me. Easy to do, simple ingredients and worked perfectly, first time, every time. I halved the hot sauce, garlic and ginger, and it was just right for my family. The sauce thickens up if you let it simmer long enough - longer than specified. Makes enough sauce for the meat but if you want to pour it over rice, double the recipe. This was the first Chinese recipe with which I could produce results remotely like what you get at a Chinese restaurant. And the sauce is perfect for stir-fried veggies as well.

Really delicious.  I used 1/2 tbs cornstarch and 1/2 tbs water mixed together and threw that in to thicken the sauce.  Really pretty color. Also added some toasted sesame seeds.

Definitely a keeper with modifications--the sauce is the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I chopped the chicken into bite-sized pieces and tossed them in flour to lightly coat them. I only had 2 chicken breasts and that was plenty. I also added water chestnuts and some asparagus a few minutes before it was all done. Next time, I'll probably add more veggies like snow peas and broccoli since I like more texture with my chicken and will make 1 1/2 times the sauce so that everything gets coated well with enough for the rice.

Family really liked it, but as my husband said, "It was very good, but it wouldn't be something I'd request too often."  I did have to make a few changes based on what I had available.  I doubled the recipe simply because I had a lot more boneless, skinless chicken thighs than called for.  I also did add a few drops of sesame oil.  I dredged the chicken in corn starch prior to cooking as the recommendations of other reviewers suggested.  The sauce thickened up nicely, although there wasn't any left over to put on the rice, per se.  Because I had so much chicken I had to cook it in batches so it didn't just steam.  Good recipe for what I had on hand.

Loved this recipe. I used chicken tenders and floured them. I think this helped to thicken the sauce. But I followed everything else exactly and it was so delicious. Went really well well with mashed potatoes. My family loves mashed potatoes and also scarfed up this dish. Had no leftovers.

I halved the hot sauce ...

I coated the chicken in a light dust of flour beforehand...


This was SO delicious! My 4 kids and husband loved it!


Obviously depending on tastes you will need to adjust sugar and hot sauce as anyone would with any recipe. 


Amazing recipe my family wants me to make it a common dinner for us!

Tip: You are definitely going to want to coat the the raw chicken in cornstarch (or flour but cornstarch works much better)  before flying!

Very tasty and easy to make. I listened to other reviews and tossed chicken in flour before frying. I grated the fresh ginger and used 1 tbsp homemade hot sauce and 1 tbsp rooster brand sriracha sauce. I used 2 chicken breasts instead if 1 but added chopped onion, green pepper and mushrooms to ensure the sauce wasn't too overpowering. 
The sauce was exactly as described- sweet, spicy and sticky. I absolutely loved it and my boyfriend wasn't complaining either. 
I do suggest using a low sodium soya sauce in Kikkoman brand, and also passing up the salt in this recipe. 
I served with pork dumpling and brown rice for a tasty Asian inspired dish.

Delicious. This was perfect. I used Braggs Soy Sauce. Served it with brown rice and roasted broccoli. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet, had it over very high heat and dumped the sauce in. Instantly, the sauce turned thick and sticky. I do not like hot sauce, so I put in some red pepper flakes.

My wife and I made this last week for the first time, thinking it reminded us of the lettuce wraps from PF Chang's. What a wonderful idea that was. The only thing we did differently was to add some won-ton noodles over the top. 
Two thumbs up!

This was delicious.

I breaded the chicken in whole wheat flower and a dash of salt and pepper. Next, I pan fried it in about 2 tablespoons of coconut oil.

After that, I doubled the sauce and simmered the chicken in it until done.

I sprinkled sesame seeds on the chicken.

The hot sauce I used was the one in the cylindrical jar with the red top and the rooster on it. Not sriracha. More like a chili paste. It was spicy--too spicy for our kids, but fine for us. I used only 2 teaspoons of this hot sauce.

DELICIOUS!

I followed the advice of others and coasted the chicken with flour.  I browned the chicken and admittingly did not measure anything. I left out the ginger root as I didn't have any and I used August in Austin hot sauce.  The stickyness was great as well as the heat. Served over brown rice.

I have attempted other Asian inspired dishes, but with no success....until this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and put sauce in a small pan to reduce, as it takes a good 10-12 minutes to reduce. I didn't have hot sauce so I improvised with chili powder to give it a little spice. Also, chopped yellow pepper and sweet onion and sautéed in oil for 3-4 minutes before removing and adding chicken (placed in bag with flour to coat first). Having the oil heated on high helped with searing the chicken. You may need to add another tblsp of oil after removing veggies. After chicken was cooked through, I added sauce and vegetables to combine flavors. Brown rice from TJ's was a perfect match to the dish.

This was very good. It reminded me of the Korean dish my mom made growing up. I only had 1 piece of the boneless, skinless chicken at home. I didn't reduce much of the ingredients except for the soy sauce, and it turned out really good. It wasn't sticky at all, which I don't mind.

Was delicious, added a large spoon of apple sauce instead of sugar so it wasn't overly sickly and it cut through the sweetness. Served it with my homemade egg fried rice. Overall, a good meal!

Good flavor. I put it over fried rice and served it with store bought egg rolls. However, having said that, my experience with this recipe was too much chicken & not enough sauce.  I did notice that it didn't look like enough so I doubled it right from the "get-go". Perhaps my chicken breasts were larger than the ones used in the initial recipe but next time I will triple the sauce and add accordingly. This is quick, and the sauce could be made ahead of time. No problem with it thickening, you just have to be patient. Yes, I will make this again.

Watch the video. I says to dredge in flour but there is no mention of flour on the recipe.

Good flavor but didn't thicken without the flour.

This was delicious. I placed the chicken in a bag of cornstarch and shook it to coat the chicken. I added sliced celery, red bell pepper chunks and pieces of onion to the sauce as it cooked. It was served over brown rice. It turned out perfect. What a great way to stretch your food dollar and increase the nutrition as well. With the addition of the vegetables, it made a very pretty presentation.

Quick, easy, and it turned out delicious.  I read a few of the reviews about the sauce not thickening. So I added couple of teaspoon of corn starch and cold water at the end. Also I did have any honey at the time and used a bit extra brown sugar....it still tasted great! I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe, especially with Sriracha as the hot sauce component. Make sure you heed the popular advice of coating the chicken in flour first, and the sauce will turn out perfectly. It's fantastic just served over a bed of rice.

Very good recipe, did not use hot sauce, dont like it, used red pepper flakes. Next time will triple the recipe for extra sauce to go on rice. By itself only just enough to coat chicken, just a preference we like flavor on our rice.

There was way too little sauce for the amount of chicken I was making (2 pieces). So I added more of each ingredient in the sauce, and honestly it wasn't very good. The soy sauce outweighed nearly everything else except the hot sauce that I used (which was Sriracha). I may try this again to see if I did something wrong but I doubt it.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as written.  It took quite a long time for the sauce to thicken, but after it did, it looked amazing!  However, it was REALLY spicy....like my kids and I couldn't eat it spicy.  My husband (who LOVES spicy food) really liked it, but even he thought it was a bit hot.  
The second time I made this, I made the following adjustments:  cut the hot sauce down to 2 teaspoons, I used powdered ginger, and used just under a 1/4 cup soy sauce.  I also added water chestnuts and bamboo shoots as the sauce was thickening.  Serve over a bed of rice.  FANTABULOUS!

It was delicious. My sauce was perfectly spicy, sticky and sweet. I however added an extra table spoon of honey, some garlic powder and some ginger powder. I only used one tablespoon of sriracha then sprinkled a generous amount of cayenne pepper to the sauce. It was perfect!

I read other reviews and did some tweaking, the coating the chicken with flour was most helpful, also taste your sauce before adding it in.  I added more hot sauce and some red chili flakes and honey to get the mixture I wanted. I will be making this again with shrimp!

Solid recipe.  We took the advice of others and coated the chicken in flour before cooking.  Good flavor, fairly quick & easy to make...I just don't see us making this dish again - it's just something we would normally make...but worth trying!

This was very good.  Just as good as what I have had in chinese restaurants.  I served it over Spanish Style rice made by Seeds of Change.  It's organic rice with quinoa, red bell peppers and corn.  I did flour the chicken otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I will definitely make again.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe!!  I followed previous reviewers advice to dredge the chicken in flour and used Sriracha sauce.  I doubled the recipe and it came out perfect.  I will definitely make this again - thank you for sharing!

I followed the flouring advice too and it turned out great! I think it's a little too sweet for my taste and it could be spicier. So next time I'll add more hot sauce instead and a bit less honey. But for the most part it's what I expected and it is really good!

The sauce didn't really thicken, so it certainly wasn't sticky. It was actually a touch too spicy for us, and I cut back on the hot sauce even. It needs some tweaking to thicken up the sauce.

Made this with pork instead of chicken. I used low sodium soy sauce and added yellow and orange peppers and sweet onion. It was pretty good but very spicy! I used the least spicy hot sauce I had (Tapatio), might try a milder one next time. I almost didn't add the whole amount of ginger because I don't usually care for it, but it tasted good.

I didn't read the reviews!  Imagine my irritation when after making this the first helpful review states it isn't sticky!, 
Darn it neither was mine!!!!! Flavor was super good. Used Sririacha as the hot sauce.

Excellent! I used about a 1/2 T sriracha sauce in place of the hot sauce & I tossed the chicken in corn starch before cooking it.

Wow. This tastes great. I dredged the chicken in flour salt and pepper before sautéing. I poured the sauce and it thickened within a few minutes. I used 1/8 cup ABC sweet soy sauce (a must have for Asian dishes!!) and 1/8 cup regular soy sauce. Perhaps the sweet soy sauce helped it thicken up quickly since it is a thick sauce itself.

My entire family loves this recipe and requests that I always make more than enough so they can have leftovers the next day. Love this recipe and the flavor is fantastic. I fried up some red and green peppers to put on top of the rice, delicious! Would recommend this recipe to everyone.

This was great!  Husband loved it.  It was so easy and fast.  I took other reviewers advice and dusted the chicken in flour before frying.  I used Sriracha hot sauce so only used 1Tablespoon and it was plenty spicy.  I think it would of been too hot for our tastes should I have used the 2 T. the recipe called for. I used 4 large chicken tenders cut into chunks.  This was just the right amount for 2 people.  Thanks Kate for the great recipe.  This one will become a regular.

This was way too salty for us. My husband and one of my sons couldn't even eat it.  I don't know if it was too much soy sauce or what. Won't try it again.

Decided to try this out for dinner and wow, it was delicious! I read some of the other reviewers tips and simmered the sauce separately from the chicken for a couple minutes. I also dredged the chicken in flour first, helps to give it a crispy outside which does help the sauce stick better to the meat. Also using sriracha for the hot sauce gives it a nice kick and makes the dish really tasty. Also use med-high heat to get a nice golden brown crust on the chicken. I skimped a little on the ginger, added a little less than the recipe called for. I did add a little more garlic than was called for. Overall if you tweak this recipe or not it's really awesome.

I'm pretty happy all in all. Served on rice with scallions and steamed red pepper. Might have been a tad salty but I think that's because of my hot sauce choice.  I'll make it again with a homemade hot sauce. Definitely a winner!

I just made this tonight. It was absolutely great.I served it over white sticky rice. I don't really like ginger so I left it out and I only used 1 tbsp. of hot sauce instead of the 2 that was called for. It was really spicy with just the 1 tbsp. I will make this again in the future. In the future I will make more of the sauce because it was amazing.

I enjoyed this easy recipe.  I serve with basmati rice made with chicken broth and add frozen chopped broccoli to recipe before serving.  I doubled the sauce. I would agree with other reviewers that it needs to be cooked at a little higher temp and the sauce a little longer to thicken it but I always tweak recipes a little to ensure it is worth my effort.  It was still easy even though I had to add a little time.

Loved this. Like many others I too only had powered ginger, still noticed the flavor though. Also tossed the chicken in flour first and would highly recommend it. I ended up starting the chicken in the pan on the range but moved it into the oven to help bake it (I had too much chicken for a single layer). Will certainly make again and again!

This was a roaring success. I doubled the recipe to feed a crowd and everyone loved it. I was a bit heavier on the spices and will probably not do that next time, but there will definitely be a next time.

I made it and my husband made it and both version turned out fabulous!  He followed the directions pretty perfectly (tossed the chicken in flour first) and it was just a bit too spicy and a bit too soyish, so the next time we reduced the hot sauce and upped the honey.  Now it wasn't hot enough and still not sweet enough for us.  BUT...  WONDERFUL anyway!  I'd make it as directed and tweak until it suits your tastes!

I left out the hot sauce (I'm a wuss) and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking it.  YUM!!

I used a Polynesian brand of soy sauce and it was perfect.  I think that if I'd used Kikkomen brand (or any Japanese-style brand) I wouldn't have added any salt at all.  Next time I think I will double the amount of sauce and add in some broccoli at the end.

This was great!  I followed some of the reviews and dusted the chicken with flour before browning. Then I put the sauce in the pan with the chicken and let it cook down. It was great!

Awesome dish! I did like others and coated the chicken but with a flour, cornstarch and spice mixture. I used coconut oil. Very delicious over white rice!!

This is SOOOO good! Very quick and easy to prepare. I did do the flour dredging of the chicken. I even sprinkled crushed peanuts on top just before serving it. You'd swear you were at a restaurant.  Excellent dinner!

Read other reviews and tweaked it to our tastes as far as the heat, as is would have been way to hot for us.  Didn't have ginger root so I used powdered ginger. Had 2 breasts thawed so that is what I used Because we like more sauce and some vegies I tripled the sauce and added a bag of sauted oriental vegies at the end of cooking.  Adding thickener to the sauce is a must!  Next time I will do 3 breasts and quadruple the sauce so we will have enough for 2 meals for the 2 of us. Now I just have to find a good egg roll recipe. Thanks for the recipe Kate.

This was so easy to make and tasted fabulous.  I also cubed and dredged the chicken in flour. I'm not a huge ginger fan, so I just used the powdered ginger.  It was not overwhelming.  Husband also loved this dish.

Loved it! Just tried it tonight. A little spicy, a little sweet and somewhat sticky. I would stir it more often in the final phase of simmering to avoid burning (opps!) - but it still tasted good.

Fantastically quick and easy to make.  Took on board other reviews and dredged chicken through cornflour.  Timing was Ok for me and family loved it.  Served with rice and frozen mixed veg.   I also doubled up sauce mixture - you definitely need to do this - BUT I kept hot sauce to 2 tbsp (Encona West Indian Extra Hot Pepper Sauce) and  it was still very hot. so didn't really taste sweet.  Another sauce may not have had this effect so next time I'll still double sauce mixture but reduce hot sauce to one tbsp or try experimenting with other hot sauces. Excellent recipe. Ali,Scotland

First, let me mention the few small changes I made. One--I used lite soy sauce to help make this dish more healthy. I also baked the chicken by itself in the oven for 25 minutes instead of browning it (for the same reason) before letting it simmer with the sauce. And three, I only used a 1/4 tsp of hot sauce. Two tablespoons is ENTIRELY too much. Okay, now, for the taste, I thought it was great. I doubled the recipe, however, because it seemed liked too little and I'm so glad I did because even THAT wasn't enough. Next time, I will triple it and I think this will definitely be becoming a staple in our house after that.

This recipe is awesome if you use siriachi sauce for the hot sauce, it makes it hot and sticky. We make fried rice to go with it.

I made this recipe last night. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast because its more tender and moist and also followed Mamaspice's advice to us Sarachia hot sauce. It came out amazing. Sweet spicy sticky and so delicious. We make it again and again.

This recipe was a terrific springboard. I'm didn't have flour to dredge the chicken, so I used cornstarch...crisped it nicely. Added veggies like onion,celery, peppers. Thanks for all the suggestions.

Added cornstarch mixed with water near end of cooking. Made it sticky!  Excellent flavor with not so many calories. Served with brown rice and broccoli. Yum!

I followed this exactly as written.  It was good.  The only thing is it could have used a little more spice.  I think I'll add crushed red pepper flakes next time.  I also steamed fresh broccoli and added it to the dish.  I enjoyed the flavor and crunch that the broccoli gave the dish.

I just made this for supper. My husband and I liked it ,as well as my kids too. However, I took the advice of other reviews and tossed the chicken in flour first to make it crispy. I didn't want it too spicy so I only used half the hot sauce. I felt it was a bit too much soy sauce and not enough sweet. There wasn't any sauce to mix with the rice I served it with so it was a bit dry. I also stirred in sauteed onion/peppers. Next time I would add pineapple too as well as more sauce.

Delicious chicken that I will make again!  Took reviewer suggestions and coated chicken with cornstarch.  Stir fried onion, carrot and green beans first.  Then chicken, added sauce and veggies. Cooked for about 5 minutes.  Topped with cashews and served over Jasmine rice.  YUM!  Will DEFINITELY make again!

This was delicious!  Only wish I had made more sauce.  NO problem with thickening the sauce, but I lightly dusted the chicken with flour before browning. I used sambal oelek as my hot sauce and it was the perfect addition! I like hot and spicy and this filled the bill!

Delicious! I can't have gluten, so I coated the chicken with potato starch instead of flour to thicken the sauce. Looked just like the picture and tasted great! I only used 1 T of hot sauce.

I made a couple of moderations and I love it. I prefer more sweetness and heat, so I added an extra TBS of brown sugar and a good shake of red pepper flakes. I also used powdered ginger. I had no problem with the reduction, it thickened perfectly. I took a picture of it and sent it to my daughter. She can't wait to try it. I highly recommend this recipe and am anxious to move on to the next! Keep em coming

I tried this recipe and it was delicous!  I added a little more hot sauce because we like spicy food.  I cooked it longer than the time above and covered it.  Do not cover this while cooking because it makes the crusty chicken pieces mushy.  It had a very good taste and I will make it again without covering it!

I used the ginger paste and I didn't have any hot sauce so I mixed paprika with pepper flakes with vinegar and used 1 Tablespoon. I simmered the sauce while I browned the chicken and it turned out great!

I was about to give up on the "sticky" as it was looking more "liquidy" when I took the pan off the heat for 10 minutes because I got delayed. When I came back the sauce had severely evaporated and it was sticky! Perfect! I only used half the hot sauce because of our heat wimp. I served over brown rice and added cashews at the end. WE like a crunch. Also garnished with some green onions. Yummy dish and super easy. Thanks kate

It was pretty sweet, and somewhat spicy, but not sticky. Essentially the sauce reduces down to the point it makes a thick gloopy glaze that will quickly burn so I guess that is the "stickiness". Knowing some people had issues with the chicken getting dry, after browning, I sauteed the chicken for a few minutes in the sauce so that it got infused with the flavor. I then pulled the chicken out, and then sauteed a mixture of veggies in the sauce afterwards. I ended up adding water between chicken and veggies to make sure the veggies got the flavor, but didn't get a burnt glaze. Both myself, and my two year old son enjoyed the food, and I'll probably make again.

I served this tonight to a bunch of picky eaters..this was a total thumbs up!..I dredged the chicken with flour and sautéed in coconut oil...3 to 4 on med high each side...added sauce and simmered 5 to 8 on low...I liked the fact that there was sauce in pan to spoon over rice...cooking down would have dried out chicken...this is a keeper!...thanks

So simple and delicious! Can't believe I haven't seen this yet. I did coat the chicken bits in flour first and browned on 8 out of 10. Then added the sauce, minus 1 tb hot sauce, for the kids. It was sweet and sticky and thick. Definitely a keeper. Next time will double the sauce and add some broccoli and other veggies. Yummy, thanks for sharing!

Yum!  Five stars was easy for this one. Based on other reviews, I dredged the chicken in flower, doubled the sauce (left the Sriracha at 2 tablespoons), and sautéed an onion and green pepper.  During dinner, I said that I thought it tasted like take out and my boys said it was fresher than take out. This one is going in my Asian food lineup for sure!

We loved this recipe! Next time I will cut the chili sauce a bit as it was a little hot for us. However, the flavor was absolutely delicious and this is a very quick and easy recipe. It would be yummy with shrimp and some cashews tossed in before serving would add some crunch.

This is so simple and delicious! We like a bit of heat in our food, so I followed the recipe except that I had skinless/boneless chicken thighs thawed out, so that's what I used. Used a tbs of coconut oil in a non-stick skillet. As with other reviewers, my sauce really didn't thicken, but since it was served over rice, it wasn't a issue. Thank you Kate for sharing your recipe! I definitely will make this again. Serving over angel hair pasta sounds good :)

Tried recipe, revised with the comments and suggestions an it was PERFECT. I cut up my chicken in chunks, and seasoned with salt and pepper, coating with a light dusting of corn starch and chilling for about an hour. I doubled all of the other ingredients and simmered right before cooking my chicken and vegetables (I love the saucier sauces). I didn't let my veggies (Yellow, green, and red bell peppers and onions) get mushy, just the perfect crisp and then combined all and let simmer for few minutes. I was sweet and then the spice hit ya. I used Siracha as a 'chef' stated and it was delicious. This is definitely a keeper. I served with my homemade fried rice with jalapeno's and sprouts. There was none left and my family kept asking was there any left.

This was a very good and simple recipe. Unlike other reviews, I followed the directions that were given ( I think) and my chicken was sweet, sticky, and spicy. The sauce did thicken for me I don't know if the thickening was due to me cooking the chicken strips on hi heat or not but once I began simmering, within 8-10 min. the sauce did thicken, but I had a little reservation that the chicken might not be cooked all the way through, but I was wrong, the chicken strips were perfect. I really enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again, but I think I will use barbeque sauce in place of the hot sauce because I'm not a big fan of spicy foods.

What zing!  A little hot for me but my son and husband give it 5 stars. One reviewer suggested sautéing onions and peppers before browning chicken, then adding them to the sauce along with the chicken while the sauce boils down.  The onion and peppers soaked up a lot of heat.  I will add them back in at the very end next time.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved this, even better, so did the family.  It was a bit spicy for me, but very easy and tasty.
Second round we cut back on the ginger, omitted the hot sauce and added fresh squeezed orange juice and orange zest.  Loved it!

Absolutely delicious!  Quick and easy to prepare.  We live in Russia so finding all the ingredients for a new recipe usually takes a bit of extra effort but not this time.  Only a quick trip to buy fresh ginger and we were in business! I served it as a main course with bulgar wheat and broccoli flowers and it was absolutely delicious.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't like the flavor. It was missing something. And it had way too much soy sauce. So I started tinkering, trying to save it. I added more brown sugar. Nope. I added a sliced onion. Nope. In desperation I added a cup of Thai Kitchen Sweet Red Chili sauce. Slightly better, but not there yet. I ended up adding 2 more cups of Thai Kitchen sauce. A little better, but not memorable. I don't think I'll be making this again. Regardless, I know a lot of people liked it, and I say more power to them! We each have our own tastes, and I'm just grateful for this wonderful Web site and for those who take the time to comment. I have found the comments to be insightful and helpful.

The only suggestion is maybe drain the chicken juice a bit before adding the sauce in, but it was a success!!

great flavor! 4 stars because I made just a couple needed modifications...  Instead of hot sauce I used my chili-garlic sauce, cuz I like it, and 1/4 tsp is enough to give me flavor without making it too spicy for the kids... second, I added a TBS of cornstarch to the sauce before pouring it over the thicken, which I often do in my asian stir-fry sauces to thicken them... and third, I had stir-fried onion, carrot, green bean, and celery then added that back in to the chicken and sauce reduction, served the whole thing over rice and it was fantastic!

OH MY GOD!  This was amazing. I made it exactly as written except for omitting the hot sauce.  At the end when the chicken and sauce were done, I stirred in some chopped onion and green pepper. Served over brown rice.  I used two large breasts, weighing a little over a pound in total, and thought the sauce wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect.  Oh, and I almost forgot, I did roll the chicken pieces in flour based on many reviews.

Delicious! I used 6 breasts and made 2 batches of sauce, leaving the hot sauce out of one as not everyone here likes spicy. It was a hit with everyone! I personally loved the spicy. Will definitely make it again!

Terrific flavor!  I would cut hot sauce in half only due to my husband's preference, and I did dredge the chicken pieces in flour before Browning. Definitely a keeper!

Agree that it has a heavy soy sauce taste. My end result looked nothing like the photo.

I dredged the chicken and cooked it off allowing a few more minutes than the one minute per side. I made the sauce per the recipe and next time would double the ingredients with exception of the hot sauce(sriracha)allowing sauce for the rice. worth a try and personal adjustments. As a note I could not get 4 chicken breasts cut into 1/2 inch strips in a 12 1/2 frying pan.

Tried it and made it several times.....agree with other reviews, helps to dredge chicken in flour (seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder) before browning to thicken sauce quicker.  Often make a pan of stir fry veggies to go with dish and sprinkle with cashews or peanuts when serving!

Ohhhh my!  Made it last night and dredged the chicken in flour like everyone said.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a T.  All we could say was WOOOOW!  Next time I will double the recipe.  It would be great leftovers!!!

I made this right off the page with the addition of rice floured chicken strips.  I have to be gluten free so use a high quality soy sauce which is lower salt in addition to no wheat.  With Siracha sauce, this would be classed above mild but not up to medium at Thai restaurants that we frequent.  I rate it at 4 stars as is.  My mods include 50% more brown sugar & honey, 1/2 tsp each dry garlic & ginger powder instead of fresh, and add 1 tsp Xa Xiu powder.  I cook the chicken first, remove it, cool the pan a bit, deglaze with water, reduce the sauce, and add the chicken back.  That put it up to 5 stars in my book.

This was an amazing dish!  It's probably my favorite dish right now.  I made a little change.  I doubled the sauce and added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce so it coats the chicken better.  I also added steamed broccoli and tossed it in right before serving.  It was awesome and my family loved it!

I loved this recipe...and it is the perfect time to try using skinless boneless thighs in place of the breasts. The thighs never ever dry out and have so much more flavor. I did dredge mine in flour and add sriracha for the "kick". This recipe can be switched up in so many ways, thank you it is a winner.

I wish I had read more reviews because I would've done a few more things differently.  It was a good dish, but needs some tweaking to make it to my taste.   These are things that I did...

1. I used TABASCO instead of Sriracha.  Made the dish pretty spicy.  I had one serving, the bf had no complaints.  I will try it with Sriracha next time.
2. I like ginger, so I put more.  That ended up making the dish spicier.  I like spicy food, but this was like "Whoa."  I put about 3 teaspoons.  I'll stick to two.  =P
3. I added half an onion, which was great!  Next time, I will add more veggies like bell peppers and the whole onion.
4.  I will add more sugar.  I like mine sweeter.  I may double up on both the honey and sugar.
5. I dredged the chicken, but probably not enough.  Or I didn't cook the chicken enough.  I didn't get that crunch, but I wanted to stick to a "healthier" chicken, so it's probably better I didn't pan fry it any more than I did.
6. I used low sodium soy sauce.  
6.  I didn't taste any of it until it was served.  I will definitely taste before I serve next time!

I like this recipe because it allows you to do so much with it.  I'm excited to make it again soon.  =)

Turned out really good. I used flour (all purpose and corn starch) to coat the chicken as suggested by others. Had two chicken breasts. Added a crown of broccoli, one yellow pepper, and a large onion cubed. blanched, cooled and set aside broccoli. stir fried and set aside pepper and onions. Added veggies at the end. Made it to go with Jasmine rice, so added some water to keep thin gravy consistency. Added 2 tbs extra brown sugar and squeezed a lime at the end as I'd diluted the flavor with water. (Thinking, pineapple would also make good addition next time.)

This recipe is great. The only variation I made is I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy because my girlfriend hates soy sauce. I also dredged my chopped chicken pieces with flour & fried them on med-high heat to get the crispiness. It turned more into a stir fry but I actually love it this way

I doubled the sauce ingredients, and put it on low heat to simmer while I prepared everything else - just give it an occasional stir.  We really like heat, so I used scriracha for the hot sauce, and also crumbled about 4 Japanese dry seco peppers into my sauce.  I cut a red bell into strips and cooked that in a separate skillet before I started the chicken.  Per suggestions from other reviewers, I put my cut chicken in a zipper bag with some flour and shook it to blend before putting it into the skillet, and I think that helps the chicken hold the sauce.  When the chicken was done, I added my cooked bell pepper, poured the sauce over it all, stirred and left it on the stove for just a few minutes more, to make sure the bell peppers were properly warmed.  We loved it!

So happy this recipe came along in my inbox! My family really enjoyed it and I loved the simplicity of the ingredients! I used other reviewers suggestions and floured the chicken prior to frying. I fried long than suggested so it would be lightly browned on both sides, and I didn't need to have the sauce on long for if to be sticky perfection!

This dish is impossibly delicious!  After making it for my husband, he asked if I would make it again the very next day.  The flavor profile is delightful--sweet and spicy with a sticky twist.  Fresh ginger is a must.  Dredged the chicken in flour (2 tbs.) before browning, as recommended by other reviewers.  Next time I prepare it, I may add some broccoli but am little afraid to trifle with perfection.  Yum!

Made this last night.  A BIG hit!  I did have to change because I didn't have hot sauce, so I used 1 Tablespoon Red Chili Paste.  Also used 2 chicken breasts and then vegetables as we do not eat much grain.  Kept the sauce ingredient amounts as written and tossed in vegetables (snow peas, baby bok choy, broccoli, onion, a bit of red pepper) and steamed until the vegetables brightened in color.  Then served with tomato wedges.  Husband wanted to eat ALL of it.

I've made this many times - my children love it - I've made it for parties and served with toothpicks and have only had good feedback and have been asked to make it again the next time.  I flour the chicken first however to thicken it up quicker.

I used other reviewers' advice and coated the chicken with flour first, also cutting it in 1 inch pieces like you'd get from a Chinese restaurant. I also thought it had too much soy, would cut the amount next time, it overpowered the other flavors. Made a nice thick sauce right away without overcooking the chicken.

The frying of the chicken with the coating is a good idea, I used a mixture of 1/3 flour and 2/3 cornstarch for my coating, makes it crispier! Just thought I would pass that along.  I also add in Chopped (large chop) peppers red green what have to and sweet onion chunks, and some times pineapple.

Tried this tonight, husb & body builder son LOVED it! I used ingredients as written but w/the suggestion to dredge chicken in flour. I cubed the breasts & tossed in a flour & cornstarch combo. Yep, a gummy mess, so I separated the pieces onto 2 plates, sifted a bit more flour over top & let it rest while I finished prep. I sauteed red pepper & onion & set it aside. I doubled the sauce & warmed it over a low flame. I don't think it was the hot sauce, but the fresh ginger that gave it a dragon's bite. Next time I'll cut down on the ginger. I toasted sesame seeds & set them aside, then used the pan to get = parts olive oil & butter shimmering hot & put 1/2 the chicken in the pan. I did NOT throw it in but placed it so there was space around each piece. I cooked it over med high, not disturbing it until the bottom was brown & firm before turning it over. I did not begin to 'stir-fry' until all sides were crisp & the chicken mostly cooked. I repeated with the rest of the chicken after adding more olive oil & butter. Combined the chicken & added about 1/3 of the sauce, cooked & stirred until it was 'sticky'. Added another 1/3 of the sauce, cooked & stirred, then I added the vegetables, the final 1/3 of the sauce & let it cook down just a bit. I sprinkled w/ sesame seeds & green onion, served over plain rice. Next time I'll stir in fresh pineapple at the end & use less soy & some juice. My son used sauce left in pan to cook MORE chicken w/ LandoLakes saute cubes + olive oil-YUM too!

Very good the only change we made was to add 2x+ more chile for our taste and used teriyaki instead of soy we were out of soy.We'll be making again also it was quick and easy.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but after reading the comments, couldn't you use cornstarch to thicken the sauce?

This was quite easy and quick, and really tasty! I put the chicken pieces in a bag with flour to coat, browned them and then did the sauce separately. Went with 1 tbsp of siracha and 1 tbsp of Frank's Hot Sauce and it gave it the perfect amount of kick for our liking. I didnt have honey so instead of two tbsp honey, I just used 1 tbsp of pure maple syrup and 1 tbsp of molasses. That gave it some sweetness and stickiness. I also had a tube of lemon grass paste so I added 1 tsp of that to it too. I had no problem with the consistency of the sauce, it reduced perfectly and then I added the chicken back in and threw in some peanuts. Served it with jasmine rice and green beans. My wife and both kids loved it. Thanks Kate, great recipe!

But...cut chicken into chunks, lightly flour, and cook. Set aside. Make sauce separately and reduce. Then pour onto chicken and warm together. Since I made this for little ones I left out hot sauce, halved ginger and garlic, and used only 2 tbsp of soy. It was the best chicken I've ever made! Would like to make sauce spicier as in recipe and serve as chicken bites appetizer.

Lightened up on the spice because I have 2 young children. I used ground ginger because that is what I have at home. I dredged my chicken in flour first based on what other reviewers wrote.  Mine was VERY sticky! I am not sure that this step was necessary based on how mine came out. Regardless, flavor was good!

I'm not sure what to make of the taste.  It's certainly not Asian---more like chicken with soy sauce.  Served this to my family, and was met with polite silence.

This is an excellent recipe, however it is not new. I have been making it for years under "Sticky Spicy Sweet Chicken." The only difference is this recipe lists simply "hot sauce" rather than Sriacha sauce. The only problem I have is that it never gets sticky!!!!! I dry my chicken, use less oil, still no sticky. Otherwise, full stars for awesomeness!

I made this dish and it turned out really good BUT if you are not big on really spicy dishes you might want to cut the hotsauce back to one tablespoon. I used Siracha sauce and it turned out SUPER SPICY (like make your nose run spicy).  I could hardly get past the heat to taste the sweet. I also noticed some others said they had trouble getting the sauce to thicken up but I didn't have much trouble with that but I did mix a little corn starch and water and added to it and it thickened it up even more. Overall very good recipe but VERY SPICY in my opinion.

I followed Molly’s advice and made twice as much sauce which was wonderful for the fried rice I served with the chicken.  This was a little too spicy for my husband, but it was still very good and I would make it again, just cutting back on the spice to keep the hubby happy.

Delicious. My husband loved it. If followed the suggestion and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking.  I also used three chicken breasts and added a red bell pepper. It added color and more flavor.

I Followed this recipe exactly as it asked for, except I let it simmer covered in a sauce pan like other reviews suggested while I was browning the chicken to make the sauce thick. Also we only used half the suggested serving of Sriracha since we like the taste, just not the spice. It was wonderful. My boyfriend, the pickiest eatter in the entire world loved it!

I cut the chicken into small pieces, and reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1/8 a cup because my mom isn't a fan of salty foods. It turned out delicious! I noticed a lot of people complained about it not being good "Asian" food, or a poor replica, but in my experience it's always better to just expect it to taste like chicken, instead of Asian styled chicken. (I'm a high school student at a boarding school.) As a regular chicken dish, it's great!!

We enjoyed this very much. The sauce did reduce within the recommended cooking time, but I couldn't achieve the glossy/glazed look shown in the picture, nor was it remotely sticky. I used low sodium soy sauce and did not salt the chicken before stir-frying, so we did not find it too salty. I used Sriracha as the hot sauce and it was perfect.

This was delicious. I completely forgot the whole flour step so the sause never really thickened. However I find that I liked it better this way so I could pour the sause all over the sticky rice I made to go with this. But this was easy, fast, and SO GOOD.

This was indeed very good, but as others mentioned, this is on the salty side.  Next time I will use reduced-sodium soy sauce.  I used Sriracha sauce for the hot sauce, which added a nice heat. There were also a couple of reviewers who remarked the sauce was thin, and that was my initial reaction, but I turned up the heat to allow the sauce to come to a nice bubbly boil, and soon enough the sauce thickened nicely. I was hesitant to serve this to my sweetheart as he is spice shy, but surprise, he loved it and actually went back for seconds. I will definitely be making this again!

If you don't know your hot sauce, do a taste test after the first tbsp.  Because mine was unbearably hot. So I ended up adding some pineapple juice and a little bit of water to neutralize it. Also added an extra tbsp of brown sugar and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking it. It turned out amazing!

Incredible. Dredged the chicken in flour, as previous reviews suggested and didn't have any problems getting the sauce to thicken up. I might go a little lighter on the hot sauce next time. Depending on the sauce you use, 2 tbsp might be a little overpowering

4.5 stars - Very Good and quick supper. Added peppers and green onions as another review mentioned. You could add a good variety of vegetables and make it interesting.

The picky eaters in my house LOVE this. I used thighs instead of breasts. Glad to have something new to add to my arsenal.

I added more sauce and added some Annie Chun's Pad Thai Sauce.  Loved it and will make again.  So many possible variations.

We loved this! I used ground ginger and minced garlic, dredged the chicken strips in flour and then cooked it in coconut oil and put it over rice. Another reviewer recommended using Sriracha for the hot sauce, and I concur!! The only thing I will change next time is to chop the chicken into smaller pieces. Good stuff!!

I made this dish for my family & they loved it!  I've added it to my recipe box & will definitely make it again.  Like prior reviews I lighted coated my chicken in flour which helped to thicken the sauce.  I also sautéed some fresh broccoli, carrots, and some red & yellow peppers and added them at the end.  The veggies brought a colorfulness & crispness to the dish that helped to enhance the flavor & presentation of my masterpiece ??

Good flavor combo, just watch it! Turn it down when you add the sauce and DON'T LET IT BURN!!! This happens very easily, it turns out. I used chicken thighs instead and dredged them as recommended, very good texture and flavor, definitely sweet, spicy and sticky.  Can't wait to try this again cooked at a lower temp!!

Quick, easy and tasty! I had boneless chicken breasts, no plan for what to do with them to make dinner and about 30 min to pull it all together. Tried this recipe with some tiny modifications suggested by other reviewers: I did toss chunks of chicken with flour, salt and pepper before sautéing in oil in 2 batches on med/high. I removed the first batch to cook the second, then returned to skillet and proceeded to add sauce, stirred to coat and cooked covered for about 15 min on low heat. I had no fresh ginger on hand but did have crystallized ginger so I chopped some up into fine dice and used 2 tablespoons of that along with 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I served it over rice and my husband loved it. Will definitely be making again!

Sweet and Spicey!!!  If you want it sticky, follow the suggestions from other reviewers because it does not come out sticky which was fine with me.  I added green beans to mine because I had some that I needed to use.

*update* 
Used recipe again today and this time I used equal parts of honey (added a bit more honey), brown sugar, spice, and soy sauce and this way it did come out a bit sticky which for some reason was more appealing to me.  Wonderful recipe.

I lightly dredged the chicken in flour. I would also have liked it more spicy. I had no problems with the sauce thickening, probably because I coated the chicken. Overall not bad, I would make it again.

OMG! I don't like stuff that is too sweet, so I cooked this for my family and expected not to like it myself, but it was delicious! I used reduced-salt soy sauce and it was salty enough. The fresh ginger and garlic are key.

Following the advice of others, I cut the soy sauce to less than 1/4, I used a thai hot sauce 'Siracha' - only 1 tbs, used 1/3 tsp dried ginger. After tasting, it had a lot of heat, too much. So I added more honey. That tasted better. After putting the sauce over the chicken in the wok, I could really smell the heat. So I got out a cutie (tangerine) and quickly squeezed the juice of four slices into the sauce. That made all the difference. Toned the heat and somehow combined the flavors. Not wanting to wait for a reduction and chance drying out the chicken, I put in cornstarch for instant thickening. Really good. Chicken came out perfect, sauce was tasty and no leftovers. I too added sliced vegetables for added color and flavor. Thanks for a great base recipe.

This was good! First I sauteed sliced celery and onion, and set it aside. Then I cooked the sauce to thicken a bit, added the chicken and cooked for about 3 minutes, then put the veggies back in. Served over white rice. Delicious!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and coated the chicken strips in a flour-just placed about 1/2 cup in a zip lock bag with salt and pepper, added the chicken and shook- simple and quick.  After browning the chicken I removed it from the pan and then added the sauce ingredients (using low sodium soy sauce)  which I DOUBLED.  I let it boil for a few minutes and it seemed to thicken too much so I added about 1/4 cup of apple juice.  Added the chicken, covered and cooked for about 10 minutes.  The chicken was fabulous and my family of 5 loved it-almost an impossibility my household!

Sweet and just the right spicy!  Wasn't thick but I was using it for a stir fry so that was ok.

This was a big hit I love it when something is so good my husband wants seconds.I am not a big fan of too spicy so  I just used a pinch of red pepper flakes.I also added whole string beans and served it on Jasmine rice.

This was wonderful! I did combine 1/4 cup cornstarch with the salt and pepper in a plastic bag, added the chicken (cut into 1" cubes)and shook it all together due to the advice of others about thickening the sauce.  Also, I'm not a fan of "spicy" so I used Sweet Chili sauce instead of hot sauce. I'd say my sauce was close to jelly like in consistency which was perfect for us. I didn't find this dish dry not the sauce too thick nor too thin. I'll make it again, just this way.

Excellent! I mixed the sauce the night before to save time before my potluck the next day. I also shook my chicken pieces in corn starch as other readers suggested.  It was so good!  I will keep this recipe for sure!  My potluck was Sweet & Spicy themed for Valentines. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Good flavor! Added a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. Was quite spicy- add hot sauce judiciously. Would be good with bell peppers, carrots, and sugar snap peas! We put cashews on top too! A winner!

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was that I fully cooked the chicken and then took it out of the pan to start cooking the sauce. Since I fully cooked the chicken first, I seasoned it with salt, pepper, ground ginger, and some red pepper flakes while it was cooking.  I did not dredge the chicken in flour as other reviewers had suggested so the sauce was not very thick or sticky but it was really delicious!! I was surprised at how quick and easy the recipe was. This will definitely be a regular weekly meal in my house!

Definitely a new stable in the rotation! I used too much soy sauce and it was tough to get it to thicken to that nice sticky texture. Next time I might remove the chicken so it doesn't get too dry and then really let the  sauce thicken.

I altered this recipe a little for my taste. I used half of the ginger and hot sauce, added a little bit extra honey and brown sugar. Also added a pinch of white sugar. I took others advice and lightly coated the chicken before frying. I also added red, yellow, orange and green peppers to it. Awesome recipe. I will make this again. A bit spicy still but not overly.

Because I'm gluten free....I cut the chicken up then tossed it in a 1lb ziplock bag with gluten free flour. Then added salt and pepper once I put it in the med/high pan with oil. After that, continued the recipe as normal. However I steamed green beans then added to the chicken. Put it over a bed of rice and voile!!! Amazing!!!

Made this recipe last night and we loved it. Took the advice of the many reviews I read and dredged the chicken in flour first before cooking. I halved the hot sauce as we are not huge hot sauce lovers....should have used 1 tsp in total of the hot sauce as we are whimps in the hot sauce department! Still loved it even though my mouth was on fire :). Sauce thickened nicely as I added a touch of sweet chilli sauce for chicken while it was cooking (advice from another review). Served it on a bed of rice and it was wonderful.

Loved this recipe sprinkling flour on the cooked chicken then adding sauce like the other readers have mentioned is a must  I did double the sauce part and didn't time anything just let it cook till it was nice and sticky. The kids Loved it I did add extra hot sauce on top of the double sauce part. And I also freeze my ginger which helped me get it at a consistent cut which seemed to let the ginger flavor flow evenly though out the dish.((Full and HAPPY))

This sure was a great recipe! I used flour to coat the chicken, I put the sauce in a separate pot and got that ready for the chicken. Added the chicken to the hot sauce and simmered it for 8 mins. Goes great with seasoned rice.

I like this recipe because it's easily tweaked according to personal preference. I've made it a few times now, dredged with floor and not. I double the sauce, skip the extra salt, add more honey instead of the brown sugar, and sauté some onions in. I serve it with rice and salad, sometimes as lettuce wraps. Always good!

BOMBEST DISH EVER!!!! For the people who keep getting the Soy sauce flavor, sadly I didn't have any and put Teryaki sauce, MADE PERFECTION. If you like spicey food I used Tapatio 3 TBLS and it made it pretty hot. I also added chopped tomatoes to the sauce, made wonders. Have fun cooking.

The meal looks very BLACK because of the 1/4 cup soy sauce, so it's not an attractive dish at all. Important to understand that the sauce is merely homemade stir fry sauce. So if you already have a favorite stir fry sauce recipe or appreciate a bottled one, that'll work fine, and the dish will probably look alot better.

It was delicious , I dredged the chicken as other reviewers suggested and seared/browned the chicken before adding the sauce. I simmered the sauce while the chicken was cooking. Next time I will add extra honey to the sauce, I only added 1 tbsp. of hot sauce and it was plenty for my family. I Will definitely make it again. Thank you for this great recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times both in its original recipe and the slight change I made. I love spicy foods but  2 tbsp was way too much. Next time I halfed that amount and I omitted ginger since I couldnt find any. I also breaded the chicken in flour before frying and added green peppers. So so so so good and the sauce was thick and wonderful!

This was too hot for my taste.  I will make it again and decrease the hot sauce and ginger, and will add 2T of sweet chili sauce, which should make it a five star in my book.

I've made this recipe several times and have loved it each time. The first time, I put it over jasmine rice. The last two times I followed other's suggestions and dredged the chicken in flour before putting in the pan. I doubled the sauce part of the recipe but will half the does siracha as it was very spicy, but good. I took about half of the sauce before cooking and added some hot and sweet mustard and some sesame oil, salt and pepper and a little vinegar to make a vinaigrette. We served the chicken on salad with mandarin oranges, honey almonds, water chestnuts and topped with the dressing. It was fantastic!!!

Does not come out at all sticky or spicy, but is unbearably sweet. So there's that.

This was awesome. Sauted some onion & pepper and set aside. Dredged the chicken in flour before cooking. Everything else as is in the recipe. Used sriracha sauce. Served with rice & brocolli. Reminded us of general teak chicken.

As suggested by others, I dredged the chicken pieces in flour first. The sauce is extremely tasty and came out perfectly. I will definitely make this again! My fiancée loves it too!

I breaded the chicken as suggested ..and feel that is a great idea ..the sauce sticks to the chicken better. I took the chicken out ..and added some veggies to my wok..whatever I had on hand ..peppers etc.  Returned the chicken, added cashews ...and the sauce ..which I doubled. I used siracha for my hot sauce.  The sauce was a wee bit sweet...a wee bit sticky..and had a wee bite to it. It thickened with no trouble.  My only criticism ...too much soy sauce.. I would reduce that next time.  I will look over other reviews and see what others did next time ..and follow this advice.  It was a wee bit overpowering...and definitely use low sodium soy sauce!!

I love this dish.  I added flour to the chicken before frying it which allowed the sauce to thicken.  I left the ginger root out but it was still very good.

Delicious! I added Snow Peas and served over rice for a complete dinner.  I like spicy but it was a little too spicy.  I would half the hot sauce next time, but there will definitely be more next times!

Yummy! So good! I did flour the chicken along with some salt and pepper and seared on 7.5.  I then added the sauce along with some stir fried onions, red peppers, mushrooms and snow peas and let simmer for 8-10 min. Served over brown rice with edamame on the side... Will make time and time again with whatever veggies I have on hand.

This is a good recipe but as written way too spicy for my tastes.  The first time I made it I added the full 2 tbsp of hot sauce and it was difficult for me to eat....but I could tell I really liked the flavor of the sauce underlying the overwhelmingly (to me) spicy taste.  So I made it again with just 1/2 tbsp of hot sauce and really enjoyed it...would recommend this amount to anyone that is sensitive to really spicy foods but just wants a little extra kick.   I dredged the chicken in flour based on past reviews and had no problem with the sauce thickening.  I subbed ground ginger for the fresh (all I had on hand) and added sauteed peppers and onions.  This was really nice with rice and tasted just as good leftover too.

Wow. This was really good. The only thing I did differently was toss the chicken in flour, double the sauce, and add a sliced red pepper, and green onions. Served over white rice.  Delicious.

I did as others suggested and mixed in 3 T. of cornstarch with the chicken before cooking it. I also doubled the sauce and served it over brown rice. Added some green and red pepper strips, a sliced carrot, and half an onion.  Could have used more veggies and should have cut back on the hot sauce.  I like hot, but both my husband and I thought it was too much.

Sweet sticky spicy is my friend and my favorite recipe!!!! We have made it many, many times. I always double the sauce ingredients (except for the hot sauce) and usually add extra garlic, honey, and brown sugar. We've always had to add corn starch to the sauce to thicken it and always serve it over sticky rice. By far my favorite dish! YUM!

This is a really good recipe but like others, I did make some changes.  I did dredge the chicken in flour before I put it in the pan.  Before I did the chicken, I browned one large onion in the oil and then removed it from the pan.  I would recommend using more oil to brown the chicken if you dredge it in flour.  I doubled the sauce and would triple it next time.  I used more garlic and fresh ginger than it calls for.  I cooked some frozen edamame and some frozen stir fry veggies and then tossed it all in with the onion to the cooked chicken.  It is spicy so if you don't like it too hot, cut back on the sriracha.

Pretty good.  I did what others suggested & coated the chicken in flour.  We also don't like spicy so I omitted the hot sauce.  Definitely could double the sauce if you want more to pour over rice or veges.

Made this and had the family fighting for more. But I recommend all the substitutes. Specially to sauté the mushrooms and add cream of mushroom soup with the chicken broth. Oh I also delayed the cheese to the last 10 minutes and it was perfect.! My mom said she would lick the pan if I came down to it.!

Really good! Doubled the sauce, will have to triple next time.

ETA: We make this all the time now. I have several different hot sauces that we use with this and it changes everything just slightly. One is a Blackberry Habanero sauce and another is a Mango ghost pepper.

Sweet, sticky, spicy and delicious. I added a little more hot sauce (we like spicy), and chopped green pepper for awesomeness. Super easy great meal.

Excellent!  We dusted the chicken with flour as suggested before cooking and the sauce was nice and thick. Served with coconut Kefir lime rice, and asparagus with curry aoli. The whole meal was amazing!!!

We loved it.  I followed rebecca's suggestion to simmer the sauce while preparing the chicken, which I dredged in flour and browned quickly.

This was freaking AWESOME!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and coated the chicken in flour prior to cooking as well as using low sodium soy sauce. I boiled some frozen asian veggies and added them at the very end just to coat with the sauce.  Served over brown rice.  Re-heated well the next day too.  Will definitely make again.

Definitely delicious and easy. I fried the chicken pieces a little bit and than added the sauce. You have to double the sauce. Next time i will vegetables to give a little more stir-fry feel.

I really liked this recipe. It had good flavor. Worked out to be both sweet and spicy for me. I had dredged the chicken in flour like other reviews had suggested and I wouldn't do that again. I feel that dredging the chicken in cornstarch would have worked out better; flour made the suace chunky and just not pleasant. Using cornstarch you will still get the crispyness on the chicken and good thickness on the sauce, plus it will look better.

The taste of this is very good, but I recommend the following:
*Double the sauce, and mix it up in a separate saucepan. *In a portion of the soy sauce, mix in a little bit of corn starch and add to remaining ingredients to thicken. *Dredge chicken in flour and cook in stir-fry until just done. for whatever reason it seems my chicken comes out a lot more tender from the wok
*stir-fry the veggies of your choice and mix in with the chicken for the last step! We used onions and red peppers cut into small squares. Toasted nuts coordinate really nicely too (walnuts, cashews)
*If you do not want it spicy, simply omit the hot/chili sauce. If you don't have fresh ginger, powdered ginger will do. 
ENJOY! This is a meal that is very quick and easy once you have everything prepped.

I increased the ingredients to make six servings, but the sauce didn't thicken. I just turned the fire off right now and I'm hoping it thickens with the fire being off. Other than that I tasted the sauce and it's both sweet and hot as I expected. :)

This was a GREAT base for Sweet and spicy chicken. I also made the sauce on the side while I pan seared the chicken. I DID NOT add ginger, but instead added Apple Cider vinegar. I also added buffalo wing sauce, since I didnt have regular hot sauce on hand. When I was searing the chicken I added crushed red peppers for added spice. There was no rhyme or reason behind my measurements, I added brown sugar and honey and soy sauce until I had the flavor I liked.

Loved this recipe, for my first attempt I changed a few bit and took some other reviewers options to. I used the flour on the chicken and I doubled up the sauce. Turned out fantastic, full of flavour. I added some five spice and some chilli powder instead of hot sauce.  Will definitely be making this again

Super easy and very tasty. Wasn't sticky like everyone else said. I used Gluten free Soy Sauce so it was more gingery than soy sauce flavoured. LOVED IT!

The only substitution that I made to this recipe was to add ground red pepper since I didn't have any hot sauce.  The sauce was thick.  The dish was very good.  My kids went back for 2nds and 3rds.

Delicious!  Based on past reviews, I dredged the chicken in flour before frying - it thickened the sauce perfectly. I also cut the hot sauce to a little less than half, which was plenty hot. My family loved it!

I made this tonight, and we like hot food, but this was almost too hot to eat... and I used half the amount of ginger and garlic it called for.  I used the garlic and ginger found in the tubes in the produce section.  I used 1 T tabasco sauce and 1 T of chili paste found in the Asian food section.  Threw in some frozen green beans after chicken was cooked but before I added the sauce.  I mixed the sauce in my mini Cuisinart, and after tasting it and knowing I was in trouble added some Agave. I had no problem with the sauce thickening, but I do use a high heat. Served over wild rice with side of fresh pineapple which helped offset the heat.  I would add this to my dinner rotation, but will try cutting back on the chili paste and tabasco until I get a good amount of heat without hitting the blistering mark.

I made this last week. I am a very picky eater, and my husband and I really liked it! It's not spicy at all in my opinion, but still very good. I served it with white rice, and my husband didn't care for it with the white rice, so I will be trying to find a new side to go along with it. I will definitely make this again.

It tasted good, but by following the recipe it was border line too hot for my family. decided when we do it again, to cut the hot sauce in 1/2 and maybe even a little less soy sauce. It was a little salty for my taste.

Loved this! I followed other suggestions a bit. Dredged chicken cubes in mix of flour & cornstarch (ancient Chinese secret). Seared in batches and set aside. In same pan, briefly stir fried one ea red and yellow pepper, 2 green peppers, some pea pods and onion - all roughly chopped. Increased sauce ingredients by half except for hot sauce - mistake! I thought it would be way too hot with 2 Tbsp so reduced to 1 Tbsp and I lost the heat. Added some red pepper flakes to make up for it but will stay with 2 Tbsp hot sauce next time. Dish was wonderfully sticky! Balance of sweet and hot was a little low, but that is just adjusting. Thanks for the recipe! Tasted like take out!

Definately lived up to its name - sweet, sticky and spicy - just like a dish from a good Chinese place. Made small changes per other reviewers: 1) cut chicken into chunks and coated with flour w salt and pepper. 2) cooked chicken nearly through then added sauce which thickened & carmelized quickly (and would have scorched if not on medium heat).  It was *sticky* not saucy which I liked.  VERY good flavor to the sauce. Glad I used low sodium soy though.

good recipe base. Adjust seasonings to your own taste and if you like saucy I would double the sauce amount.

This was the best chinese tasting food that I have made.  I did flour and corn starch the chicken before frying like other suggested.  Turned out so good.

I used 1 teaspoon or crushed red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce, just because I didn't have any available.....but it was alittle too spicy for us, my own fault! I also floured the chicken as others suggested. It's a great recipe, and easy to make.  Other then it being too spicy for us, I would try it again.

Dredged the chicken in seasoned flour. Forgot the ginger and hot sauce .... But it was still awesome! Added a touch of sesame oil because let's face it.... Everything is better with sesame oil.  My son gave it an A+.  And it was very sticky. The sauce really thickened up.  Sssooooooo good! This one goes in the rotation.

It was really delicious and easy to make. However, there is an overwhelming soy sauce flavor like some others said. I would put less soy sauce.

This was very good, just the right level of sweetness and spice. I actually doubled the sauce and simmered it a bit before I added it to the chicken to make sure it thickened enough and became sticky. I also chopped up some onion and yellow pepper and tossed it in with the chicken. Served it over some rice. Delicious!

We tried this for dinner tonight and had to use ground ginger because we were out of fresh.  It has an AWESOME flavor BUT we used 2 Tablespoons of Sriracha hot sauce it was awfully hot.  Next time, we'll start with 2 TEAspoons and go from there.

Fantastic!  Super easy and very tasty.  I substituted asian garlic chili sauce the spicy variety for half the hot sauce, next time I'll sub for all.  I used a tsp of the chili sauce to replace the tbsp of hot sauce but you can do it to taste +/-.

This recipe was definitely a good base if you lack the creativity to come up with dinner ideas (like I do)! I wish I'd read about the flour beforehand but nonetheless it came out very tasty!!  I had to continue to season to taste by adding more honey, ginger and garlic. I also sautéed some carrots and spinach in olive oil first and set them aside while I browned my chicken. It was YUMMY!! I'll definitely make this again!

We enjoyed this recipe for the most part. I simmered the sauce as per other ppl's advice in a separate pot while chicken was cooking and it thickened up nicely. I used Frank's hot sauce and it seemed to take over the sweet part and the ginger. Next time I will add a bit more of both and see what happens.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made this for dinner tonight, and my family LOVED it (even the 3 year old)!  Since the kids were eating this, I only used 1 Tbsp. of sriracha (hubby and I added more to our bowls).  I took the advice of other reviewers and dredged bite-size pieces of chicken in flour before cooking.  Prior to cooking the chicken, I sauteed some red and green peppers and onions in the oil and then removed.  Then I added the chicken to the same pan with a little more oil, cooked and removed.  I added the sauce to the pan until thickened and garlic was cooked, and then mixed in the veggies and chicken. Served this with homemade fried rice.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks Kate!

I've made this twice now - once as written and it's delicious. I did thicken the sauce.  Second time I totally cheated and added bourbon, then reduced the sauce, poured over cooked chicken and warmed with some chopped broccoli, snow peas and zucchini. Quick Bourbon Chicken! Both times I only had powdered ginger. Thanks for posting! Whole family loved it

This recipe is so easy and very delicious. I used chicken tenders and lightly breaded them. After I cooked the chicken I cut the tenders into pieces after cooling. I then followed the recipe exactly as written and served with rice and broccoli. The whole family loved it.. Thank you

I decreased the amount of chicken and added carrots,broccoli, and peas. I also doubled the amount of sauce and thickened it up with a bit of corn starch. It's delicious this way especially the broccoli!

My brother and I made this recipe today! WE love it! We read some reviews on it before we started and coated the chicken with flour as many of them suggested. We seasoned our flour with salt, black pepper, panko breadcrums, and onion powder. Also, to the sauce we added worcestershire sauce and chrushed red pepper seeds. For our hotsauce we used Tabasco and Louisiana habanero hotsauce! Just warning it's pretty spicy!

Very tasty and super easy to make. I did follow suggestions to double the sauce and used 2 cut up chicken breasts. I didn't have "hot sauce" so I just sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper. I did coat the chicken in flour then lightly cook in a tbsp of veg oil then poured sauce mixture in pan and cooked over med heat for about 4-5 min. It was enough time to cook the bite-sized chicken pieces and thicken the sauce. The sauce was good and turned out like a glaze kinda, stuck to the chicken perfectly too. Served over rice. It was a hit with the whole family (even the picky toddler)!

I had a roasted chicken still in the fridge and wanted to do something with it so I tried this. Good flavor, I'll try flour or something to dredge it up because the sauce didn't thick up. Would make again.

overall, a great family recipe, really suited our fancies. Maybe a slight bit too much hot sauce, so we might cut it down to a tbs. & 1/2 next time. Noticeing people said the sauce didnt thicken, we also elimated excess chicken juice, which did improve quality of the sauce. it was quite a delectable dish; highly recommended :) (screw the negative people we loved it!)

Very picky husband and kids absolutely love this recipe! Following other advise I added everything (except the chicken) to a saucepan to simmer and reduce while I prepared the chicken. I also found the recipe a little salty so I cut back a bit on the soy sauce. I floured the chicken and browned it in the skillet before adding the sauce. Delicious!!!

This recipe is a keeper. For the hot sauce part, I used Tobasco sauce and I only used half a tablespoon and it was still SUPER hot (for me anyway). This recipe is a keeper! I might try squeezing some orange juice in it next time, or even lemon to add a little more oomph. This is a fun recipe -- great as is, or fun to tinker with!

This is Awsome!!!! I decided to make this before reading reviews and I followed the recipe as written. It's out of this world. I not only reduced the sauce until thick, but I cooked it down until all of the sauce coated the chicken. At first, I thought the soy sauce was going to be over powering because it had a strong smell. So, wrong! with the hot sauce and brown sugar it blended just right with a "sweet and spicy" taste.

Good flavour but not very sticky.  I was out of honey and used molasses instead.  I also used ground ginger and garlic powder.  Will try it again.

OH my goodness what a hit this was! I had some left over strip steak that I cut up in tiny slices and added to this last minute and wow.  My husband absolutely flipped for this.  So easy too.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

Made up a huge batch for my friends. Sauce tasted good, but wasn't as thick as it should of been. Even though 8 chicken breasts worth of juices makes it harder to thicken, I think simmering the sauce in a different pan while cooking the chicken would help it some.

Made this tonight, followed the advice to coat chicken in corn starch and then added another teaspoon when sauce was cooking. Doubled the sauce recipe but only added 3 tsps of Sirachi sauce, still too hot for my family so will cut back to 2 tsps next time. Other than that, I was told it was restaurant quality. Served with Jasmine rice and green beans. Will definately make again.

I doubled this recipe because i had several chicken thighs and i also followed the advice of some other reviewers by flouring the chicken first and cooking the chicken a little longer than 1-2 minutes before adding the sauce.  I did omit the ginger but only because i didn't have it.  This recipe reminds me of General Tso's chicken.  Next time i'll add some red pepper flakes to turn up the heat and make a copycat General Tso's!  Thanks for posting i think it's great.

5-28-2013 - I loved this recipe.  I veganized it with Gardein chik'n strips and used agave nectar instead of honey.  I thought it was fabulous.  Since my husband is not too crazy about spicy food, I cut down the hot sauce to half.  Other than that and that I coated the chikn strips with flour, it was a great recipe.  I highly recommend it.

I liked the recipe, but didnt love it.  I think with some changes I will love it! Im not a fan of making changes then giving a less than 5 start rating, but tonight I rate it a 4 star simply because it was too sweet for me. For my taste the sauce was very sweet, too sweet. And I like sweets! I followed others recommendations and dredged the chicken in flour then cooked in oil, which I also used more of to get a brown crisp coating on the chicken. The sauce consistency came out great, and Im glad that used flour. I also used ground dried ginger instead of fresh. Next time I make this there will be some changes that I can make to cut some of the sweetness.  I will cut the honey in half, add a little less soy sauce and replace the portion left out with water and or vinegar. My husband loved this, I will certainly be making this again and again!

Quite flavorful but a little salty. Next time I'll cut back on the salt or use low sodium soy sauce. Also, goes great with a basil leaf garnish!

I have made this recipe so often that I don't even look at the recipe anymore.  It is a staple dinner in our house now.  I have made a few tiny tweaks to the recipe.  I, like other readers use low sodium soy sauce and I do not season my chicken before cooking - plenty of salt in the recipe.  I also add a little more honey and brown sugar as I haven't found the recipe to be "sticky".  I have also found that you need to be aware of the hot sauce that you use - some are more intense than others so taste, taste, taste.  I add lightly unsalted or lightly salted peanuts right at the end of cooking.  I would love to add some pea pods and other veggies but I have a picky eater to contend with.  I would suggest making this recipe as is once and then taking liberty with the recipes as you like - the base recipe is very good and worth trying as is.

This is a great recipe.  And with AllRecipes I was able to cut it down to one serving.  I steamed some rice and put it in a bowl.  Made the chicken and sauce and poured it over the rice.  At first I thought the soy sauce was overpowering but it wasn't the soy sauce it was the hot sauce.  This was um, um good.

Great recipe and super easy...even after 2 martinis! I used boneless thighs and added 1 step. Dredged the strips in flour before browning. It came out sweet, sticky and a little spicy.

I used chicken thighs and put them in the crock pot. Poured the sauce over it and let is cook for about 8 hours on low. After about 5 hours I added a bag of stir fry veggies. The sauce came out thin (expected that) but we didn't mind because the flavor was great! Will make that again.

Overall, the recipe is good, but could be better.  I agree with other users that the chicken should be dredged in flour before frying.  One thing I would change is to reduce the soy sauce and increase the honey.  The soy sauce flavor is a little too strong, and the recipe is not very sweet.

Amazing taste!  The wife and I enjoyed it a lot.  Too spicy for the kid.  Took the advice of the comments and went with siracha hot sauce and I left out the ginger.  Floured the chicken.  and everything turned out great.  Steamed broccoli and carrots.  Would add pic but cant figure it out.  A must try.

This was almost a 5!  I thought it had a little bit too much soy sauce but that could be because I reduced the sauce down.. made it a more concentrated taste.  I also floured the chicken before sauteing... TOO MUCH WORK cuz I used boneless thighs cut into nuggets and there was a LOT.  I am going to try this again, because the family went DING DONG over it.. but I am gonna try it exactly as written (but with 1/8 tsp powdered ginger cuz in case you didn't know, that's the powdered equivalent).  I will also reduce the soy just a bit. I served this with Jasmine rice.. (so goooood!) and roasted green beans.  TY for a really good meal idea!

Delish! Even my picky 6-year old love it! Only thing I'll do differently next time is make more of the sauce. However, based on other reviewers comments, I think I'll remove the chicken first so it doesn't get soggy. Enjoy!

Love this.  Did cut back a little on the hot sauce but other than that followed the recipe.  Shared with my son and it's now his favorite chicken recipe.

This recipe is awesome! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it ended up being really spicy. It was still very good, but a bit too hot for me. My boyfriend loved it though. So we made it again and doubled everything except the hot sauce and it had the right amount of heat for me. I did throw in a little more than 2 tablespoons of the hot sauce for the second round. My boyfriend instantly requested this recipe be made again.

This recipe is very tasty with a nice spiciness to it.  I didn't have a difficult time getting the sauce to thicken, but coating the chicken with flour, as many have suggested is a great idea.  Next time I make this, I will definitely add a variety of vegetables, as I like crunchy with the spicy and sweetness of the chicken.  Add some store bought spring rolls or egg rolls, fried rice or regular white rice and you'll have a yummy Chinese dinner!

Pretty good! I'm sure we'll make this again. We don't care for ginger so we didn't include it. And I mixed 3T of corn starch with some cold water and coated the chicken with it before browning it. We also doubled the sauce, except didn't double the soy sauce. It could have used more soy sauce though.

Outstanding recipe!  Served with sesame ginger rice and roasted brussels sprouts, makes a delicious meal!  I did what others suggested and dredged chicken in seasoned flour before browning.  I used Tabasco for the hot sauce and it was Very spicy (which was the with me).  But if you are seeking a less spicy version, either use Frank's Hot Sauce, which is not as hot as Tabasco, or cut the Tabasco in half.

Great!  Followed other helpful reviews and lightly floured the chicken before browning.  Started heating the sauce while prepping the chicken so it has more time to heat and thicken.  Garnished with green onion and cashews.

Ohhhhhh Soooo Goood!!!! Love this recipe, although not too sticky AMAZING flavor! I used less sodium soy sauce to make it less salty! The hot sauce is just the right amount to give you little bit of flare at the end!!!
Love this recipe!!!!!

I followed several reviewers' suggestion and dredged the chicken in flour mixed with the salt and pepper. I then sauteed the chicken in my wok until browned and removed it to a bowl. I then sauteed red peppers and onions until crisp-tender, then removed it to the bowl and cooked the sauce for a minute or two before adding the chicken, peppers and onions back in. For the sauce, I used ginger powder and tabasco sauce, as that's what I had on hand. I also used 2 T of dark brown sugar. It came out with a nice flavor that had just a bit of a kick.

My whole family enjoyed it, which is saying something. Following the reviews I read, I rolled the chicken pieces in flour (seasoned with salt and pepper) before cooking in the oil. I left out the hot sauce, since no one but me likes spicy food, and only had about 3 Tbsps of soy sauce, but I added a little water to the pan, along with some vegetables, covered it while the chicken finished cooking, and added the sauce at the end. Not bad.

My family loved this recipe. I followed it exactly except for the ginger root, which I didn't have. I added 1 teaspoon of ground ginger instead. I used Sriracha Chili Sauce(rooster on bottle) for the hot sauce and it was spicy! We wanted more of the sauce so next time I will double the sauce. Mine was sweet and spicy, not too sticky but GREAT! We served over white rice and had some veggies on the side. We will definitely be making again.

I really like this recipe and have to disagree with other other reviews that say to add flour.  It's just not as good - I've tried it both ways.  Definitely add real, fresh ginger root - it makes this recipe perfect.

One of the better recipes we've had in a while.  As suggested by others, we dredged the chicken in flour and black pepper.  Instead of the fresh root, we used commercially-available chopped ginger in a jar (not the pickled ginger). We did not add any hot sauce and I thought the ginger and black pepper was a good "spicy" flavor for my Midwest palate. Will definately make again and will double the sauce next time.  I think adding some carrots or broccoli would be nice too.

This was the best dish I've made in a while!  It is too spicy for the little ones.  Next time I will use 1 tbls Sirachi and a splash of orange juice for a little brightness.  Served with rice and sauteed onions, zucchini and carrots.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

As is, this recipe is good.  I plan to make it again with a few tweaks.  I think it needed less spice, slightly more sweet and a little more depth of flavor in the sauce.  This would be my suggestion; start by sauteing red and yellow peppers with a little garlic in the hot pan.  When 3/4 done, remove from pan and set aside.  Dredge chicken pieces in flour, salt and pepper.  Saute in hot pan until lightly browned.  Reduce hot sauce by half, add some pineapple juice and add some orange zest to the sauce.  I look forward to seeing how this would turn out with some enhancements.

Absolutely amazing.  This was great.  The only thing I changed was I double the sauce, because we like a little extra.  It is great!!  I made fried rice with veggies and it was perfect.  I had half of it ate before I made my way to the table.  Whole family will be asking for it again by next week.

Would've given it 4 1/2 stars because my only issue was it was very hot-spice wise for me. My husband on the other hand, loves it! He rants and raves about how amazing it is. Even had me make this for some of our friends when they visited; heard nothing but how great it was.

I added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper also and I'm glad I did because I don't think it would have been very spicy otherwise. Had a nice taste. Next though I think I will double the sauce because I breaded & fried my chicken. There was enough sauce to cover, but not leave some to mix with the rice. Overall I like the recipe. I also used ground ginger & minced garlic instead.

Quick and delicious! I used agave nectar instead of honey, and powdered ginger. Also coated the chicken in flour before cooking over medium high heat. It was a tad too salty; next time I will reduce the soy sauce. I sauteed carrots, onions, broccoli and green peppers in a separate pan, and then mixed them in the remaining sauce and served over rice. Definitely a keeper!

I made this tonight and OMG it was SO good! I followed the recipe exactly except I coated the chicken in flour. It came out nice and sticky. Don't use the whole 2 table spoons of hot sauce if you don't like spicy! I served it over yellow rice with steamed broccoli and everyone loved it including my 4 year old son. I can't wait to make this again!

Took out the chicken once it was browned and then used a bag of frozen veggies with the sauce...added one tablespoon cornstarch to the sauce to thicken and once the veggies were warmed through, added the chicken back for about 2 more mins. Taste of the sauce is very good

Very easy to make and tasted pretty good too, but like many other reviewers, my sauce never thickened and was not at all sticky. Coating the chicken in flour like other reviewers said sounds like a good idea. Still, it was tasty and I'd make again for a quick dinner. I used half the amount of hot sauce because I don't like a lot of heat, but I think I would have been ok with the 2 tbsp. I also used ground ginger, but no other changes.

Made it as written and it was way to hot for our Midwestern palettes!  Still loved the flavor, though.  Cut back on the hot sauce the next time I made it.  I also TRIPLED the sauce and let it really reduce while simmering.  Another change I made in subsequent tries, was to flour the chicken pieces and fry them in a bit of oil to crisp them up a bit. This has been a good addition to my menu planning.

Awesome on a snowy day in Minnesota! I doubled the sauce and reduced it and then added the browned chicken as other reviewers suggested. Thank you Kate for a simple and tasty recipe.

used as a base for a stir fry.  wasn't sticky or spicy but I liked the flavor and I would make it again.  stir fried chicken first and set aside.  stir fried onion, red pepper, baby bok choy, and bean sprouts next.  added chicken and sauce.  served over rice.

Fixed this for dinner last nite, served over rice and it was a hit! Husband and granddaughters both agree..it's a keeper! Only thing I did different was cut the hot sauce to 1 tbls for tender palates. Next time, I will double the sauce ingredients, maybe add even more garlic and ginger and keep the hot sauce to 1 tbls, increasing as needed for the heat.Would have been great to have extra sauce for the rice.

Good recipe. I have an idea, for those of you with dry meat that works for me. Coat the chicken with 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon white pepper. Let the chicken stand 30 minutes at room temperature. Using a wok makes it easy to cook using high heat. I use a sweet soy sauce which is like syrup (half the sodium content) and helps to thicken up the sauce faster. Up for your consideration try using crushed red peppers in place of the hot sauce and a few chopped green onions for a garnish.  Thanks for the recipe Kate. :) iota

Whoever says that this recipe has no taste or texture isn't following the directions.  The only change I made was lightly flouring the chicken, other than that is one of the most deliciously easy meals I make, and it's always a hit.  Love love love this chicken!!

Made this with Sriracha as the hot sauce (I tend to cut down spiciness, so I used a bit less than the recipe calls for). Awesome, very flavorful and good over some simple rice.

As other reviewers suggested, I dredged in flour before frying.  I also used 1T Sriracha instead of the hot sauce.  Was not n' spicy... but not overly so, and DELICIOUS!!!!!  Definitely will make again, often.

This. Stuff.  Rocked.  I mean seriously rocked.  We love spicy food and YIKES!  this was *almost* too spicy for me (hubby had no problem though).  Next time, I might scale hot sauce back to just 1 1/2T (hubby leans over and sez no).  I did scale back on the soy sauce to less than 1/4 cup (eyeballed it - about a finger under line in my measuring cup), used low sodium soy sauce, rooster hot sauce (can't ever spell name of this stuff, but you know what I mean) and dredged chicken in flour before sauteeing.  Served over steamed white rice with sauteed onions & broccoli on side.  Delish!  Oh - and we just used 1 large chicken breast (cubed then seared) as it was just the 2 of us.

I recently tried this out with my roommates and it was AWESOME! However, just because I felt like it, I used rooster sauce instead of tabasco or some other hot sauce. Spicy, spicy but not so much that you couldn't enjoy the other flavors.

Was perfect and easy! Great for a work night! 

Only made a few modifications based on the other reviewers. Dredging the chicken in flour/salt/pepper first. And I used low sodium soy sauce (we don't like things salty) and the Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (Rooster Sauce).  This type of hot sauce was perfect balance for the recipe. Although it was a little spicy for me with 2tbs. I may only use 1tbs next time I make it.

Thanks for sharing! Loved it!

I've used this recipie with chicken and brussel sprouts.  Both are delish!  To cut the sodium I use brags liquid aminos, it tastes like soy but has no added salt.  As other reviewers have commented, you  either need some flour or be prepared to cook the sauce for 20 min on high heat for this to become sticky.  But it's completely worth it.  I prefer eating it with quinoa but it's also good with rice.  If you like lots of flavor and spice, make as listed but add some flour to the sauce to thicken.  This is my go to recipe whenever I crave Chinese food.

The sauce didn't thicken.  I browned the meat, removed it from the pan and added the sauce (which I doubled) to let it simmer a while to help in thickening it.  Even added some cornstarch but it still never thickened.  Added the chicken back after about 8 minutes.  A couple minutes before it was ready I added broccoli that I had just steamed in the microwave.  I cut the hot sauce (rooster sauce) down by half and it was still too spicy for the kids- not for hubs and me though!  We liked the flavor, will likely make again ( it is easy) but it wasn't WOW.

This recipe made me nervous after reading some of the other reviews, but it turned out perfectly. I took the advice of some of the others and dredged the chicken in flour. At the end of the cooking time I turned the heat up to help the sauce thicken. My husband couldn't stop talking about it.

I doubled this recipe and had to add a little more brown sugar but it was a surprise hit.  It was nice to make Chinese food. :)  I did dredge the chicken in flour like other users did also.

I love spicy food, but with the amount of hot sauce recommended plus the ginger and garlic, it was a bit hot for others and even me.  The second time I made it, I was stingy on the ginger and used just over half the recommended hot sauce (Frank's Red Hot) and it was delish!  I served it with instant jasmine rice (perfect combination and quick).  I took the suggestions and thinly sliced bell peppers and onion and cooked them for 3 minutes before adding the chicken.

Yum! Everyone loved it. I did dredge the chicken in cornmeal before adding to the sauce. It was sticky and delicious!

This dish is wonderful!  I serve with rice and broccoli.  I lightly flour the chicken before putting in the pan.  This is a frequent meal in my household.

I served this for a lady I was meeting for the first time and it came out magnificent; by the time the meeting was done she took home the recipe and you can play with the seasoning. I suggest that in order to make the recipe taste better and healthier use half water and half soy sauce for the soy sauce measurement.

This is so perfectly perfect perfection. Seriously! The chicken was bursting with delicious flavor. There were so many layer of flavor it was like an onion of deliciousness. I don't eat meat so I made chicken for my family and then used this sauce with fake chicken breasts you find in the frozen section and they turned out amazing! This is one of my favorite recipes I've found on here and that's saying a lot!

It smelled great, but this recipe was way too salty from the soy sauce (no salt needed at all either!) and not sweet enough. The backbone of the recipe is great but I would definitely adjust soy sauce (less) and sugar (more) amounts big time! Or at least use a low sodium soy sauce.

I really liked this recipe. We don't do spicy in my household so I left out the hot sauce, and used dry ginger and didn't miss it.

My husband and I made this last week for dinner.  Wow...it was terrific!  We made it as written and loved it.  Next time we may add some toasted sesame seeds and sliced scallions just before serving.  I shared it on FB, and about 10 people commented on it...in a positive way.  3 of those people have since made it, and loved it!  Thanks for that yummy recipe.

The first thing out of my husband's mouth was "OMG is this ever good!". I used 2 #boneless, skinless chicken thighs and doubled the sauce. Marinated for about 5 hours, but overnight would have been even better. I followed other poster's suggestions and dredged the meat in flour before browning, then poured the sauce into a saucepan and boiled the sauce until the chicken was cooked, then added it to the chicken and let cook until sauce was good and thick. Served over rice. Definitely a keeper!

Holy Moly this is good!  I did only use 1 tbsp of hot sauce for my kid's sake.  And I coated the chicken with flour before cooking as others suggested.  Loved the flavor and the chicken was very tender.  Will make again.

This was pretty easy to make. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking and it came out perfect. I was a little disapointed in the flavor though. It had a little sweetness but I mainly tasted saltiness and soy sauce with an afterkick of the sriracha hot sauce I used. Not sure if I will make again.

Wow... Yum!!  This recipe is full of flavor and my family loved it.  What I loved about it is that it is so EASY to throw together and quick to cook.  22 minutes - start to finish - BAM!!  Thank you, Kate.  I threw some flour in a bowl, added salt & pepper, then dredged the chicken in it.  I also sprinkled some cornstarch into the sauce mixture before adding to the pan and it thickened up nicely!

This was Great!!!! As in other reviews, I coated the chicken with all purpose flour.  I did not add the hot sauce, but instead I added about a half a tsp of hot pepper flakes and it did just perfect. Definitely will do again!

I dredged the chicken pieces in cornstarch & cooked over medium high.  Added the sauce to allow it to thicken with cornstarch & drippings.  I used boneless breasts & boneless thighs.  Served to our Samoan pastor for dinner  & he raved.  I agree it took longer than suggested so I removed the chicken from sauce to prevent drying out.  I'm glad I did as breast meat dries out quickly.  The thighs were perfect, too.  Poured over Calrose Rice...sticky and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This might be the BEST recipe that I've ever made from allrecipes!  FANTASTIC!
I did double the sauce to have more for the rice and broccoli side dishes.  I also added chopped green onion to the sauce and excluded the salt and pepper on the chicken itself.  I didn't flour the chicken either.

As written, this is way too sweet, too spicy-hot (and I love heat in my food) and too gingery.  Instead of throwing it out, I put everything in the crockpot, added some chicken broth and white wine, and let it mellow out for a few hours on low.  I also threw in some broccoli and sliced carrots.  My husband gave THAT recipe an A+.

This is a staple in our house! We had peanuts to the sauce and its our version of kind of kung po.  I 4x the sauce because we like it saucy. Also we use sriracha for hot sauce.

This sauce has a wonderful tanginess to it.  I prefer not to bread it as others have suggested because the breading gets soggy.  Had homemade won ton soup with it and some fried rice. We used sweet chili Sauce which gave it a nice kick.  Was a big hit.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good flavor!! I toned it down on the soy sauce and squeezed in a bit more honey. I did double the recipe for the sauce so we could have some extra to top our rice. It was a little spicy with the hot sauce but I guess that depends on what hot sauce you use. So if your feeding it to the kiddos you might want to cut that in half. Will make again!!

My husband and I found this to be very salty. I followed the recipe, but next time I will not *lightly* salt the chicken strips before cooking in the sauce. The sauce imparts enough salt to the dish. You can always add more salt later, but you can't take it out! 
Having said that, I will cook this again because the sauce is delicious! Will probably add some snap peas and broccoli next time.

This turned out to be a very tasty recipe and will be made again at our home.  My husband and daughters both loved it.  I did make a slight change after reading the other reviews.  Several had mentioned that the sauce just did not thicken up to make sticky sauce.  I added some cornstarch, about 1 tbs., to the sauce mixture before adding to chicken.  This allowed me to pour the sauce right over the chicken in the pan and cook for about 10 minutes until thickened.

I have made this recipe multiple times now. I absolutely love it!!! I did follow the advice of other reviewers. I dredged the chicken in flour before searing. I sauteed an onion and added that. For the hot sauce I used Sriracha but only 1 Tbsp because I am a wuss. I let all of it simmer while I cooked some rice to go with it and added in steamed broccoli for a couple of minutes at the end. It soaked up the sauce wonderfully. I will continue to make this often.

My hubby and I love this dish. I had to change a few things increase the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons, leave out the ginger, decrease the soy sauce to one fifth of a cup, and I used one and a half tablespoons of Sriracha.

Excellent recipe! I followed other reviewers suggestions of coating the chicken prior to sauteing. Instead of using flour, I coated the chicken with corn starch. It kept the moisture of the chicken in, while providing something for the sauce to hold on to and helped thicken it. I used sriracha for the hot sauce. I will be enjoying this for the next few days.

Love this recipe! I dredged the chicken in flour and CORNSTARCH for that extra crispy fluffy chicken!!  I just made the sauce on the side until it was the right thickness and when the chicken was done frying just tossed it with the sauce! came out perfect!

Great! I found that stirring a tablespoon of corn starch into the sauce (before adding to the chicken) gives it the desired thickness. Otherwise great as is.

Very tasty!  My family loved it.  I would cut chunks of chicken smaller next time and also add some celery, carrots and water chestnuts.  Sauce is delicious!  I, too, dredged the chicken in flour prior to cooking and tripled the sauce.  Excellent!!

Excellent sauce wonderful.  As another commenter said, use siracha (Rooster Brand) hot sauce, it is a must!  

I cut the chicken into finger sized strips and coated them in corn starch and sauteed them on high heat in coconut oil.  Also i added some sesame oil (1tsp) to it as well as some chopped green onions after the fact.  I think next time i might also add some sesame seeds to the dish as a final finishing touch

Family loved this, even the picky 8 year old! I did have to decrease the "Rooster sauce" and I added some corn starch dissolved in water after 10-12 minutes of cooking and it thickened the sauce right up very quickly and did not alter the taste. I just had to stir it constantly after adding to prevent burning or clumping. I'll make this again!

What a great recipe! I dredged through flour before pan searing, and halved the hot sauce because we don't like it too too hot and lemme tell you it was amazing! I cooked this for eight people and they all wanted seconds hehe! Great stuff thanks! Oh I also wanted to mention that mine thickened up perfectly, maybe due to the flour coating. Thanks for such a delish recipe!

Sweet, Sticky, Spicy.....DELICIOUS!  I made this for my boyfriend who is a picky eater, he loved it.  Not one for much heat, I added only 1 Tbsp of hot sauce and it was no problem for him.  I did alter the recipe a little.  
Change: 1/3 c of flour, I put it in a bag and put the cut chicken pieces in the flour before adding to frying pan.   I added fresh cut green beans, carrots, bell peppers, and onions

I was dissapointed with this one. It wasn't sticky or gooey like the title implies and the flavor wasn't as good as I hoped it would be either.

This recipe was awesome!  It was easy and flavorful.  I had no problems with the sauce thickening up.  I did dust the chicken in corn starch and browned first.  I only used a little bit of the hot sauce because I wasnt sure how spicy it would be but I could have added more.  I served this in a bowl over rice and some steamed broccoli.  Definitely give this one a try!

This is by far the best recipe that I have found on this site. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour first but other than that I followed the recipe.It was sweet with a spicy kick even my son who hates spicy foods loved it. My daughter had a friend over for dinner and she thought it was from a resturant.It was easy to make and so delicious!. A KEEPER!

This chicken was wonderful!  I did not double the sauce as others did - and I did not feel I needed to. But, I did not simmer the sauce over the chicken more than 5 minutes. If I had I could see the sauce thickening and getting to be less.  But, I didn't need to let it thicken - it was great! I steamed carrots and broccoli and brown rice and I had plenty of sauce for all of it!  The fresh ginger is amazing!

I thought this was a great "base" for something my family would eat. since I have little ones under the age of 3, and a husband who is not so fond of spicy dishes, I toned this down to a sweet and sour chicken and it was a huge success. 

My changes were to dredge the chicken in corn starch. Use tube garlic and ginger, to control the taste of the spices as I was cooking, omitted the hot sauce and added fresh veggie's and a can of pineapple tidbits (drain the juice). This turned out to be very yummy! I served over brown rice. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Deelicious!!  I added a little sesame oil for more flavor. Next time will add gr. onions as well.  Used water instead of the soy sauce (too salty) .....salt already added to taste. Did not have any ginger root so used gr. ginger. The 2T of hot sauce really gave it a kick.

I made this last night and it was oh so good.  I did dip the chicken piece in flour and the sauce (which I doubled) thickened up very well.  Will be making this again as my family loved it.

This dish was very spicy and flavorful.  My family enjoyed it.  I was a little disappointed that it never got very sticky.  The liquid stayed very thin even after cooking it for a long time.  It definitely needs to be paired with white rice to offset the hotness and we enjoyed an asian vegetable medley with it.  I would not make this again but gave it a four for flavor.

Very very good! Floured the chicken and was nice and crispy. Sautéed some veggies and added it to the chicken. Great dish! Came out perfect.

Very good. I used Chili Oil for "hot sauce" and cooked carrots in with it. My husband and I loved it and the kids liked it but asked me to make it less spicy next time. I give it a 5 because it is easy to make and the family asked me to make it again.

We enjoyed this for dinner.  I ended up using a little hoison sauce to substitute for some soy sauce, as I didn't have enough soy sauce.  Was very flavorful and good..

Oh my god, that was the first thing both my husband and i said when we tried this recipe.  It is so good that it will be a staple in our house hold.  I did try some of the suggestions in the other review.  I did dip my chicken in flour before I cooked it and I added 1 more Tbsp of brown sugar.

Loved it!! Just made it today, and changed a few things to make it even healthier with low sodium soy sauce no added sugar, to eat with coucous/quinoa and spinach!  Delicious!!

This was very good and everyone enjoyed! I doubled the garlic amount since we all love garlic and lightly fried tenderloins  then tossed in the sauce and let it simmer for about 10 min. Buying tenderloins saved time instead of cutting strips. Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce. It was just a little salty but still good. This is a keeper! Oh and the fresh ginger is awesome! I also used the Asian sirachi sauce! Yum!

Great recipe!  Took other member's advice and tossed chicked in flour and browned them up first.  Then put sauce together.  Let the sauce heat up and added chicken back in.  Let the whole thing simmer together while I waited for the rice to finish up.  Next time I will try adding some onions and green peppers!  Yum!

Flavor was amazing by following the recipe. I prefer my foods very spicy, so I added extra hot sauce (Sriracha). I've never had luck with sauces thickening on simmer so it was no surprise when this sauce didn't thicken for me. Adding a tbsp of cornstarch did the trick.

I liked the premise of this recipe, but it was too salty and too hot. I don't mind hot, but this was too much. I think with some alterations to the amounts of the items it would be good, but I am not sure the hubby will let me try it again! :)

I followed suggestion of putting the chicken strips into a baggie with seasoned flour (salt & pepper), shook it, then browned it in the wok after heating up the vegetable oil. Very good! The sauce was just right.  Will make again!

This was fantastic...it was sweet, sticky and spicy.  I too dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper...perfect.  I will make this again with one adjustment...I will decrease the amount of hot sauce to 1 tablespoon.  I served it with sticky rice and veggies.  Thank you for the recipe Kate.

Easy to make and very good.  Tripled the recipe for the sauce because we like lots.  Also reduced the hot sauce, and added corn starch to thicken it a bit.  Just added a tspn cornstarch to the triple ingredients.  Served with rice and oriental veggies.

Excellent, we floured chicken like recommended reviews. Also since we have fresh farm chickens they are thicker we cooked meat longer.

This sounds perfect for an easy supper.  I'd leave out the hot sauce since my taste buds just don't like that hot sauce, or spicy foods.  But the rest of it sounds just delightful and sounds easy to make.

This recipe was good, but my sauce never thickened up, nor was it sticky. Will try coating chicken in flour first and see if it thickens the sauce.

This was delicious!  I did make a couple changes, however.  I dredged the chicken in cornmeal seasoned with salt and pepper, and added a little bit of sesame oil to the vegetable oil.  And I substituted hot chili paste for the hot sauce.  It was quick, easy, and excellent after a long day at work!

We loved this! I heated the sauce separately and added plenty of cornstarch and it thickened very nicely! Tossed chicken to coat and served over rice! I only added one Tbs hot sauce also to keep it kid friendly. Will add veggies next time!

Very delicious!  The only change I would make is to reduce the amount of chicken; this will give you more sauce to accompany rice and veggies.

Great recipe!  Made it for my family in San Antonio, who are bombarded with Mexican and fast food...it went over quite well.  I took into account one of the reviews that said it had an 'overwhelming soy sauce flavor', but I think its a matter of what brand sauce you use (the flavors can be as distinct as the # of varieties).  Honestly, I prefer the cheaper brands as opposed to (let's say, for instance) Kikkoman's, which tend to be more robust.  But if you like that bold flavor, by all means...EXPLORE and ENJOY!!!

OK so what I learned from this recipe is that you have to keep your eye on it constantly...which I didn't and it halfway burned. Besides that it rocked! I took the advice of the other posters and coated the chicken first, cooked it, removed it, and reduced the sauce. I put the chicken back in and and it coated beautifully! It got a bit watery again so I decided to give it 5 more minutes while I washed the dishes (yeah, I know, I know) and when I came back it was sure sticky all right...to the bottom of the pan. We ate it anyways and my husband still loved it, although he said he wished it wouldn't have burned. You can still taste the sweet and spicy and BOY was it good...and that's with it being burned. Can't imagine what the real thing tastes like. Can't wait to try again!

I make this recipe as is and it is amazing! No tweaks needed at all, my whole family LOVES it! 

For the people who are saying the sauce takes forever to thicken...I didn't find that problem at all! And I had it just under medium heat. I would assume you are doing something wrong.

4.5 Stars: I used a 2 lb. pack of chicken tenders and made 1 1/2 batches of sauce.  I found it a touch too spicy and will reduce the sirichia a bit the next time.  My husband and daughter, who like super spicy, really liked this dish a lot. Adding veggies would really make it 5 star.

Followed the recipe exactly (apart from the ginger, which I don't like, plus I added flour before cooking the chicken) and it had, like what some of the other reviewers indicated, WAY too much soy flavor. Not to mention the saltiness was unbearable; I had to wash off the sauce to be able to eat it! I recommend either reducing the soy sauce or specifically using sodium-free soy sauce. Sweet soy sauce may also be better.

This one's a keeper, it's so tasty. I did coat the chicken in flour and was careful to ONLY cook until it was just slightly golden in color.  You have to remember that the chicken still has 10 minutes to cook with the sauce in and you don't want it overcooked.  I added a little steamed green pepper,  sliced carrots and a can of pineapple chunks along with some toasted sesame seeds and served it over jasmine rice. One of the best meals I've made in a very long time. I think you could easily turn it into orange chicken with a little o.j. concentrate and some crushed red pepper flakes.

Too much soy sauce and too much hot sauce.  Decreasing these ingredients will make for an even more delicious dish.  Also, the addition of some peanuts for crunch wouldn't hurt. :)

This was delicious! I used a 3 pound bag of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and tripled the sauce, added defrosted stir fry veggies and served over rice. I only added 3 tablespoons of sriracha hot sauce, this was enough spicy for us. Everyone loved this and wants it again soon.

Wow! This was awseome!  I did dredge the chicken lightly in flour before putting in the skillet, and it was very sticky!  I also used sriracha for the hot sauce, it had great flavor but was super spicy, next time I will cut it down by 1/2 a Tbs or so.  Great recipe!

We love this. I followed the other suggestions to coat the chicken in flour and sear over high heat. A lot of variations are possible with the garlic, ginger and hot sauce quantities. My 5 year old loves this. I highly recommend this.

Great chicken recipe.  The only changes I made were to coat the chicken in corn starch before frying and then when I added the sauce it got nice and thick and sticky and only 1 tbsp. Of hot sauce and it was still hot enough for us.

Delicious..reminiscent of General Tso's chicken but without breading and prob a bit "healthier".  The chicken is not sticky, more of a thick glaze.  I was low on soy sauce so added about 1 tbsp hoisin to make up for it and I think it made a tangy addition.  Dredged chicken in flour before browning on hight heat in EVOO.  Served with quinoa and green beans with walnuts.  Yummy!

I followed the suggestions of using flour before frying the chicken. It was very good.  Excelent combination of flavors.  Used some roasted cashews as well.  Next time I´ll double the sauce

This is a fabulous recipe! I recommend doubling or tripling the sauce recipe. I also coat the chicken in flour and a little bit of paprika before cooking it to help thicken the sauce. I use a red chili sauce instead of hot sauce to add to the flavor a little bit. I saute chopped celery and carrots in a little bit of olive oil and add to the chicken and sauce. Overall...a big hit in my household! I make this one A LOT as it is requested almost every week!

This was a hit in my household, was similar to the chicken you get at the chinese food mall place.  The sauce didnt get thick enough for me, but it still tasted good.  Would make again, probably with chicken pieces and bake them.

I love this recipe! It's become my go-to Asian style sauce. The recipe is really for the sauce: I've made it with chicken and seitan, and I'm sure it would be great with other meats, seafood or tofu.  I always seem to have to add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it, as it's never thickened on it's own. Thanks for submitting this Kate!

Loved it. Very easy to make. The soy sauce is a little dominant if you dont make rice or a veggie to help soak it up, but all in all, really good. I read about using flour to help absord sauce, but since I just moved and had no flour in house, I breaded chicken VERY lightly and it was great. gave the chicken a general tso/sesame chicken type feel. Will definitely make again. easy and so quick.

Wonderful! My husband who LOVES spicy foods adored this meal. Dredging the chicken in flour thickened the sauce nicely. We will be making this meal again and may get adventurous with ingredients using this recipe as a  base.

i agree with Mamaspice, the Sriracha chili sauce is a must, but i needed to turn the heat up a few drops of some Dave's Gourmet Ghost Chili sauce.  I'd also like to get the chicken crispier, so i may use some sort of batter next time to get that crunch.  A+ recipe

I made this for my daughter tonight and she thought it was very good, just a tad too spicy for her tastes. Her boyfriend, however, didn't think it was spicy at all (oh, those Southwestern boys). I'll definitely make this again. Like others before me, I also dredged the chicken in flour.

My hubby and I were SO impressed with this dish.  We added brocolli florets to the rice and chicken--it was an awesome stir-fry.  I used "buffalo chicken" Red Hot and ground ginger (that you put in a pumpkin pie) and it came out fabulous!  I'm making it for a friend who is recovering from surgery!  She's going to love it too!  :)

Yummy, I followed others comments to dredge the chicken in flour, but I don't think it was actually necessary. If anything it thickened up too much with the flour addition. Yet, the flavor was harmonious. My boyfriend loved the spiciness and still drenched his in Siracha. I would definitely make this again.

Okay...I recommend not coating the chicken in flour prior to cooking as some suggest. It made a huge mess in my pan....maybe I did something wrong? Probably won't make this again.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe, substituting ground ginger for the fresh, as that's what I had, and lessening the amount of chicken. It was easy to make and very yummy! I have made a few changes to how I make this now, and my husband loves those even more than the original. When cooking for the two of us I use 1 large chicken breast and coat the pieces in a mixture of flour, wheat germ, ground ginger, and red pepper. It adds a little more heat, makes the chicken brown beautifully and helps the sauce thicken. After the chicken is browned I throw frozen baby sugar peas into the pan and let them cook for about a minute before adding the sauce. When mixing the sauce I increase the honey to 3 tbs, and I have no issue with the sauce thickening correctly. If you're making this for 4 I would suggest increasing the sauce by at least 50% and the honey by 100%.

I made this for my family tonight. I doubled the recipe for the sauce, except for the soy sauce. It was very gingery, so I would suggest that you don't use all of it if you don't like ginger. It was good and spicy. I added a tablespoon extra of brown sugar and a litte extra honey as well, to make it a little sweeter. Also, I heated it separately and added a tablespoon of cornstarch to help it thicken up (I was trying to keep in gluten free, so no flour!). Overall, I really liked it, as did my family. I served it over rice and with broccoli and asparagus. I will make it again. :) Thanks!

LOVED LOVED LOVED!  It was really spicy, but I think that was partially my fault.  I used a spicy garlic sauce, and even half was a bit much (although delicious).  I made some rice, and it was a perfect asian inspired meal!  I am just getting into cooking, but will definitely hold on to this recipe.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and it was so delicious.  After about 15 min the sauce was still very thin but it worked great over rice.

This recipe was very good.  However, like other reviewers, the soy sauce was too overwhelming.  When I tasted the sauce, finding the other flavors was almost impossible due to the overpowering flavor of the soy.  To cut it down, I added some sugar, which seemed to help.  The next time I would put 1/4 of the soy the recipe calls for.

I used cornstarch to coat the chicken as others have mentioned, I also doubled the sauce and only used 1/2 the hot sauce because I wanted the kids to try it.  It has a delicious flavor and we ate the entire pan, I will be making this again.

One of my favorite recipes.  Quick, easy, and full of flavor.  I would definitely, recommend this to anyone who likes both the sweet and spicy flavor.  Stirfry with baby corn, red peppers, water chestnuts, broccoli, and snow peas.  Sincerely, Stacy's boyfriend.

I somehow didn't have soy sauce, so I had to substitute with teriyaki (low-sodium variety).  I also used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce rather than Frank's Red Hot sauce just because it's the one I happened to have on hand.  I'm not sure I would do that substitution again, but despite all this it came out tasting nice.  I'm looking forward to trying it with the correct ingredients (seriously, how could I not have soy sauce?!).

Awesome!!! I cut the chicken into chunks and coated in corn starch because I cannot have flour. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was so simple and easy but delicious! My husband and I both had seconds and I'm looking forward to making it again. The name says it all!

I love this dish! And I used the flour in bag technique on the chicken before frying in pan. I think next time I will use more oil in the pan to cook the chicken w, because the whole outcome of the sauce was thicker than I expected it to be. But the flavor was delicious!

This recipe is really good. I took the advice of other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour before frying. My only complaint would be that there is not enought sauce to serve this over rice. I would double or triple the sauce part of the recipe.

Didn't care of this.  Way too much soy sauce.  I even added extra honey and brown sugar but still too much of the soy sauce came through.  Needs some tweaking for my taste.

I doubled the sauce recipe, and it was tasty, but the chef was the only thing that ended up sticky. Possibly this was due to the extra sauce, but we like things juicy. Not complaining, though, it was good.

This was very tasty and very easy to make. I used a very hot hot sauce (scorned woman) so I only used 1 tbs. and even that was a bit much spice. But my family loves spicy foods so it was a hit. I'd say to either use the full amount of a milder hot sauce like tabasco or to use a half tbs. of an extreme hot sauce like scorned woman. I also coated the chicken in flour before browning it and it turned out wonderfully. I will definitely be making this again!

Wowsers! I didn't follow the recipe to the letter (no honey, so added more brown sugar; no ginger, so omitted), but this was a winner nonetheless! I followed others' suggestions and dredged the chicken in flour, which was a great move.  My fiance loved this too and it will definitely be a regular dish in our house.
(In fact, we liked it so much that I ended up making this two nights in a row!)

This was sooo good! I too floured the chicken and cook it then added the sauce. I added peas into the chicken and sauce and let it simmer. I didn't have rice like most everyone else so I made a little pasta and mixed it all together! So good!! I will make this many more times!

LOVED this!!!  I didn't find any issues with this recipe as some of the other people had.  The sauce was amazing but I did take the advice and put the chicken in flour Before I pan fried them.  It was so good.  It taste exactly like something from a chinese restaurant  but I know what the ingredients are.  WILL make this again!!

I made this last night. Didn't see other reviews, which I noramlly do, so it wasn't sticky, sauce never thickened and the chicken was dried up. Would try again but will follow other reviewers advise.

This was delicious!  The entire family loved it! I doubled all the sauce ingredients except hot sauce (3 tablespoons) and used 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger. Served it with brown rice and summer/squash/zucchini. I will definetely make this again but will quadruple the sauce since it was so good!

This was Great!  But glad I didn't add all the hotsauce.  I doubled the recipe, but I only used 1/2 T hot sauce rather than the 4 T doubling it would call for.  Family loved it.

After reading other reviews, I cut up the chicken, dredged it in flour, and browned it in a dutch oven.  I took the chicken out before it was completely cooked and prepared the sauce in the same pan, which I doubled.  After it thickened slightly, I put the chicken back in and simmered it until the chicken was cooked through.  I used siracha hot sauce and it was pretty spicy!  I also served it over Asian Coconut Rice from this site, and I felt like I was eating authentic ethnic food. It was a great pairing!!  I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful!  So full of flavor and SPICY!! Cooked up beautifully.  The only complaint is this doesn't make a lot of "juice" so I usually end up doubling the ingredients so we have something to pour over the rice.

This is a great recipe.  Next time I am going to double the sauce and add some vegetables, chopped in big pieces and some flaked red pepper. I did coat my chicken with the flour, but then I didn't have much sauce, needed a bit more for my rice.  But really good and easy.

My boyfriend LOVED this!  I did as others and used flour and also removed the cooked chicken while the sauce simmered.  Served over rice.  This one's a keeper

Remember the phrase: Mikey likes it? Well around here I say Chris likes it. Only I used a chicken substitute because he is vegetarian. And he is hard to please. Thank you!

I have made this a few times, I double the sauce, except only use 1 tbsp of hot sauce, otherwise it is WAY too spicey. I follow the advice of others by dredging the chicken pieces in flour and brown for about 5 mins. I serve it with white rice and brocolli and top it with cashews. Yum! One of our favorites!

I really liked this recipe.  I used 4 large chicken breasts and the sauce was not enough to actually make a sauce out of!  But it did coat the chicken nicely and had a good flavor.  I didn't think it was sweet, spicy or sticky, however, but I believe that was because of how much chicken I had.  I still really liked it!  I also cut my chicken into pieces and dredged them in flour.  The end result was really good.  But I thought the dish would have been boring without some vegetables and crunch.  So I lightly sauteed carrot and green peppers in a bit of butter and oil.  Just enough to brighten their colors.  What a wonderful addition to the dish.  The crunch and flavor only added to the dish.  Of course, any good vegetable would work.  I also think some nuts would be good as well.  I will definitely be making this again!   Thanks!!

I also followed reviews of others and dredged chicken before cooking. I also used ginger in a tube. I do have 3 children under 7 so we cut back on the garlic and ginger by half a teaspoon and it still was sweet, sticky, and spicy. We will be putting this into our regular rotation in our house!!! Thanks

Quick, easy & good. my husband loved it.  I used pork tenderloin instead of chicken. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. For those who are not spice lovers, chili sauce was a great  replacement for the hot sauce

Very tasty! This is nice asian inspired dish.  I added a tablespoon or so of orange marmalade to the sauce as well as some orange juice to the mix. You could really add some more heat and you would have General Tso's.

I followed the other reviewers advice and coated the chicken with the salt/pepper/flour mixture before adding to the pan. The sauce has a great flavor and the spicy kick at the end is nice.

My husband said this was a little salty (but you salt the chicken yourself so perhaps I put too much on) but he'd have it again. It was definitely spicy and we enjoyed it for the most part.

This was great & easy! I did adjust it for my taste by only doing 1T of hot sauce (siracha) & 1t of ginger.  I also dredged it in flour prior to cooking to help thicken the sauce.  It was outstanding!!

Very good!  I added a 1/2 cup of water to the sauce to make it go a bit further.  Plus I think it helped tone down the saltiness of the soy sauce too.  I also dredged my chicken in a flour/cornstarch mixture.  Added extra garlic and used red pepper flake in the place of the hot sauce cuz I didn have any, and served over nooddles cuz the husband doesn't like rice.  Would be great to make again :)

Coated chicken in flour before cooking as per many previous reviews, and when I added the sauce in, it had no problem thickening up.  Great flavors, good spice, will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This has become a family staple in our house.  I will say that it is a bit spicy for us, so we cut the hot saue down to 1 T., but other than that, I make it exactly as is.

I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the soy sauce and it was delicious!  I also dredged the chicken in cornstarch before I sauteed it, so the sauce became a nice consistency.  The only thing I'll change next time is adding more garlic.  I'll never use store bought sauce again for my stirfrys!

Awesome! The only thing I do different is dredge chicken in cornstarch then fry. I also add a little mirin to the sauce..The cornstarch helps the sauce thicken and  more and that is the way I like it, but great as is...

It was delicious!!!  I had a little bit to much chicken from the recommended so i doubled the sauce. I Also used Flour on the chicken strips before putting them in the skillet. tasted incredible. Oh and might i recommend the Asian Hot Sauce i think its called sriacha i think. It has a rooster on it. I hate spicy food and i cleaned my plate, Fiance loves it, will keep!!!

Just made this for the first time.  My family loved this and would have given it 5 stars but I am giving it 4 stars as I would have liked a little more of a kick to it and next time will add some crushed red pepper.  I did follow the advice to cook the sauce ahead and to dredge the chicken in flour which definitely helped to thicken the sauce.  I will  absolutely be making this again!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was fabulous! I only used 1 Tbs of the hot sauce and it had plenty of spice. I also dredged the chicken in flour as others had suggested. I served it with sticky rice and steamed broccoli. I'm already thinking about when I will make this again! Thanks for a great easy meal!

Very spicy in a good way. I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce after simmering for 10 minutes. The sauce reminded me of teriyaki chicken from a restaurant.

Really good. Sometimes we add some green beans or broccoli to boost the nutrition. We've found the amount of hot sauce called for to be plenty hot, but I'm sure it probably depends on the type of hot sauce you use.

this is restaurant quality! I only give this 4 stars because it was a little too salty for our taste. I would use next time low sodium soy sauce. Tha only 2 changes I made:1. begin to simmer the sauce at the same time that you cook the chicken. that way dont overcooked the chicken and 2. floured the chicken before brown it. But overall was delicious

This was delicious- I followed other reviewers suggestions of first coating the chicken pieces in flour before browning.  In order to get the sauce to thicken nicely I heated it separately while I browned the chicken.  When the chicken was mostly done I poured the warmed sauce over and it immediately turned "sticky" like the local restaurant's General Tso chicken.  I used Agave nectar because I had run out of honey and next time I make this I would cut way back (1tbsp max) on the hot sauce.  My husband and I like spicy food but the 2 tbsps completely overpowered the other flavors.  Overall though, this got good reviews in my house and I will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Delicious! Tastes like Chinese food without being heavy and making you feel yucky afterwards :)  I followed the many reviewers suggestions of lightly coating with flour, searing the chicken on med-hi heat then adding the sauce and cooking on low for 10-15 min.  I doubled the recipe with the exception of the hot sauce-only 3 T instead of 4-and it came out great.

Very good. Like others, I coated the chicken with a bit of flour to help the sauce to thicken. For me (and everyone else at my house who ate it) it was a little too spicy, and we like spicy. I will cut back to 1Tbl of tabasco next time, but I will definitely make it again.

This lived up to the hype.  Went ahead and dredged the chicken in flour.  Sauce was perfect blend of sweet, savory, and spicy.  Used low sodium soy sauce, and actually made about 1.5x the sauce.  Truly wonderful, thank you!!!

I followed others advice and floured the chicken tender strips and fried them first. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder ginger (1 tsp) & only 1 tsp. hot sauce. Whole family loved this dish!

My family love this chicken!  I tripled the sauce, added 2T. flour to thicken and poured it over chicken legs I had pre-baked.  I baked it for another 15 minutes with the sauce.  Very good

mmmmm.... Great! I omitted the honey - read in some Ayurveda books that it gets poisonous when cooked :-/ and I got scared since then :) So I used 3 T of sugar, floured the chicken a bit. It was done in 10 minutes. Perfect!

This is a 5 star if you roll the chicken in flour first and brown on higher heat so it gets crispy and helps the sauce thicken up and get sticky.  I only added a bit of hot sauce because of the pre-schooler but it still had a nice flavour, didn't really find it too salty. Thanks for the recipe.

was a bit disappointed... looked better then it tasted, had that burnt sugar, too much soy sauce taste to it. Coated the chicken in a mixure of cornstarch and flour before browning, and that worked very good in giving it that nice crispy texture, and then helping the sauce to thicken quickly.

Good but we tasted too much soy. We will cut back on soy anduse the priginal amount of heat. We cut back based on others comments but it was too mild for us.

UPDATE DEC 12 2010: I want to clarify that the first few times I made this I made changes like some other reviewers. I floured the chicken first, put the entire sauce over before putting it in oven. That was a mistake, the sauce burned! Did other variations but one day I decided to just follow the cooking instructions exactly and boy did it turn out perfectly! I don't usually have ginger root so I subtitute 1/4 tsp ground ginger and use a few shakes of dried red chili peppers instead of the hot sauce and use no salt because the soy sauce is salty enough. I cut the chicken into chunks though instead of strips. But the sauce always turns out thick, sweet and sticky for me when I cook it per the directions. We love it, it's one of our favorite dishes. Thanks Kate!

This was excellent! I had previously tried a similar recipe from this site which included vinegar in the ingredients but I didn't like it although my husband did. But this one is perfect and we both loved it! I've made it a couple times already.

Wow this was sooooo good!  After reading reviews, I altered the recipe based on a few other reviews--which is why I LOVE this site.  I used chicken tenders and cut them into thirds resulting in nice size chunks  I then dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with salt.  I stir-fried  a yellow, red & green pepper and an onion that I had left over in some olive oil, then took them out of the pan & then sauted the chicken pieces.  I too used the hot sauce that you can find in the Chinese section of the grocery store- with the rooster on it.  I did not have fresh ginger so I subbed 1 hearty tsp. of dried.  I thought it was as good if not better than my favorites at our local chinese place.  It is spicy, but not too spicy. This one goes in my favorites!!!

I love this! I omitted the hot sauce because of the kids (I think I would love it) & tossed the chicken in flour, salt & pepper. I cranked the neat on my pan to get it super hot, added the oil then cooked the chicken in two batches. I added it all back in at the end, poured the sauce over the top & added sesame seeds. Even the kids ate it & they won't eat much. I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli.

This was great! Sweet, spicy, and sticky. We ate it with rice and veggies. Will definetly make again! Had no problem getting the sauce thick. I did double the recipe because of the amount of chicken and veggies used.

This was VERY good.  I would suggest to toss the chicken strips in flour, and browning them up so they are nice and crisp.  After they were brown, I removed them from the pan and quickly cooked some onion, broccoli and carrot (just to make it a one pot meal), removed the veggies and poured in the sauce and let it reduce.  Once it was nice and thick I added the veggies and chicken just before serving.

Mmmm...a good dish!  I used a tsp. of ground ginger (because I didn't have fresh ginger root) and Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (Rooster Sauce).  It was definitely spicy...too spicy for my husband and I; next time I will reduce the hot sauce or use a different kind.  I served this easy to assemble meal over white rice.

This is the best chicken dish ever!  Do not bread the chicken as some reviews tell you to-it just adds heaviness not flavor.  Also for the hot sauce component, use the Srirachi hot sauce with the rooster on the bottle-we get it at Target.  It adds a lot of flavor and snap to this great dish.

This got nice and sticky for me. But there really wasn't enough sauce to put on the rice! I would have liked it a little sweeter. I used chicken tenders cut into big chunks and like others, I coated them with flour first. Nice and moist. Super quick and easy.

Really good and simple recipe. I double battered and deep fried cut-up chicken breast instead of pan frying, used a little less soy and added about a tablespoon of orange juice to the sauce. was delicious and tasted just like take-out orange chicken! thanks for sharing this recipe

This recipe needed more spices or something, and didn't have enough sauce for drizzling over the rice..It was just okay, will not make this again.

Dredging the chicken in flour seasoned w/ your choice of seasoning (I used Montreal Steak Seasoning, but just a little bit) is a must to get crispy chicken pieces.  I preheated a dry cast iron pan on med. high heat until it just started to smoke, added canola oil and then the chicken pieces, cooked until very browned.  Add the sauce and let boil for a minute or two, reduced the heat and cooked until sauce thickened and became very sticky.  This is very good and you can add green peppers, onions, mushrooms, whatever you like, serve over rice or quinoa.

I made this as directed, and the flavor was great! "Tastes like restaurant Chinese food, Mom!" was my 6-year-old's comment.  Only thing I would change would be to make more sauce to allow for more of that great flavor to coat the rice.  The sauce was also good on steamed broccoli, which I served with the dinner.

This tasted good but was way way too salty.  I had used 30 percent less salt soy sauce and still we could hardly eat it.  I would however make this again if i figured out how to cut back on the saltiness

Way too spicy for me; my mouth was on fire!  I floured the chicken as suggested and my sauce thickened with no problems.  I liked it but next time I'll use only 1 tablespoon of hot sauce and perhaps more brown sugar.

Very good!  I also floured the chicken before cooking, and added a bit of sesame oil in the sauce and added red pepper and onion a min or so before adding the sauce  This ones a keeper!

This was good using some of the tips posted by other reviewers, like dredging the chicken in flour & using low sodium soy sauce.  Even so it was pretty salty for our tastes.

Very,Very good!  A sweet, spicy, sticky Schezuan type of chicken.  I did double the sauce part and used Rooster Sauce, that said, the next time I will only use 2 TB because the heat overwhelmed the sauce a little too much.  Other than that will definitely make this again! Thanks Kate

This recipe is excellent, however it is EXTREMELY spicy! I followed the recipe exactly except that I tossed the chicken in flour first. I had no problem getting my sauce to thicken. Will definately make this again but next time I will only use 1 tbsp of hot sauce.

This is definitely sweet, but not sticky or spicy. The spiciness can easily be adjusted by adding more hot sauce. The stickiness I'm not so sure how to go about fixing that. This being said, with two modifications it still turned out well. The only thing I did different was to use ginger powder and dredged chicken in flour instead fresh ginger and seasoning the chicken strips with salt and pepper (which I ultimately omitted). It keeps turning out burnt rather than sticky, so I will look for a better chicken strips recipe.

This recipe is delicious! It's going to be one of my favs from now on! only changes I made was a lil less soy sauce ( sorry I didn't measure!) 1/2 tsp of ground ginger instead of fresh and I added hot pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. I thickened the sauce with a little bit of cornstarch and water. I didn't go with the other reviews that dredge the chicken in flour first. also added a little water to the sauce just so we would have extra to pour over the rice. Kind of reminds me of general chicken type recipe. Very good! sweet and spicy!

This was a FANTASTIC recipe!  I followed other reviews and coated the chicken with a little flour before frying and the sauce did thicken up.  I used Sriracha hot chili sauce, but won't use quite so much next time.  My husband and I loved it, will definitely make it again.

Yum, yum, yum!  Very flavourful.  Turned out sweet, stick and spicy.  My other half raved and for the first time in a long time there were no leftovers! Served with rice and broccoli.  Will be making this again and again.

I read the reviewers and did the following changes when I made the recipe; I floured the chicken chunks and I used only 2 chicken breasts (there is only two of us). We thought this recipe was pretty good. I'll probably make it again. I do like that it was relatively healthy.

The flavor was good, a bit too hot for us.  The sauce did not thicken for me either.  Next time I am going to use half the hot sauce and a thicening agent.

Yummy!!   everyone loved it.  Reminds us of one of the chinese food dishes that we order in.  It's called General Tso's chicken but its coated in batter.  This is much healthier.  I doubled the sauce, very glad I did, there was enough to pour the chicken/sauce over rice.   I also tossed the chicken with flour before lightly browning. I also used a whole red pepper sliced up, added the red pepper after the chicken is browned.   Used ginger spice because I never have fresh in the house, approx 1/2 teas.  Forgot salt but didn't need it.   Update:  Used pork tenderion instead of chicken and it was just as good!!!  After all, pork is the "other" chicken. Mixed 2 tsp corn startch with a little water and added just before serving to thicken.  This is one of my hubbys favorite dishes.  I use less than half of the hot sauce otherwise it would be way to hot for us.Will be making this regularly.  Thanks so much!!!

I made this for dinner today and it was awesome!  My family loved it and so did I.  I followed the recipe as written and made these changes:  1. Added 1 t. crushed red pepper flakes & 1/2 t. cayenne pepper for additional spice. 2. I doubled all the ingredients of the sauce so there would be more on the chicken and since I was serving this over Jasmine Rice. 3. I dredged the chicken strips in flour and only let them brown...I did not cook them until done. 4. I did not add salt...it didn't need it with the hot sauce and soy sauce. 5. I let it reduce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes.  It thickened wonderfully and was all that the title implies: sweet, sticky & spicy!  Great recipe and one that my family is already asking for again! Thanks Kate!

Wow!!! These were delicious. The chicken was exactly what the name suggests: Sweet, Sticky, and Spicy. I made a couple of modifications based on reviews. I made the sauce in a saucepan and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. While it was simmering, I drenched the chicken pieces in flour and then cooked them until they started to brown. After they browned, I poured the sauce over the chicken, put the lid on the pan, turned the heat on low, and let it cook for about 10 minutes. Good with rice.

Very good! My only suggestion, if you like extra sauce and want to double the recipe I wouldn't double the hot sauce. I love spice, but it was a little too much.

Boyfriend picked 4 stars, I'll go with 4.5.  Wasn't bad, I'll certainly make it again and I agree with doubling the sauce, you really need to.

This recipe was so great!  Only thing I did different was that I used Olive oil instead of Vegetable oil. The chicken still came out perfect!

Very tasty, easy to make. I used 1/2 the hot sauce cuz I'm a wimp:) I did double the sauce , had to thicken it w/cornstarch, & it was perfect! Served over white rice & had spring rolls from our fav take-out.

My family loved this.  I used a specialty hot sauce (not the stuff from the grocery store - it doesn't have enough heat/flavor for us); also made this with boneless pork loin and it turned out really tasty as well.  We'll definitely be making this again.

Maybe I am just overly critical but this reminded me of something I'd get a the local Chinese take-out place. No heat, little sweet, not sticky, more salty from soy sauce (and I use low sodium version).  Not sure I'd make again, why spend the time when I can get quicker as take-out.  Could make a good base for a sauce...

This was good, I will make it again. Very spicy and it sneaks up on you at the end of the meal. I doubled the sauce and added broccolli.

This was very good. It did not turn out as sweet as I thought (which might be good) even though I added another TB of honey and a bit more brown sugar, but nobody complained. Also dredged the chicken in flour, and kept chicken stock on hand just in case the sauce needed thinning.  It did and I used less than half a cup of stock overall to keep the dish saucy, enough to still coat the chicken but also enough to drizzle over the rice. Served over basmati rice.  Will make again!

Easy & Delicious!  I followed other reviewers and floured the strips of chicken before.  The only thing I would say is the soy sauce flavour is quite strong; I probably won't use the full 1/4 next time as it's a bit too salty...maybe add a bit more honey and sugar to balance it out??  Will make again for sure!

I tripled the sauce for our family of 5, and boy what a mistake!  The soy sauce was overpowering to us, maybe it's just our taste but it wasn't good!!  The chicken was still a bit edible so that's why it's getting a 2 star instead of a 1 but I will not make again!  Sorry!!  I really wanted to love it, it was simple and all but maybe it was my "brand" of soy sauce, I don't know, but it's pretty bad when even I can't eat it!

This was good but not great.  I would add some cornstarch to the liquid so that it would be thicker and stay on the chicken.  Also, I would not season the chicken with salt and pepper because the sauce has enough salt (and I am a salt lover!) Will probably try again with these changes; waiting for the sauce to thicken on its own causes the meat to dry out.

This was fantastic! all my family gave this chicken 2 thumbs up.(even the picky one) I did dredge the chicken in flour and brown at higher heat but other than that followed everything else. My picky one said it tasted just like wings.

Wisking in a little flour will thicken it, keeps really well in the fridge. I use this a lot, and don't measure, but it turns out great every time.

very good! It has the right amount of sweet and spicy; easy to make. I browned the chicken in garlic grapeseed oil; no flour or cornstarch. I used Frank's hot sauce and went a little heavy on the ginger and garlic. Served with rice.  Yum!

This was a great recipe- however, I found it a bit too spicy. Maybe because I used Tabasco? The only change I made to the recipe was following the advice of another reviewer by rolling the chicken in flour before frying. I think this definitely helped. It came out very sticky! Overall this chicken had great flavor. Next time I will cut the hot sauce by half. Tastes great with Broccoli With Garlic Butter & Cashews! (on allrecipes)

This recipe was a nice change from my usual chicken recipes.  Both my husband and I agreed that it was tasty enough to make again.  I would double the liquids next time for more sauce, as I had to add some chicken stock to use as a "gravy" for the egg noodles I served it over.

Made this for dinner on 07/26/2009. Everyone loved it, which includes my 11 yr old, 7 yr old, and DH. Used powdered ginger as that was all I had. Cannot wait to try this with fresh ginger. Went great with broccoli and potatoes!

Followed the recipe for the most part...only used 1 tsp of ginger and about 3 drops of hot sauce (the kind i had is insanely hot) took another users idea and floured the chicken prior to frying...this recipe was incredibly good.  Will definitely cook again.  So easy and so tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was WAY TOO SPICY for us, but we still liked it.  I will only add 1 Tbsp. of hot sauce next time.  Served over brown rice with a side of steamed broccoli - yum!

I like the basic idea of this recipe but I've been playing around with it to fit the tastes of the people around my table.  I lightly flour and saute the chicken. I combine the sauce and simmer it to thicken before stirring it in the chicken. It will thicken more when it combines with the flour on the chicken, getting the recipe to the sticky texture I love.  I agree with others that Rooster sauce is a must but everyone around here disagrees on how much so I try to find a happy medium.  Also to make it a meal, I roast or grill some red bell peppers and onion and leave them crisp-tender, stirring them  in at the end. If I have them on hand, I toast sesame seeds and toss them in as well. I only cook Jasmine rice and think it's aroma and flavor works great with the spicy chicken. Yes, this is easy.  Works well with boneless thighs or breasts.

Fantastic recipe!  I coated the chicken with cornstarch (as someone else had suggested) and sauted in seasame seed oil.  Threw in some steamed brocolli and topped with raw peanuts as a garnish. YUM!

That was great. It does taste like you bought it from a resteraunt. The only thing i did differently was to pound the chicken breast flat before i cut it into pieces. You get more chicken for your buck.

very good! I didn't add as much hot sauce as I should have, so it was more sweet than spicy. Next time I will be sure to add more. I did flour the chicken and the consistancy came out perfet.

This was sooo easy and tasted just like panda express at the mall or something. YUM! Becareful not to add too much soy sauce and remember you can always stick your finger in the sauce just to make sure you're not missing anything. Oh, next time I will try batter dipping frying the bite size pieces before the drizzle for that crunchy texture.

I love this recipe - I almost always have the ingredients for it on hand and its so simple.  We use about half the chicken amount with the same amount of sauce and its awesome.

This recipe is fabulous and easy!  I took the advice of other reviews and dredged the chicken in flour first. This worked like a charm to quickly thicken the sauce. I also agree with others that this dish is VERY spicy with the amount of hot sauce called for, but my husband loved it.  I made two batches and decreased the hot sauce to 1/2 T. in the second batch for my daughter and myself.  I also added brocolli and served with rice for a meal that tasted like it came from a restaurant.

This was the first time I have made this but it seemed to salty from the soy sauce and needed more sweetness. I will try again and alter to my liking. I made double the amount in the orig. recipe.

Very easy to make. Even reducing the spices, it was still too spicy for us, so next time I'll cut it even more and add more sweet flavoring. Followed directions from others about covering it and cooking at lower heat and the chicken came out super juicy.

Easy and delicious. Too much hot sauce - nice and hot even with half the specified amount. I used tofu, sauted on both sides in half-inch slabs, cut into pieces before adding sauce. Delicious over hot brown rice.

This was delicious. I added more honey while it was cooking in the pan to ensure proper stickines. Left out the ginger b/c I didn't have any on hand and added hot sauce last so kids could have theirs first. They came back for seconds and thirds - great great recipe!

Very good!  I did what others did and doused the chicken in flour.  I used a pound of chicken breast tenderloins and doubled the sauce.  I will cut the hot sauce in half because it was a bit spicy for me...otherwise very good!

Fantastic!!! As good as take-out. Reminded me of General Tsao's Chicken, minus the breading. Making it again next week, and it's definately going to have a special place in the menu rotation. Used ground ginger and a little less hot sauce, since my 1 year old and 3 year old were eating it too. They loved it as much as we did. Would be very yummy with extra spice, too.

Excellent and easy recipe. I served over some Jasmine rice. Would highly recommend doubling every part of the sauce except for the hot sauce. 2 tablespoons of Sriracha makes it VERY spicy.

Spicy, yes - Sweet, not so much - Sticky, not at all. Nothing wrong with the taste because I like spicy, but it just tasted spicy. I was a bit disappointed.

I boiled my chicken first until it was thoroughly cooked. After that I tossed with flour like others suggested. I browned a bit in the skillet before adding the sauce. I followed the sauce recipe exactly and it a little too hot for my taste but very good! Next time I'll add more sugar and honey and less hot sauce.

I've made this twice and both times my family really loved it.  I served it over rice with stir-fried veggies.

I used 1/2 tsp chili pepper flakes instead of hot sauce, coated the chicken in flour based on the advice of previous reviewers, and used thin-cut boneless chicken strips.  I also served with chow mein noodles instead of rice.  Was sticky, spicy, sweet, and yummy!

This was SO good!  and super quick and easy as well.  My husband said it was better than PF Changs :) (and healthier and cheaper too!)   I used jarred ginger and garlic, but it was still great, and used the full 2 TBS of hot sauce and that was perfect!  Just enough spice to leave your lips tingly :) I highly recommend this recipe!

awesome! We loved it.  We used a chipotle hot sauce. And about half the ginger because I was having some trouble chopping it really finely.

Wow!!! This has great flavor. We loved the mix of sweet and spicy.  I did gredge the chicken prior to cooking and still had a little trouble getting to the sticky stage of things.   In all honesty, were ok with having some liquid to keep it moist over rice.  This was really delicious and we ate almost the whole thing at one sitting.  We are going to be adding this to the regular rotations.  Thanks for posting!!!!

This was awesome!  I took the advice of others and floured my chicken, sauteed onions, bell peppers, carrots, and brocolli in a seperate skillet and then added them before I added the sauce (which I doubled).  I served over rice and my family loved it.  My only small complaint was that it was slightly salty- I will use low sodium soy sauce next time and probably will not salt my chicken.  Would highly recommend!

This is a great, easy recipe for a weeknight.  Tastes like Chinese food without the high fat!  My family really enjoyed it.  I substituted ground ginger for fresh (all I had), halved the hot sauce because we have little ones, and dredged the chicken in flour before putting it in the pan.  Yum!  Next time I might try sesame oil in place of the veggie oil to increase the asian flavoring.

I thought this recipe was okay. I dredged the chicken in flour like everybody suggested. I definately don't think it should be the main dish. I think the sauce should be used as a substitution for store bought teryaki sauce.

This was very good! My fiance loved it. I prepared it like a few others had suggested, I floured the chicken. I also doctored it up a bit by adding diced tomatoes, chopped green pepper and red onion. It was fabulous.  Also, the next day, I warmed up the chicken and tossed it with romaine lettuce for a chicken salad. Pretty good!

Wow, this was great! My husband said this is one of his favorite dishes that I have made. I love it when recipes are simple and he says that! I used the "rooster" hot sauce like other users suggested. It was too hot for me so I may cut it down a little next time. My husband added more though after I served it so it's really a matter of personal taste. I also dredged the chicken in flour before cooking like others suggested and I sauteed some onions as well. We loved it!

This was a very good recipe but for me the soy sauce was a little overpowering. I will definatly try this recipe again but with a little more brown sugar and honey to counter the soy sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out way too salty.  My family wouldn't eat more than a couple bites.  I don't think I'll be making this again...unless I have some time to play around with it and change some things.

This recipe is really great and easy.  I added broccoli, carrots, snow peas and mushrooms.  Also, once the veggies were cooked I added some Udon noodles for the last few minutes to heat through.  If you're worried about a thin sauce add these noodles and they'll soak the sauce right up and taste great.  I've added this recipe as one of my easy weeknight staples.

Yummy! I added sauteed onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms to the chicken and served over rice. It turned it into a stir fry dish. The fresh ginger is amazing in the sauce. My boyfriend ate three plates!

It was good and really easy to make and took no time at all. I love Rooster Sauce, and against my better judgment I used 2 Tablespoons. Next time I will use I maybe even a half a Tb, and 2 Tb Korean Red Pepper Paste too make it thick and add heat with out the mouth burning I incurred from the Rooster Sauce. I also dredged the chicken in flour for a crispier chicken and I think that helped a lot. Not Bad, will probably make this again some time. With a few changes of course.

Great flavor. I only used 1 tbp of tabasco and it was nearly too hot for me, but in a good way. Per the other reviewers, I breaded the chicken first, then used extra virgin coconut oil to brown both sides. The sauce was very glossy and a pretty color. I am looking forward to making this again.

Great!  My picky 11yr old loved it!  Did dredge in flour & cut down the hot sauce a bit, also added 2 tbs of garlic instead of tsp (i read it incorrectly), but turned out great still.  This is a keeper!! TFS

This recipe is great but there is waaaaay too much hot sauce!  I usually use sriracha sauce and use just a teaspoon and it is still very spicy.  I cook some vegetables (pea pods, onions, red peppers) in soy sauce at the same time as the chicken and then add them in towards the end once the sauce has thickened.  I have also made this with shrimp and it is very good.

I coated the chicken in cornstarch first.  I didn't have any honey so I added a little extra sugar and I like things spicy so I added some red pepper flakes.  It was great with vegetables served over rice.

Delicious.  Everybody loved it and asked for it to be added as a regular.  (12 & 15 year old)  I followed advice of many and lightly floured the chicken and doubled the sauce.  Will triple the sauce next time-not enough for the rice to soak up.

this is so easy and delicious!  i also tossed the chicken in flour/cornstarch before cooking and it made such a nice, crispy outside.  the sauce was delicious, and even though I used Sriracha (rooster) it wasn't excessively hot.  My "it's too spicy" 4 year old son ate every bite and fought for leftovers with 7 year old daughter.  This is definately a keeper, and on my top 3 best ever list!

Delicious and easy to make.  I also used sirachi hot sauce and it gave the chicken just the perfect dish.  Use only one tablespoon if you don't want it too hot.

This was a really great meal for how fast it was.  I half the ginger because my husband does not like ginger but I think next time I will put just 1/4 of the ginger. Everyone really enjoyed it and would like for me to make again.  This is a keeper.

Very good chicken recipe. I added a chopped onion,a green pepper and brocolli. As others did, I dredged the chicken in flour to thicken the sauce and aid in the stickiness. Came out great. I think i will cut back on the ginger root next time but thats just personal taste. I wonder how this would be if you added some orange juice and zest. I may need to try that. I love orange chicken.

This was good but still needs some tweaking for our family.  I dredged the chicken in flour per PP.  I think I scorched the sauce because I had the heat up to medium-high to thicken it.  Might add a bit more honey next time.

I love this and have been making something very similar to it for a while.  The only real difference is I use part soy and part teriyaki sauce, and about half the brown sugar.  I also use garlic powder and ground ginger in favour of the fresh.  I usually make a big quadruple batch of the marinade and store it in the fridge, since I use it so often!  This is awesome with steak and pork chops too!

I lOVED this recipe! I usually don't like anything with soy sauce or that is asian influenced, but my husband does so I decided to make it. I baked it instead of doing it in the pan, and I dind't have any ginger either. The flavor was awesome!!

Excellent, easy, fast and versatile.  Whole family (two boys 8 and 11) loved it.  I agree with others, use 1 tbls of hot sauce.  I added carrots and broccoli.

This was easy to make but not well liked. Too much ginger and thicken it in the end to get the sauce to stick.  I did it with cornstarch. I will not be making this again.

I only used half the hot sauce, since my children were eating it. I doubled the sauce. It was WONDERFUL! By far, the best Asian-type meal I've made. Thanks!

Update: this has been in my regular meal rotation at least since I wrote the review eight years ago. Great recipe!

This was ok. The ginger was way too much and all i could taste at times. Also, i love spicy food so this was fine but if you don't like a lot of spice, i would cut back a little bit. Otherthan that, it was good. I also added onion and green pepper.

Very good recipe.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly using Rooster sauce as the hot sauce.  It was pretty spicy, next time I'll use 1 tbsp.  I thought it might be too sweet, but not at all - it was perfect.  Adding orange juice and zest or adding toasted sesame seeds would be nice variations I'll try later.

Excellent!  My boyfriend and I really liked this dish.  We served it over rice and had broccoli as a side dish.  Next time we'll add the broccoli right to the chicken and sauce as they're cooking.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the chicken up into chunks and then dipped it in flour before cooking. This made the sauce sticky. I will use a little less ginger next time and only 1 tablespoon of hot sauce because my husband thought it was a little too spicy. Other than that, great recipe!!

What an awesome, easy recipe!  I did add chili sauce as suggested by anothe user and floured the chicken and it turned out almost too spicey but wonderful!  This will be made again and again in our household.

This was very good.  Following the advice of others, I cut my chicken into bite-size pieces, and after seasoning with a bit of salt and pepper, I shook the pieces in a bag with flour before browning in oil on medium high heat.  I also added the Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to the sauce mix along with some chopped up green onions at the end.  It was delicious and easy since I had all ingredients on hand. I had it on top of Jasmine rice while the mister had it in a roll.  Great both ways.  Next time, I would make a bit extra sauce (maybe 1/3 more) so I could have some to spoon over the rice.  What I did make reduced very quickly.

I'll make this again. My kids liked it and it was easy.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and coated with flour first. I think I went a little heavy with it, though. The chicken turned out slightly soggy rather than crispy. Next time, I'll use less and I'll add some veggies and cashews as others suggested.

We loved it - my 19mos old daughter gobbled her portion up both nights. I eliminated the hot sauce since I planned to serve it to her as well and it was still plenty flavorful. I doubled the sauce as others suggested. I also, threw in some roasted peanuts. Served over sticky rice...yummy.

This was so easy and so good!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which I coaked in flour as others had recommended.  For the sauce, I only added 1 tbls of hot sauce, and it was very spicey.  In my opinion, 2 tbls would have been way to much.  After browning the chicken I added the sauce and let it cook down for a couple of minutes, transfered it all into a baking dished and baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, then let it stand a a few minutes for the sauce to cool and thicken up.  It turned out great, I will be making this again.

Phenominal recipe! I doubled it to 8 servings (I was having guests), and it came out PERFECT! Sticky, sweet and spicy, just as promised. All I did differently was add some finely chopped red onions and a sprinkling pf curry powder into the sauce. My friends were raving! Thank you for posting this delicious recipe.

This was reeeeeeeally good!  I used half lite soy sauce and half regular.  It didn't say what kind of hot sauce to use, so I used sriracha, but didn't put in the full 2 Tbs. b/c sriracha is super hot!  All in all, it was really delicious!  Serve with stir fried veggies and rice.

My husband likes this a lot! Great recipe! I use a bit of cornstarch to thicken it, and added frozen asparagus stir fry.  Only thing I would like to try is to add fresh stir fried veggies to this!

Something seemed off with the sauce to me and even with franks red hot which is known for more flavor then heat it was still to spicy for 1 of my kids. I would halve the hot sauce. It had a sort of chemically smell. I tasted some with the chicken then doctored it up with some rice wine vinegar. I doubled the sauce and regretted it, its not the kind you can use in your rice. A light amount made the chicken okay. My oldest asked for seconds but with such mixed reviews I dont think I will be making it again.

My family loved this recipe.  I took the suggestion of dredging the chicken in flour and the consistancy came out great.  I also added some bell pepper and pinapple chunks and served over jasmine rice. I was so good, my husband is already asking me to make it again.

Great Recipe!!! Quick, simple and oh so tasty.  My fiance can't stop talking about it.  I served it with rice and a simple side salad makes a great (quick) week night meal.  I did take the advice of others and coated my chicken in seasoned flour before browning.  Came out perfectly!

If you adjust the ingredients to make more than four servings DON'T increase the amount of hot sauce.  Everyone at dinner was sweating by the end of the meal.  Owwwwww!

This was really, really good!  I made it according to directions, however I used the hot "rooster" sauce.  I will probably use less of that next time, as I don't want to have the fire hot spicy chicken that I ended up having.   Nonetheless, it was very good!

I got applause for this recipe! I used molasses in place of the honey and jalapeno juice in place of the hot sauce because that is what I had on hand. So good. I also added red peppers and onions to the chicken to make a yummy stir fry over rice. Great!!

This recipe was pretty good to me, but the ginger was a little over powering to me. I did dredge my chicken in flour first, so stickiness was no issue at all. Served with steamed brocolli mixed in and over white rice. Topped with chopped green onions. Hubby didnt care for it. He wasnt sure if it was the soy taste, or the ginger, but probably would not make again since its just the two of us. Update 3/31/09 - I am going to go ahead and up my rating to a 4 star. I enjoyed the leftovers of this over the week, since the hubby wouldnt help me finish them up. I feel like the ginger toned down just a bit with time. I would consider making this and then making small batches for work lunches, but cut the recipe in half when doing so.

My family loves this chicken. I have prepared it both ways now.  First time I did the chicken breaded in flour and they really loved it.  The second time, I was feeling lazy and cooked it just the way the recipes states and they still liked it but did prefer the chicken with flour method.

great recipe!  easy to make, and delicious.  i cut the amount of hot sauce and soy sauce in half, which made it just the right amount of flavor (any more and i think it would have overwhelmed the dish).  i also dredged the chicken in flour before searing them like other reviewers had suggested.  it turned out perfectly!

Easy recipe with great flavor.  The husband who generally doesn't like asian food even went back for seconds!  Careful on the salting, or it could be too much.  Will definitely cook this again, but think that I may throw some pineapple chunks in next time!!

Mine came out sticky and spicy, but not all that sweet.  I felt like there was something missing, but I'm not sure what.  If I could just figure that out, this would be great.  I did dredge my chicken in a combination of flour and cornstarch, so that's probably why I had no problems with the sauce becoming sticky.  I also cooked everything in a wok.  Because I added the sauce early, thinking there would be a problem, my sauce also carmelized really well while I waited to make sure the chicken was cooked through.  I'm going to try adding more brown sugar, but I think if I could just find the right addition on the sour side, this could be a five star dish -- a quick and easy five star dish at that!

This was okay.  Wasn't sticky at all which is what I was hoping for, and even with half the hot sauce it was way too spicy.  If I make this again I will certainly need to adjust the ingredients and form my own recipe.  Pretty disappointing.

I cut the chicken up into cubes, and dredged it like other viewers have suggested. And because of that, I doubled the amount of sauce, as the flour would soak up all of it and there wasnt much to begin with. This recipe was delicious! Definitely a keeper! Was sweet,spicy and sticky as it is titled. Makes very good leftovers for lunch the next day too!

Wonderful recipe!!  I made it for the first time for my husband and a friend of ours and it turned out perfect.  I followed the suggestion and dredged the chicken in flour.  The sauce was nice and thick and really didn't take too much time.

Whew, this sure is spicy, using Franks Red Hot Sauce.  I was only going to give it 4 stars but my husband insisted it was a 5 and wants me to make it again.  I doubled the sauce so there was enough to pour over brown rice.

I followed this recipe as is. I probably let it simmer a little longer than directed. I thought it was great! Unfortunatley my 3 year old did not like it. But I will make this again. What an easy delicious way to make chicken. Thanks!

Made this over the weekend. Only change I made was using low sodium soy instead of regular soy.  This was delicious.  Kids and hubby loved it.  Will be making this again soon.

Really Really good!  Next time I will double the sauce.  I sauteed onions, peppers and asparagus with the chicken and served the whole thing over brown rice.  I will probably dredge the chicken in flour next time.  Keeper!

This recipe was very easy to make and turned out delicious. Dredged the chicken, as other reviewers did. Substituted hot sauce for some red pepper flakes. Sauce lived up to its name: sweet, spicy, and sticky! Mmmm!

This was excellent. The only thing I changed was that I dredged the chicken in flour before I put it in the pan. I loved this chicken and it will become a staple in our household.

Mmm!  I love spicy and this certainly lived up to its name!  Well, it wasn't that sweet but it was good.  I used sriracha for the hot sauce and I sprinkled LOTS of pepper.  Maybe a tad too much.  But it was deliciously spicy.  =)  Not to mention easy to make!  Thanks!

Loved it!!!! Kid Friendly Changes Include:  1/2 tbl Rooster Hot Sauce, 2 tbl brown sugar, dredge the chicken first, and don't simmer sauce first.  (It's unnecessary.)  Fry chicken in a nice hot pan and add sauce as soon as it is browned.  Turn it to low a simmer briefly for a gorgeous thick 'sauce'.  We LOVE it!  Kids and all.

This was really really good!  I was a little hesitant when I was mixing all those ingredients together.   I added a few more shakes of hot sauce and a generous squeeze of honey after it cooked for a few minutes.   I plan on making this often! Thanks so much!

AMAZING! This tasted so much like what I get at Thai restaurants. So flavorful but very hot. I didn't have the amount of hot sauce that it called for so I just used one tablespoon and WOAH! I love hot and spicy foods, but this would have been insane with two tablespoons. I also used twice the amount of garlic because I am a big garlic fan. It was amazing! I will FOR SURE make this again!

This was REALLY good.....The sauce is SO good...I sauteed some asparagus, onion and bellpepper, then added to the cooked chicken, then added the sauce mixture.....so tasty.....I also halved the hot sauce, and cooked the chicken in Pam Spray.  After everything was together, I noticed it not thickening up as much as I'd like, so I did a little cornstarch/water mixture and tossed it in to give it that restaurant type glaze look and texture.......

This was great! I didn't have hot sauce so I borrowed some Indonesian hot sauce from my Indonesian friend. She told me it was hot, so I only used 1 T. Our mouths were on fire!!! My advice on this recipe is to know your hot sauce, and of coarse flour your chicken. I used a generous spray of PAM to cook everything without oil, and it was great.

Fantastic! Husband said it tastes like we ordered take-out. Minor modifications: I had no honey so I used maple syrup - the real kind, added sweet peppers & carrots, doubled the sauce and used cayenne pepper (less than 1/4 tsp) instead of the red pepper flakes. I think the siracha hot sauce would be even better. Loved this and will be making & passing along to friends!

we loved this dish! I used rooster sauce and 2 tablespoons was too much and we like it hot. Next time will use a little less. I also floured the chicken first. and used 2 tablespoons of brown suger. Really great flavor. I will make this again and again

This was good, made it last night. I had some changes as well, added onions, carrots and peas to the chicken after it browned for a sec, then added the sauce. Gave more of a stir fry/thai feel. Then I served it over Basmati rice. Pretty delicious, however I had to make double the sauce to really cover all the chicken.

Good flavor. I added a couple Tbsp of flour to the chicken. Also, I reduced the amount of soy sauce to 2 Tbsp to reduce the amount of sodium and didn't use any salt. Served with brown rice and steamed green beans.

Good flavor, but not nearly as "sticky" as I'd expected--the chicken puts out a lot of water as it cooks, and became dried out as I tried in vain to cook sauce enough to become syrupy. Next time I'm planning to cook sauce down first until it reaches the syrupy stage, then add the chicken after it's mostly cooked.

Great flavor, but this dish is just a bit saltier than I care for.  Next time I'll try using low sodium soy sauce instead of the "leaded" version.  On the upside, the chicken was great and, like other reviewers have mentioned, the addition of some onion and a little bell pepper with some hot rice make this a tasty meal!

WAY too much hot sauce!!  I tasted the sauce before I put it on the chicken and ended up throwing it out.  I tried the recipe again and cut the hot sauce to around 1/4 tsp.  The dark soya sauce made the recipe color not appealing.  I will not be making this one again!

Hubby and I both really liked this.  Kiddos thought it was too spicy.  I think next time, I would add less hot sauce or maybe add a hot pepper that's more traditional chinese to the adult's.  I know that my kids would love the sweetness of it then.  That being said, I did flour the chicken and browned it really well. I added julienned carrots to the sauce,and simmered the sauce while browning the chicken and cooking the rice.  When the chicken was browned, added the sauce and let it cook down.  I know others have said this, but it really is restaurant quality and taste.  My sauce thickened up beautifully!  An hour later, after the leftovers were in the fridge and I went to do dishes, I actually scraped the sauce from the pan, and ate it.  Excellent!

Delicious!!!  Made this last week.  My 2 teen sons (who usually eat) and run LOVED it and lingered to eat seconds.  It was great.  I, too, lightly floured the chicken with flour mixed with salt and pepper before cooking and used 2 TBSP of brown sugar.  I used Frank's hot sauce in the amt stated in the recipe.  It gave it the perfect kick.  Thanks so much for this one.  Definitely a keeper!!

Made this with pork instead of chicken, since that was what I had on hand, and it was delicious!  A little spicey for the kids, but they still liked it.  You could always tone down the hot sauce.

Great!  Followed others comments and floured the chicken.  I seared it and browned it a little before adding the sauce.  The sauce was beautiful and thick after about 10 minutes.  I simmered it on Med/High and that seemed to make the difference.  Delicious sauce and my husband loves, loves it.

The flavor was fantastic.  I doubled the sauce but it didn't thicken like I thought it would.  I've since read some reviews that said to cook over high heat (boiling) for a few minutes and that should do the trick.  I'll try that next time!

My husband LOVES this recipe - its quick, easy, uses ingredients I ALWAYS have on hand.  I usually double the recipe so there's lots of leftovers.

I doubled the sauce on this recipe because of other reviews saying there wasn't enough since I added some stir fry veggies.  The sauce ended up being way to powerful for me, but my boyfriend liked if even though he agreed it was quite tangy.  I will make this again but without extra sauce.  The veggies I added were great though, (celery, brocoli, carrots, red peppers, onions, and water chestnuts).  The chicken was tender too!..I had no problem with my sauces thickness like others.  I gave it 10 minutes to thicken up and it was just great.

Great flavors!  For those who commented it took longer to cook and sauce didn't thicken--I think you needed to cook at a high heat--my sauce was bubbling and seemed on the verge of burning, but just kept stirring and coating the chicken with the sauce.  Try a heavy iron skillet so you can keep the heat high.  Don't need to dredge with flour--extra work!

The sauce was amazing. At first we didn't taste the spice, but it progressively built by the end of the plate. We'll probably add a bit more hot sauce next time to get the kick right away, but this recipe is outstanding.

Fantastic recipe!!! The combo of flavors was PERFECT! Really does taste like a great chinese take out =). I think next time I will double the sauce and cook broccoli with the other half of the sauce. Thanks for a great recipe Kate!

This gets five stars because it was really good, really easy and used ingredients I had in the cupboard.  Also it's good because you could add a lot to it (cashews, mushrooms, green onions, broccoli.....) to make it even better.  I used tabasco sauce and it gave it quite a kick.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find it too be too salty, and I am sensitive to salt, I just didn't salt the chicken.   My only variations from the recipe was I doubled the sauce and I took the advice of others and dredged it through flour.  I served this chicken with rice and the flour helped thicken the sauce to coat the rice.

Another great creation. The soy sauce in my opinion made it a little too salty for my taste, my husband loved it. I think I'll get low sodium next time. I also breaded my chicken and it came out nice and sticky and sweet. I had steamed rice and steamed veggies. Thumbs up!!

For anyone sensitive to salt, I wouldn't salt your chicken at all during the cooking process. I didn't even think about it when I made mine, but the sauce you cook in is almost ALL soy sauce. And what is soy sauce? Pretty much liquid salt. It was an ok dish.. Not very sticky like it looked in the picture. Just kinda absorbed into the chicken. Still tasted pretty good though.

This dish was so fantastic! I had debated whether or not to cook or get chinese take out and I decided to make this.. well I was not disappointed.  MIne ended up very spicy though, which was fine, but I might cut back on the hot sauce next time.  You must try this dish if you love general tso's chicken.

I wish there were more stars to rate this recipe as it was so good!  I actually used chicken thighs cut up as it was what I had.  I also breaded the chicken with first an egg (beaten) and then some panko and flour with my usual spices mixed in.  I fried it that way and set aside.  I did the rest of the recipe as it was.  Let me tell you it was so tasty and I got rave reviews all around.  I am thinking of trying it with the chicken breasts next time and not battering it to see what happens.  The sauce was complete magic!

Everyone enjoyed this chicken, I dredged the chicken in flour mixed with salt and pepper, browned it on both sides and then added the sauce. I did double the sauce and I used powered ginger instead of fresh. Served with brown rice and veg. I used texas pete hot sauce (all I had on hand), was not spicy at all. Next time I will try a different hot sauce. Family already asking me to make again. Thank you Kate for a awesome recipe.

Delish! Made with chicken instead of shrimp, becuase that is what we like. I followed other reveiws and doubled the sauce. Plus I added carrots, water chestnuts, and green bell pepper. Perfect recipe for the sauce. Also used 2 T. fresh grated ginger and fried with the garlic. The flavor was so rich and wonderful!

What a great new chicken recipe that my husband and I both really liked!  I took the advice of others and floured the chicken first which caused the sauce to thicken and stick to the chicken perfectly.  Since I was feeding a little one, I also reduced the hot sauce to 1tsp, which was fine for us.

This was great! I too coated the chicken with flour used more ginger and garlic than called for and omitted the hot sauce because my boyfriend has sissy taste.  *Edit* Forgot to add that I use reduced sodium soy sauce as I think regular would be too salty.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed other suggestions here and dredged the chicken in flour & cornstarch before cooking.  I used 1 tbsp. of Yucateca habanero hot sauce and the heat was just right.  Next time I will add a little bit more brown sugar and add cashews.  I would love to figure out how to make chicken wings with the sauce!

This was so good.  Mine did not turn out sticky by any means... but that was okay.  I did add some corn starch/water mix to the sauce and got it to the desired consistancy and then added it to the chicken.  I also just used 1 T of Hot Sauce since I have little children. I just added more to my dish later.  Overall, I will definitely be using this one again.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe as stated but doubled the sauce and added some onion, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. Didn't have any chili sauce so used chili flakes. This was an easy and simple dish and will add it into my file for something different to do with chicken.

HOT!! HOT!!  We LOVE spicy food, but if you make this recipe using Thai "rooster sauce", as one reviewer recommended, it will rock your world!!   As some other viewers recommended, I dredged my chicken pieces in flour, so the sauce turned out nice and thick and "sticky".  My rice wasn't all it should be (I tried using Aborio rice in place of sticky (sweet) rice), so I didn't have quite the buffer VERY spicy dish needed.  Even so, I will definiely make this again.  I love the burn!

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  Like other reviewers, I did flour the chicken first.  I also added more honey than the recipe called for, as I wasn't tasting the "sweet" part.  I had this with spicy lo mein and it was delicious! This recipe is a keeper:)

Fantastic!! Yes, definitely dredge the chicken pieces in flour seasoned with salt & pepper. This tasted like take-out Chinese Sesame Chicken, but healthier since no fried chicken! I actually sprinkled my finished product with sesame seeds I had in my panty. EXCELLENT!

We loved this dish but it wasn't sticky, which could be due to not measuring the honey. Chicken tenders made the meat even more tender and succulent and we cooked it in toasted sesame oil instead of vegetable oil which really added to the flavor.   We didn't have hot sauce so I added 1t chili powder and 2T water (probably unnecessary). The sauce reduced nicely and concentrated the flavor. Served over bulgur wheat this was the perfect meal! A side of roasted, but still crispy, green beans rounded it out. I highly recommend this dish. Make sure to use fresh ginger, not dried.

Excellent recipe. It was indeed sticky, sweet and spicy as described. I added sliced green onions during the final 3 minutes just because I like them. I would also increase the sauce because I like it over the rice I served it with.

This was great! I followed the advice to flour the chicken, I also sauteed the sauce while I browned the chicken. It was delicious! We served it with great freshly baked bread and green beans - French Asian fusion anyone? :)

My husband's eyes rolled to the back of his head when he tasted this chicken. He actually asked me if I really made it. Adding the flour was a great suggestion and it really thickened the sauce. I served this with brown rice and broccoli & my husband took a fresh orange slice and drizzed the juice over the chicken before eating it.

This was not what I was expecting, but it tasted OK.  I thought the sauce would be thicker, like more of a glaze on the chicken, but after simmering for several minutes, it never thickened up.  I added in some thawed stir fry veggies at the end, and served over rice.  I'm not sure that I'll make it again.

As others have said, I had some problems with the sauce not getting thick, but as I served with rice I just used it as a sauce for that. The only thing I changed was to lay off the hot sauce; I'm not a fan of overly spicy foods so I only used a little bit. Will be making this again.

Thank you thank you thank you! This recipe was AWESOME. Even my husband (who has a chick "thing") wanted to know why I didn't make more and when are we having it again. He was extremely skeptical when I told him about it and to say it was delicious is an understatement. It goes into dinner rotation no doubt. Thank you again, it was stellar. I did dredge my chicken in flour before I browned it and added a little more brown sugar to sweeten it a bit more. This recipe rocks.

Actually tried this with pork as I had no chicken on hand.  Cut up a 2.5 lb tenderloin into bite size pieces, used ground ginger as I had no fresh root, and the entire family loved it!

Tasted great! Next time I think I will double up on the sauce, or atleast use judgement on whether I think it is enough or not (as chicken breasts can be different sizes.)  I also used a corn based hot sauce. I thought that 2 tablespoons of Tobasco would be really hot.

My husband and I made this last night and it was awesome!  We doubled the sauce simply because we like to have the extra sauce for the rice and vegetables.  It is a great base recipe.  You could add or take away anything and it would still be good.

This was fantastic chicken!  I followed other suggestions and coated the chicken in flour before browning, added some chopped onion, used 1 tbsp. of hot sauce and added and extra tbsp of brown sugar.  The whole family loved it.  This is going to be in my chiken rotation from now on.  Delicious!!!

Wow! Absolutely delicious! For once I followed a recipe exactly. I forgot to look at any of the reviews, just looked at the stars, and the ingredient flavors looked good to me, so I went with it. Ok well, I changed a couple minor things. Had no fresh ginger, so used minced ginger from a jar, and I used chicken tenderloins instead of full breasts. I will use fresh ginger next time because I like having things to chew :) Anyway, this was just superb! My sauce didn't thicken, but I have no doubt that it would have, had I let it cook longer. The brown sugar in it seemed to be caramelizing, which I'm sure would have helped thicken it up. I really wanted to have sauce to put over the rice though, so I didn't let it get too thick. I will be making this again, probably in a much bigger quantity, because my husband and I ate it all!

I went to the site to look for a chicken recipe that had ingredients I had in the site and this one was right there as recipe of the day. A total winner. After reading the reviews I also lightly floured the chicken and doubled the sauce. Used cornstarch to thicken and threw scallions in the sauce and cooked broccoli at the end. Used the sriracha hot chili sauce but only half the amount and it was plenty spicy. I see adding red and yellow bell pepper next time also, but you could add any veggies to this and it would be great. And it was very easy! A new favorite.

Very good and easy. Spicy, but we love spice. The sauce wasn't thick, so I drained off some sauce and added about 2 tsp of cornstarch..it thickened up well.  I also added shrimp, mushrooms, onions, red & yellow bell peppers and doubled the sauce. I used sriracha hot sauce..just cut back on sriracha if you don't like spice. Will make again..and soon.

It was so easy to make! And my husband, who doesn't like anything except spicy beef LOVED it! He actually asked me to make it again! I didn't actually measure anything, it all just ended up in the pan but it was wonderful over rice and with steamed carrots. Will make often!

I usually skim through others' opinions to get ideas on the recipe, and I'm glad I did. I doubled the sauce measurements and it was barely enough for 3 chicken breasts cut up, and I'm not a big fan of a lot of sauce so it was just right. I used chili garlic sauce and extra brown sugar to offset the saltiness of the soy. I also made a cornstarch "roux" (1 teas. to 1/4 c. hot water, mix well and add to sauce and simmer awhile). Next time I will use low sodium soy instead. It turned out wonderful over white rice. It's definitely going in my keeper file.

I was really disapointed with this recipe after reading all the reviews. This did NOT taste sweet at all- it is WAY to spicy! My kids could barely eat it. My husband, who loves spicy stuff; loved this. I think I might give it one more try but I will cut way down on the hot sauce and add more brown sugar/honey.

My family loved it! I lightly floured chicken before cooking and used 2 tablespoons of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, beware though that made it pretty spicy! Use only one tablespoon maybe if your not used to hot.

I added 3 chopped up scallions, extra garlic and ginger and topped with sesame seeds. The hot sauce of choice was Sriracha. I tossed the chicken in 1 tbsp of flour before browning it but I still needed to add a couple of teaspoons of arrow root powder to thicken the sauce after 10 minutes. It was very good but the dominant flavour was spicy (which I love) but next time I might use less hot sauce to let the sweetness come out. I would definitely make it again!

This chicken was amazing!  I found this recipe today when I was trying to decide what to do about my plain old bonless chicken breast that I was planning on serving for dinner tonight.  I was in the mood for something different but didn't have a clue how to get there.  This was exactly what I was looking for!  I followed a suggestion left by others and tossed the chicken first in a zipper bag with some flower.  I also didn't have fresh ginger so just used jarred and it still came out incredible!  My sauce thickened nicely and I threw in a bag of frozen broccoli right into the mix when it was done and heated through.  Way better than the local Chinese place because I knew I had made it with my own fresh, well-trimmed chicken.  I also took some chicken out of the pan after it browned to serve my young kids, before I added the sauce.  So nice not to have to make two different meals!

Made this with stir fry vegetables, cutting the amount of soy in half.  Made for an excellent meal and still had plenty of soy flavor.

I made this meal last night for my husband & I. We really loved it!!!  I didn't have hot sauce on hand, so I used about 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper. Well we were definately working up a sweat. Next time I'll only use about 1/2 tsp. of C.R.P.! Other than that...YUM YUM!  I also floured my strips which was the only way to go (for us anyways)! Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I will make this again and again!

OMG! This recipe was amazing! I did not have all the ingredients but used substitutions and it was still the best ever. I followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and used 1 tablespoon of ginger powder and  cut the chicken into pieces,  floured it, and cooked it. I did not have hot sauce so I used 1tsp of red pepper bits. It still came out sweet and spicy. I love this recipe!!! I will try again and again!!!

A very simple and tasty dish. Scaled back on the honey and used chilli powder instead of hot sauce. Will definitely make again.

I went by the directions and the salt content was EXTREME to say the least. It was too over-powering. I had to gather the meat off the plates and run it under water to get the sauce off. After that, it was edible. The flavor was good. I will probably try this again with only a fraction of the soy sauce.

Very yummy!  Per some other reviews, I cut my chicken into cubes and coated with flour.  I felt this dish needed some veggies, so I did a quick sautee of carrots, broc, zuch and red peppers and then set aside while I cooked the chicken.  Added my sauce and let it cook for a bit, then added my veggies back in and served over white rice.  Voila, dinner was served and we really enjoyed the sweet and spicy combo!

Made this for my family and they loved it. I didn't have any hot sauce so I used a little orange juice instead. I also topped with chopped scallions. I will make more sauce next time b/c I like alot of sauce! This is a keeper and I will make it again!

I would give this recipe a five star rating, but I had to add flour to the chicken like many of the others had to do to make this dish sticky. The flavors are terrific, and the mix of sweet and spicy with the sticky texture was really great. I used the Sriracha hot sauce and two tablespoons of that was just perfect!

very yummy sauce. My husband added broccoli, onion and green and red bell pepper.  Made a wonderful meal. I wish I could try it w/o all the veggies. I bet that'd be good too!

I am just starting to cook oriental food, which I have never done before.  This was the first dish I have ever made.  My family and I liked it.  I am not sure if I made it wrong but had a really soy - salty flavor.  I may scale back just a bit...may just be I am not used to the flavor.  But will definitely make this again.

This chicken was sooooo good. I decreased the hot sauce quite a bit, and cut the soy sauce in half as others suggested, and used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. My husband doesn't care for sweet chicken, but he really liked this.

I noticed that most of the flavor in the sauce was from soy sauce, so I decided to add some rice wine vinegar, some orange juice, and zest to give it a more complex flavor. It ended up really nicely.

This recipe was so easy and quick. It was also sooo delicious! It was a little too spicy for me so next time I may use less hot sauce, but I have a sensative tongue. I also used ground ginger instead of the ginger root, but still came out just as well I think. Very good recipe.

I was torn between a 4 and 5.  Definite 5 on taste, so I did go with that, but as other reviewers said it really is a thin sauce that needs some work.  This is suprising as when you're mixing the sauce it seems quite thick, then when you pour it on and heat it it turns very thin.  Still, I just brought to a boil a couple times and reduced and it turned out to an acceptable thickness.  Dredging the chicken in four is not a bad idea either.  Also, I only had Tapatio which I didn't think would taste great for a hot sauce so I used Korean hot chile paste instead and it was GREAT.  I will definitely add this to the rotation, thank you!

This was very good, my fiance and I both enjoyed it. I coated the chicken in flour, as other reviewers suggested, and I used less hot sauce. The flavor was very nice, it just needs a little more to it, rather than just chicken. Next time I will add some veggies to make it more of a complete meal.

This is, hands down, one of my FAVORITE recipes. There are a few things I changed, though. I used 1 tsp. ginger and garlic powder to taste in the sauce. I also doubled the sauce because it was not enough for us. Also, after cooking the chicken, I only poured half of the sauce in with the chicken to coat it, transferred it to a bowl and then cooked the rest of the sauce alone and added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit..you have to watch the sauce carefully though because it burns easily. We also served it with pasta and just mixed it all together. Very good with either pasta or rice. Thanks for this recipe!

Everyone really enjoyed this which is rare in my family. I followed the recipe except that I didn't use any hot sauce because I have toddlers. I browned the chicken, added the sauce and then simmered on med-low for about 15 minutes but it still wasn't sticky. So when I was ready to serve I turned the heat up to high for about 1-2 minutes which did the trick. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe

Great recipe!  I used less hot sauce in the recipe so the family could add it to suit individual tastes.  Like another reviewer, I added onion.  I did not have the ginger, so I substituted 5-spice powder.

This is good, even if you reduce the hot sauce to half.  So even if you are afraid of it being hot, the sauce is still good without adding all of the hot sauce.   I will make this again.

I like that I had everything for this recipe already in my cupboard.  Like other reviewers, I dredged my chicken, and that really helped to thicken up the sauce.  Next time, I'll make it a little more sweet and a little less spicy, though.

Yep...we like this! I made it a little extra hot...I don't care much for tabasco, so I use a different kind of hot sauce that burns pretty good! Also, after the simmer, there was quite a bit of sauce in the pan so I thickened it with cornstarch and water and drizzled it over the chicken. I served the chicken over fresh, steamed green beans and it was great!

So good!  So spicy!  Next time I will throw in a red bell pepper, some water chestnuts & broccoli to add a bit.  Didn't even think about it since the recipe didn't call for anything other than chicken.  I made up the full amount of sauce but only used 2 chicken breasts & this was perfect on the sauce for us as everything ususally seems to have not enough. I served with rice & egg rolls.  It was really good & this one's a keeper for sure!  UPDATE - made with sirloin & was really good!!  Hubby said he liked even better than with the chicken!

This was pretty good.  After 10 minutes the sauce still had not thickened so instead of overcooked chicken, we had runny sauce.  The taste was good though, maybe could have been a little sweeter..but really good.  Unlike another reviewer I thought this could have been a little more spicier as well.  I almost cut down on the hot sauce...but I'm glad I didn't.  If you like "hot" do not cut back...maybe even add more.  Overall pretty good!

I made this a while back and remember being hesitant to eat the left overs because it was too salty.  It's Very good, but it's very important to use low sodium soy sauce.  (this is coming from a Cajun who thinks most food is bland and uses extra salt and spice)  With low sodium soy sauce, it will probably be 5 star.

wasnt very good IMO!I had to much of a wang to it. It was spicy and sticky, but had to strong of a flavor for me to enjoy without combining with something else to lessen the strong flavor.

HOOO! Let me tell you, this was one spicy dish. It tasted great, but the recipes calls for way too much hot sauce. My partner who thrives off of spicy food started sweating and choking because it was so much. We'll cook it again, but next time we'll cut back on the hot sauce and increase the honey and brown sugar.

Very easy, tasty and quick. I only used two breast halves and omitted the hot sauce and salt and pepper. I also used a sodium reduced soy sauce and it came out perfect, no overpowering soy sauce flavor. I had sauce left over so I served the sauce over some noodles with the chicken on the side. It was a quick and delicious plate. My family loved it :D

This is a good recipes, however I agree you need to coat the chicken in flour before you fry it.  I also add stirfried onions, peppers and pineapple to the chicken and sauce.  Also you can toss toasted sesame seeds right in the sauce before you pour it on the chicken.

Soooo GOOD! I made it for my hubby on Valentines day and he adored it! I had to add more hot sauce to give the sauce a little more kick but other than that the recipe was perfect. I served it over a bed of jasmine rice.

Really quick and easy. I was looking for a recipe that I already had all the ingredients for, and this is wonderful. I made it the way it was directed, but I think next time I'll cut the hot sauce down to 1 tbsp because it was too hot for my family. Although I didn't mind the heat I think I would be able to enjoy the sweet flavor more if there was less hot sauce. I served the chicken over brown rice.

This recipe was just awesome! It tasted like chicken you would get at a Chinese restaurant! I made it exactly as the recipe called for (expect I put 1/2 tsp. hot sauce instead of 2 tsp.) Thanks so much, what a winner! This is definetly a favorite!

This was a great healthy alternative to delivery Chinese.  I diced up the chicken for bite size pieces and I added toasted sesame seeds to the sauce and when served. The only thing is a bit too hot for my taste. May lessen or even omit hot sauce.Other that that tasted like sesame chicken from our favorite chinese delivery. Will definitely try again soon. May even add some stir fry vegetables.

We loved this recipe.  It was so quick and easy, and we had all the ingredients on hand.  We sprinkled it with sesame seeds and served with rice and steamed edamame.  This recipe is great as is, but we are going to use it as a base and experiment with other ingredients like lemongrass and cilantro, or maybe orange juice and orange zest.  Two tbsp of hot sauce might be a little much for some people.

I dredged the chicken in flour to give the sauce more body. I thought it tasted too much of soy sauce, I was expecting more of a sweet taste, and I even added water to make more sauce to go over rice. If I made it again I would tweak it more to give it a better flavor.

Use low sodium soy sauce or cut the amount.  I will be using this recipe again.  The sauce consistency is wonderful, and I am eating it right now served over crisp lettuce with a side of jasmine rice.  Yum despite the salt!

I made this last night and loved it.  I used 2 chicken breasts instead of 4, no ginger, and low sodium soy sauce.  I cooked it for a little longer than suggested and the sauce thickened up perfectly (chicken was just slightly overdone so next time I'll cut the breasts into thicker slices).  Just before serving, I mixed in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies (cooked in a separate pan so the sauce wouldn't dilute).  Served it all over basmati rice.  Dee-lish!!

This is a seriously tastey meal.  The only thing I changed was to put in 1 tablespoon of tabasco instead of 2.  With the one it was pretty spicey and I have a spicy pallet.  My kids would have never been able to eat with the 2 tablespoons.  This was easy and tastey.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good, the only thing I did different was to pour the sauce on top of the chicken and bake it. I think it was little overdone. Will make on top of the stove next time as written. Flavors were great. Served with Colorful Fried Rice on this site. Thanks!

This chicken was AMAZING!!!!  One of the best recipes I've made from this website.  I coated the chicken in flour before browning and my sauce thickened up almost immediately when I added it.  I served it over rice and I wish I would have doubled the sauce to mix in with the rice.  But by itself, the chicken was incredible.  It was the perfect amount of spicy to me!  I will make this again for sure.

YUM YUM YUM!  This is delicious.  I did coat the chicken with flour before placing it in the skillet as others have suggested.  I also used 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger in place of the fresh ginger root.  I used the full amount of hot sauce, however if you don't like spicy then cut it back-this dish definately has spice!

Mine didn't thicken up so I added some cornstarch mixed with soy sauce. I would make this again but as a marinade for chicken on the grill and thicken the sauce separately.

This was a great recipe!  I took the other reviewers' advice and dredged the chicken through flour before cooking it.  This helped (a lot) in thicking the sauce.  I only added a tbls of Frank's hot sauce and thought it was still a little too spicy. Would be great with cashews and veggies. Overall, I thought it was a wonderful, easy week night recipe!! Thank you!!

This was absolutely fantastic! The only thing I did differently was to let it simmer longer.(This helped the sauce thicken up. It took longer than 8-10 min)

This was really good.  I doubled the sauce (except I didn't quite double the soy sauce & used low-sodium).  As suggested I floured the chicken pieces & preheated the sauce before adding to chicken. It cooked up really nicely---thickened & was sticky when I placed it on the rice.

We LOVED this chicken!  Followed the recipe, but only used two chicken breasts. Wonderful! Will definitely make again, and again.

This was better than most Chinese food recipes I've tried, but it still wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I replaced 1/2 the soy sauce with orange juice and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was still a little salty for my taste. I think I'll try it again with a little more OJ and less soy sauce and see how it goes.

My family, including my 2yo loved this recipe. I did cut back a lot on the hot sauce and added a little flour. I also double the recipe so I would have enough sauce to go with the rice. YUM YUM!!!!

This is a very good recipe! Even my wife liked it... and she doesn't eat much. She liked the simple ingredients. I used chicken breasts, cut into smaller pieces, and floured them before adding to the oil. I only added one tablespoon of hot sauce. It was just the right amount of spice for my wife. I added extra on my plate. Very yummy! We will make this again.

This was really good...here's what I did: I used the sauce as a marinade for about 4 hours. Then I dredged the chicken (I used boneless/skinless thighs) in flour, whole (didn't chop into strips). I seared them about a minute a side in hot olive oil, then turned the heat down to low, covered them, and let them cook 4 minutes. Then I flipped them, poured a little Yoshida's on top, and let them cook another 4 minutes, covered. They were REALLY GOOD.

This dish was very good and quite easy to make. I agree with the others who suggested doubling the sauce. I found it to be slightly "soy saucy" so next time I will reduce the amount of soy sauce. I also recommend adding slightly more honey if you prefer a sauce that is more sweet than spicy. My personal preference of flavor, so overall, this is a fantastic recipe.

This is a very good recipe and we all enjoyed it.However it is very salty.I used a lower sodium soy sauce,but, still a little bit too salty.Maybe I will try less soy sauce next time.It is very tasty and I think the chicken wouild be very good in a wrap.

Very good. I also didn't add any salt. And used a little less hot sauce. Perfect for me and my little ones. My husband added hot sauce on his though. That's the way to do it if you're worried it will being to hot.

very good but a little to spicy for me, but my husband liked it alot and said it wasn't spicy enough.  I put a little extra honey in it as it was cooking and it still turned out pretty spicy for me.  Also I didn't have fresh ginger root so I used ground ginger instead.  I put half a bag of frozen veggies in with it and they were delicious. I skipped the salt for seasoning the chicken.  The soy sauce is salty enough.  I did put ground pepper on it before I cooked the chicken and I used olive oil spray not vegetable oil. This meal is definiely on my make again list.

My husband hates when I cook chinese type food at home but he loved this dish!  I didn't add all the hot sauce at first but after tasting the sauce, it seemed too sweet so I added it later and it turned out perfect.

This was okay. I thought it had a strange taste, but the kids liked it. I doubled the sauce, however there was no need, it was way too much.
