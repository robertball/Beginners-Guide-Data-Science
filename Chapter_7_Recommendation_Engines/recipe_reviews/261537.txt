My family lived this recipe, even my picky eater at it. I added extra brown sugar because we like sweet. We didn't use the goat chz

Very interesting combination of flavors!  I'm not sure the goat cheese is what it needed; maybe feta would have been better.  It all came together easy enough and looked pretty on the plate.  Hubby and I both agreed that it was different and we'd eat it again, just not anytime too soon.

I made this for my wife and I and loved it. I only made two chops so I halved the seasoning for the meat but made 4 pineapple rings and half a red onion. We both loved it. Simple and delicious.

Excellent recipe! I made this with pork sirloin as it was on sale, and everything come out beautifully. Tragically I forgot to buy chipotle powder, so I subbed 1/2 tsp ground cayenne and 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika to get a decent approximation. Overall, the prep was simple enough for a weeknight, but the result was “special” enough for Sunday dinner, and it was given the “knocked it out of the park” and “heck yes, I’d pay for a plate of this” designations. 10/10, WILL make this again.

Tastes great and easy to make - but it looks like something special from a restaurant. Mix of spices with pineapples and goat cheese is an interesting  & perfect combination of flavors.

This is a dish that you either love or hate. My husband and son loved this and both rated it 5 stars. I hated it -- it was too spicy and I didn't like the cinnamon -- and rated it as 2 stars. I've averaged the rating to 4 stars.

Edit: I forgot to add the goat cheese when I served it. I put the goat cheese on the leftovers. The goat cheese helped a lot with mellowing out the heat, and took it from 2 stars to 3 for me.

Made as directed except left out the chile powder as we do not eat spicy foods.  It was delicious!  Next time I will only use half an onion though.
