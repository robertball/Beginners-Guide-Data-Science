This is by far the worst cookie recipe I've ever had the misfortune to find and make. It's dry, difficult to cut, and doesn't taste good. Spare yourself!

I made these and added 1/2 cup of coconut and 1/2 cup or so of milk chocolate chips.  The dough will seem very dry but it cut fine after chilling and baked up beautifully.  I don't think Jennymoon did it right....they aren't that bad.  They tasted like little yellow cakes with built in chocolate frosting...Yum!! They were a very good quick cookie to make in a hurry....

Not as bad as Jennymoon stated.  Cut the oil, increase butter to 1/2 cup and add nuts or chocolate chips.

The batter smelled, tasted, and looked wonderful...alas, it was utter deception.  These cookies burn easily, even at a lower temp setting.  They thin out very quickly and end up very hard without being burnt.  The idea is great, b/c you can use a variety of cake mix flavors and add-ins.  They turned out very dry and looked a mess...
