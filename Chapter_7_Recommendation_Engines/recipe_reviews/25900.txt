As always I never follow recipes, so this rating is NOT based on the exact ingredients.  I had to do some swapping oute b/c of allergies...so I changed it up a bit.  I stuck w/ the green zucchini and yellow squash, but sliced it.  Then I took about 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic and sauteed it in 1 Tbsp butter.  I added the sliced zucchini and squash to the garlic butter, and then added some EVOO and "Mrs. Dash" garlic seasoning.  I baked it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, it was wonderful

I have been making this for years and love it! There are a variety of ways to use it and to mix it up a bit as well. I use fresh tomatoes when in season and add canned chopped green chilies (you may need to drain some of the tomato juices if it is going to be too thin). You have to be careful with green chilies if you are heat sensitive, I am not. But if you are, start with approximately 1 heaping T. chilies to 3 large fresh tomatoes (or 1 16 oz can). I also use fresh basil and thyme (2 large basil leaves and large sprig of thyme, leave it whole, cook, then remove prior to eating or chop and leave in the dish). When using the herbs, it is okay to omit the chilies, but I use the herbs with the chilies and love this flavor combination. This also makes a good pasta sauce (leave all your tomato juices in), top it with fresh parmesan cheese...love it! Sometimes I omit the green chilies and add black olives when using it as a pasta sauce, delicious too. Use your imagination, this dish can be varied to suit your taste. To novice cooks: I grow my own herbs, so I am always experimenting. I live in an apartment and grow them and veggies on my deck in the summer. In the winter I have a small herb garden in front of my sliding door. Herbs are easy, easy to grow! You can have a small herb garden in any window in your home year round. It is far less expensive than buying them in the grocery store and SO much better than the dried herbs!

Not normally a squash fan, but this was fantastic!  Unstead of using garlic powder, I sauteed fresh minced garlic before adding the squash and zucchini.  My family loves garlic and this gives it a great flavor.

This is a really good & healthy recipe just as written. If you want to send it off the scale great and still be fairly healthy, try this:  when the dish is completed, sprinkle some butter buds over the top, add a small amount of grated cheddar (2% lowers the calories), and sprinkle some italian seasoned bread crumbs over it all.  It takes a small amount, so you aren't adding too many calories or fat.  For about a 2 person sized helping, I added about a tablespoon each of cheese and bread crumbs - I estimate it added about a 100 calories.  As low cal as this dish already is, you can afford it.  Now it tastes like you are eating a decadent squash casserole :-)   I could eat this every week!

I browned a little bit of minced garlic with my onion and threw in everything else.  I only used 2 zucchini and one big squash and that was enough for 2 people.  I also like to let my vegetables get a little bit more tender  than crispy, so I let it cook on medium for about 20 mins.  I liked it, I'll probably make it again.

I thought this was very good.  I didn't have diced tomatoes with green chilis, but did have a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of green chilis, so used those. It turned out quite good.

Great dish! I kept the base recipe the same and followed other suggestions.  Sauteed onion and 3 cloves of garlic then added the squash and zucchini, some red pepper, and a can of Rotel tomato and green chiles (drain 1/4 of can).  Due to the portion, I cooked it in a wok while making kabobs.  It was a great overlap to put together the kabobs and use the excess veggies.  I ended up making rice to go with the leftovers.  I would plan to make rice as a side.  The squash and zucchini cooks down so drain the Rotel 1/4 total.

I had higher hopes for this side, and feel let down. I can't say I'm a big fan of boiling summer squash. Next time I think I'll grill the squash for 10 minutes on the grill and cook the tomato/onion as directed and combine together.

I love this recipe! They served something just like it at Little America's cafe and we always ordered it. I cut my squash and zucchini diff thicknesses from really thin to about 1/4" thick, it gives each bite a little diff flavor. I saute all the veggies in a little bit of butter until browned, it really changes the taste. Then add the diced tomatoes and let boil for maybe 10 min. Great reheated the next day.

Ok so I'm going this 4 stars, even though I really didn't use ingredients or cook as directed. First off, I used 2 fresh tomatoes, 3 cloves of fresh garlic,a fresh chili pepper and I sliced the zukes and squash. Next I tossed it all together with about 1/2 T olive oil in a 8x8 baking pan, covered and cooked for 15 mins @350. So I sliced them thick and wasn't too impressed with the taste, so I added a very generous few shakes of garlic salt and pepper and topped with about 3/4 c of parm cheese and broiled for 5 more mins. After all this they were pretty good, not great though.

Very easy to cook. Word of advise if you have homegrown pepper use less than half. I also added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and it was delicious.

I loved this recipe.  The squash and onion, simmered for 20 minutes, makes a nice, rich broth.  I used 3/4 tsp. of garlic powder and covered with water just to edge of top, stirring frequently during cooking.  I also added some black pepper.  The flavors blend in beautifully and I'll be making this easy to make dish again and again.

I really like the idea of adding the rotel to sweet, mild zucchini and squash... it went really well together.  I actually sauteed the onion in about a tsp of olive oil before adding everything else to the pot.  Then after the veggies were almost done, I poured everything into a baking dish, mixed in some parmesan cheese and then topped it with a little parmesan and some italian panko crumbs and broiled it for 3-4 mins, which added a nice texture.  It was great with turkey quinoa meatloaf and spruced up mashed potatoes/cauliflower!

I've made this a couple of times with a slight variation.  I'm not crazy about green chile peppers, so I use the canned tomatoes with Italian seasoning in them (usually basil, oregano and garlic).  It's pretty good.  Not knock-your-socks-off great or anything, but good.  Easy way to use fresh produce from the farmer's market in the fall.

Eh, the dish was alright. The flavors didn't pop for me and was kind of bland. I wasn't a fan of the spiciness either, meh.

Not bad, but a little bland for my taste. I should've taken the advice of others and minced some fresh garlic into the mix. I served it with jasmine rice and topped it with a few dashes of cajun season.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I had purple cabbage left over, so I cut it up and added to the dish.  It gave it a very nice color. I love the spicey taste, but then I love spicey food. This recipe is a keeper for me.

Loved this. I did not have tomatoes. Sauteed fresh garlic in olive oil and added the rest of the ingredients including broccoli and carrots.

This was really good and very easy!  I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic in olive oil, then sauteed the onions and then added the cubed squash and zucchini.  Then I added one can of Rotel and let it simmer on medium low for about 15 minutes.  I will def be making this again!

I was very surprised about how good this was.  Like others, I have WAY too much zucchini on my hands, and thought this sounded like an easy side dish for enchiladas (and healthier than rice and beans).  I cubed the zucchini as instructed, did not use any squash, and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos, rather than green chilis.  It was a little too spicy, but still really very good.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions and was plesantly surprised!  I will definitely be making this again soon.  Thank you Loracus!!

This was so spicy we had to separate the veggies from the tomato mixture to eat it.  But, I rated it high because the veggies tasted great.  Next time I will use half a can of tomatoes with chili peppers and half regular diced tomatoes to cut down on the spice.

Very good. I sauteed the diced onion & 2 cloves of garlic until soft & fragrant then added the squash & mild Rotel tomatoes sprinkled some pepper, garlic salt. Cooked for 20 min. Before serving I dotted with a little butter & some shredded cheddar cheese. I served it over wheat spaghetti with a side of garlic bread & fruit. So simple but so delicious!

I pretty much followed the recipe. I used real garlic instead of garlic powder. I was skeptical when I added the can of tomatoes and the next step in the directions said bring to a boil... there wasn't much liquid to boil. But the juices came out of the tomatoes and it worked perfectly. We really loved it. The only think I will do different next time I make it is cut the squash ahead of time to make prep time faster.

I got my non-squash eaters to eat this!  I think it was the tomatoes with chile peppers because we like things a little spicy.  Definitely FIVE STARS!

This was so good. I have a hard time finding ways to use squash and zucchini so my husband will eat. He devoured this and asked me to make it again. I made it with a Mexican dish since it had a kick to it. Went great with the meal.

Wow, talk about zesty! This was really good, but a bit spicy with the green chiles. If you love spicy, you will adore this recipe! I still really liked it and had the leftovers the next day!

There ended up with a lot of liquid that I had to pour out in order to make the veggies serve-able. Also, beside the kick from the green chiles, there wasn't much flavor.

this was an EXCELLENT and easy recipe! however, i did a little spin to it, i took about 3 Jonsonville mild itilian sausage,cut it up, and saute it with onions and a smiged of oil. i LEFT the grease in the pan, for it make excellent zesty flavor..i then added the squash and zucchini and diced tomatoes and chili's, however i added another can of diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion. (i wanted a more soupy texture) its great! i call it more of a "autumn chili" because i added more tomatoes for more of a soup.... defiantly will be making this again!!! :)

I made a few changes per some other reviews and thought this was super delicious!  I sauteed the zucchini and squash in some olive oil with garlic and Italian seasoning and then added 2 fresh chopped tomatoes and a few chopped black olives.  I just let everything crisp up and then served it over pasta...simple, delicious, a great summer meal!

The squash and zucchini have potential, but they are completely overpowered by the tomatoes.  I could see this tasting better over pasta, but I guess I just had a different flavor in mind beforehand.

i made this for my family and EVERYONE loved it! it had a little spice and a great taste! I will use this everytime i make squash/zucchini now. Definately a new staple in my home. I sauteed some fresh minced garlic in the pan before i added the veggies instead of that powder.

wow that was good.   I am single so there is a lot leftover.  I had it as my main meal tonight.   I used more garlic powder because I love garlic.  I love zucchini,  but sometimes have issues with the texture of yellow squash  I wrapped up some of it in a spinach tortilla and it made a great filling dinner.     I think I might try to scramble some of the leftover in with a couple of eggs in the morning  really yummy.   thanks

Awesome veggie side dish.  The chiles in the tomatoes gives this a great surge of heat and flavor - I loved the addition of the garlic powder.  Super easy and really tasty.

The zucchini ended up overcooked and the squash was barely cooked. Hubby really liked this dish anyway so I may do this again as a side but I surely won't be using butternut squash and will add the zucchini half way through cooking time.

I used all fresh ingredients from my garden and used minced garlic instead of powdered and used fresh chopped peppers & tomatoes and boiled in 1/4 cup of water in sauce pan. Salt &. Pepper to taste.

I made this recipe with a few tweaks. First, I sauteed the onions separately until they got nice and soft. Secondly, I added about 1/2 tsp. cumin and one can of drained and rinsed pinto beans with the remaining ingredients. I served it over a baked potato with a bit of lowfat sour cream. Delicious, filling, and nutritious meal that's also easy on the wallet. Thank you!

I really thought this would end up tasting like it was missing something...not so! Simple, quick and delicious. I used fresh garlic cloves that I crushed and sauteed with the squash and onion before adding the Rotel. We all enjoyed this recipe.

Excellent taste!  I also added a tiny pinch of Stevia (about 1/4 packet) for a little more sweetness with no added calories.  Also I will try adding some tomato paste or sauce if I want to use over pasta.

This was a great side dish. I only used two zucchini and two yellow squash. I saw a new canned diced tomato with cilantro and lime juice that was supposed to be zesty, so I thought it would be prerfect for this recipe, but it wasn't very zesty! Next time I make this I will use the diced tomato with green chiles. Served this with a quick and easy chicken chili also from this site. Great dinner, thank you!

Delicious recipe! As you can see in my pic I only had yellow squash. We enjoyed this zesty squash over rice with turkey meatballs. I did add a little water to stretch the sauce a little and added some chopped parsley. Saving this one!

I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, mushrooms, zuchhini, and yellow squash.  I did not use any oil at all...just simmered it all in the juice from the can of diced tomatoes. Added some salt and pepper, and it was delicious and healthy.  You could add some freshly grated parm and make it even better!

This is a great recipe!  It didn’t seem too spicy to me.  The green chilies added that nice little kick.  I also sautéed the onions and some garlic in the pan just until the onions started to turn translucent before I added everything else in.  My boyfriend loved it and I’m sure I’ll be making it again. :)

I actually really loved this recipe, and the possibilities are endless for ways to make it your own. 

The one mistake I made was too much tomato- it became almost pasta sauce like, which is definitely not the desired effect.

This turned out fantastic and only took maybe 15 min to cook. I covered with a lid and kept stirring so it would not stick

Follow directions only omitted diced tomatoes.  Next time I may add them (just not a fan of tomatoes). Overall it was good, just what I was looking for.

Easy and good. Instead of boiling ingredients it's good sauteing  squashes and onion in skillet in a little olive oil or cooking spray  till tender, then adding remaining ingredients till heated through. Sprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese or shredded Mexican or cheese of choice.

Excellent.  used fresh garlic and did add additional thyme, but this recipe is an easy winner.  I actually did not boil the veggies, I sauteed them.  Even though I overcooked the zucchini and squash a little bit, it was delicious, and actually even a little tastier two days later.  One time i made it I did not have the chiles, so I used  8 ounces of medium salsa, and it was also awesome.  Since it is so simple, this can be easily adjusted to taste French, Italian, or other flavors.

A nice change from our usual Zucchini/Yellow squash dish. I like the slight heat the chili's provided. The next day I warmed the leftovers with a sprinkle of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese - delicious!

This was soooo great, even though I messed it up royally (hence my name)... It came out marvelous and my boyfriend LOVED.  Thank goodness when I messed it up, I stumbled onto an amazing vegetable base to be used as soup/stew stock and will be versatile enough for seafood, chicken or beef.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I love zucchini and squash but my husband hates vegetables. He does, however, love spicy food. So this was a great way for him to try new food. I love it and it's spicy so he doesn't mind the flavor of the vegetables.

This was a quick and delicious meal.  I added some additional spices to mine as well.  I cooked the zucchini with a couple of garlic cloves in EVOO before adding the tomatoes.  I also added some Goya seasoning to complement the zestiness of the dish.

We like spicy food. I added black olives and mushrooms.
