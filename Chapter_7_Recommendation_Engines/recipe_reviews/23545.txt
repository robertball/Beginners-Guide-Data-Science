I also used coconut milk and it worked just fine.  I also left out the rum so guests could just add it if they wished, but be careful not to leave in the freezer too long if you do this because it will freeze solid without alcohol.  To give you an idea of quantity - this makes 2 full punch bowls, so make sure you've got a couple of big containers available when mixing it up.  Everyone at the get together has requested the recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  It was gone in the first hour of our party because everyone loved it so much!  I made two slight alterations though.  I read the other reviews were people said they felt there were too many big pineapple chunks, so I threw the can of crushed pineapples into my food processor and blended it in to even smaller pieces.  So the punch still had texture, but you could drink it through a straw.  Also, I used coconut rum instead of regular rum, and I poured in the entire bottle (750 mL).  I froze the punch overnight and it was half frozen and very slushy once I broke it up and then just left it in the fridge all day.  I can't say enough how much everyone loved this drink.  Next time we have a party this size (about 30 people) I will make double!

This was so easy to make and was easier to drink!!  I did not use rum but I used 16 oz of coconut milk and not as much lemon lime drink.  Everyone loved it at a dinner party I attended.  I will make it over and over again.

This was sooo good!  I divided this into a few containers in the freezer and just brought out a new one when the pitcher was running low.  Next time I'll substitute the crushed pineapple for additional pineapple juice.  Even with putting it through the food processor, it was still too chunky for my taste.  I also used an entire bottle of coconut rum (750 ml), which ended up being about an extra 1 1/2 c, and it wasn't overpowering - in fact you still couldn't taste the alcohol.  I'm going to make more to have on hand in the freezer for upcoming BBQ's.

I made this punch for our square dance club's luau dance and it was a huge hit.  I adjusted the recipe slightly - 3 quarts vanilla ice cream (2 x 1.5 qt container), 20 oz crushed pineapple (including the juice), 18 oz cream of coconut, 80 oz pineapple juice (probably could have used all of the two 46 oz cans in hindsight), and 4 liters 7Up.  I mixed everything but the 7Up the night before and froze it in an 8 qt plastic container (mixture filled it about 3/4 full - 6 qts).  Put it in the fridge about 4 hours before the dance to let it thaw a bit.  Scooped the semi frozen mixture into the punch bowl and gradually added the 7Up while whisking to break up the clumps.  Had a nice slushy / icy texture and terrific taste.  Made 2 full punch bowls full.  P.S. No rum - but it was still wonderful!

The flavor was very good, but the crushed pineapple made for a very funky texture.  I will give this recipe another shot, but I think I will just use pineapple juice instead.

Very cool and refreshing.  It was gone in no time!  All the guests at my luau raved about it!  It makes a nice creamy, slushy punch, and it fills a large punch bowl (2 gallons).  If you need to make it nonalcoholic, rum extract works well.

I've made a non-alcoholic version of this punch a couple of times for my daughters parties (birthday, New Years Eve) and it is so good!  I wish I could find an occasion to make it with some rum for me!

I made this punch for a baby shower yesterday and everyone loved it!  I omitted the rum and can of crushed pineapple.  I just mixed everything together and served it that way...without freezing it.  It was delicious and creamy.  I will make this again.

This is absolutely my favorite punch!  I used coconut milk and left out the rum and it was perfect!  I made sure to check it in the freezer, stirring every so often.  The result was a slushy pina colada!  Everyone raved!  Thanks for sharing, I will make over and over again!

This was a HUGE hit at my Hawaiian-theme party!  The only things I changed were using pineapple puree instead of crushed pineapple and coconut-flavored rum instead of regular rum.  Luckily this recipe makes a LOT because it was very popular!  Even my friends who don't drink had to have some of this tasty concoction....  It was so light on alcohol that no one was even slightly "tipsy" -- which worked well for my function.  But if you want different results, you should add more than just 2 cups of rum.

This is the best recipe, I added less lemon-line beverage and more rum, you need a large container to mix it all in. I found that after mixing it, place in two separate containers (I use tupperware flour and sugar canisters) for freezing.

Ooh la la, oh so good!  This punch is so good!  I followed the recipe as written and was very happy.  I did use the crushed pineapple, but processed the heck out of it with my food processor after reading other reviews not being happy with the "chunks".  It worked great while still adding a little bit of texture to the punch.  This does make a ton, so be prepared with a big bowl or pitcher.  Also, mine did not freeze to slushy consistency in 4 hours, it took much longer.

This punch was the best. I served it last night and everyone loved it. They even requested me to bring it for our 4th of July trip. I made the recipe as is for 30, and there was only about 3 cups left. I also used the entire bottle of rum (750ml) and you couldn't taste the alcohol. I couldn't find coconut cream so I just used coconut milk and it came out great. Loved it!!!

Okay, check this out!  I had a group of ladies over and this recipe was a HUGE hit.  And let me add that if you have any leftovers, all you have to do is store it in the freezer and give it a stir when you're in the mood for a drink.  This is to-die-for!

Totally amazing! This punch has a wonderful pina colada flavor. I used coconut milk instead of cream, a regular carbonated water and a little less rum. A very festive and delicious drink, we were very surprised, hope,  this will become a one of my favorite drinks from now.

Really liked this. Tried both with parrot bay coconut rum and with bacardi light rum. The alcohol is almost undetectable with the parrot bay, next time I think I will make it with the bacardi. Good either way though!

Also, it does eventually freeze solid if in the freezer overnight. Something to keep in mind. Was nice and slushy during our party though.

Excellent for a summer barbecue.  I put the pineapple in the blender for a quick whir so it would be more of a puree and used coconut rum instead of regular (I also added more than the recipe specifies).  We had no leftovers and a lot of very "happy" guests.

I used 7Up and used half of the bottle in the mixture and froze it and then I added the rest to the punch bowl before adding the frozen mixture.  It was a hit for our luau!

I made a regular and virgin pitcher for my son's graduation party. It was 90 degrees, so this was very refreshing. We used 3/4 of the 750ml Coconut Rum bottle. I did preblend the pineapple pieces in blender with the juice, and used coconut milk instead of cream.  This was soooo good.  Even my uncles  who don't like froo-froo drinks, loved it. I added a little bit of rum flavoring to the virgin pitcher.  Overall it was a big success.  Thanks soo much for sharing this recipe!!

This was fantastic!  I purchased 3 of those big reusable Glad plastic containers with lids and pulled one out of the freezer whenever the punch bowl was empty at a party.  The recipe yeilds a lot.  I was very happy I didn't double.  Yummy!

This is really good. I made it for my daughter's graduation and had to make more just to have it around. So refreshing to just have a glass in the evening. I don't add the 7up until serving.

This was definitely a crowd pleaser.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I took the crushed pineapple and put it thru the blender first.  Which also made it a little thicker and much easier to drink.

This drink had a strange consistancy and was too thick to really enjoy on a hot day. Nobody enjoyed it, and I was stuck with a whole punch bowl leftoever after my party.

Totally awesome punch! :)  I made it with a 16oz can of cream of coconut instead of putting chunky pineapple in it, and halved the recipe cause it was for a small party. It turned out great! :)  I left out the rum and made it virgin so if people wanted to add some rum in, they could. :) I'll definitely make this again during the summer.  Very refreshing and yummy! :9

Made some changes but it was amazing.  I omitted crushed pineapple after reading other reviews plus I did want a creamy texture.  I added extra pineapple juice instead. We had it at my daughters 1st birthday and now my guests are requesting the same recipe at her 2nd. I didn't add rum to make it kid friendly but had a bottle of coconut rum and guest could add as they wish.

This punch is wonderful. Made according to the directions and wouldn't change a thing. Took it to a large family birthday party (all adults) and it was a huge hit. There was just enough to get everyone in a festive mood.

Delicious! It does make about 2 punch bowls at least.. but yes be careful about freezing it too long-- even with the rum it was a solid brick after i left it overnight..

This is a 5 star recipe as is. I have also altered it by putting in the whole can of cream of coconut, &/or using coconut rum. The specific sizes don't really matter - If you only have a 15 ounce can of crushed pineapple it'll be fine. But, I have to say I love the pineapple chunks. We serve it with spoons and it is great to have the chunks in it. By the end of it it's melted and easy to drink despite the chunks. Straws wouldn't work but if you want a drinkable mix just leave out the crushed pineapple and maybe use pineapple rum. The recipe is very flexible that way.

This was delicious! Minor changes: I made mine with 15 oz (a whole can) of coconut milk and 3 cups coconut rum. I didn't use pineapple chunks, just pineapple juice. I only used half of a 2 liter of soda, too. It was great. I think it would be wonderful if you followed the recipe as is, too. I placed it in the freezer about 6 hours before our party in a very large mixing bowl WITHOUT a lid (when it was covered it didn't seem to be setting), then took it out and stirred it to smooth it out a bit. We had 5 adults at our game night and we finished the whole bowl! It was enough to have several tall drinks each. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

The taste of this recipe is absolutely delicious.  I wanted a slushy type of drink that you can scoop out and add pop to by the glass versus a pre-made punch so I didn't add the pop to the recipe.  It did freeze fairly solid and was not scoopable.  I also couldn't find cream of coconut so used a can of coconut milk as others suggested.  I recommend using coconut rum such as Parrot Bay and increasing the rum to three or four cups instead of just two cups to help it not freeze so solid.  I let my frozen mixture soften enough for me to scoop it out with an ice cream scoop and then I ran it through my blender in batches and returned it to the freezer.  Definitely a keeper good for summer or winter.

Loved this recipe.  It was super easy and everyone loved it!  I made the whole batch, then put half in one bucket and half in the other.  I added alcohol to one half and left the other half with out.  Both turned out great!

This was a big hit over the 4th of July.  I followed the tips and put the crushed pineapple with the juice through the processer, used a whole 16oz can of coconut cream and the entire 750ml bottle of coconut rum, mixed it up and froze it overnight in two 1gal ice cream buckets.  I let it thaw about an hour then mashed it up with a meat fork and stirred for the slush consistancy.  Topped each glass with whipped cream & a cherry.  I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.

I halved this recipe and it was pretty good. I had to freeze it overnight and then chop it up to get it to a nice slushy consistency, which made it even better. I actually loved the crused pineapple texture.

Made as directed, it good but a little bland. I added a good bit of coconut and pineapple extracts (maybe a tsp each), a small amount of banana extract, and 2 extra cups of rum - AMAZING!

Huge hit at our Luau celebration.   Recipe filled approx. two 3 quart pitchers.  I did purée the pineapple as suggested by others..and actually ended up using the blender to mix all the ingredients (except the soda).  After adding the soda I put in the freezer overnight.  If you do freeze overnight just make sure you have plenty of time for it to thaw the next day as it will be almost solid.

This punch is fabulous!  I've had to start making two batches of punch because we always run out before the main meal.

People loved this!  Here's my version:
"1/2 gal" of vanilla ice cream --they don't sell it in this size any more...you get several oz less.  (I used Breyer's brand) 
8 oz coconut milk,
46 oz pineapple juice,
3 C coconut rum (might try 3.5 C next time).

Blend ice cream w/ some of the liquid in batches in a blender until creamy.  Put in fridge.  If you try to ice it up in the freezer, it makes it difficult to pour due to the chunks.  I completely skipped the pineapple chunks & soda.

Substituted extra pineapple juice for the crushed pineapple after reading reviews about the drink being too chunky and it turned out good.

We made this for our annual Luau and the people loved it! Using the coconuts as a glass was a festive hit! Bought those at a party place.

This turned out great! I made it for a work function. Instead of ice cream I used frozen vanilla soy "ice cream" so it would be vegan friendly and a can light coconut milk because that's all the store had. I left a bottle of Malibu rum on the side so people had the option. Would make again for sure!

This was a hit at our Halloween party. I did not blend the pineapple because the punch was "Poltergeist Puke", so the chunks worked nicely. I made it without rum and used both coconut milk and cream of coconut. Kids and adults loved it and repeatedly came back for more. It was not taken out of the freezer ahead of time, so I had to microwave it a little at a time, mash it with a knife and repeat until it was a thick slush. I then added the sprite. It was thick like a frozen daiquiri. YUM!

I made this for a ball wind up party. It was SO good. It was gone in 1/2 hour and everyone loved it!! The only thing was that it was so filling. Kind of left me feeling bloated. Tasted fantastic though.

I had high hopes for this recipe because of all the great reviews but it is just too sweet and rich (and I love sweet things!).  I made it in advance to test it before serving it at a party but I could barely drink a glass.  Now, I have tons in the freezer I don't know what to do with.

I have made this at two parties in the past few months, and my guests love it. It really makes a lot of punch. Everyone really loves that it's slushy, refreshing, and you can hardly taste any alcohol in it.

This was awesome without any modifications.  I liked the chunks from the crush pineapple.  I make this recipe any time I have a party and it is a big hit.
