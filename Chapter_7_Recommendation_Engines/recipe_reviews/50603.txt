O.k. as is, but to me it's way better when using a white sauce (olive oil w/ minced garlic, warmed in microwave to infuse the oil) or a pesto sauce. We also like it with a stronger cheese like romano mixed w/ mozzerella. Fresh basil is really good on this too.

This was delicious!  I used a whole-wheat Boboli thin pizza crust, and instead of spaghetti sauce I just used plain tomato sauce sprinkled with Italian seasoning and parmesan cheece.  The artichoke hearts were sooo good cooked with the garlic.  I had some Gouda cheese that I had to use, so I used that instead of Colby.  This was the best pizza I've ever made!  I think next time I will double the garlic.  Oh, and I definitely didn't use that much cheese!  Maybe 1.5 cups of shredded cheese.

This pizza tasted really good for the first time that I made it with a good cheesy texture and delicious artichokes that make it worthwhile eating for one.

Would be 5 star I think if used different cheese. Perhaps mozzerella and some feta?  Great if  you are a fan of veggie pizza.  Made some modifications:  added about half of red bell pepper to the garlic/artichoke saute, and this really helped on issue of excess liquid that many reviews commented on.  Also, added fresh basil during about the last 3 minutes of cooking -- really adds to flavor.  Used Boboli pizza crust and sauce -- good choice.  Boboli crust instructions said to only cook for 10 minutes, whereas the recipe said 20.  Took out after 10, but flavors weren't quite there yet.  Put back in for about another 10, and it was much better, and crust held up fine to the extra 10 minutes of cooking.  Will make again.

Pizza is pizza.  I've even put clams and oysters on pizza.  I made this one years ago.  Just thought I would share some tips.  There is a conversion chart, somewhere, that shows how to mix tomatoe paste and make it into sauce, juice and catsup.  So, I never spend my money on premade sauces.  Whenever I use a sauce for pizza, I always mix in some oregano and some dried red pepper flakes.  It gives the taste of NYC to your pizza. I also like to add salt, but only to veggie only pizzas, and have even put olive oil on others, under the cheese, not too much, to give it that nutty flavor.

This is delicious! I put way more garlic on it than this calls for. I get the garlic pre-roasted from my grocery store's olive bar, that way there is no fuss, no muss. If I don't have those handy, I roast a whole garlic - cut the tops off and put a bit of olive oil over it and roast for about 40 minutes. Perfect for a lot of different dishes.  On this recipe, I use the Boboli ready-made crust and it's perfect. The whole thing from start to finish takes about 15-20 minutes. I also add some fresh (dried would work as well) basil.  Thank you for a great recipe!

We thought this was good, but seemed to be lacking something.  Maybe adding chicken, as one reviewer suggested, would help.  We use our own pizza crust recipe, so we altered it a little according to how we always cook pizza.  I put the sauce, tomatoes and artichokes first.  We cook it for about 15 minutes then add the cheese and cook for about 10 more minutes.  This keeps the cheese from burning.  Next time I wouldn't bother with cooking the artichoke liquid with the garlic.  I used pre-chopped garlic and would just add both of them to the pizza.  I didn't see much value in cooking the garlic in the artichoke liquid.

This was fabulous!  I used a blend of Italian cheese instead of the Colby Jack, Roma tomatos and sprinkled it with parmesan cheese before baking.  I made a 12" pizza, and 1 - 8 oz. package of cheese was more than enough.  Next time I'm going to add Feta cheese.  

Excellent!  Thank you so much, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a tasty pizza and went very well with some left-over Bodacious Broccoli Salad from this site that I served it with. But I'm one of those who don't see the point of the simmering liquid part. It makes it more time consuming, dirties a pot and is actually quite strange taste-wise. It gave the pizza a wierd, oily, preservetive-y taste that I really disliked. Luckily, I didn't have the patience to wait until the liquid thickened and poured most of it down the drain before adding. I think that rescued the meal. Next time I'll save the time and effort and put everything straight on the pizza. Otherwise good stuff.

Made this pizza with a homemade, whole grain crust, 2 extra tomatoes, and a mix of cheddar and mozzerella cheese.  450F is too hot for this length of time so I turned it down to 400F after the first 10 minutes.  It took about an extra 10-15 minutes to cook, make sure the crust is browning on the bottom.  My oven temperature is correct, you can check it easily with an oven thermometer.  My meat loving husband wasn't expecting to like it but he's already asked for me to make it again!

I loved this pizza! I added real bacon pieces, green peppers, & Motzarella cheese. Instead of the spaghetti sauce I used Pizza sauce. It was very flavorful. I will definately make this again.

Awesome good. Not nearly as good as what we've enjoyed in Rome, but then again there they use fresh locally grown artichokes, good, fresh pizza dough, fresh mozzarella and a minimum of fresh tomato sauce. But this isn't Rome. I used mozzarella rather than the Colby-Monterey Jack. We loved it right down to the last bite. The only thing I'll do differently next time is use my own, simple, unseasoned tomato sauce.

I thought it was good!  I used a refrigerated tube of pizza dough, roma tomatoes, and 2 cups of an Italian cheese blend.  It was plenty as the tube of pizza dough doesn't yield a whole lot!  Got a little done on the edges...maybe temp is too high or cut down on the baking time.

Did not find the artichoke and garlic were happy together and did not taste very well so this recipe bombed for me.

I made two of these, by cutting the recipe in half and making two medium thin-crust pizzas. One as written and one with the garlic in a white sauce that I came up with on my own that was similar to one I'd had from Garlic Jim's. I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site. To tell you the truth, I liked the white sauce better, as did my family. Could just be personal taste. I thank you for the inspiration.

Modified our pizza a bit.  Added feta cheese, chopped fresh basil and spinach.  Used about 1/4 of the cheese it called for and topped it off with some sliced olives and some grated Parmesan cheese.  It was outstanding!  Will definitely be making this one again!

This is an awesome pizza, but I agree with others that 1 pound is too much cheese. I also had to cook the artichoke liquid much longer than the recipe said for it to cook down. I added grilled chicken and that made it even better.

This pizza was delicious! My husband and I love artichokes so this was perfect for us, and the tomatoes and garlic add a great flavor along with it. Even my two year old, who doesn't like anything that doesn't have meat, ate about one and a half slices of this pizza. I think next time the only thing I would change is to add less cheese. It kind of overflowed a little onto the pizza stone so I think maybe half to three-quarters of the amount of cheese next time. Loved this recipes though, thank you for posting, Brandosgirl!

Nice flavor using 2 huge garlics! Would have been better if the crust was better. Used a Mia precooked crust. Will never buy one again. They are like eating cardboard covered with pizza sauce!

Too much artichoke for my taste and not enough of anything else. It probably isn't the recipe, just my preferences that made me not love it.

I didn't like this much at all. The marinated artichoke hearts just weren't to my liking, although I've used regular artichoke hearts on pizza before and it's great that way. I ended up scraping the artichokes off and eating what was left. I let hte tomatoes sit in a garlic/kosher salt/olive oil infusion for a few minutes before adding them to the pizza. I used about 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese, less than a pound as directed. Instead of spaghetti sauce I used "exquisite pizza sauce" from here and homemade "pizza dough III" for this. I won't make this one again, just didn't like it.

Loved the garlic & artichoke combination!  Used a whole-wheat flour & guiness breadmaker dough, and mozarella & goat-cheese for the cheeses. Yum!

My husband and I made this pizza last night.  We always use the Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough recipe from this site.  This pizza was delicious!  We didn't add as much cheese as it called for, but it was absolutely gourmet!

Make your own crust or try this on a pre-made crust.  Either way, you will love this homemade pizza.

I really enjoyed this pizza; but I just knew colby/monterey-jack wouldn't be a good fit for my tastes so I used a blend of italian cheeses and finished it off with a sprinkle of romano. I love artichokes and can't get enough garlic so this was a winner in my book. Next time I'll add some oregano, basil, or red pepper flakes as various reviewers have mentioned. thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe.  Easy to make with good flavours.  My husband who doesn't like artichokes tried it and had seconds!  I could see using this as an appetizer by substituting mini pitas for the pizza crust.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so delicious!  It was my first time trying artichokes, and the only thing I changed was that I added a can of mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion.  My family said there should have been more artichokes on it, and I agree.  Regardless, this was quick, easy, and satisfying!

I've made this multiple times and it has been great every time!  Be sure to use a jar of the marinated artichoke hearts and not the canned.  I've also added mushrooms & used different cheeses, it is always excellent!

This was wonderful!  Didn't have a prepared crust, so used flour tortillas for individual ones, and cut the baking time down to 10 mins.  Added some sauted mushrooms and some pepperoni slices.  This would be great for a French bread pizza, too.  I will be making this over and over!!

The BEST EVER!  I can not rate this pizza high enough.  I am not a huge meat fan so this was perfect.  The combination of everything was a perfect complement to each other.  Even my 1 year old could not get enough of it.  FAB!  Jamie Lawson

We liked the flavor of this but I had problems with sticking. I used Trader Joe's ready made fresh crust as a timesaver. Also added some cooked Italian sausage. It was a little bit liquidy but that was because I used fresh mozzerella.

Easy to make and good, but if you like a more salty flavor, use pepperoni or salt the artichokes.

Overall, quite tasty, but too much cheese (and we *love* cheese!)--would reduce it to 1/2 as much.  Would double the garlic to 4 cloves, we used a roasted garlic spaghetti sauce and it still didn't taste very garlicky.  Artichoke hearts were a wonderful topping.  The Quick and Easy Pizza Crust was perfect for this.

The pizza did not taste gourmet. There was too much cheese which made the pizza crust soggy.  There weren't enough toppings.  The artichoke juice did not boil down enough making the artichokes watery.  I consider gourmet a succulent blend of tastes. This was not.
