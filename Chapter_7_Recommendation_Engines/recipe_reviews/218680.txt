I found that this tasted good but would have had very little flavor (no onions, no garlic, no salt) without the mustard topping (which I almost forgot to add except for the fact that the burger definitely needed something). The fresh basil and mustard combination in the meat smelled awesome when I was mixing it up, but I didn't find it that strong tasting in the final product. I am wondering if dried basil would have provided a stronger basil flavor.

Used a sesame seed bagle with middle cut out lightly toasted. Used some ordinary seasoned bread crumbs instead.  Cooked to 172 degrees on meat thermometer. Came out great.
