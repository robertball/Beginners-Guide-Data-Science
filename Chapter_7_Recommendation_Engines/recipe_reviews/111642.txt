This was a good, hearty meal. The sauce is four stars as written. After tasting it, I added freshly ground black pepper, and fresh parsley, oregano, and basil. Though the directions don't say to, I drained most of the grease from the bacon mixture before adding it back into the sauce. I served this with a green salad and Mushroom and Cheddar Batter Bread by Cat Lady Cyndi. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Thanx to Pam's blog I decided to try this recipe and I must say I'm glad I did!  I really liked the sauce, it was full of pure flavors, the tomatoes, the beef, the bacon...  I gave this recipe 4 stars, because it needs a little kick, something to spice it up a bit.  But definitely added to the recipebook and will make again!

Alright, I changed this quite a bit, but I still used the same ingredients. I browned the beef, and then threw everything into the slow cooker on low for four hours (I'm a huge fan of my slow cooker, so I use it whenever possible). I added a good dash of Worcester sauce (love the stuff), about 1/4 cup of some leftover BBQ sauce (it NEEDED to be used somewhere), a dash of red pepper flakes, a can of Hunt's diced spicy red peppers in place of the tomato sauce (didn't have any), omitted the salt, and used rotini because I was out of shells. I only had Hormel real bacon pieces on hand, so I added those to the slow cooker in the final 10 minutes of cooking. When the pasta was cooked, I drained and rinsed it under cold water before I added it to the meat mixture in the slow cooker. The end result was fabulous; a hint of sweet from the BBQ sauce, and a bit of heat from the red pepper flakes and tomatoes. Thanks Alle (sorry for all the modifications!)

Quite plain, but the family enjoyed it. Kids love pasta. Added an extra tin of tomatoes.

Being big bacon fans, I knew I had to try this out on the family. I used sausage instead of ground beef, just 28oz crushed tomatoes (no tomato sauce) and added a teaspoon each of parsley and Italian seasoning. Otherwise followed the recipe. Teenagers devoured it. Next time I think I'll add more bacon, 'cause can you really ever have too much??

I used a mixture of ground beef and ground lamb. It was amazing!

This was a great, easy dish to make. Made some small modifications. My husband and I like spicy.  We cooked the ground beef with red pepper flakes, used 6 garlic cloves (fresh, not minced), replaced shell noodles with mostaccioli noodles and topped it off with shredded parmesean cheese. It was fantastic!

Cooked as the recipe says. When I mixed the pasta together I used less noodles than called for. Turned out great. Liked the sauce! Thanks for the recipe.

I added more spices to the meat to make it spicy (crushed red pepper, chives, black pepper). It was awesome. I also didn't use that much bacon. It was simple and easy but great.

I added some paprika, a bit of cider vinegar and a roux sauce before i added my shells. It is a VERY good "football sunday" meal!!!! I am going to make some jalapeno cornbread to go with it too!
