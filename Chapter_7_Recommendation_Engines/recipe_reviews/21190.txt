Yum!  I love these, and make them about 3 times each month!  My vegetarian husband loves these as well.  What's great about this recipe is how much you can adapt the recipe.  I like to make these peppers the night after making a stir fry, to use up extra cooked rice.  I have also stuffed the peppers with leftover risotto from the previous night's dinner.  I find the salt in the feta is plenty, so I don't add any extra.  These are great to use up any vegetables you have on hand (I have thrown in corn, broccoli, mushrooms, etc.), and I love to use fresh basil in these.  Also, regular onions are fine if you don't have green onions on hand.

Great Recipe! I made a few changes. I added ground beef, fresh garlic, and minced yellow onion. I also used whole peppers. A great tip for making sure your whole peppers don't fall over in the oven is to place them sitting in a muffin pan. Works great! This was the easiest and most delcious stuffed pepper recipe I have made! Thank you!

So Yummmy!  I roasted red, yellow and green peppers for 15 minutes.  I sauteed onion,garlic, and fresh basil, parsley and chives for 5 min then added small cut up pieces of chicken breasts.  Let that sautee for 15 min also adding in cut up pieces of zucchini, brocolli, carrot, and 2 tomatoes.  Added the feta and stuffed my pepps with this and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese and cooked for the extra five minutes.  (I did season rice mixture w/ sea salt, pepper, and paprika for some added spice) ABSOLUTELY delicious.  Great base recipe to play with.

Colorful and tasty departure from your ordinary side dish. I used red, orange, yellow and green peppers, which made this particularly pretty and bright. I coated them lightly with olive oil and sprinkled them with sea salt and freshly ground pepper before roasting them for just 20 minutes, which was perfect. I cooked the arborio rice in chicken broth and a little butter, and added fresh minced garlic to the sauteed onions and herbs.  Once mixed altogether with the chopped tomatoes, it looked like it could use a little color, so I threw in a handful of fresh, minced parsley. As for the feta, since hubs can't stand it I subbed some freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano instead (which he also doesn't like, but so be it). At this point I just put them back in the turned off oven until I got the rest of dinner plated and it worked out well. To finish, I gave them a light sprinkle of truffle sea salt. While not a masterpiece, it still was a healthy, tasty and pretty alternative to the routine vegetable/starch side dishes.

Love, love, love this recipe! I did make a few slight alterations. I cooked up fresh garlic with red onions, instead of green.  I use fresh basil, when I have it. I ended up using a brown, medium grain rice since I did not have Arborio. To add extra moisture to the rice, I used a little vegetable broth. I also used a can of diced tomatoes, drained, in replace of the fresh tomato, which I also did not have at the time. I have made this at home many times, it is one of my 8 year old daughter's favorites!

Absolutely amazing!!!  I made this for a dinner party of ten people and everybody loved it.  I did change it a little.  I used red peppers instead of green, Greek seasoning instead of Italian and added spinach to the filling.  Definitely a keeper.

These were fantastic. I cut the salt in half and rubbed olive oil on the insides and outsides of the peppers before roasting.

Delicious!  I used a short-grain white rice that was a lot less expensive than arborio; it worked fine.

These were great, and they were so much better than the usual stuffed peppers. I did a few things different. I added beef to half, I used yellow saffron rice, added garlic and used more feta. I also topped them with Mozzarella cheese. GREAT! I will be making these often!

This recipe was really good. There were a couple of things that I did differently--first I used a yellow and an orange pepper instead of green (I personally don't like the green ones). The time given was waaayyyy too long to cook it--I'd say halve the time. Also I added fresh garlic (as I'm garlic obsessed) and I had some pitted kalamata olives--they were really good in there! Yum!

This was excellent.  I did everything exactly as the recipe called for, with the exception of a little garlic.  I also reduced the tempature on the oven to 350, as 400 was too hot.  I will definently make again. Thanks

Delicious!  Being vegetarian never tasted so good!  I did as other reviewers suggested and lightly brushed with oil before roasting; only needed 20 min.  Also added mushroom, corn for color, veggie meat crumblers (will do beans next time) and a couple tablespoons of homemade tomato sauce just because it became too dry with all the extras I added.  I think regular onion would work if you didn't have green and a lot of different cheeses could be used too. I doubled the recipe but will halve the salt next time.  I also think any pepper would work, not just green.  Great versatile recipe - thanks!!

This was so good! I substituted brown rice and regular onions for the risotto and green onion, based on what I had. Next time I'll omit the salt. Anyway, yum! thanks :)

This was good, but not great. I added some turkey mince, which I really think it needed. I think I used a bit too much rice and not enough tomatoes. I will use an extra tomato next time since it turned out a little dry and I like mine a little more "saucy"

I've come back to edit this with more essential changes: one small can diced tomatoes, two fresh tomatoes, handful of mozzarella, frozen corn. Also the pepper only need about 20 min roasting time and stand them upright... I had mine upside down and they wilted and it was a pain to fill them. This is GOOD and the way I make it can stuff over half a dozen peppers!

THIS WAS SO YUMMY!!!! I just used a rice pilaf, added the following ingredients:  2 cloves of garlic, chopped red and orange peppers, olives, fresh spinach, basil and mushrooms, a splash of vegetable broth & red pepper flakes for an lil' kick. I took others suggestion and lightly coated the outside of the peppers with olive oil before roasting. Turned out perfectly, my 11 year old daughter LOVED it! This is a fun and easy recipe that allows you to add ingredients to your liking/taste. THANK YOU! We will definitely be adding this to our regular dinner menu!!!!

I love stuffed peppers, but don't make them often because my kids won't eat them.  However, once a year I make these with whatever peppers I've been able to coax out of my garden, and this recipe is a good one.  The only problem is that the filling needs a sauce and (according to my carnivore of a husband) meat.  So, I've ended up morphing this recipe to fit our tastes but thought I'd share it here in case others want to try it.  I've found that using leftover meatballs and sauce from the previous night's spaghetti and meatball dinner makes these peppers a snap.  I cut up the meatballs and stir in just enough sauce to hold it all together.  Or, you could brown some ground beef, stir in jarred marinara sauce, and further spice it up with seasonings, onions, or whatever.  Stir in the cooked rice, fill the roasted peppers, and top with cheese.  I use mozzarella because my husband isn't a fan of feta.  I know those are big changes, but I much prefer the roasting method to cooking the peppers in sauce or tomato soup.  What's great about this recipe is that I was easily able to make it "my way," and THAT is why it gets five stars!

This is absolutely one of my favorite meals. I usually use red or yellow peppers since I don't like green. I also include about a half of a can of black beans to increase the protein. They are amazing! I've made them for several friends and my boyfriend, and everyone has loved them. I highly recommend!

Great recipe!!  Followed almost exactly except I coated the peppers with olive oil like others suggested and added about 5T of tomato sauce as I thought the mixture was too dry.  Excellent!

Very good and simple. We added some shredded cheese on top. We also made it with quinoa instead of rice. Next time I will add a bit more spice and maybe other veggies. Still, this was a very yummy one.

These were the best stuffed peppers I have ever had!  The addition of the feta cheese is amazing!!  I did add ground beef to the mixture by browning it first, draining and then adding all of the other ingredients as instructed. I will try the vegetarian option as well as I'm sure it will be just as yummy!

I have made these twice using red peppers, and found it very delicious! I used cooked brown rice the second time and added some chopped olives (any kind). Used a better quality feta cheese the second time and it made a big difference in the taste and texture. You can add anything else you like to this dish (bits of chopped broccoli, small dices of meat/chicken/seafood, etc. and it will always be delicious.  Makes a nice lunch all by themselves!

This was excellent and easy. Roasting the peppers first gave them wonderful flavor. I substituted basmati rice.

I love the variation of Color!  The yellow, red, and orange peppers are actually better for you too!  Another thing I added was V-8 juice....adds lots of flavor AND the best part is, that my family is getting lots of extra veggies in their diet without any fuss!

Absoltely amazing! I recommend anyone to make this dish if they a food fetish for bell peppers! The best part is that if you want to take it up notch you can use red or yellow bell pepper to get a different flavor and to have more options.

I thought this was outstanding(!), and not bland at all as others noted.  I spritzed my peppers with olive oil before roasting, as someone else suggested, and roasted only 15 minutes (would have been extremely mushy otherwise!).  I used only 1/2 tsp. salt (1 tsp. sounded like a lot!), and was SO glad I cut down the amount.  I used 1/8 tsp. pepper.  I didn't need to put them back in the oven because simply stirring it all together melted the cheese.  Note that you could use regular rice instead of Arborio - there wasn't much difference.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Yummy! I can't eat tomato so used spinach and feta instead. Only problem I had was, my peppers roasted down into little flat, saggy things even though I took them out sooner than called for. I sort of piled the rice on top anyway, and they taste great, but next time I'll definitely roast them for a much shorter time. Planning on stuffing them with rice and beans next!

This is a very tasty way to dress up bell peppers. I did not have any arborio rice so I used short grain rice. I used minced red onions instead of green onions, fresh garlic, fresh basil and italian seasonings. I used hawaiian sea salt and black pepper to season the 3 green bell peppers, then lightly drizzled a little olive oil over it before roasting them for 25 mins. They were roasted perfectly. I sauteed the red onion, garlic in olive oil and added some fresh basil. I added the cooked rice, broke it up in the pan, added a little more sea salt and black pepper, and then one roma tomato, diced up. I opted to use parmesan reggiano instead of feta (personal perference). I mixed the rice with the cheese, then stuffed the bell peppers, added more cheese on top and put them back into the oven for 5 minutes. I turned off the oven and let it sit a while. Right before serving I sprinkled some fresh minced italian flat leaf parsley for added color. The bell peppers were roasted perfectly. They are easy to pick up with a fork and soft. I love the stuffing mixture mixed with the parmesan cheese. It gave a nice flavor to the rice and bell peppers. There was nothing overpowering in the flavors and we all loved this! A definite repeat again. It served as a great side dish along with the meatloaf I made tonight!

This is delicious! I had a taste of the rice (I made this for lunch tomorrow) and it was heavenly.

I made two substitutions since that was what I had at hand, I used brown rice and cottage cheese. Followed the recipe with everything else, this will be added to my lunch rooster!

Made it with red peppers and quinoa instead of rice.  Added a little tomato sauce.  Used a little ramp (like leek) with the spring onion.  Really good!

Ohh so good!  I added 2 cloves of garlic with the green onions when I sauted them.  I used short-grain rice.  I will be making these often.
Update: I have been making these often.  I've also tried adding a half a can of crab to the rice in the pan, and it tastes good.  I will try adding mushrooms to the green onions in the pan next time.

This was delicious made according to the recipe.  I think another time, rather than add meat as some have suggested, I might add nuts -- pignoli or chopped walnuts -- to give it a bit more character.

One of my favorite recipes! I prefer using orange or yellow peppers. Also to add variety I will sometimes add ground beef or use short grain brown rice instead.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  We will definitely make these again and will enjoy trying variations.  I definitely preferred this version of roasting the peppers rather than my other recipe of parboiling them.  I added chorizo for some meat, and will likely add spinach next time.

Delicious!! I start with 1 clove of chopped garlic in the olive oil and cook about 30 seconds then add the onion. I also chop up the tops of the peppers that I removed (of course removing the stems first) and add them in with the onion. I use fresh basil just because I love it. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a can of Delmonte diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano draining off the liquid. I also lightly spray the outside of the peppers (I use orange peppers because I don't care for green peppers) with olive oil from my Misto just before the roasting step and finally, I add a bit of chopped fresh parsley to the tops of the stuffed peppers just before their final baking. A very easy quick dinner or side dish (depending on your appetitie) Thanks Sandy!

Delicious, delicious, delicious! My first attempt at stuffed peppers (trying to use up extra red peppers I had, so I used them instead of green), and after about 2 mouthfuls I had decided that this is one of my favourite dishes ever!  I would say that the peppers only need about 15 minutes to roast initially - after 20 minutes mine had lost their shape and were difficult to stuff, as some other reviewers have mentioned. When I made them a second time, only roasting for 15 minutes, they came out much better. I also used normal onion, as I hadn't realised that "green onion" was another name for "spring onion"!!! It worked just fine. I also made some to take into work for lunch the next day (yes, they were that good!) and I reheated them in the microwave and they came out just fine.  I had my stuffed pepper with some mashed potato which I thought made it into a really good, filling, tasty meal.  Oh - and I used fresh basil - definitely use this if you have it, but I add it a bit later than suggested in the recipe, so the fresh taste is not lost by cooking it too long.

I was looking for a good stuffed pepper recipe to try and came across this one; and let me say I am so glad I did.  This recipe is great!  I have made this on so many occasions that I no longer even need the recipe.  I try and keep most of the ingredients on hand so if I need to make a quick dinner I can.  The only change I've made is to add some garlic in when cooking up the green onions and spices.  All of my family and friends ask me to make this for them all the time.  The presentation of this can be beautiful.  I have served the peppers on top of garlic mashed potatoes and garnished with asparagus spears in a circle around the edge of the plate.  This recipe is De-LISH!!!

This recipe is EXCELLENT...I used brown rice & didn't cut the peppers in half, but just the tops off , inverted them & roasted them for only 20 mins as I don't like peppers overcooked.I also sprinkled a pinch of parmesan on top before putting them back in the oven. I used red,green,yellow & orange peppers for a dinner party last Sat night & it looked oh so festive......received many compliments & have made them a regular on my menu....Bon Apetit!
P.S. My meat-loving husband prefers these with lean ground beef,fried separately & folded in before baking.

This was surprisingly tasty. Unlike a lot of recipes where you have to adjust the seasoning, this one seemed to get it right. I pretty much followed the recipe, with a few minor changes: used brown rice instead of Arborio and cooked in vegetable broth. With the peppers, I flipped them over about half way through cooking--otherwise, I think they would have gotten too dark. I didn't measure the feta cheese, just threw it in and probably used more than a half cup. I think I perhaps cut back on the salt. Would make again.

Loved these and they have been a huge hit with my family as well!  Made these for my mom and sister-they loved!  Husband and kids loved them as well!  I also added meat.  Half and half mixture of italian sausage and hamburger and mixed in at the end with other ingredients before stuffing.  YUM!!!

I am 33 and never had stuffed pepper before. I decided to try this recipe because it looked easy enough and I was looking for something meatless. They were excellent! Even my picky kids tried them. Also I found them very filling - a nice side salad is really all you need to round out the meal. This will be my go-to stuffed pepper recipe.

I fixed this for the first time this evening. I followed the recipe as written with one exception. I forgot to add the feta to the rice mixture before stuffing the peppers so I just crumbled the cheese on top before putting it back in the oven for 5 min.  This was a fast and DELICIOUS dish. My family gave this a thumbs up.

These turned out great...nice healthy and colourful side dish!  I used basmati instead of arborio, cooked in veggie stock.  Was out of green onions, so sauteed some yellow onion and also threw in some mushrooms that needed using up.  Stuffed both a yellow and orange pepper as they were the only ones in my fridge.  Threw in some fresh parsley at the very end for more colour...yummy!

Really good, and really easy!  I forgot to buy feta and fresh tomato, so had to use parm and a bit of canned, but it still all worked out.  Loved the roasted peppers.  My one quibble is that there's not much protein; next time I'll either add white beans, double the recipe or both.  Thanks so much!

I loved this! The best thing (other than the taste) is the adaptability of this recipe.   I used chicken broth instead of water.  I used instant brown rice, regular onion instead of green onion and I added a piece of swiss cheese to top.  I used these ingredients because I had them on hand.  Thank you, Sandy.

Best recipe so far. I substituted 1/2 onion instead of the green onions (college budgeting/availability), one small can (14 oz.?) of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, and added 1 teaspoon of red pepper (sounds like a lot, but even those who don't like much heat liked the change). Also, I use a bit more rice and a bit less water since the stuffing can bit a tad liquidy, especially if doubling the recipe.

A yummy recipe and a great find. I substituted canned diced tomatoes since fresh tomatoes were out of season. The result was a bit too salty since the canned tomatoes had salt in them. I expect it would have been just right if I omitted the added salt specified in the recipe.

Fantastic! I did not substitute ingredients. I can see myself using the filling for other Italian/Greek dishes too! I've recently gone vegetarian, and I know I will make this again and again instead of meat.

This is now my favorite stuffed pepper recipe.  I make 2 changes - I use red and yellow peppers, and I substitute the rice with quinoa - you get your protein, and it goes from being a side dish to the main course.

Good basic meatless stuffed peppers (especially for a Friday during Lent). I left out the feta (forgot about it) but didn't miss it during dinner. I also used red, orange, green, and yellow bell peppers. The colors were very nice for presentation. (Leftovers were good as well.)

Oh my goodness!!! This was a fantastic spin on stuffed peppers. My Boyfriend was slightly skeptical because he loves his peppers with meat. He (and his mother & friends who stopped by), absolutely loved this meal.  The only thing I added was a dollop of tomato paste. I even use the Arborio filling as a side to meals!!! Thank You!!

My family likes this dish a lot.  I made it twice, the first time as stated and the second with some seasoned ground beef.  A definite do over.  The peppers cook up perfectly and are so tasty.

This was pretty good. I added some minced garlic to it. The Italian seasoning was way way too salty, though. Any suggestions for next time? I definitely want to try this again.

I really like this recipe! It is delicious and nutritious.  However, I alter the original recipe slightly. I never use feta cheese. I use regular white onions instead of green onions and I use white rice instead of Arborio rice.

Definitely need more flavor.  Add some mushrooms, garlic and maybe even some cayenne pepper.  Otherwise it's a little blah.  Cooking time for the peppers is WAY overstated.  Only need about 20 minutes at the most.

This was really delicious and flavorful.  Only change I made was to use brown rice which I had as leftovers.  I personally like the brown rice better since its more substancial than rice and makes this dish go from side to main.  It also took relatively short to put together.

Very easy vegetarian meal.  We doubled it and used leftover rice, red bell peppers, and added garlic with the onions, omitted salt with seasoning (rice was salted).  Feta added a delicous warmth.  Boyfriend added crispy bacon to 1/2 of the mix.  Highly recommend if you live with a meat-eater as is easy to adapt.

My husband and I gave up meat for lent, at first it was hard to cook strictly vegetarian, but recipes like this one are changing my mind everyday.  This was awesome.  Very flavorful.  I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I added parsley and garlic powder, i also threw in the stuffing a few sun dried tomatoes and a roasted red pepper chopped.  I brought them to lunch at work with mixed veggies, and before i finished a few of my colleagues were begging for this recipe! Good job, Sandy!

I don't really like peppers as a general rule, but I made this recipe for my husband to use up a wealth of peppers from the garden.  The feta cheese caught my eye and it was a welcome addition.  He really enjoyed this recipe and I'll definitely make it again.  I just ate the filling and it was delicious.

I did completely different stuffing, but I did cut/roast them like this. The roasting was perfect, especially since I'm not a fan of peppers due to their bitterness (the roasting took that away completely).  Excellent - I'll do them this way everytime, no matter what's inside!

These were very good, but 400 degrees for the peppers was too hot for my particular oven.  I only kept them in there for about 17 minutes and they tops were burnt, so I'll try 350 next time.  Delicious combination!  I also used fresh basil, like several other reviewers, and added chicken.  I used mozz. cheese instead of feta.  Great recipe!

YUMMY! This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers and it was surprisingly easy and delicious.  I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I threw in some oregano, garlic and extra basil. After I added the rice to the tomato mixture it seemed sticky so I added some milk to make it creamier.  Also, I used one green pepper and one red pepper - hands down the red pepper was better.  Great recipe, can't wait to make again!

This was my first attempt at stuffed peppers and I couldn't be more pleased with them.  Not only were they super easy to prepare but they were absolutely delicious!  I substituted brown rice, parmesan cheese and diced canned tomatoes only because thats what I had on hand.  This is one of those recipes that you can really improvise with whatever is in your pantry or fridge.

15 minutes is plenty to bake the peppers before filling. I also added black olives and used diced canned tomato instead of fresh. Fabulous! And beautiful with red peppers, looks very nice for company.

This turned out good but I think next time I will add some tomato sauce for the top of it and change the feata cheese to mozzarella because the feata is so salty..It was very easy and followed it exactly so was quite pleased with it.

One of my favorite AR recipes.  I grew up on the tomato/cheddar cheese and hamburger stuffed peppers, and finding this recipe was a welcomed change.  I can't praise this one enough - thank you for allowing us to share in your recipe!

Wow!  These were fabulous!  I wasn't quite sure what to expect and ended up loving them.  I used red peppers (leave the stem on to help keep their shape) and had to do half of them without the feta because of my husband's dietary restrictions and he thought they were good as well.  But the feta ... oh-h-h-h... it's wonderful.

Red Peppers are a must.  This dish could easily be a meal as the Arborio rice is so thick.  But the flavor is delicious.

I added some prepared hot salsa to the filling to give it more moisture and flavour. It was very good.

This recipe is very good & easy to make. I've been meaning to try this for awhile it did not disappoint. I followed the recipe except I used yellow onions instead of green onions because we don't like green onions.  I used sharp white cheddar cheese we don't like feta. It came out excellent. My daughter is a vegetarian and I'm always looking for different recipes. She loved it. For all of you vegetarians out there try this you will be happy you did.

I LOVE this recipe! This is the perfect, basic, vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe. Alterations and options are endless. As is the recipe is amazing. I love that it is easily altered. Because of this recipe I make stuffed peppers at least twice a month (now I wrap them in tin foil and put them on the grill because it's warmer out). I love green peppers, but the red and orange are more nutritious so I like to switch up what color peppers I am using. Sometimes I grab one of each color. The filling is easily to switch up. You can add spinach, corn, black beans, really whatever you have on hand. Also, I love the name! It makes me think of Frank Sinatra :)

I started making this dish back in 2008. It was a keeper for me and I make it pretty regularly for my household. I thought I had rated it but I guess did not. I love this dish. It's one of my favorites. 

My only modifications are I add some mozzarella to it and sometimes chopped mushrooms. The mozzarella happened randomly when I forgot to buy Feta one time around. Then the time after I added both and it tasted even better. So I usually either add some to the rice with the feta or I toss some on top (for my husband I add an extra layer halfway through stuffing).

This recipe is good enough to make me turn vegetarian! Great way to use up extra peppers. I've made them for parties a couple of times and they're always a hit. I've tried adding additional ingredients on different occasions to jazz them up and try something new: chickpeas, black beans, spinach, minced garlic, corn, and water chestnuts make great additions (separately). I also tend to use whatever rice I have in the pantry (usually brown rice) to avoid making a special trip for arborio rice and it turns out just as tasty. I also cut down on the salt - it's so flavorful on its own, you don't need it.

Great simple recipe, and great for last-minute dinner parties. It's also a great recipe to experiment with. I tried adding difference veggies, like yellow bell peppers or mushrooms to the stuffing and it was delicious!

Fantastic recipe! This one is part of our regular rotation and strikes a great balance between being substantial without being heavy. We eat this as a main dish, and I'm always filled up without feeling weighed down. The only thing that I changed was substituting a mix of parsley, oregano, and basil for the Italian seasoning and using different colored peppers--both minor changes. The peppers I used were a bit smaller, and I found that 25 to 30 minutes in the oven made them overcooked and mushy. 15 to 20 minutes was adequate.

The rice mixture was really good.  I roasted the peppers too long and they became very soft so I just diced them up and added it to the rice mixture.  Still pretty good.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some of my green peppers from my garden.  I decided to give this recipe a try and I am so glad.  I did not have Feta cheese to I used Italian 6 cheese blend.  I also added some ground beef.  I did follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  This was a perfect recipe.  I will be making this again.

SUPER yum! These were absolutely delish!!! Both my hubs and I didn't miss the meat one bit. :) The fact that these are healthy AND a snap to prepare makes your recipe a winner in my book! My only gripe is that my rice did not cook thru in the suggested 20 minute time frame. My hubs and I agree that prepared risotto would be a good substitute (we like Alessi brand alfredo risotto). I will definitely go that route next time. Other than this minor change (and sauteing a good dose of minced garlic along with my onion), I see no need for improvement. NOTE: Be sure to s&p your bell pepper halves VERY well prior to roasting them. This adds a TREMENDOUS amount of flavor. Pop 'em in the oven and 20 minutes later, you'll end up with perfectly seasoned, beautifully roasted peppers. Topping each pepper half with marinara sauce REALLY hit the spot while keeping everything moist (my hubs commented that our peppers would have been dry otherwise). Garlic mashed potatoes and cheesy garlic bread rounded out our meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Sandy. These were fantastic! :-)

Never thought to roast the peppers in stuffed peppers!  Excellent idea, and needless to say...  the flavor is fantastic.  Roasting just about any vegetable gives you a great result and increased flavor.  I used yellow and orange bell peppers since that's what I had, and it only took 20 minutes for them to soften and brown - and frankly, it was a bit too much.  Next time, I would just fill/stuff the peppers and roast them all at once for 20 minutes.  I had to slightly substitute some of the ingredients  due to what I had on hand, but other than that...  this recipe is a winner!  I'm sure you can play around with different fillings and still get a delicious meal.
For reference, my substitutions were: I used brown rice, half a regular onion/chopped, half can of tomato sauce, and left out the cheese.  For seasoning, I used black pepper, garlic powder, and a dash of curry powder.  Thanks for sharing!

My two problems when I made this were:
1. I didn't have nearly enough rice/onion/tomato filling for four halves of pepper. 
2. It tastes like generic Italian. The feta and basil take over and it's just kind of boring. 

*The peppers for me came out a little brown looking from the roasting. Next time I make stuffed peppers I'm brushing the bottoms of the halves with olive oil.

No one in my family enjoyed these. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they were a great presentation, and added color to the plate. I will continue to look for a good stuffed pepper.

Although I have not eaten this myself I made it for my husband for dinner when I wouldnt be home.  He raved about it.  He actually sent me two text messages saying that it was the best dinner he had ever had.  And we have been together for 20 years so it must be good.

Delicious basic recipe to adapt to your taste. I also added garlic, extra feta,  fresh spinach, asparagus tips, and extra diced tomatoes (canned)-I will definitely make these again-my hubby(who is very picky) thought these peppers were delicious!

These are really good. I used 3 big red peppers and I added a little garlic to the rice mixture. I did cut peppers in half but it would be better just to cut the tops off so the mixture stays in better. I love the feta cheese!

Doubled the recipe.  Cooked arborio rice the traditional way with sauteed onion and chicken broth.  Only change I made and it was fabulous!  Going in the rotation for sure!

I have made these for years the "traditional" way--ground beef, tomato sauce, rice and cheese... and I am so bored of it that way!
This was EXCELLENT.  Arborio rice is a must.  It is so fluffy and pasta-like.  I made this exact and rate it as so.  I will make again, and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe! I've done it with both bell peppers and hot peppers. I am a vegetarian and I have shocked people who aren't...they can't believe food is actually better without meat!

Even great as leftovers - I just added a bit of chicken stock to the rice before reheating!

It's a great recipe.  I would recommend roasting the peppers for approximately 15 to 20 minutes instead of 25 to 30 minutes.

I'm giving this recipe a Wow. Not only because they were delicious but because they are so good for you!
Forgive me but I changed it up just a bit...omit the salt its completely unnecessary. 
I poured my 1 tbsp of Olive Oil into a cup and brushed my peppers with them before putting in the oven, thank you to another reviewer for that. I still had oil left for the fry-pan for the vegetables. 
Also used brown rice which takes 40 minutes to cook so I suggest you put it on first. :)
Fresh Basil naturally. (you have no idea what an improvement it is if you haven't tried it)
I used more garlic than was called for, added spinach and of course one fresh tomato as the recipe did call for. 
I try to keep 'canned' or 'packaged' food out of a great healthy dish like this. (Note: V8 while full of vegetables is also full of preservatives)
Thank you for this great recipe, it works as a main course (for me) or as a side dish with a crowd.

Since I cannot eat cheese, I nixed this and used egg to have everything stick together. I also used short grain rice and added extra veggies to the mixture. The flavor was amazing and the idea of roasting the peppers was very smart! I would have cooked my rice just a bit longer as it was chewy but the over all flavor was awesome! Instead of feta, one could try parmesan cheese as well...or throw in some lentils or beans for protein. Thanks :)

Great recipe! I used brown rice instead of Arborio rice. I am also not the biggest fan of feta, so I may try it with a different cheese next time, but this is a great recipe, so easy and versatile! I cooked the rice, roasted the peppers and cut up the remaining ingredients at the same time so all in all it only took about 30 minutes.

very good - this is a nice way to change up the vegetable/grains on your menu. We served this is grilled cajun chicken. I made some changes based on what I had on hand and my tastes. I cooked brown rice in chicken broth and threw diced yellow onion in to simmer with it along with the herbs and seasoning. I added a touch of cayenne and paprika too. Very tasty.

DELICIOUS!    I was improvising a pepper recipe, and modified this one.  I did used ground beef and rice, mixed with the veggies recommended.  In place of Italian seasoning and tomatoes, I used 14-oz of fresh pico de gallo salsa, drained through cheesecloth to reduce liquid.  This made a spicy, Mexican-tasting mix.

AMAZING!!  Hubby and I LOVED this recipe!  I made some adjustments based on what I had in the house, I pre-cooked brown rice, then just mixed in the skillet with the other ingredients at the end.  Added garlic, and I didn't have feta, so I used mozzarella and a dollop of nonfat plain yogurt (to get the creamy texture).  LOVED IT - I'd give this 10 stars if I could!

Very nice and light for a change. Great meal! At first I thought I was adding too much seasoning, but I was wrong and added fresh garlic along as others said fresh basil...wow what a difference. Also used mozzerella and topped off with freshly grated parm. My husband wanted meat with it so maybe next time I will add chicken or ground beef. But for me delish!!

These were not very flavorful. I used baby bell peppers instead and cooked them for 15-20 minutes at 350.  They are great for vegetarians, however, it needed something extra.

Good but very salty also I added 2 cloves of garlic. Labor intense but very worth it. Everyone loved it. I tripled the recipe but only used the original amount of salt.

This recipe was pretty good, we will be making it again for sure. I halved the peppers length wise, but i think i might just cut the tops off of them next time as the peppers weren't very deep to stuff.

I just made these today.  My husband loved them.  I left out the rice and added ground beef instead to make it low carb.  I also used fresh basil and oregano for the spices.  I did not roast the peppers as long as it said, because they were getting black on the edges.  I have a new stove and it cooks really fast.

This was a great tasting healthy meal with few ingredients, yet packed with flavor!  I did not have Italian seasoning so I used an Italian salad dressing mix and it came out tasting great.  Other modifications, I used chicken stock instead of water, red instead of green onions and regular rice instead of arborio.

This recipe is awesome! The only changes I made were to add about a tbsp of white wine after sauteing the onions, half a zucchini diced at the same time as the tomato. I use stainless steel cookware, so none of the onions or veggies can be cooked at med/high either, WAY too hot. I also heated the oven to about 350 to roast the peppers because I had chicken going at the same time, and they were still well cooked by the time I stuffed them. AMAZING, but I surely wouldn't make them without adding the zucchini!

Edit: I made this recipe originally with jasmine rice, I made it again last night with the recommended Arborio and we all MUCH preferred jasmine.

I love this site! These were both twice as delicious and twice as healthy as other stuffed peppers I've made. I sauteed garlic, fresh basil, spinach, green onion, sea salt, pepper, and italian spices. I added ground turkey, tomato, and used Parmesan cheese instead of feta. The flavors were incredible! Definitely use fresh basil if you can, and the arborio rice (i had leftover) is really hearty and filling (if you can, i would definitely recommend it over regular long grain rice). My only problem was the peppers lost their shape while roasting which made stuffing difficult... but i read a comment about using a muffin pan which is a great tip! My whole family loved this recipe, and you could really add any vegetable, meat, cheese you have on had. Highly recommend!

Thanks Sandy! My one daughter is a vegetarian and it hs hard to find recipes that satisfy her AND the rest of the family.  This hit the mark! I followed the cooking times exactly and loved the roasted peppers.  I doubled the recipe and used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes because that was all I had.  After cooking the tomatoes with the onions & spices, I removed about half to serve on the side before I mixed the rice in.  Worked perfectly.  This is a keeper and an easy recipe that everyone should try. It's so easy to adapt...just look at the photos and you can see.  None of them even look similar!

I didn't have any of the seasonings or tomatoes (I could have got the latter, but tomatoes are out of season right now so I doubt they would have tasted like tomatoes), but it was still delicious. I used orange/yellow peppers and I think these would work much better than the green peppers because of the former's sweetness and the latter's bitterness. I also used chives because I didn't have green onions. Arborio rice + feta = perfect combo of fluffiness and cheesiness. Goat's feta is best.

Great vegetarian recipe.  I've sauteed crumbled extra firm tofu with the vegetables and seasonings to up the protein value and it was still wonderful.

The two components of this dish never really blended for me.  It was more like a rice dish on top of a great tasting bowl.  The arborio rice also seemed a little wierd to me as well, I would go with something like jasmine, basmati, or just a plain long grain white rice.

I saw this on the feature page yesterday and had to make these.  They were awesome and I've never been a big fan of stuffed peppers.  

I took some of the reviews into consideration and did the following: I used red peppers and only roasted them for about 15 minutes as I prefer them tender, but not mushy.  I wanted them to hold up and they were perfect.  I also browned some very lean ground beef with the onions and then added the rice and some greek seasonings.  Then I added some petite diced canned tomatoes, as it's not really the season for fresh and they were great in it.  I topped with Feta cheese instead of adding it to the mix, but only because I didn't read it right.

Minimal changes though - I'm sure it's GReAT as is.  :)

My husband and I are both vegetarians and we LOVE this recipe.  We add kidney beans to the filling for some added texture and protein.  The filling alone would be a great side item to any dish!

This is a great recipe.  I my self used red, orange, yellow, and green peppers.  Added color and people were able to choose what they liked.  I agree that the roasting time is too long.  ISome changes I made... used garlic & herb feta to add more flavor and top off with french fried onions.  Excellent and quick dish.  Next time will add chicken or ground beef.

I loved this recipe, it was so good.  I will not roast the peppers as long next time b/c they were a little mushy, but had a great taste.  I substituted brown rice for the other rice and used plum tomatoes.  So yummy.  My husband thougtht they were a little salty b/c of the feta, I will omit the salt next time.

Great recipe! I love these  stuffed peppers, but there is no need to roast the peppers first. By skipping this step the peppers do not turn to mush!

I loved these!  Great flavor, something a little unique.  I followed recipe exactly except sprinkled some romano/parm cheese on top and broiled for a few minutes at the end.  I will probably cut back on pepper roasting time in the future, as they were plenty done by 25 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great, my husband loved it.  I changed it a little bit by using red peppers.  Instead of using a fresh tomato I used a 14 oz. can of petite cut, diced tomatoes (drained). I also added chopped fresh garlic when I sauted the onion and seasonings.  After I put the mixture in the peppers I sprinkled with fresh chopped cilantro.  The addition of the tomatoes made more rice mixture so we had 4 stuffed peppers.

This recipe was wonderful!  We used red peppers instead of green and substitued mozzarella and parmesan for the feta (can't eat feta since I'm pregnant).  It was delicious and more filling than expected.  Am anxious to try with the feta once the little one comes!

My family loved these! I added a little more feta because I am a cheese lover and it was wonderful! I grilled the peppers in foil rather than in the oven. They had a great smokey flavor I highly recommend grilling them.

Added pork sausage and used Parmesan instead of feta but about half what it called for. Best peppers I've ever had! Thank you. I would like to put mozzarella on them next time. This was perfect for my low fodmap diet:)

Love this recipe. I'm vegetarian and I'm always looking for recipes that my non-veg husband could enjoy. This recipe definitely fits the bill. A few modifications: I used sprouted brown rice and added a bit of vegetable bullion for flavor. I added red bell pepper and sauteed it together with the green onion. I also added 1 cup of canned, diced tomatoes (w/juice)instead of the fresh tomato. Delish!

The rice filling was so, so yummy!  I could eat it by the bucket loads.  The flavors married well with the roasted pepper, and the suggested cooking method got the pepper to that perfect roasted, still slightly crisp texture that I love.  If you like a softer pepper, you may want to adjust the roasting.  For those that like a bit of texture, this is perfect!

I really like the way these turned out. As per the other reviews, I added garlic to my filling. I also added some lentils to my rice (I usually throw some dried lentils in with any rice, bumping up to a complete vegetarian protein) which made this was a fantastic meal and side dish to eat over a couple of days. For a vegan version I skipped on the feta and instead added nutritional yeast flakes and a bit of salt to give it a cheesy flavour. I couldn't stop eating the filling from the pan! Usually I find stuffed peppers to have really flavourful filling but the pepper itself always seems under-seasoned; I think the salty feta must take care of that problem. Although even the vegan version I made was probably one of my favourite stuffed peppers ever -- good with or without cheese! Not usually a big fan but these totally won me over. I even bought some big bell peppers so I could make this again this week! I imagine you could definitely use any type of rice in this. I may try a brown or wild rice mix next time. Great thing to add to rotation. Thanks!

This was a huge hit with even my pickiest eater.  I did use what I had on hand, so I made it with brown rice. Instead of green peppers, I had red, orange and yellow peppers.  I had Spanish onion instead of green.  I also added a little parmesan cheese and topped with mozzarella.  Oh, yeah, I had leftover filling from a chicken dish which was spinach, feta and a few seasonings which I mixed in.  Okay, I guess I totally overhauled the recipe, but it worked and my suggestion is that this is a wonderful base recipe that you can twist and turn to suit whatever you have in the house and what your taste prefers.  The cheese on top allowed my picky 7 year old to ask me to make it again.

I found this recipe great with a few adjustments. I cooked the onion and 2 cloves of garlic first, added the rice and toasted until transparent then added warmed vegetable stock and rice to a rice cooker. I used fresh basil rather then the seasoning and dried basil and added pitted olives. I combined everything in a bowl at the end rather than doing the cooking step with the spices and tomato. Doing it this way meant the filling was full of flavour and creamy like risotto. The peppers were roasted too long, I only needed 20 minutes.

I wouldn't pick this for a main dish, but delicious as a side for us carnivors. Used canned diced tomatoes with roasted garlic instead of fresh-about 3/4 can. Topped with shredded cheddar cheese before baking. Excellent!!!

This is a great stuffed pepper recipe roasting the peppers ahead of time makes them amazing, only 4 stars cuz I like a little tomatoe flavor in my peppers so we add some tomatoes or a can of paste or sauce to give it the richness and added some parmesann on top and it was perfect. With these additions it was a definite 5 stars!

This is a great recipe.  I followed the recipe but added garlic.  I chopped the tops of the bell peppers and cooked with the onions, added garlic and instead of the tomato, I added a 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Like others before me I added baby spinach (which I also heated with the onion mixture.  Really enjoyed this basic recipe.  You can do so much with it. I actually think it gets better the next day.  YUMMY and a keeper

I would give this a dozen stars if possible!! Very versatile recipe, really. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and changed some things up. First off, I had small peppers, so after brushing some olive oil and salt on, I baked the peppers for only 15 minutes. As for the stuffing, I added some tomato sauce, cream and half a beef cube instead of salt. Also added some diced up chicken and some chili flakes. Used store brand grated cheese. Sooooo good. Oh, and red peppers taste better than green for this recipe. Will make again and again.

This is an excellent base recipe to tinker with. I have made this twice, adding a few different ingredients each time, and both versions have been wonderful yesterday I doubled the recipe, added 1 lb of ground chuck, garlic, a Serrano pepper, and a yellow summer squash. I stuffed it into a mix of red and orange bell peppers from our garden. Yum!

Peppers were cheap this week so I tried it. I loved the idea of slicing them in half....it was so much easier! We are feta lovers so that was also a plus here. Great flavor and my house smells great!

These tasted ok, but it just isnt a stuffed pepper.  Very Italian flavor.  Needs more tomato flavor and some beef.  Just not our style.

I found this recipe to be pretty bland, even after having added some heat. My husband loved it after he added some peppers to it.  I do think the basis of the recipe is good, and I plan to try it again using taco seasoning for the filling and the bell peppers.

Based on some other reviews and my own intuition, I thought these might be a bit bland.  I used quinoa cooked in veg broth and also sauted some spinach and zucchini with the onion mixture.  The peppers were a little soft; won't cook as long next time.  Served with corn on the cob and was a fabulous meatless meal!

I just made this, I changed it a little bit.  I did like other reviewers said I roasted the peppers at 350 for about 25 min. I added a can of rotel instead of tomato, I drained a little of the juice, it was perfect with the added vegetables I added to the onion. I put fresh mushrooms and spinach in it too, it came out great will make again.

A great recipe with a few additions.  Fresh garlic, frozen corn and Morningstar meatless crumbles into the mixture.  Shredded Mozzarella cheese on top before it goes back into the oven.  So good!

I really like this recipe.  This is the 3rd time I've made these.  Only difference is I've added 1/2 lb italian sausage for a nice little kick.  They are delicious.  The smell of sweet roasted bell peppers lingers in the house so the next morning I can say "YUMMMMM!" all over again!  I don't use green peppers because of the higher acid (I just can't cultivate a liking for them) but I use red, orange and yellow bell peppers and they seem to work out just FINE.

Made these tonight with only a few changes... since we didn't have but only half a tomato and the rice was slightly dry, I added a can of condensed tomato soup.   Also added garlic as others suggested to the green onion and tomato mix, then added meatless veggies crumbles for protein.  They were so good... even our picky 10 year old who will not eat peppers said they were "awesome"!!  Thanks!!

DELICIOUS stuffed pepper recipe.  I was worried it would be dry because of the rice, or bland because it didn't have meat but it was outstanding.  And, again, very versatile.. add in whatever you like to the stuffing mix- I added chopped zuchinni, mushrooms, white onion in addition to the green onion, and used quinoa in place of rice.  This is my new go-to stuffed pepper recipe for forever.

If I could give this more stars, I would! This was yummy. Had no spare pepper, so only used the bits I cut off to make them stand in the rice mix. Only roasted for 15 min, filled and put back in oven for another 8 mins. Perfect, peppers not too soft, but not nearly raw either. Will deff make again!

This was really yummy and flavorful.  Per the recommendation of others, I added garlic and cayenne pepper.  I also added a sprinkle of fennel seeds to the skillet.

I cant really review this based on the recipe but I am going to anyway.
I did not add any rice, I thought that idea was weird, instead I took my yellow bell pepper cut it into 3 and stuffed it with a mixture of sauteed mushrooms, purple onion, spinach, garlic, cayenne, basil, italian seasoning, olive oil, and tomatoes. After stuffing the peppers I topped it off with feta cheese and put it in the oven until the cheese was toasted. This was a fairly pleasant entree... I just wish I had some shrimp to add in it.

Great! Easy to make and easy on a college student's budget (if you substitute the cheese, that is).

First time making stuffed peppers.  They were great!  I used different rice (should have stuck with the directions).  I think I'll make them again, but with the rice they called for or couscous.  The onion, tomato base was excellent.  I will use that in other recipes.

Very good. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe, subbed a 15 oz can of tomato sauce for the tomato, added a pinch of garlic powder, and sprinkled mozzarella on top instead of using the feta. The subs worked well for me but I'm sure the original recipe is great too.

Really good. I made half a batch without meat for my vegetarian parents and for the second batch i used some ground turkey meat. Both variations were amazing and everyone loved it.

My husband and I love these.  I had to use what I had on hand.  I used brown rice instead and it gave great texture.  I used shallots since I didn't have green onions, cottage cheese instead of feta, and some canned diced tomatoes.  The kids are still little so they, of course, didn't like it.  As they say on Matilda, "Much too good for children".

Delicious. I was a little skeptical with the recipe, but served it with grilled sirloin and corn on the cob, and was a big hit for a family who usually doesn't enjoy vegetables!

Mine were awesome!  I replaced green peppers with red, and I bet you could use parmesean cheese instead of feta if you so desire.  Also I needed to use additional water in the rice (risotto always requires more water than listed in recipes) I will certainly make these again.

I used parmesan for half of the recipe and feta for the other. Loved them both. If you use parmesan you do need the salt but when using feta cut back on it. DONT salt your rice! That makes it way too salty.

My whole family minus one picky daughter. loved these. the peppers came out cooked perfect and the use of feta made a nice compliment to the other flavors. I hade to make a couple of substitiutes: used brown rice, yellow onion, and omitted the tomatoes. just wonderful.

These were so yummy!  I used red, yellow, and orange peppers too.  The red were actually the best ones.  I followed the advice of another reviewer, and used about half the salt that the recipe called for.  Next time, I will leave it out all together, because the feta makes it salty enough (and slightly too salty with the salt added).  I am glad I stuck with using the arborio rice (although any rice would work really), because it really helped to "make" the recipe.  I certainly plan on making these often!

Love this recipe! Only things I changed were red peppers instead of green (because I like sweeter peppers) and I used freshly grated parmesan cheese because I don't care for feta. I've made this recipe twice now and absolutely love it!

very good!  I couldn't put the ingredients together in my mind, I was thinking that the stuffing would not be flavorful, so when I sauteed the veggies, I added a tablespoon or two of balsamic vinegar.  They came out great and probably would have been great without the vinegar.

Quite possibly the best main dish I have ever made.  After reading a few reviews and being hungry at the grocery store, I made the following changes:  1. Arborio rice was rather expensive, so I used brown rice and doubled it.  2. Used closer to 5 green onions.  3. Also sauted 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion and 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms.  4. Reduced feta to 1/4 cup.  Super delicious.  Thank you thank you.

Easy recipe that looks good too.  I didn't use the Italian seasoning and used red and yellow peps.  The feta is very salty so add salt to taste.  I found 1 tsp of salt to be just right.  Next time I will add some corn to give the rice mixture more texture.

These are fantastic.  My peppers slumped a bit. Next time I try these I will either cook peppers for 20 mins or i will just cut the top of the pepper and stuff the whole pepper.  These will be a regular fixing in our household.  They are wonderful!

This was a nice side dish to go with our grilled chicken.  I do think when I make this again I will cook the rice in chicken broth, omit the salt and to the skillet will add minced garlic and try a can of drained Rotel tomatoes leaving out the fresh tomato, also will try different cheeses.   A fun recipe to play around with!

This is one of my favorite dishes to make for my non-veggie boyfriend. We have no side dishes with it even, it's so filling. I've never found Aborio rice so we just use a 'dirty rice' box mix. And the feta is the best part! Delicious!

This recipe was delicious!!!  I recommended this recipe to my mom and she had us over for dinner last night to try them out.  They were a hit!  My BF (who hates bell peppers) ate two of them.  My mom made the recipe as is with no changes.  I couldn't believe the flavor.  I will be making these in my home!

Absolutely wonderful! I've made this dish over a dozen times already and it has never failed to impress. The only changes I make are to use 3 green onions and to mince 1 clove of garlic for the spice mixture. I also only leave the peppers in the oven for 20 minutes. Outstanding! :)

Good w/green peppers, but I bet GREAT with red, orange or yellow! I used loads of fresh basil in this which was very tasty. Next time, I'll use another tomato and make the arborio in some type of broth or stock (either veggie or chicken) for even more flavor.

I subbed the italian seasoning with Mrs Dash. I also cooked some ground beef to make the recipe "boyfriend approved". I just cooked the ground beef with the green onions. Then drained the fat, added the basil, Mrs Dash, a bit of pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper. I've made stuffed peppers before. I can't recall which recipe i used, but was very disappointed. But this one is a winner.

Theses stuffed peppers are awesome!!! Especially for being meatless! My husband absolutely loves them. The feta cheese brings out the flavor, I made them exactly how it says and it comes out perfect every time!

One of my old standbys. After reading the other reviews, I've reduced the roasting time for the peppers to 15 minutes and also cut the amount of feta. No salt needed here -- the feta will do the trick. I also like to use different-colored peppers for visual appeal. Enjoy!

Ok, these stuffed peppers tasted great, but looked  flat. They did not hold their shape after 25 minutes in the oven. I think that roasting time should be reduced to 15 mn, with rotating the peppers once to get an even browing on all of them.
I didn't have any arborio rice so I used basmati rice instead, and that is may be why I ended up with lefterover stuffing. 
I will be make this often. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I've made this many times...both the veg version and with the addition of ground beef (at the husband's request).  I like to add a small can tomato sauce to the mix during the winter...makes it more of a "comfort food" for me.  Love the Feta cheese.  Great recipe with or without ground beef.  I microwave my pepper halves for about 3 minutes before stuffing...speeds the process for me.

I've been making this for about 3 years now and my whole family loves it.  It's first class as it is, but a variation we like even more is to use soft goat cheese instead of feta and stir it into the hot rice/tomato mixture until it totally melts, then stuff the peppers with the creamy cheesy mixture.  I often make extra cheese/tomato/rice mix just to watch everyone scrape the frying pan clean.

YUMMY!  This was such a good recipe, we are still talking about how good dinner was, hours later.  The only change I made was adding some garlic with the onion.  This is going to be a regular dish for us. I would just make the rice as a side dish as well.  MmmmmMmmmm!

First stuffed pepper I ever made and it was great!  We added a couple of minced cloves of garlic with the oil, also added a can of black beans (drained) as some one else had suggested.  A whole can of diced tomatoes drained was used in place of the fresh.  Will be making this one again.

These were terrific!  This was my first time making stuffed peppers and I was surprised by how easy they were to put together.  I made a few alterations/additions:  I sauteed some mushrooms and added them, I added some corn and minced garlic, and I mixed in a little tomato sauce at the end.  I can't emphasize enough how good these were and I definitely forsee these becoming a staple in my household!

I loved these.  The flavor was perfect.  I didn't have Italian seasoning, but I mixed in some thyme, rosemary, sage, oregano and extra basil.  Also, with the tomatoes I added a bit of tofu in tiny chunks, probably about 1/2 cup. The feta was the perfect flavor for this dish!

Easy recipe.  I added ground beef, mozerella cheese and fresh pressed garlic to the mixture.  I then topped the stuffed peppers with a little more cheese.  My husband enjoyed these, I felt like they were still missing something.  I will make again, but play with recipe.

These were really pretty easy to make. The kids ate the rice out of them, but the adults gobbled them up. I would also add yellow onions and garlic to the saute mixture for more aroma and flavor. I doubled the recipe.

Honestly, I think next time I make this, I am going to just forget the peppers all together and make the filling for a side dish - it's very yummy!  Maybe I'll chop some peppers up into it.    Good recipe, would also be good with some ground beef.

This is a great recipe. Super easy and super tasty. I did make a few changes. I used fresh basil and garlic. I also cooked the peppers for less time then called for as others have suggested. I'm sure it would have still been just as good without the changes!

This recipe was just great with wonderful flavor! I didn't use the arbonio rice that it called for-I just used regular rice and cooked it up ahead the night before. My husband (who is a huge "meat eater" absolutely loved them too)

Very delicious! I served the stuffed peppers with a spoonful (or dollop) of sour cream on top, which tasted great. Next time though I will probably use about 1/4 tsp of salt and only put the peppers in the oven for 15-20 minutes.

My kids love these!  I use yellow/orange peppers, because my 6 year old likes them best.  I leave out the feta for the kids and just sprinkle with parmesan before serving.  My husband and I like the feta!!  A great, easy entree!

Quite tasty and very easy to do.  My husband enjoyed it very much.  The basil and italian seasoning were very nice and aromatic.  I used green bell peppers, but I think next time I will try red and yellow for more sweetness and flavour.  I will definitely do this again.

I would give this more stars if I could! This recipe is DELICIOUS!! The only thing I changed is that I followed other reviewers' recommendations and didn't cook the peppers so long before stuffing them. I've made the recipe twice now and the first time, I left them in the oven for about 5 minutes. The second time, I didn't put them in at all. The main difference is that when you don't cook it before you stuff it, you taste a bit more of the pepper. (And it's easier to stuff because the "shell" is more firm.) This will be a regular in my rotation. Needs no other changes!!

Excellent meat-free recipe.  I usually prefer ground beef in it, but this was great.  Several other posters have said the roasting time for the peppers was too long.  I think it depends on your oven.  The recipe does say to roast 25-30 min., OR "until tender," so check them frequently.

This is a great recipe! I only changed one thing by adding some finely chopped mushroom to the onion mixture when it was sauteing. Absolutely delicious, and I'm going to be making this frequently!

this was an excellent recipe.  i changed it a bit only because of what i had on hand and what was in my grocery store...i live in germany.  but the recipe is fabulous because it's so easy to make with just about anything you throw in.  i recommend adding some corn, scallions and mushrooms. whatever seasoning and herbs are fine...i used a powder salad dressing packet i found here and some salt, pepper and rosemary.  seriously easy and tastes amazing.  and looks even better...which is impressive.  perfect for dinner parties.

Absolutely excellent. I doubled the amount of feta (simply because I love it) but otherwise made exactly as per the recipe. Served them with Roast Chicken with Rosemary (also from this site) and they were a huge hit with my Sunday lunch guests. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes I’ve found on this website! I made some slight substitutions due to the lack of the ingredients called for. I didn’t have any onions on hand so I omitted them completely. I didn’t have any “Italian Seasoning” so I used parsley, rosemary, and oregano in its place. I also used regular rice and a can of diced tomatoes, drained. The taste was terrific and I will absolutely make these again!

Excellent!  I substituted about 1/4 cup chopped sundried tomatoes (in oil, drained) for the plain tomato.  Great leftover the next day for lunch.  Will definitely make again!

This is so yummy!  I've made it many times and always used red and yellow peppers, the sweetness of the pepper is a good addition to the flavor of the rice.  I sometimes make extra rice stuffing just to eat on its own, and it's equally good.  I do decrease the amount of salt in the recipe to a minimum, because the spices and feta cheese already provides enough flavors.

These came out awesome! I browned a package (a pound or so) of meatloaf mix (veal/pork/beef) right before adding the rice back in and it was so delicious. I made sure to double everything else aside from the rice though. I also had three smaller tomatoes so I used 3 instead of doubling. You can’t go wrong with this recipe, but if you’re like us, you need some additional protein!

This is a great recipe. I cut the tops off the pepper, instead of cutting it long-ways, because it stands up better after cooking. I also prefer red, orange or yellow peppers, but that's just personal preference. There is plenty of flavor in this and, if you want to make it dairy-free, just leave off the cheese!

I made the recipe as is. As someone who never really liked veggies, I've been trying to eat better. This was definitely a tasty recipe! I have made it again adding 1 extra pepper, 1/2 lbs of meat with garlic and omitting the feta and replacing it with mozzarella and grated parmesan cheese

The was my first time making and eating stuffed peppers! I grew up a vegetarian in a meat eating family and my mom always made stuffed peppers but they were filled with meat. They always smelled great but I was never able to eat them. I followed this recipe as written with one small change. Instead of adding Italian Seasoning I subbed it for a few tablespoons of tomato basil pasta sauce. I will be making this recipe over and over again!

Very Healthy! This recipe is light yet fulfilling. You can add many different ingredients to this to add extra flavor. I added 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 diced yellow onion. It turned out very good :) Thank you!

I started making this because of my veggie friend staying with us-- but I find that I really like it as well (though I must admit to making myself a bit of steak on the side).  I also add a touch of cayenne (or chili powder when I'm out of cayenne).  Wonderful recipe!  It's a big hit every time I make it.

Used cheddar cheese and sausage instead, and used regular rice. I also add tomato sauce and/or canned diced tomatoes, which made it more moist.

These are another good stuffed pepper. Picky eater approved. Instead of green onion I used white onion (1/3 diced) and added some sweet peppers. I used brown rice instead of the Arborio rice. I also did 3 peppers cut in half instead of 2. Next time I will see how it does when meat is added.

I adore this recipe and probably make it twice a month. I usually make the rice like it says to on the bag, which is a little bit different. I think these taste even better reheated the second day.

Delicious! I used instant rice and Colby Jack because that's  what I had and this was so good. Added ground beef to half for my hubs and He really liked it too.

This is a good base recipe. The first time I cooked this I followed it as written but found it to be a little bland. I made it a 2nd time today and made these changes: I added a chicken bouillon cube to the water I cooked the rice in, I used 1/2 can of mild Rotel since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, I probably doubled the Italian seasoning, and I had tomato basil feta on hand. It came out pretty yummy! Also, adding frozen corn to this is a great addition. Next time I'll probably add some ground beef or pork to it.

I did ad lib a little as well - since I was looking to use what I had on hand. Ground beef, onion, garlic, red and yellow peppers, fresh basil, left over brown rice, sprinkled some cayenne, with the other seasonings listed in the recipe, ricotta (about a 1/4 cup), as well as the feta, no green onions, no tomato (but the ricotta helped to add moisture and keep everything together), cut down on the salt as well as another reviewer.  This was a great save for dinner tonight :)

This was so good! So different from how I usually make stuffed pepper but it tastes amazing. A light dinner. Will definitely try it with quinoa instead of rice.

Absolutely Wonderful! This is an excellent and easy recipe that everyone loves. And the best part is that you can change the ingredients slightly to change the flavor of nationality for it, you may want to not add feta cheese but instead chili powder if you want more of a Mexican flavor, things like this. And it makes a vibrant and colorful presentation if you use a variety of different colored peppers. Way to go @Sandy!

Loved this. It's now one of my regular rotating meals. I've even served it for a dinner party with a great reception. I find that using canned diced fire roasted tomatoes or tomatoes with green chilies adds a nice extra flavor. I also cut out the added salt like many of the other reviewers recommend and enjoy using multicolored bell peppers.

Loved it, this is a new side dish in our family.. here are my alterations...
-Use parchment paper to line the baking sheet and used olive oil to brush them on the peppers (cut side) and on the top skin.
-I doubled the recipe as is. Note: I had leftovers of the rice mixture with 4 large red peppers. Could of possibly added one or two more peppers..
-Instead of a tomato, I used 1 cup of diced tomatoes from Aylmer
-I did not add salt because there is enough salt in the feta
-For feta I used 3/4 cup of the Kraft (sundried tomato) one.

Amazing recipe! I used wild rice and tasted great. I also skipped "Italian seasoning" and just threw in some Italian type spices. The feta is a perfect cheese. Easy to make and the family loves it!

I made this pretty much as written except that I had red peppers and it's wonderful! My husband raved and raved. This is a great meatless dish. Next time I'll double the recipe so I can have leftovers. Thanks for a great recipe!

I always use this for my vegetarian daughter on nights the rest of the family has meat. Very flavorful and easy to make. I use basmati rice cooked in vegetable broth. I also cut up some of the pepper caps and sauté with the tomato mixture. Cooking the stuffed peppers in muffin pans is a great tip!

This was a great recipe!  I modified it a little though.  I used Royal Blend rice (white/brown/wild & red rice).  I cooked it according to the directions on the container and added a beef bouillon cube and a teaspoon of butter in the water while it boiled.  For the Italian seasoning all I had on hand was Kraft Italian Anything dry packet mix.  I used a teaspoon.  I did not use feta cheese, I used Kraft no fat shredded cheddar cheese. I really don't think it needs any cheese mixed in with the rice at all.  Maybe just a little mozzarella on top when I make this next time.  Also, a teaspoon of salt is WAY to much.  Thank goodness I made extra rice and was able to tone it down a little.  Wait until the end to add salt, just before you put the cheese in.  I will definitely be making this again!

I just tried this recipe. It is good but I found it way too salty.  I would cut the salt in half, because the feta cheese is salty, you really don't need a tspn of salt.  I also added about a Tbsp of tomato sauce on top of each stuffed pepped and about a teaspoon of grated parm cheese before I put in the oven.

These are the best stuffed peppers I've ever had and they are so easy to make!! I've only made stuffed peppers once before but decided to try these out on my first time cooking for a guy I just started dating and he couldn't get enough of them! He said they were the best stuffed peppers he'd ever had, went back for seconds, and ate what was left on my plate all the while talking about how good they were. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out flawless. I will definitely be making these again!

I loved these peppers BUT I changed it completely. Not on purpose. BUT, I didn't have any tomatoes, or onions or Feta. So I just mixed in half a cup of mild salsa, and some cheddar cheese and that's it. I skipped all the spices and everything. And it turned out delicious.

LOVE IT, although I added less than half of the salt it called for and it turned out just fine.  I think that next time I will omit the salt completely, as it doesn't seem especially necessary.  The filling is a little dry like others stated, which made me worried while mixing it all together in the pan but I wanted to try it the "right" way and didn't add anything to water it down.  Turned out AMAZING.

Delicious if you leave out the feta or just put a sprinkle on top. I didn't like it when I added it into the rice mixture.

Thought this recipe was good. I am a fan of feta but thin it kinda took over. Will make again but maybe with a little less feta.

This was my first stuffed pepper recipe and I loved it! I substituted the feta cheese for tex mex and added in some diced celery. I will definitely try adding different combinations of vegetables next time.

I had to make a lot of adjustments for my fussy/special diet family. My family prefers red peppers over green, so I used those. Additionally, I added some 'gimme lean' fake sausage that I fried in a pam-sprayed pan before the onions, then proceeded per the directions. The only other swap was kraft fat free shredded cheddar in place of the feta. I would love to have tried the feta, but I'm the only one that likes it. I hate when people review a recipe after making so many changes, but this was delicious, so I'm giving it 5 stars, anyway. My 16 year old ate 4 half peppers and wanted more! Thank you for the wonderful base recipe, Sandy!

I love these are vegetarian. While I enjoy the traditional stuffed peppers with beef these have flavor and a lightness to them.  They make a good side dish and a nice healthy lunch dish by themselves.  I use red, yellow, orange, as well as green peppers.  Reduce salt or replace with a salt substitute.  One half of a pepper is under 200 calories.

I made these a while ago when I just felt like trying something different with capsicums, and I don't like minced beef recipes very much.  I added a clove of fresh garlic, a finely diced onion, more salt, and I didn't have italian seasoning so I just added oregano, chilli powder, thyme and some more dried basil.  I also used red and yellow peppers instead of green, we never have green ones lying around.  I totally agree with other reviewers, these were nice, but don't really stand up on their own as the sole dish.  They're better as a side.  On the positive side I had one at room temperature the next day for lunch and it was perfect for a light lunch.

So yummy just the way it is! The herb mix works really well. The cheese adds the perfect amount of saltines to it without adding any extra.

I've also added a teeny bit of corn as a variation. And topped it with a good sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.

Loved it!  Of course, always have to personalize it.  Added 2 cloves fresh garlic; additional diced tomato and some finely chopped broccoli; used fresh basil; added a pinch of cayenne; used red peppers instead of green; and used goat cheese instead of feta (because that's all I had on-hand).  Was absolutely delicious and very easy to make!

This was fantastic! My husband and I definitely enjoyed it! I added diced chicken for some extra protein. I also used Mexican rice, shredded Mexican cheeses, and diced white onions. Overall prep time wasn't too long. Definitely worth making again!

My new favorite way to make stuffed pepperes. I didnt have any green onions so I used red. I also subbed a can of Italian style diced tomatoes, which added a lot of flavor, and threw in a couple of handfuls of spinach. If you like feta, this recipe is for you.

I've made this a few times, once as written and the second time I made a light tomato sauce and stuffed a raw pepper.  I put the sauce in a microwave safe dish and put the stuffed pepper on top, covered the dish and microwaved it for about 7 minutes.  The steam cooked the pepper and I didn't have to turn on the oven.  Delicious :-)

These are probably the best stuffed peppers I've ever made.  I'm sure it would have been perfect as is, but I had a zucchini that I wanted to use up and I also added garlic and a little bit of pesto.  I didn't have a tomato but I did have some crushed tomatoes and I think it made it even better.  Served them up as the main dish and they were wonderful.

My husband loved these and he normally hates bell peppers in anything.  I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white rice because it was cheaper than the Arborio plus I already had it on hand. They turned out great!  The feta cheese was a little expensive, but I don't think it would have been the same without it.

Really good. I couldn't find large green peppers in the shop, so I ended up using a red one and it was fantastic. I also mixed some garlic into the onion mixture (I'm a huge garlic fan) and I used slightly more feta than in the recipe, which made the stuffing really smooth and creamy. Definitely making these again and soon.

This was a great change from traditional stuffed peppers. For those of you out there who were missing items or emptying freezer like me- my changes were used canned diced tomotoes with green chilies, crumbled up leftover meatballs, and threw in about 1/2 cup of corn. These were great!

This was amazing! I made a few changes. I rubbed EVOO on the peppers prior to putting them in the oven, and I only cooked them for 15 minutes. Had I left them any longer they would have lost their form. I also added Ground Turkey and used couscous instead of arborio Rice. The couscous gave the stuffing a thick moist consistency. I loved this and will make it again.

This is a great base recipe, I use it a lot but make all kinds of changes depending on what I have and what I'm in the mood for. I've used ground turkey, garlic and sauce with mozzarella for a more italian style, or some turkey, taco spice and cheddar for a more mexican flavor. You can really stuff them with whatever you want  - they've always turned out good for me and my husband loves them.

Turned out perfect. I used regulars oninons instead of green and through in some frozen corn towards the end. The aroma of the herbs was mouth watering. Be sure to grease the pan you place the peppers on. They were slightly resistant when removing after the intial baking.

Great recipe! I looked through a lot of the suggestions to change it up slightly, adding garlic, corn, and carrots and topping it with a little parmesan. I've even made it before with brown rice and it still tastes wonderful!

Amazing - added finely chopped mushrooms and asparagus to onions before adding tomatoes and rice - and used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta. Absolutely amazing flavor.

Good base, but way too salty.  I would use about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt next time.  Otherwise, pretty tasty.  Next time I will make a few changes, definitely adding garlic!

This is a great, tasty recipe.  A little labor intensive, but worth the work.  And hey, if you don't have any peppers, just serve the seasoned rice (I used wild rice).  It's great!  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this recipe calls for too much salt and feta cheese. Given the saltiness of the feta cheese I would cut out the salt. I would also reduce the amount of feta cheese to half. I am one to put in extra feta, but since this called for 1/2 cup, I did not add extra cheese. The texture was nice. If I were to make this again, I would add mushrooms, not use salt, and 1/8 cup of feta. I like the idea of topping with a slice of cheese.

Delicious! They also are beautiful when done! I used brown basmati rice instead of arborio. I would also say that 1/2 stuffed pepper serves one so this recipe would really serve 4 at my table.

I love these stuffed peppers!  They are so easy to put together, and look quite impressive, too.  I love them as a side dish to fish - Makes a nice, light side without having to use plain rice or pasta.  Thank you!

This was delicious!!!  So easy to make and a hit in my household.  I used long grain, brown rice because our store didn't have Arborio rice.  Used yellow and orange bell peppers (I like the taste better) and fresh basil.  Also I substituted feta cheese that was flavored with herb and garlic then added only half the amount of Italian seasoning.  I added ground beef, cooked with the onions, basil, tomato and added garlic.  Then spooned it all together baked for 7 more minutes and it came out great! I can't wait to cook this again.

This was so good.  My husband couldn't get enough.  I did do it a little differently, but I know without my additions, it would've been just as good.  I added a lb of ground beef & 1/2 tsp of minced garlic to the onion seasoning mixture.  YUMMY!

Fantastic! I also rubbed a little olive oil on the peppers and I had to use sautéed white onion and brown rice but it came out great. We will make this one again.

This is THE BEST vegetarian meal i have EVER had. wow.  only change made is using green AND red bell peppers. the red was so much better than the green.  we also used 4 green onions and a tad more olive oil.  also, like other reviewers, we didn't use the pricey Arborio rice. We precooked brown Minute Rice. PERFECTION!!!

LOVED this recipe! I was cooking for some non-carb friends so kept the rice off to the side (for myself). I also added to the sautee some fresh minced garlic, chopped mushrooms, and spinach. To the side, I cooked up some blackened chicken. After finishing the sautee according the recipe I added the chicken and let it simmer before stuffing the peppers. I also subsituted the feta with goat cheese and instead of mixing it into the stuffing I just scooped some into the roasted peppers before stuffing them. All-in-all a great recipe! I usually don't deviate but thank you!

This was super easy and delicious! I personally started the rice first, then prepped and cooked the peppers at the same time and then started the rest of the stuffing. It was all done in just the right time and only took about 30 min

Wonderful recipe - simple enough for even a (very) novice chef like me to follow! I only made one substitution - I'm not a big fan of feta, so I used the same amount of grated Monterey Jack instead, which I found worked really well. I did have a bit too much of the rice mixture for the size of the peppers but no matter - it was so delicious that I ate the remnants straight from the pan while waiting for the stuffed peppers to finish cooking! Thanks, Sandy, for sharing this lovely recipe.

My boyfriend and I made these tonight and we both give the stuffed beauties five stars. We did make one change and substituted the Arborio rice with orzo...the outcome was superb! We may have just found ourselves a weekly must-have.

It turned-out wonderfully! I didn't have fresh basil, Italian seasoning or Feta cheese, so I replaced them with basil flakes; a mix of oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder; and a mix of Asiago cheese and Parmesan cheese. Also used Basmati rice. Was absolutely delicious and will definitely make again.

These turned out great.  The cooking times were accurate on the peppers.  I added ground turkey to the rice mixture.  The feta is a great touch to the mixture.  My husband said this was the best stuffed bell pepper he's ever had (and he doesn't like bell peppers).

These were a huge hit! I did alter it a little. For instance, my grocer was all out of basil and I had some spinach, so I used it AND my fiance' is a meat eater so I added about a half a pound of lean ground beef. I also added garlic and substituted brown rice! DELICIOUS and very EASY to make!

I make this for my vegetarian daughter at least once a month! She loves it! The only thing I changed is I use fresh basil and oregano instead of dried, and I add 2-3 cloves of fresh garlic!

I've made this several times and will continue to do so. I omit the salt and tomato and add 1 hot italian sausage and it's perfect. I love it and my family eats it and it's easy yet special.

This is a great recipe! We loved these peppers. I added a clove of minced garlic (because we love garlic!) and use 1T fresh chopped basil instead of the dry when I can. Try it -- it's worth it! Thank you for the recipe!  :)

I sauteed some minced garlic (about 3 cloves) on the olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. Otherwise, I followed the instructions completely and I liked the dish very much.

This is such a good recipe!  I never would have thought to add feta to stuffed peppers.  I usually add some mushrooms, and use wild rice instead, but it comes out just fine.  Another interesting thing to try is adding a couple spoonfuls of hummus to the rice mixture - that thickens it a little and adds more flavor (not that it needs more - I just like the texture).

Just a good basic recipe you can do anything with really. The peppers I got weren't probably the right size to stuff(they ended up flattening out while being roasted) so next time I'll either just hollow them out and keep them whole or cut them up and mix them together with the rice mixture after roasting! Fresh mozzarella melted on top is excellent, too!

AMAZING! My boyfriend's non-veggie eating friends gobbled them up! I did use some red onion in place of the green onion and I couldn't tell that there was anything missing. I have not yet tried with ground meat, but definitely will for the meat eaters in the family!

A little too salty. Tastes much better if you mix the ingredients in a bowl instead of on the stove top.

I've been trying to incorporate more vegetarian meals and this is a perfect way to do so.  I used yellow onion and oregano because that is what I had and it was delicious.  I'm not usually a feta person, buy I loved these flavors together.  Two thumbs up.

I have made this recipe many many times and know it by heart now.  I add about 4 cloves of garlic (I really like garlic!) and use a lot more feta (I really like feta!)  Other than those minor changes, the recipe is perfect!  Like other reviewers, I don't keep the peppers in the oven for so long. I keep an eye on them and take them out as soon as they start to brown (about 10-15 minutes.)

This recipe was inspiring! I was too hungry to roast the bell peppers and stuff them, so I chopped them up and sauteed them with the onions. I added other chopped veggies like spinach, tomato and mushrooms and this came out wonderful. I read reviews that this could be bland so, of course, I seasoned to taste, just bumping up the existing types of seasoning called for. I had some leftover rice, so I just tossed in the amount I wanted. I left out the feta this time, so I did make sure to salt it. I will make this recipe again, modified and as called for. This is a very tasty dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!!! I did however used diced tomatoes with jalapeno just to give it a little kick. I also prepared the peppers and brushed them with olive oil and cooked them on the grill for about 5 minutes. I prepared all the filling so it was nice and hot. Filled the peppers and returned them to the grill topped with asagio cheese and grilled for about 5-10 more minutes. Peppers had a nice grilled flavor as well

Added sun dried tomato and a little turkey sausage ( i know defeats the meatless but hubby is a carnivore) used all yellow and orange peppers and did on the grill to avoid heating up the house ( grill has a side burner) WONDERFUL summer meal when it is 10 outside to do it all outside just use foil on the grill

I don't think that just posting some of my drool from thinking of this recipe would be adequate! This is one of my absolute favorites for a quick easy meal. I have made it many, many times and I have taken to adding in some sauteed mushrooms. We also rub the inside and ouside of the peppers with some olive oil and maybe a little sea salt just to enhance the roasting process. YUM!

Delicious! I have tried three different recipes for stuffed peppers, and this one is by far the best. The feta cheese makes the rice part of the dish a whole meal in itself. I also added chopped mushrooms, which went very well with the rest of the flavors.

Very good.  Even my "meat eating" husband was satisfied with this as an entree.  I used brown rice to cut down on cost, and spinach instead of basil.

I love this recipe. Although I have followed the recipe to a "T" I have also used canned diced tomatoes in the place of fresh tomatoes and brown rice. Additionally I like to add 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the onions. I think the use of canned tomatoes with all the juice and the chopped garlic gives the end product a more moist and desirable taste. Very delicious and very filling!

My first rating!  I can NOT cook.  I HATE most "real" (=healthy) vegetables.  But I took a chance and I am THRILLED to say that my whole family (including ME) loved this recipe!  Thanks so much.  I have gained so much confidence in my cooking as well as my taste buds!  There's hope for me yet.  :-)

The best stuffed bell peppers I have ever had.  I listened to the other reviews about roasting the peppers for only 15 minutes which seemed just about right. Very good. Will make again.

These are absolutely delicious! I did change it up a bit, though. For starters, i used sun dried tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes.  To rehydrate them, i boiled them in low sodium vegetable broth.  I used the this broth to then cook the quiona instead of rice.  I forgot to buy green onions, so i used half a regular onion and sauted that with garlic in the oil with the herbs.  Instead of regular pepper, i used cayanne pepper.  I also added frozen corn and edamame and fresh spinach to the onion mixture.  Mixed this with the feta and quiona and stuffed the peppers. There was plenty of salt in the broth and feta that i didnt need extra.  This will be a regular in my house!

These are fabulous! I have gotten so many compliments. I like to use orange and yellow bell peppers. And I use low-fat feta. Thank you for the recipe!

We had all ingredients in the house, but had to substitute white rice and this dish is great.  Different than the same usual stuffed pepper and we both love feta, perfect match.

These were pretty good.  I think the roasting time for the peppers is way off for my oven, I may do it for maybe 10 minutes next time.

Absolutely delicious!! I tasted the rice mix after I made it, and I was blown away! Yum! I used minute brown rice, just to make it a little quicker. This is one our top favorite recipes.

This is a tasty recipe and very easy to make.  I did make a few adjustments...In addition to the suggested ingredients, I sauteed fresh chopped garlic & white onions and added them to the mixture.  I also used brown instead of the arborio rice and poured in a little vegetable stock to soften the brown rice.  I also added a little Adobo spanish seasoning to the rice when mixing all of the ingredients together for additional flavor.  This is a healthy side dish that I make regularly.

This recipe turned out great! I made a few changes based on suggestions of comments and what I had available. I cooked red onion with garlic and seasonings, then added ground beef. After draining the oil, I stirred in the cooked rice and one can of diced tomatoes. I used red and orange peppers which I cooked for 25 minutes, stuffed with mixture, then topped with feta cheese. Put back in the oven for 5 minutes to heat through, then broiled for another 5 minutes to brown cheese. The stuffed peppers were a hit.

Loved this. I am not a big fan of stuffed peppers, but this was easy and my husband loved it as well! I chopped up 1 onion and then mixed a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregeno and garlic, mixed in the feta and stuffed the peppers. IT was awesome!

4 & 1/2 stars only because it was too salty for our taste but that is so easily remedied next time. My husband and I loved this recipe!  I will omit the salt next time because the feta adds enough salt.  YUMMY!

First time making stuffed peppers using this recipe and my husband and I absolutely loved them!!! Granted, I didn't have exactly all of the ingredients called for when I first made this, but the substitutes that I used made it fantastic.  I like to use red peppers because they add a bit more flavor than green ones.  I used regular parboiled rice, 1 small yellow onion, and Mrs. Dash Original Seasoning Blend instead of Italian seasoning since that's what I had.  And just to make the rice with the above ingredients presents such an aroma that will surely bring everyone quickly to the table :-)

Not only crazy-yummy, but very pretty, too...especially the yellow peppers. These would be a 4.8 or .9, as I made a couple minor changes to add flavor. I added some bullion when I cooked the rice, which was brown rice, and used parmesan instead of feta, as it was what I had on hand. I also added some diced mushrooms. Delicious! I agree that the rice is good enough to eat without the peppers. Great recipe!

I made this 4 my mom's birthday, everyone loved it. I didn't have any green onion or basil on hand so I just used purple onions and dried peppermint leaves and they worked just fine. I also added a bit of mozzarella cheese on it and put it in the oven 4 a few minutes 4 it 2 melt. Delicious!

I added some shredded cheese to the top. It was a great dinner and I will definitly be making this dish again and agian. Thank you for the recipe!

Mmm! These were great. I used brown rice and liked the contrast of slightly crunchy rice to the soft texture of the red and yellow peppers. The feta cheese blended so nicely with the flavors of green onion, tomato, garlic, and rice. This was a great side dish to accompany Spinach Stuffed Chicken Breasts (also from this site).

this recipe was excellent! i've wanted to try to make stuffed peppers for awhile and wanted a good vegetarian recipe. This tasted great. I backed off the heat to about 350 (400 just seems to burn everything) and i used 1 cup of instant white rice and 3/4 of a cup fat free feta. the rest of the recipe i followed as directed and the result was awesome! i'll definitely make it again :-)

LOVED IT!!!  Which is a surprise since my Mom's stuffed pepper recipe has always been my favorite and unbeatable.  I used a red and yellow pepper.  I baked the peppers for 15 minutes and some of the edges ended up brown despite greasing the baking sheet.  I omitted the salt; the fat free feta that I used had enough.  I also used brown rice and 1/2 green and 1/2 white onion.  I think if you bake the peppers more than 15 minutes the end result and texture would be comparable to the cooked tomatoes; mushy not slightly firm.  Again, LOVED this recipe; will make again!

I pretty much follow the recipe exactly (though I usually eyeball quantities), and also added half a large link of sausage diced up.  SO TASTY!  And all the food groups are represented!

Not bad! Added a few changes that I thought made it even better. First, red peppers are the best (much sweeter then green). I used a wild rice mix that was amazing with an added can of mushroom soup. I also added sliced celery and chopped water chestnuts. All of that gave it more of a "stuffing" like feel. I thought feta would be weird but it was amazing. I also melted some mozzerella on top. With these changes easily a 5 star recipe!

This is really, really good.  I've made it several times.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because I made one little change and cut the salt in half.  My carnivore husband did not miss the meat at all.

Delicious...I will definitely make this again.  I used "Texmatti" American basmatti rice, omitted the salt, & it was yummy.  This would also make an excellent rice dish w/o the peppers.

My mom and I make this recipe all the time, so I figured I should finally review it! This is by far the best stuffed peppers recipe I have ever found / eaten. The feta really gives it an oomph. 

These are the only changes I ever make:
-substitute red/yellow peppers for green
-use white AS WELL AS green onions
-add spices liberally
-once I used canned diced tomatoes because it was all I had, and that worked out fine too

These were really good! I used shredded cheese for feta since I didn't have any on hand. Otherwise I followed the recipe! Will be making again. On a side note...I loved the stuffing. I usually only eat the pepper and leave the rice but this is the first time I ate it ALL! Thanks

These were good, but the cook time is way too long and my boyfriend and I thought there was too much feta cheese. I will make this again but use the suggestion of leaving out the feta cheese and just sprinking parmesan cheese on top. I will also half the cooking time.

By far....the BEST recipe I've gotten from this site. Healthy, easy, AND it tastes great! I did add two things but I know it would be great without....two cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup of vegetarian sausage crumbles. I added these things with the tomato - it did add a little spicy "kick" to the pepper. My husband and I wanted to eat all four peppers but they were so filling we couldn't. To my great delight, the leftover pepper was very good the next day.

I made this one evening with some friends and they were absolutely incredible!!!!!!  The peppers turned out a little soft and wrinkly, so I would reduce the baking time for them to about 15-20 minutes instead.  GREAT RECIPE!

So good!  Very easy and the best stuffed pepper recipe I have had so far.  The recipe can be altered easily in case you get sick of eating the same thing all the time.  Next time I will try it with beef and cheddar cheese.

Really good!
The only suggestion I have is to reduce the cooking time for the onions and spices- I had to scramble to save mine from being burned because the oil was so hot. 
I also used a can of organic diced tomatoes bc that's all I had.
I will make these again for sure!!

This is my first time to rate a recipe, but this one was so good I felt I had to. These peppers were wonderful!! Followed the recipe pretty closely except I used red peppers instead of green (just a personal preference) and added peas b/c I had them leftover. Also, I used brown rice instead of Arborio as that is usually used to make risotto. Wonderful recipe. Will definately make again.

Excellent! As per other reviews, I cut down on the salt (salt in feta was enough) and added fresh herbs (basil). I also cooked the peppers for slightly less time than suggested in the recipe, as I think they look and taste better when they're not overly soft. I've made this a number of times, basically when I have stir-fry or other leftovers. Almost better this way, as the flavours have time to set in. Also looks very flash for company! One option is to just slice of the top of the peper (rather than lengthways), take out the seeds, then fill with mixture and put the top back on for presentation.

I was really intrigued when I saw this recipe as my husband and I have chosen to not eat meat for a variety of reasons.  This is one of the first vegetarian recipes I tried.  We loved them after modifying the filling quite a bit and made enough for 6 people.  Even my daughters liked them and they are pretty picky.  I added lots of fresh spinach when sauteing the onions (I used white onions) and garlic in olive oil.  I also used short grain rice.  I also added more spices.  I added quite a bit of Ms. Dash,  black pepper and lemon pepper.  I struggled with the filling being somewhat bland.  I also added diced fresh mushrooms when sauteing the garlic, spinach and onions.  Lastly, I topped the peppers with fresh Parmesan cheese.  Our guests and my family LOVED these.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I started making these about two years ago - i forgot about the recipe for a while but i am using it again. It is perfect because i am a vegetarian and my husband is not. Sometimes I use this as a meal for me and a side for him- other times i add ground sausage or turkey. You can use ANY vegetable- that is what is so great about this just use whats on hand. The ONLY thing that i disagree with when it comes to this recipe is the cooking time for the peppers before hand they only need 5 to 15 min max!

These were delicious!  I did make some changes to suit my taste.  I cut out the extra salt, the feta did take care of all the saltiness needed. I unfortunately, did not have any tomatoes on hand, which is a pity, but I added some corn.  All in all, I would definitely make this again. Super cheap when the ingredients are on hand, and very very delicious!

I have made this recipe as is for years and have always enjoyed it. I skip the salt since the feta has plenty and add some garlic.

As a change today, I added artichoke, purple and sweet onions and some red pepper flakes and it added a great kick and made it a little more creative.

Also, I roast the peppers whole just because I think the presentation is nicer when it is a whole pepper.

You really can't go wrong with this!

These are sooo good! I make them a couple times a month and almost every time I bring a dish to a party and everyone always loves them!! They're awesome! Last time I didn't have green onions, so I used a few cloves of garlic and it still turned out great! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were pretty good!  Growing up my Mom would make stuffed peppers but they were cooked in tomato sauce, I think that's why it wasn't quite right for me, I wanted a little more juice.  Used orange peppers tasted fantastic roasted.
It Didn't take a whole hour for me to cook as the recipe says, it was done in 35 minutes, even better!

So good, I used regular onion, diced canned tomatoes, and a wild rice blend. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was great!  I gave up meat for lent so am looking for meatless main dishes.  I loved the texture of the rice AND the feta cheese.  I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting a can of petite diced tomatoes and adding some finely diced zucchini and carrots.  I doubled the recipe and have eaten it for lunch the past two days.

I gave this a 4 because I made a few changes - regular rice; canned diced tomatoes; no salt; extra feta.  I also used yellow and red peppers, stuffed them, placed them in a covered casserole with a couple tablespoons water in the bottom and heated through.  Makes an excellent, different side dish.

I have never been a fan of stuffed peppers but this recipe is incredible.  I cooked with ground chicken instead of beef and the flavor was still delicious.  Thank you for sharing!  We'll have this one again tonight.

This is a really good recipe. However, I would not put my peppers in for as long as it states. They get very floppy and hard to fill. I also make mine with a mix of ground turkey and ground pork and they are really delicious!

The rice had fabulous flavour and roasting the pepper on the side is great so you can make it as crispy or cooked as you like. I added the tomatoes only just before spooning it into my pepper because I wanted them fresh. I also added some diced cucumbers. Will be making this again.

These were fantastic!  My brother's vegetarian girlfriend loved them even more - took the leftovers home to eat cold for lunch the next day!  I only used the red, yellow and orange peppers - beautiful on the serving plate.  I also reduced the roasting time as suggested - they came out perfect!

i liked the idea of cutting the peppers lengthwise, and then i just filled them with what was on hand:  ground beef and peppers, brown rice, a can of black beans (rinsed), and a can of ro-tel milder.  i rubbed the peppers with olive oil and roasted them  for just a few minutes less than the recipe called for, maybe my oven's hot.  i served the peppers with guacamole and pico de gallo.  fantastic!

These are fantastic!  A great vegetarian main dish, or side dish for meat.  My peppers were smaller so they were ready to pull at 20 minutes - you just have to watch them.  I also used what I had - brown rice instead of Arborio, and half a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh - it worked great.  I think the stuffing alone would make a good side dish too!  So yummy...

GREAT! I actually made a rice dish out of this to stretch a meal.  I cut 3 red & yellow bell peppers into chunks and sautéed them in the oil. Added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, then the spices from this recipe, and 1/2 cup of white wine.  I let that simmer until the wine was almost gone and added the rice & cheese. DELICIOUS!!! My picky fiancé ate it as well. Next time I will try the whole stuffed peppers.

This was pretty good!  Some things I did differently.  I did add ground turkey.  I forgot to buy arborio so used long grain or jasmin I don't remember which and it was still great. I used the advice of another and didn't cook the peppers for so long because it gets really soft.  I also topped with feta for presentation.  I used this recipe for recipe club and was a big hit!

YUM! This recipe was awesome even with a few ingredient changes: I used shredded mozarella and no onion. I skipped the last step to put back in oven for 5 minutes, the initial 30 minutes seemed to be quite enough. I will be making this again soon!

I love this receipe.  It's simple and it tastes wonderful.  I left out the salt as suggested and it was just right.  I am always looking for new ways to use green bell peppers since I always seem to have them in my fridge - I will use this receipe often.

Love this recipe!  Definately a keeper.  I would also reduce the amount of time peppers are roasted in oven.  Maybe 20-25 minutes instead.

Very nice.  I added some Italian sausage, since I tend to get complaints when I make vegetarian recipes.  Next time I think I'll take the tops off the peppers rather than halve them, as I think it will make the presentation nicer.

Overall this was delicious and I am looking forward to making this again.  Next time, however, I will just cut off the tops of the peppers, seed them, and roast them for half the specified time (when I followed the recipe's instructions I got floppy, flat peppers - which were delicious, but difficult to stuff).   I will also way down on the salt, since the feta has a lot of salt on its own, and I will serve it with a little bit of simple tomato sauce to give it some more juiciness.  But overall, a simple and delicious recipe.  I found that using scallions instead of your typical diced yellow onion added nicer color and a lighter, fresher flavor.

Really good.  Except I'd tone down the salt to a pinch (or none at all).  Also, I used red bell peppers instead of green and they were delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe! I used regular Kraft Minute uncooked rice instead of the fancy one, as suggested. It tasted just as good. The splash of flavors in the rice was amazing. The roasted peppers smelled so wonderful! We really enjoyed this dish. Thanks for sharing!

mine were very floppy but still tasted very good. i had to wrap them in foil to make a little cup for the filling. Second time around**didnt cook the peppers AT ALL before stuffing them and this really came out great!***I added ground turkey and lots of sliced garlic to the rice mixture.  I think the roast time for the peppers is WAY TOO LONG.   even my son said 5 stars!

Flavorful and delicious.  Fast too.  The only change I made was to use regular onion instead of green onion.  And these are a lot more filling than they seem - my boyfriend and I were both satisfied with one full pepper (two halves) each for dinner.

Very good flavors together.  And actually very simple to make.  Just be sure to cut the peppers so they form a nice cup - mine were a little floppy but still tasted great.

3/18/2011 Made again and posted the recipe to Facebook.... a friend who worked with my YEARS ago responded...."I remember when you brought these to work and shared them... they were delicious!" Now THAT'S a GREAT RECIPE when people remember it 6 years later! (The rice is good all by itself, if you don't like cooked peppers!)Use green, red & yellow peppers for a beautiful presentation!
This was a fabulous meal!  I've never been big on the taste of cooked peppers, but really enjoyed this.  I did use a well drained can of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic in place of the fresh, but otherwise went by the book!  Thanks!

These were so delicious, well worth the work! To save some time, I used a can of diced tomatoes and instant rice. I also doubled the recipe and between two of us there were hardly any peppers left!!

This is wonderful stuffed peppers.  My husband I love it!  Although, I didn't add crumbled feta cheese, but I sprinkle parmesan cheese on the top of the stuffed peppers.  It was delicous!

I have to give this five stars, even though I tweaked it to suit my kids that aren't fond of the peppers.  I used two small onions instead of the green and added garlic.  Instead of the italian seasoning, I used fresh basil (about 8 leaves altogether).  I then added some leftover roasted chicken.  I roasted the peppers, skinned and sliced, then added to the mix with the tomatoes. I added a tablespoon of fresh chopped chives too.  I served that part over the rice.  The feta was a great touch.  Those kids gobbled it up!  So I guess this was really "Stuffed Peppers MY WAY." :-)  But thanks for giving me a different angle on it all!

This was very good. I added some garlic to the onions, a little tabasco, sun dried tomatos and some parmessan cheese on top. I found that it was really tasty with a small dab of sour cream on top of the rice or on the side.

Fabulous!  Even one of my picky veggie 7 year olds liked it!  Not enough to eat much, but even a thumbs up is worth gold!  My vegan leaning husband also loved it!  We don't like feta cheese, so I substituted with mozzarella and it worked great!

I made these Stuffed Peppers (my first attempt at Stuffed Peppers) and they were delicious! Such a great flavour! I made them  with Red and Green Peppers and they both tasted great - easy and simple to do!! I also used the Tomato and Basil Feta which added more flavour to the dish!! Thanks for the recipe, Sandy!

Stuffed peppers were a success!  I replaced the feta with blue cheese and also added some cooked bacon chopped up.  But after 25 minutes in the oven, the peppers were DEFINATELY done.... so probably better to say cook for 20-25 minutes only.

These were the best stuffed peppers I've every had. The feta really added something to them. I used tomato basil feta and used red instead of green peppers. My husband is a real meat and potatoes guy so I had to add ground beef to the stuffing. They turned out absolutely fabulous. I served this to an unexpected dinner guest as well and she too said they were the best stuffed peppers she tasted. Thanks for the recipe Sandy!

The roasted peppers are great, highly recommend using red and yellow. The taste of the filling was a bit mild for me. I would suggest using a flavored feta (garlic and herb), maybe using a blue cheese instead, or try topping the peppers with grated parm. Next time I think I'll add garlic to the onions and use more green onions. Overall, easy and tastey.

Excellent recipe!  I used red peppers and roasted them for slightly less time than the recipe called for (I don't like it when roasted peppers get too mushy...)  I love feta cheese but the feta taste was a little too strong for me in this batch...next time I will use slightly less, but there will definitely be a next time!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

my wife & I really enjoy this recipe!  for a healthier option we use Quinoa instead of rice and fresh diced tomatoes to eliminate the  hugh sodium in canned tomatoes.

if you are going to add ground beef like I did, be sure to make a sauce for topping at the end as this dries out a bit. A tzatziki would be good with the beef, but for time reasons, i made a quick light tomato sauce in the same pan. Will be roasting peppers for any stuffed pepper I made going forward though! much better than boiling!!

I’ve made these peppers thousands of times! My dad is lactose intolerant so I substitute goat cheese for his peppers and he loves it. Sometimes I’ll half the salt and they still taste great!

These were great to use the day's harvest of peppers. I used Walla Walla onions instead of green, because that was also harvested, as was the tomato.  I used leftover Cilantro Lime rice. Will make these again.

I made this for dinner last night.  It was a last minute decision and this was easy to prepare quickly and I typically have everything the recipe calls for on hand.  I sautéed the tomatoes and onions with the spices and added 1 clove minced garlic, a handful of black beans and about 1 cup of monterey jack cheese, and finally added the rice.  I sautéed this for 20 minutes on very low heat.  The flavors blended well together.  It was a hit!  My family loved this dish!

Delicious!  However, I did modify the recipe to include ground chicken, fennel, diced red onion and I substituted a can of petite diced tomatoes (including juice) for the fresh tomato.  I garnished with the diagonal sliced green onion.  Roasting the bell peppers makes a ton of difference.   I will make this very frequently.

I made a few changes because I did not have the right cheese,  I like garlic, I wanted wild and brown rice, and I wanted to add a little meat--I added chopped ham. But the spices made the difference.  This is very versatile and I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe is a keeper.  The only change I made was I added two cloves of thinly sliced fresh garlic - which I do to most meat and bland recipes because I like the flavor of garlic.  This was the first time I had used Arborio Rice.  Love the fluffy, light texture.  I will find other uses for this rice

I am not vegan so like to add meat to mine.  I also have an adult child at home who doesnt like peppers.  SOOOO, I make this into a casserole by cutting up multi-color peppers and mixing them right in with all of the other ingredients.  Delish and solves for the fussy eater!  I love the idea of using feta!  Can't wait to try it it out!

Way too much sodium for me. Cut out the added salt because feta is already salted. Other than that very good, but my mother's is better.

This was my first time making stuffed peppers and they turned out great!  I don't eat beef, so this was a great alternative recipe. I used shallots instead of green onions and doubled the wonderful French feta that we had from 1/2 to 1 cup. My boyfriend said that he would've been really impressed even if he'd had this in a restaurant. A keeper, for sure.

Delish!! One of my fav recipes on this app!! I added 3 small cloves of garlic to the onion/spice mix and then some frozen corn to the tomatoes. I ignore the salt and pepper since there’s enough salt in the feta and the canned tomatoes I used. One of my roommates is lactose intolerant so I put the feta on top of two of the 4 peppers right before the final 5 minute roast in the oven and it’s a huge hit every time!!

This is a great recipe to bend to your will! It's good as it is, but it's flexible to add veggies you have around or change up spices or cheese to make it more appealing to your own personal taste. I liked it because it's easy to do, filling and no meat!  
Thank you for the recipe.

Loved this. I tweaked it a bit for my tastes but was honestly amazing and my husband LOVED it. It is super delicious, one of my new faves.. The arborio rice with it is amazing, don't use regular rice! I will make this again for sure. 

Here were my changes:

I used 3 peppers, one green and two red, so I adjusted water, olive oil, rice, and seasoning amounts accordingly. 

Dice 3/4 lg white onion instead of green onion
Add 3-4 cloves fresh garlic, then brown 
Remove 1/3 of the onion mixture
Brown pre-cooked mild Italian chicken sausage  
Dice a few mushrooms and add 
I only used one large diced tomato which was totally fine for me
Sub feta for 1/2 C  Italian cheese blend + 1/4 C shredded Parmesan cheese
Place peppers in muffin tin to avoid collapse

This recipe is a great basic platform. Added ground beef, caramelized onions, and a touch of garlic. My son doesn't like green peppers, but loved the filling. I will remember to use red and yellow peppers next time. My wife doesn't like feta cheese so a mix of shredded mozzarella, provolone, and Romano were melted in the final stage. A hit with the family and a new favorite!

My whole family loves this recipe and I have made it multiple times.  I use mostly red, yellow and orange peppers; green for me because I'm the only one who likes their flavor. I chop off the top 1/2" of each pepper and remove the ribs/seeds. Then rub the pepper bottoms with a little olive oil - I've found that too much makes them limp. Roasted the peppers for 20-5 min @ 400 degrees;  until the tops start to turn brown - don't over roast or they collapse. Empty out the liquid in the roasted peppers before stuffing; perhaps this could be added to your mixture if you need more liquid, but I have not tried this. For 8 peppers I used the following quantities:  I cooked 1 bunch green onions, 1 can petite diced tomatoes with their liquid, and 1 large tomato diced. For the rest of the mixture I used 2 c dry rice (I only mixed in about 3/4 of the cooked rice), 2 cans black beans (I rinse them before adding), 1 can corn (rinsed), feta & the spices. I mixed the cooked onion/tomatoes, rice, beans, corn, feta & spices all together in a separate bowl and then stuffed them. I placed shredded Mozzarella cheese on top and put back in the oven. Yum.

I made a lot of changes that improved it to a 4 or 5 stars for me but I'm not sure others would like my changes so not gonna bother describing it all. I decided to top them with a mix of 3 cheeses which added a lot of extra fat and was totally unnecessary but then again, can one ever have "too much cheese" ? haha

It was delicious! I exchanged some items and omitted a few but it turned out fabulous. I used brown rice, Romano cheese, sautéed baby portobello mushrooms, and chopped pepper top pieces. I will definitely be making this again.

I was skeptical while I was making this, but once I tasted the final product.. Yummy!! I made one change to adapt to what I had on hand. I used instant brown rice that I cooked in vegetable broth as suggested by another review. I did one cup broth and one cup rice and it was the perfect amount for the recipe. Everything else I followed to a T. Wonderful dinner! Will make again!

I give this 5 stars because there are so many ways to substitute vegetarian grains if you don’t want rice and it has a real nice spice to it. I don’t like to change up a recipe the first time I made this but I actually had to (well, not really. I could have gone to the store ). Instead of a rice I just happened to have a half cup lentils and a half cup quinoa that were already cooked up from a previous meal and I had put them in the freezer for future use. Everything else was exactly what the recipe asked for. It was so delicious.

used white onion & tinned chopped tomato. Great way to use green peppers- I always seem to get too many when I buy a multi pack. This is going to become a regular side dish in our house.

I added a 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to give it some lovely heat. I would bake the peppers only 15 mins on 450 then stuff them, top with cheese and broil 3 mins.
Great recipe, easy and delicious. Thank You!

I made it as listed, but it wasn't as good as other stuffed peppers I had. So the second time I made adjustments: I used brown rice for fiber and much healthier. Also added ground turkey plus Marinara sauce because I just had some leftover from spaghetti. Also added the top of the peppers chopped, thinly sliced garlic one glove. After near done I top each with some more Marinara sauce and a scoop of shredded Mexican cheese, allowing it to brown about 10 minutes for great browning. Now these were yummy.  To make em stand up I used aluminum foil making a bowl with it, works great.

I kindof made this my own, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Wonderful though! I used red, orange and yellow peppers, an uncle Ben's rice and pasta mix with beefy seasoning, italian sausage (might use ground beef next time), canned diced tomatoes (because I had them) and mushrooms. I added chopped zucchini, yellow onion and fresh garlic. Gave it a lot of substance. The idea to place them in a muffin tin sounds neat, although mine didn't fall over without the muffin tin. I mixed in and topped with mozzerella, as I didn't have feta. We loved it. Thanks! :)

I reduced the salt to 1/8 tsp and skipped the pepper.  I'm sharing this with a friend who has problems with pepper.  

The meal was delicious!  It came out just perfect.  Peppers so tender and juicy.   Use real off the vine tomato for best benefit.  

It would be as good with ground turkey or ground beef mixed in as well.  Then it would be a really balanced meal.  

Does take a while to cook, but ahh it's worth it.  AND if you don't have to share, you can encase the second one in foil to eat another day.

I made this and it’s great. I sautéed a whole onion and minced garlic. I used half beef and half ground pork. I added red pepper flake. I only cooked the peppers in the boiling water 3 minutes (the first time I made they ripped when I tried removing from Water) I  topped it with Parmesan after removing from oven.

These were really good. I only roasted the peppers for 20 minutes and I added mushrooms, that I sauteed, to the rice mixture. Also added fresh dill as I had it on hand.

I added cooked Italian sausage.  Great tasting recipe but will definitely reduce the cook time for roasting the peppers .  They were over cooked and too soft.

By all means this was a delicious one, we just started to eliminate meat out of our plate and it has been a little challenging but recepies like this one make us not miss the meat. Thanks for sharing! :D

I like it. Since my bf doesn't like tomatoes, I used canned corn instead. It was good but next time, I think I will put a little bit of sauce or something. But yeah, I think I'll do it again.

These were really great, and way faster and easier than the usual method of boiling the peppers first. I thought that they would need a sauce or maybe a crunchy topping or something, but they're pretty perfect as written.

This is a simple to make, tasty recipe. I am so glad to have found it. I made it exactly as the recipe said to do and it turned out better than I  had hoped for. This is a real keeper! It was a hit with the entire family.

Good basic recipe for a vegan stuffed pepper. The addition of feta takes it a step further--really good. 4 stars because it's too heavy on rice, but this recipe opens ideas to incorporating other veggies (i.e. diced) into the mixture. Short cut for me was to precook the rice, add rice to the  onion and tomatoes, and stuff the peppers. Next time, I'll use less rice and saute additional veggies (e.g. carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, etc.) along with the onion, and stir in tomatoes and rice. Definitely will make recipe again and incorporate other veggies to the stuffed peppers. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The recipe was good, but it honestly would have been better without the bell peppers all together. My husband and I are going to use the stuffing portion of the recipe again, but we'll probably never put it in another bell pepper.

I really liked the idea of roasting the peppers before stuffing..it made it easier to eat and more tasteful. Filling is easily adaptable with other ingredients, too.

It was really yummy. I tried it with both green and red bell peppers, and it worked great with both. I used whole grain rice and it gave it a nice texture! A nice and healthy vegetarian dish, for sure.

Made these for my vegetarian daughter. Sauteed white onion and celery. Added carrots. Used pasta sauce instead of tomatoes. Added minced garlic. Included some smoked paprika in the spices. Added a sprinkle of raw shelled hemp seeds for protein and omegas. She really liked them, but asked for no hemp seeds next time :(

Another hit. I roasted the green peppers on the outdoor grilling a pan where I also put the onions tomatoes (and I added some semi fine chopped carrots in the same pan with the olive oil. Mixed it into the cooked rice, stuffed the peppers and everyone loved it. I didn't have feta cheese so I used a small amount of finely shredded jack/cheddar cheese mix but will make sure I use the feta next time. The flavors were perfect.

Made today (2/11/2017).  I've made a few other stuffed pepper recipes, none of which called for roasting the peppers first.  I've always made stuffed peppers by slicing off the top as that makes a nice, deep cup for the stuffing.  However, I followed the instructions on this recipe and sliced them top to bottom and roasted for 25 minutes.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the bake time seemed too long--my peppers had some burn spots and also were very "floppy" (to the point of being almost flat, which made it difficult to pile on a lot of stuffing--I ended up with some left over).  

I used cheddar since I'm not a fan of feta; regular onion in place of green onion; and since I discovered my jar of Italian seasoning was empty, I used equal parts of dried oregano and powdered marjoram (the Italian seasoning label ingredients list was marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory sage, oregano, and basil).  

This was relatively easy to make.  The taste was a little odd--I think it was either the oregano or marjoram.   I probably won't make this recipe again, but if I did, I would not roast the peppers first as I didn't think that added anything to the flavor and I also would slice the top off instead of slicing in half from top to bottom.

Awesome!! I used red peppers basted with olive oil and roasted them in my toaster oven at 400 degrees until the skin was just beginning to turn black.  I filled them with a Trader Joe's rice blend that I cooked in chicken broth..  I did not add tomatoes but added 2 or 3 chopped mushrooms. Other than those changes I followed the recipe. I can't wait to make these again.

This is so good! I've made it several times with a few variations depending on what I have at home. I've substituted the fresh tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano. It turns out really yummy. I've also added spinach or mushrooms before. I always add a bit of cayenne for some heat. I save the left overs and eat it over a salad the next day (especially delicious).

So, so good. I followed the recipe exactly, but since I didn't have any Italian seasoning, I used a garlic blend that I had on hand. Next time I make it, I will omit the salt. I found the salt from the feta cheese to be enough.

The mixture isn't good to me at all. The only thing I didn't have on hand was the feta cheese. I can't eat dairy because of my intolerance , but didn't think it would effect the entire taste. The tomatoes and the rice just doesn't mesh well in this dish for me.

I love this recipe!  Very tasty. It's definitely my go to for stuffed peppers. I always make it exactly as described and haven't ever wanted to change it!

So incredibly delicious!!! I was skeptical at first about adding cheese to the rice mix, having eaten this in the past with only the regular steamed rice. And I confess I was not a big fan of this original plate to begin with, but moved by the reviews on this recipe I decided to give this plate a try again. An explosion of flavors that everyone deserves to experience. The smell alone of the rice cooking will drive you wild.

I added mushrooms because I love them. I used fresh basil from the garden and used brown rice, and Parmesan cheese because that's what I had on hand. Everyone loved them and topped with a fresh parsley it was "suitably fancy for company". 
Definitely will make them again as soon as more peppers mature in the garden.

Certainly worth doing again.  Good use of a 1/2 pack of left over feta cheese. 
These are the changes I made -- 
- red peppers not green
- put peppers in, then put normal rice on, then friend up the veg (included a green pepper). When veg was friend added to almost cooked rice. By that time the peppers were beginning to cook. Took them out of the oven, stuffed them, and returned the whole lot to the oven.
- for lack of "Itallian spice" I added more Basil, thyme, & oregano and some salt replacer.

My vegetarian hubby gave it 9/10 (he's never given a 10!).

But I did add about 1 cup of salsa/ chili sauce mixture and a tsp of sugar. It didn't have enough tomato flavour for me. I also added fresh oregano. I've made the veggie version, but tonight I added 1 lb of ground beef to make it our main course, and used a quinoa, lentil and rice mix rather than just rice. It was delicious. I also was able to stuff way more than 2 peppers, I used 5 and could probably have stuffed 7. It was one of those recipes where I kept adding a little more rice and a little more salsa, particularly since I added the ground beef, it needed more other stuff to balance it.

Loved this recipe!  Like some other reviewers I browned some hamburger and added that to ingredients with some extra tomatoes. I also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top. I actually tripled the ingredients plus the hamburger and had enough to stuff 22 half peppers. Hubby and I each had a half pepper and after the others cooled, I wrapped each in a piece of foil, put several in freezer bags and froze them.  Great way to use up the bounty of our garden.

The only changes I made were minor... Used canned tomatoes, drained and rinsed, more onion (white), and a dash of crushed red peppers. Loved that the peppers were oven-roasted first. Very pleased, will add this to my recipe box.

I had never made stuffed peppers before, and these were absolutely delicious!  I subbed brown rice for the arborio, only because that is what I had on hand.  I added sliced kalamata olives just because I like them, and omitted the salt, because I felt the feta and olives would make it salty enough.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect.   I wish I had doubled the recipe, because the two of us could have easily eaten two more of these delicious stuffed peppers!

This was a pretty dang good recipe! The rice itself wasn't super flavorful, so I added a dash of Lea & Perrin's sauce (likely that any Worcestershire sauce will do) to give it a more savory flavor and almost trick the brain into thinking there's meat in there. Either way, would make again, and make more, at that.

As a newb to cooking I found this recipe easy and well balanced in flavor. The feta cheese is nice and almost necessary addition but the seasonings mixed with the rice really create a nice savory flavor in lieu of meat.

This a favorite recipe that we enjoy on a regular basis.  I make just two changes to this recipe.  I always use red peppers rather than green, and instead of rice I use quinoa.  Everything else is "by the book."

This was an easy dish to make.  Didn't use feta cheese, but instead use Pecorino Romano cheese.  Also used regular jasmine rice and not the arborio rice.  It still turned out pretty good.

Very good and healthy. The rice mixture was flavorful and easy to make. The only problem with the meal, I thought, was the pepper taste was a little overpowering. I felt something needed to be added or use more of the rice mixture.

Very good recipe overall.  Peppers got overcooked for me- I turned off the oven at 18-20 min but left them in 5-10 more min until the filling was done and they got too soft, probably my mistake.  I didn't have enough feta and used some shredded monterey jack-cheddar mix to supplement, and also on the top.  Would be great with some extra veggies in but I skipped due to toddler.  Could be made more substantial with some protein- beans, chicken, ground beef.  Seems very flexible.  Will make again.

I loved it! The only thing I changed was the rice. Instead I used broken up pieces of bread and mixed it up with the entire meal. At first I thought it was going to be gross, but it turned out to be very exquisite in taste.

Excellent.  I used more pepper and tomatoes than called for.  Added mushrooms, used fresh not dry basil.

This was ok. Pretty bland and I added more seasoning. Next time I will play with the seasoning again.

I'm trying to cut down my meat consumption and this was one of my first vegetarian dishes, and I was blown away by it!

The flavor was great and it's very easy to make small and large changes to it to suit your flavor pallet.

The only thing I found negative about the recipe was the amount of salt. In the future I'll be using about half the recommended amount. Everything else is perfect.

I made these for myself and was not disappointed! These turned out awesome and delicious! I used red and yellow peppers, since I didn't have green peppers, which didn't make a difference I don't think. After they were finished I added some shredded cheddar on top of them which gave it an extra something that I enjoyed! Very good and filling for a vegetarian! :)

I made these for my husband and he admitted he had reservations (he has never really liked stuffed peppers).   I added ¼ cup frozen spinach to the recipe and he couldn't stop saying how these were the greatest peppers he has ever eaten.  He is also taking the remaining pepper in his lunch tomorrow!  This will be my stuffed pepper recipe from now on!  Thank you for sharing!

So I know that people don't like when others change a recipe and then rate it, but I'm one of those people that sees a recipe's potential, and often runs with it. I try to cook meatless at least once a week, and these are in my regular rotation. I've made them a few times now, and I add extra veggies, like squash, kale, spinach,mushrooms, carrots, pretty much whatever I have on hand, sautéed in a bit of EVOO. I also use marinara sauce so that these aren't dry- I mix a bit into the veggie-rice mixture, and then put a bit more on top. Not a lot, like I said, just so they are moist. I have used a variety of different types of rice and our favorite is a blend I found at Harris Teeter that is Brown Rice, Barley and Quinoa. I also use a blend of Feta and fresh Parmesan Cheese.  These are great and everyone enjoys this dish- both kids happily eating a variety of veggies and asking for seconds?!  That's a Winner in my book!

These were very flavorful, easy to make and overall good. I made these exactly as written as a main dish along with a salad. My husband & I thought they were a bit dry. Served as a main dish they really need a sauce to balance out the dryness of the rice. . I will most likely make these again, however, I may add some marinara on the bottom of the baking dish.

Excellent peppers.  I used some leftover rice pilaf I had in teh fridge and some sliced mushrooms in addition to a minced up jalapeno pepper but used the same other ingredients with a mixture of green/yellow and red peppers.  The roasting of the peppers didn't go as well as I hoped but that was probably my fault.  They were really overdone by the time I took them out of the oven so next time I'll keep a closer eye on them. Otherwise I loved these and will make them again. Reheated leftovers the next day for my lunch and they were just as good if not better.

Great recipe! Made a few changes as I stuffed the peppers with ground beef and quinoa/brown rice as well as the green onions, basil, tomatoes, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and added in some fresh minced garlic. Turned out amazing!

This way of cooking the peppers was the best that I have tried. I changed a few things and used Basmati rice with canned whole tomatoes, cut up celery including some leaves from the celery and my favorite addiction Nando's Peri-Peri. For cooking the Basmati I used one heaping tablespoon of Knorr tomato boullion with chicken flavor and a large pat of butter in the water. My bestie is a meat and potato guy and he loved these stuffed peppers! So sincerely, thank you!

This was great! I used parmesan instead of feta and loved it. I will make these again.  
I don't roast the peppers as long as it says to just because I like them to still be firm. And we don't like chunks of tomato so I threw some canned diced tomatoes in the food processor to get the tomato flavor without the chunks. I probably used about 1/3 of a can.

Love this recipe!  I had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I cooked the rice in vegetable broth (needed to use it before it went bad), substituted Parmesan/Romano/Asiago cheese mixture and added fresh parsley.  I used red bell peppers because I don't like green bell peppers.

I will definitely make this again!

This was excellent! I added regular onion and 1/2 t. fennel seed which I dry fried for a few minutes. I also added 1/2 a leftover zucchini. I also omitted the tomatoes because no one but me likes them and cooked regular brown rice in vegetable broth to give it a deeper flavor.

I recommend using a red pepper for visual appeal. I also changed the method for making the rice because arborio is a short grain rice so it is better for a risotto aproach by sweating onions , adding rice, and add chicken stock a bit at a time. I would also just cut the tip off and get rid of the seeds for more of a cup style.

This was a hit at my house! My daughter prefers this to the traditional stuffed recipe I usually use (which involves boiling the peppers, not roasting). I had canned diced tomatoes with Italian flavors on hand, so I used those in place of the freshly-diced tomato and seasonings. I also tossed in some leftover cooked chicken breast for added heft. My only problem was the same problem I always seem to have with stuffed peppers--too much filling! Maybe my peppers are too small? Definitely a new family favorite!

GREAT recipe! Missed out on tomato because it got moldy, oops! Decided to throw in mushrooms and black beans. After filling the peppers, I had some leftover. So I mad a burrito out of it and threw it in the oven with the peppers. The burrito turned out phenomenal. You could use this recipe to make burritos instead of stuffed peppers. Could go either way!

Very yummy! The cheese and rice helped pull all of the flavors together. I'm definitely going to make it again, and maybe try it with some tomato sauce drizzled on top.

Definitely a keeper. A little sweeter than I expected with all the basil. May cut back and add garlic next time, but very good and easy!

I've also added a bit of pre roasted aubergine and used brown rice. Such a good recipe, really loved it.

One of our favorites. It's quicker if you microwave the bell peppers for 7 minutes with a wet paper towel over them (open side up) and use minute rice. It still tastes great. It also tastes great using the recipe listed.

I've made this as written several times and it's easily a four star recipe.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy, tasty meal--especially if you have extra bell peppers and tomatoes around.  With a couple of adjustments, this became a five star meal for my family.  As other reviewers have said, this is a great base recipe. I add a chicken bullion cube to the water for the rice. I do as others suggest and oil/butter the bell peppers and sprinkle with lemon pepper and sea salt before roasting.  To the green onion/tomato mix I add parsley, a splash of red wine vinegar and crushed red pepper flakes (approx 1 tsp).  I usually add less salt than suggested when I make these additions.  Thank you for this great recipe, Sandy!

Delicious!  My only change next time will be a little less salt but other than that it was great!   I served with some homemade cornbread and a salad.  The recipe is super easy and full of flavor, it will definitely become a regular in my household.

Just made this for my in laws and they fell in love with it. The only thing I did different to it was add ground beef and a little less salt. The flavors complimented the dish very well. I also used 5 Minute white rice. Tasted amazing. Thanks for this recipe definitely a KEEPER. =)

Yummy! I used yellow and red bell peppers. The dish was very flavorful. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and the time for the peppers to cook to 20 minutes.

This tasted great! The rice in itself is good and could be used to compliment any dish. I browned some ground Turkey prior and added it in with the rice into the skillet. I also tried using a Poblano pepper, but I shouldve have put it in for less time, since it got overcooked and became too soft, well before the Green Pepper.

Very tasty.  Added some grated carrots and a few kidney beans.  Next time I will cut the salt in half as the feta is salty.

Absolutely delicious. Roasting the peppers gave them better taste and texture than boiling them.  I used regular onion and feta that had sundried tomatoes in it.  I will be making this again for sure!

This recipe is easy, meatless and delicious. Since I find spices to be a bit overwhelming, I use only half. I found it to be the easiest Stuffed Pepper recipe to date.

Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe.  I absolutely loved these.  I did the recipe as it was written and added some chopped mushroom that I had on hand and also used fresh basil.  I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe would allow for you to add to it as you would like.  I used a low fat feta and loved every bite. To make a little fancier appearing, I thought of doing some buttered bread crumbs on top if I wanted to serve for company.

made just a few changes. As suggested I rubbed peppers inside and out with evoo, used greek seasoning not italian. I used 3 plum tomatoes and added 2T of chopped fresh basil with them not dried and to save time used a bag of Uncle Ben's microwave long grain and wild rice.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe

Great! I just added ground beef, chopped onion and used short grain brown rice and it was wonderful. I also blanched the green peppers prior  as suggested by others. The feta really pulled it together. Would add some more tomatoes next time.

Simple and delicious!  Made this recipe with Yellow peppers and ground vegetable protein instead.  Roasting the peppers first made this recipe quicker than others and by the time the peppers were done roasting the stuffing was ready to be added.  They also were great a day later as lunch time leftovers!

This is a fantastic recipe!!!!! I added ground sausage and minced fresh garlic, I didn't have green onions so I used 1/4 of a yellow onion instead!  These are so good!!!  The feta cheese really adds a lot of flavor.  YUM!!

This was good but not as great as I had hoped after reading the reviews. I used brown rice and canned diced tomato but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The cooking time for the peppers is too long so keep an eye out. I am not sure, it just lacked flavour. My husband liked his though :)

Amazing!  The flavor is just wonderful and was a huge hit with everyone at the table!  I was surprised my kids liked it so much.  There were no left overs with this meal. Yumm.  I ended up with quite a bit of extra filling.  Next time I'll add another bell pepper.

I didn't have Arborio rice, so I used Jasmine and doubled the green onions

Delicious but too salty.  Next time I will not add salt.  The feta cheese adds enough salt.  Instead of rice, used quinoa.  Other than the excessive salt content, it would be delicious.

I loved these and they're so easy to make! The only changes I made was to season the peppers inside and out and brushed olive oil on the outside before putting them in the oven. I cooked garlic cloves with the onion. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and butter and salt. I used 6 ounces of feta instead of 4, which wound up being too much, but that was my fault. I would definately make these again.

This recipe was excellent and my family loved it. I made a couple of substitutions like switching out the rice with couscous and I used purple peppers rather than green ones. The purple peppers are very fragrant and made my house smell wonderful. I also added mild Italian sausage, Gorgonzola cheese and cayenne pepper for a little kick. I can't wait to try this recipe again! THANKS

This is a wonderful and forgiving recipe. The first time I made it Sandy's way, the 2nd time I just made the rice alone. Made a few changes ( to my own taste) just could not go wrong. Went over real big at our last club potluck.

Very tasty. I browned some ground beef with the onions, garlic, and spices. I squirted some sriracha into the tomato mix for some kick and added about 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste. I topped the peppers with some shredded cheddar cheese and voilà! A delicious supper!

This is just so odd.  I made almost this exact same recipe the day before I saw this one on allrecipes.com. I cook ground beef and add with the other ingredients.  What makes the flavors pop is the feta cheese.  I only recently started using it and find I really like the taste.

Wonderful, tasty use of seasonal veggies and herbs!  Was exactly what I was looking for tonight, and I will make this again.  Only thing I may add is garlic, but it isn't necessary.  Thanks so much, Sandy, for sharing.  Now Your Way is also My Way!

I love this recipe.  I have been making it for years - over time we have added to it - Now we don't bother roasting the peppers before stuffing and add a can of petite dices cut tomatoes - Yum!  Thanks so much Sandy!

These peppers are definitely the best i've ever had. My fiance is vegetarian and finds these to be very filling. After making this a few times we prefer to use red bell peppers for a little bit "sweeter" taste and I use a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of a fresh one. One of my favorite "go to" recipes!!

This was fairly simple to make and tasty too. I will probably decrease the amount of Italian seasoning next time. The amount called for was a bit over powering.

Very flavorful!  I doubled the recipe (except for the dried herbs, as I don't care for too many in my food), added soy crumbles for protein and cooked the rice in chicken broth.  My meat-eating husband loved it.  I'll make it again.

Ummm.. Amazing! Fresh ingredients and so good! Like other reviews we used 1 green, yellow, and red pepper. Sauteed 3 cloves of fresh garlic with the onion, half a pint of fresh mushrooms and a few leaves of fresh basil. Topped with an italian cheese blend because I had it on hand. This might be a meatless dish but you won't miss a thing!!!!!! Try it :D

Easy pepper for a weeknight meal.  I used a pizza style Italian seasoning for more zing.  And used 1/2 the salt amount.

I am in LOVE!  This is a wonderful and easy recipe that tastes great!!!  Very versatile since you could add mushrooms, garlic or your veggie of choice.  I added a small garlic close and a couple of dashes of cinnamon.  A Keeper!!

Excellent peppers, and easily adaptable to your own taste preferences. The only changes I made were swapping the green bell pepper for red ones (all I had in the fridge) and using orzo rather than arborio rice. The seasoning was nice and light, and the feta adds just the right tang. Great vegetarian supper, thanks for sharing!

This was great, for me and my husband, but my children weren't really about it.  I guess you can't fool them--they know they're eating bell peppers even if you cut them up!  I used regular rice, cooked in a rice cooker and canned diced tomatoes.  Everything else was the same, but the filling yield wasn't that large--I was left with extra pepper halves, even though I scaled correctly.  The flavor is wonderful, not at all bland, but something about my scaling didn't work  out.  I'll try it again for sure though.  The taste was worth it at least for the grown-ups!

Fantastic recipe! I normally don't go for vegetarian entrees as my boyfriend is very picky about needing some meat, but these were amazing as is. The second time i made them I threw in a little ground beef and some garlic cut back just a little on the tomatoes, they were just as good. No matter what the feta, rice, and onions were an excellent concept for combination, thank you so much for this recipe!

This was good, I would say 4 1/2.  We had it with some chicken for dinner and for left overs we had it for breakfast with a fried egg on top, which I liked better.

Delicious and light for summer!  This receipe was very easy to make with little prep time.  I did alter the recipe a little since I didn't have the extact ingredients on hand.  Instead of bell peppers, I used sweet red banana peppers and followed the instructions with a baking time of about 15 minutes.  I sauteed the 1 vidalia onion with 2 cloves of crushed garlic along with the seasoning noted in the recipe.  When the onions were tender, I added thinly cut strips of turkey breast.  Stirred this until the meat was almost done then added the tomatoes sprinkled in fresh chives and plain goat cheese.  I ended up not mixing the rice in and used it as a side dish.

Yummy! I used red pepper and yellow onion and shortened roasting time as suggested as well as adding japenese pumpkin and mushroom. These were so good I am already looking forward to making them again.

my boyfriend and i were obsessed with these for a while. i didn't add any additional salt (as another reviewer stated, the feta provides enough) and i prefer to use orange and yellow peppers because they have a sweeter flavor. it's good if you add veggie meat crumbles too (you'll probably need another pepper to fill)

Wow!  These were terrific.  My husband and I loved them.  I was a afraid of it being a little bland, so I added about a tsp or more of cracked red pepper to the tofu as it was cooking.  It added a nice zip and didn't make it too spicy at all.

Good, but needed to add an extra cup of water to cook the arborio rice all the way. Also the peppers didn't get as cooked as I like them to be after 400 degrees at 25 minutes. Typically, I cook them at 350 for 30 minutes.

This is a good recipe.  I love stuffed peppers any way, so "My Way" is already a hit.  But the key is in which spices you use.  (I didn't have italian seasoning, so I used a combination of rosemary, oregano, sage and thyme.)
I thought the proportions were just right and I can see how this will become a staple in our family, as I experiment with different combinations of spices to keep it interesting.

I thought these were great. I did make a few changes such as adding spinach and mushrooms and using mint oregano thyme and basil for the spices. My kids didn't care for them but they don't like anything. Oh and I used lots more feta.

This dish is absolutely delicious! The entire family loved it--even my non-vegetarian husband said it was by far the best stuffed peppers that he had ever eaten. I have already made it twice and will be making it often in the future. I did change it a bit and doubled the recipe. After I had assembled the dish, I covered it with a large can of tomato sauce and topped with 8 oz. of grated cheddar cheese. Yum!

Not that great. To improve it if I make it again I would cut down on the salt, Italian seasoning and basil. Less feta cheese also. Cook the peppers less. And I would use regular onions, not green. I'm thinking I won't be making this again!

This was very different and good but a little salty for me. Next time I will omit the salt or cut it by at least half. Also I agree with others that the time for the peppers was very long and so my peppers were floppy as well. I think with a couple of changes I would say 4 or 5 stars.

Pretty tasty, however, salty (and dry) for our tastes.  We followed the recipe as instructed except that we used regular rice and canned diced tomato.  Next time, we'll double the feta and omit the salt.  The kids (7 & 5)liked the rice mixture, but didn't eat the pepper skin.

This recipe was awesome.  I will definitely make it again.  I would reduce roasting time I peppers to 15-20 minutes.  I also added some shredded chicken to it.  Delish!

Yum what a great recipe!  I added the stuffing from 2 hot Italian Sausages (sauteed first until browned, like how you cook ground beef) and added that to the onion mixture.  I also added twice as much feta because I love cheese :)  It was a little strong with all the hot sausage - next time I'll only add one, but there will definitely be a next time!  The peppers were a little soft, I'd say maximum cook for 25 mins before stuffing.

These were delicious.  We used goat's cheese instead of the feta because we had it on hand and it turned out really well.  I think next time I'll experiment with bleu cheese.  Will make again!

I love love love these!  So yummy as stated, and I find that adding just under a pound of ground spicy italian sausage and some garlic to these make them perfect.  Delicious.

Very good. I used wheat rice because I couldn't find Arborio rice in our grocery store. And our cheap grocery store also didn't have feta cheese!...so I added mozzarella cheese and I added pieces of chicken breast to it. It was  preeeeetty good!

Made no modifications, and this was delicious. My husband and I aren't fans of stuffed peppers, but made them for guests, and now I think we'll have them at least once a month.

These are so yummy! I used mozzarella cheese instead of feta because I don't like feta one bit. They turned out great. My husband said this was a keeper

Excellent recipe.  Takes a little time to prepare but it's worth it.  This would be a beautiful vegetable dish for a dinner party. The only change I made is that I used munster cheese which I had on hand instead of Feta. This is a keeper....

My veggie daughter loved it. I used red and yellow peppers but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I might down the roasting time for the peppers they were a little bit softer than I like but thats just personal taste.

I really liked this recipe.  Easy to find ingredients (important if you live in a small city) and it was easy to make.

I made this recipe last night using orange peppers (don't like green) and brown rice (that's all I had). The only other change I made was to add garlic.  It was very simple to make and turned out really well.  I would definately make it again.

These peppers were tasty with the feta cheese, but we just felt they were missing something.  It was nice for a change, but we'll be sticking to our old hamburger/rice stuffed peppers.
