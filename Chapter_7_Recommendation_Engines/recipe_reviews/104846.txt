If the individual who posted the picture for this recipe had followed the directions, the sauce would have more of an orange color that comes from the buttery round crackers.  It is never white like the picture.  Also, the recipe originally called for jalapeno peppers (fresh, not pickled).  I have since found that serrano peppers work much better.  I do not seed them, just toss them in the blender.  Depending on how much heat you want, I usually use about 3 small ones.

When I could not locate my original recipe, I turned to all recipes since I knew I had posted it here.  After measuring out all ingredients as listed, I realized something was WRONG.  The quantity just did not look right.  Eventually, I found the original.  It called for 1 PINT, not 1 CUP of mayo.
We normally make it with 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of salad dressing.  I am sorry for the mistake.  I am glad those who tried it were not disappointed, but try it again using the additional mayo.  It makes it to further and will have a smoother texture.  Otherwise, for those of you who prefer it the other way, go for it !    Thanks for trying it!

Original review 2/19/06: This is it! This is the tartar sauce I have been looking for FOREVER! Ever since I was pregnant with my 1st child, and we went to Landry Seafood in Galveston, TX...I ate and ate this stuff! Thank you, thank you! I finally had all the ingredients...the green olives are the secret ingredient. Thanks so much for the post!

People need to try this. Don't let the ingredients fool you. This is great tartar sauce. I was learey at first due to olives and crackers in a tartar sauce, but it is great.  Be brave and at least try it once. I have been using this for about 1 1/2 yrs and just suprised more people haven't tried it.

There are a couple of very important items missing in this recipe.  One is anchovie paste. I don't know the amount, sorry.  The other is that the real original used a tiny pepper called a chile petin instead of jalepenos or serranos.  The last comment is that the real product takes on a light beige color rather than being so white, so I feel the amount of Ritz crackers may be off slightly.  The consistency is very thick and 'spreadable' rather than easily dippable.  Once you try it, you will remember the taste and texture forever and will, as I have, try to reproduce it, unsuccesfully.

I just whipped this up for tomorrow's fish and my family will not stop eating it!  It's so yummy and so different with a spicy kick. It's very good on crackers
I didn't have saltines so I used all buttery crackers. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for a winner.

Very very good!  A little more complex than some recipes, so not as easy to whip up as some recipes.  Big deal?  Sort of, after a long day of fishing.  

Nevertheless, I think it is a worthwhile endeavor for the taste, which is unique (in a good way), and sure to get + comments at your next fish fry.

The recipe is good, but I think it is better eaten fresh rather than 24 hours later, I used my home canned jalepenos, home made relish, and home made mayo which I add lime to. The picture is way off as to what it really looks like when finished.

This is very easy, and good enough to eat as a dip for crackers.  It's also very good with fish sticks I cooked to get them out of the freezer!  I'm not fond of jalapenos so I put in only a tablespoon, and added a bit more olives to compensate.  I used dried onion, so used less.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW...this is REALLY good! I wanted something more than just mayo mixed with relish and this fit the bill perfectly. I can't believe how good this is, seriously! This will be my new 'go-to' tartar sauce! Thanks for sharing. :)

Turned out good, didn’t have curry but mixed cumin, coriander and nutmeg instead. Also Lowery’s seasoned salt worked better.

So we had some the same night and the onions were very strong but it was still really good. Then I just had some the next day and the onion flavor have mellowed quite a bit and it really tastes like the Costco artichoke dip without the artichokes.It has that full body texture it’s really quite good on crackers

Awesome tartar sauce and a huge hit at a family dinner event! We questioned a full cup of sweet relish, cut the amount to 2 table spoons, and loved the result. Also used fresh 1/2 a jalepenos without seeds but it needed much more spice to really work. I'll try doubling next time and leaving the seeds in.

I don't comment on the recipes I find on here much...but I loved this one!  The ingredient list seemed strange but after reading the comments I thought I would try.  Didn't change a thing other than a few extra peppers.
