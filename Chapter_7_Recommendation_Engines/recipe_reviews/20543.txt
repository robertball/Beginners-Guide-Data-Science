Mmmmmmm. I wish I was still sipping this... I reduced the amount of pineapple juice to about 10 ounces, otherwise the taste of pineapple would have dominated the drink. I also added 12 ice cubes to give it a more smoothie-ish feel. I used one frozen and one fresh banana. It was grrrrrreat! :)

This was quite tasty. Very light, very exotic, and it scaled very well. It also made lots of room for adjustments--I didn't have as much pineapple juice as called for, and I used a frozen banana, and it still tasted very good. My father loved it.

Very Yummy!  I added 1 oz of rum and a slice of pineapple on top.  I've never been to Hawaii but this was close.  Thanks.

Tasty!  I doubled the coconut milk because the pineapple overpowered it a bit.  Added a some ice cubes as well.

Very good! I doubled up on the coconut milk, replaced the sugar w/ simple syrup (upped it to 2 tbp.) & hit it w/ a lg. shot of white rum (although this particular drink may benefit from a rum taste so next time I will try Bacardi Gold instead). I garnished w/ a marashino cherry & pineapple wedge.

Too much pineapple juice.  I doubled the coconut milk and could still barely taste the coconut.  I also like a thicker drink so I added ice.  I will also add yogurt next time to make it more smoothie like.

I mixed and matched this recipe and made it rather my own. I used less pineapple juice, more coconut, added some ice, and added a bit more banana / sugar. (The bananas weren't very ripe, so it was a little bitter.)  Delicious! And easy. =) Thanks for sharing.

Very nice drink, although I used pineapple/mango juice instead. Only because our store had a special sale on it.

We used fresh pineapple. recommend adding more coconut. Not bad, but wasn't perfect. Not sure what else I would add though.

It was very yummy. I didn't totally follow the recipe, but chose to wing it with the ingrediants. It still worked.

Not bad! Basically tastes like spruced up pineapple juice, but it's a great way to get lots of fruit into your day. Used Splenda instead of sugar with no problems.

I did not have coconut milk, but I did have coconut flavoring. I used whole milk and just a little coconut flavoring. I used frozen bananas, too, to make a thicker smoothie. It was okay.

This was a great drink, but we tried it a second time and we froze the pineapple juice with rum in it. We also froze the banana in chunks.  Then we whirred all the ingredients in the blender and it was creamy smooth.  The only thing missing was the coconut shell glass and the umbrella garnish.

Delightful!!  We used cream of coconut in lieu  of the coconut milk and sugar; also added pineapple sherbet and ice to give it a smoothie texture.  (I probably wouldn't have used the ice if I had time to freeze the banana.)  Add rum or spiced rum for a grown-up version.  Will definitely serve this again and again!

A little weird. I added rum, which made it a bit better.
