Delish!! All you other AR review-readers might think I'm crazy, but this is the first time I've ever actually made rice krispie squares; love to eat 'em, but never actually made them. I came across this recipe on a hot summer day. Craving something sweet and not wanting to heat up the whole house was my motivation to try this.  I actually used the Multi-grain Rice Krispies (to make me feel better about the lack of nutritional value, and to add a little extra fiber) and Craisins (because that's what I had). But they turned out spectacular. Good twist on an old favourite!

Nothing takes me back to my childhood like rice kripsy treats and I never thought to tamper with a classic until this recipe, but these are wonderful and what I really like is that the add-ins don't detract from the original. You still taste and feel the crunch of the rice cereal and feel the stickiness of the marshmellow, it's just a grown-up version... although my kids loved them.

Okay, the nine cups of cereal to one package of marshmallows seemed really off to me, since I usually do about six cups to one bag of marshmallows. Plus, how on earth does that fit in an 8x8 pan?! Please tell me if I'm missing something. Are they intended to be super super crunchy? Anyway I made these with six cups of cereal for a 9x13 pan and they tasted really good. How could I not have thought to add cinnamon and raisins to rice krispie treats before? It's like an awesome, thick granola bar!

As written this recipe would not work.  There is no way 9 cups of cereal are going to fit in an 8x8 pan.  However, the additional ingredients do perk up a regular pan of rice krispie treats.  I made my usual treat recipe (5 cups of cereal, 5 T butter, & one pkg of mini marshmallows).  I added the cinnamon in with the marshmallows to make sure it incorporated through.  I then added the cereal, almonds, and dried cherries (dd hates raisins) and pressed into an 9x13 pan.  Very good flavor and a nice change of pace.  Thank you for sharing.

Bf loved these--I gave him one and then he kept going back for more.  I made these for a friend's dad, actually, so he kept going into the bag for them!  I didn't use rice krispies but used multi grain cheerios, and stopped adding cheerios when it got really hard to mix.  Otherwise, though, I left it the same.  I've only ever made rice krispie type treats one other time, and now I remember why!  I hate mixing the stuff, but this was a nice little treat.  I did end up using 2 8x8 pans--I couldn't quite get it all into one pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of rice cereal I used Cinnamon Burst Cheerios and omitted the cinnamon. Also omitted nuts. These were a nice change of pace from the usual krispie treats. TFS

WOW! Yummy! I used 6 cups of Rice Krispies and about 1/2 cup of craisins instead of raisins and 1 1/2 T. cinnamon. I will make these over and over again! Oh.....and you HAVE TO use a 9x13 pan!!

This is truly delicious.  Used "normal" recipe for krispy treats (3 TB butter, 10 oz marshmallows and 6 cups krispys).  Added Trader Joe's toasted slivered almonds (toasted almonds have even greater flavor) and raisins.  Can't believe I didn't think of this!
