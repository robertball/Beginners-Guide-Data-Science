This is a good, easy, and kid-approved dinner.  The first time I made this, I prepared it just as the recipe states, but the bacon was soggy and it kind of grossed me out.  So the next time I made it, I cooked the bacon first, then drained out all grease but about a 1/2 tablespoon, and then sauteed my onion and beef.  The bacon was crispy and the meat had a great bacon flavor.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can try so many flavors - taco meat with mexican-blend cheese; hamburger, diced pepperoni, mozzerella and pizza sauce; chicken, garlic, basil, mushrooms, diced tomatoes and cheese . . .whatever!

This is a no brainer! Very quick and easy to make. I made it without the bacon, added salt and pepper to taste and a can of Campbell's chedder cheese instead of velveeta. It was a hit!

Huge family hit!  I like the others' suggestion to cook the bacon separately first.  I used turkey bacon and it was yummy. Velveeta grosses me out, so I just used about a cup or cup and a half of shredded cheddar and jack.  The kids keep asking me to make it again!

Everyone at my house loved this! I did make some changes. I added 1/2 package of Ranch dressing mix to the meat while I stirred in the Velveeta. Also, I omitted the onions. There was no need for ketchup! It was delicious! One suggestion, if using the Pillsbury Pizza Crust, keep an eye on it! It was done after 15 minutes!

What a fun comfot food for the kids.  It was a chilly rainy day here.  I gut it up and put sme BBQ Sauce on the side so they had fun kinda dipping it.  I only changed a couple things i made my bacon first so it was good and crisp.  I also didnt use the velveeta cheese i just shredded what I had and know the kids like.  Thanks

This recipe seems like every day food--but offers up variety to the same old hamburgers and hotdogs. It's simple, easy to prepare, and a recipe that most adults and kids will enjoy. Including a quick trip to the store, I had this ready to go in a little more than an hour.  The trickiest part is rolling out the dough. Do note, the dimensions of the dough don't have to be perfect, but do leave an inch of space between the meat mixture and edge of the dough. I learned that from the video for this recipe, and it is good advice.  My wife doesn't like bacon or onion, so I made one without those ingredients--and another for my son and me. I brushed egg white over the dough for a nice, golden brown finish.  Obviously, this is not gourmet fare, but for what it is, it is great!

I used chicken (canned, to save time) instead of hamburger. My family absolutely loved it!!!! This might end up being a weekly meal.  Very quick and easy to make.

Very good, simple recipe. Made it on a weeknight after work. Tasted great.   I did add half a can of diced tomatoes. The best part was the fact that my picky 18 month old who isnt a meat fan gobbled it up. I let her dip it in ketchup. I will make this again!!!

My kids went crazy for this.  Even my finicky son who has to get his arm twisted to even try most foods took one bite and then promptly begged me to make it again tomorrow.  It's easy, it's versatile, and I'm excited about finding a new way to get protein into my carb loving kid, lol.

This was just okay. It had a good taste, but after following the instuctions to a tee and rolling it up, it looked like I'd shaped the beef into a tube and covered it with the dough....we couldn't see the dough inside the roll once it was cooked. Weird. I'd make it again, but it won't be on my favorites list. It IS a very kid-friendly recipe, though. My 15 mo. old went nuts over it.

Very good. My family enjoyed it. I added mushrooms. Very easy to make! I think next time I will make a special sauce to dip it in.

Instead of Velveeta, used real cheese and some leftover condensed cheddar cheese soup. Family loved it.

These were really good! I used Mexican Velveeta Cheese because that's all I had, it tasted fine. I also used bacon crumbles that I bought at the store. This is an easy meal that I will probably make again.

I found this recipe in a Kraft food fun magazine and have been making it for a while now. It's always a big hit and a regular request. None of us really like onions too much so instead I flavor the hamburger with worcestershire and onion powder during browning and I subsitute bell pepper instead of onion. So delicious!!

My 12yr old son is the pickiest of eaters and he RAVED about this one! That rarely happens, so I would have to say this recipe is a keeper! Not only does it taste good, but it is very filling. I think this is a healthier option than a regular bacon cheeseburger because it has less bread than a burger, and the cheese and meat are spread out farther. I have hearty eaters and still had some leftovers of this after feeding a family of 4,not much but there were SOME. LOL My 9yr old even said she wanted some as an afternoon snack tomorrow!
The only variation I made to it was I sprayed the top of the pizza crust with a cooking spray and sprinkled with parmesan cheese before adding the meat/cheese mixture. ENJOY!

So easy and so many possible variations. I made some as written and others for breakfast roll ups with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese. I have made similar sandwiches with frozen bread dough and found that the pizza dough holds together better when baking. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a crowd pleaser, even my 5 year old loved it.  I did however use shredded cheese instead of velvetta and added mushrooms on one half for the adults and it was execellent.  Next time I'm going to try swiss cheese with the onions and mushrooms.

Husband would give it a 5, I would give it a 3 so I split the difference with 4.  Made it exactly as said and thought it was a bit dry...however I didn't have any velveeta and used shredded cheese so that could have been my problem!

I wanted to give this more than 3 stars...and it was good as soon as it came out of the oven.  But after eating a couple, they seemed to sit "heavy" in my stomach and the remainder got thrown out.

kid friendly and very easy--a break from the regular and fancy looking too!

One of my husband's new favorites! I used a can of cheddar cheese soup because I had it on hand. I also used precooked bacon crumbles because, once again, they were handy.

My husband and kids LOVED this recipe- and they are very picky.  I thought it was very good too although not a low-fat food.  

I followed other's suggestions of pre-cooking the bacon.  I didn't want to run to the grocery store so I just used my own recipe for fresh dough instead of the refridgerated kind.  That probably is what made this a 5 star instead of 4 but it was easy to do. By the time the filling was done, my dough had risen enough to roll out and roll up.  I also used real cheese instead of the Velveeta.

My family said they could eat this once a week (their highest rating).  Doesn't mean I'll make it that often- just that they wouldn't mind if I did.

My boyfriend really loved this one. I thought it was prety good, too, but it needed something to give it a little kick. I dipped it in mustard and ketchup, which made it a little better.

This was great! I did not use the bacon or onions but instead added taco season after browning the hamburger which made it a little spicy.
