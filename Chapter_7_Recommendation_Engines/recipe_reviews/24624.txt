Alright, everyone agrees that it's better with beer.  This is the version I've been using:

INGREDIENTS
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup flour
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp. dry mustard
1 bottle (12 oz.) beer
3 cups old Canadian Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 Baguette, cubed; each cube with crust

INSTRUCTIONS
In saucepan, melt butter; blend in flour, Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Gradually stir in beer; stir until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat; add cheese, stir until melted. Transfer to fondue pot; place over low heat. Serve with bread cubes.

This recipe makes less so you can have it for two, and it tastes better because it uses beer.  The older the cheddar the better the results.  Add a few drops of lemon juice to help it melt.

We halved the recipe and used beer in place of the milk. Added a few extra cloves of garlic and  tossed the cheese w/ the flour and then added it to the liquid ingredients.  It was fantastic. I did remind me of the Melting Pot's cheddar fondue.  I'm definately making it again.  We served it  w/ bread, green apple and cauliflower. 
I didn't rate it a 5 because with out substituting beer for the milk this would have been very bland.

Before adding the shredded cheese, I highly recommend mixing it with a little flour.  This helps the texture a lot. Also, reducing milk base by 1/2 and substituting a white wine or light beer works very nicely to liven this up.

This was a big hit, even with picky adult eaters! I followed some of the other advice and used 1 cup beer and 1 cup milk and mixed the flour with the cheese before adding it. the consistency was great! I will make this again and again!

This cheese fondue was wonderful and so seasy to make.  Tastes very similar to the cheese fondue I've had a the "Melting Pot" a national chain of fondue restaurants.  I'll make this one again for sure.  Try it with french bread. yummmmmm

This was really good! I used half and half and added a little more garlic. I'm glad I finally found a fondue recipe w/o alcohol (I'm not 21 yet)! I will make this again, for sure. By The Way: We had left overs (there's only 2 of us) and they tasted just as great when we re-heated them!

I made a half recipe of this and it turned out fairly well.  I have made fondue only once before and it came out stringy.  After reading up on fondue, I found out that adding a little lemon juice can help it come together, riper cheese works better (so sharp over mild cheddar), flour should be added to the cheese and in the end a little corn starch can be added to help it come together. I did all of these and it did come together in the end.  I also used half beer instead of only milk, and it gave it a wonderful flavor.

I tried this for Thanksgiving and it went over well, however, I only used 3 cups of cheese, 3/4 cup of milk and 1 cup of beer. I added more worsterchire sauce and mustard for extra zing. I also tossed the cheese  with flour prior to melting and it was smooth as can be. We dipped granny snith apples, and pumperniclke bread. Very yummy.

Very good. I halved the recipe since it was just for me and my hubby, it was more than plenty. I usually make a white cheese fondue so this was a nice change and easy!  Suggestion- if you use flour you are chancing it not being smooth. Sometimes flour clumps or gets gritty. My advice, I got this from all my other fondue recipes and did do it for this one, use cornstarch instead of flour. Use the same amount the same way you use the flour or you may coat the cheese with it and then add it to the liquid. Cornstarch doesn't clump and breaks down better than flour.

I guess I made too much...  There's 2 of us and I made 32 servings figuring one serving was one dip of bread in the fondue pot.  Well, I'm new to this fondu-ae thing, and didn't realize that you probably need at the very most 8 per person before you're more than really getting sick of it.  
Anyway, so I felt bad throwing it away, but after trying to persuade the cat, he wouldn't eat it either, so I threw the rest away.  Overall though it is a good tasting recipe.. just don't be fooled about how much of it you think you can actually eat!...

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the ground mustard since I was out of it, and I tossed the shredded cheese with some flour as recommended by another review . It turned out perfectly, and the entire batch fit perfectly into my 2 quart mini crock pot, on "LOW", where it stayed the perfect temp for our dinner. The kids loved dipping all sorts of fun veggies in the yummy fondue, and I loved how fast and easy it was to throw together. Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe, this is a keeper!

Delicious! Dipped bread, broccoli, and mushrooms with great results. Perfect fondue!
I'd only ever had Gruyere-based fondues that use wine/alcohol. They are tasty, but not everyone likes the flavour left over by the spirits/wine. This alternative was a big hit all round!
Made with a really good quality, aged cheddar. I highly recommend trying this recipe the next time you're thinking fondue. I would especially recommend this recipe to first-time fondue-ers.
Thank you, thank you for the great recipe!

I used 1 cup of half & half, and 1 cup of stella artoir beer instead of 2 cups of milk. also, used 1 tbs of flour and 2 tbs of cornstarch to coat the cheese. I first mixed everything in a pot then on the electric fondue. All I needed to do was turn up the heat and add more beer to loosen the cheese up. It was a hit at a baby shower this weekend and for a girls lunch!!! I also added some left over cheese I had...smoked gouda and mozzarella the 2nd time I made it. We dipped, bread, mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, green apple slices and pretzels!

Big hit! This is what I did.. 1 cup of dark beer ( I used black and tan) and 1 cup of milk. I was so worried after reading other reviews that this wasn't going to turn out but it was great! Will definatly be making again. i served this with carrots, sourdough bread and granny smith apples. Tasted just like The Melting Pot.  Thanks!

I halved this recipe and found that it needed a bit more milk to have a fondue like texture.  I also substituted the garlic cloves for garlic and onion powder, and added two slices of swiss cheese and a splash of beer.  I served it with pieces of french bread and we really enjoyed this meal.

I can't imagine eating this with milk. I used the same amount of beer, which came out to about one and a half bottles of beer.  I just used some cheap Michelob Ultra (leftover from our wedding lol), and it tasted perfect.  Huge hit at work.  Also, I didn't use a saucepan.  I just did everything in the fondue pot.  No need for that extra step.

Really good flavor. I followed the other reviews and added some beer for flavor as well. I used this in a fondue fountain, but it turned solid after  an hour. Any ideas on how to keep it creamy & moving?

I've always been curious to try fondue and this was my first shot. Following other reviewers I used half milk, half beer (all milk would have been bland) and cut the cheese to four cups. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce. It was robust and delicious.

Very easy to make.  I made this for New Years Eve. Stick to the recipe even though it doesn't look enough. I made the mistake to doubled it but I shouldn't have because there was so much left over.

This was good. Served it at a baby shower. All though it did kind of taste just a little off for me. Oh well, it's prpbably just me.

Switched the milk for a light beer and coated the shredded cheese in flour.  We made the fondue in an electric fondue pot following the directions, and served with a baguette, apples, carrots and broccoli!  Yummy - will definitely make again and again!

I was looking for a fondue recipe to try out my new fondue kit, and found a couple 5 star recipes but the cheeses were quite expensive.  Then I found this one which is much less expensive and decided to try it.    It met my expectations overall.  I personally was not crazy about the flavor, which seemed really cheddary and not at all like swiss fondues that I have had.  However, I got tons of complements from other guests at the party, who thought it was delicious and were excited to hear that the main ingredients were cheddar and beer.    So, if you are looking for an authentic fondue recipe to impress your foodie friends, this is probably not the one - but if you are going to bring it to an ugly sweater party and eat it alongside stew and 3 buck chuck, you will be pleased with the results.

I LOVED this cheese fondue! My boyfriend wasn't very excited about making a "cheddar cheese" fondue as we generally make or order fancier (and pricier)cheese fondues, but we were both pleasantly surprised. We made this with a bottle of kileans irish red beer and plain shredded sharp cheddar. Soooo good. We're making it again for Valentines day!

Very good! Most cheese fondues call for such expensive cheese, so this is a nice, cheaper alternative. I use 1/2 milk and 1/2 beer (the darker beer the better!). I also add a bit more Worchestershire sauce because I love the flavor. Good stuff! This recipe does make a lot - I usually halve it and it's more than enough for an appetizer for 4 people, with some leftovers too.

I followed recommedations to substitute beer for milk.  Since I did that, I would rate this a 5/5!  It was unbelievable!  I will definitely make it again, but highly recommend the beer.  I took the beer and added enough milk to make 2 cups of liquid.

As written, I thought this was rather bland. I ended up adding a splash of white wine, Gruyere cheese, and ground black pepper. The tip about tossing the grated cheese in flour was really helpful - the texture wasn't grainy at all. Thanks!

We went to a wine tasting party last night and my "bff" and I decided to make a couple of types of fondue. This went over really well, except that we scrapped the milk and used beer instead. Delicious Katherine!

It's easy enough, and I really liked the flavor, but not quite as smooth as a fondue should be.  I suggest substituting Swiss for a cup or two of the cheddar to gove it a better texture.

Came across this recipe by googling "simple fondue". This was a project for my 14 year old's French Class. I was encouraged by the reviews that stated that it would reheat well and it did! Made the night before, refrigerated and sent it in to school with him. I got 3 text messages from him that said "everyone loves it", then "my class is hovering around it" then "the bread is gone." So, it's a hit with the middle school set. I gave it 3 stars because I believe that either the mustard or the worcestershire sauce was causing the milk to curdle. On the 2nd try, I did not stir in the mustard, worcestershire or garlic until the milk and flour had almost come to a boil. Then I pulled it off the heat and added those ingredients before the cheese. Worked fine that time.

Fondue purists will hate me, but I read this all milk recipe and immediately though - mac n' cheese. It added 1 extra clove of garlic and mixed the fondue into cooked pasta and it was delicious. One thing to note, if you use pre-shredded cheese, you may need to cut back on the flour slightly since it already has a little flour on it to keep it from sticking together. The fondue tasted great, but a little on the thick side. I'll try this again with beer as other suggested, and I'll even use it the way it was intended :)

I am not sure what I did wrong, but this did not taste good after being allowed to sit.  I followed the recipe except added fat free cream instead of skim milk (which were my only choices).  I will try again and use a different type of milk.

For smooth cheese, pre-flour shredded cheese before melting. I works wonderfully. Tip I learned while working for a national fondue resturant.

This is a great basic fondue recipe. Meaning...it's flexible. I've made it several times now, following the basic liquid to flavor suggestions, but improvising and it keeps getting better and better. I replaced all the milk with (dark)beer - it made it especially tart, but yum. Tonight 1/2 milk 1/2 vermouth. Best yet! Also crushed 3 heads of garlic into it, rubbed the fondue dish with garlic, and added a bit of lemon juice to help melt the cheeses smoothly. (Learned that here - Thanks All!) I have used different cheeses. Tonight with the vermouth was cheap store brand swiss and a jalepano montery jack. I have never used 100% cheddar in any of these attempts, sorry i don't have good feedback there. Served over all these times with, bread (old pumpernickel was the best), little turkey meatballs, steamed broccoli, asparagus, and green apples.  Worchestire and dry mustard makes it and should be to taste...

This recipe can also go in the freezer.  Just let thaw completley and then reheat.  I also added 1 tsp of liquid smoke, 3 cloes of garlic and double the dry mustard.  It was a big hit!

The flavor was okay but I did not like the consistency.  I have made fondue before which turned out perfect.  It coated the bread and veggies.  This didn't coat it just ran off.  It also was not smooth like the other fondue.  Sorry but this is a no for me.

We had this at a party with two other fondues.  This one was the least popular, most people thought it was on the bland side.  I thought the taste was pretty good, but the consistency was odd.  It did not blend or thicken as nicely as the other fondues.  Also, it did not coat the "dippers" very well, a little too thin.  This fondue did get a little better the longer it was heated.  It had to be stirred frequently or the ingredients would start seperating. I probally won't try try this again, because it required to much attention.

I followed the recipe exactly, but my guests stayed away from this fondue in droves. My fondue forks were instead used for the cocktail meatballs next to the fondue!

I will use a different recipe next time.

This recipe is basic and beautiful. It is also infinitely adjustable to taste using white wine, beer, cream, etc. You can use any mixture of cheeses in place of the cheddar. You can also substitute cornstarch for the flour. Or tapioca starch if you have wheat or corn allergies.

I tried this with 1 c beer and 1 c milk as most suggested.  It is pretty good but I still think mine is better.  I didn't care for the mustard, and I prefer to use half & half instead of milk, and white wine or sherry instead of beer.  Only about 1 cup half & half and 1/3 cup wine or sherry.  You can also use skim milk for mine in a pinch.  I'm not sure how I feel about the Worcestershire sauce yet.  I prefer mine nice and garlicky.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and did 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of beer (We had Sam Adams Oktoberfest on hand.) It was delicious. We dipped french bread, apples, and veggies. We followed the rest of the recipe precisely with the exception of the ground mustard because I didn't have any.

Use beer instead of milk!  Surprise: We accidently made more than we could eat, and it tastes just as good microwaved the next day after spending the night in the refrigerator.

My only complaint with the recipe was that it didn't say why type of cheddar to use. I use sharp or extra sharp and it had a good flavor. Will definitely make again

I tried with beer as others suggested.  I don't think I liked the beer.  You could definitely taste it - and I do like to drink beer, just didn't like the taste in the fondue.  Will try again without.

This recipe was pretty good, but a little bland. I'm going to try a combo of cheeses next time I make it. I think part of the problem was that I only used sharp cheddar, so it was kind of pungy. Overall, easy recipe, small list of ingred. and a fun new years eve activity. I would make it again, but just doctor the recipe up to my own taste.

I agree, this tasted just like the Melting Pot's cheddar fondue. You need to substitute beer for the milk though. We made 16 servings and it was perfect for 2 people as an appetizer. We will make this again soon!!

I thought this was good, had all ingreds. on hand. Cut the recipe down to 1/3. I used skim milk and a variety of cheeses that we wanted to use up-most was grated mild cheddar and a few slices of swiss, provolone and sharp cheddar to equal 2 cups. My 5 yr old loved it and was dipping fresh veggies(mushrooms, scallions, pepper strips, celery) like crazy- needless to say, I will make again.

Overall, this is pretty good.  I did use beer instead and it was great.  My husband loved it.  I actually made it valentines day, I just noticed I hadn't rated it.  I made it with the chocolate bar fondue.  Good recipe to build on!

Never did fondue before, made it with half beer and half milk. Added the flour with the cheese and used sharp cheese. For a first timer.. I thought it was pretty good. I added a bit of cayanne sauce. It was all gone by the end of the night. I would make it again.

eh- i've made better.  It wasn't the traditional fondue I was used to.  I kind of like a drier taste.  Chedder is just too much, and you can't really spruce it up with wine.

Tasted good, but I didn't follow other reviewers advice and toss the cheese with flour - and I had a mealy-grit like consistency!  (I'm sure it's the cooks fault, not the recipe!)  I did sub half the milk for beer and used half sharp cheddar and half a blend of white cheeses (Italian blend maybe?)  Will make again, b/c I love fondue!!

Easy to make and mild flavor.  I used it for my little ones to eat with dippers.  They loved it.  And my husband played clean-up.  Lacks the bite of fondue with alcohol in it, but it worked for my little crew.

I tried all beer instead of milk and it had a bit of a bite. Next time I will use half beer and half milk. I followed other reviewer's suggestion about coating shredded cheese with flour. The tip works well. The floured cheese blended into the liquids perfectly and without a problem.

Not impressed, I used half beer and half milk as suggested by other reviewers. The mixture was far to soupy and the cheese melted and stayed in a big ball, not as smooth as I'd hope it would be.

I Loved this recipe! It was my first time making and eating fondue.  It was wonderful. My husband loved it also.  I didn't have Cheddard so i used Colby-jack, and I didn't have wine so i just left it out.  I also put the flour with the chees before melting it, and it worked great.  We dipped Asparagus, French Bread, and Steak. Will Definetly make it again.

This recipe is awesome, better than the Melting Pot in my opinion.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1 garlic clove, 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/2 cup of Amberbock.  As other users had suggested I coated the cheese with flour and then added it to the liquid.  I added the milk, beer and worcestershire and after it heated up a little bit, the milk curdled.  This did not affect the taste or texture of the fondue.  More than enough for two people. I used garlic sourdough bread and granny smith apples to dip in the fondue.  Yumm

Very basic cheddar fondue.  Based on other reviews I substitued beer for milk (1 Becks beer, and 1/4 cup milk) and it had a GREAT beer/cheese flavor.  It was kinda lumpy...but, my party had already started, and I was rushing, so it may have been my fault for the lumps!  I also added a lot more cheese, it seemed to runny (once again, could have been something I did wrong) It wasn't MY favorite, but, it was voted #1 out of 3 of my fondues by several guests at my party.  I think it would be really good to dip hot dogs or soft pretzles in too!   I'll make it again for sure!

Cheddar is notorious for being lumpy when melted,  but this worked out really well for my family.  I added extra garlic,  even though I halved the recipe.  I think I'll try fontina cheese next time.

Almost better than the Melting Pot. Great fondue. We dip apples, bread and cauliflower. We do this at least once a month.

This just didn't work out for us and the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1 is because I'm concerned that maybe I didn't something wrong in preparing it.  My cheese melted but it just didn't mix all the way with the rest of the sauce.  I had to pour some liquid off to get it a decent consistency.  I substituted 1/2 of the milk with beer.  What was left was just somewhat bland.  I did want a recipe that was somewhat simple because I wanted my 4 year old to eat it but she wasn't interested at all.  We ate it but it wasn't something I'd make again.

This fondue went over terrifically at my martini party.  I did substitute the milk for beer, and made 1.5 of the recipe.  I kept the fondue in a chafing dish, which seemed to work just fine, and served with cubes of rye and sourdough bread, apples and vegies.  Yum yum!  Will use again.

This was delicious! I substituted beer for the milk, and it tasted just like the Melting Pot's cheddar fondue. One word of advice: This makes a lot of cheese, so try cutting it in half if you are only serving a small group.

Excellent, simple & tasty.  Can't find anything wrong other than I didn't make enough.This is worth 5 stars for the simplicity alone.  The best bonus is that I always have these cheap ingredients on hand, unlike other recipes with loads of ingredients.

Easy, tasty recipe. Made it for teens and they like it. I followed the recipe except I rubbed the fondue pot with the garlic, rather than put the garlic directly in the recipe. If you like a tangier sauce, add some tabasco sauce. I wasn't sure about the consistency. It looked a little odd, but it was easy to dip the bread cubes in and get them coated. I have had fondues that didn't want to stick to the bread. I was glad this one worked well.

I found that the fondue tasted even better with a few drops of tabasco!  I also found that using the full amount of milk suggested left the dip a little too runny for me and adding flour wasn't an option since the fondue takes on that chalky taste.  A little less milk and some tabasco and it's perfect!

Great fondue! It's easy to make. We use this for nachos or just dipping cooked broccoli, carrots, and bread into. It makes a lot and doesn't heat up very well because it separates so we make a batch just big enough for us to eat right away.

Made this fondue for a girls night - everyone loved it! I used the suggested modification of decreasing the milk and adding beer. I had a lot left over and made it into a yummy breakfast casserole for the next morning. To make the breakfast casserole I melted the left over fondue, added more milk, eggs, and browned sausage, then poured it over sourdough bread cubes (also left over from my party). I refrigerated the casserole over night, then topped with shredded cheddar cheese and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.

I followed the directions exactly, except added 1 cup milk and 1 cup beer.  The cheese just clumped together, and never blended with the liquid.

So simple and so tasty. To make sure the flour didn't lump, I melted a small amount of butter before adding the other ingredients. Also added some buttermilk and pepper.

Great low-budget recipe!!!! I followed the revision that used 1 bottle of beer (used Firestone Double Barrel Ale), and just used cheap Costco Kirkland brand sharp cheddar and it was very tasty for a inexpensive Valentine's Dinner.  Cut french bread cubes, green apple, carrots, celery.  Granted, the cheddar tastes much different than using the normal swiss/french cheese recipe, but the flavor from the beer made it suprisingly good.

This was marvelous!!!  I did follow the suggestions of others and substituted one of the cups of milk with a light beer.  I did have trouble with the cheese clumping, but the flavor was awsome.  I will make this again and try some of the other suggesstions for fondue, such as tossing the cheese with a little flour and using a little lemon juice.  I can't wait to have this again.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I had to use a bit more flour (used sauce thickening flour) to get it to a thicker consistency.  But, overall an easy, kid-friendly fondue.

It didn't taste that good at all. I tried to adjust it a little bit and add the beer that everyone has bin suggesting to do and it still didn't turn out. Next time i will not put in the dry mustard cause i think that's what made it not so tasty.

I use a similar recipe that always comes out perfect. Instead of milk, I use beer, and I use half cheddar cheese and half swiss. I have never used flour, but I may try it sometime. We dip bread cubes, chicken apple sausage, raw califlower and apples. My husband requests this all the time!

I was not impressed with this fondue. I wanted something basic but creamy. It came out grainy and not smooth. My husband told me to just toss the leftovers, a first for him.

I followed some of the reviews and used beer (a bottle and a half) in place of the milk.  We also used a combo of cheddar, colby, jack, and mozzarella cheeses since that's what we had on hand.  I think the cheeses we used made it a bit stringy but all in all it was pretty good for our first attempt at fondue.  I plan to use this recipe again, following the recipe and using milk and cheddar...I will also half the recipe since it made way too much for our dinner party of four.  This is a great recipe with on hand ingredients, thanks for posting!

We enjoyed this recipe.  We dipped chips, bread, pear, apples, ham, and carrots.  It was a great new recipe.  Thanks for the suggestion of the beer, I will try it next time.

This dish was pretty good, but my husband and kids and I agreed, you just can't eat too much of it at one sitting. It's very salty, for one thing, and it just kind of gets old quick. Good thing I halved the recipe! (And I still had leftovers.)

While this tasted great (it was a hit at my party!), I found the texture too grainy. This was my first time making cheddar cheese fondue, so maybe it was my fault, but I liked it enough to try again sometime! This went great with rosemary potato bread, sourdough bread, and fresh veggies!!

LOVED the flavor of this simple recipe!  Both the kids and the adults enjoyed the fondue.  Made quite a bit - ran out of bread well before we ran out of the fondue!

If you want warm, watered down cheese this is the recipe.  I made it as per instructions with the beer substitution.  When I tasted it I gagged.  It had NO flavor.  I ended up adding cayenne pepper, Tony Checheres, and various other stuff to give it a flavor but it was still barely edible.  This was HORRIBLE!!  Thank god I didnt make it for a party-I would have been really embarassed.

I left this with my husband to make... and he added white wine instead of beer (as previous reviewers had had success with).  The flavor was very good - but it was really watery with a large lump of cheese at the bottom - I think it doesn't take too long to 'set' - and he left it cooking for a longer time than required...  I'm pretty sure it had more to do with the cook than the recipe... I'll be in charge next time!

Since I have never had nor made cheese fondue I will have to give this a 4 instead of a 5.  I made this in my new fondue pot that I received as a gift at my wedding and thought I'd break it out for a baby shower this past weekend.  I followed the recipe with no problems. Substituted once cup of milk for a cup of beer.  Also used mild cheddar. 

The fondue was a hit!!! Everyone loved it and some asked for the recipe!  Many of the ladies were coming back for seconds.

Thanks for the recipe!!

What the heck did I do wrong?  My inlaws said they loved this, but it was all grainy and clumpy.  I used regular-fat everything and it came out grainy and icky.  I was really upset and dissapointed in this.  I will not make this again for fear that I will embarrass myself in front of others.  Sorry.

Came out great ! Just as I like my cheese fondue. We transferred the cheese to a fondue pot and were wishing we had made more. The only thing I changed was, I added a 1/3 cup of beer for taste. This is a good basic cheese fondue.

Followed the recipe exactly,  it was very thin.  Had to add a cornstarch slurry, almost 1/4 cup and 4 ounces of cheese more.  Flavor was great.

Glad for a recipe without alcohol so I can feed it to my kids. When the recipe says "low" heat it really means med-low.  Turned out great and my kids and wife loved the flavor as it was.

It's nice to have an alcohol free fondue recipe. Another substitute for alcohol is to use 3/4 Apple or grape juice and 1/4 fresh lemon juice. The lemon juice acts as an emulsifier in place of the alcohol.

Very tasty and melted like a dream. Used Heinekken in place of beer, and a squirt of mustard instead of dry. Kept warm in a crockpot.

Like others advised, I used beer instead of milk and rubbed the fondue pot with a clove of garlic before adding the other ingredients.  This is not the smoothest fondue but very good.

Great the way it is, next time we make it we'll probably add spinch, and maybe something with a bit of a kick ( like hot peppers)  We served this dish with fresh veggies, and had bbq meatballs as a side. Overall very good and basic mix.

Now this was great!  I just took it inmy head to make cheese fondue one night and pulled this reciped and it was wonderfully easy to make.  I took the suggestion and substituted the milk for beer and it came out very good.  I served it with some home made bread and we ran out of bread were dipping anything we could into it :D

Pretty good for a basic fondue.  No single flavor stood out or overpowered any of the other flavors.
