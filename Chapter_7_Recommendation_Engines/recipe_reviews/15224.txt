This was good but I agree that it needs a little more flavor.  I added a little cornstarch to the juices to make a thick sauce.  I will try a little curry or a smidget of mustard next time.  This was also good on pork chops.

This needs a little something to make the flavour more exciting, but makes a good meal. I made this twice and found that the recipe was as good for 3 chicken breasts as it was for 12... just a little more or less sauce... you don't have to scale it up or down.

Nice light meal,however it requires more seasoning.  I used brown sugar versus white.Another step that would help is the following: After cooking,drain juices off into a saucepan. Heat the sauce, adding cornstarch to thicken. When right consistency, drizzle over the chicken which is sitting on top of a bed of rice.

Will make again but I think I'll add a little boost for flavour.  I think a little curry sauce might do the trick.

The chicken was about the only thing good in this recipe but I think I could bake chicken without all the trouble next time. Not something I would cook again at all!

Simple & very nice.  I tried putting the rice under the chicken & I think I would cover the pan for the last half of the cooking time, to keep the rice soft.

This is fast, easy and tasty to boot. We all enjoyed it, but the sauce would never have been enough for 10. I think it would need to be doubled, it was just right for 4. It is, of course, not spicy--just pineapple-ey and good!

Actually all this recipe needs is some salt to add depth and balance the sweetness of the pineapple.  Some soy sauce would do the trick, but since I was trying to keep this dish gluten-free I used two teaspoons of fish sauce instead. I also changed the white sugar to brown and threw in a chopped garlic clove, and let the chicken marinate overnight.

I am an executive chef for a restaurant and catering outfit, and this is one of the easiest chicken recipes I have found. It is very delicious the whole family enjoyed, next time I will have to prepare more.

Fabulous!!  This dish was so tasty and so easy to make - no leftovers at our house!  I followed other user's advice and used brown sugar instead of white and found that it added a nice color to the final result.  I also used prepared mustard instead of mustard powder because I didn't have any.  Served it on a bed of brown rice and poured the sauce over all - yum!

Good and easy. Fixed this for my Sis and Husband,
they both loved it. I did add garlic salt to the
chicken and pepper.

Excellent and so easy!  I used brown sugar and, since the 3 very large chicken breasts were frozen, I covered the dish for the first 45 minutes.  The chicken was soooooooo moist and tender.  The sauce was sooooooo good that I may make the sauce (thickened a bit) sometime just to use as a dip for chicken nuggets.

Loved this!  Very easy to make and very tasty (added a bit more pineapple than recipe called for).  Next time I will sear the chicken prior to putting it in the oven to give it more colour - otherwise, this is great!

My fiance and I loved this! The sauce is great and the chicken is to die for. The sauce is good for four chicken breasts. Fiance finished all the chicken off the same night and said I had to make it again!!

I should've read the reviews first, but I was in a terrible hurry.  There was nothing BAD about this recipe, but it was frighteningly bland.  We tried adding soy sauce afterwards, but that met with worse reviews than plain.  I had chicken already made, so I made the sauce, and heated them up together in the oven.  If I were to make this again, I would add garlic, maybe some red pepper flakes, and try the brown sugar suggestion.

Good recipe, I thought it lacks a little salt and spice. So I added a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of tandoori masala mix I had in my pantry. Came out good. Also, if no mustard powder, regular mustard can be substituted.

To give it more flavor and to keep it "tropical" add 2 table spoons of crushed red pepper flakes in the mixture.  Some heat but you still have the sweetness of the pineapple.

I don't think I would have liked this as written. 

I replaced the sugar with brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp fresh grated ginger and thickened the sauce with cornstarch in a frying pan after the chicken was done cooking then topped the chicken with it. 

I didn't put rice in the oven with it. I also only used 2 chicken breasts because it was just for 2 adults and a toddler. It was the best pineapple chicken I've ever had. I forgot to get a picture. Will try to get one next time I make this. I will make it again.

Good recipe - very quick, easy. I did use brown sugar instead and salted the chicken good before the sauce. Overall it was good, could use some more flavor, but I liked it.

This was so moist and sweet! I used brown sugar in place of white and added curry powder and paprika. I also served it over rice mixed with curry, paprika and lemon juice and baked for 50 minutes. I recommend this for those who like sweet foods.

Very good.  I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 TBSP cornstarch.  This made the sauce a littler thicker and added just enough additional flavor.

This was really good, despite my terrible cooking ability. I didn't have any mustard, so I just did without. 
Also, as suggested in other reviews, I made a thicker sauce after baking by cooking the juice on the stove, adding corn starch. It was delicious. I served it with garlic/onion/lemon fried rice (no egg), which tasted spectacular with the pineapple sauce drizzled over it.

This was a total waste of time and money. It was so tasteles, I can't imagine what more I could have done to salvage it. My husband and I couldn't eat it, so it went in the garbage. The worst recipe I've tried so far on this site.

I made this for dinner tonight and I really really didn't like it much.  It was edible, but nothing I will make again.  My husband hated it.  I added some ginger and a very teensy amount of curry powder but that didn't help spruce up the taste.  I guess I just like more zing than this offers....maybe I just set my hopes too high.  Thanks anyway.

Pretty good chicken.  It did come out of the oven pretty pale in color.  I served it with white rice.  The next day we took the left over chicken and made chicken salad sandwiches.  Everyone loved them.
