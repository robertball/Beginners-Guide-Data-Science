This is really good!  I cooked the shrimp in a little sesame oil, salt and pepper which gave it a nice Asian flavor.   I also cooked the shrimp with the asparagus and onion after the asparagus was cooked.  One issue, do not put the cheese on until the last 10 or 15 minutes.  At such a high temperature, after an hour, the cheese will either burn or turn into a hard brown shell.  Not very pleasant.   The temperature is needed to cook the quiche right but leave the cheese to the very last moment.  Next time, I might not put the cottage cheese or eggs in the blender since the curds provide a nice texture.  Good recipe though thanks!

Very good recipe but we did follow previous review instructions as to  not blend the eggs & cottage cheese) and  we used about 1/2 bunch of asparagus since it overflowed the first time we prepared this dish.  Being from south Louisiana, we will try crawfish instead of shrimp next time.

Very good recipe.  In looking over the instructions now my differences are that I did not pulse the egg and cottage cheese, but just beat with a fork.  Also, I had not read the reviews so put the montery-colby shredded cheese on top before it went into the oven and it was just fine.  Maybe the previous reviewer had an oven that was hotter than mine.  Also, I used 1/2 pound of jumbo shrimp cut in 3 pieces each and that was plenty.  For me this is a keeper.

I really liked this and will make it again.  A few changes:  I only used 3/4 of the amount of asparagus, 4 oz. of shredded cheese, and, substituted lobster cakes for the shrimp. It seemed a little dry, so I added 1/4 C. of half and half.  I stirred it all together and then placed in the pie shell.  Then I baked for 15 minutes at 425 and then at 350 until done.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, including the blending of the ingredients. It was terrific, and I’m looking forward to leftovers. My cheese did get overcooked on the top, and scallions burned up. Tasted good, but next time I will go to the extra trouble of adding them towards the end of the baking time.

I think next time I will cut up the shrimp, too.

I gave it the full 5 stars!  I wasn’t certain about cottage cheese in a quiche, but this was wonderful.  Very light and lower in calories than most recipes.  I did sauté shrimp and asparagus with onion before puttin in the quiche.  Also used Swiss cheese.  It is excellent!  Enjoy for yourselves!

Excellent recipe.  Substituted cheddar for cottage cheese & skipped the blender step - my family loved it so much I've made it a second time in a month!  Thanks for sharing

I made this, it’s delicious. I like the tip about adding cheese towards the end. My only concern is the nutritional value. 300+ calories per serving is way too much. I’m looking for healthier alternatives.

The Dear Wife and I made this for our Easter Supper. Loved it and have put it on our list of favorites. We didn't have any green onions, but next time we'll add them. This was good eating!

I like the base layer of this quiche -- the onion, asparagus and shrimp are an elegant combination. I steamed the asparagus to an "al dente" status, then sliced before sauteeing, and also blanched the shrimp in a bit of hot water before dicing and cooking. I love the use of egg whites instead of additional eggs to forsake any cream, but I do feel that there was something missing a bit w/o the cream (although the cottage cheese was meant to compensate). I used a yellow cheese instead of monterey jack because that is what I had on hand, and the cheese layer worked just fine!! I needed to cook about  5-7 minutes longer...I have usually baked quiche at 400 F and higher...the lower heat didn't brown the crust too much, and it wasnice not to have to cover the crust with aluminum foil.

Just made this tonight and served up for my wife and I.  Only thing different is we added mushrooms (great add on if you like mushrooms!) and forgot to put the cottage cheese/eggs mix in when supposed to, instead spread on top of cheese/onions at the top.  Got a little messy doing that, but still tasted great!
