I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. And I love to try new things, this was not one of them! Sorry!

This tasted good but the filling was runny. I'll try again and see if I can thicken it.

This pie is easy and delicious!  The crust sounds a little strange but it's perfect.  Everyone who's tried it has really enjoyed it.  Thanks Dana!
