I'm giving 5 stars because these tasted great, but for some reason, my peanut butter chips wouldn't melt.  They just got dry and soft, like they had been overcooked, but I checked it often in the microwave.  Oh well. I added milk and put them in the freezer to harden.  Will try again!

What a wonderful, healthy snack!!  I melted the peanut butter chips in the microwave then added the remaining ingredients.  Couldn't get much easier!  I'm anxious to make them for my grandkids for a snack!

I know many folks hate it when a recipe is changed...but when you don't have all the ingredients on hand, you make due.  I used low granola cereal with raisins in place of the peanuts, oats and raisins...I eyeballed it...but it was close to 1 3/4 c of cereal.  I used a small cookie scoop and ended up with 31 'balls'.  Even though I'm not at all a fan of peanut butter - these turned out to be good.  Next time I'm going to try them with chocolate chips!

Rather than shaping them with your hands, since that can get very messy, try using a melon baller that has been sprayed with cooking spray. These are yummy and somewhat healthier than some recipes.

These were just ok for me.  I must admit, I was a little surprised by the texture, as they do harden into quite a firm ball.  I was expecting something a touch more chewy.  These were ok, just nothing that I loved or can see myself making again.  Plus, the "teaser" indicates this recipe includes chocolate, but it doesn't?  It would be better w/some small touch of chocolate, for sure.
