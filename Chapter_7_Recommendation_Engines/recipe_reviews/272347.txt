I made these again today but I cut them 1/2" thick and air fried them for 8 minutes at 375 degrees. I flipped them over and cooked them 3 minutes more. I prefer these thicker slices over the thinner ones.

Tastes awesome. I used ripe plantains to serve as a side dish.  With bananas I like to sprinkle a dust of cinnamon and it makes a great dessert with vanilla ice cream.
