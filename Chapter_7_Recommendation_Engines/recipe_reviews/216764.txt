I made this for my family last night. I had to leave out the habanero because of the little ones, and omitted the salt. But, good fresh Mahi Mahi has some salt and I allowed my family to use it as they wished. (they always add more anyhow). All in all, it was great. No leftovers at all. Which is saying a lot for small children and picky husbands. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fish.

This was ok, but not nearly as flavorful as I had imagined when I read the recipe. I might try it again with ginger worked in there a few places to add some zip.

I had to alter this recipe a good bit, but it turned out pretty tasty.  I added pineapple, about 1/2 cup frozen chunks, as well as about 1/3 cup orange juice to the sauce, and removed the peppers (habanero and bell) due to little picky eaters.  As the fish was broiling I added some frozen stir fry vegetables to the sauce, and turned up the heat for about 7 minutes to get a nice citrus-y stir fry to top the fish.  Ended up with those little picky eaters asking for seconds.  Success!

Found this recipe while searching for ways to use a papaya I had bought.  Glad I did!   I will add a side  note here to suggest trying the Maui Onion salad dressing recipe on this site to use the papaya seeds - we have made it several times and always enjoy it.  Anyway, for this recipe -  the papaya I had on hand was not that flavorful, so I did decide to augment the ingredients here just a bit.  I did add some fresh pineapple chunks, and decided to add some ginger .  We enjoy spicy dishes, so I added more hot peppers than the recipe called for.   For us, overall result was great - the sauce had that spicy/sweet combination.   With rice and a side of  edamame, this made a very nice meal for us.   I will definitely make this again, it was a welcome change up to my rut of making pineapple mango salsa with fish.
