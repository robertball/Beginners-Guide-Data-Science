I would actually rate this at 3 1/2 stars. It was alright, but not alot of flavor. It has outstanding potential, but this basic recipe is definately one to play around with. Kids and husband liked it, so that's a great start. The meat needs to be seasoned during the mixing process. I would recommend salt, pepper and garlic powder as a base, all 3 to taste. With the right seasoning blend, this is totally a comfort food. Good for a small or large family gathering! The gravy part of this recipe may be great exactly as directed, but I chose to make mashed potatoes as a side and increased the quantity of the gravy by increasing the water by an additional cup. I did use cornstarch to thicken, about 3 1/2 tsp. I only used pepper to season, thinking that the condensed soup will already be salty, but I should have added salt when making the gravy. I believe that this is the first review and I don't want to discourage more variations of this recipe. As I said before, it has outstanding potential!!

I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste as suggested, and only had roasted garlic cream of mushroom. The end result was a good taste, but the meatloaf itself was a bit dense.  I'll probably add chopped veggies (green or red pepper, onions, shredded carrots), and decrease the bread crumbs to add some moisture and interest. I'd recommend you try this recipe! It was great with home made mashed potatoes.

This was a great and super easy recipe.  I followed it to the letter and thought it was yummy.  I usually don't like meat loaf because people put ketchup and other weird stuff in it.  I liked that this was a nice, simple and basic recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight but I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  It was fantastic.  I saved some fat and calories that way.

Four stars because it's a good base recipe. We like a meatier loaf, so I increased the ground beef to 2 lbs and decreased the bread crumbs to 1/3 cup. Other seasonings really need to be added to this. If I had left it as is it would have been incredibly bland. I added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 3 minced cloves of garlic, 5 shredded baby carrots and an envelope of onion soup mix. My store didn't carry golden mushroom soup, so I just used the regular cream soup. For the gravy, I added salt and pepper. I also added a cup of water as a previous reviewer did because we were having mashed potatoes with this. In the future, though, I think I won't do that because the gravy was too thin, even after adding cornstarch. Perhaps it would have been better to use milk instead. But I think what really would have been better is to just use more cream soup so the flavor wouldn't be lost. I did really love the cream of mushroom soup being used as a glaze for the loaf. I also served this with a side of peas.

This was a great starter recipe.  I have a recipe for Crockpot Pork Chops that uses a can of cream of mushroom and a can of golden mushroom soups and I like that flavor combination.  I added onion, green pepper and minced garlic to the ground beef mixture.  Also, I pat out the ground beef mixture into a rectangle about 1 inch thick.  I then layer swiss cheese, thin sliced ham, and frozen spinach (I squeeze all of the liquid out) and roll the meatloaf up jelly roll style.  I then continue to use the extra soup and make the "gravy" as I usually serve mashed potatos with meatloaf.  My family loves this.

This was a good recipe.  I added some extra spices to the meat, and the "gravy", and overall was very tasty!  I will use this as a base again for meatloaf.  It's a nice change from ketchup based meatloaf. :)

This recipe was very easy to do & follow. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I seasoned the meat with some garlic salt. Then I proceeded to add the bread crumbs and egg. Did have to cook for a bit longer than suggested in the recipe. All in all it was a good recipe.

I'm really surprised this recipe only has 15 reviews. It's very easy to prepare, and I think this recipe is great!! This is a regular on our menu. I usually use more mushroom soup, so we have enough gravy. Sometimes I serve it with cinnamon apples, but my hubby likes it with apple sauce. I bet it would be great with green beans or I've served it with green bean casserole, and it tastes great with all of the above. And of course freshly prepared mashed potatoes. Lately I've been using turkey instead of beef, and everybody loves it! Thank you campbell's kitchen for this recipe. It's been a staple in my kitchen for years, and will be for years to come :)

This meatloaf was a lot more flavorful than I thought it would be with as few of ingredients as it had.  I made as written except I added some minced onion and some garlic salt.  I also added some corn starch to the gravy to thicken it for potatoes.

As a rule, I DO NOT LIKE meatloaf.  But this one was delicious!  Instead of using Golden Mushroom soup, I had a can of "regular" mushroom soup and it worked!  I used home-made Italian bread crumbs.  I'm keeping this recipe!

This recipe was very simple, maybe too simple as it needs something to give it a bit of a kick...I made it, served it with mashed potatoes and gravy and a veg. it was good, but as I said it needs a little help..
