I used a few slices of Italian bread and omitted the tomatoes.  This is so easy and yummy.  Next time I think I will add tomato.

Easy and good. I had this with the "St. Louis Toasted Raviolis".  I toast one side of the bread first than add the pesto to the other side to get a crunchier effect.  I must say I like the "Basil Pesto Rounds" from this site a lot better.
