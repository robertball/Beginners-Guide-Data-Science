We liked this but with a few changes.  I cooked the sage leaves in the butter but then removed them and set aside.  The amount of pumpkin and cream are spot on.   As for the cinnamon and nutmeg - I did use 1 tsp of cinnamon but only about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  (Remember, you can always add more but you can't take it out.)  I added about 1/4 tsp of salt.  I would suggest more Parmesan,  about 1/3 cup.   I garnished with the fried sage leaves which was a pretty presentation without being too much sage.

Delicious!  I was surprised at how tasty it was since it my husband who is the pumpkin fan.  Made a couple of minor changes:  3 TBSP butter instead of 2, and I used 2/3 cup parmesan since that is closer to a regular alfredo recipe that I make.  This was creamy, and had the right combination of flavors without being overpowering.  I will be making this again for sure!

Good recipe! I modified slightly, based on ingredients on hand. Used half & half instead of cream, rubbed sage instead of fresh and added a bit of garlic (it is alfredo sauce after all). Served with butternut squash ravioli and it was delicious.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written but I did substitute poultry seasoning dry herb blend for the sage leaves.  Came out smooth and creamy but lacked any real cheese flavor.  I make again but I will add more Parmesan cheese.
