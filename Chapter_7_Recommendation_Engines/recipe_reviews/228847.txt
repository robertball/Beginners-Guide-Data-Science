I made this chicken exactly as stated, no changes. One of the best roast chickens I've ever made. Our family ate the whole. darn. bird. There was nothing leftover. Next time, I will double the recipe as I think this would be great picked apart for chicken sandwiches. NOTE: I served this with Pioneer Woman's Crash Hot Potatoes and a simple vegetable platter. This was a very inexpensive meal to make but comforting and satisfying all the same.

Excellent recipe - I did two organic chickens in a large roasting pan.  One I seasoned as directed - the other I stuffed with the onion and celery but used another seasoning mix.  They were both delicious but the original recipe chicken won the taste taste.  The bones are roasting as I speak - I see some good broth in my future. Thanks!

I made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it. I thought I would have leftovers to make chicken salad for lunch today, but it was picked clean. The chicken was very moist and I will definitely be making this again.

I've cooked my chickens and turkeys breast side down for years.  The reason this works is the dark meat on the legs and bottom of the bird is denser and takes longer to cook than the white breast.  Upside down, the dark meat is in the higher, hotter part of the oven (heat rises).  Unwrap your chicken or turkey and leave it in the fridge over night to dry the skin and then rub your favorite fat and spices into the skin.  Then there's no need to baste!

Delicious! The first time I didn't have lemon or celery but it was still delicious! I put pieces of butter under the skin with the garlic to help get it a little crispier too. I even saved the bones and made chicken soup the next day! I'm currently making it for dinner now(with the lemon and celery this time). This recipe is so flexible also. You can whatever seasonings you like! Thanks for posting it!

Beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. Moist, juicy and very flavorful. I used half butter and half olive oil for the herb mixture to coat the chicken. Other than that, no changes. Loved the garlic flavor on the meat from the garlic being under the skin. Seriously a delicious dinner that my family loved!

This recipe came out even better than I even expected. I purchased a 4 lb. organic roasting chicken from Whole Foods (they also birds labeled for frying) and made this with my 9 1/2 year old son, who loves to cook (and eat!) and needed to do a family activity for a Boy Scout achievement. He read the directions (with some help from me) and did all the steps with me to prepare the bird. When it came out of the oven, he said, "Wow, we made THAT?" After a great dinner the first night, we had enough moist, flavorful meat to make a wonderful chicken and pasta salad for the next night. We will definitely make this again!

This was not my favorite, personally I did not care for the garlic in this. If I make this again I will not add the garlic. Plus I thought the meat came out very dry too. I was expecting something juicier, just didn't work for me.

This is THE BEST roast chicken recipe I have ever made, and I've been making various roast chicken recipes for 30+ years. I followed the recipe to the letter except I used fresh parsley from my garden instead of dried, and I roasted the chicken in my convection oven rather than a conventional one. THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE.

Very yummy!  I wasn't sure the skin on the breast would be crispy enough, but it was.  Thanks!

This chicken was awesome!   Juicy and flavorful!  I paired this with glazed carrots and rice.  Takes some time but worth it!

Excellent!!!!! Very tasty!!! I made mine in a cast iron skillet  and it was superb!!! During the baking part I put chunky cut up potatoes and carrots and onions with a small handful of cut up celery I had left from the stuffing. I mixed up those ingredients with course ground pepper, sea salt, dried parsley flakes and olive oil and s but of butter. I put all that around the chicken, outed a little chicken broth around the edges then baked for the rest of the time.  My house smelled like a gormet chef had been there and the food was delicious!!! Great meal for company too!!! !!!!

This is a great way to roast a chicken. I made for my 12 year old daughter and I tonight and it tasted great. I added some mushrooms and made gravy with the pan drippings using some Wondra making it even easier.

Best chicken recipe ever! I'm not a big chicken fan but I loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly other than adding some paprika to the skin with the other spices. This was so moist and flavorful. I wasn't sure about the garlic but put it on anyway and I'm glad I did. This was literally the best chicken I've ever eaten. I will definitely be making this again.

I don't use the garlic and substitute italian parsley for celery.  I like to do 15 minutes for the breast-down part of the 450 roast.  The family keeps begging me to make this again and again so I keep making it.  Definitely a better recipe than the one I was using before.

I will definitely make this again.  Cook time was perfect. I let it dry out in the fridge unwrapped for a day before I made this, and I added a tablespoon more of butter after I basted it the first  time.  A great recipe!

Delicious! I was getting tired of recipes heavy on the ultra spicy side. This recipe renders an extraordinarily moist chicken with a lovely bouquet of subtle flavors that don't require a tall glass of milk to wash down. Served with fresh veggies - sauteed squash & onions, and roasted asparagus.  Yummmm!

Followed the recipe without changing anything...was curious as to how the breasts would turn out cooking  the bird breast side down. Very good flavor and lots of juice in the finished meat. Breast skin was somewhat soggy but this was expected and not a disappointment. Will be adding this recipe to favorites!

Amazing!  Rub it with what you like, stuff what you like inside, this high temp then low temp breast down technique is the best ever!  You seriously can't go wrong!
