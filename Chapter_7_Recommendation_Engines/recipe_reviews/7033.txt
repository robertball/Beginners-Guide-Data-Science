this is great!  the  modifications I made were adding vanilla (2tsp), and half brown/half white sugar. I also used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1 cup oil. I only added 1 cup of raisins, and am assuming the pineapple is to be drained.  I squeezed it out very well before adding.  This is a thinner consistency bread so I was concerned that raisins would sink to bottom and slightly scorch but they didn't.  Sprayed with "Pam for baking" spray and they slid right out of the pan.  I do like a spicier bread so added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I only had the small baby carrots so used 2 cups of shredded carrot.  This is super moist and would make great muffins too!  Could easily sub. shredded apple for the carrot.

This is super moist and tasty!  First off, I was wondering if I should use crushed pineapple with juice because someone suggested it should be drained(actually I used pineapple tidbits this time because I had it on hand.  It turned out very good!  You can actually see those bits and really taste pineapple).  Then I checked my favourite carrot cake recipe (it's on Allrecipes, called "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake").  The recipe calls for "with juice" and also buttermilk as more liquid.  So I decided to use the juice too for this loaf.  I took many reviewers advice and baked @ 350F for 70 minutes.  Wow!  It was perfectly done!  Usually if the batter has a lot of liquid, it takes me so long until the inside is done but the outside is burnt.  But this time it was no problem at all! I also tried another suggestion and used half white sugar/half brown sugar.  And I used half all-purpose flour/half whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed which I usually do for quick bread.  Super!!

This loaf is very good - not too sweet and very tasty.

I followed the recommendations of other members and made the following adjustments:
- instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar
-instead of 1.5 cups of oil I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 1 cup of oil
- added 2 tsp vanilla
- baked for about 1 hour and 10 minutes at 350 degrees (I started off at 375 but quickly realized this would be too hot for my oven)

I'll be making this one again for sure!

I was looking for a different spice quick bread and this was it! I had to change this a bit, to use what I had on hand. I used about a cup and a half of prepared matchstick carrots and omitted the raisins and nuts, as I didn't have any. I thought the recipe looked a bit "wet" and I was afraid that it might have an issue with being raw in the middle. I used one stick of melted unsalted butter and a half cup of vegetable oil instead of the cup and a half of vegetable oil. I also used two tsp., give or take, of pumpkin pie spice. I baked it at 350, instead of 375 because I thought that might be a little too high and cause the not-quite-done center. I was right. About 50 minutes took both loaves to be done perfectly. I also suggest to take a piece of foil big enough to just lay over the breads to keep from getting too brown on top. Very good! Very, very good. My kids inhaled this and asked for more. I'll be sure to make this again, but next time I will add the nuts and raisins.

I love this bread.  Chopping the carrots in a  processor made the preparation time quick and simple.  I have made it several times.  Delicious!  Thank you so much.   josie

This is a wonderful recipe.  It takes time to grate the caarrots but other than that it's very simple to make.  I did find that it takes longer than 45 minutes to bake. More like 1 hour, 10 minutes.

While the flavor of this was pretty good, I encountered several problems.  First off, I did make substitutions--I made only one loaf and used half brown/half white sugar, and 1/4 cup apple sauce in place of oil.  These were suggested, however, and when I cooked it for 45 minutes in the 9 by 5 pan, it looked great.  However, the next morning when I cut it up the middle appeared not to be fully cooked.  I had checked it with a toothpick, and it had come out clean.  I did think this was good, though, and worth re-trying.  Next time, I will: 1) drain the pineapple, 2)use (for one loaf) 1/2 cup oil (might replace it with apple sauce), 3) use a total of 1/3 cup sugar, maybe less, and finally 4) cook it shallower pan so it will cook more evenly.  Just something for others to think about.

Very moist. Great taste too. I had a 1/2 can of mandarin oranges left over, so I put them in the food processor and added them to the mix. I also used golden raisins instead of the regular kind. I also had to cook it a little longer - 14 more minutes at a lower temp of 350. Very easy to make.

These were really good!  I made a couple of changes.  I substituted light brown sugar for the white, and added 2 tsps of vanilla extract.  I baked as muffins...and they are so moist and delicious.

exactly what i was looking for! the changes i made (followed reviews) werent taste affectors. i halved the flour with oats ( im obsessed with oats), used castor sugar/brown sugar instead of white and baked at 350 deg. i also used a larger bread pan and made a dozen muffins (baked at 350 for 20 minutes). iwanted a nice loaf to give as a gift and this fits the bill. its just sweet enough and super moist! id have to disagree with putting vanilla in the loaf as it might make it taste more like a cake and thats not at all what this is.  Thank you!

This turned out great! I added 1/2 t. powdered ginger and 1 more heaping t. cinnamon. I slightly drained the pineapple by draining most the liquid and not squeezing the crushed pineapple. Healthier substitutions: 1 c. applesauce (no oil), use half white and half brown sugar. 350 Degrees for 45 min. worked perfectly!

I ran out of oil and only had 3/4 cup. Even with less oil than called for, this bread was very moist.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I added more cinnamon than called for and also added cardamom with the other spices.  I only had 1 9 x 5 loaf pan so made the rest of the batter as large muffins.  Surprised that this recipe calls for 6 eggs as most sweet breads usually only call for 1 or 2.  Came out great and will definitely make again.

These are fabulous!! first time I made them exactly, and now for second time,
I made 1 loaf and 12 jumbo muffins... I used a drained 20 ounce can of pineapple, because that was what I had. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of the flour for 1 cup oat flour and 1/2 of wheat germ.. substituted half of the oil with applesauce, and used 1 cup each brown and white sugars.. and still turned out absolutely perfect. Thank you for sharing the recipe :D

I felt this was a bit sweet and sticky. I made it to take to the office, and many people said they would have prefered raisins in it instead of nuts.

I made this as directed with one exception, i followed everyone's suggestion to bake it at 350 degrees instead of 375. I didn't have two loaf pans, so I used one loaf and two muffin tins (24 muffins and one loaf from one batch) regular size.  They came out pretty good. Moderately sweet. They weren't super puffy muffins I think because they are more meant to be in loaf form. I'll probably make it again but I'll try changing not up a bit with half brown sugar and half white sugar like some reviewers suggest and to be honest, I'll probably add more raisins. I love raisins in my muffins and there weren't enough in my opinion for how much batter there was.

It turned out very nice in spite of my forgetting oil! I also included the whole can of crushed pineapple, juice and all, substituted cranberries, and kept out the nuts. It was heavy, but still moist, so I call it a success. It's the first sweet thing I've made in about 10 years. Bread is what I bake.

I gave this recipe 5 stars b/c I was so successful with it. Thanks to the reviews I was able to personalize it a little more.  I only used 1c oil.  I used 2tsp vanilla, 1/2c coconut, craisins instead of raisins (that's what I had), sub. 1c brown sugar for 1 of the white sugar and cooked for 70 mins. @ 350 degrees.  The kids loved it which of course means that it was a great success! Thanks Mary Anne!

This is awesome - incredibly moist.  I took the suggestion of other reviews and used half brown sugar.  I also used half whole wheat flour and added some flax meal.  I used yellow raisins, omitted the nuts, and did not drain the crushed pineapple.  Oh and I threw in a little powdered ginger, which is a great flavor paired with carrots. A real keeper, delicious!!!!

It took me just over an hour to cook the loaf right through at 190 degrees celcius and I have an electric oven.
I have now added this recipe to my book, as it's a keeper!

I just baked this bread. I haven't tasted it yet but it has been a big disappointment . I followed it exactly but the time stated for baking the bread leaves it undone. I have tried to fix this I have put it in the oven 4 times now adding more baking time but it still isn't done. The author of this recipe should edit the time on this recipe it is misleading

A special kind of loaf! An impressive sweet to bring to a party. Tart, moist, delicious. I halved the recipe (12 servings) and made the following substitutions: 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup white flour; 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white sugar; 1/3 vegetable oil, 2/3 applesauce; 2/3 cup raisins, 1/3 cup dried cranberries; added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice and 1 tsp of vanilla. I used finely chopped baby carrots since I didn't have the big ones nor a grater on hand (this came out yummy in the loaf, like little chunks of carrot every once in a while). Batter filled two loaf pans, 7" x 5" x 1", coated with canola spray oil, baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Served warm at house party and it was a hit. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe almost to a 'T', only leaving out the raisins and nuts 'cause I didn't have any. The end result was 2 SUPER TASTY OILY LOAVES. The baking time and/or temp was off. I set the temp at 375 as stated but the loaves were not done at the 45min mark as listed in the recipe. I dropped the temp and baked an extra 15min. Although my kids liked the taste, next time I will definitely cut down the oil, and bake at 350 as another reviewer suggested. I also decided not to share this with my neighbour. 3 stars for taste.

This recipe is very good and easy to make. A couple of notes: (1) I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception. I just had a bag of baby carrots and I chopped those in the food processor until I had 2-cups...which is the amount suggested in another review. (2) I drained the pineapple and I think it would have been a mess had I not. (3) This absolutely takes longer than the stated 45-minute cooking time. Based on other reviews, I expected this so I set the timer for 50-minutes and started checking it at 5-minute intervals at that point. The toothpick test failed until (my estimate) 1-hour and 7m. The loaves looked way too brown at that point, so I was sweating whether I burned them but that wasn't the case. 

Based on taste and ease, this should probably be a 5-star recipe but it loses a point since the cooking time was so off and it made me sweat. :) And, yes, I realize that cooking times vary by oven, but they shouldn't vary that wildly. Good stuff!

I have tried this recipe several times, but cut it in half to make one loaf. There is something wrong with the cooking time or temperature, so I bought a larger loaf pan, 10x5, +and tried it again, this time in a convection oven instead of electric. It took 60 minutes to bake and the edges burned. In a 9x5 pan, the recipe took about 75 minutes with the same result. It is a very tasty recipe, but the cooking time or temperature is off. I wish I knew how to adjust the recipe to get a golden brown, moist loaf.

I couldn't be happier with this recipe (with my substitutions - substituting agave nectar for sugar, adding flax seed, substituting applesauce for half the oil).  It is truly a SUCCESS STORY.
Left a loaf in the break room at my new job - coworkers raved about it!
Met my boyfriend's family for the first time over Thanksgiving, brought 2 loaves with me - his family LOVES me now, and ALL the women (including his mother and grandmother) asked me for the recipe.  They were shocked when I confessed that I'm not a baker, and when I told them the loaf was healthy!
THANK YOU MARY ANNE! :D

I made a vegan version of this using egg substitute instead. I also subbed pear butter for pineapple. Instead of using 1 1/2 c oil, I used 1 c of the liquid I had leftover from making apple butter (it was more like a syrup) and 1/2 c oil. It turned out super moist and awesome. I gave a loaf to a friend and her family devoured it in one sitting.

I liked this bread it was tasty but there was just too much stuff in it for my taste, I think I will leave out the rasins next time it just seemed like there was too much going on. Also I was not sure if I should put in the juice from the pineapple or not, I just added it and the bread was super moist. It certainly lives up to it's name!

This bread was awesome! Followed the recipe as written, except I used egg substitute and half brown and half granulated sugar. I omitted the nuts and baked the bread using one bundt pan and two mini cupcake pans.  I will most definitely be making it again!
