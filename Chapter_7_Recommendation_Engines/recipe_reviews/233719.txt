Beyond tickled that someone submitted this recipe--I have been a fan of Laura Ingalls books since I first started to read. I made this last night for a quick dinner. I used Granny Smith apples for a hint of tartness, used a little more butter, brown sugar and cinnamon (my apples and onion were a bit on the larger side) and served this with a quality cooked kielbasa. NO leftovers. We ate every single bite.

Farmer Boy has always been my favorite of the Little House books. Years ago I made this for my kids--without a recipe to follow from the book, and because I always use apples in my Stuffing, I went with typical stuffing seasonings, Sage being a key player of flavor. It was pretty good eating!  

I tried this sweet and spicy version today and love it! We enjoy the health benefits of cinnamon, so I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and cut the sugar down to 2 TBLS.  I used Macintosh apples. And a dash of salt.

It was easy and tasty both. I was worried about the added sugar since I am diabetic, but decided it was Thanksgiving after all, and went ahead. I too did not need to add water, just cover the pan with a lid and the water in the apples and onions will cook into a sauce as they reduce. I wonder if it would be possible to make a spicy and sweet version of this dish?

I took Sarah Jo's tip and saut√©ed chopped kolbassa in with the onions and apples. I added some chicken stock to the skillet otherwise the brown sugar will burn and stick to the pan. It was so easy but such tasty comfort food. Will make this again for sure, it also would be good to take for pot lucks. Thanks for posting the recipe
