I used bacon that I had microwaved 'til crisp. Also, this is really good with slices of avocado. Thanks!

I did change this recipe slightly, not because I thought I needed to but because I had left overs that needed using.  I used my own sun blushed tomatoes which are coated with olive oil, sugar, sea salt and Thyme.  I am not a lover of blue cheese so used feta in its place.  I have never tried bacon in a salad before, but really thought it made a nice change.  So quick to put together, looked good too.

Perfect blend of flavors, this is a classic combination.  I made my own honey mustard dressing for this, like a little "zing" of mustard with the creamy, tangy blue cheese flavor.  Nice combo, Bob.

I actually used turkey bacon and an organic salad blend my Dad turned me on to. For the dressing, I made a mixture of homemade fat free ranch and free italian dressing. My family loved this salad. All I had to say was "BLT" and they inhaled it. Silly boys.

Great salad, no doubt about it.  But in terms of this being a great *recipe* this is really nothing more than a basic tossed salad - and doesn't even include its own dressing. This helped in terms of an idea for a side salad, but it's nothing one would have to refer to for "the recipe."  I used my own Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette and added some garlic croutons.

Really good - I used iceburg lettuce because that was in my fridge.  I used 1/2 the dressing and less onions because my husband doesn't like them.  Great recipe.
