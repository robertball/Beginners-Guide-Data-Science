Absolutely delicious! How?  Double the lemon juice, add 2 tsp. lemon zest/rind and increase flour to 3/4 cup  Everyone loved it!

I have to agree with the other reviews.  My family wouldn't eat this.  I had to throw it out. We didn't like the texture.  It was like a custard, that had very little taste.  We couldn't taste any lemon flavor.  I will not use this recipe again.

This really is an easy recipe to make. Unfortunately it's the first dessert I've ever made that my husband didn't ask for seconds of. He didn't care for the texture and couldn't taste the lemon. I agree that adding lemon zest would be helpful and perhaps cutting back on the coconut.

I do agree that this recipe is very quick! This recipe did not work out for my family.  My teen age daughter made this and it came out fine. It just was not our kind of desert. We did not care for the texture mostly. Otherwise I think it would be fine, if texture isn't a problem for you.

This is incredibly easy to whip up.  I used the recipe as written and think it wasn't lemony enough for me, maybe the coconut overpowered it.  I would increase the lemon and add some lemon zest to kick it up.  Will try it again, maybe with bananas!

Very nice! I went with the authur's banana suggestion and it was quick, easy and really good. I substituted 1/2 cup sliced banana's for the lemon juice and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I served it with sliced bananas and fresh whipped cream. The only thing I would change next time is to reduce the sugar a touch but that's just my taste.  Re: the negative reviews, impossible pie doesn't form a flakey crust like a traditional pie. It's more like a combination of cake and custard with a bit of a crunchy edge. Expectations are key with this one.

This recipe was okay.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to add a little lemon extract to boost the flavor.  Not bad.  I'd make it again.

This pie was great and I'll make it again and again.  It took 5 minutes to whip up and I had no issue with the lemon factor, but I was using really fresh and large lemons.  The texture was exactly as I expected and was a crowd pleaser!

I liked it. I tried what the author suggested and used lime juice. I also decided to double the juice amount which tasted very good. I would suggest that you reduce the amount of liquid by the amount of increased fruit juice. I also decided to take a chance and substituted water for the milk since a scratch lemon or lime cooked pie filling use s water when its cooked.  coconut/lime sounded good to me and the flavors were great. The only thing I didn't anticipate was the coconut floating to the top as it baked. But that wasn't a problem  just an observation.  So now I have the perfect lime or lemon pie filling to take to potlucks. I can't wait to try banana.

I was a little hesitant to make this after reading previous reviews but I am so glad I did. 
I did use a half cup of lemon juice and added the rind, I also used 3 eggs instead of 4. 
This turned out amazing, we wanted to eat the whole pan! Lemon and coconut are delicious together and this is a really quick, easy and yummy summer dessert. It would also be good with whipped cream on top!

I made this with 3/4 cup of flour, 2/3 cup lemon juice, and 1tps of lemon zest...The lemon strength is perfect, but it turned out more like a cake rather than a custard pie. I should probably lower the flour content back to 1/2 cup as the original recipe states.

I made this from another recipe. The only difference this recipe did not have is a tsp. vanilla. I would definitely use a tsp if not 1-1/2 tsp. It is like a custard filling and rather "blah"....needs the juice and zest from a whole lemon...not just a 1/3.  I was thinking that perhaps it needs some pineapple juice (less some of the milk)...would make it again with those adjustments.

I had made Almond Impossible pie but I thought it was too eggy tasting. Lemon seemed like a good way to minimize the egg taste. I made some changes: I used 2 whole eggs & 4 whites + 2 tsp. melted sweet butter. 1/2 c. Meyer lemon juice and 1/4 c. Lemon juice. I added 2 tsps. Meyer lemon zest. It's good...I served it with raspberry coulis & cool whip since the dinner I made it for had been cancelled & I didn't want to whip the cream for my husband & myself. I think the recipe still needs some tweaking - less coconut perhaps, maybe 1/8 tsp. salt added. I liked that it wasn't super sweet. I think I'll also add 1/2 tsp pure lemon extract next time to amp up the citrus taste. It is quick & a recipe well worth tinkering with to perfection.

It was 'impossible' to get anyone to eat this pie.
