The first time I made this with beef and used Kikkoman’s Stir Fry Sauce – which my husband loved but I wasn’t too happy with the sauce.  The second and third time I made this with pork and Kikkoman’s Sweet & Sour Sauce (along with some pineapple chunks to please the kids) – we all liked it very much and my three year old kept saying, “There’s something about this taste that I like!!!”  Next time I’m going to try the Orange Ginger Sauce and toss in some mandarin oranges.  This recipe is so versatile and we love the fresh veggies!!  Yum!

I wasn't really looking forward to this recipe, thinking it would be bland and uninteresting, but had to use the ingredients I had already bought for it. Man was I surprised!! This stir-fry was AWESOME!! It had great flavor and cooked perfectly. I used stew meat and it was fabulous.

Hubby and kids enjoyed it - but a bit bland for me.  Used red and orange bell peppers, snow peas, broccoli and carrots.  May try a different stir fry sauce next time.

Awesome! Best stir fry I've ever had :) Hubby loved it. I used good lean stew meat instead of cutting up my own steak. I also served it on top of Jasmine rice mmm.... will def make this again. Thanks :)

This is good & easy although it doesn't cook as quickly as the directions say for me.  More like 10 minutes for veggies and 5 - 6 minutes for all the meat.

Liked the recipe.  I used "House of Tsang, classic stir-fry sauce" and was tasty.  I would try other sauces next time, to just try something different.  Will definitely cook this again.  Everyone ate something in the dish.  I added some shrimp, as well.

I have already made this 3 times in the past 3 weeks ... I did beef, pork, and chicken ... each time my family of 4 couldnt get enough ... plus it was so easy for me ... just served it over brown rice and I had peace of mind that my family was getting a well balanced meal ... oh and I used low sodium stir fry sauce.

For mine, I added bean sprout and pineapple my wife and I loved it, but it was to spicy for the kids due to the red pepper. So if your cooking for small kids might want to leave out the red pepper.

Very good and quick and easy to make, especially if you prep your veg a day or two in advance.  I'm not sure if I liked the pre-made sauce I used, so I'll keep experimenting until I find my favourite.  Definitely recommended.

This was absolutely wonderful! Has nice added heat with the pepper flakes.  I substituted rice with cauliflower and it was fantastic.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

What makes a stir fry is the sauce. "Prepared stir fry sauce " is not a recipe.

Made this using beef strips, onion, and red green and orange peppers. For the sauce got the la chow sauce. Tried it without the rice and it was yummy. After work making jasmine rice to go with it. Can’t wait.

I made this using fresh broccoli, sweet red peppers & onion and I included the red pepper flakes but not the peanuts (I did not have any). While my husband thought it was “clean tasting”, I thought the flavor was bland & rather boring. I am guessing that the stir fry sauce can make a big difference and mine was probably not bold enough.

This was so delicious and versatile! I ended up adding around 6 c. fresh vegetables and less than 1 lb. steak, but it didn't feel off-balance to me. Also, instead of buying stir-fry sauce, I used teriyaki sauce/marinade I had in the fridge, and even a little homemade teriyaki salad dressing I needed to use up. I served it over quinoa and thought it was a fantastic, healthy meal. The sauce was a little too runny, but that probably had more to do with adding my own sauces, and was fine when spooned over the rice or quinoa. Will definitely make again!

The recipe is fast but the outcome is not as good as a more involved recipe where you marinate your meat overnight and make your own sauce.  I won’t use It again.

I cooked the vegetables and put with Beef then  cooked for 2 minutes, as instructed.  Vegetables got overdone.  I would not cook veggies with beef for 2 minutes again.  I will add veggies and sauce  when the beef is done then serve. This recipe is very flexible, can be altered to add different veggies than stated, the instructions remain the same.

Nice basic recipe.  The outcome is hugely dependent on the type of teriyaki sauce.  I used Kikkoman Teriyaki light and it was really lacking.  Per one of the other reviews, I added some sweet and sour and it made it a lot better.  I also added a couple tablespoons of chili paste.  For the veggies I used 2 bags of the stir fry vegetables in the produce aisle.  Although I probably could have used one.
