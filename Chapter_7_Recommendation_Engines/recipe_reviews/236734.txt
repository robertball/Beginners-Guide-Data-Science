I love all of these ingredients, so made it as my lunch. I doubled the jalapenos & added hot dog relish for some mustard "kick". I left out the cheese (crumbles?). Next time, I would add a lot more jalapenos, and this seemed to cry out for chopped dill pickles, onion and celery - in other words, my standard tuna salad with jalapenos added. I like some crunch to my tuna, which this just didn't have.

Two slices of bread for four sandwiches just doesn’t work (at least not in this house).  Made two servings today using a 4-oz can of albacore tuna fish, two slices of toasted bread, and my homemade pickled jalapenos...it was a big sandwich, and we split it for lunch.  We liked the flavor that the jalapenos brought to the tuna salad but did not care for the sweet pickle relish.  I’ve never seen cheddar cheese crumbles in the store, so I just chopped up some cheddar and did add a little salt to the tuna salad.  If I were to make this again, I’d skip the sweet relish and just roll with the jalapeños and cheddar, adding a little chopped onion and celery.  I think this would be a good candidate for a delicious tuna melt as the recipe author suggests.

Ok. So I have made this twice, once with lemon juice and once without. We preferred it without the lemon juice. This recipe as is makes two sandwiches, not four. I don't usually keep relish on hand, I use one chopped garlic dill. I also increased the mayonnaise. The kids and I both enjoyed it.

Made this almost exactly as described. I didn't have any jalapeños so instead I added 2 packets of dominos pizza crushed red pepper.
A little bit of lettuce and tomato on Italian bread that I toasted in the oven with a little more cheese on top.
