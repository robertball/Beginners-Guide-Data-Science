I made different biscuits (100% whole wheat with sunflower seeds and Dubliner cheese) and substituted turkey stock I made the night before instead of veggie broth.  It was fantastic!!  I've never really had a turnip before and we absolutely loved this stew.  5 stars for sure.

Spelt and barley flours were used in the delicious biscuits, with the best part being the sunflower seeds! With so many vegetables in the stew, I really enjoyed my lunch!  Thanks for both parts within this one recipe!

This is so close to a 5-star recipe for me.
My biscuits were a bit hard/dry, so next time I'll use a bit of something else mixed with my whole-wheat flour, and maybe add a little herbal seasoning into the biscuits.
The seasoning of the stew was fantastic!  I didn't cut the yam quite as small as I'd like, so the pieces were not as cooked as they will be next time.  Also, couldn't find a turnip, so used a pasnip instead.  Very yummy!

I did like this stew, but my husband would not eat it - tried one bite and put it back. I guess it's not for everyone, but if you like vegetable stews, this one has a nice, different kind of flavor to it. I struggled with the biscuits - not sure if the proportions are really correct in this recipe or if I just did something wrong? I ended up having to add more milk and rolling the dough into little balls, they turned out kind of hard.
