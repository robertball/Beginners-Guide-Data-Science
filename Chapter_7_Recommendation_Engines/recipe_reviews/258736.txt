Yummy treat! I really liked the ice cubes in this, and I didn't think I would. I think I prefer this to the regular banana nice cream that I usually make, which only uses bananas and a little milk then whatever mix-in you like. The ice mellowed out the banana flavor so I could taste the chocolate. I think it could have used double the cacao powder, but that's personal preference. I used almond milk. It came out of my blender very soft serve, but was fine to eat right away without needing to freeze. Thanks for the recipe!
