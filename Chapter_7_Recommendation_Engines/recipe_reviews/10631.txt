This was delicious.  I used 4 T. of grapefruit juice, and the zest of a whole grapefruit.  I iced it with powdered sugar mixed with grapefruit juice to a drizzling consistency, with about 1/4 tsp. of almond extract.  Then I sprinkled it with shredded sweetened coconut!  It was great, like dense cake.  I'm craving another batch!

My family and I spend part of the year in Paraguay where we have a long and abundant grapefruit (pomelo) season.  I made these cake-like bars four times one week because they were delicious!

These cake bars are very good.  I used the zest of a whole grapefruit, but the grapefruit flavor was still very subtle.  To add a bit more, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and made an icing for the cake out of additional grapefruit juice and powdered sugar.  Thanks for the recipe.

My hubby loved these.  I think though that the cooking time was a little off.  At 30 minutes I checked and the middle was still very jiggly.  I had to give them an additional 10 minutes.  I decorated them with the "Really Good Frosting" recipe from this site. Thanks for posting the recipe.

These are delicious!  The nice grapefruit "tang" somehow blends with the brown sugar and cinnamon, but doesn't get lost.  I slathered these bars with a simple powdered sugar based frosting flavored with fresh grapefruit juice.  Fine recipe, so glad I tried it!

These were surprisingly interesting.  I took the suggestion of others and doubled the grapefruit juice.  The batter was quite lumpy (which had me worried) but the "bars" (I would call them cake) came out extremely moist and yummy, with no lumps.  I am also going to make a grapefruit frosting (grapefruit juice, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, milk) to put on top.

I had a grapefruit that I needed something to do with and this was so easy to make. Pretty tasty, next time I'll probably double the juice and zest for a bigger kick. I used powdered sugar and juice for a thin icing. Yum!

This makes a gorgeous cake!!  Basic enough to make a few variations in flavour-orange, lemon, chocolate etc. I made it as written with only one sub, I used butter instead of shortening.  The grapefruit flavour is subtle but gives the cake a little twang.  Thanks for the recipe, this will be a regular for my family!!

Ok, to start with, this is a cake, not bars.  Next, the cook time is WAY too short -at first I thought that maybe they were supposed to be a little raw, like brownies, and then they'd get hard, like a brownie, in the fridge.  But no, they were RAW raw, not gooey-good raw.  SO we put them back in the over for at least an extra 20 minutes (and my oven usually errs on the hot side!) and then they were pretty good.  In my books, not really worth the fat in them, but still good.

Tasty but not what expected. It was more of a cake than a bar or brownie. I also had to double the cook time as well as the grapefruit juice. I used grapefruit juice and powdered sugar for the frosting, and still didn't get much of a grapefruit flavor.

I thought that this was basically amazing.. I didnt put any icing on it because I didnt feel like putting it on so I didnt. Also when making it i put in to much butter so then i just added a bit of all the ingredients to even it off basically, it worked quiet well. I enjoyed eating it, basically amazing.. it was my first time using any sort of fruit zest and it was a great experience.. AMAZING basically.. 

Great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic, and thanks to other reviews, I did make some changes, although the biggest change was due to only having 1 egg in the house . I doubled the juice and zest and used butter, not shortening; then I cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups, cut the soda to 1/2 tsp., just a sprinkle of salt (because the butter was salted), and used 1 tsp. ginger. Baked them in a 6x10 pan for about 20 minutes, testing with a toothpick. They turned out totally perfect; and the ginger, in my opinion, is a much better complement than cinnamon. A nice, clean taste that showcases the grapefruit-ginger combination.

A nice chewy brownie type dessert that we liked better than we thought we would.  I frosted them with butter, powdered sugar and grapefruit juice.

Tasty, but there wasn't much of a grapefruit flavor even with an entire grapefruit in the batter and another one as icing on top.

Bought grapefruit instead of oranges.  What t to do?
Checked for recipe using grapefruit. Sounded good. Made them and they are delicious.  Made holes in the cooked bars and poured icing all over them.   This is a delicious change from brownies.  ??????

I made these using an orange instead because I had it. Other than that, followed the recipe. I had to increase baking time by about 15 min for a 9x9 pan. Made a simple icing out of powdered sugar and orange juice. Delicious and refreshing!

I loved this!  I followed what a few others had posted and used 6 tablespoons of grapefruit juice.  I also made my frosting with grapefruit juice, cream cheese, vanilla, and powdered sugar.  It was delicious!

Really nice base, but I'm not liking the grapfruit in it.  I ended up substituting some applesauce for shortening (1/2 C Apple, 1/4C Shortening) I also added some of the pulp.  Maybe I put too much grapefruit flavor to it. Cake came out beautifully moist and fluffy with a nice crunch to the top.  I also used an 8x8 pan and lowered the temp to 325 and baked for probably double time.
