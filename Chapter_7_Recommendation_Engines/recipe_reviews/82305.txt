I just couldn't stop eating this! It was fabulous! The only change I made was to use Cherry preserves instead of Raspberry, and it worked very well. Easy too! Thank you so much for the tasty recipe.

I was pretty skeptical when I read this recipe, but the solid marks from the reviewers convinced me to give it a try.  I didn't have raspberry preserves, so I used cherry (and I was missing the mushrooms)but it turned out great.  I don't like grits, but my husband does, so I made this for his birthday breakfast.  Everyone looked at their dishes with a strange expression as I put it on the table, but once they dug in, they all liked it... including me!

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I used fresh kielbasa rather than smoked and I omitted the mushrooms and the raspberry preserves because I didn't have any on hand.  The flavors in the dish would have lent themselves quite well to the raspberry preserves as long as the preserves weren't too sweet.  I would add them if I made this dish again.

The cheese grits were great.  The milk really adds a lot of body to them.  I was nervous about boiling the milk so I heated it on medium until it just started to bubble then I added the grits and stired constantly.  This worked just fine.  The timing worked out nicely as well, because I was stirring the grits while the sausage was reducing

A great combination of flavors and quick to prepare. Being from the South we love our grits and this is an excellent way to prepare them. I also like that the ingredients are ones that I normally have on hand.

ALright, I will say the recipe does sound bizzare, but how soon do we forget the KEY ingredient in cocktail little smokies, or even cocktail meatballs is GRAPE JELLY.  Why would this be any better/worse?  Certainly it was WONDERFUL with the kielbasa. Be careful with the type of sausage you chose-(did not like with maple sausage), but with "normal" smoked kielbasa was great. I used two kinds, it was what I had. As we gobbled...it really reminded me of the little smokies served for appetizers...why not just throw out the grits and use this for your next appetizer??  I could take or leave grits...I'm a northerner, harder to find here anyway.

I was a little leary about adding sweet preserves to a dish like this, but it was actually pretty good.  I didn't have raspberry preserves so I substituted chopped cherry jam, which tasted fine.  The sausage mix went well with the grits.  (I may have had a different type of grits, but I needed to add quite a bit more liquid.)  I also added some butter,pepper and a little salt to the grits.  I would make this again.

We tried it last night.  We did not have raspberry preserve, we used Key Lime Jelly.  We also needed to cut the kielbasa slices in half.  We just loved either way.

My family loved this recipe.  Even my toddlers gobbled up the grits.  My husband and I love kielbasa, but we usually grill it and serve it with potatoes, sourkraut and/or peppers.  This was a great change for us.  It will become one of our "regulars" because it is so quick and easy!

You must really like grits for this recipe. my kids couldn't stand it.  my kielbasa wasn't thoroughly thawed and the sauce turned out really thin; but what was interesting was the sauce tasted like I had put in mustard even though I hadn't.  My polish ancestors are rolling in their graves with this one.

I thought this was very good. I did omit the mushrooms and will use this recipe again (minus the mushrooms). Delightful.

I found a raspberry chipotle chicken sausage near the precooked brats at my grocery store and substituted it for the kielbasa and preserves.  I still really liked the flavor and cut out many grams of fat.

Made it without the mushrooms just because I'm not a big fan...excellent anyway!  One note, though, if you use instant grits (which is what I had on hand) it will not take 10 minutes to thicken, so start them after the onions and sausage, not before.

This meal was fabulous!  But then I like sweet and savory together.  I used turkey smoked sausage (it tastes just as good as beef and is less fat).  I sliced my onion into 1/4 rounds instead of chopping just because I like that texture better.  I did start cooking the onions and mushrooms first and then put the sausage in.  That way the mushrooms could lose some of their liquid so the sausage would begin browning immediately.  I used Smuckers seedless raspberry jam - I don't know if that makes a difference over preserves or not. I needed more liquid for the grits to get it to the consistency I like.   The meal heats up great in the microwave too, I've had it for 3 meals so far and there's still a little left over - hey maybe I'll have that for my dinner tonight! Thanks MBC!!

I live in Alaska, and replaced the sausage with raindeer sausage and local berries, can be anything native or plain old cranberries. People literally licked their plates, I know, I was there! ;-)

Really good for such a strange combination. Used turkey sausage and omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any. As other reviewers mentioned, there was too much raspberry preserves. Next time will use half the amount.  I also thought the grits were a little too thick but the taste was good.

This was good but obviously only if you really like grits - which I happen to love.  Used lite smoked sausage and it turned out fine.

Delicious.  I think this a very simple and versatile recipe for Kielbasa.  I used apple preserves (homemade) and it was wonderful.  My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it.  I didn't try the grits; I served them with Spicy sweet potatoes and salad.

Thank you for this recipe. My family enjoyed it partly because we enjoy grits. For us it was a nice change from the norm. I have found that people who are timid about trying new foods. When it comes to grits you either like them or you don’t. It doesn’t matter how it’s prepared.

I was intrigued by the sausage and raspberry combo and quite pleased with how it turned out. I look forward to making it again. Next time I will reduce the oil for sautéing by half as it had a lot of oil and fats from the sausage left before adding the preserves. I omitted mushrooms because of preferences but added about 1/4C wine and1 T. garlic while browning the sausage and onions to give it some depth without the mushrooms. I'll also cut the preserves by 1/3 to 1/2 as there was more sauce than needed.

We tried this, just hubby and I, because we love kielbasa AND cheese grits.  Living now in MA (we did the opposite of everyone else, we retired from FL to MA) we do get weird looks when we buy grits, but we do anyway.  THIS recipe is absolutely terrific!  We ALWAYS use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water; this is an absolute must making grits.  The raspberry preserves added so much flavor!  I must try this with other flavors now! Thanks MBC, for a flavorful, fast meal!

I made this with turkey kielbasa and sugar free preserves as I am diabetic. I gave it 4 stars for its creativity and unique flavors... however.. I wonder if I did something wrong. Maybe I needed to caramelize the meat more or something... just seemed like it was missing something. I will try it again tho.

The raspberry goes really well in this. I did not care for the mushrooms. Next time I will leave them out. Also the sausage tasted better not mixed in with the grits. I added sunny up eggs and I loved the yolk mixed in.

This was a quick, easy & delicious meal.  I did not have any preserves and wanted a little kick so I added a small amount of diced pickled jalapenos to the grits.  It was delicious!  I plan on making this again with the original ingredients.

I also thought this was a little odd but sounded good at the same time. and it is very good kind of lite by that not a meat and potato dinner, but so good I will make it again. when I can find a good kielbasa.

I put off making this recipe because it "scared" me.  A very unusual combination of ingredients, but somehow, it works.  I served it as brunch.

Dear BF LOVED it and wants me to make it again; I liked it.  It is very filling, and it sticks to your ribs.

I plan to make it as a surprise brunch for all the boys over the Thanksgiving break.  Can't wait to see their faces.

Very good and unusual mix of flavors. I ended up with a lot of sauce after saute. I may try decreasing preserves by half next time to vary sweetness.

Ya gotta like a sweet sauce. Overall good. But it seemed more like a fancy breakfast dish than dinner.

I was skeptical at first but ended up doubling the recipe for a family gathering and there was none left. Everybody loved it!! I was impressed at how the sausage flavor blended so we'll with the sweetness of the raspberry preserves complimented by the smooth creaminess of the cheese grits. Very impressed.

Although I was a little skeptical when I first read the recipe, I was pleasantly surprised by this one...it was delicious! The combination of different textures and flavors really made this one stand out.

Enjoyed the inventive flavor combination of this recipe (and it's so quick to prepare!).  A few minor notes:
- Quick grits worked just fine; I used a 1 c. water/2 c. milk proportion to mirror the overall liquid quantity recommended by the box for 3/4 c grits.
- If you omit the mushrooms (didn't have on hand), consider increasing the amount of sausage or reducing the amount of preserves/ sauce to keep the proportions even.
- Definitely consider how sweet your preserves are.  I subbed huckleberry for raspberry since that's what I had on hand; the flavor worked fine but it was a bit over-sweet for my taste.  I'll cut back the quantity of preserves next time.
All in all, a great creative find (especially if you love grits and sausage as much as I do!).

This was pretty good but didn't quite have the pop of flavor I was expecting.  I left out the mushrooms like many of the other reviewers but otherwise made the recipe as is. Be careful with the type of grits that you have - just use the package directions rather than the ones above. And being from the South, some margarine/butter and some salt are essential to good grits!

Very good, I'll use about half of the Raspberry preserves next time to cut the sweetness a bit.

I loved it! You have to like sweet and savory combinations to like this, and liking grits is important too. If you like all of these things you'll love it. I realized after I started cooking that my mushrooms weren't good, so I proceeded ahead without them, but I can see that they would add another great flavor.

I am from the South and did not like this sweet meat over my cheese grits. I did add a little roasted garlic, but tried it with and without. Not my favorite, but edible. Grits are a thing to be savoured because of their comforting consistancy. Adding anything chewable is just wrong!

Who would of ever though of Kielbasa with Raspberry?  Well it's awesome!!  Like other reviewers sceptical but intrigued.  This turned out great and the only thing I changed was to the grits 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 munster.  Try it very good!

This was really great! I added an extra cup of mushrooms and next time will just toss in the whole package (about 3 cups total) Also, I will cut the onions bigger for more texture. I did add a little bit of cornstarch at the end of the simmer to thicken up the sauce a bit. I also used quick grits since that's what I had in the cupboard. I followed the recipe on the package but used milk/water ratio based on this recipe and then added the cheese. Came out great! Definitely a keeper.

This was really interesting and yummy. I did not add the mushrooms since I don't like them and it just sounded strange, it was fine with just the onions. Also, since we were using quick-cook grits, we had to adjust the directions for cooking them, and added a little extra milk to cream in the cheddar. 
Definitely a good winter-afternoon comfort food.

Great recipe! Most of my friends are musicians and I feed them after the gig or the next day after we drag our #&*!@ out of bed. The 2 changes I made were to cut those slices in half (halfmoons) and I use the instant cheese grits and add extra cheddar cheese. My friends tell my husband that I am the ROCKSTAR now!

This sounded so bad, I had to make it!  I used turkey kielbasa and it was really good.  I also made some ribs (just in case) and the raspberry sauce on the ribs was the crowd's pick!  I really liked the combination of the raspberry and the cheese grits.

I made this for supper tonight using turkey kielbasa and red onion and canned sliced mushrooms. My husband had never had grits before and he watched as I put this dish together. He wasn't too enthusiastic about it but loved it after tasting. He had two helpings and wants me to make it again. I liked it too. It wll be interesting to try the leftovet grits tomorrow.

This recipe came by email.  At first glance, I was not interested.  But it kept drawing my attention, so I printed it and threw it aside.  Finally, we decided to try it.  Even as my wife added the raspberry preserves, I could tell by her facial expression that she held out no hope for this.  You can usually tell if a recipe is going to be a success - even if it's an unusual combination of ingredients - or not, or if it'll appeal to one's tastes.  This one, however, was a mystery to us.  It intrigued me, but I wasn't sure.  Well, we tried it, and loved it.  We immediately put it on our list of "serve it to our friends" recipes.  We did not put the kiebasa/sauce over the grits; rather, we served them on the side.  But we really liked this.  Our kids liked it, too.

The floavor was good but I did not like the grits. They were too thick for my taste.  I think if I make it again I will use rice.

I really thought this was a strange recipe.  I love grits and I love kielbasa but this was not a winner.  You have to like sweet meat dishes and the amount of jelly you use is excessive. I would have cut it back by at least half.  Plus, the red, red color of sauce poured over the yellow grits is completely unappetizing and looked like a  mess on the plate.  I would not say this is a winner at all.
