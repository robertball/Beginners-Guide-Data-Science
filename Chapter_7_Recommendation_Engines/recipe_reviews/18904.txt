I made this risotto last night as a main dish. It was EXCELLENT!!! Especially the fusion of herbs like the combination of mint, rosemary and lemon zest! Really good... the only thing I would do differently is either make it like this and use it as a side dish or add some garlic infused chicken for some protein. My hubby missed some "meat"! I will certainly make this again. It was very easy! Thanks, Lesley!

If this recipe doesn't bring you to borderline carnal bliss, you did it wrong. This Risotto was AMAZING. The fennel bulb makes all of the difference... don't skip it or substitute!

This is just heavenly!  I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand - first off, I was very disappointed to find I had no white wine, so ended up using all stock, half vegetable and half chicken.  I also used the fresh herbs I had on hand - rosemary, basil, chives and sweet marjoram - and even though I bought fresh mint, I decided not to use it in this.  I added half the stock in the beginning, and half after that had been absorbed.  Finally, used the last of my really good parmesan and was pretty generous with it - maybe a good 1/2 cup or so.   This was the perfect combination of "homemade with love" and "restaurant quality".  Wonderful recipe for the novice risotto maker like me!  Thank you!

This is good.  With Risotto you always need more liquid than you think.  Sadly, my husband and son did not like the lemon taste.  Its quite citrusy...but I liked it.

This recipe was incredibly tasty.  Normally I don't like a lot of "herby" recipes, but this one was very very good.  I made it for friends, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thanks!

easily made vegetarian, this was a delightful risotto recipe.  i especially loved the cooked herbs vs. the fresh ones. i was wary of the cooking instructions though, and made it the traditional way, adding the liquid a little at a time while stirring frequently.

Followed this recipe as is..added a bit more wine and stock than req'd to extend cooking time - AMAZING flavours as i am not a 'fennel' fan.  i'll lighten up on lemon juice at the end or just forget it all together. Also, never added the cheese and enjoyed thorougly just the same - this recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely phenomenal!  I replaced the parsley and rosemary with cilantro and served it with a black bean salsa -- my vegetarian girlfriend loved it!

I didn't have any of the herbs, so I realize this rating isn't true to the nature of the HERB risotto, but here goes. The risotto was just ok. I threw in some dried Italian Seasoning in lieu of the fresh mint, parsley, and rosemary. I also tossed in 3 dashed of cayenne pepper (but it still wasn't spicy) and used double the white wine & a nice fresh block of Reggiano cheese. Next time, I'll certainly have those herbs to add in. And I might add a protein (shrimp?) if this is the main course.

OH MY GOSH! Try this!!! It is divine! As lcpgh (author) suggested, you can customize this w/ whatever herbs you love. I used all suggested but added fresh thyme cuz I grow it/love it. Also as another reviewer suggested, I made it using the "traditonal" risotto method cuz I was afraid! It'd be easier using the author's suggestion which I will follow next time. YUMMY!!!!!!

This was delicious! I made the recipe nearly exactly as stated, but I did have to improvise on some of the herbs and just used what was on hand. There was some lemon pepper, some oregano and I can't really remember what else, but it was all YUM.   I had been worried that 1/3 cup of parmesan would not be enough, but it was just right! The flavor was definitely present and fairly strong, but it was not overpowering.

This was absolutely wonderful.  There are so many layers of flavor and complexities to it.  Really delicious! I made almost as written.  Used dred fennel and parsley, just because I'm not as big a fan of those as the other herbs.  I used more lemon juice (juice of one lemon) and mistakenly added it with the other liquids.  Still turned out okay and I didn't need to add more liquid like many people are saying.  Okay, now for the but:  BUT, 10 minute prep time is not even close.  It would take that long just to gather all of the ingredients. Figure on about 30 min prep time.  Worth the effort!

It turned out pretty good, just a little more "different" than I was looking for out of this dish (I was cooking for my ultra traditional in-laws).  The flavor combination reminded me of Tabouli (which is not a bad thing just not what I expected).  I made mine vegetarian using veggie stock instead of chicken stock.  Also, save the salt til the end, and be careful not to over-salt.

This was wonderful - no changes!  The herbs made a normally bland rice dish very flavorful - loved the mint!  I Don't skimp - use fresh herbs just as written.  I served this dish with grilled salmon and asparagus.  It was a hit!

This is a wonderful recipe on which to base your rice dish.  I used duck fat to cook down the veggies, and I used bok choy since we don't like fennel.  I also used green onions.  I used duck stock to put into the rice.  I didn't have coriander so I used some cilantro.  Almost everything else was the same. Nonetheless, all those flavors together was wonderful!!!  Also, making it with duck fat and duck stock made this so, so rich this could be easily used for a main dish.  A fabulously complex dish that would be jsut as good to eat in springtime as the winter!!!

Wonderful recipe!  We just made this for dinner tonight,  served alongside a hearty vegetarian meatloaf. This is a fantastic early fall recipe! For meat eaters, I could imagine this alongside halibut steak or a roasted chicken breast. 

I prepared this dish inside my stove top pressure cooker which shaved off some of the cooking/stirring time while preserving all the flavor! To do this, follow the recipe as written, omitting 1/2 cup liquid. Once the ingredients were combined, I sealed the pot, brought it to high pressure, lowered the heat to medium and cooked it for 5 minutes before releasing pressure and removing the lid. Really, so fast for such a great meal!

Once the lid was off, I added the cheese, lemon juice, remaining zest and herbs, then  seasoned to taste. Perfect risotto!

I highly recommend this recipe! Great, fresh flavors balanced wonderfully! Cheers!

I made it. First time. Of course took me much longer.  Anyway. It tastes real good. I'll make it again depending on family's comment. My wife doesn't care for rosemary. So I cut back on that. All in all it came out good.

Loved the recipe. Only had fresh rosemary, so skipped mint and parsley. Added pieces of cooked asparagus and several shrimp per person at the end. Made quite a meal. Fennel and coriander definitely up the flavor.

We absolutely loved this!  I left out the fennel and mint and used thyme instead - otherwise followed the recipe.  It turned out great - I will definitely make it again.

It was very good but definitely use fresh herbs like the recipe states rather than dried as I did. The dried herbs just don't add as much flavor as I imagine the fresh herbs would add. You'll probably also need more chicken stock, about 4-4.5 cups rather than the 3.5 stated in the recipe.

This was a wonderful risotto recipe. I adapted it to a cardiac diet  by using salt free low fat homemade chicken stock and adding a dash of red wine vinegar along with the lemon juice. The flavor of the herbs and fennel was great and made it so that no one missed the salt. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good risotto, but suggest a change: rosemary is a very strong herb and can overpower, so reduce it by half and put it all in early so it can meld into the dish. Very easy to make. Guests raved and wanted the recipe. Thanks Andrew!

This is absolutely amazing! This is the first risotto I have made. I have tried to stay clear of them because they seem difficult to make. This recipe is so easy! I make this at least once a month as a side dish. This recipe makes a lot for two people so I always take the leftovers for lunch the next day. The herb and lemon flavor combo is heavenly.

STRONG FLAVOR!!  It tastes great, but watch out because it may shock your tounge with the deep herb flavors.

Omigosh, this was so good!  Such a fresh herby flavor - - a welcomed change of pace for a starchy side dish.  This was the first time I've made risotto.  It was kind of a pain to gather all the ingredients and prepare, but very much worth the effort!  The only thing I didn't have was the white wine, so  I just added 1/2 cup more chix broth.  I'm making this for company next week.  Thanks for a great recipe, Lesley.

chicken broth is not vegetarian!

As a vegetarian, I changed the stock to vegetable stock as, contrary to the info provided at the top of the recipe, this would not work as a vegetarian dish with the chicken stock content. It worked out well as a result.
