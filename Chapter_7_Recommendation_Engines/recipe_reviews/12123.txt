Complete silence descended on the table as folks dug in to this dessert!  It was so delicious for fall.  I changed a couple things--added 2 extra pears, so therefore increased the rest of the ingredients (except apples) by 50%.  I didn't have walnuts, so used pecans.  One tip is to mix the topping ingredients in the food processor--just pulse until it looks like coarse crumbs--fast and easy.

Nice combination - I like the different textures of apple and pear (I used Granny Smith and D'Anjou because that's what I had).  Needs some spices, though, cinnamon, nutmeg or a combination.  I've tweaked this several times and my favorite included cinnamon in the topping, pecans instead of walnuts and I used fresh cranberries, not dried.  I spiced & sweetened them up by simmering 1 cup cranberries in about 3/4 cup water, the honey and  a cinnamon stick and a couple strips of orange peel studded with whole cloves.   Stirred that mixture (removing stick, peel & cloves) in with the apples and pears.

A VERY good crisp recipe.  Feel free to play around with the ingredients.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added 1 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added orange juice and orange zest.  This is one of those recipes that I don't feel you can go wrong with.  Enjoy!!

This was a great recipe-I used Golden Delicious apples when I made it.  Next time I make it, I will definitely serve it with vanilla ice cream.

I've tried many crisp recipes but this one's right up there at the top.  I used fresh raspberries instead of cranberries as that's what I had on hand.  I like the idea of cubing the fruit instead of slicing it.  I found the fruit held its shape nicely and didn't turn into mush.  The crumb topping was flavourful and definitely added to the taste of the dessert.  Next time, I'll make a double batch!

We enjoyed this crisp and it is simple to make, but I think next time I will use fewer cranberries and nuts.  There are a lot of flavors and textures going on here.  My husband said "this is good, but I like plain apple crisp better"

This recipe is by far the best one I've tried for a Crisp.  It has just the right amount of everything- I once mixed dried cherries in as well.  Everyone I have served this to has loved it- even the GUYS.

I tried this recipe for our office Christmas dinner and it was wonderful! Very easy, flavorful, fruity and not too sweet. I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Thank you!

Even though I used what I had on hand (very ripe bartlett pears, gala apples, and extremely dessicated dried cranberries), it turned out quite tasty.  Next time, I'll try some baking apples, firmer pears, and fresher cranberries.  I'm sure it will be even better!

This was really good, quick, and easy, and I used the pears from my tree. I used delicious apples, because that was all I had at the time. I must admit, however, that I did add cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg to the fruit. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. The only bad part was that I did not have any vanilla ice cream to go over this warm delicious crisp, but is disappeared anyway. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummmm.  What a quick and delicious dish.  I used Bartlett pears and Granny Smith apples. To decrease the calories a bit I used 1 T. honey, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 5 T. butter without any significant compromise to the wonderful taste. When I got to step 3 and to make it a little faster, I placed the walnuts in the processor and pulsed to a chunky ground.  Then, I added the flour, sugar, oats and butter and briefly processed it to a crumb consistency, before sprinkling it over the fruit. I made this dish in a glass pie plate and it was crisp and brown in 30 minutes. I served with vanilla bean ice cream.  Wonderful.  Later, I zapped a helping in the microwave for 45 seconds to reheat it.  Well, the rest is history. This will definitely go into my 10 star file.  Thanks for sharing, Barb.

Had five overripe Bartlett pears and one sorry looking Gala apple leftover from a lunch box, plus one Gerber baby applesauce and a cup of frozen cranberries (bought fresh yesterday, so not craisins).  Tossed all of them together with a bit of cinnamon in addition to the honey (a little bit less due to the applesauce) and flour. Then made the crisp topping with a bit of cinnamon. Oh my stars. I am not even a big fan of pears, but this was phenomenal.  Deserves far more than five stars.  Eternal thanks for a fab recipe!

There was was too much butter in this. I would have put in at least half the called for amount. The bottom of my baking pan was half an inch deep with melted butter! I would have preferred the topping to be more dry and crunchy. Just an opinion, but for anyone else that feels the same... I also added a little vanilla to the fruit mixture, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice. I also added some blueberries. Other than the butter problem, it came out deliciously and I would definitely make it again, just without that much butter. Thanks for the recipe!

Great fall recipe!  I doubled the recipe since I have an abundance of apples and pears.  The only change I made was to add cinnamon and nutmeg.  I'll be making this again!

This was so very simple, yet soo good!  Delightful combination.  I used raisins versus cranberries, but my daughter used the cranberries and said it was even better.  I didn't have lemons on hand, so I added 2 tbsp of butter and a tsp of lemon flavoring with the honey and flour.  Poured it over the fruit and sprinkled nutmeg and then the topping on them.  Out of this world goodness for such a simple easy thing to make.  Thanks so much!

This is a delicious crisp. I used bartlett pears and macintosh apples and it was very nice.  My daughter wouldn't eat it however, even with ice cream put on top.  But my picky husband loved it!

I had a bag of pears and a bag of apples for when I had guests at my house and they didn't eat nearly enough fruit for me. Knowing that my little family could never eat the fruit in time I typed apples and pears and got this awesome and simple recipe! I used 5 pears, 4 apples, 3/4 of the recommended sugar and honey because we like the natural sweetness of the fruits, and added 1/2 a tbsp of cinnamon to the fruit mixture and another 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon to the topping thanks to tips from the reviews. We served this over vanilla ice cream and between my two year old and my picky  husband it was completely destroyed in less than 24 hours

This was great! I don't love pears but needed to use some, so this was a great use. I used 3 pears and 3 apples (sliced) with a little extra flour, and it turned out quite well.

This is an outstanding way to make a special anytime treat for your family! The crushed walnuts in the crumb topping really make it a hit and complement the fruit mixture so nicely! Thank you for this! I've made it quite a few times throughout this past month and will definitely save this recipe as a keeper!

This recipe is great! It is easy to make but i don't suggest children cut the fruit. The fruit becomes moist and tender while the crust becomes crisp and crunchy.

Delicious.  I used all pears since we have an abundance of pears from our tree. Since they were ripe and sweet, I skipped the honey and used about half the brown sugar.  I also used only 1/4 stick of butter.  We all enjoyed this with some ice cream! Yum!

I had to use Fuji apples because that's what I had.  I also used about a cup of frozen whole cranberries intead of dried and sprinkled them with a little Splenda.  Then I followed the advise of other reviewers and added a little cinnamon.  We enjoyed this dessert and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

yep this was divine.  added some lemon and orange zest and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.  did not use the honey but a little stevia.  would cut back on sugar next time as I used dried cranberries which already are very sweet.  did not have oatmeal so used some last dregs of ??? cereal. It was all good despite we had no ice cream.  Good use of fruit that is going south and very user friendly.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! I substituted the cranberries for raisins and the honey (didn't have any) for maple syrup. I added extra walnuts (crunchy). It was sweet and crunchy and crispy. Served it over vanilla ice cream. Great end to any meal :)

I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping and omitted the walnuts, and it turned out very good. Don't be afraid to leave out the nuts if you can't eat them.

This recipe is to die for!!! It's now my go to recipe for a quick dessert. The first time I made it, I didn't have any pears on hand, so I just used apples and craisins. I've also tried this recipe with frozen peaches, blackberries, and/or strawberries. Just be sure to thaw them first or it won't come out right. One thing that I would change is I usually reduce the amount of butter by half for the crumble. Other than that, PERFECT!!

Delicious recipe!  Love the combination of pears, apples and cranberry.  I added a little cinnamon to the apple mix and to the topping, because I love cinnamon.  I also reduced the butter in the topping and increased the nuts, to make it a little more heart-healthful.  My only criticism is that it is way too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half.  Will def be making this again, though!

This was good but needs some spice.  I forgot to add some in the fruit mixture, but did sprinkle cinnamon on the topping before putting it in the oven.  Next time I will use cinnamon and nutmeg in the fruit mixture.  Maybe even allspice.  One question, though?  Where can you find rome beauty apples an comice pears?  I used gala apples and bartlett pears.

I was craving a warm apple dessert to go with some vanilla ice cream we had in our freezer and my husband agreed, so I made this late in the evening.  I just happened to have a bunch of apples, a pear, and some dried cranberries that I didn't know what else to do with, so this recipe was almost perfect.  I used 4 small/medium apples.  One minute after popping it into the oven, I realized/wondered why the recipe didn't have any cinnamon or other spices that I think are essential to this sort of dish, so I quickly checked other reviews and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on top.  Next time I'll stir it in with the apples.  Also, when using my pastry blender to make the crumb topping, the walnuts and oats made it a little difficult, so next time I'll probably try mixing the flour, sugar and butter first, and then working in the nuts and oats toward the end. The end result was very yummy, and the perfect thing on a cold, fall night.

I added spices as suggested by others.  I used Granny Smith apples, they were pretty hard, so I steamed them for 10 min before adding them to the soft ripe pears.  I took a double sized batch to work and it disappeared fast.  Good recipe, thanks for sharing!

OK I went a little crazy with this recipe.  I not only made this in a large spring form pan, but I also put it in a pie shell.  It was wonderful.  My hubby loved it, my kids loved it and I didn't even get to try it.  I am making it again, but this time I am adding extra topping.  I served it warm for breakfast with whipped cream on top.  (shh...I was very naughty)

The BEST "comfort food!!" I will definitely make this again and again. I didn't have pears, so used all apples. I didn't have dried cranberries, so used fresh. I used about 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and added a tsp of cinnamon. The walnuts really seemed to make this crisp and it was absolutely delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Easy to make but needs more of the buttery topping, probably twice as much. Not sure if it will be good as leftovers. Otherwise, very good!

Very good recipe, I used almonds instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand and I only used half the sugar becasue that's the way I like it and I was thinking more for breakfast at the time and it came out delicious. I recomend this recipe, I'm sure you can replace the pears with more apples or peaches if you'd prefer. I also didn't pay attention to getting the exact kind of apple and it was still very good. I recomend this recipe.

This was so good I made it twice in the last 4 days.  I only used 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  I also added frozen peaches and some nutmeg and cinnamon.  Very good with coffee in the morning.  MMMMMMMM!!!  Update: I just made this with frozen tart cherries (thawed and drained).  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was excellent.  And I put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Yum!!!

Delicious! I omitted the dried cranberries though.. I was afraid the texture would be to much. I also made the recipe as a pie! It turned out fantastic! I added a pie crust from scratch at the bottom and voilà! we had apple and pear crisp pie!  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream... our guest loved it!

This is a great easy recipe.  I leave out the nuts and add more dried fruit.  One time I added a cup of mixed dried berries, instead of the cranberries.  Yummy!

I made this tonight because I had a bunch of aged pears to use up. I loved it -- with some changes. I used all pears (sliced, not cubed) and used fresh cranberries instead of dried. I pulsed the cranberries in the food processor a couple times and tossed them with the pears, and added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I omitted the lemon juice. As for the topping, I halved the butter, flour, brown sugar and oats. Also omitted the nuts (out of sheer laziness)and put a bit of cinnamon in for good measure. The result was fantastic - not too sweet - and the cranberry flavor really put it over the top. Thanks for the idea!

Way better than I expected.  I added a little bit of spice to the crumble, but the fruit part of the dish was just delicious.  The flavors work together perfectly.

Very good!  I ended up using fresh cranberries and upped the topping by 1/2, which I'm glad I did cause it wouldn't have been enough.  Great flavor!

Oh, this is wonderful! Easy and delicious. I did not use the specific apples and pears mentioned. I did sub raisins for cranberries as well as I was afraid if it was too tart my little ones would not go for it. Anyway, it was so yummy with a buttery, crispy crust. Thanks!

This was fantastic! I took the recommendation of several commenters and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I used 1/2 tsp. in the fruit and about the same in the topping. I think next time I will use a full teaspoon with the fruit. The best part of this recipe experiment was the next morning when I warmed it up and used it as a topping for pancakes (along with the usual syrup) and it was amazing!

Fantastic recipe.  A few slight modifications, based on what was available.  I increased the apple and pears, but didn't use cranberries.  The apples were 2 golden delicious, and 1 granny smith, with 3 ripe bartlett pears.  I tried this before in a shallow pan, and it didn't seem to turn out as well.  This time, I baked it in a deeper bread pan, and it was fantastic!

My wife loved it!  Baked this while making lunch. As other reviewers suggested I will add Cinnamon, Nutmeg and use the blender to prep the topping.  Quick, easy and not to sweet. Thanks Barb Y.

The topping on this was a little sweet for my tastes. Otherwise it was really good. Of course, I think it is hard to go wrong with baked fruit of any kind!

I substituted a whole package of fresh cranberries in this, added another apple and doubled the topping amount. It was REALLY good.

Wow, great dessert on a wet and cold evening.  My husband rated this 5 stars atleast!  Only changes were to use ground almonds in place of the ground walnuts, I used 3 apples instead of 2 and used raisins in place of the cranberries.  Used Braeburn apples and dessert pears. Served warm with warm custard as I didn't have any icecream.  The serving size is for 8 but I just about squeezed only 5 servings from this.  Maybe we just like our desserts!!  To feed 8 I would double the recipe.

I've been making crisps for years, trying to find a good mix of fruit and topping.  Many in the past either had too much fruit for the topping, or the topping didn't actually form a crust on top.  But this one was absolutely awesome! No-fuss, soo easy, and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it - hot or cold!  I'm allergic to cranberries, and didn't have any cherries on hand, so I used frozen blueberries instead along with Bosch pears and some gala apples I had. As well, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping mix (crisp isn't crisp without that cinnamon taste!)  Wonderful. The blueberries turned all the fruit vaguely purple, but it still tasted amazing! A definite keeper! Thank you so much!

This recipe was great! I did make a couple changes. I added cinnamon to the mixture, and placed it in a pie shell. I made the topping as it said to but, I added caramel topping it was to die for.

Awesome!  I used red delicious apples and bartlett pears but basically stuck to the recie.  I used almonds in lieu of walnuts becuase it is what I had on hand.  My husband suggested I peel the apples next time, but this was great! Definitely a keeper.

Instead of walnuts I added cashews.  People raved.  The butteriness of the cashews added a distinctiveness, a smooth creaminess to the flavorful crisp.

A great recipe - I especially like the honey taste.  I didn't use cranberries (boyfriend's not a fan), and I only used half the butter.  I also baked this in a pie crust.  I will definitely make this again.  I want to experiment with the crumb crust, as mine turned out a little too crumbly - it doesn't hold together very well (probably because I used less butter).

Outstanding! I didn't have pears and used fresh cranberries instead of dried. TIP:  for the topping, I grated the cold butter on a cheese grater. An easy and quick way to get an even consistency. Yum!

Fantastic.  Here's how I modified it:

-Used sweet-tart apples (one of the NY# varieties) and cranberries, no pears.
-Grated about 2 tbsp of fresh ginger.  Added to fruit with some cinnamon.
-Subbed maple syrup for the honey.
-Took out some of the sugar in the topping and used pitted dates instead.  Pulsed in the food processor with some powdered ginger and more cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.

Came out awesome, although the date chunks were a little too hard/chewy.

Loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I didn't have any ice cream to serve with it, but instead drizzled the top with some caramel sauce that I had made and topped with whipped cream. Next time I Might substitute the dried cranberries for whole cranberries.

I have made this twice so far. My family loves it! I used 5 pears from the tree in the backyard (no apples) and raisins instead of cranberries. I used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of honey (pears were still a little green.)It has been great both times we have had it!

Tastes good but even though I greased the pan the loaf stuck to the bottom. Glad it was just for trial and not for company, next time I will also flour the pan.

love this recipe. Changes I made based upon what I had at the time:
golden delicious apples
No cranberries 
Used pecans instead of walnuts
I also decrease the butter by 1/2 (1/2 cup just seemed too much)
Used organic sugar instead of brown sugar.
Still delicious. This is one recipe that will stay in rotation

I usually read the reviews before I try a recipe but not this time.  I knew it would be "right on" and it was!!!  The first words out of my husband's mouth was "this is good enough to serve to company".  I love the simplicity of it yet elegant enough for company.  A big winner!!

This was good, but needed a few changes. To make it healthier, use half the butter. A half cup is excessive, and it really doesn't need it. Used rolled oats, instead of quick cooking. It doesn't make a huge difference in the texture, and it's healthier. Also, I prefer leaving the skin on for better nutrition, if the texture bothers you (I don't think it's a big deal) leave the pears unpeeled, since they have thinner skin and won't be too bothersome texture wise and peel the apples. Also, so long as your fruit is nice and sweet, you really can cut the sugar and honey some. Also, adding cinnamon to food makes it TASTE sweeter without adding any actual sugar. Plus, this recipe really needs it. Cinnamon and a little ground ginger or its boring. I know. Tried both ways. It's lovely with some plain yogurt!

Great recipe, quick and easy to make, but after the first time I made it following the recipe exactly, it was a greasy mess. Cut the butter in half and it's perfect. I also add a little spice (cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg are all nice). Serve with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.

I followed the other reviewers' advice and used 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinammon with the fruit mixture as well as the juice and zest of one orange. I also increased the nuts to 1/2 cup. It was a hit!

Seems like a strange combination, but it's terrific, and so easy to throw together.  It makes for a colorful presentation too.

Tasty, but I think I would try a different topping.  I used Granny Smith apples, because that's what I bought, but they were quite a bit more firm than the pears in the final dessert.

I make this recipe every year for Christmas with my family and they LOVE it! Even my mom who I look up to cooking wise was asking for the recipe! I do add a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg (to both the mixture and the topping) and make extra of the topping crumbles though. Easy to make and so yummy! I look forward to it every year :)

I made this last year for xmas and I can't believe I didn't rate it, it was really good!  Apple crisps intimidate me for some reason but this one was super easy and turned out great.

Can't go wrong with a fruit crisp, especially in the Fall. I baked this up using only pears and dried cranberries. I only used 1/4 cup of melted butter in the crumb part and about 1/2 cup chopped pecans instead of ground walnuts and it worked out great. I did have to cover the top loosely with foil about halfway through baking to prevent over browning.

I've made this twice, once as written and then without nuts or cranberries. Both were great, but  preferred it the second time. It's a great recipe to play around with and use up whatever you have. (used gala apples & bartlett pears.) Love the combo of pears & apples. Thank you for this delicious crisp recipe!!!

Great recipe! Substituted half of the oil with apple sauce and it was still delicious. The cranberries are a great addition to the crisp--I forgot to add any cinnamon or spices and it was still really tasty. Will be making this again very soon!!

I made an oops and added everything but the butter into the fruit! So I decided to just leave it and still make the crisp topping. i put the fruit into the pan then the topping and baked it. IT TURNED OUT GREAT! we didn't have any ice cream so i drizzled french vanilla creamer on top! made it that much better!

Delicious. The only thing I changed was adding fresh cranberries instead of dried. I like a bit of tang in my apple crisps, and this was perfect!

Virtually effortless & amazing!  If you can cut fruit, you can make this - that simple.  My husband eats fruit but would not be considered a fruit lover, but he raves about this.    I included it in my Thanksgiving menu this year and will serve it as our son's 2nd birthday party too (per husband's request).  I usually substitute healthier ingredients in my dishes so next time I'll try whole wheat flour and sprinkle wheat germ on topping to increase nutritional value.  As with most of my recipes, I reduced the sugar when I made a whole tray of this.  Sweetness of fruit and honey was enough.

This ain't your momma's apple crisp. I found this one while trying to find mom's old apple & oatmeal crisp. I was blown away as was the whole clan at Thanksgiving. Add I did was use whatever apples and pears I liked and were available at my local supermarket. Then I added a shot of Gran Marnier to the fruit mixture. Booze makes every holiday a little cheerier, and that's a good thing!

Very good and slightly tart.  The honey and lemon juice add a nice flavor.  I used raisins because that is what I had on hand.  I'll try fresh cranberries next time!

Wonderful recipe.  Loved the topping.  The nuts (I used pecans) made it especially good.  Didn't have a huge pear flavour.  Still really, really good.

So I've been making this recipe for about eight years now. All my friends and family ask for it every holiday now. I've done it with cranberrys and cherrys, both are great. I pretty much always double and a half the whole recipe and do it in a 9x13. I try to use all organic ingredients when possible, I know it tastes better that way!! Enjoy

This is my favorite fall recipe.  I also add dried cherries and chopped dried apricots for a little extra tanginess.  I am always asked to bring this to social functions.  A real comfort food.  Make a day ahead and top with a small scoop of quality vanilla ice cream before serving.  Delicious!

This was AWESOME! It will for sure be my go-to recipe for crisp.  You can just use whatever you have around the house too- I had used 2 pears, 2 red apples, pecans, and raisins.  My family ate it with vanilla bean icecream on top, and raved about it. I really think it is the perfect dessert for fall!

I doubled this recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  I left the peelings on the fruits (a personal preference) and used craisins.  The pears added a nice texture, and the cranberries made it colorful.  I used half Granny Smith apples and half Braeburn Apples.  Next time I'll try McIntosh, and also I'll try fresh cranberries cooked down with the honey like another post recommended.  Definitely serve with whipped cream or vanilla icecream.  Thanks for the recipe and the helpful tips in other posts!

This turned out really nice!  But I like cinnamon with apple desserts, so I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice to the mixture; and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the crust.  I couldn't find Rome Beauties at the store, so I used Granny Smiths and it was great.

The ratio of butter, sugar, flour & oats did not produce the kind of topping texture I like in a 'crisp'. The filling was delicious though.

I have made this twice and have been very happy with it. I add the vanilla in as per some  other reviewers suggestion. Perhaps try to use a firmer pear, if you can,  but otherwise this recipe rocks. Also, orange flavored dried cranberries are great in this.

This was so good! This was also my first time making a crisp and I'm glad I chose this one. I only changed a few things, I used oatmeal instead of corn flakes and 1/2  cup of sugar instead of 1 cup. Oh and I sprinkled pumpkin spice on top of the crumble topping. If you haven't tried this yet, Go for it! It is such a simple and delicious recipe.

Wow- great recipe. MY husband said I can never make this again because it is so good he wanted to eat the whole thing in one sitting! 

The only change I made was ground almonds instead of walnuts in the topping. 

Yum!

Absolutely yummy on a nice cold evening.  The ground walnuts added a nice touch to the topping.  We added icecream on top for a family favorite!

I love this recipe!  I have made this several times following the recipe exactly and it is always great.  The last time I made it I substituted Pomegranate for the cranberries and it was really good.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, yummy!

Out of this world! The apples, pears and dried cranberries are a wonderful combination and the nuts add a great crunch to the topping. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the fruit and made 1.5 times the amount of topping called for. It was perfect!

This was a great twist!  We had some fresh golden delicious apples from our local orchard, so I used 4 of those instead of 2. Two Bartlett pears, and a little over 1/4 cup of sweetened dried cranberries. I can't do butter, so I added a teaspoon of imitation butter flavoring and 3 spoonfuls of melted Crisco to make the topping instead. Sprinkled cinnamon generously over the top & baked in an 11"x7" glass dish for just under 40 minutes. Very nice taste! Served it with frozen cool whip lite (can't do ice cream either) - it was a hit! Thx for the great recipe - I'd have never thought to use honey in this way!

Wow, this is a really nice change from your normal apple crisp.  I absolutely love apple crisp but this was even better!  My entire family begged me to make this again.  I used chopped toasted pecans in the topping and it was a beautiful compliment to the other flavors.  Thanks for an amazing recipe my family will enjoy always!

This is EXCELLENT.  I resisted the urge to spice this up, so glad I did... the flavor was perfect.  I would give this 5 stars, but it went mushy too fast.  Next time I will use underipe fruit to try to prevent this.

I just happened to have an excess of apples, pears, and cranberries on hand when I found this recipe.  It was awesome!  My pears were very sweet, so I didn't add much sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  Also used maple syrup instead of honey (personal preference).  Also extra oatmeal and applesauce instead of some of the butter.  The flavor was great - will definitely be making again!

Excellent Excellent Excellent!  Doubled the recipe and served warm with premium vanilla ice cream.  Used d'Anjou pears and golden delicious apples, Craisins sweetened cranberries.  It was juicy, sweet and tangy and the topping crisped up beautifully!  Made it for a work potluck and am making it for our family Christmas dinner as well!

This recipe is awesome. I used all apples and two each Granny Smith, Braeburn, Jonagold
I also used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon mixed in with apples and 1/2 tsp. in the topping.  I also used 1 cup of oats and pecans instead of walnuts.  It was great and got better each day after.

It  was very good, but giving it a 4*--because I thought it was too dry. Maybe it was the dried cranberries(Maybe  I put too many in it, but  when I make it again, I will add frozen berries like hucklberries, raspberries or cherries to make it juicier,I did add cinnamon for somespice flavor..I will make again-great with homemade vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is fantastic! I made a double batch for Thanksgiving and figured I'd have tons left because everyone was full from the meal and I saw them take just a tiny serving for a taste.  Next thing I know, I look over and everyone was going back for a heaping serving.  Needless to say, there was shortly nothing left and all I heard was "this is DELICIOUS!".  

Thanks so much for sharing!  This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent! Followed recipe, except I replaced the two tablespoons of honey with maple syrup (an idea from another AllRecipe submission (Maple Apple Crisp from Crystal). Used Courtland apples and Bosc pear (more available in the Northeast) and the crisp was superb!

this recipie was quite easy to follow and i really liked that i was able to add and subtract without comprimising the taste of it. however i would like to know if there are substitures for the specific pears and apples. they were delicious but fairly expensive. i make it every year for the holidays, so i guess the price is worth it, but i would like to make it more often.~~~YUM!

This was nice as it wasn't too sweet. I added a touch of cinnamon & all spice to the crumble mixture. I think it would have been a bit bland without it. Also used ground almonds instead of walnuts as we don't like walnuts. Will probably make again.

I used a walnut crust under the fruit in addition to the chopped walnuts in the topping. I added cinnamon to the topping and the fruit. Try just using the pears and omitting the apples, and serve alamode w vanilla ice cream.

Oh so warm and delicious - this got a 5 star rating in my house. I made mild enhancements....added a little more pear, cinnamon and then mixed everything in step 2 before pouring into the dish. Then I made 1.5x of the crust. We have a nut allergy so omitted the nuts and it was soooo yummy. Will be a go to for sure in the fall w/ a scoop of caramel ice cream. Note - We live at altitude so added 10 degrees to the cooking temp and cooked a bit longer to ensure the crunchy crisp. Thank you!

The only change I made was that I made half the recipe and cooked it in a mini pie pan.  It fit perfectly.  It was DELICIOUS!  I think the pears made it better than with just apples alone.   It was so easy; I will make it again!

Deee-licious!  And so easy.  Young and old loved this crisp.  I used what I had:  Granny Smith apples, half a bag of frozen cranberries, and walnuts.  The topping is really good and the recipes makes plenty.  Will definitely claim this as one of my best recipes.

Used 4 pears, 2 apples, 1/2 c dried cranberries and two cups of blueberries. I think just about any combo of fruit would work.

Delicious!  We used 1 Granny Smith apple and 2 Bosc pears and it was great.  It didn't fit into my 8" pie pan though and the recipe wasn't clear on whether the butter was supposed to be cold, soft, or melted.

Wow!  So very yummy!  After reading the reviews I decided to incorporate into the recipe what I thought were great suggestions.  I did use my food processor to do the "mix" portion of the recipe.  I did cube the fruit and used 3 pears as they needed to be "moved along".   I had fresh nutmeg and grated it into the dry topping ingredients...probably a tsp.  I did measure the brown sugar but "skimped" on the measurement some...thought we really don't need all that sugar.  And finally I served it with vanilla ice cream while still warm.  OMG....Sooooo good.  I was suprised how much it made...probably due to the fact that I added that extra pear.

Very tasty and somewhat healthy dish. I used tart dried cherries instead of cranberries, added cinnamon in the topping, and cut back on the butter to 1/4  cup.  I seevered with vanilla cinnamon gelato. My family loved it!

It was delicious!
I used less butter:  4 Tablespoons, instead of 8....it was still extremely good and we didn't feel like it was lacking.
My family of 5 ate almost the whole dish.

This was delicious and super easy.  I could make this every Saturday morning for the rest of my life! Substituted white wine for the lemon juice in the fruit mixture,  and added nutmeg, cinnamon and a 1/4 c of powdered sugar to dry mix crisp.  I also used Bob Red Mills 1 to 1 baking flour to make it gluten free (hubby has a sensitivity to gluten).  It turned out so good you don’t even notice it was gluten free.

This recipe is so delicious, and you can use any favorite fruit. The only thing I changed was to use a bit less butter as other reviewers suggested. This is always a huge hit and is demolished within hours of making it. One of my favorite go to recipes.

This turned out amazing! I served it with vanilla ice cream on top and everyone loved it. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and clove to both the fruit and the topping, which is definitely a must. I might also reduce the amount of butter in the crumble next time because it didn't come out exactly like coarse crumbs- more like a dough. After about 35 minutes in the oven it was done baking. I loved the texture of the walnuts and the combination of fruit was delicious. The cranberries added a nice pop of tartness every now and then, as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a wonderful dessert that is not too sweet. I used 1/3  up brown sugar, but will use less than that the next time I make it. I used 1/4 cup of butter and an extra pear.  This will be a staple in my house.

It was a very good and different version of a traditional apple crisp  The cranberries gave this desert a nice tartness.

So enjoyed the combination of apples and pears with cranberries.  I did find it overly sweet, so would reduce the amount of brown sugar next time.  I forgot the walnuts,  so I roughly  chopped and  sprinkled on top  which gave it a nice crunch and flavor.

Made this for a family gathering. It was a hit! Any type of apples and pears would work. I used gala apples and d'anjou pears. Made enough for a 9x13 dish. Multiple people asked to take the extra home.

I wasn't sure how many pears to add since my pears were pretty small, so I added about 5 pears.  I was going for a stronger pear flavor, so it worked out.  Everybody at my dinner party loved this dish!

I made this for company last night and a family get together today. Everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe as written. This will be a keeper in my dessert file.

I have made this dish one time I bought pears that came out to hard to eat. It came out wonderful.
I shared it with friends and family. It was a hit. I used meusli instead of oats and walnut, as I did not have either one of them at home at the time. Crunchy feeling.

It got rave reviews and it was gobbled up over yummy noises.  I took the recommendation to make the topping in the food processor which came out as a thick goo.  It worked out ok - but it didn't have the crisp topping - too much butter.  I would recommend reducing that a bit - someone mentioned they used 5T that may be a good plan.  I did add the cinnamon and nutmeg, (1 tsp each) which added some depth to the flavor.  A little vanilla ice cream (or cinnamon if you have it) and it is well received.

Excellent! I've made it with all apples and with apples and cranberries as well. Use half the amount of butter the full amount just isn't necessary. Delicious! I've also made it with gluten free oatmeal and flour with great results.

Needless to say, I didn't have the same types of pears (had over-ripe anjou's I needed to use) or apples (golden delicious were on sale) and cranberries still in the freezer.  Everything else per recipe (which I doubled, in a 9x13 dish).  Super, SUPER easy and good!  Next time I hope I have vanilla ice cream in the house too!

I really like the pears and apples together.  I had three pears, one was really ripe and the others weren't as much.  I think the under ripe pears turned out better, the ripe one was a little mushy.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the fruit and only 1 tablespoon of honey.  I think fruit is usually sweet enough and doesn't need added sugar.  Next time i might just leave it out since the crust is sweet enough.  I also would leave out the cranberries, they didn't really add much.  And I only used 6 tablespoons butter which seemed like plenty! Next time might try with only 4!

Great blend of flavor with the apples, pears, dried cranberries, walnuts & other stuff in the recipe. I did add cinnamon & nutmeg to the fruit & topping which added so much additional flavor. I also added a few more pears & 1 more apple.

It's in the oven (so more to come), but here's how it went: Subbed 2 Grannys & used canned pears (purpose of this recipe was to use them up so there!  ;D).  'Used a large can, 29oz?, except for 2 halves.  'Went with the suggestion of 2/3c topping ingredients - without the nuts.  'Didn't feel like digging out the crystallized honey so subbed with molasses.  Wild thing, I know.  'Only had 1/3c dried cranberries.  Since the pears were canned/wet, I increased flour to 2T.  Beautiful before the topping!Results: 'Think the recommended amount of topping would've been fine.  This is one of those recipes that "needs" ice cream - or less sugar maybe.  The molasses gave it a somewhat spice taste, in a positive way.  Incidentally, molasses has less sugar per T than honey so keep that in mind if you don't want it too sweet. 'Can't distinguish between the apples & pears so I may just have a secret fiber source here & use only pears!  :O  :D  This is good, but not amazing.

For whatever reason, I LOVE this! I made this recipe and it was gone in less than 24 hours (yes, I played a key role in gobbling it all up), and made a second one the next night.  There isn't anything super fancy about it, but sometimes it's the simple things that add up to something amazing.  Have been craving a cobbler, and this is it!  Personal favorite is using 3 pears and 1 apple with 1 tsp cinnamon added to the diced fruit.  Give it a try, great alone, with ice cream and fresh whipped cream- mmmm!!

This is absolutely a keeper in my house!  The recipe is a great blueprint for a crisp, but very forgiving and allows for experimentation.  I read several reviews and used 2/3 cup of each of the dry ingredients, but kept only 1/2 cup butter and the topping was fabulous!  I used 3 small Braeburn apples, and 3 large D'anjou pears (as that's what I had on hand) and, looking for a substitute for the cranberries, I threw in a handful of frozen blackberries.  I also added a little cinnamon to the fruit, and served it warm with vanilla ice cream--YUM!

I added a few teaspoons of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg into the apple pear mix and a tablespoon of cinnamon on top of the crumble before putting it in the oven, for more flavor and a browning effect. Eatin cold or warm with ice cream-this delcious recipe is always going to be a family favorite!

I ate this still warm from the oven and it is wonderful!  I did have to make some substitutions out of necessity.  I didn't have nuts so I omitted them but it would be tastier with nuts.  I didn't have honey so I used vanilla flavored light corn syrup instead.  I think the vanilla added a nice flavor.  Other reviewers mentioned adding spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg etc. but I don't think this is really necessary.  I thought it had plenty of flavor and with the addition of pears & cranberries it didn't taste exactly like plain old apple crisp I've been making forever.  I will definitely make this again.

this was fabulous!  I used the apples and pears I had on hand (2 very ripe pears, 4 small-ish apples-2 green & 2 red) and only used 6 tablespoons of butter in the crumb topping.  I baked it for a bit longer too, as I like a really crispy crisp.

It was quite yummy and my family liked it a lot.  I did use the suggestion of adding some cinnamon to the topping.  And I think I totally forgot to add the flour to the fruit mixture. I guess we saved those carb calories, here.  LOL!.  I also made whipped cream and served that along side.  Success!

This was divine! I highly recommend adding 1/2 tablespoon each allspice and cinnamon to the apple mix, then adding 1 tablespoon each allspice and cinnamon to the topping. Obviously, I like a lot of spices, so you could adjust to your taste. I also did not have cranberries so added raisins.

This was good but it is missing some things that would make it five star.  I added cinnamon and a dash of cloves because to me a crisp needs these spices especially with the fruit.  The crisp part couldn't have been easier to put together and I did like the topping with the addition of the spices.  The fruit mixture seemed to be missing something, maybe sugar.  It is a good recipe just needs a little tweaking to perfection.

Great Recipe.  Like the others said, you cannot mess this one up.  I used what I had on hand which meant grapefruit juice instead of lemon juice, marion and blue berries instead of cranberries.  It still rocked!!

I have used this recipe several times and have received numerous requests for the recipe.  At times, when Rome apples were not available, I used Courtland and Macoun.  I have also used Bartlett pears.  This is a great recipe and wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

I resisted the temptation to add spice to the fruit mix because I prefer to first try a recipe as written - so glad I followed the recipe!  The flavor of the fruit combo was simple yet pure - so enjoyable.  Can't really speak to the type of apple or pear - wrote it down as stated, but hard to discern what my husband brought home from the store. Regardless, we thank you for this delectable recipe, Barb.

simple to make, and the taste is simple.  By that I mean the dish needs more zing and flavor, things I will change next time I make it.

I tried this recipe and loved it, so i made it 3 times in one day and gave some to everyone. Pears were plentyful so I doubled up on them and left out the apples. (My grandfather gave me another bag of pears the next day)

I used Gala apples and substituted the cranberries for dried figs.  I took the advise of others and added some spice to the topping.  I thought the fruit was a little dry. Next time I think I'll slightly cook the fruit mixture in a little water before baking. All in all it was an easy dessert. Much more enjoyable served warm over with ice cream.

This was great.  It was easy to make and very tasty.  We had this crisp still warm with ice cream, a real delight!  I was worried that it might be a bit bland since the recipe didn't call for any spices, but it tasted great.  We couldn't taste the walnuts very much, so next time I will use crushed walnuts instead of ground.  Thanks for the recipe.

This Crisp is so good!!! I've tried other plain apple crisp recipes and failed miserably. Pear is my favorite fruit, so perhaps the taste of it improved this old standard. Didn't have any cranberries, and it was still great. 2 thumbs up - this will become a family standard. Thank you , Barb :)
