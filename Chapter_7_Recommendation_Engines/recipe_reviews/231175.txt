Made this last night. I did use fresh onion and garlic and added a dash of chili powder. Rave reviews from husband and son. Not sure if it was the liquid smoke, broth or what, but these are the best sloppy joes, ever. Thanks for sharing

Finally, Sloppy Joes that are as easy to make as they are to eat! I admit I was skeptical, but it was a long day and I really didn't want to do all my usual prep work for Sloppy Joes. Alissa to the rescue! I made this exactly as written, and OMG, it was good. I admit to liberal sampling while I waited for the liquid to simmer down. I wouldn't change a thing, except perhaps adding some diced peppers next time. But really, that would just be showing off. The recipe was a hit as written, and in about an hour from now I'll clean the kitchen by licking the leftovers from the skillet!

Made this last night for hubby and he really loved it.  I cut the sugar by one tablespoon and ended up having to delay dinner so I doubled the broth and just left it to barely simmer for nearly two hours, stirring occasionally.  I don't eat meat but even I thought it smelled fantastic and he could not have been happier.  This will be my go-to sloppy Joe from now on as well--many thanks for sharing, Alissa!

This is one of the best sloppy joe recipes going!!  Tried it "as is" the first go around and did make a couple small modifications.  I used real onion instead of dried, omitted 1 tbsp. of brown sugar and added 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper. The smoke flavor I use is Hickory which I think is the real key to the best flavor! Served with hamburger buns, mozza cheese and/or pickled jalapeno peppers.

Smoky, barbecuey, not too tomatoey or spicy. This had a strong tasste of the Dijon and had some bite back, but overall it was a decent reipe and I enjoyed my meal. I used mesquite smoke flavor. It sounded like a whole tablespoon of liquid smoke was a lot, but it turned out fine and I am glad I went ahead and used the full amount. My husband did not finish his but ate enough to be polite. This wasn't a favorite recipe but it was alright and I would try it again.

These are delicious!  Normally, I would be inclined to use fresh onion and garlic, but this was one of those nights I just wanted something as simple as possible.  I really don't know that I will go for fresh when I make these again- they are pretty darn tasty the way the recipe is written!  It could not have been easier to throw these together, and they are a real family pleaser.  I'll bet they would be great for a football party too!  Thanks for sharing, Alissa- these will be going in my rotation  :)

Made this last night and it was so easy. Followed the ingredients exactly but ended up adding an extra half pound of browned hamburger because there was so much sauce. Made all the sauce in a bowl including broth before adding to meat. Worked out fine. Think I will add some diced green peppers next time while browning my meat. I've never made sloppy joes from scratch before but from now on, it's the only way we'll eat them. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very different from any other sloppy Joe I've ever had.  I would say it's more of a barbecue beef sandwich.  I served it with a poppyseed bun, cheese and fried onions and it was delicious!

Wonderful Sloppy Joes!  I used fresh garlic but that was the only change I made.  My husband's only suggestion was to use more meat next time.  We just served it with carrots and ranch dressing.

A tasty and easy sloppy joe.  Nice to be able to use pantry ingredients to put together a meal the family can enjoy, without the canned sauce or any hassle.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe!   Thank you so much!   The only change I made was to cut back on the brown sugar, only because we didn't want it quite as sweet.  You can always add more, but start out with less so you can adjust it to your family's taste.

Sloppy Joe's were the request for the day.  I use MorningStar crumbles as we're meat free.  The liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce are great additions.  I always use fresh chopped onions sauteed first, and a clove or two of garlic. Also, I 86'd the beef broth and exchanged it with water. This was pretty good, but I like less ketchup and sugar, and more tomato paste.

Made this minus the sugar and beef broth (used ground turkey and water). Made a very tasty "grown up" sloppy joe.

The only time I've made sloppy joes from scratch.  It tastes much better than a packet meal.  I will cut the brown sugar down a 1/4 next time.  A little sweet.

Too much smoke flavour if you are making it for kids.  I didn't mind it too much.  I only put 2 tbsp of sugar in as well.  It was definitely sweet enough with this.  Otherwise it was ok.  Not making it's way into my favourites quite yet.

This recipe is spot on !
  It is a favorite at our house and I have tried many a  sloppy joe recipe.
I did cut back just a little on the liquid smoke.

The hubs loves sloppy joes and I'm not a huge fan, but I had some ground beef I needed to cook up so I went with this recipe. I halved it and used Dijon instead of spicy mustard and cooked for about 10-15 minutes instead of the recommended 30. This was so fresh and tasty over the canned version. I'll continue to use this recipe as I always have these ingredients on hand anyway. I will never go back to the canned version! Thanks for sharing your simple and yummy recipe!

Yum!  Probably one of the best sloppy joe recipes I've made so far!  My husband raved over it, and he is a huge sloppy joe snob lol :P  Topped with mustard and pickles.  Can't wait to make again!

I liked the Sloppy Joe mix (maybe a tad too much Liquid Smoke), but I made the mistake of putting it in buns that weren't very good, and that ruined it for me.

I made an 8 lb batch of this for my grandchild's  b-day party, this was very good, just a few suggestions, I did not use but half the beef stock, may have been because of such a large batch. I also added one small can of garlic tomato paste to boost the tomato taste. Also cut back a little on the onion flakes, seemed like a lot. This was a very good recipe for sloppy joes!!  Family really liked it.

I did not make any changes because that's what you should do the first time you make it  if you are going to rate it...  That being said I did not enjoy this, all I tasted was ketchup but my husband said  he didn't mind it (and he is not a fan of ketchup, I don't normally tell him if it's in a recipe so he won't pre-judge it). I gave it a 3 because he didn't hate it.  Maybe I screwed up somewhere but I don't see how.

Incredible! Instead of seasoning tomato paste, you're making the base of a real tasty barbecue sauce! It's sweet, tangy and smokey all at the same time. Tastes best on a toasted bun!

Excellent recipe! I made it as written and thought it was delicious.  I've followed other sloppy joe recipes on this site and seem to always need to double the sauce. Not this time! The addition of the beef broth gave it a very saucy consistency similar to chili sauce for hot dogs. The kicker is the liquid smoke. Perfect touch!

I have made these several times now. I have made them exactly as recommended twice and experimented with using Horseradish Mustard (for some extra zip) and I also tried adding a 1/4 cup of dehydrated Bell Pepper (Red & Green) -- that seemed to be what made it perfection!!

This is very nice, but maybe not the best "sloppy joes" recipe I've ever made/had. I made it several times (since I needed to use up a bottle of liquid smoke), and exactly as written (I used 85% ground beef). Despite all the ketchup, it didn't turn out too sweet, as the other ingredients made it taste tangier. Definitely worth making!

The best I've ever tasted!  (I used organic meat and ingredients wherever I could.) I did cut the  sugar by 1/2 because I ran out,  and will use the same amount next time.  I added hot pepper seeds and a quick squirt of  homemade BBQ sauce at the end of the simmering time, just to make it 'mine' :-).   Topped them with homemade bread 'n butter pickles, also from this site.  The best part?  No more canned junk!  Thanks!

It was fast and ok. It seemed to taste to tangy from the mustard so I added some sweet BBQ sauce. I'd probably make it again.

I made this tonight and it was very good I'll use this recipe next time but I'll add fresh bell peppers and  fresh onions that's all that was missing to me with that it would have been 5 stars for sure but still very tasty as directed a solid 4 stars. 

2nd time cooking this I used ground turkey and it came out delicious just as tasty as the ground beef.

Outstanding! Easy to make and totally delicious! I had concentrated liquid smoke so only added 1/2 teaspoon. I had to make these earlier in the day and put in the slow cooker. I didn't add the 1 cup beef broth since I thought the cooker would make them too runny. Good call. Left on low for about 5 hours and they were just right. No more canned 'Joes for my family, I'll make these instead. Thanks for sharing.

I made these last night and they were great everyone loved them, including my husband who usually does not like sloppy joes.  I will definitely save this recipe and use it again.

I have to admit...I haven't had sloppy joes in years and years...and when I did it was canned manwich...I made this recipe exactly as written except real onion cooked with the beef! Out of this world delish! Thank you so much! Was such an easy recipe after a long day at work!

Sorry didn't care for these at all. I cut back on the Worcestershire, liquid smoke and mustard but still that's I could taste. So Sorry.

Liquid Smoke, where have you been all my life?  

I made 5 times the normal amount of this recipe, so it also answered the age-old question of what to do with my honking container of Costco dried onions.  

Really good as is.  I added sauteed onion and bell pepper, so there was something fresh in it.  Also some chili powder.  I'm sure that it would be just great without any alterations.

March 18.2014.         Just made this for dinner.  Really good.  Will be making again soon.  Used real onions that was what I  had on hand.     Husband put hot sauce on his for some zing.  Thank you for the recipe.   Carla

Me and my choosy husband liked it. I used fresh minced onion and added a little minced green bell pepper. It was good but my husband still prefers Manwich. This is a nice substitute if I don't have that sauce on hand. Thank you.

2/24/14 So very easy and delicious!  DeWayne was craving manwich so we had planned that morning to fix for dinner, thought I had a can in the pantry. NO, did not. Remembered saving this recipe so switched to it.  He loved and thought better than the can he grew up on.  I added a dash of chili powder and tony's as I was browning the meat.  For me I would cut the brown sugar back a T but he said he would not, liked as is.
