Easy to make and tastes great. I skipped the vodka, and only had one grapefruit which was a little short of two cups of juice so I added some lemon and lime juice. When boiling the sugar water, I added some grated rind from the grapefruit and some honey (which probably wasn’t a great idea, the honey flavor was a little overpowering). But overall, it was delicious and I’m sure the recipe is great with no changes. Also, I don’t have an ice cream maker so I blended it in a blender, froze it until solid, blended it again, and froze it again, and it turned out fine, so it can even be made easily without an ice cream maker
