this is a good one. if you really find it quite hard to remove from the ramekins, you can also let it chill and serve in wineglass for a different look then garnish with sliced strawberries on top ..  yumyum..

I'm italian, I live in italy and this is the dessert I make everytime I have no time to do something more complicate! It's very easy and everyone love it! In season I use strawberry like this recipe, when they are expensive, I use maple syrup or melted chocolate! If you want a chocolate version, you can add some dark chocolate to the cream and make it melting with gelatin.

I spent all day in the kitchen fixing dinner for my boyfriend's birthday but I should have just made this! 

My strawberries were particularly juicy so I didn't add any water to the sauce. It was so easy to make but looked/tasted like I'd spent all day on it.

He lived in Rome for several years and insists that the panna cotta had the perfect consistency and taste. A definite must-try!

very good!  i used a little different sauce with it.  i simply put some frozen strawberrys, milk, and heavy creme into a blender and liquified them.  I made the Panna Cotta in wine glasses and poured the sauce into shot glasses.  It looked as great as it tasted and was so much easier than trying to separate them.  I would recomend this to anyone with only one downside. That being that it isn't something you can make on short notice or because you are "craving it."  It takes quite a while to set up (at least 4 hours, but overnite is best) but if you are planning a desert for the following evening, it preps quick and is very easy.

Super super easy to make.  I've made it twice already, and both times it was fabulous.  The second time however, I used my teflon coated muffin pan.  They slid right off without having to dip it in hot water or cutting around the edge.  It just takes some work to get the panna cotta right side up (meaning smaller side up).

The dessert is really great and yummy.  I follow the ingredient for pudding. For the strawberry sauce, I make it much simpler.  I use about 200 grams of strawberry, mix with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Put them to an electrical blender.  The excellent fresh sauce comes out in seconds.

Love this easy recipe!   I used a whole vanilla bean instead of the vanilla extract (softened bean in the milk, then scraped out the seeds & cooked it over low heat longer).  It was a hit at our dinner party -- even guests on a diet couldn't resist gobbling their's all up!

Wonderful!  I made it with fresh blackberries instead of strawberries.  I placed them in individual clear plastic party cups and took them to bible study.  It was the hit of the potluck!  I had to point everyone to the recipe here as they all wanted it!

5 stars for the strawberry sauce. In my experience, the sauce became really yummy after a day or so. After getting it off the stove, it was quite sour and I reckoned it is due to the fact that I bought my strawberries at the supermarket and the are not not that ripe yet. But I guess the sugar worked its magic during the day so it worked out in the end. I only made half serving of this as strawberries are quite expensive here but we still had a little leftover after using it for six panna cottas and I used wat's left as topping in vanilla ice cream. Not a bad deal using this for two desserts. ;)

I didn't use the panna cotta recipe here but I'll definitely use the recipe here the next time I make panna cotta. I'm not too fond of the recipe I used so I'll try this one to see if this is more to my liking.

"How could you NOT love whipping cream jello" as my sister put it.

Make sure you give everyone SMALL servings, it's also great with some chocolate sauce.

I followed another reviewer's advice, and used parfait glasses.  I was glad I did - because the leftover amount I put in a ramekin did not un-mold easily, and the parfait glasses looked much prettier!  I had lots of leftover strawberry sauce, which was delicious on top of vanilla ice cream.

I've made the Panna Cotta (only, not the sauce) three times in a month.  It's SO easy to make (BTW, I'm a man who loves to cook), and everybody loves it.

I add an extra tablespoon of sugar per 6 servings.  No one has complained about it being too sweet.

So far, I have served it plain, and topped with sliced strawberries, raspberry jam, chocolate syrup... they all go excellent with the panna cotta.  

The consistency is perfectly creamy and smooth.  The other recipes on Allrecipes.com use a lot more sugar and/or come out too much like jello.

P.S. Can people please learn how to spell DEFINITE/definitely correctly.

Have made this many times and served in a simple medium wine glass.  Over the years I have changed to half and half instead of milk and kept the whipping cream the same. For the strawberry sauce I sometimes change the water to 1/4 c water and 1/4 orange juice and 1 tsp vanilla and 3 tsp grand mariner.  It seems better to add vanilla after the sauce is finished. If it seems too thin I will add 1 tsp arrowroot powder to thicken slightly.

This recipe was so easy to make. I made it for my whole family and we ALL loved it! My father usually doesn't like "weird" deserts like this (his words, not mine). Imagine my shock when he went back for another serving. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious - perfect lightness and consistency. At my last house party, several friends had two servings and one even sent me a message the next day to say it was "phenomenal."

My hubby does not do white sugar so I sub the first 1/4 cup with 1/8 cup (2 TBSP) Truvia. I do not make the strawberry sauce, I heat up 2 TBSP no sugar added strawberry preserves and use that instead. With company I do the same thing but I top with whip cream & drizzle a little magic shell chocolate to make it look fancy, LOL!

First time making panna cotta the cream base was a little inconsistent may have been because I didn't mix the gelatin well enough . Strawberry sauce was excellent next time I would add some powdered sugar for thickening and sweetening. Definitely needs to sit 24 hours in the refrigerator.

I've made panna cotta about a dozen times using the same recipe, then I saw this one and decided to try a new way based on the good reviews and I followed it to a T. There is way, way too much milk in this recipe and not enough heavy cream. Usually I do 1/3 cup milk and 2 1/2 cups heavy cream. to this ratio, the consistency of my panna cotta was very unappetizing. It was solid, but EXTREMELY jiggly and very very thin, it reminded me of Foie gras. I made it in a glass because that's my preference, but if you were to unmold it it would turn into a blob after a minute on your plate. The texture was just very unappealing. The sweetness is a personal taste, and I don't like overly sweet desserts, but 1/4 cup sugar for 6 servings is not enough. It barely tastes sweetened at all, and if you're making it with a tart fruit sauce (like strawberry) you're going to want at least a little sweet, otherwise it just tastes sour with the sauce. I would do at least 1/3 to 3/4 cups sugar. Also, I didn't much care for the strawberry sauce, but like I said it's a personal preference. I would've omitted the vanilla from strawberry sauce, because I prefer it a little tart to go with the sweet and creamy dessert.

Not what I had expected, but it was alright.  It certainly presents as a fancy dessert even though it isn't too much trouble.
