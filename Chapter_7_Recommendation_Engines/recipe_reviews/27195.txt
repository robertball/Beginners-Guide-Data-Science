I gave 4 stars because all though these were very tasty, they didn't have any oomph.  I would recommend the longer cooking time, as the minimum gave them an under-done-cookie texture.  Good choice for a non-chocolate brownie treat.

I thought these were awful.  I give 3 stars, only because they were edible and a couple of my friends said they were o.k.  The texture was not at all like brownies; more like a bread or heavy cake.  Also, after I added 2 cups of chips, the batter was already loaded, so I did not add the last cup.  I'll keep looking for a great blondie.

I made these in both mini and bar form. My husband and I love them. They turned out better than any other Blondie recipe I've tried. If your looking for a Blondie recipe and not Brownie, this is the one to go with.

these were very dissapointing, the texture was not at all like a brownie but more like a cake, the texture was so dry, will not be making them again!

I thoroughly enjoyed these blondies. I didn't have peanut butter chips, so i substituted chocolate. It was delicious, with a brownie texture and a cookie like taste. Definetly a keeper, but not "the best ever".

This was my first time making blondies and I thought these were great--with modifications!  I substituted cashews for pecans (because I like them better) and used just under a cup of butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter chips. This amount was good--I can't imagine using 3 cups of either type of chip.

These Blondies are DELIGHTFUL!  Easy to make and yummie.  I cooked them about 35 minutes so the center wasn't quite so doughy as recommended in another review.  My partner and I ate about 1/2 of the pan!  This one is a keeper!

My partner took these in to work for a friend's baby shower.  You know how picky expectant moms can be .... well, the guest of honor requested that I make her a second batch!

Sorry, but I didn't care for it at all.  The gooey brownie part, which was good, didn't go with the peanut butter chips and pecans!  I only used a little over a cup of the chips.  I think they might be really good without the peanut butter chips.

With a few slight tweaks, I made two great batches of these blondies.  For the first batch, I cut to 2 cups of peanut butter chips and substituted walnuts for the pecans.  For the second batch, I substituted 1 bag of   white chocolate chips and 1 cup macadamia nuts.  Both batches turned out great and served up well with some Vanilla ice cream.

I don't like chocolate, but I love peanut butter, so these were great. I substituted salted peanuts for the pecans in the recipe and it added more peanut taste!

I did not care for this recipe. The consistency was dry and it was not sweet enough for me.

Wow! I really liked this recipe. Of course I didn't follow the directions exactly, so let me tell you what I did.

I changed the servings to 8 (so I wouldn't have to divide eggs.) I used dark brown sugar. I left out the cinnamon. I also left out the nuts and decreased the peanut butter chips by a lot. (I didn't measure.) Then I divided the batter into thirds (roughly) and cooked 1/3 of the batter in the microwave for 1 minutes and 10 seconds. It was SOOO good. Also, I tried 1/3 without peanut butter chips, and I liked it that way, too. Finally, I tried some without peanut butter chips and with marshmallow creme spread on top. That was also good.

So...have fun and enjoy.

Used almond butter instead of peanut butter chips, added about half a tablespoon of nutmeg, and couldn't taste a difference by leaving out the baking powder (I didn't have any). Delicious!

This was a good basic recipe. I could imagine many variables to it. I made it exactly. But substituted cinnamon chips and for the nuts I used almond slivers. Then topped it with powdered sugar glaze. Tasted like a cinnamon bun.
