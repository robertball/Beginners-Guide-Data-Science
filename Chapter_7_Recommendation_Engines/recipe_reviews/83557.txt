OK - if you are like me, you will look at the ingredients and instructions for this receipe and say to yourself "Jeez people, what is the big deal?" Well- don't do it. I chose this receipe simply because I had a whole chicken, not a lot of time, and needed to cook it.  I have NO idea why the combination of these ingredients or this cooking method (I followed it EXACTLY as written, but used real butter) yields such a wonderfully TASTY bird...but it does!  If you don't try this, you're missing out. If you do try this, I venture to say that, you will be very pleasantly surprised!

one bad review listed for my grandma's recipe says the recipe calls for too much butter.  the recipe has no butter in it.  I have tried this recipe with promise lite spread and it came out juicy as ever.  Recipe calls for margarine and I am happy to say low fat or lite works just as good.

I used the advice that the reviewer on the recipe page said:  Use in combination with Moist Garlic Chicken.  I sliced 8 garlic cloves and put in cavity, under skin and on top YUM!  I also sliced 2 small lemons and put one in cavity and the other on top.  Put 1/4 cup butter in cavity and 1/4 cup sliced butter on top. Put cut celery in cavity, and then salt/peppered all over. Roasted for 2 hours - turned out perfect.  The GRAVY was AWESOME!!  Some flour with the oils, then chicken broth and all the browned bits from the pan and juices from carving.  This was my first roast chicken.  Will make over and over!!

I beg you to try this one as written! Don't be one of those fools who write, what a delicious recipe! Then they proceed to tell you about the 1oo herbs and spices they added to this recipe. LIke I always say - if ya change the recipe that is nice - probably delicious - but it aint't the same recipe no more. This one is delicious - keep your hands off!

I used a combination of 2 recipies from this site. This one and "Moist Garlic Roasted Chicken". It turned out perfectly. For my seasoning I used garlic powder (instead of onion) and lots of salt and pepper both on the outside, and in the cavity. Next time I will probably add some rosemary. The other recipe called for stuffing the cavity with lemon slices and garlic gloves. The flavours were great, and it turned out really juicy. Thank you for this recipe :)

why is it that people give less than five stars on a wonderful recipe when they don't even cook it as it was written? at least try it the way it was written before you make changes, and if your changes don't work out how is that the fault of the original recipe? this is a wonderful recipe the way it was written, maybe you should try it that way.

best chicken I ever had, so juicy.  My sister-in-law literally sucked the meat right off the chicken.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  Also, I was out of the onion powder and so I used garlic powder instead,  I also lifted the skin on the breasts and massaged some butter under it, makes the skin crispy.  Yumm.

I believe the bake time for this recipe is incorrect.  I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes and it was not done.  Wonder if it should have been two hours and fifteen minutes?

great recipe. though i had to use different ingredients to season the chicken. i didn't use salt and pepper. i used Cajun seasoning and rubbed it outside and inside the chicken. i stuffed the butter/margarine inside the cavity like how it says in the recipe but instead of using onion powder, i stuffed onion wedges inside the chicken instead. i also aded crushed garlic cloves and about 2-3 sprigs of rosemary. if you're lazy to baste chicken, you can inject olive oil (or garlic infused olive oil) in the breast and the thigh to make it really really moist. it's such a no-brainer. thanks for the recipe.

I made a few modifications to this. I lifted the skin over the breasts, and added a slice of sweet onion, then prepared as written. It turned out VERY moist and flavorful; even the daughter who's not keen on chicken has asked for this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first ever roast chicken.  Delicious and idiot-proof.  I was able to make it before work in the morning and came home to a succulent bird at night (I basted every 20 minutes while coking).

I can't stress enough... use the margarine and NOT the butter!! I only had butter the first time around and I couldn't understand what that fuss was about this chicken. I gave it one more shot and followed the recipe exactly and WOW! That's some good chicken. If you add carrots and potatos and cover, you won't effect the flavor at all and you'll have a full meal. Just uncover for the last 10 minutes of baking to brown the skin. A+

I am a personal chef. My clients love this dish. I stuff the cavity of the bird with celery and put celery in the roasting pan around the bird. No other seasoning besides the onion powder. I do use butter, and it's great, but margarine would be just as good. This is one of the tastiest low-salt dishes I've found. Thanks for the help.

I tried this recipe tonight because of all the reviews but I didn't really think it would be as good as people said because the ingredients were so simple...boy was I wrong! I've roasted chicken for a long time with different types of seasoning and I've always been pretty happy with the taste and tenderness of my birds. I can't figure out what it is about this recipe--it's not *that* different from what I've done before but my chicken tonight was so juicy and flavorful that I was astounded. My husband declared this the go-to recipe from here on out. I followed the recipe except for 2 small variations: I placed the chicken on top of thick cut slices of onion in my baking dish --something I learned to do to keep the chicken off the bottom of the dish but also to keep all the yummy juices and cooked bits as well as to season the juices for the gravy--and I added 3 whole garlic cloves to the cavity, other than that I took what I thought was a chance and followed the intstructions. I'm glad I did...and I will again and again and again. Thanks for such a great recipe! This is going into my Tried-and-True set of recipes

Oh. My. God! This is beyond amazing!! It was by far the best roasted chicken I have ever eaten, and I can't believe I made it!! I didn't have celery on me, so I quartered an onion, and stuffed it inside. I used olive oil instead of margarine/butter as a more healthy choice, and it was superb. DEFINITELY making this again. I still can't believe how juicy this chicken was. And the best thing of all, it was SO easy to make. Believe me, if you haven't made this chicken yet, PLEASE DO!! :) Thanks for this great recipe.

I have tried many different roasted chicken recipes. This is so simple and so good! I had no celery, so I put chunks of sweet onion inside the bird. This recipe got the results I was looking for tastewise. Unfortunately, the 1/2 c. of butter is not good healthwise, but I think it may be the price of getting a yummy, juicy roast chicken. I made a nice gravy from the pan sauce for the mashed potatoes. This is definitely a good method. But maybe not the healthiest way to prepare chicken. I made this in a blizzard in Wisconsin, when we needed something warm and comforting, so it was really great for us.

This is my first review, and I chose this particular recipe because my chicken is almost ALWAYS dry (I'm not an A+ cook...), but I tried this and was so excited how tender and juicy the chicken turned out! My husband says "it's fine" whether my meals are delicious or just "ok", but this time he said, "that is freaking good chicken." Thank you! I won't be needing another recipe :)

This is FANTASTIC. Don't be tempted to embellish on this one, folks... it really doesn't need any help. The chicken is amazingly moist and tasty. The only thing that I did differently is that I rubbed some of the margarine and spices under the skin of the chicken as well as on top. Once you're done and have only a carcass left, be sure to save it for making stock later!

wow!  I cook a lot and this is an awesome way to cook a chicken.  Whoever says it isn't flavorful, either isnt seasoning enough OR is so used to supermarket roast chicken that they forget what a good basic roast chicken taste like.  I followed directions but did add some things i know I like....  I stuffed it with the celery and also a clove of garlic and an apple, I put butter and chopped garlice under the breast skin and rubbed a pat of butter on the chicken.  I also used garlic salt in addition to the other spices.  My bird was 7lbs and I cooked for 2.5 hours and let it sit a half hour.  With 45 min left in cooking I added cut up potato drizzled with evoo and sprinkled wth herbs de province.  After I took the chicken out I put the potaots back in for 15 min and shut the oven off and let them crisp.  Before serving, I stuck the chicken under the broiler for about 90 seconds to crisp up the skin.  This was SOOOO moist!  Thank you thank you!  Oh I almost forgot, I sliced an onion and cooked the chicken up on the rings so the juices would flow under it making it easier for basting.  I then took the juices and scrapings in a fry pan and brought it to simmer adding chicken broth and a tblsp of flour and mushrooms.  What a delicious gravy!

Made it just as suggested, and it was amazing.  Very juicy and flavorful without losing the natural goodness of the chicken itself.  

Side Note:  Why do people change the recipe and then not give the original recipe 5 stars?  If you change the recipe and then only like it 4 stars worth, is it the original recipe's fault?

I am NOT a cook by any means and based on everyone's reviews this looked like an easy recipe. i followed it exactly, except that i put thin carrot slices in with the celery. It was completely undercooked (even after leaving it covered for 30 min.) It was a normal 4.5 lb chicken [recipe calls for a 3-lb chicken]. I had to cook it covered an additional 35 MINUTES for it not to be pink inside.

Delicious! Was skeptical with so few ingredients, but couldn't believe results. My entire family (including two "selective" little boys) loved it. For the time and effort (quick/easy prep), it was well worth it. Will be making this again and again. BTW, I used garlic powder instead of onion powder without a problem. Also, had a 4.5 lb chicken and cooked for 1 hr, 35 min and was cooked to perfection.

This recipe looks so simple that ya can't believe it will be very special.  Well... It is UNBELIEVABLE!  I have never HAD chicken, even in a restraunt that taste this good.  I'm not sure why this simplicity works so well, Don't know if it is the celery, the salt or what ... all I know is that it does. I used butter (because that is what I use.. and all I have) and I added Garlic powder with the onion powder (because I like garlic)  I put some butter and some of the spices under the breast skin). Holy chicken! (cause I didn't use cow) This was simple, awesome and I will never make baked chicken another way. Why would I?!

5 star!  Didn't change a thing and the recipe didn't need it.  I also had a German grandmother who would stuff her bird with celery, oranges and onions.  This recipe brought back memories of going to her house on Sundays for dinner.  Always delicious.  Thank you Robinrockingbird!

Best EVER! I had 5.5lb bird which took about 2 hours. I put some butter (not margarine) under the skin and quartered 2 yellow onions and tossed them in the pan around the bird, half way through added about 2.5 cups of water into the pan. Also I bumped the temp up to 375 for the last 15-20 minutes to crisp up the skin. It was the juiciest, most delicious chicken I've ever had! Served with green beans sauteed in olive oil, garlic and course salt as well as garlic mashed red potatoes.

Surprisingly really moist and flavorful for such a simple recipe. I did slather the seasoning under the skin after I peeled it back so it would get into the meat. Five stars across the board!

This is fantastic - I've made roast chicken dozens of times but will rate this five stars for the EASE + deliciousness of the end result. Used butter in place of margarine, and was very generous when salting, peppering and onion powdering the bird. Basted every 20 minutes. The highlights: the tasty, crispy skin at the end, and the milk gravy made with the drippings. To make gravy (DONT skip this!! You'll be glad you didn't): after letting chicken sit for 30 mins, transfer it to a plate and scrape all remaining brown bits and drippings into skillet. In a separate bowl (or mason jar with lid), mix 1 1/2 cups whole milk and 2 tbsp. flour together until blended. Pour into skillet with drippings and whisk constantly over medium heat. When bubbles appear, continue whisking for another minute then remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed (mine needed salt). The gravy is to die for!

Absolutely fabulous! I added this to my recipe box about a year ago since trying it the first time and have used it three or four times since. This is the only way I make roast chicken now, and will be using this recipe for my chicken tonight! My husband and two young kids who are not chicken lovers can't get enough of it! Whoever gave this recipe less than five stars did something wrong, because it is fabulous. It comes out tender and juicy and full of flavor every single time! Highly recommended for the perfect roasted chicken! Thanks a lot!

This was the highest rated "roasted chicken" recipe that popped up, so I figured I can't go wrong.
Well, I was wrong and the recipe went wrong too.
I followed the directions, except since I wanted roasted veggies with my dinner, I put a bunch of cut-up carrots, potatoes and rutabaga under the chicken.
Now I don't know if that's what threw the whole process off, but the chicken was very undercooked when we sat down to eat it after the 30 minutes rest time (I don't have a thermometer, but with a five-star recipe, I trusted the time indicated).  
Back in the oven for another 30 minutes, chicken was done, but tasted bland. Veggies were also undercooked (I will blame the recipe for that too).
Very disappointing overall. Should have read the none-popular reviews before embarking on this.  Lesson learned.  :(

This recipe is only okay. I tried this recipe to the letter twice because of the rave reviews, but it is just as you would expect looking at the ingredients--bland.
Needs a lot more spices. If you cook a chicken with butter, salt and pepper it will be pretty good and probably better than this recipe...but if you add more seasoning it could be delicious. 
I'm African American and maybe I have a different palate but I wasn't thrilled with this recipe at all.

It was juicy alright and smelled wonderfully! Since I used onion salt I didn't have to add salt to it (duh!). I had also smothered the butter/onion mixture inside the skins for the flavors to work it's way in the meat while baking. My husband thought it was a bit bland though but everyone loved the crispy skin.

AMAZING!!  So easy to make and so deliciously juicy and flavourful!  I made some really minor changes...like using garlic powder instead of onion powder, adding crushed garlic to the cavity and under the skin...and brushing on about a tablespoon of honey for the last 20 minutes.  Oh and I didn't have celery so I used some sliced onion instead.  It still turned out REALLY REALLY YUMMY!!

I have to be honest and say that this was the most flavorless chicken I have ever made.  It just roasted there in this sea of butter and everytime you touch it your hands are just forever greasy, it was so aggrivating.  I used onion powder inside the chicken and out and even put 2 cloves of garlic in the cavity instead of celery and I still didnt care for it. Dont get me wrong, it was a juicy roasted chicken, but not much for flavor.  I would prolly never make this again.

This is by far the best roasted chicken I've made. For the first time, I was able to roast a chicken without setting off the smoke detector. I also added fresh garlic cloves under the skin, sliced onions in the cavity, and rubbed rosemary on the outside. Yum!

very good, but 180F is too high, it should be 165F (breast, and Leg Joints) for a juicy and fully cooked chicken.

I love this recipe. So simple and so delicious. What I did was melt 1/2 cup of butter in the microwave and added crushed garlic to it and rubbed it all over the chicken. Then I sprinkled salt, black pepper and dried crushed basil leaves. I didn't stuff it with anything but I will next time. The key is to place the chicken breast-side down in the pan. The breast comes out so moist and juicy that way. Also, I was scared to leave the chicken uncovered for the 1 hour 15 mins (I'm used to covering it for 30mins then uncover for 30 minutes to ensure well-cooked chicken), but I left it uncovered the whole time and it was perfect! The smell will be so good but just resist the urge to open the oven door since everytime you open the oven door, the temperature decreased 25 degrees F, which extends cooking time.

This turned out GREAT!!! My husband said it deserves 10 stars :) My chicken was almost 6 pounds so I raised the temp to 425, and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours. Oh, and I used real butter. It was so juicy and flavorful. Thank you!

This is exactly how my Grandmother did her roast chicken and I proudly follow in her Germanic footsteps. She always lifted the skin of the chicken and inserted little pats of butter along the breast and at the thigh and butter inside the cavity with the celery. An easier recipe would be hard to find. Truly delicious.

Prepared as written. I cook all roasted meats on a cookie sheet lined with foil. Easy clean up and the air seems to circulate better cooking the meat more evenly. I placed chopped carrots, onions, potatoes and garlic gloves on the cookie sheet and cooked with the chicken. When the meat and veggies were roasted I took the pan drippings in a sauce pan and added 3/4c of water mixed with 1 tbsp of flour and 1 tsp of salt to make the gravy. This was awesome - very tasty! Thank you.

I made this last night as written except I added some potatoes around the chicken...my family fought over the potatoes (I must remember to add more next time!).  I am making soup out of the wonderful leftovers today.  THANK YOU for sharing your grandmother's recipes...aren't grandma's the best?!!

3/3/10 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/83557/juicy-roasted-chicken/ ... "This chicken is so good!" my twelve year old boy said who doesn't give compliments!  'One of those simple recipes that transforms in the oven.  It gave me inspiration to try placing granny smith apple pieces in the next one.  Good, too! 3/27/12'Didn't like it as much this time. 'Not blaming the recipe, but maybe the chicken? 'Remember it being juicy, but this time was bordering on greasy.  'Not blaming the recipe since it isn't basted frequently. 'May have liked the granny smith apple better, too - or both - but that wouldn't affect the grease factor. 'Used perdue, big 7pounder, this last time.  'Maybe it was another brand w first review. 'Probably decrease it next time, just to be sure ... 8 20 17 Used 6T.   2T in + 4T on = YUM!

Not being able to follow this recipe as written I want to say it WORKS WITH B/L S/L CHICKEN BREAST TOO! 
Groceries are running low,i was forced to make chicken for the 3rd time this week! We had it BBQ and the my sons favorite breaded & baked so i came across this one and decided to try it. I pounded them out and marinated in olive oil & minced garlic for an hour than put it all in a roasting pan with the celery & carrots i had leftover...i tried to stack the chicken to make it more cavity-like lol,added a little rosemary and the rest of what the recipe called for (margerine, salt & pepper!!) baked. It was Delicious! Had it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I look forward to making this on a cold winter day. I will definitely pick up a whole chicken on grocery day and follow this recipe correctly. My apologies to those of you that get upset when a recipe is changed and then rated.

Delicious! I stuffed the cavity with some extra aromatics instead of margarine. I initially only rubbed the outside with olive oil, but decided to throw on a few dollops of butter after all (two table spoons on the whole chicken -never killed anyone). It was so juicy! Delicious!

Great starting place!!  I also put an onion and two bay leaves inside the chicken.  I added sliced mushrooms and baby carrots to the bottom of the pan - then made a gravy with the drippings.  Lightly sprinkle hot paprika all over the skin before baking to give a nice flavor and color.  Thanks!!!

Use one rib of celery, not one stalk.  If you read the plastic bag that celery comes in, you can see that a stalk is the whole thing.  Let the chicken come close to room temp before roasting or else you might have underdone chicken.

Skin was soggy. Yes, the meat was juicy, but not very tasty.  Not worth the calories from the whole stick of butter. Too greasy.

You should make this recipe at least once without modifications.  It was so good, and so easy!  I'll modify later, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!

MMMMMMM.... good!  The secret is don't use light margarine - or anything that's got water in it. I use 1/2 olive oil & 1/2 butter - melted together and then brushed over chicken & splash the rest inside. I add an onion inside with the celery.  Adding any broth or water makes for more stringy, chewy, dry chicken. Also, don't cover it, you don't wanna trap any steam. I cook it low & slow at 325 until the thermometer reads 170-ish deg.  Then take it out to rest & let the temp. rise to 180.  Chicken heaven!  This works with cut up chicken pieces too!

Mine took 3 hours to cook it was then too late in the evening to eat it.  very disappointed.  The chicken needs to be turned during cooking.

I've been making this very same recipe for years. My grandmother was Polish, and she taught me this recipe. I add a bay leaf, a garlic pod, and sometimes a small carrot in the cavity. Thanks for sharing.

Sometimes 'less is more' and with this recipe that certainly is true.  It's the only way I'll roast my chicken now, and the gravy made with the drippings is always awesome!

My own fault for using onion powder; used butter instead of margarine. Anyways, used butter and olive oil and it was good, but onion powder that I bought for this was weak. Next time I'll make my usual chicken roasted with herbs and real garlic, onion and lemon .

This was great! I was amazed by how juicy it actually turned out. Something I did that I think helped the flavor was adding garlic cloves to the cavity, no celery.  On the skin and under the skin of the breast meat I added rosemary and put butter under the skin as well as on the outside. It was just as good, if not better than the rotissere style chickens you can buy at the grocery store. A little more effort, but cheaper!

This is the juciest, most tender chicken my boyfriend and I have ever made. It's a little bland, but next time we make it I will just add some rosemary and garlic cloves under the skin. YUM!

I haven't even used this recipe yet and I already like it. I wish though I could reply to some of these idiotic reviews! You don't use butter, the recipe calls for margarine, it is not the same thing.  If you use butter and complain of it being greasy, blame yourself. By reading the reviews there's a lot of people who can't follow directions. The seasonings are to taste. If you think it's bland, that's your fault too. You didn't use enough. If you used a bigger chicken than the recipe called for and your chicken wasn't done, that's your fault! You cannot cook a 4.5lb or 7lb chicken the same amount of time as a 3lb bird. Let's do the math... If it calls for a 3 pounder to be cooked for 1.5 hours, that's 30 minutes per pound. Adjust your time accordingly. DUH! And to the person who said 180°F was too high and the temp should be lowered to 165°F, oh my gosh, the recipe said 350°F.  DO NOT blame the recipe giver if you didn't follow the recipe! READ PEOPLE! READ! Good grief.

At first glance I was attracted to this roast chicken recipe because of it's simple ingredients and ease of preparation.  I didn't have much time to get this dish together and in the oven.  I didn't have to compromise on taste or moistness because this combination yielded the "juiciest chicken" I ever made according to my Hubs…and I have made a LOT of chicken over the years.  The only thing I adjusted was the cooking time since my chicken was larger than the recipe called for.  Using a meat thermometer will ensure you have fully cooked your chicken.  Thank you for a real keeper.

Yummy, tasty roasted chicken recipe. I didn't have any celery so I used a slice of onion inside, and I basted with 1 TBS more margarine halfway through. I also made sure to lift the skin and put butter and spice mix underneath. It also took 20 minutes more to cook. Delicious!

This was my first time preparing a chicken like this. I followed the direction exactly except I didn't use celery because I normally don't keep it on hand, but I would be willing to use it next time. My husband said this is a keeper! I highly recommend this recipe, make it as is!

Good roast, but no juicier than any other bird I've made. I used butter in lieu of margarine and a lot more seasonings to add more flavor to my gravy. Thanks!

Wow!  This really is as good as everyone says!  When I read the ingredients I thought, "What's the big deal?"  But it was outstanding!  It must be the butter on the inside that makes it so moist.  Yes, I used butter, not margarine, because margarine is very unhealthy so I don't ever use it. People think that margarine is lower in fat than butter, but that's not true--compare the labels.  Plus, margarine contains very unhealthy trans fat, which butter does not.  Anyway, I also used half garlic powder, half onion powder.  (1 1/2 tsp of each.)  Seasoned quite liberally with Kosher salt & pepper.  My chicken was just over 5 lbs so I cooked it for 2 hours on 350 convection, basting once.  Other than that didn't change anything.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was a complete flop. I even took the baked chicken back to the grocery store and got my money back.  I don't understand because I am uually a pretty good cook, at least that is what everyone says. And the chicken would  not cook, and I even tried it in a different oven because I thought it was my oven.  The chicken tasted awful!!!

Sorry guys, I expected a lot more with all of the great reviews.  I just wasn't impressed.  Had a smaller chicken than the recipe called for and I still had to almost double the cook time.  The smell was delicious while it was cooking but when we dug into it, the taste just wasn't spectacular.  I'll stick to my old recipe.

This was outstanding! To get the chicken really browned, I rubbed the butter all over the chicken, which helped it to get crispy on the outside. It was excellent!

Fabulous!  Cooked a 7 lb roaster (about 2 hrs), added more celery and butter and substituted garlic for onion salt.  I'm so happy to finally be able to cook a no-fail juicy tasty chicken.   I will include this recipe in my book if I ever get around to finishing it. THANKS!

Five stars it is.  The simplicity of the recipe piqued my interest.  I indeed followed it word for word- (yes, with margarine) and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about.  Loved it- end of story.  Make it for yourself and see.  Or taste I mean.

The family actually raved about this one, and they are not huge chicken fans.  I too added some lemon and garlic in the cavity.  Made chicken soup with the leftover bird.

This is a good base recipe for a roast chicken. I added red onions in addition to the celery and also threw some paprika over the chicken in addition to the onion powder. Quite juicy and tasty.

Simple and good. What I don't understand about some of the commenters is their complaints. The directions are there. The list of ingredients is there. Why complain as one person did that it didn't turn out well when they admit they didn't follow the directions. Or they changed the ingredients. Or complain they used a bigger bird and it took longer to cook. Of course it took longer fool. 
I make a recipe for the first time I follow the recipe to the T. Now, having made this once I know the next time what I will do differently. One thing is use garlic inside the bird. I'll also probably baste it a few times while it cooks. But the way the recipe stands is just fine.

So I have borrowed many recipes from this site but never bothered to sign up to rate them until now. I have made roasted chicken many ways especially with lemon, garlic and onion in the cavity.  I was tempted to do that but didn't want to be a hypocrite.  So I made it exactly as written...I even bought margarine...which I haven't done in years and the chicken was FABULOUS!!!  My husband & son are the pickiest eaters and use the "jar gravy" with any roasted meats...well not this time.  I didn't even heat the gravy before my 10 year old was shoveling it down.  He wasn't even that hungry and ate most of it.  In fact, he left the potatoes on the plate (as a major carb eater, he never does that)!!  My husband finished his plate (used no gravy) and went to the stove to pick more of the chicken out of the pan!!  I will be definitely adding this to my recipe collection and making again!  What makes this simple recipe so good is the onion powder (flavor) and celery (moisture/juiciness).  Next time I make it, will make sure chicken is room temp, super dry and take my time cooking/resting the bird.  It was late and I rushed it...but chicken was still very juicy!!  For a side, grill some red onions and potatoes in separate pan...awesome combo!

Dry, sawdust chicken has sadly been a common occurrence in my kitchen.  And roasting a whole chicken has been somewhat intimidating. But this recipe has changed all of that.  The recipe is so simple but it resulted in the juciest, most succulent chicken I have ever made. Each bite was pure bliss. If you've ever made sawdust chicken, like me, you'll love this recipe.  Enjoy!!

Great chicken!  For the people who complained about the chicken not being done...increase your cooking time slightly for a larger bird...duh!  This recipe uses a smaller chicken, hence, the lower cooking time.  Following the recipe exactly per the seasonings listed gives you an end product worth five stars.  If you must be one of those who changes recipes, don't tell us.  We don't care.  This recipe is great as is.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  How lucky am I to find the best possible recipe with one search?  I pretty much cooked it as written but I did sprinkle some poultry seasoning over the top.  Next time I may try it with garlic powder instead of onion powder.  Yum!

I made this last night. I usually use a Carousel Rotisserie which sits on the sink but I wanted to see if this way of cooking chicken was better. It was just as good and juicy. I only had to clean up one pan instead of taking appart and cleaning the rotisserie which takes awhile, so thats a plus. I only used 3 tablespoons real butter and one large stick of celery cut into 3 pieces in the cavity. No butter on the outside. Followed directions using all the other ingredients. I always boil the neck in water while the chicken is cooking to add when making my gravy just to make sure I have enough, my husband and I love gravy on our mash potatoes.I made my gravy using the drippings in the pan, the broth I cooked and flour for thickness. This was the best tasting gravy I have ever made before. I am going to put away the rotisserie and never use it again. This is now on my menu list. Thanks for this GREAT RECIPE.

I followed the recipe exactly, and my FIRST EVER roasted chicken came out juicy & delicious. The only thing I would probably do different is add a little less margarine around the chicken. It was very greasy. But this chicken was absolutley DELICIOUS!

I decided to try it exactly as written the first time and it was SUPER GOOD. Then I decided to make it again and I made it EXACTLY LIKE ITS WRITTEN AGAIN.   And this is weird for me because I've baked alot of fancy chicken with alot of varied spices and even Moraccan etc... but I liked it sooooo much that I did it again just the way it's written and I guess that says it all. It's wonderful.  I'm not only going to make chicken this way... but I'll do quite often. Thanks so much to the RobinRockinBabe.

Chicken DID come out juicy but, I didn't do the celery leaves...didn't have them lol  And I didn't have a whole chicken, I had leg quarters.  BUT, the chicken was good.  I added garlic salt as well.  I cooked the quarters ontop of a bed of potatoes...EXCELLENT.  My family loved.

I had given up making roasted chicken years ago, but since finding this site I decided to give it a try. Not only was it by far the best chicken I have ever made it was also the best chicken I have ever had! It was just so easy that I had my doubts. Not only did it come out looking good and smelling good, but it tasted amazing! Can't wait to make it again next week!!

Don't change a thing about this recipe. It's absolutely delicious and moist. I was worried at first, because there are so few ingredients, but there's something to be said for keeping it simple. Thanks.

Fantastic! So good and so tender! Didn't have onion powder so used garlic powder and chopped half an onion up to put in cavity with two chopped celery stalks and butter. Great recipe.

Like many before me, I was amazed at how such a simple recipe ended up being the absolute best roasted chicken I have ever eaten.  I am really happy to have this recipe and will be using it again.  I agree with others who said, even if tempted, DON'T change the recipe.  Cook it exact.  That was very good advice.

Excellent.  The only thing I did differenty was to use a 6 pound chicken and adjusted the ingredients and roasting time accordingly.  Will use this recipe as my standard chicken-roasting method.

This came out pretty good with the butter basting, as I wanted to make just the basic chicken without the vegetables in the roasting pan this time. I needed to increase the cooking time to 1.5 hours though, which seems more standard to me than the 1 hour 15 minutes it stated. My thermometer read 170 degrees at 1 hour 15 minutes. 

I would also add to the instructions to baste one more time just before serving because the meat did get a little dry sitting out for the 30 minutes to rest, but then tasted really good when i put some pan drippings on it later. I didn't use celery because I didn't have any, and I used half a stick of butter which would be about 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2, which made adequate juice and browning.

I also basted mine a few times during cooking because cooking without a cover can dry it out.

used butter of course.  After cooking and basting, I poured the juice into a cast iron skillet, added 1/2 cup of white flour and stirred until browned, then slowly added milk while stirring to make the best gravy yet.

This is a delicious bird!!!!  I made a few changes... I seasoned inside and out with salt and pepper only... then I stuffed the cavity with the celery and 2 carrots.  For the butter, I used my poultry herbed butter; consists of minced garlic, poultry seasoning, and a garlic and herb soup mix!!!  I blend all the flavors with the butter and drop some in the cavity, smear it all on the outside of the bird, as well as under the breast skin!  Beautiful and delicious!  I baste it at about the half hour mark and let her go!!!!

This made the best chicken ever!  I was looking for something that would add flavor to my chicken dumplings so I decided to roast the chicken instead of boiling.  I followed the recipe exactly but I added about 15 minutes to the cook time because my chicken was larger.  I also added thyme and parsley to the salt and pepper.  I hate celery so I skipped that but the chicken was wonderful.  I can't wait to make it again.

This is the best roasted chicken recipe I have used. I made it for my husband's birthday party.  I got so many complements and all the ladies asked me for the recipe.  I totally recommend it. I followed the direction in the recipe except I didn't have powdered onion so put powdered garlic and sliced onions in the cavity.  I also roasted the chicken in the oven for about 2 hours instead of 1 hr and 15 mins.  This is so easy and so delicious!

It's ok, I'd rather use my rotisserie and maple seasoning. I think it's the butter/margarine that makes it so moist. I do the same thing with my turkeys and they always come out moist.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written - and I wasn't nuts about it. It was good, but I couldn't imagine it winning a cooking contest. Good enough for a weeknight dinner, and simple to make, but not something I'd make to wow guests.

YUMMY!! So easy and juicy. I did use garlic powder instead of onion and stuffed some garlic cloves and butter under the skin. I also added a few slices of lemon in the cavity along with the butter and celery. Will make again.

Who knew something this good could be this simple.  Try it as written before you try variations. I did use butter because that was what I had.  The onion powder and celery made the house smell great.  Very juicy chicken.

This is a great basic chicken recipe. I have made this several times, and never the same way twice. I always try different spices and seasonings, whatever sounds good that day.

So good I did use butter and mixed herbs salt and pepper to flavor. I added some stock at the bottom and followed the recipe. Oh wow the taste was amazing. The gravy it made was so good my boyfriend drank it up.. haha I will use this for sure. Thank you so much

Made it again in a different country and have learned that I need one hour and a half then a 30min rest. I am at sea level not sure why it needs more time here. Truth is I also have a new oven could be that as well.

I made this last night. The only thing i did different was rub the chick down with soy. And then rub the spices on it. I added some water in the bottom of the pan & at the end made a delicious gravy w a corn starch slurry. The chix was moist & tender & this is my new way to make chicken. By the way, the soy does NOT make the chicken too salty.

I cooked the bird breast-side down, added some myer lemon into the cavity and it turned out fabulous! We couldn't "find' the breast back at first, since I forgot I had cooked the thing upside down, but once we did....YUM. 
Boiled down the leftover bones for stock and had plenty left for a tasty soup the next day. $3 chicken: 3 great meals!

Had chicken leg quarters on hand. Made a bed of thick sliced onions & celery. Rubbed legs w/ recommended spices, covered w/ more sliced onions and cooked @ 375 for about 1 hour. Put chopped yams, potatoes, carrots, & garlic cloves mixed in kosher salt and EVO in two other pans in the same oven. Everything came out at the same time and dinner was served! Chicken was moist and delicious! Drippings would have made awesome gravy.

This is the juiciest roast chicken I have ever made. Even the leftover is still very tasty and full of flavor. I roasted my chicken as the recipe stated and I stuffed my chicken's cavity with a lemon, celery and an onion. The gravy is so good. My husband gave this recipe 5 stars! Thanks for sharing :)

I don't really like chicken, so I begrudgingly made roasted chicken at my husband's request. This was really good and I am near impossible to please when it comes to chicken. This chicken was SO juicy. We stuffed ours with celery, onion, and garlic. Yum! Next time we will add some more seasoning, but I can't dock the recipe, since seasoning is all a matter of preference. This chicken was so easy, it tastes like it took a lot more effort than it really did. My husband loved this chicken, I've never seen him attack roasted chicken quite like this. =) 

If you're looking for a delicious, fool-proof recipe, this is the one! 

(It did take a little longer than the hour and fifteen the recipe calls for, so I highly recommend a meat thermometer. It's a life saver!)

When I am cooking, there is not much that upsets me more then when I find a consistently high rated recipe that I am excited about, prepare it exactly as directed, and am completely underwhelmed by the result.
That was the case here. The chicken was juicy, yes, but completely bland. I also had to cook it for over 2 hours!! The cooking time is not long enough. The skin did not get crispy and was lacking flavor as well. This recipe was not good enough to justify all of the fat (1 stick of margarine!)called for, and I will not use again. Sorry:(((. Roast chicken rotisserie style from this site is much, much better.

Made this for Easter and everyone enjoyed it.  Did not have onion powder, used garlic powder instead.  I would add some more seasonings to it next time.

When I first read this recipe I thought to myself... who needs a recipe for roast chicken! Aparently I did because it was the best chicken I have ever made. I have been cooking for 30 years and this was by far the best chicken ever. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and am very glad I did. If you have tried this before and added your own touches... please try it again as written! It's wonderful!

WOW!  This chicken was SO easy to prepare, very moist, and VERY flavorful.  I won't roast a chicken in any other way in the future.  Few small changes:  I lightly buttered the skin of the whole chicken first.  Also, since I had no onion powder, I used garlic salt instead with great results.  Lastly, I put half a red onion, and a few cloves of garlic in the cavity with the celery.  Delicious recipe.  Highly recommended!

PEOPLE, please try a recipe as written before rating it.  Make changes after you try it if you want to post suggestions to the recipe.  I agree with the other reviews about this.  This recipe is simple and SO very good.  I followed as written and will replace all my roasted chicken recipes  with just this one.  IF I make some changes I'll let you know how it compares.  Please follow this example!  EXCELLENT as written!!

Recipe was absolutely perfect. The only thing I omitted was onion powder (because I didn't have any), but it still turned out perfectly seasoned and delicious. I also cooked the chicken breast down (complete accident) so it turned out incredibly juicy. We will definitely be making this again!!

New to the site, and new to the real world (living in my own place for the 1st time with my sweetie!) and had a nice farm chicken from family on a farm in Altoona PA.  Never roasted a bird on my own before (other than helping on Thanksgiving holiday) and wanted to do something with the whole chicken.  I found this recipe and saw how simple it was and sounded tasty, so decided to give it a go, and I'm really proud of how it came out for my first try!  I did put my own lil flavor add to it since I have some whole garlic, and read that paprika browns chicken nicely, so added that to the seasonings.  I did find as one post mentions, that cook time was too short, but I was determined and hungry lol, and another hour or so I had a great meal.  Thank you for sharing this!

I am amazed at how delicious this was for so few ingredients!  Juicy, tasty, minimal prep time - just such a great recipe that reminds me of the roasted chicken I had while living in France.  This is my go-to for roasted chicken!  Excellent.

Juiciest chicken I have ever made...must be something with the celery sticks because I have put other items (lemons, onions, etc) in the chicken cavity and never had it come out as good.  I made it on a cast iron skillet with onion and potatoes in it. Placed chicken right on top of the veggies.  Also used real butter...margarine is going to kill you way before the real stuff does. 

One note on cook temp -  I cooked until chicken was 160 degrees, which was right at about 1 hr and 15 mins.  Chicken is good at 165 degrees.  If you pull it out at 160, it will still cook and get up to 165.  I check this using a meat thermometer to be 100%.

Delicious, tender, tasty, super juicy, easy peasy roasted chicken. This was so tender that it fell right off the bone when I was saving the leftovers for another meal. I used kosher salt and a good Tablespoon's worth (maybe a bit more) and mixed the salt, pepper, and onion powder together and went from there. The onion powder gave this a really good flavor and I loved how simple and delicious this is. I had a 4.5 lb. chicken, used salted butter, and roasted it for a total of 1 hr and 45 minutes covering the top loosely with a piece of aluminum foil when it started looking golden brown. I let this stand for almost 45 minutes while preparing the sides and this was such a moist juicy tender chicken. I love this recipe and we loved this meal! Thanks so much.

Like many other reviewers, I found the cooking time to be inaccurate on this recipe. Allowing the chicken to rest for 30 minutes (as indicated in the recipe) just gave it enough time to turn gelatinous, fatty, buttery. Very disappointed.

I make this chicken all the time - sometimes as-is, sometimes adding a bit of onion and a garlic clove into the cavity with the celery.  The celery is a must.  I use butter instead of margarine as it is a far healthier fat.  The resulting gravy is amazing, every time. For people complaining about times - get an instant read meat thermometer. It is a wonderful kitchen tool!

I started it at 450 for 15 minutes and then dropped it to 350 for another hour and a half. It was so juicy I actually worried it was undercooked. The skin wasn't quite as crispy as I like, but it was still good. Solid recipe!

Not good - I followed recipe but knew tenting w/ foil would produce steamed chicken, not roasted. Barbara Kafka's book on how to roast various meats and poultry is excellent.

My hubby said that this was the best roast chicken ever!  It ruined El Pollo Loco for him.  Costco chickens are great, but be sure to increase the cooking time as these tend to be bigger birds.  I've been making this roast chicken recipe for years and it comes out perfect each time.  I have modified the recipe a bit for ease.  Once your chicken is cleaned and rinsed, pat dry.  Rub with olive oil and sprinkle a Greek rub or whatever floats your boat.  I use a stick of real butter that I cut into 6 pieces.  Two squares go into the cavity, along with 2 sprigs rosemary and celery.  The rest of the butter goes under the skin at the top and the bottom of the breast along with additional rosemary.  Perfect!

Awesome!! Recipe came out incredibly juicy just as the title states. My family picked this chicken clean!! The only change I made was to use butter in place of the margarine. Loved this recipe and will be making it again soon!! Thanks for sharing:)

i used a 5 1/4 lb chicken and stuffed it with butter, celery and onion. I put celery,onion,and potatoes with butter around the chicken and cooked it for 2 1/2 hours. Next time I'll add the veggies later.  The chicken itself was super juicy and tender. My uber picky 10 year old even said wow you can really cook a chicken mom!

THE EASIEST, BEST GO-TO RECIPE for roasted chicken on Allrecipes.com.  I've made it a half-dozen times and it ALWAYS comes out perfect.  375 for 1hour and 15 minutes and it's done.

For those have complained it was too greasy, that's not the butter, it's the type (brand) of chicken you buy. Not all chickens are created equal.  Also, if it's dry, I would guess two things, you over cooked it opposed to letting it sit with the oven off to finish cooking, or you stabbed it so many times checking for clear juices that it dried out.  This is on the menu for tonight.  Love roasted chicken....

I made this chicken last night and it was everyting that I thought it would be...so jucy...so tender...so
yummy.  I just added a few things.  I put a few fresh sage leaves inside and put some butter and
parsley under the skin.  I can't wait to make it again.  It is a wonderful recipe. THANKS!

Hubby & I got tired of the store cooked chickens.  We could both detect a chemical--or something.  This is just like my grandma used to make--with real butter.  Thanks for the great reminder!  Simply put--simple is the best!

Delicious!  I had a 6lb bird so it took awhile longer, but that's to be expected.  I coated inside & out with pepper, salt & onion powder.  In addition to the celery in the cavity, I also added about 5 cloves of garlic.  The garlic is the only thing I added that was not in the original recipe.  This was incredibly moist, the drum sticks literally fell apart.  Pulled all the remaining meat, will use that for some chicken & dumplings.  Boiled the drippings, bones, skin, celery & garlic for some amazing chicken broth.

I'm a big believer in using only real foods so I switched the margarine for butter. I also used a little rosemary in the cavity. It was an awesome roast chicken and I can't wait to make it again. The only thing I'll do differently next time is put a little foil over it towards the end of cooking. I cook my bird breast side down so all the juices make the breast juicier, but in this case my wings and legs got a little crisp and dry, so the foil will prevent that! Yummy. I made stock with the bones last night and I'll make soup with the stock and leftovers today.

This chicken is the best baked chicken I have ever had! This chicken was TERRIFIC.  This recipe is a keeper.  The bird was moist, and tasted GREAT.  I used the recipe except I added a sprinkling of rosemary inside & out.  WOW.

OMG that was good! I did as much as I could according to the recipe...I didn't have onion powder so I used onion soup mix, and I used butter not margarine. I used a meat thermometer and what's weird is that the timer for the temperature and time went off at the exact same time! Great recipe, keeper for sure.

Sometimes you just want a simple roast chicken without all kinds of added flavorings. This fits the bill perfectly. I did brine it for 4 hours ahead of time, but it probably wasn't even needed. (Simple Chicken Brine on this site.)
Excellent bird.

I made this to night with the addition of garlic powder, I also used butter instead of marg. It was very tender and had a good flavor. I may have added to much kosher salt to the chicken cause the gravy that I made from the pan drippings was a little to salty for my and my family taste (still good just a smidge to salty) which is entirely my fault for being to handed with it. Will deff. make again

Added a little garlic powder and paprika;the juiciest chicken I've ever had.Spend the 5 bucks and buy a meat thermometer.All ovens are different and all birds a different sizes.The meaty part of the thigh was 165 when I took it out;wrapped in tinfoil for 30 min. , it will cook a little more but it doesn't matter if you wait 45 or an hour.

I don't know whether it was the celery, the margarine (I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter), the spices (I added 1 Tablespoon of garlic powder), the cooking temp/time, the basting & resting under foil before carving...whatever it was, this was one juicy & delicious chicken! I might even say the best chicken I've ever roasted! Seriously, I wish I could eat the whole chicken by myself!!

If brining, go easy on the salt, or skip salting the chicken altogether.  This is an excellent recipe.

My family and I absolutly LOVE this recipe!! The chicken always comes out perfect.Only thing I change is I add more spices, Adobo, Seasonal, and salt and pepper. I also have to bake my chicken a little longer, but that's how my oven cooks. If you haven't tried this recipe yet you're really missing out!!

This was great.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out wonderfully.  For those of you who need to fiddle with a recipe to make it your own, (I'm one myself), there's no need with this recipe.  It's perfect as is. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe when you're pinched for time. I'd previously made the roasted "sticky" chicken recipe with lots of great reviews but I didn't have 5 hours to spare.....and this one certainly did the trick. I butterfly'd a 5 lb chicken to have it cook faster (a tip from my sister-in-law) and added baby carrots around which got a nice flavoring from the melted butter. I put the celery right underneath the split. It came out very tasty and made for great left overs.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was the most delicious homemade chicken I've ever made. The meat was so tender it literally fell off the bones! It was incredibly juicy and I made the roasted red potatoes as a side dish with a small side salad. It was such a hit that my kids want me to make it again. Very economical, easy, and delicious!

Very juicy chicken and good flavor.  Too much margarine for my liking as I wanted to use the drippings for gravy and it made a very greasy gravy.  For the chicken itself, it was very good!

I have actually made this chicken and I don't know if it is the celery stalks, but it is very moist.  I surround the base of it with cut up carrots, onions, and baby potatoes. It smells wonderful when it is cooking.

I made this exactly as indicated (except that I didn't have celery so I made it w/o the celery). I turned up the oven to 375 degrees in convection mode to try to speed it up some. This roasted chicken recipe is AMAZING! I can't believe I'd stopped making roasted chicken myself since rotisserie chicken has become available at the grocery stores. This is SO much better. Great recipe!

Pretty good. I love how moisted the chicken came out but I wish it had more flavor. I put a lot of salt and pepper and onion powder on the outide and inside but it still needed salt. The celery didn't help with the flavor but I do think it helped keep the bird moist. I also rubbed olive oil on the outside. I put cubed up potatoes on the bottom of the pan along with carrots (tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary) those came out delish!

Whoa!! My wife loves dark meat and I love White (Jack Sprat …) and I do the cooking … definitely the bestest, juiciest chicken ever … I used garlic salt and lemon pepper instead, stuffed it with mushrooms instead of celery, and cooked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. Awesome!! Better than Costco's rotisserie chicks and that's sayin' somethin'!

A marvelous recipe that we enjoyed, my daughter is allergic to dairy so it was wonderful finding this recipe.  We then used the leftovers to make a wonderful soup.

Juicy, like it says.  Added sliced garlic under skin and inside.  Roasted with red potatoes and pearl onions (that I had on hand).

I have used this recipe several times.  It always comes out great.  I often add veges to roast with it.  I use organic butter and chicken.  I rate recipies based on taste -not on personal diet preferences and beliefs.  I personally have no need to count calories, but I do change recipies that use chemically treated ingredients.  I do not, however, lower my rating based on those personal choices.  This chicken is the best and easiest Sunday chicken recipe in my recipe box!

The secret is what you DON'T add to a recipe. Most tend to over season food thinking it will taste better. However some times less is more. I used kosher salt, be GENEROUS.

Bland. I was very generous with the salt and pepper and onion powder. Apparently it wasn't good enough to penetrate the meat. This recipe would do better if you quartered an onion and shoved it in the carcass. I mean, why wouldn't you use real onion vs onion powder?! Meat was not fall off the bone and that is a prime requisite for baked/rotisserie chicken for me. Needs more time than 1:15. There are much better recipes here... but what do I know... this is 5 stars for most people, right?...  :/   Disappointing. This chicken is now soup material.

This was probably the juiciest chicken ever!  I followed the directions to a T.. didn't change a thing except I had an 8 pound chicken and it took 3 hours to cook... but I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

Just made this and I liked it because the recipe was simple and direct. Moist and now the possibilities are endless. 

I finally have a basic recipe to build on and now understand what needs to happen to make a juicy bird. Next time I will try lemons!

This was by far the best chicken I have ever made, to say it was tasty or juicy would be an understatement. My family loved it!! I will make this again and again.  I made the best chicken gravy we have ever had!! Yummy flavor that can't be beat the only thing I did different was to use butter instead of margarine. Awesome!! Must try!!

I have been roasting chickens once a week for years, and this recipe seemed too ridiculously simple to be that good... well... my family said, and I quote "mommy, this is the juiciest chicken you've ever made"  I have to agree! Does the celery add moisture? I even reduced the butter and it was dripping with juice. Simply genius.

Simple and great.  I don't know why roasting a whole chicken seems initimidating -- if you use Robin's recipe - you really can't go wrong.  We prefer more seasonings, so we added garlic and stuffed the cavity with some fresh minced garlic and a whole onion, quartered.  Just tweak the seasonings to your own personal tastes.  It comes out tender and juicy every time!

This chicken was the BEST I've ever made/eaten at home. The dark meat was awesome. My 2 & 4 yr old finished their portions and asked for seconds!! The white was a little over cooked at 1 hr 15 min, as the recipe said. But, I think our oven cooks a little hot. The only change I made was I only used 1 stick plus 3 T butter, instead of 1/2 cup margarine.

I think this recipe is good on the basis that it tells me HOW to cook a whole chicken. However, very basic...definitely boring and plain as written. You really need more spices and herbs to kick it up a notch. We stuffed the chicken, which was good and covered it in seasoning salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, and paprika. The bird came out moist and delicious. We even boiled down the carcass and made soup the next day.

I have to admit that I wasn't expecting this a lot from this recipe but, I went ahead and tried it because of it's simplicity and it's many rave reviews. Much to my surprise however, it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I added about a teaspoon of Greek seasoning and used a cooking bag. This was one of the best chickens I have ever tasted. My family devoured it.Go ahead and try it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

I just made this recipe for dinner tonight. DELICIOUS!!! I have roasted chickens in the past, and I always say I will never bother again. I had to try this because it seemed so simple. This is the easiest roasted chicken recipe and by far the best I have ever tried.

In the cavety I put 3 celery stalks (chopped), bay leaf, garlic cloves, butter, celery seed & onion powder.  I pulled back the skin from the breast and added butter, and sprinkled the seasonings.  I also spread the skin with margarine and the seasoning.  Very good!  And a beautiful presentation.

I made this recipe exactly, not matter how much I wanted to add garlic. I cooked it breast-side down for the first hour, then flipped and followed the foil directions when I took it out of the oven. This was the most moist chicken ever! Even more moist than beer butt chicken. Sometimes simple is best. This was no-fuss and tasted awesome. I will definitely make this again.

I gave it a four because it has a great flavor and is very simple to make. However, I'm used to wads of flavor with my roast chicken. This recipe pairs very nicely with the carrot raisin recipe and Navajo bread recipes on this site. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is so easy and so good. I added a little chicken broth to the pan and then followed the recipe exactly. Even my bro-in-law who isn't fond of chicken liked it. Everyone else raved and asked for it again. I had a 5 lb chicken so I baked it 1 hour and about 40 minutes until it was done then basted and covered and let stand 30 minutes. YUM

this is now our favorite way to cook chicken - added garlic powder - 5lb bird takes apr 1 hour & 45 mins at 350 plus 30 minutes at 400 to crisp - recipe calls for celery & we add it - not sure what it does? we normally are very fond of the white meat,but this is so tender - leftovers make very good shredded chicken enchiladas

4.5!  Very good, moist, tender, tasty, and delicious!  I think there are two keys to this recipe: the butter/margarine, and letting it rest for 20-30 minutes.  I seasoned it to my family's liking: garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion powder, poultry seasoning.  This is my new go-to for baking a whole chicken.  :O)

I followed this recipe to a "T," and got a tasty chicken, but no one in my family thought it was any better than other roasted chickens that we've had.  Bottom line: there is nothing wrong with this recipe at all, but it didn't have the "wow" factor that I was expecting based on the reviews.

This easily gets 5 stars for being moist and juicy.... However, I think it needs more flavor. (All we could taste was the onion powder.) Next time, I'll use 1/2 Tbsp. onion powder, and add 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, plus 1/2 to 1 tsp. crushed thyme and/or rosemary, in addition to the salt and pepper.

I will never cook a chicken in the slow cooker again!!  This was fabulous...so tender and moist!! Had to use garlic powder as I had no onion powder.  Will try onion powder next time.  Even my 3 year old (who seems to only like peanut butter at the moment) was asking for more!! So simple even my husband said he could do this...WOW!!

We really enjoyed this chicken. It is definitely juicy as the name states. I even over baked mine because I had to pick my son up after school and forgot to leave instructions on what to do with the chicken. I was surprised it was so juicy. Very simple yummy recipe. Thanks.

I made this chicken for the guys at the office at they all cleaned their plates.  I used large pieces of split chicken breast so that all portions would be the same.  Great, easy recipe.  Don't change a thing!

I have tried many roast chicken recipes and this is the best (though truthfully, I used garlic instead of onion powder and used lemon quarters in and around the chicken as well).

Like the recipe says this is a moist chicken, however, it is a bit greasy. Te chicken skin contains fat that is rendered, then when you add the oleo (or butter, if you prefer) it makes for alot of fat. Delicious, oh yes. But too much fat. I think I'll try olive oil for a better ingredient.

Let me just say: I am a terrible cook. But I used this recipe for a dinner with friends, and was able to trick them into thinking I'm the best chef ever! It was so simple to do, yet SO juicy and delicious! I've never had chicken that good in my life!

This was an easy recipe resulting in a juicy roast chicken.  I used garlic salt instead of onion powder and butter in place of margarine.  I think next time I'll use half the amount of butter because there was just too much floating around the pan for my family's preference.

This is an excellent roast chicken recipe.  If you happen to be out of celery,  you can stuff with onion, orange, etc.  Anything that has a lot of moisture will work.  Very easy and very good.

This was my very first ever roasted chicken and I was so proud how it turned out! I used real butter-I don't ever use margarine-and maybe next time will take the advice of another reviewer and use half as much. I did add some onion and garlic inside it, that is only changes I made. I cooked breast side down-never done this chicken thing before-but then read on here someone did that to make the breast meat juicier, and it appears to have worked. My mom and husband loved it, there just wasn't enough left over. This was so easy I can't wait to cook it again.

I don't know what does it but, this was the juiciest and most tasteful roaster chicken I've ever made.  I did add a onion to the cavity along with the celery.  The roaster I made was almost 5 lbs. and it cooked in 2 hours and 15 min.  I also let it sit for about 30 minutes wrapped in foil.  The chicken came out hot.  Even the kids loved it

This is foolproof. lol its like "Chicken for Dummies". I usually add whatever I have on hand and stuff it in the cavity: either onions, celery, apples, fresh herbs... you get the idea. It's nearly impossible to mess this one up! :) Instead of just "arranging" the butter around the exterior of the chicken, I mixed some extra onion powder in with the butter and rubbed it under the skin. The skin will already crisp on its own without the additional butter. By rubbing the butter compound on the meat it produced a perfectly moist bird!

This recipe is so simple and turns out GREAT!!! Very juicy. I followed the recipe but added some extras. I added a half of an onion to the cavity. I sprinkled it with garlic powder along with the salt/pepper. I used shed spread for my margarine. I think covering it for 30 minutes after it is out of the oven is the key to the juiciness.

Juicy and very tasty!!  This was the first time I ever roasted a whole chicken.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook on a rack in the roasting pan, but I did.  I added a few changes as I was feeling a bit creative.  I filled the cavity with garlic cloves, onions and carrots and put extra onions, carrots and celery in the bottom of the pan with some white wine.  I poured melted butter over the top of the chicken and then put it in the oven to bake.  I basted the chicken every 30-60 minutes while baking.  It was moist and very tasty!  I served the chicken with two side dishes from this website:  Pumpkin Casserole and Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad.  Yummy!!

Juicy but bland as a vaseline sandwich.  The recipe poster said people go silent when eating this, I have to wonder why they wouldn't.  In my family it's considered rude to talk with food in your mouth, just a thought.

The taste was so blah that I cut the meat up and used it on grilled pizzas with pine nuts, garlic, feta and yellow tomatoes.  The rest went into asian chicken noodle soup.

All in all this is a basic recipe for cooked chicken, something that a home ec class would make.  It reminds me of the stuff my great grandmother would eat, although, even she would have added a sprig of parsley or some carrots to this.

Absolutely, super moist, tasty, perfect chicken!  At first, the amount of butter and thoughts of using salt "generously" frightened me, but I couldn’t criticize a recipe if I didn’t prepare it like the original.  So the first time, I made the chicken EXACTLY as the recipe states and it tasted perfect.  The second time, I replaced the onion powder with garlic powder and reduced the butter by two tablespoons.  It still came out great and made me feel better about the reduced amount of butter.  My only true suggestion is to make two, one just isn't enough.

My, oh, MY -- this is the most amazingly juicy and tender chicken I have ever had! I seriously cannot remember eating a breast from a roast chicken that was this succulent (and decadent!). I'm floored! I will never buy another store-bought rotisserie chicken again...EVER!

Really smells wonderful while cooking. I decided to throw in quartered red potatoes, baby carrots, halved onion, with it for an one-dish meal. My chicken/oven took longer to cook (2-1/2 hours)probably because of the veggies aadded, but not sure. I did loosely  "tent" with foil, for the veggies to cook. Left foil off last 15 minutes. It should have been longer, as the chicken didn't brown much. Didn't affect the moist and yummy flavor though!

Embarrassed to say, but I'm 40 years old and this is my very first baked chicken!  Anyway, wanted you to know that my family loves your recipe!!!  

As a vegetarian (I don't eat chicken), I really appreciated the recipe because it was so simple and I didn't have to handle the bird much to make it.  

It's nice that you posted a recipe that is so good and easy to make that I have confidence serving it to my family even though I can't taste-test it first!

We really enjoyed this chicken. I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of using a bit less butter. I skimmed the fat off of the broth and made a delicious graby to accompany it.

I have been roasting chicken wrong all these years.  I used to cover it first and then uncover to brown.  Clearly by browning first, the juices get sealed in.  My chicken was just oozing with juice when I cut into it.  I will always use this method from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.

I, too, must give this chicken 5 stars. Very juicy and so easy. I also put onion inside the chicken and rubbed the skin with olive oil first. I added seasonings such as thyme and seasoned pepper. The cook can play with the seasonings and enjoy the result. This will be my roast chicken preference now.

Well this certainly was simple! And it surely was wonderful! So it must have been Simply Wonderful!;) Great taste, great presentation, great everything! The only changes I made were minor. I rubbed a ton of REAL butter on the exterior (as well as under the skin)of the bird then also sprinkled garlic powder with the onion powder.  I also stuffed a few carrots in the cavity with the celery. Next time I'll try adding fresh onion and fresh garlic in the cavity as well. Maybe even a lemon!
The leftover carcass (not that there was much meat left) is also headed right for the crockpot to make Slow Cooker Chicken Broth also found on this site. Thanks for this great contribution! :)

YUM!  I followed recipe to a T.  I first brushed some olive oil all over the bird and seasned it with poultry seasoning, garlic powder and salt and lemon pepper.  I also added some cloves of garlic and tucked them in the bird, and around the wings and legs.  Very tender and juicy, had tons of leftovers and made a casserole dish the next day with leftovers thanks!

Yum! I had to substitute butter because I didn't have margarine but otherwise, I followed the recipe. Prepared this way, the chicken really does turn out juicy and flavorful with a minimum of fuss. I served it with Glazed Dijon Carrots (from Allrecipes), rolls and buttered egg noodles with snipped fresh basil for a delicious dinner. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The standing joke in our house is my roast chicken. Even with a meat thermometer and enough butter to chocke your arteries my chicken is always well done and dry. I have finally broken the curse. This chicken is so flavorful and moist. I used butter( we just prefer the taste). I also put extra garlic in the cavity. I can't wait to make this again, maybe nest time I will put some lemon zest and parsley in with my butter rub.

I don't know if I have anything new to add here but I just loved this chicken.  Like the others, I quartered half a lemon, and put that in the cavity along with the celery.  My chicken was bigger than the one called for in this recipe, but even with a longer time in the oven it still turned out incredibly juicy!  I will use this recipe a lot - it's delicious!

Juiciest chicken I have ever had.  I didn't add the celery but I did stick garlic and lemon into the cavity and added garlic salt and paprika to the skin.  It took exactly 90 mins for my chicken to reach 180 and I let it sit in the foil for 20 mins.  It was the most delecious chicken I have had.

This was the first roasted chicken I tried on my own, and it was fabulous!  The skin turned a nice brown and was crunchy, but inside was wonderfully moist and juicy!! Will definitely have again.  Thanks!!

I signed up with allrecipes just to leave a review. Yeah, it was THAT good and THAT simple. I can't tell you how many roasted chickens I've made in my adult life - so many different methods, cooking times, cooking temps...this one is IT. Forever! 

I made two roasted chickens on a rack, side by side (I buy them from Costco and makes meal prep real easy). I cooked at 350 for 2 hours. I didn't have time to baste, and that did not effect the juiciness or flavor. 

Wonderful and simple! My entire family ate it up, and that includes two very finicky kids who usually complain that even the juciest cuts of any meat are "dry". It passed the test!  Thank you!!

Did this German grandma have a stove that was 100 degrees off? Was she cooking pheasants? I have a small chicken here and it has rested for 35 minutes for me to find out it is NOT DONE. DO NOT come upon this recipe thinking, oh this is different. Oh, this has a few thousand good reviews.....this is NOT good. This recipe is not for roasting chicken.

Absolutely awful. Very little flavor. I'm an intermediate to advanced cook, read the ingredients...delved deeper into the comments and could not have been more disappointed after I made it. Do NOT count über-butter as "flavor". I suggest a hatd-pass on this one. The only recipe over 10 years on Allrecipes to disappoint with so many rave reviews and stars.

The cooking time of 1 hour 15 minutes is NOT long enough to bring a fully thawed whole chicken to 180F degrees internal temperature. It was about 150F, which is not a safe temperature (165F) for chicken. It needed to be baked for another 30 minutes at least.

I normally read all reviews before executing the cooking process.  Unfortunately I did not and mussed the information for cooking time in the negative review.  It took another 1 hr and 20 minutes in the oven /microwave.  Next time I will read reviews so that my guests will not have to wait!!

I made the recipe exactly as written, because I like to do that first, and respect the cook who posted it. I often do add my own "touches" later, but always try the recipe as is first. And yes, exactly as written, this chicken is totally tender and delicious. Simple yet totally flavorful and juicy. Like many other readers, I sometimes add extra herbs, or cook the chicken in a roasting pan with potatoes, carrots, onions, etc. I have also found that using clarified butter instead of margarine works fine too. Regular butter tends to burn because of the milk solids, but clarified works nice. A slice of citrus in the cavity with the celery adds a nice touch, like orange or lemon. Wrapping the wing tips and drumstick ends in foil before putting in the oven keeps them from burning and drying out. 

But again - just as written, this chicken is top notch!

I have tried SO many roast chicken recipes, and this is by far the best I have ever had. I have returned to this recipe time and time again, as it is simply wonderful and always a crowd pleaser. I use kerrygold salted instead of margarine and use just a bit more celery than suggested (mostly because the celery makes a lovely little snack), and it is just the juciest chicken I have ever had. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Tried this recipe twice. The second time I tried extending the cook time by twenty minutes and flipping the chicken. Both times the chicken was no where near cooked. Be weary of the sugggested cook time. Both of my chickens required over two hours of cooking.

I am an excellent cook, get rave reviews on my cooking, am asked frequently for my recipes,  and have  been cooking  over  40 years. I say all that NOT to brag, but for whoever happens to read this review will know my frame of reference and understand I am not new to cooking. I read a review on this recipe that said her chicken was not done after 75 minutes so I set the oven at 375 for 75 minutes. Chicken was NOT done and dry.  I followed the recipe to a tee. Switched my oven  to convection bake for 20 more minutes. Sadly, I do NOT recommend this recipe to anyone.  Normally I roast my chicken in a cooking bag for 60 minutes @ 350 and it ALWAYS   comes out tender, moist, and full of  flavor.

I've been cooking for over fifty years. I don't know how many chickens I've roasted over the years, but this is the best yet. It was moist, tender and flavorful. I prepared it exactly as written, except we don't use margarine, so I substituted butter. I tied the legs together and stuck a skewer in the opening of the cavity to close it. Since it was a 5.5 lb bird I roasted it for a little over two hours. I love finding a recipe that requires ingredients I already have on hand and this one fits the bill.

Making this recipe was the first time I've ever roasted a chicken, and I am blown away. I followed this recipe exactly except that I used butter instead of margarine (I don't cook with margarine), I put some  of the butter underneath the skin of the chicken on the breast, and instead of following a time for the cooking,  I used an instant read thermometer to tell me when the chicken was at 165 degrees fahrenheight. My oven runs really hot and the skin and drippings were a little toasty by the end, but this is seriously the most moist chicken I have ever had, and the skin was so flavorful!

I deglazed the pan with a little dry sherry and then scraped up the fond and put these drippings into a saucepan with some whole milk and flour to make a delicious gravy. I served the chicken with Crash Hot Potatos from The Pioneer Woman and Oven-Roasted Asparagus from this site. I love this recipe and will use it often!

I was skeptical at first because the ingredient list was so simple but when I first try a recipe I like to follow it exactly and if anything  I will modify it the next time. I am happy to say that this ingredient list does not need to be modified. I subbed in butter for the margarine but that's it! This chicken is delicious and juicy and my whole family (hubby, kids, mom-in-law) love it. I always use this recipe to make roasted chicken. I probably made it about 50 times by now. One thing is that the cooking time may vary depending if your chicken was thawed from frozen, or the size of your chicken. I usually check the chicken after the time specified in the recipe and sometimes I end up cooking it longer (30 - 45 min).

The chicken smelled wonderful while it was baking...my husband came in the door from work and commented on the delicious smell. After the 30 minutes was over, my husband to cut into the chicken. Due to the blood seeping from the meat after it was cut...it probably could have used another hour in the oven. Internal temp on the bird was at 152 degrees after resting. I will try the recipe again, but I will do some adjusting with the time.

Unfortunately, I have to join the select few who were not impressed with this recipe. First of all it was not done even after an hour and a half. Secondly it was very bland. Should have just made it my own way.

Simply outstanding!  I never knew it could be SO EASY to make a roast chicken.  I had two chickens thawed and ready to roast and tried this recipe; it blew us away!! We were both moaning as we were eating it! lol! It was perfect!!!  The skin was crisp and the meat was juicy.  I used kosher salt and organic cultured BUTTER and followed the recipe to the "t".  Awesome!! Scrumptious!!  Definitely a keeper!  We'll be eating a lot more roasted chicken around here!!  Thank YOU RockinRobinBird for sharing!!!

This was by far the best baked whole chicken recipe I've tried! So juicy and wonderful with crispy skin. I followed the directions to a T. The only substitution I made was to use real butter versus margarine. It was fantastic!! Also, I had to cook it a bit longer than instructed. Overall a great 5 star recipe!

Great Easy Recipe!  I accidentally cooked it breast side down and I think it kept the breast meat juicier and more tender!  I'll cut down on the margarine next time, but definitely a keeper!  I cooked 2 5 lb chickens in an 11x17 pan for 1 hr 45 min.  Perfectly cooked!

I had a 7lb chicken and needed a recipe that would result in tender and juicy.  Thank goodness I found this recipe!  I followed the instructions exactly.  Since I had a 7lb chicken, it took around 2 hours to cook in a 350 degree oven. Everyone loved it! My 9 year old said, "This chicken doesn't need any ketchup!"  She always puts ketchup on chicken.  Not this time!  Husband loved it, too.  Even the wings were juicy.  He said,  "they taste better than Hooters!"  Without a doubt, this was the best roast chicken I ever made, will definitely roast chicken this way again.  Thank you for this truly great recipe!

I almost never buy whole chickens because I don't know what to do with them other than make soup in my pressure cooker.  For some reason I was craving roasted chicken, so I bought a 5+ pounder, then found this recipe.  So easy, no chopping of a copious amount of vegetables (I managed to cut up the celery stalk -- LOL), and OMG, so SO good!  One pan, 2 hours in the oven (mine was 5 lbs., not 3), and it was delicious.  I even managed to carve it (sort of).  My kids loved it, and it wasn't nearly as salty as the store-bought rotisserie chickens that I normally buy if going for a whole chicken.  Will definitely make again!  I altered the recipe only slightly -- sprinkled with garlic powder and paprika on top before roasting, but because we don't eat the skin, I don't think it made much difference.  My only reason for only 4 stars was I was unprepared for how much juice pours out of the cavity when starting to carve (is it all the butter?) so made a huge mess all over my cutting board/counter/floor.  Ugh.  BUT, worth it!

I didn't have margarine or butter, so I used olive oil instead. The skin was so crispy and the chicken was really moist. I did an 1hr 40 min for a 5lb chicken.

We have this AT LEAST every couple of weeks. I basically follow it exactly and my family (3 yr old and 7 yr old loves and devours this every time.  I use whatever is leftover and make chicken salad which is also amazing with this chicken. 100 stars in my book!  There is something magical to this recipe because it seems impossible to overcook. For a regular size chicken I set it for abt 1 hr 45 min and check the temp and go from there.

This was my first time cooking a whole chicken. I was looking for something easy and this recipe was it. My husband and I were very impressed with this recipe as written, will definitely make again! Thank you for sharing.

The preparation instructions here are great, but the recipe seems to have a major flaw: if you actually cook it til the internal temp reaches 180, the bird becomes terribly overcooked and dry. Only after making it this way did I look around the web for what other respectable sites are recommending for internal temperature - and the USDA recommends 160. Many say they take it out at 150 or even sooner, b/c the poultry will keep cooking in residual heat. I will try it again and this time call it done sooner.

Omg. Like everyone else, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. THIS CHICKEN IS FANTASTIC! I used creole seasoning just because I'm a southern gal and seasoned salt is life, basically. So I didn't sprinkle the bird with onion powder because the seasoning contains that, but stuffed half an onion into the cavity with the celery. I roasted uncovered for an hour and then covered and baked for an additional 45 mins or so until I reduced oven temp to Warm. This was my first roast chicken, but it will forever be my go-to recipe. Simple yet delicious! Thank you!

Worked out real well. I was scared that the bird would dry out because it was cooked uncovered and because mine was 8 pounds so I basted it every 30 minutes and it came out just right. Total cooking time for my 8lb chicken was 3.5 hours which resulted in an 180F internal breast temp

This. Recipe. Was... AMAZING. I was originally only cooking a chicken up to use the leftovers for stock and I figured I'd try a recipe to go above and beyond. Mind, and taste buds, blown. (I did use garlic powder as opposed to onion as i prefer it and i don't actually have onion powder. I also put a handful of onion and chives inside the cavity.)

Cheers for the awesome recipe.

OH.  MY. GOODNESS. There are not enough stars to rate this high enough!  Like others, I was so tempted to change some things because it sounds a little plain. But I didn't. Made it just like it says except I cooked it longer because I had a five pound chicken. We loved it!  The flavor is amazing, and so juicy and tender!  So robinrockingbird's granny knows her stuff!

Nice and juicy!  It did take longer to roast by about 20 minutes.  My dad used to say he won't eat bird unless it's cooked so long it's falling apart.  I believe over cooking makes chicken dry, so I try to cook until done but no longer than that.  I guess the thermometer is the way to go.

Made as directed but baked in a glass dish instead of a roasting pan allowing the bird to be partially submerged in the juices while baking.  While the bird was resting I added some flour/water to the drippings and made an out-of-this-world gravy (that I may or may not have eaten with a spoon).  Next time I will bake this breast-side down to give the white meat even more flavor.

Didn't change a thing on the recipe itself it was great, but I did change the cooking method.   Using my turkey roasting pan, I placed the chicken breast down for the first 45 mins, then turned it breast up for the last half hour, delicious, skin crisp and just the right color of brown.

Very juicy! I used butter because margarine is not a real food. I followed other suggestions such as melting butter with the seasoning and then brushing that on the dried skin inside and out.Inside was celery, lemon, rosemary. I tucked roasted garlic under skin and I then seasoned some more with Montreal chicken. My birds were almost 6lbs each. I started at 450 degrees for 15 minutes. Then cooked 20 min. per lb until 160 degrees. Crispy skin which is my favorite part and very juicy meat. Got rave reviews at dinner party. The best part is that I cooked two so I have another meal ready to go or to freeze.

As another reviewer said, don't be fooled by how simple this is!  This is the best roast chicken and so easy.  I find seasoning the cavity a challenge (what do you do, stick your whole hand in there?  Throw the salt and hope it covers evenly?) so what I do is melt the butter (sorry, I don't use margarine) and drizzle that over the chopped celery. I then season the chopped celery (butter makes seasoning stick nicely) and stuff the bird with the seasoned celery.  I make sure chicken's skin is dry before I pour a little more melted butter on and rub that around.  Season the skin (I use a generous amount of good kosher salt or coarse ground sea salt).  I start the chicken in a 400 degree oven to crisp up the skin then reduce to 350 after just 15 minutes, and roast 20 mins per pound at 350.  Crispy golden skin, moist even in the breast.  A few times I've added chopped onion inside rather than onion powder, and the last time I just used celery and salt and it was still delicious.

Currently reading through the comment section and it occurs to me that most people don't realize you're supposed to cook any poultry 20 minutes per pound so therefore if its under cooked or overcooked it because you did not look at the weight of your bird before you cooked it. so hopefully this helps people out.  I'm making this chicken but I added garlic and onions into the cavity also. I still only used s&p on top. plus, I rub Evoo on top of the skin and I put only maybe 2 tablespoons of butter/margarine on the inside with the onions and garlic. normally I do my grandma's recipe which is just salt and pepper and some oil on top baked with potatoes and carrots along side the bird but I felt like doing something a little bit different . This time I'm actually roasting it vs baking it.

Yes, wow, a great roasted chicken.  I mean, I'm throwing out other recipes here!  This will be my go-to from now on.  I did add lemon rind to the cavity but only because I had one to get rid of.  It added a nice scent to the kitchen besides the mouth-watering roasted chicken scent.  I put a few cloves of garlic in the pan and took them out and added them to my mashed potatoes after about 1 hour of cooking. Oh yeah, I used butter not that fake stuff. Enjoy, we did!

I had to create an account to review this chicken! Absolutely delicious. Even the child who screamed and yelled that she didnt like chicken got caught trying to cut more off!!! I had to buy a 6lb since there are 5 of us, but I cooked it between 350-380 for 2 - 2.5 hours. It was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank You for the recipe!!!!!!!

I can't get enough of these chickens. I tried roasting chicken before and it was always dry in the breast - but not this recipe. I think the key was in the amount of butter or margarine in the cavity and having celeries instead of other kind of veggies/stuffing. Had anyone tried with different stuffing? I tried both butter and margarine and it seemed to give consistent results. I did try to cook the original recipe, and there were times I improvised with other seasoning - and both works wonderfully as long I didn't change what goes on inside the cavity.  Does anyone have any experience using this method with turkey?

Five stars is not enough!  Such wonderful flavor that we ate it like candy while we cleaned up....after dinner!
I used butter,  it's what I had on hand, and slid slices under the skin with celery seed and dried minced onion (again, what I had on hand), salt, pepper.
Threw some diced potatoes, carrots around the chicken.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 for how easy it is to follow. I have roasted chicken before, but needed something, if only for roasting time information, because I could not find a chicken with a pop up thermometer. I did change this a little bit, as I was out of celery. rubbed margarine all over the chicken, under the skin, and inside the cavity. I seasoned the bird inside the cavity and on the outside with cajun seasoning, rosemary and onion powder. Then I sliced several cloves of garlic and inserted them inside the skin, throughout the cavity, and tucked into the wings and legs. I basted once, about an hour into roasting. This was really moist and flavorful, and the drippings made a delicious gravy. I ended up with only 1/2 lb of chicken leftover that I will put in a casserole for tomorrow night.

This is so simple yet fantastic! I add some more spices like garlic powder and cayenne just because I love a lot of flavor, but even without those things the chicken is amazing! I also don't have the problem that some have had with it exploding everywhere in the oven. I'm thinking that maybe those people have crazy ovens or they're putting the chicken too close to the heat source. I've used both real butter and margarine and it's great either way. Try it!

This does make for a juicy chicken ... but you definitely need to tweak the spices a bit if you want flavor.  This recipe is meant just to give a juicy chicken, nothing more.  I placed small amounts of butter underneath the skin of the chicken, which made for extremely tender chicken breast, but aside from that, the flavor was lackluster.  I've used an onion in the cavity of a whole chicken and it has the same effect, so no need to buy celery if you don't have it on hand.  I used the drippings from the chicken and butter and whipped up some gravy to put on it, which made it delicious, but otherwise would have been very bland.  I think I'll stick with the Sticky Rotisserie Chicken from the site instead.  Thanks!

I followed recipe to a T and the bird was not done in the amount of time stated.  We had to forgo eating chicken that night and instead I made chicken and dumplins with it the next day.  The meat was tasty, but wasn't enjoyed the night it was cooked which bummed me out.  To get a perfect moist chicken cook it at 250 degrees for 5 hours.  Turns out great every time and I wish I would have went with my gut instinct before cooking this one.

This chicken comes out so moist and tender-heaven on a plate. My husband and kids request this meal often. My only additions are minced garlic and pepper into the cavity of the chicken along with potatoes, carrots and onions scattered on the outside. I also sprinkle some additional onion powder on top of the chicken with pepper and minced garlic. During the last 30 minutes of cooking I will generally add some baby portabella mushrooms (you don't want to add them at the beginning of cooking because they will shrivel up and loose flavor). This is a keeper that I will add to the family recipes :) Thanks!!!

This was bar none the most delicious chicken I have ever made. I served some to my hubby for dinner and he loved it too, we ate our portions then hovered over the leftovers picking the meat off. It is SUPER moist and juicy. This is definitely going in my recipe vault.

HEAVENLY. Who says you need to starve and only eat junk as a student? I just buy a whole chicken, follow this recipe and pop it in the oven and forget about it. Then I have delicious leftovers for the next few days. The only thing I did differently was I used garlic granules, and a healthy sprinkle of cayenne. I didn't end up using celery at all and stuffed the chicken with garlic bulbs, lemon and some onion wedges. After the chicken cooked I made a gravy of all the juices on the pan with chicken stock and corn flour/ cornstarch.

I agree with Jenny! Do not let the small ingredient list turn you away. This chicken smells wonderful while it roasts, and tastes even better. My boyfriend who is not a cook but has become used to my thousand-ingredient odysseys asked me, "Is THAT all you're doing to it before you roast it?" Upon eating the finished product, he said he was glad I hadn't done more.

I have tried many recipes for roast chicken, and this by far was the VERY BEST. It was even better than the recipes by famous chefs on the FN channel. You just can't beat Grandma!! I have to admit I was quite skeptical when I read the list of ingredients but the end result was amazing and very delicious.It made a wonderful dinner for Easter. And yes, I did nibble on the celery!Thanks.

This is worth making just for the wonderful aroma that fills your house.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some fresh garlic to the cavity, then surrounded the chicken with quartered onions, baby carrrots and a healthy splash of white wine.  This recipe is a great foundation for any variety of things you may want to add to make it your own.  It turned out beautiful and juicy.  Once sliced and on the plater, I poured the juice/drippings over the top.  Comfort food dinner that was a hit!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I liked it better with an apple instead of the celery but that is just a weird personal thing.  I am not a fan of celery.  Good, solid and easy recipe.

Easiest dinner I have made in a long time. I made no changes and very happy. Using left over roasted chicken in a casserole tonight only had leftovers because I had a 7 pound chicken. I didn't use celery just because my 8 year old daughter has a very picky palate and pick any flavor she doesn't like out of anything.  YUM YUM YUM....yes it was quiet at dinnertime.

DELICIOUSLY YUMMO 6lb Chicken!! 
Like another cook, I used REAL BUTTER, added 1 Lemon(cut in half and squeezed half into chicken and stuffed it and the other half squeezed on top), and added 8 GARLIC CLOVES(4 inside, 4 placed under skin with butter). 
*Since I had a larger chicken(6lbs) i cooked 350 for 2hrs(BREAST SIDE DOWN), then I flipped it when it came out of oven and covered to rest 30min. 
*I cook all my chicken in a Pampered Chef baking bowl. 
**Served with boiled potatoes & carrots, steamed broccoli and then tossed veggies in the drippings from the chicken.
~This will be a staple at our house.

This is a great recipe, the chicken came out so moist and delicious.  I used Garlic powder and put a whole head of garlic(end cut off) inside chicken with celery.  Have made twice now.

Made this last night for my family and we all absolutely LOVED it!!  As others have posted I'm not sure why/how such a simple recipe makes such a juicy wonderful chicken, but it is just delicious.  The only thing I changed was used real onion (cut in slices) instead of onion powder because I didn't have the powder.  I plan to add this to my menu "rotation".

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!! I was skeptical...I added garlic powder to the onion powder, salt and pepper. I also sliced up some left over garlic that I had and slipped it underneath the skin. I also used butter instead of margarine, placed some in he cavit and nderneth the skin. I tried to get seasoning underneath the skin. I didnt have celery but i had lemons and limes so i cut a 1 small lime in half anf cut a half of a lemon into two wedges and stuffed those into the cavity along with seasonings, butter and leftover garlic cloves.  I basted it only about three times. This was very delicious, roasted in my convection oven. Will definitely make again and will consider roasting two chickens next time...

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  I've made this at least twice a month since I found the recipe.  Who would have thought such a simple recipe could produce such a succulent chicken.  I expected the top to burn but it didn't.  Just don't make the mistake of putting the margarine or butter under the skin instead of on top.  I did that once and the top skin burned badly. Lesson learned.  Great recipe.  Sometimes I bake a whole chicken just to have in the frig for quick fix recipes using cooked chicken.  Makes GREAT sliced chicken sandwiches too with mayo on lightly toasted bread and topped with sprouts and slivers of sweet red pepper with a Kosher pickle on the side.

This is my go-to method for roasted chicken.  It's so easy to make and really impresses every time I make it.  Lately, this has become Sunday dinner along with roasted carrots and potatoes.  I use any leftovers for chicken salad sandwiches or soup the next day.  Thanks, Robin, for a tried and true favorite!

This was my first ever roasted chicken I made. Followed to the T, and it was the most delicious and juiciest chicken I have ever tasted. Eating this was like happiness in my mouth, we smiled the whole time we ate it! I make this all the time!!

Excellent. Like others have said already, the result was surprisingly delicious given the paucity of ingredients. Thanks Robin for a great improvement on the usual roasted chicken!

Delicious! The only change I made was add a bulb of garlic to the celery.  I also flip the bird breast side down once it's done roasting to allow the juices from the dark meat to move into the breasts.  I will use this recipe again!

My WHOLE family RAVED about this chicken...home run!!!  (Getting 3 kids to agree is a challenge!)  We cooked a 5 lb. organic chicken and I checked it after the 75 min. as the recipe suggested (for the 3lb. chicken) and it was ready...after waiting the 30 min. we found out it was cooked to perfection!  This will be one of our GO TO recipes that we keep guarded in our family recipe book!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This was delicious. I used a 4 pound chicken and cooked at 350 for an hour and a half. The chicken was so moist and everyone raved about it. I will def be making this again. I was a little nervous about using so much onion powder, but it was perfect. I did not use as much margarine as the recipe called for and it still came out awesome.

I prepared the recipe exactly as the recipe stated. It came out pretty greasy and sticky from all the margarine.  It tasted good, and it was very moist; I would just have prefered it was juicy rather than greasy.

I can only assumethat the people giving this recipe bad reviews either overcooked it or messed something up. Or they just really dont like chicken and expected it to magically taste like something else. It was wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing!

Came out great!  I used a larger chicken so it took a few hours.   I basted it every 1/2 hour.

Real juicy!  Started our bird breast side down for the first 45 minutes and then turned it breast side up for the rest to crisp the skin.  Added some fresh sage, oregano and rosemary to the cavity with the celery.  Scattered small potatoes and baby carrots in the cast iron pan with the chicken.  Really, really good.  Thank you for posting!  It's a keeper.

My husband made this as written for dinner tonight.  It was very easy and very moist.  One tip, my father-in-law, who was a butcher, told me is that even after you cut it, let the pieces sit in the juices from the bird.  The meat is so incredibly moist this way!  Can't go wrong!

I read another review that mentioned the simplicity of this recipe and decided to go ahead and give it a whirl. Oh. My. Goodness! I have no idea what it is about this combination but I've never had such moist chicken. I used the chicken I had on hand... 1 boneless skinless breast and 2 bone in, skin on breasts. All were great. I also added some garlic powder with the onion powder. The leftovers didn't last long! Definitely a keeper!

This was a great basic recipe.  I did not try it as suggested, but made some changes.  I squeezed one whole lemon onto the chicken and quartered another--stuffed half into the chicken and dropped the rest in the pan.  I didn't have a real roast pan, so I cut thick onion rings to raise the chicken in my 9"x12" baking pan.  I cut the remaining onion into big pieces and scattered it in the pan.  I ignored the time and went only by the thermometer.  I also used way more than 1 tbs of onion powder.  And of course, when butter is an option, it's the only option for me!

The chicken was super moist and the meat fell off when we tried to break the legs off.  Fantastic as leftovers too.  I used the drippings on red skinned mashed potatoes.  The lemon adds a great kick--I imagined that the flavor would have been too bland otherwise.

Oh my gosh, this dish is amazing and so easy. Followed it perfectly except added garlic powder as well since I love garlic powder. Also, took the example of another user and added carrots with the celery and they came out delicious as well! Def an easy weekday or special holiday dish!

Turkeys, fresh or frozen, are not widely available in Ukraine where I will have 2 Christmas days as theirs is celebrated January 7th.  So I bought 2 roasting chickens, stuffed them with a savoury, sage, butter, chicken broth, celery, onion, salt and pepper, garlic bread dressing .... rubbed the outside with soft butter and sprinkled with salt, pepper, onion salt, and garlic  .... convection roasted at 175 C for 90 minutes .... turned out pretty well and was quickly gobbled up.

The juicest roasted chicken Ive made !! This is a keeper. I stuffed the chicken with rosemary, thyme as those were the fresh herbs that I had handy, also put a couple of lemon wedges, chuncks of onion. Used Gralic powder and rubbed some down under the skin with some butter. Super delicious !!!

My only problem with this recipe is that I started cooking it to early. I am a stay at home dad and I wanted to make a nice special meal for my wife. I started cooking it at 11:30AM and it was gone by 2:00PM. My 18 mo. old son and I ate the whole thing. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly.

I had never baked a whole chicken before and my husband said it was some of the best chicken he had ever tasted. I used this recipe and added a few extra spices and it was so yummy. Rosemary and thyme are delicious on this. It's so very yummy!

The chicken is bland. The chicken is greasy.  It is also dry. There are so many amazing recipes out there for whole chickens, trust me, this one is not one of them!

This lived up to its name.  I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, dried minced onion for seasoning.  Added water to the pan along with butter.  Served with skin on yukon gold mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus (another AR recipe), and gravy.  Didn't season the inside (forgot), but will next time...was still an amazing chicken, thanks!

The chicken came out juicy and delicious. We did put oregano on the surface and garlic inside the chicken instead of onion powder.

This chicken was awesome!!!!! sooo juicy... so tender... so tasty!!!! and the skin was nice and crispy!  I did not change the recipe at all.  The only thing I did was baste it a few times while cooking and after I pulled it out of the oven. Absolutely delish and cannot wait to make it again!  ty for a great recipe!

My Grandmother was Swiss and this was her go-to recipe for roast chicken, but she also added onion and apple to the cavity.  It's delicious and pretty much the only way I cook whole chicken other than BBQ.

Lots of margerine but delish. I made 1 with just onion powder and 1 with garlic powder added (as some suggested). The onion powder only wins hands down!

Fantastic!!!  Never dreamed this recipe could taste so good with so few ingredients.  Nice and juicy.  Best roasted chicken I've ever eaten.  Only substitution I made was to use butter instead of margarine.  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!!!

Oh. Em. Gee. I had never roasted a whole chicken before so I was a little apprehensive. This recipe was SO EASY and idiot proof! Chicken was so tender and my whole family oohed and ahhed all during dinner. It had a great flavor as is, but I'll bet you could really tailor it to your tastes. I can't wait to shove some lemon and garlic up in there...:D Great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I tweaked it, as always, but my modifications still tasted great. My chicken was 5.6 lbs, so I cooked it longer. I used garlic powder rather than onion, put onion slices under the chicken, 3 whole celery sticks inside plus 3 shallots inside the cavity (would've used garlic but I was out) and then carrots and potatoes surrounding the chicken in the roasting pan. Delish! SUPER moist with a nice crunchy skin. I am looking forward to the leftovers, which will be chopped and made into chicken & rice casserole!

This is the best and most moist chicken I have ever had in my life. It was so moist I was thinking I hadn't cooked it long enough, but I did. I only added lemon pepper and garlic powder. I made 2 4lb chicken and the fiance had asked why I made so much. He saw why after we got done eating. Let's just say I won't have to many leftovers.  :)

Like just about everyone else, I loved this roasted chicken! The meat literally fell off of the bone. I used a 4lb. bird and cooked it for 2 hrs., used butter instead of margarine and put 1/4 of an onion in the cavity with the celery. My family couldn't get enough of it.  Thank you for sharing.

Was great! I didn't have celery on hand so I used celery salt and omitted the regular salt the recipe called for.  My chicken was still partiality forzen so I changed the oven temp to 300 and baked it for 2 1/2 hrs.  My kids tore it up!

Yummy. I added a little bit of garlic powder, but other then that I left everything the same. Easy and good. I cooked my chicken for about 2 hours and basted it every 20 mintues.

I just don't understand how somwthing so simple and easy can be so amazing. I have made this several times for my family and guests and no matter how big of a bird I buy there is never a scrap I follow this recipe to a T only I use real butter and I stuff some up under the skin. Amazing every single time. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

If I could give this 10 stars I would. This was the first ever Roasted Chicken that I had ever made. The recipe was ridiculously easy. I did use real unsalted butter and I added some garlic underneath the skin. I basted frequently and use a little larger bird than 3lbs so my cooking time was closer to 2 hours and 15 minutes. I will make this often. My husband LOVED it and is already making plans to use the leftovers for sandwiches, wraps, and even in chicken enchiladas. I'm so glad I found the recipe!

This came out amazing.  This was my first time making whole roasted chicken by myself so I was little nervous.  It smelled amazing while I was waiting for it to cook.  I did take advice from others as well as did change somethings.  I used light butter instead of margrine.  Instead of onion powdered I used garlic as suggested by others.  I also used one packet goya sazon to seson up my entire chicken. I added a bit of rosemary.  It came out great.  My husband loved it.

Wow!  This is fantastic.  Loved the flavor!  So juicy!  We love this chicken.  Looking forward to another meal soon with the leftovers.  Ours (and this may be my oven) took about 20 minutes longer to cook, so next time I might try it at 375 for the same amount of time.  Thank you.

This was quick and simple to make. The chicken really does come out juicy. Instead of celery, I sliced up a lemon and a cut up a few garlic cloves, put that inside the chicken along with some margarine, salt and pepper.  This one is a keeper!

I didn't have any celery, but this was still AMAZING!  By far, the juiciest chicken I have ever made!  The meat LITERALLY fell off the bone of the drumsticks. =)

Definitely worth making. I like to also put potatos, more celery, onions, and carrots in the roasting dish to roast in the chicken drippings. Then I make a chicken ceaser salad with whatever chicken is left over. Two meals in one, love it!

I wanted to make the Fast Chicken Soup Base from this site but I didn't have a roasted chicken laying around. I DID have some chicken leg quarters and half breasts with skin and bone, so I used 2 breasts and one leg with this recipe. Instead of rubbing the outside of the skin with Country Crock, I treated it like a turkey and pulled the skin away from the meat and added spices and butter in the "pockets." When it came out of the oven, I almost changed my mind! The skin was so crisp and flavorful that I couldnt sacrifice it to the soup stock, and that was fine because I added all of the cooking juices and bones instead. I can't wait to try this again, and there is plenty of room to adjust spices for different tastes. Thanks so much!!

Made this last night..pretty much exactly as recipe stated but I used real butter and instead of the tin foil tent I covered it in tin foil after 1hr45min and cooked an additional 20 min at 350...I'm always paranoid about chicken on the bone not being done! Really moist and delicious...so easy I will make this regularily!

This was great! I added garlic powder and lemon pepper powder, came out AMAZING! Something about these ingredients makes the chicken super juicy and tender. However I had to cook it about half hour longer. Definitely will make again.

I love having roasted chicken, since it's so easy and results in wonderful smells tastes and a wonderful presentation.  While I was making it, my mother did have a few recommendations for it though.  She suggested instead of arranging the dollops of butter around the outside of the chicken, to instead rub the butter all over the chicken so it gets maximum coverage.  I used garlic and onion powder, and even though I thought I added enough spices it could have had just a little more.  Don't be afraid to cover your chicken in spices, I think it takes quite a bit to get the best flavor to the meat and skin.

Also remember to not be my mom and push past the resting period after it's done cooking and just cut in and serve, you'll have very very dry leftovers in no time.

I was looking for a simple roasted chicken recipe, and this one is by far the best that I've found!  Nice crispy skin, nice flavor, and so moist that the meat fell right off the bone.  We'll definitely be making this again, and might try experimenting with lemon pepper, or garlic powder the next go around.  5 Stars!

This chicken smelled HEAVENLY as it roasted! I followed the the recipe as is, only adding an additional TB of garlic powder and some black pepper to the rub. Other than that, it's a spot-on recipe :) I never thought to use butter when roasting chicken before, but I will now!

This was the best roast chicken I have ever made, and I have tried quite a few.  My husband and kids loved it.  I did everything exactly as written except that my bird was closer to 5lbs so I cooked it a bit longer.  The end result was a juicy chicken that made a great dinner and even better leftover chicken salad!  This is my new go to recipe!

This is the moistest, flavorful chicken I have ever made and soooo simple to do, too! 
I used butter not margarine. I seasoned the chicken with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder (basics, but you can season with whatever you like). I also sauteed onion, celery, and pears and put them in the cavity with the butter. I rubbed the chicken with the butter (a little under the skin) and then left some dollops on the top.

Is not a lie! This is the juiciest chicken I have ever had!!! It was amazing and it was so simple. I follow the instructions but changed a few things. I used fresh garlic, and besides onion powder I also use more garlic powder (garlic makes everything better I think). I use margarine instead of butter. I made a rub with the seasoning and the margarine. Rub it everywhere and specially under the skin. OMG it was delicious! My boyfriend and his friends are all cooks (serious one with a degree in culinary arts and all) and they were fascinated by it. Now I'm in their level :). THANKS for this recipe!

I have made this twice and it is amazing. I use and herb butter mixture for the inside, under the skin on the breast and outside of the chicken. Also I use carrots, celery and onion for the stuffing on the inside. Its seriously the best roasted chicken I have ever had!

I have never roasted a whole chicken before trying this. I have to say this is amazing! So easy I felt almost guilty with how good it tasted. You don't have to change a thing, it isn't broke so don't try to fix it. My husband was so impressed with me. Will be making many more time to impress people :)

Awesome juiciness!!  I cooked it in a roaster pan breast side down & then flipped it over for the remaining hour.  Everyone loved it-used a variety of spices, real unsalted butter, & only celery=perfect!  Even made me own gravy & was successful for the 1st time in 40 yrs!  Thanks so much.

I made this Sunday for dinner.  It was amazing.  I used butter and mixed herbs with it, then pulled the skin away from the breast and put the herbed butter all over.  This is something that will be our family's new Sunday dinner!

Mmm..Mmm good. Even the white meat was tender and juicy. I did have to cook it 40 minutes longer. Maybe a difference in elevation. I added onions and garlic and more celery. I used my giblets for gravy and served it with mashed potatoes.

I just now realized we forgot to eat the celery inside the chicken.  I was confused with it anyway when I was putting it inside, I don't know what purpose it served/serves.  But the chicken was very tasty and I am glad I went with this recipe today - everyone enjoyed it very much, thank you ROBIN!  It's simple and worth it.

This was pretty fool proof recipe and was delicious!  I added garlic and lemon to the inside of the chicke as other reviewers recommended.  I also cut up red potatoes and baked them with the chicken.  Came out fabulously moist!

I loved this recipe. My husband invited someone over last minute and this literally saved my life. I added Montreal Steak seasoning on the top. Then I put bay leaves, garlic, onions and cinnamon sticks in the cavity. It was awesome!!

I have tried many ways of roasting a chicken. This is the only way I do it now. I do add a little garlic powder to the spice mix. Best!

Wow!!!  Of all the chickens I've roasted in my lifetime, I've never had one turn out as perfect as this!!  Amazing!  And the gravy?  I added a chicken boullion cube to the drippings and OMG!  Awesome too.  Only addition was I sprinkled dried Basil all over the bird, just because I had some to use up and it was fantastic. I never would have thought to use onion powder or the celery stalk, I've always used garlic and I've always been mediocre, this was perfectly wonderful!

this was perfect. i always use a variation of this recipe when roasting a chicken. i always use real unsalted butter(which i always have on hand), salt, and pepper.   usually i stuff with a quartered yellow onion, whole garlic cloves, thick lemon slices, celery, and halved carrots.   last time i made this i cut up some root veggies(turnips, purple carrots, potatoes), basted them with the buttery juices from the chicken, and threw them in the pan with the chicken for the last ten minutes of cooking. so so yummy! even my picky toddler was gobbling it up.  i always try to use fresh, seasonal, local, and organic ingredients when possible, it really does make a huge difference in taste.

I also chose this recipe because I had a couple whole birds and was short on time.  I did add some garlic and thyme to the salt and pepper rub, but other than that I followed pretty much exactly.  I left the house and it cooked for about 2 hours with no foil or basting, and it was still superb.  I made gravy with the drippings:  Simply transfer all the liquids to a saucepan, dissolve several tablespoons of cornstarch in a bit of cold water, and add cornstarch mixture to liquids until desired consistency.  Tastiest gravy ever!  Super easy recipe with great results.

Simple, straight forward comfort food! Beautifully done!  I made this for a dinner party and there wasn't anything left over!  The chicken was SO tender and SO flavorful.  Thanks for making our gathering memorable!  I'll never 'overseason' a chicken again!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I will be using it again and again a my family just raved and raved about it.  I added a couple extra spiceds to my chicken before cooking such as basil, rosemary, garlic powder and fresh mushrooms inside of the chicken along with the butter as well as lemon juice (about 1/4 cup at most) on top of the chicken.  Wrapping it in the tin foil for 30 minutes makes it SO juicy!  I did as another reviewer suggested and used the drippings for a gravy.  Great idea!

Excellent! Moist and flavorful! Great basic recipe! Easy to add/change flavors to suit tastes. I made some minor changes (added lemon and onion to the cavity w/the celery, rubbed w/olive oil instead of margarine, and used lemon-pepper salt-free seasoning inside & out), and it was just so lovely. Made 2 whole chickens for a group and there were fights over leftovers :)

A pretty good chicken.  I used less butter, added onion and garlic along with the celery, and also added thyme.  There is a LOT of fat in the bottom of the pan--kind of gross.  I used a 6-pound chicken and it served 7-8 people.

Amazing Chicken!  This recipe creates a juicy and delicious chicken.  The only alteration I used was adding garlic powder!  Delicious!  Have now made this recipe twice and will continue to use from now on!  Highly recommended!  :)

This is an awesome chicken!  So juicy and moist, I will definitely make this again.  I had a 3.5 lb bird, so I ended up roasting for 1 1/2 hours.  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter baking sticks and kosher salt.  It came out just perfect!

Very easy, and the juiciest chicken I have ever made! We prefer white meat, so instead of a whole chicken, I did just some bone-in chicken breasts. I cut the celery stalk in chunks and put it in an 8x 13 pan, and laid the breasts on top. Then I sprinkled them with garlic powder (my mistake, as the recipe calls for onion powder, but it was fine) and dotted them with margarine. I used much less margarine than the recipe calls for, about a teaspoon per piece. These were large, meaty breasts so I cooked them for an hour or so. I let them stand for awhile after removing from the oven. They turned out very moist and tender. I was looking for an easy way to make chicken for all those recipes that call for "chopped, cooked chicken" and I think I've found it! I'm going to use this chicken in the Holiday Chicken Salad recipe from this site, but it would be delicious as a stand-alone entree, and the drippings looked like they would make an outstanding gravy.

Very tasty and juicy.  I've made this a few times.  Make sure if you are using a bird bigger then the three pound to add at least an extra 10-15 mins per pound. (I've had problems with my home grown 4-5lb birds taking way longer to cook).  I also didn't have a roasting rack so I cut up potatoes, onions and garlic and just stuck it under the bird with a little salt on top.  Makes the veggies yummy but really greasy.

I impressed so many people when I made this. I have a hard time following any recipe EXACTLY so in and out side the bird I added some italian blend of herbs and paprika. I also very thickly sliced onion and placed it under the bird as another reviewer said, sooo wonderful! Don't pass this one up!!

The chicken turned out fantastic. Only thing I did different was cut slits in the chicken and stuffed garlic cloves all over. I also rubbed 4 cloves minced garlic all over the chicken. It was easy to de-bone it was so moist. The leftovers (if there is any) is great for next day dishes used with chicken. Get pita bread and sour cream to make sandwiches. MMMM

This is delicious!  The only thing I did different was use real butter- stuck 1/2 a stick in the cavity with the celery and cut up the other 1/2 into squares and stuck it under the skin instead of dabbing it on top. This is a juicy, delicious chicken recipe!

Absolutely great recipe.  So tasty.  My chicken was six pounds so I cooked it for an additional 1/2 hour.  Definate keeper.

My 4 lb roaster came out just like the picture. Delicious and moist is right!!    I rubbed the outside (and breast under the skin) with room temperature unsalted butter.  Then I sprinkled the top with a little Lawry's seasoning salt, a generous amt of Lemon Pepper seasoning (next time will use more), garlic & onion powder.     I added  1/4 cup white cooking wine to the pan while it cooked, but next time, I'll put the chicken on onion slices so the back skin can crisp better.     Hubby loved it. Will make again!

I used butter and followed another reader's instruction to butter the breasts under the skin, also filled with garlic cloves and put the onion outside the chicken with the potato pieces and carrots I roasted with it.  My husband said he'd rather have this than KFC Original - high praise! I never thought we would enjoy roast chicken more than fried!

This is SUPER juicy!  I didn't have any onion powder on hand, so I used some onion soup mix that I had...very tasty and easy to make!

I have made a ton of roasted chickens before, and I didn't tell my fiance this one was different, before he even ate a second bite he commented on how juicy this bird was!  I made it exactly as it said (I had a much 7lb roaster so the cooking time was longer) and it was amazing!  Have no idea how these simple ingredients did the trick, but they did!

This is the first time I've made a whole chicken. It turned out really juicy and good. But, I wish the meat had a little more flavor.

this.. is....GOOD. i followed the recipe but added some onions and green peppers to the inside of the chicken since i had some leftover bits and pieces from earlier in the week. i used garlic powder.. its what i had and this not only smelled good but the whole house smelled good too. i served this with roasted potatoes and carrots. this ones a keeper and sunday dinner material all the way. i sprayed the outside with butter spray and the skin crisped up nicely and helped the seasoning stay on the bird.

Definitely lived up to the juicy part of the name!  It was so easy too - I made this after a hectic day full of errands and a kids birthday party and still had the time to put this together.  This was the first time I made this recipe so next time I'll start experimenting with different spices - but I will definitely be making it again.

This is the juiciest chicken I've ever had!  Making it for dinner tonight.  Yum...Just thinking about is making me drool :)  Usually stuff onion instead of celery, and sprinkle with garlic powder and a little ground chili powder.  Sometimes I stuff the cavity with some bread stuffing too.  OMG...Now that is the absolute best!

Very good, did listen too some of the poor reviews and put a few garlic cloves and thyme in the cavity as well, I normally make a roux gravy, but i guess with the butter this one came out awesome, Pan Gravy  Rich in the natural meat drippings left in the pan after cooking roasts, steaks, chops, and fried chicken. One cup of gravy is good for 3lb. roast.  For each cup of medium gravy use: 2 tbsp. fat 2 tbsp. flour 1 cup liquid (water, meat stock, or bouillon cube broth)  Remove meat to warm place. Pour off clear fat (not drippings). Measure amount needed into small sauce pan. Measure liquid into roasting pan; stir and scrape all of brown drippings loose from pan -- heat mixture if necessary; set aside.  Add flour to fat in sauce pan; stir together until smooth. Cook over low heat, stirring steadily until it is bubbling.  Take pan off heat. Gradually stir in liquid and drippings from roasting pan. return pan to heat; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute. Season and serve.  Flavor boosters: Cook meat with seasonings such as bay leaf, peppercorns, onion garlic, celery salt, or other favorites. Add bouillon cube of either beef or chicken. Try different liquids, such as potato water, water from cooked mild vegetables, consume, cream, sour cream, milk, tomato, or vegetable juice.  If gravy turns out less than perfect. If gravy has lumps: Pour through a strainer before serving.  If gravy is too greasy: Skim a paper tool across gravy or Skim gravy with lettuce leaf  gra

I was skeptical because of the simplicity of this recipe.... but I will never do a whole chicken any other way again! It was fantastic! My kids literally picked it clean - leaving no leftovers. I used butter instead of margarine and tucked pats of butter everywhere I could. Thanks for such a simple recipe.

This was excellent!  I will definitely be making it again & again.  I was very juicy & seasoned wonderfully--I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  Quick & easy dinner.  Made nice chicken noodle soup the next day with the leftovers.

Excellent. Tastes just like my grandma's. Very juicy. I followed the recipe closely (only difference is that I used real butter). I used a digital meat thermometer during baking and have to say that this recipe cook time is spot on. Thanks so much for this recipe - love to have that grandma's home cooking taste I miss so much since she passed away.

Very tasty. I added different seasonings to the chicken because I like spicy foods so it was kicked up a notch. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very moist, very yummy!!

This  recipe is soooooo yummy!!! I just added some minced garlic and rosemary...it would have been still super yummy without what I added but I love garlic and rosemary. I can't say enough about this recipe.....I could have ate the whole chicken myself. Thanks for this great recipe!!!!

I have tried roasting chicken so many ways and something was always not quite right. I made this recipe last night. The very best roasted chicken I've ever made! I did use butter not margarine. The white meat was so moist and it had a wonderful buttery flavor.

Excellent recipe!This was my first time cooking a whole roasted chicken. It was so moist and juicy-just fell off the bone. My only change was adding half a can of chicken broth. Definitely a keeper! Give it a try!

The best recipe I've tried for a 'plain' roast chicken that just capitalizes on its own chickeny goodness! Sure, there are some great roast chicken recipes out there that include lemons or garlic or other strong flavors, but this just makes the most of the chicken as it is. The most moist and tender chicken I've cooked to date, and the husband went back for seconds - a rare event! This will be a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic!  It was my first time roasting a whole chicken and felt a little intimidated.  I followed the recipe and arranged some sliced potatoes and carrots around the bird and roasted them along with it.  It turned out perfect.  I will be using this recipe again and again.

This was so juicy and tender. I was looking for a new way to make chicken for my picky eaters and this fit the bill. I was out of onion powder so I improvised with garlic powder and it was excellent. LOVED IT!!

Very good plain, old chicken.  I used the same ingredients (didn't measure), and 3 uncut stalks of celery.  Rubbed seasoning and margarine between skin & meat of each breast, then all over the outside.  Baked uncovered (in a Pyrex dish) at 350 for 1.5 hours.  The skin was very crispy and there were no juices for basting.  It sat around for an hour then was reheated in microwave:  Was still tender and moist.  Super quick prep and no muss/no fuss cooking.

Very easy fool proof cooking. I use a meat thermometer for perfect results every time. Lift up the skin on the breast & thighs & rub seasoning directing onto meat. Instead of just using salt & pepper and onion powder...I add a little cayenne pepper, Old Bay & dried thyme. I also insert dabs of butter under the skin.

I made this chicken on Sunday, April 5, 2009, using a 4 pound chicken.  Baked it for 1 1/2 hours at 375 degrees.  Such a simple recipe that turned out absolutely flavorful and juicy. Will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you so much!

With so many 5 stars I thought this recipe would be exceptional good but it wasn't as great as I expected.  It was just OK.  Although juicy it didn't have much flavor.  I cooked it exactly 1 hr 15 minutes but it wasn't quite done it needed at least 15 minutes more.  I usually put different seasonings under the skin and punch holes in the chicken so that the flavor goes through but I didn't this time just followed the recipe thinking it would be good.  Very disappointing.

Made this on Sunday for the gang.  It was good but nothing special; I guess we just like a whole lot more spices and flavour.  Thanks, though, for something easy and different.

I followed the recipe as is and it was the best roast chicken ever!  With 4 kids, nothing was left of two 3-1/2 lbs. chickens!  We used air chilled chickens and it was juicy and tender and full of flavour.  This'll be my favourite roast chicken recipe!  Mmmm Mmmm Good!

I made this last night exactly as the recipe called for.  It was a good chicken, definitely juicy, but to me just not 5 star worthy.

My family has made a very similar roast chicken. We are Eastern European and, along with the celery stalk, we place a peeled whole onion in the cavity.  Tried and true for at least 4 generations!

I really had high hopes for this recipe... but honestly it just didn't meet with my expectations.  The meat was drier than I expected it to be and flavorless... (compared to my normal chicken schtick that I whip up)...despite the seasoning etc. It just didn't work for me. Sorry!

This is a lovely, simple recipe and the results are outstanding.Sometimes, the simple ones are the best ones. The reason the chicken is so juicy, is that it has a 30 minute resting time.  That time allows the juices to be reabsorbed. Also, it is not overseasoned, so that you get the true flavor of chicken.  Lemon is always a nice addition.

This is a great jumping off point for adding your own spices as well. I make this whenever I find a whole chicken on sale but use Santa Maria Seasoning which is Garlic, Parsley, Salt and Pepper. Tonight I decide to add some red potatoes, swirling them in the pan with some olive oil first and the same seasoning. I like to put pats of butter inside the skin (loosening it first with the blunt edge of a butter knife). I plan to return the potatoes to the pan after setting the chicken out and covering it w/foil. They should crisp up nicely. A simple easy staple in our house.

This was the first time I made a whole chicken. My husband was afraid to try it but is so glad he did. It was the best chicken I have ever eaten. Follow the recipe exactly as it is and do not add anything.

This was a great recipe.  I cooked it exactly as the directions said, and it was delicious.  My only adjustment was the cooking time because my chicken was a little larger than 3 lbs.  Other than that, perfect!!  Thank you for this recipe!

I made it exactly as described and didn't find it to be that great.  There wasn't a lot of flavour.  It was juicy, though that can be easily achieved by using an oven bag.  I have to say that I won't make this one again.

WOW!!!  Second time in 2 weeks I've fixed this. So moist and juicy!  I've always over or under cooked chickens.  Not with this one!  Bought a 5# chicken and it took about 2 1/2 hours.  I just used my meat thermom. until it reached 185 degrees, took it out covered it while the rice was cooking and "presto" a great supper!

This recipe is very good - I used butter - I don't care for margarine, and I reduced it by half; the chicken was very tender and falling off the bone.  My whole chicken was approx. 4.5 pounds and I cooked it for 2 hours at 350...I covered it with foil when it the color/skin looked perfect, and then finished roasting it, let rest for 30 minutes then served.

This recipe makes a great chicken, so I thought I'd modify it to work for a turkey.  As a turkey newbie, I was looking to make a bird that was juicy and flavorful without being too wacky for my family to enjoy.  I stuffed it with an entire stick of butter and celery.  I also added rubbed sage to another stick of butter that was softened and dabbed on the outside of the turkey.  Then I roasted it at 325 for about 5 hours (for a 14 lb. turkey).  It was delicious and perfect turkey.  Thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe!

I am not a health nut who goes for the lean white meat of the chicken. But this recipe made me want more of the breast meat because it was soooo juicy. I look up recipes to know the best cooking method, temperature and some idea for seasonings. I seasoned this with the usual S&P, margarine is a must, you are right, then i mixed together lotsa garlic powder, some chili powder, paprika, thyme, ground coriander, some cumin, a dash of cinnamon...just eye-balling them depending on what i wanted it to taste like and rubbing the chicken all over with it. Uggh, it was unbelievable. The drippings, i strained them and made a gravy out of it with same amount of flour, some water until i liked the consistency. I did not even have to season it. Served it with some simply seasoned mixed veggies and boiled small potatoes to balance the multi-layered flavors of the chicken which was pretty bold, the perfect combo. Thanks again for the recipe. This is my go-to roast chicken cooking method as well.

Very good.  Made this for dinner this evening, and it is most definitely moist & juicy!  I followed the recipe as written, but added several shakes of McCormick's Salt Free All-Purpose seasoning (contains basil, parsley, oregano, thyme & garlic) over the top of the bird prior to cooking.  The skin cooked up flavorful & crisp.  It made for a nice, fuss free meal.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone in the family Loved it.  The skin, which we normally do not eat, was very crispy and had alot of flavor.  I did use garlic powder,butter instead of margarine, and stuffed w/celery and onion. Very Good recipe!

I doubled this recipe believing that I would have more people to feed this Thanksgiving, (we don't eat turkey). My brother helped me with prep for dinner and we made a brown sugar rub, added a halved lemon and onion to the cavity instead of celery. I try and cut out salt as much as I can so I only used the black pepper. We also omitted the onion powder as the rub had so many other spices in it besides brown sugar--which was rubbed on the outside and in.
Since this was the first ever chicken I've roasted, I followed the cooking guidelines as if it were life or death, I'd hate if my family got sick because I didn't cook the chicken right--that said covering the chicken at the end really holds in the heat and gets the meat to the temperature it should be at. The chicken was devoured within minutes of hitting the table--this recipe was definitely worth the 5 stars and raving reviews.

I love this recipe.  I used it for my Thanksgiving Turkey yesterday.  It turned out great!  14lb turkey, 2 stalks of celery, lots of salt, pepper, onion powder, & margarine.  Cooked for 2.5 hours @ 350 in a oven roasting bag w/1 T flour added to it (6 slits cut in top of bag).  It was the best turkey I have ever made.  It was JUICY!

I don't know how this simple recipe turns out so well but this is now my 'go to' recipe for roast chicken. My bird was a bit bigger so took longer to cook (use a thermometer!) I tucked onions & garlic in the cavity as well and used garlic powder in addition to the onion powder - Fabulous!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. Also added some potatoes to the pan and brushed over them with some olive oil since the margarine was not melted yet. Yum!

I used butter instead of margarine as that's all I had and I don't buy margarine normally. I followed the direction except I had no onion powder and used a little onion in the cavity. The chicken breasts were not juicy at all and next time (there will be a NEXT time!) I will cook this breast side down. I lined my pan with foil and OMG the gravy/sauce was incredible. One of the top ten gravies I have ever tasted, and that's saying alot because my father is a gravy magician. I know there was a lot of chicken fat in it, but this thin light sauce drizzled over roasted vegetables was outstanding! I didn't thicken it or add anything else to it at all, it was salty enough. Overall, fantastic recipe, use as much marg/butter as you want and my trick with the salt is to not just rub it on, but massage it very well into the skin, the better you do this, the better the skin. Dry breasts, A+ sauce.

5 STARS!!!!! I added cut up potatoes, carrots and onions the last half an hour, increasing the baking time but is well worth it. Made gravy with the juices by adding some cornstarch to milk then adding to liquid on medium heat. Making chicken hash with leftovers!

Followed it to the letter.  The chicken was perfectly moist.  The chicken skin was so crisp there was a fight over it.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This is sooo delicious. I used the chicken for the Simple, Classic Chicken Potpie recipe and it was soooo yummy.  The chicken was very moist and I literally could have just sat there and ate just chicken for a meal it was so good and yet so simple to make.  I had to make one adjustment to the recipe though.. I did not have onion powder so I ended up using a packet of the dry onion soup mix which still worked out great.

this is the easiest and juiciest roasted chicken I have ever made!!!  everyone raved about it.  I had celery salt and onion salt.  I also put some Mrs. Dash on the chicken.  It was great, even great as leftovers the next day!

EXCELLENT!  One of the best roasted chickens I've ever made.  I didn't have celery, so I stuffed the bird with whole garlic cloves.  I also used butter instead of margarine, and sprinkled inside and out with garlic powder, onion powder, and Cavender's Greek Seasoning.  Another thing that I did differently was roast the bird breast side down as suggested elsewhere, and I think that also helped make a difference.  Basted a couple of times during the cook (1 1/2 hours at 350 was perfect!).  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!  :o)  Kiddo picked the carcass clean!

I can't disagree, the chicken is super juicy, but ultimately i don't think it has a lot of flavor as it.  I think the addtion of some other spices might perk up the flavor a bit.  futhermore, this uses a lot of butter.  i think you could get away with cutting this down a bit. plus you would lose some of the calories.

YUM! I used organic chicken. I made garlic butter and slathered the bird, even spread butter just under the skin. We were slurping the meat of the bones it was so juicy. Great recipe to cook up and debone and use chicken for other dishes.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have the celery, so I used lemon wedges and two bay leaves inside the bird. I also used the garlic powder instead of the onion powder, plus I sprinkled the outside with some paprika.  I had to bake the chicken a little longer, since it was a larger bird.  All in all not bad, will probably make again with a little tweaking.

Added lemon slices, rosemary sprigs and garlic to the inside of the chickens and reduced the temperature and let the chickens really slow roast. Used Lawry's Perfect Blend Chicken and Poultry Seasoning. Delicious.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was amazing. My entire family loved it. The meat was so moist and juicy. It fell right off the bone.  The only thing I did differently was add in a little chicken broth as it was cooking to baste it along with the butter. I did cook it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. But then let it rest in the oven with the oven off for the 30 minutes. I feel like it came out way better that way.

I chose this recipe primarily because of it’s simplicity. I followed the recipe exactly as written which I always do first time out. I’ve been cooking for years and this was definitely the moistest roast chicken I’ve ever had. Definitely a keeper. A very economical meal. My chicken was 5.69 lbs and it was done at 1.5 hrs. Keeping it tented with foil for 30 minutes was beneficial.

Delicious. Made it as written (because who doesn’t like simplicity?). It was excellent. Made it again and added garlic powder along w the onion powder it was even better. Made it a third time and added the garlic powder again PLUS creole seasoning... the green can “Tony Chachere’s” - very common in all grocery stores... the best version. So, after a few different attempts, I would say that this is perfect “as is” or seasoned to your liking. Either way, you can’t go wrong here. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely heavenly. My family loves garlic so I added to the cavity but folllowed everything else to a tee. Friendly reminder to those who criticize seasoning levels; the recipe does say to taste. Thanks for a great “go to” roasted chicken recipe.

Made this chicken today and it definitely was moist. I only changed the amount of onion powder, as my hubby is not a big fan. Other than that followed the recipe exactly. Taste was good, only issue was cooking time was way off. 

Ended up bumping up the oven to get it done, and all said and done it took almost 2 hours for a 3 pound chicken. Not a big deal, but the natives were very restless by the time it hit the table. ;) Would make it again but alter the time or temp of the oven. Thanks, hope this helps!

It’s of the devil!  Only kidding but some other-worldly magic is at play, I suspect.  I am a cook and have made a few hundred roast chickens and turkeys in my life.  Can not figure it out but it’s my new go to recipe.  It’s awesome!  Yes- I made a couple of adjustments by putting the juice of one lemon in the cavity and adding three  whole cloves of garlic. I also used butter instead of margarine.   I set the oven to 500, popped the roast in and reset the oven to 350.  Juicy, tender, flavorful.  Thanks for this keeper!

Nothing special at all. We thought it wasn't  extra juicy even with all the added grease (margarine). I wouldn't bother with this again.

I've made this 5 or 6 times already since finding the recipe a few months ago. It's actually roasting in the oven as I write this review! So easy and absolutely delicious. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious!  Made it to the recipe, except I used butter instead of margarine and I added garlic powder.   Love the crunch of the outside and the juicy deliciousness of the meat.   Will make this again!

This was very juicy and tender. However, no need to heat to 180. That really is excessive. I cooked it to 165 and it was fine.  I used butter instead of margarine. I can't imagine using margarine in anything.

I wasn't to sure about this recipe,  but it turned out great. I stuffed a few garlic bulbs,  onion slices and parsley inside with butter and the seasonings and added paprika.  Put all the seasonings on the outside with butter around it,  carrots, potatoes  and onions.  I poured about a cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the  Dutch oven and cooked it for and hour & 45 minutes. Came out juicy! Best roasted chicken I've  ever made!

Incredible!!! Very juicy and tasty.  However, 1 hr and 15 min at 350 is not enough time. I took mine out after 2 hours and it still could have used another 20 min. Use a meat thermometer. It will take 2+ hours to reach 175C. I also used butter instead of margarine. There is not a lot of juice in the bottom of the pan so butter doesn’t burn like margarine does. I also had some fresh sage that was starting to getting a bit wilted so threw that in the cavity just to use it up. Will definitely do this one again.

Didn't change a thing except I only use salted butter.  Easy enough, smelled divine while cooking and was moist but wasn't blown away like other reviewers. Hubby liked it but I found it a bit bland. Would try again with some spices.

Due to other reviews, I just had to make this because it looked just too simple to be good. Well, it IS simple and it's fabulous! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I did baste a few times with the good juice on the bottom of the pan. And then I used it for gravy. The gravy was perfectly seasoned.
I just have one question....who uses a 3-pound chicken? Mine was almost six pounds and I baked it two hours.  That just gave me an idea! This would be great for Cornish Game hens.

I normally use much more than just salt & pepper as seasoning, and was very skeptical about this recipe because the ingredients seemed very "blah". Nevertheless I gave it a shot because of the great reviews, made it one evening when I didn't have much energy, and wasn't really in the mood to cook (yeah, I was feeling pretty lazy and this seemed so easy). It was DEELISH! I was so pleasantly surprised - the family ate it up, and asked for it again. It's one of the recipes in my "favorites" file. I baked it for longer than the recipe called for.

We just discovered that the oven in our new house came with a meat thermometer, so I was anxious to try it out. I went to the store this morning to buy a chicken before I actually looked up a recipe. This was, by far, the best rated recipe, but I didnt have any celery and I was ready to substitute and onion and/or carrots instead. I was also prepared to add a little garlic powder and paprika to the skin. 

After reading several of the reviews here about following the directions precisely, I bundled up my 3 year old and made a second trip to the store. Boy, was I glad I did!

I followed everything precisely, and it turned out beautiful. I was worried about it being dry, since the directions don’t have you basting until after it’s finished in the oven. Don’t worry - it’s nowhere near dry. 

I will definitely be adding this to our menu, without changes or substitutions. 

Oh, and my new oven’s meat thermometer worked perfectly!  I had a slightly over 4 pound chicken, and it helped me know I needed to cook a bit longer than the recipe called for. I think I had it in for another 30 minutes. Bottom line - watch the internal temp and don’t change the oven setting at all. 

Great recipe!  Very juicy and delicious skin!

I'm on the Autoimmune Protocol diet so I had to make a substitution for the butter (no ghee, I used Coconut Oil) and, apparently, my oven doesn't get properly hot (so the meat thermometer indicates) and I had to make an adjustment and cook the bird some more. But, STILL, this turned out AMAZING. Tender, juicy, delicious and it made the house smell terrific. I am pleased to learn that chicken doesn't HAVE to be dry as a cardboard box. Who knew? Simple and perfect. Y'all need to try this one.

I have cooked roast chicken for a long time. This was by far the most tender, moist (roasted) chicken I have made. Not sure if it was the butter (I used butter instead of marge as we have great butter here) inside or the slightly lower cooking temperature. Either way I thank you. It was awesome. (I also put half lemon and garlic in the cavity. Cooking time, including the resting was spot on)

I looked at the reviews and chose to cook it longer.  I cooked it for 3 hours at 350 degrees.  It is done, but not over cooked(still very juicy).

Excellent, simple recipe!  I will almost certainly make this again & the only thing I will change is to try cutting the margarine in half.  Even for the ~4.5# chicken I used the 1/2 cup of margarine was too much.  Otherwise it turned out very well, the chicken is very moist & fall off the bone tender!

Easy and very good. I added some water during the cooking process because it did not create enough juice to use later. I cooked it for 1 hour 45 minutes based on reviews to ensure it was done. I will cook it again!

I've made it twice, but stuffed it with dressing that included apples, walnuts craisins, celery, onions and sausage. It was tender and juicy beyond words and truly impressed the family. This easy dish is now a staple in my recipe box.

I made this today with a 5.2 lb chicken. I cut the butter to two tablespoons and added some coarsely chopped onion to the cavity with the celery. It took over two hours to get to 175 degrees but I figured that to be more realistic. It turned out well. I made gravy with the pan drippings and made some stuffing to go with it.

I was looking for something a little different for dinner and found this recipe .  I made absolutely no changes at all.  I followed the recipe exact.  My roast chicken turned out wonderful.  My husband loved it.  So moist and flavorful.  The drippings in the bottom of my roasting pan were  full of flavor and made a great topping for my mashed potatoes. The very best I have ever done.  I definitely will  make this again.  I am thinking of doing this with my Christmas turkey.   Thank you for a really great recipe.

Chicken does not come out brown or crispy. I checked the pics and it looks like alot of other peoples chickens are pale too.  Bland flavor. Mine was actually undercooked and we all got a bit of a stomach ache.

I don;t remember that I have ever even roasted a chicken before but this did come out so moist it was unbelievable.  The only changes I made was in some of the spices that I put on the chicken.  I added garlic salt , memphis style bbq spice, and lawry's seasons all to the outside and garlic salt and chopped garlic to the inside.  OMG!  what a flavor.  When we were done eating on it I boiled what was left and made soup out of it.  The soup was soo good I had to roast another chicken just so I could make more soup and can it for later.  I have the third chicken ready for the oven and we will eat on it for a bit and then I will boil it as well, save the broth and shred what meat is left for future dishes like chicken noodle or chicken and dumplings etc.  So far this is one of the BEST  recipes I have found here.

One of the ways I roast chickens, with exception, I use real butter, as it is healthier than margerine.  Keep the chicken moist during roasting by separating the breast skin from the meat, and put your butter and seasonings in between so they are directly on the meat.

Very simple & delicious.  I followed the recipe except for the use of a 5 lb bird instead of the 3 lb bird.  I use a Thermoworks Dot to tell me when my meat is done to the temp required.   I have now tried this recipe on a turkey and a turkey breast and had the same delicious results.   If you use anything larger than the 3 lb bird it will take longer to  bake.

I made this as instructed the first time.  Just delicious.  The second time I brined the chicken in kosher salt and water for 3 hours the day before (2quarts water and 1/2 cup kosher salt).  Then I patted very dry the outside and inside of the bird and let it sit uncovered overnight in my fridge to crispen the skin more upon roasting.  THEN, the next day, I added slices of lemon and garlic under the breast skin and in the cavity with the butter and celery.  My husband loves this so much EITHER way and it is truly a moist, flavorful bird.  I, myself, have never before liked roasted chicken until THIS original recipe.  MAKE THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!

I cooked this in my crock pot over high for the first hour and low for about 4 more. I basted several times to keep the top moist.

ALMOST 1 TS SALT
1/2 TS PEPPER
1TS OIGNON SEMOULES

I will make this roast chicken often.  It was juicy and moist.  I was trying for a kid-friendly dinner for a family with two little boys, one two and one five.  The five-year-old looked up during dinner and told me what a delicious dinner I'd given them.

I used a 5lb chicken instead of 3lb. I did 5 pieces of celery broken up and I took the chicken out about half way through and basted with the drippings. Used lots of margarine and garlic salt not powder because that's what I buy. I also cooked 2 hours due to weight difference.  (I have a gas powered oven) It was so tender when I tried to pull off a drumstick all I got was the bone! No meat stuck to it! It was super delicious and the flavor was outstanding.  I will use this recipe again for sure! I love how budget friendly it is too!

I've been on my own personal mission to find a way to improve our whole chicken nights. Haven't found a recipe yet and this one didn't bring me a step closer. While it greatly improved the smell wafting through the kitchen on whole chicken night, the meat was dry but somehow managed to still taste just like butter. Wouldn't make this again.

Followed directions to a T and it turned out so moist that everyone wanted 2nd's. My step-granddaughter wanted the carcass to pick what was left and eat the celery, LOL. She's 9-years old. I didn't make a gravy out of the drippings, I just spooned the drippings onto the carved chicken pieces. Served with pan roasted parmesan, garlic potatoes and collard greens. Delicious!!! I want to try this on my Thanksgiving turkey! BTW, those who say they cooked it for 1 hour and 15 mins and it was not done? That is why you tent it for 1/2 an hour, to allow it to cook itself the rest of the way.

Followed the recipe. Was fantastic.

(Did brine the chicken for 2 hours in a half gallon of water with 1 cup salt, 1 cup sugar. At the same time this brought the chicken to room temperature.  Instead of onion powder, I used poultry seasoning - which I enjoy. Ended up trussing two chicken halves together- which was quite an adventure. Regardless, this recipe is simple and fantastic. The gravy it produces is awesome as well.)

Winner, winner, chicken dinner!!  My first time cooking a whole chicken and this recipe was so simple with such delicious results!  My DH doesn't like white meat but this was so moist he ate it.  Made the leftovers into chicken soup so absolutely nothing was wasted.  DH even went out and bought another larger chicken which really says a lot!

I do not understand this dish AT ALL.  I made it exactly as written, including the fact that I bought a chicken that was nearly exactly three pounds. It was a 3.02-lb fresh, organic chicken from a local farm. Followed the recipe to the letter. After 75 minutes, the internal temperature registered only 152. Stuck it back in the oven 30 more minutes. Nope. Thirty more minutes (a total of an HOUR more than the recipe states), the chicken was finally to 180 degrees. The skin was crispy, but everything was so bland..

I didn't have a roasting pan (we don't have the space) so I used an old cake pan and made lines of crumpled foil, worked great! Also substituted the celery for 1 large gala apple sliced up and 5 large sprigs of rosemary.  DELISH! Thanks! *we baked it about an extra 30 minutes but our chicken was rather large and we're paranoid of not cooking it all the way...new meat thermometer is in the mail!

Not bad as written, BUT, as any good chef/cook will do, you ask yourself, "What can I do to make it better?"So I did!
I am a big fan of Rosemary or Lemon Pepper with my chicken. So I cut the celery stalk in half, added 2 sprigs of Rosemary and tied it together with butcher twine.
Yesssss, the flavor was awesome.
Next time I will make a compound butter with Lemon Pepper and rub under and on the skin, and if the moon is full and the wind ain't blowin', I'll stick some Rosemary up it's .........Cavity.  
;-)
I had to bake longer  than 1:15 to get a safe temp in my dark meat. It was more like 1:40. I covered the breast with an aluminum bra to give it a bikini look. I did that at about the 45 minute mark. She sure was sexy lookin'.  Sorry, no pics.

I liked this recipe, however it did take longer than an hour and fifteen minutes. I think the temp is a little low. I started at 350 degree F for and hour and fifteen minutes, but the juices were still not clear. I turned up the oven to 375 and Keep checking it after 20 minute intervals. I'm thinking next time I'll start at 400 degrees covered with foil for an hour, then bring it down to 375/350 the rest of the time uncovered. I would also like to point out...you need to rinse chicken (if not doing a brine) and pat dry with a paper towel. Make sure you soak up the excess water inside the cavity as well. All and all the recipe itself is good. I will be using  it again.

I will be making this chicken often.  My husband loves chicken but it can be very dry so I usually bake it with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  NO MORE !!  This recipe is fantastic. IT was VERY juicy and tastey. Even the white meat had juice in every bite.  I followed the recipe exactly (minus celery) I didn't have any.  Being from the south I had to make gravy out of the leftover juice in the pan and it was out of this world. 
I had a 5lb chicken so I baked mine for 2 hrs. Can't wait for Thanksgiving I am going to cook my turkey this way.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was FANTASTIC! I'm new to cooking with meat, but this recipe was as simple as it gets. the only change I made was to add some extra spices to the rub, like Rosemary, and I think Sage... Maybe Thyme, but definitely no Parsley ;)   I'm making this recipe again for Sunday dinner this week!

I chose this recipe because it was simple, quick and easy. I didn't have the celery on hand to use and the chicken turned out tender and moist. Not one dry piece! I roasted carrots and fingerling potatoes with it and it all turned out great!

Very juicy, and so easy! Hubby loved it, and so did I. I didn't have celery on hand, used a few organic rainbow carrots instead. Excellent!

I can't believe how good this just turned out. I didn't have celery, used a quartered onion as someone else posted in a previous comment. Everyone's chickens are different sizes, ovens are different. This is where meat thermometers come in handy. My chicken was done after 1hr 30, let it rest! So simple, so good, so gone

The only changes I made was to add 1 onion quarter with three whole cloves with the celery to the cavity.   I also added 1 cup of chicken broth in the roaster, cooked for 2 hrs. for a 3.6 lb. whole chicken.  Used 1 cup of broth with 1 cup of milk whisked with 2 tbs. of flour for the gravy seasoned with salt and pepper.  Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus from our garden.  Absolutely delicious, sad to say we have no leftovers.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for posting.  So very simple.

Deserves more than 5 stars!  Simple recipe that is absolutely delicious, flavorful, and most importantly, moist.  This is a huge concession for me since I don't even care for chicken in the first place and was stunned to find that it was one of the best meals I'd ever eaten!  I used olive oil in place of the margarine (because I'm lactose intolerant) and it was still sensational. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  Can't  imagine how much better it would be with butter (our household doesn't use margarine)!   This is a wonderful basic recipe that is incredible as is, or it can be spiced up a bit with any combination of flavors you'd like...garlic powder, fresh garlic, onions, carrots, potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemons, apples, oranges, greek seasoning, etc.  Can't wait to experiment!  The most important thing is to be generous with the salt and onion powder,  massaging  hard and well into every pore of the skin, as well as inside the cavity.  Don't forget to seal in those flavors with your choice of fat - margarine, butter, olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, etc.   Also, be sure to do the math as to the cooking time depending on how big or small your bird is.  The organic ones I get at the store tend to be much larger  (almost double)  the weight listed in the ingredient list. This recipe comes with my highest recommendation.  Bon Appétit!

This WAS AMAZING! I've made dozens of recipes from this site and this is the first review I've been compelled to write.   This was amazing and ridiculously easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and it's the juiciest and most tender chicken ever.  Thank you!

Never trusted my cooking skills to roast a chicken...UNTIL NOW !Only change I made was the size of my bird.She was a 6 pound beauty. So I doubled the celery ,seasonings and roasting time. It came  out juicy and tender....This is now my "Go to" recipe for oven roasted chicken.

Followed recipe as written. It was delicious. The second time I made it, I added mushrooms and carrots to the cavity. I also used herbs de Provence. Delicious with or without additions. My mom has been making roasted chickens my entire life, this surpassed any she has made. Thanks.

I didn't have margerine, so used butter instead.  Also, we had a monster 6 lb. + chicken, so slipped some of the butter under the skin, and covered it with tin foil for the first half of the cook time to prevent overbrowning.  The white meat came out amazingly juicy and tender, and the family plowed through it.  Should've gotten a bigger bird!

Delicious flavor AND juicy! So simple to make! We used the drippings as a gravy for our side of roasted sweet potatoes. Great for a family meal! Our chicken was about 5lbs so it took about 2h cook time. IMPORTANT: let it rest for at least 30 minutes after cooking.

Hi. First, this is a great recipe and thanks for sharing.  I used a glass baking pan and mine didn't come out done. Looked fab, opened it up and it was bloody. Sigh. We put it in at 365 this time for another half hour.

my husband and i found this very bland.  it was moist enough but quite tasteless.  i even added garlic and more onions and celery than it called for. The skin was very crispy though, which my hubby liked! I won't make it again.

Perfect and finger-lickin' good!
Update after making this again: I stuck the pieces of butter under the skin and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then stuffed it with the celery. Baked it at 450 for 15 minutes then at 350 for 2 hours (for a 6.5 pound chicken). Deliciously moist with crispy skin!

I know many people say you have to make this recipe as listed but I just could not. I have made chicken before but it has never come out this juicy and perfect. I pretty much followed this recipe with just a couple of adjustments.  I used a 5 pound chicken ( It was on sale) I try to never use Margarine. I do not believe it is good for you at all ( Just my opinion) . Since Margarine is mostly just a oil spread I decided I would use 1/2 cup of Olive Oil to replace the Margarine.  Some scallions, garlic cloves, and celery inside the bird and then followed all other directions as listed. Since it was a 5lbs chicken I did cook it for 1hr 30min and came out sooooo perfect. Made the perfect gravy with the drippings and milk. My fiancé said it was the best he ever had. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed directions exactly EXCEPT I did not have celery, but did have a thawed chicken I had to bake. This was so moist. I can't figure it out, might be the resting covered in foil for the 30min? White meat even the next day was moist. I'm going to go with the celery next time. But don't let a lack of celery in the fridge dissuade you from trying!

Excellent recipe! I know - I was very doubtful of something being "remarkable" when it only has a small handful of ingredients but this really was so good! I had a 5.5 POUND CHICKEN so cooked it for 1 HOUR AND 50 MINUTES, then followed the rest of the directions and it was great!

I do this with turkey and chicken both. I use celery, onion and either apple or lemon. Cut up veggies into big pieces and fill cavity drizzle a little oil over skin and dot with butter. They turn out very moist every time.
I put them breast side down also. Then the juices run into the breast meat not out of the breast.
Use celery to keep bird off of bottom of pan, if you don't have a wire rack.

Very easy and very delicious! I made some changes because it's not common to have garlic powder here, so I used 5 pieces of garlics, and I used mortar and pestle to make paste, and rubbed it all over and inside of the chicken. Taste heavenly!

I have never cooked a whole chicken before. I chose this recipe because it had simple ingredients and instructions. WOW!! It turned out so great. Yummy and juicy. I will be using this again.

Eventually it turned really well but the cooking time and temp 1 1/4 hrs @ 350* was not adequate for my poor chicken (only got to 165*).  After 75 mins I had to return it to the oven at 375* for an additional 30 minutes...covered.  Better than any rotisserie chicken we've had...

I was so excited after reading the reviews to try this. I used a 5 lb. bird and roasted it for 1 3/4 hours.... should have been longer even with letting it set for 20 minutes. It was juicy... some of skin was not nice and browned....

I also find it amusing when people drastically change the recipe then rate it, lol. It becomes a whole different dish. This was an easy recipe, quick to prepare,  throw it in the oven and done. Great for beginners.

I just made this for dinner and it was AWESOME!!!!  So easy to prepare with a big payoff on taste and juiciness.  The whole family loved it!  I did use real butter but only because I didn't have marjoram.  A must try!  Saving this recipe :)

This took way longer to cook. I did buy a 3.5 lbs. but it took almost 3 hours to get the temp to 180. It was juicy but I was expecting quick and awesome. The gravy was awesome though. Chicken was just ok.

This is delicious.  I was in a rush so cooked it at 450 for one hour, rotating half way through.  Very moist and flavourful with crispy skin.  Yum!!

This recipe gives you a really juicy roast chicken. but the only problem is that when you cover it by aluminum foil, the steam of cooking chicken washes away most of the spice and then it feels like a simple and not very tasty chicken. So I would recommend to cover it for a short time (about 10 mins) after you bring it out of the oven.and if you ,like me, enjoy real crispy and tasty chicken follow all the instructions but put the chicken on a rack instead of into a pan and then put it in the oven. That's it!

This turned out really well but I won't even touch margarine so used butter and ghee instead and worked fine. I did add garlic as well.

I used this recipe, except instead of putting the butter on the outside, I mixed it with herbs and inserted it under the skin.  I got rave reviews over and over all night.

We devoured it, but it took FOREVER to get to 165 degrees!  It could be because I added cut potatoes and carrots to the bottom of the roasting pan.  Many reviewers said the same thing, so be sure to allow your schedule extra roasting time, if needed.  We didn't eat dinner until 8:00!

Loved this recipe - I substituted butter for margarine (is margarine still around?) - and filled the pan with potatoes, carrots, and garlic cloves, added some fresh rosemary, salt and pepper and stuffed it with even more garlic - we're fighting colds in this household. I had the oven on broil so it'd be hot when I put the chicken in, giving it a nice golden skin. Easy and fills the house with a beautiful aroma.

Excellent. How can you go wrong when you cook a whole chicken on a slow oven? Turned out moist and wonderful. I did add some minced garlic to the cavity and to the skin as well and it turned out great.

I haven't baked a whole chicken in a long time and was looking for a simple but tasty recipe. This one filled the bill. It was so moist and flavorful I was really surprised. I was concerned as it baked because it being uncoved I had no juice in the pan and I really wanted the juice. After I put the last of the butter on the chicken lo and behold I had a wonder rich looking broth in my pan. I saved the carcass and the remaining broth in my freezer and will make a delicious soup from it next week. Thank you for posting this delicious recipe. Forgot to take a picture before we devoured it.

This is by far the best chicken I've ever eaten, and no doubt one of the best dishes I've ever prepared. I did make a couple changes, but I won't go into that. This review is for the recipe itself, and it's an incredible one as written. The only thing I would note is that it took much longer for my chicken to reach 180°, close to 2 1/2 hours. Although our dinner was later than anticipated, it was WELL worth the wait!!!!

WOW! I added 3 crushed garlic cloves to the inside of chicken with celery, butter, and salt and pepper as directed. I don't have a roasting pan or rack so i quartered potatoes and 2 carrots skins on all and placed them on the bottom of my dutch oven and put the chicken on top. We didn't need to season the carrots or potatoes at all! Everything was delish! Will definitely make this again and again.

I tried this recipe for a Christmas dinner for two. I followed the recipe exactly, using an air chilled whole chicken and it was sooo delicious! It came out with a lovely golden exterior and was indeed very juicy. Hubby was very impressed. Leftovers were great, too. I'll be making this again!

Incredibly simple. Incredibly delicious. I can't believe how juicy & tasty the chicken is with so few ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and hubby's first comment was how juicy it was. My picky 6-year olds loved it too (albeit white meat only) The skin was so crispy. This will be my go-to whole chicken recipe! Thanks!

Simple ingredients but oh so flavorful chicken. I've made this recipe numerous times, exactly as written. All parts of the chicken are delicious and our table certainly does fall quiet when we eat this. It is THAT good. I love recipes that are flavorful without a ton of ingredients. Definitely a keeper in our household!

Really easy and very tasty!  I basted it 3x.  Once after 45 minutes, one hour and when it came out.  Used butter; the skin was flavorful and crunchy!

So delicious and juicy. My son wanted a leg and as I was pulling and cutting it, the bone slipped out. It was that tender. FABULOUS!  I did use a bigger bird, so compensated with extra ingredients but essentially the same. Thank you!

I dont usually take the time to write reviews, but I had to this time. My husband is a ridiculously picky eater....he would eat italian food every day of his life if he could. Every time I have ever made a roasted chicken for the family, he has ended up eating cereal. Super annoyng! He actually ate this roasted chicken...in fact he complemented me on a great dinner! Success!!!!! I was inspired by the story about  your German Grandmother and ended up making spatzle and hot German potato salad as sides. I didn't  change anything when I made this recipe....delcious exactly as written.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I put quartered onions and three small garlic cloves in the cavity along with the celery  I also used butter not margarine and added smoked paprika to the salt, pepper, onion powder rub.  Great Reviews from my husband, drippings make a lovely gravy.

I don't use as much butter as is suggested, and skip the celery. I also add about 30 minutes to the cooking time. Having said that, since I've found this method we've enjoyed perfectly roasted chicken each and every time! Thank you!!!

Placed quartered potatoes, chunked carrots and few thick slices onion in roasting pan drizzle with olive oil, s&p, and big pinch thyme. Place chicken on top, drizzle with olive oil, s&p inside & out, sprinkle with thyme. Place few slices onion in cavity with 8-10 cloves garlic chopped in half and 1 stalk celery. Baked at 425 for 1 1/2 hours rest under foil 20m (for 5.47lb bird). I'm sure this recipe is delish as written, I just wanted to cook everything together, only 1 pan to wash! :)

For years I've dreaded dry chicken! But after this recipe, no more! The only thing I did differently was use Cajun seasoning instead of onion powder. All in all, it was a great meal!

WOW.  I decided against all temptation to follow this recipe exactly as is and I'm glad I did because it was awesome, juicy, flavorful, fall off the bone delicious!  I did double it because my chicken was 6lbs.  I read a review that said theirs was undercooked, but all meat of equal measure cooks the same.  So I think maybe that person didn't know when you change the serving size the measurements of ingredients changes, but the directions stay the same.  So it sounds like their bird was bigger, but they cooked as according to the original serving in the recipe.

I've made this many times. Yes it's great as is, pay attention to size of your chicken, larger sizes will need more oven time. Always comes out nice, juicy and delicious.

Excellent!  I roasted two 3 lb chickens. I followed the recipe exactly.  However, since I had left over lemon grass, I stuffed the chicken cavity with these, in addition to the other ingredients mentioned in the recipe. I placed the chickens on the roasting grill so that the oils could drip onto the roasting pan and chicken would not get soggy.  The chickens turned out really juicy and the skin was crispy.  Will be making this again!

I did the recipe as stated, except I didn't have celery, so I used apples. Still fantastic and moist. I think the last step of basting with the juices, covering and waiting 30 min is the key. Thanks! :)

I cooked this for my family the other night and it tasted great!  I didn't change anything in the ingredients.  However, the only downside was the chicken was not quite done all the way through.  I would add about 15 minutes to the cooking time at least.  We made this with the candied carrots and my wife finished the rest off the next day.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe. Cook time was accurate for me. This was a very juicy chicken. It didn't have a lot of flavor but to me that's obvious by the ingredients. This is a great base to add your own seasonings to or if your going to use this chicken for a different recipe like chicken noodle soup.

I make my chicken the same way, except I stuff the cavity with an onion or two. Sometimes I get really wild and put a few bay leaves under the skin. The key to a juicy chicken is to fill the cavity with a veggie that puts off lots of aromatic steam. Yes, you can use butter alternatives (margarine, light or low fat butter substitutes, unflavored yogurt, unflavored greek yogurt, etc).

This was the best chicken we've had in a while.  Definitely a keeper!  I added two things: I rubbed it down with parsley garlic salt and added a sliced carrot with the celery inside and out.  My picky son had 4ths and my husband who generally does not like roasted meat because it's on the dry side said I needed to make this again!

This was delicious!!! Husband and son loved it. I will be cooking roast chicken this way from now on. I noticed a lot of reviews stating it wasn't cooked enough. I had a six pound chicken and I cooked it 2 hours and 15 minutes.You have to Cook roast chicken 20 minutes per pound plus an extra 15 minutes. It came out perfect.

This was an awesome recipe. The chicken was moist and tasty. I will certainly make this again, even my daughter liked it. Our chicken is normally dry and tasteless but this was just amazing. Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This resulted in a simple but juicy and delicious chicken! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: garlic and butter instead of onion and margarine. I also added another 15 minutes to the cooking time to get the right internal temp. 
Highly recommend making a nice gravy from the drippings- it was fabulous!

Darn the luck.  Followed EXACTLY. As other reviews said to and the chicken was still pink.
Better luck next time.  I will try his again. For so MANY gave it a 5 star rating.

Followed this recipe exactly. I was having a busy day so it was quick.

There is nothing wrong with this chicken if you are a novice cook. This recipe calls for the least amount of prep, and turns out really well.

That said, once you have a few years of cooking under your belt, you will probably have a recipe on hand that has a lot more taste than this basic chicken.  '

I may make this recipe again in a busy pinch.  Thx for posting it!
Keep in mind, if you use an organic chicken, this recipe will be better.

I had a chicken in my refrigerator and wanted to find quick and easy way to cook the whole thing before it went bad. This recipe looked super easy and I had everything for it. Oh my goodness! It was so yummy and juicy! I had a five pound whole chicken and I cooked it for in an hour and a half. Perfect. I used real butter too. Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow.

Ok so my first time making a whole chicken and I was a bit overwhelmed. I came across this recipe and it was amazing! I didn't have onion powder but I had dried onions (the kind that come in a shaker) and let me tell ya... fantastic! The dried onions added a crunch and browned very nicely. I did leave the bird in an extra 15 minutes because I was unsure if it was cooked. Certainly a fantastic and easy recipe.

The recipe is perfect. I followed all that she said except I didnt have onion powder so I used garlic powder, I had some jerk seasoning lying around and I put one packet all over the chicken as well and I baked on 425 for about an hour. Delicious and perfect!

I have made this recipe a few times for our family. It is very moist and juicy. Really easy to make and is always great every time. No need to tweak anything. Just make it as it says and your chicken will be flavorful and juicy every time.

Wonder if there is any suggestions for larger chickens...a 5 pound chicken, how long should it cook? I like the idea of the seasonings including the celery...just now trying it, hope it comes out ok...just wish I knew how long would be appropriate to cook!!

This recipe is so simple, and I was so surprised how juicy it was. I've never had such a moist chicken! We made this last night, and I already want to make it again! We also cut up some onions and baby potatoes and put them in the roasting pan. So good!

Simple, tasty, wonderful. This is perfect with steamed veggies and sticky rice.  I use butter, because margarine is not something I typically have on-hand.

Super easy roasted chicken.  One change that I did, was to add a lemon to the cavity along with the celery and used Smart Balance light instead of butter.  Rave reviews and will definitely make again.

I made this for the people I care for.  I rarely have chicken at home because my huband hates chicken, I love it, so my chicken skill vary. This recipe was simple and delish.  This time I have added sprigs of rosemary.  So juicy and tender. TY for submitting

Made this for Sunday dinner and it is great. Easy to make with simple ingredients. Only change we made was substitute garlic powder for the onion mainly because kids hate onion or even the hint of it but they love anything garlic and used butter instead of margarine. Other than that, did exactly what the recipe called for. Smelled wonderful cooking and it is the juiciest, most tender chicken I have ever had. Leftovers will make great sandwiches and salads. Will definitely make again.

I read a few of the emails before hand. My wife and daughter "gave it me" for such a juicy and tender chicken!  Be aware that the cooking time Does Not reflect that actual ready time. Add the 30 minute, tented portion on.

Finished product looks and tastes wonderful. Important to use thermometer as larger chickens will take longer to reach 180 degrees.

This chicken ROCKS!! I will never make chicken another way again. When we picked off all the meat I used the carcass to make chicken soup  & it was the best stock I have ever had. Juicy chicken & rich stock, this recipe is a winner hands down!

first let me say, I appreciate all the reviews and everywhere they go.  I'd rather deep dive into a recipe with 1500 reviews than page through 1500 recipes with 1 review.  I don't want to waste time and money if I don't have exact ingredients and it's great to read someone else's experience.  that said.... I don't buy whole chickens, so I had some leg quarters, no onion powder, so I layered the celery and onions on the bottom, stuffed each portion with garlic and butter, and remaining butter on top.  sprinkled garlic power on top and baked as directed.  OMG awesome!!  juicy and moist, with great skin!  Sometimes it takes a village to cook a chicken...

The most simple things are the tastiest! This little bird has a lot of flavor! I normally don't do "exact" measures but used the exact ingredients, same temperature and cooked it as directed but left the chicken in longer to get a nice crusty exterior. I've made this roasted chicken twice and it has never failed me, so juicy, flavorful, and fast to make. What are you waiting for? Go put that bird in the oven!

I tried this recipe today because was simple; just what I was looking for.  I wasn't, however, expecting much from it.   What a pleasant surprise!  The chicken was juicy with a crisp skin and tasty drippings, the best I've ever made!  We loved it!  I made two minor changes.  I used garlic powder in place of onion power because I didn't have onion powder on hand and I used butter in place of margarine because as one other reviewer said, "margarine is not food."  I'll never roast a chicken any other way again.  Thank you ROBINROCKINGBIRD and your Grandma.  Jacqui Yonkers, New York

I didn't follow the exact instructions for seasoning- I stuffed my chicken with sliced lemons, garlic, and onions as well as some herbs and margarine. But as far as cooking instructions go- this was literally THE MOST juicy, perfect chicken I have ever had.

Have this in the oven right now.  I've made several times and it's always delicious!  I do add some garlic to mine, but that's it!  I love this method, and the simple list of ingredients that we always have.  Thank you so much for posting wonderful recipe from Grandma. ??

I've made this recipe many times and loved it every time!  Instead of a whole chicken, I'll usually use bone-in dark meat pieces.  Two nights ago, I baked two pounds of chicken thighs and scaled down the recipe accordingly.  Don't be afraid to be liberal with your seasonings--they really make this dish amazing!  EDIT:  I love the versatility of this recipe.  Just add your choice of seasonings and some type of fat, then bake it for 20 minutes per pound plus 15 minutes.  This time, I used garlic salt, pepper, and olive oil, and cooked my 4.5-lb chicken for 1 hr 45 min.  Yum!

I definitely looked at this recipe and thought that it seemed way too simple and used way too much butter. But I followed it to a T (very generously salted, peppered and onion powdered) and it was... delicious. It smelled sort of like ramen when it was baking, and filled the house with that savory, buttery, meaty, oniony umami scent. We baked it at the exact specified temperature and time, forgot to baste the chicken at the end but DID tent it for 30 minutes, and it still came out amazing. The breast meat was juicy, the skin was crispy and flavorful, and the carcass made delicious soup the next day. Our guests actually fought over their favorite chicken pieces. We used a super cheap chicken, and will definitely be buying more whole chickens when they are on sale for this recipe. This is just as good, if not better, than my beloved rotisserie chicken. But next time, I will actually use margarine as called for instead of salted butter to cut down on cost. Don't be afraid to try this one - you will not be disappointed! Garlic, rosemary, etc. not necessary: all you need is this recipe!

I cooked this for my meat eating boyfriend as his Christmas dinner. It was easy for me to prepare and he totally LOVED it. The rating system we use for my cooking is based on a monetary type system (how much he would pay to eat this meal in a restaurant) this turned out to be a $23 entree. :-)

I have made this recipe too many time to count since it first appeared, I think it's my husbands favorite Sunday meal.  I follow the recipe exactly but I do lay the chicken on a bed of veggies because the timing and the temperature are right. When the chicken is done I take it out, put the veggies in a bowl and lightly tent the bird and do not carve it for a minimum of 30 minutes.  This gives me plenty of time to make my gravy  and mash my boiled potatoes.  Smart Balance (regular) is my choice of margarine.  I love that this recipe is so simple, I have been a bride for 52 years but a bride of 52 days will have equal success!

I make this 3 or 4 times a month. Ridiculously easy and immensely delicious. It's also a great base recipe from which you can add or subtract ingredients to your family's liking. The leftovers make great chicken soup!

First recipe I ever tried for Roasted Chicken, it's a winner. Hard to try others because it is so good. I did add garlic cloves and onion to the cavity. I switch it up sometimes by trying other members suggestions, but the basic recipe is Fantastic.

I modified, as I found this recipe after the trip to the store; had no celery, but I bought Stove Top stuffing (Herbs flavor), so that was cooked in microwave, then went into the cavity. Instead of using margarine, I dried the outside of the bird, then rubbed olive oil all over the bird. We used a mix of 5 seasonings (1 T each) in a bowl: Huey's burger seasoning (from a Memphis restaurant), Tony Chachere's seasoning, celery salt, onion powder, and Mrs. Dash salt-free garlic seasoning. I'm sure you can mix whatever sounds good to you, but these turned out fabulous. And we had a big chicken, 6 lbs, so  I followed the general rule for poultry roasting: 20 mins/lb, plus 15 mins, or 2 hrs 15 mins. One reviewer gave a poor rating because her 4.5 lb chicken didn't cook through, although this recipe clearly states this is for a 3 lb bird! I had to find the rule elsewhere, but it worked: our bird had a temp of 180F in the deep thigh after resting 5 minutes (birds will cook a little bit after you remove them from the oven, so a delayed temp is more accurate). Probably could've gotten out 10-15 minutes earlier, as long as the temp is at or above 165F. Made gravy with pan drippings, 3/4 cup of chardonnay wine, and flour/cold water mixture (about 1.5 T AP flour). Excellent!

I used two chickens from  Costco, roasted  them about 1 hour 50 minutes, when cool took the meat off of the bones, simmered the bones and  skin in chicken broth, i  use  just Aldies chicken broth,  and drippings that were in the pan.  (don't use water) simmer about  1 1/2  hours, or till  meat and bones flavor the broth.  I then I strained the  broth for  my  soup.  Be sure to  used the drippings. I continued to make my soup, I  added onions celery carrots, when veg's were done I added  rice or noodles  and some of the  meat.   It makes a  lot, so I freeze  some of the broth and add the rice or noodles or whatever I'm in the mood for  when I  take it from the freezer you will never have better soup, but don't skim off  all of the chicken fat, that is what makes it  good and cures a  cold. (you can indulge one in awhile)I have a food saver so I freeze the broth in  a plastic container and when it is  frozen solid I remove  from the container and  vacuum  pack it. I usually freeze  4 cup containers because it it  just two of us.  I also  cube the cooked meat that I removed from the bones and  vacuum pack that in two or three cup packages for further casserole.  The  only way to make good  chicken soup is to roast the chicken.   Enjoy!

This recipe is amazing.  I've never made a roasted chicken or gravy before.. and both were incredible!  My family couldn't believe it.  "This is fall off the bone good"..."This is restaurant good".  I added a few things.. I used 8 cloves of garlic (sliced), half of them in the cavity and half on top of the chicken.  I also used 2 lemons (sliced): one inside the cavity and one on top of the chicken.  I also increased the butter amount to 2 sticks of butter (sliced)-one under the skin and the other on top.  The only thing that was not perfect was the time it took.. The smallest chicken I could find was 4.79 pounds and it took 2.75 hours to cook.. but it was well worth the wait.  The gravy was scrumptious too:  After removing the chicken from the pan, I put the pan on the stove top on Med heat.  I mixed in 2 tablespoons of flour and a cup of chicken broth and stirred until it was starting to come to a boil.  It was so yummy!  I will make this again and again.  Everyone loved it, even my picky picky 5 year old.

Absolutely amazing roasted chicken!  I followed the directions to the T and made no changes.  I have to say it is the best roasted chicken I have ever made.  It was incredibly juicy and not dry at all, had an a wonderful flavor, and the skin was nice and crisp.  My sis-in-law couldn't stop raving about it!  My family can't wait for me to make it again!!

This roasted chicken was yummy.I followed the recipe except for adding garlic powder to the onion powder, salt and pepper. I also smashed some garlic and added it to the celery in the cavity. Although it took a lot longer to cook then the recipe stated it was well worth it. The flavors went clear to the bone and it was so moist and tender. I can hardly wait to eat the leftovers. In fact, I think I'll go raid the fridge. Thank you for your recipe. Andrea

Really nice flavor combination with the onion powder and celery, I didn't have fresh celery, so I used celery seed instead and I also added a generous 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. Will make it again using celery....but it works very well with celery seed.

This really is a great recipe - a simple one dish meal with delicious results! The only changes I made were: I used butter instead of margarine and halved the amount to reduce fat content. Didn't have onion powder so I used poultry seasoning instead. Added 1/4 sweet onion to the celery in the cavity. Chopped up an additional stalk of celery, 1/4 sweet onion, potatoes, carrots, broccoli and added 1/4 cup water to the roasting pan for a full one-dish meal. I will make this again and recommend it!

This was the best chicken recipe I've done without a cooking bag.  I did use the tips from other reviewers and added my usual spices to add flavor and the taste was fantastic and the chicken was juicy.  I used "light" butter and my chicken was about 4 or 4.5 lbs.  I will definitely make this again.

IT WAS VERY JUICY..DID NOT ALTER IT AT ALL AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS..I guess I am used to alot more spice..My husband was not impressed at all..I wanted to add celery salt..sage..poulty season just like I do to all my whole chickens to give it that Thanksgiving taste..It was so bland..juicy..but very very bland..add all the dry spices u want..I added them to the gravy and it saved the chicken..thankgoodness..add garlic salt..everything u like..it still turns out really juicy..but with more flavor. I also did margarine bc some review said it made a huge difference. I think salted sweet cream butter like I use on everything would hv made it just as juicy..I will make it again..but use all my favorite spices!!!!

I did exactly as specified on this recipe however the first 10 minutes I forgot to switch from 175 to 82deg C. Overall, great flavor. 1 hour and 15mins plus 30mins wrapped in foil is worth the wait. My family devoured the whole bird in a matter of minutes.

This recipe is def. a keeper. I followed instructions but added a few ingredients. I added some garlic powder, dried rosemary and chili flakes to the rub which was divine. In addition, I roasted the chicken on bed of onions and added just a wee bit of chicken broth as well to ensure enough to baste. So moist, so delicious. A must try!Oh - don't leave out the celery! It does add a lovely flavor!

I hardly ever get around to reviewing/rating recipes, but I have used this one so many times I knew I had to make sure I got around to it this time.  I actually used this recipe for the first time when I was roasting a turkey for Thanksgiving, and I got such rave reviews that I tried it the next time I roasted a chicken with the same results.  My husband constantly tells people "you have to try my wife's chicken!"  Kids love it too.  The only changes I make are stuffing some Smart Balance (what I use for margarine) under the skin as well as on top of it. I also use a light sprinkling of poultry seasoning instead of onion powder.  I also flip the chicken over for the 30 minutes under the foil tent to allow the juices to flow down through the chicken from the breast.  I will never need another roast chicken recipe!

Best roasted chicken recipe I have ever made.  The chicken was crispy, moist and tasty and the celery was delicious as well!

This came out wonderfully~ I used onion instead of celery, since I didn't have any celery on hand. And we love onion. It did take a little longer to cook~maybe 20 minutes. For about 45 minutes I cooked it breast side down, then turned it over for the rest of the cooking time.
I also put some of the butter between the meat and skin. My family devoured it....I will definitely be making this again.

This chicken was delicious. In addition to the salt & pepper, I used a blend of spices that includes onion powder, minced garlic and oregano. The chicken was browned to perfection, juicy and delicious. This will definitely be one of my go to recipes!

This was my first attempt at a roast chicken and it was so simple and it's AMAZING. I basted every 20 minutes and put a couple cloves of garlic in the cavity along with a small sliced onion in the bottom of the pan. It definitely takes longer than an hour and 15 minutes though, in total it was a little shy of 2 hours. I will definitely be making this again and again. My entire family loved it.

OMG!  This is better then MY MOM'S!  (Hope she doesn't see this!)  Wow-I took one bite and had to give this 5 stars.  Very Juicy.  I used butter plus the suggested spices and added thyme...Delicious.  I cooked 2 chickens for my men to pick at this weekend while I will be away...I am sure this won't last a day!
Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I am glad I found it!

Wonderful!  I made the recipe as written.  I placed some potato, whole mushrooms and sweet onion wedges in the roasting pan next to the bird.  Delicious.  I expected the celery to be mush, but it still had some bite to it.  Tasty.  I'm putting this in my favorites file.

This was absolutely fantastic - I did this for my Easter Sunday dinner, made it exactly as directed, and it got rave reviews all around. It really is this simple - the chicken was incredibly moist and had a beautiful skin. And because we Southerners just can't serve any meat without some kind of sauce or gravy, I made a very simple au jus from the pan drippings, some added water and a small amount of chicken stock. Truthfully, I don't think the chicken really needed it - it was plenty moist enough; I just have menfolk in my family who can't stand the thought of not having something to spoon over the meat. I did this with a family-size roaster chicken, so it took a considerably longer time to roast (soooooo worth it, though) - but I was able to use the leftovers for a really awesome chicken salad. Hands down, this recipe is a keeper!

I followed this recipe’s exact specifications and found the chicken to actually be under cooked and in some areas gelatinous.   I have to crank the oven up to 400 and finish for 30 more minutes and I was not happy with the result.

I've done your chicken and will be doing two more for this Easter's dinner.  Absolutely fabulous!  I did use real butter and put it under the skin and added a onion to the cavity as well as the celery.  Perfect!  I named it 'Crackle Chicken' because I could hear the skin crackle and cook.  Amazing and thank you for this!!!!

Tried this recipe tonight! The husband loved it. Only thing I did differently was added garlic powder in the onion powder for more flavor and baked it breast side down. The meat came out incredibly juicy! Will be making this dish again!!

This was THE BEST and EASIEST roast chicken ever! I used real butter (I don't like all the chemical stuff like margarine) and I added garlic and herbs de provence, and it was spectacular. I think I'll use less butter than recommended next time, but I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

I tried this recipe and found it to be the juiciest roasted chicken.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I had to make it without the celery and with onion powder instead of salt because didn't have them, and it was still terrific.  Next time I'll make sure and try it with celery and onion salt!

This was terrific and simple.  I didn't have a whole chicken so I used chicken quarters.  I put the butter under the skin and and dotted the extra over the top of all.  I put the celery pieces among the pieces.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and got yummy, juicy chicken!  A keeper, thanks!

Other than using butter instead of margarine, I followed this recipe exactly.  It was, hands-down, the tastiest and juiciest chicken I've ever made.  It was very flavourful - didn't need additional seasoning in my opinion.  I'm going to try the same with turkey.  I used a cookie sheet lined with foil (suggestion by a reviewer) and made a gravy with 1 tbsp cornstarch and 1 cup of water.  Really yummy on mashed potatoes &/ rice.

Very moist and flavorful! I followed this easy recipe to a "T" and it came out just perfect! My friend was skeptical about the onion powder, because, like most folks, she has always roasted chickens with just salt and pepper. She was very impressed with the flavor, so if you're on the fence with the onion powder, I recommend giving it a shot. The chicken came out very moist as well.  I will give some of the credit to the bird that I used as it was truly free-range, organic, farm-raised, with no hormones or anything like that. Really fresh. My chicken was right at 3 pounds. I will continue to roast chickens in the manner since I see no room for improvement.

I thought this recipe was entirely too bland to be so highly rated.  Juiciest chicken we've ever had in our lives.  Ever. It may have something to do with the fact that I accidentally cooked it upside down, I don't know.  I will happily accidentally do that all the time now!  The only thing I changed, besides the position, was the time and temp.  It was a 5 lb chicken and I only had 2 hours so I cranked it up to 375.  2 hours at 375 with a 5 lb chicken upside down yielded an amazingly juicy, fall off the bone, cut the breast with a fork chicken that I can't wait to make again!  Oh, and I used butter, not margarine.

This is a great recipe! I prefer to have my chicken crispy on the outside, so I don't cover my bird and let it rest for the additional 30 minutes. Instead I just cook it for 15-30 minutes longer and cover with olive oil before seasoning. This yields a layer of crispy chicken skin on top of moist and flavorful chicken.

I'm sorry.  I found this to be too greasy.  I think basting the chicken AFTER removing from the heat was a mistake..... it made the crispy skin soggy and greasy.  Also, letting it sit for 30 minutes resulted in us eating cold chicken!  I did like the seasonings and I'll make it again melting a bit of margarine and simply basting the chicken at the beginning, then adding the spices, and DEFINITELY skipping the end basting step.  Maybe I'll let it cool for 10 minutes.

I baked it for 1:15 covered it and left it in the oven til later on. I went it reheat it, I cut the leg and it was still pink and bloody. There was a rule I heard never cook a bird less than 375 cause bacteria grows and volia samonella! So I am now reheating it at 400. Smells great.

Although very juicy, I thought that this was kind of bland. The bird just didn't soak up any flavor from the seasonings or butter. We ended making a quick gravy to go over it for some saltiness. I will say that this chicken did soak up flavor very well when I used up the leftovers in a chicken noodle soup recipe. We also had to cook our bird about 45 minutes longer than stated. A good base recipe to play around with the seasoning.

The best chicken ever, and ridiculously easy. Used butter instead of margarine and not nearly what the recipe called for. Rubbed it all over the skin and used lots of seasoning. Was perfectly cooked in 1 hour 20 minutes.

I made this tonight for dinner.  It was great!  Really juicy.  I did not have the onion power so I used a little garlic powder and it was still good.  Next time I will try it with the onion powder.  My husband loved it!  I also added two stalks of broccoli in the pan and it was also delicious.

This was the juciest chicken I have ever had. I will never again cook one without the celery! I went to start slicing the breast meat and juice squirted out and hit my cupboard door!

Simple w/ incredible taste.  I stuffed the chicken 1/2 chopped onion along w/the celery. Make a delcious & "beautiful" meal! I did cook an additional 20 mins more than recipe called for, otherwise the chicken was not done. Be sure to use a meat thermometer (near thigh section) to ensure doneness.

This is a good Paleo dinner. If you are totally dairy free use coconut oil instead of butter. I did 2 whole chickens in a roaster pan. One with onion and one with garlic. I have to say side by side the onion one was the better of the 2. I also used a quality salt (French sea salt)and pepper that I just mixed a bunch together and spread it on liberally YUMMY!!! will do again! I am using the left over bones to make chicken broth!

I loved this. Quick, easy and so flavorful!  I added about a quarter cup of Bluemoon carmel apple beer (seasonal) to the bottom of the pan and put the lid on the roaster the last 1/2 hour of cooking and it was crazy moist and soooo yummy! The best part - the left overs were just as good the next day! Goes on my regular menu for sure.

Very flavorful and the moistest chicken I have ever made. I only had to adjust the baking time because of the size of my chicken. I'm so happy I don't have to keep searching for the best roast chicken because I found it here!

I've tried this recipe now three times. The 2nd time I tried adjusting the recipe and it didn't come out nearly as good. Trust me and follow the recipe as written! The only thing you may need to adjust is cooking time if your chicken is a little bigger (generally 25 min per pound at this temperature). Also, make sure to allow enough time for the chicken to rest the full 30 minutues....makes all the difference! Super juicy! My husband has asked for this to be in our dinner rotation....frequently!

We Bought a organic chicken  We made the chicken according to the recipe. Moist and tender is a understatement. I'm going to make homemade  chicken enchiladas from a recipe I found on this  
site with the left over chicken breast. This Roasted chicken reminds me when my mom always had something special like this on Sundays when I was a kid.

Best roasted chicken I've ever had! I grew up eating roast turkey, which was often dry and tasteless, so I never saw the appeal of roast poultry, but this has forever changed my opinion. The leftovers are especially great for sandwiches. Thanks for sharing!

I just learned how to truss a chicken which helps keep ck moist by preventing steam to enter the cavity and drying out the breast. I trussed my ck and used this recipe substituting lemon and thyme in the cavity instead of celery...it was so good.

This recipe is great!!  My husband and 2-year old love to eat this for dinner, and it is such an easy fix.  I can also substitute an onion for the celery, and it still comes out juicy and well- seasoned.  Depending on the size of the chicken, I will sometimes keep the oven on while it is covered with the foil to ensure  doneness.

Really Amazing and Juicy Chicken!  I added half an onion to the cavity as well as the celery stalk.  My husband said it was even better than our tried and tested bi-monthly recipe and my boys ate everything on their plates.

I made my first roast chicken ever using this recipe, and it was absolutely delicious. Super easy, and the end result was perfect. The celery makes for a nice little treat to munch on. My mother never taught me how to cook, and she was very impressed with how this chicken came out. Get ready for the compliments if you make it!

I followed this recipe nearly exactly, using butter instead of margarine, and it was sensational. I grew up eating rather dry, tough roasted chicken, so I thought I would rarely roast poultry in my own kitchen. This was my first attempt, and now all I want to do is roast chicken. It was just too easy, and ridiculously delicious. I stripped the bones of all the meat I could and used the leftovers for chicken chilaquiles the next day. I do wonder if similar results could be achieved with less butter/margarine, but I don't know if I want to try...this recipe is perfect as is!

Very good as is.  Used potatoes for elevation off foil covered pan.  Takes longer than instructed.  Recommend more seasoning, maybe onions inside?

This IS the juciest, tastiest chicken I've made. I had to use a little bit more seasoning; While the onion powder was the star, I added a few favorites to it... but I think it's that 30 minutes sitting covered that makes it so moist, along with the celery inside. We loved it!

tried to make it exactly like recipe but didnt't have onion powder so instead used chopped onion seasoning. Turned out really tasty and JUICY. Next time will use onion "powder" correct way and maybe rub butter on chicken first before seasoning and cook a bit longer since my husband likes a bit of crisp. This recipe is definately a keeper. Delish!

Always gets loads of compliments.   Sometimes I add an apple and/or an onion in the chicken cavity.   Definitely give the chicken time to rest.  It improves the end result, and is also a great opportunity to finish preparing the rest of the meal!

Made this for my family on Mothers Day and was a huge hit. Even picky BF said it was best chicken he has ever had! Went great with Baby red garlic mashed potatoes, cheesy garlic toast and cucumber tomatoe onion salad! I followed recipe exactly and will be making this again!!!

I did not change the recipe, i always try them as written 1st. It is absolutely my new favorite roast chicken recipe, tender, juicy and flavorful! Made for a family get together and needless to say there was none left! Thanks for sharing this!

This chicken was ok. It needed more flavour and a longer cooking time to be cooked enough to fall off the bone. I would add garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, thyme & seasoned salt if I try again. But as for the recipe as is, it was just ok.

Pretty great for how easy it was to make. Everyone ate it which is a pretty good sign in my family. My 4 year old is VERY picky (I had to tell her it was chopped up chicken nuggets) and she didn't gag (or pretend to) and said it tasted good. My husband said it was nice and juicy. I thought it was ok but the gravy (recipe on here for Chicken Gravy made with my own poultry seasoning) I made to go with it definitely kicked up the flavor to an all-around 5, however as is, it's a 4 for taste and a 5 for ease.

Best chicken ever! I originally made this recipe exactly as instructed, because I hate reviewers who give less than 5 stars when they change things! I was not disappointed at all. The bird was moist and delicious. The second time I made it I used Emeril's All Natural Chicken Rub, instead of the salt, onion powder, and pepper (since they're in it anyway), also equally awesome! The take away for me is  that the margarine and celery are key! The spices you want to use can vary and the bird will still turn out awesome. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

@ROBINROCKINGBIRD My conclusion with the butter sub is this: you can use butter, just use about 1/3 of a stick and know that it won't turn out the same because it won't be the same recipe. Outstanding bird in either case!

I never know what to do with a whole bird... I have tried different recipes here & there including making the store bought season packet/bag (100 times). My hubby never liked any of them. This one was a winner by all! Even my kids... and my MIL who hates everything... was QUIET! Mine was almost 6 Lbs so I cooked it 2hrs & used real butter. But, didn't change anything else. SO YUMMY, sooo juicy! Hubby even said "This was the best BIRD ever!" So thank you!

Absolultely amazing!  Such a simple recipe and so delicious!  I don't change a thing with this recipe except lengthening the cooking time if the chicken is bigger. My favorite part of this chicken when it is done are the wings.  They are like little pieces of heaven!  So crunchy and good!

This is a good recipe with lots of flavor.  I did make some slight changes.  I used season salt instead of salt and pepper.  I used onion instead of celery and baked it with a little chicken broth.  Had great flavor!  Hubby thought it was excellent!

2 days after we had the chicken and I'm still thinking about it! I rarely review but had to for this. I followed as is but added sliced lemons and garlic with the celery, had the chicken on top of a roasting rack with all the veggies underneath. Chicken and veg came out yum, yum, yum. So easy!

My new favorite for roast chicken, perfect every time and easy to boot.  Great as a hot roast as well as torn up and used in other dishes as it lends a fresh flavor that isn't overpowering.  Thanks Robin!

The name says it all.  This is the most juicy chicken I've ever had.  My family said that it was the best chicken they have ever had and I had to agree.  I liked it better than fried chicken.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing! I cut the butter to 3-4 teaspoons total and added some garlic cloves by cutting slits in the chicken under the skin and inserting them. Add a few inside with celery too. Use the juices as gravy.

love this recipe.  i just added a few more seasonings to pump up the taste such as cumin and garlic salt.  i changed margarine to butter and eased up on the amount and drizzled olive oil to moisten chicken.

I agree with the rest of the reviews - perfect as written.  The only thing I changed was the time (a little longer) since my chicken was 5 pounds.  I'm thinking the foil tent helped to keep it moist, but the taste was also delicious.

Good recipe.  Didn't have onion powder, so I used Garlic powder instead.  Also, put some slices of onions in the cavity.  Accidentally over cooked it because I my thermometer broke, but it still turned out very good.  Both my 3 & 4 year olds liked it.  Will make again, but might change it up a little more next time.

Yum!  I was very pleased with the outcome of this chicken.  I stuffed the bird with celery, onion, and fresh, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme.  My daughter who is very picky loved it!

I was very skeptical of this dish because there so few ingredients.  I followed directions to the letter and I have to admit it was the best chicken I have had in a long time.  I use better than buoillon chicken to make some broth and use it with the pan juices to make a gravy.  super yummy.

Did this a little different for time contraints.  Slightly defrosted, I put butter dabs under the skin along with the spices, and inside the caivity as well.  Cooked in the crock pot, first two hours on high for the semi frozen chicken, then finished about four hours on low.  This was fall apart delicious and moist, even the white meat.  The remaining liquid could be used for a soup base.  Doing it this way you don't get the roasted skin, but it sure is good and juicy.  The celery really seems to add something.  Simple and easy.

I made this just like the recipe except I also used garlic powder with the onion powder.  My chicken was also almost 4 pounds.  This was the best chicken our family ever had.  We are dark meat eaters but we ate the whole chicken...it was wonderful.  NExt time I am going to put a little butter under the skin and try to get a little more flavor into the meat but it really is not necessary--you can just dribble the chicken drippings on your meat. If you want a great chicken without much trouble this is the recipe to use!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This recipe was so simplistic, yet fantastic! I followed the recipe, except I used butter because that's all I had.  (Which I usually use on my chicken anyway.)  The flavor was so good, and the chicken was very juicy.  My family devoured it!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

MAN THIS WAS GOOD!  It just seemed to be the perfect blend of seasoning.  I don't know if the celery made a difference but I had it in there.  I used butter vs. Margarine.

Not sure why this got so many good reviews.  Yes, it was tender, but it really wasn't very flavorful.  I had to add salt after I cut it up and put all of the juices over it and I had already seasoned it really well to begin with.  Smelled delicious...tasted okay.  Probably won't make again.

I was a doubting Thomas, but I tried the recipe, just as Robinrockingbird wrote it.  This is one of the most simple, and delicious roasted chickens that I have ever made. I used Smart Balance Margarine, and it made a beautiful, browned crust that locked in all the juiciness.  Delicious...THIS IS A WINNER!!!!

My first attempt at a roasted chicken and it was a bog hit. I added some lemon and garlic into the cavity...and omitted the celery..those were  my only changes. Delish!

Unbelievably juicy chicken! My husband instantly shouted "GAWDAM THAT so good!" as soon as he took his first bite. 
I was rewarded that night because he was so happy with his dinner.
I used the leftovers to make him a chicken sandwich for his lunch the next day.
He was very happy. 
Thank you for the excellent recipe!

OMG. OMG. This recipe is simple, easy, and amazing. I wanted to make a good at home meal on a budget and my grocery store had roasting chickens on sale so naturally I did a search for roast chicken recipes and decided on this one based on the reviews and the fact that it didn't require a lot of ingredients. My bird was over 5 lbs so I had to roast it more like 2 1/2 hours. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. My boyfriend loved it and I didn't even have to argue with my 3 year old about eating his dinner. I will definitely make this over and over again!

I read Jenny's review from 2/11/2008 and had to laugh, because my initial reaction - after reading the ingredients and cooking method - was also, "What's the big deal??"  But, Jenny was absolutely correct, because I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written (only extending the cooking time a bit, because I prefer a "browner" skin), and it came out PERFECT!!  It was the juiciest chicken I have EVER made ... we did not even need the gravy that I had made, as a "just in case it needs a little boost" precaution.  This recipe proves that sometimes, less IS best.  Thank you so much for sharing your grandmother's recipe.

Excellent recipe! I've tried many different recipes and this is the only one I now use. It is so quick and simple to prepare and the result is a better tasting juicier roast chicken then that of other recipes that take many more ingredients, and much more time to prepare.

The last review I read was something like "If you are like me, you'll read the ingredients and think 'whats the big deal'"....
I am here to agree with that 1000%

This chicken was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!
I went exactly by the recipe step by step and wow! YumO
I also used leftovers to make sandwiches the next day and it was even better!

I came back to the recipe now, so that I can use the same method on my Christmas Turkey =)

I made this for the first time tonight for my boyfriend and we both loved it! It was the most juicy and tender chicken I've ever made. I also injected butter under the skin because I like the skin to get a little bit crispy. Definitely use the drippings for gravy, the flavor is amazing! Thanks for the great recipe!

Don't bother dirtying the silverware...this falls off the bone!!  My family said "Mom made the best chicken ever!"  It drives me crazy when people tweak then rate the recipe but I must confess I stuck a couple whole cloves are garlic in the bird and shook a little garlic powder on it and a sprinkle of Herbs de Provence, too.  No doubt this is fabulous either way.  I cannot wait to use the leftovers.  Bones are even in the fridge to make stock.  I thank you.  My family loves you :)

Very moist and juicy. This really is a great recipe, but I have two small criticisms. 

First, the term "generously" is a little vague. If your chicken turns out bland, like mine did, then you may not have been generous enough with the salt and pepper. I don't use much salt and pepper usually so what seemed generous to me may have been a little light.  

Second, maybe 1 or 2 Tbsps less margarine.  I used a small roaster pan and there was just too much liquid in the pan.  

The chicken was very moist and juicy and everyone loved it despite it being pretty bland.  Next time I will add a bit more seasoning, maybe a pinch of garlic powder, too, and cut back just a bit on the margarine.

Awesome recipe!  I sliced up garlic and lemons and put them in the cavity along with putting lemon juice all over the outside.  I basted the chicken every 20 minutes as well.  Turned out so juicy!

This is exactly what it says ‘Juicy Roasted Chicken’. The only thing missing in the title is ‘Awesome’! The one thing I do differently is that I chunky chop onion up instead of using onion powder. The cavity is salted and filled with the onion, celery and margarine. Then I roast it just as written. I always make two chickens for this meal, because not only is it most frequently requested, but we always end up with guests! The gravy made from the roasted chicken is simply superb! It is most often served with a variety of roasted veggies. This is a definite keeper as it turns out perfectly each and every time!

Loved it, I always have to cook the chicken longer than recipe guidelines, probably my oven!  Hit with kids too!

Delicious! My bird was about 6 lbs. and it ended up needing about 3 and a half hours in the oven. But, it was well worth the wait! I paired it with some homemade mashed potatoes for a perfect dinner.

This was excellent.  I roasted a 6.82 chicken for 
2 1/2 hours and it came out perfect. I will for sure be having this again.  Thank you!

Based on all reviews, I followed this recipe exactly but for the onion powder.  We like garlic.  I used garlic & herb seasoning.  This is the BEST & JUICEST roasted chicken ever.  Wonderful flavor.

Delicious!  Made a tender, juicy and flavorful bird.  I did add a little garlic powder and used white pepper.  Very good chicken.

Very good and juicy just like you described.  Don't be afraid to go with a lot of salt.  I could have used a little more.  The gravy was delicious.  Both my husband and granddaughter loved it.  I am making chicken soup with the left overs tomorrow and I'll bet that will be great also.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a simple recipe and it's simply delicious!  I am the sort of person who likes to tink around with recipes and change them a bit.  This one I left alone and it was PERFECT.  Hubby is a bit of a chicken snob, and he said it was the best chicken he's ever tasted.

The  combination of easily on-hand, simple ingredients made this chicken superb!  I made gravy with a cup of water, 1/2 cup of white wine and a tablespoon of cornstarch added to the pan drippings......awesome!  The only problem I had, and I'm sure it's not the recipe....my roaster chicken's breasts were tough!  I never experienced this before!  But the dark meat and wings were moist and juicy.  Go figure.  I will make this again, hopefully my chicken will have tender breasts the next time!

Fantastic roast chicken!  I made two thinking I would have plenty left to make chicken salad but most of it was eaten that night!  We had a guest for dinner that night and he went back for seconds and thirds and said it was the best chicken he's ever had.  While the recipe is nothing fancy the results were a wonderfully juicy, tasty simple chicken that I think would work with any side dishes you care to make.

Omg! I am surprised! This was absolutely the most moist chicken I have EVER had! I followed the recipe but added more seasonings inside the bird as well as outside. In the cavity I did 1/2 stick of butter, bay leaves, 2 whole all spice, celery and carrots. I put the chicken in a dutch oven. in the bottom I put the other 1/2 stick of butter and then I poured in a little white wine. Covered and baked for 3 hours- took the lid off for the last 30- 45mins of baking. I had a 5.5 lb chicken. It came out so amazing! Thank you for this recipe! I will only make chicken this way. The breasts were juicy and tender. Much more with this recipe than with beer butt chicken. Thanks again!

This was the juiciest roast chicken I've ever made!  Mine was close to 6 lbs so I roasted for about 2  hours.  I added garlic powder and rubbed the seasoning and butter under the skin and rubbed the rest of the seasoning all over the chicken.  I also added garlic cloves inside the cavity.  I sprinkled some paprika for color then sprayed with "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" all over the chicken. The skin was crispy & tasty.  I was generous with the seasoning so the meat was tasty as well.

I had a 6 lbs. chicken and goofed on the instant read thermometer so the breast meat was a bit dry, but not bad.  I had just enough butter and margarine combined for the job - putting some of the butter under the breast skin.  I added some garlic powder to the mix but otherwise followed the recipe.  This smells WONDERFUL in the kitchen - just a hint of how it tastes - so, so good.  I used the drippings to fry (already microwaved) potatoes in 'til crispy - which made the perfect accompaniment along with a simple green salad.  This is perfect for that whole chicken you don't want to bother cutting up and the day you just want dinner on the table without a lot of work.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.  It will be a staple in our house.

I made this chicken almost exactly according to the recipe, except I putt] garlic inside along with celery. The chicken itself was pretty bland; I was surprised because of all the rave reviews. But the gravy that came from the drippings was AWESOME. I just scraped the pan clean and put it in a saucepan. I beat some corn flour with water and added it to the drippings to thicken them. Came out delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried numerous times to cook meat dinners in the oven. This is the first successful recipe that I have found online. So successful it was, that I was asked if it was home cooked or store bought. My little one asked if we could have this all the time. A definite winner for us!

Love it! Great quick recipe! I added rosemary, as I always do in my roasted chicken, but I think it actually would have been great without it. I used the drippings to pour over the breast meat, but wish i had made rice to drizzle over... There's always a next time! Thanks for the great oldschool, foolproof, quick, and tasty recipe!

Really good!  Needed a little bit longer cooking time, but I think that may have had to do with the convection feature on our oven.  Will definitely make it again!

Delicious!  My chicken was 5 1/3 lbs, so I doubled the celery and seasonings but not the butter.  One stick seemed right for my size chicken.

How could something SO simple be SO good? And if it is this simple, then how did I ever make a bad chicken? I don't know. What I DO know was that this was OUTSTANDING. I had a larger chicken (5.5 lbs) so I cooked it longer. There were so many drippings that I was able to toss in chopped carrots towards the end, and make gravy (by just whisking in some sifted flour) when all was done.

This is always my go-to recipe for chicken. I love the flavor and it always turns out so moist. Leftovers make great chicken & noodles!

I made this today using a 7.3 LB chicken. It was very moist, but WAY TOO MUCH butter! I used 1/2 C. as directed. If I make it again, I'll use less butter.

I didn't have the spices for my usual roast chicken recipe, so I gave this a try instead.  It was so disappointing, I definitely will not be making it again.  It tasted a lot like powdered onion, not like real food.

Truly simple and delicious. I did't have onion powder and ended up putting a medium size onion into the cavity, and still came up great.

I just had friends over for dinner and made this recipe.  Wow! Absolutly delicious! I followed the directions to a tee except I used a fresh onion instead of onion powder.  Chicken was moist and melted in our mouths... everyone enjoyed it!  Five Stars!  *****

I tried this tonight, and also added a poultry seasoning and lemon to the butter.  I also put in lemon slices and cubed potatoes inside.  It turned out unbelievably juicy, but could do with a little more flavor

I'm not really sure how and why the celery adds to the juiciness of this chicken, but my goodness it is JUICY!  Best way to roast a chicken, hands-down.

Turned out very juicy!  Had a 6 lb chicken and I did exactly what she had in the recipe with the exception of celery as I didn't have any.  I can only think that may have made it better even!  It was nice and juicy just need some flavoring as in seasoning but overall .. really really good!

I was VERY surprised at this one!  During the cooking process I was wondering because there was no juice in the bottom of the roaster, and the chicken itself LOOKED dry.  But appearances are deceiving, all the juices were inside the bird

I added half of a large onion into the roaster, added water after I took the chicken out and boiled the well roasted onion for quite a while.  I also snuck in a gravy mix before thickening.  Since the juice all stays inside, I had to get a lil creative.  But it was all worth it in the end, VERY easy and tasty recipe.  Thanks a ton for sharing your family secret :-)

We all love this chicken.  I add a cut up onion to the pan and use a mixture of garlic salt on the inside of the bird and regular salt on the outside.   We had this with Scalloped Potatoes and Onions and BLT salad.  Delicious!  All the plates were clean.

This is the best roasted chicken I have ever made!  I added some things like 1/2 a small sweet onion and a 1/3 of a lemon to the cavity since I was out of onion powder.  I also baked for 2 hours at 300 since I had to leave the house while cooking it.  I checked the temp and it was higher than I wanted but it was still so moist and juicy, perfect.  We had nothing left but bones afterward.  The gravy was divine too!  I used Wondra flour (found at walmart) and gravy was done in less than 2 minutes!  Best meal I have cooked in a long time including thanksgiving turkeys!  Must be the butter but who cares???-----Update----I make at least once a week now as directed although last time I had no celery and used a meyers lemon since it was on hand.  It's my husband's favorite meal.

I'm all for quick and delicious meals, and never thought something so simple would come together so well. I didn't try this (vegetarian) but I made it for my husband and he thought it was one of the juiciest chicken dishes I've ever made. I'll definitely be making this again!!

Amazing.  My whole family (husband, grandmother, parents & in-laws) LOVED this.  Everyone in our family has very different preferences but this was 110% success.  I think the steaming/resting at the end makes all the difference in juciness!  Follow the recipe exactly & you will not be disappointed.  Thanks Robin~!

Fantastic idiot proof recipe! I combined this recipe with the "Moist Garlic Roasted Chicken". I used 1 stick celery, 8 garlic cloves, 1 lemon, thyme, salt & pepper. I pushed the garlic under the skin of the chicken and stuffed the rest inside. I used garlic salt instead of onion. I think the secret is using butter/ margarine and covering the chicken and letting it rest for 30 minutes. 

My family gave me two thumbs up! So I will be making this again! It is really hard to please them, but this was the juiciest chicken I have ever made. The gravy we made using the juices was the best gravy ever. 

Thanks to the person who left the review who did the recipe and won best chicken! This is going to be my secret weapon!

 Thanks grandma!

I still cannot believe how juicy this chicken was.  Next time I will try use a bit less butter on the outside and add some garlic and rosemary in the cavity.  Definitely will start roasting my own chickens from now on.

This is my go-to chicken recipe whenever I buy whole chicken.  It's so easy and so tasty and it always turns out lovely.  We make it at least twice a month!

I had to cook it longer to get it to 180, but it is moist and flavorful. I even used Smart Balance, and it came out delicious. Plenty of drippings for a quick gravy, too. And the celery is yummy!

3 Stars - I followed the recipe exactly and the bird was SUPER moist.  No complaints there!  However, the seasoning as called for results in a pretty bland bird. I will be using this recipe's cooking time again but definitely would add quite a bit more spice.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly (except for cooking time--I had a 7lb bird). It was golden brown and extremely juicy. By far the best roast chicken that I have ever made.

A big hug  to your grandmother for a delicious roasted chicken.  This recipe is easy and the results are fabulous. The skin is crispy and the meat is moist and flavorful. There's not a reason in the world why every rating for this recipe isn't 5 stars !

I made this recipe just as directed and it was sensational. Very moist and beautifully golden. I think basting the chicken every 30 minutes really helps keep it moist. Huge hit with the entire family and very easy to make. Thanks! I will use this again.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for except used real butter cause I didn't have margarine.  Great chicken.  Very juicy, but I think it could use a little more flavor.  Will definitely make again, so next time I will make gravy...

I had gotten a big toaster oven that has a rotisserie function that I was dying to try out.  I only had select ingredients on me, so I had to improvise. It came out DELICIOUS-the best roast chicken I've ever made.  I had a 3.5 pound bird, and marinated in olive oil & smartbalance spread with the onion powder, salt and pepper 4 hours in advance.  I pulled the skin away from the flesh and rubbed it in. I tucked in several cloves of garlic under the skin. I took it out of the fridge 1.5 hours before cooking to take down the temp and for the bird to relax.  I stuffed the cavity with a few scallion stalks, a head of garlic (chopped in half, still in the skin) and 10 red grapes.  It was the only fruit I had on hand, and based on other recipes, there seems to always be a fruit or veggie to add water content, thus, I tucked in the grapes.   Then I skewered the chicken using the rotisserie spit, used a needle on dental floss to tie the wing tips together and the drumsticks together. Floss is a great option when you don't have anything else!  In 1.5 hours at 350 degrees, convection on and rotisserie function on, I had a PERFECT golden brown bird that basted itself and it wasn't sitting in its own oil or drippings, so not greasy at all! I took the drippings, took off a few tbsp of fat, kept all the brown bits of meat in the roaster drip pan.  I took it to straight to the stove top, added a cup of Swanson and whisked in less than 1/4 cup of flour slowly.  It was SO scrumptious!

great recipe. We don't buy margarine so I used butter.  I also squeezed a lemon over the chicken and inside the chicken and added a wedged onion to the inside.  This was really nice for a Sunday dinner

I was floored by this chicken. WHY was it so good?!? Even the white meat was incredibly moist and delicious. I have never seen my kids vacuum up chicken so quickly; one of them didn't even like chicken until I put this on their plate!   I didn't have celery and I used butter instead of margarine. My chicken was 7# and of course I can't remember how long it took to cook, I just set the timer for 2 hours and then checked the temp until it was done. I served with stuffing w/ apples and onions and it was a huge hit. Thank you!!!

We've made this about a dozen times so far and it's very yummy! The recipe itself seems very ho hum but when done it is some of the tastiest chicken. One reviewer stated it's idiot-proof...seriously, it is. Try the recipe--you'll be happy you did.

A friend just told me to roast chicken upside down for the juiciest bird.  I'll try this one that way, but I'll flip it over for about 20 minutes to brown the top.

Delicious moist chicken!  I made it exactly as the recipe says.  Next time I'll probably use less butter.  The sauce was delicious, but there was far more than we'd eat with the chicken.

While the chicken was definitely juicy all throughout and tasty on the outside--I don't eat the skin and found the wonderful flavor didn't penetrate into the meat below.  If it soaked in brine first it would probably be better for those of us who don't eat the skin.

As is, I thought this chicken was moist but pretty bland. I made it a second time and added rosemary. I cut small slits in the skin and put the seasoning under the skin with a couple pats of butter. This seemed to allow the flavors to sink in. Wow, that kicked the flavor up.

Excellent.  Prepared just as the recipe states.  I did have to cook it about 20 minutes longer but that is most likely due to my oven.  The meat was just as promised, juicy and tender.  The chicken was definitely the star of the meal.  The leftovers were used for chicken soup which had a wonderful flavor.  This will be a "go to" recipe for me!

I was a little disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  This wasn't a bad recipe, but not much better than any rotisserie chicken you could pick up in the grocery deli - only more time, money, and work involved.  My daughter and I both thought it was just okay.  I tried very hard to use all the margarine recommended, but ran out of places to put it!  I think that most whole chickens anymore are closer to 5 lbs. (mine was) and require at least 1 1/2 hrs.  I needed about 1 3/4 hrs. to get this chicken to the acceptable point.  We had plenty of leftovers, but I'm not feeling highly motivated to use them.

The juiciest chicken I've ever had. I did make some changes just because I like a lot of flavor. I added some chopped garlic in the cavity as well and garlic powder to the bird. I also made a great gravy from the drippings. This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing!!

What on earth is it about this simple combination that can possibly turn out SO delicious?  I suppose it's the celery that keeps it so moist.  I used real butter in the recipe and followed everything else exactly.  My chicken was only 3/4 thawed, so it took 1hr and 45min to cook.  I was concered about it drying out from cooking so long so I basted it every 10 minutes after the 1 hour mark.  My goodness was it ever moist and juicy.  One of the best chickens I've ever eaten. It reminded me of turkey dinner.

Really excellent. Of course, I used BUTTER! No margarine here. Nothing wrong with a little decadence once in a while.  And I have read in some other reviews that people have omitted the onion powder. Big mistake. I roast chicken's all the time, and the onion powder gave it a little something extra. Thanks!

This recipe has the 3 components that make a meal a true culinary success..... inexpensive, easy to make and above all DELICIOUS!!!! I soaked the chicken in salt water for about 4 hours prior to cooking and also added garlic powder to the dry rub but other then that I followed the directions exactly. Served for company and got rave reviews from all.... definitely a keeper!

I didn't have margarine, so I put some butter in the cavity and then rubbed olive oil on the outside.  Also put onion, garlic and half a lemon inside the cavity; stuck garlic slivers under the skin; and basted with sherry.

This chicken was fabulous! It was super juicy and was relatively quick to make. I removed the skin from the chicken and added rosemary both on the chicken and inside of it, which gave the meat extra flavor. I will use celery whenever I roast a chicken again!

I was skeptical because of the ingredients (or lackthereof) but after reading the reviews, I decided to try it and it was phenomenal! I didn't change anything in the recipe because I wanted to see how it would turn out. I have never had a chicken so JUICY and it literally fell apart in my mouth. There wasn't too much juice/drippings when the bird was done so I used 1/3 can of chicken broth, 2 cans of cream of mushroom, the drippings and a handful of flour for gravy and it turned out great. I will definitely be cooking this again soon!

I've made chicken this EXACT way for years, and it really is the best. I do use butter instead of margarine, but I doubt there is much of a flavor difference (butter is much healthier because it's all natural, no hydrogenated fats in it).

The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is that the internal temp of 180 seems too high.  I waited for the internal temp of the traditional 165 and then covered it with foil for 10 min.  I don't know if this was a typo or if they really wanted you to cook until the internal temp was 180 if so the cook time is more like 2 hrs. not 1 hour and 15 min.  Otherwise the favor was better than an roasted chick I have ever made. Will be adding to the weekly rotation!  Thanks for such an easy recipe.  Mom said it tasted like her French Mother'chicken that she used to make!!  :)

This was good.  My chicken was almost 7 lbs. but I only used 1/2 c. butter spread.  It took me about 2 hrs and 15 minutes to roast.  The chicken was juicy and moist, but I still prefer the Roast Sticky Chicken recipe from AR.

My new go to chicken recipe...so simple and so delicious!  The only change I made was to add some chicken stock to the pan.  Bad thing is that the skin is sooooo good I want to eat it all.

This has become a staple at our house.  So simple and comes out perfectly every time.  The only change I usually make is using a bit less margarine (Smart Balance).  I wouldn't hesitate making this for dinner guests.

After reading many of the reviews, and then cooking this dish, I have come to the conclusion that as long as you use the margarine and celery the seasonings can be as personal as you choose and this dish is still amazing!!!  I did not have onion powder so I used seasoned salt and garlic powder.  Also, I used a 6 lbs. chicken and did NOT double the recipe.  It still came out incredibly juicy and delicious!!!

Best chicken I've ever had! I'll be making this my go-to recipe from here on out. I grew up vegetarian, but my husband is the opposite. I'm just really learning how to cook meat and we BOTH agreed that this was a complete success!

YUM! This was a wonderful chicken recipe. Made it for Easter dinner and it came out perfect. So moist and flavorful!
Update- made again and only used 3 TBS of real butter. In addition to the onion powder, I used paprika, a little salt and some black pepper. The celery is the trick to this super moist chicken!

I agree with the majority this is awesome!!  DH says "it was perfect, just perfect".  The only mod was that we only had onion salt so we just added pepper with it.  BTW - we had a 5.3 lb chicken.  It cooked 2 hrs at 350 degrees.  We will definitely bake this again.

Rick and I loved this chicken and especially the coating (in a cup mixed generous tablespoon of onion salt, as well as lots of salt and pepper and sprinkled inside and out).  Very tastey and juicy.

I could not believe how easy and tasty this chicken was.  It took very little time to prepare and was so juicy and tender.  I am not a fan of white meat because of the dryness but this was amazing!   I will definitely use this recipe from now on.  The only thing I did differently was to add garlic cloves and lemon slices to the cavity.  Honestly, I don't think I needed to.

Oh my gosh.  I was looking for an easy recipe to roast a chicken for some chicken noodle soup.  I can't believe how juicy this is.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that they didn't have 3 pound chickens at the store, so I used a 5 pound chicken, 7 Tbsp butter (4 inside the bird, 3 outside) and 2 stalks of celery.  The smell in my kitchen within 10 minutes of putting this in the oven was amazing.  I can't wait for the kids to come home from school and smell it.  I have been taking nibbles off of this since it was ready.  We will be lucky if there is any left for the soup!

This is the most juicy chicken I have ever made in the oven.  I have made this several times already and it is the only recipe I use for roasted chicken now.  I tried to make it once with onion in the inside because I didn't have any celery and it wasn't good.  From my experience, make sure to just use celery and don't substitute.  Thanks for a teriffic recipe. This is 5+++ stars for me.

It really is this simple! You won't buy a store bought cooked chicken again! Then use the carcass to make Fast Chicken Soup Base also on this site for homemade chicken noodle soup. Delicious! 2 great meals from 1 chicken!

Delicious! Didn't change a thing except I cooked it in the crockpot all day. So tender and juicy, it fell off the bone. The tiny bit that was leftover made a great sandwich the next day!

Hands down, the BEST roasted chicken I've ever eaten.  I will make this again & again.  The only thing I added was some fresh thyme to the butter on the skin and a sprig in the cavity.  Otherwise, make it as written and you won't be disappointed.

Juicy? YES! Although I will say that I made the mistake of using butter instead of margerine and it turned out very buttery...greasy buttery. But, the flavor was great and my husband still loved it. I'll follow the exact directions next time! My leftovers went right into a stock pot for chicken and dumplings for tomorrow night. Yum!

I LOVE roasted chicken, and have my share of recipes I use on a rotational basis so as not to get bored of the same flavors...but this recipe, by far, is THE BEST ROASTED CHICKEN I HAVE EVER MADE! I changed it up a bit from the original recipe based on other reviewers...I added about a half inch of white wine (I used  a Pinot Grigio) to the bottom of the pan, and I added celery salt generously over the whole chicken and omitted the onion salt and added garlic powder. A favorite from this day forth!

This was a great recipe, thank you.  I did add a few extra seasonings (celery salt & garlic) and more butter.  The extra butter was not necessary afterall, there was a lot of fat/grease once I removed the chicken from the roasting pan.  The drippings made for a lovely gravy.  I added baby red potatoes (quartered), celery chunks, carrot chunks and onion to the roasting pan when I started cooking the chicken.  The veggies got seasoned with the same as the bird.  Everything was fabulous!  Thank you for sharing this one, it's a keeper and the whole family raved about it.

Wow! Whole family has declared this the perfect roasted chicken. I followed the recipe exactly for my first time, found out there's no need to change a thing. My 5 year old, who I usually have to coax to finish 1 serving of chicken, had 3! she also loved the "sauce" (gravy) that I made from the drippings. This will be my go-to recipe for chicken from now on. Yum, sigh.

Ok, so I read the other reviews and thought "sounds too simple to be THAT good", but I was curious and had a craving for roast chicken so gave it a try. OMIGOD is all I can say, well that, and that I can't wait to make it again and have more than myself try it.  The other reader who said they nibbled on the celery afterwards is not alone!!  I didn't have onion powder, so used onion salt and therefore a little less than the called for amount of regular salt.  This is my definate roast chicken recipe .. THANK YOU!

i used this recipe for my first roasted chicken thanksgiving dinner with my girlfriends. It turned out perfectly and was not difficult to execute. Also a tip from one of the girls; if the chicken is larger or smaller, bake for 20 min per pound.

Simplicity at its best! This chicken was delicious and very juicy as the name says. **I did use butter (didn't have margerine and added a quartered onion to the cavity with the celery.  SO GOOD!

Had a random whole chicken in the freezer, and needed something simple for Shabbat dinner, as I just started school again and my schedule is crazy.  I stuffed the margarine and some sliced onions into the chicken Thursday night and lay the chicken on top of some diced carrots, onions, and potatoes. I then left it for my husband to roast in the morning. The 5-lb chicken roasted for about 2 hours at 350, and fell apart when he tried to cut it up today; it was that juicy and soft!  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent!  I added lemon pepper & Lawry's Seasoning salt to the skin; only used butter inside (not around in roasting pan); and basted it with dripping occasionally last 15 minutes.  It did require longer to cook in my oven though - about 1 hr 45 minutes, but could tell it was done when the juices ran clear.  Easy and very moist!!    A keeper!

This was really good,  I had a whole chicken and needed to make room i my freezer.  I seasoned with salt pepper and added a little onion and garlic powder. When i did the butter inside I added lemon slices instead of celery because i didnt have any and also placed a few on the outside. Chopped up some red potatoes and seasoned them well. Placed them around the chicken as it baked. Turned out great!

SIMPLY delicious! Like many other reviewers, I was a little wary of the recipe at first--it sounded too easy, but I couldn't ignore the high ranking so I gave it a try. I used butter, not margarine and added a little garlic powder.  IT WAS GREAT! I may try to cut the butter back a little, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe has me cooking roasted chicken on a regular basis.  It is a great basic that can been tweaked in numerous ways.  Last time I threw a bunch of veggies in the bottom of the pan and stirred them halfway through.  Delicious & easy!  (Oh, I definitely use the real butter-yum!)

I followed the directions exactly except for the time and temperature.  I roasted my chicken at 375 degrees F for 1 hour and 30 minutes, then removed and covered for 30 minutes.  I couldn't believe how tender and juicy the breast was...fantastic.  Even though I usually use my rotisserie for a whole chicken, I will make this recipe again.

This was an incredibly moist chicken!!  I did add butter under the skin as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I used a variety of spices (garlic salt, onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, coarse sea & himalayan salt, garlic & herb rub and ground pepper).  WONDERFUL flavor!  (Note: the recipe is for a 3 pound chicken, mine was nearly 7 pounds and took a little over 2 hours.)  One other thing, in a covered baker I cut up celery, carrots, red potatoes and yellow onions, topped with the same seasonings I used on the chicken, as well as added some fresh garlic.  Wonderful accompanyment!!  Thanks for a great recipe that will definitely be a staple in my monthly recipes!

Wow!  I just tried this one, thanks to all the positive reviews and they were right.  We just finished eating it and my husband can't stop raving about it - the moistest chicken ever, incredible, amazing, etc.  Sometimes the best things are the simplest. Note - I used garlic powder instead of onion powder.

I think this is a great recipe for a basic, moist chicken. You can always add some spices to your liking; but we enjoyed it just as is. Very juicy and moist. I prefer dark meat, but even the white meat of this chicken is good.

This was really tender and juicy and had a simple but good flavor. I cleaned the chicken well, covered in lemon pepper, salt, then onion powder, cut 3 stalks of celery and put in cavity along with 3 tbs. of butter, put remaining pads of butter under skin throughout. Roasted at 350 for 1.5 hrs and covered with foil for another 30 min. Came out great!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have celery so I stuffed with lemon slices and also used butter inside and out, and sprinkled with dried rosemary.  The recipe used the right amount of everything.  My chicken came out a little dry, but that is because I'm still testing my TRIVECTION oven.

This wasn't as great as I was expecting. Very buttery and it took longer to cook than the recipe recommended. I prefer the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style recipe from this site.

Wow, this is fabulous! How could something that sounds so simple be so good? I cook  chicken a lot, and my family was raving about this recipe. I also made gravy with the drippings, some flour, and broth and it made the best gravy I have ever made. Thank you for this recipe I will make this often!

We loved this recipe for roasted chicken.  I didn't change anything except using butter instead of margarine. We don't eat margarine, only smart balance.  Next time I will try that. The skin was crispy and nicely browned, discarded this, since neither my husband nor I ever eat it. The meat itself was extremely moist, white and dark.  One chicken, three adults, only one leg/thigh section left. Mine for lunch today! My steak loving husband had two helpings.  Very rare for him and chicken. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I have made many chicken recipes, but this one was the best!  It is hard to believe that with a few spices, butter (or margarine) and a stalk of celery, the chicken would turn out so juicy!  We devoured the whole thing!  I will definitely be making this again!

I used garlic powder because i didn't have onion powder. it was still delicious and so simple! i think it could use a little less butter next time but overall the flavor was very good. i used a 4.5 lb chicken and it took about 2 hours to cook.

FANTASTIC! I have, in all my years of cooking, never fixed a whole chicken - always used breast for everything. I was going to use the slow cooker recipe but thought I would give this a try instead - I AM GLAD I DID! This was so good, the meat was moist and the outside was nice and crispy. The only thing i will do next time is use less margarine, I think I added more then the recipe called for, because I really did not measure. I also used the Smart Balance Light and it was great.  I wanted to add that I ate some of the breast meat whenit was 'cold' about an hous later and the flavor was just popping out! thanks so much for sharing - I will make again and again!

This chicken was fabulous!!!  It was extremely juicy and flavorful...a BIG hit with the entire family.  I made a couple of additions:  I sprinkled the entire bird with as directed, but also added garlic powder to the mix.  Also, on the inside, I baked a few cloves of garlic and an onion (in addition to the called for celery).  My husband was impressed.  Said he didn't know I had that in me--not quite sure how to take that.  Lol.  Great recipe--keep an eye on time though.  Mine reached the recommended temperature of 180 degrees well before the called for baking time.

Although this recipe is probably sensational as is, I saw that a few raters found it a little bland, so in addition to the onion powder, I sprinkled it with my home made greek seasoning and it was awesome. I also cut the marjorine in half.  I used a 5 lb chicken, so I threw in an extra celery stalk and cooked for 2 hours & 15 minutes.  Thanks for a very easy and delicious recipe.

I am really good at poultry over all but had little experience with a whole bird except for a turkey. I looked this recipe up and my god it is FANTASTIC!!! The first time it was good the second time was even better. I took a splash of turkey broth in the bottom of the pan, patted the bird dry rubbed it down with Olive oil and a variety of spices -garlic,onion,paprika,adobo and such it is a great set it and forget it. Plus if you want to make sure it is cooked enough buy the pop up timers they are easy, cheap and I havent ever had a problem. Thanks for the great tips!

Good, but not great. Rather bland in the flavor department, albeit very juicy.  Made a hellacious mess in my oven, with the margarine splatter.  Will attempt again with less margarine, and way more spices.

I've never had a roasted chicken as Juicy as this from a store, restaurant, or home cooked! Changed it a little. Didn't have celery, so I put a 1/4 onion wedge in the cavity. Instead of just salt/pepper, I rubbed the whole bird with butter, then made a blend of garlic pepper, thyme, red pepper flakes, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, rubbing it over the entire bird. I also sprinkled garlic powder in cavity. I wrapped it twice in saran wrap and refrigerated for 2 hours before cooking. I put 1 cup water in pan with fresh cut potatoes and carrots, then the chicken. It's ridiculous how juicy, moist, tender, and flavorful this turned out! A+! Posting a photo too!

I just had this for dinner and it is sooo good.  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light.  I stuffed the cavity with crushed garlic cloves, celery, onion, and parsley.  I made gravy from the drippings and served it with green beans, corn, and home made stuffing.  I had a 4.2 lb roaster and it cooked quickly at 350F.  I have a gas oven, that may make a difference in cooking time.  Keep your meat thermometer on hand! I'll definitely use this again, enjoy!!

This turned out AWESOME, my husband, out of the blue, said he thought it was terrific and I should make it again!  I pretty much followed the recipe and advice of the original submitter, although I didn't have celery, so I put onion and garlic cloves in the cavity instead.  I rubbed with thyme, sage, salt and pepper inside and out.  Then I placed the margarine as directed.  I didn't baste until I took out of the oven.  Also, I cooked the chicken upside down (oops) and it came out fine.  It was a 5lb bird and I cooked for 2 hours (which might have been too long, but didn't affect the outcome).

Absolutely simple and absoluely delicious.  This was my first roasted chicken and EVERYONE loved it and was impressed.  I served this at Christmas and found that a 6lb chicken was perfect for 6 people with a little bit left over.  I also used garlic powder instead of onion powder because it was all I had.

Very good recipe!! The chicken is perfectly juicy and the flavor is amazing for the small amount of ingredients...I added some sliced onions under the skin of the chicken with the butter, but with out them it is good as well.

This is the juiciest roast chicken I have ever had.  I'm not good at making roast chicken, so I rarely do it.  I made this tonight b/c I needed extra meat for Tgiving leftovers and I had a chicken in the fridge.  This recipe is now going into my file!

My first Thanksgiving living abroad and this was a perfect substitute just for the 2 of us! Thank you! I put garlic and onion inside also, but next time will just follow the recipe to a T - didn't need it. Also used garlic powder b/c I haven't figured out what onion powder is here. Ugh. But it was perfect, moist, & flavorful... and SIMPLE!

I used this recipe to cook my very first whole chicken!  And it came out wonderfully!!  As previous reviews mentioned, I resisted the strong urge to change the recipe.  I followed it exactly.  The next time I might try roasted upside down in order to get the skin more crispy.  Otherwise, this is an excellent choice!

fabulous!!!!!!!!  I took the leftover chicken and cut it into small pieces.  Used the stock that was made while roasting, chicken, salt and pepper to taste.  Added cornstarch to some cream to thicken the broth and chicken.  Served it over mashed potatoes.  My son went bananas.  Im making it again today.

Wonderfully moist and delicious! I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of the broth I had at the end of the baking time, especially since it is baked uncovered.  Use lots of seasoning for the most flavor.  I served it with baked potatoes and baked apples, excellent combination! I usually just buy the deli chickens, if it hadn't been for a super sale on whole chickens last week, I would have never tried this recipe. It certainly is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This was sooo good, and so easy!  I did make a couple of changes, as per the suggestions in another review:
I sliced up six cloves of garlic, and two small lemons, and shoved that into the cavity along with the celery and butter.  I tucked a couple of the lemon slices and a few slices of the garlic under the breast skin.
My chicken was a little larger (5 pounds) and it took two hours to roast.
It was absolutely delicious, and juicy!
YUM!  Will definitely make again!

My 1st roast chicken and it was fantastic!! I am not a chicken fan but loved the taste of it - so juicy! I added sweet potato, carrots, onions and garlic cloves as the veggie and also stuffed the chicken with rosemary and garlic cloves. I also put in chicken stock and some white wine in the baking tray and reduced it after baking for gravy. It's delicious! My husband loves his roast dinner and he was amazed how moist the chicken was! Will surely make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! I squeezed a half a lemon on it and then put the lemon inside the cavity while it cooked. Otherwise I kept the recipe the same. Hubby thought the lemon was wonderful on it and wanted more lemon next time. I'll definitely be making this again. This is the first time I've ever touched a whole chicken and I was pretty proud at how it turned out. I used a 4.5 lb chicken (couldn't find anything smaller) and cooked for 1 hour and then flipped and did 45 minutes more and it was perfect!

AWESOME - incredibly easy, and incredibly good.  My bird was a little larger, and took 1 hr 45 min to cook, be sure to monitor with an internal thermometer.  Our 15 year old son said it's the best he's ever had - and he loves chicken - our 7 year old ate it up even though she's not a meat eater - and my husband said it was amazing.  Can't recommend highly enough.  Followed recipe exactly.

I bought a whole chicken because they were on sale-usually I end up naming them and they live in my freezer until I have to trash them. I tried this recipe because of the short list of ingredients and it was amazing!! If you want to make a simple meal into something special this is the one. I had to cook the chicken for 1 hr.and 50 min to hit the proper temperature (my bird was a little bigger.) If you use a meat thermometer,this wont be a problem.

WOW! This is a keeper....and yes, DO NOT judge how simple this may read. It is a PERFECT roast chicken recipe. I follwed this exactly as written and served it for a dinner party last night. That poor little chicken didn't stand a chance! Not a bone was left! I used a heavy hand of salt, pepper and onion powder. Probably a bit more than called for and my chicken took about 2 hrs to roast....even that long and it was the juiciest I've ever made. I basted it a few times during the cooking process. You MUST make this! Thanks for posting!

I added garlic powder and season salt to the outside, otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It was perfectly moist, the only drawback is that the seasoning wasn't fabulous.  This would be the perfect recipe - it only needs a good punch of seasonings!  Next time I will make a spice rub and let it marinate for several hours beforehand.

It truly was the juiciest roasted chicken that I've ever made.  I didn't have celery so, I used an onion inside the cavity instead.  Put the remainder of the butter under the skin of the breast and then put some olive oil and more seasonings on the skin.  It turned out wonderful.  Will always make my chicken this way from now on!

It was tender and juicy! So easy to make. I used to cut up onions and put around chicken and in the cavity. I can eliminate that step. It actually tastes better with onion power instead. Even my husband liked it!

I roasted a chicken for the first time over Thanksgiving using this recipe and it was a huge hit!  The chicken was juicy, moist, and flavourful.  My boyfriend said it was the best roast chicken he's had in a very, very long time, so thank you!

Chicken was very juicy, but seemed to lack flavor. Next time I'll try adding some spices and flavorings of my own design. :)

I made this chicken with butter instead of margarine, added half of an onion to the cavity and followed the recipe exactly as written for the most part. This was really good, moist chicken. I was not bowled over by the flavor, however it was good, just not "WOW THIS IS GOOD CHICKEN" good. It was incredibly juicy and I would make this again, but it was not, in our opinions, the most delicious chicken that we have ever eaten. Maybe next time I will make a pan gravy with the drippings, that may add a bit more flavor in the end.

Wow!  This is my first time roasting a chicken, and it tuned out perfect. It was so juicy and flavorful.  The only thing I did different was rubbing the outside of the bird with margarine.  Now that I can roast a perfect bird, I am going to try it with different seasonings and herbs.  Thanks for a great fool-proof recipe.

Tasty, moist chicken. I cooked it in a clay pot (450 degrees) for 30 minutes and then added carrots and red potatoes then cooked another 45 min. Didn't have onion powder so I cut an onion into wedges and put in the cavity. Heaven!

Another rave review!! Very simple and delicious. I stuffed garlic & onion inside with the celery. You must try this recipe with Broccoli in Roast Chicken Drippings, also from this site. It is the perfect partner.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is the best meal I've ever made. Your grandma is a cooking genius. Seriously. Made of Awesome. My 18 month old son DEVOURED it. 

I added spices to my taste, like Rosemary, Tony's, Italian Seasoning, etc. 
I also used "I can't believe it's not Butter" and it was awesome. I used an onion inside the bird as opposed to celery. I also stuffed it with garlic.

Anyone who gives this less than 5 stars did something wrong.

I didn't have a whole chicken, I had a split fryer but wanted to try this recipe anyway.  I just covered the bottom of the pan with sliced celery instead.  I followed all the other instructions.  The chicken had very good flavor and was moist.  I will most certainly use this recipe again, maybe even with a whole bird!

This chicken was sooo juicy that I thought I didn't cook it long enough. I didn't change a thing except I put the butter under the skin instead of on top of it. I also made pan gravy from the dripping and it was wonderful.

Very moist & easy.  This was my first Roast Chicken but it turned out great! I used an onion instead of celery because I didn't have celery on hand.  I also added some garlic powder. I used a 5 lb. chicken so it took 2 hrs but still turned out great.

This recipe is amazing! I do butter instead of margarine, and load on the onion powder. I have been making this now once a week for the past few weeks, and I have a feeling this will become a family tradition with my husband, daughter and I. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is the juiciest chicken I have ever cooked! I use this method everytime I roast a chicken, but I like to experiment by using different seasonings in the butter. I prefer to spread lots of my own seasoned butter mix underneath the skin. It makes the chicken so tasty! I also like to put sliced onion and carrots in the pan around the chicken. Before I came across this recipe, my chicken always turned out dry. But thanks to this recipe every chicken is even more delicious than the last and it is so unbelievably juicy!

This recipe is awesome! After reading the review from Jan. 24, 2008, I decided to stick to the original recipe, and I'm glad I did.  My husband declares it is THE best chicken he's ever eaten (and we've eaten a lot of chicken).  Stick with grandma's recipe!

This recipe had so many rave reviews, I had to try it per the recipe, with no changes. I had a 5 lb. chicken, so I had to cook mine for almost 2 hours, but besides that, I prepared the recipe as written. It was FABULOUS. After the first bite, my husband said, "Oooh, I might eat myself to death tonight!" Which, coming from him, is a big compliment. Haha! I added 3 cups of water to the drippings while cooking and made gravy with flour & water while the chicken was waiting to be carved. We could have drunk the stuff! To die for. I will never roast a chicken any other way. So simple, so easy, so delicious. Fall off the bone, yum. Thanks!!

I followed the recipe with a few changes by adding some herbs to the rub and some onion and carrots inside the chicken for added flavor, but overall a great tasting and easy dish.

Best roasted chicken I have ever made. I'm actually making it for the second time tonight. I did add some garlic powder to the mixture and also put some sliced lemon in the cavity with the celery. Awesome and super juicy!!!

I don't roast chicken often because my roasted chicken always turned out dry and flavorless.  I am SO glad that I found this recipe. I followed the recipe and only made a small change in adding garlic powder with the onion powder.  This chicken was so moist and yummy.  Even my 4 year old had two helpings and she is a picky eater.  This will be the ONLY roast chicken recipe that I will ever use.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a Very easy recipe to follow and I loved that it didn't have a huge list of ingredients. This was the first time I had baked a whole chicken and It was AWESOME! My husband and I loved it and I will be making this chicken weekly! Thanks for posting it!

This recipe was delicious. My kids and fiance loved it. The only thing I did differently was that I took out the onion powder, my son is allergic to onions. But it still came out great!!!

I have made this recipe twice now.  WOW!  I have never seen a chicken so juicy.  The only change I make is to put some garlic in the cavity.  This doesn't change the flavor of the chicken but if you make gravy from the pan drippings it gives the gravy a wonderful garlicky taste.

Wow!  I had a chicken I had to cook tonight, but needed an easy recipe with simple ingredients since I was so tired. I am so amazed at how delicious it is! And it was so easy! The extreme juiciness is an added bonus. Thank you so much for this recipe. A definite addition to the rotation!

I've made this twice, and plan on making it a lot more. The chicken turns out so moist! The first time I only used 1/4 cup of butter, the second time I used 1/2 cup.  We couldn't tell the difference, so I wont be using as much butter from now on.

I have completed my search for the juiciest chicken! The only change I made was to sprinkle on garlic powder in addition to the onion powder. My boyfriend said that this was the best chicken he has ever had. He even liked the celery that went inside! Thank you for the recipe! 4/23 This is now a weekly staple in our diet. I have tried different spices and it always turns out wonderfully. The buttered chicken is the key!

Because of the simplicity of this recipe, frankly my expectations were not high. How wrong i was! Somehow, this simple recipe turns out one of the best chicken dishes i've tasted! And it's great for the budget minded also! Thanks!

This chicken was excellent...moist and juicy!  I was tempted to stray from the original recipe but, reading other reviews, I decided to stick to it, with the exception of using butter instead of margarine.  While plating, my husband couldn't stop sneaking pieces!  My almost 5 year old had three helpings!  I knew then it was really, really good.

This made excellent, juicy and flavourful chicken.  I threw some garlic cloves into the bird and used 1/4 cup of butter instead of all that margarine.  Delicious!

This recipe is right on - very tender, juicy roasted chicken. I am NOT a cook but my family loved this and polished off every morsel of a 5lb chicken. I did make a couple substitutions - I use garlic and lime salt on the outside of the chicken and didn't have any celery on hand, so I cut up a carrot in its place. This was in the oven about 2 hours for our 5lb chicken. Served with coconut rice and mied veggies. Will make again!

I did not have any any onion powder, so I used garlic. Came out so juicy and lovely! I needed to cook it bit longer, but it made no difference: it was lovely - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Traditional. Healthful. Juicy and delicious. This was, bar none, the best roast chicken that my husband and I have tasted. The only changes I made were to substitute real butter for the margarine and garlic powder for the onion powder (we were out of onion powder). I'm saving this one to my recipe box!

I love this recipe ... anyone can do it. I changed the onion powder to garlic powder and omitted the celery (I didn't have any on hand). I put 3 garlic cloves in the chicken cavity and seasons the outside/inside of the chicken with Herbes De Provence.  I also quartered a few small yellow potatoes and drizzled them with some of the margarine, and seasoning them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and the Herbes De Provence.  Magnifique!!

This was absolutely THE BEST chicken I have ever tasted!!!! Its so simple as well. I had a 7lb bird, I ended up cooking it at 350 for 4 hrs. But, definitely worth the wait! Highly recommend this recipe.

This took me 2 hrs to cook, not 1 hr 15.  Does pulling it out of the oven and covering with foil keep it cooking?  I didn't know and didn't want to risk eating it red.  This was fine, but nothing special.

For this recipe, I also used different suggestions from previous reviewers.  I used butter and rubbed it all over the chicken and added 3 tsp in the cavity.  I filled the cavity with lemon slices, 5 cloves of garlic, slices of oignon, salt and pepper, garlic salt and some sprigs of rosemary. I then put garlic salt (had no powder, salt, pepper, a little bit of thyme and paprika on the outside of the chicken. I then squeezed a little bit of fresh lemon juice over it and cut up small pieces of garlic over it. I really enjoyed the chicken, it was tasty, but I had to cook it approx 45 minutes longer than what was called for. I rated it a 4 only due to the cooking time.
Very Yummy

This was an easy and delicious way to roast chicken.  The butter gives the chicken lots of moisture and flavor, and it also makes the skin nice and crunchy.  It took a little longer to cook it than the stated time, but that wasn't a big deal.  I made this as a base meat for the Mexican Mole Sauce on this website, but I will probably make it again to serve by itself.  Delicious!

I thought this was delicious and easy.  I made an herb butter with garlic powder, sage, salt and pepper and rubbed it all over the chicken, inside and out and under the skin on the breast.  I also added a half lemon to the cavity and basted every 20 minutes.  It was juicy and flavorful.  My 3-year-old daughter, who NEVER eats meat, loved it and had a huge serving!  This was a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious and very moist.  I also put celery salt on the chicken.

I was a little intimidated since I've never roasted a chicken before, but this recipe was super easy & tasted delicious! I was out of onion powder, so I substituted garlic powder - it turned out so great! I've never received so many compliments on any chicken dish before! I will continue to use this recipe for many years to come.

This was the best roasted chicken I have ever made.  And so easy!  I didn't have any celery in the house, but it still came out fabulous!!  It was so juicy!! I wish I would have made mashed potatoes to go along with it because with all of the juice at the bottom of the pan. I could have made a great gravy!!!  I will make this again and again.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!!!  I just LOVE it! I don't think I'll ever make my whole chicken any other way again. It was so juicy! My family & I are dark meat eaters but w/this recipe even the white meat is juicy. Enough that no one tries to just get the dark meat. Even the picky 11 yr old I have.  She'll eat the white meat off this chicken anytime.  I've tried making whole chicken many different times w/many different recipes but none have had the success of this recipe. Good til the last bite!!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!!!!! Yummy is all I can say. I added 1 and a 1/2 TSP of paprika and 1 tsp thyme to the seasoning. I also stuffed some onion chunks in with the celery. the aroma was amazing and I'll definately use this recipe again.

This was my first time roasting a chicken, and I could not be more pleased!  I did follow the advice of some reviewers and added a lemon and onion to the cavity of the bird; I also used garlic-pepper salt, which resulted in a flavorful, crispy skin. The meat itself wasn't salty enough, but it was so tender and juicy, it didn't matter.  Everyone can just salt to their own taste this way. This is also a very economical dish; I bought a 5-pound chicken for $4.00, and it fed four people (including two BIG men!), with some left over. An added bonus:  this makes the house smell better than any potpourri I've ever used!

Everyone liked it, but I think size of the chicken is off.  I bought a 4 lb chicken (a reg chicken, not an organic one)and it did not have a ton of meat.

This was the best roasted chicken ever!  I used garlic powder instead of onion salt and I sprinkled on a little thyme, too.  This gave it such a wonderful flavor!  It's even better when you run your finger under the skin and put some butter and seasonings underneath as well as on top of the skin.  It's even more flavorful this way.   The meat was so tender it was falling right off the bones.  The leftovers tasted wonderful, too!  I served with baked sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli and it was a tasty combination.  Can't wait to make this again!

This chicken is awesome!!  Extremely juicy--when I pull the leg off the cooked chicken you can see a pool of juice! Super easy if you have the time.  I use smart balance instead of butter which works well.  I have also had to increase the cooking time on occasion since it wasn't cook throughly.  I have also played with the seasonings, added a lemon to the middle with lemon pepper, and I have used garlic cloves.  I also baste mine during the cooking as well.  We love it!

I made this chicken with soy butter instead of regular butter and it STILL was tender, juicy, and delicious!  (This is often not the case with milk-free substitutions in recipes).  The only other change I made was putting a cut up onion inside the cavity with the celery (I didn't have onion powder).  For a side dish,  I also peeled a few potatoes and roasted them with the chicken, basting them a couple of times.  This is one of the best-tasting easy prep dishes I have found.  It will be one of my new standards!

Awesome!!!  I don't know about it being healthy with all the margarine, but it was juicy and tender.  I ended up using half a pack of Lipton Onion soup because we were out of onion powder and it turned out great.  Thank you and God bless.

This was the best roast chicken I have ever made. Instead of salt and pepper, I used some Weber seasoning and I carefully poked holes in the meat under the skin before cooking. I put some extra onion circling the chicken. They were delicious soaked in the gravy. Overall amazing!

This recipe is great! Super easy, delicious, I made no changes except I had a bigger chicken and extended cooking time 15 minutes, and I didn’t have any onion powder so I used minced dried onions, about a tablespoon is all. I like celery, and expected a celery taste, but it’s very very subtle. I really love the flavor, thanks!

I wondered also what the big deal was but this chicken is so delicious! I used more celery plus butter instead of margarine and it came out with such good flavor, was nice and juicy with crispy skin. I used to get rotisserie chickens but once I made this, I do not plan on getting any again.

Since I found out I was eating plastic, I haven’t bought Margarine in many years. I think it’s not much cheaper than butter too and the taste is so inferior to butter. After reading many reviews that said margarine was the key, I bought some to try. The chicken was moist and I liked the seasoning but all I could taste was the margarine. Probably because I’m not used to the taste. I will try again using butter. I do like the Roast Sticky Rotisserie Chicken better on this site. I will probably use that recipe more.

This was great! So juicy, crisp skin, and the flavors came through. I had a 4.5 lb chicken, cooked it at 375 for 1 1/2 hrs and let it rest for 20 min. Didn’t do anything else different.  I’ve been using Ina’s recipe, but this was better in my opinion. I roasted some carrots on another pan to go with it. Yum!

"The best chicken I've ever had!" - husband

I used Cajun seasoning instead of salt, pepper and onion powder, otherwise followed the directions exactly. Absolutely delish!

I had a 6 lb. chicken. I doubled the celery and cooked it  25 min. longer but those were the only changes. It was juicy, tender and flavorful. Excellent recipe!

I made this but found out after starting to prepare the chicken that I was out of celery. ugh main ingredient probably, so subbed quartered onion instead. I sprinkled a little celery seed in the roaster. It turned out great. Did have to cook it 1 1/2 hours at 350.

We used a fairly large chicken and the bottom of the chicken was tough to tear. The skin was nicely cooked though. Will try to cook longer next time.

I must say I had given up on roasting a whole bird. It just never seemed worth it. 
But I wanted to make several recipes that needed already cooked chicken and when I read these reviews, I thought why not. I know I could have gotten a store bought rotisserie chicken and that works for the leftover chicken but I’ve never particularly liked how the original tasted. This was amazing. The breast had a tender bite I’ve never had in poultry before. Really good and so simple

I am making this now and am so excited for it to finish roasting!! I used a few stalks of celery because I had to use it before it went bad and I also put a few carrots in there as well. I only have butter in my house....no margarine...lolol!!  I hope that works out ok. Other than that, I did everything else as outlined in the recipe.  I just love the fact that this is such a simple and basic recipe. I have found those work out to be some of the tastiest.  I can't wait for this wonderful dinner!!

This is the best recipe EVER!!! Of course I read some of the other reviews so I added the lemon and fresh chopped up garlic under the skin.  It was such a big hit!!! I’ll keep this recipe for ever.

Awesome recipe.  I have to admit I 'brined' my chicken for a couple of days before  cooking , but I'm not sure if that was necessary in this case.  Try it, folks, you'll love it.

My entire family loved how moist and flavorful this roasted chicken was and we paired it with a roasted chicken gravy (made from the remnants of the chicken and mashed potatoes. One of my best family meals ever according to the 8 and 13 year olds. I must confess I used extra butter (not margarine) since extra butter is never a bad thing.

Wow! I chose this recipe because I didn’t want to tie up a chicken and get all fancy. My local butcher only had 6lb chickens so it took 2 hours to cook and I rested for 30. This chicken is so juicy, delicious, and easy! The celery adds a little flavor that pairs well with the onion powder. This is not part of the monthly rotation.

great recipe. nice, simple and ive actually been doing it similarly for years. instead of dollops of butter in cavity and outside the bird, i soften the butter a bit in the microwave and then i mix a little garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika into the butter and i smear the butter underneath the skin on breast and legs and them whatever is left over i smear inside cavity before stuffing with celery and an onion. i do it under the skin to add more seasoning to the meat itself. and maybe a light sprinkle on top of skin as well with a little pepper.

Very juicy and tasty! I used Earth Balance instead of margarine, and a carrot in the cavity since I didn't have celery - the chicken turned out extremely juicy and flavorful. This was so simple, it will definitely be made again and again.

This recipe yields a great chicken.  My family loves it.  I knocked off a star because the time to cook is totally inaccurate.  If you go by the time listed, then your chicken will be raw still.  I use a meat thermometer and also wiggle the leg.  If the leg wiggles easily, it's done.  You will need a meat thermometer for sure to make sure your chicken is not raw.  I do use real butter because that is better than margarine.

Good chicken but it took 2 hours to cook.  Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and couldn’t even let it rest because the rest of my meal was ready.  Would add at least half an hour to the cook time.

This is such a simple recipe. Sometimes there's such perfection in simplicity. I used Lawry's seasoned salt and added some cayenne pepper for a kick. I also roasted it with stuffing inside. It came out just right. Wifey loved it, so it was indeed a success.

I've made a lot of roasted chickens in my day and I will say this has to be the best roasted chicken I've ever made.  It was so tasty.  I made a 5 lb chicken at 20 minutes a lb.

I was really impressed with this recipe.  Seriously moist and flavorful!  I used split chicken breasts.  I placed the celery on the bottom of the cooking dish, added the chicken, then topped and put in folds slices of butter.  AMAZING!! You won't be disappointed.

I made this last night exactly as the recipe says and it was excellent, juicy, tender and the skin nice and crispy.  I recommend this recipe to any beginners out there, it's so easy!

This indeed is a wonderful roast chicken recipe!  I used the ingredients exactly as written, but I did slice an onion to place the chicken on when roasting.  I slide the extra margarine under the skin, mostly over the breast.  I thought 1 Tbs of onion powder might be a bit much, but used it all, no problem.  My bird was a bit bigger, so took longer - an extra 30 or so minutes.  So I would be sure to use a thermometer to check for the correct internal temp.  The bird was gorgeous when I took it out, golden brown - then when I basted it  as directed,my mouth was watering, I had a hard time waiting the 30 minutes for the rest period!  Used the drippings with 1 cup low sodium and 3 Tbs. flour to make a gravy - this may be the best chicken gravy I have ever made.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans - a simple and very comforting meal.  The crispy brown skin was to die for.  The breast was very tender and juicy.  An excellent recipe, I'm making a small turkey for Christmas and will use the onion powder and margarine for that and we'll see if it as good!

Followed the recipe.  It was so juicy and tender.  White meat can be dry but this certainly was not.  Very easy to make and was enjoyed by all!  I’ll do this one again for sure!!

Could it be better with margerine? I dont know, we only use real butter here but I’d say there shouldnt be much difference. Turned out really good. Simple ingredients, easy directions. Just the kind of recipe I like. Not overcomplicated with 50 ingredients of which 30 of them most people dont have on hand. Try this recipe as written if you want to give an honest review, then make your changes

Very classic chicken recipe, a la Julia Child,  if you add a halved lemon and onion slices in the cavity and use butter...please.  Also unnecessary to add butter to the cavity.  Use 1/4 cup butter, softened,  and rub on skin.

There is nothing to change in this recipe. It says use celery I use celery. came out great and very tasty..I guess  a few people missed that ingredient that is a given in all recipes ..."Season to Taste" how can it come out bland when you do that.  It means salt and pepper. If you have to measure it you are bound to fail

Thank you for this recipe. Why people insist on reviewing a recipe while explaining how they completely changed it to something completely different is beyond me... Try this as written (margarine or butter) and you’ll have a meal that will please anyone who still believes in eating meat.  It’s great.  It’s delicious.  Great job and thanks again for providing such a useful and completely tasty recipe.

This was so easy and perfect. You can do anything with this chicken! I baked one for chicken and dumplings and to use the carcass to make stock. It was hard to keep the husband from picking at it!

Cook time is not accurate. Followed the recipe to a t and went to carve it for a family dinner to find it raw on the inside. Currently waiting on it to cook further at a temp of 375. 

Hoping the taste comes through!

We decided to downsize to chicken this Thanksgiving since our family is so small. Based on reviews I decided to give this a try.  It was so simple and easy to make and the results far exceeded my expectations.  It truly was the juiciest chicken I have ever had. I always try a new recipe as written and tweak it after to suit our tastes.  There is no need to here, it's perfect as is.  The only thing I did a little different was adjust the cooking time as my chicken wad 6 pounds. Who knew celery could make such a big difference? Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe.

First, to all the naysayers, I say this: if you don't like margarine, use another oil. We used olive oil and ghee and grass fed butter on various occasions - turns out amazing. Second, cook it longer if it's raw; don't throw it out! Check the internal temp and cook until 165-180, not hard. We usually cook it about 1 hour 45-2 and that works. 

This is by far the juiciest and best whole chicken I've had - largely due to the celery inside. 

Also, another tip - if  you don't have celery, use rainbow chard inside and out. Add other veggies like potatoes and onion and carrots to the outside - fantastic.

This is what I get for asking my 9 year old what he wants for dinner! “I want a turkey dinner mom!” He settled with chicken because I wasn’t going to try and defrost a turkey at 4:30 pm, I needed something quicker, and he settled with chicken and stuffing .  So, I did change a couple things, I ended up using stuffing and not celery, no margarine, and no onion powder. I put chicken stock for it to cook in and added the potatoes (it was heaven), seasoned it with garlic and herb seasoning (McCormick grill mates) inside and out, put slices of butter in the cavity, on top, and around the potatoes, threw some fresh rosemary to make the juices more fragrant (and I knew the potatoes would absorb the flavor as well) and threw a sprig on top! My chicken was 6 pounds, so I knew that it had to cook longer... when the juices ran clear I took it out and let it sit for about 20 minutes and sautéed some green beans while I waited... this has never happened to me, I ate so much that I made myself almost sick, THEN I KEPT EATING!!! I simply couldn’t stop, it was so good! Next time I will start earlier and leave it in for a bit longer, but other than that, I was so impressed with myself I almost cried (I have low confidence with cooking lol). I will be making this again! And with all the leftovers I’m going to make a soup for tonight! thank you!!

It's truly the juiciest, myself being from india in my second attempt I tried a fusion with some Indian spices and it was superb.
Along with onion powder i added a pinch of ginger and garlic powder some red chilli powder and very little garam masala.

Don't change a thing on this recipe.  It works perfectly as-is.  Just take 5 minutes and make dinner.  Use the remainder of your time to put your feet up and have a drink instead of trying to find ways to personalizing this recipe.

I don’t like writing reviews and am not a fan of roast chicken. I had 2 chickens I needed to cook and not a lot of time for prepping. This looked easy enough and I could always use it to make chicken salad.  As I was carving it up my daughter and I kept picking at the chicken until we literally ate half of it.  I didn’t alter the recipe a bit and it was full of flavor and very juicy.

This was SO easy and SO delicious!  Cannot recommend this recipe highly enough!

The only changes we made were to use White Truffle Butter instead of Margarine. 

The reviews are all correct - you will read the recipe and think it's too good to be true... but it really is! THAT good  As a bonus, our entire house smelled absolutely amazing while it was roasting!

Just like everyone else said....hard to believe that such an easy to prepare dish is so delicious! Don’t need to change a thing! I think the key is LIBERAL use of the salt and pepper. I did use butter because I never have margarine and it still turned out perfect. Because my chicken was 4.5 lbs instead of 3 lbs I adjusted the cooking time to about 25 minutes per pound and kept the same resting time.

I was looking for a simple recipe for a whole chicken, and when I found this one, I was kinda skeptical about the celery, but wow, did it turn out AhMaZing! The chicken was moist, flavorful, and juicy. It was so good, in fact, that I'm making it again tonight!

This really was the best roast chicken I've ever made. The only things I changed were: 1) butter not margarine, added onion with the celery in cavity, used Mrs. Dash herb blend (instead of individual seasonings), and added 1.5 c water to pan before putting it in oven -- it gave just enough juice for a yummy gravy afterwards. Even the vegetarian among us enjoyed this meat!

I made this tonight. It might be the only juicy chicken I’ve ever cooked. Followed recipe just as described but used butter because that’s what I had. Also I used an oven stuffer (big Purdue chicken)  for the same reason. Great recipe!  I will probably always make chicken this way now. Thank you for sharing it.

My go to chicken roast recipe! My family loves it and always complements me on it. The celery helps keep the chicken juicy. The chicken usually has to stay in my oven for at least 2 and a half hours before it’s done but it’s definitely worth it!

The best cooking is many times with the most simple ingredients.  I am making this again. I have made this three times in the past month and a half.  It's simple, juicy and tasty. Great for a family meal.

I didn’t finish reviewing and accidentally hit done on my phone. Docking off another star for Allrecipes’ app for not letting me review and edit before publishing! Anyway, I finally took out the chopped onions after the 1.25 hr cooking time was up and ended up changing to convection at 375 for the rest of the cooking time I needed. By the time this bird was fit for human consumption my husband and I were too hungry to bother basting and waiting the exorbitant 30 min of rest. Waiting 15 minutes was just fine while we finished up cooking the rest of our dinner. Yes this makes a juicy chicken but the recipe is flawed. And as at least one another reviewer mentioned, you need this to be cooked to 165 degrees F for poultry. No need to be 180 degrees.

Simply AMAZING.  Only thing I 'change' is,  I mince 3-4 cloves garlic, mix it with melted butter and apply between the skin and meat (the amount of butter per recipe).  My favorite roasted chicken from now on!

Most amazing recipe. So stupidly simple, not sure why it turns out so good. Is it the butter? Is it some secret chemical compound in the celery? So tasty and so juicy and even better reheated the next day. Definitely make it again I will.

I seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt, ole bay, pepper, and onion and garlic powder. The only reason I tried this recipe was because I wanted to try something different with stuffing it. Butter, did nothing. Celery, did nothing. I baked it at 350° for an hour and a half and it wasn't pink but I also couldn't find my meat therm.

I finally got a moist flavorful juicy bird! I always dry them out! I only changed 2 things. I didn't have celery or margarine! So I used BBQ sauce. Following your temp and time and the foil at the end - made the difference in what I'd done before! Yay!

Simple roasted chicken recipe that makes really good chicken. I use butter instead of margarine, and I put some under the chicken's skin on the side that is facing up when it is in the pan. I add chopped onion with the celery in the cavity, and sprinkle a little garlic powder on the outside, too.

We all loved this.  I've made this twice and noticed that the more salt you use, the better it tastes (like deli rotis chicken).  The celery was a little chewy for my taste though.  I made this with a 5# bird as I couldn't find a smaller one at my local store. You just calculate it as 25 min per pound and it was done after 2.25 hours of cooking.  I think it's better to have a larger chicken anyway as it feeds more people and is more worth my time preparing and waiting for!

This chicken recipe is so juicy.  What I changed,  was because   I  thought I had all ingredients but I didn't.  I didn't  put anything in the cavity, no celery.  On top of chicken I added honey,  hot peppers flakes, salt and pepper. I added potatoes, and onions next to the chicken. I was very happy with the results.

This is outstanding. I used butter but I don’t think it matters. I am at a loss to know how this turns out so well wit so few ingredients. I’m thinking it’s the celery??!! I wouldn’t change a thing.

You can not go wrong with this recipe! The celery is the trick. My mother had never  added celery to her  chicken and was blown away at how moist and delicious this is. Great Recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for roasting a whole chicken. It was moist, tender, and tasty.  I used salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika for the seasonings. Prior to seasoning, I lightly sprayed the chicken with EVOO. Due to health issues, we use butter in lieu of margarine. I followed the instructions closely and was happy with the results. This recipe has been placed in my recipe file already. Thumbs up!!

This was the best roasted chicken recipe that I have ever made! I did use an oven bag, which made cleanup a breeze. Perfect Sunday dinner for company. I made easy shredded chicken tacos for a busy Monday dinner, from the leftovers.

Moist and delicious, but strangely most reviews leave out that the flavor and juiciness comes from all that margarine. Cut back on the margarine and I doubt it gets such rave reviews. I cooked a 4 lb chicken for 1hr 25 minutes at 350F and it came out great. Not sure I'll make it again anytime soon because my cardiologist would get upset.

This was absolutely the PERFECT chicken recipe. I made it exactly, so I could give an honest review. 
The only thing is, I prefer a crispier skin, so perhaps I will broil for a short time? 
This recipe is one that can easily be tweaked according to spices to the chef's tastes, but for certain, the celery is the secret. 
Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will use again and again!

Excellent recipe!! Followed recipe and it turned out amazing, juicy and flavourful.  Mine did take longer to reach the correct internal temperature than the cooking length given in the recipe. I used a round black enamel roasting pan with high sides, don’t know if that was the reason. Will definitely make this again.

Made this tonight and it was a definite hit. I admit I made some changes, didn’t have celery so I subbed onions. Had to double the time bc it was 6lbs- no biggie. Either way it was really juicy and delicious. Husband and kids loved it.

Found this while searching for cook times only.  While here, I read the reviews and decided many users need a cook time conversion.  Recipe calls for 3 pound chicken for 1h 15min at 350.  That is 75 min. divided by three, or 25 minutes per pound.  If you use a 4.5 pound chicken as another reviewer did, you will need to cook it for 25 X 4.5 = 112.5 min. or 1 hour and 52.5 minutes.

The three stars are for accurate cooking time.  The recipe itself is very basic.

This is a great, basic roast chicken! Came out perfectly as written, though next time I will add a bit more salt (my fault, I tend to underseason when making a recipe for the first time.) I especially like that it uses ingredients  generally have on hand.

I followed the directions as written, this was by far the juiciest chicken I have ever made in the oven with so little ingredients.I did have to cook it longer, that may have been due to elevation and a gas stove.
Made a wonderful gravy too!

Absolutely wonderful!  My chicken was a 5lb. chicken. I generously seasoned as per the recipe with salt, pepper, onion powder and butter, added a few celery stalks, set my oven on convection bake at 350 for 1 hour and 45 minutes. The bird was perfect!  Juicy and tasty!  Who would have thought that such a simple recipe would make a perfect chicken?

Succulent, juicy and great natural taste!  It turned out so tender. Followed directions exactly. Let it rest also following the suggestion to tent it. A new way for roasting chicken which we’ll do in the future.

Did not deviate from recipe, except butter (I don’t use margarine). It was AMAZING!! Slightly crispy on outside (skin) and extremely moist & tender meat. Seriously like magic!! Telling all my friends & family

I had a chicken that was about 5 pounds so did need to increase the cooking double. Used butter and someone's suggestion to lift the skin and place between the bird and the skin. I guess for the bother the store-bought chickens I have had were much more moist. I did have enough chicken for several meals doing it on my own though.

Followed this recipe exactly, and the chicken turned out beautifully moist and so tasty!  We had a larger hen, 5-1/3 lbs., so I increased some of the ingredients. Still, a delicious Easter dinner.

I added 3 lemon wedges inside with 2 tablespoons of butter and a dash of thyme.  And on the outside of the bird I added minced garlic and rubbed it in.  Everyone loved it. I also added 1/2 c chicken broth over the veggies the last 30mins of cooking. It was so tender and delicious. No left overs!

Great recipe thank you! We did use butter instead of margarine and increased cooking time due to using Costco whole chicken (usually about 4.5lb).  Love it!

Very simple but great recipe. I believe the trick is following the baking time, no covering, basting, and letting it rest. It garners a ridiculously juicy bird. I did however deduct one star b/c I felt the seasoning was lacking. After the initial try I usually add an all-purpose seasoning such as Adobo complete, Slap Ya Mama or Tony's whatever I have on hand. Play around with your fave seasonings but def follow the baking instructions.

Super easy, very tasty and a perfect golden brown! I forgot to buy the celery so I stuck some extra scallions in the cavity instead and it was wonderful. I'll definitely make this again (& try the celery)! I did have to cook it about 15 min more than the 1:15.

This recipe is delicious. Due to time issues I used a crockpot instead of the oven. It worked wonderfully. It was juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender. I will definitely be using this often.

Not sure of all the fuss is about, after all it will still taste like chicken no matter how you cook it.
Where can you find a 3 lb chicken nowadays?
My chicken was 5 lbs.  It took about twice as long to roast to 180 degrees F.

Wonderfully easy and tasty way to roast a chicken!  I followed the recipe as stated, but lacking onion powder, I substituted sliced onion, added to the celery in the cavity of the bird.  And like many other reviewers, I used butter instead of margarine, decreasing the amount by about 1/4. It was still exceptionally rich - true “finger-lickin’ good” chicken!  I will definitely make it again, but may use even less butter.  Since my chicken was almost 7 lbs., it took much longer to reach doneness, but was well worth the wait.  I roasted some carrots, potatoes, onions, celery and mushrooms in the same pan, and they were awesome, as was the gravy I made from the drippings.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I had "gone off" supermarket chicken, but then I found an organic brand called FreeBird - no hormones, antibiotics, yada-yada. I wanted to try a simple roast to see what the chicken itself tasted like, and this recipe fit the bill because it didn't have a complicated sauce or too many aromatics.

WOWIE-ZOWIE is this a delicious recipe! I made it as written, except for butter because I never use margarine. If anyone has tried both, I'd love to know because if margarine is essential it would be worth it to me.

The flavor totally popped, and the meat was juicy and picked up the onion salt and celery without being overwhelming.
This is now my go-to recipe. (The chicken passed the test, too.)

I had a 5.5lb chicken and cooked it at 425 for 1hr 30 minutes which was perfect. It was incredibly juicy and flavorful and cooked through. I didn’t have a roasting pan (since I’ve never roasted a bird I’ve never thought to buy one) so I just used my Dutch oven with balled up tin foil at the bottom to lift the chicken up so it would roast instead of steam. 
I also didn’t have margarine and don’t buy it because I think it’s gross so I just used butter instead. I also stuffed a squeezed lemon rind into the cavity along with the celery and used Maldens sea salt instead of regular salt. The only other change I made was adding fresh chopped veggies 35 minutes before the chicken was done which wasn’t enough time-they were undercooked a bit. It turned out great, I’ve never had such juicy, flavorful white meat and it was just really delicious and flavorful! My husband loves having such a nice dinner on a week night. It made dinner for the 2 of it, 2 large Tupperware containers of leftovers with veggies and I still had a large breast and some other white meat left over for chicken salad or something. I also forgot to mention that I made gravy with the pan drippings which was very quick and made it that much better. The chickens were buy one get one free and I’ll definitely be repeating this recipe with the 2nd chicken!

This worked out wonderfully! I made two chickens at the same time and didn't regret it!
Made the following alterations to the recipe:
Instead of salt and pepper, used the home-made rub that I have for grilling.
Filled cavity with chopped onions and mushrooms.

Also, tossed the giblets, etc., into the baking pans and used them and the two chicken carcasses to make delicious stock.

Ok ,

I don’t write reviews.  I literally signed up just so I could comment on this recipe. It’s ABSOLUTELY FANTASIC ! The title is simply accurate . I like others, combined the garlic , lemon and butter from the “moist garlic chicken “ recipe and the combination with with simple seasonings are perfect! Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly except my chicken was 4.5 lbs so I cooked it for 2 hours. The result was a flavorful chicken but I really did not think it was anything special. The breast was difficult to slice & it just kind of shredded. That was disappointing. Usually I roast my chickens upside down for 1/2 of the cooking time which results in a moist, slicable breast (I didnt do that here since this recipe didn't call for it).

It's a tasty recipe and even the leftovers are moist.  I chopped up fresh onion to put inside instead of onion powder.  I also used avocado oil instead of butter for a healthier fat.  It was wonderful!

Simple, quick, moist.  I made it as stated, but with butter.  I just don't buy margarine. I was surprised the skin wasn't crisper, but maybe that's the butter.  4.5lb chicken took 1 hour 45 min in my 350 oven.  I like to taste the flavor of the meat as well as the seasonings, so I didn't think the flavor was too plain at all.  Will definitely make again.

This is a really good, easy recipe for roast chicken. My family loved it and it was quick and easy for me. They all came back for seconds and raced about the skin. I didn’t make any changes outside of using butter instead of margarine; simply because I don’t use margarine. It was good as is! Thanks for sharing!

I agree with so many other reviewers, I just couldn't believe the small ingredient list would allow for a moist chicken.  It was wonderful.  I didn't change one thing about it and plan on making it again and again.  It had the moistness of a rotisserie chicken from the store.  My one critique was the time.  It took my chicken 2 1/2 hours to reach 180 degrees.  So we didn't end up eating until 8 instead of 6.  But moving forward I will just adjust my prep time.   Don't hesitate try this recipe!

Made this exactly as directed. Chicken came out PERFECTLY! 

General rule of thumb it's about 20 minutes per pound at 350°.

Chicken was absolutely delicious and moist.  My family ate the whole thing!

OMG
tied legs together, buttered the whole chicken.
JUST WOW
I tried baking breast down some have told me it makes the breast juicy..well yeah it was juicy but really not that different but what REALLY sucked was the skin was soggy and wet and flappy not nice browned and crispy, so never again.
*****cook longer, use thermostat never comes out done *****

Didn't change a thing.  Simple and delicious,  basic ingredients most everyone has on hand. Could easily be altered but then it would no longer be the recipe submitted.  Five stars for the recipe it is, not what I could modify it to be.  Thanks,  will definitely be making it again.

I have made this at least a dozen times, so I figured I owe praise to the recipe's creator.  This is the ONLY way I will ever roast chicken.  It turns out awesome every time, for real. The chicken turns out tender, juicy, and downright scrumptious.  I roast two at a time, in separate pans, and the turn the ample drippings into gravy (combining corn starch with 1/4 cup milk & adding this to the drippings/bringing to a boil).  I serve it with mashed potatoes and petite peas.   (Cook time on the two chickens is about 30 minutes longer than on one.)  Thank you for this amazing recipe!  I'm so very grateful!  Yum!

This was a great recipe.  I made it just like the recipe called for, except I used a poultry seasoning on the out side.  The white meat was so tender and flavorful!  I am making my roasted chicken like this every time.

Pay attention to your chicken's size!! I made this for my family and it was fantastic. The breast  wasn't even dry! Super moist. Follow the recipe basics. You should salt and pepper the chicken inside and out but you'll need more/less depending on the size/weight of your chicken. Same goes for the onion powder. I used a 5.3lb chicken so I had to use more seasoning than the recipe called for and baked for two hours, then pull out, cover and sit 30 minutes for the resting time. Still used one stalk of celery, but used more butter. Stick butter is great because you can cut cubes and throw it in the cavity and place them in the pan around the chicken. As far as prep before the oven, I put my chicken in a basic brine (salt water, 1/2 c. Kosher to 2qt water) for an hour in the fridge, rinsed off in cold water, patted dry with paper towels, let air dry in the fridge for another hour, then I splayed my chicken (to bake evenly, cut the skin along the thigh on each side where the legs connect to the body but don't sever, splaying the legs open so they lie flat on the pan), then seasoned everything. Don't forget your bake time will vary depending on chicken size! Approximately 20 minutes per pound or until breast temperature reads 180 degrees!

The flavor was great but this roasting temperature and time is totally incorrect. I wish I would have read the 1-2 star reviews or even any other roasted chicken recipe before starting this dish. Having never roasted a chicken I followed the recipe exactly as written and ended up serving dinner an hour later because my bird was not cooked after 2 hours on 350. Please fix this recipe, it deserves 5 stars for the flavor but the cook time is misleading.

I'll add another one of the "it was kind of weird how good this was" reviews.  I made minimal changes.  I did brine my chicken with a mixture of cold water, salt and lime juice for about 1 1/2 hours while I was getting the side dishes ready.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly except to use butter (we don't own margarine) and add some garlic powder.    Please note the recipe says, "SEASON LIBERALLY".  Do not be light handed with your seasonings.  My bird was almost 4 lbs so I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours and then let it rest for the full 30 minutes.  It was perfect and extremely juicy and tasty.  My step daughter asked me how I made the chicken so good.  She also asked me to please not ever let her dad cook again.  (For some reason he was not nearly as amused as I was.)  I made her a plate and before I had finished fixing mine she was asking for more chicken.  She just went to bed to "sleep some of this food off".  It was really really good.

Simple. Easy. A little messy trying to wrangle a wet chicken into a baking pan, rubbing margarine inside (and I am a real butter lover, but used Country Crock for this recipe) Salt, pepper... Shoved celery up in the nether region. 

My bird was a little over 6 pounds ( and wrapper said to roast 20 minutes per pound - about 2 hours+). Fortunately I checked mine after 1 hour, as I turned baking dish around. ( popped meat temp probe in and it was around 450 at that point).  There was no way that I could let it roast a whole other hour!  

I gave it 30 more minutes, and it was a little closer to 170, not ideal - but better than a raw chicken inside. 

Pulled it out of the oven, slapped some foil loosely on  top and allowed it to rest. 

Damned thing was cooked perfectly. Seasoned juices down below in baking dish screaming to be turned into  gravy. 

The amazing thing is, it tasted just like CHICKEN!!! 
Not bland, or boring - just pure, silky, juicy, tender chicken.

Made this exactly as written. Flavorless. Ate it for 1 night, using the leftovers in other stuff that will give it flavor. The carcass and veggies made a great stock though!

I have a go to chicken recipe from the Barefoot Contessa requiring you to stuff the cavity with lemons. I didn't have any, so I tried this recipe. I won't use this one again.

so glad that i read the reviewer who said to trust this very basic recipe.  It was the best roast chicken i ever made!!!

I used onion salt instead of plain salt and therefore didn't use the onion powder.   also used butter -- i think butter is better for you than margarine.  unbelievably good.  i will make this again and again.

Practically perfect!  And so EASY!  I roasted two chickens at once in a 12-inch iron skillet.  It took a bit longer, of course, than the recipe says because there were two chickens.  Next time I'm going to try using coconut oil instead of butter.

This made the best roast chicken I have ever had.  The chicken came out moist and delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed.  My husband does not care for chicken much.  However, he had two servings at dinner time and kept picking at it after I refrigerated it after dinner.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  It will be my go to recipe for roast chicken.

Amazing!  I did throw my bird in a quick brine for about 6 hours, patted it dry before seasoning.  I added some ‘rotisserie chicken rub’ along with the salt and pepper.  Filled the cavity with lemon slices, butter, celery and green onion stalks. I think the trick is to only cook it to 165 and let it rest for 20-30 min. before carving. So tender and juicy!  My teenagers loved it so I’ll consider making 2 next time. I also made chicken noodle soup with the leftovers by slow slow simmering the carcass (I had to skim off a layer of butter after it sat in the fridge overnight, but so flavorful!)

I've made this several times now. The only changes I make are to use ground celery seed and to most of the butter under the skin and the remaining butter into the cavity.

I pulled the chicken when the thickest part of the breast was 165, instead of the 180 it calls for.  The chicken was done just fine and basting with the juices and letting it rest is definitely helpful in keeping the meat moist.  For it's simplicity, this is a good recipe.

Nice easy recipe for a super juicy chicken! One thing to note, not all chickens are 3 lbs. Guidance is to cook for 20 minutes per pound, so I cooked my 6 lb chicken for 120 minutes = 2 hours. Use a meat thermometer to make sure it reaches 180 degrees as well.

This recipe produced a tasty and juicy chicken. Only thing I did different was to use unsalted butter.

Made exactly as recipe reads. For every pound of chicken you should cook for 20-25 minutes per pound at 350. Internal temp should be 165 - 180F. Next time I'll use a little Rosemary and garlic in cavity.

Delicious and easy! I had a 5-pound chicken, so I cooked it at 375 for the suggested time, but I followed everything else as written.  I'll definitely make it again. It was good as is, and the leftovers will be great for casseroles, soups, salad, etc.

I used a 6 lb chicken and doubled the ingredients. I baked it for about 2 hrs and 45 minutes and did not add any additional ingredients. Very easy to prepare and came out delicious and so juicy! Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is suspiciously simple, so I assumed it would turn out like garbage. Bang-howdy, I was wrong! I'm not sure if it was the butter or the 30 minutes of resting time, but this was the juiciest, tastiest chicken I've made in years. For seasoning atop the chicken, I used parsley, rosemary, thyme (vital!), black pepper and a touch of seasoned salt.  Highly recommend this recipe as-is.

All the accolades were right-on.  It was fantastic - enjoyed by all.  The only change was some added diced onions.  Will I make it again? - absolutely!!!

Was out of celery but used fresh fennel instead,  plus some fresh rosemary. 5# chicken cooked about 2 hrs to get to temp. Amazingly tender & no leftovers!

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. I didn’t have any onion powder so this is what I did. I put the 3 tablespoons of butter in the cavity and I also added three small spoonfuls of Minced up garlic in a jar in the cavity and I sprinkled it with salt and garlic salt and then I melted a stick of butter and poured it all over the chicken and baked it for The hour and 15 minutes. It really came out so juicy

I like this method of roasting chicken, because the leftovers don't have an overpowering influence of spices.  I can use the meat to make chicken noodle soup, or similar recipes.

The first time I made it I followed all directions except I didn't have onion powder, so I substituted finely diced onion in the cavity. It was so delicious I'm making it again. The white meat was very juicy. One other change I made was to rub a little of the salt and butter (not margarine) directly onto the flesh. I did this by cutting the membrane that attaches the skin to the breast meat and separating it with my hands (the first slit is made at the bottom cavity, not at the neck). It's an old habit I got into and did it without thinking both times.

Where does one find a three pound chicken these days?
Would this recipe work on half a six pound chicken, the standard weight I see in the market these days? Otherwise I’m “game” for this recipe.

Followed the recipe, but did a 3 lb. larger chicken. I added on 15-20 min. per lb., but always use a meat thermometer. This was amazingly moist & delicious! If you like roasted chicken, I’d recommend this recipe!!! :)

I had a 4lb. chicken and added another 1/2 hour @ 375 but I still think I'd like it cooked a little more.  It registered 180 so it was done but I like my chicken to fall off the bone.  Butter was a wonderful idea.  I used a cup of chicken broth and 1 1/2 Tbsp. of cornstarch to make gravy.  There was really only the butter drippings but the gravy was delish. I will make this again.

Wow! It really is juicy!! This chicken was the best I’ve ever coked! I often pick up a rotisserie chicken from the store, but I’ll be cooking my own more now. It’s much cheaper. My son loved it too, and went back for more! He’s 17, but not a big eater usually. The only thing I changed, was using garlic powder instead of onion powder, because that’s what I had. I even made delicious gravy, and didn’t need to season it all. I did have to cook the bird longer than 1 1/2 hours, but ovens vary. Yum!!

easy basic recipe.  I broke down bird before eating any, and discarded skin (although it came out crispy.  I put three tablespoons of butter in the cavity (not margarine) and drizzled avocado oil outside instead of margarine pats.

This turned out great. Roasted a whole smoked chicken over a pan of carrots, turnips, onions, celery and potatoes. Put the celery and butter in the chicken and more butter on the outside. Roasted until the internal temp was 160F. This will most definately be a repeater.

Wasn't done after allotted time. I think the oven temp needs to be higher.  Put back in oven for another 30 minutes and was done.

I made this for Thanksgiving using a 6.4 pound bird.  Cooked at 325 for 3.5 hours.  At the 1.5 hour mark I turned the bird over on its back.  The bird turned out nicely browned and very tender.  Would do a chicken this way again in the future.

I’ve made this twice now. Once for a regular dinner using the exact recipe and then another time (with two birds) with some tweaks for Thanksgiving. As is this chicken is super juicy. You can’t mess it up. Even if you over cook it, it is still juicy. Very nice flavor for a good and simple roast chicken that would be good for anyone, including a novice.

I did everything it said,minus adjustment of cooking time (I had a 4.5 pound chicken) and I used butter. It was so tender and juicy. I’m making it again for Sunday lunch. Best tip I can give is invest in a thermometer, and always use it for cooking whole chickens and turkeys.

I put the chicken on a bed of thick chunks of onion, celery and carrot  because I didn't have a roasting pan...no onion powder but used a favorite all-purpose spice mix. Cooked about an hour longer than specified....came out nice and juicy....but I suppose anything basted in butter and chicken drippings will.

The only change I made to this recipe was in the use of unsalted butter instead of margarine. I am glad I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not add a ton of spices to dress the recipe up. The recipe is lovely as written. The chicken browned beautifully, the meat was moist, tender, and perfectly cooked. Less is more. Thank you, Grandma!

This was excellent! Tasted great. The salt, pepper, onion powder, margarine and celery is really all you need! It was light and flavorful. 

Only thing is that my bird didn't cook all the way so I added a bit more time. Could be my oven. 

Also, it was JUICY!!!

I have made this as written and with modifications. I prefer it as written because the bird takes longer to cook the more I put in the cavity. Also, you need to cut between the leg and the breast for the juices to run clear to know if it is done. I make a chicken stock out of the carcass and immediately make a chicken soup. Thank you so much for the the recipe.

Amazing result! I followed exactly as written and I don't know why it works but it does! Super juicy and if anyone is wondering... it doesn't taste like celery at all. My chicken was nearly 5 lbs and took 1hr 40 min to cook.  This is my new method to roast a whole chicken...I wonder how it would work with a turkey??

I used garlic powder instead of onion. I flipped the chicken and covered it with foil at the 1 hour 15 mins mark and continued to roast it in the oven for another half hour. It turned out great...the meat was falling off the bone.  I diluted the sauce and made mushroom gravy as a dip. Awesome basic recipe that really works.  Thank you. God bless. 

Salute...

My reaction after reading the minimal ingredients was to move on to another recipe.  After reading the rave reviews, I decided to give it a try, just to quench my curiosity.  WOW!  This had to be the most tender, juiciest chicken I've ever made.  My husband, who is not a huge poultry fan could not stop commenting on how good it was.  Sometimes we get so involved with using a ton of herbs and spices we forget how amazing the simple things are.

This is so simple and foolproof!  I followed it to a tee and it turned out great.  I did make one small revision though by substituting everything and grilling hamburgers instead.  This will definitely be my go to recipe from here on out.

Wow, what a strange and wonderful recipe!  So simple, a little odd that celery goes in the chicken.  But, amazingly great reviews from my family - super moist, very flavorful.  Chicken was not high on our dinner preferences, but this recipe moved it up near the top!  Next time, I'll experiment with some other spices.  WAY better than rotissierie chicken!  For those reviews where the bird wasn't cooked or took too long... the recipe calls for a 3 pound chicken, but you should ALWAYS cook poultry using a thermometer to ensure it's cooked properly -- cooking times vary greatly depending on the size of the chicken and how your oven heats & cooks -- this is not the fault of the person who posted the recipe.

Love this recipe. I used to buy rotisserie chicken because I was scared of trying to cook a whole chicken myself. I came across this recipe and thought it seems simple enough to try for my first time and thought it would be bland but I could try to adjust on future occasions.  It is not bland at all and this has been my go to for roasted chicken for a few years now. Thanks for sharing your grandma's recipe.

I brined my chicken first, for about 3 hours in 2 quarts of water with 1/2 of a cup of Kosher salt, and then proceeded with the recipe exactly as directed. It was moist, flavorful and really tasty. My husband wanted the skin crisped up a bit more, which we'll do next time .

I loved it. The chicken does come out very juicy. I added lemon pepper and celery salt instead of regular salt. I did use onion powder, but also put opinion in the chicken cavity with the celery. It was excellent and smelled delightful.

Wow! So easy and yet so flavorful. I have to say I used to use olive oil for my roasted chicken but for sure butter turns up the flavor here! I used dried garlic instead of dry onion and it was also great!

Truly moist chicken.  I added some rosemary and rubbed sage with pepper.  Bake time increased by 30 min to reach suggested internal temperature.

I always read the recipe, then scan the comments to see the creative effects of others.  Everyone said they followed this recipe and it turned out great.  Well, I added my flair with a little Apple wine, extra butter, and carrots, onion, and celery in the cavity.  It is awesomeness!!!  Juicy, flavorful, easy!!!  Yummy!

Great recipe, super moist! I would recommend cooking the chicken at least 30 mins longer, it wasn't cooked all the way through. Also I used olive oil instead of butter and it made the skin extra crispy. Load up the tray with lots of veggies to enjoy with your chicken, bon appetite!

I used this chicken roasting recipe several times and it's always delicious.  I do usually brine the chicken ahead of time which helps make the meat extra moist.

This was so good!  Only problem was it was not quite done in allotted time, but am sure it is my oven.  It browned evenly and was so succulent.  The only thing we did different was to add garlic, onion, carrots and lemon in cavity.   Yum!  We made a side dish of Stove Top stuffing.  After we get all the meat we can get, then we boil tne carcass to get bits of chicken off.  Then we use the chicken bits, the water we boil it in, the veggies minus lemon, and leftover dressing and bring to boil again and add in noodles until done.  This so good!  I use Amish noodles, but am sure any wide noodle would do.

I had a special birthday party meal to prepare.  I made two birds in the oven and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to cook.  This is the juiciest whole chicken I have ever made.  I put a a sliced onion in with the celery because I did not have onion powder.  I used real butter because I did not have margarine.  Everyone had seconds. My husband raved about this recipe.

Cook time was WAY off. I’ve had it in the oven for an hour and half and it still isn’t at the internal temp of 180. Have not tasted it yet. Added garlic and herb seasoning.

Loved this! The rosemary under the skin sounded a little odd but it produced wonderful flavor and crisp skin.  Made exactly as stated, and it was one of the juiciest I've ever done.

Sooo I followed directions and checked on it after about 50 minutes. Looked good but in my exhausted haze I turned the Stove off! I discovered after about 20 mins. I quickly turned the oven on, basted it and let it cook 30 more minutes. It was yummy. I put half a lemon and garlic in the cavity right b4 cooking .. Yum.

This taste like grandma use to make!!! Sunday dinner!! So simple but the best chicken ever!!! I use my large cast iron skillet to cook it in, works great!!! And I use butter!! So many recipes call for so many herbs and stuff and this proves you don’t need all that fancy stuff! Basic good old fashioned cooking, this makes any cook look good!!! First time baking a chicken use this recipe you will never change how you do it and will make you look like you know what your doing!! Perfection!!!

Absolutely so delicious! Agree that no changes are needed, although I dont keep margarine on hand so I used butter. 
One reviewer commented on the cooking time being too short by an hour,  my chicken was 1.4kg and cooked perfectly with the posted cooking time.

Great recipe! I've been wanting a simple roast chicken recipe that's not too heavily seasoned but still super flavorful, and this one is perfect. My family loved it and I was able to use all the leftover chicken for a couple different dishes after.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This turned out delightfully delicious. I didn’t have onion powder but I cut an onion and stuffed that in and it was still delicious! Will be making this again.

Oh my God this was so good. Even the next day it still was so tender and juicy. I added onions into the cavity along with the celery. Seasoned the outside with garlic powder and twist'd Q sweet mesquite chicken rub. Used the kosher salt inside the cavity and under the skin. It was so delicious must try again.

The directions to roast are not clear, the chicken should roast for 1.15 h at 350C and once the CHICKEN reaches an internal 180C temperature, it should be covered and left for 30 min more.

Truly amazing.  This was one juicy bird! I followed the directions and ingredients as listed.  I had a 4 pound bird so added 15 minutes more to the cooking time. The video shows that they use a lot more than one stalk of celery so I did that too. That part didn't work out too great, but that's on me. Anyway, the recipe couldn't be easier and the results were just great.

First time I've ever actually roasted a chicken (not in a crock pot).  It was delicious!  I did start the bird breast-down and turned it after the first 20 minutes of cooking...  I might have to add a basting in the middle of the baking, too.  The skin was just a tiny bit dry.

It was super delicious, but it was no where near done after 1 hour and 15 minutes. This was frustrating because my daughter had to leave for work.  I ended up cooking it in the microwave for 10 minutes and  at 375 for another half hour or so, and even then there were bloody spots.

Very good! I made the mistake of adding garlic (too much) and cooking it too long but it was still moist and delicious and BF loved it!!! it came out looking beautifully brown....can't wait to try this again and follow the thermometer so I take it earlier.  I also added some carrots and radishes(use these in place of potatoes! taste the same with no calories!) so had a whole meal.

Ok, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used garlic butter instead and no celery.  I also roasted 2 chickens with the 1/2 cup of butter.  I think 1/2 cup for one would have been too much.  Of course I needed a little more time for two birds.  Delicious!

I made a few variations on spices because I like to blaze my own trail and it was delicious!
But I will say what made all the difference was turning the left over butter and chicken juice into a gravy.  It was superb.  The dark meat was so juicy it needed nothing but the breast can never be as moist and this was a brilliant way to enhance it. Just added flour and water and whisked until fully cooked and smooth. So good. 
I will make this dish many more times for sure! Thanks!!!!

This is my favorite chicken recipe! I use real butter and cut a hole in the skin on each breast and stuff a pad of butter on the breasts under the skin to keep it as moist as possible. I also use a roasting pan and cover with the lid after baking instead of foil. Perfect roasted chicken every time.

It was amazing! I used butter flavoered coconut oil (which solisifies when not heated) so I was worried it wouldn't stay juicy, but it did. I also addeed some garlic powder. Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

When I used this recipe i baked it on 400 for 1.5 hrs, sliced it open and it wasn't fully done so i put it back in for 30 more minutes and delicious!!! Juicy and flavorful all the way through.  I seasoned the chicken the day before and put it in a ziplock bag and put it in the refrigerator.

Just plain GOOD. Very moist and since it's in the 90s here today, I cooked my 4.25 lb chicken in my oven roaster for two hours on the porch. Perfection. I will make again and will add a few more spices for a different taste. Thanks for the recipe.  UPDATE: Used the leftovers to make My Favorite Chicken Salad, another all recipes and it's delish!!

I use garlic instead of celery. And butter as well. Threw in leftover onions from another recipe around the chicken in the dish. Cook  1 hour and 30 minutes, for an over 5 lbs bird. Might add another 10 - 15 minutes, no more than 15 minutes. Outstanding! Very juicy!

Here is my experience. I followed directions exactly (used butter instead of margarine). The recipe doesn't say to flip the chicken over halfway so I didn't do that. So, I baked the chicken for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I checked it and it wasn't even close to being done. I added 30 minutes to the timer and checked it again. It still wasn't done according to my thermometer. I added another 30 minutes to the timer. It finally browned to my liking so I took it out, covered it, and let it rest for 20 minutes. When I started cutting into it, I noticed pink juices coming out. Turns out, the bottom of the chicken was still slightly undercooked. When I checked with the meat therm originally, I must have poked near the surface or somewhere really hot because the thermometer showed 165 (I know recipe says 180 but I thought that was too done). Anyways, I have 1/4 of the chicken cut up and pulled apart so I flipped what was left of the carcass and put it back in with the undercooked side up. I set the timer for another 30 minutes. Hopefully it won't dry out the bird. 

1. I think the cook time on the recipe is wrong
2. I think you should flip the bird halfway through the total time (maybe after 1.5 hours?)
3. The simplicity of the seasonings makes this recipe really easy and it actually tastes really good (I picked off a few pieces from the cooked side of the bird)

I will try this again with another whole chicken sometime and update my review.

This recipe is easy and delicious! I did not have margarine on hand and had a bird that really needed to be cooked before my next trip to the store. The only thing I did different was use butter and it turned out excellent! Well, I also love the organs that come with the bird, so I put them in the cavity as well. So so so excellent!

I seasoned with garlic salt and marjoram and a light dusting of Hungarian paprika.  It turned out fantastic.  I'd make it again.

Followed this recipe exactly as listed and ended up with the most delicious, juicy chicken I have not only- ever made- but have ever eaten- anytime, anywhere- ever!! Thank you for sharing this keepsake. Wonder if it would work for Thanksgiving turkey as well? Just give it a try and you will not be let down!! Yummy!

I can't figure out the best way to add the seasonings. If you add butter after seasoning, you're wiping off all the salt and stuff. If you butter first, then the seasonings get melted off. Anyway! However I do it it turns out fantastic. For those of you swearing about it sitting in a puddle of butter and turning nasty, get a roasting pan and rack. This will work for turkeys, ham, roasts, and chicken, you will use it all the time. It's remarkably easy to make Yorkshire pudding in!

I baked just like recipe. I was amazed! I am 65 years old and never knew a chicken could be so tender! The only thing that could have made it that tender was the celery because I have done everything else before. Who knew?

This IS a simple-to-prepare recipe, and oh so good. I had to increase the cooking time by roughly 25 minutes  because my bird weighed a bit over four pounds.
We the two of us  had enjoyed a couple  of hot meals and a couple of chicken sandwiches,  I  made soup! 'Used half water and half chicken broth, added a little salt, then a halved fresh lemon.  'Got 2.5 quarts of SUPER soup!

I made this recipe 2 times.
The first time I followed this recipe I used margarine, I did not have onion powder and did not have celery instead I used garlic powder and used half an onion to stuff the chicken- it came out sooo good. The second time I made this I used butter  and i stuffed the chicken with celery and onions . I was not too crazy with the results because of the butter so I recommend to use margarine-it makes a huge difference.

I had a 7.5 roaster and improvised with what was handy on a snowy day. Made as directed with the following changes: quartered lemon instead of celery; garlic cloves stuffed under the skin as another reviewer did. Took about 2.5 hours to cook, served with stuffing, cranberry sauce, and sautéed green beans and almonds. Delicious and had rave reviews from my hubby and hungry teens, who said it was like a thanksgiving feast.

I adjusted the cooking time because I was using a 4 pound chicken, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out PERFECTLY!  This is going to be my "Go-To" recipe for Roasted Chicken.  Wonderfully flavorful, crispy skin, and moist, tender breast meat.  Not a dry bite anywhere on this chicken!  Tomorrow night, I'm serving the thighs and drumsticks over cooked millet sauteed in the pan drippings.  
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  So simple and, yet, so delicious!

So Simple, So juicy So delicious!  Don't change this recipe; it is PERFECT as is!
Sadly, no picture because we pretty much devoured it.  The aroma in the house was such that we couldn't wait for it to be done!  THEN..  we had to wait for it to rest!  A bit of torture there, I'm not gonna lie :-)  The struggle tonight was REAL!  lol 
  
MAKE THIS!  It's pretty amazing

This recipe certainly turned out a moist roast chicken, but I was a little underwhelmed by the flavor. It was on the bland side for my family. So, while this recipe was very helpful in learning a technique to avoid a dry roast chicken, I think I’m going to need to spice it up to get rousing feedback.

OMG! What a succulent chicken! The only change made was substituting the celery with garlic since my hubby and I prefer it. And based on a few reviews, I went ahead and placed onions underneath the chicken. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Excellent.  I even put the celery in the cavity of the chicken.  Never did that before.  It was great.  I did add about 1/2 cup of water to the pan.  Other then that.  I did what it said and "Perfect-O".  Thanks for this recipe.

I had a larger roasting chicken of 5.5lbs so I baked it 1hr 45min and was overcooked. The roasted veggies I added were the best part, but the butter seemed too unhealthy. I won't make this again.

I cut the butter to half of what it called for and seasoned it with Lemon Pepper Seasoning. The celery was a fantastic idea -- I had no clue how much this would help. 
I would make this again and again and just use different spices. 
I made soup out of the leftover chicken. 
Awesome all around.

This recipe is just SO GOOD. Other than the onion powder i put some big onion pieces inside and it turned out really good. I don’t know how something so simple can be SO GOOD

This was THE best roasted chicken I have ever eaten.  The only thing I did differently was to add a few more spices.  It was so moist and tender.  My husband said it was the best thing I've cooked lately and my mother said it was very good. (He doesn't like chicken much, and my mother's very good means it was out of this world.  This is a keeper.  I roasted some carrots and potatoes in a side pan which made this a complete meal with very little fuss.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was sooooo juicy!! The first time I've ever made a whole chicken, and I can't believe how easy it was! I think it could have had a little more spice to it, but overall, it was delicious.  My chicken was a little larger than the recipe called for, about 5.5 pounds, so I roasted it at 350 for 1 hr and 50 minutes, then let sit with foil covering for 30 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

This was the first whole chicken that I had ever roasted so I was a little nervous about it. There was no reason to be nervous at all! It was amazing!! My family loved it! The only change that I made was that my bird was about twice the size of the suggested size in the recipe so I doubled the ingredients and added time to the bake time to ensure that it was cooked all of the way through. I also used a meat thermometer (didn’t want to eat undercooked chicken). I also basted it about every 20-30 minutes while it cooked. So simple and so delish!! This will definitely be one of my go to recipes for comfort food.

Excellent! Extremely moist and tender. The only thing I changed was I used real butter (just a personal preference) The celery was a bit tougher than I expected but I still enjoyed it as well. Will make again

As many did, as soon as I read it, I thought "Too simple" but I followed it exactly anyway.. The only deviation? I added paprika.
This is the best chicken I have ever made!!
My family absolutely loved it!
5 stars...
As with any dish? Cooking time could be different. Always use a meat thermometer. :)

This was really good.   I would take it out of the oven a little sooner next time.     Around 165F so it's even juicier.   I also added carrots around the chicken in the pan.

Made as written except I slit the skin on top and put butter under the skin. We don’t eat the skin and that’s where all the seasoning so next time I will season and butter under the skin. It turned out very tender.

Confession: I’ve never bought a whole chicken at the grocery store in my life until I was shopping for this recipe. A couple YouTube videos on removing the inners of the chicken and I followed the recipe exactly. VERY easy and totally delicious. Tender, juicy, flavorful chicken.  Cant believe how simple it was. Will be making it again and again!

Excellent recipe. I had a 5lb chicken, so set the temp at 375. The chicken was crispy on the outside but moist throughout. Wouldn’t change the recipe at all.

Excellent!  First time i can honestly say my roasted chicken turned out great.  I had a large 6 pound chicken so i used double the ingredients but super easy and flavorful.  I also used butter instead of margarine which i rubbed under the breast skin, too.   My 6 lb. chicken took a little more than 2 hours.  Super juicy and lots of pan juices for gravy.  I always thought you needed some water or broth to prevent drying but not true.  This was moist and beautifully browned. I roasted this in my deep dish copper chef pan which is great from oven to stove top to make gravy.  Dont skimp on the onion powder as it is the sole seasoning that gives the chicken flavor.

Excellent. I added some garlic powder, paprika, and rosemary. I had a 5.5lb chicken; needed about 2hr 15min to get to 175F

Super easy recipe, made a few changes based on some recommendations but have no doubt the original would have been wonderful as well.

In addition to the celery I put a clove of garlic and quarter of an onion in the chicken. Under the skin I added some chopped garlic and herb de provence and instead of margarine I used Earth Balance to make it a kosher friendly meal. I did use the onion powder on the outside as well as the original calls for.

About 30 minutes before the chicken was due to be done I added some chopped carrots, mushrooms, yellow squash, and potatoes that I tossed with olive oil, rosemary and thyme. Be careful this did increase the cooking time of the chicken a little so might add them 45 minutes before the chicken is due to be done next time, and basted a few times during that period. 

Came out really tasty and the veggies completed the meal.

Fantastic!  I usually make Sticky Chicky in the crock-pot when I'm cooking a whole chicken, but this might have become my go-to recipe.

I made this last night exactly as written.  My roasted chicken turned out just like the photo.  A first for me.  My family was thrilled and nothing but complimentary.  The chicken was fall off the bone tender and juicy.  My family said from now on this is the only way I should make chicken.  Thanks for sharing this simple recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

What can I add to the other reviewers...not a thing.  Simply the best moist and yummy chicken I have ever eaten.  I did not have celery so I stuffed the cavity with onions and celery salt and garlic pepper onion salt inside and out with butter and spices under the skin.  WOW!!  Hubby thought it was the best chicken ever and that's good enough for me.  Thanks for this GREAT RECIPE!!

My kids don’t like the taste of celery so I stuffed the cavity with an onion.  I also cooked it for 1 hour 15 minutes at 350 degrees and then I turned up the heat to 425 degrees for another 15 minutes because I couldn’t get the internal temp of the chicken up to 180 degrees and the chicken was very pink after 75 minutes.  This chicken was delicious.  We are it for Thanksgiving dinner.

This was good, but not quite as juicy as I was expecting from all the reviews.  I followed the recipe, but didn't have celery, so stuffed with an onion and had to cook for about another 15 minutes to get it up to temp.

I’ve made this several times now, sometimes using margarine and sometimes butter, and also with and without the celery. In my opinion it came out wonderful each time. I think the onion powder is the star ingredient. I use slightly less than the recipe calls for.  This is my go-to recipe for roast chicken now.

Very easy and makes a tender juicy bird!  Took a 5.8 lb bird 2 hours 10 minutes in the oven.  Add an unpeeled, cubed russet potato to the bottom of the dish for the best potatoes you’ve ever had!

I didn't actually try it - I made it on 11/4/17 for my family and then met up with girlfriends.  My sons loved it!  Hubs said it was good and my daughter ate a few bites without too much complaining.

I've made this simple, yet superb, dish on 3 occasions and the chicken comes out juicy and lip-smacking delicious each time. I've tried other  (famous) preparations, which have been excellent, but I keep going back to this one, which gets the most raves from my family.

Couple comments: I check roasting time with the instant thermometer, and let the bird rest for 10 min before serving. Which makes it even more juicy! 

This recipe totally stands on its own, but here are a few SLIGHT variations to consider: I've used only onion powder and another time, I also added garlic powder, which I recommend. But it's awesome with just the onion powder if  you don't want to add garlic. I combine raw onion with the celery in the cavity (along with the other listed ingredients) and smear 2 TBS salted butter (I used Irish butter, but I'm sure other types will be good) underneath the skin on top, in addition to putting butter in the cavity. It does not make it too buttery - at least for us! About 45 min into cooking (3 or so lb bird), I add onion, celery and carrots to the roasting pan. By then, delicious jus has pooled in the bottom of the pan. I also add a cup of chicken stock (store bought) at that time to increase the amount of jus, since my family loves it so much. 

I usually serve the chicken with rice (potatoes are great too), au jus and veggies from the pan. I encourage you to try this dish, you'll love it!

Please make this  as directed. I did and it was fantastic! So juicy and full of flavor. Would be great for any special dinner or  for company. I read the positive reviews and have to agree it was even better than I thought it would be. I'm making soup with the little that was left.  My chicken was huge so it was in the oven longer,but that was the only difference from what was directed.Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe on 10/28/17. I made it on Saturday evening for Sunday dinner. I got two sanders farm whole young chicken at Walnart meat center on Thursday 10/27/17 for 0.97 cents a pound. I pay $10.30 for two pack. I wasn't sure if I needed get roasting chicken or  whole young chicken. I decided get two young chicken. I only cook one as trial test because I am cook other one on vertern day for my man who is a veteran. I follow recipe to t except I didnt use twine. This chicken was juicy favoriteful and delclious. Only thing I didnt like is didnt say was and dry bird . clean the chicken thoroughly and remove all content from the activity. Pat dry the chicken with paper towel. This chicken was so good. The hardestbpart was getting chicken neck ,giblets, heart out of chicken. It was not in a bag like butterball turkey. I had to reach inside and get the giblets neck and heart out.  Some cooks especially inexperienced ones might not known to take the heart giblets, and neck out if the bird. Because NY bird was 5 pounds I cook it at 350  for 2hours and twenty minutes. I cook at 2 hours and fifteen minutes.vThen I let it broil for 5 minutes. After hour at 350 I  basted it every  twenty minutes with juices from pan.

It was ok. Not as much flavor as I like. I think the trick to this recipe is to first ...check the weight of the bird you are cooking. 2nd...make sure you use a meat thermometer to test for doneness. Mine was not done after the hour and fifteen including another 30 minutes of rest time. I had to put mine back in for another half hour. I used my meat thermometer both times...turned out way better after an additional 30 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees.

I had a 5.3 pound chicken, so I guessed at how much time I'd have to cook it.  When I put the thermometer in, it was way over done.  I couldn't believe how moist it still was.  Great recipe!!!!

Good. May not make again as it splattered much more than my regular recipe into the oven. Poster's comment about the recipe not using butter. Umm....hate to break the news, but the video does say margarine or... BUTTER. There's a recipe on this site for slow cooked chicken (5 hours at 250 deg. F) that is much less mess to clean up.  (Roast Sticky Chicken) This recipe is very tasty, though and thanks for the recipe.

So simple, yet so good! Definitely the juiciest chicken ever. Only variance was I had to use chives because I didn't have onion powder. Love it.

I have to admit I was perplexed when I read this recipe. I have never heard of stuffing the cavity of a chicken with celery before roasting it. I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out juicy and tender.  I'm thinking the moisture from the celery must be responsible.

I, like many other non-believers, saw this recipe and thought.........there's no way this can have close to 5 stars and rave reviews w/ so few ingredients.  Call me a fool & go ahead & kick my a@*!  This is the juiciest chicken I've ever had! My only mistake is that I didn't sprinkle enough of the spices on there.  I guess I got scared I'd make it too salty or peppery.  That was my fault though, and in no way did it affect how juicy the chicken came out.  I used butter because it's all I had.  My mother was sucking the meat off the bone!   When it was time to put the leftover chicken away, I picked it up and the bone from the wing just fell right out!  That's how moist and juicy this came out!  I will definitely be making this again in the future.

This is a family favorite. It is easy to make. It calls for just a few ingredients. And the meat is aways extremely moist.  I always follow this recipe exactly as it is written.

This was a lovely chicken - I just had to make it the day before my dinner party because I didn't have oven space so I let it cool cut it up and put in baking pan covered and refrigerated overnight - next day I put it under the broiler  8 mins to crisp it up and it didn't dry out at all it was delicious.

followed the recipe exactly. I needed to keep the chicken in the oven a few minutes longer than listed, but otherwise it was just as described. Very juicy, very tender.

Honestly, this is the best recipe on how to cook a chicken and keep it moist. The meat was literally falling off the bones when we were cutting it - extremely tender. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because the flavour was quite weak. It tasted good, but nothing extraordinary. So I'm making it a whole lot spicier and marinating it overnight, but keeping the cooking technique the same.

This was amazing. I'm so glad I read the reviews--one said something like, "Don't be fooled by the few, simple ingredients." That's exactly what I had been thinking: it can't be that great because the recipe doesn't look like anything special. But it is. My chicken was perfectly flavored and so juicy. I will make it again and again!

I followed instructions to the max had to cook it 30 minutes longer with the foil, it was moist but not enough flavor for us so may increase garlic next time or add rosmary .

The best chicken I could ever make. Even the white meat was tender and juicy. It was so good even the stock I made from the bones was very tasty. Like others I used butter instead. It got rave reviews from my family. Definitely a keeper.

Made as directed with the exception the breast side was down by accident.  This kept the spices from sinking in as well as they did on the legs and underside.  The next time i'm going to add some poultry seasoning or mix of herbs.

This was actually excellent. I cooked my 3.31 lb chicken for 1.5 hours, then let sit for 1/2 hr as written. The chicken was succulent. Dipping the chicken pieces in the juices before eating was heaven.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt.

AMAZING!!! So simple, made it exactly as the recipe said( except real butter instead of margerine), and perfection!
Incredibly juicy and flavourful. My new go-to. Even the picky kids were fighting for more.

This was my first time making a whole chicken and me and my fiancé loved it! It was very moist and fell off the bone. I even used any extra meat chicken salad sandwiches so nothing went to waste. I would definitely make this again.

It was very tasty and juicy.  I wish I would have browned it more, but it was delicious.

This is my family's go to recipe. We dine at a local German restaurant in town and tried replicating their recipe. I was so happy when I tried this recipe and it was a match.

This was great. Very simple and the chicken turned out really moist.  Instead of using the margarine, I used a mix of melted butter and olive oil and brushed it on the skin and under the skin.  I also added some fresh Tarragon.  This is a great base recipe and you can change it up a lot with different herbs for a change.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it as is with NO changes and was pleasantly surprised by how much flavor was in this chicken! My Husband loved the simplicity and gave his thumbs up approval! The only thing is that I cooked it in my dutch oven with the lid off so it took another 35 minutes extra to cook. Next time I'll cook it with the lid on or use a casserole dish instead. It's definitely a keeper!

I too, was looking for an easy and fast way to roast a whole chicken. Googled it, and this was the one I made! Simple and oh so yummy. I do change the seasoning a little each time. ex; I put an onion inside the bird with celery and or whole carrots. I have also put whole garlic inside the bird when baking as well. The things I do not change are the salt, pepper and butter! I use as directed every time. I believe these are the essential seasons and way to keep the bird the most moist! I also, typically use a larger bird too. I am feeding a 15 year old football player! Just try it one time, I'm sure it will be your go to as well!

Typically, I prefer more seasoning/herbs when roasting chicken, but this worked very well for wanting to use the remaining chicken in other dishes requiring different and more seasoning. Used my gas grill rotisserie option to make this instead of firing up the oven and it came out very juicy and tender, just enough flavor too. Skin was not crisp though. Perhaps it would have been using the oven method. Followed all recipe steps, but tied the legs and wings for the rotisserie. If you choose to make it on rotisserie, just follow the manufacturer instructions to do so. You'll need indirect heat and put a pan underneath to catch the drippings for sure! The whole chicken I had was almost 6 lb and took about 2.5 hours to cook through. Used a meat thermometer and removed chicken at 165 degrees, placed on platter and tented with foil to let rest for 10 minutes before carving/slicing. Will be making this again! Thanks for sharing your grandmother's recipe!

Praise you and all that is holy in chicken, I have never made chicken alone in my life nor have I ever made anything that came out of the oven so insanely delicious. I am new on my cooking journey, so this was a wonderful place to start. After it came out of the oven I cut it up and put it in a cheesy tortilla to make chicken quesadillas. An hour plus for that recipe was probably too extra, but I don't care, it was delicious. Thanks so much!

I made this exactly as instructed.  The cooking time worked perfectly for the size of chicken I roasted.  The chicken turned out perfect !! It was so juicy, and very tasty with the celery pieces.  I will definitely use this method again.

This recipe is a perfect example of making delicious moist chicken without allot of herbs, seasonings, etc.  I have been a long time advocate of less is best to actually bring out the best natural flavors in meat. Love this recipe and thank you for sharing it!

Very juicy, and the house smelled awesome while it was cooking, but ultimately lacking in flavor.  Definitely an easy way of cooking a chicken.  I might try this again, with a mix of additional spices, making sure to fully lift the skin and distribute them under the skin across the whole chicken.  I only lifted the skin in a few places, as the instructions didn't really say to do that.  Also, I noticed some reviewers said it wasn't done in the stated time -- make sure you account for the size of the bird, and use a meat thermometer.

I am extremely disappointed that I can only give 5 stars.
This is by far the BEST chicken recipe I have ever used. 
My bird was raised in my back yard, and she weighed more than the 3 lbs the recipie calls for, so I just increased the amount of ingredients listed. So amazing! 
I promise you if you're looking at the ingredients and think it's nothing special, you're wrong. Please give this a try AS WRITTEN!

5/1/17 - This was good, beautiful coming out of the oven - I stuffed my cavity with celery, onion and carrots, otherwise followed the recipe and made gravy from the drippings.  It was good but didn't have that "wow" factor for me!

The chicken did come out juicy and the only thing I did different was lay some Turkey Bacon over the top. At the end I pulled the bacon off and put the chicken under broiler to crisp up skin.

I've made this four times now.  The first time I used butter because I wouldn't use margarine on anything.  The last 3 times, I made it with margarine and it came out so much better!  Great color, crispy skin.  I did put fresh garlic in the cavity this last time.  Still great!!!  Everyone loves it and I'm not the best cook around.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I've used this recipe three times, and now I won't roast a small chicken any other way. I use a smoked chicken and rib rub (sea salt, pepper, brown sugar, cumin, natural smoke) from a small local supplier and skip the garlic powder just in case our two dogs want a little piece, and they always do. One day I won't skip it and have to deal with their purposely manipulative sad expressions. Moist, succulent chicken every time.

Literally the juiciest chicken I've ever had. Will try to use this for my Thanksgiving turkey as well. I added garlic powder as well as the onion powder and used real butter but otherwise followed the recipe/instructions exactly. Mine needed longer to cook though

This was simple and very tasty! I stuffed the cavity with the celery, several cloves of garlic and a small yellow onion that I had quartered. Placed in baking dish atop some cut up carrots and more celery. I also used real butter.

This recipe is amazing! I've made it probably 5 times and it's always juicy and full of flavor. I do make a few additions/changes - but they are minor. I have issues with dairy and substitute ghee for butter and margarine in recipes - which I did for this one.  I used an organic chicken yummy! I added a few cut up cloves of garlic and some onion in the cavity of the chicken - it always comes out so juicy and delicious!  I made this the last time my brother in law was in town and he devoured it and said it was the best tasting chicken he has ever had!  Thanks for an awesome an awesome recipe!

This recipe is perfect. FYI though,  if you have a larger chicken like I did (6.3#)  it will take two hours.  Delicious and perfectly crisp skin ;)

Excellent recipe as written. My 5 lb. bird was done in 2 hr.  Added carrots, onions & potatoes to roaster & continued to bake as the bird rested 40 min.  Everything was devoured.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is no lie a fantastic chicken recipe. Hands down my favourite. I suggest everyone including vegans to try this recipe for it is indeed beyond delicious.

TIP: I like to inject the residual juices into the meat right after I pull it out of the oven, then let sit like the recipe indicates.

This recipe is so good! We follow all instructions! We used all ingredients except for celery cause we were out and it still came out incredible. The flavour is so good but so simple! My husband and I are impressed. We had it with rice and salad and made a light gravy from drippings leftover and added some original franks hot sauce for a little kick on our rice. It was excellent! Glad you shared it

I have made this several times, but I use butter not margarine.  It works best with celery, but I've used lemon, bell pepper, and the onion with success.

I cannot believe how simple and easy this was and with so few ingredients. I have concocted so many different rubs and what not for chicken but I swear this was one of the best I have ever had. This was juicy and delicious and I used real butter and followed the recipe exactly. 

Thank you.

Wow!  This makes amazing chicken....soooo moist and juicy.  I had a 5 pound chicken and thought I'd need to cook it an hour longer, but it only took 20 minutes more (and probably could have cooked a little less).  This was so easy and so tasty...will add it to our list of favorite meals!

I've made this a few times now.  This recipe is great at producing a juicy chicken, but I'm not too crazy about the onion powder flavor.  I think that the butter and celery are really the only ingredients that matter with regard to juiciness, so I've been experimenting with different dry rubs.  Right now my dry rub is equal parts onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper, and a few drops of liquid smoke.  Also, I recently tried doing a chicken with butter dolloped on one half and margarine dolloped on the other half, and the butter half was WAY crispier, so I think I'll stick with butter only from here on out.  Also, it helps if you brine the chicken.

We just made this a couple nights ago and it turned out fantastic !! We had a 5lb chicken so had to up the time to accommodate since it's listed for a 3lb chicken. We guessed at 2 hours and 5 minutes for our 5 pounder. It came out a tad dry but I believe that was our fault for over cooking. We checked it around an hour and 50 minutes and the temp was right at 160 so I think if we had turned off the oven and let it sit in there for about 10 minutes then taken it out and let it rest (it still cooks a bit after removing from oven) then it would have been spot on perfect. We are going to try that again next time which will actually be tonight, it was that yummy ! We followed the recipe as written...well to be 100% fair we do not own nor everrrr use margarine and I can't have butter so we used Melt for the margarine. It's a coconut and palm oil type "butter".  We put some veggies (carrots, turnip root, brussel sprouts, and onion) on the bottom of the pan to roast under the chicken. SO SO GOOD ! The flavor is phenomenal and the cooking method is great if you get the time right and keep a check on the internal temp. This one and the other recipe we have used from here (Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style) a couple times are definite keepers, we plan on trying this recipe with the other ones cooking method (lower temp for longer) and see how it turns out. Love them both but this one is favorite so far !

I've made this twice now and ready today to make it again.  Only change I made was to use real butter.  I don't know why this tastes so good because it is so simple, but it does.   I'm very glad I found this recipe.

This was excellent!   I don't buy margarine so used butter instead -- I used only 1/4 of a cup instead of 1/2 as the recipe suggests.   It was so good and so juicy!

I made it exactly as described.  It was juicy, but there wasn't alot of flavor.  Also, I felt guilty using all that butter.  I am guessing the butter is the reason for the juiciness.  If I were to do it again I would add more spices.

The recipe is easy to prepare, but after 1 1/2 hrs in the oven at 350 F it is not close to being done.  My gas oven heats properly and I don't usually have any problem roasting pork or beef following Allrecipies.com recipes.  Has anyone else run into this?

A very good and juicy roast chicken.  It has been awhile since I have cooked a whole chicken and was very happy to have found this recipe.  I did cut back a little on the butter and it was still juicy and tender.  After reading the reviews I did add half an hour of baking time as my chicken was 4lbs.  I certainly would use this recipe again maybe adding a few more seasonings.  Very good!!

I usually dry chicken out so I made sure to only cook for specified time and to use thermometer  to check if cooked. I used the foil over the top once out of oven for half an hour. This was the best, juciest chicken ever! I received compliments all around!

I made this and followed the recipe exactly at written - with the exception of adjusting the cooking time since my chicken was heavier than 3lbs. It turned out amazing and it was so incredibly simple! This is now my go-to roasted chicken recipe.

By far the best (and easiest) roast chicken I've ever made! Although at this temp (350) I find it takes closer to 2 hours to cook (I baste at 1hr15min then cook for another 45 mins at least). I use butter instead of margarine, and onion granules instead of powder. I also sometimes chop up a few onions, splash them with olive oil, salt and pepper, and throw them in the roasting pan. They basically carmelize and add even more delicious sweet onion flavor to the bird!

This chicken was excellent! So juicy!  I added a sprinkle of parsley for a little color but did not make any changes. I used the juices to make a gravy with a little gluten free flour and chicken broth. I will definitely be making this again! My  family loved it!!!!! Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!

I used a 5 lb bird and prepared it as called for (minus the celery - was out).  I cooked it at 350 for 2 hours and let it rest (covered) for 20 minutes before cutting.  It was delicious, juicy, and devoured!  I think I'll try this with a small turkey breast next.

This was easy to make. Yes, it was moist but no wonder,  it called for a whole stick of marg (i used butter). Certainly was bland for all the seasoning and veggies - i added half-dozen small green onions in cavity with celery and sprinkled garlic powder everywhere. Subtle but bland. Was hoping for Pow! Perhaps all that marg/butter overpowered. Lastly, do not recommend covering for 30 mins after roasting to 180 degrees - the dern thing is ready to eat at 180; consequently, when trying to slice our chicken it was just in shreds. Leg and wing bones pulled away from the overcooked meat. Skin, of course, was like rubber. A real disappointment - the bird smelled delicious while roasting.

This is the BEST chicken recipe I've ever tasted and is now the only way I prepare chicken. I made a few changes, like I eye the butter- I put enough to coat the inside and put dollops on top because it creates a crispier skin. I also put a HELLA amount of garlic powder/garlic salt. It makes a salty (though not so salty its unedible) skin on the chicken and it's just delicious (if you like salty foods or fried chicken you'll love it). Putting butter inside also makes the meat really tender and juicy and man this chicken is just too perfect.

Like most comments I thought this isn't much different than the way I've made it for years but mine always comes out dryer than I'd like so I  tried it exactly as written. Don't know what did it but no lie this chicken came out so moist and delicious. My family said it was the best I've ever made.  Next time I plan to add garlic powder and cajun seasoning. I don't know what the celery does but I'm gonna keep putting it.

Love this recipe exactly as written and I recommend making it exactly as written the 1st time (using margarine and not butter, celery and not other things and 25 minutes a pound in the oven), after you are comfortable with the recipe then adjust to your personal taste, i.e. I prefer garlic powder to onion powder.  The margarine keeps the chicken juicier than butter does (I tried both) and for those who said the chicken was underdone but used larger birds...simple math, 3 lb bird was an hour and 15 minutes, if you are using a larger bird it will need more time...the math is simple, the recipe calls for 25 minute a pound so adjust your time according to how big your chicken is) and after resting double check for doneness with a meat thermometer and juices running clear.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe as long as you follow the recipe as written...it's as classic a roast chicken recipe as you can get and tried and true...I use this recipe every time...Love love love it.

The internal temperature listed in this recipe is incorrect. It should be 165 degrees not 180 degrees.   If you cook it to 180, it will be over done and dry.  Also at a temperature of 350 to skin won't get crispy enough.  It's a basic recipe, but it seems to have a few errors.

I just made sure the chicken skin was really dry by padding it with paper towel before I prepared it.   It was great.

Just made it and it was juicy and delicious.  Even my husband liked it when he prefers dry meats.  Followed the recipe, but had to double it because I could only find a 6 pound chicken even though I preferred a 3 pound one since it was only for my husband and me.  Since it was a 6 pound chicken, I also doubled the cooking time.  But basically  it took that 2 1/2 hours for the internal temperature of 180 degrees which is the key to having it well cooked. After the chicken cooked for a hour or less,  I did put about 1/2 cup each of both sliced carrots and onions around the chicken with a little water to help cook them.  This way I had my cooked vegetables and it made the gravy tasty as well.

I made this for the first time almost 2 years ago for thanksgiving after a trip home was cancelled at the last minute.  My husband doesn't like chicken (his mom always overcooked it), but LOVES when I use this recipe!. I cook it twice a month and use the leftovers for a pasta dish for the next night's dinner. The only thing I change is adding real onions to the chicken (inside and around the top) rather than the onion powder.

I made this chicken tonight and followed the recipe, just added a bit of garlic powder. Delicious!  Very juicy and tender. I did let it cook longer than recommended as the chicken I had was 5 lb. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

This is insanely delicious. It's so simple. Such simple ingredients but it's juicy and has a unique flavor. Even leftovers are juicy!! I used actual butter because we don't have margarine. And put some of the butter underneath the skin. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It's great!! Highly recommend ??

I have made roast chicken a few times before and they always turn out a little (to A LOT) dry. I was very skeptical of this recipe as to the "juiciness" claim but tried it anyway. I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic and very juicy. Well almost EXACTLY, I don't use margarine  so I used butter instead. No unsalted butter. Will definitely make this again. I did have to bake a little beyond the 1 hour and 15 minutes but that is due to my oven I'm sure.

Could only find a 5.5 lb chicken at the market. I brined it in saltwater for 1 hr then seasoned it with salt and pepper all around then the 1/2c butter mixed with chopped garlic. I filled the cavity with rosemary sprigs, 1 carrot and 1/4 onion. I followed the instructions on the allrecipes "best roasted chicken tips and times" ( http://dish.allrecipes.com/the-best-roast-chicken/ ) so I baked it at 425 for 15 min breast side up then turned the heat down to 350 for the remaining baking time and turned it breast down. 15 min before it was done, I turned it back, breast side up and turned the heat up to 450 to brown the skin. Turned out amazing and moist!! Very happy with this recipe.

Made this chicken exactly as the recipe says. Came out very good, really juicy. I think this is going to be my "Go To" chicken recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Such a simple and easy way to roast a whole chicken. I cooked breast side up, tucking the wing tips under the wings, and tying the legs together with kitchen twine. I looked delicious BEFORE I cooked it! I've added before and after photos. My wife and kids were all happy with the dish! I served with wild rice and lima beans. Looking forward to doing this one again :)

This was really tasty!  Due to our scheduling (being away from home for a few hours), I put the 6-lb chicken in the crockpot and cooked it on High.  In addition to the celery and seasonings in the cavity, I also put in a few cloves of garlic, since we love garlic.  I used butter instead of margarine since that's what I had, but put in a little less than called for - just under half a stick of butter.
You know the chicken is good when you ask your "selective" child if she's eaten her corn yet and she says, "No, Mom, but this chicken is so good!"  After she ate all her food, she then had seconds of the chicken!  
Thanks for a great recipe.  I am looking forward to trying it again with the suggested cooking method of roasting.

Such simple ingredients and simple method but don't let that fool you.  I have tried roasting chicken all day, brining, rubbing ingredients under the skin and I would say this simple recipe is close to the best recipe I've ever made.  I did at white wine in the roasting pan and the end result dipping sauce was AMAZING

Love how simple and satisfying this recipe is. Grandmas certainly do know best and if it aint broke, don't try to fix it! It was juicy and tender and full of flavor. Took what little remained and had awesome homemade chicken soup!

I loved this! I mixed it with the Moist Garlic Roasted Chicken recipe and used all the ingredients in both as well as some additional ones. I popped it in a pyrex dish (my roasting pan didn't fit in the European oven!) and added all the ingredients + some extra spices (chopped onion, garlic salt, garlic cloves inside/outside, lemons everywhere, provincial herbs, butter) and then brushed the liquid over (no baste tool in Spain!) once and it was still perfect. Near the end I covered it loosely in aluminium, turned off the oven and let it rest in there for a while as I prepared the other food. It came out soo juicy, flavorful, delicious, it didn't even need something to dip in because it's so yummy.  Would make again definitely!

So simple and delicious. A great recipe to teach others who are intimidated by roasted chicken. I love to add spices like cumin, garlic powder and paprika as well but it's delicious as it.

I agree with Jenny! So simple and easy to make with spectacular taste. So tender and juicy. I did have to cook a little longer then said time as my oven is really old. And like Jenny i used real butter.

This chicken was very good:  moist, tender, and tasty.  I did add some extra spices:  garlic powder and minced garlic, and a little oyster sauce.  I used chunks of onion to stuff into the cavity of the chicken, along with the butter, and celery salt.( didn't have celery).

Delicious.  Followed the recipe, but the cooking time was at least 30 minutes off.  I did use a thermometer and it took me about 2 hours to get to 180 degrees.  It may be that my oven is off.

I did not have celery, but stuffed the interior of the chicken with baby carrots.

The chicken has lots of succulent flavor and I will be making this again.  Today I get to enjoy delicious chicken salad from the left overs.

I've never submitted a review before, but it's a must with this wonderfully tasty, and extremely simple recipe. My family raves about it every single time. Please, please make it at least once, exactly as the recipe appears. You'll see why we say this, and what we're all raving  about. This recipe is perfect as is. It's so flavorful and juicy. 
Even the worst cooks, including myself, can't go wrong with this recipe. It seems unbelievable that these few simple ingredients can produce such outstanding results, but they do. 
Your kitchen will smell like a dream!
 Oh, I do add one tiny thing. I toss an onion into the chicken cavity with the celery, but it's not a must. Just something to honor my own moms memory. She never cooked any whole bird without an onion and celery inside. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe! It's the one thing I cook that comes out great hands down. ENJOY IT!

This absolutely delicious chicken was an ad on in my dinner rotation!  It is SO EASY I could not believe it!  Out of preference I added more butter and not only stuffed it with celery but onion as well.  Put a little chicken broth on the bottom of the pan and threw some carrots and onion in there .  Awesome!

Love this simple recipe.  I don't understand how it turns out so juicy, but it does. The only thing I changed is after taking it out of the  oven I don't baste it with the drippings or cover it with foil. I did do that the first time but I lost the crispy skin. 
Instead I remove the chicken from the pan and put my pan on the stove, add cornstarch and extra water to make a simple gravy, yum!!
Thank you for such a great recipe.

I made this chicken last night for dinner.   My family loved it and I would definitely make it again.  I did notice it took longer to cook than specified but I'm blaming my oven for that.  Might be off more than I realized.  My only concern was there was a lot of fat in my pan.  Far too much to make a gravy with.  Again, could have been fault of the chicken and not the recipe.

Really easy to make and turned out to be the best whole chicken I've eaten.  I didn't have celery, but followed the rest of the recipe pretty much.  I did add a touch of herbs on the outside.

Well I finally made a recipe without  changing anything! I still don't understand why this was so good. Keep it simple and use lots of butter! The chicken breasts were the most tender thing I've ever had. Nothing was dry. I also put a couple slabs of butter under the skin which was amazing.

Always moist and tasty without being greasy.  I have used celery inside the bird as well as half a lemon.  I liberally salt and pepper the outside before putting in oven.

I made it without celery, I didn't have any at home. And I used blended Onions instead of onion powder. It came out really great. Very juicy and tasty.  Thank you!

So simple, yet comes out delicious!  I put some of the butter under the skin to make it extra juicy and then roasted it breast side down for an hour then flipped it over and roasted until done.

I feel reluctant in writing since I did not use ingredients. I used more ingredients and minced not ground. No fresh herbs. Did put pats of butter under skin and in cavity. Salt ,pepper, basil, garlic minced,onion minced, and lemon pepper.

I followed the receipe exactly except used real butter, longer cooking time (because i had a larger chicken) and added some red potatoes and carrots  to the pan.
This chicken was very juicy and quite flavorful! I was surprised because i usually add garlic and onions to everything but decided to leave them out and stay true to this recipe.  Something about seasoning inside the bird and filling it with celery seems to be the "secret" to this receipe's success! I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty and moist. My bird was a little bigger, just needed 30 min longer to cook.  Only thing I added was some garlic cloves inside chicken and some garlic power.

Perfect combination of spices. I don't like celery so I used a wedge of onion.  Family loved it, skin was perfect and the white meat was juicy.

I would make this every week. I stumbled onto the recipe and I am soooo happy I did!! I also used garlic powder instead of onion.  I did everything else as the recipe states.  My chicken was a little bigger (4.3 pounds) so I cooked for 1 hour 40 minutes and then tented for 30 minutes.  Came out perfect!! Outstanding recipe!!

This was awesome... I've been doing rotisserie chickens for awhile, but this came out so perfectly, skin was awesome, meat was juicy, I may start roasting again!  You really don't need to doctor it up, just follow the recipe.  I didn't have margarine, so used butter.  Is that what made it so great?  

I took it out when the meat was just over 170 (180 seems way too high).

Awesome! Simple, tasty, juicy, moist! Followed the recipe. The only thing I did different was I added a whole bulb of garlic (the top being cut off ) into the cavity with the celery for aroma. Very good recipe. I have a rotisserie in my kitchen but will alternate between both methods of cooking a whole chicken going forward.

I'm no cook, but I tried this simple recipe exactly & it turned out to be the juiciest meat I've ever tasted. Even my fussy hubby loved it! I don't know if it was the type of chicken I bought or my new convection oven and this recipe that made the difference, but whatever. I'll definitely make it again, so easy & delicious!

Just made it exactly as written-no changes. I originally used butter but read further into the reviews and immediately threw out the butter and used margarine. It was delish, moist and tasty and easy.  People giving bad reviews because they don't know how to judge how long a bigger chicken takes to cook is just plain ridiculous. Buy a meat thermometer instead of giving a bad review because of your own mistake.

This is my third time to make this. I absolutely love the way this turns out every single time. The only change I made was was quartering a lemon and adding it to the cavity with the celery. This is an easy, stunning roasted chicken.

This is a really good basic recipe. The only changes I sometimes make is to use butter instead of margarine and I mix in a tablespoon of garlic powder into the butter and rub the chicken with it.  I also add fresh garlic to the cavity and sometimes also lemon quarters. My cooking time is longer than the hour and fifteen minutes. Use a thermometer to make sure the chicken is adequately cooked.

My chicken turned out juicy as promised, but it was flavorless. My taste buds need more than salt, pepper and onion powder. Will make again but will add more spices next time.

I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken. Recipe as is tastes good. I also created a carrot sauce with wine and thyme to resolve the dry chicken breast issue.

Made this for the first time, followed the recipe exactly  as written but used butter instead of margarine. This was so delicious!!! Will definitely make again and see no reason in changing this wonderfully simple recipe. Also the drippings made the best chicken gravy ever!!!

I used butter, and then I used more  celery than it called for (I love veggies). Next time I will experiment with different vegetables, and also spices. I used garlic salt this time, but my father roasted chicken with paprika, salt, and lots of pepper. I followed the timing, and my chicken was perfect!!

Since finding this recipe, it's the only way I roast a chicken. I don't know how something so simple can turn out so perfectly wonderful, but it does. I follow the recipe exactly. It comes out moist, flavorful and scrumptious. Simply the best way to roast a chicken!

Loved it. Super easy. I used  1 stick of butter and it was a lot as the chicken was sitting in a pool of butter. Next time,  I would use half the amount. I will make this for guests in the future! My husband thought I bought a rotisserie chicken!

Very easy to put together and has a very nice flavor. I did think it was just a little greasy from the margarine but nobody else complained as the bones were picked cleaned.

I had some huge chicken legs and I used this recipe and threw it into a crockpot for about 3.5 hours. It was delicious. I used the recipe and put onion and garlic powder on the chicken and threw some sprigs of rosemary in because I didn't want them to go bad. I could have thrown some onions in too. I would make this again!

Very good! I followed this recipe exactly as written with the exception of cooking time. My chicken needed about 20 more minutes in the oven.  It is a simple recipe with delicious final result.

Not bad at all!  However,  I think for that size chicken 50 minutes to an hour is sufficient time to roast. The breast meat was awfully dry

A good go-to recipe for roasted chicken. I only changed the margarine to butter. I don't use margarine.

Grandma had it goin' on.  This recipe was true to claim.  I used butter instead of the margarine & the only deviation I made from her recipe was to take a pat of butter, sprinkled with the onion powder & tucked it under the skin on each side of the breast.  The chicken was moist & delicious.  Beware, dipping French bread in the drippings can be addictive!  Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe today and loved it. I did not have onion powder, but I did have a package of knorr onion/garlic soup mix and I used that instead. It turned out so good! I was scraping the brown bits off the sides. I did find that I needed to cook it a fair bit longer than called for though.

Great recipe and I have tried many but this recipe is simple with only a few spices and just as good as the more complicated recipes that require a bunch of spices and time in fridge before even cooking. 
I would also strongly suggest using a meat thermometer  to avoid over or under cooking. All ovens heat and cook differently.

I used a large roaster...about 7 lbs.  The cook time was about 2 1/2 hours.  But...it came out just as pictured and the grandkids loved it.  It was soft and juicy.  I removed skin and boned to serve on table and the taste was great!

Awesome and simple recipe. I did make one minor change though. I can't have onion powder so I put a half of onion in the chicken.  Probably the tastiest whole chicken I have ever had, Family loved it too. I had carrots and potatoes as a side seasoned with the drippings.

The recipe is really very good but the cook and cool times are way, way off. Especially if you're in a slightly elevated area. I cooked a 4.25 lb chicken for over an hour at 425, and let cool just 10 minutes. If you were to cook this at 350, you'd need to do it for 2.5 hours. Believe me, I've tried.

I only made one addition to this DELICIOUS  chicken recipe, by adding about 8 halved  garlic cloves into the cavity of the chicken, and under the skin.  I will definitely use this recipe again...yummy!

This is a great recipe when you don't have all of the special bits like thyme and rosemary and whatnot. We are collage students so I used butter because we didn't have margarine and added some cloves of garlic in the cavity with the butter,  threw it in the oven, checked the temp and seriously this is just awesome! Much better than Ramen haha.

This was the best tasting roasted chicken. My 7yr old son ate 1/2 the chicken. It took 1 1/2 hrs. The last 10 min I turned it up to 375 to get the skin more crispy. All I can say is WOW, awesome flavor and so easy to make. I really enjoyed the celery too!

Made it as is and it was very good. I think it needed a little more cook time though, but I did throw potatoes and carrots in the pan and covered it, so maybe that's why.

Wow was this juicy.  I had to use onions and garlic instead of celery because it turned out I didn't have any.  I also basically caked the breast side up chicken in butter.  My oven is off, so I had to cook it about 45mins longer, and each time I checked it, I basted it.  It was amazing.  Kind of wish I didn't know how good this was as we usually get store made rotisserie chicken and this was far superior.

This recipe - specifically the trick with the margarine (albeit I used butter) - made this the most moist chicken I've ever had.  It's incredibly moist; surprisingly so.  I covered it with foil for an hour and baked the last 15-min uncovered.  After resting for 30 min, it was apparent upon carving to the base of the breast that it could have stood another 10 minutes in the oven.  Every oven's different, so no worries there.

Great recipe! I didn't have a whole chicken. Thought I did but found out after the chicken thawed that it was 10 pieces of thighs frozen together that took on the appearance of a whole freak'in chicken! Anyway. So here's what I did. I stuck to the recipe and only added chicken base water at bottom. Salt and peppered ckn both sides and then brushed some margarine on. Put a small rack in the middle of the pan (enough to fit two pieces on top) then added the ingredients on the bottom. Filled the pan with the ckn pieces and closed the lid for baking. After an hour, removed the lid and browned the top of ckn for about 15 minutes, as it took. Turned off oven and closed lid again and stayed in oven till put on table. Best  recipe this side of the Mississippi !!

Very juicy! Used butter instead of margarine. I also added a few different spices and salt flavours.

This is the best chicken ever.  Simple, passed down from generation to generation from Grandma to mom to me.  Love it!  Juicy, tender, tasty!  Comfort food, served with mashed potatoes, roasted beets, corn on the cob and a 7-layer salad.  Fantastic!  Wouldn't change a thing!

Very easy.  Followed directions to a tee and it came out very juicy.  I did add garlic powder as well.  Next time I think I will add more salt.

My Grandmother, also of German descent,  made chicken this way.  Thanks for submitting this.  I had forgotten this recipe.  I also slice onions and place under the chicken.  It keeps it from sticking to the pan.   Always turns out juicy....

I have NEVER left a review but this was fabulous. I followed the recipe to a tee except I don't buy margarine so I used butter. It was unbelievable. I will make it this way all the time! When I lived near a Wegman's, I used to buy their roasted chickens b/c they were delicious...but NO MORE.....seriously.....this was incredibly delicious and easy. I did have to bake it longer but I think my oven needs calibrating. I used a thermometer to check doneness. How does your grandmother make turkeys?

This chicken recipe is out of this world delicious. I have made it a few times and it comes out perfect every time. It is super easy to make and clean up is quick. My family loves it, they can't tell the difference from the rotisserie chickens from the market.

I made this recipe exactly as written. 
I'm not sure what the fuss was about. It came out pretty much like any other whole roasted chicken,  and just tasted like good chicken.  I don't think I'll make this again unless I'm out of ingredients or I'm looking for and 3 minute prep whole roasted chicken recipe in the future.

OK. So, I will start by saying this chicken was surprisingly juicy and flavorful considering the very few seasonings used. But, I have a large family and used an 8lb chicken. It took like 3 hours to cook through. I would use more salt than I did as well. Overall, good recipe and will try again.

Apart from the simplicity, I tried this mainly because of Jenny's 
glowing review. Maybe the celery steams the inside while the generous salt seal the outside, but however it happens, it's  lovely.  I'll never roast a chicken any other way.  Thank you and your oma Robin.

I have to admit that I had no onion powder. So I loosened the skin around the chicken and placed thinly sliced onions under the skin along with  some of the margarine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This was the best oven roasted chicken we have ever had; so moist, so juicy, so tasty. I will continue to roast chicken this way from now on. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Amazing taste and amazingly SIMPLE ... only thing I added was a little bit of McCormicks' Total Seasoning for Chicken & Fish ... also, roasted uncovered at 350 for TWO hours ... and used the meat thermometer ... til it read 360 inside! came out perfect and I had a 5.5 pound bird!

This is my go to chicken recipe. I follow the recipe exactly except I add my own seasoning. It's never failed me! For those of you who say your bird wasn't cooked all the way through, are you sure you got a 3 pound chicken? If not you will have to adjust the time accordingly.

It's a keeper for sure! I had never made a whole chicken before and this recipe was delicious! I will absolutely be making this on a regular basis. I followed the recipe as is except for adding a couple of garlic cloves (minced)! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Best bird ever!  Super simple!  I followed the directions but I had a 5 lb bird and I used butter.   I had to adjust accordingly.  Hubby said best bird ever!  I usually make mine with many many seasonings and they do not taste this good!

I made it with no celery as I had none and placed the bird on top of a sliced onion.  This is a very moist chicken recipe and as my hubby actually raved over the breast the next day( he usually won't eat it) this is now my go to choice. Thank you for posting this recipe. P.S. Cooked this in a cast iron pan and the gravy was awesome

This is the ONLY way to bake a chicken. Sometimes I switch up the seasonings a bit just for a change.

I added oregano and stuffed a lemon inside and a few garlic cloves and I made some slits in the chicken and stuffed a few sliced up cloves. Amazing! Made a side or orzo with Lemmon asparagus.

Made it as written except used butter instead of margarine.  Baked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours and it was beautifully browned and moist....a perfect roasted chicken!

Amazing as is!!! I have made this over 20 times and it is great.  The things I did do, I did for personal taste - I add a small cup of chicken  broth to the bottom of the roasting pan. I also add more butter and I baste the chicken with it as it cooks. I  cook the chicken longer and I turn the oven up to 400 so the skin gets extra crispy.  Finally, after everyone has eaten. I take whatever is left throw it in a big pot with broth and water (just enough water to cover the chicken)  I boil  it down on medium heat until it literally falls apart. I then, drain the pot and I save the liquid. It makes the BEST chicken stock ever!!!  I freeze it in Tupperware and I use it for future recipe's. The left over chicken I pick apart and I save that as well.  The stock from this chicken adds a depth of flavor to any recipes.  Thank you for posting this recipe. It's my go-to chicken and I always get rave reviews. So again, thank you!!!!

If you're baking a skinless chicken in a bag and want to know the perfect cook time and temperature, this is it! I don't really follow the recipe... but it deserves five stars for being the only thing to give me the info I needed.

This chicken was great, the only changes I had were using butter instead of margarine but that's because I didn't have enough margarine, and I baked it 10 minutes longer than it said to. It was delicious!

Haven’t reviewed many recipes here, but have some favs. This is on the top of my list! Perfect as written (I use butter, but that’s me). This is not only juicy & delicious but also changed me from a whole chicken novice to an expert overnight. Been using it for months and wouldn’t change a thing! Thanks for sharing!

I'm impressed with the recipe... I'm a First timer and people where shocked at my home dinner when I served them this... They simply loved it!
A query though, how can I get the skin more crisp?

It was perfect! I had a little bigger chicken so I just increased the bake time by 20 minutes per pound. I also used real butter instead of margarine! It was so so so good! Juicy and delicious! I paired it with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans sautéed with onion and bacon! This is a keeper!

Made a few times before exactly as written- so good! We decided to mix it up a little this time around and put it on the smoker for an hour first and oh my goodness it was delicious. After it smoked for 1 hour we baked it at 350 until completely cooked through, about an hour and 15 minutes. I made gravy from the giblets and drippings to top chicken and mashed potatoes. This is a killer recipe! Great as is or with a few tweaks.

I had to add issues with the temperature but I added an extra 15mins then an extra 10mins and then it was perfect. I didn't have onion powder but I used garlic powder, pepper and seasoning salt. Everyone loved it. And it was very juicy.

So many folks out there who just can't keep their hands off a simple, perfect recipe and think they have a better idea.  Follow the recipe.  What happened to making sure you have all the ingredients on hand before you start a new recipe?  My grandmother was Polish and came over on a boat.  She also cooked and baked very basic foods.  Trust me, nobody came close to starving or turned their noses up at breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert.   Delicious baked chicken, moist and tender every time.  Time to go buy a nice chubby chicken for dinner!

I added some thyme and and butter, with lemon and bay leaves in the cavity. Really juicy but it was not done in the time the recipe allotted. I even did 375, but when I cut into it after letting it rest, it was not done... my family was not happy waiting longer for dinner

This is my first ever roasted chicken attempt, and this review is the first I've ever written on a recipe...   It turned out so So SO amazingly delicious I just had to share!!  Like others, I'd intended to make modifications to the recipe upon first glance, but after reading the reviews and suggestions to leave it as is, I decided to follow the instructions exactly as posted, and I can't believe how great my chicken turned out.  I've never tasted one better in any home or restaurant in my entire life.  It's unbelievably juicy and tasty.  This will be my go-to dish from now on anytime I have someone to impress.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

Made this chicken today and my husband and I carved off pieces of it for chicken sandwiches.  Having it for dinner with salad and rice tonight.
This was a fantastic recipe.  I followed the directions and made it just as written.  I wouldn't change a thing and will continue to make this often.  
This chicken is better than the whole cooked chickens you can buy at the store.  It was perfectly juicy and packed with flavor!!
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Other than adding an extra stalk of celery for a larger roaster I made this as recipe calls for.  Extremely moist and I can't imagine ever leaving out celery again.  I will make this again but will add in  one of my usual mixes of herbs and seasonings for more robust flavor.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This turned out perfect and will be my go-to method for cooking a whole chicken. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using butter instead of margarine (I didn't have margarine on hand). Easy recipe to follow with very few basic ingredients but yields awesome results. Thanks for sharing!

Sounded too easy to be very special....but trusted the reviews and am so glad I did! DELICIOUS and so moist and tender.
Used onion in bird instead of celery and garlic powder instead of onion powder. 3 T Butter in bird, 2 T canola margerine rubbed on entire outside of bird, heavily seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. Cooked 5# chicken, breast side down on foil lined baking sheet at 350 degrees for 2 hours, uncovered. Rested 30 minutes.
Made best gravy ever with pan drippings, 2 T flour and 1 cup milk,  Skimmed fat off . Mmmmmm!
Hubby loved it. Now will be my forever basic chicken recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I made this as written. Pretty darn good. i baked it uncovered for the stated time & my thermometer read 180 deg. i took it out of the oven & let it rest for 30 min as stated. However when i went to plate the chicken i noticed some blood running out. I put it back in the oven in a covered roasting pan for an additional 30 min. Came out great! Still very juicy. The gravy I made from the juices was Awesome!!! I will make this again but will cook it longer. Like they say, oven temps vary. Still  good!!!!

Simple and Delicious. Used recipe multiple times. Played around with spices on top of chicken including rosemary and steak spice. I prefer to use butter instead of margarine.

This was really juicy! It was really simple, but tasted amazing. I used real butter instead of margarine and paprika instead of pepper, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I plan on making this more regularly.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. It is the juiciest tastiest chicken. For a one pot meal dice 1/2 onion, 2 carrot sticks, 2 celery stalks and 5 large new potatoes. Place at the bottom of the baking dish underneath the chicken. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth before putting in the oven to cook. You can thicken the broth at the bottom of the pan later for gravy. So delicious!

I   did not change anything on this recipe. It was delicious.  I used an all natural chicken because the flavor is so much better.  I made chicken soup with the leftovers and the flavor of the chicken enhanced it.  My friends loved it.

I have made this chicken several times. As well as many other recipes on All Recipes however this is my first review. I'm only reviewing because of how amazing this turns out. I followed the recipe exactly. And the chicken turns out juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside and is always a hit with my family. Not to mention super easy to make. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

11/13/15 made this for family tonight with no substitutions.  Turned out as one of the juiciest and best roasted chickens.  We all agreed that this was the best.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again and again.

Made this with a 9lb oven stuffer roaster. Came out great. Nice and juicy.  Only mod was that I don't have margarine and just used butter.

Super simple, quality recipe. The key merit of this recipe is you don't need a lot of ingredients-- just onion powder, salt, pepper and butter. The quantity of butter used really insures "juicyness".

It seems too simple, but it's fabulous exactly as written. I did use softened butter which I rubbed all over the chicken before I seasoned it. I tossed some baby potatoes, carrots, and onion in some olive oil and seasoning and roasted with the chicken, increasing the baking time slightly. Hubby loved it!!

Homerun. In the sense that it really is a juicy chicken and this is now a staple in the cooking arsenal. But, the cooking time isn't 1:15. It'll take longer

This was good. I would make it again. You probably want to change the cooking time. It is way off and could get an inexperienced cook sick. Have your meat thermometer handy. I put the chicken on a bed of sweet potatoes. That was the best part since the potatoes soaked up all the juices.

Very good tasting roasted chicken. I needed to make some chicken thighs and wanted something easy and simple. This isn't anything fancy, but it's a simple dish that you can spice up on your own. 

So, I had 8 chicken thighs that I seasoned on both sides with the addition of garlic powder. Started skin side down and flipped it halfway. Started at 350 degrees. When I flipped it, I raised it to 375. Baked for an hour.  When I just need to bake chicken without thinking about it, I will do this again.

Followed recipe exact with these additions:
 - placed butter in cavity as required and then push left over butter from the 1 stick under the skin in breast and thighs.
- replace or augment celery with a whole orange cut in wedges and placed in cavity
- use onion powder and garlic powder as called for. 
- Placed chicken in a Le  Creuset Pot breast side down on top of carrots 
-add mushrooms and small potatoes and/or thin sliced sweet potatoes to the pot around the chicken.

Boyfriend ate till he was sick. So juicy. Doubled the recipe  for a 8 pound chicken. I also took a trick from another recipe. I put the butter clumps under the skin to keep it put and to make it juicier. I also put garlic cloves in and around the chicken. I also put small potato's and celery around it too. The juices were to die for plus mixed with the veggies and potatos yumm!!

I used this the first time I have ever roasted a chicken and it was simple enough to make.  It tasted great, but I did have to cook it for about 30 mins longer than the listed time.  I will make it again, but maybe only use half the margerine listed in the recipe.

The chicken turned out so moist! Great recipe! I didn't have any onion powder so I used poultry seasoning instead. I also used butter instead of margarine. I will be using this recipe again and again!

This was delicious! Do yourself a favor and make this as written. I had a 7 lb. roaster so I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours, but at the 1-1/2 hour mark, I took it out and basted it. 
The most juicy roasted chicken I have ever made! My family couldn't get enough! They loved it! Flavorful, moist and simple! My new go-to recipe when I want to roast a whole chicken.Thanks for sharing!

i learned how to make this chicken from my grandmother over 50 years ago.  i disagree, however, with the temperature of the done bird.  Using a thermometer, the bird is done @165 degrees f.  Check both the breast and thigh the proper temp.  if you want, wrap an aluminum can in tin foil and place into cavity  of the bird, open side out,  and balance on end in the oven.  This helps the thighs reach temp at the same time of the breasts.  This method speeds cooking time as well, so start checking temps at 45 minutes.

This recipe is really delicious and very easy. I ended up adding about 30 mins to the baking time and careful monitored the temperature until I decided it was done. I will make this again.

Simple ingredients leading to a pretty good result.I had a bigger bird so I adjusted the roasting time. I couldn't help cutting the amount of the margarine to 5 Tablespoons. 1/2 cup just sounded like too much.

My son was very pleased with the results, but I did up the time to 2 hours.  It was still juicy and delicious, but I didn't think the cooking time was right for a whole chicken.

This recipe is wonderful- EASY, flavorful, and moist!  I prepped the chicken per the recipe.  The only thing I did different was set the bird on top of coarsely chopped onion, celery & carrots (for my gravy recipe & used the drippings).  It was sooooooo good!  Thank you!!

Short story: Super easy prep, delicious chicken, took longer to cook than recipe stated.  

I made this yesterday.

I picked up a new puppy Saturday and am home all week with her. I enjoy cooking and make an effort to do it when I am home and free of obligations. I wanted a hearty recipe that I wouldn't cook normally (ie. cooking time is super long - so I could never cook this on a normal night when I get home at 5:30 or so). Watching a puppy while cooking, something easy on prep was ideal.  

This was perfect! The prep is (as you can see from the recipe) super easy! The chicken was juicy and delicious.  

As one other reviewer noted, it did take much longer than 1 hour and 15 minutes for me to get to 180 degrees.  Maybe my chicken was larger (or possibly extra cold from the grocery store since I had picked it up earlier)?  Either way, I would guess it ended up in the oven for an hour and 45 minutes.

Made it with a 5+ lb. bird. Of course, had to cook a bit longer but that's what a good meat thermometer is for (that's for the dude/chick who said their bird wasn't done). We actually went to 195 degrees, and it was super tender, moist, juicy, and delicious. Good job to your grandma.

Did exactly what it said it would do.  I have a big family, so I cooked 2, so it naturally took longer, however, the recipe was easy to follow and the chicken did indeed come out nice and juicy- including the white meat!

Definitely juicy.  Really good.  However once I realized how much margarine this called for I almost called it quits, only because of the massive amount of trans fats.  Next time I make this I might use butter instead.

I cooked a gigantic 6lb chicken with this recipe.  I used 2 stalks of celery instead of one because it was huge.  I also used butter instead of margarine, and put it under the skin rather then on top because we don't eat the skin.  Delicious!  This was the juiciest chicken I have ever made! And pretty easy too! Thank you!

Very simple recipe and so delicious! I do equal parts onion powder, salt and pepper (usually only 2 tsp of each). I once accidently used garlic powder instead of onion and it still turned out delicious! I have also adapted this to use on chicken legs, super easy to prepare and serve with the same great flavor.

I don't understand--how is this so consistently delicious? I've made it a dozen or so times at this point, for some VERY picky eaters. And every single time--folks love it. I did the same as everyone else. I looked at the ingredients and thought it couldn't be that good. IT IS! I will say I don't have margarine in the house, so I will swap out for butter. And occasionally I will throw in fresh garlic rather than the powder. YUM!!!!!

This was a simple recipe that was extraordinary in flavor.  I liked this better than the Moist Garlic Chicken on this site.  The method is better IMO & I would make this recipe over the other one.  However, the temperature should be 190 degrees and the time should be approx 1 & 1/2 hrs.

Our chicken was almost 6 pounds, so we doubled the onion powder and celery, but kept to 1/4C butter (cut up) for inside the bird (we don't do margarine) and poured 1/4C olive oil over top (which makes for a great skin, all you skin lovers out there).  Being larger, it did take longer for the chicken to cook.  It had good flavor, but did taste a little greasy to me.  If I make again, I would cut the butter to 2T.

I didn't have onion powder, so I subbed garlic powder, and it still came out great!  Very easy and tasty.

Couldn't be any easier as I did not have all the fancy ingredients other recipes call for.  Was done in 1 hour and 15 minutes and very juicy and tasty.

This turned out exceptionally moist. I was happy with it. 
Adding garlic powder gave it more flavor, which bumped it up to 4 stars for us with that modification. I will make it again.

This was excellent!  Yes, it seems simple, but it turned out very flavorful, juicy, and tender.   The gravy  we made from the drippings was great too. The only change I made was adding garlic powder with the onion powder and using butter. Thanks for a great recipe!

I adore this recipe. It's perfect exactly as it is. You can also use it as a base and add chunks of garlic, rosemary, carrots, potatoes, etc.

My husband loved this recipe, found it moist & tasty. I found it moist, but tasteless. The 3 tbls. of onion powder, at least 1 1/2 tbl. of salt 1 tsp pepper did nothing.  It also took an extra 20 minutes to cook.  Make sure you use a meat thermometer or you'll over cook the bird. I will try more seasonings next try as I do love a roasted bird and this one was moist.

I used to make roast chicken every week, but haven't made one in years because they are so easy to buy fully cooked.  I decided to make one today and am so glad I did!  This recipe was easy to make, juicy and delicious.  After reading the reviews, I made it exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. Best of all, I know exactly what is in it with no artificial ingredients.  Will definitely make this again.

Thank you so much for posting this yummy easy chicken recipe.   The whole family loved it and I followed the direction as written.  Used the drippings to make the gravy and found recipe on this site called Roast Chicken Pan Gravy since I like gravy with my meat.   The two together were amazing.  Thank you again!!!!

I am just now learning how to cook and my family had gotten a whole chicken from the food bank and we weren't sure how we wanted to cook it so I Googled "whole chicken recipes" and this one came up.  I tried it out tonight and it came out perfect and that's from a first timer!  My only tip as a newly beginning cooker, make sure the oven is on the right temperature.  I set mine too low and it took an extra 45 minutes to cook the chicken.  MY BAD.  It was delicious!  Late addition to this.  Was so disappointed when I bought a cookbook at a yard sale today and this exact recipe was on the last page.

My husband exclaimed "Wow, this is a keeper and please make it again, if it's not too much trouble." He normally does not get that excited about dinner. All I can say is this is a recipe that will impress whomever you make it for and it lives up to it's name ...so juicy. I added some soy sauce for color but no other changes. Served it with roasted carrots and fresh sage.  Yummy and  thanks!

Good, not as ovrewhelmingly spectacular as I was hoping but tasty and actually quiet juicy. I would liken it to rotisserie style chicken. May make again when Im feeling lazy, and fancy a change ;-

Absolutely delicious and sooooo easy! I used butter instead of margarine and threw in some chopped carrots, onions, a few garlic cloves, some extra celery and mushrooms that I had laying around and put them all around the chicken.

Always love recipes that are handed down, you know they are tried and true. This is another that is a gem! Have followed the recipe using margarine, and also with butter. It's important to  use the margarine!!! For some reason it MAKES the flavor. So this evening I tried rosemary and garlic sprinkled on top, it added some good flavor.

OMG! I cannot believe how simple and delicious this recipe is! Thank you so much! I made it last night, and it was my first time roasting a chicken. The recipe is VERY forgiving. I think I messed up on a lot of steps like adding too much onion powder and salt and overcooking the chicken, but it still turned out great!

This was an absolutely superb recipe, hands down.  So easy, as long as you follow the directions.  I did use butter instead of margarine (personal preference) and it was delicious.   The only thing is, I'm just trying to figure out how the recipe states that a single 3 pound chicken cooked this way will feed six people.  No way!  I cooked two 3-pounders for my family of six (one of them being a 2-year-old), and we nearly wiped them both out!  YUM!

For some reason this took way longer to cook than 1 hr 15 mins. And I usually shorten cook times with my oven. It took about 1 hr 45. But it was delicious!

Tender meat, crispy skin.  I put some of the margarine "under" the skin.  So easy to make with such good results.

Great recipe! Seasoned with the salt, pepper, onion powder and added a little dusting of zenders chicken seasoning because we love it so much. Used the celery and added half a mandarin orange and chopped elephant garlic to the cavity along with the butter. Of course seasoned the inside. Placed slices of elephant garlic under the skin in several places. Seasoned and rubbed butter under the skin as well. Started by cooking it at 450 for 15 minutes and then reduced heat to 350 and cooked for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Then removed from oven and covered w foil for maybe 10 minutes. It was fabulous! Whole chickens and myself have not really ever gotten along but I am confident this is the recipe I will stick with. Thank you so much for giving me a starting point. My family cleaned their plates and asked for more!

My own fault it didn't receive 5 stars. I picked up a whole chicken, which I have never cooked first, then found the recipe. My chicken was nearly 5.5 pounds. I followed the directions but wanted a one pan meal so I added some cut sweet potatoes, a couple of wedged onions and 6 ears of corn to the bottom, put the chicken on top and cooked for a total of 2 hours to reach 180 internal temp. Next time I will 1) buy the right sized bird or cover with foil for the last half of cooking. 2) put the corn on the bottom of the chicken and surround chicken with sweet potatoes. Everything was delish!

A perfect simple roasted chicken that comes out exceptionally tended on the inside while still crisp on the outside.  The recipe calls for a very small chicken.  So, if you are following the recipe timing exactly, get a chicken in the right size, or it will be under cooked.  Adjusting the timing would work for a larger bird, of course, but I'll leave math to the mathematicians.

When I read the recipe and reviews I was a little skeptical that this was going to be the greatest chicken ever. But indeed it was! I'm still amazed how little ingredients can be so tasty. I followed the recipe as it is (had to use garlic powder instead because I didn't have the onion one, and butter because I never have margarine) and had to resist the temptation to add herbs. I had some extra celery I couldn't fit in the cavity so I threw them around and they were to die for! Cooked it longer until it was golden brown. Hubby and I loved it, and this recipe it's definitely a keeper.

Made this exactly as written & it was perfect! Just as juicy as a rotisserie chicken. Also made another variation 1st time since didn't have specified ingredients on hand...subbed onion & seasoning salt. Fantastic both times. My husband & kids ALL love it & they are tough critics. Also, she kindly specified the size of her bird as 3 lbs. Size obviously affects cook time! My chickens were 3.5lbs, so my cook time increased 30 min. 180 degrees exactly. Oh, and I'm a novice cook. You can't mess this up! Thank u!!!

So, I decided to try this recipe simply because it looked quite easy and I have a very picky 5 year old son. This recipe ended up simply AMAZING! My husband walked in the door from work and instantly started to drool just from the smell and my son even asked for seconds! I added some bbq chicken spice to it just to mix it up a little and was not disappointed. Highly recommend. You will love this!

This recipe is so simple – oh my gosh – but you end up with a beautiful looking roast chicken that really makes a wonderful presentation and even more importantly, a scrumptious dinner! It takes me about three minutes to put this together and throw it in the oven in my roasting pan – honestly I'm so glad I found this recipe – thanks for submitting it!

Pretty darn good chicken recipe!! I had close to a 5 lb chicken so cooked for close to two hours. I also added fresh garlic cloves inside the bird and garlic powder on the exterior. Absolutely delicious!! Give it a try. Very juicy and tasty, too!!!

I'm currently making this now, it smells AMAZING! Only thing I did different was I added fresh garlic into the cavity along with rosemary. I also stuffed margarine under the skin and cooked the bird breast side down so the juices run down into the breast meat. Then I flip it over the last 20 mins or so to Brown and continue basting it. Yummy Great recipe!!!

Thank You ROBINROCKINBIRD! Followed your recipe exactly. After reading the critical reviews I was a little concerned and should not have worried. I was smart enough to avoid opening the oven while cooking.  However, I do to a phone call, I did leave it for an hour and thirty minutes. Followed your instructions to tent it for 30 minutes while I finished my sides. It was perfect. Will roast every chicken in the future exactly the same way.

This is the only way I cook chicken ever since I found this recipe.  It's super easy and the taste is fantastic.  My husband and 4 kids want it over rotisserie chicken every time!  I drizzle a little olive oil on top (instead of using butter in and around the chicken) then sprinkle on the seasonings and salt.  I like to experiment with different spices.  It always comes out great.  

I also cook mine for about 2 hours.  My oven takes a little longer to cook.  Always a winner of a meal.

Thank you ROBINROCKINGBIRD!

Yummo! I've roasted a few chickens and this by far was the best one ever. What an easy recipe!  We had a really large bird (8.5 lbs) so it needed to cook for 3 hours so I was a little worried but it was still as juicy and moist as ever. This will be my go to recipe for roasted chicken from now on.

Scrumptious!!! So EASY...so delicious. Made gravy from drippings and served with mashed potatoes and baked carrots. The BEST roasted chicken I have ever made. Did have to cook longer than recipe called for though. YUM.

This is my second attempt at roast chicken and it turned out absolutely amazing with this recipe, won't change a thing other than I added too much salt lol. My family wanted thirds but there wasn't enough, this one is going in our weekly rotation for sure!

This was a fabulous recipe! I did not have onion powder so I used garlic powder instead. I also roasted the chicken breast side down and for 2 hours instead of the recommended 1. 
This will be my go-to recipe for roasted chicken for now on and next time I will do two hens instead of one.

This is so simple and thank you German grandma! I did not have onion powder so I put 1/4 onion and 1 celery chopped as directed in the cavity of the chicken. I baked at 425 degrees for first hour and half since I had a big bird and then decreased heat to 325 degrees the last hour or so... Very moist and tasty with fall of the bone chicken! Great with summer corn on the cob and mashed potatoes for my Ohio family!

This recipe is super simple and the results are absolutely delicious. This was my first time cooking a whole chicken and I figured simplicity was key. This recipe isn't fussy and requires only minimal ingredients but the chicken is succulent and tasty. I used the pan dripping to make a dressing for the chicken and mashed potatoes. Love this recipe and will make it over and over. Superb!!

Excellent! I seasoned with season salt instead of salt & pepper. I added onions & garlic in the cavity like most reviews suggested. I haven't stopped hearing compliments!

The smell will drive you crazy. 
This is one of those meals you prepare when you want everyone nice and hungry upon serving.  It smells so good that I couldn't concentrate on much other than the chicken!  It is as good as everyone says.  I had the same issue with cooking time as another reviewer.  I oven baked it exactly as stated, but after one hour and 15 minutes,  my chicken was still bloody inside and the temp was 140.  I used a large baking pan.  Next time I'll use my smaller Dutch Oven to see if that makes a difference.   My advice is to judge cooking time by the stated internal temperature.  But, the recipe is definitely a very easy 5 star recipe!

This made an amazing chicken with no adjustments.  I was a little concerned that the minimal seasonings would leave it tasting on the bland side, but it was absolutely delicious and was the juiciest bird I've ever had.  It was full of flavor and was moister than even a rotisserie chicken.  It makes great leftovers too.  This will be a regular in our house and a given when company comes.

Replace margarine with olive oil for healthy cooking.  Cut breast skin away from raw chicken and olive oil between as well as on top.

Just made this for my in-laws over the weekend and it was fabulous.  I had a 4.5lb bird, followed the recipe exactly, cooked it for 1hr 45mins (I don't like to take a chance with undercooked chicken!), let it rest tented as directed, and even sliced it and let it sit under foil until we were ready to eat.  It was juicy, delicious, and flavorful! I will be making this again for sure!

People, this is a great starter if you have never roasted a chicken.  I just came in to check oven timing. I put onions and celery in the cavity for flavor while roasting and then discard. I put butter and minced garlic under the skin, top the bird with onion powder, garlic powder, and parsley flakes. I use tin foil on the wings. I spray my roasting pan with butter spray. Add carrots and potatoes half way through cooking time. One pot meal. Easy Peasy.

The description fits this recipe perfectly. I also don't like when people rate a recipe after they have made multiple changes, but I have to admit that I did one thing differently. I washed the cavity and outside of the chicken with one lime before seasoning the bird with the ingredients listed. I'm Haitian and we don't cook any meat, especially poultry without washing it either lime/lemon/vinegar. It was delicious!

My family loved this chicken!  That's saying something since one does not like chicken on the bone and the other doesn't like chicken. I only added a little garlic powder  used half the butter and cooked 10 minutes longer since it was bigger than 3 lbs. delicious!  Thanks
For a wonderful easy dinner option.

Really good recipe. Simple and tasty. I've never had a recipe for a small whole chicken and had it cook in the time stated. I needed an extra 45 minutes to get it to the proper internal temperature. It was juicy and delicious!  Definite family pleaser.

I have made many many roasted chickens over the years for several occasions and you can doll them up in very creative ways. This is a simple yet very good recipe. My go to base is the same and you can just change it up depending on your mood. I have stuffed the cavity with everything from various fruits and veges plus spices. Tonight I did an orange, rosemary, real butter, and fresh garlic with sea salt and pepper, with real butter. It turned out amazing as always. I think one of the best things you can do is add some of your spices on top between the skin and breast with butter for that extra flavor. Serve with potatoes and steamed broccoli or asparagus.

This recipe is the bomb! So easy to make. The only thing I wasn't clear about was do you cook it breast side down. I think I over cooked it a little, but it still came out juicy! Hands down this is the way to cook a whole chicken if you want it juicy and not dry!

Love this recipe. Followed it mostly to a T but added a bit of garlic salt, chicken seasoning and seasoning salt to spice it up a bit more. It surprisingly wasn't as salty as maybe expected. Cooked it 15 minutes longer. I made this a second time without using as much butter - turned out great. Give it a try for sure!

Great easy recipe. The only additions I did we're I used some olive oil on outside of chicken (to me butter just melts off) but I did use butter too. I also added rosemary and parsley under skin of chicken.

Absolutely the best chicken ever.  I made it exactly to the recipe and it was very moist and tasty.  It is like magic in a pan.

This was the best, easiest and most delicious chicken I have ever made.  My husband loved it and he is not usually a roast chicken fan.  Will definitely make this again.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Incredibly tender, juicy and delicious! I made just as is with two necessary exceptions: first, I was cooking a 5.5 lb. chicken, so I added 1 hour to the cooking time. And second, the recipe calls for cooking this to an internal temperature of 180 and that is actually going to overcook your chicken. 165 is perfectly and safely cooked, so check and take your chicken out when the thermometer reads about 160 degrees. Then let the chicken rest for about 20 minutes and it will finish cooking to a perfect 165.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Only thing in the recipe I changed was we omitted the celery as no one here eats it. The rest we followed as is. For me it was hard to carve (it was so tender and juicy, it just shredded to bits.) The skin had a wonderful flavor that went along well with the meat. Next time I'll use a little more seasoning to see if we can get it to permeate the meat better & add some potatoes to get a full meal out of it. Definitely a keeper and a great time saver!

I added 30 min to my 5.5 lb chicken and it was still very undercooked.  Added another 30 minutes and some parts were still undercooked.

Other than that, the meat was moist and flavorful.  Will use a little less pepper next time, too spicy for my toddler boys.

Made this recipe several times & love it. I find it just as good without adding butter. I now put chunks of celery, onion & lemons in the cavity after seasoning & before roasting.

Just made my first roasted chicken.  It was soooo good. I can't believe a chicken roasted uncovered could be so moist.  Followed the recipe exact except used butter.  I only had butter.  It was fantastic!

Its true- I made this just as recipe states (except used real butter and had to cook half an hour longer) ---everyone said it was delicious, even picky teenagers who fancy themselves food network foodies. I might try it again with margarine - why not?

This was awesome!!! Like others said, do it just like the recipe says. Only thing I added was carrots as well as the celery. And put extra celery and carrots in the pan around the chicken. 
And the next day, used the drippings to make soup. Amazing!!!!
Drippings, plus left over veggies, plus leftover chicken meat, slow cooked in a pot with water.
Added extra celery and carrots and noodles.
YUMMY!!!!

I went to the store to buy a chicken and the turkey's were cheaper. I used this recipe as written with a 6 lb turkey breast. I just used twice the ingredients and a meat therometer. I surrounded the turkey with cut up red potatoes and carrots. I stirred the vegetables a couple of times. It was unbelievably moist and delicous. My family devoured it!

Like others, I was amazed something so delicious could result from something so simple!! Truly amazing ... chicken was so flavourful and juicy. The skin didn't brown on top though, so next time I might slide some butter underneath the skin before cooking. But really a terrific go-to recipe!

Holy cow!!  
I needed to find a quick, easy, yummy recipe for a whole chicken.  (I was SO tired of baking and boiling the chickens)  I picked this recipe since I actually HAD all of the ingredients on the list.   OMG  OMG  OMG  OMG
This chicken was really juicy and amazing.  A HUGE hit with the family and (again) TOO easy!!  The only thing I would say, is that the cooking time should be adjusted to 1 hour and 20-30 minutes.  
This really is a GREAT recipe!!

Came back to rate and review. I’ve made this chicken so many times, and it never fails. I’ve used more butter, occasionally , but usually just follow it exactly as written. Oh, I recently left the lid on until  half an hour before the timer went off and sprinkled some paprika and seasoned salt on the skin, just to brown it, and it was still amazing.

I made this last night for my family and only change I did was add garlic powder as I did not have onion powder. My roasted chicken came out so moist and tender and so good. This is a keeper for sure.

This chicken was the best I've ever made! I purchased a pre-brined organic roasting chicken from Trader Joes and followed the recipe to the letter.  I did sprinkle on a bit of garlic powder and paprika in addition to the onion powder.  Super juicy and delicious!

I cannot believe I have not rated this. My go to, can't wait to eat comfort food that is versatile.the first time I followed the recipe exactly and fell in love. After that I have played with it but not much!  I don't cook poultry by time, instead I use a thermometer. A ooking spray on the outside, butter in the cavity, few things I few things i have tried was starting it in the crockpot and then towards the end transferring everything to a roasting pan. That makes delicious moist chicken. I have also just wadded up foil balls, sPrayed it with cam not stingy with butter. It really allows the skin to crisp. The flavor is delicious, the chicken is moist and the simple veggies just make the dish.

We are a family of three. One 5 lb birds provides us, usually four meals.  After we eat on the first day i boil the carcass and make stock. Day one is leftovers. Day two is leftover creamy chicken enchiladas. Day three is chicken salad sandwiches and finally, day four is Zuppa Tuscano with Italian toast.

I made this chicken for company and everyone enjoyed it. I've never cooked a good chicken before but am really trying to learn how to cook better and this recipe was a good start. My chicken was a little bigger than 3lbs and I tried increasing the cooking time to 1h30 but ended up keeping it in for about 2h. I'm saving this recipe to my recipe box for next time.

Unbelieveably fantastic and sooo easy!  I am not a good cook and only tried this recipe because it had such good reviews.  It is everything the description says it is and, yes, people do go silent when eating it.  I have even pondered the possibility of cooking two of these for Thanksgiving or Christmas instead of a turkey.

This recipe was great!  My girls are super picky, but they loved this chicken.  It was juicy and came out beautifully roasted.  I didn't change a thing.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

I made this recipe almost exactly as it was posted. I used garlic powder as I had no onion powder, and real butter instead of margarine. I surrounded the chicken with sweet potato, broccoli, and onion. Cooked uncovered for the hr and 15 plus an extra 10 minutes covered for my bird to be finished. Turned out deliciously moist with yummy roasted veggies!!

I used this recipe using my NuWave oven, man it was seasoned, juicy, tender, all that. simple. will use again. Now I can cut the rest up for Open face chicken sandwich, Chicken A la king. I also made some pan gravy with drippings and it was on, now to prop feet up and watch a movie.

I made this the other night with homeade stuffing, mashed potatos, gravy and green beans...and it was a HUGE hit... I followed the recipe and a few reviews.. Placed marg under the skin and added lemon pepper seasoning.  I used Adobo instead of and powders. I did 15 minutes to start at 450 degrees then right before it was done I hit it again at 450 to get it crispy.  I think letting it sit under the foil tent is where most of the magic happens.  I invited my friend to eat over and she started eating and said my dinner was so good she could make love to it...lol.  She also said the chicken was much better then what you can get at the store and pay $5 for said she would pay $20.00 for this one all day long.  I gave some to the neighbor she said that chicken was HELLOFA-- I said what does that mean she said  good.  This is a keeper and I am so glad I found this recipe!

This is how I roast my chicken each time...easy and keeps it moist!  Always roast it breast side down.  I like to use a few more spices/seasonings than it calls for.  Never disappointed.

I pretty much followed the recipe except used more seasoning with some added garlic powder.  I also tossed in some carrot cut in strips and parsnips cut in strips with onions.  The vegetables actually tasted better then the chicken.  Next time I will season under the skin.  We take off the skin to eat it and the meat had little flavor.  I also basted the recipe during the cooking process.  The vegetables came out very flavorful and caramelized.  I will play around with the recipe to make it a five star.  Definitely would try it again.

This is the BOMB !  My husband does'nt like baked chicken, trust me I've tried MANY, MANY different way's. We had it for dinner last night, not only did he ask for second's, he asked that I send it in his lunch today!  Then to beat all, he's asked that I make this one of our regular's ! Any of you with extremly picky eater's have got to try this one.  I did follow some of the other's comment's. I did'nt have onion powder, so I minced a small onion, I also minced 3 large cloves of garlic.  Then I stuffed the outside seasoning & the butter under the skin.  I also basted every 15 minutes. This recipe is fantastic as is, but also many options to play with different seasonings. I can't wait to try using lemon peper.  Thank's so much for sharing this!

This was super good! There was leftover meat on the chicken, so I made a soup with it the next day. I used the extra meat, gravy drippings for the broth, leftover potatoes, and the celery, as well. Next time I will skim the butter fat off the top before heating. Great recipe! I am definitely making this again.

Wow home run. Very tasty and easy. Must try. 
I took the advice of other and added cut up potatoes and carrots for the last 45 minutes making a full meal. They soaked in the flavours too. I had to cook it for 1:45 and the meat was tender and fell off the bone.

My husband said this was the juiciest and best tasting chicken i have ever made! It was so easy to eat it just melted in your mouth. Sooo good. I had a 6lb roast instead but turned out just fine. Will make this for the coming holidays.

I tried this recipe because of the rave reviews and we were not dissapointed!!  I didn't have celery so I used what I did have: fresh dill weed.  I made sure to salt the chicken under the skin as well as inside the cavity.  The chicken came out moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.

I made this Chicken for dinner this evening, and I have to say it's the best Roast Chicken I've ever made! 

Thank you ROBINROCKINGBIRD for sharing this with us, it's rare that my wife helps herself to seconds.

The only thing I did different from the recipe is to substitute salt for Garlic salt.

Cooking time was bang on with this. I double checked with my thermometer, and it was great. Chicken came out wonderfully moist with a ton of flavor. I was a little worried about cooking it uncovered, but it came out beautifully crispy! 

I added a few other seasonings to the outside of the chicken, but the base recipe for this one is sound. :)

Recipe exactly as written: 5+ stars!!  After doing it the first time, my husband asked: "How come we never did this before?"  lol.  Now, I've come up with my own and added onions with the celery (to stuff the chicken cavity after salt and pepper).... Occasionally, I rub curry powder along with salt and pepper for a different flavour.  Everyone I've ever served this for always enjoyed it.
Tip: Since we brine turkeys for the holiday, I thought, why not brine chicken too?  Oh my!  You must try this too!  It makes takes the recipe from a 5+ star to a 10+ star!! :)

This is so easy and comes out perfectly. Only substitution  i use is coconut oil instead of margarine because of allergies. Thank you for a great recipe!

My first roast chicken and it was delicious! Thank you. I did tweak it a bit but only because I was trying to use up what I already had on-hand. Butter instead of margarine, and threw in half an onion and a half of lemon. I seasoned with garlic salt and pepper and a dash of Herbes de Provence inside. The end product came out juicy, with a crispy skin on top and about 3/4 inch of liquid on the bottom - it made an awesome gravy. I put the chicken up on two onion slices as I'd read in a cpl reviews, but he slid off at some point. Definitely be sure to season to your taste preference and don't forget the onion powder (or garlic salt) on the inside! The house smelled delicious as this roasted. I had a chicken that was just over 4lbs and added an extra 35mins to the oven time- came out perfectly. I'm going to try this recipe as written next time. Thanks again!

This lives up to the hype.  It truly is the juiciest roast chicken I've ever made.  I believe the real secret is the standing time under foil along with the basting.  The amount of butter is disgraceful and I won't use so much next time.  Thanks for sharing this lesson.

This recipe absolutely lives up to it's claims! Incredibly simple as far as ingredients and method and it IS the juciest chicken I've ever had. It will be my basic method for many different variations of chicken recipes!

Wow, this is the first time I ever made roasted chicken because it always seemed so complex, but it is seriously one of the easiest meals I've ever made!!  This recipe is delicious as is, but I added some lemon and garlic to the cavity along with the celery.  My chicken came out super moist and tender and we are putting this on our regular dinner menu from now on!!  I did have to increase the baking time on mine though because mine was still a little pink around the bones when I baked it for the stated 1 hr 15 minutes.  I needed at least 1 hr 30 min with my oven.  I also like to use the leftover carcass for chicken broth.  This is the meal that just keeps on giving!

This is similar to a recipe I've used with consistent, awesome results.  The chicken is always juicy!  Brine it with a brining recipe of your choice if you have time, and it will be even more tasty & juicy!  I always season the bird inside and out with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Then I put a medium peeled & quartered onion, several whole peeled cloves of garlic, celery, carrots, and rosemary in the cavity as well.  Adding the fresh veggies & herbs amps up the flavor.  (If you like spicy, add some whole jalepenos!) Always test with a thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh and breast to make sure it has reached a safe internal temp of 180.

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this recipe was, but I was absolutely shocked by how wonderful the chicken tasted! Better and much cheaper than a rotisserie chicken. Who'd have guessed it was this simple?

Very good, very juicy chicken. Basic ingredients but it makes a very tasty chicken. I used a meat thermometer  and pulled it when it reached 180.  Make this tonight, you won't regret it.

The recipe is true to its name- juicy. First time I've done a roasted chicken and it came out with crispy skin so the family loved it. Along with the celery and butter, I used Italian seasoning under and over the skin. Including cut vegetables halfway through the cooking time makes a complete meal. I placed the chicken on top of cut onion rings then added carrots, parsnips and zucchini later.

Although the chicken was juicy, it was too much butter (or margarine, like the recipe calls for) - just too much fat.  I tried this because I didn't get around to brining my bird.  Lesson learned.  Make the time to brine.

The chicken was awesome! I too used the combination of the two. I didn't use the drippings for the gravy, because there was a strong lemon flavor. I will cut back on the lemon next time. I never rate anything, but i had to rate this. My husband and I will eat this again.

I did add paprika to my rub, and lemon and onion in the cavity...but to those saying it wasn't cooked thoroughly, I would say I have never had luck with roasts/whole poultry cooking times.  A recipe is a general guess...Want to be sure it's cooked?  Use a meat thermometer.  I use one with a probe in the center of the breast, temperature set to 160 on monitor outside the oven.  When it beeps, it's done!

I make this every time I buy a chicken.  It's simple and there is never anything left for the next day.  This is the way my Yiayia made it too, except she would scrub the chicken down with salt for about 30 minutes and then season.  I do the same as Yiayia, just not as long.  All my kids eat it and the 5 year old is very, very picky.

There is something special about the flavors in this simple recipe. I used fresh finely chopped onion instead of the powder and butter instead of margarine. The breast is so moist using this method. The amount of butter did seem unnecessary; maybe I'll try less next time.

I've roasted many a chicken and must say this simple recipe made a perfect chicken for us. I used a 4 lb chicken and still followed her directions exactly. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. And this is what I learned from it:
1. I'd always basted, basting a chicken may leave the skin soft rather than crispy. 
2. And I'd always spread herbed butter beneath the surface of the skin (which I never enjoyed doing in the first place) and I think perhaps pulling the skin away in that manner may leave the meat vulnerable to drying out.
The onion powder creates a nice fragrant chicken, though some may like garlic powder or the like.
I highly recommend.

I had my teenage son make this while I was at work.  My other son made a salad.  We had it with some pasta, and all of us agreed it was terrific!  Easy and tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Definitely juicy! Like many other reviewers, I thought the ingredient list was way too simple to yield such glowing reviews. And, like many other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised. I used half butter, half margarine, because that's what I had in my refrigerator. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Cook time was a bit longer for me, but not substantially. The drippings made delicious gravy. I may use less margarine and swap in some garlic powder for the onion powder next time, but this recipe is definitely a keeper and one that I can add to my kids' list of dinners they can help prepare. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe last year for Christmas Eve dinner. It was so EASY and tasted FANTASTIC!! Let me first say...the onion powder scared me. I HATE onions. But, I pulled up my big girl panties and followed the recipe as written. EVERYONE loved it, including me. It smelled so good while baking, and just fell off the bone when we went to eat it. Today is 12/24/2012...and you guessed it, we are making this again. It is our new tradition. Something different from "ham and/or turkey."

OMG, I just made this chicken and not only was it sooo juicy, but it was so flavorful.  I stuffed my chicken with a whole garlic clove, carrots and onion (all found in my refrigerator) in addition to the butter.  My kids told me I have to make this more often.  Very good and simple recipe.

Perfect!!  I had a 4 lb. chicken, but except for the cooking time (about 2 hours for me), I followed the instructions exactly.  I only wish that the recipe specified exactly how much salt, and whether the bird should be breast side up or down (I did the former, but next time--and there will be a next time!-- I'll try the latter).

In any case, the chicken was very succulent, tender and juicy as the writer promises.  

I also made Ina Garten's gravy with the trimmings.  WIN!!

So tasty and delicious! Best way I have found to cook a bird! I didn't have any celery, onion powder or margarine, so I substituted celery salt, onion flakes and butter respectively. My husband kept asking me how I cooked it; he just couldn't believe how moist it was!

I added a bit more celery, a half an onion, and a bulb of garlic. Also I sprinkled it with nutmeg and a bit of allspice and used butter instead of margarine. I was very pleased with the results. This will be the way I make roast chicken from now on.

My Changes: Cut up a lemon to stuff along with the celery, used real butter instead of margarine, sprinkled just a little garlic salt on outside with the onion powder.
Came out delicious!!

Chicken came out amazing!!  I rubbed the chicken with some olive oil and then rubbed it with a mixture of paprika, onion salt, and garlic salt.  Skin was crispy and so tasty.  Took a little longer than the hour and 15 minutes, but all in all a great recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I would, however, use less margarine next time, probably half the amount. I was surprised at how just a few simple ingredients work together to make such a yummy roasted chicken. Thanks!

This was really good.  Very moist.   Mine took longer to cook probably because it was 4 pounds.  I took it out at 170 degrees.

Very true, the celery makes the chicken very moist.  For our family it was too plain.  We added marjoram and extra seasoning.

I've made this more times than I can count, and it's come out perfectly every time.  Lends itself well to whatever seasonings you prefer - lemon slices, rosemary, whatever you like to use.  Easy, fun to make, and good for my self esteem, since the family always tells me I'm a great cook when I make this.

Best roast chicken ever! I have tried several times to make a roast chicken but they are always complicated and come out wrong. Not this one. Easiest prep and BEST tasting. So moist! I had a 5lb chx and cooked it on 375 for 1 hour and 40 min and it came out perfect. Thank you for this recipe!

This chicken was amazing!  I will definitely be making it again and again!!  I didn't have a large roasting pan so I just bought a large chicken breast (with bone and skin) and roasted it.  I also added a touch of garlic and thyme (as others had suggested combining the moist garlic chicken recipe).  I didn't add any lemon, but may try that in the future.  This chicken was super moist and extremely flavorful.  It was already late in the evening, so I didn't do the last step (covering with foil and letting it rest for 30 minutes), and it was still great!

Wonderful recipe, easy and very moist. My family of very picky boys couldn't get enough and my husband said he preferred this over turkey at Thanksgiving. Great recipe!!!

Amazing.  Juiciest, most flavourful chicken ever - and made the BEST gravy.  Making it today for the second time - but this time I added lemon slices and 3 garlic cloves in the cavity.  This will be a regular in our house!

Very moist and tasty.  I made as written but I did put some of the butter under the skin.  Also my chicken was bigger so I had to cook it a bit longer but it was good.

I love this recipe.  I coated the chicken with paprika to give it a nice brown color.  I also put all the seasonings with added garlic powder outside and inside the chicken cavity to give it extra flavor.  This is an excellent recipe for juicy baked/roasted chicken.

Will definitely cook this again, but I think the cook time is off.  We had to cook it close to 2 hours.  But the end result was delicious and moist, with the meat just falling off the bone.  Very easy recipe, too.

Moist and falling off the bone. I smashed fresh garlic into the softened butter before spreading it everywhere (very hard to spread butter on a cold chicken). Similar to the way I cook my turkey. Could still stand a little more flavor in my opinion. Presentation was gorgeous.

Great recipe! I didn't have onion powder so I used chopped dry onion flakes and it still came out great. I also added some carrots to the chicken along with the celery. Very yummy!

Made this for dinner tonight, following the recipe as is, with the addition of some roasted baby carrots, potatoes, celery, and a quartered onion to serve alongside.I thought it was very moist, and had a nice taste. I only wish my chicken skin had been a little crispier. It was a bit soft. My husband loved it, and my kids ate it up! My 3 year old even had seconds. Very good recipe overall, will make again!

Really easy to do, very juicy...  I've had to "experiment" a bit to get the seasoning just the way my family likes it, but it's definitely a recipe that is in the regular rotation now!

Tried this 'recipe' last night... found that 1:15 wasn't quite enough time for the bird to reach the desired doneness.  I baked it another 20-25 minutes at 450, and it finished nicely.

Really nothing special to this one,  just a regular roast bird.

Absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe...simple, few ingrediants and tasty.  Chicken was very moist.  My chicken was 6 lbs so, I doubled everything except the butter.  The bigger chicken required about 30 minutes more cooking time so I did baste it a couple  times during cooking.  Thanks for a good old easy recipe!

It was ok..  I followed the recipe except that I put potatoes in the pan.  I've made other roasted chickens with more flavor.  A good recipe for someone just starting out.

Granted, I didn't use a thermometer to test the internal temp, but my bird (on the relatively small side) was NOT done after 1h 30m baking plus an hour or so of "resting".

very juicy but too much onion flavor for us. next time I'll use the same amount of butter but maybe just season with salt, pepper, rosemary, and some garlic powder.

I'm quite shocked at the stellar reviews this has gotten.  I followed the recipe completely and my chicken came out "just okay."  I would not rate this a 5 star that's for sure.  It wasn't bad, just not that great.  It was juicy, but not any juicier than any other chicken I've made.  And I really was not all the impressed with the seasonings...they were fine, but personally I like a little more pizazz to my chicken.   The onion powder, salt and pepper are as boring as they sound.

definitely needs longer cooking time, like 2hrs and 15 mins at this temp or you can start off on a higher temp like at 400F for 45 mins and then take it down to 350F for 45mins. plus the cool down at 30mins.
it works for me every time and I get a lovely tender roasted chicken, yummmmmers :D

made it exactly as per receipe, however i didnt have onion powder , so i finely chopped half a red onion and used same. true to ur words, it was the most juiciest chicken ever, and my freinds loved it...had no idea just celery adds so much flavor to the chicken, roasted beautifuly. i did add up soem paprika to give a bit of savory flavor to it. LOVED THIS RECEIPE, so easy and true to natural flavors.

My first ever whole roast chicken and it turned out well! I did the suggested combination recipe and the flavor was spot on. My biggest worry was a dry bird and it was not a problem at all. The only thing that I was trying to figure out was how to get more color and crisp on the skin. Any suggestions or tips?

This recipe was great. Very juicy and moist like it says it will be. I roasted mine with carrots, green beans, onions, and potatoes in the pan. The chicken gave them a great flavor. I also THOUGHT I had onion powder but was mistaken. So I was forced to improvise and used a ton of different seasonings I thought woudl be delicious. It turned out great. No complaints!

I used the drippings to make gravy with a little poultry seasoning and pepper to taste and it was so great!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be using it often.

Very very delicious! I followed the recipe and came out with a tender, yummy chicken, the whole  family loved it. Carrots, mashed potatoes, cheese noodles, strawberry jello with bananas and a roasted chicken. It wasn't extremely flavorful but still very satisfying.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I also combined the Garlic chicken recipe - only to the extend of using the parchment paper.  Wow, that made cleanup a breeze!  I did onion and garlic powder inside and out, used real butter, and Tony's Cajun seasoning on the outside.  I wasn't sure how much the chicken weighed, and I didn't have a meat thermometer so I winged it (no pun intended) - I probably cooked it too long, but it was still moist and delicous!  I'll never oven roast any other way!!

Change nothing - cook this exactly as the author wrote it and you will love this recipe.  This is so simple and it is absolutely amazing.  I think the celery may be the trick that keeps this bird so moist.  Nothing is more elegant for dinner than a roasted chicken - I cannot wait to spring this on my house guests.  A keeper.

This recipe was SO simple, I didn't know if it could actually be as good as everyone said- but it WAS!  It was wonderful and juicy.  I followed someone's reccomendation and used Garlic salt and Dried Rosemary.  FANTASTIC!!  My entire family (3 PICKY kids & husband) LOVED it.  Thank you!

sorry, just not very impressive. Spices on the chicken were very bland. While I suppose the celery inside the bird helps keep it moist, a can of beer inside the cavity serves the same purpose, and kicks up the flavor a notch or two, especially when you add 2 TBSP of Emeril's essence spice into the beer (pour out 1/4 cup of the beer first, to keep it from boiling over).

I liked this better than hubby did.  It was moist but I think I may have cooked it a little too long because it wasn't as moist as it could have been.  Made for nice leftovers during the week!

So simple...so good. I usually like things more seasoned or spicy, but left this recipe alone for my wife's sake and we both liked this very much just the way it is.

I used this recipe the first time I roasted a chicken.  I now make this on a regular basis.  I add garlic and use real butter but keep everything else the same.  This is a foolproof recipe - comes out super juicy every time!  Thanks for sharing!

Well, the chicken tasted really nice and juicy when it finally was done cooking, we had to keep putting it back in the oven because either the temp wasn't up to 180 or the popper hadn't come up yet but after that, it was really good.

Absolutely delicious!  I made it the first time exactly as written and it came out wonderful, but I've never been a fan of margarine (always thought the stuff was fake).  So the next time I cut it out, left out the celery, and instead sprinkled celery seed on the top of the bird.  It was still as juicy as ever and the celery seed gave the juices a nice flavor, so much so that I thought my husband would drink it straight out of the dish!

This is so yummy.  I will cut butter in half next time...swam in butter.  Yummy but not needed.  Also add some garlic.   Great smell, great taste.

This is the best roasted chicken I've ever had. I added lemon and onion to the cavity and used half and half of onion powder and garlic powder.

The best chicken I have ever roasted. It was so juicy it squirt on my shirt when I cut into it.   A tip is to keep it moist with olive oil by spraying some on every 20 min or so.

I made this for our family's Thanksgiving lunch (we're not big turkey fans).. my first time EVER roasting a chicken much less for a big holiday.. and it was so DELICIOUS!!!!  My family was very impressed and my dad who is very picky said the spices were really pleasing to him. I can't remember what all I added but definitely onion and garlic powder, maybe some thyme. I stuffed it with quartered lemons and spices and brushed an herb/butter mixture on top in addition to the dollops placed all around. I also turned it breast side up for the last hour and it gave it an all-around nice golden brown color. The meat was soo tender and buttery! I don't remember the last time I had chicken that good. I wish the skin was maybe a little bit crispier like the way my mom makes it but that is just a preference. Also, I threw the giblets and pan drippings in with some flour and chicken stock -- it made an amazingly thick, rich gravy that I absolutely devoured!!! Way better than the packet stuff. Thank you for making me a star cook at my first attempt!!!!! I am just thrilled with this recipe!

Really tasty and really juicy. I did not use any celery, but it didn't even matter. It's really difficult to find whole turkeys where I live, so I used this recipe for my Thanksgiving Chicken. : ) It helped make my first thanksgiving with my husband memorable. Thanks for the recipe!

This has always turned out so good, every time, no fail. This is a no fail chicken recipe. When I don't have celery, i use onions or apples or both, still comes out juicy, i have used different spices some from dizzy pig and all the time this turnes out great, don't use any fluid in pan, once chicken is done, i deglaze the pan and scrap up all the crispy bits with white wine or red and put in a tablespoon of flour and make a wonderful tastey gravy. Been a chef for a long time and this is a tried and true recipe!

I made this the other night and it was very good.  I rubbed butter, salt, pepper & garlic powder on & under the skin.  i used cut up celery, an onion & some red potatoes along side the chicken in the pan.  I used a 5lb bird so i adjusted time as needed.  Very good the next day-i used leftovers to make quesadillas.  Thanks!

I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 onion in the cavity. I substituted 1 TBS butter total, instead of margarine. This was the most delicious and juicy chicken I have ever had! My boyfriend also agreed and said it was incredible!!

This is the best recipe for moist chicken I have every tried. It worked so well I did our Thanksgiving turkey using this method. It was the most moist turkey we have ever had. Everyone raved how good it was. Thanks for a wonderful recipe on cooking chicken as well as other poultry.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I tried it this week for the first time...it was so easy to prepare and came out juicy and flavorful (definitely not the way I'm used to eating baked chicken!).  I served it with roasted butternut squash and brown rice made with chicken broth.  My whole family, including a very fussy 4 year old, loved it! Thanks for the recipe, ROBINROCKINGBIRD!

i made a seasoned rub with garlic, seasoning salt, poutlry seasoning, italian seasoning and onion powder and rubbed the whole chicken inside and out. I then stuffed my chicken with whole celery stalks, large chunks of carrot and large wedges of onion.. I halved the amount of butter this recipe called for and it still turned out very tasty and juicy! Thanks for sharing.

This is a GREAT recipe for a classic roasted chicken without any unusual flavors. ALL of my children (7, 4 and 15 months) ate everything on their plates and asked for seconds. The only change I made was to cut the butter in half. It was VERY juicy and succulent without it. Also, I quartered some potatoes and tossed them around the pan to cook along with the bird...delicious.

This recipe is unbelievably good. We have a local restaurant nearby that is famous for its chicken. My boyfriend and I both agree that this is even better than their recipe. I did cook it for an extra 35 minutes as my chicken's internal temp was only 160 after the specified time. Did not alter anything else. I'm going to serve it with a side of rotini and Prego. Can't wait to make stock with the remnantts. Thank you very much for sharing this.

I love this recipe made exactly as the recipe states.  But I also like customizing it.  Today, per my sister's counseling, I added pountry bouquet (fresh herbs) chopped up finely and then put under the skin along with butter (prefer that over margarine).  It smells like Thanksgiving in my kitchen.  Thanks so much to ROBINROCKINGBIRD for sharing.  :-)

Not that this recipe needs more positive reviews, but this was a HUGE hit in our house. I used to buy rotisserie chicken but my fiance insists this is 100% better than store-bought!! And cheaper! :)   I do use real butter, and I find that it takes a little longer than 1 hr 15 mins to cook it, usually it's in the oven for almost 2 hours.

The chicken was good, but nothing special. It tasted exactly like it sounds, a chicken roasted with salt and pepper.

I'm a vegetarian so I didn't eat this chicken myself, but I used the recipe to make two chickens for my family for Thansgiving and everyone seemed very impressed! It definitely fell right off the bones, and it's true about everyone going silent! I asked if it was good and no one answered... at first I thought it was a no but then when someone noticed I was waiting for a reply I got a "mmmYa" lol! The three meat eaters almost completely devoured both chickens, so it must have been good.

The best chicken ever!  I have tried a hundred different ways of cooking whole chickens hoping to get one to be juicy like the rotisserie chickens you buy at the store.  This is the only recipe that I've made that gives you juicy chicken.  So yummy!

I've put celery and whole onions inside my chicken and turkeys for years. Hubby doesn't like the stuffing inside the bird, and then the experts started saying it was bad for you because it never cooked all the way through. Try an orange cut in quarters, even better.

This was wonderful! I changed it a little by adding a halved onion, 2 jumbo cloves of garlic, with the celery to the cavity along with the margarine. I sprinkled the top with about 1/2 Tbs of rosemary. It took a little longer to get the core temp up to 180 degrees but it was very juicy. I served it with roasted potatoes, carrots, onion, and brussell sprouts. I also made a country pepper gravy

Very juicy, nice crispy skin. I also put some of the butter under the skin as well.  I will add more seasoning next time - some rosemary, more salt.  Great recipe and very easy.

SO GOOD.  Best, juiciest chicken I've ever had!  I didn't think I liked chicken until I made this recipe.  If you're alone, save half of the chicken for chicken salad the next day!  You won't regret it :)

This is easy, simple, and cheap yet it's a very good bird.  I think there are other flavor combinations that I prefer more, but this is still an outstanding recipe especially when you're short on time and other ingredients.

I substituted the celery with the follow: About 1/2 cup fresh chopped green onions, About 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, About 1/3 cup thoroughly chopped fresh ginger, I stuffed the inside of the chicken with this herb mix and rubbed any leftover all over the outside of the chicken. The dinner guests ate everything! Excellent recipe! I will definitely be doing this again and again. Thank you!

This recipe is like others have already stated...fabulous!  I added garlic powder along with onion powder because my family loves garlic.  Otherwise I left the recipe alone.  My bird was a little bigger so it took two hours, but with the thermometer there was no guess work.  Incredibly juicy!!

Very delicious!  My house smelled so good while it was baking I could hardly stand it.  In addition to recipe listed I added a couple of cloves of garlic to cavity and a few pieces of lemon.  I also put slices of onion under the bird to keep it from sticking.  Chicken was super tender and juicy.  Made fabulous gravy from pan juices and the stock I made the next day was excellent!!!  I followed cooking times listed for 3 pd bird.

Thanks for this easy recipe.  It's the only one I use, tastes just like the roasters you buy at the store.  Makes a great stock, too!

Absolutely delicioius, and super juicy!  I used light butter, as well as a combination of onion power and garlic powder.  I omitted the celery, and instead added potatoes and italian seasoned diced tomatoes to the pan, which were amazing after soaking up the juices from the chicken.   Can't wait to make again!

Cooked by the recipe with the addition of adding a bit of paprika on top(mainly for color). This was so good, maybe the best roast chicken I've ever had.

Easy cooking method, thanks for sharing! Nice and juicy, but I expected a more flavorful chicken. Maybe I will try it with garlic next time to perk it up.

Wow! My husband is very picky with his chicken. I made a few roasted chicken recipes but tends to be on the drier side after cooking. But this recipe is really GOOD! Simple yet so juicy. I added garlic powder and used about 2 tablespoon of butter. I will try to cut up dark meat next time since that's my hubby's fav! Thank you for sharing!

This was my first time making a whole roast chicken and this recipe was perfect! I used a specialty seasoning salt instead of the salt, pepper and onion powder and it was great!

Based on how tender the chicken was I would rate it a 5.  It was also fairly easy to make and everyone really liked it. I am giving it a 4, because I think it is an awful lot of butter! And, most of it just sits on the bottom. I also thought I used a pretty large pan, but butter still managed to get out of the pan and burn to the oven. (Use a stable pan with fairly high sides). I did cook it an extra 15 minutes and most of it was cooked, but their was still some pink liquid when cutting.  So a full 30 minutes extra might be needed! 
This is a good recipe if you have a chicken you need to roast.  But, with the cost to buy a fresh rotisserie, costing and tasting the same pretty much, I would probably only make again if I just happen to have a whole chicken to bake.

This chicken was so good!  I loved the skin!  My chicken was much larger, so I cooked it a lot longer, but it was so tender and moist!  Great recipe with very few ingredients and very little cleanup!

Excellent! Amazed that such simple ingredients could result in such a fabulous meal! I used 2 chickens stuffed with celery, onion, butter and garlic. Roasted uncovered for just under 2 hours basting quite frequently in the last half hour. Also added some chicken broth to the bottom of the pan before throwing in the oven. Will make over and over again!

I thought it was alright. The skin was wonderful, but the meat was a little on the bland side. Hubby and daughter both liked it though, so it earns the 4 stars :)

This is phenominal! I went one step further with the celery and cut the root end off, washed it well, covered it with salt & pepper and cut it in half and inserted it in the cavity! Great way to use the end of the celery!

very good.  I did not have any celery so I used half of an onion instead. Then I covered the inside and outside with onion powder, celery seed, salt and pepper.  Used margarine.

I gotta confess. I really *really* wanted to follow this recipe to the letter, but I ran into a problem: my grocery store was out of chickens! After a long bit of thought looking at the sorely lacking poultry shelves, I decided on a little (okay, not so little) tray of thighs. I liberally salted, peppered and onion powdered both sides of the thighs, laid them skin-side up on a broiler pan and proceeded with the directions. (I did skip the butter or butter-substitute products and the celery altogether given my predicament, and went with the original cooking time as the thighs were slightly frozen when I started.) I cooked to 180 degrees (took exactly an hour) and turned off the oven. 30 minutes later, I had the best-tasting thighs I'd ever had. I had set out on this journey to have a roasted chicken to use to make soup. I settled on thighs because I prefer dark meat. I ate only one of these jewels as is and will use the rest for the soup, but I have little doubt that I'll be revisiting this recipe again soon. Thanks for the amazing technique!

I combined this recipe with the Bacon Roasted Chicken recipe, and stuffed an apple and onion inside with just water in the pan. Amazing. I was planning on what to do the next day with the leftovers, only there were none. Was too juicy and tasty to stop eating.

Loved this recipe! The meat came out very moist and flavorful.  I did everything according to the recipe, except I used butter instead of margarine.  Since I used butter I lessened the amount to just over 1/4 cup.

Delish! The first time I made this recipe I followed the directions 100% and it was great!!!! This time I added a couple of garlic cloves to the chicken cavity, and cut back a bit on the butter(I know the recipe doesn't call for butter,per say, but I LOVE BUTTER), and it was fantastic as well:)

I am stuck in the Blizzard of 2010 in Maryland and had stocked up my fridge before the storm. Luckily I had decided to get a roaster because it came out perfect.I made this Roasted Chicken yesterday for Sunday dinner. Very simple to prepare, juicy and delicious. I seasoned mine with Rotisserie seasoning. I was even able to make delicious chicken sandwiches with the leftover meat along with some carmelized onions, cheese, sliced tomatoes and bacon bits on bread spread with mayo grilled in a pan with butter just like you would do a grilled cheese sandwich. PERFECTAMENTE!!! Thanks for sharing.

This was very, very good but I must recommend a rack in your roasting pan because I baked this with potatoes that turned into greasy mush. Most unpleasant! But no complaints about the chicken!

So juicy and yummy! I made this recipe EXACTLY as is and it turned out wonderfully juicy, not undercooked or overcooked at all! The skin was also crispy and delicious! Served with roasted brussels sprouts and honey roasted potatoes - a wonderful meal for my week's theme ("roasting")!

honestly...I can't put into words how good this was! i had an awful day and wanted some comfort food, but did not feel like making a huge hassle out of cooking...this recipe was PERFECT. I made it just as the recipe said, except threw some onion in the cavity along with the celery. I got baste happy with it (mostly because it smelled so good i wanted to keep looking at it!) and it had a perfect browned skin! I bet the gravy made with this is delicious, but honestly you don't need gravy because it is that moist! I will never make roast chicken differently...your grandma is an angel!

We had this for dinner tonight and it came out AMAZING!  I didn't cut out about three or so pads of butter and cooked it just a tad longer as I had a slightly larger bird than the recipe calls for but it all still came out great.  I can't wait to make it again!

This chicken was delish. I added garlic cloves.   The only problem was butter was alittle burnt, but over all it came out great.

This is mine & my family's FAVORITE roast chicken recipe. I make it about once every couple months, never varying from the recipe & it turns out perfect every time! We even prefer it over the rotisserie chickens down at the local grocery store! I have served this now at a couple dinner parties & always have rave reviews! Thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful yummy recipe!

This is the BEST roast chicken I've ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I let it sit for a half hour.  That is the key.  It is the moistest, tastiest, not to mention easiest chicken ever.  Delish!  Thank you Robin!

This IS simple and delicious.  Of course I altered it, but only a little: I put half an onion in the cavity along w/ the celery. And I used butter.  It's perfect.

My husband loved this recipe.  The only difference was I put the Margarine under the skin of the chicken and didn't use onion powder but found some chicken/fish seasonnig.  We're making it again tonight and put the seasoning in the butter and some rosemary in the cavity as well.  Can't wait!

This was excellent and simple.  I followed the directions with one exception.  I used butter instead of margerine and put the butter slices under the skin.  My husband wanted a sandwich with the leftovers for lunch today.  This one is a keeper.

I also looked at this recipe and thought "whats the big deal" but it turned out very flavorful and def a keeper. I made a brine and soaked the chicken in it for a few hours and then followed the recipe as written. I also stuffed the cavity with half a quarter onion. This came out tender and moist and oh so good. Def try this one but do make a brine to soak the bird. Thanx for sharing.

I made this chicken for xmas and it was sooo juicy and great!!  Very tasty.  I did alter the seasoning but what I believe made all the difference was the butter.  This chicken was no ordinary baked chicken, it was tender, juicy and got lots of ooow and ahhhs.  I will be making this again, but only for Holidays :-) because of all that darn butter!

This is my tried and true roast chicken recipe. I added chicken broth to the pan the first time I made it to assure it stayed moist, but since then I haven't and it's just as juicy. Perfect every time.

I have made this twice and loved it both times. No changes are necessary even though for me (and apparently some of you) it's torture not getting to add my personal culinary flourish. I leave you with this: I like to stick half a lemon in the bird.

I made this chicken for my uncles this summer.  I followed it to the letter.  Amazing!  It was so easy and they absolutely raved about it.  The bones were picked completely clean by the end of dinner!  Awesome recipe!

This was OK.  It was juicy but also very oily.  I found I had to leave it in almost 2 hrs to cook it fully.

One of the best roasted chicken dinners I have ever made or tasted. I added 1 cup of white wine to the bottom of the roasting pan and  some fresh sprigs of thyme. Was wonderful with steamed green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Will make for years to come!

Very tasty! I used 1 tbsp butter in cavity and 1 tbsp on top. I put 2 crushed garlic cloves and a sprig of rosemary in the cavity. I put 1 sprig of rosemary, stalk of celery and a quartered onion in the roasting pan with water to stop them from burning.  If your chicken has a "slimy bottom" as someone had mentioned, use a rack in your roaster, which I did or buy air chilled chickens VS water chilled since they have no added water.

I also quartered and onion and stuffed that plus the celery inside the cavity.  I didn't have onion powder so i used onion salt and garlic powder.  It turned out so good!  I will be making this again and again and again!

I substituted orange oil for the butter and slipped orange zest and minced cilantro under the breast and thigh skin.  It was gorgeous to look at, beautifully browned and tasted delicious.  We liked it with the butter but it was amazing with the orange oil!

Juicy as advertised!  Rather than using onion powder I sliced the long green stems off a bunch of green onions and stuffed the whole onions in the cavity with the celery and butter.  And I scattered the giblets around the roasting pan.  Delicious...

I put sliced garlic under the skin, used onion & garlic powder on the outside.  Next time I will add even more seasoning to increase the flavor.  The chicken was very moist & juicy, but I would have liked more flavor!

Oh my golly this was good! I misread the recipe and mixed my onion powder with my salt and pepper. When I realized my mistake, I figured what the heck and added some garlic powder too. I had a 5 pound chicken so I cooked it longer and basted with the drippings every 30 minutes. I can't believe something so simple tasted so good!

If you are out of ideas on what to cook for dinner and you have a whole chicken in the freezer, try this recipe.  Wonderful flavor and very moist!  I don't like to change a recipe and then rate it but I did add a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary to the cavity of the bird.  The aroma reminded me that Thanksgiving is only a couple of months away!  With or without the rosemary, a keeper recipe for sure.

Doesn't have much flavor and the breast meat became dry. Cooking to 180 degrees is a bit much.  I prefer about 165-170 degress taken at the thickest part of the thigh.  Next time I would add more aromatics to the cavity maybe.

My first time making this I was skeptical. With so few ingredients, how could it be so good? It was DELICIOUS! I add a few cloves of garlic, some pieces of onion inside the chicken and it turned out great! I also threw some carrots, onions and potatoes in the bottom of the roasting pan hoping for some great roasted veggies, and they turned out great! I paired this with some garlic lemon butter I found on this site, few pieces of corn on the cob and it was all delish. Best recipe I've ever made from this site. It was wonderful. Will make again for sure!

Best chicken recipe....ever. I can't even tell you how much I love this chicken. It is so juicy and so delicious. Follow the recipe exactly (at least the first time you make it) and do not add any additional seasonings. I do recommend cutting the butter by 1/3 or so because you really do not need that much for it to turn out as juicy as ever. Season it liberally, baste every 20 minutes or so, and reap the rewards of your minimal labor later. This recipe is soooo good. 10 stars!

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this recipe thinking "how could the simple ingredients for a chicken produce such a succulent dish".....so I decided to see what everyone was "raving" about. I following ingredients & directions exactly. UNBELIEVEABLE. This chicken was the BEST roasted chicken I EVER had. I am simply amazed at how wonderful and delicious this turned out. Thank you for sharing!

"Awesome" to quote my 12 yr old Daughter. I had to cook a little longer because I used a a 5 lb chick. I didn't measure anything either and put some margarine under the skin as well. This is now my roast chicken recipe.

This chicken was so good and juicy. My kids ate seconds. This was my first time making a whole chicken and it was so easy. UPDATE: I have made this so many times and the best flavor I have made so far was lemon pepper. It's so good every time. My husband loved it!!

Fabulous chicken!  It's hard to believe that a recipe with such few ingredients could be this good.  I used to think making a whole chicken would be difficult - this is the easiest recipe ever!!!

I brined it as some suggested, put it on a roast pan rack. It had onions and carrots inside. I didn't have celery. I did add mushrooms too but they shrivel up so don't bother. It just wasn't "to die for" chicken for me but still good.

So easy and SOOO good!!  I have made this a few times.  I brined one (which is supposed to make it even more juicy) and i dont think it really made that much of a difference. This chicken is already super moist. Try it, i promise you wont be let down.

All I have to say is WOW. My husband hates Roasted Chicken, and this recipe he could not get enough of. My 4 year old son, I normally have to MAKE eat his meat,but this chicken was gone in an instant! Stuck VERY close to recipe, and it turned out beautifully done, great color, moist, and most of all, awesome flavor. Will definitely be making this again! Thanks alot for sharing!

This is so incredibly easy and tastes fantastic. I also sprinkle liberally with celery salt inside and out and add a little garlic powder. Delicious.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe.  Not only does the chicken come out moist and delicious but it is so easy to prepare.  Takes about 10 minutes to prepare it and 2 hours in the oven to roast it.  The chicken comes out golden brown and melts in your mouth.  The drippings make a delicious gravy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  So good you can serve it to your guests!!  Thanks!

This was the best roasted chicken I have EVER had.  It was so moist and tender. I could not believe it.  My picky husband who ONLY eats dark meat because it's moist, actually ate a chicken breast and talked about how moist it was.  LOVED IT and followed the recipe word for word.  Will def. make it again.

I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time I used butter, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I couldn't believe how good my first roasted chicken  tasted!  Of course I never leave well enough alone and the second time I added several sliced cloves of garlic to the cavity and under the skin of the breast and again the chicken was amazing (My husband and I love garlic and I add it to just about everything).  Thank you for making me confident that I can roast a moist, flavorful chicken too!  And it was so easy for a beginner cook such as myself

Haven't "tried" this recipe yet, although I've done this for years with my Thanksgiving Day turkeys and they always comes out juicy, never dry. Also, must cook breast-side down. Looks weird but it makes all the difference! Funny to see "my" turkey recipe used for chicken but it's all poultry so, of course, it would work!

I'd give this recipe 4 stars without my adjustments. First of all, I stuffed the cavity with carrots and onions along with celery. Also, we used real butter and a lot more onion powder than called for. Instead of putting the butter on the outside of the chicken, we put it underneath the skin. We used a probe thermometer during cooking and the chicken took longer than stated to reach 180 degrees F. Overall, this recipe was very good and we will definitely make it again.

This is full of flavor! It's great to be able to bake something so good with such little effort.I bake this every week. I save the drippings and use to flavor the side dishes made to accompany the chicken. Our favorite is to boil egg noodles and add some of the drippings with a little milk with cornstarch. The broth will flavor the egg noodles so no other seasoning is needed. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was worried about all the margarine so I used a lighter stick kind I buy and it was great so juicy but then I have never had much problem with birds drying out. My only reason for 4 stars is the bird didn't have much taste so the nexy time I made it I did what I always do fill the cavity with garlic oranges and lemons with the light spread and it was wonderful.

I have made this chicken many, many times. My husband and I live alone and this makes enough for our dinner with leftovers for lunch the next day. I follow the recipe pretty much. I place the chicken in a large roasting pan so I had lots of space around the chicken for vegetables. I add sliced potatoes, baby carrots, squash, bell peppers and onion. It makes a one pan meal. About halfway thru baking I baste with some chicken broth to keep the veggies moist. The left overs can also be used for chicken salad. Mmmmm, So good!

It was okay like any other roasted chicken I have made. I followed the recipe to a "T" but didn't experience the moment of "silence" from my family.

This was great. Simple, easy, and delicious. The white meat really does come out moist- I couldn't believe it. Rubbed the chicken down with a smashed clove of garlic (which got thrown into the bird with the celery and stuff) because we love garlic in our house and pretty much use it in everything; other than that one tiny change, followed the recipe to a T. Which means I went out and bought margarine instead of using butter. Next time I'm making 2 birds at a time so we can make soup or chicken salad or something afterward- there wasn't much meat left with one bird because everyone had seconds.

Excellent and very easy. I baked 2 chickens in a covered roasting pan and took off the lid the last 20 min. Very moist and very easy. I made these for Easter Dinner and they presented well and my family enjoyed.

Omg! I will always use this recipe. I added about a cup of water though to the bottom of the pan. And I didn't have celery so skipped it but overall it still was delicious. My husband loved the crispy skin. yum!

It really turned out juicy!  I had my doubts but it really worked.  The flavor was fantastic.  The skin looked so dry when I took it out of the over.  The final step of basting it and letting it sit was the key to the excellent result.  I will use this technique from now on!

I don't know why this works, but it just does! I made it as directed the first time because I think that's the only fair way to rate. Loved it! Then made it my own- brine with herbs and garlic overnight, then roast with extra herbs and spices as preferred. Excellent and a family favorite!

I didn't change anything. It was very easy, and moist. I'm known for my chicken-drying talent, so this is great for me. I didn't give it five stars because it is basically tasteless. I'd say some garlic or something would help. I will definitely make this again. Oh, and the skin was very crispy on mine.

I made this chicken exactly as the recipe stated and it was amazing! The most juicy chicken I've ever seen. Even the leftover white meat is still incredibly moist and tender. This is my new go-to chicken recipe!

This was probably the fastest, easiest oven roasted chicken I have ever made.  The only reason why it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was expecting a crispy skin.  Mine browned, but definately wasn't what I was expecting.  Tasted great.  Ran out of onion powder and substituted minced dried onion.  Tasted amazing still!  Next time I'll add a twig of rosemary inside with the celery!  Good recipe!

This was much easier than any roasted chicken I've made before ~ and turned out SO tasty! I followed the recipe, except for cutting back on the salt, for health reasons.

This recipe is so simple & easy.  The chicken came out perfectly and SO juicy.  The only changes I made were using butter and adding an onion to the cavity w/ the celery.  This one is a keeper!

Very juicy and delicious! Easy to make and kids love it! I made 2 at the same time being we have a large family and I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours. I used 1/2 stick butter on the inside and 1/2 stick butter on the outside of each chicken. I am really glad I found this recipe. Nice change of pace for us. Try using your left over chicken in chicken salad.. VERY GOOD!! YUMMMM! Thank you for sharing!

Very good, simple and very moist even the next day. I did as another said and put the butter between the skin and meat. Everything else the same.

I'll say four because I had a few problems with it,well,my son flat out didn't like it. And really the breast part got done but not the legs,I left it on for the hour and 15 minutes like it says to but I don't know,maybe the temp should be higher.

It was good, but wasn't the best. I followed the recipe exactly and we enjoyed the chicken just like any other which was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a really juicy, extra special skin type chicken. I think my expectations were too high. Over all, it is a good recipe and I'll try it again.

Such an easy recipe and the chicken comes out great! I did use butter instead of margarine and placed cut up carrots, pumpkin and potatoes in the pan around the chicken to roast as well.  After all was cooked I removed the chicken & veggies to a serving tray and used the drippings to make gravy.  The whole dinner was delish!!!

This was just okay. Yes, it did come out nice and juicy but it did not have enough flavor. Next time I will stuff it with the celery and use the butter and onion salt but add some other spices like garlic and rosemary.

This was the basis for my first roasted Chicken.  Good recipe. I did use lemon and onion and Rosemary seasoning on it.   The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I didn't follow the recipe to the "T" the first time.

Excellent, tasty and easy!  I thought the dark meat was delicious, and usually only eat white.  I didn't alter the recipe, other than to rub the butter under the skin.

Very good, basic recipe!  The skin tasted excellent with the seasoning and the meat was juicy, but we wished it had a little bit more flavor.  Very easy, though, and probably will make again.

The best roast chicken I've ever made. I used butter in lieu of margarine.

Fabulous....moist .....juicy.....tasty.  What can I say.  This is the only way I will roast a chicken in the future.  I do love onions though so will add some to the next chicken I roast.  Oh...I used a free range chicken...so that always lends an exceptional flavor to the recipe.

DELICIOUS! This is officially my favorite go-to chicken recipe. I place the chicken breast-side down so it stays even juicier. I do not measure the onion powder - I sprinkle it liberally all over. I do not include celery due to personal taste preferences. You will not be disappointed! Thanks for sharing.

I've made this twice now. It is like magic! Everyone who's eaten it has engaged in a long discussion on how it's done and why it works--great table conversations! I served it last night with smittenkitchen.com's Spring Panzanella. Excellent recipe, thank you!

I'm sorry, I just didn't care for this.  It may have been that my chicken was too large and had too much tendons, etc. But I've made other, better chickens.

This was just OK for us. Mine took a lot longer to cook and wasn't as juicy or flavorful as I expected. It was very greasy.

I really can't say enough about how easy, tasty and JUICY this chicken is!! Due to lacking ingredients in my pantry I did make some minor changes.  I substituted garlic powder for the onion powder and also placed some chopped onion in the cavity w/ the celery.  I also used unsalted butter rather than margarine, some of which I also placed up under the skin. To my whole families delight this was the best and juiciest chicken we have ever eaten!!  To be certain it is much better than any store bought broasted chicken!!! Only thing I would change is using all the wonderful drippings to make gravy and serve w/ mashed potatoes next time!! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!!

My husband said this is the best chicken he's eaten in his life (48 years)! Next time I'm going to add some crushed garlic & lemon zest to the butter. I put the butter in the cavity, between the skin & breast and rubbed the remainder over the legs - I should have taken a photo it looked so good.

This was my first time roasting a whole chicken.  This was awesome... so moist and falling apart! I did add garlic and onion to the mix of things along with the salt and pepper to taste (inside and out).  Rock on and THANK YOU... can't wait to make this for my father and his wife when they come to visit my husband and son in our new home... what a way to impress him!!  Thanks again!

It's true! Very JUICY! It's common for the breast of the chicken to come out a bit dry, but with this recipe...no more dry white meat leftover!  Thank you for a fabulously easy and tasty chicken!

Very juicy.  I roasted with the breast down until the last 15 minutes.  Could use seasoning under the skin but very moist and tender.

I am a HORRIBLE cook and just recently started making edible items.  Not only did my boyfriend absolutely love this chicken (I did it exactly as in the recipe), he also took a picture of it and showed his mother!  Wooohooo!  Points for me!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe 2 nights ago my son raved about it. The only thing I changed was butter instead of margarine and only half the amount. Follow the recipe exactly and listen to the compliments!  The soup stock from the leftovers is the best I ever made. Thank you so much to the person who posted this. Donna in Calgary

What a wonderful roasted chicken! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. For those of you who said this chicken was bland, read the recipe...it states, "season generously". In doing so you will not have a bland roasted chicken. Next time I will try other seasonings.

This was a really simple and delicious recipe.  A great place to start with roasted chicken.  It is the technique not the seasonongs that make this an excellent recipe.  What my husband and I liked was it became 3 meals.  Day 1 we had roasted chicken dinner with all the trimmings.  Day 2 chicken fajitas.  And day 3 bean soup.I boiled the rest of the chicken: bones and all, until all loosened off the bone.  Pulled all the bones out, added the celery out of the rib cage, and the gravy. Best bean soup we have ever had!

This was awesome. I also made a change or two...had no onion powder so used a whole onion plus minced garlic. My partner doesn't usually like cold white meat but she said this was still so moist she really enjoyed it. I will make this again for sure. Saved the drippings for a chicken gravy base. I know it will be good. ;)

This is outstanding! Who knew something so simple could taste so good! My husband is allergic to onion and garlic powder so I put a medium onion cut in half along with several smashed garlic gloves in the cavity. I rubbed under the skin with butter, salt and pepper as others recommended.  The day I planned to make this, my husband removed the oven to make way for a new one. So I put it in a disposable pan on the grill upside down the first 30 minutes, then turned. I filled another disposable pan with baby carrots, new potatoes and quartered onions tossed in olive oil, salt & pepper. Cover the first 30 minutes and toss when you baste the chicken. It was a great meal with no clean up!! Can't wait to try this chicken in my new oven!!

Pretty tasty.  It's nothing spectacular - it didn't produce a wow factor but most of the comments were "tasty, tender chicken".  Made a nice change for us from our standard lemon, rosemary and thyme flavouring.  Another plus point is there is no marinating making it even simpler.

very good. I used real butter and it came out fine, but it did seem a little greasy. the skin was nice and crispy.

We love this chicken--very moist!  I've made it several times and it comes out great everytime.  I've even made it without the veggies and it is still great!

Impressive. This produced a very moist, very flavorful chicken. I did use garlic powder, in addition to the seasonings called for. Will use this recipe again, thank you. :)

The other reviewers are right - this is amazingly simple - and the celery makes the chicken really juicy! Very good way to roast chicken. Thanks.

Absolutely perfect!  I added a quartered sweet onion and 2 quartered lemons along with the celery.  It was definitely the best chicken I've ever made!

Wow this recipe made my mouth water when I found it.     I simply followed the recipe, and have never had such juicy, delicious chicken.  This is a great recipe for anyone.  Instead of onion powder I used italian seasons and garlic salt.

SO GOOD! I have been trying all of the different whole chicken recipes and this one if my ultimate favorite so far. However, I did make some modifications.  I added adobo seasoning and paprika  because other reviewers mentioned it didnt have that much flavor.  Instead of celery, I added mushroom and garlic with the butter in the cavity. Simply delish!

4 stars since chicken was very juicy, but I wish it had more flavor. I will spice up on my own next time.

This was SOOO easy to make. My family loved it. The chicken is very juicy. Great recipe. I used garlic salt instead of onion salt and added a few mushrooms inside the cavity. During the 30 minutes, the chicken was resting, I turned up the oven and roasted carrots and onions at 400 degrees for 30  minutes. It was a delicious meal, with mashed potates, too.

This was definately JUICY! I had a 4lb. chicken and I think I should've cooked it a little longer. I did season with Greek Seasoning and put the butter under the skin. next time I will season it more, but overall a keeper, my 6 yr. daughter was a big fan!

Like the other reviewers, I was a bit skeptical when I first looked at the ingredient list.  I thought, how could this be the best chicken ever? There is nothing even close to a "secret ingredient".  I following the recipe except used garlic salt instead of onion salt, and put 3 cloves of garlic in with the celery.  When I first saw it cooking, there wasn't much juice around the bird, and I was thinking it was going to be dry.  Boy was I wrong!  I'm not sure if the salt on the outside is what does it (by causing the bird to retain moisture, similar the effect of brining) or what, but when I cut into the chicken, it was like the floodgates opened...all the juice was inside where it should be!  It was the most tender, delicious chicken ever!  This will be a regular in my dinner menu!

I'm happy to say that my chicken came out great! This was my very first roast chicken. I used salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder to flavor it. I cooked it breast up for a while, and then turned it breast down for the duration of cooking. I served it with Jasmine rice, and used the gravy/drippings from the chicken to flavor the rice. It was delicious, and was just like the chickens my mom makes. I felt like such a grown up! :P

I had my doubts about this one, but I tried it anyway.  I had to use onion salt because I didn't have any powder and I didn't add regular salt.  It was so juicy and moist, even the breast came out juicy!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Excellent roast chicken.  I love making a whole chicken since it's cheaper than buying the parts.  I intend to use the leftovers for chicken enchiladas.

This was a great recipe and so easy who knew I changed it up just alittle by adding Rosmary and fresh minced garlic Yummy,also I cooked the chicken breast down so the white meat would absorb all the juices while cooking,, I also cook my turkey this way succulant white meat Great recipe would put my sister in law to shame (and I call her Betty Crocker)

My husband's favorite.  Simple flavorings, but it works really well.  I use real butter instead of margarine.  Next time I might try to rub the dollops of butter on the bird before I season the outside since I have a hard time getting it to go on the bird once it's covered with salt.

This was truely the juciest chicken I've had. I used butter and put it in the cavity and under the skin. I did not have celery so I put a 1/4 of an onion in the cavity. My chicken was 6lbs and took 2.25hrs.  YUM, Yum, Yummy!

This chicken was wonderful. Very juicy and very flavorful. The only things I did differently was, I put garlic powder and onion powder on my chicken, and I basted my chicken with the juices 3 times during the cooking time. Also, I cook my chicken breast side down it makes for MUCH juicer breast meat!

Way too greesy for me. I would have used less margarine and put it on a roasting rack. The flavor was ok...a bit boring for my taste but I was missing the celery.

I decided to use this recipe after doing some internet research and the chicken came out great! We adjusted the recipe slightly - we used some mixed up salt which included some garlic power and mixed pepper from penzey's spices. We also put a few pats of butter in the skin of the chicken (sim to how you prep a turkey for thanksgiving.) we also put a few shallots into the cavity along with some of the celery.) The turkey came out up super juicey and yummy. We will be sure to use this recipe again!

Sooo tender and delicious! I only had chicken thighs and I decided to add chicken broth to make gravy and it was a hit!

I don't understand how this recipe works, but it did indeed make the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  When I cut into the breast meat, juices literally poured out like the chicken had been submerged in water.  The only thing I did differently was add a little lemon pepper to the seasoning outside.  I might experiment with other seasonings as well, like blackened/cajun spice, Greek seasoning, etc.  This will definitely be the recipe I use for every roast chicken I prepare for the rest of my life.

We've made it 3 times and it is really awesome!  Just as good if not better than the rotisserie chickens we've gotten from the grocery.  We rarely have leftovers!

Wow. Outstanding! I only tried this recipe based on the reviews...like others, I didn't see the magic in the recipe.  But, it's just an amazingly juicy, delicious chicken...and so simple!  I've tried so many roast chicken recipes and techniques.  This one is now my favorite. Try it!!

Easy. Juicy.  I used a 6 lb. chicken - took 2 hrs.  Many roasted chicken recipes call for water or broth in the pan, the margarine bastes as the chicken bakes (not steams).  With the margarine drippings mixing with the chicken, it makes a great broth to cook veggies in. May be the best broccoli I've ever had.

The perfect roast chicken! This recipe is absolutely delicious. The only changes that I made were to stuff a few wedges of lemon and onion in the cavity, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This one is definitely going into our rotation, and also will be one of our meals to make for guests. Awesome recipe, thanks.

Of course, extremely good, tasty, juicy.  But so much margarine, it would be hard to mess it up.

This makes a good juicy chicken. I agree with others that more flavor helps -- I added garlic cloves and onion to the celery in the cavity. More cooking time is needed, depending on the size of the chicken (remember, this recipe is for a 3 lb. one).

This recipe was good and the flavor was definitely throughout the chicken, but it definitely could have used some extra spices.  I'd recommend looking at other suggestions and adding some extra too it.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I have never prepared a whole chicken before, but I decided to try this recipe for Christmas dinner since my 12 year old son doesn't eat ham or turkey. The only change that I made was I purchased a much larger chicken to feed my family. It turned out just as wonderful as all the reviews said it would. Tender, juicy, and very well received by my holiday guests.

The best roast chicken i have ever made! I followed the recipe to the T...next time I'll play around with it though, i think some extra veggies and spice would really set this chicken in a league of its own.

I followed the recipe exactly and the
chicken was precisely as promised...
perfect.
I have tried roasting chicken following
the directions of, to name a few, James
Beard, Julia Child, Graham Kerr ... and
the beat goes on.  Forget about 'em.
This is not only the best, it's the
simplest.
I have changed the spice rub to one more
suitable to my taste.  But this recipe
never promised "like Mama used to make"
flavor, it promised juicy roasted 
chicken.  And does it ever deliver.
Many, many thanks Robinrockingbird.

I'm a vegetarian but was cooking for meat-eating guests.  I made this recipe using cornish game hens.  All but one guest (and she asked for the rest of her's to be wraped to go) ate their entire hen and raved about how tender and juicy and tasty it was!  I was curious because the ingredients seem so simple, but wow!  It almost made me want to eat one when I heard what my guests had to say!  For 5 hens, I cooked them in a roasting pan for 1.5 hours and let them sit covered out of the oven for half an hour.

This was without a doubt the easiest and best chicken I've made. I have been searching for a good, juicy chicken recipe and this one is it! Thank you for the great recipe.

Followed recipe to the T, except I added garlic powder along with the onion powder. Very juicy, a quick read thermometer will ensure doneness along with not over cooking. As we all know chicken can sometimes be dry. Very happy with the recipe, thank you!

This recipe was soo good...as soon as I tasted it, I was ready to make another!  Unbelievably easy and the results are fantastic!  The only thing I did different was to throw some crushed garlic into the cavity along with the other stuff.

I followed this recipe except added crushed garlic in the cavity but other then that followed the recipe exactly. Wasnt that impressed. Chicken was juicy but not that flavorful. A bit bland. Also, the skin was not crispy.

Amazing how simple this recipe is and it still comes out juicy. I was surprised. I had to make a slight change because I didn't have any celery but I did have cream of celery soup and it came out good. Even for leftovers when I put it in the microwave the next day it was still juicy. I will use this recipe again. Thank you

Never cooked a whole roasted chicken before, but this recipe made it easy and it turned out GREAT!  Used the margarine, salt, and pepper.  Didn't have celery, so I used chopped baby carrots and 1/2 an onion.  Also, instead of onion powder, used a onion/garlic dry rub.  Never had such juicy and moist chicken.  Very easy to make.  My wife and I ate the entire 4 lb. chicken in 3 days!

I am rating this 5 stars because it is so stinkin' easy and the ingredients are those that most of us have on hand (generally speaking I mean I don't normally have chickens lying around).  
I did 2 chickens in a roaster (approx. 8 lbs. total) and cooked it for about 2 hours.  I followed others suggestions and was very liberal with the seasonings.  I would probably be a little more liberal with the salt next time.  I needed to salt my portion but my son and husband ate it as is.  Will make again. Thanks for at the easy recipe!

This is delicious and I actually slow cooked mine in a crock. As tasty as it is slow cooked, I'm sure it is even better roasted and can't wait to have the time to monitor it. I liberally sprinkled onion powder and salt and pepper inside and out. I also put more celery as I just filled the inner cavity. If you slow cook, put breast side down. It won't look pretty, but it will stay moister!

UPDATE- I did this properly in the oven and my husband loved it! It was so crispy and delicious. If you could do this in a rotisserie- WOW!

Made this for dinner last night, very easy to prepare.  Beware if you use larger hen then cook time will be longer.  Like many reviews I read the meat is tender and juicy however it appears to be lacking something in flavor.  I did put the celery, 4 cloves garlic and 1/2 onion inside cavity but still not quite to my taste.  Will definitely make again but maybe add some cajun spice for more flavor.

Truly an amazing chicken recipe! I added a few extra minutes, since my chicken was a little bigger in size. Also, a bit more onion powder and added a small cut onion in with the celery. TERRIFIC! The color after baking was PERFECT.  My 7yr. old devoured the chicken AND had seconds. My husband thought it was best chicken ever! RAVED about it. Definitely will be making this one again.

I am teaching my girlfriend how to cook and needed to find a foolproof recipe that would not intimidate her and that would taste great and boost her confidence. I would have not chosen this recipe if I had just looked at the ingredients, because I normally add more herbs and spices to my roast chickens, and just adding onion powder, butter, celery, salt, and pepper sounded a little dull. However, after seeing the amount of people who rated it a 5, I had to try it. I was not disappointed. It was the most delicious and most juicy roast chicken I've ever made. There is something magic in this recipe. I was tempted to add garlic powder and stuff some herbs in the cavity, but I stuck to the recipe to see if it was really THAT good. The only thing I may have done a little differently is be more liberal with my onion powder. Thank you so much for a delicious addition to my permanent recipe file!  I can't wait to make it again with my friend:-)

Very juicy but breast was bland. It could be because I was scared to leave too salty so didn't go nuts with the salt. Will do again with some adjustments in the spice dept. but all in all good chicken.

My husband and I have 6 children, so we shop the big meat sale at Reasor's every time they have it.  During the last one, they had cases of whole chickens on sale for $0.89/lb.  Though I'd never cooked a whole chicken before, it was too good of a deal to pass up.  We initially thought we'd buy a rotisserie to cook most ofthem in, until I found this recipe.  So much for the rotisserie!  I didn't change a thing, and this recipe produced the best tasting, juiciest roasted chicken I've ever eaten.  The kids love it, our friends love it, it can't be beat!

Wonderful Moist Roast Chicken.  BEST EVER! If you are not a fan of onion powder do not use it.  Next time I will use poultry seasoning or a lemon chicken spice.

This chicken was sooo... delicious!!  Only the bare bones were left at the end of the day, which was good for me because I used them to make some chicken soup, which I have to say was one of the best I've ever made!  Never let anything go to waste!

This is the best roast chicken recipe ever! My husband said he now wants to have it minimum once a week! We are garlic lovers so I ended up filling the cavity with 10 garlic cloves. I also used half butter half olive oil. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!!

My husband and I thought it was really good!  This chicken is very moist.  I did use garlic powder and a chicken seasoning on the skin and it was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not sure what the celery adds to this but the chicken was good. I would pull out a little sooner next time since the chicken will finish cooking (just 5-10 degrees) as you let it sit tented with foil. 
My only complaint was that there was so much butter on the bottom is was hard to make a true gravy. I will make again though, really very easy.

Fantastic!  The chicken was really juicy, the skin was crispy, and the meat was falling off the bone.  I used butter instead of margarine and basted the chicken every 20 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very yummy!! I followed the directions except for I put butter underneath the skin of the chicken and also rubbed some on the outside. My family gobbled it up in no time, next time I make it I will make 2 chickens instead of just one.

I am rating this 5 stars bc it is the juiciest roasted chicken! I would like to add that while it was really really juicy, I was craving more "flavor"...and thats only bc I am crazy about flavor. My husband is a meat and potato's kind of guy, and he LOVED this chicken. Next time, I would like to add thyme, rosemary, and/or garlic, and rub that into half a stick of butter and take that and rub it all around underneath the skin. This recipe will now be my staple and I'll just add to it each time to get different flavors!

Simply fabulous! I used butter instead of margarine and had to cook a bit longer due to the size of the chicken, but aside from that - no changes. This recipe is easy and delicious.

Super simple and easy, but really delicious.  It was so moist.  Yummy.  Sometimes simple is the best and you get such wonderful flavor from the meat itself.  Thanks  for the great recipe.

The magic celery made this chicken delicious and moist! No more dry chicken!  This was so easy too.  I took the advice of other reviewers and stuffed the chicken with chopped onions and garlic cloves along with the celery. Perfect!  Highly recommended.

This was absolutely the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have any celery so I used celery seed.  Also, I accidentally roasted the chicken upside down.  Don't ask me how!  My husband said it is the best roasted chicken he's ever eaten.  Delicious.

Moist! Excellent!

After reading a few reviews that stated they didn't change a thing, I gave it a try.  

Don't change a thing! This recipe is Perfection as is.  Simple, fast with no odd ingredients.

such a simple recipe, I was so surprised how juicy it turned out to be!  Instead of celery, I put a whole head of fresh garlic and a chopped onion in the cavity along with salt & pepper, rosemary and thyme and, of course, the butter.  I also rubbed some thyme and rosemary on the outside of the chicken.  SO GOOD!

Awesome chicken and my family loved it.  I had cold leftovers 3 days afterward, and the breast was still so moist!  I only had garlic powder, so I used that instead of onion powder.  I also stuffed a few cloves of smashed garlic inside the cavity and sprinkled some parsley flakes on the outside before baking.  I wonder if I can reduce the butter to only 1/3 cup, but not sacrifice the results.  Next time.

This was a wonderful recipe and so easy to prepare. DON'T CHANGE A THING!  The presentation looks like you slaved over it all day.  I served this with Roasted New Red Potatoes (recipe found on this site) and a basic dinner salad. Huge hit!

This is amazing!!! I use onions in the cavity instead of celery because I never have celery on hand. I love how it turns out! The dropping also can be used to make a wonderful gravy! I make this often. It's inexpensive and satisfying! I also use a little bit of garlic and herb seasoning and am generous with the onion powder. It's great!
