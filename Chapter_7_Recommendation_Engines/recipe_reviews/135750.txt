Great recipe although I made a couple of small changes.  Added 2 cloves of pressed garlic at end of tomatoes cooking and mixed 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 monterey jack, and used drained and squeezed canned tomatoes; 1/2 diced and 1/2 with chilies.  AWESOME!  Yeah, we licked the pan!

I really liked this recipe.  It is much better than some other cheese fondue recipes I've tried.  It is memorable and it's my fondue standby.  A keeper!

This is our favorite fondue recipe. We make it every Christmas Eve for the last 3 years, it's now a tradition in our home. I also use half of the Ranch packet, I found the whole packet is too salty.

This is a great alternative for non-drinkers. We make with milk instead of whine and it still has a great flavor. I gave 4 stars because it was too salty. To fix this problem make your own seasoning pack minus the extra salt. 

    *   1/2 cup dry buttermilk
    * 1 tablespoon dried parsley, crushed
    * 1 teaspoon dried dill weed
    * 1 teaspoon onion powder
    * 1 teaspoon dried onion flakes
    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    * 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper

Use 1 Tablespoon to replace one packet.

An excellent beginner's recipe. My only suggestion is to use less than the entire pouch of seasoning, maybe even half as much.

This recipe is fantastic! This is the first fondue recipe I have tried and I was surprised at how easy it was. I agree with the other reviewers, use less than the full pouch of ranch. I think 1/2 is about right. I also added garlic, which I think is just perfect in this recipe. I cooked it right in my electric fondue pot. No need to transfer it.
