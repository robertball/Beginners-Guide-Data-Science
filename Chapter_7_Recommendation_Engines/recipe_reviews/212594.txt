This is a great base recipe. I do usually double it, I use all milk and add a good amount of sharp cheddar cheese, garlic/onion powder, little dijon mustard and Frank's Hot Sauce. Great quick meal.

A little bit bland, but it was definitely easy and if you make it with whole grain noodles, more healthy than the powdered-box kind.

It is the easiest ever, I'll give it that. Now, the drawbacks, it had no flavor at all, it says in the description bar "made in 10 minutes" yet cooks for 20 more AFTER you add the pasta. Definitely kids friendly but IT'S NOT THE BLUE BOX. I was able doctor this up by adding in some shredded sharp cheddar cheese and some cayenne powder and after that it turned out really good. I almost gave this a 2 though as written for blah food.

I used a can of milk instead of half water.  It was better than boxed macaroni and cheese as it was a lot creamier.  I added a bit of sharp shredded cheddar (maybe 1/2 c.) but it was still pretty bland.  I gave it an extra star because it was so quick and easy and I think something could be added to give it more flavor, next time I would add some onion powder.  I think I would also try the original 1/2 milk, 1/2 water and add a cup of sharp shredded cheddar.

Definately Easy, but a bit bland.  Was trying to find a healthier version of boxed but kids and dad were disappointed
