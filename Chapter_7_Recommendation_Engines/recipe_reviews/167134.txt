These were good, quick and easy to assemble. Unfortunately, I have found it difficult to reheat after taking out of the freezer. I have had to defrost for up to 2 minutes, then heat for 45 seconds, and then have to heat the egg an additional 25 seconds for it to even be warm.  A lot of work to heat it up, but the taste is good. The tricky part is getting the whole sandwich warm without melting away all the cheese or causing the english muffin to become hard. Good luck!

I tried these and they came out perfect.  I make a ton of these on english muffins.  They reheat like a charm too.

These were great. The baked eggs can be cut to the perfect size. I had to cook my eggs a bit longer. I suggest adding salt and pepper to eggs before baking.

So many variations are possible for this recipe. This is something I made for years and would eat on the way to work. I use toasted English muffins. They have less fat and are a little more sturdy than the croissant. I bake half the amount of egg in an 11 X 7 pan and add omelet style veggies (diced onion, bell pepper, diced green chiles). I use eggbeaters. A thin slice of Canadian bacon is a nice substitute for ham slices & use 2% sliced cheese. I wrap them individually and put them in a gallon zippered storage bag to keep the freezer burn away. Take one out and let it thaw in the frig overnite. In the morning they heat a little more evenly that way.

These were SO good!!! I made them at night and wrapped them in plastic wrap, put them in the fridge and took one to work. I microwaved it at work for one minute and it was SOOO good. They must have been really good because when I came back from work to freeze a couple, they were all gone!! The eggs took a little longer than 8-10 minutes and I added salt and pepper to them. These were so easy to make I will be making them often!!!

I toast an english muffin, fry an egg, add miricle whip and american cheese. It's really good for a breakfast on the go, or any time really. Easy to make. I have made extra before and kept them in the fridge, they reheat well.

Update: Thank you everyone for your kind remarks. 

I suggest Beginiers Use English muffins or low carb buns, Toast first, then add your egg and extras! Seasoning the eggs wouldn't hurt either! My oven runs very hot so add minutes if you oven bake the eggs!  Most say oven bake the eggs for approx 20 minutes!  Wrap in parchment or wax paper then slid into a ziplock freezer bag! 

Thaw sandwich OVER NIGHT will help when reheating! 

Microwaves are different, some people may need to defrost the sandwich prior to heating for 1-2 minutes.


For some people you may need to defrost the meat and bun first then gently defrost and heat the egg separate but this process does not take much time. Much less time than making them fresh.

I'll rate this a four, because the taste was fine. I personally don't need that much egg, so I cut the egg part in half, one is fine for me. The real reason for my review is that you really need to play with your microwave to figure out if this works for you. This recipe does not work in my microwave oven. I can adjust and do the eggs on half power without the bread, and put the cheese on later, but that doesn't work with my morning - I need something that I can nuke and go. so I have a freezer full of these, which I have been taking out on Satursday mornings, dissasembling, heating and eating. Every microwave oven is different, so that's not anything against this recipe, just a little dissapointing :(

Made these for my DH last week.  He said they reheated pretty well.  They reheated in ~3 minutes.  I used sour dough English muffins & sharp cheddar cheese.  I scaled it to 4 sandwiches: 8 eggs in an 8x8" pan with diced peppers and onions.  They baked in ~18 minutes.  I've got 2 left and will make some more...  Thanks Dee!

Very Good!  I had no problem reheating them.  I put them in the microwave on defrost for 1 minute and then 2 minutes on a high setting.  Came out perfect!

These were easy to make however when I heated them they took longer to heat through and they soggy.  I am going to try making them on English Muffins or Bagels and see how that works. Disappointed want something I can get ready fast in the morning.  Boopsie

I made these yesterday, froze them, and reheated them just now.  They are really good. I did change it up first I added salt and pepper to the eggs. I used English muffins and American cheese. Also I used sausage patties not ham although I can't wait to try the ham. I also just made the eggs in a pan and scrambled them because I was making them for breakfast and just decided to try these sandwiches. I only had 2 problems and they came from the eggs so I don't think if I bake the eggs next time I will have these problems. The first problem is the eggs didn't stay on the sandwich and the second is some of the eggs are still cold after heating them up. I still love this idea. Thanx so much!!
Update: I have now made these a few times and I tried the ham and baked the eggs and they are great. I also made them using bagels and they are great that way also. This is a really great recipe that you can make using whatever you like. My 14 month old likes to eat just the baked egg. I will cut her a small square and she just holds it and eats it. I made an entire pan of eggs just for her and froze them and reheat them in the morning for her breakfast it's so fast and easy. I really love this recipe it's helped me so much.

This is PERFECT! What a time saver and so delicious. My oldest boy is 16 and it's important to me to make him a hot breakfast before school each morning. That's my special time with him. I thought I would try this one weekend, and boy, what a huge hit in our house. Not to mention a huge time saver. Love, love, love this!

UGH! This is the worst thing I've eaten in a long time and that's saying a lot since I try new recipes every week.  Made it exactly as directed and it came out a soggy and ugly mess.  Now I've got 5 additional sandwiches in my freezer that will have to be thrown out.  Do not recommend this recipe at all.

Loved these!  I messed up the eggs by cooking them in too small a pan and ended up stirring them to get them to cook properly.  They turned out fine, but would be better in the bigger pan so they can be cut up nicely to fit the buns.  I also seasoned the eggs.  Next time I don't think I'll butter the croissants because they're buttery enough on their own.  Really enjoyed the Colby Jack cheese on these, it gave them a good flavor but other cheeses would work just as well.  I do thaw them in the fridge overnight to help with cooking them in the morning.  I've used the microwave and toaster oven and they turn out fine either way.  Hubby loved these too.  Thanks for sharing!

I was excited to make this recipe, but they were just too soggy.  I wasted a lot of money on these.  I tripled the batch!  Our whole family was really disappointed.  The plan was to have the kids grab to eat before school.   I will try to make them again, but serve immediately.

Wonderful recipe. To avoid the sogginess of the reheated sandwich after freezing, I baked the eggs (I'd do at 325 degrees next time), cut them into individual portions and froze them individually wrapped in plastic wrap.  In the morning, reheat the egg in the microwave while toasting the muffin, bagel, or croissant. Your choice to add what meat, cheese, or spread you like. Not quite grab and go, but still fast, tasty, and fresh with minimal mess and still quicker than a drive-through. And depending what you keep on hand for fixings, everyone can have their sandwich to order.

A super morning "grab and go" breakfast. The reheating wasn't a problem.  I switched out the ham,replaced it with a slice of prosciutto and a slice of Genova salami. Used a slice of pepperjack and a slice of provolone cheese. Its a lot better than going thru McD's on the way to work!

These are delicious. I made two batches. The first with toasted English muffins, ham and Kraft American singles. I seasoned the eggs with salt, pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  To toast the English muffins I split a dozen of them and toasted them under the broiler on a baking sheet. I thought they turned out excellent, though I did have to cook the eggs for about 16-18 minutes and not 8-10 minutes as indicated in the recipe. For the 2nd batch I used Pillsbury home-style biscuits and to the raw eggs I added a pound of browned, drained and cooled Jimmy Dean sage sausage and then baked the egg/sausage mix for about 15 minutes.  Then I assembled them with a square of sausagy egg, a Kraft American single and the biscuit. Also delicious! I prefer the English muffin version, though.

Use a biscuit cutter or rim of a glass to cut rounds to fit in English muffins. Cheese/ham can be cut that way too

This was great and will definitely replace the ones I had been buying.  I used egg beaters and egg whites, and put it on bagel thins, which worked great. I did have to cook the egg beater mix a bit longer to get it to set. I tried sausage and deli ham but deli ham definitely defrosted and tasted better. Next I'm going to try adding different veggies and things. Thanks for sharing this!

These made a nice size breakfast sandwich.  I also had to cook the eggs longer for them to set.  I felt the proportion of eggs was too thick for a croissant sandwich (though probably good for an English muffin).  If I make them again I will use 3-4 fewer eggs.  I haven't eaten them yet.  I will move them from freezer to fridge the night before and they can thaw more if needed on my hour commute to work.  So I don't expect to have issues heating them.  I marked the recipe down one star for the cost, I didn't find it a frugal recipe.  But they are definitely handy and it was nice to choose the ingredients myself.

I have made these for years using both English muffins and croissants.  For people having problems/complaints about reheating, I suggest they check out some of the ready made breakfast sandwiches (which cost 2 or 3 times as much)with reheating instructions where you must separate the sandwich and warm up in several steps as other reviewers have done.  I use a  large round cookie cutter for English muffin sandwiches w/Canadian bacon instead of ham and eat the left over egg while putting everything together. Thanks for sharing this time saving idea Donna.

This recipe came out great! I used English muffins and bacon. But, as another user said...endless variations! I will keep my freezer stocked with these for my teen boys, they rarely stop for breakfast.

This recipe is a great starting point.  For those who have problems with the egg, freeze the  croisant w cheese and meat loosely so you can easily separate and toast in the toaster oven.  I then simply crack an egg in a small salad bowl the size of the sandwich with a spray of no stick oil.  Scramble egg with fork a couple of times and microwave for a minute.  Stir a little with a fork to move the cooked egg toward the center and finish with another 30 secs.  Voila!  Fresh toasted sandwich with fresh scrambled egg! Note that microwaves vary a lot in power and you will need to find the right amount of time, but once you do, it's easy and relatively quick!  You can also select whether you prefer you egg still slightly loose or hard set with this method.

a little bit on the bland side but still pretty good. 10 min was no where near enough time though, had to cook the eggs for almost 20 minutes.  I made two batches and with the second I added some milk in with the eggs, made it a little lighter and fluffier.

Perfecto! Did not use butter or ham, just egg and bacon. Yummy! Family loved them and very easy breakfast on the go.

WAY too fat! Croissants are already full or butter, and to add more is juste ridiculous. AND makes the reheated croissant chewy.

These are great.  However, when I froze them and reheated them in the microwave the egg part took so much longer to reheat than the bread and cheese.  I recommend that you just refrigerate them and eat them before they go bad.

Pretty good.  Very hearty--almost too so!  But definitely taking care of hunger in the morning, that's for sure.  I made these slightly different because my 9x13 pan was in use at the time, so I used 2 8x8 pans to make the eggs.  The eggs took more like 20-25 minutes to bake  (the pan with the mushrooms needed 25 min; the other needed 20 min).  I added red pepper, salt, pepper, and parsley to both pans and sliced mushrooms to one (bf likes mushrooms & I don't).  A 9x13 pan might've worked differently, but the pieces in my 8x8 pans were just too huge to cut in 3rds, so I cut in 4ths instead and made 8 croissant sandwiches.  So that we could eat some for breakfast this morning, I buttered and put on the eggs, meat, and cheese as written but then put 3 of the sandwiches (2 for bf, one for me) on a cookie sheet, leaving the top off the cheese so it would melt & placing next to the loaded pieces so that it would get warm as well.  Then, I baked for an additional 10 minutes for the cheese to melt and served with strawberries.  Very good and hearty.  The remaining six sandwiches I wrapped up and placed in the freezer for weekday mornings.  Thanks for the recipe!

Taste great freshly made, but they get too soggy when reheated; and the egg is incredibly difficult to reheat to a decent temp.

So easy to put together and have ready in the freezer for an on the go breakfast.  I used English Muffins and just white American cheese, and they were super yummy!!  My 3 year old can't get enough of them and he loves to help make them too.

Please NEVER microwave anything in plastic wrap or baggies..

This sandwich is a good timesaver. I use sausage patties and sliced cheese. I prefer to put the egg on after warming the cheese and bread.. I microwave a few on a plate for a short time then sit them in the large pan while frying the eggs. They are less soggy that way.

I made these one at a time in my breakfast sandwich machine. Left cheese off of mine because I don't care for it. The combinations are almost endless for this. Kids loved them and I'll make again.

Thank you for such a wonderful idea. With 8 hens we're always looking for ways to use eggs. This is an easy recipe and make ahead is an A+++++++
Thank you soo much.

I made two variations of this, one with english muffins and one with croissants, and the english muffins came out way better.  The croissants taste great, but after freezing it the bread becomes soggy after putting it in the microwave.  every sunday i make this with english muffin so my husband and i have something to eat in the mornings when we are rushing to go to work.  thanks for the recipe!!

Great time saving idea!  However, I use wax paper or damp paper towels, not plastic wrap in microwave to save leaching of chemicals in plastic wrap and plastic traps moisture so some things get tough. Croissants are not good in the microwave, they get tough.  English muffin is better.  Use low fat ham, Egg Beaters, for healthier version.

I'm sure the egg croissants are delicious.  My concern is that heating them in plastic wrap in the microwave is a big no-no.  Plastic wrap should never be used in the microwave or any plastic for that matter.  It can be toxic.

I followed this recipe exactly. I wanted this to work.  This is a good plan if you need to make a bunch of sandwhiches and eat them the same day BUT these are aweful soggy if you freeze them and then reheat. To salvage i microwave the egg, ham and cheese, which left a watery mess and then I toasted the bread so that it did not get soggy.

Cut the recipe in half for our 3-person family; baked in pie dish for the smaller portion. Eggs took longer to cook, but result was very tasty. Used pre-cooked turkey sausage. 

Easy weekend treat with leftovers for the week!

Absolutely no changes to the original recipe. I did, after freezing them and preparing to heat the frozen sandwiches, I had some jalapeño peppers standing by so when it was time to consume, I simply added the pepper slices and VERY happily proceeded to eat my sandwich! GREAT!

I made it and it took more like 15-20 min at 350 degrees.  (granted eggs were not at room temperature, but recipe didn't say to bring to room temp).  Pretty boring, and odd texture if you're used to traditional eggs on the stove top.

These are so good! And I love having these ready to go for a quick snack for my son and of course breakfast on the go. I haven’t figured out yet how to reheat them properly though. For me I’ve found that I need to defrost the egg part first and then add it back to the sandwich then heat it all together for about 45 seconds or so. Thank you for the recipe!

I love the idea of these, but the reheating process doesn’t go well.  They’re thick sandwiches is you use slices of ham that are pre-made for breakfast sandwiches, so the cheese is blisteringly melted while the middle is still cold.  And I found the whole thing too greasy (we ended up using forks to eat them). They do smell heavenly though!

I am always interested in trying a recipe I can make and then freeze to eat at my convenience. Usually a recipe with 12 eggs would be past over because I am only cooking for me. This recipe is great. Not only is it a convenience to have breakfast in a matter of minutes, but is so good!

Forgot to add sausage and mushrooms to the egg mixture. Would still use the ham also which would make it a 5 star rating.

Really, for me it was a total flop.  I don't know what I did wrong but it was a limp watery croissant with cardboard filling when I reheated it after freezing and I heated it far less time than the recommended 1-2 minutes.  Oh well - I had high hopes and it looked really good up until I took it out of the freezer and microwaved it.

Excellent recipe. I did not change anything  from the ingredients. Got rave reviews from my mom and hubby! Very easy to make and will make these often as quick meals for those busy work days with some salad on the side.

I made this with crescent dough sheets and added ground sausage to my egg mixture topped with American cheese. This came out great! This will become a staple in my freezer now. Thank you so much.

I gave it an "ok" review because freshly made they were delicious, but frozen and reheated...well, let's just say not so much.

These are fantastic! I made a batch for Sunday breakfast & wrapped the extras up for my 14 year old son to grab before school. (Or as a good afternoon snack!)They are hearty, satisfying and even better the second day - highly recommend!!

This was very good! I'm not a croissant fan, so I made it with english  muffins and used sausage patty instead of ham.  The possibilities are almost endless - will definitely make again!

I put some fresh spinach, dill, pepper and a little sea salt in the eggs. Then I wrapped the eggs, ham and cheese in foil and  reheated those in a microwave safe dish and put it on a toasted english muffin or croissant. Much better than reheating the bread along with them. The bread comes out too soggy and chewy in the microwave. Still very quick and easy.

I have made these myself, except for making my scrambled eggs in a frying pan. You can even add onion powder, green onions, & cheese to the eggs or anything you like. 
BUT, you should NOT microwave anything wrapped in plastic. It can cause cancer, & the harmful stuff in plastic goes into your food. Try parchment paper or paper towels. Google the harmful effects of using plastic wrap on food in the microwave please.

I have some advice for those who are having trouble with the microwaving part of this recipe. You can make these ahead and freeze them, then pull out what you need the night before (or earlier, if they aren't defrosted enough by morning) and put in the fridge for use the following day. The idea is to have a longer storage life than the couple days you could keep them in the fridge alone by freezing...you get a month or so depending on how you package them. If this doesn't appeal to you, an alternative is to freeze the ingredients separately, then nuke and assemble.

Great recipe!  I made the following changes as I'm always looking for ways to eat healthier.  I used 9 jumbo eggs and only used the yolks from 3. I added 1 pound of Turkey Sausage and sauteed half a Vidalia onion along with the sausage.  Delish!!  I subbed English muffins as they are much lower in fat.  Make sure you add salt and pepper, I love Restaurant pepper to your eggs prior to baking.  My boyfriend, who really has a tough time making himself eat breakfast, loves these.  My second batch is in the oven!

Using english muffins are good (sturdier and lower in calories.)  I use an egg ring to cook the egg which keeps it in the perfect shape for the muffins.

Hate to give a bad review, but this just didn't work for us. 1 star for versatility and flexibility of the recipe. Made as written, but perhaps baked eggs just isn't for us. 9x13 pan used for baking the eggs...took about 15 minutes to cook the eggs in the oven. End result...egg portions were too thin and an odd texture. I don't mind baked eggs, but the texture from this recipe was weird for me. Formed and froze the sandwiches using english muffins (per the author's review notes) and used canadian bacon. First sandwich was inedible for me--just wanted to peel off the egg and have the canadian bacon~n~cheese in an english muffin. Hubs tried one bite and chucked it. Remaining frozen sandwiches were chucked. I like the idea of the recipe, but would recommend using a smaller baking dish or even making fluffy omelets--cut into portions and freeze the sandwiches. Sorry, this just didn't work for us.

Meh...nothing special just a ham, egg and cheese crossaint. This doesn't even really require a receipie. I would say this is for kids/beginners who don't know how to  make anything.

Made as directed, but used bacon instead of ham.  I will have to say they are quick to grab while going out the door to work!  And you can make as many as you need - next time I will probably only make half as many.  The last few were a little rubbery for the egg part once I heated them up.  So I think I will halve the recipe and only make six next time....may actually try the ham too!
