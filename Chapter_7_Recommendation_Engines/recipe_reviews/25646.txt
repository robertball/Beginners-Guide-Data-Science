All jambalaya is by definition "one dish" so I'm not sure why the recipe has it in the title. I would be willing to bet that the inventor of this dish is not from Louisiana. Instant rice? Canned soup? No spices? This was awful. Definitely NOT authentic jambalaya. Much too bland, artificial tasting, and overly salty because of the soup.

Very quick, easy, and tasty. I added some Tabasco sauce for a little more kick.

I made this because it was quick.  I prefer the Oven Baked Jambalaya that is in this recipe database.  It was a bit salty and need a dash of hot sauce to kick it up a bit.

I understand the idea is to try and make a quick version of a slow cooked dish, but I didn't care for this.  There was no spice or kick to it, and the flavor profile was way off.

This gets 5 stars for being very easy. I left out the peas since my son doesn't like them and used chorizo sausage, as that's all I had available. But very good and goes together very quickly. It tastes like you spent a lot longer time making it!

This was yummy! I add crushed red chili, and used chicken broth instead of french onion soup, and also used medium salsa as the "picante sauce". I will definitely make this again!

This was nothing like any jambalaya I've ever had before, but it was still tasty and easy to make. I used Andouille sausage, and made it with brown rice. It was a touch salty due to the FO soup but it wasn't too terrible. All in all, a pretty decent meal. Thanks!

Flavors don't blend well. Everyone picked around at it. Served with brown rice which helped.

As a Louisiana native, I was intriqued by this recipe.  I of course had to make some cajun chanes to it so I added a load of tony chachere's cajun seasoning and a healthy portion of Louisiana hot sauce.  I also added celery.  This was the first Jambalaya I'd ever had with peas but it was a nice touch.

I thought this recipe had nice flavor.  I have never had jambalaya before, but as other reviewers have said, this is not an authentic recipe.  However, it was good.  I didn't add the shrimp and used salsa instead of picante sauce (what I had on hand).  Also, I didn't use instant rice.  I put the jambalaya in a bowl and put a heaping scoop of white rice on the top.

Super fast and tastes wonderful!  This has been added to the family menu.  I use regular rice instead of instant.

This was a time saving recipe and the ingredients were basic.  I know this is nothing like a traditional jambalaya were you prepare a ru carefully instead of soup, but this is still tastey.  My girlfriend was going to be home soon after she had a very very stressful day.  We loved it!

I added a few seasonings, like Cajun seasoning, salt, cayenne pepper. I also doubled the sausage and shrimp, I used the powder onion soup mix. Excellent very quick and little to no mess.

I am guessing that one of the reviewers did not even make this before reviewing.  This is a nice little recipe when time is tight.  It taste good and uses ingredience easily found in most pantries. Most importantly, you can adjust according to family taste.  I left out the shrimp (cooked them seperatly because I don't like them) and added hot sauce.  If you are offended by calling it jambalaya then call it "nice little one pan meal"

If you add Tabasco, pepper, onion, celery, green pepper, and creole seasoning it turns out pretty good for a quick easy dinner. The point to allrecipes is to give you a foundation for the dish. Maybe the person who wrote this recipe doesn't like spicy food; think when you cook and you get the dish you're looking for.
