Your recipe is excellent.  However, it’s Gravlax not Lox. ( Lox is either cold smoked or smoked not just smoke flavored). One point I would strongly suggest for any cured Salmon, DO NOT use farm raised only Wild Salmon should be cured for Gravlax. Try adding a liberal amount of fresh dill when curing.

This recipe was not only easy but delicious. After letting it sit in my refrigerator for 48 hours wrapped tight with holes at one end to let out water, I rinsed it and dipped it into water with liquid smoke just once. My husband and I couldn’t get over how delicious it is. A definite must try !!!!!!

To umax: Generally if your lox is salty, you probably used table salt rather than Kosher salt. Huge difference.

this is great! super simple and tastes great! I did keep it in the salt and sugar mixture for a longer time (by accident) and the second time I made it I used a gallon ziplock bag instead of the wrap.

I've been using this recipe for quite some time now and it just gets better with time! This time I added cracked pepper and dried dill and let cure for 3 days. The ideas for ingredients are limitless. This is excellent on bagels, open faced sandwiches to cold pasta salad. An inexpensive  alternative from store bought lox or smoked salmon, and made exactly the way you like it.

Interesting, but I'm wondering if you didn't like the smoke because it's artificial? Maybe try some real smoke?

Used this recipe without the liquid smoke. Came out delicious with saltines, sliced red onion, capers and cream cheese. Used non farm raised salmon.... fish taste came thru light and not overbearing. Easy to make and good for appetizer or bagel sandwich.

Good basic proportions for the lox of my east coast childhood, if you ignore the optional smoke flavor. Lox is not smoked, so that would make it unlike lox. Although Nova Scotia smoked salmon is sometimes called lox, to quote Epicurious, “Smoked salmon is cured or brined, then smoked. Lox is cured, but not smoked.”

Followed the recipe as directed but this came out really really salty.  It was so salty is was not edible.  Will try again but not sure how much salt I can safely take out to ensure it properly cures.
