Very easy and tasty.  I used a 9 x 13 pan and cooked it for 35 minutes.  Also sprinkled cinnamon on top for appearance and added nice flavor.  I did not have self-rising flour so I added about 1 tsp baking powder to help it rise.   The texture is great-not too hearty like an oatmeal cobbler or really thick, but nice and fluffy.

Love this recipe! It's great with a scoop of ice cream on top. Perfect just the way it is stated! Family perfered this recipe over others on this site. If you use can peaches, make sure to drain the juice, and you don't need the extra tablespoon of sugar. Thanks Lynn :)

This is the recipe lovingly referred to in my family as "cupa, cupa, cupa" because it is just a cup of self rising flour, cup of sugar, cup of milk.  You can pour it over any fruit.  If you don't have self rising flour, just use AP flour and add 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  I give it 5 stars because, given the simplicity and quickness of the recipe, it tastes great!

This is the most yummiest peach cobbler ever, not too sweet, letting the peaches be star. My family loved it.

This simple recipe is ideal for ripe peaches.  The peaches are not masked by a lot of additional ingredients, letting their wonderful, fresh peach flavor take center stage.  I made half the recipe, putting them in buttered ramekins and served with whipped cream.  Delicious.

Really easy to make! Blanching the peaches makes this recipe infinitely easier; and adding cinnamon to the sugar you sprinkle over the peaches makes this delicious recipe even better!

GREAT!  I added some cinnamon/sugar to top of peaches before cooking and some cinnamon and vanilla to the batter - YUM!  Hubby says it tastes like a fresh summer bread pudding, which he loves.  My peaches were almost overripe as well so I am sure that just added to the flavor.  I will be using this one again for sure.  Simple, easy and so so tasty.

This was marvelous and very easy. I added a bit of vanilla to the batter, and increased all of the batter ingredients 50%..so used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, flour and milk. I used a 13"x9" pan. I  also added a half pint of raspberries to the peaches...yum! The raspberries added a nice flavor and color. Delicious!!

This is so easy and delish!! I used canned peaches (as it's not peach season plus I'm lazy) I used regular flour and 1 tsp baking soda because I didn't have self-rising flour and sprinkled cinnamon on top for a better look. Both ideas from other reviewers. THANKS FOR THE RECEIPE!!! FAMILY LOVES IT!!

I've been making this my whole life! Pour about 1/4 cup lemon juice on the peaches if you are using fresh, increase the sugar to about 2 Tablespoons. If you don't have fresh use 1 can sliced peached in heavy syrup. Don't drain. Omit the extra sugar and lemon juice. Yummy!

So delicious!  I've never made peach cobbler before, but this was so good and a great way to finish up the peaches we picked at the orchard.  I mixed the tbsp of sugar with cinnamon and a bit of ground ginger before sprinkling over the peaches, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Can't wait to make it again!

I let the peaches sit in a bowl with brown sugar and white sugar for a couple of hours first. Also added a little cinnamon. Added vanilla to the batter mixture. And now it's perfect! Already made it twice in one weekend. (Takes about 6 fresh peaches) And will definitely put this in the keeper stack!!!

Such a wonderful recipe.  I used canned peaches, drained the juice off.  Sprinkled cinnamon on top of the peaches before adding batter.  Cooked it until it was browned on top.  My family of 7 loved it!

Just like my momma use to make!!! I loved it! I'm going to make it again but use other kinds of fruit in place of the peaches =)  I used extra peaches when I made it too around 6 cups I love peaches. If you use canned peaches drain all the juice off of them or your cobbler will be soupy

Super easy, and oh-so-delicious, that you'd wish you made more!  Instead of self-rising flour, which I never have in my pantry, I used 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and I always keep handy canned sliced peaches (packed in water) and drained well.... My husband and kids keep begging me to make it over and over again! It literally takes me 10 min to whip up a batch! O

I love this recipe!  It is almost identical to what my mom made when I was a kid.  It's super easy, and turns out perfectly every time.  Like others, I used a smaller dish (9x9) because we like a thicker cobbler.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg.  No other changes were made.  The crispy edges around the crust and soft gooey center chocked full of peaches makes this a great hit with family, friends, and everyone!

I made this cobbler for my daughter ‘s future in-laws. It turned out great with some people asking for seconds. The only thing I did differently was to use a 8+8 pan and added a half teaspoon of almond extract to the peaches. This is a great peach cobbler recipe and I will use it many times again!

The only thing I did was double the batter and I had to use canned peaches due to the season. I used a ripe canned peach. This was a perfect recipe!! Easy to make and delicious!

We love this recipe, and will definitely make it again.  It's far better than other peach cobblers I've tried.  I did make a couple of changes due to other reviews and what I had on hand.  I used half white peaches and half yellow because that's what I had; From experience with other cobblers being too cakey and dense, I sifted the dry ingredients before blending with liquids; from experience with soggy cobblers I added 2 tsp of cornstarch to the peaches prior to adding to the baking dish; and I sprinkled a very small amount of allspice over the peaches before adding the batter because there was so little sugar blended with the peaches and we like a small amount of spice to help bring out the flavor.  NO EXTRA SUGAR NEEDED and the allspice I added was barely a dusting.  

Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Very easy, very good.  Not too sweet, just right.  I did add cinnamon sugar to peaches before batter.  Also added vanilla to batter as other people suggested.  I did use fresh peaches since it is peach season here in Georgia.  I defitnitly will make again.

I was pleasantly surprised that this very simple recipe tasted so good!  I did sprinkle some cinnamon on top, and was glad I did, for the cobbler is slightly bland.  But the taste and texture were wonderful, and the aroma while it baked was heavenly.  I used a 9x13 pan with great results, and I also used 3 quart jars of home-canned peaches, drained.  Thanks for a great recipe.

THIS IS IT!  the perfect peach cobbler recipe.  9×9 pan, 7-9 peeled & sliced peaches, add a teaspoon of vanilla to cake batter, some cinnamon sugar to tops of peaches and also top of batter.  my husband, who isn't a gushing complimenter, said i5 was exactly what he'd wanted and to write the recipe down so we could use it with ALL the fruits.  Thank you!!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed. It tasted very flour-y. I will not make this cobbler again.

Very simple. I blanched the peaches. Family loved it and made the house smell delicious. I wasn't sure about the cakey part though, I wanted some crumbles.

I used this recipe to make my very first cobbler. It was amazing! I only adjusted it slightly by adding fresh blueberries and a couple dashes of powdered cloves and cinnamon. Huge hit with my husband and kids. Thank you for sharing. This recipe is a definite keeper:)

I loved how quick and easy this recipe was.  Taste was great!  Crust could have had more crisp texture for my preference, but family enjoyed it.  I added cinnamon by sprinkling on top of peaches along with sugar.  Will make again.

This was so easy and delicious!  Since we have a small family I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8 in. square pan for the same amount of time.  It was a huge hit with even my pickiest eater!

Exactly the way my Aunt Carol makes all of her fruit cobblers! It's especially great with peaches, blackberries or blueberries. I add vanilla extract to the batter and sprinkle the top with cinnamon before baking. This is a yummy, quick and no fuss recipe. I'm going to try adding ginger to the batter next time I make this with peaches!

This recipe is amazing! I substituted Trader Joe's cinnamon sugar for the sprinkling of sugar on top of the peaches. My family was disappointed when it was gone!

This is just like the recipe that has been passed down in our family from my great X 3 grandmother! The only difference is the butter is put into the pan and melted in the oven so that the dish is hot when the "batter" is poured in and it gets scalded, and no sugar sprinkled over the peaches. The peaches are dropped in (or poured with the juice if using canned). Love this recipe!

Used this recipe with blackberries and later on with peaches.  It is very easy and the cobblers were terrific. I do add 1 teaspoon vanilla to the batter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top. I sent my best friend this recipe and she's made it several times, the latest with apples.  I prefer a cake-like cobbler so this will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I make Peach Cobbler that is almost identical except I add a beaten egg to the mixture and only use 3/4 cup of sugar(I don't like my too sweet), also I add a little bit of cinnamon to top along with a sprinkle of sugar.  If using canned peaches in heavy syrup you can cut the sugar a little more, but with fresh peaches you might want to slice and sugar the peaches before you put into the pie so you can be sure they are sweet enough. It's a hit everywhere I take it and never any to bring home, my husband hates that part.

Good flavor, but the cobbler part had a strange, sort of gummy consistency. It could have been the old oven, but even cooking it an extra 25 minutes didn't do much to improve the consistency.

6.30.19  This actually is more like a dump cake rather than a cobbler, except you’re using fresh peaches (instead of canned) and mixing up your batter (rather than using a box of cake mix).  And that’s not to say that it’s not good because it is.  Followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the sugar in half because I knew for us that would just be too sweet.  Certainly was easy enough to make, and I know every single bite will be finished off!

This cobbler is the most delicious homemade cobbler have ever had! I used apples instead of peaches because they were in season and peaches were not. It came out perfectly. I increased the amount of fruit from 4 to 6 cups. Next time I need to also increase the amount of dough. Even though the amount of dough was minimal, it was delicious and the whole thing was eaten by my family. This is a wonderful recipe, simple and delicious, definitely worth giving it a try.

I made this today- EXCELLENT!!!!!! I loved this simple recipe- similar to one that I have used in the past. The only change I made ( remembering my old recipe that I cannot find ) was that I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter- then instead of adding the butter to the batter I placed it in an ungreased 9x11 dish and placed it in the oven- while the oven was pre heating ( you have to be very careful and watch - so you don't burn the butter) . After butter is completely melted pour prepared batter straight into butter and then place your fruit on top of batter- during the cooking process the fruit will sink and batter will be on top-
Thank you so much for sharing your incredible  recipe!!!!!

I would prefer to have a more homemade or store bought dough. This dough did rise all around the peaches but I found it too be to "Doughy"  and too much dough. It didn't turn out with a golden brown, crispy crust.  We also preferred adding butter, brown sugar and cinnamon and sauteing this with the peaches before adding it to the baking dish.

This my go to recipe for peach cobbler. I like a thick crust so i use a small square baking dish. I put cinnamon on the peaches and in the batter. Also, i put about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract in the batter. This is the best peach cobbler I have ever made.

The directions call for an 11 x17 pan, which I thought was an odd size - others said they used a 9 x 13 which is what I used.  It ended up very thin - tasted fine but after I thought about it, it probably should have been an 11 x 7" pan.  The texture would have been a little better.  I will make it again and use the correct size pan.  I sprinkled nutmeg on top before baking

I made this pretty much as written but did a few different things suggested by other reviewers.  I  used 2 cans of sliced peaches, drained. Then I sprinkled some cinnamon before adding the batter, which I added 1 1/2 tsps vanilla to.  I  put it all in a 10" round, 1 3/4" deep baking dish.  After adding batter I sprinkled the entire top with sugar then some cinnamon.   It took an hour to bake but came out fabulous and my husband absolutely loved it!   The top was golden brown with a nice sugar crisp crust. This is definitely going to be a regular in our house!

I used 2 cans of peach pie filling. I added only 2/3 cup of sugar to flour mixture and skipped the butter (on accident). Turned out great! Will be making this again!

SO GOOD!! 
Obviously not your flaky crust like I've had before, but this is so delicious and simple. I took others advice and added a dash of cinnamon! Also used a big can of peaches and it was still very tasty! Will definitely make again!

I had tried a couple of peach cobbler recipes and didn't really like them. It wasn't what I was expecting in a cobbler. I tried this cobbler and it was EVERYTHING I wanted and expected to have in a good cobbler. I love love this recipe and have made it over and over. Will keep this in my recipe box...what a keeper!!! Oh and it tasted divine so divine. Loved it.

I used a 9x9 pan, 1   29 oz can peaches, and added 1/2 cup loose packed brown sugar. Have made several times now and it turned out amazing. Never any left over.

I made this for my dad, and when I served him a dish of it topped with vanilla ice cream, he told me there was too much in the bowl. He finished every bite of it though, and kept saying how good it was while he ate it. The recipe is super simple and easy, and I will definitely make it again. The only changes I made were to add cinnamon to the peaches, along with a little light brown sugar. I also reduced the amount of sugar in the batter down to about 3/4 cup because we like the cake topping to be a little less sweet, and of course the addition of brown sugar to the peaches compensated for it so that the dish still tasted like a dessert.

I did not have self-rising flour, so used A/P unbleached flour, adding 1 tsp. baking powder.  I also used 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. light brown sugar.  I added cinnamon w/the sugar on top of peaches before putting batter on top.   It is a good simple recipe.  Thank you.

This is such a simple and easy dessert. Yet, delicious.
 I didn't have self rising flour so I added some salt and baking powder to unbleached four . I halved the recipe and  baked  in 4 ramekins.
I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was quick and easy. I used canned peaches because the ones at the grocery store looked rotten. Will try fresh peaches next time. Added a little cinnamon like a few people suggested. It was very good. I think I ate the whole thing myself. Will definitely make this again.

I'd lost the cobbler recipe passed down through generations and looked at several recipes here before finding this simple, basic recipe that that matched my memories of cobbler making as a child. It does exactly what a cobbler recipe should: places the spotlight on the fresh summer fruit.   Being easy, it also makes cobbler the simply summer pleasure I fondly recall. Thank you!

This was so easy and sooooo yummy!!!! I love it! I can't wait to add vanilla ice cream to it! I added cinnamon sugar to the top before baking. I'm pretty sure it would be wonderful w/o the cinnamon sugar as well.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now with a modification that I feel takes it to the next level! I exchange the milk for vanilla yogurt. I also leave part of the syrup from the canned peaches in the recipe. It makes for a gooey cobbler that is awesome with ice cream!

So simple but tastes amazing.  Served it topped with mascarpone (mixed with a little sugar, vanilla and cream) and sprinkled cinnamon on top - it was fantastic.

It was my fault but I didn't add the 1 tsp baking powder that others recommended if someone didn't use self-rising flour.  It didn't rise much and it was very oily from the butter.  After it cooled the butter re-absorbed but the recipe was just so so.  I may attempt to try again with the baking powder but I don't want to waste another cube of butter if it doesn't work out.  I think I'll stick with my dad's recipe.

My family loved it! Especially with ice cream. I cut the milk in half and I think that really helped make the cake batter topping taste delicious. Also, I added 2-3 tbsp of sugar, cinnamon, and used 2 cups of canned sliced peaches. Finally, I used a pie crust to make it like a peach pie. Husband was loving it and so was our 3yr old!

I am in love with this recipe. I never liked peaches that much but after having this, I will never look at peach the same way again. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added baking powder to my all purpose flour and sprinkled cinnamon on the peaches. Turned out sooo good topped with vanilla/chocolate ice cream

Perfectly simple!  I only had a 9 x 13 pan but it came out fine. Followed directions exactly, then put a light sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  Thanks to you and your grandmother for a great recipe!

Really yummy!!!  I did use buttermilk because I had some in the fridge that needed using.  I upped the peaches to 6 cups. Also I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  Will definitely make this again!

I chose this recipe cause I'm on vacation and have a limited pantry. I halved the recipe, used fresh peaches, self raising flour, and sprinkled the peaches with a little apple pie spice. The top is soft and cake like and browns beautifully. This is a great recipe as is or easy to jazz it up.

I did add a little cinnamon. Liked the peach flavor but not fond of the consistency of the cakey part.

Very interesting, dont get me wrong, great flavor and all, but the "cobbler" part turned out soft and cakey. I loved not having to peel anything but I think it needed to be more crumbly or doughy. I won't make this recipe again, sorry!

This was great.  I also put some cinnamon over the peaches.  My husband who normally only likes apple desserts really enjoyed this cobbler and asked that I make it again.  I will be making it for my work picnic.

Super easy and delicious!  I don't like all the spices in other cobblers and the not too sweet cake-like topping was a perfect complement to fresh, ripe peaches!

I saved this recipe about 3 years ago and have been making it ever since. The crust/cake is my favorite. I don't like many crusts but this one I love.
