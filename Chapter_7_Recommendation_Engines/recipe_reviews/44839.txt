These "burgers" are not your traditional burger by any means, so the ketchup mustard route is not your best choice. Being Italian by spice addition, I chose to serve the burgers with an aioli and fresh mozzarella slices on a a rosemary/red onion foccacia instead of a hamburger bun. Keep it Italian and you can't go wrong with this delicious twist to the all-American burger.

Very good recipe.  My kids (12 & 17) enjoyed it a LOT.  Was fun trying to get them to pic the "different" spice!!  
KINA!!  I was taught how to make a burger patty long ago.  Make into a ball...then between your palms, flatten the burger to where you want it....thick or thin.  As you flatten it...keep turning the burger and gently squeeze the sides together to get ALL the air pockets out....dont make TOO thin or it will be tough.  Its not like making meatloaf....you need to handle the burger more to get all the air out...wont have any cracking and wont have that "ball" problem!!!
Good luck....

Probably the best burgers I have ever made! Very hearty! I wouldn't recommend this recipe for picky eaters - if you're used to bland, this may overwhelm you... but if you're used to a little Garlic and like Basil, you simply MUST try these. DELICIOUS.

We enjoyed these, Chris. For a pound of ground beef, I found 1 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 tsp. salt to be adequate for our taste. A bit of worcestershire might have been a nice addition. Thanks for the post.

These hamburgers were so good! I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I added a dash of cayenne pepper also. Other than that, no changes.

I didn't care for these too much.  They were salty and the basil was too strong for out tastes.  Both my husband and I loaded them with other things to cover the taste.

GREAT BURGER... I added a little more garlic with some onion and a little less salt.  Be careful with the oil,I cut back on that a little too! It kept making the grill flare up. 
Otherwise THE GUYS LOVED THEM!

Great burgers! I used ground turkey to make them a little more healthful and one clove of garlic was plenty. The burgers worked great on my George Foreman indoor grill. My husband was very impressed that I made them from scratch! Very tasty!

These were good. With any burger, before grilling, pop the patties into the freezer for about 10 minutes. It helps hold in the juices and makes for a super flavorful burger.

I like a very spicy hot burger so I added diced fresh jalapeno, 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce, and a 1/3 cup of Italian style bread crumbs to help bind it all together.  All other ingredients stayed the same.  I hand-blended all the ingredients in the meat.  Since it was pouring down rain, and the forecast was for buckets of rain, I pan fried the burgers.  Topped off with a slice of Cheddar-Mozzarella cheese and peppered bacon, it was darn near the perfect burger.  It would have been the perfect burger had I cooked them over a Hickory flavored charcoal fire.  Alas, there will be a next time.  Tomorrow sounds good to me! :)

Love this recipe, but I always use fresh basil and it makes a world of difference, and usually kick up the garlic a bit.  The olive oil is great because it lets me buy lean meat and still get a juicy burger, but with healthy fat.

"Too much salt." That is the one thing that kept cycling through my mind while eating these burgers. All the wonderful flavors inside this burger could have dramatically tantalized the taste buds. It sounded good and it looked great on paper... err... my PC monitor. However, thanks to a single spice my burger experience was lack-luster. I find it hard to believe that people are drooling upon themselves as it would appear to me that the recipe would suck out all of the moisture necessary to do so. As it stands, this recipe is only three-of-five stars in my opinion (easy enough to rectify the problem, but not outstanding as written).

Good recipe, but needs some adjustments.

For best results with juicyness, keep the olive oil at the level indicated in the recipe, and use 80% lean ground beef.  When I did this the results were amazing.  Even overcooked burgers were moist and flavorful.

However, these burgers were WAY too salty.  Make sure you use half as much salt.

Also, as commented earlier, the basil in the burgers made me feel like this was some kind of Italian burger.  I wanted a burger that would go well with the traditional American fixin's like lettuce, tomato, onion and American cheese.  The minced garlic however, is spot on and adds TONS of flavor.

Overall, a very good recipe to use as a base for making your own burgers.

This is a really good burger! The only thing I changed was the amount of oil (cut it in half), and they came out very juicy and flavorful. I let the patties sit in the fridge for a few hours which helped develop the flavor, then grilled them for a total of 8 minutes over hot coals, flipping them every 2. Great mediterranean style twist on the good old hamburger. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this burger last night.  Not bad at all, but I did add worcestershire sauce and about a tablespoon of parmesan cheese.  If using worcestershire and/or parmesan, I strongly suggest scaling the salt way back or leaving it out entirely.

I used fresh basil as I was out of the dried. My whole family raved about these. I thought they were a bit plain even using fresh basil maybe a little worcestershire on my patty next time. I will make these again as 4 out of 5 think these are the best ever.

These had a lot of flavor. Definitely better than run of the mill burgers. I'll probably reduce the pepper a bit next time, though.

I added some onion powder, dash of red pepper and garlic powder.  It tasted like a burger from an expensive restaurant!  Thanks for sharing!

I give it no stars (but I had to pick one it wouldn't let me give it zero) - I thought to myself when I read the recipe "high won't the burgers catch on fire?".  They did and what a mess!  Not impressed.

Seriously good!  The only thing I did as per other reviews is cut down on the salt, which I am glad that I did.  I used less than a teaspoon.  I wanted to make it as written the first time around, but next time I will use fresh basil and see how it comes out.

Great recipe!   I have never made a better burger.  Had some leftover basil pesto, used it instead of the dry spice and it was fabulous.  My husband was skeptical when he saw me adding the olive oil.  I waited as long as I could and finally, when his burger was almost gone I asked, "WELL?!"  He was so busy cramming it down he didn't have time to get a word out!  Turns out he loved it ;)

Different and okay, but not anything I would term spectacular.  Maybe they would be better outdoors on the grill.  It's getting nippy around here, so I cooked them on the broiler--served with fried onion rings, which can be found on this website.

This could be the most delicious burger on the planet. I roasted some garlic and used it the last time I made these and it was terrific! The olive oil really holds the juices and the basil makes it a taste treat from start to finish.  On the grill, under the broiler, in the pan--Chris' Bay Area Burger is ideal for any cooking method. 

They're what's cooking on our grill tonight!

Edit: try roasted garlic. Nom nom!!!

Yummy!!! Made these for my hubby tonight...he couldn't stop raving.. He even asked what ingredients were in it, which he never does. Very good burgers. The only thing I changed, was I only added 1 tsp of salt.

These were great! I cut the oil in half & used fresh basil instead of dried so I doubled the amount. I wrapped a piece of really good, maple flavor bacon around the outside of the burger before grilling & secured it w/ toothpicks. Honey mustard sauce (from this site) was a really good condiment for this burger. I'm normally pretty insistent on cheese being on my burger but this one had soo much flavr that it wasn't necessary. Served it w/ Spicy Baked Sweet Potato Fries ( from this site) w/ the honey mustard dipping sauce & a Midnight Special (an adult version of a coke float...also from this site)...very enjoyable lunch!

I try not to rate 5 stars unless it really is a great recipe.  This recipe definetly got a 5 STAR.  The recipe ingredients did not really appeal to me initially, but I made it exactly how it was described, but I did add some extra garlic since we are garlic lovers.  They turned out GREAT!  A really good grilled burger that is for sure!  In the past two weeks I have made them twice and both times I received grand reviews.  I even caught my husband eating a second burger one night about an hour after dinner and asked him if he was eating because he was hungry or because he liked the burgers...He said because he like the burgers, so that was a confirmation that this is a keeper.  We look forward to many grilled burgers this summer!

It was a relatively tasty burger, but my young children didn't like the spice.  You could definitely taste the garlic and basil--too much for 1-5 year olds perhaps.  It was okay, but I probably won't make it again.

I just tried this tonight and it was so awesome! These (cheese) burgers were absolutely bursting with flavor!! I added a personal desired amount of onion and bell peppers to mine, and used seasoning salt instead of regular salt, but they turned out really wonderful!!!!

One of the best burger recipes I have come across.  Juicy, flavorful, and really easy to make.  I serve them with a garlic and black pepper aioli, fresh tomato and mozzarella slices, a leaf of basil, and lettuce.  It's a keeper.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I had it at a BBQ and I asked for the recipe.  The host said she got it here.  I have used it ever since.  These make burgers just melt in your mouth!  I think it's the oil that does the trick.  Be sure not to over cook them or they kind of dry out.  They still taste good, but they loose the deliciousness of a juicy burger.

My wife and I tried this recipe for our 4th of July burgers. I would recommend using half as much garlic and salt. Other than that, the burgers were great!

these were good but not the best, I like the basil flavor. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp as many reviewers recommended and used fresh basil. I agree with many reviewers that they don't go with the "typical" hamburger toppings, better with a toasted bun and some mayo, tomato and cheese.

I thought these were pretty good! The only thing is I think next time I might saute the garlic a little bit before I mix it with the meat so it's a little bit softer. I wasn't able to grill them due to the weather so I just cooked them on a griddle so they were a little greasy, but I'm sure cooking them on the grill would solve that problem.  Overall a very good recipe!

Love these!  Best burgers I've ever made!  Like other reviewers said, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil is enough, otherwise the grill flares up like crazy.  And the salt could be just 1 teaspoon, or even 1/2.  But SO good!

Too much salt and pepper in the burger; however, the juiciness is top notch.  Next time I'll cut the salt and pepper in half and it'll be a perfect burger.

Not one of the better burgers in my family's opinion. They were not juicy at all and the basil taste was overpowering. On the plus side they were very filling.

I have made some great burger recipes, but they are all so complicated and loaded with expensive ingredients. This one is hands down, the best "simple" burger that I have come across. It takes you back to what a burger should be about....the meat! Only having cheddar in the house, that's what we used in addition to fresh tomatoes and lettuce topped of with a touch of mustard and ketchup. (I did reduce salt to just under 1 tsp and found it plenty). This is my new go-to recipe for exceptional taste, easy prep, and basic ingredients I always seem to have around. Highly recommend it.

Amazing burgers.  I added Balsamic vinegar and crumbled Feta cheese to the hamburger. I brushed Olive Oil w/ Italian seasonings on Pane Turano bread and grilled it just long enough to make it crisp.  I spread Classico Basil Pesto spread on top of the burgers when they were done.  Incredible.  My son says this is the only way he wants me to make hamburgers from now on.

I followed this to the "T" , it tasted just like a regular burger to me. My wife said she could not even taste the garlic or the basil. Neither could I.  UPDATE: I ate one of the leftovers today for lunch and it tasted better than yesterday. I think the pickles, mustard, tomato;s lettuce, that I put on my burger had hid the flavor.

This burger tasted like a turkey burger, without the benefits of it actually being a turkey burger.  I think it was the basil.  Oh well, I won't be making this again.

These were very tasty! Use fresh basil, it makes a big difference in the flavor. I melted a slice of mozzerella cheese on them and made a little garlic mayo. Will definitely make again.

We Loved these! I did change it a little bit by using 1 TBS olive oil per 2 lbs meat and added 1 TBS worschestire sauce for 2 lbs of meat. I also used fresh basil leaves, chopped.

These were a nice change and a different burger. They had an italian flavor and you just can't put any toppings on these because of that. They were moist and tender and a little hint of sweet too. These were much better topped with some spaghetti sauce and smoked provolone. Thanks!

A real hit, thanks Chris! So easy to make, juicy and  flavorful! This will become a staple in our house. We find that high heat make hockey puck burgers, so we cooked over medium and they came out perfectly.

These are soooo good. They leave that nice burger taste but give lots of flavor. I made them for fourth of July, and every one loved them. They do tend to flame up on the grill from the olive oil.

I was soooo impressed. I never make an untried recipe for company, but I decided to go out on a limb with these. What a huge hit. Gone are the days of egg and breadcrumbs and dried out hockey pucks on the grill. These were super juicy, even though we thoroughly cooked them, and the flavour was perfect. I ALWAYS tweak every recipe, but this one will remain untouched. :)

These were so flavorful!  We put these on the BBQ and the oil dripping on the flame just made them perfect!  Nothing to change about this recipe.  will definately make again.

Yummy! Very simple yet very delectable burger. However, I put in a little less salt than indicated. About half a teaspoon. It came out great with just the right flavor I wanted. Thanks Chris!

I made these burgers for a family picnic and some of my pickier relatives refused to eat them because they were too salty. I probably should have taken heed of my intuition and used less salt, but I wanted to stay true to the recipe. Half of the prescribed amount probably would have worked fine. Otherwise, I think this would be a good recipe.

Perfection!  I use fresh basil from my garden and these are to die for, exactly as the recipe is written.  If using fresh basil, julienne enough leaves to make about 2 Tablespoons.

Darn good! We put 3 cloves of garlic but that's just the way we roll. If you are making a cheeseburger watch your cooking time, we put our sharp provolone a little too late so the burger was over cooked. It was still darn diggily nabbit good! Will make again.

I just made these today for a pool party bbq and they were a big hit....everyone, even the kids loved them.  They were moist with a perfect blend of flavors.  Next time will try a special dressing/sauce and probably try various cheeses.  wonderful.

I am not a big fan of Salt so I used the ingredients as a rub instead of mixing the meat and spices together.  I marinated the burgers (1" thick) in the fridge for 2hrs, cooked on charcoal bbq low heat and used water soaked cherry tree chips for extra flavor.  I added a slice of marble cheese, buttered and added basil and garlic salt to the buns, toasted on the grill.  For the topping all I used was ranch salad dressing.  I also did full mushroom Kabobs and used the left over spice mixture as a baste for them.  This is the best burger I have eaten to date, thanks for sharing!

Tremendous, delicious, and thoroughly satisfying!  The meat was juicy and the garlic and basil were a treat to the palate.

Only changes I made were to add some finely chopped green onion to the mix, and I fried them on the stove in a stainless steel pan. (about 5 minutes per side).  Melted cheddar on top right before serving.

Served on a toasted wheat roll spread with crumbled bacon and cream cheese spread. MMMMMM!

Next time I think I'll garnish with fresh mozzarela, tomato and spinach leaves.  No more boring burgers in this household!

I tried this recipe using ground beef and was not thrilled with the results.  Came across it again and decided to try it with ground venison since I have a freezer full thanks to my hubby.  It makes the best veinson burgers ever.  Something about the spices really goes well with that meat.  I used 1t. granulated garlic instead of minced.  Also used white american cheese instead of yellow.  Try this with venison!

These are the best burgers I've ever made according to my husband and 23 year old son.  I made a few alterations in that I used seasoning salt rather than regular salt and reduced it to 1 tsp, used Angus beef (85/15), and added a tbsp of worchestershire sauce and 1/4 tsp onion powder.  My son always asks for plain burgers with salt and pepper only so I didn't tell him that I'd added some extra seasonings.  He loved them and never commented on the extra seasonings that really gave these burgers a kick.  They definitely aren't your ordinary backyard burgers.  Other reviewers are right when they say to go easy on the condiments.  My husband and I only needed mayo and slices of onion simply because that's how we like our burgers.  You could really eat them without any rolls or condiments...they're so yummy!!  Great recipe and thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I added some greek seasoning and some montreal steak seasoning to the mix. I also glazed the burgers with a little mixture of garlic, sweet baby ray's sweet n spicy bbq sauce, chicago fire mustard, arizona heat mustard, worchestershire, and beer. Great with colby jack or havarti cheese!

The ingredients in the recipe are similar to those I use to make meatballs, which are good. However, I would like to have a different flavor so I can distinguish the difference between this hamburger and a meatball sandwich.  I would give this a 4 star because of its similarity to what I make.

Beautiful.  If you like a sophisticated subtlety of flavour and actually like your food to taste like the food itself, and not JUST of the slap-ons & add-ins, then you'll love these.  I put one more clove of garlic in, and an additional tbsp of rich, quality olive oil, and they were awesome; simple - the way burgers should be - and full of flavour.  i, too, was a bit wary of the no-egg thing, but it didn't matter; the oil held it together perfectly.  we topped it with tomatoes, provolone, lettuce and just a drop of ketchup (old habits die hard) and they were amazing.  I should add, though, that I only added half the amount of salt (and that was plenty). Had i added the entire amount...i'm thinking unpalatable.  Thx!  And NB: buy good lean beef, though, if not x-tra lean; it won't work with medium.    Yum  :P

FABULOUS! I agree with kevnbro that it is not your traditional burger, and doesn't need traditional condiments. I served it with sauteéd mushrooms, onions, and an Italian five cheese blend shredded cheese. I didn't need anything else! I also did not grill them, I broiled them for 3 minutes on each side and they were unbelieveably juicy!  My husband loved them and I will definitely make again :-)

These burgers certainly tasted great and are not your ordinary burgers. We didn't even need ketchup when eating it since the natural flavor from the meat was so enriching. I switched up the recipe a little bit: to enhance the garlic flavor, I used garlic powder instead of the garlic called for in the recipe (about 2 tablespoons was good). I also added two tablespoons of onions, which added both flavor and texture. One thing that I did also was refrigerate the meat for about half an hour to an hour. This way, the meat had time to absorb in all the flavor from the individual components that I added in. When cooking, just tack on an extra one or two minutes to time on the grill. It came out great!

We grilled these last night and I got a thumbs up from everybody. I used lean ground beef since I was adding olive oil, and they still came out really moist. My husband said it's one of the best burgers he's ever had!

What a burger! Subtly sophisticated, and bursting with flavor. Even the kids loved it. I added some dried onion flakes and doubled the basil. Broiled it in my oven for six minutes on each side, and they were perfect.

Nice and juicy with great flavor (basil is a favorite of mine) -- however be sure to have a spray bottle on hand while grilling... the olive oil makes the flames flare up even more than usual.

We really enjoyed the garlic/basil flavor, but our family found the recipe calls for too much salt for our taste. Cut it down if you're sensitive to salt. Otherwise, they were delicious.

These were a BIG HIT at our house.  It turned ordinary hamburger (I use ground chuck), into "steak burgers" as my husband called them.  I used 1 t. salt, a little more burger, and added a little worchestershire sauce.  I'll never make the "old" hamburgers again!

I made this recipe twice last week using ground turkey and seasoning salt.  I cut it in half for the two of us, but made the other half last weekend.  My husband absolutely LOVED the burgers, and I did too.  We will definitely make them again, and I will try them with ground beef when we have company.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Pretty good!  I added some more seasonings, mixed in some vegetable crumbles and parmesan cheese.  It was a hit.  Only thing we didn't like, a little meatloaf like in consistancy.

This recipe was good, however, it's not the best I've had.  The spice and garlic were very apparent and wouldn't go well on a plain cheeseburger with ketchup.  This burger is meant for something with swiss cheese and sauteed onions and mushrooms.

These burgers were a nice change from the norm.  The basil really gives them an herby flavor. I made some sauteed mushrooms and onions to accompany and topped the burgers with swiss cheese.  My husband asked that I make them again and I would agree that the recipe is a keeper.

These are wonderful!  This is the second time in a week we've had them. Although not everyone was home the first time, they agree it's a recipe we'll keep (the first time, two of us intended to save some for the missing family members, but ended up eating them all ourselves...piggy piggy).  Added a little onion, cut back the pepper and increased the garlic, but no other changes.  Since we like our burgers pretty well done, sometimes they turn out rather dry, but not these.  We've tried several other seasoned burger recipes found at Allrecipes.com this summer, but these are by far the best.

These burgers were excellent.  tasty and super juicy!  The garlic and basil gave them such a great flavor! The recipe was followed exactly. I don't understand why people don't love this unless they're looking for a plain, bland burger.  this is a basic burger with just a subtle super-yummy lift! Most worthy of making for guests too!

These were a nice change from my standard "Lawry's, minced onion, and pepper" hamburgers.  I wouldn't say they knocked my socks off, but I will make them again sometime.  BTW, I used Italian seasoning instead of plain Basil.

Good burger Chris.  Something different from the norm, I wasn't salvating all over my self or anything, but I still did like it.  I cut the recipe to make two 3 oz. patties, cooked it up on my George Forman, and the baby liked it as well (he ate the whole pattie).  Maybe I'll try it with turkey as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks Chris!

The flavor was ok at first but about 1/2 way through we had to stop eating.  My husband and daughter both asked me to never make these again.  Later that evening we started burping and it was horrible!

These burgers were really yummy.  Can't say they are the best we've ever made, but they went over really well with my husband's family.  The olive oil really makes for a smokey grilling experience, though.

I really looked forward to this as some folks had said that it was different from the usual.  It did taste good but not materially different.

Doubled the recipe and used a pound of xtra lean and a pound on 80/20. Kept all ingredient ratio
As stated for a double recipe except the pepper. I used one tsp as we had finely milled. I shaped the patties and froze them for about an hour before grilling. I grilled on low heat- no flare ups and perfectly cooked. My guys loved these.

My husband and I hunt a lot, so we don't usually eat beef. I read tons of the reviews and cooked this with ground moose. Moose is very lean and I only needed to use 1 tbsp of oil. I also added chopped onions with the garlic. I kept the basil to a minimum and used fresh leaves from my garden. My BBQ gets extremely hot even when three burners are on, so I've learned how to use indirect heat to cook 95% of my meals. I keep only the sides on, and cook in the middle. About 10 min each side. Takes a bit longer to cook, but worth the wait. Not dry at all.
Works very well. Jason is eating this now and said SAVE THIS RECIPE! Thank you for sharing

I guess the olive oil is making the hamburger 'juicy', but I would only add it to ground beef, if it was very lean meat. And, I didn't add but a fraction of the salt. My husband & I have high blood pressure, a lot of salt would be bad for it. I would take that into consideration, if I were making these for quests.

These were delicious!  We were having company over, so I had to double the recipe.  Instead of doubling the hamburger, I used both a pound of hamburger and a pound of ground turkey to make them a little healthier.  Because I had read that it was a little salty, I didn't double the salt.  I just added an extra 1/2 tsp.  It was still too much for us, but the burgers were still GREAT!  Thank you for this recipe!

The recipe seemed too simple to be really good, I did not have high expectations of this one...I made it because of the rating...and it definitely deserves it's 5 star rating.  This recipe will remain a favorite and I will most likely pass it on to many people.  The burgers held together very well and were moist and juicy and just delicious. Everyone that I served them to agreed they were the best burgers I had ever made.

One easy change and you have a perfect company burger! Reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. That's it!  Be careful - my husband says they cook a little faster than normal on the grill. Easy and delicious!

Love this. It's perfect. I crushed all the ingredients together with a pestle and mortise and used an extra lean meat. It was a little tough. I might have over mixed it or it could just need more fat.

I'm sorry to have to leave a 2-star review, but these burgers were FAR too salty. I used only 1 tsp for 1.03 lbs ground beef, and they were still so salty as to be actually unpleasant. I think these would be great with only 1/2 tsp., but that's not what the recipe says, and I can't give it a high rating since that's not fair to the next cook who makes this as-written and ruins a pound of beef. Thanks for the recipe, it's always fun to try things that are a little bit outside the comfort zone, for better or for worse :)

I LOVE these burgers... I add extra garlic (Because I'm a garlic fiend) but other than that... follow the recipe.  (And use fatty (at least 80/20) ground beef.)  It works great for turkey burgers, or lower fat burgers as well... but, for a great burger, use the fatty stuff.

I usually end up doctoring a recipe to follow my tastes, but I did this one as it was created.  It was very over-powering when I followed one of the top comments to make some aoili to put with it.  Just stick with onion, tomato, and some plain mayo (if you like mayo).  I'd still skip the ketchup/mustard and probably scale back on the salt/garlic/basil by half - and I'm a garlic lover.

Very nice, as good or better than the pub burger I get in town.  I added a little extra garlic and also a touch of white pepper.  Served with red onion, sweet pickle relish and mustard and ketchup.  It worked well.  May try it with cheese or bacon or avocado in the future, but for now this worked for me as described.

I used 93% lean ground meat, so the olive oil worked to keep them juicy.  But something about the burger taste I didn't like.  To me it was just oddly flavored. Perhaps it was the basil, but it overwhelmed the meat.  Just not my taste

This was a good burger, but not the best I have had. I have a couple other recipes from Allrecipes that are 5 stars.

Thank you!  I am on a very strict elimination diet where I can't have gluten, soy, tomato, dairy, corn etc.   When I got home, I realized that I couldn't have steak sauce or ketchup or a bun!  When I read the reviews that said no additional toppings or bun were needed, I had to try it.    They were right.  It was simply delicious.  Thank you!

Best burger I've had in quite a while, and I didn't even have any cheddar to top it off with! I recommend A-1 instead of ketchup. Will be making these again soon!

These are great burgers.  I have made them several times this summer and everyone commented how moist they were.  Even the most picky of eaters!  They are great on the grill as they oil in them doesn't allow them to stick to the grill. They flame up because of thet too, but just put the margarita down and watch them for a few minutes.  Great Burgers!

We loved these! I can see why they are such a hit, Gaven. Cut oil to 1.5 tbsp and salt to 1 tsp - perfect. Can't wait to make them for guests.

This burger was delicious.  You could really use any spice you liked if you don't care for the taste of basil.  My burgers came out very moist and delicious.  I love that there are no bread crumbs in this burger.  They stay together beautifully.

Very good burger!  I thought it was a bit salty but no one else complained and I'm the salt lover in the family.  Still, I'll cut back the salt a bit next time.  One thing:  my son's grill flared like crazy from the olive oil!

freaking awesome burgers!  they were so juicy and delicious!  i used my GF grill, worked great.  also, i topped with mozzarella cheese and avocado and a little bit of ketchup.  we found that much more really hid the flavor.  the boyfriend may love these burgers more than he loves me.

Good! I had never, ever put oil in a burger before, but this was really yummy. I wasn't sure if my husband would go for these because he likes his burgers a certain way, but he loved it. Thanks :)

I was given some ultra-lean ground beef by a farmer-friend, and I was looking for flavorful ways to add a little fat so the burgers didn't dry out.  The olive oil in this recipe did the trick!  I made it exactly as printed, and will definitely try it again.  I served the burgers on whole wheat buns with mayo, grilled onion, lettuce, and thin slices of asiago cheese (I would have used provolone, but I was all out of it).  The next time I try it, I'll probably cut back a little on the salt and add a little minced onion or shallot.  And with summer coming, I'll probably use fresh basil instead of dried.

The family really liked these burgers!  Good flavor even though my basil may have been old.  I need  to figure out how to blend it up without over working the meat. Mine came out a little too "solid" because I blended the mixture too much I think.  Try not to over-blend if that makes any sense:-)  Did not remind me of meatloaf at all and the garlic and basil really worked well.  It's about a 4.5 out of 5 so I'll make them again!

Great, tasty burger. I mix up a slew of them, form them into patties, and freeze between layers of waxed paper so they're easy to grab for a quick BBQ. Kids love 'em too.

My first attempt at "homemade" burgers and we all really enjoyed them!  Been making them this way ever since.  I make them "slider" size and put them on my George Foreman grill.

This recipe tasted really great. I used ground moose instead of ground beef & it tasted wonderful. We ate them just like normal burgers...slice of american cheese, lettuse, onions mayo and mustard. Awesome. Thanks for this recipe...

This was definitely drool worthy.  Now I know why people come over to his house!  I'm not a BBQ type person and propane scares me so I just used our George Foreman grill and kept cooking em til the sides were no longer pink.  I made them into mini burgers.  The only change I made was to drastically downsize the amount of salt and pepper.  It did seem like a bit much so instead I used 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of pepper for the pound. Oh, I did add one extra thing and thats poking a hole in each patty, throw in some cheese and close it off so its all ooey gooey and yummy when you bite into it.   Other than that, no changes.  I love this recipe because you don't have to let your meat marinate and can make em immediately, its incredibly easy and its SO flavorful that honestly, condiments are not even really necessary.  My husband and I loved em. I will definitely make this again and again.   Thank you for the post!

These burgers were great! Excellent flavor.  The only thing I changed was using only one fresh clove of garlic as opposed to two...garlic can be pretty overbearing if you use too much.  Other than that this recipe is perfect.  I had a leftover burger the next day and chopped in up into my mac and cheese (kind of a hamburger helper effect) and it added such a great taste to a boring dish.  Awesome burgers!!!

Delicious!   To add a little variety, I added cooled sauteed mushrooms (to cut back on the watery factor while cooking) & cooked bacon pieces (to cut back on the greasiness factor) into the ground meat mixture.  So yummy.  And to make it a little more grill-friendly, I always toss my formed patties in the freezer between 2 sheets of wax paper for about half and hour or so before grilling to help them set-up and stay together on those hot summer days.

My husband is half Italian, so I thought we should give this recipe a try. I'm so glad we did. They're so juicy & the basil is not overpowering. I used 1 tbls. fresh basil instead of the dried. I also added a slice of mozzarella at the end of the cooking time. One of the other reviewers suggested using foccacia instead of hamburger buns. I used individual ciabatta rolls, toasted on the grill. Now that was good! This delicious burger is definitely a keeper.

The basic recipe was fine but I tweaked it a bit for my family's and my taste.

I omitted the basil leaves and cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon.

I added a teaspoon of soy sauce, 1/2 a teaspoon of onion powder and 1/2 a teaspoon of ground mustard. 

I replaced the minced garlic with garlic powder.

I fried it on the George Foreman grill and melted cheddar cheese on the top. 

Fabulous!

This was an absolutely delicious burger that everyone in my family enjoyed. The mix of spices made for an interesting taste, and I think that I could possibly add more ingredients to the meat for it to taste even better. This time, I added about two tablespoons of diced onions to the pound of meat that I had. It certainly tasted quite delicious. Once again, a spot-on burger recipe that you can't go wrong with.

These had a nice flavor.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, added some Worcheshire sauce and a dash or red pepper flakes and reduced the oil a bit.  Pretty good!

I thought these were good, but honestly, I made meatballs out of the second half of the mixture since that is what these really tasted like.  Also, I thought the oil content was a bit high and would cut back next time.

My boyfriend and I love this!  Very good and we've made it several times.  I use fresh basil instead of dried.  Also sometimes throw in a little worchestershire sauce.  Top with swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms.  Terrific flavor.

These burgers are awesome!!  I followed the advice of previous reviwers and only added 1 tbs. of olive oil, I also only used 1/2 tsp of salt.  For the toppings, I sauted some onions and mushrooms in butter and placed sliced white American cheese on top of the burgers!!  They were juicy and very tastey!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I thought it had a bit too much salt, though.  Next time I'm going to try it with 1/2 to 1 tsp only.  I really liked the spiciness of the garlic and pepper.

Great burger recipe!  The burgers are very moist, and as most everyone else has stated, very flavorful.  We add double cheese (American & Swiss), onion, ketchup & mayo.  I toast our buns (which have been lightly buttered and seasoned with garlic powder) on the grill, and altogether it's a mouth-watering feast!

Wow. I was looking for a new burger, and i found it. I added a little Worstecshire, and went heavy on the garlic and basil, but, stayed true to the recipe still. Fabulous! You need to love garlic to love this, and i do love it! I scaled the recipe down to one burger, and cooked it in the pan. One thing I like-this recipe works well for us rare burger people!

oh, now this was one tasty burger.  Used two large cloves of garlic and it was almost too garlicky.  Seasoned salt added a little more flavor.  It's not THE perfect burger, but it's mighty fine.

Was looking for something a little different than the plain old burger. I used ground round, which is usually dry, and the only thing I did differently was to add a minced green onion and I used about 1 1/2 tbsp of olive oil. We like our burgers big so I made only 2 out of the recipe. My husband said to give it 5 stars.

Quick, easy and flavorful.  These burgers were fantastic!  I changed the recipe a bit by adding a splash of Teriyaki sauce and a bit of grated Parmesan cheese.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

these are the best burgers I have ever made!  Very moist, cooked in a Foreman grill.  I might cut back the tiniest of bits on the salt and pepper next time.  But I will definitely be using this for my burger recipe from now on.  Thanks Chris!

Will use again - VERY GOOD!!!!  The only thing I changed is I used chilli-infused olive oil instead of plain olive oil.   Great with grilled onions and a slice of provolone cheese on top!!!!  For those of you that plan to actually grill these burgers - this is a great recipe!!!

These were actually pretty good. But next time I'll lessen the amount of basil, too much overpowers the burger.

The burger tasted pretty good. However they made my family stink for the rest of the night! Not something to eat before you plan to go out in public! lol I don't think I'll be making these again.

I followed the recipe and these made great burgers. I had to use the broiler due to the threat of rain. These are the best burgers I ever cooked indoors. I will try them on the grill next time.

I've made these burgers a few times now, and every time they are a hit.  For a bit of a twist, chop up about 4 - 8 jalapenos (depending on your spice tolerance) and mix them in step one.  Serve with melted jalapeno havarti on top.  Fantastic.

Good base recipe. I doubled the recipe to cover two pounds of beef. I added 2 Tablespoons of A1 sauce and 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. I only used three cloves instead of four. Add a hand full of bread crumbs. Everybody loved these burgers, as did I! Its worth the effort....

A friend used this recipe for a party last weekend. I asked for the recipe. This is one of the best burger recipes that I have ever tasted. So juicy and savory. I think it is more flavorful and juicy than some "gourmet" burger places like Five Guys. Very easy to prepare as well.

These are delicious. I used some sun-dried tomatoes and the olive oil they were packed in, fresh chopped basil, and some grated smoked sheep/goats cheese, all mixed in along with the garlic. Ten minutes per side was perfect, and I toasted the buns while the patties cooked.

I made this recipe today and needed to triple the size..it was GREAT! My burgers were moist, and very flavorful, the only change that I made was to cut the salt by about 1/4. All of the "hard to please" grandkids really liked it and my husband thought it was wonderful. I plan to make this my go to recipe for burgers.

Very flavorful and delicious with the garlic and basil, and the olive oil kept the burgers very moist... HOWEVER, the oil made the grill flame up big time, and also the burgers were entirely too salty and greasy. I will make these again but next time, I'll cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp and the olive oil down to 1 T.

Was excited to try this recipe. Tried not to use too much olive oil but something went wrong. They were charred on medium heat after 5 min and burned up inside of my grill and blackened the siding on my house

I really enjoyed these burgers! I paired these burgers with some simple homemade fries.  The only thing I would change would be to use a little less salt, maybe like a 1/2 tsp, but this is just my personal preference.  I will definitely make these again!

These burgers were good but I felt like they were missing something in the flavor department. So I have added various thing each time I made them to spruce them up.

These came out pretty good. We used italian seasoning instead of basil and reduced the amount of salt. I had it on a toasted bun with marinated artichokes, lettice, aioli mustard and homemade garlic/white wine vinegar mayonnaise.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!!! We made them last week and they were perfect! Even my 3yr old loved it. He said it was the bestest ever!
ONLY change I did was half the salt only because my husband doesnt like salt as it is.

i followed most of the recipe but decided to do garlic salt instead of salt since i love garlic and also added a bit of montreal steak seasoning to it to give it even more flavor. i made this along with some steak fries seasoned with garlic salt and montreal steak seasoning. they were really good with adding the galric salt and montreal steak seasoning i cooked them in my city slider that i got from as seen on tv and turned out great :).

Tasted OK, but they lit up my grill in flames. Didn't stick together that well either, so even more parts of them were falling into the grill and lighting on fire. My husband was alarmed at how fiery they were! Will probably not make again.  Used fresh basil instead of dried.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe.  Despite other reviews, I don't think that the basil was too strong.  In fact, I think it was just perfect.    Thanks for sharing!

Great burger for a change of pace.  I usually top my burgers with american cheese, ketchup, mayo and salt.  Sometimes I'll use lettuce, tomato and bacon if I'm up to it.  I didn't need ANY of those with these burgers.  Just the patty between the buns.  Awesome!

This was great.  We've made it a couple of times now.  Not too weird, just brings out the taste of the beef.  We cook them on a charcoal grill and they are incredible.  Nice and juicy, too!  My kids little kids love them as as cheeseburgers.

I'm giving it 5 stars because we have been eating boring regular burgers on the grill all summer and all of a sudden my family came to life - "This burger is awesome!" someone cried out. "Yum" was the word of the day.

YUM!  This is a keeper.  We had a bunch of people over for a cookout so I used 3.5 lbs of ground chuck and tripled all of the ingredients.  Everyone raved about the burgers.  So good.

These are simply amazing.  My husband LOVED them, and we made them a second time the very next weekend for a cookout with my husband's parents.  Everyone raved over it and then mother in law made the burgers herself later that very week.  Great recipe!

Love this recipe. It has become my go-to recipe for burgers. I always make sure I use natural ground beef and the burgers are so good that we usuallu want to eat 2 instead of 1. :)

Very disappointing! I made them following the recipe exactly only substituted 1/2 tsp of garlic powder since I didn't have any cloves on hand. These were WAY too salty! I would never make these again but if I did I would cut back to maybe 1/2 tsp of salt.

I make these with ground turkey and cut the salt back to 1 tsp and they are always a hit.

Adequate. A juicy burger thanks to the EVOO, but it tasted more like meatloaf than a burger. The italian seasoning doesn't suit a hamburger quite as well. It could use some onion, a little dab of chile powder,some worchestire sauce, or SOMEthing. Thoroughly unimpressed.

This recipe was delicious and simple.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and my beef-eating husband didn't even notice the difference.  I also used fresh basil chopped small and added some oregano and red chili pepper.  Served with provolone cheese.  Outstanding!!!

These taste a lot of pepper so if you aren't a big pepper fan you may want to cut out the amount of pepper you add to the beef.

I loved this blend!  I was kind of weirded out by the lack of eggs but it worked out really well.  I really liked the garlic in this recipe.  I just put the patties on a wheat bun and added provolone and sautéed mushrooms and onions and a bit of mayonnaise and it was perfect.

Excellent recipe. They came out perfect in my frying pan. They had just the right amount of everything and were very juicy and simple to make. I put Swiss, mushrooms and sauteed onions on them. Delicious!

These burgers had a very good flavor. I used sea salt since it didnt specify which to use. I was pleasantly surprised that the olive oil in these didnt cause the flame to flare up. i did you 85% ground beef so that may have helped. Great recipe! I will be making these again.

Never before has my husband raved about a burger like he did this one!  It has such an amazing flavor.  Very different than anything we've ever eaten.  Moist would be an understatement!  I just said to him that I had a roast I could cook for dinner and he said, yeah, but you also have ground meat...hint, hint.....  I'm making them again now!  Try it!

These were pretty bland as is.  I followed the recipe as written minus 1/3 of the salt, then tasted the meat (yes...raw).  Eh.  It wasn't until I added cumin, paprika, italian seasoning, worcestershire sauce, Montreal steak seasoning and cayenne that I found it flavorful.  Unfortunately, the man liked it.  So that means one day I have to recreate what I did.

My husband and I love these burgers. Now I buy a bunch of ground beef, throw everything in the mixer and then make patties to freeze. That way we always have them ready and available when we are in the mood for a good burger. Delicious!

Very good.  maybe not the best burger I have ever had, but in the top 10 forsure.  I used extra lean ground beef, because my wife and I are on a diet.  I suspect the cheaper, and tastier, regular ground beef or ground chuck would lead to an even better, juicier, burger.  Very good even with extra lean.  Probably should deserve 5 stars, but I used extra lean, and it wasn't quite there.    Delicious none the less.  Make the patties and let them sit in the fridge for a while to hold and conform to shape before grilling.

These burgers were so moist and flavorful.  The only thing I added was a 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  And for a little more zest, I topped the burgers with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

I'll admit. I didn't use as much basil but I'm just not really into over spicing. I only used a dash of dried basil, 1 clove garlic, 1 Tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp salt and it still came out delicious and more to my husband's liking. Also, I used some liquid smoke because it was snowing and I didn't want to pull out the grill.

Wow! What a difference using olive oil in lieu of an egg makes!  These burgers were delish.  I adjusted the recipe to my tastes by adding some freshly grated parmesan cheese and chopped onions.  Otherwise, I stuck to the original instructions and the burgers turned out stellar.

Have made these twice now, very good. Did them once with regular black pepper, once with fresh ground black pepper, fresh made them much better.  These are great with mayo, bacon, pepperjack cheese, and avocado.

This is so good and so easy.  We have our's on ciabatta bread with melted mozzarella (I broil it on the buns first to get it melted and browned yummy) and top with garlic mayo.  Everone in the house eats them.  Try these with the three-step salad also from this site.  Great combo.  I think we would have these every week but I don't want to burn it out!  Thank you for the great recipe!

A little too much garlic for me, but my hubby and friends said it was perfect.  I also added a little of Stubbs hamburger spice rub - can't have a burger without it.

These were a huge hit tonight.  Might add less garlic and salt next time.  Also, my BBQ lit up like a Christmas tree due to the olive oil in the burgers, but I turned the heat down, kept the lid open and they didn't burn.  Delish.

Very tasty and easy to make. Perfect for anyone who has a busy schedule because you can just make up some patties, freeze them, and then cook them when you need to.

I've never made a burger before and thought this recipe was pretty easy and idiot-proof.  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  One of my guests, who HATES basil, actually enjoyed it.

It was a gorgeous day here in Olympia, Washington so I got out the grill and made these delicious burgers.  Just started the Summer with a bang!  I didn't change a thing - quick, easy, juicy and had the WOW factor!

I did not expect these to taste so great.  I halved the recipe and eyeballed the ingredients.  Used minced garlic--probably about a tablespoon.  Added dried onions and subbed 3 grinds of sea salt for the salt because that was what I had.  Also used fresh ground pepper.   We only had coney island hot dog rolls so I made them to fit in the buns and grilld on the Foreman.  Tasted great with dijon mustard.  I could definitely serve this for company and my picky 5 year old loved them too.

This was a great burger recipe.  For the most part it seems like people think a burger is a burger and recipes for them tend to get overlooked.  But this was definitely an excellent burger and I'm sure I'll be making it again.  I did add a tablespoon of tomato paste to the recipe, something I learned from a friend...I think it adds moisture and flavor. Aside from that though they were awesome.

Very, very good burger!
I am not a huge basil fan, so I added just a 'dash' of basil instead of the whole tsp and it was great.  The only other thing I would change is cutting way back on the salt.  I think this will be my new burger recipe from now on though!

I made this with turkey and it ended up tasting like sausage. It was delicious, but I would never make it with turkey again. That's the only negative thing I can say about the recipe and since the recipe doesn't call for turkey...

You definitely have to LOVE basil to enjoy this burger and while I do not, my boyfriend who eats all of five things entirely plain (chicken fingers, steak, hamburgers, pizza and hot dogs) absolutely loved this. He wanted it both for lunch and dinner but drank a gallon of soda with it!

My family liked these better than I did, but we all agreed the olive oil kept the meat moist and flavorful. For me there was a bit too much basil and garlic in them: I would cut back next time and possibly add some cinamon or clove, common spices for ground beef in the Mediterranean.

I invited my parents over when I served these. As soon as anyone took a bite they commented on how great they were. They are really easy and make cheap ground beef taste fantastic. Beware when you are grilling though, the oil does make the grill flame up more than usual. I will certainly make them again. Thanks Chris

I was surprised that adding olive oil to already greasy meat was good. It really helped keep the burgers from falling apart on the grill. I don't like salt so I only added a small amount. Mixed reviews from family members but I liked them. Moist, flavorful & easy.

Really good!  When my husband says so, especially since he makes some really mean burgers himself, they must be good.  I plan to try experimenting with some different seasonings next time.  Hope I don't blow it...wouldn't want to mess up a good thing!

I really thought this would be a better burger. It didn't have a lot of flavor even though I automatically doubled the ingredients and added chopped onion along with the garlic. I am going to try it again, but thit time I will triple the ingredients and grill them.

I was looking for a regular burger that would go with the regular fixin's.  The taste of these burgers were very over powering.  I think they could be good if they were presented more as an "Italian" burger (serve with mozzarella cheese, tomato slices and fresh basil, for example.  That would definitely be better but I can't decide if the burger would still be too overpowering.

These turned out really good.  Not your typical boring hamburgers.  I mixed the seasoning into the burgers and let it sit for about 30 minutes before grilling.  Then we topped them with sauteed onions and melted provolone cheese.  There wasn't anything left.

I made these burgers for my husband's birthday a couple of years ago and still get requests for them!  It's my favourite burger recipe now.

These were really good. I didn't add as much salt as called for, and they still tasted salty to me.  I'll add even less next time.

This recipe was quick and easy, but the taste was just not for us. The spices were overwhelming, especially the garlic. The oil added made the burgers moist, but we just didn't care for the flavor.

Really good burger recipe. I like the garlic and basil taste and got rave reviews from my friends. The only thing is: I don't know what I do wrong, but my burgers always pull together and end up in a rather meatball-like shape and not as a pattie...

Last night, I was in the mood for a quick, tasty burger without the hassle of eggs and breadcrumbs, and these sure did deliver - these were so easy to make, I'm almost tempted to make another batch tonight! Didn't have dried basil, so I used dried oregano instead - still very tasty, and possibly handy for those who don't like the taste of basil as much. Had no problems with the garlic, but that might have been because I used smaller cloves, and made sure they were well-minced.

I agree with another reviewer that said gone are the days of eggs and breadcrumbs!  These are very moist and hold together well with the olive oil.  They flame up quite a bit with the oil, so beware or use foil. I used fresh basil but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They did seem to be missing just a little something.  I will definitely make these again but I will follow another reviewers suggestion and use seasoned salt.

Yum!  Very very tasty.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was the best burger.  My husband didn't even need any extra mayo or anything on the burger.  I also had one leftover burger and ate it for lunch the next day and it was just as delicious!  I'll be making this again VERY soon!

these were very tasty with just the right amount of basil. the oil does make them cook really fast though. i like well done and by 6 minutes on the george forman they were a little too dry. i will make again with shorter cooking time

I could not wait to make these after reading all the reviews and I followed recipe exactly but these had to be the worst burgers I ever had. The only thing I did different was cook them on my Gerge Foreman.My husband is not a picky eater at all and he even said they were horrible. The olive oil did make them juicier but they tasted dreadful. Maybe I'll use the olive oil concept and change the seasonings up completely.YUK!

I can't believe anybody could comment on the flavor of these other than saying they were absolutely wonderful.  I cooked them up on the George Foreman grill.  I doubled the recipe making 8 burgers and they came out perfectly.  My husband commented that they were the best burgers he ever tasted and we've had a lot!  People who said it was too much basil or the taste was overpowering must have just put too much on or they just have different tastes.  If you only mildly like basil then only put in a quarter of what is listed, as you definitely will taste the basil in these.

I made these burgers tonight and I loved them. My wife thought there was to much garlic, so the next time I make them for us I would only use 1 garlic clove.

I don't own a grill, as I live on a 3rd floor apartment, so I made these on the stove.  Maybe these would taste better on a grill.  I didn't see anything really all that spectacular about them.  I always season my burgers when I make them, and seem to get better flavor with fewer seasonings.  Not a bad recipe to try, but ifyou already season your meat when you cook burgers, this might be a dissapointment to you.

These are fabulous - the best homemade burgers I've ever had.  I grew up vegetarian and so find myself extra picky about my meat.  This is our permanent Bear Family burger recipe.

Based on previous reviews I used 1 tsp salt and that was fine.

Tried the recipe with both ground turkey and beef and they were very tasty! Sometimes turkey burgers can be a bit dry and the olive oil seems to keep them extra moist. Be sure to try them on a George Foreman Grill if you have one. If you like chopped onion in your burger add some for even more flavor! Thanks Chris for a great recipe!

I thought these were really good, but there wasn't a lot of added flavor.  I used fresh basil and I think next time I will add some more spices.  Good recipe, thanks.

Surprisingly excellent! I would reduce the salt a little, but even then it's not enough to reduce the rating from 5 stars. Used recipe to make both beef and turkey burgers (turkey burgers did not come out dry either, but that credit goes to my grilling hubs). Omitted olive oil in both burger types since I had  90% ground beef and 93% ground turkey. Both burgers held up well and came out great. Simple ingredients made me think they wouldn't come out so good in comparison to how we normally make our burgers, but we both surprisingly loved it!  Easy, simple, and delicious burgers! Thanks for reminding us simple is good!

I was surprised that a few simple ingredients made such a wonderful, moist and flavorful burger! I did use seasoned salt instead of regular, but followed recipe to a T otherwise. Thank you so much for the best burger I've made on the grill!

Tasted bland and meat lost all texture from being smooshed together with the olive oil.  My husband said, "It tastes like meatloaf."  However, it doesn't taste like my meatloaf, which has at least a dozen ingredients and keeps its texture.
I think that this is so popular because a person can get pretty soused while grilling them and they won't dry out.  So it's food that doesn't need much attention to prepare.  Also, if your guests are imbibing too, they won't notice anything other than you're feeding them burgers.     I gave it 2 stars  instead of 1 because it's an original concept, and it also has a place when socializing takes precedence over what's being served.

I gave this recipe to my fiance to make for me, since he is man, he grills *bang on chest*.  He absolutely loved them!  I don't know if he deviated from the recipe but mine was a little too salty for my liking.  But overall, it's good.

Love this burger.  It's my go to.  Most of the time I use 50% ground beef and 50% ground lamb.  Everything else the same as the recipe.  Try it,  It's unreal.

So easy and it only took about 20 minutes. I can make it and I'm only a kid. Even on a skillet it tastes just the same as a grill. Delicious and easy. And you know what you put in it. Five stars all the way.

Good burger. I only used 1 garlic clove, reduced the salt and pepper a bit. I added 1/2 egg to hold it together as I was barbecuing them. Fried red onions with mushrooms, cooked bacon, a fried egg, cheese and the burger in a bun. Tasty.

This is the only way I'll make burgers for my family.  We use organic ground turkey thigh/brest instead of beef, I've used Bison as well and each comes out top notch.  Since we are garlic fans..I add a little more garlic along the way..you can't go wrong with this recipe!

We just had these for the first time and they were quite the hit with my family.  I made them exactly how the recipe is written and I wouldn't change a thing.  My grill ran out of gas so I pan fried them, I can imagine they would be a lot better grilled.

I used shallot instead of garlic.  It has a mild onion/garlic flavor and I backed off the salt and used only 1 tablespoon.  I also ground some round steak which was pretty lean.

Made these tonight for supper and they are simply delicious!  I cut back on the EVOO to only 1 tablespoon  and decreased the salt to 1 teaspoon but kept everything else the same.  Totally juicy and tasty!  Looking forward to making them again very soon!

I made these burgers along with Wisconsin brats and the burgers were a hit!  I've made a lot if homemade burgers before trying to put the right spin on them but keeping it simple is the best. I cooked them over charcoal cuz that's how I roll and I really didn't measure anything but I know I prolly over doubled the garlic. This a great and easy recipe I'm gonna use from now on!  Thank you

We accidentally overcooked these burgers beyond our desired doneness, but they were still moist and delicious.  Looked for a recipe last minute as we were starting to prep and chose this because of the good reviews and because we had the ingredients in the kitchen.  SO glad we did.

I doubled the ingredients with 1lb turkey and 1lb beef. And only put half recommended amount of oil as suggested by others. Also used abode seasoning too. Son-in-law never ate turkey burger before and sais he loved it. When I told him it had turkey in it he was totally surprised. My goal is to make delicious and healthy foods. This recipe cover both.

I would consider myself a pretty fancy cook who makes pretty delicious food but one thing I could never make was burgers...until now! This recipe is EXCELLENT! Gone are the days of my meatloaf tasting burgers I tried to fancy up with too many things. This is the way a burger should taste. And it works well using ground chicken and turkey too! Thanks, Chris for the best burger recipe!

Be prepared for an ITALIAN burger!  I did halve the oil (dependant on the fat/meat ratio of your hamburger meat that you start with) and also the basil (skittish husband :) but they were great!  Don't even think about ketchup/mustard...go with mozz cheese and a little ragu sauce!

Fabulous! All five of my kids gave it 5 stars! I have never grilled burgers before - usually my husband or son does - and when I made these tonight I was given the job forever! Easy - delicious - juicy! 


I did add a splash of worcestershire and used about half the salt.

This was a great burger and my family loved it. I did not have dried basil so I substituted it with a 1/2 a teaspoon equal parts of thyme and oregano. I also sauteed onions and mushrooms. I agree with another reviewer this is not your ketchup/mustard type of burger. It was full of flavor no need for condiments in my opinion.

Loved it!  First time trying homemade burgers - added a tsp of Worcestershire (just because we love it) and left out the salt - added about half a teaspoon of salt right before putting burgers on the grill to avoid drying out the burgers.  Thanks for a great and unique recipe!!

This tasted like cooked ground beef. It has a week taste (except for pepper) . I think a burgers needs bread crumbs and eggs in the ingredients to be a burger. 3 stars coz my wife liked it.

This is similar to how I'd been making my burgers, but better. :)  The addition of the olive oil really helps keep the burgers juicy.  I like this blend of spices, though I did cut down on the amount of everything.  I'll be sticking with this recipe instead of my old way.  Thanks!

Wow!  These were amazing!  They were juicy and full of flavor, especially if you love basil.  I have never liked my burgers making them the traditional way.  My husband gave it a 12 out of ten- so a definite winner!

I was hesitant because it seemed like a lot of salt, oil and pepper but the reviews looked promising so I tried it.  These were the best home made burgers I've ever made.  My picky husband loved them too.  I didn't have burger in the house but I did have ground bison.  I cut the salt to 1 teaspoon because I'm watching my salt intake somewhat.  I cut the pepper to just 1 teaspoon because my husband supposedly hates pepper.  They still turned out fantastic and I think the addition of the olive oil compensated for my overly lean cut of bison.  This recipe is recipe number one in my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing.

Loved this burger. Combined it with my own recipe and it made a delicious juicy burger. Definitely will be making again. Put BBQ sauce on these and oh so mouthwatering.

This recipe is amazing! I sometime substitute ground turkey or ground pork, whatever kind of burger I'm feeling like, and they still turn out fantastic! Everyone who's tried them (regardless of which meat I use) has loved them!  I do use less salt (not quite half) and pepper (about half) but that's just my preference. 

Thanks for posting!

This was really tasty.  But I used fresh basil and fresh Italian parsley.  And used more basil and garlic and more black pepper then what was called for.  Added a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a touch of heat. Topped the burger with mozzarella; lettuce, tomato, cut fresh basil, and Aioli sauce.   Yum...delicious

These burgers were a pretty big hit with my family, save for my youngest who thought the pepper made them a little too spicy.  The only changes I made was substituting Worcestershire sauce for the olive oil to cut down of the fat and adding diced red onions.  Next time I will probably add more garlic and touch less basil.  Powdered onion soup might make a good addition or a substitute for the basil, too.

I thought these had excellent flavor.  I thought they were a little too oily so next time I will cut down on the olive oil.  I did not add any salt due to the other reviews about it being too salty and thought it was perfectly seasoned.

Really good burger! I loved the Basil, really different in a good way and I love garlic in everything so of course that was great too. I agree that the salt was a little overkill and will probably cut it in half next time but otherwise, two thumbs up!

I just made these a second time with two changes. First I used ground chuck rather than  ground beef. Second, I used 1/2 tsp of Accent instead of the salt. These changes bumped this burger from four stars to five!

These probably would have tasted very good if it weren't for how incredibly salty they were.  I should have gone with my instinct and cut the salt tremendously, at least in half.  The burgers were very tender and the garlic flavor (that I could decipher between salt granules) was good.  I would also cut the pepper down to at most 3/4tsp

Wow...best burgers ever! I used 2lbs of burger (93%), 2 cloves garlic, 2 tbs olive oil, only 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper, and upped the basil to 1 tsp. This gave me 5 perfect patties. Of course with garlic and basil, you can't expect these to be your regular steakhouse burgers, but they have such a nice mellow flavor that isn't all bbq sauce (which I so hate). I also topped them with slices of Tillamook cheddar cheese. Can't recommend these enough, and will make them as often as my family will let me!

We thought these were good.  The grill smoked a lot, which I think was probably because of the olive oil.  I would not cook them inside.  I will add additional seasoning next time.

I was so excited when I saw this as the "daily recipe" because it is one of our favorites.  We found it 3 years ago when we bought our new grill.  Since then we make these at least every month.  They work on indoor grills too.  We discovered that we wanted a bit more spice, so I dash in some cayenne pepper as well. I always make two batches - one beef (for him) and one turkey (for me).  Both are Muy Delicious!

Used bison burger, full amount of oil, no salt, double basil.  Absolutely out of this world with a slice of red onion, lettuce, dijon, mayonaise and cheese.

This burger is awesome!  My husband is the burger chef in our house and I encouraged him to make this recipe.  My boys said it was the best burger that they ever had!  I think I've convinced my husband that using recipes actually produces a better tasting meal.  I wouldn't change a thing in the ingredients, other than, we made the burger with Buffalo which was excellent.

Nothing special here, just a basic burger that doesn't even warrant a special recipe IMHO.

I made these burgers last night and they were wonderful!!  My fiance loved them as well and I got the thumbs up to make them again.  I did cut back on the garlic as it doesn't love me as much as I love it, but the burgers were still delicious.

This was OK, nothing special Though really. I definitly do not agree with some folks who said it was too flavorful. In my opinion this one needs to be kicked up a notch.

Great Burgers!!  Very easy recipe that produces a very tasty burger.  I cut back on the salt like the others suggested, but that was the only change I made.  I just made them 2 days ago and my son is already asking me to make them again!

This was a nice change from traditional s&p, garlic, worcestershire, and/or onion.  I cut the amount of salt and oil in half, because normally I don't add any.  Can't wait to try using fresh basil this summer!

Very tasty! I cut the salt down (1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt) and one tablespoon of olive oil. I love garlic, but don't recall ever using it for burgers. What was I thinking?! There's still 2 feet of snow in the backyard, so I cooked these for 2 minutes on the old George Foreman grill. SLAMMIN'!

actually 4 1/2. extra half point for ease! It's quick to add ingredients and put in my George Forman grill. I just cut back on the salt and pepper, seemed too much for our tastes. On the bun I added sauteed onions and mushrooms, lettuce and tomatoes. Juicy = yummy!

made them just like it stated and loved them.  I just prepared them to cook tomorrow night but I added about 1/8tsp of cayenne pepper because I like the kick.  We'll see how that compares.

The olive oil allows you to place directly on the grill without oiling it up beforehand. You definitely have to love the taste of basil because it is very strong in this recipe. Overall--simple and tasty.

I was so excited about this recipe, how easy it was, and the reviews it got.  So, I made turkey burgers and regular burgers, using this recipe.  First i tried eating a turkey burger.  It was okay, but I really didn't like it.  Thinking, maybe it just doesn't work well with Turkey, I tried a hamburger.  Did NOT like the taste at all!  My husband usually raves about my cooking and new recipes, saying "this is the best ____ ever".  He didn't this time.  Neither of us like the basil flavor at all.  Interesting, but will not ever make them again.

Everyone liked them and they were easy to make. The oil kept them moist, but also made more flare ups on the grill. Thanks!

I guess you need to use extra EXTRA lean beef. I used 80% lean ground chuck and just 1 Tbl olive oil per pound, and my entire grill was a flaming inferno within 4 minutes... I'll skip the oil altogether next time.

I made this recipe for company, and we all loved it (even the kids!). Don't know if it would work to not use as much oil, as having 16 burgers on the grill with all of that oil really made a smokey problem.  My husband had trouble with the smoke in his eyes, and the burgers were done a little more than we usually prefer.

These burgers were very juicy and delicious.  I prepared the hamburger early in the day so they would be more flavorful.  I didn't find the usual toppings to be a problem.  Thank you Gaven for sharing your recipe.

This was a good burger with very different flavor.  The garlic was overpowering, but I love garlic, so that was fine with me.  I agree with another poster that ketchup and mustard are not the right condiments for this burger.

This was a fantastic burger!  Not too different, which was what I was worried about.  My only problem was the salt, it didn't ruin the meat but next time I think I will go for a bit less.  Thank you!

Not a huge burger fan, but I have some Spanish friends who wanted to try something "American" so I made this. They loved them, and the other Americans at dinner raved about them as well. I plan to make them again :)

Best burgers I've put in my head in a long time.  Wonderful, killer flavor.  A touch on the salty side, I intend to reduce the salt by ~ 20%.  The olive oil does make them flare like crazy, but I love the flavor of it, so I really don't want to reduce the qty, but the fire is a bit annoying. :)  I grilled these with my smoke box going (gas grill) with a mix of 2/3rds mesquite and 1/3rd hickory.  I also added my secret Mediterranean weapon to the smoke box -- bay leaves.  I used 4, throw them in the box right when you put the meat on for a wonderful flavor/smell.

Great stuff Chris, and thanks for sharing!

I only give it three stars because of the basil. I thought it was way too strong! I used the 1/2 tsp. in 2.5 lbs of hamburger and it still dominated the taste of the burger. I liked the olive oil because it kept the burger from drying out and I always use garlic anyhow because it is soooo goood. lol

This is now our stand burger recipe.  Friends want to know why our burgers are so good.  We use season salt in place of regular salt.  We even made them up and frozen them for later.  What a wonderful burger recipe.

These burgers are fantastic!  Made them several times now and they are always a hit.  I recommend a "fancier" condiment than ketchup & mustard.  Mayonnaise does a good job, but I'm still researching a more robust/complimentary topping.  Either way, delicious!

Strange, off taste.  A bit dry.  Not sophisticated.
Changes:
* Added additional fresh basil
* Reduced salt as suggested in various reviews, but that was a mistake-- too bland.
* Added chopped onions.
Suggestions:
* Maybe try cayenne pepper....
* Salt as directed, don't bother with onions.

I was excited to try this, because it was so highly rated.  The burgers were strong-tasting, and although I don't mind a lot of flavor (love salsa and bbq sauce), the taste reminded me of meat-loaf.  Like other reviewers mentioned, It doesn't work well with ketchup.  I had an awesome burger at "The Nook" in St. Paul MN called "The Alumni". I am on a mission to find something that tastes like it.  In the burger's defense, my wife loved it.  It didn't taste bad, but definitely not what I was looking for.

Oh man, that was amazing! I scaled the recipe down to one serving but then doubled the spices, and added a dash of wochestershire and a little mustard. Incredible! I'm doing Atkins so instead of a bun I ate the burger with sliced cucumbers, and the burger was so good I hardly missed the bun! These are a new lunch favorite.

Tasty, had a real bite to it. I used kevnbro's suggestions & served these burgers on focaccia with a slice of mozzarella. Served with Antipasto. Keep it Italian, this won't be good as a 'normal' American burger. I followed LILBITANDME's suggested as to forming the burger & no balls on the side! I will make again but I might cut down the pepper & salt a tad next time. Thanks.

This was my second time to make these.  We all enjoyed them.  Last time I used basil, this time we were going to put green chilis on them and pepper jack cheese, so I used cilantro as my dry seasoning, otherwise everything was the same.  They were very good!

My husband wanted hamburgers for Father's day supper, so I thought this would be a nice change from frozen patties. Slightly modified - used Hy's Seasoning Salt instead of salt and pepper, and added a few shakes of onion powder.  These didn't knock us out, but they were great and will probably make them again.

used a bit less evoo and a bit more garlic.  Added a couple of tbsp of finely chopped red onion.  Made burgers smaller, more "kid freindly".  Very Nice.

Best burgers I have tasted. My little boy was not crazy about the flavor, but I will definitely make it again when we BBQ. I used 97% lean ground beef and with the addition of the olive oil the meat was very moist. I made the recipe exactly as it was stated and next time I will only add 1 tsp of salt.

I rated these a 4 but they are an easy 5 if you cut the salt way back! I only added 1/2 tsp of salt and that was plenty. They have great flavour, the garlic is fantastic paired up with the basil ... we will definitely be making these again.
The oil was good in the burgers, I was kind of skeptical while putting the mixture together but it keeps the burgers nice an juicy.
Thanks!!

We used bison and kaiser rolls instead of beef and buns. We also toasted the rolls on the grill and topped with American cheese. We aren't sure that if it was actually beef the taste would have been all that different. We did enjoy this however. We used a pound and only made 2 burgers but it could have been 3. 4 burgers only if you use small rolls.

Good burgers...I think I may have used too much garlic but that never hurt anybody! However, the recipe says it would make 4 burgers but I think three would be a better size. By the time they cook down they are 4 small patties and wouldn't do much good on a real hamburger bun.

The olive oil makes these burgers juicy!  I used the amount of basil the recipe called for and it was a bit strong - maybe I'll use a little less next time.

Delicious!  These are just great, the oly thing I added, was a little onion powder to the meat mixture.  I eat Burgers, bread and condiment FREE, so I am always looking for a good flavorful recipe, I topped these with a little shredded Mozzarella, sliced roma tomato, and slices of onion.  Absolutely YUMMY! Will use this recipe again and again.

This recipe is delicious!  I made it exactly as suggested except that I cooked it on a George Foreman Grill.  It came out flavorful, fragrant, and juicy.  I topped it with mozzarella cheese.  I think it would be even better with mozzarella, romaine lettuce, and tomato.  Yummy!

I've made these burgers twice now and everyone loves them. I have never had burgers disappear so quickly or so many people ask me for the recipe. Will definitely keep this one in my recipe box. I don't think I can ever eat plain burgers again.

Like another reviewer, I wanted to keep this recipe “Italian.”  I sprinkled some shredded Mozzarella cheese on top of the burger along with sautéed mushrooms and yellow peppers.  I didn’t have any Italian bread so I had to use a hamburger bun, but I spread spaghetti sauce on the bottom and added some more to the top of the burger.  I also sprinkled some additional basil and some Italian seasoning on the sauce.  Next time I will sauté onion and garlic instead of the pepper.  Wine goes well with this--I served this with a Shiraz.  Great recipe!

These were good, but not as good as I was expecting.  Perhaps we grilled them too long?? They were a bit dry.  I will try making them again, however, since so many people love this recipe.

I wanted to try something a little different than our usual hamburger recipe.  At first I thought the Olive Oil and spice mixture was strange for a hamburger recipe, but it turned out very good!  Going with the whole italian burger theme, I added some parmesean cheese and just a shake of italian breadcrumbs.  Will make these again, thanks!

A great recipe!  Awesome for people on low carb diets because there is no bread or starch filling.  Just add 1/4 cup of chopped onion and a tablespoon of worchestire sauce into the mix and this burger is perfect!

These were ok.  WE used less oil by half and i'm glad we did.  At the last minute I realized I didn't have any garlic so i had to make due with garlic powder and substitued about 2 garlic cloves worth of tinyly minced onion.  Overall they were bland and boring.

WOW!!!  I made this earlier this week and we loved it!!  I only used 1 tsp. salt and 1 Tbsp. oil which was plenty.  Since I didn't feel like going outside (loooong day), I pan fried them as & served the w/ brown rice and green beans.  The patties were so good that I saved them to eat last. We are putting them on the grill tonight & will serve them on buns.  I can hardly wait. DEEE-LICOUS!!!!  Thanks Chris.

sorry...didn't care for these burgers.  i found them to be way too oily and i only used 1 tablespoon of oil for 1-1/2 lbs. of ground beef!  here's my tip...if you want juicy hamburgers skip the oil and just buy 80/85% lean ground beef.

Burger was good, moist and stayed together well. It was a bit spicy for me, but I will try it again with less basil and smaller garlic cloves.

Can't really rate this as I made lots of changes (oregano instead of basil, onion, paprika and celery salt added) but I'll keep this recipe in my recipe box since it doesn't use bread crumbs. An evidence that they're not necessary to make a good burger!

Excellent flavor! I only cook with ground turkey, and the flavor was very complimenting! The garlic and basil tasted so well with the condiments - lettuce, avocado, tomato, ketchup/spicy mustard, and red onion. All the ingredients I had on hand, expecially the basil which I grow in my garden. I will make it again!

I am giving this 4 stars because two of us were not that thrilled and gave it 3 stars and the other two loved it and gave it 5 stars.  My husband really liked the seasoning but I was not thrilled with the basil taste.

After reading the reviews, I only made two changes -- I cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon (used Kosher salt), and I used a light version of virgin olive oil.  You have to go with the intended cooking method of grilling to fully enjoy the taste that this burger will render.  Chris, thank you so much for great twist from a plain old burger!

I added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce to the mix.  I found the burger to be a little bit too garlicy, and I really like garlic.  I'd probably reduce to one clove next time.  I did like the burgers, because they were so quick and easy to make!  I'll most likely make this again!

This was a very good recipe.  Very moist burgers.  I only rated 4 stars - cause they didn't bring fireworks to the Jillhass household - but we ate them all up.

This recipes was awesome! The only thing I did differently was us 1 tbsp of olive oil instead of 2. They grilled up perfectly! I will make these again.

Really good!  I left out the olive oil, only used 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t black pepper.  If I had added all the salt and pepper, it would have been too much for our families taste.  They were perfect this way!

These were edible, the prominent flavor being black pepper.  Nothing I am eagerly awaiting to make again.

The recipe was great, a little strong for the child, (7 y/o) but Mom and I loved it. We will make it again but scale back on salt and pepper a little.
