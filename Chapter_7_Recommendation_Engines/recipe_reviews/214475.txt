You don't have to use fresh rosemary.  I actually submitted the recipe with dried rosemary leaves.  You may find that you like using dehydrated minced garlic instead of garlic powder, or a half teaspoon of each. Also, I find it easiest to put the wedges in a bowl after they've baked, sprinkle them with the seasoning and toss until coated.  Enjoy!

Simplicity at its best.  While I'm sure these baked fries would be wonderful using the listed dried herbs, my garden is abundantly full, so I chose to mince fresh instead ~ rosemary, thyme, parsley, oregano, basil, sage and dill.  Finishing the dish with a light sprinkling of salt, pepper and garlic powder made these fries sublime.  Many thanks to HottKoko81 for the submission.

I made a few changes and it was AWESOME.  I didn't have any cooking spray, so I used olive oil on parchment paper and recoated the potatoes with more olive oil.  I also didn't have garlic powder, so I used fresh garlic.  I didn't want to eat the garlic raw, so after the 22 min of cooking time suggested, I put the herbs and galic on potatoes and broiled them (they were not crispy yet because I used more then 4 potatoes).  They were so good, I will make these again for sure!

These were delicious!  I only had large baking potatoes so I used those which made the fries a little large, but still tasty (cooked a little longer in the microwave and in the oven to make up for the size).  My kids didn't love all the herbs but it would be easy enough just to leave theirs plain next time.  I love all the mix of flavors and will be making them again for sure!

Very good recipe.  I made this as a side for our Easter dinner and it was a great substitute to mashed potatoes.  I think I may have liked a bit more garlic, but that's a matter of personal taste!

My husband loves french fries, but I get so bored with them...these tasty homemade fries are wonderful!  I don't change a thing but to double the cooking time because I like them very cripy.

I made this recipe because I like the quickness of it since the potatoes go into the microwave to give them a head start. I didn't like putting the seasonings on at the end of baking. Most didn't stick well and I had a huge amount left over after sprinkling. There's another baked fries recipe on this site that I usually use that I'll be sticking with instead. Won't be making this one again.

I used dried rosemary and this recipe was BOMB! So simple and so flavorful! Served with leftover fry sauce that I had on hand. Will definitely make again! :)

Used baby red skins that I cut into chunks and used all dried herbs since I had no fresh rosemary on hand. Baked 375 for about an hour and kept tossing so they got crispy. Served with Spicy Fry Sauce from this site for dipping.....yummy!

Another wonderful baked fries recipe! I liked the cooking method as well as the spice mixture. I've never put the spice mixture on after the potatoes cooked, but it works quite well.
