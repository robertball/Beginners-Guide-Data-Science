The crust was really good! You have to keep turning or they burn easily. Thanks for the interesting lunch!

these are so good! I chose to make them a little healthier. I baked them in the oven. Heres what I  did: 
1.mix everything expect oil, wood stick, and hotdogs (use only 8 hotdogs) . Follow step2 . Cut hot dogs into thirds. 
2.Spray cup cake tins with non stick sprayor line with paper lined muffin cups. Scoop batter into the cups . Place 1/3 hot dog into each muffin.
3.Bake at 400 Â° until golden brown. Serve right away.

If you are wondering what Pluto Dogs taste like, I can describe it in Texas terms...it is a fried kolache , that looks like a corn dog.

These were quite good! I'm not a fan of cornbread so I was looking for a battered hotdog recipe that didn't have the corn bread batter. For this, I didn't have any self rising flour, but it worked fine with just using all-purpose flour. Everything else I left the same. I just wanted to use one package of hotdogs so I changed the yield to 8 and there was still a little batter left over. I ended up cutting the hotdogs into 4 pieces and skewering them with toothpicks. The batter was a little runny so I had to add about an extra 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it and I also dipped the hotdogs in flour before dipping them in the batter. that really helps the batter stick fairly well to the hotdogs. I will definitely make these again!!
