I was really looking forward to this "cake." All seemed to be going well, but the 45 min cooking time is way too long. I checked it at 39 min when I noticed a slight burnt smell. The edges are burned. I salvaged the middle, but it is slightly dry. It probably should come out of the oven between 30-35 minutes. The flavor was good when I added some ice cream on top.
