We liked this very much. I went directly by the recipe with the exception of no dill as I didn't have any on hand. This was my first time cooking buckwheat and we really enjoyed it.  We served it as a side dish with grilled salmon.  We had some left-over so the next day I added some chopped artichoke bottoms and a bit more fresh mint to perk it up and it was still great !  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

This is delicious! Dill, mint, and cumin go well together. Thank you for the lovely salad.
