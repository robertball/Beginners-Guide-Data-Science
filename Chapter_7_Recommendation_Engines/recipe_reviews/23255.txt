This recipie is a HUGE success everytime I make it. I have also added baby shrimp and green onion to give a little kick. A little hot sauce doesn't hurt either.  I have made it repeatedly and don't get invited to parties unless I promise to make it! Good job!

Excellent!  Gourmet taste with simple prep.  I used 1 1/2 cans of crabmeat, since fresh is difficult and expensive to come by here in southwest Missouri. Thanks for sharing-- this will become standard appetizer fare in our house.

Absolutely wonderful hot *or* cold! I recommend going with scallions (with a bit of the green for color) over minced onion but other than that, it's great. Even my sister who eats no seafood at all asked for the recipe after I made it  over the holidays. I may add roasted peppers next time for even more presentation oomph. Oh, and even with Neufchatel, it was creamy rich.

I made some changes since I didn't have prepared horseradish or cocktail sauce or almonds in.  LOL I highly recommend what I came up with!  Absolutely delicious!!  Saute 1/3 cup diced onions and peppers in 2tbsp. butter, add 1 minced clove of garlic after when they are soft.  Add a good splash of lemon juice and worstershire sauce, 1-2 oz white wine & sherry, reduce, add cream cheese.  Stir as it melts, add 1 tbsp.mayo, 3pieces of toasted bread(no crusts) ripped into crumbs, cayenne and black pepper,salt,tabaco,chili powder,more worsteshire and lemon juice. Gently fold in 1 can of lump crab. Grease small shallow dish, sprinkle w/ lemon juice and reg. bread crumbs, dot w/ butter. 350 degrees covered for 20min., uncover another 10min. or till top is toasty brown.  This definitely made up for my missing flavor ingredients!! Could be eaten as a main dish even.

This is a perennial Christmas favorite. We serve cool, without almonds. Use toasted thinly sliced baguettes spinkled with Old Bay for dipping! Excellent!

This is amazing ! I used a spicy seafood sauce, & extra hot horseradish. Instead if onion, I used diced green onions. My husband loved it. We had it with tortilla chips, which worked really well. Thank you for this great recipe!

This was one great crab dip!  I doubled the recipe for a large gathering and received rave reviews.  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the crab for a meatier dip, and added several tablesppons of Old Bay (I love that stuff!) to the mix.  I also added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and a little extra cocktail sauce.  I used a prepared creamy horseradish spead, as that's what I had on hand, and it worked very nicely.  Instead of almonds (store was OUT?) I sprinkled Old Bay on top.  I baked for about 50 minutes since my dip came out of the fridge and I doubled the recipe.  Very nice, this will be a great go-to for football season and the holidays.  Sincere thanks for sharing!

I thought it was way too sweet, and couldn't eat it.  The rest of the family enjoyed it, though.  Maybe next time I will try chili sauce instead of the cocktail sauce.

very easy to prepare & tasty!
I didn't top with the almonds, & added a dash of old bay.
If you need to save time you can also microwave on a lower power level instead of baking in the oven.

I read many of the reviews before I made this dip. I added a bit extra onion and double the cocktail sauce.  I also added wasabi instead of the regular prepared horseradish.  I think the wasabi added just the right amount of extra kick without the tang of "hot sauce". If I make it again, I will double the crab.  All over everyone loved it!  It only served 4 of us!

So easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly because I like to make them as the authors submit them before I tweak them the next time. This recipe turned out so tasty, just as it is. Served it with "Pita Chips" off this site. Yummy!

Made it many, many times!  Always a hit!  It was a 4/5 with the cocktail sauce and a 5/5 without!  (I use a pie plate instead of a casserole dish mostly just for presentation)

This is AWESOME. I switched out the cocktail sauce out with Frank's, as I had that on hand and I wanted it spicy. 
I sauteed the onion in a little butter to bring out the flavor and to make them soft before I added it to the dip. Amazing flavor. Loving it. I served it with wheat thins.

Great base for a crab dip.  I used 1/2 lb crab meat instead of 1/4, and added cheese and a can of corn.  I think that the corn added some crunch and thickened it up a bit.  When I make it again, I think I will use more almonds- I liked the added texture.

This dip is fantastic!!  I used light cream cheese, canned crab and served it with crackers.  The cocktail sauce gave it a nice kick!!  This will  now be a staple for all parties.  Loved it!!!

I had no cocktail sauce so I substituted Cholula (and doubled the quantity of it). I also squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the top before serving. RAVE reviews from all.  Great, easy, crowd-pleasing recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I followed others suggestions: added Old Bay, used scallions.  Baked for about 45 minutes, served hot.  Husband said “best crab dip I have EVER eaten”.

This is a really good recipe. I accidentally used minced garlic instead of minced onion and I didn't have horseradish but I did have spicy cocktail sause. It turned out great. Very easy recipe!

Good, but not amazing. Probably won't make it again, but glad I tried it.

Made this for New Years Eve and it was excellent.  I used one small can of lump crab meat, and green onions instead of white.  Also, just for personal preference but probably not necessary I added a bit of parmesan, finely shredded mozzarella and a dash of seafood seasoning.  Turned out fantastic!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I left out the almonds but I did put in EXTRA cocktail sauce and horseradish.  I also added a splash of hot sauce to spice it up some.  This got pretty good reviews from my friends and coworkers.

This appetizer was a huge winner at our new years eve party!  I did add the old bay seasoning as suggested by another review.  A real nice blend with a little bit of kick!

These are realy good, but a little too spicy for me.  I love spice, but have that GERD...Love it. If you like a little spice you will love it.
