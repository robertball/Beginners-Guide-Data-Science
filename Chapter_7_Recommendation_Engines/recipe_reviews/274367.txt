I'm going back and forth with the rating.  It really does need more modification.  First, I was interested in this because it didn't have a lot of fat in the dressing, but that's the first thing you notice, and the vinegar tends to be too aggressive without the fat.  The ratio of noodles to other "stuff" was also a little high.  Mods were as follows:  Added 2 TBSP Canola oil,  Added 4 ozs. Edamame, Added 2 TBSP Soy sauce (used lite so that might have been why), about a tsp of fresh grated ginger, about 2 TBSP toasted sesame seeds.   If a next time, will cut back on the pasta and add celery and/or bok choy, more onion, increase overall dressing by 50% with added oil.  I would also use the second piece of chicken.

loved it...

I did the non-chicken version......simply.... GREAT.
I make big batches, and add the nuts & leaves only to the amounts to be served.... and store the rest for later.

My wife does not like peppers.  Having said that, I used somewhat less than called for the recipe.  She called it a "B" which is OK but not her most honoring.  I thought it was great and, although not an easy recipe in terms of prep time, was delicious.  Maybe some roasted sesame seeds would have added to it but probably would not have made the grade for my wife.  Having said that, I am looking forward to leftovers and doing it again.  I used #6 fettuccine noodles. The sauce was delicious!

This was a delicious cold noodle salad for a hot summer evening.  I love Asian salads, and this did not disappoint.  Dressing is delicious , I made as written with exception of adding a little prepared ginger to the mix.  Next time I make it I’m going to 1 1/2 the dressing, I’m a saucy person.  I like the previous reviewers idea of adding edamame.  I did not add mint, just personal preference. This was a trial run for an upcoming block party, I’m going to put this in individual Chinese take out containers with chopsticks!  Thanks for another great recipe CJ!
