I kind of have a tiff, with this recipe. Because it was not specified that the chicken should be under indirect heat my 2 chickens caught on fire! Because of the beer (alcohol) when the juices ran out it caught onto the heat and thus created combustion. Not fun. In other similar recipes it does say to "spread the coals to the outer edge" or "place chicken in indirect heat". Well, not to put all the blame on you, because others were able to figure this out on their own, but it should be clear that the chicken be put in indirect heat in this recipe as well. I was so exceited and now I have two carcuses in my trash can. (almost humerous, give it time...)

This truly is an awsome recipe that I have used many times.  The only variations that I have come up with are stuffing an onion or potato in the neck cavity to prevent the steam from evaporating and also adding water to the bottom of a foil pan to prevent the underside of the chicken from getting too black when the grease splatters.  I have also rubbed the outside of the chicken with rotisserie spices and added a pop up breast timer to ensure doneness.

I found two recipes for the beer can chicken on here, couldn't decide which was better, so I made them both.  The other one was only poultry seasoning on the outside and beer in the can.  This  recipe turned out producing a more moist chicken.  I don't know if it was the ingredients - I made one change to recipe.  My beer can opening came very close to the neck opening and I was worried that the beer wouldn't evaporate into the main body of the chicken... so I cut the beer can about 1/3 of the way down for this recipe.  Also, I roasted this in the oven- 450 for the first 20 minutes to crisp the skin and keep juices in..and then 375 for the next hour and a half.  Very tasty, I will use this recipe from now on!

I baked the chicken instead of grilling it, but the beer and simple seasonings worked great. You could fully taste the juicy chicken.  I was weary of the beer but the beer only enhances the chicken taste.  Yum.

This was unbelievably GOOD!  I saw similar recipes in the past and I thought "This just isn't right!"  Was I wrong!  The best whole chicken I have ever made!  I bought a three pack of whole fryer chickens at Costco.  I did make some changes to the recipe.  I made a dry rub of paparika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and a dash of cinnamon.  Omitted the mustard.  I rubbed the outside of the chicken and sprinkled inside the cavity.  I put the chickens into zip lock bags and left them overnight.  Lined the grill with aluminum foil.  Omitted the Italian dressing, just used the can of beer.  Took about a couple of hours on med heat on the gas grill.  Covered top with aluminum foil when it got brown enough.  Meat thermometer is useful.  The whole family just raved!  Juicy meat, crispy, tasty skin.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

This was the best way I have made chicken on the grill!  I did 2 chickens weighing about 3-1/2 lbs. each.  One I smothered in poultry seasoning and the other with the mustard.  I grilled them for 1-1/2 hours and they were falling off the bone.  Just a quick tip, place your chickens on the beer while you are at the grill.  If you do it in the kitchen and then try to take them out on a platter you may have a hard time keeping them steady.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!  I pour out half of the beer and refill with cooled, melted butter.  I use a spicy rub with paprika, crushed garlic, salt, pepper and cayenne.  I set the barbecue on low and slow cook it for about 3-1/2 hours.  Melts in your mouth with a crusty skin.

Oh wow! What a super chicken!. No fuss, no muss. After coating the chicken with the mustard, I also seasoned the outside and inside with garlic and onion powder and some black pepper. We stood it on the pan, threw it on the grill and two hours later we had a golden, juicey bird just begging to be enjoyed. Try it, you can't go wrong!

This was the best chicken I have made on the grill. It was so moist and flavorful.
It also was entertaining to see the chickens(I did two at a time) cooking standing on
the beer cans. I have a gas grill and cooked it on medium heat with disposable
small roasting pans under them. Two cooking took 1 1/2 hrs. I would recommend you
try this!!!

THIS WAS EXCELLENT! ADDED CRUSHED GARLIC CLOVES TO BEER AND A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR TO CREAMY DIJON.
aLSO COVERED ENTIRELY WITH ALUMINUM FOIL UNTIL LAST 15 MINUTES THEN JUST LEFT TOP COVERED BECAUSE IT BROWNED UP FIRST. REMOVED FROM GRILL WHEN THE REST WAS BROWNED. PERFECT!!!

This is our favorite grilled chicken...I season the inside and out side of the chicken with Caribbean Jerk Seasoning and Lemon Pepper.  Great taste and soooo moist.

The idea was great but I cut an onion in half and stuffed it as far inside the chicken as I could and then added the bear can.  I added butter to the bear(another review)and just rubbed the chicken  with garlic, lawry's, pepper.  My family really loved it!!

There is a beer can chicken holder that makes it much easier, I got mine at wal-mart.  We always put an onion at the neck of the chicken to keep in the heat and add a little extra flavor.

Excellent chicken - very juicy.  When my kids - 13, 8 ,6, & 1 years old - all like it, it must be good!!  It made everyone laugh when I brought the chicken out to the BBQ.  Definitly use a disposable tray or line yours with lots of tin foil.  I had to throw mine away because I didn't.

Absolutely delicious!  I did not do it on the grill, as it is January and I live in Wisconsin... so I roasted it in the oven instead.  Actually, I completely changed up the recipe and just used what I had on hand, but I still wanted to rate it because I had never made a beer-butt chicken and both my fiance and I loved it.  If you haven't tried this method, do so... you won't be disappointed.  The chicken comes out so juicy and flavorful, and you can flavor the chicken any way you would like by varying what you add to the beer can and how you season the outside.  If you roast it in the oven like I did, I recommend patting the chicken dry with paper towels and generously seasoning the outside with salt and pepper or a rub.  I also added some fresh parsley to the beer, as well as various dried herbs.  Finally, I capped the top of the chicken with a halved lemon to keep the moisture in and add another element of flavor.  For extra crispy skin, preheat the oven to 425-450, and roast for 15-30 minutes this way, then lower the temperature to 350.

I'm baking the chicken in the oven at this very moment, since i don't have a bbq grill. I have no idea how it tastes but it smells sooooo good that i needed to tell you!!! Made a few changes. I used chicken breast, gave it a rub with garlic powder, paprika, red/white/black pepper mixture, salt and olive oil. Let in the fridge for about 2 hours. Then made the "italian restaurant-style salad dressing I" i found at this site (good, but made it a little bit thicker and added more garlic though). Made a cut on one side of the chicken breast and rubbed with salad dressing the inside. Omitted the mustard and added an extra garlic clove, chopped onion and mushrooms. I will tell you later how it turns out!!!!....... 
WOW!!!!!!! Extremely tasty and tender!!!!!!! Highly recommended!!!!  I had to tell you that i've tried to make this recipe again but using pork tenderloin and it's soooo good!!! since i'm the onlyone who likes chicken at home and wanted my family to try this, i had to use a different meat and i assure you this is amazing!!!! The process was exactly the same but i marinated the meat with paprika, garlic powder,.... for 12 hours. Outstanding!! :)

This chicken turned out quite moist but needed some more flavor.  I would recommend adding some spices to the mustard.  Also, make sure you use a disposable pan because it will get ruined.

This chicken was fun to cook. Kids loved it! I got great reviews on this dish.. my husband said he's never tasted such a great chicken. We all loved cooking it and stuffing the beer can in the cavity of the chicken. Great!

Very good. I used the oven as it was too cold outside when I did this recipe. I just lowered the cooking rack, and added some water into the roasting pan where I placed the beer into the chicken on a nifty "beer can chicken" rack I found at my local supermarket. I even ended up running out of water as I didn't check it - which was fine. As the beer kept it very moist!!!

This was my first whole chicken on the grill and this recipe was easy and delicious.I added a whole portabello mushroom cap on top to keep in the moisture.I also used some hickory woodchips for a little smokey flavor.

This turned out good.  I was a little skeptical about the amount of mustard used, but it gave the chicken a nice flavor.  I made this along with the Beer Butt Chicken and had to cut the cooking time a little short since we were in a hurry.  It wasn't as tender as we would have liked but the flavor was good and they smelled terrific while cooking.  We impressed a lot of people with the cooking process.  Thanks Freemans

This is also incredible with white wine in place of the beer. I like to use homemade dry italian dressing mix instead of wet for a kickier flavor. One of the best tasting chicken recipes we've ever had.

I don't have a bbq grill, so i made this chicken in the oven.  I seasoned the chicken before adding the mustard, and added a few seasonings in the beer can as well... the chicken was very tender, but i thought it lacked some flavor. It was good, but I don't think I'd make it again.

As another reviewer stated it was good, juicy too, but there wasn't much in the flavor dept. Next time I will add more seasonings and use a stronger beer.

I didn't think this tasted much different from regular baked chicken, but the fact that it was EASY helped :)  I added garlic powder, onion salt, rosemary, and cajun seasonings to the mustard before spreading it on.  I also added spices to the beer can.  Will definitely make this again

The chicken stayed very moist. A good way to roast a chicken. Next time I will coat the bird with some spices before covering with mustard.

This is one of the simplest recipes I've tried with such great results!!!  The chicken was VERY moist and juicy.  My husband and kids (toddlers) loved it which definately means it's a keeper.  I didn't make any changes other than coat the chicken with poultry seasoning.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be making this again and again!

We have tried this recipe before, but we have never used the italian dressing, I think it sounds good.  Instead of the mustard, I think I will try cajun spices and garlic.  Thanks for having this recipe in print.  I believe this is the best way to cook a whole chicken.

I have done this receipe and and it is so funny for one and the kids love it!! That is the best part because normally when you grill a chicken it becomes bone dry and a bit unappetizing to eat but this receipe stays soooooooo moist.. and usually when we cook it we do at least 2.. one with just salt & pepper for the kids and one with garlic, cajun seasonings or whatever you want for the grown-ups.  We do not use italian dressing though and that makes it even easier. and yes the cans will support the birds.. Kids think it is very comical!!!

This sounds like a most interesting recipe and I'd love to try it,,,but! Steps one and two are the same so it doesn't make sense....please resubmit soon....and is it really possible to balance all the chicken on the beer can???

Been doing these for years and always a hit. Only thing I do different spray the skin with cooking spray. This will make the skin turn out the best you have ever eaten. I do it if its on the smoker or grill for Chicken skin.

I have made this a number of times. However, I take a good swallow of the beer, then add 2 ounces of Jack Daniels or other bourbon into the can. Set it on the BBQ grill, and soon, you'll have a great tasting chicken.

Delicious! Also used the onion half on top of the beer can (Budweiser), as suggested by other reviewers. Did not hold well for next day leftovers, but well worth it if you can finish a whole chicken in one sitting.

After my first try I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke to the beer. Gave it a much different taste. Oh, by the way don't drink the beer after done cooking! ;-)>
