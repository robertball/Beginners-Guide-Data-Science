We love this recipe and make it with whatever fruit or preserves I have on hand.  I put the 6 sandwiches in my casserole dish pour the egg mixture over it and bake about 25 to 30 minutes at 350Â°.  You can even leave in refrigerator overnight and bake in the morning.  Absolutely delicious.

I used fresh baked bread and farm fresh eggs and fruit from my local market instead and it was amazing! Just make time to let it settle and have a tea afterwards :)

My family loved this. I used peaches instead of pineapple so the filling was 'peaches and cream'. No need for the preserves on top, I just diced more fresh peaches and dusted with powdered sugar. This was surprisingly easy to make.

Kids loved them!  Did not try the apricot sauce, we used blueberry syrup. Next time will use a different white bread with more strength but over all really good.

I had better luck with stale french bread(the wonder bread was too soft and gushy). We used coconut syrup recipe from this website and it was a tropical breakfast treat. I'll bet banana slices with the cream cheese spread would be good also.

I loved the idea of this recipe... I changed a few things because I dint have a few ingredients..
Instead of vanilla-honey, instead of picans-peanuts, instead of half and half -milk, instead of pineapple chunks -i used preseved pineapple spread, and last instead of apricot -i used Papaya preserved. Ohhhhhh and y stuffed my frenchtoast wt deli ham too. Yeaaaa Amazingly Goood!

As is this recipe would NOT work for us. There is WAY too much cream cheese mixture. And the apricot syrup is WAY too sweet. I used french bread instead of sliced bread and it held up pretty well. I ate one sandwich with the apricot syrup and thought I might get sick from the sweetness. I tried another with plain maple syrup and it was MUCH better. My kids even said that it hurt their teeth. Thanks for the idea, but this doesn't work for us.

Spread filling on both sides and add layer of banana slices: holds together and definately adds to finished product.  Used homemade hot blueberry sauce for topping. This is not overly sweet either.
