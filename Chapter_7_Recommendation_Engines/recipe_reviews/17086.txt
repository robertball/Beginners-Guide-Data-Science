Very quick, very easy and very hearty. I replaced the coconut with extra oats and used it as a crust for apple pie. Very good, everyone loved it.

Not bad at all.  More difficult to mold than our typical pie crust - I added about 4 tbsp of water total to help with that.  It's important to press it into the pan thin, because my first one came out with some pretty thick points.

Obviously not as good as your traditional shortening&butter crust, but sacrificed taste is worth the health advantage.

Will definitely make again.

This is excellent.  Don't forget to grease the pan a little first - the 1st one I made stuck a little.  I made a bumbleberry pie and used a crumb topping.  Came out amazingly!  This is the only crust recipe I will use from now on.  Would work as a bottom for squares too.

This is a great recipe for those of us  on the whole grain kick. I used whole wheat for the flour and needed to double the water, and I left out the coconut,then I rolled it out and used it as the top for a pot pie. It was Scrumptious! The whole family loved it. Can't wait to try it on something else.

This pie crust was so incredibly delicious.  Very easy to make.  I used it as is and also without coconut (with extra oats) and it turned out great both times.  Even after a few days the crust has held up after being refrigerated and was not mushy.  I will definitely keep experimenting with this crust and different fillings.  Thanks!

A lot of people don't know that coconut is not recommended for those with high cholesterol, so  may not be healthy for all.

I loved it! I left out the coconut and added extra oats.  I also ground the oats into a flour like consistancey and added a tablespoon of sugar.  I will make this again.

Yummy, yummy! I added a total of 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, along with a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teas cinnamon, 1/4 teas salt and 2 tbl of brown sugar. I sprayed a 9x13 glass pan with cooking spary and pressed the crust in and baked it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes before pouring in my favorite apple pie filling and baking it until the apples were tender. This warm with a scoop of vanilla was incredible. My kids who are not huge apple pie fans said this was one of the top 2 desserts they have tasted!

We thought this crust was wonderful. I bake lots of pies and was amazed at the quality and taste of this crust. I was looking for something that didn't use lard, butter or shortening, but still made a good pie. I'm glad to say I found it with this recipe. A+

Tried this with a pumpkin pie filling without the coconut.  It wasn't bad.  I liked it better the second day perhaps because I was getting used to it.  Will try again with appples.   I give it an A for effort as pie crusts usually are about 1500 calories.

This pie crust really has a fantastic texture. Instead of using just vegetable oil, we swapped half the oil for butter. It added a nice finish. Love it! Will definitely make it again.

Very good. I added a little bit of brown sugar for some extra flavor. Definitely recommend. I made it with low-fat pumpkin pie and pumpkin cream pie.

Excellent substitution for traditional pie crust! I was making a blackberry-peach pie and didn't have any butter for our usual pie crust so I tried this one. It was delicious! I figured it wouldn't work as a top pie crust so I ended up making some crumble topping and made more of a fruit cobbler instead.  Worked great!

This crust is very good. I usually add a little extra coconut to sweeten it a bit. Also, I make extra to make a crumb topping. Makes a pretty good apple pie. Low fat.

I found a much better method with this pie crust. I wanted to make a quiche so I excluded the coconut and added more oats and flour, which I blended the oats to make oat flour. Then instead of 2 Tbsp of ice water, I did about 6-8, i just kept adding more until just right when I could roll a ball. I then took a rolling pin and rolled it out like a real pie crust instead of just pressing it into the pan, so it made it even, and in doing so it even had flaky layers like a real pie crust! This had so much less fat, and made the best quiche ever!

I have to admit I wasn't sure about a "healthy" pie crust, but this was very tasty!  I made it with a banana cream pie and it was great.  Can't wait to try it with an apple pie!

Turned out great with a pumpkin pie.  For me, nothing beats the real full fut pastry crust, but I don't know how to make that kind anyway.  This was a great alternative.

I made this with a Egg Nog Custard pie for Thanksgiving and it turned out great!  My in-laws loved it too.  It's a bit flakey, but has a very unique taste and texture.  I'll use this recipe again and again because it was so easy to make.

So yummy! This crust has a great texture and is perfect if you are trying to avoid hydrogenated fats AND saturated fat.

I didn't tell my fiends, who don't like coconut, about the crust ingredients, but they liked it anyway.  Though, I agree that it was a bit sweet using the sweetened coconut.  So, next time I will try 1/2 sweetened and 1/2 regular.  The crust went well with the Apple Crunch Pie II recipe.

Seemed a little crumbly but that is nothing a spoon can't fix!  And I substituted veg. oil for macadamia nut oil.  Very good!

Subbed 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour.
Mixture was flavorless, so I added salt, cinnamon, allspice, and about 2 tsp honey.
The result was okay, but very dry. Perhaps more oil would help.(Maybe coconut oil? I used basic canola.) 
Anyway, this recipe still needs some work.

I used almond flour instead of wheat flour, and add a little extra of both the almond flour and oats instead of coconut. I used olive oil instead of vegetable, which was fine because I was making something savory (a quiche). It turned out delicious!

Coconut contains more unhealthy fats than pretty much any other food. This might be a tasty recipe, just remember, it might not be that healthy for your heart.
