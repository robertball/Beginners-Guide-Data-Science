I added sliced mushrooms, red, orange and yellow pepper and sweet onion.  The sauce was interesting, not my concept of an Alfredo sauce, but ok.  There could have been more of it.  I did omit the cheddar cheese, it just seemed out of place to me.  All in all this made a good main dish for a meatless meal.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! Added mushrooms and sweet red pepper as well as a tiny  touch of nutmeg and cayenne to spice up the sauce. My family loved it and I will certainly make it again.

I couldn't bring myself to use cheddar in such a nice Italian-sounding recipe! I used mozzarella and it was really delicious. The garlic and Parmesan key it up enough.

I thought this was a great recipe. Easy to make. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used some dried oregano and basil. I also put extra garlic which adds a lot more flavor and Ialso  added half a chopped onion which added even more flavor.I like the cheddar cheese on this recipe because of the strong flavor of the cheese. If you want to have something different as a pasta you have to try it because I personally can tell you that you won t regret it.
