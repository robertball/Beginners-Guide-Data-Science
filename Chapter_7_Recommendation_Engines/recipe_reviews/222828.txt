I changed the proportions of this recipe, and had to cook it for half an hour, but it was amazing, especially for such a simple recipe. Very moist, with a subtle flavor.

This is an excellent recipe -- quick, easy, yet worthy of company. I didn't have salmon so I substituted large white fish (swai) fillets. As a result, I did have to increase the cooking time. Despite that, the fillets came out very moist and were very flavorful. I also didn't make individual packets, but wrapped and sealed all of the carrots and fish I was preparing in one foil-lined pan. The meal is colorful and healthy. It is a very versatile and "forgiving"  recipe that I will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent. Added some red pepper flakes before baking. Very moist and flavorful.

I found this to be alright... average.  It was easy, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  I enjoyed the ginger, but the sesame and rice vinegar didn't add much.  I didn't like cooking the salmon on top of the carrots because the carrot got the salmon goo on them.  I love salmon and have tried a lot of recipes.  This one was just okay for me.

I didn't have rice vinegar so used lemon juice in it's  place.  It didn't have a wonderful flavor - just the same old salmon and lemon with a bit of garlic on a bed of carrots and spinach.  So, next time I'll go buy rice vinegar to see if that makes the dish. Otherwise, I love cooking in foil - easy cleanup!!

Loved it! I'm not a huge salmon fan but ths tasted great! Added a few chili flakes for some heat but that was the only adjustment I made. It was wonderful!

I’m so happy I tried this recipe. I didn’t have grated ginger, so I used puréed ginger. It still came out great.

Another reviewer had said the flavor was underwhelming. I agree. I meant to add the red pepper flakes but forgot. I put a few mushrooms in and used more onion than the recipe called for but overall, found this to be bland. Won't make again.

This was surprisingly bland. I thought with the fresh ginger and sesame oil it would have delivered more flavor. I don't think I'll be making this again.
