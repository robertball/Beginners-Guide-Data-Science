Truthfully I didn't like the mix of flavors in this recipe. I liked the stuffing itself, although I thought it could use more seasoning, more of a mix of the sweet and savory.    I think the recipe called for too much vinegar in the sauce - and overall I really didn't think the prune sauce complimented, but more battled with the flavors in the stuffing.   I like the idea of this recipe, and maybe with some adjustments it could be very interesting.

I made it without the prune sauce and it was great, paired with mashed potatos sauteed greens been and riesling to drink! the pheasant tasted awesome!
