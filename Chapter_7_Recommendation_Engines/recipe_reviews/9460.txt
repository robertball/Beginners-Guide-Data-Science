This banana nut bread was moist and delicious. I increased the amount of banana to 1 3/4 cup(about 5 sm/med bananas)and added 1/2 tsp.cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp.nutmeg and used one loaf pan. I tented with foil after loaf had lightly browned and baked a total of 60 min. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family just loved this bread and I thought it was very easy to make. I did use only one loaf pan however. The cooking time was a lot longer than the recipe states. Once the outside of the bread browned the way we like it, I covered the top with foil and continued baking until a knife inserted in the center came out clean. The texture is very moist and the bread is extremely flavorful. This is a new family favorite at our house!

Very moist and great flavor. I made a few modifications. I doubled the nuts, vanilla and added about 1/2 cup more bananas. I followed the advice of previous reviews and made (1) 9x5 loaf. It turned out great!!! Thanks for sharing.

Awesome!!!  I have been using a similar Banana Nut Bread recipe but thought I would give a new one a try and this one is fantastic.  I did add a little more bananas to the recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I will use this everytime.

I made this recipe with my oldest son so he did most of the cooking on his own. We made one half recipe--which came down to 10 servings. We made a few small changes--we cut the sugar back to just over a half cup and we used melted butter instead of vegetable oil AND we cut the amount in half and used homemade organic applesauce in place the missing butter/fat. Because I always do this with muffins, I used a teaspoon each of both baking soda and baking powder. It's just something I've done for a while now and I just don't mess with success. We chose to make muffins out of this recipe. We got 12 large muffins (two more servings than what the calculator had listed--no big for us, it'll get eaten) out of a halved recipe. Mine were done at exactly 20 minutes. I have to say this was one of the most pretty banana nut bread recipes I've ever made. The muffins are just gorgeous. They look like bakery muffins. My son and I shared one muffin (taste testing the end product......very important) and the flavor is wonderful. Everything seems to be portioned just right and it dosen't seem to be missing anything. He went to bed tonight quite proud of himself and we're ahead of the game for breakfast tomorrow. I'll make this one again.

This recipe would have been enough for one of my glass loaf pans. I still split the recipe in half and made two really nice loaves of banana nut bread. The bread was moist and very good. I had to leave it in just a bit longer (about 10 minutes) on the loaf with more batter, but it was still very good.

Perfect!!! USed this recipe because the others all called for sour cream and I didnt have any at the time. This was delicious. Of course I had to make some modifications with what I had so I'll list them here, but they were minor. I used 1 1/2 cups of bananas instead of 1 cup, and added some cinnamon ( 1 1/2 tsp) and along with the vanilla extract, 1 tsp of rum extract. I baked it in two 8 x 4 loaf pans as directed. Perfect, perfect, perfect.   Thanks Leslie!

I think this recipe is a good place to start.

I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, because I like that molasses flavor.
I decided to add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, because the batter seemed a little bland without it.
I also added the batter to a regular loaf pan.

The bread was very brown on top for the minimum time (and my oven runs cool) so be careful with that.

Very moist and incredibly easy.  But. . .too, too sweet - I didn't read all the reviews but the most recent didn't seem to mention that 1 cup of sugar is too much.  I will definitely be cutting it back to 1/2 cup next batch.
I made three mini loaves - they came out beautifully, but the cooking time is much less than 45 minutes.  I kept an eye on them and it was approximately 30 / 35 minutes.

Excellent Banana Bread....but you should only use one loaf pan.  There simply is not enough batter for two.  This is my permanent banana bread recipe.  The whole family loves it.

Love the ease of this recipe and the simple pantry ingredients. Would've given it 5 stars cause tastes divine, however, it didn't fill 2 loaf pans nicely. So my 2nd batch a put it in a bundt pan. Gonna take it to work and fish for comments.

Based on the other reviews I had higher expectations of this recipe. I thought it turned out OK, but only just OK. I used 1 cup mashed banana per the directions, and thought that the bread was a bit bland, it could use a stronger banana taste. My recommendation is to increase the amount of mashed banana.

WOW! Such a great recipe. The bread was so good the first time I used this recipe that my husband asked me for make some more to give to his family. I simply added an extra half cup of mashed bananas and doubled the amount of nuts (I used walnuts) and I guarantee that from now on this is my favorite banana nut bread recipe...

I followed the recipe exactly. My only problem was it didn't yield (2) 8x4 loafs. Next time I will use (1) 9x5 loaf pan. Otherwise it was delicious and moist!

I followed the recommendations of others & used one 9x5 pan which was just right. I used half white sugar & half brown as I think brown sugar gives it a bit more depth; one extra banana in very thin slices - the bigger pieces are really yummy!  Increased baking time to 70 min(due to bigger pan and extra banana), last 15 min with tented foil on top.
It is moist & delicious and my husband loves it.
Thank you!

Simple and easy is what I say about this recipe. I baked it in one loaf pan, not two, and it came out perfectly. Will be using this recipe from now on, only might add some cinnamon next time.

Recipe was easy to make and the bread was so moist.  My second batch I did add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon which being a cinnamon lover added just the right touch for me.

Terrific bread! Like other reviews for this bread, I found that the recipe as listed is really too small for two loaves (they came out too thin for my taste). I would use one 9x5 pan for the recipe as listed as opposed to two 8x4 pans.

Don't need to add any liquids although it might seem like it. To maintain the thick texture after it's baked, leave the recipe as is!  Tasty and wonderful...mmmmm! Extra flair: add walnut AND pecans chopped finely--excellent!  If you have a DollarStore close by, you can buy loaf pans for a $1 -- bake and then give them as gifts!

I had three overripe bananas and this recipe looked easy enough.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to mix the eggs, oil etc. together first and then combine with the dry ingredients but since that's what I usually do, I mixed it that way, used the three bananas and added nuts last. Then, I poured batter into a 9x13 pan.  It was wonderful!!  Thanks for the recipe.

After stopping at a farmer's market recently and buying a loaf of homemade banana nut bread, I really wanted to bake some to have around. I wasn't sure which recipe to choose but decided to use this one...I'm so glad I did. I do suggest that you use more bananas to enhance the flavor of the bread. I doubled the given ingredient measurements and made used four rectangular loaf pans. If you're a fan of walnuts, they work great here!..more may even work out. Although some covered the bread towards the end of baking, I found no need to. They baked completely evenly. This recipe I plan on using again!

I have tried so many recipes for banana bread. I haven't found one that was easy to put together, smell good, and taste delicious like this one. It has just the right amount of sweetness, and moisture. I also appreciate the fact that an amount of mashed banana was used instead of just number of bananas, which can really vary. I didn't change a thing. They baked for just 45 minutes....one was half devoured before it had time to cool!

Wonderful recipe.  I also added 1/2 t cinnamon per the other reviews.  The batter was looking a little dry, so I added another egg too.  Baked it for 60 minutes exactly and it's perfect.  I used two 8 in. loaf pans.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! I was looking for a simple quick recipe for banana nut bread and found this one. It turned out moist and was a hit with my three young children. I did add an extra  banana and cinnamon plus nutmeg as suggested by another reviewer. Oh and I used a 5.5 x 9.5 bread pan to bake. Try this one and you won't be disappointed.

I made this recipe twice, once as stated the 2nd with a few adjustments.  As stated, it wasn't bad whatsoever but kind of dry.  Per what other uses said, I increased the banana to about 3 large bananas (almost 2 cups) and added a little cinnamon to it 1/4 tsp.  This time it came out WONDERFUL.  Also, per another user, I did cover the bread about 20 minutes before it was done.

I really liked this recipe. I can only give 4 stars though because the recipe is a little off. This all fits in one loaf pan very well. In my glass loaf pan, I had to bake it for about 60 minutes. Also, I added an extra tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, I used 3 old bananas, about 1 1/2c mashed banana's, and I increased the pecans to 3/4 a cup. I just used non-stick spray instead of flouring the pan and it was fine. With those small changes, this is my very favorite banana bread recipe ever, and the only one I will ever make again. Thanks for sharing! Oh, and there was No mess to clean up besides a bowl and a measuring cup, so that's a big plus.

My Husband really like this bread.  I am not a big fan of Banana nut Bread but I made it for him.  The only thing that I changed was: I used Egg Beaters instead of real eggs.  I was a little worried about the extra liquid but I just baked the bread  for the full amount of time and it turned out GREAT.

Excellent.  I did swirl the pecans in a processor for those household members that have trouble with eating chunks of nuts.  The bread is wonderful.

This was my first time making banana bread and it was awesome!  The recipe literally took me 5 mins to throw together and pop in the oven.  I added a bit more vanilla and walnuts than it called for, but those were the only changes I made.  I put it in a 9x9 pan, not a loaf pan, and it took 27 minutes to cook (at 350F).  The top is golden brown and the inside is yellow, just like its supposed to be :)  I definitely recommend this recipe!

I have also made muffins and mini-muffins out of this recipe, and the muffins take 18-20mins to cook, the minis take about 10 minutes.

This tasted amazing. I opted not to use the nuts as my husband doesn't like them in the bread. I know it took longer than 45-60 minutes, but I didn't keep track after that. Sadly, because of that, I burned the outside a bit, but other than that it was delicious. Good way to use up bananas that don't make it into smoothies. :)

I used walnut halves, 5 ripe bananas, 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar, 1/4 tsp "quatre epices" (I'm in France), and brown sugar and cinnamon on top. One hour in my 170C oven in a single loaf pan instead of two, and I laid some foil over it during the last 20 min. Next time, I'll try reserving some of the sugar from the ingredients and use it for the topping. The slightly crunchy top is great. All in all, a success!

This banana nut bread was fantastic!  My husband and I both went back for seconds!  I did make some modifications to make it healthier, since I am diabetic: 1 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup sugar and 4 teaspoons Sweet and Low.  We couldn't even taste the missing sugar!

I definitely suggest to add more bananas to add to the banana flavor, but serving warm with butter is heavenly!

Great bread!  I used only 1 loaf pan, but had to bake it for @95 mins.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and 1.5 cups of banana, which is @ 3. I also used 2 tsp of cinnamon.  The bread was so moist and filling.  Very easy and very tasty.

I used 1 cup chopped walnut, 5 medium bananas, and 2 teaspoons vanilla.  I baked it in 5 (very) mini loaf pans and it turned out FANTASTIC!!

I am not a baker, I made this recipe three times now and it always turns up great! I give it 5 stars because no matter what you do with it, it works. I too added more bananas and nutmeg. I tried with cranberries once and with raisins the second time and it tasted awesome both times, I can't wait to try it with orange juice the next time! Thanks for sharing.

The best ever.  I make it all the time.  I add a little more vanilla to the bananas while i mash them, and i use probably 1/2 cup more bananas so its not so dry.

The recipe calls for two loaf pans. I found the loaves were too flat.  Next time, I will use only one loaf pan and make the necessary changes to the time and temperature.

This recipe was way too bland! I do not eat Banana nut bread but I made it for my husband and he was disappointed, the cooking time was much longer than stated, I had to cover it with aluminum foil to prevent burning, and it was not moist.I will keep looking.

Good banana flavor, but recipe is too small for two loaves!  Loaves came out too thin and dry.  Would use this recipe in one 9 X 5 pan next time.

This recipe was good.  I took it to a Christmas Pot-Luck at my company, and it was quickly devoured.  However, I doubled this recipe and it still only made three thin 9 inch loaves.

I have tried a zillion banana bread recipes and this one is perfect. I only came across it because it was one of the few banana bread recipes that didn't call for sour cream or buttermilk. I only had 2 small bananas, so I halved the recipe. Because I only made half the recipe, of the 1/2 cup sugar I used 1/4 cup white and 1/4 brown sugars. (Also, I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts). I can't wait to get my hands on some over ripe bananas to make a full recipe.

This recipe turned out perfect. The bread was moist, firm and delicious. There was a perfect balance of everything, with just the right amount of banana flavor. I did add 2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix. Overall I think this is the best I've had.

Good recipe, but didn't make 2 full loaves.  I'll make it again, but double the ingredients to make two full size loaves.

I just made this recipe and my kitchen smells wonderful!  I could hardly wait for the bread to cool so I could try a bite and was not disappointed!  I followed the recipe exactly (with a dash of cinnamon) and the bread came out delicious.  I will definately make this again and again!

5 stars with the following changes:

1 cup pecans instead of 1/2 cup
about 2/3 cup frozen cranberries
2 tsp. maple extract

The bread has an amazing texture and the smell is amazing.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and just used one large loaf pan.  After 45 minutes I turned down the temp. to 325 and about 10 minutes later it was perfect.

Thank you so much!

very good, although, i am wheat free and used a cup of spelt flour, a half cup of tapioca flour and half cup of rice flour as a substitute for all purpose flour and the middle caved in a little bit but not in any way to affect how yummy it is... will make again and cont' to experiment with flours...

Another great banana bread recipe! I make several different banana bread recipes so I'm not always baking the same old recipes, and this will be one to add to the collection (I did substitute the pecans for walnuts).

I doubled this recipe in my first attempt to make it...ummmm-mmmm good!
I made 6 small loaves in a mini-bundt pan for my husband to take on a fishing trip, wrapped them in cellophane, and they were even better the next day!  Best recipe I have ever used to make banana bread.

Love this recipe!  It was easy to make and is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used monk fruit instead of sugar due to my boyfriend having diabetes and it came out great!I used two 8x4 pans and they were done right at the 40 minute mark.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is a very easy Banana Bread and it's really good both warm with a little butter or cold with a good cup of coffee in the morning. I put walnuts instead of pecans, (didn't have any pecans on hand). I made it at 2:00 and it was gone by 4:30. I personally had two pieces.

Loved this recipe...but I added more nuts and it wasnt sweet enough so i would add 1.5 cups of sugar next time and an extra banana. I had to bake around 70 minutes instead of 60. Other than those tweaks it was terrific and perfectly crisp but still moist.

Turned out great. I did bump oven up to 375 which only took 35 minutes. Next time I will add about 1/2 c more banana, since I had to add 1/4 c milk to get the batter to a proper  consistency. And I used walnuts, for personal preference. The taste is right on the money. Great recipe!

This is a quick, easy & super tasty recipe. I should have used only 1 bread loaf pan as mentioned in other reviews for a better-sized-filled loaf. I also made the following changes: 1/2c of sugar instead of 1c, increased banana to 1 3/4 cups, swapped out 1/4c of flour for whole wheat flour, swapped pecans for chopped walnuts, added 1/2tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Rented with tin foil as recommended in prior reviews when reached desired color. 45min baking time when using 2 loaf pans.

This came out soooo good!  I did put extra banana as well - I think I did about 1.5 cup.  I think it's just individual preference.  My husband LOVED it.  He's very picky too.  He said it came out "fluffy."  Very pleased!  And easy!

The recipe instructions said to use two loaf pans but this resulted in thin loaves.  I would consider baking in one pan or a bundt pan next time.  Or, if not I would bake it less than 45 minutes, maybe try 40.

I have made banana bread many different ways, and this recipe is my absolute favorite! Sweet, moist, lots of banana flavor. The vanilla adds just the right touch of richness, too. I follow the recipe to the letter, also. When I take it to my co-workers at the restaurant, they all love it as well. Great job, Leslie!

Wanted to update my review, to say that I have substituted stevia for the sugar, and the bread came out just as good as the original. Also, you can use this recipe to make muffins! Just scoop into greased muffin tins, and cut the bake time about in half (around 20 minutes or so).

I love this recipe! I bake it up for family get togethers, gifts, and new mommies. Everyone raves about it. I've made it enough to know what changes work and don't work. I add a tsp of All Spice...just deepens the flavor. I also use this as a base for different fruits. I've made it into sweet potato/pecan bread, pumpkin/almond bread,  apricot/pistachio bread....soooo yummy! And my shortcut for all of it...2 jars of baby food in whatever flavor you want. Works like a charm everytime!!

This banana bread recipe is a great recipe.  I had extra mashed banana (about 1/4 cup) and added it anyways and tried reducing the sugar about 25% because I was making it for diabetic family members.  They pronounced it "great".  I still found it sweet tasting and will next time reduce the sugar by 50%.  I made the recipe into muffins and they came out fine textured and moist.  I also want to try using whole wheat flour to bring down the glycemic rating.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Excellent! We had some leftover bananas. Before throwing it away I looked for a recipe. I found a few. This one had the best ingredients (including pecans). It came out great! I doubled the bananas though just because I didn't want to waste them.

I love this banana bread. I make it like the instructions. On occasion I add extra banana but that's only because I had an extra one. And I add extra pecans. It doesn't take away from the recipe when I added the extra ingredients.

I have tried so many banana bread recipes - this one is what I've been looking for.  If I'm trying to use up overripe bananas I really don't want to use expensive extra ingredients like sour cream, etc.  This is a simple recipe that uses simple ingredients!  I used 1c white flour and 3/4c whole wheat flour, 1/4c coconut oil (melted) and 1/4c applesauce, and used 1/4c mini chocolate chips in place of pecans.  I poured this into a greased 9x13 pan and baked for about 30 minutes.

Great recipe but it only produced one loaf for my stoneware bread pan, which is larger. I wish I would have doubled it! I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon for a little more flavor but overall delicious, moist bread.

I made a WONDERFUL MISTAKE.  I accidentally grabbed Bisquick rather than flour when I last made this banana bread. At the time I didn't realize why it was so much better, but it definitely was.  So this morning, I made it again with regular flour and, sure enough, I isolated the variable.  It is indeed the Bisquick that made all the difference. I will never make this bread with regular flour again.  So, I am now making this minor modification to my May 30,2013 rating of this recipe.  I still give it 5 stars but using Bisquick sends it way over the top. (Think I'll add some Craisins next time too.) Yum!

After reading the reviews, I also made some changes.  1 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 white flour, I added 3 large mashed banaana's, 2 tbs melted butter, an extra egg, 3/4 cup walnuts and 2 tsp cinamon, 1/2 nutmeg and 1/2 pumpkin pie spice.  I made them in muffin tins and baked for 20 minutes.  They are delicous and moist.  My husband has already eaten 2 and they've only been 10 minutes.  This makes about 20 muffins.  Great recipe!!

This recipe made two perfect loaves.  I loved it.  If you want to try making it vegan you can remove the eggs and add one more mashed banana.  I love quick bread recipes with oil rather than shortening or butter, for some reason they're just more moist. This will be my go to banana nut bread recipe from now on.

I just made this exactly as the recipe states, cooking it for 45 minutes.  Next time, I would just bake it in one loaf pan instead of two. Also, I will increase the nuts and bananas to make it even more flavorful.  However, it's delicious the way it is written.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!  I lost the last one I had for banana nut bread and this one is better, so I'm glad I lost it.  I have deep loaf pans so one batch makes one tall loaf which is fine for me because my family loves it.

It was good.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, omitted the oil (only because all I had in the pantry was my super-fancy EVOO and I was not wasting that on banana bread).  Instead of one cup of white sugar (yikes!), I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup maple syrup (to make up for not using oil).  With the alterations, it was awesome.  I used slightly more bananas than the recipe called for, and that also helped with the moistness factor.  I gave it 3 stars for the original recipe, but with the changes I made (I also threw in a handful of oatmeal and put some chopped walnuts on top before baking), it would probably be 4 1/2 stars.  I mean, it's been out of the oven for about 15 minutes and there's only one piece left out of two loaves, so I'm guessing my kids approve.

I love this recipe. Thank you soo much for sharing. I did use walnuts instead of pecans and I did add about 1/4 of a cup more of bananas. I also took others advice and covered the loaf once it reached a golden brown top. I bake it in just one 5x9 and it comes out perfect!

Delish!!!  A great starter recipe! I made a few changes after making the recipe as is a few times. My most recent recipe was our favorite yet.  I used 3 medium bananas (didn't measure). Upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp, added 1/8 tsp ground ginger and topped with cinnamon sugar before baking. I always make muffins- so 18 mins in the oven and they come out perfect every time.

Since we are a family of two, I made these as muffins so I can freeze some for later.  It was an easy recipe and turned out great.  I didn't measure the banana, just used three medium ripe ones and it worked fine.   Baked 18 minutes as someone else suggested and it was perfect.

This recipe is a family favorite.  I baked this all last Thanksgiving and Christmas because I couldn't keep up with demand.  I did add extra banana and it was great.  I've also baked this in the mini loaf pans and it worked wonderful for gifts.

I cut the recipe in half, with the exception of bananas.  I used 3/4 cup of mashed bananas and the loaf is delicious and moist.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe. I used the last batter for muffins instead of a second loaf. Even they came out so beautiful and tasty. I did add more banana then it called for.

Just made this tonight and it's really great.  I didn't have any nuts though but the bread is still very moist and delicious.  The banana flavor is just right and I wouldn't change anything about the recipe-except next time I'll include walnuts :)

I love this recipe. I make it almost once a month. I just add a little bit more banana to the mixture and it comes out so moist and obviously with a more banana flavor. Wonderful!

This recipe was very easy and delicious. It turned out well, but as i sliced the bread it crumbled and fell apart. We still enjoyed it, and I will be making it again.

I stirred in about 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and made these into muffins (cooked about 20 minutes).  Really good - really easy!

Tried this with my 4 year old grandson doing the measuring, egg cracking and stirring!  Never changed a thing in the recipe.  Made one big loaf and baked for the appropriate time.  Best moist, banana bread we ever had.  If a 4 year old can make this, anyone can.  Thanks for a great treat.
