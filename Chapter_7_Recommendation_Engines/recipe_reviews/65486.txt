Interesting recipe!  I changed it due to things I had at home and made a smaller recipe, but enjoyed the end result.  I used 1 ripe plantain - steamed it rather than boiled it, used 1/4 c. natural peanut butter, and added 1/8 c. honey, 1/4 t. salt, and about a tablespoon of the "steaming" liquid. Made about 12. It bakes up very nicely and makes a great "energy" snack.  The first time I made it I didn't use honey and I thought it was a little bland - adding the honey the second time made a big difference!  Thanks for the idea!!! Just wanted to add that I baked the balls for 25-30 minutes because I made mine smaller than the recipe suggested.

I like plantains so overall I enjoyed this and it was very easy to make.  I thought adding the peanutbutter would help my husband enjoy them more and he still won't touch them.  Make sure you mash the plantains really well so the balls stick together.  I didn't have any honey and he suggested(after they were in the oven) to use pancake syrup to sweeten them up a bit.  I did sprinkle them with cinnamon before baking.  If you like plantains but don't want to fry them then give this one a try.

Theser are pretty good.  Not sure how to rate, as I did change it up a bit based on reviews and what I had.  I planned on using green plantains, but by the time I got around to making these my plantains were ripe, so I just decided to go with it anyway.  I added some pumpkin pie spice and some honey, but I'm not sure I needed to.  You don't really taste the peanut butter, but the plantains have sort of a tart taste that is really  nice.  These don't look that appetizing (you'll see from my picture!) but they are a nice little snack.  I think that 45 min was a bit too long for mine--some are a bit dark on the bottom.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved these! Very healthy and hearty way to start the morning. I made these exactly as directed, and sprinkled them with paprika (yes, weird I know) and ate them with scrambled eggs & chorizo in the morning). I used all natural peanut butter, it doesn't have added sugar to it so I wouldn't have to use these as a dessert because they weren't sweet.

When I made this recipe, I made the following changes: I pressure cooked my plantains for 3 minutes on high pressure with quick release.  I used a large food processor to grind up the cooked plantains and combine them with the peanut butter.  Recipe came out very well, and I will definitely make this again !!

Very yummy - especially with fried egg.  Not bland at all, although I only had 3 plantains on hand, so it was a bit more peanutty.  Also, I used natural p.b. - half of which was a honey-roasted variety (so I didn't add honey) and neither kind I used was the type that separated.

I found the recipe very band. The texture was also not particularly appealing.

Little chewy and an odd sourness. I took recommendations from other reviewers and added agave nectar as a sweetener. I also added some chopped pecans to add a little more flavor and a crunchy element. Overall flavor was not bad.

It ended up being more like a bread pudding, but surprisingly not bad. I'm using a version of Malaysian plantains called pisang nangka. I think there may have been some residual water left from cooking the plantains which caused it to be more pudding like when baked. However, I started to think if you were to add cocoa powder and some other ingredients you could make an excellent vegan pudding. So there is hope with this, even if I may had added a bit much.
