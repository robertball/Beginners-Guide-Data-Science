A simply beautiful, perfect pie crust.  Easy to roll out (even easier to mix since I used the food processor), rich and flavorful, thanks to the egg, butter and sugar; tender and flaky. A light egg wash of a beaten yolk and a little water gave this beautiful crust the beautiful golden sheen it deserved. One of the best and easiest crusts I've ever tried.

I agree with the other reviewers that this pie crust is absolutely wonderful. Great taste, texture, AND very easy to work with. I use this recipe to make Old Fashioned Apple Dumplings by Micki. If you're making pie crust for the first time, this is a good one to start with...you can't mess it up. It's super easy and super delicious. Your diners will be impressed. I used all butter...no shortening (my family can't have shortening). And when I cut the recipe in half, I beat one egg, and simply pour half of it down the drain. I use King Arthur all-purpose unbleached, unbromated white flour. Absolutely delicious! Thank you SO very much for sharing this recipe!

This pie crust rolled out velvety smooth and was an absolute pleasure to work with.  The crust is slightly sweet with a hint of lemon. This has to be one of the flakiest, most tender pie crusts I've ever made, and it will be my go-to crusts for fruit pies.

This is the third pie crust I've made from this site and even better than the last one, which I gave rave reviews.  Aside from being delicious it was absolutely the easiest pie crust dough I've ever worked with.  So smooth! I rolled it out on parchment paper and used very little flour to prevent sticking and it didn't stick at all, not to the parchment and not to the rolling pin.  Shortening isn't fit for human consumption so I used lard and butter instead.  I might try all butter next time.  I used a frozen stick of butter which I then grated.  The lard was chilled in the fridge before using.  I also used my KitchenAid mixer with the whisk attachment to cut in the butter and lard then mixed the rest in with a large fork then by hand.  This will be the only crust recipe I use from now on.  Thanks for posting it!!

I find this pie crust beautiful, but I'm perplexed by the recipe instructions. I don't understand gently stirring the butter and shortening into the flour with a fork and this created quite a chunky mess. There were bits of shortening and flour well after kneading for 10 minutes!   All the same, it makes a fine pie crust and it's very pretty.

This is unbelievable!! I am a beginner with pies and it has always been a disaster, making the pie crust. That is until now. I was initially skeptical about the recipe, but after reading the reviews, I felt it was worth a try. Boy am I glad!! I have finally experienced making pie crust and feeling it all come together. Thank you thank you thank you Kira! You have no idea what you have done for me!!!!

The best pie crust recipe I have ever made, for sure. This is fantastic for sweet pies like fruit pies. For quiche I use a shortening recipe that's not sweet, but for berry pies this crust is hands down the best. Always comes out great, it's my go to recipe for sure. LOVE it.

Because it was called Perfect Pie crust I tried it.  It was awful!
I've made a lot of pies in my life but have never fought with a pie crust like this one! Wouldn't roll out right, kept breaking into pieces. I literally had to piece the crusts together in the pie pans.

This is a phenomenal recipe. I used all butter, made the day ahead to conserve time and I was shocked at how easy it was to work with. I am inexperienced with pie crust. This gave me confidence and next time I'm going to try using my food processor. Very tasty and tender.

This worked out perfectly for me.  I used the crust for two deep dish Chicken Pot Pies.  I used less than half of the sugar and added vinegar for the lemon juice.  I also used all butter - no shortening.  Once the dough formed I rolled it out between sheets of parchment paper in about an 8 inch circle.  I then placed it on a cookie sheet (4 total layers) and popped in the freezer for 15 minutes.  I rolled the dough out fully, still between the parchment then used that to place the crust into my pie plated and peeled it away easily. The dough handled beautifully, kept its decorative edging and baked up golden brown and flaky. I will be using this recipe again.

It certainly rolled out well.  I have half the batch in my freezer.  I can't wait to try it!
>Edit:  And, yes, it was a delicious addition to a very Christmas-y cranberry-apple pie for our Easter morning breakfast!

This crust was very easy. I complicated things by scaling the recipe to four servings. Then I used it to make three mini-pies in individual pie tins. I made two blueberry and one apricot. They were a hit. I used all butter and the Fresh Blueberry Pie II filling on this site.

Loved it!  Tastes great and is super easy to work with once it's been in the fridge for 1 hour.  You can also make ahead and freeze it. I triple the recipe (12 pie crusts) and just keep them in the freezer, then leave on the counter for 20 min or in the fridge over night before using. 
This will be my go-to crust from now on.

This is such a good pie crust.  The recipe actually makes enough for 5 crusts (2 1/2 pies worth) and it freezes beautifully!

I feel like the best cook ever when I make this pie crust.  I used to use the unroll kind and now I would NEVER do anything but this homemade version.  I did not get four pie crusts out of it.  I prefer to make it into three, that way I know I'll have enough.  I have a little left over but not enough for another pie.

I'm 65 and have been cooking for myself and family for years.  I just recently started trying scratch pie crust.  Your recipe required very little "calming fluid" and has been a huge hit.  Many commented they hadn't tasted a better crust.  Thank you.

I have NEVER made a pie crust before (I am VERY bad at cooking) so I was kinda scared to try this. I tried it, it was perfect! Guess that means even a bad cook can get this pie crust right! Great recipe, would't change a thing!

Perfection! My go to roll out pie crust. I make as is for berry pies. For quiches I add 1 tsp minced fresh rosemary. For sweeter pies (pumpkin, pecan) I substitute milk for the lemon juice. Freezes well either rolled out in pie pan or in disc before rolling out.

I’m not sure what I did wrong, as I am what I would consider a highly proficient baker, but this crust was nearly impossible for me to work with. I followed it to the letter with no changes or substitutions (but I do not have a stand mixer, so I used my tried and true old fashioned way).  I was making a double crust for a rhubarb pie, and it was so difficult to roll out (it fell apart no matter what I tried...a little more water, then a little more flour...nothing worked). I finally gave up and threw together a random weave on top. It looked terrible but it tasted good. I’ll definitely stick with my simple butter, flour, sugar, water recipe from now on.

Used this crust recipe for my pumpkin and apple pies this year over the holidays. Give it a try, you will be surprised how well this crust holds up to the juiciest pies and doesn’t get soggy or fall apart. I froze three of the four and all turned out equally well when baked.

This is so delicious, I could almost eat it on its own! Made about half of this recipe and still had some left over, so be warned it does make a lot. Love it and will use for all my pies!

I made this recipe just as it is written and I loved it. It made 4 single pie crusts and was flaky just how we like it. I used it for pot pies and sweet pies as well. Will be my go-to pie crust from now on.

Oh my goodness!  This recipe is awesome with 1 change.

 I have tried pie crust in past numerous times and failed miserably every time.. so it was simple, I just stopped trying...then my children begged me to make a pie for Christmas.  I had not tried this recipe yet mainly because it has shortening in it (eeeww).

Simple solution,  I used ALL butter.
And the only procedure  I modified was to shred my butter while frozen.

Dough is very easy to work with, is flaky and oh so yummy!!
So much so that I am making it again today for cherry pie.  Let's see if I remember to take a picture this time

this was my first attempt at making a pie crust, so I used this recipe to make a strawberry/Rhubarb pie.  I cut the recipe in 1/2, as I only needed 2 crusts. I also used all butter. The bottom crust came out pretty hard, you couldn't even cut it with a fork. The top crust turned out better and not so hard..  I divided the prepared dough in 1/2, and in order to roll it out to fit the 9" pie plate, it had to be rolled out quite thin.  Has anyone else had this issue? Any help would be appreciated.  :)

I've always been terrified to make homemade pies.  For me the crust is what makes the pie. This recipe is easy and creates the perfect crust. Light and flaky. I won't try any other. This is a keeper

I used all butter. To my surprise the stated amount of water in the recipe worked! I usually need to use more to get the dough to gather together. I thought this crust had an extra richness to it thanks to the egg. I halved the recipe and had enough crust to make two 8" double crust pies.

I cut the recipe in half but used part of the second half for my pie because I needed more.  I will make the whole recipe the next time for three crusts and freeze two of them for future use.  I will make cinnamon crispies out of the leftovers in the morning!  My strawberry pie loved this crust!  And, of course, the eaters loved it, too!  Thanks, Kira Hultsman!  I will make this again!

This was my first ever attempt at making a blueberry pie- I chose this recipe for the crust- I'm SO pleased with how it turned out! Excellent crust :) buttery and flakey- I was so nervous about the crust, I wanted the taste and texture to be just right- this recipe is just what I was hoping for! THANK YOU so much for sharing your wonderful recipe- you made my first attempt at baking from scratch a true success!!

Super easy, delicious, and tastes homemade. I made a pot pie with this pie crust recipe for my in-laws and they just raved about it. My husband and son absolutely loved it. Best pie crust I have ever made. Ever. 

Thank you so much!

First time that I made a pie and it came out delicious. I run out off flour so I used 2 1/2 white and 1 1/2 whole wheat. Was easy to make and everyone love it.

I have tried several pie crusts and tend to shy away from them because I have been so unsuccessful with them. This time I decided to try one more time to make a fruit pie for my husband. The fruit part did not turn out, but the crust was easy to work with and delicious, so I will be keeping this recipe to try again.

This made 3 crusts for me, but it was delicious and got rave reviews.  I did use all butter since I didn't have shortening, and kept everything chilled - pie plate, rolling pin, etc.  This will be my go to recipe from here on out!

This is the single best pie crust recipe I have come across! It is tender, flaky, very tasty and easy to work with.  I do think it needs an egg or milk wash to improve the color though. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!
