Made as instructed.  Nice, a bit bland, needs spices or pesto.

I didn't have parmesan cheese, but I had some spaghetti sauce. Delicious! Great for lunch. Will cook again soon!

Really easy recipe! I added additional seasoning mix and added extra parm. I'll have to try other additions or subtractions the next time I make it.
