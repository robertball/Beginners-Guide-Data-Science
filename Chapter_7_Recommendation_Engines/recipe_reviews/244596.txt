I followed the recipe to the letter. I used sharp cheddar but any cheese would work. I left in in the oven for 1/2 hour and the cook on the fish was perfect! It was moist but not slimy and flaked easily. My husband and I loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I've made this previously and loved it but this time instead of fire roasted tomatoes on top, I used chunky salsa and it was absolutely delicious.

Yes I made changes I decided to add the butter from another recipe then add lemon pepper and the garlic powder in butter sauce. Then I put the cheese and tomatoes with chives. Poured sauce over the cooked fish over white rice. It was delicious. Ty

I was skeptical about this recipe because, as others have said, the ingredients don't sound like they'd work together, but they really do! I'm not a huge fan of swai, but my husband and I loved this dish and it was so easy to make. I was pleasantly surprised at how great this was and would definitely make it again!

very good. swai is not my favorite fish but it's inexpensive. this recipe made it a tasty fish. my only changes were: i used diced tomatoes on top and drizzled a small amount of the juice over the fish. I also oiled the pan first.

I made this tonight for dinner, and was very pleased with the results!  I followed the recipe, and my husband loved it, literally gave two thumbs up.

When I made this I used the basic recipe but didn't measure anything.  Did change the cheddar cheese to fiesta blend cheese and the roasted tomatoes to salsa - only because that is what I had.  Entire family loved it - even daughter who doesn't like fish.  Will definitely make again.

I wasn't sure these flavors would go together, but they DID.  It was really delicious.  Just smelling it cooking was driving me wild.

I didn't have any fire-roasted tomatoes, so I subbed in Classico Fire Roasted Tomato & Garlic pasta sauce.  It was very tasty.  If I do it again, I will add less, though.  I think 15 oz of pasta sauce sat very differently on the fish than 15 oz of tomatoes would have done, since I had to cook it for almost 50 minutes.

I'll admit I didn't have too much hope for this recipe. The ingredients combined sounded weird, but it actually worked! I didn't add salt, the lemon actually has a salt like effect. I enjoyed this and only regret not making more.
