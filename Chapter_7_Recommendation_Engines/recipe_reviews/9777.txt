I substituted sweetened condensed milk instead of corn syrup in this recipe, and rolled the rum balls in hundreds and thosands, coconut and crushed peanuts. They turned out great, and the different coatings made for good variety in Christmas gift-giving! :)

I tried this recipe and loved it.  I am wondering if the last person to post had problems with it because they used corn starch instead of corn syrup???

I have used this recipe for years.  I melt 12 oz of semi sweet chips in about 1 Tbsp shortening and dip each ball in the mixture.  A family favorite

This recipe was amazing!  I ended up using pecans instead of walnuts (it's what I had) and it was delicious.  Super easy to make and as a not if you let them chill over night instead of an hour they are phenomenal!  I only got compliments on them!  I cannot wait to try them with different liquers!  I also added a wee bit more cocoa....  One other way to do it is 2 cups vanilla wafers and 1/2 cup of oreo crumbs.  Again - easy and delicious

I WAS SO EXCITED TO USE THIS RECIPE AS RUM BALLS ARE MY FAVORITE COOKIE, HOWEVER I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS RECIPE FROM THE START. HAD TO KEEP ADDING MORE RUM & CORN STARCH FOR MIXTURE TO "STICK" TOGETHER; AFTER ALL THE EFFORTS COOKIES LACKED IN "RUM FLAVOR" & WERE QUITE DRY.  I BELIEVE RECIPE SHOULD USE AT LEAST 1/2 CUP OF RUM/BRANDY, ETC. & MORE CORN STARCH...VERY SORRY TO HAVE TO LEAVE SUCH A POOR REVIEW!!!

AWESOME! I did tweak the recipe a bit but only because I didn't have enough nilla wafers. I used half nilla wafers and half cheap ginger snap cookies from publix. the ginger snaps added a little zip to the balls and I may even do it the same way again. Very Good! I also made the balls 1 inch. 2 inches seems too much.

Corn syrup people - not corn starch.  These are great. Use good rum to make the taste yummy.

Very good.  I used reduced fat vanilla wafers and crushed them in the blender. Same with the walnuts but not as fine.  Very easy to make and it doesn't heat up the kitchen in the summer!  (Even if you do traditionally make these around Christmas time.)

Great!  I made these for a party I recently threw, and they were gone within the first hour!  I used Captain Morgan Tattoo Rum, which is a little sweeter than most.  I will definitely be making them again.  Thanks!

Yummy! Proportions were perfect. Was going to give them away on Christmas cookie trays but ended up eating them all ourselves. I used a good dark rum everything else the same. Only used the powdered sugar caoting but it added a nice dimension to the cookie. They get more addictively good as they age a few days at room temperature in a sealed container. They are an aquired taste, very sophisticated, children might not like them. I am going to make another batch, they are very easy, the only time consuming thing is rolling them in balls. Recipe states 2" balls, they are very rich, a 1" ball is plenty. As it was I only got about 3 dozen 1" balls out of the batter anyway. A new personal tradition for me, going to make these every year from now on. Want to try different coatings too.

these are great.  i added a leetle more rum than it called for.  wet your hands slightly before rolling them into balls - WAY easier and it doesn't stick as much - otherwise you have to keep rinsing your hands after each 3rd or 4th roll.

the dough may be a little dry and the amount of corn syrup and rum isn't really enough to hold together all the dry ingredients, but this can be easily corrected with about 1/4 cup water (or until the dry ingredients are all incorporated).  Wet hands with water when rolling up the rum balls and they won't be as sticky.

These cookies are AWESOME!  They are sooooo easy to make and really good!!  I used Myers Dark Rum, and I have to admit that I added a little more than called for in the recipe!  What a punch!  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.  I may even make them for Valentine's Day since they are so yummy!  Try 'em!!!!!!  Happy New Year 2008!

I made these with Malibu rum and added a splash of Meyers Dark rum.  Really nice.  I think next time I do that, I might roll them in toasted coconut!

I used brandy and almonds in replace of rum and walnuts.  I realized as I had already put everything together, I did not have corn syrup.  I used maple syrup instead.  I coated half in just powder sugar and half with chocolate (as another reviewer suggested).  
Originally, I thought they were too sweet, however after letting them set for two days, the flavors were amazing!  Big hit at a party!

Wow! I made a batch of these for coworkers using Cruzan spiced rum I bought while in St. Thomas, VI and they were a big hit! 
I did have to add some corn starch to make the balls roll-able but kept to the recipe pretty much. I did up the rum to 1/2 cup so that was likely the problem with the mix.  
Coworkers loved them so much that I am known for my 80 proof rum balls around the office! 
Thanks you for such a great treat!

I really wanted to like these. In fact, I ate a lot trying to convince myself I liked them, but they were just so-so to me. I had actually never had a rum ball before, so maybe you have to have a thing for rum balls. I can just think of a lot of other ways I would like to spend calories!

I get bored using plain old rum/brandy.....try one of these instead: Captain Morgan, Cherry Brandy(can dip in melted chcolate), Irish Cream Liquer, 99 Bananas, Butter Shots, Malibu Coconut Rum(roll in toasted sweetened coconut), Baileys Caramel Temptation Liquer,....there are so many yummy ways to mix up this recipe!  I don't use cocoa powder in every recipe either.

Awesome recipe. I used pecans since they're sweeter, and I rolled the balls in a mixture of cocoa powder and confectioners' sugar. Make them the week of Thanksgiving to give away right before Christmas...yowza! Best part is that they go together in less than 20 mins. BTW, 2.5 cups of Vanilla Wafers is one box. :)

I made these for Christmas presents this year alongside biscotti and these were the biggest hit by a fair margin! I'll definitely use this recipe as my rumball standard in the future.  They also got better with age...

Extremely simple to put together.  The mix was a tad dry, so I did add a few pours of Malibu rum to get it to stick together.  Can't wait to share them with my friends!

Classic and delicious.  My only change is to use honey for part of the corn syrup (and I just use light corn syrup, ,as it's what I keep on-hand. And definitely adjust rum as needed.;-)

I have loved making rum balls since my got the recipe from Barcardi rum back in the late 70s.  We always made them for the holidays, until we moved and lost the recipe.  This recipe is the closest thing to what I remember. It was super easy and so yummy.  I ended up making 3 batches just so I would have 1 batch to take to a party!  We couldn't stop eating them as we made them.  If you want a non-alcoholic version, my mom used oragne juice in place of the rum.  It tastes good and is safe for children.

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly.  I tried one when I first made them and then let them sit for 3 weeks.  WOW!  They are now the best rum balls I've ever had.  I did have to roll them in powdered sugar again before taking to friends.  But that's just to make them pretty!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Have made different rum balls also. Just to let everyone know they freeze well and especially if you are going to mail them like I did and still were excellent and don't be afraid to mail them in the winter.

What a wonderful and easy recipe.  I used Ritz Crackers in place of the Vanilla Wafers, and used Light Corn Syrup in place of Dark. I did not add the chopped nuts due to allergies, Still the saltiness of the cracker and the sweetness of the sugar gave it a nice balance.
I used Dark Rum for this recipe, I think the next time I make these, I'll try Spiced Rum.

this was an absolute hit with my family. Most of my loved ones have never had rum balls before and I was a little hesitant about trying to make them myself, but these turned out excellent. Depending on how finely crushed the wafers are you'll need to add a little extra liquid (rum, syrup, or both). It works out better if the wafers are crushed at least it did for me, but its all by preference. I just finished the 6th batch for christmas so I'm going to go rest before I have to start on the cookies.

I don't know if I did something wrong but I thought these were not good at all, I found them dry and not very flavourful. I added more rum to them but it didn't help.

I used dark rum in mine. I was told "finally I can taste the rum in a rum ball." What a hit!!! And a great way to use up the extra little bit of rum in the house.

i subbed honey for corn syrup because it's hard to find 'round these parts (rural japan). it tasted like rum balls i got from the store. 

however, i realized i don't really like the strong rum taste (duh!!) after i tried one, so i added 1/2 c peanut butter, 1/2 c crushed nuts, and 1 tbsp cocoa powder. i also added some cocoa powder to the powdered sugar for the coating. delicious. thanks!

I used graham crackers in place of the vanilla wafers since that's all I had on hand, and substituted molasses for the corn syrup due to personal preference. They came out great! Thank you for a fast, simple and delicious treat!

Ok, just made these for the first time.  Loved them...very easy to make.  Only thing is I doubled the recipe and it was very dry.  I just added more corn syrup.  I used a lite Rum and a teaspoon of rum extract..also, added a 1/2 cup more of syrup.  They turned out perfect!  Will make again

Who knew rum balls would be such a hit! Super easy recipe and they taste great. As usual I Tripled the alcohol content, so they have a little kick but still taste great. This is definitely something I will make every year and will probably add some to my adult gift bags!

We made these..for our CHRISTMAS goodie trays that we were handing out..The only thing is on the first batch it was dry & very time consuming to shape/form into balls, So on the next batch I just added a little bit more rum, It was about 1/2 cup total. I used regular Bacardi, & rolled in powered sugar. Very yummie!Gonna make a batch or two with Malibu coconut rum & roll them in coconut! Also are kids allowed to eat these? JUST CURIOUS? Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome!  I added more Rum too for the heck of it, but talk about no hassle!  One you buy the ingredients, you only need to replenish a few of them when you want to make more!  I put them in tins and "Merry Christmas hard to buy for family members!"

I make this every year - sometimes using brandy instead of rum, but rum is great and we love these! They are not overly sweet like some other recipes I have tried.

Made two batches from a failed pound cake instead of vanilla wafers, and they seem to have turned out well. Rolled half in icing sugar, and half in chocolate sprinkles. 
 Does anyone know how long these will keep for? Should they be refrigerated or frozen?
Thanks for the recipe!

I lost my original recipe, thought this would be a good option. However, I also found this to be dry and crumbly. Added more rum and corn syrup to fix the problem.

This is the same recipe my grandmother used! I love it! One helpful hint to those trying it for the first time....you want to crush the cookies and walnuts as fine as you can, but not to powder consistency! Mixing ingredients with a fork sometimes helps as well! Thanks for posting this recipe!

I'm surprised at how many positive reviews this has given how much difficulty I had with this recipe. I used all the correct ingredients, but the mixture was VERY dry. I had to add more rum to get them to stick together. And it took a VERY long time to roll them into balls because of all the effort it took to compress the dry mixture into balls. And then it didn't even really taste much like rum at all =(

The taste was ok,however if anyone's made them with these measurements I'm surprised. I had to add more corn syrup and more rum to make dough. way too much crushed wafers for the wet ingredients listed. It was a good starting point though.
