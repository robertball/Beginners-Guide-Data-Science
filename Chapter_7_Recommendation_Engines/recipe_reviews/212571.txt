This was easy, elegant and fabulously delicious!  I did a recipe search to use up a packet of caeser dressing from a bagged salad mix.  I happened to have the rest of the ingredients.  I added crushed red pepper to spice it up.  This is a keeper!

Good fast meal.  I substituted the cream of celery with  cream of chicken and used homemade canned tomatoes (1c. including some liquid) since that was what I had on hand.  Exactly what I was looking for.
