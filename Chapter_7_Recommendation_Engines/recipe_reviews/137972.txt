One winner of a salad for sure! Due to allergies did not use the peanut oil. A must to impress guests! Thank you so very much Doppio!

I really enjoyed this.  It had a really different flavor and would be excellent to serve to guests for something a little different.  I scaled it down to 4 people.  I used spring mix and went a little heavier on the chopped fresh spices in the dressing.  I had no fresh dill, so I used dried instead.  

Very nice, light, nutty flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Be careful not to burn the walnuts. They can toast up fast. Also mix dressing separately and pour over greens. Delicious side! Perfect with Arugula.
