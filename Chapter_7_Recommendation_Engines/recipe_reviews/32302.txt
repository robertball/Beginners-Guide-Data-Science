I did not bother with the crushed ice. I just used regular ice and shook the vodka pineapple juice and cream of coconut in my martini shaker. This was very good but for me it needs double the vodka.

I don't have a blender so I wasn't able to crush the ice. So I just served these over ice instead. Us girls loved them!

Yummy drink! I had leftover cream of coconut to use and this was the perfect way to use it up. It definitely tastes good and would be great with rum too. Nice refreshing summertime drink!

Tastes just like a pina colada only made with vodka.

Needs to be sweetened maybe some sugar added. Otherwise good basic recipe...
