These were good and almost tasted like beef with all of the seasonings. The one thing I think would have been better is to use mayo instead of sour cream for the slaw.

My 9 year old loved it. Next time Iâ€™ll double the burger so I have leftovers. Also, the slaw makes twice what you need. I read wrong and made the avocado part of the slaw. No one noticed.

I used half the chili powder and found the burgers had just the right spice for me. I also used ground veal with this  recipe.
