This caramel sauce was DELICIOUS!! Instead of placing in paper bag to mix I used a bowl (but this sets up quickly so had to mix fast)! Did not place in microwave, but oven at 300 for 8 minutes on parchment (and it wanted to stick). I did not use microwave popcorn.  Instead of milk chocolate, I used 2 cubes of semi-sweet chocolate bark.   I drizzled white chocolate over this popcorn after the photo was taken!  Make sure to store (if it does all get eaten after it comes out of the oven) quickly so the popcorn doesn't dry out.  I will buy a premium popcorn to make this again.

Easiest caramel corn recipe I've found yet. I don't trust my microwave so I cooked the caramel recipe in a sauce pan on the stove but followed the rest of the recipe as written and it came out perfectly. I didn't get to put any chocolate on the caramel corn because I couldn't get my family to leave it alone long enough to cool, but I'm planning to try it with the chocolate next time. This recipe deserves an extra star because it was so easy to clean up afterwards. You throw away the piece of equiptment that gets the dirtiest, the paper bag.

This was a delicous recipe but I would alter it next time and use dark semi-sweet chocolate instead.  The milk chocalate made this too sweet for me and I am a big fan of milk chocolate.  I also had to add more shortening to the chocolate to get it to the right consistency.  It may have been the chocolate - I used Ghiradelli's  milk chocolate chips.  Great caramel corn sensation!

Excellent! I made it once the way the recipe read (except in a bowl instead of a bag since I didn't have a bag big enough). It was good but the popcorn was mushy.   This time I made the caramel sauce, poured it over the popcorn and then placed the popcorn on a parchment lined cookie sheet. I placed the cookie sheet in the oven for about 8-10 minutes at 350.   Then I drizzled the chocolate. I used semi-sweet.   To help with the drizzle problem, I melted 1 cup chocolate chips with about a tablespoon of butter and then added about 1/2 cup milk. This allowed it to actually drizzle.

Very, very, very good! I just finished making a batch of this and it is fantastic. My husband will not get home from work for another hour so he may not get any :) It is much easier to make than the instructions let on. A new holiday tradition.

Be sure to get rid of the unpopped corn kernals before you begin, you can really hurt yourself taking a hard bite on one. Other than that, this a wonderful fix for chocolate and salt lovers like myself!

I liked this popcorn recipe.  I used the recipe for a bake sale at our company.  It was all sold very quickly.

This came out perfect. I used the paperbag method with macadamia nuts and air popped popcorn.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and immediately put the chocolate mixture in a plastic freezer bag, cut off the tip and was easily able to drizzle the chocolate over the caramel corn.

Very quick, easy to make and yummy! I substituted pecans for the peanuts. I did have a little trouble with the chocolate. I think I overheated it. Still tasted wonderful!

Ok, so there is no reason that something this sinful should be this easy to throw together on a whim! We wanted a sweet treat instead of the plain old popcorn for a Saturday night movie and ran into this recipe. Followed everything exactly as written. In 20 minutes, we were shoving handfuls of this caramely, chocolatey, popcorn deliciousness into our mouths at record speed. LOVED IT! Had NO idea caramel popcorn is this easy to make. Will be doing this again and again!! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe! :)

This tastes delicious! It is actually easy to make, and doesn't take that long. I whipped it together in about thirty-ish minutes using microwave popcorn. I also chilled the popcorn in the fridge to cool it quckly. It was a huge hit at our poker night event!

Edited to add: I gave the leftovers to our leasing staff and they ate an entire huge bowl of the popcorn! They couldn't stop raving about it.

fantastic! I made it exactly as listed in the microwave, except that I didn't have peanuts so I left those out. The only caution I would have is make sure you watch the sugar syrup while it boils so it doesn't overflow. I was amazed that this worked so well, all in the microwave! I will totally be making caramel corn more often!

Quick, easy, good, but made the popcorn a little soggy.  Probably operator error though.

Excellent and very easy to make.  Will definitely make this again.  I gave these away as Christmas presents and they were impressed.  I actually used salted butter which is what I always have in my fridge, so next time I will omit the salt.  I'm also a big chocolate lover, so next time I might double the chocolate and shortening, just because.  I added more shortening to make it drizzle better, but I think that made it firm up a lot longer than I thought.  Like a previous reviewer, I didn't have a big paper bag, so I divided the popcorn into two big bowls and mixed the popcorn in that.  I was so glad that I didn't have to bake or use a candy thermometer for this recipe.  Oh by the way, I didn't use microwave popcorn, but popped regular popcorn kernals in a small brown paper bag without oil or butter for about 2min 30 sec per 1/4 cup unpopped popcorn.  Gotta love the microwave for this recipe.

I didnt love this recipe. Microwave recipes are difficult and leave a lot of guessing because they arent all created equal. I have a 1000 watt microwave and reduced each cooking time by more than a minute and the popcorn still scorched. It did, however, stay crisp. In fact, I had no trouble with my popcorn being gooey or soggy. Still, after tossing out the burned kernels, my husband really enjoyed the treat. He said it reminded him a lot of Cracker Jacks. Unfortunately I never liked that snack either.

Oh my God, soooo good.  I made the caramel on the stovetop, mixed it with popcorn in a bowl, spread onto a parchment paper topped baking sheet and put in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.  The resulting popcorn was so good, I skipped the chocolate!

I decided to make this to give to my son's teachers and friends for Christmas this year. Today I did a practice run due to earlier reviews and this is what I did....  I cut the recipe in half (16 servings) and heated the caramel mixture (sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla extract & salt) on the stovetop at medium (5) until bubbling in an 8 qt pot...stirred in the baking soda, then stirred in the popcorn and peanuts until covered Then spread out on the table on parchment paper. Heated the chocolate & shortening then drizzled (by melting chocolate and placing in plastic bag with the tip cut)  over the mixture. Tastes delicious! And looks scrumptious!

There's this chocolate covered caramel popcorn that I've been buying from Family Dollar for the last month......until they ran out. Then I went looking for a recipe. I did use GodivaGirl's review suggestions--I used regular popcorn instead of microwave and I baked the caramel corn at 300 for just under 10 minutes on greased foil. I wanted a salty-sweet combination for this recipe so I did use SALTED peanuts. This turned out ten million times better than the bagged chocolate covered caramel corn I was buying, the caramel sauce for this recipe is IN-SANE. Excellent recipe.

Uh oh... I wish it wasn't so EASY!  Now my family wants this All the time.  I have found that spreading foil on the counter and spraying it with cooking spray makes the clean up a breeze!  *update April 09* We now add cashews instead of peanuts and omit the chocolate but sprinkle very sparinly a litlte salt over the caramel corn just afer spreading it out on the foil... heavenly. :)

I'm giving this 4 stars because the recipes made such a delicious treat...on the second batch, that is.  The ingredients were not specific in whether to use plain or buttered popcorn.  I made the mistake of using buttered popcorn on my first batch and it was wayyyyy too buttery. Using plain popcorn, this is absolutely amazing!

oops! I'm sure the baking soda is in this recipe for a reason, but I completely forgot it! The Caramel Chocolate Corn still came out GREAT!  I was impressed first by how quick it took.  Most recipes require you to stand over your stove forever, but this has great microwave directions! Kudos to you for that!  I'm also impressed at how FANTASTIC this tastes! I WILL DEFINITELY make this again... and again..! (next time I'll remember the baking soda! hehe)

I tried this recipe after wanting to make some fancy carmel corn I saw in a catalog.  It is so yummy and oh so easy!  My kids don't really like nuts, so I put a few handfuls of mini pretzel in with the popcorn before pouring the carmel on top.  We have also topped our with melted white chocolate along side the milk chocolate - yummy!!!

Ok...so I didn't allow my chocolate to melt enough to drizzle properly, but I followed the rest of the recipe to a "T" and this is just "ok".  Maybe it's too hot/humid and maybe this would set up/cook better in the winter/fall?  But as it is right now, it's just ok...nothing fab. and definitely not worth the effort/mess.

Great! I couldn't believe how simple this was in the microwave, and it tastes very similar to a version a friend of mine paid $18 for a small tin of from the Boy Scouts a couple years ago. 



I wasn't sure about doing the caramel coating in the microwave, but I was feeling lazy and didn't want to boil sugar on the stove. This worked perfect. And the paper bag trick made the whole process a breeze. My kid had fun helping shake the mix, too. I'm curious whether the paper bag might work for mixing the chocolate coating, too. I had some trouble getting it even--it turned out rather patchy. 


I used microwave "lite" popcorn and diet margarine to save a few calories. I found that two bags of cheap microwave popcorn gave me exactly 16 cups, and the caramel mixture covered it well. I used candiquick instead of chips like i saw recommended here, but 1 cup didn't cover it as much as I'd have liked--the scouts' version looks like every piece is dipped individually and mine turned out pretty uneven. Still, this was very rich and delicious. My 4 year old isn't crazy about chocolate (believe it or not), but it was all I could do to keep her from eating it all before it was even cool! Luckily my husband wasn't home when I made this or I might not have gotten any, either. I'm going to take some to work tomorrow and watch people's eyes roll back in their heads in delight! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

We like it.  I like it because all I have to use is a bag to cook the pop corn in.

the recipe is okay..I initially cut the recipe in half, but in the end, while using 1/2 the popcorn stated, made the entire batch of caramel, and my popcorn still was not coated enough for my taste.  However, that may be because the execution of these directions is great---if you want to eat a caramel coated bag!!  I ended up dumping the first batch into a bowl, & making a second batch of caramel to add to it.  I was very excited to try this in a bag--hey fewer dishes, right?, but it just ended up a bigger mess.  If you attempt the bag method, I recommend having someone assist you & hold the bag open/ upright while you dump in the caramel--I ended up with a caramel coated burnt thumb when my bag fell over halfway through the process. I also needed double the "shortening" when melting my chips but that may be due to using dark choc chips & margarine.

So easy and delicious - I love this recipe.  I just made it with mixed nuts instead of peanuts to make it more gourmet.  I double the popcorn so it cuts down on some of the sweetness.   I lay it out on wax paper to dry to make clean-up easier.

This caramel corn is delicious and so easy to make!  I used an air popper to make the popcorn (did not add salt or butter) and used semi sweet chocolate as suggested in another review.  If I made it again exactly by the recipe I think I would use the milk chocolate instead.  But actually, if I make it again I will most likely omit the chocolate entirely or maybe try to add M & M's after the microwaving.  The caramel corn by itself was the bomb!  I made three batches and was able to put together 15 gift bags for Christmas treats for family (after what was eaten of course!).  And I did use my microwave as the recipe called for and it turned out perfectly.  So easy!

This is super YUMMY!
At first when reading the recipe it seemed like lots of steps to do but it goes really pretty quickly.  My husband and I made three batches one night to take to a "cake walk" the next day.  We had a hard time not eating it all!  When we gave some to our friends and family it received rave reviews.  This is so yummy the chocolate is not even necessary!  When I put the chocolate on it, I used the candy making chocolate as it always sets up perfectly.

Easier to make than it sounds. I didn't have any paper bags, so I just used bowls, and stirred carefully rather than shaking the bag. It worked great. Drizzling the chocolate worked with a spatula worked fine too.

I'm a HUGE popcorn fan, usually eating it plain, but I had to try this variation to spice it up a bit and I was VERY PLEASED!  Surprisingly I didn't care for the chocolate, I can never get it to melt just right.  So I just skip that step and call it caramel corn!  It's GREAT!  I like it even better the next day when it has a chance to "sit" a bit.  I used regular planters salted peanuts.  Plus I always make the popcron on the stove with olive oil.  Remove any kernels like another viewer suggested.  I love this stuff!

Great recipe.  I've used it many times with a few changes. Love using the paper bag, & not having to bake it!

Quantities:  I make 7-8 cups of popcorn (1/2 cup kernels) on the stove, but use the full amount of caramel in the recipe.  I also use an entire bag of semisweet chocolate chips (2 cups).  Delicious!

An important note- if your popcorn ends up chewy, it's because the caramel wasn't hot enough, so it didn't harden.   When you mix in the baking soda, the caramel left on the spoon should harden as it cools & not be gooey.

Yummy!!  Obviously if you don't like cracker jacks in the first place, it is unfair to give this recipe a poor rating because it is like cracker jacks.  Sooo easy, with fantastic results, and quick clean up!!  A few tips; have a spatula ready to get all of the caramel mixture into the bagged popcorn before it cools as it does cool quickly.  Also I had to stir mine after microwaving because all of the popcorn did not get covered.  I used my hot air popper to elimimate the seeds and also to get crispier popcorn (I love it made on the stove top with canola oil, but perhaps that is why it wouldn't be crispy??).  Due to a chocolate shortage, I was only able to do half of the batch with the chocolate and found that we  do like it better without it.  Thanks for sharing you easy, yummy recipe Jen!!

I made this recipe as-is twice now and it comes out amazing. The first time was just for us, the second time was for a small get-together and people were extremely impressed with how they turned out. 

Getting the drizzling down properly is a bit tricky and leads to some clumps of chocolate the first time. Just take it slow and try to keep a steady hand.

Incredible!  I used honey instead of corn syrup, made the caramel on the stove, baked the caramel corn at 300 for 8 minutes, put it back in the bowl and mixed the chocolate on top of all of it because I could not get it to drizzle properly.  This is so ridiculously delicious!  We plan to make a bunch of it and give it away to teachers/neighbors for Christmas presents.

This popcorn turned out great - better than store-bought. I air popped my popcorn - which cut back on calories a bit. :) It sounds like a lot of steps, but it is REALLY easy to make. I had some problems with the chocolate though - getting it to go on evenly, so on my second batch, I just left the chocolate off and we liked it even better!

Seriously delicious stuff!  I used 2 bags of "natural" microwave popcorn and it was 16 cups.  I left out the baking soda in the caramel on accident, but it didn't seem to matter.  I also cooked my caramel on the stove top.  Once it starts boiling, just boil and stir for 1 minute and you're good to go.  I also took the advice of others and baked at 350 for about 8 minutes before drizzling with chocolate.  I used 1 Tbsp of shortening in the chocolate and semi-sweet chips.  Super yummy and not overly sweet.  Love it!

This is sooooooo good!  I ate a whole bunch before I put the chocolate in it. It had a nice crunch, but wasn't rock hard either--just the texture I was hoping for.  It wasn't too sweet either, which I appreciate.  I'm sure that once the chocolate sets, it'll be even better.  Plus, this was way easier and tastier than the other recipe I made last week where I had to bake the popcorn for an hour. My microwave is massive, so I turned it into 80% heat so I didn't burn it. I am definitely going to make this again!

I made it according to the recipe except I added milk and butter to the chocolate chips at the end. While it was easy to drizzle, the chocolate never did set up and harden.

I forgot the baking soda first time so made sure to add it the second time - actually found without baking soda it coats the popcorn much better and forms a better coating so things stick more
