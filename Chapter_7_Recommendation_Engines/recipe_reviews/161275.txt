This dressing was my finishing touch on a salad with lettuce, spinach, peppers and "Beer Lime Grilled Chicken", also on this site. The flavors were very nice and complimented the chicken well. The dressing comes out creamy and tangy, with a nice hit of heat on the end. This is going in my permanent rotation for a delicious and healthier alternative to a cream-based or mayonnaise-based dressing.

I used real lime juice. Glad I halved the recipe and only wasted half an avocado. Way too much acid in this. I really had to doctor it up.

I used this dressing on shrimp salad, and it complemented the seafood wonderfully! Simple to make and tasty! I reccomend it.

Very good but needs a little more than a dash of hot pepper sauce.  It was a little bland so next time I'll keep adding the hot sauce until it has the kick that I like.  I'll definitely make this again.

I tasted this as I was putting it together and really didn't care for it, but I went ahead and chilled it and served it on left over slices of chicken and to my surprise it works.  I only have Sriracha so that's what I used.  I do think I would like it better with just a small bit less rice vinegar.  Thanks, Bunny!

I liked this a lot. I felt it was a little too strong for the salad but loved it on grilled chicken. I will make this again.
