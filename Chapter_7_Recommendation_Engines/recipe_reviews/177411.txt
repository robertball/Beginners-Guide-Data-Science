My mother in law's boyfriend makes homemade irish cream every year for us kids. I used that plus DeKuypers Blustery Peppermint to make this. His homemade irish cream is SO potent that adding the peppermint is even more so and it's oh, so good. I suggest you try using a homemade irish cream like I did. VERY creamy and smooth.
