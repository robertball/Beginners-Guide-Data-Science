I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and still found it a little too sweet. And too salty. The toothpick came out dry after 20 minutes, but somehow, the middle of the muffins was a little under baked. I would recommend baking a few extra minutes. I will eat them, but since I have the choice, I will stick to my full-of-allergens recipe in the future..
