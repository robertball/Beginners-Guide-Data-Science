1.28.18 This is the first time I’ve cooked fennel, and I just expected more flavor.  As directed, I sauteed only the bulb slices, but I did cut some of the stalks, and their aroma was  wonderful.  Also, my onion was just so incredibly sweet (certainly not complaining about that), it really dominated the flavor.  If I were to make this again, I’d probably cook an entire bulb of fennel and half an onion, giving the fennel more of chance to be the star.  pruneDeSucre thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a quick and tasty way to use fennel bulbs! I agree the fennel flavor was subtle, but I prefer that!
