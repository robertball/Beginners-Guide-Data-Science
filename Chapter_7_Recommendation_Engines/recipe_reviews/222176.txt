I wasn't sure about this at first, but I found myself going back for more, so I obviously enjoyed it.  We didn't have fresh corn in PA in February, so I subbed frozen instead.  This is def worth trying for a change of pace w/frozen corn.  THANKS for the recipe!  (Photo will be added as soon as I'm able to upload to AR...)

I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 only because I've tasted some better recipes.  However, this was a nice change and as my daughter said it would be great as a side dish for a steak or even a burger.  I too as another wasn't sure of the mixture working together but it really does. ***Just made this a second time, for you blue cheese lovers I really think this is one to try.  Was going to make corn on the cob today with my ribs but my daughter wanted this again, so here we are.  Yum

This dish is absolutely fabulous! The way the cheese and corn meld together is amazing. I used 3 cans of corn instead of cobs. I will be making this again and again.
