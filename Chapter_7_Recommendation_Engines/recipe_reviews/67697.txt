We just got back from the Caribbean and fell in love with the tropical flavors.  I substituted sugar-free vanilla ice cream for the yogurt and added three strawberries. Yummy.  I plan to try this with cantaloupe or honeydew in place of the mango and maybe throw in a few nuts. Rum might add a zip! Endless possibilities.

I made this with fresh pineapple, and found I needed to sweeten it with a little Splenda. I just plonked the ice cubes into the glass at the end as I don't think my blender could handle grinding it. Very fruity and refreshing. Thanks!
