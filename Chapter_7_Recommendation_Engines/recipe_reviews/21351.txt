Lovely color and consistency but way too sweet to eat.  Recipe called for 4 1/2 cups sugar to 6 cups cooked underripe peaches.  Used 4 cups of sugar to 6 cups of cooked ripe peaches. So sugary it could put someone in a coma! Had to toss the entire batch.  If you decide to try this recipe, I recommend that you start with 2 cups of sugar, taste and add more sugar in 1/2 cup increments until you get to the desired sweetness.

This recipe has been rewritten. The original submission did not call for the addition of water, and this ingredient was mistakenly included when the recipe was published on our site. We apologize for the inconvenience.

I have tried making and canning 3 different recipes for peach preserves and this is by far our favorite.  I love that you don't peel the peaches, it made it much easier to prepare and the skins added a lovely rosy color to the preserves.  Also, since they are diced instead of sliced, they seem to hold their shape a little better and not all float to the top of the jar. I read that in preserves, the liquid should be about the thickness of honey, and that is how it turned out for me, not too liquid at all, but also not too sticky to spread. We have given jars of these preserves as gifts and gotten rave reviews.

I just finished making 42 half-pint jars of these peach preserves.  This was my first time to make preserves, and I found this recipe quite easy for beginners.  I loved that there is no peeling, no lemon squeezing, and no skimming to do.  I think the secret to success is to be sure to bring the fruit and sugar mixture to a gentle boil that continues even when stirred, before adding the pectin.  If you add the pectin too soon, your preserves may end up runny.  Also, remember that this is a preserve recipe.  Preserves don't set up like jelly.  They should be about the consistency of honey.  That's exactly what I got, and the flavor is wonderful!  Definitely a keeper!

A little thinner than a jam, but excellent. Great flavor.  This recipe made 7 1/2 8oz jars full for me. I also mashed the peaches during the cooking to a much finer pulp than suggested in the recipe. I'm definitely going to do it again!  I recommend using "seconds" (bruised extras) from your local market. Also,

This was my first time making any type of homemade preserves and I was very pleased with it!  I had slightly less peaches - maybe 8 or 9 - so reduced the sugar somewhat.  I wanted to make a "Spiced Peach Preserves", so I added a cinnamon stick, 4 cloves and half a nutmeg pod tied in cheesecloth to the peach mixture while cooking.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Turned out perfectly with no modifications. I will make this again. I don't know if I am am the only one who didn't notice, but some brands of pectin do not have 2 ounces of pectin in the package. I added some from a second package. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a huge hit with my family, although I did make a few changes based on previous comments. I used 10 cups of chopped peaches instead of 12 peaches, 2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 4 1/2 cups, and a little over 2 ounces of pectin. I ended up with preserves that had a beautiful blush color with a nice consistency that was sweet but not to sweet. I will definitely make again with he exact same changes.

Awesome recipe!  My 14 year old daughter helped me with this and as for it not being a recipe for beginners, not so.  The recipe explained itself and what to do completely to our understanding and turned out just fine.  Was glad to find a recipe where we didn't have to peel the peaches. *update: I just wanted to add that my 14 year old entered this in our county fair and won a purple (first) place ribbon.  For those who don't like their preserves 'this sweet', you can try to lessen the sugar but the sugar is what helps the pectin to thickens and sets the preserves.  I feel this recipe is great as written and advise not messing with it.

Had some underripe peaches I didn't get to until they were soft.  Chopped up 10 cups, cooked for 20 min w/ some lemon juice & because they were dry, added juice of 2 oranges.  Added 3 1/2 c sugar to taste.  Cooked for 3-5 min.  Since the chopped peaches did not break down enough, I ground it up in the pan with one of those hand held blenders until I got a slightly mashed with little pieces of peaches texture.  It was thick enough that I didn't need any pectin which I think gives a better taste.  It was thick because the peaches were homegrown and were not fully ripe before picked.  If they had been juicy, I probably would have had to add pectin or an apple.  Roasted 2 poblano chilis and added peeled and finely chopped (w/o seeds) to 1/3 of recipe in addition 1/4-1/2 t pecorino for heat because the poblanos were not spicy enough for me.  This made a total of 2 1/2 - 12 oz jars of spicy preserves and 4 - 12 oz jars of regular preserves.    I often make preserves in this way w/o pectin.  Sometimes  I add an apple that contains a lot of pectin but not too much flavor to help thicken a juicy fruit preserve.  The less cooking you do with the sugar, the fresher and more bright the fruit tastes.  Yummy.

This is a great recipe. I did add about a quarter cup of apple juice when I starting cooking down the peaches, as I had no liquid in the pot without the juice.  That worked well.   I used 12 large peaches, which produced 10 cups of peachy deliciousness.  To that 10 cups, I only added 3 cups of sugar, and that was plenty.  It yielded 13 8oz jelly jars of preserves. I was also worried a bit about having peach skins in my jam, as I didn't peel the peaches.  But no skins!

Our first time canning peaches.  The recipe worked great.  We made 4 batches.  The peaches were ripe and sweet so we used the following for each batch:  10 cups chopped peaches equaled 6 cups cooked (every time), 2 cups organic sugar, 1 pkg 1.75 oz. pectin.  For spiced peaches we added 2 cinnamon sticks, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves.  Added the cin. sticks at the beginning of the 20 minute boil and added the nutmeg and cloves in the last five minutes of the boil.  The spiced peach preserves are a spoonful of heaven - tastes like Christmas.  We give this five stars all around - easy and delicious!

I just made this recipe, after not having made jam for many years. I LOVED not having to peel the peaches! I tweaked the recipe a bit- using 14 peaches to yield the 6 cups cooked peaches. Cut them into half inch cubes, then crushed them with a hand potato masher while cooking. It left some nice small pieces of fruit in the preserves. Also added a tablespoon of lemon juice. And after adding the sugar, and while boiling the fruit, I added 1/2 tsp. of butter to cut any foam. The jam turned out perfect! As good as any I made 30 years ago, and so much easier! Your user reviews helped me a lot. It certainly was not too sweet, and set up beautifully. I'll use only this recipe from now on! Yielded nine jelly jars.

I've never made preserves or jam or anything similar before, but this was very easy and VERY delicious. Boxes of pectin that I found came in 1.75 oz sizes, so I just used 7/8 of the recipe (10 peaches, 5 1/4 C of the cooked peaches put back in the pan for the second part of the recipe, and the 1.75 oz of pectin). I used only 2 1/2 cups of sugar (about half what I should have used for my 7/8-of-the-recipe measurements) because the peaches were so sweet, and it turned out great. Definitely sweet enough, but I suppose it just depends on your fruit.  I was a little worried when I saw the note about preserves being best when you use slightly under-ripe fruit, as my peaches were practically falling apart they were so ripe, but it seems to have turned out fine.  And, as someone else noted, leaving the skins on gave it a lovely rosey color!

Wonderful recipe.  I made three batches tonight, one with 3 cups of sugar instead of 4.5, then one batch exactly the same as the recipe and one batch with 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cloves, all of them tasted wonderful and just a little different from each other.  I used peaches from my own trees most a bit on the smaller side so loved finding a recipe that did not require peeling.  I will use this recipe every year!

These taste great.  I think I'd like to try adding a few spices next time (like cinnamon or cumin).  I am rating this 4 stars because I found #2 confusing.  Apparently, pectin only sets up a certain amount of liquid.  I'm relatively new to canning preserves, so did not know this and did not understand why I had to pour it out into a bowl and measure it back.  However, I pour the sugar in the pot directly and boiled everything and added the pectin.  I got 11 jars and it tasted and set up just fine.  Would definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Awesome, I made it with white peaches and skinned half of them and left half with peel.  Nice pink color!  I boiled them for 15 min. because we like it a little chunky.  I used a pack of 1.75 oz. pectin and it was perfect.  AWESOME!  Not too much sugar, most recipes call for equal parts sugar and fruit, I like the less sugar (although, don't worry, its pretty sweet!).

I made 23 8 oz. jars of this recipe today, and it came out Great! Delicious, so FRUITY and so MUCH better than what you buy at the supermarkets! I made sure to toss the boiled jar of preserves BACK into the boiling water if it had a "Clinking" sound when I ran my finger over the top of the jar.I knew if it didnt have that HARD tap to it, it wasnt vacuum sealed properly enough just yet.When I threw it back in the second time, I made sure to let it sit for another 15 minutes, & it worked great.This is a GREAT recipe, and its the very first time I have ever made Peach preserves! Not too  runny, honey consistency, just PERFECT! Thank you for sharing this recipe! I will always make this  A big fan of it now in Long Island, New York :)

This was my first attempt at making peach preserves. The Palisade Peaches are wonderful this year and so I finally worked up the courage to try it. This recipe is fabulous. I love peach and apricot preserves but nothing prepared me for how wonderful these would be. I really appreciated all of the comments because they helped keep me from making mistakes. I did use some other resources on canning because although this is a great recipe, it didn't include detailed instructions for canning. Nonetheless, I am hooked. I ended up with 8 cups of cooked peaches, so I modified the recipe accordingly. I used bulk pectin so I just measured out an extra 2/3 oz. It made 10 8-oz jars. I did add just a little lemon juice. My oh my. I just made toast for lunch so I could eat some. Thank you all so much. Love this community!

I love this recipe! So simple. No peeling of peaches. The peeling just melts away leaving a beautiful color. I canned peach preserves for the first time last year. Getting ready to start again. All the people I shared my preserves with said it was the best they ever had. Great on ice cream too! Thank you to whoever first shared this easy, fabulous recipe!

I had a bumper crop of peaches this year and needed a preserve recipe. I also had low sugar pectin and only used 2 cups sugar for 6 cups of peaches and it was perfect. Not overly sweet and allowed the peach flavor to come through. This is the only preserve recipe I will use for now on

Interesting... I see a lot of comments about this recipe being too sweet.  The recipe calls for 4 1/2 cups of sugar, but if you watch the video, the recipe at the very end only calls for 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  Typo perhaps?  Based on comments and the video, I think I'll try this with 2 1/2 cups of sugar.

I made a slightly smaller batch and used less sugar than what I should have, - I added sugar in smaller increments until it tasted sweet enough for me.  I also added just a tiny bit of cinnamon.  It turned out super!  I'm using it for toast....and I add a spoonful on top of white cake with whip cream.   VERY good recipe!

Very good! I changed it slightly:

I had 10 large peaches, which was about 8 cups diced, and about 7 cups of pulp. I used just 4 cups of sugar cause I don't like my jams or preserves to be too sweet. And I also added a small pad of butter to prevent excess foaming. Came out great though and very pretty! Thanks for the recipe!

LBOXF: I also had smaller peaches. I used a dozen peaches the first time and got about 3 1/2 cups. The next batch I boiled 16 peaches and got a little over 4 cups. There was a lot more juice after I added the sugar (I used 3/4 cup of sugar per cup of peaches). Good luck!

Excellent recipe!!! This was super easy to make and the result was outstanding. I boiled the peaches a little longer than the recipe suggested, and added a little more pectin for thicker consistency. Thank you for sharing!

MMMMMMMmmmmmm!  This is sooo good.  I only used 3 cups sugar (still quite sweet).  I used the low-sugar pectin just in case although I'm not sure it was necessary.  The box of pectin was only 1,75oz but it set perfectly regardless. Not having to peel the peaches is a major time and mess saver.  I was amazed that the peels just seem to disappear.  I plan to make more for Christmas handouts.  Thank you Kevin!

This was my first time canning anything and thought I would start with this recipe.  It was simple and fun... and a lot less work than other recipies I looked at.  I too, added a cinnamon stick and some nutmeg while cooking the fruit and when I had about half of the fruit mixture canned, I added about one-half cup of roasted, peeled & chopped medium-heat green chilies to the second half and cooked for about another minute.  What A Treat! The flavor and texture is wonderful... and being in the Southwest part of the US - fresh green chilies are a Must - in just about everything!!  Thank you for this terrific recipe!

Absolutely fabulous! It has a full bodied taste of peaches. Looks great with chunks of peaches in it and not too sweet.  It has a great consistency.  Took this jam to work with some scones and everyone raved about it, I gave the recipe to three others already!  Highly recommend. This made 9 jars for me.

Well, I'm sure this would've been great, if my pectin hadn't clumped! I followed the directions exactly, but ended up with clumps of pectin.

The family was so disappointed when we realized that none of us had my mother's peach preserve recipe.  My daughter and I tried this one today and it works great.  The taste is so close to 'Granny Lucy's' and we love the fact that you just chop up the peaches.  I was amazed that the skins dissolved.  They give the preserves a beautiful color.  My second batch was bigger (8 cups of peaches) and I was able to adjust the ingredients to make it come out great. This will not be my last time to use this recipe.---ConnieW

I used 12 peaches but added only 2 cups of cane sugar and it was still very sweet!  I also used the cook down method so I could avoid the pectin.  Yummy!

We loved the preserves that were canned earlier this year.  Problem now, they are crystalizing.  Tried setting the jar in hot water to "liquify" even a little.  What did I do wrong?

Very good, and very easy!  I have made this often enough now that I don't pour the peaches into a bowl and measure back into the pan, I can eyeball the cooked peaches and know if I have the right amount, then add the sugar and continue the recipe.  (The first few times I made it I followed the recipe exactly until I got a feel for it.)
Not as firm as a jam, not as runny as a sauce - just the way a preserve should be.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was so easy.  However, like one other person I started with just 2 cups of sugar and then added another half cup.  My family thought they were perfect with just the 2 1/2 cups, but for those with a sweet tooth I'm sure they're fine with the whole amount.  I will use this one over and over.

this is way too much sugar for me.  i made this but i used 5 peaches, 1/2 cup of sugar and  i added the juice of 1 lemon.  i didn't use any pectin.  it made 2 8 oz jars.  i did the water bath in the sink.  i put the jars in a deep pyrex and filled them and the pyrex with boiling water to get them nice and hot.  then i poured out the water and ladeled the peaches in the jars, put the lid on them and put them back in the pyrex of hot water.  the jars seal on their own.  it is devine!

Thanks to Kevin for submitting this recipe. It had been about 20 years since I had canned anything.  I was attracted to this recipe because it is simple and it calls for leaving the skins on the peaches. Great idea!  My peaches were nicely ripened, but for some reason they did not liquify. After about an hour and a half of cooking, it was apparent they they were just not going to break down. At that point, I put them in a Blendtec blender and pulsed them, just two touches per batch. Then they were perfect, with lots of small pieces mixed through.   I also made a few changes to suit our taste. My husband is diabetic, and I prefer less sugar.  I used Ball's "No Sugar Required" pectin and used about 2 cups of sugar per batch instead of 4 1/2.  I added fresh-squeezed lemon juice --- 1/2 lemon per batch -- and stirred in a small amount of cinnamon and fresh-ground nutmeg.  It is absolutely delicious, the color is great, and the texture is just right too.

This recipe is delicious!  The peaches I used were very juicy, maybe even on the overripe side and cooking the peaches down for 20 minutes was essential for eliminating the extra water.  However when I went back to measure the liquid amount I only had 4 cups, so I reduced the amount of sugar to 3/12 cups and used the 1.75 oz package of pectin.  It set very well, not as thick as jam, but it wasn't runny either.  The flavor was very good, and I love the color.  The only other change I made was to add a cinnamon stick and a pinch of nutmeg for just a hint of spice.  This is a sweet preserve, but the sugar does help it set.  Will definitly make again, probably today or tomorrow because the batch I just made is already almost gone!

I thought this recipe was easy to follow and yielded good results, which says a lot as this is my first time making jam/preserves/spreads of any kind. Not knowing how set the different types of fruit preparations should be it's hard for me to comment on the consistency - for our tastes, we will add some more pectin in the future. My one problem with the recipe is the sweetness, I think 4.5 cups of sugar is way too much. This is probably the sweetest spread I've ever had, either from a store or kitchen. 3 cups sugar, probably 2.25-2.5 oz pectin and the same cooking method in the batches to come - thanks for the recipe Kevin :)

This recipe fills approximately 24-26 4oz Ball jam jars. Used this recipe to make 4oz jam jars as the guest favor at my wedding. Remove RIPE peach skin with the following process: Make a small X at the base of the peach with a paring knife. Dip in boiling water for about 30 seconds to a minute. Dunk hot peaches into a bowl of ice water. Slip off the skins, but be careful now, the naked peaches are slippery. Once all measured peaches are back in the pot along with the sugar, the chunks need to be smashed up according to the consistency of jam you prefer. This is easily done with a potato masher. 
I put a round white sticker on top of the jar lid after sterilizing the jars in a water bath (used my All American Canner, a marvelous canning accessory!) and wrote each guests' name on it. That doubled my guest favor as a place marker for the seating arrangement. My wedding guests loved the gift, got fantastic reviews. One guest used it as an ice cream topping. Others just spread it on toast. 
I made several batches and they varied in consistency, not sure if this was due to not keeping the jam in the hot pot long enough to thicken more or if the ripeness of the peaches (or rather, lack of) influenced the overall result. The only "complaint" I got was that (and mostly only the men said this), "It's too sweet." Otherwise, very good, simple recipe, will use again and again.

We didn't change a thing on this recipe. Be sure to leave the peels on, as it's good for you health wise, and it adds a wonderful color to the preserves

I have made this a bunch of times, and it always comes out fabulously! I after the first batch, though, I took  another poster's advice, and reduced the sugar.  Some years I add some nutmeg and a cinnamon stick while it's cooking down. This year, I put in a splash of bourbon and a vanilla bean. Yummm! Thanks for the recipe.

I made three batches. 12 peaches is a little misleading b/c it depends on the size of the peaches.
My husband and I cut up the peaches about 8 cups before cooking. I followed the directions to the T on the first batch. The 2nd batch I added cinnamon, awesome I must say and the 3rd batch I mixed the peaches with peppers. Thanks for the great recipe!! My husband and I just had the cinnamon and peaches batch...Yummy!

According to the recipe, you required 12 peaches to make six cups.  I don;t know what size peaches the author used, but I required at least eighteen to twenty so the recipe as it stands is very misleading.

1st time preserve maker here!  I cut this recipe in 1/2 because I didn't have enough peaches and it turned out great!  Perfect consistency, amazing taste.

This recipe is amazing!!  My family just loves it and it was very easy to make.  This was my first time making preserves or canning but it was so easy that my 10 year old daughters made it.

This was my first successful time making peach preserves. The other time I tried was disastrous because of having to skin them (no thanks).    They came out really good and have a nice color. The recipe yielded 3 pints or 6 half pints. Instead of using 12 peaches (since the ones on our tree this year were tiny), I just kept pitting and cutting until I had like 7-8 cups of cut up peaches. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon  to the recipe and call them Cinnamon Peach Preserves. I also used liquid pectin instead of dry. And I reduced the sugar to 4 cups and it's still plenty sweet. I gave a jar to my neighbor and she loves them. It's great to have something to do with all the peaches on our tree now. Both my boys love it.

Great recipe...I too had never made preserves before. I did cut the amount of sugar I used in half when I made the 2nd batch. Other than that, the feedback I've received from others has been flattering and positive.

This was my first time making peach preserves or canning anything.  This recipe turned out wonderful! I added more of the pectin from a second pouch since they were only 1.75oz  It came out thick and perfect.  A little more on the chunky side than I would like it, but everyone else loves it that way.

This is my first time making any sort of fruit spread, but certainly not my first time cooking.  Thank goodness for that--my preserves were turning into nothing like the recipe or the video.  They weren't very juicy, and even on low heat, they were trying to burn and caramelize at the bottom before they became liquid.  I ended up with a mushy mess (like the consistency of slop) instead of a liquid.  And it was a darker brown, which indicated caramelization.  12 peaches yielded 4 1/2 cups of "liquid" peach.  2 cups sugar sweetened it up plenty, and the final yield was 5 1/2-8 ounce jars.  Much less than expected, but I'll forgive the recipe because it tasted ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  Just be mindful of your peaches as you cook--not all peaches will cook up exactly the same, and no two batches will be alike.  Happy canning!  EDIT:  I made this same recipe and tried to do the exact same thing again.  WAY too sweet, because the peaches actually were a bit overripe.  How to save preserves that are too sweet?  Lemon juice!

I didn't use as many peaches so I cut the recipe down to compensate for that. They didn't seem to set up in my jars as I expected so maybe I did something wrong. The only other complaint I had about it, was if you read this recipe, and I know you're supposed to use your head but the recipe never tells you to put the remainder of the peaches in the pan after you let it boil for one minute with pectin. So I went ahead and put them back in the pan and boiled them for one minute as instructed. It also doesn't tell you what jars use as probably it doesn't matter but I used 12 ounce jars instead of the 8 ounce ones. Maybe I'll have better luck next time. But anyway thanks for sharing

I really liked this recipe, the strange part was that the video said 4 1/2 cups of sugar as well as 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  Based on other reviews I did the 2 1/2 cups and it was perfect. I would have given this 5 stars but as written the recipe would have been too sweet.

This is one of my favorite preserves! The recipe is very easy to follow and it turns out great! If for some reason someone is having issues with it setting I would recommend adding pectin.

Just made last night.  Oh my gosh , Yummy!  I had about 8 cups of peaches so I used a little more sugar everything else the same.  Oops I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg.   A little thin but who care it's really good.  Had it on home made bread for breakfast .  Thanks for a great recipe.  By the way no signs of the skin in the finished product.

I made this using half of the sugar in the recipe and it was still too sweet.  I'll use the recipe again but reduce the sugar to 2 cups at the most. I also added 1 tsp of allspice and 3 tsp. of lemon juice.

My preserves look great and taste delicious.  However, they never "set" like preserves and are more like a syrup (which we will use on pancakes & ice cream).  I followed the recipe exactly except used liquid pectin rather than dry b/c that's all I had.  Not sure why liquid pectin wouldn't work the same as dry?

Really a simple recipe but for those novice canners we need to include some canning basics also with the recipe.  I found that it was too much sugar.  I had 9 extra large peaches and only used 1 cup splenda and 1/2 cup sugar.  Great taste with just the right about of sweetness.  Have made 2 batches and will make more.  Family loves them.

This is a wonderful recipe. Made this with fresh peaches from our farmer's market. I slightly boiled my peaches with their skins on at first, to easily remove the skins about 10-15 minutes Then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I got so many compliments and people requesting that I make more, soon I will have to charge people for this jam...lol. Anyway, thanks for the fabulous recipe, it's like summer in a jar!

This was very good but a bit sweet for my taste. My peaches were very ripe though and full of there own sugars. I find that it make a great pancake syrup alternative. Due to the sweetness of it.  Next time I will use a pectin that can jell with less sugar.

I have made a few batches of this, and it is a great hit.  I am having a bit of trouble getting it to set up, though.  Mine came out thick enough to spread, but also thin enough to use on ice cream, or on pancakes and waffles.  I have had wonderful response from this recipe and i also mixed some of the leftover peaches with blueberries and made a really good jam with this mix!!

I made this as directed. It came perfect I think its important to not get anxious  and jar it before its ready.  i place a saucer in the freezer before I started. I used the cold saucer to test the gel.  When I could put a  teaspoon of the preserves  and run my finger through it with out the preserves trying to run back on itself, I knew it was ready.  I will recommend this recipe to others.

I loved this recipe.  It was so simple I almost couldn't believe it.  I read all about pectin and pros/cons, but in the end I used it and love the recipe as is.  The reviews of other "canners" that don't use it, boil and cool 5Xs to thicken the peaches naturally, but I just didn't want to take that much time.  Maybe when I have a rainy day I'll give that a try, but for now.  This is the one!!!!!

I'm glad I read the reviews prior to making this recipe.  While I love sweet things, I cannot imagine the flavor of this if I would have used 4.5 cups of sugar.  Maybe it's because my peaches were Palisade peaches and they were nice and ripe and already sweet.  I used 2.5 cups of sugar to the 6 cups of peach liquid.  I cut up 24 cups total of peaches, cooked them down with the juice of two small lemons (about 3 ounces), then measured out the 6 cups of peach liquid prior to adding sugar.  I got 3 batches of preserves out of this, with the last batch producing 7.5 cups of peach liquid, and then I adjusted the rest of the ingredients to account for the additional liquid.  Because I'm in Colorado and at an elevation of almost 4800 feet above sea level, I did cook the preserves for two minutes after adding the pectin, rather than one minute, to account for the higher altitude.  I also added one finely chopped, seeded habanero pepper to the last batch at the same time I added the sugar.  I got a total of 24 half-pint jars from my peaches.  The taste is very good and not too sweet, although my husband thinks it's too sweet.  The batch with the habanero came out perfectly.  You can taste the heat but it's not too hot.

I can't say I was totally  happy with this version it was way to sweet. In my second batch I  compared the recipe that came with the pectin box and this one. I used 3 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 4 1/2 cups and 5 cups of peach juice this helped it to set up better. I then ran it through a food mill with the larger hole disk to not have the peach skins.   I also put a tab of butter at the end to not have the foam. With less sugar the peach flavor is much more pronounced

Tried it, liked it. I read the review about the mixture being too sweet-. A few shakes of a salt and a scant of cinnamon cured that. I'd definitely try this recipe again.

Awesome, simple and easy recipe - great for first time making preserves.  I did skin my peaches because I prefer no skins.  While boiling the peaches, I masked all of them with a potato masher.  I also added 4 - 5 ounces of Amaretto to the batch.  The almond flavor did not really come through, even with the amaretto added.  Next time I will opt for almond extract.  Added half the sugar and 2 ounces of pectin.  Turned out perfect for me!  Not runny, spreadable, flavorful jam.  Simple enough for PBJs or adding to yogurts.  Mmmm!  Thanks.

Well, this was a joy to make - no peeling!  Luckily my peaches were free-stone, so the whole process was easy.  I haven't tasted it yet, but am very happy with the results so far.

Added twice the pectin and used 2 additional cups of cooked peaches (total of 8).  This made it thicker and not as sweet.  Very good.

I used double the peaches or so because mine were small. I also cut down the sugar by 1/2 a cup but, it was still a little too sweet for me. It was good however, on top of biscuits. I think the little saltiness from the biscuits made a good balance. Overall, my family really liked it. I even had my aunt ask for the recipe. I think it's worth a try and then from there you could tweak it to however you like.

First time making preserves and this recipe made it easy!!  I am giving it 4 stars because I used 3 cups of sugar instead of the 4.5.  I think it is personal preference.  I will say it didn't get as thick as I would have liked and my granny said it may have been thicker with the additional sugar.  Thanks again I will make again.

I made this recipe this afternoon, it was my first time to make any type of preserve and to work with Peaches. So simple to make, and has great flavor. I have never been a peach lover and was making this for family and friends, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually like it. Thanks for posting it. Will be making more soon.

Wonderful! I made this two seperate times- I was able to make a double batch that would set. I did double my pectin because I wanted it thick. I did only use about 4 cups sugar per recipe.  I also only quartered the peaches then had my kitchen helper 3 year old go at them with a pastry blender and then while cooking I used my immersion blender to make small chunks. So easy!!!!!!

Incredible!  So easy to do, and I loved not having to peel the peaches.  Left some small chunks in the jam but that's how I like it.  Only used 2 cups of sugar and it was plenty.  The only thing I was confused about was removing the peaches from the pan then only putting 6 cups back in.  Didn't follow that part of the recipe.  12 peaches made 12 8-oz jars the first time around.  The next morning I followed the recipe again the same way and it made 10 8-oz jars.  I plan to give these out as Christmas gifts for friends.  Amazing!

I had 12 to 14 large peaches and it made 5 pints each time.  It was runny so I cooked it on med heat for 15 to 20 minutes until it was thicker.  In the 2nd and 3rd batches, I didn't measure the peaches out and just poured the sugar into the peaches and it made 5 pints each time.  In total I made 3 batches and I cooked the first batch the longest and they set.  The 2nd and 3rd batch were not cooked as long and were not as set.  Those haven't been opened yet, but my mother opened her jar and said it was good.  I used South Carolina ripe peaches and peeled by hand because I had to cut out some bad places.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does need to cook longer to make it thicker.  This was my first time at making peach preserves.  Also, the pectin only comes as 1.75 oz and I also used a 2nd package to add 1 tablespoon extra to each batch.  However, my sister said one box would have been sufficient.

I added one navel orange [unpeeled, sliced very thin, slices quartered] to the fruit, maintaining the same 6 cup measurement and ratios going forward.  Have made three batches...Did reduce sugar slightly in one batch.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious and one of the easiest canning recipes ever. I used 15 medium sized peaches that were very juicy, diced them and cooked them on a low boil. Used a hand masher to break them down. Added 3.5 cups of sugar (I like it a bit on the tart side) and 1.5 boxes of Sure Gel Pectin (1.75 oz./box). Processed for 10 minutes as directed, yielded 11 half-pint jars plus a bit extra for tasting. Results: SCRUMPTIOUS! It has a thick, slow pour with fruity bits in it. Now wishing I had made more but peach season is over. Definitely on my list for next year.

This is the best peach preserves recipe! I modified it by cutting down the sugar and using low sugar pectin.  It really is a beautiful pink color.  I can’t make enough to keep friends and family happy.

I had to make a huge change on the amount of peaches.  Not only because mine were small, but also because after watching it boil in the pot it never looked to be 6 cups of liquid!   This was even after doing 30 peaches.   In the end it made 2 cups of liquid so I cut the rest of the ingredients to a little less than half.  The end result was 4 eight oz. jelly jars, which is really all I needed anyway!  So 5 stars on the flavor, but 1 star on the ratio equals 3 stars and yes I will make it again!

I used only 2 cups of sugar per batch and it is nicely sweet but strong on the peach flavor.  I needed about 20 peaches per batch, the equipment of 3 quarts plus a few for good measure. Canned them when I was done.  Yum!

I didn't try this but so far everyone who has, loves it.  Luckily I read reviews first, usually I try not to veer off original recipe as is the first time, but I'm glad I did.  The recipe doesn't mention it but the reviews do.....NOT NECESSARY T PEEL THE SKINS OFF..  and I reduced the sugar down to 2.5 cups.
  ---- recipe says to measure 6 cups of peaches, but I just used whatever I ended up with, I didn't measure.

The peaches I used weren't quite ripe,  after boiling I had to cook for at least double the time (40-45 mins) for the peaches to be tender enough, and during this time I crushed/mashed the peaches.

This recipe made eight 8 oz jars.

I like this easy recipe.  I think the skins add flavor and help thicken the preserves.  I did add some cinnamon, cloves, and a pinch of ginger for a little spice.  It also taste great without the spices!  I had some on a biscuit as soon as it was done.  I am waiting to see how it sets up.  Fingers are crossed : )

Very easy.  I pureed the peaches to get 6 cups since my kids don't like it chunky.  Probably because of that, it was too thick so I had to add about 1/2 cup of water to keep it from splashing around the kitchen when it boiled.  It turned out very well.

We used 12 peaches and it made right at six (6) cups which filled four (4) pint jars. We used only two (2) cups of sugar. We did three jars with no spices and then added Cinnamon, Allspice and Nutmeg to the last jar. It turned out really good. It didnt make enough to share, but it is good to just make some in the evening with little fuss.

My mom made jam all my life.  Now she is in a memory care unit at 94.  She would have never left the skin on the peaches.  When I read about this I was intrigued. I've just finished batch 1 of 4.  This is the best preserves ever.  The color is beautiful from yellow peaches and you can't see the skin at all.  I would recommend:
1. For multiple batches, just freeze all your peaches after cutting up and putting fruit fresh on them.
2. Make sure you have all equipment ready and organized.
3.  DO NOT use as much sugar as the recipe calls for - I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar as many suggested.

I'm making these for Christmas presents.  Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe.  It takes a lot of work out of an otherwise much more laborious task.

Turned out really good but was a little on the sweet side. Nice consistency, i definitely will make again since I have a peach tree in the back yard, I may cut down on the  amount  of sugar though.

I didn’t realize that you didn’t have to peel the peaches! Consequently, I think, my peaches didn’t cook down as they should have, and they weren’t juicy enough. Also, I could tell I wasn’t going to have 6 cups. When I realized what went wrong, I chopped and cooked 3 more. I should have done 4 more, but at this point I was  pretty done with the whole business! I did end up w/3-16 oz. jars, which is what I was aiming for. I followed the suggestions, only used 2 c. of sugar and added 4 1/2 tsp of extra pectin. I think they’re going to be great!!

I used only a cup of sugar for this recipe and ended up with a lovely, flavourful, not-too-tart jam. 4.5 cups of sugar for this was WAY too much when I first tried it, it was syrup and not a jam. Still, simple easy to follow instructions were appreciated.

We have peach trees that are very good producers, so I am always looking for good recipes to use my peaches. We made this recipe as a family 2 years ago, and made 65 jars of this peach preserve. It is excellent! We gave it away to teachers, coaches, friends and family members for Christmas (and kept some for ourselves- which we are still eating, but it's almost gone), and we still get compliments. Definitely recommend, and will be making it again from our peach harvest.

I made double the recipe. Reduced the sugar to 7 1/2 cups instead of 9. This worked well and I like it a bit less sweet.  Used two packages of Certo. I left the skin on the peaches and they really do disappear. I used twelve cups of finely diced peaches. The product looks lovely and set nicely. It thickened well but is not as thick as jam, more like homemade cranberry sauce. The peaches have stayed evenly distributed throughout the product. It made 13 cups of preserves. This turned out very well. It is delicious! It is great on toast and would be excellent with pork or turkey as well. Looks just like in the photo.

Way too much sugar. I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups-  much better. Also reduced the pectin to 1 packet and cooked for 1 hour to thicken. Came out perfect!

Liked that I didn’t have to peel the peaches. Next time I might try a recipe with less sugar. Unfortunately you can’t use less sugar with this type of pectin, or the preserves won’t set.

Used this recipe because half our box of fresh peaches got partially frozen. It IS delish! I love that I didn't have to take the skin off and it does add to the overall texture of the jam. I will def make this again - whether the peaches are partially frozen or not.

We had an abundance of jalapeño peppers from our garden this year, so I added one, seeds and all. It's just the right amount of heat for this delicious recipe! Thank you! BTW, I've NEVER made preserves or canned anything. This was easy!

Easy recipe for first time at canning anything. Our boxes of peaches came with 10 fairly large fruit, so we added a mango to cover the 11th and 12th peach. Added 1/2 tsp each of ground cinnamon and nutmeg to the cooking fruit about 10 minutes in. Did four batches to make 96 1/4 cup jars as favors to a wedding rehearsal dinner. Could not be more pleased!

I had 6 pounds of plums, mostly firm green ones.  They were a bear to pit!  I cooled it and whizzed it in the food processor and then cooked it to 105 degrees C.  It made about 14 half pints. I kept half and gave the other half away.  Delicious!

I am looking forward to trying this recipe, as I have some peaches left over from canning peach pie filling.  The only problem is, I could not find any information in the instructions  regarding adjusting the water bath processing  time for high altitude.  (Maybe I'm just having a "senior moment" and missed the information.)  I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which is above 6,000 feet.   Please let me know ASAP what the adjustment is -- I don't know how long my peaches will last.   :)   Thank you.
Karen

I loved this easy recipe and the results were better than I'd hoped. I've had my fair share of jam failures. I used about 5 cups of fresh peaches and substituted 2 cups of Splenda sugar blend for the sugar. It reduced a lot and ended up making a little over two pints, which is fine because we aren't big jam eaters. The 20 minute boil seemed to be the key in getting it to set. By the time the sugar blend and the pectin went in, it was nice and gooey. And it tasted just like peach cobbler filling!  The next day, it was solid like real jam. Success!!  I will definitely try this one again, maybe adding some spices. Thanks!

I love this jam I made it exactly as written-it is a soft set jam however I don't like a jam that is too rubbery. For people who think it's too sweet what I found was initially tasting from the pot it just seemed like sugar no peach flavour but after I jarred it and it had mellowed for a week or two and I opened a jar the sweetness of it had mellowed and the peach flavour had bloomed and it was just lovely so just keep that in mind if you decide to follow the advice of reviewers saying to taste your jam and add sugar to your taste as its cooking. Also and someone else may have already said this but sugar quantities affect set and safety in the canning process so if you're going to adjust your sugar make sure you understand the canning process so that you won't end up unintentionally cooking up a batch of botulism.

First time I've made any kind of jam. I reduced the sugar by a bit but it was still too sweet for my taste, though delicious all the same.

Thank you for this recipe.  It was my first time making peach preserve and this was a very easy recipe to use.  I used about 12 peaches which resulted in a little over 4 cups when cooked.  I used fresh squeezed lemon in place of pectin and 2 cups of sugar.  I was a little hesitant about using the peels - so I blanched the peaches - but didn't fuss if the skin did not remove easily.  It turned out perfectly.  It made 5 -6oz jars - I hope they make it through the weekend - it is so good we can't stop eating it!

First time making preserves. Followed another reviewers advice, reducing peaches to 10, and sugar to 2.5 cups, and it is still super sweet. I also made mine a little chunkier, as we will be using it as a topping for vanilla ice cream and cheesecake

So easy and so delicious. I made the preserves recipe as is  and then I made a batch where I substituted 1.5 c of brown sugar for the same amount of granulated sugar and added cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg. Both were wonderful. Thanks for this easy and great recipe!

pun intended.
But seriously, very very good.  Made 1/2 as written & 1/2 a spiced version with candied ginger, vanilla paste, cinnamon & cloves.  
A winner either way!

This is a great recipe to make preserves with skins.  I also used 10 cups chopped peaches and 2  1/2 cups sugar. One box pectin and it was plenty firm.

Made a preserve for the first time ever, based on this recipe and turned out fantastic. But I made some modifications. 1) Added 1 large lemon, in order to guarantee mixture will be acidic and prevent botulism. 2) Only used 3 cups - 3.5 cups of sugar as the recipe is too sweet. 3) Pureed half of the peaches, not 1/4 of them. 4) 2 oz of powdered pectin was IMPOSSIBLE to find in NYC. So I used 1/4 cup of "apple pectin tablets", crushed into a powder. I found this in a vitamin store. 5) Once the peaches are boiling, you can add the lemon, then sugar, then pectin directly into the pot and cook until 1 min after boiling. 6) Recipe wasn't clear on this but you should be stirring non-stop the mixture.  You must achieve boiling bubbles while stirring. Also, always add the hot mixture, to heated empty jars or they will crack.

I cut back on sugar to 2 and a half cups that's as sweet as I wanted it. It had a great flavor and the color was was pretty, all that being said I used 1 and a half envelopes of pectin but unfortunately it came out runny and would never set up to bad because it looks and tasted great. If anyone has any ideas how to make this recipe work, I'd love to hear them

I'm in my seventies and have made jams and jellies for years. I've never cared for peach jam because it was too bland. This recipe is flavorful and fragrant. I did add a little fresh ginger and some cinnamon, but it would be fine without.

I used 3 cups of sugar, because I was worried about it being too sweet. It's perfect! I tasted it while putting them in jars and imagined spooning them on homemade pancakes, yum! My peaches were not over ripened, so I had to use my wisk to smash them a little while waiting for them to reduce.

Very simple, and tasty. If you end up with more, or less peaches than 6 cups, the ratio is:
1 cup cooked peaches: 3/4 sugar: 1 tablespoon pectin.

We used mostly under-ripe, hard peaches as instructed in the tips (about 2/3 of all of the peaches were still hard) and it turned out beautifully. Sweet, with just a touch of tart. Set, it reached a thick consistency halfway between cold honey and firm, cuttable jello.
The only changes we made were:
 1) blending the peach chunks since we prefer smooth (I am not sure  where some people in the comments are getting "leave the skin on," but we peeled them first)
2) adding Fruit Fresh Produce Protector (1 tsp per cup of cooked peaches, don't include sugar in that measurement, added at the same time as the pectin) It helps prevent the peach mixture from going brown and the extra acid helps the jam set.
Tips:
-The cooking times are from the onset of a boil (meaning the bubbles don't stop or go away when you stir). Don't start the timer at the first sight of a bubble or things will be underdone and not set. This is especially important if you're making a double batch.
-Stir this a lot to prevent the bottom scorching, but stop and do not stir after the sugar+peaches begins to boil.
-Do not increase the temperature to reduce the cook time. It's tempting with large, slow to heat, batches, but don't. You'll get burnt, caramel-y peach jam.
-If you're the specific type, you need to cook the peaches and sugar together to 220 degrees F. The mixtur

I've made this twice now - both times with great results. Like others, I add some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, and I cut down a bit on the sugar. Love not having to peel peaches. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the amount of peaches should be more precise.  Peaches come in lots of sizes, so "12" is a bit vague. Today I used 15 because I wasn't sure mine were large enough. Also, step 2 has us pour cooked peaches from their pan into a bowl, then put 6 cups back into the pan and add sugar, etc., but there's no mention of what to do with the remaining peaches from which you took the 6 cups. As it happened for me, I only had about 7 cups of cooked fruit, so I didn't worry about separating 6 cups. All these little discrepancies aside, though,  I LOVE the taste, look, and consistency of these preserves and will no doubt make them again.

This is my second time making this.  It has turned out great both times!!! I add just a little bit of cinnamon! (I am sure its still wonderful without it. )Yes, it is sweet but it tastes like summer in a jar!!!
