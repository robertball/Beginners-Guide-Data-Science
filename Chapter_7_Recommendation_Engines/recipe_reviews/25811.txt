All my German friends want this recipe--that's how authentic it tastes. The only changes I made were: 1) instead of boiling the honey and molasses, I just warmed them up in the microwave (which made the dough stiffer and less sticky); and 2) I used a simpler glaze by just whisking together a little powdered sugar with some milk (no cooking necessary). Also, be sure to seal the baked and glazed cookies in a container with a wedge of orange or apple for several hours, then take the fruit out. It softens them up to exactly the right texture.

You need to use a lot of flour when rolling them out.  Don't work the flour into the dough, just coat the outside of the dough & rolling pin with flour.  And work with small amounts at a time.  They are worth the extra trouble.  Make sure they are rolled out to 1/4 inch, any less and they will be too crisp.

I made these cookies on the request of my husband who is a German national living in the US since 1996.  He told me they taste exactly like he remembers his mothers' cookies.  The dough was not sticky at all, but as the previous reviewers complained about the stickiness, I did add about 1/4-1/2 more flour and used plenty when rolling them out.  I think the key was making sure they stayed in the fridge overnight.

A few years ago I had tried a different lebkuchen recipe and although it was good, it paled in comparison to this one.  According to my husband, this was better than the lebkuchen that I usually order from Germany.  

I would agree that this recipe requires chilling overnight in the refrigerator.  To get over the stickiness, I found the following technique useful. Definitely get the back oblaten (communion wafers).  I got the 70mm size.  Set those on a cookie sheet.  Use a cookie scoop and prior to scooping out some dough, dip it in flour.  Coat your hands with flour and take the scooped out dough and roll it into a ball.  Smash it down on one of the back oblaten.  Use your fingers to push the dough out to the edges of the wafers.  The portion size should be about perfect for the 1/4 inch suggested.  If you find your fingers or cookie scoop getting sticky, just coat them with more flour.  You don't have to worry about pulling dough of a roller and you're not mixing in a lot of extra flour.

Although the glaze is really good, I took some of my lebkuchen and coated the tops with melted chocolate.  

I had some difficulty finding citron and hazelnuts but found a really good website that I was able to order both from.

This recipe is a bit darker and spicier than the ones my German mom used to make.  I did find a good way to deal with the sticky dough:  line a 10x15 jellyroll pan w/ parchment.  Take a "wad" of dough with your floured hands and give it the first flattening.  You can probably roll it a little now on your floured surface to even out the thickness.  Fit it into the pan and work another piece.  You can press the seams together so it looks like one big uniform pan full.  When it bakes it all blends together.  I scored it with a pizza cutter before it completely cooled, making later cutting easier.  I cut them into diamond shapes and placed a sliced almond on each after glazing.  They look great.

Lots of German cookie recipes can be a pain because they're so sticky.  Spreading the dough in a pan like for brownies gets rid of the problem - or you can drop it off in spoonfuls and flatten the drops, although this isn't as pretty.

This recipe didn't work for me at all!!! After taking the dough out of the fridge to roll it out, I realized it needed much more flour than the recipe called for. It was super sticky, I added about another cup and a half of flour, but it was still hard to work with. Finally I got so frustrated that I just threw it all away! Don't understand why it was so sticky. Even tried rolling it out between floured waxed paper.

This is a great recipe.  Yes, the dough is VERY sticky-but a lot of German cookie recipes are very sticky.  They remind me a lot of the lebkucken and gingerbread cookies we buy from the german deli every winter-which are the best in my opinion. One way to prevent them from sticking on the bottom is to place them on rice paper or wafers, called Back-oblaten.  I didn't have to bake them as long as recommended.  It took 7-8 min.  I then melted some semisweet chocolate and drizzled the tops of them when they were cool.  They do taste better after a 2-3 days in a sealed container but are still great right out of the oven.  Definately will make again.

These are better than what my mother use to make.  And, they are LESS sticky.  You just have to make sure you use a lot of flour when rolling them out.  I used a round cookie cutter to cut them out .

Definitely refrigerate the dough overnight, but my mom (who got the recipe from my dad's German family) always divided it in two, and then patted each half into a rectangle nearly the total size of a cookie sheet.  Place half a blanched almond where each cookie will be.  When baked, cut lines horizontally and diagonally so cookies are almond shaped.  Saves all that rolling!  Also, make a least A MONTH in advance and put away in a tin to age.  The rule in my family was if the lebkuchen hasn't been made by Thanksgiving, it's too late to make it in time for xmas!  It's good any time -- no oil, so it's practically fat free!  Did you notice?  Haven't tried this version yet so can't accurately rate the comparable flavor --

Very nice. My friend gave me some Lebkuchen last year's Christmas and I've always wanted to recreate them. These were nice and the spices were perfect. I love the texture.
For me, I kept the batter in a bowl overnight in the fridge and the next day, took out half-tablespoonfuls of batter, rolled it up into a ball, place it on some parchment paper, layered another sheet over it and pressed it flat with the underside of a glass until it's 1/4 inch thick. Then, I slowly peel off the layer of parchment between the glass and the cookie dough. Not much of a mess. Will definitely make again.

Our family recipe is a little simpler but very close.  One thing we do is to mellow them.  this was the hardest part as a kid we so desperately wanted to eat them right then and there.  Most bakery Lebkuchen are too wimpy and crispy for me, chewy is where it's at.    Store in an airtight container for a few days. Add a cut orange or apple. remember fruit molds so change the fruit frequently.

I have been looking for a good recipe to make these cookies for a long time - when I was growing up in England, we used to have a constant supply of lebkuchen in the cupboard at Christmas time; a gift from German friends.  I used to sneak them up to my bedroom after supper! I followed the recipe to the letter except for one thing - I didn't have candied citrus, but I did have dried lemon peel from the local wholefood store, so I soaked 1/3 cup of dried lemon peel in the juice of half a lemon (the juice of the other half I used as directed in the rest of the recipe) for the time it took to boil the honey and molasses and assemble the rest of the ingredients.   This was a long shot! After chilling the batter in the fridge for a good 24 hours, I made sure that the rolling pin and board were well-floured, and rolled out small batches.  I used a 3-inch cookie cutter to stamp out rounds. Just make sure that you dab the cookie cutter in flour and keep the board well-floured, and you should be fine. The result was fantastic - I think the lemon peel made the cookies a bit "munchy" but they weren't tart, which was my only concern.  It's quite easy to find recipes to make candied citrus online, otherwise. This is a great recipe!  I iced some, and spread chocolate on others.  I have been eating them all day.  Not sure I'll be doing the storage thing with the fruit juice! Thank you for the recipe.

This is the same as my Oma's recipe, It gets better as it ages.  She would hide a box of them from us.
 - I also use the microwave to do the molasses and honey, much simpler clean up.
 - The stickiness I solved not with flour, but with an oil spray like Pam. Keeps stuff from sticking, and no extra flour taste.  
 - Also, keep it chilled and only bring out of the fridge what you can cut  for 2 pans at a time (my oven size)
 - Make sure you space them right, they will spread.

I made this in preparation for Christmas. They came out just like the German cookies but I couldn't get the baking time right. When left for 10 minutes the became too hard. Either my cookies were too thin or my oven too "strong". My second batch (around 7 min) came out great. My husband loves them, even the rock hard ones (!!!). Perfect for the holidays. Next time I will be adding some chocolate glaze.

These are amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't roll them out but made little 1-inch balls of dough and then pressed them lightly to create little "domes". Much less hassle! I was at first worried that it they would be too sweet (especially after glazing them in more sugar), but they are perfect! My favourite recipe this season!

I have been using a recipe similar to this for over 40 years.  It came to me from my Cincinnati-born grandmother (1882-1964) of German heritage.  The only difference is the addition of 1 teaspoon of ground ginger and I use chopped pecans, which makes it the American version.  I also use 3 packed cups of flour so the dough is not so sticky for handling and bake at 375 for 15 minutes.  I have used a dog-bone-shaped cookie cutter for fun but usually just roll and cut into rectangles, 24 per batch.  Never have had the patience to wait a few days for mellowing.  Select family members get some each Christmas.  It is a lot of work but worth the effort.

These cookies are very tasty. I don't grease my cookie sheets, I use either parchment or silicone mats.  These stuck to my silicone mats. Parchment worked fine.  I live in a town with a large military population, and I think I'll just buy these from the pros at my local german bakery. I only gave them three stars because of the stickiness, taste is a five!

i made these for my opa's 84th birthday a few weeks ago, and he loved them (so did everyone else, but i wanted to make them special for him since he came over from germany when he was 25). i told him i couldn't remember the name of them, but when he bit into one, he immediately said, "lebkuchen!" and he said how they reminded him of germany. success! that is exactly what i wanted

i made the recipe exactly as stated, but i did do packed cups of flour. also, instead of cookies, i rolled out the dough on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and baked them for 8 minutes. they stayed chewy soft and were REALLY good. i made the mistake of brushing on the sugar syrup over the whole rolled out sheet of cookie (thinking it would save time than brushing each one), but it dries so fast, that when i cut them into bars, the sugar coating cracked all over the place hahaha...still tasted super good! just next time i would take the extra time and brush each cut-out bar. i am going to add a photo to the gallery so you can see what i mean! 

these were fabulous though, and everyone loved them, especially my german native opa! :)

Well, I didn't have the stickiness issue that many others had, but I had a terrible time with the glaze that is supposed to go on top. It just got really gooey and nasty. The cookies were very hard if they were just a smidge less than 1/4" thick. The taste was okay, but the glaze was a disaster!

Loved making this recipe, i thought it tasted just like real german lebkuchen, which i love! Only downside is that the sugar topping didn't work out from me. However, this didn't detract from the finished product which was still great. When rolling out the dough i would recommend not putting too much flour on your surface but just rubbing in a little bit to the top and bottom (after every couple of rolls out) this kept the dough nice and not too floury but also helped it roll out very easily! 
i could even easily cut mine out into star shapes which i was impressed with!

Very good.  My German colleagues loved them and want me to try their family recipe here in the states.

My mother gave me this recipe 50 years ago, and I have struggled with the same sticky dough problem.  This is my solution.   I rolled the dough 1/4 inch thick between two pieces of parchment paper, put it in the freezer, then cut out cookies using cooking shears, leaving the paper on the cookie.  Put pieces on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, bake, them peel papers off cookies when done.  I like 1 tsp grated lemon peel in the glaze.

I had no problems with the dough. Just make sure it's really cold and you use lots of flour. Honestly it wasn't harder than cutouts for me. However the icing was another issue. Must have let it get too hot because it turned hard as a rock  soon as I added the powdered sugar.  I'll try to find another recipe that will give me that outer shell I remember. The reason for the 4 stars is that this was a little chewier than I remember as a kid.  Still close though

Two stars only because the cookies tasted okay in the end, but everything other step was a giant mess. The dough came together okay, but seemed too wet so it shouldn't have been a surprise when it was still a sticky mess after refrigerating overnight. I think I added at least another 3/4 C of flour trying to roll out the dough. When I finally did get it rolled out, the dough stuck to the knife I was using to try to cut our the squares! I eventually gave up and rolled the dough into balls. I baked the first batch on a silicone mat and even after baking 12 minutes the cookies still stuck to the silicone! The only success I had was a second batch which was baked a bit longer and on parchment paper. After all the work to bake the cookies I couldn't even think about making a glaze, so I can't speak to that. For anyone who wants to make this, the flavor is good, but be prepared to add another 1+ cups of flour if you want to make squares and don't bake on anything other than parchment paper.

I made the recipe exactly as written! I didn't find the dough difficult to work with at all, the key is to refrigerate it overnight, and work with small pieces of dough at a time while leaving the remaining dough in the fridge until ready to use. Now, the texture is very good, however, the one thing I will change for the next time I make these is to omit the citron. It really is too sweet and does nothing for the flavor of this cookie at all. I don't recall there being citron in the type of lebkuchen I ate as a child living in Germany. I didn't glaze the cookies because they were already very sweet.

I just finished baking. This recipe is perfect! My intention was to make these now and hide them for Christmas. Well, it did not worked. They taste so good and smell so tempting.... I will make them again for sure!

These came out great. I loved the amount of spices in the cookies. Some things I changed: I made my own candied lemon peel the day before. I also didn't like the sugar glaze that this recipe uses, as it left my cookies looking glossy and sticky, unlike the frosty and matte I was expecting. I just mixed powdered sugar and warm water to a paste-like consistency and spread it on the cookie. I also dipped the bottom of the cookies in chocolate. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and put the cookies in a container with an apple slice to soften them up.

As always it’s hard to stir roll and cut but it’s one of my favorite cookies. Be sure to mellow them with the apple before eating. This makes this a great make ahead cookie for Christmas

Made it exactly as written. Definitely refrigerate overnight for easier handling of the sticky dough. Only use “ fancy” molasses. These cookies taste fantastic!

Honestly, I haven't tried too many German type cookies even though I am of German heritage but I imagine these must be what German cookies are supposed to taste like!  I really liked these cookies but only gave them 4 stars because of the time consumption and the glaze.  However, I am super glad I had the time to make these and will be adding them to my Christmas rotation, just might try some of the other suggestions which seemed to be less time consuming.  I also was unable to find candied citron but made my own candied lemon peels which turned out fabulous.  That icing though, as nice and crisp a texture it gave to the cookies, it was a hot mess and just clumpy and gunky after the first go around with icing.  I took the advice of adding in some water to help keep it from clumping and heating it a little more which worked but not for long so I ended up, halfway through icing the cookies, just starting over with a milk and powdered sugar icing, which I think tastes the same just not quite the crispy (if that is even the right word for it) coating like the other.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I love these cookies.  Used walnuts and pecans instead of hazelnuts, since I have these on hand.  Also substituted cherries   for the citron for same reason as the nuts.  Other than that I follow the recipe almost as written, and was happy to find my old friend Lebkuchen again after losing the recipe 35 years ago during a move.  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe on your site.
