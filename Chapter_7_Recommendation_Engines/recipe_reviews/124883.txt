I used real maple syrup instead of the flavoring, delicious.  Be sure to use REAL maple syrup and not the imitation stuff.

Quite a delicious concoction, although I wouldn't really call it hot chocolate.  My 3 boys called it "praline cocoa", as it tastes just like my homemade maple pralines.  It's delicious as printed, although next time I will double the amount of cocoa powder to enhance the chocolate flavor & reduce the maple flavoring a bit.  It's very unique & a nice change from the ordinary. Thanks!

A great taste, slightly different from standard hot cocoa.  I took other reviewers' advice and added extra cocoa powder. Also, try whipping/frothing some of the milk for a great foamy texture.

AMAZING!  I didn't have marshmallows, but it was fine without them.  I also used real maple syrup (naturally :P)

I omitted the marshmallows... And it was great! It didn't even taste like chocolate, but more like praline, as was mentioned before. Next time, though, I think I will add a little more cocoa power, use 3/4 milk and 1/4 half and half and no butter/margarine, and possibly add a pinch of cinnamon. Needless to say, I will be playing around with this recipe a lot!

Delicious! Instead of maple flavouring/syrup, I just added more cocoa. Chocolately and creamy.

MMMMM! This was so delicious! Even my picky siblings enjoyed it. My Brother says he will never use powder again. I really enjoyed the maple twist, just be careful because it is REALLY hot at first.

Darlene, THANK YOU so much! I've been on a hunt for the best cocoa and this is hands down the best I've ever had. I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon cocoa to make it even more chocolatey. Perfect for the chilly days here in the Northwest :)

This was a tad to mapely tasting for me. Maybe, adding another spoon of cocoa, as others suggested would have been perfect. I did like the texture in that it was kind of thick and foamy. I wish though the directions would have said wait 5 minutes or longer to drink, because this was "SUPER HOT"!!!  Edit note: I added milk to my cup and it cut through the heat and made the maple flavoring a little more mild, and was perfect then!

I wanted to follow the recipe, but I just couldn't bring myself to add butter to something I was going to drink, so I left it out.  I just thought that it would leave a greasy feeling in my mouth.  No worries - this was excellent without it.  It smells fantastic.  Also, I didn't have large marshmallows, so I just guessed on how many mini ones to use.  Topped with whipped cream and a drizzle of maple syrup.  Great flavor!

I completely disagree with other reviews who said to double the amount of cocoa in this recipe.  If you don't like maple, then maybe, but I love maple and thought it was great without the extra chocolate.  I did cut the butter in half, as I was trying to save a few calories, and I didn't notice a difference.  I'd never made hot chocolate from scratch before, and it was suprisingly easy.  Thanks for a great twist on the winter tradition!

This is really good and much better than the regular hot chocolate. I personally thought it was a bit too sweet to my liking so to fix it I add some cold water and a couple of ice cubes.

This was so good!  I added a heaping Tbsp. full of baking chocolate (because I'm like that), but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I loved the uncommon touch of maple flavor, it was just what I was looking for when I set out to find a hot chocolate recipe.

Yummy! I made this for my boys and I to go with our scones at breakfast. I also used real maple syrup in the cocoa, instead of maple flavoring. Really, really good. No more basic cocoa for us!

Good recipe!  Was really just looking for a hot chocolate recipe with what I had in the cabinet.  Omitted the maple, at least doubled the cocoa powder.  Came out delicious!

I tried this recipe but was disappointed, for 4 cups of milk i would recommend double the cococa & sugar.  Also melt your marshmallows in the sauce pan with the cocoa BEFORE adding the milk or alse you will be there forever trying to melt them. I used real maple syrup, I didn't taste it at all.  I will keep looking for a hot chocolate recipe :(

Best, Tastiest Hot Chocolate ever! Even tops the Swiss Miss' Chocolate Mix. I got interested into trying this recipe because my boyfriend really goes ga-ga over maple syrup. And he went ga-ga over this!

I, too, took the others' advice to use maple syrup. I didn't have any marshmallows on hand, so I mixed in 3/4 pack of gelatine and added 2 tbsp. of sugar and 1.5 tbsp of maple syrup, plus I tossed in another 1/2 tbsp of cocoa powder, because it tasted a bit bland without the marshmallows. I also used margarine instead of butter. It tasted super!

We used 2 tsps of real maple syrup instead of extract and doubled the cocoa and still found it a bit weak on taste.  Next time I would add more of both to give it more flavour.  The creamy texture was nice though.

This was delicious! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and was the perfect texture. Mine only had a touch of maple flavour (Must depend on the quality extract used, as others didn't seem to have that problem), so next time I will add some pure maple syrup.

This is the best hot drink I have ever had, though I don't think I would call it hot cocoa.  It tastes more like creamy maple sap.  I did everything exactly as the recipe said, except we were out of large marshmallows so I used 10 little ones per big one.

mmmmm....perfect! My husband loved it and he never likes milk-based hot chocolate. :) I put almost half the sugar, vanilla and maple extract in and use half the marshmallows to make it perfect for our tastes.

Mmmm, this was fabulous! Worth the extra effort. Cut the butter to 1 tsp., no more is needed, and 8 marshmallows in total is plenty. But treat yourself to this.

This is definetely the best hot chocolate I've ever had. I didnt have any large marshmallows, so I replaced them with 8 small handfulls of mini marshmallow, and instead of adding a marshmallow on the top, I used a spoonful of whipped cream and sprinkeled some cinnamon on. Then I drizzeled it with chocolate syrup and it was beautiful. This is certainly the best hot chocolate recipe and i will be coming back to it again and again!

Amazing!  I doubled cocoa to 2 tablespoons and used 1 tablespoon real maple syrup since I didn't have maple flavoring.  I'll never buy Swiss Miss again.  lol

This is a great recipe.  I made big batches of this to sell at a Fall fundraiser and it was a tremendous hit. Because it was a Sorghum Festival, I substituted sorghum for the maple, increasing it by 1/2 teaspoon, and decreased the vanilla by 1/2 teaspoon.  I have also made this replacing the maple with rum flavoring.  It's always good.

This is so yummy, I've made it twice in one week!  I added extra cocoa, rum, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  So good!

Used cinnamon extract instead of maple and it made a wonderful Mexican hot chocolate! I think melting the marshmallows and adding the butter really set this apart from the others. Thanks for the recipe!

A great chilly day standard. Especially useful when you do not have any instant mix on hand. I too used real maple syrup instead of flavoring, and it works fine without marshmallows, if you don't have any.

This was absolutely wonderful! I didn't have any maple flavor on hand so i used peppermint and it was still just as good. i did add extra chocolate and marshmellows since you can never have to much and it made it just that much more creamy. also only used 2 cups of milk instead of 4. Yummy! this is now a daily drink when it gets cold.

Very nice! Not so overly sweet that it makes a person cringe! I added about 3 tablespoons of cocoa because I like mine to have some extra chocolate flavor. Very nice, thank you!

This was too sweet for me, and I just didn't like the maple flavor. I guess it all depends on personal preference. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'll make it again. Thanks for sharing this recipe, though. :-)
