I decided to try this because it sounded good to me. My husband wasn't too thrilled to try it because of all the spinach and tomatoes but absolutely loved it once he tried it. I used less spinach because it wouldn't all fit into my skillet. I also used a different dressing than called for: KRAFT tuscan italian. The commissary here didn't carry the other kind. It still came out fabulous. My husband scarfed it down and complimented it over and over. Great recipe.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used frozen spinach, canned tomatoes and noodles instead of rice.  I also olive oil instead of the salad dressing.  I sauted about 1/4 cup of chopped onions and a clove of garlic...next time I'll use more and maybe some mushrooms. I cooked the noodles separately for about half the usual time and then added it to the chicken and broth to simmer for 5 min or so.  I also added some nutmeg -- again I'll use more next time.  But it was quite good and I WILL make it again.  Thanks.

I wasn't thrilled about making this, but I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to give it a try.  I used more spices- italian seasoning, some real garlic and cracked pepper.  It turned out much better than I expected and my husband asked that I make it again.  Very easy to make and easy to clean up!

This recipe was ok as a quick meal, but I'm not sure if I would make it again - I would definitely have to spruce it up more.  I did add garlic, salt and pepper which helped.  It only calls for 10oz. of liquid, but since I didn't use quick rice, I ended up having to use about 3-3 1/2 cups of chicken broth and had to keep stirring to keep it from burning on the bottom.  Just an o.k recipe

We just got done eating this!!! My fiance was craving chicken casserole, must have rice, must be creamy.  I stumbled onto this one.  I prepped it earlier today so that when he got home I could just throw it in the skillet.  It was so yummy. I added sliced mushrooms with the chicken then a few more after the rice.  I couldn't find the dressing asked for so I used Kraft's Vidalia Onion Vinegrette instead.  My man & I loved it!

This is really good! While I was preparing it I learned I needed to replace BOTH a/c and heating unit to the tune of $6k. I wasn't focused, yet it came out excellent.  More like a risotto.  First I used regular Uncle Ben's and cooked beforehand for about 12 minutes instead of the 20.  I added minced garlic when adding chicken to the salad dressing, used frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry), canned tomatoes, AND, because I wasn't paying attention, I used an ENTIRE block of fat free cream cheese.  It was absolutely delicious.  Oh, I also used Kraft Italian dressing because that's what I had on hand ... family really, really loved it.  Will do again, the way I did it :-) !  Enjoy!

I liked this dish. It's not for everybody but if you like spinach and tomatoes it's great! My grocery store didn't have the dressing so I browned the chicken in olive oil first and then went ahead with the other ingredients. If you wanted some crunch, you could chop up some water chestnuts. I'll make this again!

Flavors and texture were nice.  Used only one skillet and a cutting board - loved that.  I used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and added a bit of the reserved juice to the chicken broth.  Also seasoned chicken with lemon pepper before cooking.  Will make again.

This was awesome and even better than I expected!  We used instant brown rice instead of white and canned tomatoes.  We loved this and would totally make it again, it is very easy and delicious!

This was really good!  I used it as a side dish, so I didn't use the chicken.  I used 5 oz. frozen spinach and 5 oz. frozen broccoli.  I would definitely recommend and I'll definitely try it as a main course with chicken sometime.

This was quick and easy, I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I already had cooked rice and chicken in my fridge but it was delicious.  Also, I didn't have the salad dressing but used salsa, still good.

I really liked this... I used diced tomatoes instead of chopped and a different dressing (a type of Italian) but it turned out great. Next time I will add a little more tomato and make sure to follow instructions and get the low sodium chicken broth (I didn't get that and mine was quite salty) But it was yummy!

My husband and I thought this was pretty good, as we like creamy, chicken, and rice dishes. I did think it was a little "thick". We made two changes. We cooked the rice seperately in chicken flavored water and stirred it in to the main pot after the chicken was cooked. (We did not have instant rice.) We also used fat free cream cheese, and I'm sure this is where part of the taste/thickness issue comes from. Everything else was the same. I'm considering using an alfredo or cream based soup along with the cream cheese next time. I also want to use more spinach or other veggies. Pretty good though, just needs a few changes.

Easy, and delicious.  I used chicken that I pre-cook and freeze for when I need it, and only put it in the hot broth-rice mixture for a few minutes so it would thaw but not over-cook.  As other users have noted, I couldn't find the dressing they specify, so I've simply used low-fat Italian.  I've made this several times now, and it never disappoints.

I love this recipe, I make it at least once a month.  Instead of instant rice, I cook regular rice with chicken broth in my rice cooker, and used canned Italian tomatoes and leave the liquid in (to replace the lost liquid form not adding chicken broth to the chicken part).  At the end I add the rice and mix it all together.  Everyone who tries it loves it.

I loved this! I used pasta instead of rice and pre cooked everything, mixing it all together in the end. i used the light peppercorn ranch dressing I had on hand. I added roasted red peppers, italian seasoning, cayenne pepper,onions, seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper, boiled the pasta in the chicken broth,  used canned tomatoes with chiles (i like it spicy). It turned out great! Can't wait to take it to work tomorrow for my tasters.

Great recipe!! Definitely needed more seasoning though!  Added oregano, thyme, nutmeg and fresh parsley at the end.  I also used more Parmesan cheese but that's just our taste!!

so this was different. I had leftover chicken I needed to use, so I followed the ideas of other reviewers and did this... use olive oil to saute 1/2 cup onion and a couple cloves of minced garlic. Meanwhile, cook the rice in chicken brother in a different pot. Cube the cooked chicken, add it, the cream cheese, and the spinach to the onion mixture. There was no real liquid in there, so I added another 2-3 oz of cream cheese, figuring it couldn't hurt because so many reviewers put in 8 oz. After the spinach wilted (which took more like 5 min than 2) I added in the cooked rice. There wasn't enough holding it all together so I added 2-3 T of sour cream, stirred and heated. No tomatoes. It was okay... not enough flavor. I think maybe I'd eliminate the chicken and just use it as a side dish.

I will be honest we love Rice dishes and this will not be on my make again list. I read all the reviews and sauteed chicken in olive oil with garlic. Added some salt and pepper since all the ingredients I used were organic which means they are lower in sodium and it was still bland. I also used chicken broth. I can not imagine how bland this would be if I did not add these additional ingredients. This is more like a risotto than a rice dish. If you like thick creamy type of rice this is your dish. Definitely not something to serve your children; mine didn't like it.  Mind you my child is a really good eater and will eat Arabic food, sushi and other adult type meals at the age of 7! Not sure what to do with the left overs because I kinda feel that way too. :(  It is not horrible but definitely a thick creamy rice type dish. Because you have to stir in the melted cream cheese and spinach it becomes very risotto like. Knowing this now if I were to make this again I would increase the Parmesan cheese and probably cook it with shrimp instead!

This is a satisfying weeknight meal.  Quick to put together and a complete dish in one.  I used 2-3 chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces then marinated in the dressing for a couple hours.  I also used a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth and half a block of low fat cream cheese.  Followed the cooking directions other than those changes.  Will keep this recipe on hand.

Love this! Used a whole brick of cream cheese, added chopped onion and fresh garlic, and some spices for taste. Will definitely use this recipe again

It is pretty easy and a decent dish.  I don't think I'll make it again though unless I can think of a way to spruce it up a little.  I did add garlic to the mix but still found it a little on the bland side.

This was very good! I made it twice, and both times there were hardly any leftovers, and the little bit we had as leftovers was eaten the very next day. I did no alterations, and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy!!! My husband and I really liked it.  It wasn't your typical chicken and rice dish.  It was really good with all the veggies!  It definitely needs salt and pepper.  I made some changes based on the ingredients I had on hand: I cooked the rice in a rice cooker separately with water instead of broth.  I cooked the chicken in the skillet with regular italian dressing and olive oil and added about 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I salted and peppered the chicken as well.  I cooked that until done and added the cream cheese and spinach as directed.  I also roasted a red pepper in the broiler meanwhile.  Then cooled and peeled it.  I chopped it with the tomatoes and added them at the end until heated. Then I mixed in the rice and topped with parmesan. It was almost like a alfredo sauce with veggies added in.  I love hot parmesan spinach dip so this was a great recipe for my husband and I.  We will definitely enjoy this meal again!

This is one of my favorite quick 1 pan dinners.  everything is easy to pickup at the store and there is little to no prep work.
