My husband and I loved this recipe! I only made half of the berbere mix since the recipe makes a large amount and I still have plenty left over to make this dish again. I served it over rice with a side of okra and tomatoes. The next night I shredded the chicken and added red lentils to the sauce and it made a delicious thick stew. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This is a great recipe if you like spicey food.  Great flavor and a hearty meal that is different than others.  We are it with injera and garlic brown rice.  I recommend taking the cooked chicken out of the sauce, shredding it, and then returning it back to the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe.  The flavors blend well together.  If you don't like spicy food, reduce the cayenne pepper.  But for me, the heat was not too much.  It reminds me of Indian food, that is the best way I can describe the dish.   This has strong flavors which I can appreciate.  I put it over a bed of rice.  Very nice.

Very nice flavour and just enough heat.
