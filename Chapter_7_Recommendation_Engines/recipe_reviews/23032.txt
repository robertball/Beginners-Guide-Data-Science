Great recipe that is quick and easy to put together.   Be careful not to add in the light corn syrup twice however...writing the recipe with a 1/4 cup of syrup in each part would be easier.  Tastes great though and a nice addition to our Thanksgiving meal!

Excellent. Traditional  with a extra bonus of swirled cream cheese.   My family loved it.  I will definately keep this in my favorite file.

Fantastic!  I agree with the previous reviewers - because of the way the recipe is written, it's easy to make a mistake with the corn syrup, and add too much to the cream cheese mixture. But if you follow the directions carefully, you will end up with a fabulous, fluffy pumpkin pie, enhanced with chunks of sweetened cream cheese. One other note - I used homemade pie crust, and only needed a regular 9-inch pie plate. The recipe calls for a deep dish crust, which seems a little excessive for the amount of filling.

I have this recipe a 3 because it was just "average".  I expected more of the cream cheese flavor.  I even used 4 ounces of cream cheese hoping for additional flavor.  The pumpkin pie flavor simply overpowered the cream cheese.    This pie was good, but was like any other pumpkin pie I have ever had.  With this recipe, I expected a positive twist on an old favorite.  I brought this pie to a family dinner for 6 adults and had over half of it left at the end of the night.  I did make the crust from scratch with plain graham crackers, sugar and butter.  I highly recommend anyone making any pumpkin pie use a hand made crust.  It was the best part of this pie and not difficult at all.

I had two pie crusts, so I doubled this recipe...roughly. I used a whole can of pumpkin and a whole can of evaporated milk. I also used a whole 8 oz cream cheese.  Everything else got doubled. This was a delicious pie! We liked it better than my familyâ€™s regular pumpkin pie recipe. It was easy, too. I will definitely make it again!

This was great. Easy directions. I didn't have any corn syrup and I didn't want to buy a whole bottle for this, so I used molasses (may not be everyone's cup of tea) and we loved it! But I had to leave it in a lot longer.

Great recipe! My family absolutely loved it! Not sure why this doesn't have more reviews considering it was featured in the Allrecipes magazine. So I will just say I have made this twice since Thanksgiving and it's been a huge hit and I haven't  changed a thing about the recipe. It's perfect the way it is!

I cooked it for 70 minutes and it still didnt set. Im thinking that I shouldnt have added the corn syrup twice. I wish I would have seen that comment before I wasted time and money

Use more cream cheese stuff, and layer it directly into the pie instead of pouring it on top. Added vanilla to pumpkin part too.
