Made this tonight for our family (including 3 boys 7 5 2). I usually don't stick too close to the recipe but wanted to this time so that I could write an accurate review (only changes I made was I shredded my own cabbage with a carrot in place of the coleslaw mix). The chicken was VERY good. Tasty without being an overwhelming or boring flavor. I will definitely be doing thighs this way again. Bonus it was super easy and quick!! The wilted salad met with more mixed reviews. My husband and two year old enjoyed the flavor. The rest of us ate it but didn't LOVE the caraway seed. I think next time I will use a bit of celery seed instead and a little less vinegar in the salad part. We all loved the bacon flavor and the soft crunch of the salad. I liked how the flavors of the two parts of the meal complimented each other. This was a really nice healthy weeknight meal and I will make it again with a few tweaks!

This is awesome. Different spin on cole slaw....did not use caraway seeds....but everything else exactly. Chicken was tender and very flavorful. I did marinate it longer than 30 minutes. Definitly is a keeper!

Excellent! I didn't make the slaw because I didn't have ingredients but I made the chicken and it was outstanding! Didn't have caraway seeds. It it didn't matter. I served chicken with homemade fried rice.

Wow this was really good. It takes some time to prepare. We ate it with mashed potatoes too. The cole slaw for us only fed 2-3 people fyi.
