My family loved this salad.  It had everything you need in one recipe - meat, veggies, and bread to fill you up.  The only change I made: I didn't have a red wine vinaigrette so I substituted with Sun Dried Tomato dressing, Italian would also work.  Don't over do the dressing though, it should just be some light additional flavoring.

Very good recipe.  I followed it exactly, and it was a huge hit.  It was enough for six, but just barely.  I'll be doubling it the next time.
