This recipe actually turned out really good. It does sound odd but it tasted really good with a few changes: 1) I used my food processor for the cottage cheese because I prefer without the lumps. 2) I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. 3) Used whole wheat flour instead of white. 4) I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I didn't use any sugar because with the maple syrup was enought for my taste. It's a great breakfast with a great source of protein and no fat, if you use fat free cottage cheese. Thanks for the recipe Jennifer, I will definitely make it again!

I submitted the original recipe, and have loved all the comments because now I love these even more with the changes!  I think it now deserves 5 stars, for the improved taste, quality and relative healthiness.  Here's how I now make these: 1) substitute whole wheat flour for the white; 2) substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil; 3) add some cinnamon and vanilla.  They taste better this way, plus I feel better about feeding them to my child.

Oh yes, and the amount as written does NOT make enough... always at least double the recipe.  Actually when I make these, I usually make a 4x recipe and that results in a pretty normal amount of pancakes for my family.

I've been making these for years using 1/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of the 1/3 cup white.  Everyone is surprised that they taste so good, even those who hate cottage cheese!  Great plain or with a bit of orange marmalade or jam. My only indulgence is to butter the griddle a teeny bit.  Delicious!

I made these for my family yesterday...my kids are usually pretty picky, but even they said these pancakes were great!!  I like the recipe because it's so easy, and it packs a lot of protein into pancakes.  I'm always looking for fun, new pancake and waffle recipes, and I'll definitely be using this one again.

Very tender and delicious. I used an immersion blender to smooth the cottage cheese before mixing in the other ingredients. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, added a pinch of salt and a bit of vanilla. A nice, healthy breakfast option.

These really taste like a cheese blintz without any of the fuss.  I absolutely loved this recipe.  They are delicious eaten plain, but any fruit compote, jelly, jam, or syrup would be inspiring.  I added a pinch of salt to make sure the flavour wasn't flat.  And you could easily turn these into a desert pastry by adding a small amount of sugar to the batter.

EDIT: I've now made this 6-7 times in the last few months and have made it much better for us with minor changes.  I follow as directed but add 1 t. baking powder and a splash of milk.  To cook I start with a hot pan and turn the temp down to med at best, cover w/ the lid slightly ajar, and cook more slowly than a usual pancake.  This produces a terrific, low carb, high protein pancake that is not quite so flat or blintz like.  I usually get 5 pancakes, about 5-6" across.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Delicious - and very low carb.  Four servings? - no way! I should have known when I looked at the ingredient list that this was not going to be enough for 4 - it was 2 servings at best.  The commenter who compared them to cheese blintzes was right - they have that consistency, which we happen to like; we did not find them to be fluffy at all (which was ok).  We like pancakes and usually have them over the weekend - this is a new and different one that everyone liked.

This combination of ingredients gives a final texture similar to a quiche.  Used 1 cup 1% cottage cheese, whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, 4 eggs, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1.5 tbsp honey.  Blended everything in a blender to make a smooth batter.  Transferred to a sprayed frying pan and topped with handful of blueberries.  Baked in oven for 15 minutes at 375F.  Turned out great!

This is my new favorite recipe! Soooooo delicious! I will make these pancakes over and over again. My husband and I are training for a marathon (and trying to shed a few pounds) so I'm always looking for high-protein, low-fat, lower-carb meal ideas (not easy to find!). I made some changes to significantly reduce the fat content: I used 1% cottage cheese, 1/2c egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs, and only 1T of oil. I think next time I will try omitting the oil altogether. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla (as suggested by some other reviewers), plus one package of artificial sweetener (could use 2 tsp of sugar instead of artificial sweetener). I also mashed up the cottage cheese a bit with a fork before mixing everything together. These were yummy enough to eat plain but I topped mine with raspberry jam. With all of my substitutions, this ENTIRE recipe contains about 515 calories, 51g protein (woot! woot!), and 13g fat. This recipe makes enough for two people or one really hungry person. By the way, I registered for allrecipes.com just so I could write a review on this recipe! Thanks Jennifer!

So fluffy and delicious.  It's also high in protein and low in carbs.  Next time I will substitute ground rolled oats for the flour.

These are pretty good. As a low carb pancake option they are great. I'm thinking next time I'll use lowfat cottage cheese, use 1 egg and 2 eggwhites just to lower the fat content. Interesting anyhow.

I made these with whole wheat instead of white flour and added a few blueberries to each pancake after pouring the batter onto the griddle.  Very easy to make with a custardy, crepe like texture.

These were great!  Quick and easy.  I used whole wheat flour and a tablespoon of applesauce instead of oil.  The only problem is that "1 serving" is more like "1/2 a serving".

I have used a recipe similar to this and it was wonderful!  It was used in a program for children and they liked it as well.  Instead of syrup, we used a strawberry compote on top.

Loved these, so easy to make. These are not as fluffy as traditional pancakes, but they are very moist and they have a good source of protein from the cottage cheese. A keeper!

My husband just had a Kidney Transplant and is on a special diet. This recipe was perfect for him and we both loved it! I try to give him a variety of foods so as not to get bored. We’re very happy I found this recipe.
I also love that I can change the number of servings and am able to see the break down of calories, carbs, fat and protein. It makes it easier for me to determine which recipes I can use for his needs and keep track of the total amounts for the day. This is so important.

I love the idea of using cottage cheese for most recipes...However, when I saw cottage cheese pancakes I got so excited because I have the biggest sweet tooth but I like to eat healthy. I love the fact that this pancake is a nutritious healthy pancake. I used whole wheat flour, lowfat cottage cheese and applesauce instead of oil. I was able to eat pancakes without scruples! I loved the softer creamy texture although I wish they would have come out fluffier because mine were on the flatter side. Even still, I love the fact that this pancake packs fiber, protein, calcium and vitamin D!

This was very easy and a nice change of pace. I am always looking for more ways to incorporate low fat cottage cheese into my diet, as it's a great source of protein. You can't expect these to taste like traditional pancakes. I too substituted whole wheat flour, applesauce for oil, and egg beaters for eggs. I added baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla based on others reviews. Topped with syrup, these were great!

These are a great healthier version of pancakes that my picky son still loves. However I add 1 cup of plain yogurt and use 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 4 eggs instead. Love peanut butter and agave to top it off!  Sooo delish!!

These are wonderful - my mom used to make these when I was a kid.  I use 1/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of the 1/3 cup AP flour and melted, cooled butter in place of the vegetable oil.  (They are good with the original ingredients but I avoid both these days.)  I also prefer all fruit or jam instead of the syrup, or really, just plain.

Five stars because I assumed this would be another "diet" food that I'd have to choke down while pretending to eat what I wish it was. I have to say, I loved these. The pancakes have the texture of french toast which is great because I love french toast. I mixed equal parts butter and sugar free syrup and heated it up in the microwave and poured a little bit on. It was heaven. I would eat these even if I wasn't on a diet.

So enjoyed this recipe!  I also switched to whole-wheat flour, added 1/2 t. baking powder & 1/4 t. cinnamon.... fantastic! (Also very excited because I made the cottage-cheese, too... I'm living in Africa & we can't buy it here, so made it myself with the milk I had on hand!)

Very good- we had some cottage cheese that needed using up- I loved these - the inside never firmed up- so it gave it a cheesy filling taste - one daughter thought it was a little weird, the six year old loved it, as I did.  It does taste just like a blintz.  We served with blackberries & bananas and had a great easy dinner!

Wow, very surprised at how good these are! I doubled the recipe and used equal parts white and whole wheat flour. Added a tsp. of vanilla too. I followed the advice of a few others and blended my cottage cheese with a stick blender until the lumps were gone before adding the rest of the ingredients. My husband could not get enough of these and both my daughter and I thought they were some of the best pancakes ever! Very pleased to have a pancake breakfast that is packed with nutrition (esp. after adding the whole wheat) and not just an overload of carbs!

Very very good! My husband loves cottage cheese and I do not! But we both really liked these! I did add some vanilla to the batter. Served with fresh strawberries and pure maple syrup on top. So yummy. Between the two of us we finished he whole batch.

These are delicious! I just made them this morning. Since I was making them just for myself, I cut the recipe in 1/3. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter and had them with a little bit of fat free whipped cream. Great healthy weekend breakfast!

Fast, easy and tasty ... A perfect quick Sunday morning recipe. My first batch fell apart because my pan wasn't hot enough. The second batch was golden and delicious. These are similar to an ethnic recipe my mother-in-law gave me, so my husband loves them. Will definitely make again!

I made two changes, using whole wheat flour instead of white and substituting 1 TBS applesauce for 1 of the oil to cut down on fat.  These were good but had a texture similar to french toast instead of pancakes.  Because of the cottage cheese and egg, they were a little "mushy".  If you like the texture to french toast, you will love these.  After the first batch was done I added two additional tablespoons of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  The texture more closely resembled pancakes, which I personally prefer.  Good way to put protein in pancakes.  I will make again, experimenting with the flavor and texture.  Maybe add vanilla next time.

This recipe has potential but HOW you cook it matters a lot. Since the batter is thin (depending upon the consistency of your cottage cheese), make sure you make very small pancakes. It is impossible to flip these if they are large since they stay custardy in the middle. It is also important to use medium, not high, heat. I used applesauce instead of oil and added a little sugar to the second batch.They are good without it but not sweet at all--reminded me of potato pancakes and were yummy served with applesauce and not syrup.

These were a little bizzare- parts of the cottage cheese melted, and they took longer to cook than regular pancakes. Anyway, these are an acquired taste!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used whole wheat flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Excellent!!  My family raved about them.  I will probably never make pancakes any other way!  Thank you for the recipe.

Loved these! I did add some cinnamon, which was nice. I spread them with fig jam. Would also be great with honey. Next time I'm going to add a pinch of salt, though.

Mmmm....just made these ahead of time for b-fast tomorrow.  Hubby is diabetic and had him try a bite.  I tried a bite.  These are really very, very good and you really cannot tell that cottage cheese is the main ingredient.  I used my Magic Bullet to "cream" the cottage cheese in batches.  Then mixed everything listed together, minus one of the eggs.  I added a little vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and a tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and cooked up as instructed.  These are quite tasty, full of protein, and great for those watching blood sugar levels!

Wow... These were not to my liking.  They left an all day after-taste in your mouth of cooked cottage cheese.  And make sure you almost deep fry these things if you ever want to have a clean griddle again... Overall.  Not Great. Or even good.

I was surprised by how much we liked these pancakes.  They are on the eggy side, and as my husband said “They are egging me on to eat them.”  I served them with fresh fruit and a little pure maple syrup.  This recipe makes a great breakfast.

I used blended fat-free cottage cheese, subbed applesauce for oil, used 1 egg and 2 egg whites and added a little sugar & vanilla.  They looked great until you cut into them.  I couldn't get them to cook all the way through -not sure if this is the way they're supposed to be after reading reviews that many people had the same consistency.  I cooked on low-medium heat for much longer than I normally cook pancakes to try and get more of a pancake consistency but it just didn't work.  My two youngest loved them with a little sugar-free jam & a touch of maple syrup.

These remind me of the cottage cheese pancakes my mom made when I was a kid.  Definitely blend in a blender for a smooth texture.  Also, you may want to double the recipe.  My 4 and 2 year old ate most of them.  YUM!

This is similar to a recipe I used to make that my kids (now grown) loved. I remembered making it in a food processor or blender to get rid of the cottage cheese "bumps," as my kids used to say. These just needed a dash of salt to bring out the flavor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. An excellent high-protein breakfast. And to those who got an odd or mushy texture, maybe don't change the recipe with oil substitutes and it will come out the way it was meant to!

I tripled the recipe and added 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla, 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/3 cup sugar (to the tripled recipe). I also used whole wheat pastry flour. They turned out light and fluffy and my picky son preferred them over our usual cottage cheese pancake recipe.

These are fabulous. I've been making them for years. I love how light they are and loaded with protein. Easy to make GF. I use either Bob's Red Mill or Pamela's GF all purpose baking mix instead of the flour.  I also add the vanilla and cinnamon.  Coconut oil is my oil of choice.  Yum, yum.

Did not think these had very good flavor. Seems like it is missing something. My grandma made these when I was younger and I loved them. Must not be the same ingredients as hers.

So simple and doesn't make you feel sick like heavy pancakes can.  I add a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of some really good vanilla.  I make this time and again.  Love

Came out nice and fluffy but a bit bland. Next I'll try adding some vanilla and cinnamon to the mix.

Pretty darn good and super helpful when I'm cutting down on carbs.  Not fluffy and nowhere near a regular pancake, but does satisfy the pancake jones for a while.

Easy and pretty darn good. Like another reviewer said, tasted like cheese blintzes without the effort. Only modification I made was to add a dash of salt.

Next time, try subbing whole wheat flour, and add some ground flax. And add fruit on top! I tried my first batch with maple syrup and also with cherry jam, but I thought the jam was too sweet.

These were edible but not making them again. They had a weird aftertaste to us. (I'm assuming from the cottage cheese). They were better tasting to me with dark chocolate chips in them.

simple, nutritious and delicious. i also added vanilla and cinnamon, changed the AP flour to whole wheat flour and used apple sauce in lieu of oil.  I did use butter for the pan though.  also, i recommend using the quarter cup size for the pancake as it makes it easier to turn over.

My family loved these! We ate them with fresh berries. My son who usually eats barely 2 pancakes ate 4 and wanted more!  I made the batter in the blender and the texture was smooth and fluffy. Will definitely make these again.

I made these for breakfast and they were great.   I used 2% cottage cheese and whole wheat flour.  My husband commented that the flavor reminded him of french toast.  I really like that they are healthier than standard pancakes and will be making them often.

Overall pretty good..I made the first 2 and didn't quite care for the flavor, but then I added a tsp of vanilla to the remaining batter and that set off the flavor.  Great protein/carb combination!

these were so good they disappeared in a flash. I've been told to "make a double dose" next time!  I don't think I've ever seen my 6 year old inhale food this fast. (and btw - a great winter food for little ones with good proteins added!)

Not to my taste. Very eggy, almost like when you leave french toast soaking too long in the egg mixture and it barely holds together. I think if you're wanting something like an easy cheese blintz, this is your recipe. If you're wanting something more like a traditional pancake, you'll find it too wet and heavy. Depending on your tastes you may find this recipe worth more than 3 stars.

Like other reviewers have suggested, I pureed the cheese so there wasn't any lumps. Regardless of your tastes, I think it's an important step.

first of all- YOU DON"T NEED THE OIL! I made these 2 ways with 2 totally different tastes and neither had oil. I cut the recipe to 1/4 cup of cottage cheese and 1 egg and 4 tsp. flour- tasted great. second way was to replace the flour for 1/4 cup of oatmeal (uncooked). surprisingly wonderful. 1st way tastes like an omelet and the oatmeal way tasted more like a pancake w/ more substance. ate both with syrup. thanks! I might add vanilla or honey or banana next time. tons of combos!

Loved this recipe! Regular pancakes make me tired from so many carbs. These give an excellent source of protein from the eggs and cheese! Don't feel as tired later!   I love my pancakes to have a hint of sweetness, so I added about 3 Tbls. sugar. Usually more health conscience, but didn't want to fuss. Turned out superb! Thanks for the great recipe!

I love how simple these are!  I thought they were good, a bit too much egg flavor for my taste, but when you add syrup or other flavor you can't taste the egg.  My toddler son loved them!

Excellent! I hate cottage cheese but I am trying to eat healthier. My son is a huge pancake fan so I whipped up some of these, topped with fruit, for dinner. They were a hit. I probably prefer buttermilk pancakes but the health benefits of these will make me come back to them.

I love the idea of cottage cheese pancakes and these really deliver.  I follow the recipe as written and they turn out delicious!  I enjoy topping them with low carbohydrate jam since the pancakes are fairly low carb.  Fits as a treat on my low carb diet and a great alternative to eating eggs and yogurt for breakfast, which most low carb dieters end up doing.

I just made these with my 3 year old daughter.  Very easy!  She loved them and it's a great way to use up the cottage cheese.  They are more like a blintz.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil.  I usually freeze them and pull them out for snacks or pack in a lunch box.  Maybe next time I'll add peaches and cinnamon.  Thanks!

These are great for disguising a pretty healthy breakfast to children. As others have suggested, I run the cottage cheese through the food processor first. I add a little more dry ingredients than the recipe states because it just seems that it would be too liquid-y otherwise. Good job!

Subbed a lil' over 1 T applesauce for the oil, used whole wheat flour instead of regular, also added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Kids were not crazy about them so don't know if I will make any time soon, but it was a good way to use up cottage cheese near the expiration.

I liked these!  I omitted the oil totally and added a splash of vanilla.  I was a bit shocked as they are not sweet AT ALL (duh), but I thought they were delicious with good ol' maple syrup.  You could easily serve these with jam, jelly, applesauce, etc.  Just remember that these are a savory rather than a sweet pancake.

Topping is important....sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, or top with fruit jam or similar to turn into a delight - otherwise a little meek in flavor.

I have used a recipe for Cottage Cheese Pancakes that uses sour cream instead of the vegetable oil and I really prefer the flavor of those pancakes.

LOVE these pancakes!  I will never make regular pancakes again. I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour (may increase a little), added vanilla and cinnamon.  As a topping I used thawed frozen strawberries with the use as syrup for my picky 2 yer old.  She loved these, as we did also.  I also will try adding parm cheese and garlic to make as a side dish for a meal.  EXCELLENT!

I doubled the recipe, but like another reviewer stated I added 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp of baking powder, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also decided to make these healthier by subbing 1 tsp of oil for flax seed. The texture of these was similar to eggy french toast, so I added cinnamon on top and it was pretty good for being healthy. I froze a batch to have on hand for when I am craving something with syrup.

Wow was this delicious!  I made one serving using a whole egg, 2 egg whites and 1/4c low fat cottage cheese with salt/pepper.    The cottage cheese actually melted and was not lumpy.   The result was a light and creamy delicious eggs!!  I am trying to increase my protein intake and this my now one of my new favorites!!!

I made these as written except I blended the mixture to get rid of the lumps, added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. They were very runny, and the texture was like a very eggy piece of french toast. Our 10 yr old ate his whole pancake, but said they were "squishy." I'm going to try adding some coconut flour to dry up the mixture next time. These are high protein and the kiddo needs to gain some weight, so we'll keep trying!

With tweaks i made i'd give it 5 stars. this is an excellent protein-packed pancake and my kids loved them too drizzled with some maple syurp so it's a huge win!!

i made the following tweaks:
- instead of plain flour i used rolled oats and used 1/2 cup
- i omitted the oil
- used 4 eggs
- added pinch of salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp honey

i blend everything in my blender and let the batter sit for 10 mins. i find this helped the pancakes cook thicker.

Delicious delicious DELICIOUS! Pancakes in less than twenty minutes? Tasty, full of protein, and not absolutely made of carbs? YES! 

I would actually recommend adding dark chocolate chunks. I know it sounds weird and I haven't made it myself, but that is the only thing these are missing, a tiny bit of sweetness. 

Otherwise, these are perfect!

These are really good! They are more like crepes than pancakes. I did expect that from reading the reviews but was happy with the final product. This time I made them with the original recipe but may try them with the author's updated version next time.

These are a good lower carb option. I followed other suggestions of using whole wheat flour, vanilla, and cinnamon. Definitely need to whip this up in the food processor. I can’t see it working without this step. I was generous wiping my grill with oil for cooking, otherwise they are pale and unappetizing looking. Cooked at 375 degrees on my grill. Took a bit longer than traditional pancakes to cook. Next time I’ll add some salt and increase the cinnamon up to 1 tsp., as I found them a bit bland. I used sugar free jam as a topping, but think they’d be great with cinnamon sugar or maple syrup.

I love these. They are low carb, the texture is moist and chewy. I add a little fruit preserves to serve them.  I also make and freeze them. I pop a couple in the toaster oven and have a nice breakfast any day of the week.

Fabulous. Making it again tomorrow. Didn’t have the full amount of cottage cheese so I added some feta.  Also blended the cottage cheese in blender and substituted  pear  applesauce for oil because that’s what I’m making this time of year.

I probably shouldn't add this review since I've not actually made this, but we've made a similar pancake for a long time, substituting  oatmeal for the flour, and mixing in a blender.  Add a dash of milk for thinner pancakes... excellent, and very healthy!

I loved them, but my family didn't.  They are big fans of cheese, but not cottage cheese.  Great source of protein and less carbs, good thing.

The pancake recipie seemed just like what I was looking for - healthy but delicious.   I tried twice but couldn’t flip. They broke apart so I tried cooking them in oil. Then they tasted like oil and still hard to flip. I hope someone else has better luck.

Made with changes from the comments, added vanilla and cinnamon, and topped with cinnamon sugar, yum! Tastes just like the blintzes my mom used to make with a fraction of the effort!

I love this recipe and have made it several times. Always excited when I have some soon to be expired cottage cheese.  I make a batch and freeze for a quick snack before heading out for the day. Great with just a pat of butter.

I absolutely love this recipe. Everyone in the house loves it. I follow the recipe exactly except I add a tad of baking powder each time for s bit of fluff. It’s great savoury or sweet topped. Thank you thank you thank you!!

I want to make these all the time now! I only had 2 eggs but it worked out great. Blended the cheese, added some baking powder and a bit of sugar. It tasted nice and cheesy, not too savory but definitely not a dessert. So light and fluffy, but dense in their own way. I sensed that it needed a bright note, so I added a dash of lemon juice. Enjoyed with alternating plum butter and maple syrup.

We wanted to make pancakes for dinner tonight, but we're out of milk, and we also happen to have some cottage cheese that needed to be used.  I was skeptical at best, but decided to give these a try.  I was even MORE skeptical when I started cooking them, because they just looked weird.  But they were actually pretty good!  I probably won't make them again, just because we rarely have cottage cheese, but they were pretty tasty.  We served them with whipped cream and chocolate chips (I mean, they were pretty healthy, so I figured why not?!?!?! LOL)

I've been making this for decades. I used to always make it when our kids were little and we had a long  day outing ahead - the high protein content really satisfied them so that they didn't get hungry again for hours!  
I do have a few changes:
1.  Put ingredients in the blender and the pour into pan. It tastes better when the batter is smooth plus its easier this way!
2. Halve the oil. I only use 1 Tablespoon per recipe (I usually double the recipe so 2 T oil total).
3. I'm gluten intolerant now so I've adapted the recipe replacing the flour with Pamela's baking & pancake mix (same amount as called for in recipe). Still tastes great.
Also, unlike regular pancakes, these are delicious reheated the next day! I also tried saving the batter to make again but it turns out better and is simpler to just  make all the pancakes at one and then store the leftovers in the fridge for the next day (or two).
My favorite topping is with applesauce & a little maple syrup. My husband prefers with strawberries & Cool Whip.

Horrible cottage cheese pancake recipe.  NO flavor.  No fluff.  I did not think it sounded right and I was correct.  I would never make this recipe again.

I took the suggestion of others and added 1/2 tsp baking powder. They were a bit like crepes in flavor and flattened as they cooled, but were very good! I mixed peanut butter and banana and rolled a couple up for my son's school lunch. He loved them!

We enjoyed the pancakes.   I added frozen blueberries which worked nicely.  The only change I will make next time is to use a 1/4 cup measure of the batter to fry because 1/3 prevented the pancakes from getting done evenly.

I will definitely make it again! I did as the other viewers and added cinnamon, pureed the cottage cheese, whole wheat flour instead of white. My family loved them and we are normally a 'Krusteaz' pancake family.

Nice moist texture.  Different from a typical pancake but still good.  However, I think next time I'd slightly reduce the cottage cheese portion and increase the flour a bit, so there's a little less cheesy taste.

Ugh they were awful - I substituted coconut flour for wheat to make them gluten free, and they tasted very eggy, and the batter was too thick.  I  have made pancakes with cottage cheese before and they were great, but these were awful!

This is a pretty good recipe if you are looking for a healthier alternative to pancakes.  I made the recipe EXACTLY and am rating it as such.  They're a slightly heavier consistency than regular pancakes, and have that slightly sour, cottage cheese taste (but how could you possibly expect them to taste otherwise?)

I don't really like cottage cheese, and the slightly sour taste means I'd have to eat just one or two of these, but they are a good high-protein addition to breakfast.  The oil makes them, very high in fat.  I made 7 little pancakes with this and myfitnesspal says they each have 8g protein, 8g fat and 6 g carbs.

Oh...these are just .....wrong.  The batter was hard to mix, the temperature of the pan was hard to adjust so they'd cook without burning, and the texture was really really bad.  The flavor was good, but getting past the rest of that stuff was definitely not worth it.

Here's my spin on it: I omitted the oil altogether(didn't miss it a bit!) to cut down on the fat content and reduce calories some, used 1/4 c whole wheat flour, 3/4 c egg whites plus 1/2t baking powder and cinnamon. Cottage cheese on hand was 2% but would've preferred fat free so the fat content would be lower. Then I used an immersion type blender.
 So here's the numbers for this version for the full recipe: 445 calories, 5.0g fat, 30mg cholesterol, 1160mg sodium(ouch!), 600mg potassium, 44.5g carbs, and 50.5g protein.
So only 223 calories per serving plus I used spray butter for the topping which adds Zero to any of the above numbers! Very nice texture, color and taste. Will be making this again

Although they tasted good they are more closer to omelettes, there is just not enough flour to form a cake consistency.

Loved it. Really delicious and super easy. Made these for my dad who is diabetic and carb counting.   I added about 8 drops of stevia extract and a little vanilla extract for a little more sweetness then topped with warm strawberries.  Thanks for sharing .

I will def make it again. I used a hand blender to blend up the cottage cheese and followed the rest of the recipe as it is written. The cakes were delicately brown and super tasty. My husband despises cottage cheese, but he ate these up in no time at all. Love the recipe.

I really liked the taste of those pancakes.
I added vanilla and a little salt and some honey, it was really good.
The only downside was that it took very long to cook each one of them. 
I'm glad I was making them today for tomorrow's breakfast, my kids would have never been able to wait this long to eat.

Delicious! Just found out that I'm diabetic and am working on a grain-free diet, so I substituted almond flour for white flour, put the cottage cheese in our magic bullet to smooth out the lumps and added blueberries to the batter before cooking. Quite tasty and filling. Thank you!

Made for passover by substituting just under 1/4 cup potato starch for the flour. Used the immersion blender on the cottage cheese. Added about 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Kids liked them.

I made this as written, and they were a soupy mess that stuck to the pan, and they didn't really taste good. I won't be making these again.

These pancakes are AMAZING - I'm suprised they don't have more reviews. They are not your typical dry pancakes, they are moist and full of protein. I prefer to use "oat flour" instead of regular flour (to make oat flour: put 1-cup of quick oats into your blender for a minute until there are no oat chunks left). I also puree my cottage cheese in the blender so the pancake batter is smooth, not chunky. I usually make a triple-batch of these because they keep well in the fridge for a couple days for quick weekday morning breakfasts. You can either make them all into pancakes and keep them in the fridge cooked, OR you can just make the batter and store it that way. For a triple batch: puree 3-cups of quick oats, 1 (750ml) container of cottage cheese (add milk as necessary to blend, approx 1/3-cup), 10-12 eggs, and some canola oil. You could also toss in some whey protein powder for added protein. They are delish served with either maple syrup or homemade fruit syrup. **Update** I made a triple batch of this pancake batter before our family camping trip and took it along with us. I cooked them up each morning on a cookie sheet over a propane grill (on low), and they were fantastic!! They cooked fast (soon as they dry up around edges, they need to be flipped - approx 1-min each side). These will definitely be a staple camping recipe now!

Added a splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. Family loved it! My son ate with peanut butter and no syrup. Lots of protein and low carb. Thank you

My husband surprised me this morning by making these pancakes.  He used 2/3c flour and added some blueberries. They were fabulous!  A great guilt free pancake with lots of protein.

I have a very picky daughter who has autism.  She gobbled them up!  Would much rather give her these pancakes in the morning than the "typical" ones so you can bet I'll be making them again!  I also used an immersion blender, because if she saw white lumps, forget it!  I didn't add any oil, did add about 1/2 a tsp of baking powder, and a tsp of sugar.

4 stars as written, but adding vanilla and cinnamon and using whole wheat flour made this a 5 star recipe. My kids loved it. I also mixed it in my food processor so there were no lumps.

Here's a couple of keys to this recipe - I took the advice of another reviewer and added vanilla.  I put everything in the blender.  I used cake flour and 2 T melted butter.  The key to this recipe is to use a griddle - not a frying pan.  A griddle helps immensely so you have the room to quickly slide a spatula under each pancake and flip it with ease.  These are somewhat delicate so you would have to be very adept to do this in a frying pan.  I used blueberries, a little butter and real maple syrup.  This made enough for two people - we both enjoyed them and love the fact that it only had 1/3 cup of flour.  You really don't even miss it.  The texture is a little eggy, but not as thin as a crepe.  We loved it and will make in the future!

I LOVED these pancakes, but I found they stuck to the pan like crazy the first time I made them. I add a few tablespoons more flour now and liberally oil the pan first. Sometimes I add two teaspoons of cinnamon for a little extra flavour.

To my kids I'm notorious for making healthified versions of their favorite foods.  Pancakes are no exception.  I was very happy to find this recipe blended my desire for nutrition with my kids desire for tasty foods.  In addition to using whole wheat white flour instead of all purpose, I added some lemon juice to the batter and sprinkled the cooking pancakes with blueberries.  My two kids and I managed to eat them all in one sitting!  I have already bought another carton of cottage cheese so I can make these again.

Won't ever make again.  Smelled okay, and might have tasted okay, but impossible to flip.  Therefore they end up burnt on one side and not cooked at all on the other side.  Took 25 minutes to cook them, and they were inedible.

Great low-fat recipe! I made it even more low-fat and high-protein: omitted the oil at all, substituted oat flour for ap flour (added 1/2c of it), used 0% fat cottage cheese, only 1 egg + 2 egg-whites, some baking powder, salt and stevia. My mom said it's awful, but for me (a girl that lose weight all the time) it was delicious. Thank you!!!

This was delicious! We love the cinnamon-peach pancakes on this site also. The cottage cheese is the key to moist pancakes that fill you up with just a few. I added cinnamon and a bit of flax meal. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour. This recipe only makes a scant dozen, smallish pancakes. We will double next time.

Kids and adults both liked the recipe. I blended the cottage cheese to make it less chunky since I don't actually like cottage cheese. I also went ahead and used whole wheat pastry flour. I would disagree with the serving size. With it as is, it would be 2 dollar size pancakes per serving. So, this recipe is more like 2 serving sizes.

Tasted great! I found I had to cook them a bit longer than normal pancakes, which was fine but cooking them was a learning curve so the first few weren't as impressive as the last. Next time I think I'll blend the cottage cheese to make them smoother as others suggested.

I didn't have enough cottage cheese so I ended up having to substitute 1/2 cup yogurt.  They ended up pretty sweet but that might be because of my changes.  Will try again.

I was leary about how these would turn out, but surprisingly, they were pretty good.  I used 3 egg whites and replaced the oil with 2 Tbsp of applesauce.  I used another reviewers suggestion of putting the batter in a food processor.  I ended up with pancakes that look like normal wheat ones...even the kids ate them!

These are outstanding! I will never eat regular panckaes again! ;) I used 2 eggs and 1 Tbl. flax seed meal in place of one egg. I also creamed the cottage cheese for smoother texture. Add in a dash of real vanilla also! These are rich & filling, full of protein, and a big hit w/ my 5 yr. old! They only served 2 people, so next time I will double the recipe ;)

Great healthy alternative to normal pancakes and that is loaded with protein!  The only changes I made to the recipe was that I mixed in about 3 tbsp of  brown sugar so that I could avoid adding any syrup while eating.  I used 2 tbsp of melted butter instead of oil bc I am not an oil fan and I used 1/3 c of Whole wheat flour . The only thing is that it came out a little thin  a bit mussy which I didn't mind.

These pancakes tasted pretty good.  I made the changes another reader suggested.  I added 1/2tsp baking powder and tsp vanilla.  I also omitted the oil and used some wheat germ.  Next time I am going to add more baking powder as these were super flat. The cottage cheese made lumps in the pancake that made me think they weren't all the way cooked.  The food processor would have been a smart thing to do.

These were delicious - very light and creamy inside. I pureed the cottage cheese and added a tablespoon of vanilla sugar to the batter. Definitely a keeper.

I make pancakes with Cottage Cheese whenever I make them.  I do add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg or a bit of citrus to the recipe.  If you add the cottage cheese, you don't "crash" so hard later in the morning.

These were very good, though I would definitely double the recipe. I used wheat flour instead of white and it was still quite good. Like some other reviewers, I added cinnamon and smoothed the cottage cheese beforehand. Thanks for sharing.

My family loves these pancakes.  I use 1/2 cup of flour, and instead of oil, 4 Tbsp. of melted butter.  I also use 4 eggs, not 3.  I drop by large mixing spoonfuls onto the hot griddle, the kids like the smaller size.  I have to double or triple this recipe - the leftovers taste just as good reheated the next day!

This recipe is quite good.  The cheese taste doesn't really come through, it instead adds more of a general moistness. Be sure to at least make 50% more of the recipe at a time -- this will still result in only 8 pancakes!  Also, we double the amount of flour.  This could easily become our new go-to pancake recipe.

These pancake were delicious! I was very sceptical when I saw this recipe, but they taste so sweet and crunchy - unbelievable!
