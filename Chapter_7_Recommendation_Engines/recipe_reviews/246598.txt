What's not to like?! I didn't have any pearl sugar on hand, so, in addition to the gold sugar, I used a variety of colorful sprinkles for the kids...they loved them! These can be customized for any holiday or occasion, and they taste good too! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used milk chocolate pieces and then sprinkled the dipped pretzels with crushed candy cane. Delicious and different Christmas treat or gift.
