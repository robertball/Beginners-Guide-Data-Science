I used what I had on hand which was Hersheyâ€™s Lite chocolate syrup and Coffee Mate low-carb (less sugar) powdered vanilla creamer and it was still good.  Thanks for a great cup of coffee!

So yummy!  I made this with the Hazelnut creamer and only used an 1/8 of a cup and that was sweet enough for me.

I made this for my husband because he's a big coffee drinker.  He liked it and wants me to make it again.
