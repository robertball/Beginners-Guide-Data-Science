I make a similar version of this, but its more of a main dish.  I brown hamburger and toss it with the ranch style beans, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, green peppers, ranch, shredded cheese and Doritos.

This salad was great soon after preparation but after a few hours in the fridge, the lettuce was soggy and the dressing became watery. Don't wait too long to eat it and you'll love it! Kraft makes the best bottled ranch dressing I've tried, but I will use homemade next time. Also, don't use ranch-style black beans. The black color is not very appetizing when it hits the veggies!

I've had this in my recipe box for ages, but haven't made as I never seen Ranch-style beans. I found them in Meijer last week. This salad is absolutely outstanding! I omitted the green bell pepper as I don't like it raw, and pretty much just eyeballed the other ingredients. We loved it. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks, Leslie!

Much better than I thought it would be.  After I made it, I thought this is just another salad, but the different vegetables went together really well.  I made a few substitutions: used finely chopped sweet onion, spring mix lettuce, and chili beans, no radishes.  Made a great meal salad.

This is an interesting & delicious salad option! Our HyVee had the beans so the recipe was extremely easy to pull together. I made this 2 different times & preferred the salad with Spicy Doritos--added a nice touch. This salad will be my secret weapon for potlucks from now on--especially since I hate it when there are 4 of the same kinds of dishes. Try this salad, it's worth the effort!

With all the vegetables and chopping required, this salad was just too much work. The ratio of vegetables to lettuce was off (too many veggies, not enough lettuce) - didn't seem like a "salad." Not a bad taste, but not memorable and not easy.

Healthy with an interesting spin!  Served this with a Southern Living lentil burrito recipe and Mexican Rice III from this website.  Thanks for the recipe.

Too much work! Decent salad though. I used normal tortilla chips.

This was surprisingly goooood! I didn't have cucumbers, green onion or radishes but it still turned out great. I wish I wouldn't have poured the whole bottle of ranch on the salad because I don't like so much dressing on my salads. I used Doritos nacho-flavored chips.

Different & great tasting salad! It took a few stores to find the Ranch Beans but found them at WINCO in the bean section. Made without radishes, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

My family loves this salad, even my daughther who will not eat dressing on salad! I do not put the chips and dressing on until time to serve. I use romaine lettuce, other than that I pretty much follow as written. It does make a very large salad!
