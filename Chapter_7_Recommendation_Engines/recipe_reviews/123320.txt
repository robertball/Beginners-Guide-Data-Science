I made these for an open house I had. The only reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I thought they were on the salty side. I don't usually use a lot of salt so it may be perfect for others or with a beer. I forgot to take them out of the slow cooker before the party so they did sit in the juice for the night. that may be part of the salty issue. The color was good and they looked delicious. I would add a little more sugar next time.

We loved these!! Like other reviewers, we at first thought they were too salty, but that was my fault -not the recipe. I didn't marinate overnight and just cooked in all of the sauce for 8 hours on low. If you follow the recipe as written, they turn out great!

I have made these wings several times substituting different ingredients. In my opinion they are best with chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  Over all it’s a good recipe.

I made it the first time just for my family, and my son even loved them. I had them afterwards under the broiler to crisp the skin up a little bit. Then I made it for a Potluck with more wings, and I didn't put them under the broiler. My son did not care for them at all that way. The skin was too soft, but they were gone really quick. I like it, that they fall off the bones so easily. Will put them under the broiler from now on.

A little salty for us but otherwise we liked them. I am going to use low-sodium soy next time.

I love chicken wings, but I will not be making this recipe again.  I marinated the wings overnight and put them in the crock pot for about 3 hours on low the next day.  The chicken just didn't have any flavor!  I made a second batch and added some honey and red pepper flakes but it didn't make a difference.  The chicken itself was cooked perfectly- very moist- but it just didn't taste like anything but, well, chicken. I'll keep looking for a good slow cooker recipe.

I have been doing this marinade for a while now.  We always just bake ours in the oven and then hubby grills them to crisp them up.  I've never marinated them b/c we put our favorite hot sauces on them afterwards.  WE LIKE IT HOT!!  Anyway, after seeing this, I was curious so did it.  They were really tender and juicy.  We still put our various favorite hot sauces on them (my fav is Mango Habanero!) at the end and I do not bake them in the sauce, which I think probably is why they are so salty to people.  I also have learned the longer you marinate them, the saltier they taste.  Also, use low sodium soy sauce and I use about 1/2 of what it calls for w/a wee bit of Liquid Smoke.  Hope this helps ~ thanks for the recipe!!  YUMMY!!!

I used this recipe with chicken legs for a teen party.  Doubled the recipe, used 36 legs, and cooked it in my (very full) crockpot.  It was fabulous.  The kids swarmed over them & they were gone in no time.

These were a hit.  I only marinated for a few hours in the fridge before putting them on the barbeque.  A keeper.

Good recipe. I agree with another comment that it was too salty, even after I used Tamari (like soy sauce but much less sodium) and even cut down on that. I used some broth as well as the wine, so I suggest using low-sodium broth or just using the wine instead. A little lime would be a nice addition if you like lime. The wine did a great job of making the wings very tender!

I never cook for potlucks (I always just bring the napkins or something). But this recipe looked pretty easy, so I thought I’d give it shot. I bought a bag of pre-cut “party wings” so I didn’t have to cut them up, and I marinated overnight in the bag. The only ingredient I substituted was instead of white wine or chicken broth (didn’t have those) I used Mirin, which is kind of similar to sake. In the end, I also broiled for 2-3 minutes based on some of the reviews. The wings were great. Everybody was asking how I made them & wanted me to bring them to the next party.

Way too salty! It might have been the broth since I didn't have any wine or maybe if they hadn't been marinated all night. Brown sugar would have been a nice contrast to the soy. Next time I make wings, I'll probably just use our homemade stir fry sauce as the marinade.

These taste like Filipino Adobo, very tasty! Once the wings were done cooking in the slow-cooker, I put them under the broiler for aprox. 5 minutes, turning them once to crisp up.

very good wings, but also think they were better the next day. I put them in the oven to heat the leftovers and they were still juicy, but less salty. If you want the not so typical wings, these are a must try.

I found this recipe to be a bit too salty. They tasted much better the second day once they had sat out of the sauce all night  in the fridge

This was easy, and the wings were flavorful and tender. I took them out of the crockpot and put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up a bit. I only gave this 4 stars because I like more sauce on my wings. My husband loved them though.

Made these for a birthday part with the wine and half soy half worchestire (ran out of soy), and came out great!!  They were a hit and super easy...not at all salty.  I have a feeling if you use premade broth high in sodium that might be the culprit. Thanks!

I made two batches of these; one for the crock put for a pot luck at work and one that same evening in the oven for my family.  They were both great!!  I was surprised at how moist the batch that I cooked in the oven were; I guess it was because they had marinated for so long.  I prefer them crispier, but the convenience of the crock pot can't be beat!

I liked the flavor and the way they fell off the bone. I had mine in the oven a little longer as I was waiting for company so it made them crispier by default but I think I would put them under the broiler otherwise as we prefer them crispier.
