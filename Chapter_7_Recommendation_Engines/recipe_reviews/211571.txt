I believe we need to add Double Acting Baking Powder to this recipe....2T Baking powder. Usually when making basic Fry Bread recipe it only requires the baking powder. When using Baking Soda you wouid need to almost immediately cook the item or it will lose the gases needed to make the bread puffy. Yes you can use both the Baking Soda and Baking Powder for better leavening action. Also you can add to recipe some Allspice and Ginger for pumpkin spice flavor.

I subed sweet potato for the pumpkin. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 2 tbs. of baking powder instead of baking soda. It was really good. Thank you for sharing!!

We'll call this user error - I'm not sure what happened - my only guess is that my pumpkin puree may have been a little thin???? There was no way this was going to turn into a dough even when I added extra flour. Mine was definitely more of a batter. I still dropped it in the lard. Even with it not having the right consistency these were tasty. I sprinkled them with sugar & cinnamon and honey.

Two things: The sub of baking powder for baking soda is definitely needed to get the proper rise, especially if you are going to leave the batter for later (which I always do when making fry bread so that the gluten has more time to form its bonds).

And second: Lisa...fry bread is not a traditional native food, it wasn't created until after our people were placed on reservations and given flour in their food rations.

Please don't COLUMBUS a traditional Native American food! Pumpkin bread was not discovered by you. It is a traditional dish of my people: the Seminole and Miccosukee Indians. You did not put "a modern twist on" a traditional recipe. Pumpkin fry bread IS a traditional tribal food. Please acknowledge the true origin of this food. Thank you
