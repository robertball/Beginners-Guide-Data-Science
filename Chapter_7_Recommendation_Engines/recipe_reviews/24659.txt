made this after I ran out of Tastefully Simple's garlic garlic recipe for dip. In my opinion, it was just as good! I will never buy again...

I have been making this recipe for about 3 years since I first found it on here, and it has never failed to be a huge success.  On our ladies weekends at the beach, the standard request is that I double or triple the recipe in order for enough to go around.  We like it best served with hot, fresh french bread or baquettes.

Once I went to make it, thinking I had the recipe memorized--but indeed I didn't and accidently increased the garlic and peppers to 1 TB each, and everyone seemed to like it better, so I stuck with it.  I also substitute light mayo and sour cream--no one notices!  This is a staple in our house, and among our friends.  If you're looking for something quick and simple, give this is a try.  Despite some of the negative reviews on here, this recipe has been nothing but a success for me!

This is the best recipe for dip I've ever tried!  It was simple & quick to make and had the perfect flavor.  I prepared it for a baby shower and served it with fresh baguettes and it was GONE!  I've had several recipe request as well!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really great but definitely needed some time to sit before serving.  I tasted it right after mixing and it tasted like just plain sourcream.  30 minutes later, it was really good.  I had added more garlic powder (before it set) and it was great.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I had to with this. I am a huge fan a Simply Tasteful garlic garlic dip and I hate that it isn't easily available to me and quite expensive. I made this recipe and I actually doubled the garlic, parsley and 1 and half the red pepper and I LOVE it! It is so similar to garlic garlic dip that I will never buy it again. I read on here someone saying that this has no taste? This dip has amazing flavor and I highly recommend it. (the doubling of seasonings was great for me, probably not for everyone)

This was pretty good. I did make some additions that I think made it great. I added more garlic powder (about another 1/2 TBS as I really like garlic), 1/2 TBS onion powder, a pinch of dried tarragon leaves, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, a dash of seasoned salt and a dash of ground white pepper. Very yummy!

Awesome dip! The cayenne pepper gives it an unexpected kick.  I also added 1/4 tsp garlic salt and one fresh crushed garlic clove.  :)

This is pretty bland. I tripled the garlic, doubled the parsley and added 1 tsp. salt and then it was worth eating.

The basics were what I was looking for, but if you like garlic, it needs a TON more.

I can't figure out all the comments about it tasting strong in garlic.  I could hardly taste it.  What I tasted was red pepper, which I thought was a bit hot and perhaps covering up the garlic flavor.  So I made another sample, cutting the red pepper in half.  It tasted like sour cream and I still couldn't taste much garlic.  It shouldn't be called "garlic" dip if it takes a bunch of red pepper to make it taste like something.  The vegies we had at Labor Day BBQ just wiped out any flavor this had (and 3 of us agreed).  And yes, I refrigerated it overnight.  Later I dumped more garlic powder in the leftovers and was just starting to taste it. I used the leftovers w/chips and that allowed me to taste the garlic a bit better.  Not worth trying to fix this up.

In my area you cannot buy garlic dip in the grocery store anymore.  I craved the garlic dip we had as kids and this recipe is EXACTLY it.  Nothing is better with chips.  It's wonderful!

It's a great 5 ingredient dip when you don't have a lot at home to work with. It's true it's spicy, but I added chopped oregano and cilantro flakes. There's lots of room for experimentation here.

I liked it, though I modified it.  I used about 4-5 cloves of crushed or minced fresh garlic, which had enough of a bite to eliminate the need for the red pepper.  Instead of parsley, I added some basil, garlic powder (different taste than fresh garlic), and white pepper.  If you have lemon pepper, toss in some of that, too.  Delicious and easy!  Best with pretzels; also good with tortilla chips and fresh veggies.

I doubled the garlic (I can never get enough!) and added a dash of lemon juice.  This is a good base to tweak to personal taste. Thanks for sharing!

A little strong on the garlic, guess I was looking for something a little milder.  Would be good with bread/bagel bits and veggies more than the crackers/chips we had I think.

This had a bit more of a kick to it than some people at my party preferred - but I didnt mind it.  It was different enough from your average dip that I liked it, but it wouldnt be for someone who doesnt like a spicy type dip.

This is terrific if you're a garlic lover, like myself! It does taste best after sitting in the refrigerator for a few hours atleast.

Just made this for a Super Bowl party to serve with potato chips--and there wasn't one bit left!  Contrary to other opinions, I didn't think the garlic flavor was overwhelming.  I think the red pepper intensifies the garlic flavor.   Next time, I might back off just a shade on the crushed red pepper.  It doesn't make much--at a minimum, you'll need to double--probably triple for a "party sized" poortion.  Make sure you refrigerate several hours or overnight, the flavors need to develop!

I made this dip but left out the red pepper.  It was great, espescially if you let it refridgerate for about 24 hours.  I made the beer bread recipe found here also, cut that up into bite size chuncks and dipped it in the dip!  Everyone at my party loved and asked for the recipe.  It is very strong-not ment for someone who dosn't like A LOT of garlic!
