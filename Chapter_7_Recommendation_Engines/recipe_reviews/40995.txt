Only ok... nothing I'm anxious to try again. It lacked something in the flavor. I felt it was kinda dull actually.

I wasnt sure to add the juice from the tomatoes, so the filling was very dry.

Two of us made this recipe and ate it.  E would give it a 5, A would give it a 3, so we averaged it.  A's complaints: awkward to eat, didn't like the tomatoes in it (mushrooms would have been better).  E says: It was great!  Perfect!
Make sure to cook the artichokes long enough and to clip the sharp edges of the leaves thoroughly.

This was a really good recipe, my boyfriend loved it but it took a long time to make (longer than the dinner) Next time I will buy the alrady sliced and peeled tomatoes.

This really is a good basic recipe but it definitely needs some tweaking. I liked the addition of the tomato, but I used the flavored diced canned stuff to save on desperately needed time last night. Yup, this would be very dry if prepared as stated. We love garlic, so I added quite a bit to the bread crumbs. Again, to hurry things up, I used powdered, which worked well. I also used much more parm then called for and added olive oil to the mixture until it was fairly moist. I removed the choke and stuffed them before cooking, which I did in a pot on top of the stove. Once done, I put the artichokes in a dish, drizzled with a little more olive oil and 
placed them under the broiler to crisp up. I made four stuffed and four just steamed. With a little side of mini penne pasta, this was our meal. The kids couldn't get these babies in their mouths fast enough!

My husband loved these. I thought they were okay. I agree with the other rater who said they'd be better with mushrooms. I did add the juice from the tomatoes to add moisture, so it wasn't dry.
