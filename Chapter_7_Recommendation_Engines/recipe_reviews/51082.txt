Wow!!  This was wonderful.  While we love the sweet taste of eggplant, I almost forgot it was eggplant.  I did cut mine thin 1/4 ".  I swore I was eating a miniature bite-size pizza--NOT one of those frozen kinds you get in the store.  Would make a great appetizer, no utensils required.  Not even children can resist this one.  VERY tasty!!!

This recipe is fast and super easy.  My four year old loved it (he thought they were mini pizzas).  I did make a couple of modifications:  I sliced the eggplant 1/4 inch thick as instructed.  However, before topping them with the breadcrumbs I stacked them by twos.  This gave them a meatier texture.  Also, to save calories, I used only 1 teaspoon of olive oil and 1/2 cup of mozzerella.  We actually preferred this lighter version.  Great recipe!
