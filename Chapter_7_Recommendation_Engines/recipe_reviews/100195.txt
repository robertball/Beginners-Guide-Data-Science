Love this reciept. To prevent the soggy bottom I put the fish on a cooling wire rack and then set it in the baking dish,I also squeezed a little fresh lemon on it before it went in to the oven. it came out nice and crisp on both sides. My family loved it.

VERY GOOD!!! There's a popular restaurant back home in Boston whose website lists this same recipe for their Baked Haddock. It is delicious! It'll work just fine with a variety of fish; you could use tilapia, orange roughy or cod as well as haddock. Don't be taken aback by the high oven temperature as this it what gives the fish a nice, crispy crunch. I cook mine for 12 or 13 minutes and serve it with lemon wedges. This one is fool proof; try it, you'll love it!!!

This was really easy to prepare and it was really tasty!  Instead of using the milk to coat the fish, I thought it would be easier to use egg.

After reading several reviews, I think the recipe is too complicated.  For two people use 1 lb of haddock, 5 crushed Ritz crackers, a little water in bottom of baking dish.  Top (don't coat all over) the fish with crackers, a modest sliver of  butter on top and bake 425 for 20 minutes.  Simple and no soggy bottom of crumbs.  No need to grease dish ... just the water or white wine if you prefer.
     I live close to the ocean and we cook our good seafood simple.!

I used cod instead of haddock. This was excellent. I put salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika on my fillets before I put them in the milk. I also sprayed the fillets with Pam cooking spray so that they would crisp nicely. I also used margarine instead of butter.  Would def make this again. My husband and daughter both loved it.

Good basic recipe, I didn't have Thyme so I used dill which was very good. My husband said he could eat this three to four times a week.  I cooked for 15 minutes on 500 as instructed and the fish was perfect.  The only thing I would do different is I would spray the bottom of the pan with some pam or something prior to cooking as my fish stuck a little. Otherwise great recipe that can changed everytime it is used.

My husband made this, and it was really good! The only problem was that the bottom of the fish/breading got soggy in the oven. Otherwise, perfect!

I live in Maine where Haddock is almost a staple, this wonderful, inexpensive and versatile fish can be fixed in literally hundreds of ways.  Besides this recipe there is always the one that eliminates the milk altogether, subsituting about 2TBS of mayonaisse, rubbing it on with your fingers and following the rest of the recipe.  I do however spray a small rack with a nonstick spray, place the rack in my pan and bake in a hot oven for 15 minutes.  Sometimes I'll add a teaspoon of mustard to my mayo, sometimes Emeril or Old Bay to my crumbs, I do eliminate the melted butter and spray it with a butter flavored spray, it goes on more evenly and makes the fish crispier and tastes just as good. Sometimes the "new" is better! it's fun to experiment!

I didn't have any bread crumbs, or even corn flakes, so I used crushed flakes from Raisin Bran. Picking out the raisins was an adventure, but definately worth it. I followed the tip to brush the butter on, adding some lime juice to make it interesting. It was absolutely delicious, better than I expected from a thrown together dish. The bran flakes gave it more texture & a good flavor. I just wish I'd made more!

wow!! this tasted amazing and perfect for a quick and easy dinner!! i used haddock fillet and man, was it delicious!!
I did add a few things...i reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and added 1 egg, salt and pepper to the milk mixture. I saw reviews on people just using eggs or just milk so i thought why not both. 
For the dry mix, i used seasoned breadcrumbs and added garlic powder, onion powder, and dill weed, parm cheese,  and drizzled butter.. 
the fish baked to perfection at 500 for 15 mins. at the end i drizzled lemon juice over it. I also baked it on a cookie sheet and put the fish on parchment paper - no stickiness, fish just slid right off. 
DELICIOUS!! thanks for the recipe.

A great vety simple baked haddock recipe.  I did add some Emeril fish rub to the bread crumbs just to give it a little kick.  The whole family enjoyed....there was none left.  I we also had Down Home Macaroni and Cheese and peas. Thanks linda for a new way to cook my favorite fish.

FINALLY! I fish recipe that really tastes great! I made this tonight, following the recipe exactly except that I did not have thyme and I used panko bread crumbs, and it turned out great! The key to getting it crispy is this: if you are using frozen haddock, as I was, make sure the fish has plenty of time to thaw and take time to dry it out well with paper towels. If the fish isn't completely thawed or is still retaining any water, your fish will not get crispy, especially not on the bottom. I coated the dish with olive oil spray and had no problem removing the fish. I have made fish many times before but it has never turned out this good and flaky and crispy. I am sure the high temp helped with that a lot. Served with a side of steamed broccoli, made for a very light, and delicious meal.

This turned out great. I preheated  one of my  glass 9x13 pans with a little oil smeared around. And the other was room temp. when I put my breaded fish in 'ocean perch' [it's what I had]. baked for about 15 min.The preheated pan was a little cruncher on the bottom then the not preheated one. I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half 'Panko' bread crumbs. Will make again.

I made this for my husband and he said it was the best tasting fish I've cooked since we've been married. I omitted the butter completely, but substituted by giving each breaded fillet a few sprays of "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" (maybe 6 or 7) before baking them. I also baked them on a wire rack (brushed with olive oil) and didn't have any difficulty with a soggy bottom or the fish sticking. I will definitely make this for dinner again!

I had two cod fillets, which I baked at about 425. I used this recipe as a baseline, but lightened up on basically every ingredient. I didn't measure anything because I had two fillets and I knew I wanted to be conservative anyway. I wanted just enough breading to flavor the fish, so I swept each fillet with milk and dipped the top side only of the fish in the Parmesan / bread crumb mixture. I sprinkled with a little garlic powder and omitted the butter completely for a lighter dish. I placed in a glass baking dish greased with olive oil (be sure to grease your dish or the fish may stick) and baked about 20 minutes. I put a heavy squeeze of lemon juice over each fillet when I pulled them out and served immediately. Very good and not too heavy the way I did mine. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this almost every Sunday now!  The only thing I add is... squeese a whole lemon into the butter mixture and dribble over the fish before it goes into the oven.

Great recipe!  My husband and my 3 year old loved it.  I baked mine on a wire cooling rack and sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray instead of the butter.  I will be making this a regular.

This was delicious - even my non-fish-eating husband liked it.  I used stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and egg instead of milk.

Very Good. Had me worried at first,I never made Haddock b4 and my husband is NOT a fish eater. But he will eat it if it does not taste fishy. When I first unwrapped my fillets. Wow wee, they had quite the fishy smell.I took the advise of another reviewer and used Emirls fish rub on the fillets first. and I drizzled orange juice over them and in the pan instead of butter. WOW, surpisingly, these turned out wonderful with NO fishy taste at all !! My hubby and kids ate there WHOLE entire fillets!!!

This was a good baked haddock..not the best one I've ever made, but worth four stars.  I did a couple of things differently.  I actually brushed on the melted butter vs. drizzling it ~ you get a more even, better coating of butter (thus browning better) when it's brushed on.  The other thing I changed was using Panko bread crumbs.  That's just because Panko are the only type we use >=.=

My three children (5, 3, and 1) love this! Family favorite. You can use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain and omit the thyme if you wish.

A week ago, I purchased Haddock and came close to throwing it out today.  Instead, my husband and I decided to cook it up.   I found this recipe and within 20 minutes my husband and I were gobbbling up this tremendous dish.  His quote... "this was probably the best fish I have ever ate."  I did not change a thing! Enjoy!

Wonderful! I used adobo seasoning (granulated salt, pepper, garlic and oregano) in place of the salt and baked the fish on a broiler pan to keep it crispy ,though it did stick a little bit because I didn't grease it.  The result was crisp fish with lots of flavor.  I'll definitely make this again.

The only change I made was that I added garlic powder.  Fantastic!!!  Will be making again soon!  Thanks Linda :)

I used tilapia for this recipe and it turned out very tasty and easy to make. Even my wife who isn't much of a fish fan liked it! The 500 degree oven temp seemed a little hot - it was burning after only a minute or two after putting in, so I lowered it to 400 and just cooked it a couple minutes longer. Also, to cut sodium content, if the bread crumbs you use are already seasoned, you can skip the extra salt that the recipe calls for.

Prepared this exactly as written by Linda...and LOVED it!  Absolutely the best baked haddock I've ever had.  Even better than my favorite local restaurant.  I admit that when I took it out of the oven after 15 minutes I smelled a little burn and worried that the high temp burned the fish.  It did not.  It was just the smell of some of the crumbs that had fallen off the fish.  FYI, I didn't cook in a glass baking dish, I put the prepared fish on a wire cooling rack on a cookie sheet...so, the bottom didn't get soggy. This goes into the regular rotation!

Great recipe! Smell reminded me of Legal's. Had to double the bread crumb mixture to cover all 4 fillets. Took suggestions from other reviewers to bake on metal rack in oven to prevent one side being soggy. Served with steamed veggies with baked sweet potato and brown rice. Great recipe! Will make again!

We made this recipe with cod and it was very good, except for the extremely excessive amount of salt....I can't believe no one else has mentioned this.  Really?....2 tsps of salt for 3/4 cup of bread crumbs?!  Is that a typo?  I used less but was still way too salty.  Other than that it was very good.  Another reviewer mentioned heating up the pan first and that crisped up the bottom of the fish nicely.  Incidently, we made this with gluten free bread crumbs.  We'll definitely make this again when we get that craving for something breaded.

This was so amazing. It turned out perfectly and was so delicious. The only things I tweaked were; I added a little salt and pepper to the top before I baked it, I didn't have Ground thyme so I used thyme leaves instead and I used Parmesan and Romano cheeses. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to make white fish.

I've done it changing a few things and straight up - great both ways.  As is - its just a simple tasty recipe that allows the flavor of the fish to shine thru.  I've subbed 1tsp garlic salt & 1tsp onion for the salt... still great!

I used non-fat milk and nixed the butter to save fat and calories. SO yummy! I used a vented roasting pan to keep the bottom from getting too mushy. This is a keeper!!

Made this for dinner the other night and it was very tasty.  The only changes I made were to use Italian Panko Bread Crumbs so I eliminated the thyme, did not use any salt and added garlic powder.  The haddock was so moist and crispy on the outside.  Will be making this again.

Delicious.  Instead of melted butter, I used the "spray" butter.  I also used flavoured bread crumbs and that might be the reason that I found this recipe to be salty (sodium content in the bread crumbs was 14%).  I will definately cut back the salt next time.  Lastly, if you choose to put the fish on a wire rack in the oven (to avoid the soggy bottom that others speak of), then don't forget to grease the rack so that it doesn't stick.  With these adjustments, definately would be five star recipe.  I'll be making this again.

I used an egg instead of milk and put hot pepper sauce in it. I used seasoned breadcrumbs with fresh grated parm and fresh parsley. Instead of melting butter I put small dabs of butter on top of fish. Squeezed lemon on the top. I put them on a rack to prevent any soggy bottom. served with greens and boiled provisions. it was very very tasty!

Quick Edit - I brought leftovers to work the next day and heated it up in the microwave... everyone complained about it stinking up the WHOLE office and hall... I laughed but they didnt think it was funny, so it might not be the best thing to take to work the next day, I have reheated other fish dishes and no one seemed to complain :) !

Very Good!  I used restraint when it came to salt, using a little over 1/4 tsp.  I think that 2 tsp. would have been far too much for my family.  I used a wire rack for baking the fish so that the bottom wouldn't get soggy and, served with my own homemade tartar sauce, this method of cooking allowed the taste of the fresh haddock to shine.

Ok, its been a while since I posted a comment here, even though I keep using the recipes over and over again. But this time I HAVE TO. This was absolutely great! Few modifications though: added some paprika to milk and salt, let haddock sit in it for about an hour. Added italian seasoning to the breadcrums mix. Put fish on the wire rack in the oven (I honestly think it is a must - no soggy bottom at all!) As a result - completely satisfied and happy hubby (that makes faces every time I propose fish for dinner!)He said "Parmesan makes it". Light crisp on the outside, flavorfull, flaky on the inside! I would cut down on crumbs and parmesan amount next time though - got a lot left over. Thank you very much for the recipe! Will make again for us, will make for guests!

This was very good, but I think the future I might some extra spices to the breading to give it a little more kick. My fiances is one of those I don't eat fish people, but I had her try it and not only did she not die from eat she really enjoyed it.

In Nova Scotia, haddock is for dinner a lot. It's nice to find an alternate way of cooking haddock to change things a bit. Normally, I simply bake it as is and make a lemon dill sauce to pour over it. My husband does a great job of pan frying haddock. It's great in chowders and many other dishes that require white fish.  It's very versatile. Although I won't be giving up my lemon dill sauce method, this recipe provides an alternative. I substituted dill for the thyme and left out the Parmesan cheese. This is just because of my personal taste.  I like the fact this was a relatively low fat way of cooking and it did turn out crispy.  This is a great basic recipe and a change from my usual way of cooking haddock. . And the best part is that this was a healthy recipe.

I usually eat my fish fried with loads of tartar sauce- or should I say I have a little fried fish with my tartar sauce- lol.  Well we tried this tonight- and it was great! I subbed 1/2 of the bread crumbs with Panko breadcrumbs.  I can't believe how crispy it came out and how tender the fish.  The thyme was a nice touch. It was such an easy stress free recipe.  We will be doing this again and I'm going to try it with the talapia. PS love the way the recipes can be modified for the number of servings.

Restaurant quality haddock! DELICIOUS!

Took advice of past reviewers- sprinkled fillets with garlic powder before dipping in milk, and put them on wire rack in baking pan so the bottom didn't get soggy.

I will be making this a lot!

Great as is, though, having read some reviews before I made it, I did opt to not cook it flat in the dish since I didn't want the bottom to be soggy.  Since I don't have the right kind of rack to lift the fish up, I improvised with foil: several bunches under a large flat piece & pierced holes in the flat piece.  Worked fine & my husband, who generally only likes fried fish, loved it.

Very easy and very yummy.  My fillets did not get soggy as I put extra bread crumbs under them.  Thanks for an easy quick meal.

Made this last night and my family loved it.  I didn't bother with the wire rack and it was fine - definitely important to cook it on the top shelf.  I will add a little salt to the crumbs next time and I substituted the butter with olive oil for a healthier fat.  Simple and delicious!

This was really good.  Adding the parm chz & thyme really added that extra flavor.  Never cooked at 500 degrees before - fish was cooked perfectly and I sprayed the baking dish with cooking spray first.  The only problem there was not any left for seconds (cooked 1 lb Haddock).

Wonderful fish! Haddock is now one of my favorite fish to cook (also see spicy haddock recipe from allrecipes). It's light, buttery, and bakes really well. I coated the fish with an egg/milk mixture before dipping it into the crumbs. I also seasoned it with some cayenne pepper to give it a little friendly flavorful kick and replace 1 t of salt with some garlic salt instead. The flavors really complimented the fish. Bake on a raised roasting pan so it doesn't get soggy. Then reheat leftovers in a toaster oven to keep crispy. Oh so good!

Delicious, easy, fairly quick......great for Lent! My only suggestion.....next time I would spray the fillets with olive oil to both crisp/brown since I used Panko. You can skip the butter that way as well.

Easy and absolutely delicious!  We used panko bread crumbs (plain) and they made it crispy.  The coating is light and doesn't take away from the flavor of the fish.  We enjoyed every bite!

This is my preferred way to bake Haddock now.  Only change is that I use buttermilk instead of regular milk.

I made this with Whiting fish and it was very good. Update 7/7/2010:  I made this tonight with Haddock and my daughter, who isn't a fish lover, ate three pieces!  Yes, if set into the bottom of a dish without a rack it gets soggy.  I think I'll try the rack next time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it came out great.  The breading on the bottom of the fish did stick a little bit to the baking dish, so next time I might take the suggestion of cooking on a rack.  All in all it came out nice and crispy and I would definitely make it again.

I used frozen talapia for this. Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed ritz crakers, omitted the salt and cooked on a rack.  They turned out nice and crispy and my kids thought they were "fish sticks."  Half the milk would have been plenty for the dredging.

With a little added seasonings this was excellent - I added some garlic powder and pepper.  To attempt a crisper coating I used half bread crumbs and half finely crushed cereal (I used Fiber One, which gave it a little sweetness).  I skipped the melted butter and just added a few squirts of spray butter.  I think some Essence would have made this perfect for me, but I still enjoyed it!

Other than the fact that I added more seasonings to the bread crumbs, I was very pleased with this dish. Apparently so was everyone else because when I returned for a second helping, it was gone! Thanks Linda!

A friend of mine tried this recipe out. He followed the directions but when he put the glass dish in the oven at 500 degrees according to the recipe the dish exploded in the oven. We have since asked several of our friends (some of which were chefs and they said they have never heard of cooking anything at 500 degrees)  This must be a misprint. He is going to try it again tonight but at a lower temperature.  It sounds delicious.

I was pleasantly surprised.  This was even tastier than I expected.  I guess it must have been the thyme that did something magical.  I cooked it much longer (not sure, 20-30min?) at 350 degrees because I had something else in the oven, which worked out fine.  This was easy and I will make it regularly.

So, so delicious and easy.  I had yellowtail flounder, and this recipe was terrific.  I followed everything, except I used fresh thyme and fresh breadcrumbs, and added a pinch of red pepper to the dry coating.  Oh - and I followed other users who recommended a wire rack.  The fish was cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and the coating was crispy all of the way around.  My new, favorite way to cook white-ish fish!

I absolutely loved this recipe. This is my go to dinner when I don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen. I used everything but thyme. The only modifications I made were: I soaked the fish in milk/salt for about 1 hour prior to coating it. I used Italian bread crumbs, and also (and this is my own personal favorite) I sliced one lemon and covered the bottom of the glass baking dish with it and layed the fillets right on top of the lemon - it was absolutely delicious!!!

This fish was very good. I followed the directions but was a little skeptical about the 500 degree oven. But it cooked the fish perfectly. I didn't have any thyme so I sprinkled the fish with a little lemon pepper seasoning. I also cut back on the melted butter since my husband is watching his calories. All in all it was a great dish.

This was really good and very easy! I used what I had in the house, so instead of Parmesan I used Romano cheese and Panko bread crumbs. Other than that followed the recipe exactly as written...Yum, will make it again.

My family liked this very much. My husband doesn't really care for haddock and he said it was delicious.
I baked it 12 minutes then put it under the broiler for 2-3 min. to brown it up.

Great recipe. I make this at least once a week. For a healthier option I just spray the fillets with a little cooking spray (canola oil) rather than pour butter over them.

I made this last night and it was very good. I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular and omitted the Parmesan cheese. I cooked it on an elevated rack to avoid the bottom being soggy. My fillets were large, so I had to cook it longer. My wife who is VERY picky loved it!

Excellent.  I don't use butter so I followed the recipe but substituted the butter by spraying the top of the fillets with olive oil.

I would give it more stars if I could. Simple easy, great family meal. I added garlic to the breadcrumbs, I also cooked it at 350 for 15 mins and it was perfect. I don't get the 500 degrees, maybe for about 6 mins but not 15.

I loved this recipe!  I am new to cooking so I wasn't sure how hard this would be, and it is incredibly easy to prepare!  The only changes I made in the recipe were I skipped the thyme because I didn't have any and I didn't add butter because I don't use butter very often.  It was fantastic!  Even my husband liked it and he doesn't like anything!  I will definitely be making it again.

Loved this recipe. Parmesean cheese gave it a nice twist. My kids love cheese , so this was a hit with them and they hate fish :) So easy to make. Made a nice greek salad and rice pilaf to with the haddock. Loved it!!!!

I used Parmigiano-Reggiano in the recipe.  I grated a bit more cheese over the top before popping in the oven.  It browned beautifully.  Delish!

On the way from work yesterday I bought haddock on sale.  I checked allrecipes and found this recipe and decided to try it.  All I can say is that ALL of it disappeared and we all loved it.  I did put it on a rack as some had suggested but other than that made no changes.  I live on Cape Cod and we get fish often, this will be a dish I will turn to again and again.  Thanks Linda!

I liked how easy this recipe was.  After trying this, I am not a fan of thyme at all.  This was good & simple.  After putting the fish in the oven, read the reviews about putting it on a rack.  Therefore as soon as I took it out of the oven, the fish went on a roasting rack.  This did prevent it from being soggy.  It still seemed like it was missing something.  I will make again & try different spices.

This was exceptional.  We used fresh, wild-caught haddock from Whole Foods as well as their freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Placing the fish on the top rack of the oven is essential, as it nicely crisps the breading.  However, because the oven is so hot and mine cooks food quickly, we used a meat thermometer and cooked only until the fish was at 165 degrees, which only took 8 minutes.

Delicious!  Cooked perfectly.  I served with lime juice to give it a little more flavor.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is not make up so much crumb mixture since most of it went to waste (you could probably 1/2 it and still have enough).

Very good and easy too!! I added paprika, salt and pepper to the fish itself and more thyme to the breadcrumbs. Added Pam to the bottom of my glass baking dish and sprayed some on top of the fish and it came out perfect.

Seriously, I can't believe how easy and oh so yummy this recipe was.  I didn't have milk so I used half and half instead and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  I make fish all the time but my husband said, "this was the best haddock I have ever had in my life.". I will definitely keep this recipe as a quick go to and it will be served for guests.

I made this recipe tonight using Halibut, and it was amazing.  I took the advice of putting it on a wire rack above a cookie sheet to keep it from getting soggy on the bottom, and it worked like a charm.  Great way to cook all kinds of white fish!

LOVED it.  Made my own bread crumbs using  crushed crackers and finely ground pistachios, and it was amazing.  The nice thing about this recipe is, you can change out the bread crumbs, and make it slightly different every time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe - simple and delicious!  I have made this with several different types of white fish but the haddock is by far our favorite.  Also, I did make one slight alteration - when melting the butter (over stove), I add freshly crushed garlic. yummm

This was great! In my husbands words "better than I expected it to be" especially for baked! We put our fish on a wire rack on a cookie sheet. I think next time though I will skip putting the salt in the milk, it was a bit salty. In the breadcrumb mixture I also added garlic powder, onion powder & a shake or 2 of basil. Then I added some lemon juice to the melted butter before drizzling it on! Delicious healthy dinner!!!!

My husband made this and has passed on the following review...  Use 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs instead of 3/4 cup and 1/2 tsp thyme instead of 1/4 tsp.  My two cents worth...use less butter.  A little butter goes a long way!

Great little recipe, easy and really quick.  The fillets I bought were a little thin, and I checked at 12 minutes and they were done.  I also cut way back on the salt, just used a sprinkling, especially since the parmesan is very salty.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This was very good.   I used flounder and I used only 1/2 the salt.  I forgot the butter on top, but it was still good.  I cooked on a wire rack and it was perfectly cooked.  Next time, I might add a little garlic powder.

Delicious.  Like many, I baked the fillets on a rack. Added garlic powder and lemon zest.  OK with less butter/margarine.  I will use this again.

I made this fish the other night for dinner and it was really good! I used panko instead of breadcrumbs, herbes de provence instead of thyme and I increased the bread/cheese mixture to accomodate my 1.5 lbs of haddock.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked this on a rack so it didn't have a soggy bottom - and the end result was delicious fish served with a lemon wedge.

I try to make recipes exactly as stated but in this case I did not use any butter due to dietary restrictions. I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt as that is our preference. It was delicious.

Whole family loved this.  Would use the rack next time to keep bottom of fish from being soggy.  Butter got a bit smoky.  Maybe a little oil added in next time.

I followed the recipe as is and is was only good.  Next time I will salt the fish directly instead of adding to the milk.  I will also squeeze some lemon juice onto the fish before baking.

I hadn't eaten fish in over 20 years until I decided to try again it last night.  And this recipe has turned it around for me. It was SOOOOOO GOOD.  I halved the recipe (just 2 of us).  I soaked the filets in the milk (prior to adding the salt) for a couple hours to help reduce the fishy factor.  Removed the filets from the milk, added the salt and proceeded with the recipe.  I didn't use a rack and it was fine.  No, the bottom wasn't crunchy, but it wasn't gloppy soggy either.  When I pulled it out of the oven the fish was so flaky I would think it would have completley fallen apart trying to get it off a rack.  It was light and the top was golden and crunchy and perfectly seasoned.  I cannot wait to have it again.  I'm still somewhat in shock....I eat fish now??  Never would have thought it possible.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Only complaint is that it got a bit soggy.  Though my wife's piece was crunchier and made me a bit jealous.  Overall an enjoyable experience.

This recipe was fantastic!  My wife and two children (5&3)loved it.  The kids said this was the best haddock they ever had and they eat fish regularly.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain squeezed some fresh lemon onto the fish after it was buttered.

Fantastic fish dish!!

One suggestion for those who aren't big fish lovers: add some more of the cracker/butter topping.

At 30 years old, my husband is just starting to enjoy fish.  He usually takes a very small amount of fish when I serve it with a meal.  However, he actually went back for seconds on this one, and when all was said and done, he probably ate about a half of an entire fillet himself!!

I cannot wait to make this for my father (a real seafood enthusiast from Massachusetts).!!!

So, I had never cooked fish before (weird I know).  However, I had my grandfather and a few family members over for dinner and fish is my grandfathers favorite, so I decided to make it happen.
This recipe was so easy to make it was almost foolproof.  I used shredded parmesan and added some salt and pepper to the bread crumb mixture.  I also squeezed on some fresh lemon after the milk but before dipping in the crumbs.
It was such a hit there were no leftovers, even my one year old devored it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very, very good.  I will absolutely make this again.  I love the parmesean flavor.  I used the shredded kind in the jar, as opposed to the dry kind from the shaker can, which I think has better flavor.

I made this recipe for my in-laws, and we all ended up loving it.  The recipe is a keeper.  My only recommendation is to get rid of the picture you have posted on line.  It doesn't come even close to representing how delicious it is and in fact I almost didn't even make it because of that!

Thanks Linda!

This recipe was super easy and really yum!  The tip about pressing the bread crumb/parmesan mixture into the haddock was right on- the fish stayed really well coated.  I also like to add a bit of Emeril's Essence to give it a little bite.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good, fish got a bit wet though from the butter - next time I'll put it on alum. foil with holes punched in so the butter slowly drains... maybe that'll help. Thanks though! Very nice and tasty.

One of the advantages of living on the east coast is being able to obtain fresh haddock year around. This is a good way to cook this delicate fish. I used fresh bread crumbs and fresh parmesan, halved the butter and used 1 tsp of fresh thyme for the ground. I cooked the fresh fish at 400 degrees for 12 minutes and then broiled it for 2 minutes. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fish - mine was thin. Thanks for the recipe, Linda.

I use this recipe to make bluefish which has very strong flavor.  My friends go fishing a lot and they used to throw the bluefish back but now they bring them to me for a great dinner.  Always a big hit.  Thanks!

Very nice taste. I always worry about baking coated fish because sometimes the coating turns out mushy.  This was quite good.  I did have to cook a little longer than 15 minutes but I had a lot of Haddock.

I thought that this was a excellent recipe! I have used it several times and tried it on other, less expensive white meat fish and it was still tasty. Although I will say that it is best on the Haddock.

This was one of the best baked fish recipies I have ever had.  My husband loved it.  I was worried about baking at 500 degrees, but it came out moist and flaky.  I followed the recipie, except I didn't have any milk, so I used a garlic vinairgrette salad dressing instead.  I think it may have added a good flavor.  Also, I added black pepper to the bread crumbs.  Will add this to our favorites.

This was fantastic! Followed recipe exactly except I didn't have thyme so I substituted dried parsley. I cooked on a cookie cooling rack over the pan to prevent a soggy bottom. Served with lemon wedges on the side.  Very nice flavor and will be using this one many more times!!

This is a great recipe. I've been looking for different fish recipes. I don't like fishy smell or taste so haddock is the one I like the most. Living in Portland Maine, at times haddock is less expensive than hamburg. I like to make fish chowder but this is quicker and tastes awsume. I made it exactly the way the recipe lists. Will definitely be on my top 10 recipe list.

This was one of the most delicious fish entrees I have ever made. Excellent. Though, I didn't use bread crumbs; instead, I used cracker crumbs. I didn't crush the crackers enough, but it honestly didn't make a difference. Outstanding.

For a first timer cooking fish, this was easy and still amazing. The fish had a crispy top but so moist inside. So happy to have tried this as my first fish recipe.

Really good recipe! Much lighter than the cracker crumb variation. I used cooking spray on bottom of ceramic dish and it wasn't soggy at all. Also added 1 egg in with milk. Will use this recipe again for sure.

I've made this dish several times for company and it always comes out perfect!! I went off of a couple of reviews on here and used a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet so it would be crispier.. I forgot to line my cookie sheet with foil though which did lead to the smoke detector going off. Oops! We all had a laugh and the food wasn't affected! I highly recommend this recipe!

I used tilapia instead of haddock, but didn't change much else.  I added more spices to the bread crumbs and only breaded one side of the fish.  I've always liked fish, but never really tried to make it.  It was a big help to read all the reviews.  Excellent and easy.

Made this recipe yesterday using between 13-18 oz. haddock.
I forget what it weighed. Served 3 adults. I followed someone's
directions to press the breadcrumb mixture into the fish and also
to spray the pan I cooked the fish in. It tasted really good. I plan to
make it again and again. IT'S NOT COMPLICATED AT ALL.
melt the butter. mix the breadcrumbs, cheese and thyme. Have milk and salt in a separate bowl. Dip in milk, then in breadcrumbs, place in pan sprayed with Pam, drizzle butter over all. Bake. EASY. TASTES GREAT!!

My wife does not like fish... Only fried "fish and chips" And most of the time it was to dry and greasy. I talked her into trying this recipe. I found it easy. Not only that, I thought it was GREAT! And believe it or not, my wife Loved it!!! Wow!!! Now she said "instead of fish and chips, she wants me to make this instead" It was very very good. Now I can save money by not buying fish & chips dinners (which saves me $30.00 a week)I only have to buy the fish ($8.00) But I'm still amazed that she really loved it!!!  Thank you so much, Ted

Great recipe - thanks for sharing.  We like a little heat so added some Old Bay seasoning.  Also used Panko since we were out of regular breadcrumbs - Panko worked well too.  Added a little white wine to the bottom of the pan because we like the flavor.  Was a big hit at Sunday dinner with the family.

This seems to be the standard... was excellent and relatively easy to {get started} while the rest of the dinner was cooking. As many cooks do I substituted a few things and added some slivered almonds...

I used cod for this recipe and it simply turned out wonderful!  I also added a little Tony's Creole seasoning and lemon to the fish before I baked it.  Mmm!  It made the family happy and it was easy!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Loved all the tips. Used flax seed as the flour and mayo for the milk and only put it on top. Parchment paper kept it from sticking. The whole family liked it and they are not big fish eaters.

1/3 cup of milk would have been better than wasting all that milk. and it's also a good idea to toss in some shrimps or add mayo :3

Super tasty, easy to prepare, and very versatile.  I used cod fillets and they were delicious.   As someone else suggested, I did put it on a metal rack inside a cookie sheet, to avoid a soggy bottom - great idea!

Everyone loved this! Took another's suggestion by putting it on a baking rack before putting it in the oven and squeezing some lemon on it. Only cooked it for 10 min. Kids even ate it.

Easy to make, good balance of flavours, and fish stayed moist.  The taste of the fish was preserved and not overwhelmed by the parmesian.  One note - the measurement for the bread, milk, and parmesian depend on the size of your filets.  You can probably get away with using less.

Delicious!  For those trying, I used a glass oblong glass dish and it came out perfect!!!I did not use a wire rack in dish.  Wire rack was not necessary.  I had no soggy bottom!!! I am going to use this for my basic fish recipes from now on.

LOVED IT! This is the first time (no joke) the whole family unanimously agreed that dinner was delicious! The only small adjustment I will make the next time is reduce the salt just a touch. I would also recommend making more than you think your family will eat. Its so good everyone will eat more than they normally would. Everything else was perfect.  Thank you for sharing it.

Needed a baking time / temp guide for haddock and this did the trick. For the coating, I didn't bother with the milk, subbed potato flakes for bread crumbs (no gluten), subbed Italian seasoning for the thyme (DH doesn't like it!), subbed a drizzle of olive oil for the butter (again, DH insisted...cholesterol and all that...) and subbed Romano for Parm (that's what I had in the fridge). So, this recipe is a great basic to have in your files as there are SO many ways to tasty it up.  For a single filet, I cut the baking time by just a few minutes, and as the filet had skin, I didn't coat the bottom (ergo, it didn't get soggy!).  The fish can actually dry out fast so keep an eye on it, but the easy-peasy prep and high temp / short cooking time are a godsend when dinner's running late. This is a keeper! And next time, just for me, I might try using those bran flakes!

Absolutely the best fish I've ever made!  After reading reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit:  I seasoned the fish fillets with paprika, salt, and pepper, then dusted them with flour.  I then dipped them in egg before pressing them into the crumb mixture to coat (I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular).  I placed the fish on a broiler pan before drizzling with butter.  The result was an amazingly crispy and flavorful fish.  The instructions about the high heat and top rack of the oven really made the difference.

Yum! Used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs and it gave the fish such a nice crunch. Also added some garlic powder, black pepper and a dash of cayenne for a nice kick.

Amazing, and tastes like fish sticks. Don't need too much butter on top, but it helps.

Tried it the first time using a wire rack under the fish and it still turned out a little soggy on the bottom so I might try putting the rack on top of the baking pan instead of inside it next time.

Excellent with a few slight modifications! I dipped the haddock into 1/2 cup milk mixed with 1 egg, mixed the salt into the breadcrumb (panko) mixture, added 1 tsp garlic powder, and used olive oil instead of butter for the drizzle. Baked at 350 for about 20 minutes on a foil-lined baking sheet with metal rack insert. Came out FANTASTIC! My family loved it (kids included)! Can't wait to make it again!!

I used Italian seasoning instead of thyme, otherwise ingredients were the same.  Make sure you actually stir the salt into the milk - makes a big difference. Just a great recipe!

Everyone I serve this to loves it! I changed a couple of things. I add about 1/2 tsp salt to the bread crumbs instead of the 2 teaspoons added to the milk. And I only use about 1/2 cup of milk. Wonderful!!

I would've rated this higher except for the lack of clarity for the ingredients--how much fish by weight? Haddock fillets are exceedingly variable--in y experience from 6 oz to over a pound. Also dry or fresh breadcrumbs? My 4 fillets weighed in at 1.75 lbs. I decided to go with panko for crunch. Needed to double the breading mixture. Also needed to flour the fish first before the milk wash or the crumbs wouldn't stick. I used EVOO instead of butter & baked on a rack. A good beginning & I'll be making it again(when I can get USA caught fresh haddock). Needs more seasoning.JMO

Followed this recipe to a T for a little over 1lb. of haddock and it came it out perfectly as the reviewers said! My daughter devoured it! Definitely a winner as is, but I am also sure other modifications suggested in the reviews would work too. I thought about trying them, but now that it came out so perfectly as written, I don't know. Follwed the advice on the wire cooling rack as well. Thank you for a super easy kid friendly recipe that even adults love.

Love this recipe, so full of flavor. I did use a baking rack so to keep both sides of the fish crispy and I did use spray butter opposed to drizzling the butter on top.

HUGE hit with my 2 year old and 6 year old!  Needless to say I will be making this on a regular basis.  However I am going to try experimenting with it a little as I think it needs a little more flavor.  My husband thought it was definitely a keeper though!

This was "ok". The fish were way too soggy on the bottom, even though I followed the baking directions.   I'll have to try putting the fish on a rack like someone else suggested.

Good flavor.  I couldn't find haddock anywhere, so I used Cod.  Also, to decrease the fat content, I left out the butter and pan fried the fish with a little bit of olive oil.  Although I'm sure the butter would have added to the flavor.  Still turned out good.

I used tilapia and panko because that's what I had on hand.  Had some trouble getting the breadcrumbs to stick to the fish and at 500 degrees the breadcrumbs started to burn before the fish was cooked. Even with my problems, everyone loved it so I will definitely try it again.

My husband, the fish lover, said this was excellent.  For me, one who is trying to acquire the taste for fish, it was a wonderful step into trying a new taste with some known favorite flavors (the parmesan cheese and bread crumbs).  Our boys (ages 3 and 18 months, at the time) loved it.

This recipe is awesome.  I did what some others suggested and put it on a cooling rack which helped the recipe not to become soggy on the underside.  My hubby is very fussy and said that he would eat this again which is a big accomplishment.

Simple and delicious!  An easy, no stress way to add a healthy meal to your repertoire.  The only change for us was to add 2 minutes to the cooking time; we like the coating to be crispy.

As good as, or better, than any restaurant we've had baked fish at.

If I could give it 10 stars, I would!  Made this according to recipe and added Mrs. Dash and garlic powder to the bread crumbs.  I don't even like fish, and I had seconds!  Family loved it.  Will definitely make this again and again!

AWESOME is all I can say.  The perfect flavor and was not soggy at all.  I bought 1 pound (enough for 2 people) and baked it on 400 for 10 minutes and 500 for 10 minutes.  I came out perfect and my husband raved about it and wants it again.  I used I Cannot Believe It Is Not Butter and flavored bread crumbs.  Delicious with a squirt of lemon.  I love Haddock, but mine always missed something and was a bit bland.  This is better than any restaurant Haddock by far.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Very, very good! I cut the salt in 1/2. Seasoned with Italian bread crumbs. After the butter drizzle I squirted some lemon over the fish. I agree with other reviewers, put fish on a cookie rack over a tray for absolute crispiness. Also the 500 temperature is correct!....don't modify it! I baked for about 12minutes. Yummy good!

Didn't have plain bread crumbs, so used italien breadcrumbs and omitted thyme. (we didn't like with thyme) Also used cooking spray on botton of my pan.

Pretty tasty! The bottom did get a little soggy, but as another reviewer said you can place it on a wire rack to prevent this. I also sprayed the bottom of the pan before baking and it didn't stick at all. I was quite taken aback by the high heat and length of time, but it came out great! 
I will definitely make this again, but maybe try to make it slightly healthier by not using the butter. 
The only changes I made to the recipe were adding pepper to the bread crumb mix and using Japanese bread crumbs because that's all I had. Turned out well.

Very very easy and yummy!  I used seasoned whole wheat bread crumbs and fresh thyme and skipped the salt.  I think I could have covered at least 2 more fillets with this amount of coating and, perhaps, could have used less butter.  Will definitely be in the winter menu rotation.

Awesome recipe! A tiny bit on the tasteless side. Even just a squirt of lemon may have helped that though. Very nice! Will cook again. Thanks for sharing.

SO good and simple!  I am allergic to dairy, so I used soy milk and soy butter and breaded mine before adding the cheese for the others.  Delish!

The bottom was soggy.  Next time I will listen to other reviews and use a metal cooling rack in the bottom of the glass baking dish.

Awesome! I followed the recipe to a T - but I didn't put the butter on it. It was awesome. The Thyme gives it just the perfect flavor. My husband lovved it and he's very picky.

Very delicious!  Added some seasoning and used a rack to avoid sogginess like in some of the reviews.  Only problem was it was way too salty in my opinion, if I used less than half the salt it would have been perfect.

Wonderful! I used olive oil instead of butter on top.
My problem was that it was soggy on the bottom. I think next time (and there will be a next time) I
might skip the planko crumbs on the bottom. I also used some smokey paprika.  I added salt at the table.

I do love fish but I hate cooking it. I always either cook it too much or under cook it. This recipe is "spot on". My husband loved it and I was sooo surprised. Simple but perfection. I kept oven at 375. For 17 min. Convection. Making this again as my husband would like it once a week!!! YES!!!

great recipe!  loved it.  I used 3 tbs butter and added dried thyme and garlic powder and eggs rather than milk.  I also put it on a wire rack so it would not be soggy as others suggested.

Very simple and delicious. I made this Gluten Free by crushing rice&corn chex and adding a little GF flour mix instead of bread crumbs. Worked great! the cheese makes this!

I would suggest soaking the filets in the milk/salt mix for a while if you are using frozen fish.

This has the potential to be good, but mine turned out very salty and I had only used half the suggested salt.  Next time I would eliminate the salt.  I also used Italian breadcrumbs which added a lot of flavor.  The fish was crispy - not soggy at all like others complained.

This is an excellent basic recipe. I adjusted a bit by  dredging only the top of the filet in beaten egg and then dredging the top in seasoned panko (the beauty of this recipe is that one may season with your favorite seasoning) .I then drizzled 2 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter over the top of the panko and baked in the 500 degree oven for 10-11 minutes.  I decided not to use cheese and it was still delicious. The fish will normally start to separate when done. I think that if one puts the egg/panko mixture on the top only, there is no soggy bottom.

Alittle salty for my taste but if you just reduce the parmesan a bit, it's the perfect recipe.  Flip the fish around to make the bottom less soggy.

YUM.... We really enjoyed this dish.  I melted the butter in the pan then poured it into a cup so that I could pour it back over the fish when I put it in.  This worked really well... the fish got crispy and very flavorful!

Quick and easy.  I used seasoned italian bread crumbs and some extra panko crumbs that I needed to use up.  I skipped the butter and did bake on a rack.  Used extra seasoning with the milk/salt mixture for more flavor.  Needed tartar sauce to finish it off.

This recipe is simple, but so delicious!  My teenaged son was not happy we were having fish for dinner, but he went back for seconds.  I used tilapia in place of haddock, just because it was less expensive.   Thanks for a great recipe, Linda!

I am a die hard broiled haddock fan because baked haddock always seems dry - but this is my new go-to haddock recipe.  Made 4 pieces and between dh & I - there were NO leftovers.  Delish!

This is a fantastically simple recipe, though I added paprika and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs and parmesan mix.  500 degrees for 15 minutes was perfect!  Granted, the bottom of the fish was a little soggy, but the flavor was out of this world.  Next time I'm going to try baking the fillets on a cooling rack in  the baking dish.  Oh, and I used Cod instead of Haddock and is was delicious.

Had a nice flavor but mine came out soggy and  did has others have suggested and put it on a rack.  If I made this again I wouldn't definitely cut back on the butter--maybe even omit it.

This was a very good recipe. I followed the advice of another and baked the fish on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet covered with foil. It kept the fish crispy all the way around and minimized clean-up. Tartar sauce would be delicious with the fish but I didn't have any so we just used ketchup. Served it with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. Made a wonderful meal!

Excellent recipe. Followed the recipe exactly, except using tilapia, which is what I had on hand. May try adding a bit of lemon zest the next time. But, definitely a keeper. Drizzle with just a small amount of butter if you want to avoid the soggy bottom.

This is the best recipe to achieve a crunchy, flavourful baked fish. Definitely put the fish on a rack as another reviewer suggested, so that both sides are crisp. For my oven, 10 minutes on 500F was sufficient, so be sure to check on it. I will make this again!

This is the best meal you've ever made mom, it's awesome!! That was from my son, he's 42! So I have save this and I will be serving this again. I too had to change things, made half my bread crumbs out of stuffing as I didn't have enough, and added an egg to the milk mixture. Thanks so much for this recipe! I don't often get compliments, and never like I did tonite, the whole family loved it!

This was excellent.  The most telling-- my wife doesn't usually care for fish, but she loved it.    We didn't have any parmesan cheese left, so I used an Irish cheese called 'Dubliner' that we needed to use before it went out of date, and it was really good.  I suspect that many different cheeses could be used for variation in flavor.   Also, my wife cannot have gluten so we used gluten-free breadcrumbs.  This looks like one of those recipes that you can make many different ways.

Wonderful dish! My husband made it exactly as per the recipe apart from using bass instead of haddock. Was crispy with the butter.  A side note: He says he didn't need nearly as much milk as the recipe indicates.

This recipe was quick, easy and yummy. I may add some extra seasoning next time as I thought it needed a little something extra but still worth the 4 stars. I also agree with the other reviews that you MUST use the wire rack.

I used  fresh haddock and followed directions exactly.  My husband and I just did not like it. The texture of the fish was perfect but the taste was not impressive.  I will stick to the simple way I usually bake it... with melted butter and tarragon on top.

I'd say this about 4 1/2 stars because it is quick and easy, has a good taste as is, and can be easily changed with different spices and such. I love fish and am trying to get away from always going out for seafood dishes and getting away from fried foods. Thanks.

This recipe is delicious! I am not much of a cook and this recipe is very easy and simple. Instead of all milk, I used one egg (and the rest milk). I used panko bread crumbs. I also sprayed the pan with Pam. It really helps it to not stick to the pan when it's done.  I put it in the oven for exactly 15 minutes. The smell is very appetizing and the taste is light and buttery (I didn't even think those could go together!)  It was so good, I made it again the next night.  Definetely a keeper!

A good, simple way to cook white fish. Good, but nothing spectacular. I used stuffing mix because I didn't have plain breadcrumbs or panko. I'd recommend sticking with the crumbs. Also, I doubled the amount of thyme and added about a teaspoon of garlic power, plus some salt and pepper, to the crumb mixture.
And the milk didn't do much to help adhere the crumbs, so I think next time I'll use egg with a splash of milk instead.
I used a broiler pan for this, and it cooked perfectly. Broiler pans are wonderful; if you don't have one, they are awesome for baking meat. The juices and fat run into the bottom of the pan, and with this recipe,  it helped avoid soggy-bottomed fish.
Overall, a great starter recipe.

As a family who eats no fish/seafood of any kind, wanting to be healthier I decided we had to start somewhere.  After talking with family and friends I decided to try a haddock recipe.  I tried this recipe, my husband and two boys LOVED it...we now have it at least once a week.  My oldest son would not have eaten it had I told him it was fish so we call it "Atlantic chicken".  Yum!!

My children, age 13 and 2, loved this.  In order to avoid the soggy bottoms I melted the butter in the baking dish.  This heated up the pan just enough to turn out perfect.

This came out well. I liked the flavors from the parm and butter, but it wasn't too much for the fish. It's a good place to start from. I may try baking it on a rack next time to help make it a little crisper.

My hubby and me liked this recipe.  It was tasty and SO easy to throw together.  I did add some minced garlic to the melted butter.  I used 1/2 cup of seasoned bread crumbs and 1/4 cup plain Panko crumbs for extra a little extra crunch.

Why 5 stars? Because #1 I don't really care for fish ergo, I usually don't cook it. And #2 my children actually ate the fish. All in all, a recipe worth repeating!

Used 6 thawed haddock filets (1/3 Costco bag), whipping cream, and fresh parmesan over top, before it went in the oven. Only took 8-9 minutes. Served with Kraft Mac&Cheese and ceasar salad. This was really good for the adults, the anti-fish kids split a piece. Like fish sticks! SO EASY and took no time. Next time, will use Panko and baking rack on baking sheet.

Personally I love baked fish of any kind and this in my books was a real winner.  I doubled the recipe because I had 8 pieces of haddock...but the next time I make it I think I will reduce the amount of parmesan cheese because I found it to be a little too overwhelming. (maybe use 1/4 cup parmesan in 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs) I also added a little bit of pepper and dried parsley flakes for colour.  I omitted the melted butter and used a little bit of butter flavoured cooking spray instead.  It's really good drizzled with a little bit of lemon juice.  A keeper.

This was a great recipe.  Neither my fiance nor I are big fish eaters, but we are on a mission to start eating it more, so I used this recipe.  I couldn't find haddock at the store, so I got tilapia instead, and I thought it came out great.  We will definitely be making this again.  The only thing I would do differently is add some butter to the bottom of the pan instead of just pouring it over top of the fish.

I coated the bottom of the baking dish with Pam and only used about half the suggested melted butter.  other than that, I followed the recipe and it came out very good.

Made exactly as described, was pretty good.  I was hoping for a crispier coating though.  I did use a rack as some suggested.  Trying to get close to fried fish crispiness without having to fry.  Maybe panko would help?

this was a great alternative to the mess of frying haddock. I did not have breadcrumbs around so I used old bay (for the first time) and I think that it is way too salty in combination with the salted milk in the batter.

my 1 year old daughter loved it and we ate it for lunch/dinner and lunch again with unpeeled mashed potatoes mixed with peas!

I have never baked/broiled (i broiled this one) fish before and it was incredibly easy

Definately a great baked haddock recipie!  It was a little on the salty side but I didn't follow the recipie exactly.  I used Kraft parmasean cheese instead of fresh...and I didn't use the butter.  To make it a lighter dish, I just used spray butter before I put it in the oven.

Used Herb d'Provence spice instead of thyme and per another reviewers recommendation lightly drizzled orange juice on top - but not too much to soak the crumbs. Served with rice pilaf. The family devoured it!

It was so easy. I was hesitant about cooking it that long at that high a temperature, but it was perfect. The only changes I made were to reduce the salt and use cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, since I didn’t have any plain bread.

I used sole instead of haddock. Used a bit of milk and egg white for dipping. Used season salt. The filets were thin so I cut down the baking time. Broiled for the last minute to get a bit of a crispiness to the top. Served with lemon wedge and tartar sauce. So believe this recipe could be used for any whitefish.

Epic failure! 500.F  for 15 minutes was too hot-too long. I did cut down on the butter, which made it even drier. Wasn't a big fan of the breading either. This recipe could be good with some tweaking.

This was very easy to make and absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was I used part Asiago cheese because I did not have enough Parmesan. We will be making this again! My husband is an ice fisherman and can’t wait to try this with some fresh bass.

you need to add Old Bay if you dream of living on the East coast.  Mayo & Parmesan is delicious but to amp up the recipe add about 1/2 tsp of  Old Bay seasoning to the recipe.  It is so delish .. we use old bay in a lot of our seafood recipes.

Did use fresh cod instead.  About 1 inch fillets.  Omitted spice and used dried Basil.  Shortened bake time by 2 minutes, and gladI did.  It was perfect and not dried. Great flaking.   I did put more of the crumb and Parm mixture over the fish.  Used regular amounts of salt and pepper.   Wife gave it five stars. I agreed!

Great recipe! Very tasty. Made a few changes...I whisked in 1 egg in the milk mixture and used Himalayan pink salt instead of table salt. Sprinkled lime juice on fish before dipping. Used Japanese style Panko crumbs with fresh Italian Parmesan I grated myself, 1/4  tsp thyme and added 1/8  tsp chimichurri seasoning. Cooked in glass casserole dish. Oven temp and time were perfect. Can't wait to cook it again!

I love this recipe!  I make it quite often and it's easy but very tasty.  I usually use cod but whatever white fish you have is fine.  Great recipe and easy.

Delicious! I followed the recipe with only a couple changes. I added garlic salt instead of regular salt to the milk mixture. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and I didn't have thyme so I threw in a teaspoon of Mrs Dash instead. I used someone else's suggestion to preheat the dish, which I sprayed with Pam and that worked perfectly to prevent a soggy bottom. Will definitely make again.

I made this tonight for dinner, as I was looking for something quick and easy using haddock. I didn't think that I needed that much milk, so I cut the amount needed in half. I also seasoned the bread crumbs to my taste as I didn't have parmesan (and I don't like cheese with seafood).

I followed the tip that said to use a rack to bake the fish to prevent sogginess and that was a great tip.

Will definitely make this again

I am a southern born retiree with New England roots, now living on the Boston coast.  I grew up on a mixture of recipes from both backgrounds.  I love this recipe.  The suggestion to use a greased rack in the baking dish is a good one. 
 I wasn't sure how many pounds of haddock this recipe was using, but I used one pound, very fresh haddock from an ocean market nearby. I used half the amount of each ingredient, except no salt. 
I too found I needed more like 20 minutes for the baking time, though my filets were not overly thick.  I made a "southern change", using buttermilk instead of milk (needed to use some up).  As far as salt, I go the low salt route and had to add none because the lemon pepper has both salt and paprika in it and the seasoned bread crumbs (Italian style) have many herbs & some salt.  Also, from this locale, all fish dishes use the "Old Bay" seasoning, which also has sodium, paprika and red pepper.  Yet it is not really spicy . I didn"t use the thyme, just a choice thing. 
Since I used buttermilk, I only used butter spray on both sides of the filets, no melted butter.

My husband hates the smell of fried fish and this great baked recipe is way easier to prepare, clean up after and most of all healthier. Yet no real smell in the house!  All is good here!

Thank you Linda!

This is a wonderfully delicious fish recipe.  I dried my fish with paper towels first. I put some of the melted butter in the bottom of my baking dish before adding the fish.  It was so so good.  I didn't have a soggy bottom problem.  No more pan frying for me.

Just adjusted the amounts of the ingredients as I only made one Haddock Fillet. I would make it again but might try adjusting the oven temp and/or cooking time.

It was very good. I used Tilapia instead of Haddock. I made 1 pound of fish and didn’t need anywhere close to the suggested coating ingredients. I could have made 5 pounds with what I had.

This was absolutely wonderful.  Here are some small changes I made: I used only 1 teaspoon of salt in the milk, and instead of just dipping the fish in the milk, I let it soak in the milk while I prepared other things; I used panko crumbs; and I added some lemon pepper to the crumbs.  Everything else stayed the same, and this was the best baked haddock I’ve ever had.  Simple and delicious.  Thanks for posting.

Quickly made this for dinner, and took advice of another reviewer putting it on a cake cooling grate to allow fish to crisp underneath vs soft with direct contact of dish.  Tasted a bit salty, so next time I won’t add salt to the milk and I’ll used unsalted butter.  Fish cooked nicely and it’s nice change from deep fried haddock.  I think I’ll add some chilli powder / smoked paprika next time vs thyme as it is a little bland for anyone that likes a even a small level of spice

I made this recipe to the T except for one change. I am gluten and grain free so I subbed out the bread crumbs for one fourth cup of coconut flour. It was absolutely delicious! Thanks for your creation!  I think the salted milk helped to retain moisture in the fish. Will def make this again.

This recipe is delicious. Tilapia is the usual staple in our home but I decided to try something new today. Followed the recipe and took the advice of a previous recommendation and used a cooking wire on the baking dish and added lemon as well. Hubby and kids devoured it!

Rarely do I bread fish or chicken but this time I tried it for my husband. I changed it only by adding a little lemon to the wet mixture. The fish came out very tender and flavorful. It wasn't like a crust which I liked very much. Very flavorful.

Followed the directions, with a few of the tips (placed it on a rack above the pan and squeezed a little lemon juice on top, after the butter). It was really delicious and so easy to make! Will definitely make it again...maybe using Italian seasoned bread crumbs or panko  crumbs, but great as is!

So easy. So yummy. My two kids (11 & 9) loved it.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I didn’t add the thyme.  Squeezing a lemon over the fish before putting in the oven and then having lemon quarters to squeeze over once plated was a good addition suggested here.  Will definitely make again.

, Don't waste your time.  Stove top pan or deep-fry and add some paprika.  I did 350f in the oven for 15min, turned out dry and stuck to the pan.  Flavour was good, texture was .  never doing that again.  BTW you do not need milk as it doesn't help in any way.

This is a wonderful easy recipe.  I don't use the salt, but have no idea why people are saying it's complicated.  Make all the time!!

Was very good though the breading on the bottom did not stay on when cooking and i cooked foe 12 minutes on 500 and reduced heat to 350 for an additional 15 minutes as it didn't brown initially.  I did add some black pepper, paprika,  onion and garlic powder  to the bread crumbs and omitted the salt in the milk due to dietary restrictions.

My husband loved this dish.  The only change I made was to use almond flour instead of bread crumbs and put in a sprinkle of garlic.   I will make it again

I have made this twice now; both times it was outstanding. Second time I even used cod and it was so delicious. My grandsons could not eat it fast enough. Next time, I will buy more fish so I get to have some too.

Easy to prepare and cook. Was very tasty. My wife who doesn't like fish did like this recipe. Next time i think i will leave off the butter on the top. The only other thing i would change is cooking the fish another 10 mins.

Made this to a T, and we loved it.  I did have to leave out the salt as hubby can't have it. This was so delicious, so enjoy it with the extra salt if you can.  We didn't miss it, so try it without and be healthier.  I will be making this again using less butter.  I might even try coconut /olive oil in place of the butter as we are trying to stay away from animal fats.

For a little crunch, drizzle the melted butter over the fillets and to keep it from sticking I like to put a little olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan(crunch too). Also, I like to cover the fillets with lemon, pepper, and paprika then coat with panko....Manifique

I used halibut, I thawed it in the milk in which I had put a little garlic salt, and a little sriracha & lime (signature blends)(why not add your favourite spices). I followed the recipe as recommended. The fish had absorbed some of the flavours and the fish was amazing.

I made this with haddock and with salmon. Both turned out well. Next time I think I that I will add some lemon to the butter for more flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. The Parmesan cheese added great flavour and the breadcrumbs added crunch. I served it wit sides of peas and mushroom, green pepper rice.

I made this with 1 lb. of haddock, (like Exeter Joe) omitted the milk, added white wine to the bottom of the baking dish.  Put the fish in, added salt, pepper, garlic powder & paprika on top.  Then I mixed some olive oil into whole wheat Panko crumbs and put that on top of the seasoned fish, eliminating the need for butter.  Baked about 20 minutes at 445 degrees, or until Panko looked crispy.   Delicious!

Great recipe.  I  followed exactly except cooked at 400 for 25 minutes and used fresh thyme from garden.  Family enjoyed it, finished it with a squeeze of lemon overtop.

This was excellent.  I did add a 1/2 tbsp of garlic powder and a 1/2 tsp ground black pepper to the breadcrumb mixture.  Cooking time was perfect!!  Delicious.  We will add this to our regular dinner rotation.  Thanks for the recipe

Excellent, quick and simple recipe! I put my fillets on a rack inside the glass dish and they came out crisp and flaky. Squeezed some fresh lemon juice on them after they came out of the oven - just delicious!! My husband and 6 year old loved it! Can't wait to make again!!

Delicious! I was looking for a better way to make fish. This recipe is a fantastic guideline for flavorful, flaky, perfect fish. After the first bite, my husband's exact words were, "Oh, wow." He ate every bite and then had some of mine! This will definitely be our go-to recipe going forward.

This was really good. I did modify it and used pecans instead of bread as I am trying not to eat bread carbs. I also dislike thyme so I used an herb mix that I liked instead. Great base recipe!

Served with fresh lemon wedges..better than restaurant baked haddock.Omitted salt since cheese has enough salt for flavoring.

Best haddock ever! I've been making this for a few years now and my family loves it!  I will not order haddock at a restaurant anymore because I know I can make this at home and it will taste way better. I do broil it for the last 1-2 minutes to make it a little crispy, but otherwise follow the recipe as written. Thanks to whoever posted this, my family loves it and requests this on a regular basis.

Delicious. Changed salt to 1/2 garlic salt 1/2 sea salt. Soaked fish in milk for 10 minutes then proceeded to coat. Needed 2 pans, the metal pan made for a crisper fish coating. Easy recipe with great results.

Loved it! Wouldn't change a thing....made sure my fish was room temp and dry.   Used my shallow broiling pan and placed the fish on one of my cookie cooling screens to prevent the "soggy bottom" others mentioned. It did stick a bit but my spatula is super thin and after a some coaxing, came up fine. Made sure the salt was well incorporated in the milk before dipping the fish.  After breading my fish and placing it on the screen I sprinkled the remaining crumbs on top then drizzled the butter on top with a spoon.  Husband, and kids raved about it and all agreed "this is a keeper"  Thank you for this recipe.

This is a wonderful way to cook fish. I used Panko breadcrumbs.  I cooked it on a cooling rack to keep the fish from getting soggy. I forgot the butter the first two times I made it and I didn't miss it. Between the lack of butter and the Panko it was really crunchy and good!

I cut down on the salt by half.  Everything else the same.  The ratio of breadcrumbs to cheese and thyme was perfect.  I did drizzle a little butter on the bottom of the pan before I put the fish in so it would brown nicely on both sides.  It was easy and fast and really good.  The temperature and time worked perfectly.

We're not big fish eaters but this made a really good haddock. Putting the fish on a baking rack was an idea from another review and worked well. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I was too cheap to buy haddock, so I used sea bass. Very easy and very good. As someone else suggested, I put fish on a rack to cook. Instead of melting butter I just put tiny pieces of butter on the fish. As I saw another reviewer do, I sprinkled salt, pepper and tiny bit of garlic and paprika on the fish before dunking in the milk. I ate a whole piece and I don't generally like fish!

I used fresh thyme and panko. I thought the flavour with the parmesan was excellent. The fish was firm and flaky.  I will definitely make this again.

I used a metal broiling pan rather than glass because I felt it unsafe that close to the broiler. I sprayed the pan with non-stick cooking spray. I couldn't find haddock, so used whitefish, and 15 minutes was not long enough cooking time. I moved the pan to the middle rack and reduced temp to 350. There was a lot of milk and bread crumb mixture left over, so I would reduce milk in the future. I sprinkled some of the leftover bread crumb mixture over the fish before baking.

Love this recipe with a few tweaks. I Sautéed shallots, fresh garlic and fresh thyme, in butter, Pinot Grigio and fresh lemon juice with a pinch of garlic salt and pepper. Greased the glass pan with olive oil and butter. Added a tbsp mayo to the milk. Then once the haddock was breaded and in the pan I poured the melted butter mixture over the haddock and added lemon slices on top before putting it in the oven. These added little tweaks made this dish come out fabulous and my boyfriend couldn't get enough!

I made this tonight.  It was wonderful.  I give it 5 stars.  The fish came out crispy and tender.  Not dried out.  The only change I made was to use panko instead of bread crumbs.  I give it five stars.

I pretty much followed the recipe.  It was easy to make and very tasty.  If you need to make a quick and tasty main dish, this is it!  Bake a potato in the oven before you put in the fish. Steam some asparagus  and you have dinner.

I made this and it was so tasty. I will definetely cook this again. I used Italian breadcrumbs. I deleted the salt and dry thyme but used A Vogel Herbamare seasoning. I also added garlic granules.  I didn't have milk but used half and half that I had on hand.

I used panko and substituted 1/2 tsp smoked paprika for the parmesan because I don't like cheese with fish.  Temperature and time was perfect.

I made this exactly as outlined in the recipe and was very impressed. It was quick to prepare and cooking time was nice and short. I lined my pan with parchment paper and it kept the coating nice and crispy. Had a salad with it; a nice quick dinner.   I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe was so good that I won't even feel bad heating up the leftovers in the staff room at work tomorrow. (The bottom did end up a bit soggy, so I would reccomend just using the breadcrumbs on top.) I used panko crumbs and added a few small squares of butter on top and spritzed them with Pam. Absolutely amazing!

very good.  made it with ingredients listed, BUT the recipe left about half  the milk and bread crumb mixture... so the next day i made fish again using them up as it seemed a waste to toss them.  

I baked it on a rack inside an oblong baking dish - the first night just plain, the second night i smartened up and lined the baking dish with foil.  You'll get lots of delicious drippings if you bake them on a rack

Last alteration - on the second night, i dipped the fish in milk all round, but only coated the top of the fish with the cheesy bread crumbs.... found on the first night most of that 'dropped' off the bottom anyway - noticed no difference.  great recipe will make again

This recipe is one of my favorites...easy and delicious.  I have made it quite a few times.  I usually use panko bread crumbs as they turn out more crispy.  I also cook the fish at a lower temperature (425 degrees) to avoid over browning and then increase the cooking time by about 5 minutes.

Best haddock or scrod recipe ever!I did switch it up a bit by combining some of the suggestions here.   Preseason with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. Then dipped in the milk, then the bread crumb mixture ( I used panko). I used dill since I did not have thyme. At the end I squeezed some lemon juice over and sprayed with PAM to crisp it up. I used a cooking rack on a foil lined cookie sheet at the directed temp and time. Rave reviews from family!! Flaky not soggy and perfectly seasoned!!

I hate fish.  My doctor says that I have no choice but to drop the meat.  I looked all over and tried this one and found a new love for haddock.  It was simple to prepare and add sliced tomatoes and cucumbers makes a fantastic meal.  Great Job

Really tasty and crispy. I took others advice and put the fish on a greased rack that hung over a baking dish to prevent fish from getting soggy. Oven temp and time were perfect. I padded the fish dry before placing in milk mixture. I halved the milk and salt as there was too much. Would be great for company. Next time I will try this recipe on tilapia, orange roughy and cod and squeeze fresh lemon juice before it goes in. May serve with lemon wedges. If I don't have a rack then will place on parchment paper. As suggested I could substitute milk with an egg or do half and half.

Made as is and served with some Aoli sauce (mayo, lemon juice and minced garlic). I was skeptical because it's so easy but this is fantastic!

Made this tonight and my husband and I loved it.  I followed the recipe very closely.  The breadcrumbs that I used were the seasoned Panko bread crumbs.  While I was mixing up the bread crumbs, I let the fish soak in the milk.  I didn't think that the bread crumbs adhered very well to the fish just by dredging, so I really had to press them in and even sprinkled some of the extra on top.  I loved the buttery crunch of the breading - it wasn't soggy at all.  I sprayed cooking spray in the bottom of the dish, so there were no issues with sticking.  The fish was very flaky, moist and delicious.  Very easy.  I definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe as indicated, but used tin foil to line the baking dish.  I placed the tin foil in the bottom of the pan so that it was crinkled and gave some lift to the Haddock filets. The bottom of the filets were still a bit soggy, but everything was very tasty!

yummy! My husband and I both loved this dish! My thanks to the reviewer who suggested thoroughly drying the fish, especially when previously frozen. I defrosted it early in the day and went thru several paper towel wraps over a few hours to remove excess water - resulting baked fish was very moist, but not soggy like some other reviewers complained. I also did not have any thyme at home, but used dried parsley instead - gave it a lovely color bonus and tasted great!

Only reason I am rating this 4 instead of 5 is because I didn't bake the fish so I couldn't exactly say this was 5 star if I didn't follow the method. Instead I pan fried it in the butter, some oil and a little garlic. Other than that I followed the recipe and got delicious, perfectly cooked fish. Served alongside some mac and cheese. Had a lemon in the fridge ready to squeeze over if required, but the lemon is still in the fridge as it wasn't needed :)

I didn't have any thyme,so I used dill and lemongrass along with Progresso Italian bread crumbs. U served out with mashed red potatoes and LeSeur peas. My hubby who usually isn't a fish lover, said the meal was excellent.

This was so quick and  easy and came out wonderful.   I added a little extra cheese than what the recipe called for.  It was delicious. My kids also loved it and asked me to make it again.  Its a great dish to make when you don't have a lot of time.

It was good.  I wasn't wowed by it.  The fish just needed 10 minutes in the oven to cook and even then it was a tad dry.  So keep an eye out for it when it's in the hot oven.  I would suggest checking fish after 8 minutes and then every minute afterwards.  I forgot to pour the melted butter over the fish before putting in the oven which might explain why it was a bit dry.  I used cod filets.  I might make again.

This is outstanding!  Will definitely make again!  I did use other reviewers' suggestions to place fish on a wire rack coated with cooking spray so the bottom of the fish would not get soggy.  This worked like a charm although next time I will not use as much butter.  It dripped into the pan below and caused quite a bit of smoke!  Ahhhh!

Made for the first time.  Fantastic.  I did use some of the tips from the reviews...i.e. placing the fillets on a rack to prevent getting soggy.  I will definitely make this again.

this is the only way  I will make halibut.  I lined a pan with foil, put a rack in the pan, sprayed with canola spray.      I dipped he fish in whisked egg, then pressed the fish into a   a   spiced rub  and panok, poured melted butter on top, baked for 15 minutes at 500 degrees, squeezed fresh lemon and served.................so good

I didn't have a lot of bread crumbs on hand, so I added some slivered almonds to the mix.  The topping was crunchy and the fish was delicious!   I will definitely be making this again!

My change: 

First salt and pepper the fish.  Then melt the butter and let cool a bit.  Then mix the butter with the breadcrumbs and parmesan. Dip the top of the fish in the milk and coat it with the breadcrumb/cheese mixture and bake at 425 for 20 minutes.

This was delicious! I used  eggs instead of milk and added about 1/2 tsp old bay to the bread crumb/cheese mixture.  Placed fish on a greased wire rack rather than directly on pan and cooked as directed. Put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end just to crisp it up a bit more. Will make sure to have cooking spray on hand next time I make this to avoid that step.

We fish ALOT & this recipe will be used OFTEN :-)  I used whiting, had to omit the parmesan, but substituted lime for the zesty flavor.  (My husband hates all cheeses--so sad. Lime vs. lemon because we have a lime tree.) I let the fish sit in the salted milk a few minutes while I ground the thyme to release the flavor.  The only bread crumbs I had were Panko--which made this AWESOME!!!  After coating the fish with thyme/panko, I drizzled melted butter & fresh squeezed lime. Baked on a wire rack--AMAZING!

Only four stars because Haddock is not a favorite fish of mine. I sautéed some onions with the butter melt and that turned out well adding a bit more crunch on top!

This is one of the quickest, no hassle haddock preparations that produces stellar crowd pleasing results. We use panko crumbs as they stand up best under the butter.  We also cook it in glass on parchment paper.
This is a staple "go-to" for our family.

Well, my husband raved about it (which is very very rare for any meal, but especially for fish) so that makes a 5 star! He implored me to save it to make again because allegedly I never make the winners twice. Typically I have modified the recipe and I can't remember what I did but here it is.... Used cod. Rubbed on lemon juice before dipping in the milk. Seasoned the breadcrumbs (way too bland). Drizzled with lemon-garlic butter (homemade). It did take the whole 15 minutes for a thin piece (to my surprise). It did not come out crispy at the perfect doneness - took about 5 minutes longer but it didn't dry the fish out so that worked fine. I did cook it on a wire rack on top of the cookie sheet but the butter that dripped onto the sheet burned at that high temp and smoked up the house. That method would probably work better with oil sprayed on instead of butter drizzle but I was looking forward to the flavor punch.

Since I am not a fish lover a rating of 4 stars is much better than good for me. I did squeeze a lemon over the fish first and I did not use the thyme.  I have made this recipe a few times now.  It is quick, easy and very tasty.

When my kids ask for a third or fourth helping, the recipe deserves 5 stars!  I cooked the fish for about 13 minutes atop a rack on a cookie sheet.  Both sides were crispy.   I did not add the salt to the milk as I used some pre-seasoned breadcrumbs.  This recipe would appeal to someone on the fence about fish.  Haddock is very light tasting and the parmesean cheese provides wonderful flavour.

The entire family loved this fish. I used ground pretzels instead of bread crumbs.  It did get a little soggy on the bottom.  if I would have read the reviews prior to cooking the fish, I would have known to use a wire rack. I will make this again.

my husband and i really liked this recipe but when we make it again we will definately cut back on the salt. we found it to salty (and we do like salt), and we had to bake it a little longer to crisp it up. really good recipe.

I have made this recipe for years with a few alterations. #1 I do not dip in milk. I lay the fish in the pan and top with all the crumbs. If I do put crumbs in the bottom I just sprinkle some in without milk. And then lay the fish on the crumbs and top with the rest.#2 I use seasoned croutons or ritz crackers #3 I have also added shredded mozza/cheddar cheese to the crumb mixture and topped the fish with that. All these are awesome and a favorite at our house.

I just made this. We did not like it at all. I followed the recipe.  I sprayed PAM on the bottom.  It had no taste. I also added Emeril's Essence seasoning and this fish still did not taste good.  Won't make this again.

Super simple to prepare which is good but, it seemed rather bland to my wife and I. I even added a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning to the milk/salt mixture and another teaspoon to the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture and topped it with some fresh squeezed lemon when it was done. This just was not as flavorful as I had hoped. I believe this can be a good recipe if you tinker around with seasonings to make it your own.

Superb!  My family has always liked the fish I made on the stovetop, but they really raved about this!  It's a simple recipe, much like I did before, so no major change other than putting in the oven, and that made all the difference.  15 min was the perfect time for a lovely, flakey fish.  Will be my go-to recipe from now on.

By far the tastiest fish I have ever had! I bought 2 lbs of haddock with the skin on, dipped it in the milk mixture, then laid in on a large cookie sheet and then covered with the bread crumbs and drizzled the melted butter. Baked it as directed. So good that my husband even said it was the best he's ever had...better than a restaurant. A keeper for sure !

Very good baked fish recipe. Delicious, moist and flavorful.  I used all ingredients listed, just lowered the amount of salt and butter. I also used an aluminum disposable pan which worked well.  Used 500 degree temperature and fish was done in 13 minutes.  Will make again soon.

A Simple and Easy Recipe that makes some very delicious Baked Haddock.  I would recommend that you let your Baked Haddock Filets soak in the Milk Mixture while you put together the Bread Crumb Mixture.  Make sure that you cook your Baked Haddock at 500 Degrees, because the very high Oven temperature melts and sears in the milk and cheese into the Filets.  I would keep an eye on the time and start looking at 13 minutes.

Great dish that's fast & easy! I didn't change much...just added some shredded cheddar cheese & cracked pepper with 5 mins of cooking time left. I'm not sure I'd add the Thyme next go-around...might add some garlic & onion powder instead???

Use egg instead of milk; add minced garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil
Use raisin bran crumbs (no raisins) and mix in some coconut cramps
Use 1/2 or less salt
Instead of butter use 1/2 butter and half coconut oil

This is my go-to recipe for most kinds of white fish now.  I spray the filets with olive oil (instead of drizzling with butter) before putting in the oven to get a little crunch on them.

Delicious and very very easy to make! I baked it for 20 mins and covered it with aluminum foil for the last 5 minutes so the inside would have time to get flaky with browning the crust too much.

It probably doesn't matter which white fish you use... I think the most important thing is the method of cooking. I'm from a small fishing village in Nova Scotia and our old folks wouldn't even consider defiling the fish by putting it in the oven period let alone keeping it in there for 15 minutes. I really recommend simply frying the fish in a good old fashion frying pan on medium high for a MAXIMUM of two minutes on each side (the limited cooking time is key). Sublime. My husband and kids have hated every fish recipe I've tried on them. Except this one. My husband ASKS for it, and my kids think it's chicken! haha!! :o) P.S. Sometimes I use crushed corn flakes instead of breadcrumbs (and I think it might even be a bit better -the kids say it smells like popcorn?). Happy cooking! -Shannon from Tusket Falls, Nova Scotia

This was really good. Used a rack to keep from getting soggy and used egg with milk for dipping. Used panko bread crumbs but will use regular next time.

I used panko breadcrumbs. I didn't have any thyme and used pepper, dried cilantro. I put pieces of butter on top of the breaded fish. It turned out great! So moist! Such a simple recipe.

Very tasty and definitely a repeat.  QUICK as well :)
Added garlic powder to the breadcrumbs, used soy milk and egg mix, and heated the pan before putting fish in per other reviews.
Haddock was thick so I gave it 25 mins total at 500, last 10 covered in foil to prevent burning.

This was a great basic recipe! I used panko bread crumbs and they gave the fish a great crunch. I also followed other users recommendations and cooked it on a wire rack, but this made the butter drip off into the pan and burn/smoke in the high heat, so I think I'll skip that next time. You can definitely add to this, but it's a great, easy recipe as is.

Excellent! I took the advice of placing the fillets on a cooling rack and used a cookie pan. I also reduced the temperature to 425. Works better in my oven that way. It turned out crispy and delicious.

I had One 1 lb fillet of cod, and followed the recipe to a T.
It turned out smelling fishy (no, the fish was fresh) and not
crusty and thick, but sort of mushy, even though you could see
the flakes.

Next time will do it with BUTTERMILK instead of milk.

This was good, and I'm not crazy about fish (but eat it so my kids will and because my husband LOVES fish). I tried this recipe as written and received rave reviews from my husband and son. I will make this again because I'm trying to increase our fish dinners from once to twice a week regularly, but I may tweak the recipe just a a bit. So... for me - 4 stars, for the fish lovers in my family - 5+

Admittedly, I am not the biggest fish fan in the world, but my husband requested fish for dinner.  This was pretty good, although I did use cod because I couldn't find haddock.  Not sure what the difference is in flavor, but we all enjoyed it.  I might add some Old Bay next time, or play with the seasonings a bit.  But it's a great starter recipe.

This recipe was delicious.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, cut back on the parmesan cheese and substituted thyme leaves for ground thyme then cooked on the grill.  I wrapped it in parchment paper then tin foil and grilled at 500 on a Weber BBQ for about 15 minutes.

I thought this was an easy and tasty preparation for haddock.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh thyme instead of dried.  And I put some pats of butter on the bottom of the dish and then laid the filets on top.  The bottom was a bit soggy, but I didn't find that a problem.  Everyone in the family really enjoyed it.  And "4 filets" is a bit generic; I find that about 6 oz of fish per person is a good amount.  I served with a salad and fresh peas from our garden.

This was the first seafood dish I had ever prepared. It was an extremely easy recipe, but with delicious results. Adding just a thin layer of Original Pam to the baking dish ensures the skin will not burn if side dishes are running behind as did mine. The Haddock was flaky, yet firm enough to hold together using a fork. The buttered flavor is something you will won't to adjust to taste, as is the amount of breading. Possibly, sprinkling more bread crumbs half way through could add some texture. Overall, I will use this recipe again. Especially, when I want an easy meal to prepare.

I tried this recipe but felt it truly didn't unlock its true potential. I replaced the milk with egg, although this would be a good alternative to those with egg allergies.

I coated the fish with the same ingredients and left overnight in the fridge. I think this helps the breadcrumbs stop falling off when frying in a pan.
Approx 20 hours later i added a splash of olive oil in a frying pan and put the fish in when the oil was hot. Cooking time 4 mins each side on a med-high heat. 
The Parmesan flavour was much more intense and the olive oil brings it up to 5 star.

I give it 3.5 stars.  It tastes pretty good but next time I would mix the butter into the bread crumbs so it comes out with a crispier texture.  I also took the advice of another poster who suggested putting the fish on cooling racks before putting it in the pan.  Wise advice.  With a little tweaking it would be 4.5 stars.

Fantastic recipe. This can be made without the cheese if you want but is very tasty with it. Also, any other standard spices (cayenne, paprika, etc) can be added if you want a different twist on it.

So easy and so delicious. My new favourite way to prepare haddock. I see some people found it soggy on the bottom, I didn't experience that, I did however spray the bottom of my dish with non-stick spray. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

Haddock is our choice of fish,we're east coast with abundant haddock. I halved the salt as everything already has salt in it.If I had used all that it would have been overkill.It came out perfect-oven temp and time was perfect.No sogginess on bottom of glass pan. I drizzled butter and lemon on top-added garlic to the butter mixture.I normally make extra in everything I cook so we have left overs for lunch the next day,there were only 2 small pieces left,so we'll have to fight over them! The fish came out fantastic and hubby filled up as usual! This was my 4th time making this.This is a 5 star recipe! update-I have used a rack that is sprayed but turn on your fans and open a window a little to not set off fire alarms.Even better this way.Dont be fooled by the high temp-its perfect! We all lov this and its a regular. We eat a 2 lb package.

Best recipe so far. Trying to incorporate more fish into my diet and finding easy ways to do it. I made this with cod and I can't tell you the difference between the white fishes but I'm assuming they are pretty interchangeable. Made 4 different recipes tonight and this is the one I'm keeping. Very easy prep, baked and not fried and no heavy sauces, butters or creams. Tasted great and healthy too.

Great recipe. Works wonders with fish that usually turns out a bit dry when baked ( like white fish). The coating seals juices inside the fish, so it turns deliciously delicate and flaky. 
Tried with white fish, egg (instead of milk), omitted sprinkling with butter. Wasn't watery at all! Pat fish dry before dipping in milk and crumbs- this might help.

I used this recipe with some thin tilapia fillets and thought it was delicious. I used slightly less butter than was called for, baked it for 17 minutes, and ended up with beautifully browned fish. The outer coating was crisp and the inside was moist. I will definitely be adding this to the regular rotation. Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

Quik, simple & very tasty. Made this @ my sister-in-law's house. Only thing I would try to correct is the slightly soggy bottom of the fish.    I'm going 2.try panko crumbs mixed w/shredded Parmesan (vs grated) & see how this works. Might crisp up things a little bit; but the recipe was excellent as shown.

Could not be easier and comes out so delicious.  I wondered about not cooking the fish on the top of the stove before putting in the oven but not to worry, comes out perfect.

I took the advice of using a wire cooling rack and it was still mushy at the bottom for me. I wish for the love of all things FISH and Yummy that mine came out like the picture, but it didn't I now see the idea to use egg, maybe the milk and the fact that it seemed like watery and delicate fish is why it was soggy. I will try the eggs next time though. The fish is tasty though, and I added other spices to the milk like pepper,garlic powder and onion powder.

My husband was a commercial fisherman and thinks he knows how to cook fish (trust me, he does not). I made this recipe for him last week and he said it was the best haddock he has ever eaten. I have to agree with him, it was delish.

Followed most of the recipe, but I rolled the fish in light mayo instead of milk. I also added onion powder, garlic, lemon juice, and little cajun. Felt the recipe needed a little more flavor. I used Flounder fillet- GREAT!!!

It was very good. No fishy flavor. However, there wasn't much other flavor either. It could be improved with some other seasonings. Easy and makes a quick dinner.

this was great!    I followed the recipe almost exactly, just cutting down on the butter and thyme.   The fish was so flaky and crispy.   The high heat did really well.    Next time, I will eliminate the thyme altogether, but that is just a personal preference.   I think any spices would be great (garlic, onion, Old Bay, etc).    Any mild fish would work too.   Really good base recipe that you can tweak to your liking.

I made this with cod.  it was wonderful.  To keep it more Weight Watcher friendly I omitted the melted butter & sprayed the fish with butter flavored Pam.  It was wonderful & will make it again.  It was crispy and much better than fried fish, without the added grease.

I'm nervous about cooking fish usually, but this recipe was so easy and turned out perfectly! I used a rack in the baking dish as well and both sides were crispy while the fish inside was moist and so tender.

I took a reviewer's suggestion and used a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet.  Worked great.  This is as close to the fried taste I love but without frying.  Followed the receipe exactly except melted little butter substitue and I always combine an egg with milk when I get read to bread.  Wonderful Recipe.

This turned out great.  I had to substitute dill, as another member suggested, because I had no thyme.  I also put a little extra virgin olive oil on the pan, because a few members mentioned they had issues with the fish sticking.  That helped.  500 degrees for 15 minutes was right on.  The fish was not dry or burnt at all.

This has become our favorite way to eat haddock - my husband raves to all his friends, and I find it a simple and delicious alternative to fried fish.  I sometimes add a few sea scallops to the bake to make it a little more interesting.  I always bake the entire recipe and then have it again another day (even more delicious)!

First of all this was great!  I did make a couple changes.  First I placed the milk with coconut milk and I replaced the bread crumbs with low sodium Ritz crackers.  My company really liked this also.  It is a keeper!!  Thanks!

Very good. All three of my kids gobbled it up and that rarely happens.  Was going to use the cooling rack for the crisp bottom crust but forget in the rush to get it in the over.  No one minded the soggy crust a bit.

Just had this for dinner tonight. The BEST haddock I have ever had and I am not a big fish person. My husband who is a fish person loved it! Made it just as the recipe said, but put it in the oven in a cast iron pan and the bottom was not soggy. Will be making this over and over again for sure!!! Thank you!

Cooking fish has always given me anxiety.  This recipe has changed my confidence level and found that it comes out perfect for us time and again.  We have used cod and haddock but believe that other white fish might be able to be used as well.

Very good and very easy! I actually used this on cod instead of haddock and substitued the parmesan with feta. I ended up using much less milk than the recipe suggested.

I had soggy bottoms as well. The recipe was easy and had few ingredients and it did taste 'deep fried', it just wasnt really my favorite.

I followed recipe, but added fresh minced garlic to breading and drizzled with evoo instead of melted butter.  I also used a grate pan covered in foil( for easy clean up) and slit the foil for drainage.  topped with extra parm cheese on for presentation.  turned out great, the boyfriend loved it!  Thanks!

500 degrees?  Really?  Next time I make this I'm checking my fish in half the time because the bottoms were burnt.  Otherwise the fish tasted good.  Sade face.

I used panko and fresh thyme, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend loved it. I suggest browning the panko a bit first. Also, as always, while eating, a squeeze of lemon!

Followed recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS!! I used Italian style bread crumbs.  I made a tartar sauce to go with it which was delicious.  Next time I will serve with some fresh lemon wedges to squeeze over fish as well.  Great recipe (and my kids loved it too)!

Made this with tilapia as the haddock at the grocery store didn't look too good. My daughter really liked it, but my husband was not too crazy about it. I think he was looking for more flavour in the coating. Thanks!

I made this in hopes to recreating a healthier "fish n chips" dinner. It worked, but I felt the crust did nothing for me, it was flavorless. I cant imagine eating this plain, I smothered mine in malt vinegar.

We had baked haddock a couple of weeks ago using this recipe.  The first thing anyone said after taking a bite was "Ummm".  It was truly delicious.  I plan to have cod tonight and will use this method for preparing it.

Awesome recipe! I used 1 package of potato flakes instead of bread crumbs, just 'cuz that's what I had around. I also added about 1 and a half tablespoons of onion powder and 1 tablespoon basil to that mix, and put some chopped garlic on top of the filets before throwing them into the oven. Came out perfect, and I'll definitely make it again!

I have been looking for a good baked fish recipe for a long time.  I finally found it!  I didn't add cheese or butter or salt  due to DH's and my dietary restrictions.  I did mix in some Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning in the bread crumbs in one batch that I made.  Turned out great!  I do spray the bottom of the glass dish with a little cooking spray and I have no sticking problems.  Fish has now become a weekly meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

Just awesome! The only thing I did was cut down on the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons.

I placed it on a cooling rack as others suggested and it came out crunchy, not soggy. I followed the recipe otherwise and thought it was bland. I wanted to use egg but I found the bread crumbs stuck just fine with the milk. It was an interesting alternative to making fish however, I doubt its one I'll make again.

My whole family liked this dish.  I used tilapia and cooked for 20 minutes but the fish was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I followed the advice of prior reviewers and baked on a raised rack so both sides browned.

This is a very good recipe.  The only disappointment was the bottom was soggy.  I will try a pan with a rack next time.  If I can solve that one problem this recipe would rate an even higher rating.  Thanks for another keeper

Had a charity Fish and chip dinner for Cancer. Brought home a couple of fillets and tried this recipe. Tha parmesan cheese did the trick. I did a two to one mix for the coating.

Loved it!  My sister and made a few changes though.  We like things spicy, so we used crushed jalapeno & cheddar cornmeal crackers, added cayenne & garlic, and used romano since I didn't parmesan.  Turned out amazing!  Definitely use wire racks in a pan, though as it got a bit soggy. BTW, did the same thing with  chicken breasts which turned out great as we;;/

I sub'd pollock for haddock.  Very bland recipe.  I gave it 2 stars because the cooking process was exceptional.  I took others advice and raised the fish off the bottom of the dish and it cooked perfectly.  The filets were thick and I cooked for 20 min. at 500 and were cooked to perfection.  Not dry at all.

delicious! soaked in milk for a couple of hours before breading. i used panko rather than bread crumbs because i like the taste/texture better. i didn't have plain thyme, so i substituted pampered chef's rosemary and herbs, which worked just fine. i also added a little bit of lemon to the melted butter. baked on a rack as suggested by other reviewers.

I LOVED this recipe! I only had Italian style bread crumbs on hand so I used those! I also forgot to drizzle the butter over the fish but it was very good anyway! I cut the fish into strips so basically made 'Fish Fingers' for my niece and nephew, turned out great! Thanks a lot!

All around a very good recipe.  I took some others suggestions by adding parsley to the bread crumbs and squeezing lemon juice over the fish.  I also made my own bread crumbs by crushing Saltines with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  My husband and I were both pleased with the meal.

Was looking for a healthier alternative to fried fish, and i found it!  Very tasty.  I did place the fish on a rack in the pan to help keep the bottoms from getting soggy.

Fantastic!  I've never really liked fish, other than deep fried in a restaurant.  My boyfriend feels the same.  But we wanted to start eating healthier, and to incorporate fish into our weekly meal plans.  After trying several recipes and types of fish, and throwing them out, we hit upon this.  Winner!  I used Icelandic Cod and otherwise made it exactly as written.  The 500 degree oven temp made the fish 'gently crispy' yet moist and tender inside - perfect.  Other recipes baked at a lower temp left the fish too soggy for me.  I squeezed some fresh lemon on after it was done; next time I might try adding a little lemon to the milk. Even for people who aren't fish fans, give this a try with haddock or cod ... I bet you'll be a convert, like us.

This was okay, but I'm doubtful that it will make a repeat performance on our dinner table.  For the amount of haddock, the other ingredient amounts were overkill and wasteful.  I could have gotten by with half the amount of milk and bread crumb mixture.  The one plus came when I decided to grill instead of bake.  That ensured a nice crunchy coating/crust; sprinkled with a bit of lemon juice added more flavor.  Thank you for letting me try this recipe!

The BEST!  My husband and agree we will use this recipe everytime we make a white-fish.  We used Walleye and cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs and it was YUMMY!!!  Recommend use of a wire rack inside baking pan like other reviewer.   Best ever!

Very nice recipe, we enjoyed it!  I used a mixture of an egg with some milk for my fish and left the salt out.  I added about one teaspoon of fresh thyme since I had some in the fridge and didn't pour melted butter over to bake, just sprayed with a bit of Pam (didn't want the extra fat/calories).  Squeezed fresh lemon juice all over the fish once done, yummy!

This came out quite well.  Did make a few adjustments.... I elevated the fish on a rack in the glass dish, still sprayed the bottom with PAM.  Make sure to shake off excess milk from the fish, since that will make bottom soagy. I used orange roughy instead of haddock. The thyme coating was good, but not fantastic to my liking.

I did what I read on another review and put the fish on cooling racks to keep the bottom from becoming soggy.  They turned out great.  I used Italian bread crumbs and omitted the thyme because of the seasoned bread crumbs.  Much better then deep frying.  Also, the fish I used were bluegill.  Awesome!!

Don't use a rack!!  I rated this 4 because it seems like a potentially good recipe. However, after reading reviews about soggy fish, I decided to try one reviewer's recommendation of placing the fish on a rack, on top of the baking pan.  First, all of the butter dripped to the bottom of the pan, where it would add no flavor to the fish.  I dribbled a little more butter on halfway though cooking. The fish ended up falling though the rack in a soggy mess. Even the top portion was soggy.  The reviewer said theirs came out crispy, but mine was soggy pieces of broken fish. Interestingly, I also cooked some shrimp with the same procedure and it turned out great. I will try this recipe again with a regular baking pan and hope for better results.  Good luck!

Excellent, this has become a staple for me.  My family hated when I made fish because it always broke up--like hash because I was always flipping it.  I don't do that with this and it has lots of flavour,   easy, easy easy.  Love it.

I didn't think I could cook fish, but this recipe looked so friendly.  I got rave reviews!  I don't even like fish, but this was so light, flakey and buttery. It was delicious and so easy to make!  My dad said, "Boy, you sure know how to cook a fish!" That was awesome to hear. My boyfriend said, "When are we having that fish you made again?" I love cooking for an appreciative audience and this recipe made me look like a great chef!  Thank you for a great recipe.  It's a staple in my dinner rotation now.

Excellent!  The only things I added were - a good dash of old bay seasoning with bread crumbs and a squeeze of lemon in with the melted butter before drizzling.  Husband and two teenagers loved it.

This was good but my fish did not crisp the way that I expected it to do. I used rack method. Added some old bay as seasoning. Used milk and egg mixture and fresh breadcrumbs. Would make again.

This was SO easy!  I've used bread crumb/parm mixture on sliced chicken breast, but never thought to use on fish.  The thyme added a nice touch.  The baking time was spot on for a moist flaky filet. I served with steamed broccoli, cole slaw, and a slice of fresh rye bread.

This was very boring. I didn't dislike it, but it was nothing special. My local market did not have haddock, so I used tilapia. I probably would not make this again.

Amazing!  Simple yet delicious.  The flavor is so good that noone asked for  lemon or tartar sauce... a first in this household.  This is now my favorite fish recipe.  Thank you!

My family LOVES this recipe. I never seem to make enough. Make sure to put the fish on a wire rack inside of your pan, otherwise the bottoms get soggy. The fish is always flaky. This recipe is part of our "regulars" Thanks a bunch for sharing it.

i was so happy with this recipe. i made it because i had no eggs to do a batter. it looked so simple i thought it would be terrible! the high heat gives it a nice crunch! i used cod and some thin chicken fillets! superb!
