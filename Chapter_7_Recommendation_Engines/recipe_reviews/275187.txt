These really are quick and easy, and my doggos love em! I do think 2 cups of whole wheat flour is too much though. I was unable to get the mixture to come together because it was too dry and crumbly--added a bit of water and that fixed the problem, but I would probably only use 1 cup next time. I made the first batch into dog bone shapes, and while it looked cute, the mixture was a touch too sticky to cut easily--so I made the rest of them into small round cookies. I ended up getting 49 decent sized cookies for my dogs (who are rather large) so keep that in mind depending on how big your dogs are, caz you might want to make them even smaller. They also needed to bake for about 18-22 minutes. Overall, the "judges" were very happy with these, so looks like we'll be making them again!
