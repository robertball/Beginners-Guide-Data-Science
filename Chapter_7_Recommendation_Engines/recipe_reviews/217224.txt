Great drink, I first had this drink at a bar on a recommendation. I've been looking for decent recipe ever since. Comparing different takes. most had equal part rye/bourbon, Benedictine and Sweet Vermouth with a couple dashes of Peychauds. But most others add a small part Absinthe or Substitute like Herbsaint or other Pastis liquor.
