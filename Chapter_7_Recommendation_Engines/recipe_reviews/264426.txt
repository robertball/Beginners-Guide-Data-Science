This is a really good basic crust-less quiche recipe. I started by looking for a quiche recipe that included cherry tomatoes because I had some I wanted to use up. I ended up adding more of everything because of the size pie plate I had, and it came out beautifully. I will be using it as my core quiche recipe from now on.
