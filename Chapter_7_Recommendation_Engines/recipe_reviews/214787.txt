First, a disclaimer: I'm gaga for rosemary. So much so, that I misread the recipe and added rosemary both to the butter as well as the steak. But not to worry: it's one tasty dish.

I used T-Bone, rather than Porterhouse, because that's what they had at the market. I overcooked it a bit but even at that, this is a lovely way to BBQ steak. The papaya adds a subtle, but definitely wonderful, flavor to the mix. This is one of those home-run recipes that you might expect to get at a restaurant. In other words, exquisite.

A comment about grilling the papaya: I simply cut half a papaya into four long slices (about 1" thick/slice). Even after coating the grill with oil, the papaya wound up sticking a bit. So keep your eye on it. But don't leave it out! It's the real hero of this recipe... although my beloved rosemary surely carries its weight.

The steaks were awesome, but I wasn't crazy about the papaya butter, especially in combination with the meat. This recipe also made WAY too much butter, easily enough for twice as many steaks, probably more.

My wife liked it but my son did not. He discovered he doesn't like papaya.
