This is an excellent recipe.  These sweet potatoes are delicious! I have made them several times now.   I was nervous initially about making them after reading the varying reviews here - some saying too sweet, some saying not sweet enough, too much nutmeg, etc.  I think the trick is (and the beauty of this recipe)to mix up the potatoes with the butter then add half of the sugar, nutmeg and orange juice called for.  Then taste it.  Then add up to the second half to correct it to your taste.    The other great thing about this recipe is that I always make it the day before.  I cover it and refrigerate it in the serving dish without the marshmallows.  I reheat it on the day I need it then add the marshmallows and toast them under the broiler.

Delicious!

This was an excellent treat.  I even shortcutted using "Bruce's" canned sweet potatoes!  Ideal for anyone on the go.

This is a very very good traditional casserole, but because sweet potatoes vary greatly in size, mine ended up under-spiced because they were huge, so watch out and  make sure your potatoes are spicy enough. It was still tasty. This is the perfect recipe for a traditional casserole. 

However, I think if you combine it with the "Eggless Sweet Potato Casserole" recipe, it becomes something that is the ultimate sweet potato dish. I used the technique of whipping the potatoes (genius!). I don't think it matters too much which spice scheme you use as long as there is enough spice (The eggless recipe results in sweeter sweet potatoes). I then made the pecan topping from the other recipe and added it to the top. I cooked it according to the other directions for a while ( because the pecan topping takes time to cook, then I added marshmellows like this recipe has, and it was perfect for my tastes. When I comined the two recipes, it turned out a lot like Boston Market sweet potato casserole.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic! Everyone loved it. Only comment was that I made it a day in advance and then went to bake it for 10 minutes before serving with marshmallows on top. That was wrong because it was cold from the refrigerator and threw off the heating. What would have been better is to have left off marshmallows, warm up first, then add them for 10 more minutes. They just got a little darker, and almost burnt, since I had to leave it longer to heat up. But it was still delicious, and some people said they liked the over-cooked version better anyway. Still 5 star receipe for sure!

Yum! Delicious without being too sweet like traditional sweet potato casseroles. The OJ was perfect. Just a tip on "peeling" potatoes...cut potato in half, boil for 20 minutes then squeeze potato out of skin, magic!

My husband hates sweet potatoes and only tried these to make me happy....then went back for seconds!  Added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and upped the nutmeg to a teaspoon as well.  Topped with brown sugar, melted butter, and pecans and then baked for 30 minutes.  Topped with marshmallows and baked till golden.

These were wonderful. I made these as a side to the Tangy Honey glazed ham, and they were a wonderful accompaniment. The hint of orange juice complimented the tangy flavor of the ham. I usually use maple syrup to sweeten yams, but I think this combo of OJ and brown sugar is better. I will make these whenever I make whipped sweet potatoes from now on.

I did not like this recipe at all!  Maybe it was the nutmeg, or all the added sugar, it was way too sweet!  I don't recommend it, but others may like it.  I guess you don't know until you try.

One of my husband's favorite holiday dishes. Sometimes I even make it for him "just because"  I add 1 egg to mine, it makes it very fluffy.  I also mix about 1 cup of marshmallows with the sweet potatoes, bake, and then add the topping and brown.  When I take this to pot luck lunches or dinners, the dish comes back clean!

THIS WAS SO GOOD. I didn't have any orange juice, so I used the zest of 1 large orange. It added extra flavor! I didn't put marshmallows on top either, I put about 3/4 cup of pecans that had been soaking in maple syrup for 8 hours. Yummm.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Of the mounds of food I prepared, this was the lone dish with NO leftovers. It was completely gone! I thought it was quite good and added a little vanilla, as was suggested by some of the reviews. To cook the potatoes, I baked them for about an hour and then scooped out the skins and this worked well. My one complaint is that the orange juice came across a little strong for my taste. I used fresh squeezed and it was a bit too obvious a flavor in the mix.

not sure if I like all the marshmellows on the top, make sure not to put to much orange juice in it, it changes the flavor.

Great recipe!  I made it with canned sweet potatoes.  Thought I made too much (used 3- 40 oz cans)and we would be eating leftovers forever after Thanksgiving.  But everyone wanted to take home the leftovers!  They loved it!  So quick and easy. It was like a yummy dessert.  Will absolutely make again.  Thank you.

I added a dash of cayenne pepper that give it a little extra kick to make it a huge hit at dinner.

This dish was an instant family favorite.  It was very light in texture and not too sweet compared to most typical southern sweet potato casseroles that we are used to.  As another reviewer suggested: taste it as you go.  Add only half the sugar, oj and nutmeg. I did this helpful hint (thanks MomTo6) and found I liked the recipe as written but I felt the need to add a little cinnamon.  We love spices so the cinnamon and nutmeg were a hit in this dish.  We will make this every year. Thank you for the recipe Bea!

This recipe was simple and delicious! I added in 1 tbsp of vanilla extract and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the recipe also. YUMM!I want nuts with the marshmallows on top as well-my family was all skeptical to eat sweet potatoes....NOW they love them! :)

I have made this same recipe....on Thanksgiving I kick it up a notch and hollow out orange halves (looks like a cup) and use as the vessel to bake and serve it in. Real festive and the orange adds even more citrus kick! Enjoy

Pretty good, but too sweet even for my tastes.  Next time I'll scale back the brown sugar, probably to 1/3 cup or so.

The only reason I gave this 3 stars and not 5 is because I thought the marshmallows made this WAY too sweet. I would cut them out next time, and I think the dish would be more pleasing to my family. I never dreamed that my two boys and husband (who has a serious sweet tooth) would say that this dish was too sweet for them to finish!

I don't like sweet potatoes in general, so I am somewhat biased in my review. However, I have tried one or two recipes in the past that I have really liked - plus my husband likes sweet potatoes, so I gave this recipe a try.  Somehow it didn't turn out how I expected.  Husband thought it was OK, and I didn't care for it much.  Texture was not right and I thought it too sweet.  I will not make again.

This was very good - my kids even liked it!  They preferred it w/o the marshmallows, but I liked them.  I saved time by microwaving the sweet potatoes and it still came out great.

This is a very good recipe. A nice change from the really sweet, sweet potato recipes. I did cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was perfect!

This recipe needs salt. There has to be enough salt to bring out the flavor and temper the sweetness a bit. I kept adding pinches of salt to the whipped mixture until it tasted right (for me). I ended up using about 1 teaspoon, but your mileage may vary. With the added salt, this recipe was excellent, and I didn't change anything else.

It was good - I put in too much orange juice though.  A little orange juice goes a long way in this recipe.  I used big marshmallows cut in half, and they didn't work well.  It's best to use the mini marshmallows.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is almost my grandmother's recipe. I don't add the butter or nutmeg. We do serve them in orange halves and this makes for an elegant presentation. Look for thick skinned oranges, Scoop out the orange pulp with a teaspoon, save for the juice I use most of it in the mix. I bake the sweet potatoes in the microwave. scoop out, mix as noted above to taste, scoop mix into halves and cook in halves at 350 for 15-20minutes, top with marshmallows (Grandma said three for adults and cover for the kids) cook for another 5-10 minutes until the marshmallow are lightly toasted. About 2 med oranges per 1# fresh uncooked sweet potatoes. Folks always rave!

This is the dish my kids request every year for thanksgiving. I back off on the sugar a little sometimes since there are marshmallows, but always add a 1/4 stick of butter to help the flavor, otherwise it tastes a little too sickening sweet. And if you're not getting much fat from other places in your meal, the butter fat helps you absorb all that great Vitamin A in the sweet potato! I use canned sweet potatoes if I'm short on time, which does add sugar to the dish, so back off on sugar if using canned!

Delicious! Never thought of using O.J. before. Yum! I also added ginger and cinnamon, I like a lot of spice in my sweet potatoes. Also cut down on the amount of sugar called for. Really delicious, once you add the spices and reduce the sugar. Thanks!

I am not a sweet potato fan, but I made this for my family who loves sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving and it was a major hit. I even liked them... and like I said.. I don't generally like sweet potatoes. This is definitely on the traditional Thanksgiving meal menu!!!

Nice easy recipe; great that you can make it in advance!  Instead of marshmallows we used the pecan topping from the 'eggless sweet potato casserole' recipe and it was loved by my family.  My aunt insisted I show her how to make it. :)

This recipe was very easy to follow and turned out perfectly. These potatoes can be made ahead of time, frozen, and baked on the day you need it, adding the marshmallows at the last few minutes. Very good! I don't even like sweet potatoes and thought they were good.

I made this for a small Christmas dinner.  Everyone ate it but also commented on how sweet it was.  My husband liked it but said he was suprised others continued to eat it because it was sooo sweet.  Also I am a new wife and new to cooking and I bought 'sweet potatoes'  I think I possibly should have gotten 'yams.'

Yum!  I made this recipe for two as an after dinner treat. Instead of marshmellows (watching my waistline) I ground up a  1/3 cup mix of peanuts: macadamea, pecan, almond and mixed in just a little bit of honey.  It gave it a nice crunchy texture and the honey gave it a different kind of sweetness that was not too sweet.  I also mixed cinnamon in and didn't use as much nutmeg.  Great easy recipe!

Very good recipe. I made it for thanksgiving and it was wonderful. My son really liked it. It was a nice change from the sweet potato casserole recipe that is really sweet with a heavy crunchy topping.

This is a fabulous recipe, it is so good and such an easy item to make. I also used the canned sweet potatoes, instead of boiling them in salted water, i used 3/4 of the juice from 1 of the cans. This is a big hit in our family!

So easy and so good. I made exactly as recipes called for except I used the big marshmellows, this was fine except that my husband was a little too excited and added too many! I would make this again for the holidays.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit. I used ramekins instead of a casserole dish and filled each ramekin 1/2 full and made seven ramekins. They are rich and sweet so the size was perfect. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 and it was plenty. The marshmallows melted into almost nothing, so don't overcook and you can add extra marshmallows. Yum!

I used a little less brown sugar and added some rum-soaked raisins to vary the texture. It was a treat and everyone asked for it at the next family dinner.

Great recipe!  I wrapped the sweet potatoes in foil and baked them alongside the roast I was cooking then peeled and mashed them when they were done.  A quick and easy side dish that got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  One theing, I did have to put in more brown sugar than the recipe called for because my husband likes them really sweet.

I doubled this recipe and served it at Thanksgiving and it was a great substitute for the standard candied yams.  I altered the recipe to suit my diabetic father-in-law by omitting the marshmallows, replacing most of the brown sugar with Splenda, and adding a dash of orange zest.  The flavor of the sweet potato was really prevalent and the touch of orange made it so much more interesting.

After making a traditional sweet potato bake for Thanksgiving with cinnamon spice, I saw this and thought I would give it a try since it had different flavor elements. I used the juice of a whole orange which totally brightened it up. It was so good! Taking a bite with the marshmallow made it taste exactly like a creamsicle. I will definitely be making this again!

My family did not enjoy the smooth texture of the mashed sweet potatoes. If I would have used a hand masher, I think it would have been more to their liking. I used half the amount of brown sugar called for in the recipe and think I could have used even less. I also added 1/2 tsp. Of cinnamon along with the nutmeg. ( I had doubled the number of sweet potatoes)

I happened to have some Kosher marshmallows in the house, so I thought why not try a new sweet potato casserole recipe. I cut the sugar by half and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I put in 5 ramekins ( inspired by the posted picture). I didn't measure the marshmallows, just used as much as needed to cover the sweet potato mixture. It took about 15 minutes for it to bake to golden brown. It was delicious but I felt it needed some salt. I will add 1/4 teaspoon of it next time.

My husbands family has been making sweet potatoes out of the can with a stick of butter and cup of sugar for years. It is super sweet and most of my family isn't a fan so this year decided to try a mashed version with a little less sugar to potato ratio and healthier fresh potatoes. I am super glad we did. The texture is much better and the sweet balances nicely. We did use 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and thought it was just right but and 1/8 would be plenty. Will be our go to recipe from now on. it also doesn't need the marshmallows if you are wanting to cut some of the sweet or could even use less brown sugar. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Just finished making this, and yeah it's pretty delicious.  I didn't use the brown sugar, marshmallow or nutmeg and used yams as opposed to sweet potatoes.  Here's what I did:

I finely chopped about 20 dates in the food processor, for sweetness.  I added the yams, sprinkling with cinnamon as it pureed, then the butter, pre-melted, a dash of salt and the orange juice. Smoothed into the casserole dish, then prepared my topping.

In a bowl I added approximately 2 tablespoons of melted butter to about 1/2 cup of labne (Middle Eastern yogurt which I use as a substitute for cream cheese, sour cream, and more).  Mixed in a splash of vanilla, about 2 teaspoons of sugar, whipped it up by hand, then smoothed over the sweet potatoes.

The finishing touch:  A handful of pecans and one date finely chopped together in the food processor, then sprinkled over the casserole.  Bake according to directions.

Usually tasting as you go is a good way to avoid anything funky.  Trust your gut!

Fabulous! The orange juice is a wonderful addition. My daughter made a crunchy pecan topping which added a bit of yummy crunch.

Fantastic - swapped the marshmallow topping for a mix of 2 tbsp melted butter, some crushed Total cereal and a little brown sugar.  Even my non-sweet potato eating husband liked them!

I upped the recipe to make for 20 and used canned to save me from peeling 8 lbs of sweet potatoes.  Loved it!  Would like to try cinnamon in it and a few nuts.  I think this is good as it's written as well as being a great base to add according to your own taste.

My family loved this version of sweet potato casserole. Not as sweet as some candied yams. I added a dash of cinnamon too. I put the potatoes into individual oven proof bowls which went over well.

Really didn't care for this at all. Maybe I just don't like sweet potatoes? I don't even know. And my marshmallows were crispy too.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit, with my family and my husbands!  I doubled the recipe, stuck one in the fridge to take to the in-laws and brought the other over to my family.  When we arrived at my in-laws, I just popped it in the oven for about 10 minutes without the marshmallows to warm it up, then added the mallows and cooked until they were golden.  The only alteration I made was adding pecans.  I did half marshmallows and half pecans on the one for my family, however, I layered the marshmallows on top of the peacans on the other.  I preferred the latter, and found that my family would have preferred it that way as well.  A delicious holiday dish either way!

Will make again!  I think I will mash the potatoes next time instead of whipping them, I like the added texture.  Tossed in a few pecans on top for flavor.

Very very sweet! Think about it. Sweet potato is already sweet, plus loads of brown sugar and marshmellows. It is delicious, so whether you have a sweet tooth or not, use your discretion. It was creamy and very to my liking. The family enjoyed it, and my father thought it was like ice cream (just hot).

Very good recipe.  Everyone loved the whipped sweet potatoes better than unwhipped.  The flavor was good and not too sweet. Good with the nutmeg and I added a little cinnamon as well.

One of my fav. dishes for Thanksgiving.
It was great. I ended up using half yams and half sweet potatoes, added more b. sugar, and freshly squeezed oranges for the juice--it was just sooo good.

I've never made sweet potato anything and this was very easy and tasted good.  My husband loved it.  He suggested no nutmeg as the little amount seemed too much.  The marshmallows were a nice touch.

Yum!  I had to substitute yams for sweet potato and it still came out great.  Was very happy to find a casserole recipe w/o eggs (due to allergies).  My 15-serving version was a big hit.  Thanks Bea.

I increased the recipe to feed 12 & I liked the idea of individual servings so well that I copied allrecipes. ;o) I used large ramekins for the adults & small ramekins for teh kids & then served them on antique china dessert plates. I didn't fill them all the way up so I could really load on the marshmallows. I also sprinkled some chopped walnuts on before topping w/ the marshmallows. These tasted great & looked even better. Thanks!

Pretty good recipe. I only put 1/8 tsp of nutmeg but it was really strong. Im not a huge fan of nutmeg so next time I might omit it. I also added 3 tablespoons of butter instead of 2 to make it smoother.

maybe i did something wrong.  mine did not turn out fluffy, but instead was a bit runny and clumpy.  i was looking for something with the consistency of mashed potatoes.  since this was my first time ever making sweet potatoes, maybe my expectations were wrong.  i thought it could use a lot more spices as well.  did not go over well at christmas dinner.

Very good and creamy. Had just the right amount of sweetness and spices, the kids really did love it! It was a big hit with everyone!

My fiance loved it!  My daughter and I tried it, but we're not really fond of sweet potatos.  But I'd definitely make it again for him!

Still not what I was looking for.  Not quite as fluffy as I'd like but still pretty good, verryyyyy  sweet.

A family favorite, always requested for Thanksgiving and holiday dinners now.  I personally do not even like sweet potatoes, and I will eat it!

Oh this was awesome, I loved the sweet potatos rather than yams, a little milder.
