These were excellent! I think the amount of green onion is a bit much. 2 would be plenty. The chipotle powder gives this quite a kick. My only change is that for the spread I blended guacamole with sour cream so that there would be more flavor. Again, these were excellent and I bet it would be good would ground chicken and ground beef too.
