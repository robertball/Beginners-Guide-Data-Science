I used all the ingredients listed, but the preparation sounded way too over-complicated for a simple soup.  I made everything in one pot - cooked the carrots with the potatoes after adding 4 cups of chicken broth (because I was out of vegetable stock) to the sauteed veggies.  Then I used an immersion blender just enough to thicken it while still leaving some small chunks of potatoes and carrot pieces.  Stirred in the cream last and garnished with a little cheddar and crumbled bacon.

This was delish! The only thing I can think of suggesting is step #5, I would have put that whole batch in that step back into the pot as is, with dividing and pureeing. There were a few chunks here and there, I could have used a little more with this recipe. But the flavor was over all wonderful. It was creamy (with or without the heavy cream) My family thoroughly enjoyed this very very much. TY

This tastes like liquid baked potatoes in the best way. My 7 year old declared it the tastiest thing she's ever eaten. High praise, trust me!
I left off the cheddar cheese and used chicken stock instead of vegetable, because that's what I had in the cupboard. Next time, I'll try it with the vegetable stock.

I liked cooking this soup. However the puree procedure is WAY too complicated and long for me. I put the carrots and the potatoes in at the same time and cooked it. Then I pureed the whole soup. I serve this to my 4.5 yr old and my 11 month old sons so we do not need texture! I used an immersion blender to puree it.

While I find dishes that are not spicy bland, the people I served loved this soup. It is now on our family menu. The puree carries a good flavor, is not too heavily or exclusively potato, and keeping some solids in for the final product give it the substance of a meal instead of an appetizer.

This soup is such a delicious comfort food that my family craves and I have to make it at least twice a month no matter what the season is.  I've made it with both vegetable stock and chicken stock, and they're both good, although I slightly prefer using chicken stock.  I double the yellow onion and celery to get more daily veggies in our diet.  To save time, I don't remove any from the pot to puree in a blender.  Instead, I use a hand blender to puree it while all of the soup is in the pot just long enough to puree it to make it look creamy and so that some potato chunks are left rather than pureeing until it is completely smooth, because we like to have some chunks of potatoes.  Also, I start cooking the sliced baby carrots in a separate pot in some vegetable or chicken stock at the same time that I start cooking the onions, leeks and garlic in the big pot so that the carrots can cook long enough to get very soft before I add them to the pot after I've used the hand blender.  I've also substituted half and half for the heavy cream and it was just as good while saving some fat and calories.  One time, I didn't have any half and half or cream on hand, so I just served it without either and it was still good since pureeing it makes it very creamy looking and tasting.  However, we prefer to have at least some half and half added.  I think the leeks are what makes this soup so delicious.  My kids love it, and it's a great way for them to get their vegetables in a healthy soup!

Phenomenal! I had to make some substitutions based on what I had but but the general flavor was the same. I used coconut oil as my cooking oil, chicken stock instead of vegetable, and threw in a few turnips I had. I also used milk instead of cream. Everything else remained the same. I will definately keep this in rotation in my kitchen.

Five stars! And I don't take those lightly. I use more carrots and fewer potatoes, and I add a couple dashes of truffle oil.

What a nice way to warm up on a cold day!  We loved this soup! I reduced the amount of butter and substituted EVOO instead and at the end, when it was time to puree it, I just used my immersion blender because it was just so much more effective that way.   Such a good soup!  I shredded up some Irish chees to sprinkle on top. It was creamy, silky, and full of flavor.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will be making this again for sure.

This soup is flavourful, delicious and hearty and it was easy to make with food that I already had in my fridge and pantry. I did however have to substitute the veggie stock for a beef stock and I used homo milk instead of cream as that was all that I had but it still tastes great and makes a great soup for a cold day.

Used chicken stock and a dash of half and half instead of heavy cream and a blended with a hand mixer. It was a really easy recipe that produced a creamy, satisfying soup.

So good. I kept the ingredients the same, except for using half and half instead of the cream. But as other cooks did, I simplified the directions. I added the carrots with the potatoes and cooked everything for about 30 minutes. Then, I ladled about 2 cups of pieces of carrots and potatoes out of the pot. I put them aside and used immersion blender to blend the rest of the soup. I put back the pieces of carrots and potatoes in the pot, added half and half and heated up the soup for 5 minutes.

This. Was. Awesome! I am lazy (and still have all my teeth!), so didn't puree any of it. This will be made again, and again, and...well, you get the drift!

This was very hearty! And excellent veggie soup for winter. 

I used 5 small-to-meduim red potatoes and one medium turnip. I left out the celery, too (because I don't like celery.)I also forgot to add the cream later, but didn't really notice its absense. Like everyone else, I found the blending instructions cumbersome. I ended up pureeing two thirds of the soup and then mixing it back together again.

I love this soup.  I made it, then froze it in 1 1/2 cup servings for my daughter who had throat surgery.  I also add 4 more cups of broth, and 2 cups of lentils with the potatoes to give the soup an added protein boost.

A delicious thick soup from following the recipe. I agree that the 3 batches in the blender is time-consuming and will try an immersion blender next time. I substituted frozen green peas for the celery!!

First off I encourage everyone to try this recipe. I've been making this soup for a year now. It's our family's favorite soup. I made it for my sister in law and she left with a copy of the recipe as did my nephew. He took 1 spoonful and asked for the recipe.  I like the fact that is uses Vegetable stock. I'm trying to cut down on meat and salt. I had some homemade vegetable stock in  the freezer. Also I don't eat white potatoes so I chose to use cauliflower in place of the potatoes. (I continue to use cauliflower) I made this recipe as easy as possible not following exact recipe. I did use my Vita-mix to puree all but 2 cups of the soup. We loved it. My husband and MIL who are heavy handed with the salt never even touch the salt shaker. This is a wonderful soup. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I love this soup and I will make more of it. Mise en place is important in this recipe so make sure you chop everything up prior to creating the soup. I will definitely make this again very soon (like tonight).

This recipe was really excellent. I used a celery root instead of regular celery, and I used an immersion blender which made blending it much easier.  Will be making this recipe again!

My family seriously loves this soup!  I usually make a modified version due to budget and what my family likes.  I usually only do 2-4 cloves of garlic depending on the quantity I am making.  I also never put in green onions and always leave a potato or two out, again depending on how much I'm making.   The thing I think makes the biggest difference is the amount of cheese.  We love cheese!  so honestly I shred almost a whole block of cheese to add, it makes it so rich and creamy.  Even my co-workers ask for me to bring them the leftovers.

So much better than I thought it would be. I had some leftover leeks and was looking for something to do with them. I cooked it in the pressure cooker, sautéed the leeks and onions in the butter (next time I will use less butter, I think 2 tablespoons would be enough). Then I added everything else and cooked it on high pressure for 18 minutes. Then like another reviewer said I used the immersion blender and left a few chunks. So easy. I also didn’t peel my potatoes just cut them up. I didn’t have any cream so I just left it out, sometime when I have cream I will add it because I’m definitely making this again. Also added some herbs de provience to taste.

This was a fabulous recipe. I'll definitely make it again! I only added more garlic because I do that to every recipe ha ha!....but I think it made it even better!  I also only purreed about half the soup because I like a chunkier soup and I used light cream to save a little on calories. Still amazing! Making another batch tomorrow to freeze on those winter nights that I don't have time to cook. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this soup, hoping for a great Irish soup like the soups I had in Ireland.  I was disappointed.  It was okay, but not great.  It's really heavy in the dairy, and just too rich.  I used less heavy cream than what it called for, but I would go with even less next time.  Not sure I will make it again.  I will try other Irish vegetable soup recipes on this site.

Great soup for the whole family! I went ahead and bought an inexpensive immersion blender to make this and it was worth not having to do this extra steps. I also put the carrots in at the same time as the potatoes. We will have this again!

So delicious; pleased everyone in the family (including four kids)!  The only changes I made were to use an immersion blender (I love it - so much easier than a full blender) and used light cream.  I'll be making it often in the future!

It's very good, but as another reviewer said it tastes like "liquid baked potatoes" so I  wondered where all those garlic cloves and leeks went to anyway?

Thanks for the recipe - this soup was good and easily modified to suit what you have on hand. I used chicken broth, plus also a turnip. I also cooked all the veggies together including the carrot at the same time, then pureed most of the soup at the end but left a few chunks of veggies in it. I also used a lighter cream as that is what I had. Its a nice thick soup, and I think it would be great as a base for a chowder as well. You could easily add more chopped cooked veggies or seafood to this soup, and add any seasonings to suit your tastes. I am going to try to freeze a bit of it and see how that works.

I made this on St. Patrick's day, it was fantastic!  Made it just as prescribed.  The longest part was pureeing the soup. Everyone loved it. Will definitely keep this recipe handy on cold days when something hot and nutritious is called on.

This soup was yummy! It reminded me of the soups we were served in Irish pubs on our vacation. While onion, leeks, garlic and celery were sautéing in stock pot- I cut up potatoes and carrots, put them in microwave safe bowl and placed them on baked potato setting. I added chicken broth to stock pot, then the potato/carrots from microwave which were now cooked, 2 chicken bullion cubes (dissolved), some pepper and some McCormicks Perfect Pinch Vegetable seasoning(love it for soup). Added the cream and use immersion blender to blend. Topped with a little shredded cheese. Great comfort food!

This soup is incredible.  The flavors were rich and deep and complex and we just loved it!  This will certainly be a family winter recipe for years to come.

I have made this twice and my boyfriend and I love it!I agree with other reviews --  I don't think the heavy cream is not needed. It is thick and delicious without it (and saves you a few calories).

This was delicious!  My husband is not a huge fan of white potatoes so I substituted one large sweet potato for two of the white potatoes.  It turned out very well and the whole family enjoyed it.
