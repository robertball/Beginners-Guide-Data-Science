I followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken came out very moist, however the gravy/sauce was solid in the bottom of the pan.  Was not able to spoon it over the chicken as I served it.  Not sure what I did wrong.

This was pretty good.  Instead of using corn starch, I made a roux in the same pan I fried the chicken in, I also used regular milk.  So I basically made a cream sauce, then added the parm cheese.  I didn't add the sauce until the last 10 minutes of cooking in the oven.

The family liked this one except the sauce was unappealing to my son.  It looked curdled and jelly like, and he's got a thing about texture when he eats.  Hubby said it tasted really good but had to admit the curdled look was a bit off putting.  Followed recipe to a T so not for sure why sauce looked as it did.  My family is a visual kind of brood so something looking appetizing is a must! Won't make this one again but gave it three stars for ease of making and taste.

I made this tonight using 3 chicken breasts.  We like "saucy" recipes because baked chicken can be a little dry, so I used the entire can of FF evaporated milk and increased the parmesan cheese.  This tasted like a chicken cutlet with incredible gravy.  This recipe uses a few pots, pans and bowls but definitely worth it.  Paired this recipe with the herbed noodles (from this site).  I'm so glad I made the extra sauce to put over the bland noodles.  This will be made again and again in our house!

This was a hit with the family.  I didnâ€™t have evaporated milk so I used some heavy cream (1/2 cup) and regular milk for the remaining amount.  There is no way you can brown all of that chicken in 2 tsp of oil so I kept adding more to the pan.  Also it took way longer to bake than 25 minutes.  I had to keep it in the oven for 50 minutes before it hit 160.  It was still moist but the baking time is understated.
