Delicious, but a lot of work. Phyllo dough isn't real easy to work with. It takes a lot of time. I put the extra phyllo sheets, crumpled, on top.

The Italian version of spanakopita. I only used 8 phyllo sheets and added mushrooms and garlic and omitted the egg yolks.  Yummy! 6 servings is too large a piece as a side dish. 1/8 worked perfectly.

This had a very good flavor, made it according to directions except did not add the egg yolks on top and didn't feel it needed them.  I used between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp salt. Watch the video as it's helpful for dealing with the phyllo dough.  I don't think I will make this in pie form but maybe as small tartlets to use as finger appetizers because it is hard to cut through the bottom phyllo with a fork.

This was very good.  I did not use the yolks.  I've made it twice, and it was a big hit each time.  First in the pie form as described here,  then as phyllo tartlet filling (sold in grocery freezer section , cooked as per package)

My church group enjoyed it very much. However I thought it was a lot of work especially since I had never worked with phillo before. Also still have all the leftover egg whites!,
