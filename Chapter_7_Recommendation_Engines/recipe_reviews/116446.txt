My family enjoyed this dressing very much.  However, we felt like something was missing.  Next time I will add some green bell pepper and more black pepper - that may just be a southern thing though.

This was so tasty, almost exactly the way we have alwasy prepared dressing.  I am so not a fan of that store bought stuffing and this will be a wonderful little twist on our old dressing for Thanksgiving...Thanks.

This is a wonderful "base" recipe.  I used 5 cups of cornbread and then added 4 cups of fresh cubed walnut honey wheat bread.  I also sauteed 3/4 shredded carrots with the sweet onion and celery (also used the green tops).   For those that do not like pecans (mostly the children), I left those and the green onions out of the recipe.  Add additional chicken broth as the dressing cooks (if needed)

This recipe was pretty good. If I make it again instead of pecans I'm going to add almond slivers and also a little bell pepper. I was hoping it would be a little bit more like my grandmother's home made dressing, but it was still pretty good regardless.
