Wow! Great way to perk up a regular 'ol burger! My husband is a huge fan of bacon and I adore blue cheese so this combination for a burger topper was a must try and it definitely didn't disappoint.  Very easy to do and perfect over grilled burgers and I'm sure would be just as good on grilled chicken sandwiches too. I can't wait to try it as a dip for crackers and veggies! Thanks for a great recipe Christina!

Most definitely a 5+ star.  The first time I made this I did so 3 different ways.  We had company and I'm the only one who eats Bleu Cheese.  I made 1 full batch with Bleu Cheese, I made another full batch with Feta cheese and the third batch (recipe scaled down to 1 serving) with shredded Cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved their hamburgers with this topping.  What to do with the leftover Bleu Cheese topping?  Later in the week I spread the leftover Bleu Cheese mixture on the leftover hamburger buns and popped them under the broiler.  It melted up so nicely and got a golden brown color.  My BC hating husband thought the bread was delicious.  I didn't tell him what he was eating!  This recipe is so delicious Christina, I've given the recipe out a few times.  It will be made again and again and again in this house.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good but I had a hard time getting past the not so appetizing grey-ish appearance. I probably won't make this again since to me it was just so so. My husband liked it and gave it four stars. Nothing wrong with the recipe just not for me.

It's easier to cut/dice the bacon before cooking.  Then cook bacon in a saucepan, drain well.  - When making anything with blue cheese the result is always better when you buy a good blue cheese.  Lately I've ran across a few  blue cheese's I was disappointed in on taste.

I didn't exactly follow this recipe, but used it as a baseline. I didn't measure anything, just mixed mayo, blue cheese, bacon, onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and liquid smoke to taste.

Way more than 5 stars from me! LOVED this! OMG...so indulgent. I even eliminated my burger bun so I could enjoy this amazing topping with a tad less guilt. Made this the day before serving, and followed recipe exactely. Do not change a thing. Creamy, salty, tangy....just Delicious! Thanks Christina!!!

This was okay. I think that next time I will try adding a little diced sun-dried tomatoes though. Also, if you have left-overs make sure that you take it out of the fridge well in advance of serving... I didn't do this and figured that I'd microwave it for 20 seconds in order to "soften it up" enough to spread. Essentially, that ruined it. If I do this again, I'll make sure that I don't have left-overs. :)

This is so good on burgers, but it would also be great on a steak, chicken, pork chops, or as a dip! I did add 1 extra slice of bacon, and that was the only change I made! My hat is off to you on this one Christina, great recipe!

Oh wow...was this ever good. I followed the recipe exactly and  made it a good three hours before we grilled our burgers to give it time for the flavors to meld together. This was as good as it sounds...so don't think about it...just make it...you won't be sorry. Thanks Christina...from me, my husband, and from my son, that said, "This stuff is the bomb"! I think that means it is good. :)

Wow, this got rave reviews from the entire family. Very tasty and it also would be great on a baked potato or as a dip. The only thing I changed was to saute the onion and garlic in the bacon drippings instead of olive oil. Definitely will make this again but will have to make more of it. In fact, everyone wanted to just eat it with a spoon!!!

I absolutely loved this.  Fantastic as a burger topping!  I think this would be excellent on chicken sandwiches too!  Also as a topping for steak.  Christina named this perfectly, Ultimate Burger Topping! The only change was I accidentally grabbed one extra slice of bacon out of the package and microwaved it instead of fried.  Highly reccommend this recipe!

This is so delicious!!!  My husband and I could not get enough of it.  It tastes like something you would get at a restaurant.  We ate it on burgers and we ate the leftovers as dip on crackers.  Super good - will definitely make this A LOT!!

Wow oh wow!!
I made this for my family because the ingredients sound so good and I was so right! It was a HUGE hit! I followed the directions to a T and it was amazing. I took other reviewers advice and chopped up the bacon before hand. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for submitting!

This is fabulous.  I sprinkle the bacon over the top of the blue cheese mixture and serve without a bun.  Tonight I am going to try it over salmon.

This topping was a big hit with my family.  I omitted the olive oil as I didn't think it was necessary.  I made half with blue cheese which my husband and I enjoyed.  The other half I substituted with cheddar cheese which my kids preferred.  Delicious either way!

I have to admit this does not look like something I would normally put in my mouth. However I definitely will be making this stuff again. It is so good! I have never been one to follow a recipe exactly. If you are a blue cheese fan don’t change a thing this recipe is perfect. If you are not a blue cheese fan like myself I used feta and added more pepper seasoning to make up for the bite I lost from not using blue cheese. I’m pretty impressed with it

It is the BEST Blue Cheese burger topping I have ever made. Rich and tangy and totally delicious on top of a juicy and simply spiced burger. My go to recipe for my family for burger topping. It never disappoints!

This is absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to cook the onion and garlic in a tablespoon of the bacon grease instead of the olive oil.  There were no other toppings needed on our burgers.  Wow, great recipe, Christina!  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent!! So yummy on burgers! Husband & 2 years old son loved it as well!!
We tried it on steaks too, but the bacon was a bit too much with steak, in our opinion.

Well how yummy was this...I could have eaten it with a spoon!  I used prepared pepper bacon bits and halved the recipe for just the two of us.  We love blue cheese bacon burgers, what a great new twist on an old fave.  A definite do-over, thanks for sharing this recipe Christina!

Okay. I always put mayo, cheese and bacon on all of the burgers that enter my mouth. THIS IS THR GREATEST AND ULTIMATE BURGER TOPPING. I put it on Minnesota_Girl's Slider Style Mini Burgers. Delicious.

YUM!  This recipe is definitely for us!   We love blue cheese and what's not to like about bacon!  My only change was to use sliced onions on the burgers.  There's no doubt about it, I will be using this as a dip also.  Thank you Christina for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!  It's a "keeper"!

I made 3 mini BBQ cheddar bacon burgers and made this mix but instead of blue cheese crumbles, I chopped up roasted red peppers... And I used soft bacon bits instead of going through the hassle of making bacon... Overall I give it an 8!

Was delicious! As I don't care for bacon on my burgers, I omitted the bacon. But it was super yummy (and easy)!

Fantastic on burgers and grilled pork.  Forgot to rate a while back.  I subbed with what was on hand, so I used precooked bacon crumbles, dried minced onion (no fresh in the house), and left out the saute part.  I also used a home made mayo rather than store bought.  Let this sit in the fridge for a few hours before dinner and it was great.  Can't wait to try this with the caramelized onion and garlic per the recipe.  Used Gorgonzola for the blue cheese.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I used a really good Gorgonzola. We blackened our burgers and cooked them over the grill. I have been dipping chips in the leftover topping. Yummy!! I'm about ready to just drinking it straight from the bottle, it is that good. Thanks for sharing!!

Made this for a party and everyone loved it. Very flavorful and very easy to make. I will continue to make it a staple every time we grill.

I made this two night in a row upon request... I also made haystack onion rings (thin sliced onions rings (french fried onions)) for my boyfriend's burger also ... because he loves onions. I didn't have bleu cheese which i was bummed about so i subbed feta and it was awesome... I can't wait to try it with Bleu cheese next time... WHICH WILL BE A WHILE... I think we consumed enough calories for a few days
