I do bake mine a little longer--it really depends on how quickly the buns brown up. If you increase the spices and run the baked hamburger buns through the food processor to a fine consistancy, these will also make great "italian" bread crumbs--way better than the processed brands. THIS CAN BE FROZEN.

These are amazing!!! I attended a church barbecue and after they gave me a few cases of leftover buns.  So while trying to use up 300 old hamburger buns I came across this recipe and they are WONDERFUL.  I've made them multiple times and I don't even measure the seasonings I just throw in some of this and some of that, it's nearly impossible to screw up.  They are awesome on salad but I like to make big ones and use them on french onion or tomato soup.

Thank you so much for this idea, I think it would be great for any old bread, and I have some.  I will try this with some Whole Wheat rolls that I had leftover.

Delicious! I actually used some leftover hot dog buns, but same thing, lol. I used Italian seasoning in place of the oregano, thyme and basil. These needed to bake a little longer than called for, but it was no big issue. These had really great flavor. Great use of leftover buns...I will be making these again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. ;)

Great way to get rid of all those stupid hamburger buns my husband insists on buying (just in case) - which are filling up my freezer.

Perfect and great way to use up those buns. I'm GF and my husband can never get through a whole package of buns alone. These did take me a little longer to bake to get them to brown/crisp up a little more. My husband tasted one before heading out the door and said they are delicious! Thanks for the recipe! I'm certain we'll be making these frequently as we do eat salads a lot.

These were surprisingly easy and delicious. A great way to use up extra buns, which we always seem to have.

These were great. I forgot the salt, and it didn't matter. My husband is a crouton snob - he likes foccacia ones done in a pan. I put these on our salad last night, and he said, "Yum - these croutons are really good". He was surprised they were made from leftover white hot dog buns!

I made it. I found that the bake time took about 20min. in my oven. It still wasn't dark enough for my taste so I turned the broiler on low for a few minutes to get them to the darkness that I wanted.

The best use of old bread you'll ever find! I do bake them a little longer till brown and adjust spices to taste. I also find they store well - longer than 2 weeks.  Great in salads and soups.

So crunchy, so easy.  I cut them too small and only used garlic for seasoning.  My mistake.  I will for sure make them again, and add the flavoring.

8.14.16 ~ Made these for a salad bar I was making for a birthday dinner celebration. Delicious - with the right amount of crunch. Also a nice addition to a bowl of soup. Thanks for sharing your recipe. A great way to use up leftover buns.

I had some bakery buns leftover from another meal and transformed them into these delicious croutons!  I used a Tuscan herb flavored olive oil, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time, I think I will up the seasonings a tad more, even though we still loved them as written!  Thanks for the great recipe, tashaspice!!

Melt-in-your-mouth croutons! My favorite crouton recipe ... Easy and versatile. After coating in olive oil, I seasoned with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning blend. Finished with black pepper. Fun to make! Thank you!

Doubled the spices and used leftover Fabulous French Loaves. Really tasty and great on my salad.
