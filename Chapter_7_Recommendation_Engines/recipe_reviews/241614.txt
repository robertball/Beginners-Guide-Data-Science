We too loved this after trying it. It is very similar to our favorite drink, a "Sidecar". We altered the recipe to be 1:1 orange liqueur and small batch bourbon. We couldn't get the clementine peel to do anything with a flame, so abandoned that part. The rest is spot on. It was so good we made it in 64 ounce batches for Thanksgiving! It keeps well pre-mixed and stored in the fridge for several days, making it super easy to have on hand.

This bourbon based cocktail was delicious and easy! I added a half ounce apple cider as well to give it an even more autumn flavor. I will be making this again this fall for date nights with my wife.
