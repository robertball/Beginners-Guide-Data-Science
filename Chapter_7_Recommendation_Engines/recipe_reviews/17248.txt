Husband really liked this, very refreshing.Would make again. I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used Dream Whip plus made the recipe smaller.

Versatile recipe for whipped cream fruit salad that I've been enjoying since Mom made it when I was a little girl - usually for summer cook-outs.  Today it was a great choice for making use of a bunch of fruits before I leave town again in the morning.  I don't like the nuts in this particular salad so I don't include them.  I sweeten and flavor the whipping cream with powdered sugar and vanilla.  Really any fruits can be used, but today I used bananas, grapes, cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple.  I could eat bowlfuls of this stuff when I was a little girl and wish I still could now!

Excellent.  I make this with Sugar-free Cool Whip.  Garnish with chopped nuts, maraschino cherries & mint spring.  Serve in parfait glasses, makes a great presentation.

Nice and light. Came together very quickly. Next time, I would probably toast the walnuts.

This is very similar to a family staple of mine. The difference is it's Grapenut salad when I make it. 1 or more cups or grapenuts cereal MAKES this recipe.

The salad was very light and good.  I think using a little almond or vanilla extract in the whipping cream would have given it more flavor.  I toasted the nuts and that really popped the walnut flavor.  I'm sure I will make this again, with adding a little extract.  We think this recipe would be really good with fresh strawberries.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We made this for our brunch tonight and it was tasty.  The salad went together quickly and was nice and light.  If/When I make again, I'll toss in a few sliced strawberries.  Yum.

Wonderful light dessert salad! My son would rather I leave out the nuts next time and add cherries too. I added some sugar and a splash of vanilla to the whipped cream. Fabulous, Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This salad is wonderful but instead of brown sugar over the top I crunch up butterfinger candybars and sprinkle on top and chill...you can add as many grapes as you like and either green, red or both. You can make it as creamy as you want or not..you can add bananas, cherries and nuts if you prefer or not.
