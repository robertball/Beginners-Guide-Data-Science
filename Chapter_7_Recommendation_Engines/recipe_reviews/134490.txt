Great basic starter recipe. I was looking for a chicken pasta salad w/out the grapes and nuts. I cooked the chicken in 5 cloves of minced garlic. Once it cooled I added the garlic infused chicken while leaving the minced bits out. Also, I put more kick into the dressing by adding 2 tsp of lemon juice, 1-2 tbs of white vinegar, 1/4 c- 1/2 c of sugar, 2 tsp of paprika, and a splash of milk to better the consistency. Delish!

My family loves this recipe.  I use the Tyson pre-packaged chicken chunks (near the Tuna at the grocery store) and I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  This is quick and easy and perfect for a hot day.

I make a variation of this with the ingredients listed, plus lots of celery seed, and FRESH tomato chunks.  Homegrown tomatoes are best.  Be sure to chill the salad before adding the tomatoes, or you'll end up with pink salad. I also use regular macaroni, but I have used rotini as well.

This is a great recipe, i like to replace the red onion with red capsicum though, you can also add other vegetable like corn, avocado, peas, beans, anything you want

The red onion made all the difference. I used rotini pasta and added some peas. Great pasta salad.
