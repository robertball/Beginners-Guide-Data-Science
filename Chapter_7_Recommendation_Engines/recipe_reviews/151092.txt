Almost 5 stars, but this would have been a bit too sweet. I balanced it out by using plain pretzel sticks (the thin kind) and omitting the chocolate chips. YUM YUM YUM! Everyone at work loved it.

Great mix!  I varied it a bit by just using yogurt covered raisins, chocolate covered peanuts, broken up pretzel sticks, M&Ms, candy corn and cashews.  I also halved the recipe since it makes SO much.  Everyone at our Halloween party loved it!

This was good. I took it to a Halloween party. You can basically add anything you want to the mix.

This is good and perfect for someone with a raging sweet tooth - like me!  What a treat!  It really does make a TON though.  It fed my Bunko group with plenty left over, so plan accordingly if you don't have a big crowd.

This was a total hit at my son's 5th grade party, as well as at the office and with all my friends. I used only salted peanuts and pretzels so it wasn't as sweet as the recipe would have been. It was perfectly sweet and salty the way I made it.

Great idea-just too sweet. I've made it several times this fall and here's the best version my family enjoys: 1 10.5 oz box of Cheeze-it Snack  Mix (or homemade Chex Mix), 1 lb. or peanuts, 1 lb of chocolate candy corn, 1 cup of high quality chocolate chips or candy bar that's been chuncked, 1 cup of M & M's.  If you are serving this at a party in a bowl, also add some caramel corn. This is so good, I'm looking forward to reworking it with Christmas candy!

Wow! This was awesome. Very sweet, but for someone like me, I loved it! It was served at a Bunco game with 16 women and I only had a little bit left, so obviously this was a wonderful treat!

Great! I used Plain pretzels shaped like bats and pumpkins as I couldn't find the white chocolate ones! Everyone loved it!

Very easy and quick!!  Great base for a fun mix. Added regular raisins with the yogurt ones and used regular pretzels. Also omitted the chocolate chips.
