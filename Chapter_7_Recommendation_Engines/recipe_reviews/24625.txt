Excellent!  Next time I make it, I'll try diced hard salami or pepperoni in place of the ham. I pressed the cheese ball into a pretty jello mold and turned it out onto a plate and surrounded it with a variety of crackers.  Beautiful, tasty and all gone.

Gosh! This recieved a total mixed review at my daughter's birthday get-together: ALL agreed that the taste was great BUT at least half of us thought this was too salty! (I'm not sure from where exactly - I added no salt at anytime and I rinsed my ham off before I added it). Half of us were chugging glasses of water after a few bites - meanwhile, the other half had no complaints. I'd love to make this again but I have to find a way to make it less salty.  I'll check future reviews for tips...

If your complaining that it's too salty, it's because of the creole seasoning that your using, try using one that has no salt, or simply use less. Creole seasonings have lots of salt, read the ingredients. You can also supstitute red pepper for the seasoning, it doesn't contain salt. Hope this helps. My kids and friends LOVE this recipe. Please don't change a thing. We think it's just fine. Thanks for sharing it.

I got this recipe from Christine a few years ago
I keep misplacing it and have to call her for it 
at least once or twice a year.
I am so glad she has it posted here now. It is a 
great recipe
I give it to friends with their Christmas gifts 
each year.
Instead of rolling it in a ball, I put mine in a 
styro-foam Christmas cup and wrap it with colorful
Saran Wrap and a ribbon. Everyone loves it!!!
Thanks Christine, this is great!

This cheeseball recipe is the best I have ever found! I cannot take it ANYWHERE without having to share the recipe..... I always make two using the ingredients- 1 rolled in chopped pecans & chives, and 1 plain- One change I do make- I cannot stand Mayo so I sub it for sour cream.. What a hit!! THANK YOU for such a great recipe!

Considering that this is the FOURTH year in a row that my co-workers beg me to make this for the company Christmas party, I thought it was high time that I gave kudos to this recipe.  I make the 'base' recipe and change the type of cheese and the ingredient that it's rolled in, and I can get 3 different flavored cheese logs/balls.  Add some summer sausage and crackers, and it makes a beautiful presentation.  I make them the night before, so I cut the amount of spices in half.  If I don't, the spices become way too overpowering by the next day.

Very tasty.  I used bacon bits instead of ham and Mrs. Dash instead of Creole seasoning.  The recipe made three baseball sized balls.

I was raised on this recipe so of course I love it. Cheese balls at the grocery stores don't taste this good.  If you add the seasonings together before adding the cream cheese you will notice there is a key ingredient missing in this recipe. My family added accent to theirs to round off the taste but now knowing what we know about avoiding MSG, I use salt and it taste perfect. For this recipe add 1 tsp. Trust me it will make a good thing, GREATER.

I was a bit hesitant at the amount of spices and so used about 3/4 of the recommended chili etc...and used Cajun instead of the Creole seasoning and made it into two baseball sized balls.  It was a great hit for both parties I went to on New Year's Eve - creamy with just the right amount of spice and SO easy to make!! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Perfect! I made it with 2/3 of the recipe, and it was the right amount for 8 people to snack on with other snacks.  More would have been nice though:) I was tentative with the spices at first, just added a portion of them, then realized that the full amounts were best.  Instead of putting the cheddar inside, i rolled the ball in it to cover it.  I had several guests asking for the recipe!

since i'm a bit concerned about the green onion purity these days, i used chives from my own garden. before you put this out on the platter, slice some crispy apples.  makes a great presentation, and the apples go well with the tastes.

This was just a bit potent for my family's taste so I used half again as much cream cheese and then they loved it.

This is too salty. :(  I used garlic powder and the kind of creole seasoning the writer recommended, and unsalted nut. It is still salty. I am hoping when it mellows it will be better and not as salty.

This turned out pretty good. I didn't do anything different from the recipe. Everyone said they liked it, but there was a TON leftover. If I made this again, I would definitely cut the recipe in half. But I liked the spices in the cheeseball, it made it different from others that I've made.

I made it in a hurry on Christmas morning, and forgot the Cheddar cheese, the ham, and the miracle whip-ugh!!!  But was still very good.  I am looking forward to trying it again, this time with all the ingredients.

Made this for an office party and it was a big hit. Rolled in Hormel bacon bits and crushed pecans as suggested.
Great Great Party Food !

I was disappointed by this cheese ball.  It made 2 large balls, and after serving it to a party of 30 I still had 1 1/2 balls left.  While I thought it tasted okay, my boyfriend didn't like it at all.  I won't make it again.

I only gave this 4 stars because I'm not sure about this one. I made it almost to a tee with the spices but hardly anyone ate it at a New Years Party. But I was late, everyone had already pretty much eaten the many other offerings. I only had 2 packages of cream cheese so I used about double the shredded cheddar and I also about doubled the ham. I minced up the ham in the food processor. I wish I had used better quality chili powder too. It tasted a lot like a kind of spicy deviled ham spread instead of a cheese ball but it was good. I might try this again and use the 3 packages of cream cheese. It makes a lot. I had 2 large balls. Freeze one for a later time.

This is the BEST cheese ball ever!  I made it without greenonions due to my little kids and without ham due to my vegitarian teenagers.  It was the bomb!  My husband is now an addict!  He said it't the best cracker spread he has ever had - but we love Tony's.  Maybe it's an aquired taste.  And, things are never too salty in my house!

YUM YUM YUM! Not a bite left. I had a group of friends over and this cheeseball dissappeared. I stuck one more in the freezer and sent another one home for a party my Mom is having tonight. Hats off to you!

This cheese ball is very good.  Half a recipe produced two smaller-sized balls, perfect for a party.  I rolled mine in fresh chives from my garden, which made a nice color-contrast with the reddish/pinkish color of the cheese ball. The only issue I had with this recipe was the saltiness:  I rinsed the ham, and used Tony Chachere's (which is the BEST stuff, by the way!) per the submitter's suggestion, but still found it a bit salty.  Don't let that scare you away from the recipe, though.  The taste is really good.  Try it on rye crackers!

about the saltiness,,, maybe it's in the creole seasoning you are using,, we use Toni Chacheres,, some of them do contain alot of salt, also, be careful not to use garlic SALT, this could add alot of salt. I have never had this complaint when I make them, so it has to be in something that your using. Thanks to everyone for the great reviews,, I made another one this weekend, and everyone seems to love it, my kids fight over it.. Also, it's great for the adkins diet, except you might want to use light mayo instead of miracle whip, and also substitute wheat crackers instead of white flour based crackers.  Thanks - Christine

A lot of people at my party really liked this. I wasn't too crazy about it myself, but it went over very well. Next time I'd half the recipe because this either makes one very large cheese ball or two regular sized ones!

I first reading the comments and reduced the creole seasoning to half.  First time I made this only used two packages of cream cheese and reduced the recipe  accordingly and decided into two for two separate parties.  Second time I made this used recipe as is and just reduced the creole seasoning

I make this each year for the holidays.  I have gotten so many compliments on it, from  young and old alike.  I've rolled them in nuts and also in bacon.  Bacon wins, hands down!

Made this for Halloween (flayed man cheese ball)everyone like it, but 2 people. One, said it was to spicy. The other (my son) didn't like the way it looked (flayed man cheese ball)He wouldn't even taste it. It was very good, but not something I will crave. My Mom put it on her pizza, she loved it so much. This was my first cheese ball. I think I will try other recipes, but I am keeping this one. With the leftovers I am going to make twice baked potatoes.

I have been making this since I first discovered this recipe years ago on this site!! Every person who has tasted it has loved it and begs me to make it for them again!! I skip the miracle whip because I don't feel it's needed and I don't always use the creole seasoning because I don't have it on hand. Instead I just use a little paprika by itself with the garlic and onion powder and it is plenty! I am making it tomorrow for a friend's baby shower and am going to make a double batch and roll one in pecans...should be tasty!!

OK, the first time I made this I didn't think about the chopped nuts being salted - don't let this happen! The second time I made it (with chopped (almost powdered) UNSALTED hazelnuts and green onion tops, it was a hit! Fantastic tasting and looking. People were amazed that it was homemade. Try it, you'll like it (if you like cheese, that is).
