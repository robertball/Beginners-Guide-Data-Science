Cookies did not flatten out like picture shows, but I fixed this on my second batch by flattening the tops, and they were bland. I would recommend adding more spices for more flavor. Also make sure to wait until they are completely cooled before adding the glaze on top. Cookies were ok but I will not be making them again.

Always wanted to find a recipe like this!  I omitted the black pepper and instead added 1/2 tsp white pepper instead, and also added 1/2 tsp salt.  I rolled the cookies into balls, then in some raw sugar, flatted with a flat glass.  Mmmm!

I agree with Tina, this turned out rather bland. Living in Europe, I tend to double the dose of anything 'spicy', in american recipes (as I did for this one), 2 and a half cups of flour would be better, I agree.  I also triple the garlic for American recipes.

Good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped!

This cookie did not spread out as pictured but instead stayed as round balls and very hard.  I would use 2-2/12 cups of flour and increase all of the spices, almonds and lemon juice for a more flavorful cookie.  I used all brand new spices and they turned out at best as mildly flavored.  I was looking forward to the black pepper taste but it was lost in all that flour I think.

I made these for a cookie exchange party and my husband keeps eating them.  He loves the spicy flavor.  Super easy to make and it was nice that I had all the ingredients on hand.

These turned out delicious! I love the spiciness as they go really well with tea and coffee. The only difference I'm gonna try next time is putting some jam in the middle. Like strawberry or black berry.

I make these for Xmas every year, along with other types of cookie. I usually add more pepper and more sugar-- to make them more sweet and more peppery

For those who found these cookies a little bland,  try adding 1 teaspoon of salt to the recipe.  Salt brings out the flavor in anything.

I didn't change a thing on this recipe and I love it. I found that the recipe called for the correct amount of sugar and spices, I didn't feel it needed to be increased, but I think that's often personal taste. I found them flavorful and sweet enough. I actually added green and red sprinkle sugar for an added touch of the holiday. They did not spread out as indicated in the recipe, they remained in balls. But it no way took away from this cookie. I'll be saving this for another round.

I read the comments before I made this and used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and doubled all the spices and even added a bit of cayenne pepper hoping it would give a little kick. I also used walnuts instead of almond. I flattened them out with a glass before baking, but they ended up dry and sticking to my greased cookie sheet. I bet if I were to add some butter, and use even less flour and refrigerate the dough before baking it might turn out better, but over all the recipe has too many changes to be made and is just not the greatest cookie.

Good cookie but made a few changes to the recipe.... I added 1 cup butter, baking soda instead of baking powder, almond extract instead of nuts and baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. First round I did follow recipe but they were very hard and thick.

Turned out awesome! I added the juice of an orange instead of the water to the glaze topping.
