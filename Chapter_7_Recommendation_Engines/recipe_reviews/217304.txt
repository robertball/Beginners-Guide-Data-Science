loved the salad but I love all salads.  We did not like the dressing as a salaad dressing,  too sweet we ate it as a dessert.  although  looking at the recipe I noticed that I forgot to add the salt.  Are you suppose to crush the fresh blueberries as I left them whole.

This salad was so GOOD! Definitely one of my favorites for a lunch or a light dinner, and so easy. The only thing that I changed was I added some cut up chicken to the salad to make it just a little more filling, but followed everything else exactly. The dressing was wonderful, just the right amount of sweetness to it. I made this for dinner tonight, but I know that I will be taking leftovers to work for lunches over the next couple of days. I will be making this one again for sure!

I used Lemon pepper marinade on the chicken and used skewers on the grill. Added 1/4 cup of pecans and used a bed of romaine lettuce. It came out great. Will definitely make this again.
