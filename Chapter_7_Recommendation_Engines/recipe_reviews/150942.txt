This turned out verrrry good, I was scared to be the first to try it but I am glad that I did. My grandma always orders moo goo gai pan when we eat out at chinese, so I wanted to try this recipe out and hopefully surprise her one day! I think she will be happily surprised with this one! I did change the veggies up a little bit to my liking and how it's served at our local chinese place. I added a head of broccoli and a can of stir fry corn. I left out the bok choy and used bamboo shoots in place of the water chestnuts. I used frozen peas and they worked just fine. For the sauce I did use powdered ginger and a little more than 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I had some cooking white wine that I've had forever but it didn't seem to ruin anything. I added about 1 tbls of soy sauce just because, not really sure why. Me and my mom both enjoyed this, will make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious! I used chicken tenderloins, making it really easy to slice. My grocer was out of snow peas, so I used sugar snap peas instead. Everything else stayed exactly according to recipe, although I doubled it. Such an easy, healthy, and good recipe! Next time I think I will add something to give it some heat like red pepper flakes.

Eh, this was all right. For all the work I did, it would've been easier to just call the Chinese food place. The taste was bland, something is missing, I'm not sure what. I had to triple the sauce and after it was plated added some soy sauce, which made it taste better. The plus to this recipe is that you can use whatever veggies you want. I added carrots, broccoli, and bamboo, but didn't use bok choy (didn't have any at the store). Another plus, it is a lot healthier then the take out!

I did not enjoy this.  I had really high hopes as the list of ingredients looked wonderful.  The only thing I changed was the veggies.  I used carrots and left out bok choy and waterchestnuts.  This had absolutely no flavor.  I even reread the recipe to make sure I hadnt missed anything.  Not sure what went wrong.  When I first read the reviews I thought the people who said this had no taste must not have ever had Moo Goo Gai Pan because it is a very mild tasting dish but this is tasteless.  oh well!  ill keep looking.

Great! I think next time I will double or triple the sauce. It tastes very similar to what you buy in chinese restaurants.

I follow this minus the chicken.  I like it with just veggies.  People keep commenting that this has no flavor, yet they leave out main ingredients.  Bok choy is essential to the flavor of this dish, don't leave it out.  I also add about a teaspoon of oyster sauce to the sauce mixture for more depth of Asian flavor. I also use sherry, instead of white wine. With my changes it's five star.

This tasted bland as written. I ended up adding some soy sauce to give it a kick before serving.

I confess to not following the recipe exactly... but I almost never do. I used Napa cabbage instead of bok choy and added celery.  Otherwise followed ingredients listed (though not perhaps in the listed amounts) and produced and excellent stir-fry. Thank you!

My husband and I both liked this recipe a lot. It's different than the spicy Chinese food we usually favor. I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting matchstick carrots for the mushrooms and a large slivered red onion for the water chestnuts.  I served it on hot rice. Immediately, my older son came to join us for dinner.  You may want to double up on the sauce, but I liked how it just coated the vegetables. Oh...and go heavy on the garlic and fresh ginger!

Mmmm....good. The sauce was a little plain, though. I'd use soya sauce next time instead of sherry and also maybe make a bit more of the sauce. This recipe is nice because if you don't like one item you can change it for another and the recipe is still great.

My family and I really enjoyed this! I used bok choy, water chestnuts, broccoli and matchstick carrots. I doubled the sauce ingredients, added more garlic than called for, omitted the white wine (didn't want to open a bottle for just 1 tsp) and replaced it with about 1 Tbsp of soy sauce. The end result was really delicious - we will make it again for sure.

Great recipe! Thank you.  Followed it exactly, except the bok choy, which we could not find in any of our local grocers...hmmm...I've found it before.  Just added more snow peas and mushrooms and it was fine.

I made this recipe as written. It is quite possibly the best moo goo gai pan recipe that I have found as this is my favorite Chinese dish when eating out. The sauce does however need to be doubled.

This is  becoming one of my go to chicken recipes.  I sub  bamboo shoots for the  water chestnuts, but either is fine.  I also  sub broccoli for  bok choy, because that's what I'm used to.  Delicious!

Easy and delicious!  I didn't even have a wok to use and it still turned out to be tasty :-) I made rice with the rest of the chicken broth and they were good together.  The serving sizes were pretty small.  I'll make extra next time.

It came out a little dry. I even doubled the sauce and it still wasn't as much as normal Chinese take out. Suggest at least doubling if not tripling the sauce. Suggest using a zester or something on the ginger. Tried to do it with a knife and couldn't get it fine enough. Ended up having some very gingery bites. I did the brown sauce by using soy sauce instead of the white wine, plus adding a dash of sherry. The flavor was good.

This receipe is excellent!  It took a bit of time to prep the ingredients and I added a few extra, changed a few things but the basic recipe is a definite keeper!  I rounded up on the snow peas, mushrooms and bok choy, doubled the garlic, ginger, and white wine, added a bit of white pepper, baby corn, and slivered carrots for color.  I also doubled the broth mixture but did not double the cornstarch.  It came out excellent!  Next time I will add more bok choy and cut it in larger pieces.

1st time I made this style of food. It was great! I substituted shrimp for chicken. Only thing was my sauce was too runny. Should have added more cornstarch. Otherwise yummy!

Pretty good... did not produce as much sauce as I would have liked.  Plus, I used canned mushrooms, which gave it more of a mushy texture.

This was better than what I've had at the restaurants. I did add carrots to the mix but only for color and additional nutrition but the carrots have nothing to do with my five star rating. I did double the sauce but only because we like ours saucier than most. Thanks for the great recipe!

My first time making moo goo gai pan.  It was absolutely fantastic.   Just like  I would expect from a restaurant.  Because of the amount of prep work needed.   did my measuring and prep work the day before I was ready to make my meal.

I liked the essence of this recipe. This was a great homemade version of Chinese takeout. I used two large chicken breasts, added some zucchini to the vegetables and quadrupled the sauce recipe because I like a lot of sauce and it seemed like I had a lot of chicken and vegetables. I added about a tablespoon of soy sauce to my sauce and then only doubled the cornstarch thickener. I forgot to start my ginger and garlic getting fragrant, but I think I preferred adding it with my chicken rather than the times I have cooked it the other way when making this recipe before. We ended up with 5+ hearty servings of this.

Despite the freshly minced ginger and garlic, this was still on the bland side.  It was good, but missing something.  If I were to make it again, I would add low sodium soy sauce to boost the flavor.

Wish I could have gotten the bok choy, but it still turn out well with celery. I didn't have white wine, but Brut champagne which had lost it fizz so I used it. Very happy with this recipe.

I made this as written with these exceptions: I always velvet the chicken before preparing Chinese stir fry, I used bamboo shoots instead of water chestnuts, added small amount of red pepper flake. I found the dish to be bland and definitely lacked seasoning. I will make again but adjust to our liking, probably adding a few T of oyster sauce to the recipe.

I enjoyed this but my husband wasn't fond of it. I added some baby corn and a little bit of thinly sliced carrot. 
Due to the increase in veggies, I quadrupled the sauce. That ratio was perfect for me. Not quite as good as take out but this is a good enough substitute that I would make it again for me.

This was indeed delish. I threw in a can of baby corn I had that had been in my pantry forever and added in a couple of splashes of sesame seed oil along with the vegetable oil to give it a more distinct "Asian" flavor. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

great recipe! swapped out bok choy and snow peas for celery, carrots, onions and also added some cashews. doubled the sauce cuz I had a lot of veggies and was pretty happy how this turned out. next time will try with bamboo shoots, mushrooms and snow peas. sauce couldve had a bit more kick, added soy sauce after but will maybe tinker more next time.

This recipe’s flavor was a bit too subtle for our taste. I made it as written and I doubled the sauce but it was very bland. I will not make it again.

I bought fresh veg from the farmers market and wanted a white sauce.  The sauce here was so simple and I had everything on hand.  The family liked it.  When I was making supper another day I got this out and it was good cold.

This very good and easy dish,  used a bag of frozen snap peas, carrots, mushrooms and water chestnuts and added extra snap peas.  Added thinly sliced carrots and celery.  I didn’t have chicken broth, so dissolved half bouillon chicken cube which added very good flavor. Added a little extra rice wine in place of white wine. Since I love ginger  and garlic added probably two teaspoons.

Delicious! Only change I made was to add a chopped onion to the mix. Consistency was spot on. Next time I'll try the brown sauce version.

This absolutely tastes like the moo goo gui  pan you can get from the best Chinese restaurants.  Slightly complicated, but well worth the effort.

This was  really good.  The grocery store was out of bok choy so I used Napa cabbage instead.  I normally make more spicy Chinese dishes, but I will make this Cantonese one again.  Yummie!

I found it a little flavorless. I added some chicken seasoning and a little soy. All in all good will keep and work on the sauce a little bit for more flavor.

Overall great recipe; however, I added carrots to give it more color!  It was a great hit in my household.  Who needs takeout when you can cook great entrées like this!
