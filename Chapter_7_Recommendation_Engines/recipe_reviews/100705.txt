Three modifications make this fantastic.  Add 2 tbsp. chili powder, a chopped onion (I think it was accidentally omitted from the original recipe, given the instructions referencing onion mixture), and, instead of a habanero, I had habanero hot sauce  and added two teaspoons.  FANTASTIC.  And very easy.

This is a great chili recipe!  The only change I make is that we like our chili a little thick so instead of just tomato sauce, I add a 12 ounce can of tomato paste and then a just 4-6 ounces of sauce.  I also haven't been able to find drief habaneros so I use fresh.  Cutting them is a little dangerous but well worth it!

This was an excellent recipe. I used 1/2 C each of kidney, and black beans. I also used 1/2 C of black-eyed peas.I pressure cooked the beans and black-eyed peas for about 30 minutes before adding them to the crock pot. I skipped the ground turkey. My wife and I were too hungry to wait the hour for the 4th step so I skipped it. The recipe came out great. I will definitely make this again.

Wow, incredible! I think I found my new chili recipe! I sauteed the turkey meat with 1 diced onion, added 2 tbsp chili powder, and added 1 can of diced tomatoes. I couldn't find any smoked habaneros, so I used dried red chilis instead and some hot sauce. Delicious!

This was FANTASTIC! This will definitely warm you up on a 10 degree day :) I can never find habaneros this time of year but I used a teaspoon of habanero powder, instead. I also used 1 can tomato paste, a little over a cup of tomato sauce, and added diced fire roasted tomatoes. I will defintely be making this again! Thank you for a great recipe!!

This chili is fire hot and delicious. I made it for a party and actually used it as a dip with tortillas.  I didn't have turkey so use 93/7 fat beef. I added 2 fresh habenaros finely chopped and it was just the right hot for us and a hit at the party. It was the last dish to arrive and the first to disappear.

I have been making this recipe- for several years. I use habenero hot sauce instead of the pepper because they are hard to find in my town. I also love the nutritional value, high fiber, low cal. Its a great diet food-just don't tell anybody.My husband LOVES it. I love it because it is simple, inexpensive and goes along way with a crowd. I made a double batch for a christmas party last year and it was a hit. I actually had to send a cup of it home witjavascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')h one guy he loved it so much.

I changed this up a bit to make a vegetarian chili. It is the best chili I've ever had - was a hit with the hubby too, so much that he even ate all the leftovers and he's not a leftover type of guy. The changes I made are instead of using the turkey - I used 1 bag of morningstar veggie crumblers (it's a meat free sub for ground beef). I chopped up the garlic for the recipie and combined the veggie crumblers with it and zapped it in the microwave for 2 min before I put it in the crock-pot. Topped that with one chopped onion. I didn't have black-eyed peas, so I used navy beans instead. I also didn't have a fresh habenero, so I used 1 tablespoon of La Anita Habenero salsa instead. I also added another tablespoon or so of brown sugar, and I forgot to leave the corn out at the beginning, which wasn't the frozen kind, it was canned, I just drained it. I was nervous about putting in so much basil, but oh my - is it ever good. It really makes the dish! I made it for the first time last week and already made it again because it's so delicious. I topped it with shredded marbled cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

I added a bit of a twist which turned out great!  Use Chipotles in Adobo instead of dried Habaneros, then double the tomato sauce and halve the beans.  I like my chili a bit more like a soup and the kids aren't that fond of beans.

I couldn't find Habanero (dried or fresh) so I substituted with 2 tbls. crushed red peppers. I couldn't find any canned black-eyed peas so I just bought them dry and soaked them in water while I was putting the other ingredients together, then I drained them and added them to the pot, which worked great. I also added about two cups of water before letting my chili cook for hours because I didn't think there was enough liquid for my crock pot. Turned out great. Random note: This chili just LOOKS cool. Make it as directed and you cook up a totally unique-looking and great tasting chili.

Great recipe. I added the missing onion, but that's all and won best overall taste in a department chili cook-off with it!

4 stars with the caveat that I had to use a lot of extra spices: cinnamon, chili powder, chipolte chilli powder and cumin. I also added ~ 1 cup chopped onion.

Used one fresh habanero and one dried chipoltle pepper as I couldn't find dried habanero.

Added ~1 cup of chicken broth--and it was still super thick!

Final verdict: good, like that it had more veggies, but isn't going to be my traditional go to chili recipe.

Very tasty.  I used a fresh habenero instead and came out just as well as dried.  Also is great over mac and cheese believe it or not.

There is not enough juice in this to consider it a chili, not any chili I have ever had anyways. It had great flavor but it was more like a dip which is exactly how I ate it, with saltine crackers. Won't make this again.

Very nice chili. I had never cooked with dried habanero chiles before so I didn't know what to expect from one. It was plenty, although I might add some canned diced green chiles for flavor next time.

I made this recipe to feed a group of people staying at a homeless shelter. I raised the serving size to 40 servings. I used canned turkey meat instead of ground turkey meat, and used jalapeno peppers instead of dried habaneros. Most of the people liked it!

I made this adding one small onion, one jar of my stewed tomatoes from the garden and 2 T. chili powder.  I also switched out the kidney beans for Great Northern beans.    
EXCELLENT!!  This recipe is my new favorite chili recipe.

It was good, but I have a much better recipe that I got out of a old church cookbook. I did follow the suggestion to add chili powder but still found it a little bland for my taste.

This chili recipe was a fun change of pace.  The corn provides a sweet contrast to the earthy background flavors.  We made burritos with the leftovers (using tortillas, cheese, and sour cream) that were equally as good.

WONDERFUL! I followed LAURAJFROST's suggestions in her review adding chili powder, onion, and using habanero hot sauce.  After cooking the meat (I used ground elk) with the onion, garlic, and pepper, I threw all of the other ingredients into my slow cooker (minus the corn) and left it for 7 hours on low.  When ready to serve I stirred in the corn and then served with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and cornbread.  My husband RAVES about this chili and wants to eat it every week now!

This is great as a meal unto itself. I added an extra habenaro as I like things spicy and it was perfect! Serve with saltines or cornbread.

Great recipe! Easy to get going. Tastes great. What more can you ask? I made a couple of small changes, but the original version is still a 5 star recipe in my view. I roasted 3 ears of corn, stripped the kernels and added it to the slow cooker. This substituted for the frozen corn. I also cut up a fresh tomato and dropped it in at the start. I think both changes helped give the chili a heartier flavor.

This is a great recipe! I made a couple of mods...I used 2 fresh habanero peppers with some seeds, added about 1 tbls of cumin and used about 2 tbls of Worcestershire sauce.. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of ground turkey (lean) the first time I made it...

This recipe is under-rated.  It has a great flavor.  I've shared it with coworkers and they all love it.  It's perfect as-is.

I really like this recipe. I liked the flavor. (We did it without the habanero peppers because my store didn't sell the dried ones.) My husband told me he really liked so much that he wants it again this week after having it last week! It was so easy to make. I hardly spent any time cooking at all. My husband and I work so many hours that I try to find convenient things to cook. This was the most convenient dinner to cook. We eat the same thing for dinner all week long for our lack of time, so for the two of us I tripled the recipe so instead of it making 10 servings I made 30 servings. After 7 days, we still have plenty left over.

AMAZING. I make this every 2 weeks and freeze it for when my husband comes home from work and I am still at the office. He loves it... even more than his mother's. Easy recipe and always delicious.

I followed the directions and cooked it over night. The chilli burned in my crock pot on low! :( but what wasnt burned didnt seem to have much flavor. 
Have to remake chilli for our cook off. The burned part i believe is not the recipes fault but i may need a new crock pot.

I've tried alot of different chili recipes and this one was good but not what I'd consider great. I did add some hot chili sauce to mine since it seemed like it was lacking something. I also added 2 small cans of tomato juice since it seemed so dry.

This chili was all right.  Just seemed like it was missing something.  I added an onion.  I couldn't find dried habaneros so I used a fresh one.  It wasn't spicy at all.  It was actually pretty sweet, a little too sweet for me.  Maybe a dried habanero would have imparted more of a smoky flavor, I don't know.
