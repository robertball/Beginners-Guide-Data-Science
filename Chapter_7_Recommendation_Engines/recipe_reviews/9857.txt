Let me save you the headache of making the mistake I did...  I have never made meringue before, and I thought, "How could 2 egg whites possible make 48???"  So I doubled the recipe.  I never did get "stiff peaks" so I dumped and started over, this time following the recipe...mostly.  I didn't have candycanes, so I used peppermint extract and green food coloring.  I followed one other poster's advice and used a ziploc baggie with a corner cut out to pipe out perfect little hershey's kiss sized meringues.  I got at least 48!  I found that after cooking for the 1.5 hrs, I only had to let them sit in there for about an hour more, and they were perfectly done.  Very easy, no fat, probably could be done with splenda to be low cal as well.

As a long time meringue maker and daughter of professional bakers, let me share a few tips.  First of all, check your oven temperature.  Put a thermometer in your oven and see if it's running hotter than your set temp.  Never put meringues on foil, always use parchment paper.  They slide right off.  Never, ever let any egg yolk get into your egg whites.  They will not stiffen properly if even the smallest amount of egg yolk gets into your egg whites.  Make sure you add the sugar slowly, beating well in between each addition.  Don't try to beat egg whites by hand, always use a mixer.  You need that extra speed and the air that gets into your whites with a mixer.  Using a whisk will not achieve that result and a mixer is so much easier and quicker, too.  Bring your eggs to room temp before trying to beat them.  It just works better.  Adjust the baking time based on the size of your meringues.  Never take the meringues out until they're completely cool.  Once they're cool, humidity shouldn't affect them at all.  Meringues are so versatile and you can play with the flavors which makes them so much fun to make.  They're really one of the easiest cookies you can make but you do have to be careful and you do have to follow the directions or they will be a flop.

This is a great recipe, but I just had to clarify one of the suggestions made by another reviewer. Meringue CANNOT be made with Splenda. It won't set correctly and will be a waste of your time, promise.

Very easy to make, and turned out perfect! Next time I might add a drop of peppermint extract to the egg whites.  By adding a little food coloring, you can make these year-round (green for St. Patrick's Day, red for Valentine's Day, etc.)  Instead of lining the cookie sheets with foil, I used parchment paper with great results.  A regular meringue cookie maker told me to never make meringues on a humid or rainy day because they will flop.  You may want to keep this in mind when making them.  I'll be making these again.  They were impressive, yet so simple (and inexpensive) to make!!!  Great for low-fat dieters also!!

THESE MERINGUES ARE VERY GOOD. DID MAKE WITH 8 EGG YOLKS AND 2 CUPS OF SUGAR.  CUT THE SUGAR IN HALF AND USED "SPLENDA - MEASURES THE SAME AS SUGAR" FOR THE OTHER HALF.  CUTS WAY DOWN ON THE CALORIES.  YOU CAN ADD ANY TYPE OF EXTRACT, VANILLA, MAPLE, ETC...OR EVEN COCOA POWDER TO THESE TO CHANGE THE FLAVOR, BUT REMEMBER TO ADD ALITTLE EXTRA SUGAR IF ADDING THE EXTRACT TO KEEP UP THE CONSISTENCY OF THE MERINGUES. THE MORE SUGAR THAT YOU ADD THE CRISPIER THEY BECOME. ALSO YOU CAN SPINKLE THESE WITH COLORED SUGAR, CINNAMON AND SUGAR, OR EVEN FLAVORED JELLO (ALSO YOU CAN PUT JELLO IN THEM FOR FRUIT FLAVORED MERINGUES) FOR FUN COLORS AND TASTE, ADD MINI CHOCOLATE CHIPS, KIDS LOVE THEM. ALLOW TO BAKE FOR THE FULL 90 MINUTES AND THEM SHUT THE OVEN OFF AND LEAVE IN OVEN FOR ANOTHER HOUR. IF COOKING MORE THAN ONE TRAY ADD ABOUT 10 MINUTES COOKING TIME FOR EACH TRAY AND ROTATE TRAYS 1/2 WAY THROUGH COOKING.  THIS HELPS FOR ALL THE MOISTURE TO BE EVAPORATED. MERINGUES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CRISP ALL THE WAY THROUGH, NOT CHEWY IN THE CENTER. CAN PIPE THESE THROUGH A PASTRY PAG WITH LARGE DECORATIVE TIP TO MAKE FANCY MERINGUES.  BEST TO BAKE ON PARCHMENT PAPER.

This was a fast and easy recipe. If you do want to add peppermint extract, only 1/2 tea. is needed. any more makes the egg whites fall. Trust me. It took me 2 times to get it right.

These are delicous and so pretty! I made the first batch as it stated, then made one batch with about 1 tsp. of  peppermint extract. You have to fold it in after everything else is done. I tried to add it when I was whipping the egg whites and it fell.

These were a nice light treat. I put my eggs in a bowl of warm water to bring them to room temp. faster. My egg whites whipped up lickety split. I crushed the candy canes to a fine powder and mixed it in. Then I topped each one with a chocolate chip. Mmmm. And so easy too.

Just as i remembered as a kid.  I did add in mini choc chips as well, which made these great.  Once warning if you are adding to a plate of cookies for serving make sure you add them last.  I made up a few trays the evening before and found that these cookies pulled moisture from other cookies and became a little chewy.  Before being added to the trays they were not that way.

These are excellent as a holiday candy! It's best to add a few drops of green food coloring while beating, then once stiff peaks are formed fold in the crushed candy cane and about a 1/4 bag of mini chocolate chips. I then put the mixture into a ziploc bag and cut a corner out to put onto the trays before baking-it definitely looks better (make the whole large enough to fit the chocolate chips through). They look like mini scoops of mint chocolate chip ice cream and they're delicious!

This was my first time EVER making meringue-anything, and it went pretty well! My only (very mild) hang-up: I used a dark cookie sheet lined w/foil. When I piped the mixture onto the foil, it left a hollow space inside the meringue.  I believe that because of the dark cookie sheet, it toasted the insides just a tiny bit; causing the candies to taste a little like toasted marshmallows.  Simple solution: I used a previous user's suggestion and sprinkled hot cocoa mix on top.  Mint-cocoa meringues!  They disappeared in minutes. Thanks very much for sharing your recipe!

This is the first time I have made the peppermint version...I added a little bit of red food coloring.  I make another version of this at Christmas time (minus the peppermint use vanilla instead) and I add chocolate chips.  My version is called Nighty Nights...instead of 200 degrees you preheat the oven to 350 put your trays in the oven, tell your cookies "nighty night" then turn OFF the oven and go to bed.  Your cookies will be done in the morning when you get up.

People that don't follow directions in a recipe and then post their displeasure really annoy me. If you can't follow a simple recipe why do you expect it to turn out correctly and why complain about your stupidity? 
Anyway, this recipe is great. I do the usual piping, with two bags. One with stripes of red food coloring painted in it and the other with green. I also add a little drop of peppermint oil in the meringue as well as topping with crushed candy canes. It’s also fun to shape the meringue into candy canes. Get creative!

I live on the rainy coast so I was worried that these meringues wouldn't work--but they were fine.  They make 48 if you make them very small-- they are more like candies than cookies.  The peppermint of the candy cane was pepperminty enough.  I stored these in a tin with two little dessicant canisters from vitamin bottles and they stayed perfectly dry & crisp.  The first time I made them with farm eggs and the second time with store-bought eggs and noticed that the fresh farm eggs whip up a lot quicker and thicker than store eggs.  The second time I omitted the candy cane on some and dipped the tops in melted chocolate-- a very good variation.

We doubled the recipe and added a little less than 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract. Then we sprinkled a little powder from our hot cocoa mix on top before baking. Absolutely delicious!

This almost ended up with one star... I followed the directions and couldn't seem to form any kind of peak for the meringue.  I eventually tossed that batch out and unwilling to be defeated (even at 2 a.m.), I started a new one.  I left out the salt because I only have kosher and I didn't know if it was part of what kept my meringues from succeeding, and used regular granulated sugar instead of the baker's sugar that I use for baking.  After about 30 minutes of beating with my handheld mixer I finally reached a stiff peak.  I used a small tip on my pastry bag and piped out little dollops of meringue onto parchment paper.  Next time I'll have to color them green, so they look like little christmas trees, and I sprinkled them with red and white nonpareils, like little christmas ornaments.  I flavored it with a couple drops of peppermint extract, put them in the oven for an hour and a half, then after 1 1/2 hours, I shut off the oven, left them inside and went to bed.  The result this morning was awesome!  They look like little snow covered christmas trees and are soooo light and fluffy.  Definitely worth learning to do meringue for!

Really simple, fun cookie. If you don't like sugar, you can substitute "Splenda". I used a pastry bag with a large star tip to pipe them on the foil. If you'd like, you can also add 1/2t of pure peppermint extract to the egg whites as you whip them.

This is very similar to my family recipe which we just love. Ensure you beat in the sugar until the granules disappear for the perfect meringue. We always dye ours green for Christmas and add mint flavouring and chocolate chips. Yum! Those are the best and what my grandma is famous for. I've also seen these left white to make as ghosts for halloween. Then use choc chips or icing for eyes.

This is a really nice recipe.  For anyone who had trouble with beating the egg whites...egg whites, unlike whipping cream actually whip up better and more quickly when at room temp, so DON'T chill your bowl and beaters, and do let your eggs come to room temp before beating.  I never remember to take eggs out ahead, so I just put them in a bowl of warm water for 5 minutes or so.

Delicious and light.  Just made these and I added about 1/4 tsp. of lemon extract to the egg mixture after at the very end and added about 1/4 cup of sugar.  Beated on kitchenaid mixer on high speed till blended.  Baked for about 80 minutes.  Next time will place all 3/4 cup of sugar together.  Delicious. thank you for the recipe. Will be making these again and again.  Will be giving an update on the next batch.

Very good and simple to make.  I gave them as Christmas gifts to my coworkers and everyone loved them.  I did add about 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, though because I love vanilla.

Quick, simple and delicious but I think there's a learning curve to dealing with the wet meringue.  I'll definitely make these again.

SO GOOD! I didn't have candy canes so I just added about 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out great. Next time, I might add just a tiny bit less sugar and reduce the baking time slightly (my oven tends to be on the hot side). Definitely will be making these again.

Yummy! I've done these w/o peppermint and used different flavored extracts. All were great. People loves these because they are light, fluffy, and just melt in your mouth. My dad couldn't get enough of them at Christmas a few years ago.

Loved this recipe! I made them exactly as written, thinking I might add some peppermint extract the next time, but they are perfect as they are. I doubled the recipe except for the candy canes (2 was plenty) These will be a yearly tradition for our family!

I, too, used 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract in place of the candy canes and it worked beautifully. I put my kitchen aid mixer on high, and after I added the sugar I walked away for about ten minutes and came back. I let it go a bit longer and they turned out great!

Yum Yum Yum!  These came out nice and light and airy, just like you want a meringue to be.  Thanks to the reviewer for the baking tip of heating oven to 350 degrees, shut off oven, put cookies in oven and go to sleep-they were perfect the next morning!  I thought these might need peppermint extract but found they were just right without it.  These will be a great addition to my Christmas cookie plate.

These are a lot sweeter than I expected, but definitely tasty.  I didn't have any crushed peppermint, so I just made them plain (with the vanilla extract, though).  My second batch was topped with sugar and cinnamon, but I think I prefer them plain.  One note for those of you upset with cracking... I refrigerated the batter for the second batch while the first was baking, and the cold batch cracked a lot more.  The first batch was tasty, fluffy, fully cooked, and didn't stick while batch #2 wasn't fully crisped, stuck to the pan, and didn't taste as good.  In short, don't use cold egg whites!  This is a good recipe, though... will try it again with different flavored extracts.

Someone asked if it is possible to make these with Splenda.  I have good results by adding 2 tsp dry egg white powder to partially make up for the body that sugar adds to the meringue.  At first the egg white powder looks as if it will not work but gradually it will blend into the liquid egg whites.  Reduce the speed of the mixer when adding the Splenda or it will fly everywhere!  The yield will be less than when made with sugar but the cookies are excellent if one is on a low carb diet.  These also are good variations adding other ingredients such as chocolate chips and/or chopped nuts.  Finely chopped dried cranberries are also good.  Use your imagination to make different flavors of cookies.  If not adding peppermint I like to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.

For a more rustic appearance drop batter onto foil or parchment paper using two spoons.  

For the reviewer who said that meringue did not form probably the bowl or beaters had grease on them.  When beating egg whites make sure that the bowl and beaters are grease- free. Do not use a plastic bowl for beating egg whites as they usually have a film of grease no matter how thoroughly they are washed.

Very delicious.  They are hard to stop eating because they are so light and delicious!  I made these twice this week because the first time they ended up too big, and therefore not enough.  I had spooned them onto the cookie sheets, and ended up with only 12 (and had to cook them for 2 hours).  The second time I made them, I used others suggestion of piping them out of a ziploc baggie.  Much easier!  I was also able to make them look more uniform and therefore look nicer.  I stuck by the recipe for this batch, but I'm excited to try some variations that others suggested.  I had to really watch them to make sure they didn't brown and rotated them several times and even moved them up a level in my oven at one point, but overall pretty easy.

I'm a big fan of these light, airy meringues.  I made two batches - the first one following the recipe as given except I used Betty Crocker peppermint sugar crystals to sprinkle on top instead of the candy canes.  The second batch I tried with Splenda for baking.  I read in a review that they wouldn't set up correctly with Splenda, but I couldn't tell the difference between the two batches!  I think the secrect is to use the Splenda that is specifically designed for baking.  With the Splenda instead of sugar, these cookies are almost calorie free and perfect for someone who is watching their sugar intake or fat.  I made mine very small and they are the perfect bite-sized snack.  I'm adding some extra information to my review - I tried yet another batch using 1/2 cup of Splenda for Baking and after I had stiff peaks, I gently folded in 1/4 cup sifted unsweetened cocoa powder.  The trick is to fold very gently; if its not completely mixed it's OK.  Then I piped them into very small kiss shapes and topped with the peppermint sugar crystals.  They were wonderful, with just enough of a chocolate taste to satisfy a craving and virtually no calories at all!  The Splenda for Baking works fine, just don't use regualr Splenda!

The only hard part about this is the cooking time.  Very easy and light.  I did add peppermint extract to the egg whites after they were whipped.  I cannot imagine NOT adding this extra step.  Also, remember not to put these on the same plate as other goodies.  They will absorb all the moisture from the other goodies and become gummy (which is not good).  These need to be by themselves.  Awesome recipe and will make again.

My first shot at anything meringue. I tested out my skills using only 1 egg white at first to make sure I could identify the different stages of meringue (foam, soft peaks, stiff peaks). I highly suggest this test run for meringue newbies out there. Once I figured that out I started in with this recipe. Looking back I am glad I did the test run as I don’t think I would have beaten the “real” mixture as long as I needed to.

The only change I made was to add 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract. I am currently sans stand mixer, so I used the trusty ol' hand held. I first beat the egg whites on low until they were foamy. At this point I added in the salt, cream of tartar & peppermint extract. I then beat the mixture some more, gradually increasing the mixer speed until I was at medium speed when the mixture hit the very beginning of the soft peak stage. At that time I began adding the sugar in (not all at once, work in a little at a time). By the time the firm peak stage was beginning all the sugar was incorporated and the mixer was up to high speed. I read somewhere online that once you have the sugar added that you can't overbeat the meringue - comforting to know. It took 10-15 minutes or so with the hand held mixer to get from the foam to the firm peak stage. After piping them onto the baking sheet, I dusted with crushed candy canes and a mixture of red & green decorating sugar. Baked exactly as directed, came out amazing! Will definitely make again - chocolate mint next time!

These are an adorable holiday treat! Super easy to make (my first time making meringue) and easy to modify with sprinkles, cocoa powder, food coloring...etc.   I didn't really have trouble with the meringue, but I did add a bit more sugar to make it stiffer. I also would prefer them a bit chewy, so I'll back off the cooking time next time.  What a great recipe with minimal ingredients to suit ANY holiday or event!

Recipe as written a 4, I thought they needed some peppermint extract so I added it.  Also just for some visual intrest I painted my ziplock piping bag with red food gel stripes so that the meringues had a candy cane appearance.  turned out very cute!  Check out the picture.  And not hard at all!  I'll make these every Christmas season.

This is a favourite.
Quick and easy to make - especially if you buy your egg whites in a carton. I bake them in the evening and at the end of the baking time turn off the oven and leave them unitl morning. You can use different coloured/flavoured candy canes for different effects.

Very happy with this recipe.  For anyone having issues getting their eggs white to peak- the key is to separate the yolk and the whites while they are still cold (right out the fridge).  Then you can wait for the eggs whites to come to room temperature.

If you try to separate the eggs if they've been on the counter awhile, there's a good chance the yolk will mix in.  You may not notice even notice it, but even the tiniest amount of yolk will prevent the whites from forming peaks.

Great Cookie!  Very easy to make.  I added a several drops of peppermint extract.  Depending on the size of the cookies you may need to adjust the baking time.  Mine took longer than the time stated to dry.

This were good. I like the taste a lot. Everyone is right, the texture is kinda weird. I used room temp egg whites and it still seemed like it took forEVER to peek, which caused me to get bored, which caused me to get curious. So I added 2 drops of pink food coloring and about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I put the mix in a ziplock bag, cut the corner and piped them onto my foil lined cookie sheet, all the while talking about how I needed pastry bag for Christmas! I cooked them for the specified time, shut off the oven and let them stay there overnight. They came out picture perfect and very tasty. A simple recipe that I will use again and again!

These were awesome!  I used Spenda instead of sugar to help avoid some calories.

Some are posting that this recipe will not set correctly with Splenda, but I have used it several times and it works perfectly.   Make sure the egg whites are at room temperature and the bowl (must be glass) and beaters are absolutely clean.   Any remnant of egg yolk will also hurt the recipe.   Hope this helps.

Turned out well although they were somewhat runny, granted I hand mixed the egg whites. Rather than crushing up candy canes I bought "peppermint sprinkles" from bulk barn. same thing :)

I'm giving this 2 stars (versus 1 or none) even though mine turned out to be completely unedible - there must have been something I did wrong.   I have made meringues many times in the past and I don't know what happened with these! Problem #1: The candy cane pieces stuck together, making it challenging to sprinkle the top of the cookies. Problem #2: The Meringues stuck to the foil and were literally IMPOSSIBLE to unattach. Problem #3: The meringues came out chewy like taffy, not the meringues should be.   I live in Texas, and although it was winter when I made these, it was hot & humid in my house, so that may have something to do with the condition of these cookies; however, I have made meringues in the heat of the summer before too, so not sure where I went wrong. All I know is I won't be making them again!!!

After multiple tries these finally turned out good.  I must say, egg whites are very temperamental.  Once I mastered my technique they were actually quite easy to make.  I beat the egg whited until frothy (30s) then added the cream of tartar and salt.  I then continued to beat them and added the sugar just a little at a time while I kept the mixer on.  I folded in approx. 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract at the end.  I used a ziploc bag snipped at the corner to pipe perfect little mounds onto parchment paper.  Just before putting in the oven I sprinkled a little crushed candy on top.  They turned out light and airy with the perfect hint of peppermint.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making every year for Christmas.

These were very easy and good! I didn't have candy canes (I know...bizzare at Christmas) so I used 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract instead. They were just minty enough! I piped little drops out of a piping bag, so I got a lot of little meringues. I think next time I'll dip the bottoms in chocolate.

My best tip for an even easier recipe: Make these as the last of your baking at night. Preheat the oven to 350. Put the cookies in, shut the oven door, TURN OFF the oven, go to bed. In the morning they are perfect.

I also recommend a large ziplock bag with the corner cut to squeeze out kiss shapes. Use a large bag because it's messy if you have to refill. 

I had soft peppermint candy that I crushed and folded in at the end, and it's delicious. I have also had this recipe with nuts and chocolate chips. You can mix in whatever you desire if you fold it in gently at the end.

These came out perfectly...followed recipe exactly. I see that some people add peppermint extract - don't do that, the peppermint oil can collapse the egg whites and your meringues could fall. I snipped the corner of a Ziploc bag and used that to pipe the meringues. P.S. Thought I'd add this, since I've read that some people have had difficulty crushing the candy canes: I place both candy canes (unwrapped in a ziploc bag), then place a kitchen towel over the bag & crush the candy canes with an ice crusher (using the smooth side, not the 'sharp'/'pointy' side that is used to crush ice).

These were wonderful.  I made two batches yesterday, one with peppermint like the recipe-except that I stirred some in and sprinkled some on top; and a second batch with lemon zest sprinkled with sugar (omitted the peppermints).  Both came out beautifully, and they're nearly gone.  Will use again . . . and again

Here are some of the mistakes I made: 

1) don't used the 225 degree oven for an hour and a half, It took me 3 tries to get the oven temp adjusted so they wouldn't burn and be soggy in the middle, I used 175 for 1 hour 15 minutes with a 15 minute cool down. (my cookies were about the size of a vanilla wafer (bit size basically) and this worked perfectly)
2) Don't use aluminum foil, parchment paper worked much better
3) Don't add more than 1/4 teaspoon of any coloring or flavoring, without fail it made the batter runny and I could not pipe the pretty "swirls" like there are in so many of the pictures, of course if your just going to spoon it onto the baking sheet then this won't be a big problem for you but it was for me.

Overall, I give this recipe 2 stars because it took me 3 batches to make the proper adjustments and the cooking temperature was way off

Very easy to make..despite my pipping fiasco.  I tried using a pipping bag but found it oh so difficult to get the merinque inside the bag.  Though I doubled the recipe, I lost a bit of the batter due to the mess.  I ultimately ended up using a spoon - which is a tad more difficult in trying to make them uniformly attractive.  I will try again with a large plastic bag (so I can seal up the batter) and snip a corner. I used a touch of red food coloring to give a candy cane swipe of color thoughout the cookie - very pretty with the dusting of crushed candy canes.  I may try to add a touch of green food coloring next time (w/ the red).

I put chocolate chips, small m&m's,  toffee pieces, or pecan pieces in these. They are so easy and  are usually the first to fly off my cookie trays. Also food coloring to go with the holiday.

I don't really have anything to compare these to, as I've never had a meringue before, but these are just lovely. I was intimidated and hesitant to make them, but they looked so cute and who doesn't want a low-fat treat? I wasn't quite sure if I'd beat my egg whites enough, so I kept going for a few more minutes (probably 12-15 in all) and they turned out perfectly. I thought about adding peppermint extract as others said they had done, but I'm glad I didn't. The crushed candy canes on top were just the right amount of mint for this sweet treat. I can't wait to make variations of this; these are definitely going on my cookie trays next year. :)

I was in the mood for some meringues, and these guys delivered!  Yum!  I was kind of worried because it was fairly humid out, but they were fine.  I added a few drops of peppermint extract and some vanilla extract.  The candy topping was quite festive.  I'm going to make these for christmas.  One batch made probably 50 1 inch cookies.  I piped them onto the foil-lined pan with a ziploc, but I plan on getting a star tip to make them extra fancy for the holidays.

I made these with Splenda (less than 1/2 cup) in two batches... one peppermint extract and one coconut flavoring, neither with candy. Put mini chips on top of the coconut ones. They taste great, but getting them off the foil intact was nearly impossible. Parchment would probably work better.

These taste great and are very versatile.
I've subbed toffee bits for the peppermint-so good. Also, this can be made with Splenda instead of sugar if you want to cut even more carbs.

I had no cream of tartar so instead I used 1/4 teaspoon of lime juice. Whipped up perfectly in 5-10 minutes. I was worried at first because it was only bubbly, but a bit of patience got it to a very silky and fluffy consistency. I also added less than 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Following the tips in another meringue recipe, I piped them from a cut ziploc bag, on a greased and lightly floured foil sheet lining a baking tray. The meringues came off easily and were very tasty! 
What I like about this food is how easy they are to tweak- I topped mine with crushed oreos, hot cocoa powder, cinnamon, and shredded coconut (separately of course) instead of peppermints. Trying other candies, colors, and extracts next time!

This is one of my favorite recipes--pretty, no fail, and very easy if you follow a few tips:  Bring the egg whites to room temp before starting. Make sure to use a metal or glass bowl. If adding peppermint extract, I use 1/4 tsp. and fold in gently after the stiff peaks form. I pipe the meringues onto two parchment-covered baking sheets using a 1M star cake decorating tip. It helps to have someone hold open the decorating bag while you fill it with meringue, which is very sticky. Put the sheets on two oven racks, and switch them after 45 mins.  These store well, but do not store in a container with other cookies, or the meringues will absorb the moisture and become soft. If serving with other cookies, place them out just before serving so they remain dry. I made the mistake of putting them with other cookies on a gift cookie platter, and they became soft quickly. Happy baking!

I have always been afraid of trying to make meringue but they turned out wonderful - in spite of a rainy winter day!  I folded ¼ tsp of peppermint in at the very end and used a quart size bag to make well over 50 bite size treats. I did 1 pan in the 225 oven just as the directions say and for the other I preheated an oven to 350 and turned it off right after I put my pan in. Both pans taste the same and are light and crispy. Very excited to find this simple treat!

This is a fantastic meringue recipe! This recipe is a go to for me when my family for meringues. I usually add a drop of red or green food coloring to make it look festive.  I'm only 11 and they are still amazing for me to make on my own! ... thanks Kathy!

This was my first attempt at meringues (well second since I screwed up the first batch!), and it turned out pretty well. I did add the peppermint extract as other people suggested (only 1/2 tsp) and you definitely have to fold it in after everything else is done or you will screw it up like I did the first time. They were really good though!

This is delicious, perfect meringue.  I ended up making this recipe because I ended up with 8 egg whites from a soup I was making and thought it was wasteful to throw out the eggs.  The slow cook on these is perfect in the oven.  I ended up adding a splash of peppermint extract since I didn't have candy canes on hand (all in all maybe 1/4 tsp of peppermint).  This resulted in a definite peppermint flavor that wasn't overwhelming -- more like a butter mint.  I ended up with 50 or so meringues -- but I was making them rather large (1.5" to 2") and they cooked perfectly.

This was a really good recipe to add to my holiday collection!  Although I did make some changes (I like to personalize recipes). 
1. Eggs room temperature (Try putting them in a bowl of warm water.  Someone else suggested this and it was a very smart way to speed up the process) 
2. I use parchment paper on a light cookie sheet.  
3. After whipping in a machine I folded in a bit of extract.  I used 1/4 teaspoon almond this time, but vanilla and peppermint would be just as good.  
4. I didn't use the crushed peppermint, however I believe that folding them in with the meringue is a good idea.  
5. I used the old sandwhich bag as a piping bag trick to create perfectly sized treats.  
6. Because mine were rather small I only baked roughly an hour. 
7. I then turned off the over and left them in for half an hour. Then I went and cracked the oven open for another half an hour and Viola! 
Beautiful Meringues!!

Loved making these for Christmas, they came out so cute, little Disneyland Matterhorns. I recently made them again a couple of days ago with orange zest instead of the crushed candy canes. Completely changed it and some have said it was better than the peppermint ones since they weren't big fans of the mint. I will always be making this but substituting the candy canes with zests and other things to get different results. :)

I was very surprised at the amount of peppermint flavor without having to add any kind of extract. I think I baked mine a little bit too long as they got a bit brown, but the inside didn't burn, so they still tasted fantastic. Might just become a Christmas staple. :)

I love these meringues, and always make them around the holiday season.  I add a few drops of peppermint extract, always. I have never had a problem doubling the recipe, and today I tripled it without issue. When doubling, I have not changed the bake time. We'll see how it works for the triple.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and they came out hard (I even had help with the meringue part, since I had never done it before). Didn't taste nearly as good as I had imagined. :(

This was the first time I had made meringues so I will still give this recipe 5 stars. I couldn't get to the firm peak stage. But I didn't let my eggs sit at room temp, which I forgot to do. However, even though my meringues weren't as fluffy, these were still very tasty. I added a little green food coloring. They had plenty of peppermint flavor with just the peppermint sprinkled on them.

These turned out light and melted in your mouth. Would love to make them again. Caution, cut way back on the peppermint, everyone thought it was overwhelming (and I even reduced it to begin with).

Could not stop eating these delicious cookies! Love how they were so easy to make. I doubled the recipe with no problems. I left them in the mixer for almost 5 minutes until it was extra stiff. Then placed in a ziploc bag, cut a hole, and dropped onto cookie sheet.

These were a perfect light option on the holiday sweets table.  I added 1/8 t. of peppermint extract to the mixure.  Baked for 90 minutes then turned the oven off and left them inside as the oven cooled. Then after they had cooled I melted dark chocolate chips and drizzled over the tops.  Yummy.

Oh my!  These little things are addictive! I mixed as directed, but folded some crushed peppermint into the mixture before piping them onto parchment paper.  I baked them exactly 1 1/2 hours and cooled them in the oven with the door ajar for 1 hour.  Perfect!

I have made meringues before, but for whatever reason I was not able to get the stiff peaks.  So, rather than starting over i just went with it.  I poured the meringue on to a cookie sheet so that it spread to a thin sheet and cooked it according to the recipe.  After it cooled I broke it up like peanut brittle and diped the pieces half way into chocolate.  This was a wonderfull solution for my failed mixing!

The recipe/directions alone I would probably give 3 stars. With just adding about 1/4 tsp. of peppermint extract I would give them 4 stars. Also, the meringues can be much prettier by just piping them through a baggie. Nothing to difficult. I used Andes peppermint baking chips that I had on hand instead of candy canes, and I added just a couple drops of green food coloring. That turned out fine.

I made these today and they turned out delicious. However they were barely starting to brown after only 1/2 an hour... so I turned my oven down to 170 and that seemed to solve the problem. They also weren't the prettiest, partially my fault, I was having issues with my piping bag, and the spoon drop wasn't working too well either. They are very tasty though and I will be making more and trying to pipe them differently. Thanks for sharing such a sweet and simple recipe! I didn't change a thing except the baking temp.

These are simple & so very good.  I have
made Lemon Meringue Drops using lemon extract
and yellow food coloring. Delicious!  And have used rose extract and red food coloring to make
them pink. It has to be Extract not rose water, it's
not the same. I had trouble finding mine it is made
by Star Kay White, Inc. I also use it instead of vanilla for some sugar cookies & sprinkle them with red or pink sugar.  They taste like roses smell.

I do not like peppermint but my family really liked these. I didn't use candycanes because all I had were the round mints but they turned out the same. I also added red food coloring, chocolate chips to the top and colored sugar crystals before baking. I used the Chocolate Meringue recipe from this site where it only takes 25 minutes. Worked the same and turned out great. I would suggest trying that recipe, too. I LOVED IT.

This was my first time making a meringue, but it looked so simple - I had to try it!  They were done moments after I opened the oven to let them cool.  Next time I will mix the candycane in, as the pieces melted on the sheet.  Soooo yummy!  I can't wait to try other kinds!

Easy!  Japanese eggs are a little smaller than American Large, so I used 3 egg whites.  Since I had 12 egg whites from another recipe left over, I made one batch w/ 1/2t. peppermint extract and green food coloring; one batch with 1/2t. almond essence (white); one with 1/2t. lemon extract and yellow food coloring; and the last with cocoa powder for chocolate.  By placing the wax paper sheets directly on the oven racks, I was able to bake two batches at once.  Now I'm giving out multi-flavored gift zip-locks.

The meringues are my son's favorite cookies -I've been making them for over 30 years. Instead of putting in the candy cane, put in 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. You can use the chocolate chip version all year round. Enjoy!I'm going to make some peppermint ones right now.

Typical meringue recipe - quick to make and easy. Like the idea of addding peppermint extract. However, doesn't make anywhere near 48 unless they are very small.

These are fantastic!  Not to mention easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did use parchment paper instead of foil and the cookies popped right off.  I also used an icing bag and tip and piped the cookies out instead of spooning them out.  I will definitely be making these again in the future.

These were tasty! The only thing i didn't understand was why they were somewhat hollow inside. It was as if they kinda deflated and I followed the directions to a tee. But will mess around with different toppings next time for a unique taste!. Good recipe.

I made these with Splenda (well, okay, off-brand Splenda) and they did set up.  The batter was not as thick as normal meringue batter, but I used a ziplock baggie to drop them and they managed to keep their shape fairly well.  Rather than sprinkle the candy canes on top, I just ground them finely in a food processor, and added them after the sugar.  The meringues got a nice, pale pink color, and the peppermint was a nice hint of flavor, not overwhelming.

These. Are. Delicious!!!  I made a triple batch tonight so that the kids could take some to school for their Christmas parties.  I'm now making another triple batch since my husband and kids ate so much of the first round! I added 1 tsp peppermint extract to the triple batch and topped with crushed chocolate mint candy canes.  YUM!

I would add the peppermint extract & food colloring to the sugar and mix well, before adding to the beaten egg whites.  sometimes additives to egg whites will keep them from beating up properly.  Also, if you chill the bowl and beaters for an hour before beating the egg whites, it will go faster.

These were awesome! I added them to the gift of Christmas treats that I gave to friends and family and they were a great addition to all the other rich treats I made. I altered the recipe slightly by adding peppermint extract. I followed the suggestions and folded the extract in after the egg whites were whipped. I didn't do that the first time and the egg whites fell flat. It doesn't seem like the recipe makes as much as it says, but it really does. I also put the mixture in a baggie, cut the corner, and piped it through onto the wax paper and each one came out beautiful.

The taste was ok - made better by the crushed candy cane ... but the texture really was like styrofoam.  I didn't believe the other reviewers before I made them.  

But they look nice and very easy to make - so good for a party.

Taste great and look beautiful. Careful what size you make though, I made mine too large and only ended up with 1 dozen.

Everyone loved these meringues!!  They were very easy to make and they didn't stick around for very long.  This will definitely be added to my Christmas cookie list :)

I added peppermint extract to the eggwhite mix and it gave the cookies a great flavor. This recipe was a big hit.

These cookies are absolutely fantastic!!!  The make up so easily I was finished in a few minutes.  I did leave out the crushed candy and instead mixed a 1/4 cup of crushed semi-sweet choc. chips in.  Delicious and as light as air!  You HAVE to try these!

Turned out beautifully. If you're not having success with this recipe, beating the eggs thoroughly with a mixer so you cannot see any foam bubbles before you add the sugar is a must. Other wise your meringue will not hold it's form well, and may brown when cooking. Don't skip out the tartaric acid and salt, it stabilises the egg whites and helps it to keep it's shape. If you don't have tartaric acid, substitute an equal amount of lemon juice or white vinegar.

My grandma's Golden Cookie recipe is a sugar cookie recipe that only uses the egg yolks. As I made a full batch, I had 5 egg whites (would have been six but one ended up on the counter...). So I adjusted this recipe for 5 whites but despaired a little when I saw another reviewer said it hadn't 'fluffed' when she had doubled it. But I kept at it with my hand mixer's whisk attachment, it probably took at least 20 minutes. I also added cinnamon extract as my husband does not like peppermint.
I cook with gas, so I don't know if that made a difference, or if my little ziploc bag piped out meringues were too small (they're pretty small), but they did brown.
Now that I've done it once, I won't be so afraid to try these again!

This was great! I didn't use peppermint, but did everything else as follows EXCEPT that I left them in the oven for two hours. I turned the oven off after 2 hours and left them in until cooled.  I also added some fun by making little piles of mini chocolate chips and piping the meringue over the chocolate, so the meringues came out "chocolate filled" and cute.

I had high hopes for these cookies and they looked good--I followed the directions, of course.  But after 90 minutes they were far from dry.  After two hours, they were still gummy.  At 2 1/2 hours I gave up.   I hate wasting time and ingredients!

I added a few drops of peppermint extract when beating the egg whites.  We piped them out with a decorating tip.  We crushed some peppermints in a bag and then ran them through the food processor for almost powdery bits.  I tried the first one too soon (maybe 30 minutes after turning off the oven) -- it wasn't completely dry inside.  So I closed the oven and let them sit a few hours.  When I came back and tried again, they were perfect!  It was my daughter's first time trying meringues.  At first she was like, "Meh."  But she tried again after dinner and decided she loved them!  

These are easy, have a great texture, and are pretty.  They feel like a special treat!

Great recipe! I followed the original recipe and these came out great. Even my picky boyfriend loved them. I think I prefer them a little less sweet so I would use less sugar next time.

I made this with the peppermint extract substitution as suggested by another reviewer.  They were amazing!!!!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing xoxoxoxoxoxo
--------------------------------------------------------------
ETA:  I make these as a Gluten-Free treat for my mom.  I finely chopped up by hand a handful of Gluten-Free chocolate chips and added them in towards the end of the mixing. Thin and flaky pieces worked fine and didn't effect anything but the taste! They were the perfect Mint Chocolate Chip version :)

I added a touch of pink coloring and about 1/8th of a tsp peppermint extract.  It only made 30 meringues, but they came out beautifully!  everyone loved them.  I will added peppermint stick at Christmas time!  :)

This is SUCH a great base recipe I gave it 5 stars.... I haven't used actual crushed peppermint (too scared it will fall), so I use peppermint extract instead.  I've used other extracts with fantastic results as well... it just depends what I have on hand (vanilla, almond, etc.) and even added finely shaved chocolate once.  Yum!  These make wonderful and easy sweet treats for holidays and special occassions... just make sure you wait for a low-humidity day and store them in airtight containers or they will get chewy very fast.  I usually fill a storage baggie with the mixture (carefully), and then I cut off a corner so I can squeeze out pretty little dollops about 2 inches in diameter.  Works great! One other note: the cream of tartar isn't necessary in my experience... works just as well without.

Turned out great.  Placed a toasted blanched almond at the bottom and skipped the peppermint part.  Also made them a little bigger so had to cook for about 20 minutes longer.

The recipe was easy and just adding a sprinkle of smashed candy canes to the top was perfect!  My coworkers ate them all up.  I am interested to try them again with crushed cinnamon imperials for Valentine's Day.

These were pretty good, but not what I had expected.  I followed the recipe, but they just didn't taste the way I thought they would.  They were pretty, but seemed to lack something.  I may try them again, and do as some of the reviews suggested by adding flavor to the meringue rather than relying on the candy cane.  Thanks for sharing.

The meringue never formed stiff peeks. I went ahead and made them anyways but they were hard and very dry. I would not recommend this recipe. I ended up calling my Aunt, she had a great recipe that came out wonderfully.

I made this recipe twice. Both times I left out the peppermint, piped them onto the wax paper with a number 1M tip (and parchment bag). Then sprinkled them with sugar sprinkles (which hold their shape better then most decorating sprinkles). This gave them a nice little sparkle. They went faster then any other dessert at our parties. I will defiantly do this again, maybe add a some jello...(for color and flavor). You can substitute for meringue powder (found at most cake decorating supply stores) for egg whites.

Tasty little bites of yumminess. Next time, I would like to add some peppermint extract to give it a little more flavor. Also, I think I would like to pipe these into swirls for a better presentation.

Fantastic - I was a little worried as I've never made meringue before. I followed the recipe except added 2 drips of green food coloring and 1/2 tsp peppermint extract while I was beating it. I followed other reviewers suggestions for warming the eggs in warm water before beginning and using a plastic baggie with the corner cut off to pipe it onto parchment paper. Cooked for 1.5 hrs, then left in oven with door cracked for another 1 hr. Melt in your mouth deliciousness! Will DEFINITELY make again.

The first time I made them, they came out completely overdone and burnt. I thought maybe it was my oven, so I turned down the temp to 200, but even then the second batch was starting to brown slightly after only half an hour. I caught them and they were ok, but not fantastic.

Add chocolate chips to this recipe. May also add food coloring.  Switch vanilla or almond extract for the peppermint. These cookies do not work well on a humid day. They will not set up. They may be also left in the oven all night after turning it off.

Awesome recipe!  I took another person's advice and added a few drops of green food coloring as soon as soft peaks formed.  After I got stiff peaks, I folded in some mini chocolate chips and peppermint extract.  If you like mint chocolate chip ice cream, then you'll LOVE these.  I left them in my oven for an hour to cool with the door closed because our house is cold. :)

I have had a similar recipe that ws lost many years ago.  Then I found this one and it is just as wonderful, if not better, than the original one that I had.  Takes food coloring really well.  I have also used chocolte chips, mini's seem to worki the best, as well as butterscotch and with an assortment of finely chopped nuts.  ALL  have turned out quite well and greatly enjoyed by all who have received them during the holidays.

I added a little red food colouring, peppermint essence and stirred in some of the crushed candy cane to the egg white just before spooning onto cookie sheet.  Just as well they are fat free because they are just addictive.

I learned the hard way...DO NOT USE PRE-PACKAGED EGG WHITES.   Something about them just doesn't work.   I used an 1/8 tsp each of peppermint flavoring and green food coloring, then sprinkled green decorative sugar over the top.   I haven't tasted them, but they look great.   I also recommend  that you use a bag the corner cut off to put on the cookie sheets.   The spooning method isn't as pretty.

I didn't like the way these left meringues...they're supposed to be dry.  A moist meringue is a sticky meringue.  But if that's how you like yours, this is a rare recipe for you!

It was probably my error, but these did not work for me. Everything was going smoothly until after they set in the oven for a few hours and I checked them. The top pulled right off the bottom. :( They didn't work for my office treat tray, but the taste was wonderful! May have been too humid.

These were great. Instead of the candy canes, I used 2 drops of peppermint extract and green food coloring. Perfect.

Will make these again.  Did add 1 drop of red food coloring and 1-2 drops of peppermint flavor since I didn't use the crushed peppermint.  Used sprinkles instead.  By adding the liquid I may have needed to beat the meringue longer, but it was stiff and went onto the parchment paper fine.  Used a parchment bag with the tip cut out to form the meringue.  Once baked they didn't have a high peak any more which was probably due to the added liquid.  They were extremely light with a soft crunch.

Recipe was great!  Not sure why it says 5 hours to make.  I cooked them for 1.5 hours and then took them right out and ate them.  Yummy.  Only made about 15 large ones.

It took 3 times to get this right but it really was "the charm".  The first 2 times, I used peppermint extract and both times, the fluffy egg whites deflated and took on a shiny appearance.  The didn't cook right (flat instead of fluffy) and tasted more dense than meringue should.  The third time, I made it without the extract and they came out perfectly.  It was the only difference between the first and second, and then third, time.  I highly recommend this recipe but only WITHOUT any add-ins like the peppermint extract.

My only complaint would be there is no WAY this makes 48 meringues. I *doubled* the recipe and got about 30 silver dollar sized meringues out of it. However, yield issues aside, I think this is a great recipe! The instructions are clear, the flavor is good, it's simple and easy and makes great meringues. I made it several times and each time, the egg whites fell when I added the sugar, but it didn't seem to affect the finished product. The 'batter' got thick, smooth and glossy like taffy, and it was ready to go. They turned out perfect!

Great recipe.  I have also made this recipe fruity.  Instead of adding peppermint in the end, I whipped in 2 single serving sugar-free drink powers (raspberry-lemonade is my favorite).  Same recipe, but something tangy for summer!

One time I made these by putting all of the ingredients in the bowl right from the startl, whipping into peaks and cooking, and they turned out awful.  It is very important to first whip the eggs, salt and tartar, AND THEN add the sugar.  Huge difference.

I have also tried using this recipe with Splenda, and didn't have good results.

I did a test batch of these because I wasn't sure how they'd turn out. I am not a big, big fan of squishy meringue. These were great! There is so much you can do! This time I played around and made a few vanilla mint, just vanilla, chocolate chipped, different colors, different sizes, and different shapes. Very cool. I am going to figure out something cute for my daughter's class on Friday.

These were excellent!  I crushed my candy canes in the mini processor so they were like powder and folded them into the meringue instead of on top, which gave a lovely peppermint taste all through them.  I also added a few drop of food coloring to make them pink for valentines day.  Will definately make these again, thanks!

These are probably the easiest cookies to make and very very good!  You know they're ready to pipe out when the "batter" is super sticky and glossy (almost the consistency of marshmallow creme).  I followed the recipe exactly and used a piping bag to pipe out little hershey's kisses sized cookies onto my cookie sheet.  I also used parchment paper instead of foil and they slid off very easily without the use of a spatula.

These were amazing! I made another recipe and it was a complete flop - this one is awesome. The trick is to whip them ALL the way - they should be glossy and bright white. I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract to the  egg whites AFTER they were completely whipped. I crushed a candy cade to fine powder and sprinkled it over the top - delish!

Everyone I gave these to said that they only time they had every heard of meringue was in lemon meringue pie, which got me thinking. So, I made them another way - egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, and sugar beat up like the recipe says... and then I folded in 3 drops of yellow food coloring and 1/2 tsp lemon extract. They taste and look like little lemon meringues!

These are really yummy.  Besides the 1.5 hour baking time, they're super easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and it gave me about 70 meringues.  I didn't follow the one inch apart rule...they don't expand when you bake them, so I just put them as close as possible to save room on the cookie sheet.  I used my coffee grinder to crush the peppermint candies (I used the little round ones because that's what I had on hand) and it turned into a pretty pink powder that I dusted on top.  they make great little holiday treats.

Quick, easy, pretty, & tasty!  Following advice of another reviewer, I brought eggs to room temp in warm water to speed the beating process (took me about 3-5 minutes in my dry climate).  The first time I made these I piped the shapes from a ziplock bag (VERY messy); the second time I used a dessert decorating tool (not quite as messy but a little time consuming). At the end of the second attempt, I scooped up the last of the mixture with a spoon and plunked it on the cooking sheet -- and that shape was almost indistinguishable from those that took a lot more work.  I put the meringues in the oven at 225 for an hour, then turned off the heat and let them sit all night.  Perfect texture.  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe!

Fantastic is an understatement for these. The measurements are perfect....one and a half hours baking time is accurate...its all just right.
What i did do different was to add peppermint extract (just 1/2 tsp). What must be kept in mind is, ADD THE EXTRACT ONLY AT THE END AFTER achieving the STIFF PEAKS. Only FOLD in the extract DO NOT BEAT IT IN!!
I made one batch with red and green coloured sugar sprinkled over the meringue before putting them in for baking.
For my second batch, I made 1 Milk Chocolate Chip over each meringue and sprinkled with green and red sugar before baking them.
I skipped the crushed candy....but I don't think anyone really missed them though i definitely will use candies the next time!Thanks a tonne Kathy!!
UPDATE:25/12/2009: These need their equal heat so for a medium sized oven, putting two batches of these together into the oven isn't advisable as the batch closer to the top/bottom doesn't turn out quite right!
But otherwise, a perfect recipe to work with.

So easy, so good and gone SO fast. My 2-year-old loved them and now I'll be making these for little treats all the time (just her size if I make 45-50). I followed the recipe exactly and next time will take others' suggestions and experiment with chocolate chips, food color and extracts. Thanks!

These are great. It did take me a little while to beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, and I don't think they were necessarily stiff, but they turned out great. I added 3 drops of peppermint extract (I like stuff minty), green food coloring, chocolate chips and I opted to sprinkle the crushed candy cane on top. My husband's opinion: "I did not expect this type of cookie to have this much flavor and taste this good, can you make more?" It's a keeper!

I really liked these.  Folded in about 1/2 a tablespoon of finely crushed candy cane and that was just enough to give them a slight minty flavor, any more would have been too much.  Mine came out light as air and not chewy at all.  I put them in a large mason jar and a bow around it with several pieces of red and green taffeta ribbon for a thank you gift.  She said they looked too good to eat.  I think they make a great gift, if you can manage to give them away before you eat them all.  I got about two dozen out of the recipe.

Very easy.. I added a couple drops of peppermint extract for Holiday flavor. I also folded in mini chocolate chips to the 2nd half of the meringue. These were a big hit with my 3 yr old as well as my husband. They're very similar to the meringues that I would get at the Konditori (bakery) in Sweden. They would drizzle dark chocolate over the meringue tops, which was also very yummy. These go great with coffee or hot cocoa.

Very good meringues! I didn't have candy canes and didn't really want to use them, so I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract instead. They turned out perfectly peppermint-y and are a great holiday treat.
Also, wait until the egg whites are room temperature to beat - it really cuts down the beating time.

This is a great easy recipe! I made these for in baskets of goodies for christmas gifts, and I had to make a second batch because I can't stop eating them!  I did add a few drops of peppermint extract as others suggested and a couple drops is all you need! I used a pastry bag with a star point and they are beautiful.  The batch also doubled up very well.  Also use parchment paper, they come off so easy.

These were wonderful!  I took the advice about adding peppermint extract - wow!!  I added 3 drops, and it was perfect.  Try and fit all the meringues on one cookie sheet or else bake them in batches - I put 2 cookie sheets in the oven, and the sheet on the bottom got too brown.  I put the candy canes/peppermints in the food processor to crush them, but it made too much 'dust,' so I think next time I'll crush some in a plastic bag with the back of a knife.  One more thing, I didn't think these tasted as good after they had been stored - I'm going to serve them fresh after making.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked these espcially knowing these are a sweet yet healthy alternative to other cookies and sweets. I made exactly as the recipe and they turned out great. I also used a piping bag to ensure uniform sizes.

Super sweet!  I added 6 drops of green food coloring and 1/8 tsp. of peppermint extract.  I didn't add the candy canes because they were minty enough already.  A very easy recipe.

These did not turn out well at all! The fault might have been mine, however, or maybe my eggs were old.... but my meringues would not whip, and therefor held no shape and ended up looking like big globs of white. They're still cooling, but we'll do a taste test soon... maybe (hopefully) they'll taste better than they look! Good luck.

These were easy to make and are delicious. My only "complaint" is that they're kind of dangerous, in that I could easily sit there and eat a dozen of them without thinking about it.

The candy canes give a surprising amount of mint flavor. The texture of the finished cookie is crunchy, but then melts in your mouth. The only change I made was that I added a few drops of food coloring, which worked just fine.

Yummy Christmas treat!  Theses are super easy to make and look really pretty to give out around the holidays.  I used an icing back with a star tip to drop my meringues onto the cookie sheet, and they turned out really pretty!  It was also WAY easier than trying to spoon them out - just be careful not to overfill your bags because it will squeeze out the top of the bag and make a sticky mess.   If you don't have an icing bag, you can use a ziplock bag.  Trust me - it's much better this way.  I also put parchment paper on my cookie sheet and clean up was super easy!

I added a drop of peppermint extract into the whites and this recipe came out great. It's essential to get soft peaks before adding the sugar and then achieve proper stiff peaks once sugar is incorporated. I also recommend making sure that you have no yolk in the white, a very clean mixing bowl, and that all of the ingredients as well as hardware are at room temp. This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing.

These were so easy and pretty.  I piped mine with a pastry bag then sprinkled crushed candy canes on them.  I did add the teeniest amount of extract to the first batch and I wish I hadn't.  It gave them a weird aftertaste.  The others were fine and melted in your mouth.

Super easy and wonderful !  If you had problems check a couple of things. Before separating  your eggs soak the whole egg in warm water so when you crack them the white will be at room temperature allowing it to whip up easily. When you add your sugar do it at soft peak and when you are at stiff peak rub a bit on your fingers . If you can still feel the sugar continue beating until there is no more sugar feel. My oven runs hot so I bake at 200 degrees for 2 hours. Happy Baking

Tried this recipe based on reviews.  I followed direction exactly and got far fewer cookies even though I made them small.  Also the bake time of 90minutes is too much or recommend temperature to high.  My oven seems true with other recipies.  I was going to try another batch but my husband tasted them and said not to bother.

I had two egg whites to use up so I thought I’d make these for the holidays.  I added a drop of red food coloring just to add a little festive color.  They came out beautifully, and are very sweet, perfect for your candy or cookie platter.

Turned out perfectly! I did add a little bit of mint extract (like 1/8 teasp.) I don't understand how anyone wouldn't like them if you like mint! Different strokes for different folks I guess! lol

These are THE MOST DELICIOUS MERINGUE COOKIES EVER!!! When I first made them on heist as Eve I didn't use parchment paper or non-stick spray (they stuck to the pan) but the cookies that I got off tasted delicious. The 2nd time around I used butter and it was perfect. I didn't use the peppermint. One of the most delicious cookies I've ever had. Thanks!!

O. M. G.  Yay!!!!  What a great recipe!!!  I don't think I have ever tried a meringue, and man was I missing out!!  I didn't have candy canes on hand, so I added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract, with some red food colour gel, once the eggs had beaten to soft peaks.  I piped them as 1/2" rosettes, and they turned out amazing.  This recipe is super easy, takes very little time to get in the oven, and they are such a wonderful treat to add to the party tables and gift bags!!  A year round regular for me for sure.

The video states use 1/2 tsp salt.. We made per the video and it came out way to salty:(. Make sure only use 1/8 tsp., but did turn out perfect-besides the salt.

I'm making this recipe right now. I squeeze-dried maraschino cherries then minced them. I gently folded in almond extract and the cherries after stiff peaks were reached. I used a gallon zip-lock bag with the tip snipped off. No parchment paper so I'm using the foil as in the recipe. They're so cute! And, so far, look perfect. Can't wait to get them out of the oven to try.

I loved these and they were a hit.  If you add peppermint flavoring remember to NOT use peppermint oil.  The oil will make the whites fall.  Stick to peppermint extract and they will be fine!

I doubled the recipe and piped onto aluminum foil lined cookie sheet (ran out of parchment but the foil worked ok). The double batch made about 60 cookies for me... I piped out about 1-1/2 to 2 Tbsp per cookie.  I added about 1/2 tsp Vanilla per batch.  I baked for 1-1/2 hour as suggested then shut off oven and left in oven overnight (with door closed).  These turned out perfectly. I would suggest a triple or 4x batch to make a good qty of cookies.

Great recipe!
The meringues are wonderfully tasty and I even snatched a few from the oven before they were done.
However, I found it a little bland and chewy, and it took me several times to get it right. Try adding some almond extract for flavor, so dreamy

these were great but I added 1/4 teaspoon of mint and  that seemed like to much. did not use crushed candy. I will not use any mint next time but I am not very fond of mint, prettiest little red white and green stars I did post a picture.

Love this recipe! I have made this exactly as written several times. The key is mixing the meringue until it's stiff and then they are perfect. Reminds me of my great grandmother's meringues as a child.

I rated this 3 stars because it lacked a lot of taste and they were to fragile after cooled. Also, this makes only about twenty SMALL meringues. I suggest adding peppermint extract, mint extract, or vanilla extract. Overall these were not very good.

Perfect!  As always, the keys to meringues are finesse & patience.  Added a *tiny* splash of peppermind extract.  It tasted NOTHING like toothpaste.

Wow this special lil candy cookie as I call it, is fantastic! 

It was and is perfect in every way. It brought me right back to when I was a little girl visiting my Grandmothers house for the holidays. She had every kind of cookie, cakes and pies one could imagine.
I never knew what kind of tasty treat I had I just knew it was magical. Now I know for sure this was it.To say the least it was and is spectacular for sure. 
 
The Peppermint Meringue is to me the best tasting and easiest cookie to make besides our family secret fudge recipe. I will make this every year.

Thank you Kathy.

These are so easy and taste great! I was afraid of the meringue~ but it couldn't have been easier! We tried them because our DD was just diagnosed as Diabetic Type 1. This is her first Christmas with new eating habits and we wanted her to have low carb. treats. We have made them a few times now. Chocolate with Chocolate powder on top is yummy. Almond extract is good too. We are trying lemon extract today. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first attempt at meringues and I have to say they came out amazing. I stopped reading the reviews because I wanted to form my own opinion. I doubled the recipe because I was making a bunch as gifts so I wanted to have plenty. Yes, you have to beat the mix for a looonnnggg time to get the stiff white peaks but it's worth it when your meringues come out the perfect shape! I got so many compliments on these from my co-workers and friends that I am about to make another batch to bring home to my family for the holidays. They are a delicious, light treat and I find the mint stops you from eating a ton of them, like I always want to do with chocolate chip cookies!

I lost my original recipe and am happy to have found this one.  My recipe called for peppermint pieces to be added to the meringue.  I like the idea of add choco chips because I use those for raspberry meringue kisses.  LOVE everyone's ideas to alter the recipe just a smidge!

Let me add this - it is such an easy  recipe - as one stated, the secret is to keep whipping until very stiff peaks form (just like whipping cream) and that sugar is dissolved, and add ingredients after whipping.  Chilled bowl and beaters also may help.

This was my first time making meringue cookies. It would have helped had the recipe had some specific information as to what to look for/how long to beat a meringue. I kind of guessed. They taste really good! I made the little Hershey's kiss sized ones and they got brown. :( Still delicious though!

Definitely added green food coloring and 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract at the very end of the process. Doing so sooner will prevent the eggs from stiffening.

Delicious result though!

These peppermint Meringues are so delicious and light you can literally eat a tone of them. This recipe instructs you to spoon them on to your cookie sheet but I found it to be much easier and faster to put the batter into a pastry bag and you get perfect sizes with a perfect peak each time. So simple!

These were awesome.  The only drawback is it takes up oven time and space for so long I can't leave or make anything else till these are completely cooled total of an hr after I turned the oven off.  Everyone loved them.

It is important to note that the eggs must be at room temp. prior to beating. Also the serving size is incorrect. I think it should be 18 not 48. My husband really loved these treats. I used peppermint sugar sprinkles on top instead of candy canes and they looked beautiful.

The recipe was easy to prepare and I got them onto the trays just fine, but I had  problem with the cooking time. I checked after about 45 minutes and they were all browned and about to burn! I re-read the recipe and I think I did it right, keep the oven on while cooking, but the time just seemed way off. If I make these again, will definitely adjust the time for cooking :(

These are awesome! I made a batch for a office meeting and ate so many I had to bake another batch. Super easy to make. I added peppermint oil to the mix. Next time I will try almond extract.

Thank you for this great recipe, I added 1/8 tsp orange extract (I was going for a fall taste/look) while adding sugar, I did add a teensy bit more sugar to compensate. Turned out beautiful!

This recipe was simple enough, but I really didn't care for the meringues, didn't have much taste even adding the peppermint.  Not high on my list to make again.

Delicious but I have no idea how the recipe says it can make so many. I got about 1/2 the amount. They were still great though.

Even after reading the reviews, it took me three times to get it right.  1st time I added the sugar too early - didn't stiffen up but still cooked up fine.  2nd time I added peppermint extract at the end - that one I had to throw out.  3rd time was a charm, although I tried to use a decorative tip inside the ziploc bag and that was just too much effort.  I also found that 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract was plenty for me.  Now that I've got it down, I think it will be easy to replicate next time.

Sooooo good! I made these as part of my Christmas cookies this year. I do recommend storing them away from other cookies (especially the moister ones) in order to maintain their texture. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Great recipe. I would like to warn people about using peppermint extract, however. I only added 1/8 teaspoon of peppermint extract to the egg white mixture, and it was overpowering. I dipped the bottoms of the meringues in white chocolate and thankfully it balanced out the intense mint flavor and turned out delicious. But be careful with the peppermint extract!

This is the easiest and best recipe I have made this year.  I have made 3 batches and they last only a few minutes!  I make them right before bed and then leave them in the oven to harden.  In the morning they are perfect.

Yummy.  Low-calorie. I made mine w/out salt (not by choice ) and w/out an electric mixer (we don't have one) and they were flat!  They look like cookies not hershey's kisses...  They were really yummy though!

Was on the search for a meringue cookie recipe when I came across this one. I jus pulled them off the cookie sheet and I must say I am VERY pleased!!! I left out the candy canes cause I'm not a fan of peppermint but I did sprinkle the tops of them with coarse sugar. My search is over, these are a winner!!!

This was a very simple recipe, I've wanted to try making meringues for a while now, and this was perfect.  I followed the directions exactly, and they turned out perfect!  I used a plastic pastry bag with the tip cut off to pipe them onto parchment paper.  I didn't really pay attention to the time, I just tested the biggest, fattest one, and when that one was done, I knew the rest were, lol.  Now I can't stop eating them, they melt in your mouth!

As stated before, very quick to whip up and easy. I added 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract and sprinkled some colored sugar on top. For those having problems with the eggs whipping up correctly, you have to be careful not to get any yolk in the whites or you won't get the stiff peaks you need. These sound very easy to add different ingredients to change the taste.

So Easy!  Great for the holidays and as a "healthier" (it's all relative) dessert than most.  I added 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract, and might add a bit just a few drops next time. I thought it tasted quite good, with excellent taste and an even better consistency.  My mom thought they kind of tasted like toothpaste.
Tip for the candycanes:  Put them into a ziplock plastic bag, pound them into fragments, and then pour them on top of the meringues.

Wow, I've never made meringue except for pie, this is easy and very tasty. As soon as the first batch has cooled (I had to try one before it was ready) I'm making a second batch for neighbors. I piped them out af a plastic bag, and I know the second batch will look even nicer now that I have practiced. 
I didn't change a thing, and they are pepperminty enough without adding peppermint extract as some did.

These are perfect! Easy, simple, and well-liked. I used a plastic bag to make hershey kiss-sized meringues. Warning: These meringues are very addictive.

I really enjoyed making these meringues. I followed the directions as given and piped them onto the baking sheet using the ziplock method some other reviewers suggested. Maybe I made mine slightly larger as I got about 25 rather than the 48. These little meringues are light as air and almost melt in your mouth. I need to find a better way to crush the candy canes. I thought a food processor would turn them into an unidentifiable dust so I chopped them into very small pieces with a sharp knife. Well..let me tell you - I should have worn safety goggles as many candies became missiles. I'll be finding these little projectiles for months. That being said, the candy cane sprinkles look so pretty against the white of the meringues. I will be making another batch in the next few days before Christmas. These are a wonderful addition to your Christmas cookie trays.

These are amazing!  My first time making them and they turned out *perfect*. I decided to double the batch because they looked so cute. I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the 2nd half of the batch. Mmm mmm delicious. What a great idea. You don't need to add any extra peppermint - the crushed candy is just right - seems like adding any would make it too overpowered with mint.  Someone mentioned they left their egg whites out at room temperature. You don't want to do that. Egg whites always have to be cold. And make sure you don't get any Yolk in the whites or they won't whip up like they're supposed to. I let them sit in the oven with the door ajar when they were done, for 90 minutes. I used parchment paper instead of foil and they came right up. While putting them away I kept popping "just one more" in my mouth. haha  5 Stars. :)

These were great!!  I followed the recipe to a T...except I didn't have peppermint candies, but I did make another recipe from the site last week called Hard Rock Candy in watermelon flavored so I used some of the crumbs from that and it was just as wonderful.  Don't know why some others had problems with this unless they didn't mix long enough to for the really stiff peaks.  I'm so thankful for my Kitchen Aid mixer!!  Thanks for sharing.
(edited 12/24/2008) I made these again on Christmas Eve and didn't sprinkle them with anything, but did add about a teaspoon of vanilla once they reached stiff peaks and they came out awesome.  I also used a piping bag and large tip which went much faster than spooning out the cookies.  This is a great cookie to make with creme brulee as one uses the yokes and this one uses the whites.

Amazing recipe! So easy to make and the meringues were delicious.  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and added half a cup of chocolate chips. The meringues were the perfect flavor - just enough peppermint and chocolate.

I liked using this recipe as a starting point.
I ended up using peppermint hot chocolate mix for flavoring instead of candy canes.

Have made a varieation of this with 1 Tbs cocoa, 1/4 Tsp vanilla, and  and mini chips instead.  Really great!!  The styrofoam texture has to do with baking time and/or humidity.

Light, airy, and delicious. I was inspired to make these after I heard one of my friends (who was eating a store bought meringue at the time) say "You can make Meringues!?" These are much better than the store bought ones, and so easy and cheap to make! Next time, I'd like to try adding chocolate.

OH man! I have never attempted anything involving meringue, but these looked way too cute and yummy to pass up. They were simple and easy to make, the hardest part for me was separating the egg-whites. 
I put the meringue in an icing bag and squirted them out on the foiled cookie sheet using the largest star tip I could find. Then I  sprinkled red sugar on top of them before putting on the crushed candy cane.
Magnifique Meringues!!!

i think its best to follow the recipe to the T! i made the mistake of adding half a teaspoon of mint extract (too much) and baking the meringues for only 25 minutes and leave it in the oven overnite. it came out chewy and too minty. tastes like chewing gum. but my mum loves it :)

Wonderful recipe. You can make many variations with this. Great just the way they are too! I recently skipped the salt and the candy canes and made 3 different flavors for my daughter's princess party. We added 1/2 tsp. of pure vanilla extract to one batch, 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the 2nd batch, and 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract to the 3rd batch. We added pink gel food coloring to some and purple to others. Before we put them in the oven we sprinkled them with pink and purple colored sugar. They were a huge hit! The kids loved making these and eating them. Fun! Other variations: mix some of the crushed candy canes right in the cookie mix before baking, or mix in lemon juice, or chocolate chips, or nuts, etc. I have also baked these at 250 for 1 hour and then turn the oven off and leave the oven door closed for 10 more minutes before removing. Perfect!

Wow!  How fun these are! I wouldn't change a thing. Apparantly, as I was told by a farmer I know, in the old days they called meringues "Calf Slobber".  The peppermint on top gives it enough peppermint flavor where you don't need to add any extract.  Also I don't know how you could make 4 dozen out of this.  I made them about the size of a whole pecan and barely got 3 dozen calf slobber.

My family can't get enough of these things. I have made two double batches in the past week. We have given some away and kept some for ourselves. 
I added a little bit of hot chocolate mix to the tops. The first time I made them I left them in the oven overnight because of other reviewers suggestions. The last time I made them I took them out after an hour and a half and they taste just the same. 
Great recipe!!!!!

This is a great reciped and so easy.  Like other reviewers I used peppermint extract.  I just took it from there and tried all different kinds of flavors.  the best one so far was using vanilla with the mini-chocolate chips.  I've shared them with everyone at work and family and they all say "they just melt in your mouth."

I add mini chocolate chips to balance out the peppermint flavor.  These are a nice, unique addition to the regular holiday cookies, and everyone who has tried them has gone back for more.  My boyfriend calls them space cookies because they are so light. :)

These meringues were a little difficult. I followed the recipe and only made 20, so I had to make another batch. Also they are a little blan, some peppermint oil needs to be added or chocolate chips. I baked the first batch 1hr and 15 min and they got too brown, so I only cooked my 2nd batch an hour and they were a little better.

These were soooo good.  I tried to mix by hand because I always do and found out the hard way that--yes you need a mixer to mix egg whites!!  Well, after breaking my arm off [whisking] trying to make it fluffy, I baked it, and yes they were flat but were still good.  Use the mixer!

Everyone absolutely LOVED these cookies!  I gave them to friends as pre-Christmas gifts with other cookies and these were by far the faves.  I used candy canes that were red, green AND  had chocolate in them so they really had a diverse flavor and color and were super attractive.  I will be making these again and again.  LOL- my biggest hang-up in making these was waiting for a not super humid day!!

They were kind of weird and styrofoamy, but once you got past the texture, they were pretty good. I like the peppermint addition, it gave them some added flavor and my boyfriend loved it.

Next time I will experiment with other additions as well, different types of chopped up candy might be good. :)

These were fun to make and they turned out very well-a light and fluffy dessert:)  They go very well with a good cup of coffee or hot cocoa:)

I thought this was a very good recipe.  They are just like the ones my mom used to make when I was a kid.  These cookies were easy to make and tasted very good.  I think next time I will try making them with mini chocolate chips.  I was also wondering if the cookies could be baked at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time.

This was ok once you tasted them. I couldn't get anybody to taste them because they all said it felt like styrofoam. The flavor was good, I might try them again in miniature size,maybe the size of hersheys kisses.

I got rave reviews on these this holiday season!  Before baking, I put the mini chocolate chips on top, in addition to the crushed peppermint like one reader suggested, and this was labor intensive but worth the effort. These treats actually melt in your mouth.

I make this recipe every Christmas to rave reviews.  Easy to make, plus it's one of the few cookie recipes that isn't filled with calories.  I fold in 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips at the same time as the crushed peppermint.  The chocolate really gives the cookie great flavor.  Try it!

Everyone who tasted these loved them!  I used an icing bag and tip to get uniform sizes and added grated choclate to the peppermint candy topping.  They were pretty enough for gifts.
I found the recipe only makes about 32 not 48 as stated.

Consistency was great , nice peaks when I piped them. After an hour in the oven mine turned golden brown. I'll try again, but at 200 degrees instead of 225.

Super simple recipe for a relatively easy cookie, if a bit time consuming baking them. Follow the directions as written and be sure to use parchment paper and not foil for any kind of cookie, clean up is just easier. I made a vanilla and peppermint flavored meringue and it tasted well before I baked them, so hopefully it’s just the right blend. The first batch I made was a trial run as I’ve never made these before. While they turned out perfectly, I did not overly like the sorta buttery taste they had; I think this new bath will be perfect. I even added crushed peppermint to them as well. Sorry no pic as they’re currently in the oven cooling off.

Easy to do if you follow general meringue making rules. I used a piping bag to make the shape of peppermint kisses which turned out to be fun and pretty.

This is a fun recipe for the holidays!  
My changes were:
1.  Amount.  I was making these to bring to a holiday party so I quadrupled the recipe.  I had too much for two baking sheets and one oven so next time will only triple.
2.  Flavor.  I added peppermint extract part way thru the sugar being beaten in.  I only added 1/4 teaspoon and it made my quadrupled recipe minty!
3.  I made full size meringue cookies but next time would do bite size/kisses because they are pretty messy to bite into.

I made it for a cookie exchange. Using just the crushed peppermint  sticks provided just the right amount sweetness and flavor.  Very easy to make beautiful fancy cookies with a pastry bag and star tip.

I love these! My family has requested I make them again around Christmas. Word of warning, if you have a gas oven, take about 10 minutes off the stated cook time, and if you want to make a lot of them (in a decent size) you'll have to double the recipe. That being said, these are amazing!

Next time I would do half the sugar, the recipe says it makes more than is does when I made them it yielded about 30. I suggest adding the salt and cream of tartar one you start to see very light peaks instead of right away. I let mine cool in the oven without the door open and it gave them a nice crunch! My new favourite meringue recipe!

The dough came out loose for me (couldn't get stiff peaks). I researched and found it's recommended to use 1/2tsp cream of tarter for 2 eggs. That saved it! Added 1/4tsp peppermint oil and mini chocolate chips on top. Great!

First time making meringue.  Made them per recipe after playing with when NOT to put in peppermint extract.  As one contributor indicated, wait until after you have stiff peaks before adding anything.   In the end, I added crushed candy canes.  And, sprinkled with crushed candy canes.  Turned them a little pink.  But just a tad.  Will give them as part of Christmas gifts for neighbors.  Husband says they taste great.

Phenomenal meringue cookie!! My first time making meringue, and I didn’t read the recipe properly so dumped all my sugar in with the rest of the ingredients and it was too wet. Second time around was infinitely better, and I got the stiff peaks by slow incorporation. I didn’t use crushed candy cane, but I did incorporate 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract as another reviewer did, and that’s literally all you need. I folded it in at the very end w/ a soft spatula as I was traumatized it would fall from the first time, but nope! All good. I put a semi-sweet chocolate chip on half the cookies, just to see if they were any better than the plain (YES!! All were good, but the chocolate ones were over-the-top GOOD!), and then dusted peppermint hot cocoa on top. I tried a couple techniques suggested  for getting my cookies onto my parchment-paper-lined tray: did the cut corner from Ziploc bag trick and it produced nice looking cookies but it was a mess; 2nd was spoon-drop method and that was less messy but a little harder to get my stiff meringue to come off the spoon. I powered thru though, and then did the turn on the oven to preheat at 350 deal, shut off the oven and let them do their thing overnight, PERFECT!! This was so addictive at my dinner party that I could’ve eaten all of them by myself!! Will definitely make again.... THANK you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Definitely will make again. I did add a few drops of peppermint oil to the meringue when it was between soft and stiff peaks. The flavor was even better. Next time i may try them with cinnamon oil.

These turned out pretty nice.  Only issue is that I printed out the recipe and on the print out it doesn't indicate the number of servings. I ended up with about 24 meringues which needed to be cooked a little longer than if they were 1/2 the size.   I ended up leaving the oven door closed after I turned it off and they came out nice and light.

Only my 2nd experience making meringue. I did my research with the first on a lemon pie and achieved success. Unfortunately, this recipe failed. The few ingredients, just a few steps, and simple video made it appear easy. And it was up until we checked them in the oven after a half hour. Already turning brown!! I quickly removed them and then searched through the reviews to find out what I did wrong. Another wrong move; by the time I learned that I should have double checked oven temp, the cute little peaks had sunk! Lessons learned: my gas oven must be too hot so will put on low instead of 225 next time, probably shouldn't quadruple a recipe that then makes more than you have pans or will fit in your oven because then you have to bake for an hour and a half, choose a recipe without discrepancies (video calls for 1/8 tsp cream of tartar but recipe says 1/2 tsp) and with a little more instructions or warnings of what not to do, check the weather-it rained a little on the day I chose.  I did use a quart of real egg whites at room temp and that worked out well-no worry about getting some yolk in there. I wonder about using peppermint essential oil as I don't have any extract; I suppose that might make them flop. Anyway, will probably try these again since they are gluten free and low fat, also pretty; will make them smaller, compare multiple recipes, and hope that with a little more  practice they will turn out like they should and become a favorite.

Interesting, in the video it says 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar. The recipe calls for 1/8 teaspoon of each. I used 1/8 teaspoon. Will see how they turn out. I am editing my re Ken and rating. These turned out fantastic! Since there is a discrepancy between the video and the recipe, I would recommend following the recipe. Also, I noticed none of the reviews mentioned an incredibly important detail. These should be made on a clear day, not humid. If it is snowing, I strongly suggest waiting.

I'm not a baker, but followed the recipe exactly. (Got smart and put the candy canes into a ziplock bag to crush with my trusty little hammer.)  I did heaping spoonfuls onto the tinfoil, sprinkled generously the peppermint candy and crossed my fingers.  BEST light and airy, yet one little bite of chewiness cookie ever!   I was shocked given the simple ingredients.

I read a lot of the reviews first and even other recipes for meringue cookies. Virtually all say room temperature egg whites. I used almond extract for flavoring, (not mint fans) gallon ziploc for piping onto parchment lined, air bake cookie sheet, red decorating sugar to top. Took suggestions of a few others to pipe in a Hershey’s kiss size/shape. Made 80 this size. Quantity depends entirely on size of the cookie. It’s a breeze mixing these up in your KitchenAid mixer. I turned the oven off at 1 hour and let them sit in the oven until until the oven was cool. This was a test batch, my plan is to try white chocolate raspberry for flavoring. I am feeling confident enough now to try them. Thanks for the great recipe, and all the helpful tips!

Only change I made was to use parchment paper instead of tin foil. Surprisingly easy to make (this was my first attempt making meringues with cream of tartar, I've always struggled along with less expensive substitutes before), though I think the author and I have a very different idea of how big a meringue should be lol. I ended up with about 20 rather than 48, but they turned out perfectly and there is a very real possibility that I will end up eating the entire batch myself in one go

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out well! I didn’t stripe the bag with food coloring, but I dipped them in chocolate and then crushed peppermints and that tasted great! They were a big hit. They came out of the oven nice and dry. The only thing is that after a day or so they got sticky- I’m guessing because it was raining and very humid here.

Not sure if my oven was hot but they browned in under an hour. Might be worth adding to the notes a temp range and time range. Followed directions otherwise and had no issues. May try again with a slower oven next time.

Very tasty!! I crushed up several candy canes and just mixed them right in with everything else at the end. It made the meringues a nice colour and they taste amazing, basically like a meringue version of a candy cane! These are very light and airy. This is quite easy to make but not so easy to make the individual meringues. I found the easiest way was to use an icing bag, plus they look way nicer than from a spoon. Just be prepared for it to be messy!

I did make a double batch of these because I had egg whites left after making key lime pie which only used yolks.  I made them bigger and they turned out really great.  I cooked them for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe said because they were bigger and also used almond extract rather than peppermint candy.  They were easy to make and I will make them again.

I made these for the first time yesterday and I did a pretty good job until it came to the baking time. These came out very good still but they cooked for too long. I rated it 5 star because it was my own fault and I am looking forward to trying this again. Thank you for sharing..

I have never made meringues before and these turned out perfect when I followed the recipe exactly. I doubled the recipe with no problems.  I did omit the crushed candy cane and added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract. I then piped them onto parchment paper using red and green food colouring in a ziplock bag to make them look like peppermint candies. Will definitely make these next Christmas. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy! 1st time accidently left out the sugar, baked anyway and added cheese, salt and pepper and served for breakfast. Waste not. . . 2nd try went fine. I placed it on parchment paper, made a "well" with a spoon as I planned to put lemon curd in when ready to serve. (left out peppermint) very tasty, and can play with the recipe.

Perfect, light and airy, so easy to make. I've made these several times now. I've used different flavors such as chocolate chip or a dusting of cocoa powder, but the best by far, is this original recipe with candy canes. Don't need to change a thing, perfect as written. ADDICTIVE!!

For a first-time maker of meringue cookies this recipe was very simple and easy and they came out beautiful.  The first time I made them it took the egg whites forever to get smallpeeks.  I found out if you left the egg whites get to room temperature first it is much quicker.  To get the egg whites to room temperature quickly I put them in the preheating oven for about 60 seconds.

Everyone that's talking about how it went flat after they added oil, just add more cream of tartar until it stiffens. Don't add too much though because it will affect the taste. I added about three drops when I added the sugar and it went flat.  I just added  a little bit more cream of tartar until it started to stiffened and it came out fine. Also use parchment paper. I just made these and put them in the oven. I read through a bunch of reviews and I noticed that some people were struggling with the texture. I decided to keep it at 225°f but check it after an hour. I added crushed peppermint to all of them and a chocolate chip to the top of most of them. I want to use these for after-dinner treat. They look great but I only got 30. I used my icing press with my star tip. These are super easy to make and I've never made meringues before. I'm going to make another batch with red and green to make it more festive.

Definitely start with room temp eggs and add the sugar gradually.  Fold in 1/2 tsp mint extract and  mini chocolate chips after you have peaks. Cook on parchment instead of foil.  I'd like to try sprinkling with cocoa or hot chocolate powder and mixing the crushed candy canes in the meringue  too.  I used 3 egg whites and increased the other ingredients accordingly. The large ziploc for piping worked great a well. Will definitely do again!!!  Yummy!

I had never made meringues before. I did one batch exactly by the recipe and they turned out good. My next batch I set my eggs out to reach room temp and that seemed to work a little better. I also added some green food coloring for a festive look. they turned out wonderfully as well! Also I used a decorators bag with tip to make little star ones.

Very easy.  Very tasty.  Important to grind up the candy canes quite fine.  Small food processor worked well.

First time making meringue anything, so mine didn't turn out perfectly, presentation-wise.  But they still tasted pretty great!  I left them in a little too long, so they were they lightest shade of off-white and were too crunchy on the outside.  But besides that, I'd absolutely use this recipe to make them again.  Oh, I also didn't end up with 48, more like 36.  So I would keep extra ingredients on hand in case you end up needing to make more.  And not a knock on the recipe writer, just a tip for those interested in making them- don't forget that you'll need to time to wait for the ones in the oven to cool down all the way before putting the next batch in.  Double oven for Xmas please!

Followed the directions exactly, and they turned out just right--crispy, smooth, shiny exterior with a soft center that melts in your mouth. I think I'd like it better if the crushed peppermint was folded into the mixture instead of only on top, so I will try that next.

I can't get enough of these. I took the advice of various others, and added a little mint extract and mini chocolate chips, folded in at the end of prep. I also used a Ziploc to make large dollops on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, or they stick terribly to the spoon and your fingers.  I doubled the recipe and made my cookies slightly larger, and then left them in the oven overnight after cooking for the specified amount of time and temperature.  They were perfect in the morning, and melted in my mouth.  Regarding prep, I beat the eggs in my stand mixture at the highest speed for a few minutes, and slowly added the sugar. No plastic bowls or rubberized spatulas, because any hint oil, that can hang on these surfaces, will hinder proper egg peaks.  They're good without added flavor, with some colored sugar sprinkled on top before baking. Excellent! Thank you!

My first time making meringues. While I think I may have beat the egg whites a bit too long (they started to break down), the flavor was excellent! I added a bit of green gel food color and peppermint extract. Will try again soon!

Light, airy, and delicious, and a snap to make. My only complaint is that there was no way I could have gotten 48 out of one batch. Mine all fit on one sheet pan. Maybe mine were too big, but they don't seem like it. Still, fantastic cookies.

Not only did they turn out great but it's a fun recipe to make. I must admit the meringue right out of the mixing bowl was so good I was tempted to eat it all right then, however I exerted some self control and most of it made it to the baking sheets.  I was afraid they might brown in the oven but they didn't. My only advice would be to keep in mind the baking time and start them earlier.

I have made these several times now, and they disappear fast.I  make them with a hershey's kiss in the middle by dropping the kiss into the meringue and using 2 spoons, I scoop the meringue around the kiss so that there are no holes.
The meringue insulates the chocolate and so you bite into the cookie and get a bite of solid chocolate in the centre.
I also add 1/8 teaspoon of peppermint extract to the meringue..
For those having problems with the meringue flattening..you need to use a cold mixing bowl,room temp eggs and whip the meringue for several minutes so that it is very thick when you start.And you need to work fast.

I'm not a great cook/baker, so I was skeptical. I read through the notes and followed some of the tips. 
1. Use parchment paper instead of foil.
2. Warm up the egg whites to room temperature (put the eggs in warm water for 5 min. for a quick fix).
3. Fold in 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract after the batter has been whipped.
It all came out perfectly! These are so light and tasty, I immediately made a second batch. I feel like these would be pretty tiny if you made 48. I'd bank more on getting 30-ish meringues. If I can do it, so can you! I also bet that you can add one to a cup of hot cocoa as a peppermint flavored marshmallow. Dooooo it.

After reading the reviews, I ended up using 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint extract instead of peppermint candy. I made them the size of a Hershey kiss. Just the right size for little kids. My adult daughter raved over them and had me make another batch of them. I added green food coloring and made them look like little Christmas trees and used sprinkles and tiny yellow sprinkle stars for the top of kisses before baking. Oh, I also added mini chocolate chips as someone suggested to give it more of a chocolate mint flavor. I piped the kisses onto a parchment lined cookie sheet using a gallon storage bag with one corner snipped off. Unsure how long to bake, I baked the kisses for an hour. Shut the oven off, no peeking and left them in the oven until they were cool. They slid right off the parchment paper and I stored them in Tupperware loosely like suggested.

So tasty. My first meringue ever. I didn't get 48..But that will depend on how large your make them. My browned slightly on the bottom even though they were larger. Next time I will turn oven off after 1 hour and left them sit in oven with door closed till cooled completely. Also used parchment paper to line trays. These look so festive!

I have now use this recipe twice and both time they turned out perfectly! I was intimidated by meringues after reading all the do's and don'ts when it comes to meringues.  This recipe is definitely going in to mass production for the holidays!

I made these because I had leftover egg whites after making hollandaise.  I didn't use the peppermint, I used 1 tsp cocoa powder to give it just a hint of chocolate flavor. I also had too cook them a lot longer, it may have just been a little more humid than I thought it was.  Then to help finish drying them out (and because I just wanted to go to sleep), I turned the oven off and left them in until the next day.  They were so delicious. The texture was perfect meringue crispness, super light and just perfect.  My kids & husband loved them and could not stop eating them.

I didn't change the base recipe at all, however, I wanted to make them year round and my son isn't really a peppermint fan... So, I went to the local Cracker Barrel and got a bunch of candy sticks in different flavors!  I have also dusted them with a little bit of cocoa powder.  Lots of variety this way.  

Sometimes I make them exactly as the directions say, leaving them in the oven when it is done, other times I want them to be chewy in the middle and I take them out when the oven is done.

Also, I used a plastic bag to pipe them.  The spooning them onto the tray method was giving me more gray hair then my kids!

I've never made meringues before and had no clue what I was doing.  I doubled the recipe since I didn't have a measuring spoon for 1/8 tsp!!  I spooned the meringue mixture onto parchment paper (the ziploc bag trick never works for me) and put the candy canes crushed with a rolling pin on top.  As directed, baked for 1 1/2 hours and then shut the oven off and left the meringues in there.  Came out as expected... good peppermint flavor.  There's not much to meringues, but you know that when you make them :)

Amazing recipe. They cooked perfectly and taste really good. I added a little more than a tablespoon of vanilla to the egg whites before whipping.

Mmmmmm!  I used artificial sugar since 2/3 of my family are diabetic and they loved it. I made them really small, bite size for a kid, to put on top of a pudding I made. (Chocolate Cream Pudding by Mimi on this site)  They are way lighter and more delicate than I thought they would be but I can see why you use a metal spatula to remove them. Even the dogs like them!!

I'll add a photo later.

My first time to make meringues.  They were melt in your mouth good.  The only thing I changed was to mix in the crushed candy instead of putting it on top.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Kathy.

I've been making these for years.  This baking method produced cookies that were nice and crispy - no chewy middle.  Our variation:  I added the Andes Mints chunks and they were wonderful.

These are so good. I used  choc peppermint candy canes on the second batch and the flavor was great. Meringue has a different texture when it is in your mouth and so one daughter that has texture issues found it weird. But everyone else really enjoyed them.

These were so good!  I made one batch pink with green and red crystal sugar sprinkled on and the second batch green. I added peppermint extract to both batches since I didn't have the candy canes.  I spooned out the first batch and used the ziploc bag piping method for the second which was much easier.  Next time I will add some chocolate shavings. There's so much you can do with this recipe to have different flavors, etc. Thanks for the recipe, Kathy!

These are good. Light and fluffy - sort of like a dried marshmallow. My kids like them too. I followed the recipe as written, but might try making these again sometime with raspberry flavoring.

I hadn't made these in several years!  And all because I had egg whites left over from the gingerbread recipe that only required the yolks, I decided to make some for my husband :)  The egg whites whipped up perfectly using my KitchenAid mixer too!  Meringues are so easy to make but they do require a few hours of patience while they "dry out" in the oven!  And yip, I had to taste-test a couple before they were ready ;)  I love these things even when they're not quite dried out.  I do recommend using wax or parchment paper instead of aluminum foil.  They peel right off the paper so easily :)

It tastes great but takes time!  Very easy to make. I used two different brand of food color gel. Found out Cake mate decorating gel affect the texture of meringue. Air bubble are bigger and can't make perfect tip. Beet Crocker food gel is better.  I can easily make curly tip.

We love these and they can be easy. Spinmom's tips are great.
Try leaving half plain then dipping half in melted chocolate and then sprinkling with crushed candy cane.

Great Recipe!  Use only 1/2t of Peppermint extract...  If your in a high altitude, use equal parts of Bakers Sugar(a must for perfect meringue) and sifted Powder Sugar to keep it's hold. Officially that makes it more of a Italian Meringue. To make these Christmas Fancy, I dip the bottoms and base edge into milted White Chocolate and then crushed Peppermint Candy Cane's for that wow factor- a Big Hit!  You can adapt this recipe using vanilla, almond, or raspberry extract and fancy it up with Dark Chocolate and chopped nuts on the bottom or serve plain. No air drafts when cooling...

I have been searching for a really simple and delicious meringue recipe forever and have FINALLY found it! I doubled the recipe, since I've found it difficult to whip less than 3 egg whites in my Kitchenaid. I am going to let you in on a little secret--I used pasteurized liquid egg whites from the carton and they worked BEAUTIFULLY!! I was a bit concerned that the meringues were going to end up gritty because the sugar was so grainy once the mixture was fully whipped. I needn't have worried, as they turned out great! I used 1/8 teaspoon peppermint oil and no candy canes (since I didn't have any) and it was perfectly pepperminty when the meringues were finished baking. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

So easy and delicious.  I used a small cookie scoop (quarter-sized balls) and dropped each on parchment paper then sprinkled with the finely crushed candy canes.  It only made about 20.  We ate the first batch so quick, I had to double the ingredients on this last go around.

mmmmm, these are delicious! and oh so pretty. something different and so easy to prepare for the holiday trays.  I used the star tip of my decorator pro.  Look so so pretty.  I love that these keep so long.  The only change I made is to add a bit of peppermint extract to the meringue itself.

It was great!  I didn't add the candy canes.  I just made "plain" ones and drizzled melted chocolate on them after they were fully cooled.  Yum!  My batch made 40.  :)

Delicious! I made this exactly as written and it was fantastic. The 2nd batch I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and it was even better! I tried them with a light drizzle of chocolate on top and I didn't care for it as much (though I love the combo of choc/mint).

If you enjoy traditional meringues, this is a great twist!

Giving this 4 stars instead of 5 as making the meringue was SO easy and fast!!  Loved that these were in the oven so quickly without a whole lot of clean-up needed!!  I teach cake decorating, so of course, I piped the meringue into beautiful swirls before sprinkling them with the crushed peppermint candy. Unfortunately, a few hours after taking them out of the oven, they became VERY sticky and chewy when they'd initially been just perfect ~ light, crunchy and great flavor! I thought perhaps I'd done something wrong so quickly whipped up another batch......same issue.  A few hours out of the oven and they were just as the first batch.  I tried putting one of the batches back in the oven with the door ajar and that worked great! Then again, a few hours later, they were sticky & chewy.  Now, a few days later, they are not sticky anymore but still a bit chewy melting very quickly instead of sticking to our teeth like glue.  I want to try this recipe again because it was so much fun and so very very easy~ and who doesn't have 2 egg whites in the house when you suddenly need cookies for something or a quick home-made gift or dessert to take along somewhere?  If anyone else had the experience of them turning sticky & chewy please let me know how you resolved it ~ I'd greatly appreciate hearing that ~ my resolution was to just eat them anyway!!

My first time making meringue, and it was so easy!  I added 1/4 tsp peppermint extract after the soft peak stage, and added a teaspoon more sugar to compensate.  My peaks never fell, but I don't live in a humid climate (yay- one perk...).  The peppermint flavour within the meringue is light and complements the crushed candy canes well.  I baked at 225F for 1.5 hours as on the recipe, and only had to cool for an hour before it was dry on the inside.

Wow! Amazing texture, fantastic taste! I folded in 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, and sprinkled on crushed candy canes. It was a nice minty taste - just right, and not too overpowering=) First, but not my last time. =)Thank you for the recipe!

Made these for Christmas last year, was very pleased with them, my family and guests enjoyed them and they looked both dainty and festive on the plate. Have just finished making them again this Christmas and as well as serving them at home are taking them to a large Christmas luncheon tomorrow, am serving them on a plate along with White Chocolate dipped Strawberries.

Easiest time I have ever had working with Meringue.  Put it into a plastic baggie, cut out a corner, and piped it onto parchment paper. (Definitely keep them small so they are single bite sized.)  The crushed peppermint on top gave it wonderful flavor.  Had many positive comments as I watched them dissappear from the plate!

I love this recipe it worked great it three times and put them in gift boxes for my family members. I substituted sugar for Splenda for my diabetic uncle and candy canes with Betty Crockers Decorating Decors Peppermint Sugar. They came out great I will be making them ever year from now on.

My first time making meringues and they turned out well...though 1.5 hours at 225 degrees was a tad too long.  Also, I was able to make only about 30 meringues from this recipe.  This may be my lack of experience with dolloping them out.  But they were tasty!  I will try this again with just vanilla flavor.

Very Good, but difficult to maintain temperature, which is key, in my Mexican oven. Browned slightly which gave them a different flavor. Very sweet, but don't know if reducing sugar is a good idea.

It started out easy  but once all the ingredients were added in the bowl only like 1/4 
of a inch the bottom of the bowl  was full and they didn't even make peaks they were flat disks on a dry day!

Fantastic! I love meringues, but it's so hard to find them in the store, and I've yet to find a recipe I like... but I LOVE this recipe!!  The only difference... I took mine out of the over almost 15 mins earlier.

I didn't have any peppermint, but wanted to add something, so I added some milk chocolate chips (didn't measure it; probably about 1/2 to 3/4 cup).  I can't stop eating them!

I added 1/8 tsp mint extract and a little rose icing paste and piped them into a heart shape with a star tip. Then the bottoms were dipped in white chocolate. The bowl is white chocolate molded in a heart shaped silicone cupcake mold. Big hit at the Valentine Party.

Very easy to make. A++  At first I was having troubles getting the right texture to form, but at the time I was doing it by hand. After a bit I gave up and started to use my Hand Mixer, and it turned out just the way I wanted in minutes.

This recipe took me three tries to get it right.  It drove me crazy!  I personally don't like meringues because they taste like pure sugar, but they're my aunt's favorite and I wanted to make them for her.  It took way too long to whip up to stiff peaks with a handheld mixer.  I followed all the directions every single time, but using my Kitchenaid mixer was the only truly effective appliance for making meringues.  In short, it was way too time-consuming!!

Wonderful cookie recipe!  Low on calories and just the right amount of sweetness.  I used green and red food coloring and swirled the colors.  Don't mix the colors, you want a swirled look and you still want to see the white (kinda like a candy cane).  They looked amazing!

Very sweet, but that's what it's supposed to be.  Add strawberry, anise, almond or almost any other flavor.  Be sure to beat those whites until STIFF not just a  little stiff. After you turn oven off leave unopened for at least 3 hours.

Pretty good.  I wish I had watched them more closely, as they were a little overdone at 90 minutes.  I added about 1/4 teaspoon of peppermint extracted and sprinkled peppermint-flavored sugar crystals on top.  My peppermint-loving son can't stay out of them.  Be sure to follow the instructions to open the oven door and let them cool completely in the oven.  They make a pretty addition to a cookie tray.

Added the peppermint extract and people loved the taste! I felt that they did not puff up as well as they should have. Will try them again. Recipe information should be adjusted to reflect the number that it actually does yield - it's not 48 unless you make them really tiny!!

I don't think I whipped them long enough, I tried to put them in a ziplock with a hole in the corner to pipe them on the baking sheet but they just oozed out...lol...then after baking the recommended time they had the consistency of styrofoam...lol...but the kids still enjoyed them!  Thanks!

I loved this! I added 1/4 tsp peppermint extract to the egg whites. It took a really long time for me to beat the eggs with the sugar to get stiff peaks. I threw the first batch out because I thought I messed up! The second batch came out exactly the same as the first time I did it, I just mixed it much longer than the first time, poured the mixture into a wilton decorating bag and made the meringues. It really does make the amount said when you make them hershey kiss size.

The recipe as is, is not that good. I changed it up and thought it was much better the 4th and 5th time around. First I whipped the eggs and sugar up as directed, I folded in about 1/4 cup chopped chocolate chips. Once I had them squeezed onto the pan, I sprinkled crushed peppermint candy over the top. After I altered the recipe a little they were perfect!

I made meringues once when I was very young and I remember it not going very well...  I thought this recipe was fantastic!  They came out tasting great even though it had soft peaks after adding the sugar.  I am making them again this week and doubling the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great. Keep in mind that these should be bite-sized. About half of mine were on the big side and got a little messy trying to bite into them.

This was my first attempt at meringues, and they turned out wonderful! I preheated the oven to 325 (for a dark cookie sheet), then turned the oven off and put the cookies in. 3 hours later, I had to start the oven back up to 200 degrees for 30 minutes to get them cooked all the way through. I can't wait to try variations on this recipe!

This was my first time ever making a meringue cookie. The kids loved cruching the candy canes. We all liked them but I thought they were a little salty. This may have been user error. I'm going to make another batch and see how they turn out. I got lots of ideas about adapting them for other holidays as well. Thank you.

PERFECT CHRISTMAS TREAT!  I just made these tonight and the recipe was easy and the meringues were excellent!  I did use the a carton of All Whites and it worked for me (I previously read it didn't for another user but I didn't have any problems).  Definitely bring the eggs to room temperature! Only use metal or glass bowls and make sure everything is clean!  Also, adding the crushed peppermint sprinkled on top after you have put the dallop on your cookie sheet makes it taste good and look pretty too.

I completely doubted this recipe until the second I took a bite. I followed the recipe exactly and never did get the correctly-formed meringue; mine was thicker and heavy, and not forming peaks well. I decided to just go with it and used the plastic bag to make little kisses on the foil. Mine were very small, about an inch diameter, and I got roughly 60 meringues. I had no idea if they would turn out okay, since my meringue was so heavy - but I just ate one and WOW! The texture is like "space ice cream" if you know what that is. I am going to make another batch right now!

Love this recipe!!!  Its so cheap and makes so many.  Its also very versatile.  I made it as directed, with just vanilla, with chocolate chips and peppermint, and with food coloring.  The batch I made with vanilla and crushed candy cane reminded me of those soft peppermints.  So good.. I'm making more as we speak.

Would not recommend adding peppermint flavoring. I added it to the soft peak egg whites on the first batch, and it went to soup. Tried again without the flavoring, and it seemed to go better. I never got to stiff peak stage, though, and I suspect it is because I used All-Whites.  My husband noticed after the fact that the box says they don't do well in meringues or angel food cake. Definitely use real eggs, and separate to get the whites.  I still baked the second batch (got about 25 pieces), and they are tasty with a nice crunch, even though they are cookie-shaped.

Great recipe! I also want to make a comment about what someone else wrote, just in case it ets lost in the suffle of reviews- DO NOT USE SPLENDA- it will not work at all!

I took these tasty treats a step further and dipped the bottoms in chocolate! There were wonderful!

Very easy!  I am on Weight Watchers and these Meringues are 0 points!  My other W.W. co-workers loved them.  It's great to have a sweet treat without worrying about gaining weight!!!  Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I will be making these again tonight!

These were great!  They were my first experience making meringues, and very easy.  I did have to scrap my first batch b/c I did it with the egg whites at room temperature and the cookies collapsed in the oven.  Once I did it with eggs straight from the freezer, they were great.  Also delish with 1 Tbspn hot chocolate mixed in.  Will definitely be experimenting with this one!

I was reading other peoples reviews on these and they talk about how the texture is light and airy - mine came out really hard and not airy at all! I follwed the recipe and they literally sound like glass rubbing together when they touch each other!

These were really good! My first ever tasting and making meringue cookies. I make butter cookies during the holidays and it's perfect to use up the left egg whites. They were airy and light and delicious! I added about 3/8 tsp of peppermint extract after I was done beating them. I baked as directed and tried them right after (not waiting overnight to try them), they were delicious! Thanks for such a good recipe, I will definitely be making this frequently.

Instead of making little Hershey kiss like merengues, I made 10 giant ones and also folded some of the crushed candy into the batter... It worked out just the same and they are wonderful. I left the salt out however, because I don't find it to add anything but "saltiness" to the end flavor. I liked what one reviewer said about making little Christmas trees, so I might try that next!

Instead of using crushed candy canes to make them peppermint, I made them orange-chocolate. I used a little cocoa powder,  orange extract, and some mini chocolate chips.
 Light and crunchy. These were good, but I wasn't crazy about them.

Very easy recipe! :D

I unfortunately didn't have cream of tartar at hand but I used a few drops of lemon juice as a substitute and my meringues came out just fine. 

I was a bit confused about the amount. I *did not* get 48 meringues out of this batch. I made at most, 12. o.O

Otherwise, thanks for great recipe!

This is the first time I made meringue, so not much to compare it to, but these were good. Instead of candy cane, I added 2 TBLS of gourmet peppermint hot chocolate mix(the kind with the real shavings of chocolate and peppermint oil). Refreshing and light.  Melt in your mouth. I think I need to beat it a little longer as cookies kind of "fell" in the oven.

Tasted these before, but never made them.  When you say beat until stiff peaks form and many comment on the length of time that it takes, can you be more specific? 8, 10, 15 or more than 20 minutes.  I have never had good luck making just plain meringue for pie for this reason, so I am hesitating to try this recipe though I know they are EXCELLENT tasting.  I only have a hand mixer and I know that does make a difference.  Thanks.

These came out beautifully!  They were so easy to make and the recipe produced a light, airy meringue.  I doubled the recipe with no problem and they were gone in no time.  I have several family members who don't like peppermint, so I tried one of the chocolate meringue recipes here, but it failed miserably.  Next time I will add cocoa powder to this recipe instead and see how that turns out.

I made these with half a cup of mini chocolate chips and half a teaspoon of peppermint extract.  I added green food coloring and sprinkled a little bit of crushed candy cane on top--they were amazing!  They were snapped up as fast as I could put them out!

These were great.  Our store ran out of candy canes, so I crushed Starlight mints and mixed them in with about 1 tsp peppermint extract.  We made ours pink.  Ours set just fine despite the moisture in the air.  They only lasted a day... they were just superb... Thanks for the recipe... I think I'll try them again with other flavors... maybe amaretto... yum!!!

So easy.  I can't stop making them.  I made one batch with Deb El Just Whites (powdered egg whites) and my Kitchen Aid mixer--they are HUGE and delicious.  I also made a batch with real egg whites and my hand mixer-- they are good, but not as super puffy.  Be extra generous with the peppermint, as well as with the hot chocolate if you want to make some cocoa ones. The extra flavor will help people not used to meringues get past the new texture.

The only reason why I'm giving this recipe a 4 stars is because this is the first time I've made Meringues so I don't have anything to compare it to.  

I made them exactly how the recipe presented and they tasted wonderful.  I thought the candy on top added the perfect light peppermint accent to these meringues.  I had no problem with with them browning or with the texture.  The one piece of advice I would give when making this is to whip more than what you expect to.  When I thought the whites were done I whipped them on high for a minute or two longer.  I did the same with the final mixture and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never done any kind of baking but these were very easy to make!  I beat the egg whites by hand.  It took a while for them to stiffen but they came out perfect.  I added mini-chocolate chips to some and they were even more delicious.  I'm already planning on trying other versions of this recipe.  Thanks!

I love using up extra egg whites by making these but can never get anyone to eat them.  I added pink food coloring and used the crushed peppermint and chocolate combination on top and they looked great, but still no takers.  I'll use again and maybe add some peppermint flavoring.

Not much to them. Got too hard on the outside, and didn't make very many. I'd skip it
