Correction: Instead of a 12 oz bag, it should read up to 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips to be sprinkled over the top of batter. Bake for 12 - 15 min if using brownie pans and 25-30 if using 9X13 or until toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean. Sorry about the mistake. Lizbeth

These were really pretty bad. Way too heavy on the chocolate chips, and 12 - 15 min? You have GOT to be kidding! I baked them for 30 min and they were still raw and doughy throughout. Don't waste your time on this one, there are lots of other choices.

This recipe needed some adjustments. I added 1/2tsp of salt and only put 1 cup of chocolate chips on top. No pecans either. I also baked it in the oven at 350 F for 22-25 mins.  Turned out great.
Yummy!!!

I thought it was really simply to make, and my boyfriend said they were very tasty! I bumped up the temp to 350 degrees and baked for about 20-25 minutes, and they baked all the way through. I also only put in 1 cup of chocolate chips and that was plenty.

I took the suggestions of changing the temperature/time and just eyeballed the chocolate chips and they turned out pretty delicious. I don't like regular brownies, so these were a really nice substitute. :]

I could not get the center to cook at all, no matter how long I left it in the oven, if you like raw dough it was OK, but I tried to make for a party and you can't serve raw brownies for a party.

These were ok, not the best.  Yes, way too many chocolate chips... and where does it say you need pecans?  It was in the directions but not the ingredients...?  Had to cook a little longer, i have nevermade a brownie that didnt take at least 25 mins if not more! Not exactly what i was looking for, but still good

This recipe was delicious.  I made it exactly the way it is written.  I used the full bag of chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate chips).  I didn't think it was too much chocolate.  I did, however, have to bake it much longer.  I probably baked it 22 to 25 minutes.  This was delicious right out of oven.

This recipe wasn't bad. I didn't have any baking powder so I substituted molasses in instead. They came out more like cookies than brownies.

Not a bad recipe just not what I expected. The consistency was like a banana bread, just without the flavor. I made a chocolate sauce and made marble brownies instead of using the chips, but I wish I would have used the chips instead just for more flavor. More like a thick cake than a chewy brownie.

I just made this recipe and I thought it tasted very good. My oven cooks fast but I still had to cook them for 20 minutes. The timing is off but IT IS BASED ON YOUR OVEN. what takes normally 20 minutes could take 12-15 minutes for me. These were very good and I don't think any recipe is bad, it just needs adjustments.

I have never come across a bad recipe on here until this one.  The temperature and timing are way off.  I put in one cup of butterscotch mixed with chocolate chips in and but still could not disguise the blandness of the actual brownie flavor.  If you want a good brownie recipe, this is not the one.

These are great! The only thing I'll do differently next time is to add about 1/2 tsp of salt. Also, I used butter when I made these yesterday, but I think I may try margarine, just to see if it makes much of a difference.  But as written, this recipe makes nice chewy blond brownies. Warning: the batter is VERY thick — I actually used my hands to get it pressed into the pan evenly.  Thanks for sharing, Lizbeth!

These came out so soft for me that I had to put them in the fridge for the night to harden so I could cut them up.  Also, there are way too many chocolate chips.  It was almost unbearably sweet.  Finally, at the end of the recipe, I just noticed it says to put pecans on the top, except pecans aren't mentioned in the ingredients.  I may try this again, but will modify quite a bit.

I thought this was the perfect blonde brownie recipe. Other recipes required extensive sifting, but not this one. It was very easy and quick to put together....I had it prepared in a little over 5 minutes and was eating brownies within about 30 minutes. It's very important that you note the UPDATE from the creator of the recipe. She made a note under the reviews about how many chocolate chips to use and how long to bake. If you follow her altered instructions, the recipe is perfect. Good flavor, and a really good consistency. Mine turned out a little gooey like brownies, but still cakelike. I made them in a 9x13 pan and baked for 28 minutes total. Any longer than that, and the edges would have been too done. 28 minutes was perfect. I added this to my recipe box, and I'll def make again!!

Very easy to make; something to whip up when you have limited ingredients.  I did add 1/2 tsp of salt.  And I am certain the time is off on this, should be at 35 min. at least.  Just sprinkled on the chocolate chips, instead of the 2 cups.  All in all...tasty~

I was glad I had read the review which gave the correct amounts-allrecipes really needs to let it be edited. That said- my husband asked me to NOT make them again. He said they were " nothing special" and as they are still in the container a week after making...

This was a pleasant surprise. I didn't change anything major but my son had a sudden craving for blondies so I had to make do with what we had.  I used real butter instead of margarine and self-rising flour instead of all purpose (so I omitted the salt and baking powder)  I didn't have any chocolate chips, but otherwise I used all the other ingredients as listed.  I also don't always read instructions so I just dumped everything together and started mixing.  I thought it was going to be a terrible disaster because the batter was a sticky, gooey mess and didn't pour well at all.  It didn't even fully cover the bottom of the 9x13 pan.  I baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes and then reduced it to 325 for 7 more minutes.  Surprise! It was the most smooth and evenly golden pan of blondies I had ever seen!  They weren't quite as sweet I would like..probably because I had no chocolate chips.  If you make them without the chips, you should probably add a little more sugar.  It's a keeper but I will use chocolate chips or M&Ms next time.

This recipe is awful, I wish I had read these reviews before I attempted it.  The dough was entirely too sticky so I tried adding a little bit of milk.  I had wanted to layer cherries in the middle but there was barely enough dough to cover the bottom of the pan, let alone save any for a top layer.  25 minutes in the center's barely baked so I'm bumping it up to 350.  I will never make this recipe again.  :(

This recipe was delicious! We put in a mixture of butterscotch and chocolate chips and it was great. the batter tends to be very thick, and it is important to spread it evenly in the pan so it cooks evenly. I also cooked the blondies for 30 minutes instead of 15 because they were still a bit mushy at 15 minutes. Instead of just sprinkling the butterscotch & chocolate chips on the top, we also mixed them in with the batter.

I've made these twice now and I pretty sure the first time I goofed and used 1 cup of white sugar as well as 1 cup of brown sugar, but I've decided I like it better that way.  I did not measure the chips or nuts, just sprinkled an amount I thought was sufficient and the brownies were really good.
