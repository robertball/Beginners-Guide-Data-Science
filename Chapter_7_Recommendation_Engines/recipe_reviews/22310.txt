I made this cake for hubby's birthday and it was terrific!! 

To lower the calorie count, I used a can of diet 7up when making the cake. This replaces all the other ingredients in baking the cake; no, water, oil, eggs; just the 7up and the cake mix.

You use light color soda for light cakes and dark color soda for dark cakes. 

Everything else I did the same except I used fat free pudding and milk.

This was OUTSTANDING and no one even knew I used fat free products!!! I filled 7 requests for this recipe.

Excellent! I loved the flavor. It wasn't too sweet or too lemony...just right. I used two 8" round pans and stacked them. I put holes in the bottom layer and poured a bit of the gelitin mix, then stacked the top layer and did the same. It turned out great and looked so pretty on the table!

Oh man.  Prepare your taste buds for a taste explosion; this recipe rocks the house.  I am decidely NOT a cake fan, but after this recipe, I may change my tune.  It's the perfect desert for a hot summer evening - light, creamy, lemony and delicious!  This cake is so moist it will melt in your mouth.  The lemon gelatin must be the secret; it baths the inside of the cake with the perfect lemon flavor.  And that topping - sheesh -so simple, yet so good.  Do it!  This one is off the charts.

This is excellent. I have a recipe for something similar called a "poke" cake - you can substitute the lemon cake with white or yellow cake, the lemon pudding with vanilla pudding and the lemon jello with strawberry or other berry jello and end up with something tasting a lot like strawberry shortcake without the fuss.

Oh, wow!  My boyfriend and I just made this cake tonight.  We followed the directions exactly and it's just wonderful.  Next time I may add two packages of lemon Jell-o to the top of the cake or maybe two packages of lemon pudding to the frosting mixture, just to make it even better.  I also may experiment with allowing the Jell-o to set a bit before pouring it over the cake so it really can get into the holes instead of just seeping into the cake.  In any case, we'll be making this a lot- it will be wonderful to lighten things up a bit during our long Alaska winters- and plan to experiment with different flavor combinations.  Next up: white cake with strawberry Jell-o on top and cheesecake pudding in the frosting!

A very moist cake. I added a tsp. of lemon extract, a tblsp. of fresh lemon juice, and the zest of one lemon to both the cake batter and the frosting. If you are looking for a cake with a "zing," this is not it. It is a very light lemon flavor. I did the bundt cake method. If you do that also, be sure to grease and flour your bundt pan generously. Allow the bundt pan to cool on a cooling rack for no more than 5 minutes, and flip the cake onto your serving platter while it is still hot. Instead of a wooden spoon, I used a drinking straw to make numerous holes all over the top and sides of the cake. Use a hand mixer to make the frosting almost to a pudding consistency. I sprinkled lavender sugar over the top right before serving, which was very pretty. I'm looking forward to trying all the different flavor combos suggested in other reviews.

I'm not sure why this recipe has gotten so many good ratings. It tastes like a boxed cake mix with whipped cream on top. I was looking for something easy and different and chose this recipe but was very disappointed. The jello does not saturate the cake and as a result only some bites are lemony and moist. The other bites taste just like a lemon cake mix which reminds me of pine sol. I found the frosting to be bland. I took this cake to a get together at a park and no one said a word about it and I took half of it home. So, needless to say, this will not make it into my recipe box.

This cake was very good, just the right amount of lemmon flavor and very light.  I would make it again.

My husband loved this cake!  The icing is not too sweet.  I added a teaspoon of lemon extract to the dissolved jello, it added a little extra lemon flavor to the cake.  It was great, I will make it again sometime.

This was fabulous!  I was skeptical, as I typically make my cakes from scratch since ALL box cakes contain hydrogenated oils (I've actually looked while shopping!)  Glad I gave this a try!  I omitted the oil in the cake altogether & just used applesauce instead since I knew it would be “drenched” with the hot Jello.  I added lemon extract and lemon zest to the cake to give it more oomph.  Baked in a Bundt pan.  After pouring on the Jello, I refrigerated overnight since I was bringing it to the office the next morning, then frosted once completely chilled.  For the frosting, I replaced the vanilla extract with lemon extract.  Let the frosting “set” a few minutes to thicken so I could actually frost the cake (rather than just pour it on.)  I think the cold cake helped the pudding in this set, as well.  I topped the frosting with toasted coconut, and I’m calling this the ZINGER cake!  Was a hit among co-workers and can’t wait to make again using other flavor combos!  Nice flavor – not a heavy dessert!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  The lemon flavor was bright, but very sweet, not tart.  The cake was very moist. It still had that "packaged cake mix" taste to it, but the trade-off is how easy the cake is to make.

This cake is outstanding!  I made it for my sister's bridal shower and everyone loved it. I used light cool whip for the icing and the low-fat directions on the cake box. The lemon flavor is not too strong and the cake is very moist.

I used lime jello instead of lemon so that you can see the stripes when you slice the cake (pretty!).  For the topping, I prefer Dream Whip brand (doesn't have that "Cool Whip" artificial taste so much).  I followed the recipe on the box, which calls for 1 1/2 cups of milk, instead of 1 cup in this recipe.  Garnish with twisted lemon and lime slices.  Delicious!

This cake is so easy--and very delicious! I added about 2 tbsp of lemon extract to the frosting because it wasn't lemony enough for my liking. But the cake itself was moist and very flavorful. Make sure you grease or spray the bottom of the pan - the cake will stick to it (could be because of the jello). I made this in a 9x13" glass pan and it still came out great. Everyone at work loved it, and I will definitely be making this again!

This is a crowd pleaser!!!! I call this my cheating cake because everything comes from boxes...It has a homemade taste but quick and easy to make. Just follow the directions and everyone will love it. I love the way the pudding becomes a lemon moose instead of a frosting. I have made chocolate moose on the side, using these ingredients, instant chocolate pudding mix, vanilla, and milk. Amazing what you can do with instant pudding.

This is a very nice recipe.  I made it for Mother's Day and everyone raved.  I was skeptical because of the mix and "Non Scratch" style, but it was so easy and delicious, I soon forgot about that.  This would be great for any Spring or Summer event.

Everyone really liked this cake; especially the frosting part.  Very easy, foolproof, and I will make again.  I used extra creamy whipped topping.  It was a big hit and a few asked for the recipe.

This cake was very easy and delicious. I used a Lemon box cake from Duncan Hines and instead of water I used milk and I also added a tsp of orange extract, (I had no lemon on hand). The icing was the best thing of all, We could have eaten it by itself. Thanks for the recipe.

fantastic!  this cake is sooooooo good.  the topping would be great alone.  i shared half with our neighbor who isn't a lemon fan, but he raved about this cake.  on a side note, the picture is kindof deceiving because the recipe calls for a 9x13 pan.

I made this cake for a BBQ and it was a HUGE hit...everyone gobbled it up and asked for seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I added was the zest of one lemon to the cake batter and another zest of one lemon to the whip cream mixture.  When my cake was done it was a little mounded on the top so I took a knife and cut the top so the surface was nice and flat for me to pour the whipped topping over, otherwise it would have slipped down the sides and been uneven.  I will be making this again, and again, and again!

This is one of the best cakes I have ever had!  I used cherry jello in place of the lemon and applesauce in place of the oil.  The cake turned out moist and flavorful and the icing was really light and tasty!  I'll be making this one again and again and experimenting with different flavors of both the cake and the jello.

Yummy easy cake. I used light Cool Whip and low fat milk in the icing and it was still great. Took it to work and everybody loved it.

I MADE THIS SUGAR FREE! ITS LOVELY. I USED A SWEET AND LOW LEMON CAKE MIX AND SUGAR FREE JELLO AND MADE MY OWN LEMON PUDDING BY USING THE SPLENDA WEBSITE'S RECIPE FOR LEMON MERINGUE PIE ( I JUST OMITTED THE PIE). I WHIPPED ONE 8 OZ PACKAGE OF CREAM CHEESE AND SET ASIDE. I THEN WHIPPED SOME HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM THAT HAD BEEN STABILIZED WITH SUGAR FREE LEMON JELLO. I FOLDED HALF OF THIS INTO THE CREAM CHEESE MIX AND LAYERED IT OVER THE PUDDING. I TOOK THE LAST OF THE WHIPPED CREAM AND ADDED A DROP OR TWO OF YELLOW FOOD COLORING TO SET OFF THE FINAL LAYER AND LAYERED IT OVER THE REST. I TOPPED WITH FRESH MINT. DELICIOUS AND A NICE TREAT FOR MY DIABETIC PARENTS.

Made this recipe with eggbeaters and coolwhip light and brought it into the hospital for my dad.  It was his birthday and he had open heart surgery.  All the nurses raved about it. My sister wants this cake for her birthday.  Great Recipe.

My kids just loved the not too overwhelming lemon flavor. Verrry moist. Frosting was a nice change - light, fluffy and creamy all at once.

Very tasty! Light and scrumptious. Perfect for a hot day. Be sure when making the icing, to mix the pudding with the milk first, instead of the cool whip (like I did). Result- icing was clumpy, but still very yummy.

Very good, very moist cake! Brought it for an outdoor barbecue and it was fantastic. Added zest of 1 lemon to the cake mix and it was plenty lemon-y. I think it got better the next day, so I might make it a night ahead next time.

This was incredible.  I made the recipe just as is but I substituted sugar free/fat free where available on the jello/pudding and I used lite cool whip.  I decorated with lemon zest and cut lemon slices.  Next time I'll try this with strawberry cake mix, strawberry jello, and cheesecake flavored pudding. UPDATE: I tried the strawberrry version for Mother's Day and it came out delicious.  This is a versatile way to make a yummy, inexpensive, easy, and less calorie cake.  If you try the strawberry version that I listed above, fold some real strawberry juice/puree in the cool whip before spreading on the cake.

This was a fantastic cake recipe!  It was wonderfully refreshing after a rich spaghetti dinner.  Our friends who came for dinner each requested the recipe.  The only thing I would do differently is to add some lemon zest to the batter and definitely the frosting as i like a little extra zing!

I made this for a light Easter Dinner desert and there were no leftovers, although considering we only had six for dinner, there should have been! I have since used the Whipped Topping and Pudding "frosting" mixture as a light "mousse" desert all on its own, also to rave reviews. Definitely a keeper.

While I agree that the cake part is great, and it is easily made into a low fat dessert, the frosting left something to be desired.  It got all lumpy when the pudding didn't mix with the milk.  It still tasted really good, and I will use it again.  Maybe I'll mix with a wisk this time....

This was amazing!!! EASY to make low-fat, just use fat-free jello, pudding, whipped topping and sub in egg whites for yolks.  Talk about cool and refreshing and the possibilities for this are endless!!! thankyou for a terrific dessert!!

Pretty good cake.  Lemon isn't my favorite, but I made it for a friend who wanted lemon cake for his birthday.  Him and his wife ate every bite, even after a huge dinner.  And they took most of it home afterwards, so I guess it was pretty good.  I added fresh lemon juice to the jello and icing, made the icing a little running.

I used eggbeaters and light cool whip and this cake came out GREAT!!  I had only a yellow cake mix in the pantry, but added 1 teaspoon of lemon extract to it, and my family never knew the difference.  This cake is light, creamy, and not over powering, or filling.  Perfect for a desert for Easter Sunday.  I can't wait to try it again.

this is my favorite way to make a lemon cake!  but you really only need 1/2 to 3/4 of the water & lemon gelatin mix.  also, i prefer a powdered sugar icing instead of whipped topping anyday.

I've made this cake twice in the last two weeks and get rave reviews. Until now, I wasn't much of a lemon cake fan because I thought they weren't moist.  Well, this is one of the moistest cakes I've had and it's way too easy to make. The only thing I did different was I used canned whipped frosting instead of the recipe here.  It was just as good. However, you do have to keep this cake refrigerated because of the frosting.  Otherwise, it'll run. Next time, I will add a little lemon to the frosting to give it a lemon flavor.

This cake was quick and easy, but tasted like a box mix cake with fluffy, Kool Whip frosting -- which is exactly what it is. Because of the high reviews, I expected something moist and lemony. My family, who loves lemon anything, was disappointed by the bland fluffy frosting and low lemon flavor. It tastes like something tossed together from a box, which is exactly what it is.

I had high hopes for this lemon cake, but it was bland and boring.  Barely can taste lemon and way too much cool whip.

I love this recipe.  It is simple and it is a refreshing change from rich desserts.  I like to serve mine with a raspberry sauce drizzle or just fresh raspberries.

Fantastic! I made this for my hubby's birthday in November and he absolutely LOVED it. He gave me the greatest compliment of all - he said it rivaled the lemon cream cake at Olive Garden. If any of you have had that cake at Olive Garden it is phenomenal. The topping on this cake is almost like a cheesecake. It is creamy and smooth - just the right amount of lemon. It is so easy to make - I had no problems! Plus the presentation was very pretty. You could easily make this into a lower fat/lower calorie recipe by making some minor revisions. Enjoy!

Talk about MOIST!  Yum is all I can say.  I love lemon, and this cake is just divine.  I made it in a bundt pan and after the "frosting" is poured on top it looks just gorgeous!

I made this to take to the office, and everyone agreed that it was very good.  There many compliments on how light and refreshing it was.  I used the sugar-free lemon gelatin, reduced fat pudding, reduced fat cool whip, canned evaporated low fat milk, and Pillsbury extra moist lemon cake mix.  I will definitely make this again.  It is perfect for summer.

Not bad and not good. When I said I would not be saving this recipe at our mothers day lunch, not one person said they liked it! Almost no lemon flavor, almost no flavor at all. Why eat something you can't taste.

Good, but not great. The lemon tasted artificial, and I really couldn't tell much difference between this recipe and simply making a plain lemon cake from a mix. It was very easy to make. The best part was the frosting.  I doubt I'll make the cake again, but I may play with the frosting recipe on other cakes.

Cool and creamy with a mild lemon flavor.  I was skeptical of using whipped topping in the frosting, but it turned out really well.  Next time I will add some fresh lemon juice and zest to give it a more tangy lemon flavor.  Glad I gave this a try.

This cake is moist, light, and refreshing.  I highly recommend it.  It's a great dessert after a very heavy meal- I made it last year for Christmas along with a dense chocolate torte- and the lemon cake disappeared first, much to my surprise.
I also made a two-layer version for a baby shower- I used the "pudding topping" as filling, and frosted the whole thing with white chocolate ganache.  I then decorated it by adding various food colorings to small bags of the ganache and piping it on.  It came out really cute!

This is a very delicious cake! All I could find at the grocery store was sugar-free lemon pudding, and it still tasted fantastic. I will make this cake over and over again.

This was an excellent cake. I am the only one who really eats lemon cake at home, so I brought it to work and everyone really loved it, especially the frosting. I didn't have the lemon jello so I skipped that step and the cake still came out great, just not as lemony. I will make this again.

Great recipe to deviate from the basic chocolate and yellow cakes we all bring for parties and potlucks.  Using pudding mix and whipcream as a frosting was great and was a big hit for those who don't care for conventional frosting.  Highly reccomend, particularly for those Urban Duchess women who don't really cook.  This is foolproof

I made this for our Father's Day BBQ and it turned out great.  The cake was very refereshing after a long day of hanging out in the sun and chasing the kids around :) I thought the lemon whipped topping would be a bit much but it was my favorite part!  I combined the milk, vanilla and lemon pudding together and then folded in the thawed whipped topping.  I'm not sure the topping would have worked out if I were to combine all the ingredients at once.

My child requested a lemon cake for her birthday so I came looking for an easy way to jazz up a lemon cake mix.  This was simple to make and it was a hit with the birthday girl which was the main point.  Personally it was a little too sweet for me, especially the frosting/topping. I'd never make a jello "poke" cake before so I didn't know what to expect.  The jello areas were a deeper yellow.  If I made it again, I might try using lime as suggested by another poster to get more of a contrast.  It was fun to try once.

I didn't use the recommended frosting, but I suspect that Jell-O(r) poke cake is more interesting when the Jell-O is a different color and flavor than the cake.  Otherwise, you just wind up with an extra moist, sweet, and sticky cake.  Not for an adult palate.

I took this cake to work and everyone loved it. It is very refreshing, especially as it has to be refrigerated. The only change I made was to use Dream Whip instead of the cool whip. I thought as it thawed it might seperate. It was wonderful. Have also made it at home and had it last 4 days and it kepr well.

I absolutely love this recipe and I enjoyed making it with many different flavor variations. However I prefer to make my topping with much more cool whip than is called for making it much fluffier.

WOW! I was leary about how this would turn out and boy was I BLOWN AWAY!  This cake melts in your mouth.  I used 9" round cake pans and put frosting between the two layers.  THE SECOND TIME: I figured there is no reason I can't change the flavors so I did.  I used devils food cake, fudge pudding, strawberry jello, and fresh strawberries for the top/sides.  AGAIN! WOW!  What's next?!

I wanted to make something lemony and not too overpowering - boy did I pick the right dessert!  I got RAVE reviews from this one and even more from people who didn't particularly care for lemony desserts.  I got the highest compliment of all ~ being asked for the recipe!  I have been asked to make this time and time again for family gatherings and I've only been too happy to oblige. I love it myself and it's my hubbies fav!

Made this for Easter in a 9x13 pan and it went over very well.  Added a little extra whipped topping to the top layer.  Can't wait to try other combinations--strawberry cake with strawberry gelatin and vanilla pudding with strawberry flavored whipped topping, chocolate cake with cherry gelatin and chocolate pudding topping, orange cake with orange gelatin, and vanilla pudding topping, etc., etc., etc.

I made this cake for my mom's Mother's Day luncheon. Most importantly, it was very tasty! I don't quite know where I went wrong but the appearance of my cake was a mangled disgrace! I am going to have to work on this one.

I have had this recipe and similar and used them for years.   Always popular and the only reason I rate it 4 is that the base is cakemix.   One of my favorite combinations is chocolate cake with cherry jello.   For topping I use choc. pudding rather than vanilla.  Try it - it is good.

If you like lemon - you will probably like this cake.  The cake needs to be refrigerated so it's very refreshing on a hot day.

Thanks Laura; this is a very YUMMY cake!
I have tried putting canned, crushed pineapple in the frosting. I drain a little of the juice out & put it in the cake in place of the water  the cake mix calls for. WONDERFUL cake!

I am 8 months pregnant & was craving a lemon cake.  This fit the bill.  It is light & delicious & the lemon flavor is not overpowering.  It would be great for a summer picnic.  Next time I may add some fresh lemon rind to the frosting.  It's an easy recipe & would be fun to experiment with lemon cake & raspberry jell-o.  I will definitely make it again.

This was excellent.  You would think that all the lemon used would make it too tart, but it didn't.  The milk and cool whip in the frosting really balances out the lemon.

I made this recipe for a baby shower and it was and absolute hit! I passed out the recipe to everyone. I am making it again for another shower. Instead of making it into a sheet cake, I made a bundt cake and frosted it with the cool whip and pudding. Then I dressed it up with daisies in the middle and around the edge. I was fabulous!!!

I made this simple cake as written... and it was a huge hit.  I made it for pool party/barbeque and everyone agreed it was a perfect cool, lemony, summer dessert.  There are many ways to vary this recipe, but I personally liked the simplicity of the all-lemon flavors.

This was very moist and refreshing.  My family loved this.  Great for summer.  No changes were made to the recipe.

This cake was very, very easy and tasted good.  I made it for an open house party -- it was a much bigger hit with the older folks.  I also was pretty conservative with my hole punching, next time I'll put holes all over the thing.

Excellent but modified: Added 1TSP Ground Terragon, 1 Container of Lemon Yogurt, substitute 1 1/4 cup Lemon-lime soda for the water, and 3 TBS Lemon Juice
