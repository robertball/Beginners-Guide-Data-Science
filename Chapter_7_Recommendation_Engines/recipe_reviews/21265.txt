This tasted really good, and all my guests raved.  

BUT the texture was not right.  The cheese would not melt properly, and I ended up with a sort of sauce on top, congealed cheese on bottom mess.

Since I was having a casual get together with good friends the appearance was unimportant, and the taste made up for it.  I wouldn’t make this for an “everything must be perfect” event though!

I really liked this.  Slightly more traditional value than regular fondue.  I wasn't really sure if the tomatoes were supposed to be totally mixed in or chunks.  It tasted great, anyway.

Typically, a tomato fondue, is called “Techinese”(sp?).  And, there are no lumps, (liquify tomatoes!), and, it has a cayenne pepper (right up Chef John’s ally) “bite” to it.  Must use flour or some starch to homogenize AND, with all cheese, heat SLOWWWWLY and not on high heat!  Trust me, time is worth it!  Blessings!!!

This is an easy fondue recipe. The taste is good. I was having the same problem as another reviewer, the cheese was globbing in the bottom and a sauce was forming on top. My solution,  add a tablespoon of all purpose flower. It turned out great.
