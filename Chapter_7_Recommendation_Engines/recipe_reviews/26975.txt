Absolutely Deeelicious!!! After making these twice, I've determined to use a whole slice of bacon to wrap the pepper. I had cream cheese oozing out with half slice. This fixes that problem and still bakes up crispy and perfect! If you don't want to buy pre-whipped cream cheese, just beat a block of the normal variety on high with your mixer...works just as wonderful!

I prepared 40+ halves and there weren't any left over...Everyone raved about them.  I modified the recipe a tad by adding finely shredded mild cheddar to the whipped cream cheese--and instead of wrapping the peppers with bacon I but real bacon bits into the cream cheese.  I also topped the stuffed peppers with finely shredded cheddar and then baked for 40 minutes (or when the cheese began to look like a finished topping).  Again, these were a huge success..You betcha I'll be making these all the time--PLUS--this is a great finger food for low-carbers!!!  Enjoy!

YUM!!!  I made these last night and my boyfriend and I loved them.  We actually compared them to our current favorite appetizer.  We will be having these all the time.  So easy too.  I used regular cream cheese instead of whipped and it worked fine.  i also added a little bit of shredded cheese which did hold in the cream cheese, tiny bit of cayenne pepper and the bacon.  I ended up turning it up to 425 degrees for the last 10 minutes to get the bacon crisp.  Yum Yum!  thank you!-UPDATE I have made these little yummy's at least 25 times now.  Everyone loves them.  We cook them on the BBQ on foil when we go camping all the time.

Yummy and easy.  I could not believe in cooking these that you lose most if not all of the heat, but still sooo tasty.

Instead of regular cream cheese, use pineapple cream cheese. This adds a wonderful sweet taste to the spicy peppers.

Practically perfect in every way.  Quick and delicious.  I recommend a surgical mask along with the latex gloves while seeding: a lungful of capsaicin will make you cough.

This recipe is awesome! My mother-in-law makes it every Christmas Eve and it goes great as an appetizer for Seafood gumbo! Get those Cajun juices flowing... After she wraps the jalapenos in bacon, she rolls the poppers in breadcrumbs before baking. Deeeeelicious!

My friend Introduced these to me about 6 months ago they cook theirs on the grill.  I tried the oven works too.  The more you wash these peppers the less hot they will be. We like hot so I dont rinse unless we have company coming.  They are excellant!!!

These are the most wonderful appetizers ever! Whenever I fix them for a party, they fly off the tray in seconds.  To mine I add bacon bits to the cream cheese, then sprinkle some grated cheddar on top before wrapping with the bacon (seems to hold the cream cheese in better).  Absolutely delicious!!!

Have made these a few different ways, also on grill and oven...always a crowd pleaser. Try cutting 1/4 off top, long ways, instead of cutting in half to make more of a boat.  Holds stuffing in better!  Also put stuffing in plastic bag and nip corner, squezzzzz to fill pepper.  Hope this helps.

yummy idea. but its a little bland with just cream cheese. I added small diced onions, finely chopped garlic, and small pieces of bacon. THEN i stuffed that into the jalapeno then wrapped with bacon. oh! and i accidently came upon a very good idea: if you have a cupcake pan, turn it around, and put the stuffed jalapenos on TOP of the separate cupcake shaper thingies. so, when it cooks, all the oil runs to the bottom, instead of the jalapenos basking in unneeded oil.

Perfect no cream cheese came out and I baked 400 preheated for 30 minutes. Thank you Tiffany - hint be sure you keep them in the fridge right until it is time to cook them so the cream cheese stays cool until they hit the oven.

I have made these about 10 times in the past few months for different parties and such, and they are always a big hit. I now make several batches at a time and freeze them, then when I need a quick appetizer, all I have to do is pop them in the oven. ( they freeze really well...and I don't cook them before I freeze them. Just let them thaw out before putting them inthe oven.)

At first, I thought I had a disaster on my hands. I checked the peppers only after 30 minutes baking at 400 degrees and already my bacon that was wrapped on the bottom was burning, and some of the bottoms of the peppers were so soft they were almost liquid-like.  The cream cheese had practically browned and it was crispy like.  I tasted one and it tasted allright, and my husband liked them...but there were some I had to throw away because the bacon was burned too bad.  I checked it only after 30 minutes, if I had waited till 45 minutes after I probably would have wound up pitching the entire batch away. I think I am going to have to reduce the temp on the oven as well as watch it more closely.  From what I observe though, most of the reviews did not have this problem?  I have had these peppers before when my best friend made them, and they were amazing. I hope to achieve that next time.

We love these, but we got from another recipe somewhere along the line so very similar but slightly modified with shredded cheese and shrimp or ground sausage (browned prior to stuffing) inside.  We also do not half them and only slit on one side & de-seed the jalapeno to keep all the cheesy goodness wrapped inside and from oozing out.  Also sometimes we grill these but when weather doesn't permit, we place them onto an elevated rack pan and bake them.  TIP:  De-seed your jalapeno's under water and it keeps you from coughing and your eyes from watering.

Very good!  I have a jalapeno rack that I bought at a craft fair so I grilled mine.   I cooked the bacon and chopped it up and added it to the cream cheese along with some grated cheddar and some green onions sliced thin.   I was afraid they'd be too greasy with the bacon wrapped around the peppers. I stood the peppers up on one end and just lopped the tops off before I stuffed them.  They're super easy to clean out using the end of a potato peeler to run around the inside of the pepper.   Will definitely make again, and again, and AGAIN!

We love these!  I keep the jalapenos whole by just cutting off the top and cutting down the side to remove the seeds.  I then use a spoon to scrape out all of the membrane to get rid of most of the heat.  I don't whip my cream cheese, I just put it in the microwave for 30 sec or so to get it extra soft.  Instead of putting these in the oven, I find that they are better on the grill.  The jalapenos stay firm and the bacon gets nice and crispy because the grease has a chance to drip off.  I also use one whole piece of bacon to wrap each jalapeno then secure with a tooth pick so the filling doesn't ooze out as much.

I've made these quite a few times and find the recipie as is to be very good.  however, looking at other reviews and with a little of my own doctoring I've found how to make them perfect.  I used pineapple cream cheese and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top before wrapping the bacon.  It sounds wierd but it was a perfect marriage of sweet and spicy.  If you can not find pineapple cream cheese at the store you can make your own by blending together canned pineapple tidbits and a little juice with a regular 8 oz block of cream cheese.

Tiffany THANK YOU SO MUCH for this delicious recipe!!!!  I can not make these or take them anywhere without having to give someone the recipe!  My family and friends ALL love jalapenos, but do not like messing with frying them!  These look like they are so much trouble to make but they are so easy!  Thanks again Tiffany!

I made 60 halves for a group of 25 people, there were none left! I did pull them out of the oven after 20 mins, and they were almost burnt, so watch the time! I will also add some finely shredded chedder cheese next time.

These came out really good.  I used regular whipped cream cheese, mexican blend of grated cheese, two spoons of salsa, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I put it all in a ziploc bag and cut the corner off and pipped the filling in, as another user suggested.  So easy! My husband cut the peppers wrong but I was still able to fill them without a problem.  Next time I think I will try the pineapple cream cheese to see the difference and I will use a whole strip of bacon instead of half.  My husband loved these, I loved them too but they were really hot for me.  He even thought so and he's from mexico and has a stomach of steel.  These are a must try!!

Made this for a football treat for our family. I did add about 1/3 cup cheddar cheese to this as well as some bacon crumbles I already had on hand. The only thing I would add is don't buy a cheaper bacon and I would use my cooking rack that I use for cookies, etc. on top of my baking tray to drain the bacon grease while baking these. Otherwise they were quite tasty.

WEAR GLOVES!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT TOUCH FACE!!!!!! The seeds will burn you and there is nothing that will soothe or help the burn but time :l Please heed my warning.

As for the recipe, these were good but just shy of amazing. It's tough to get the bacon to crisp in the right way when it's wrapped around something. Still worth making again!!

Wow! These are absolutely amazing! My great aunt used to make some that tasted very similar to these and I love them! I found 3lbs of jalapenos on sale for $1 so I thought it would be a great night to try them, amazing taste and perfect for a broke college student! I made 40 + for under $10!

We make these about once a month for various functions or for our own meals. Always a hit wherever I go. The smaller the jalapenos, the hotter they tend to be.

Use a broiler pan lightly coated with PAM instead of a baking sheet. It allows the grease to drip off the peppers. In addition to that, anyone wanting peppers with a "kick" should get the smaller ones. My experience has been that large peppers are more bland.

I made these for NYE and there wasn't one left, within 30 minutes of the party starting!  WONDERFUL!  I cut the jalapenos in half, as opposed to leaving them whole and still had great results.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe ... I thought it came out too greasy (from the bacon) and really wasn't what I was looking for.  I had made a dozen and only about 4 got eaten.

I'm one of those anti-heat weenies that can only handle the most mildest of salsas at best (or what my husband calls "tomato juice") but I had a craving for these after a tiny bite at a party (which was followed by lots of soda, bread, and queso). After much research this is what I found: 1) the older the jalepeno, the spicier. The older the jalepeno the more little white flecks on the surface. Buy peppers with the least amount of white flecks. 2) as you seed these run it under cold water, then let them soak in water for about an hour. changing the water frequently.  They had absolutely no heat and they are DELISH!!

We've been making these for years and LOVE them. I just saw this listing...the only thing we really do differently is sprinkle brown sugar on the cream cheese before wrapping in bacon. Gives it *excellent* flavor!

Delicious! I grow one jalapeno plant and that allows me to make this dish several times over the summer. For the filling, try mixing in a little feta cheese, lemon juice and garlic. Yum!

Absolutely my hubby's favorite meal - yes, we eat them for dinner sometimes.  Why not?  Also he begs me to make them for football Saturdays and any time we have company.  He's even made them for himself in my absence.  Easy & Yummy!
PS - produces LOTS of grease - use a pan with SIDES, line it with foil or a silpat for easier cleanup.

Absolutely delicious. I cooked a dinner for 3 people and had these as appetizers, and they were gone in 15 minutes. But next time, I'll use a whole piece of bacon so all the delicious filling doesn't boil out.

I had high expectations for these, but they were surprisingly bland. They were not spicy at all, and the jalapenos went to mush when baked for that long. The filling was terribly lacking, so I added a little cheddar cheese and green onion to the next few, but that didn't improve it very much. I won't be trying this recipe again.

Wow! This was wonderful. I did make it two times and the first time it was not hot enough, so when makeing it the secound time I added some of the seeded to the creamn cheese. This gave it just the right amount of heat.

This is a favorite appetizer in my household.  I use block cream cheese and smear that on the inside of the pepper, top with cheddar and wrap with a full strip of bacon.  I bake mine on an elevated rack over a cookie sheet so the grease drips off.  Perfect every time!

These were a hit at a football party. They look really special too, everyone was impressed. The smaller jalapenos I used were much hotter than the larger ones. I did add garlic powder to the cream cheese while in the mixer. I also wore latex gloves, which was helpful when I cleaned the peppers, but I should have left them on while stuffing the peppers. The bacon I used was thick cut so they took 45 minutes to cook, it wasn't as crispy so thinner bacon may be better. These went fast! Plan atleast 3 half peppers per person.

This made a nice snack for our 4th of July party. They were met with some mixed reviews however my husband said they deserve 10 stars. My grocery store was out of pineapple cream cheese so I mixed my own. I think that the premixed kind is sweeter and that might have complimented them a little better. The bacon kind of overpowered the other tastes for me so next time I'll try to find a way for more of the other flavors to come through and for those of you who are afraid that these would be hot they really were very mild. Thanx for a great recipe. Note: We remade these today and they were much better with the few adjustments we made: first I added more pineapple until it was almost runny but not to were it ran out of the peppers and then we only cooked them until the bacon looked done which took about 20-25 minutes in my oven. To me it made a huge difference for the better even though my husband loved them to begin with, he also thought they tasted better the second time around.

Sooooooo yummy, easy to make and inexpensive, too!  Based on other reviews, I used the pineapple cream cheese and all 24 peppers were devoured in minutes.  Great flavors and a super addition to the appetizers for any occasion.

These are absolutely AWESOME!  I can never get enough, and find any opportunity to make them.  I do make mine slightly different, I don't cut the jalapeno's in half.  We leave them whole, only cutting off the stem end to stuff with regular cream cheese and then grill.   They sometimes stay a little hotter that way, really depends on the pepper though.  YUMMY!

These were incredible!  I made these for a choir potluck and they were gone in 10 minutes!  Everyone raved about them and gobbled them up in record time; those who were on low-carb diets loved them especially.  I read some of the reviews and decided to use the pineapple cream cheese; also I didn't have to cook them that long, just 25 minutes for a jelly roll pan that had about 40 jalapeno halves on it.  Also I set them on paper towels after baking to soak up the grease.  Great recipe...thank you!

This recipe is great, but I did add a little to it. I added some shredded Mexican cheese, and some minced garlic to the cream cheese mix. then I put the two half's back together after their stuffed then I wrap bacon around to cover the whole pepper stuck with a tooth pick to hold the bacon in place. everyone loved them. Im making them again tomorrow for thanksgiving.

Such an easy delicious appetizer. I baked the bacon until it was partial cook. I also added a dash of Mrs. Dash spicy seasoning on top of the whipped cream cheese and sprinkled it with shredded taco cheese before I wrapped a whole piece of bacon around the jalapeno. I baked the poppers for 30 minutes. Absolutely love and will make again and again.

My family and I loved these!  I added some cottage cheese to the cream cheese (I had some leftover) and it still turned out great.

Followed the recipe EXACTLY. (I hate it when people rate it great, but made a million changes to the recipe...they're basically rating their own recipe!) So: PROBLEMS: 1) whipped cream cheese results in the air in the cream cheese puffing out to such an extent, that all the cream cheese fluffs out during cooking. 2) cooking time results in flabby, non crisp and fatty bacon. Not crisp bacon. So I would chew the thing, and the fatty portions of the bacon would just..sit in my mouth. Crispy bacon should disintegrate into your mouth! This just gummed around like cud. Other than these two major issues, it did taste good (given what was left of the cream cheese).  If I was to change this, I might cook for longer, and use regular cream cheese. I would NOT serve this at a party as the recipe is, the things were a sloppy mess.

Delicious! The only change I made to this recipe was that I added garlic to the cream cheese.  Other than the one small addition, I followed this recipe exactly.

These were very easy to make.  I recommend wearing gloves and making a piping bag out of a zip lock for the cream cheese; it makes it way easier.  I added some shredded cheese on top.  Next time I will think about adding something to the cream cheese and it was pretty bland.  Other than that they were delicious and I would definitely make these again.

As is I give it 4 stars, but with a few changes it's definitely a five star recipe! Jalapenos are running a bit large in season at the moment so I doubled the amount of cream cheese (two 8 oz phily cream cheese which I whipped with a hand mixer,) I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese and a pinch of cayenne pepper which you can either hand mix in or used the mixer. I stuffed the peppers then wrapped each one with a full slice of thick smoked bacon. Cooking time was no where near 45 minutes, more like 20-25 - at the end the peppers perfect and the bacon cooked but no crispy (recommendations for upping the temp the last ten minutes might help make them crispier if you want that.) Great Poppers!

These are amazingly good.  I sometimes add a little sprinkled brown sugar halfway through cooking to caramelize on top.  Try it, it adds a nice sweetness to all the other flavors going on.

Delicious!  I also added the sharp cheddar cheese to the whipped cream cheese, stuffed the peppers and sprinkled the top of the cheese with Italian Bread crumbs before wrapping with bacon for a bit of added flavor.  Used an entire piece of bacon cut in half long ways to help hold the cheese in.  I baked on a rack as others taked about them being a little greasy, so they did not turn out greasy at all.  A big hit with me!

If you add a little of Ranch Dressing and salad Mix to the cream cheese (to taste) will make this even tastier. I have made the jalapeños using this recipe several times now and everybody loves them.

Instead of cutting them in half, I cut a slit down the center and scooped the seeds out with a small spoon.  Then I used an icing bag to stuff them with cheese. I also added finely shredded cheddar and used the garden flavored cream cheese.   After cooking in the oven, I placed them in a crock pot to keep warm for a party.  They were delicious and I'd definitely make them again!

I have made these twice. Once for a Superbowl party and once for a St. Patty's day party. Both times I really enjoyed them. I take out the seeds because I don't always know if everyone likes spicer food. I also add shredded cheddar cheese to the cream cheese mixture for more flavor. I will make these again. Oh and I use regular cream cheese, not whipped.

I have made these for years.  Just saw this recipe today.  We add a bit of shredded cheddar and chives to the regular cream cheese.  We also microwave the bacon to preheat it.  It allows the bacon to crisp up a bit quicker so the peppers do not get overcooked.  We love this appetizer, and as others have said, they are the first to go no matter what we serve.

I love these! Added some of the seeds from one of the peppers, a few tablespoons of breadcrumbs, some crushed red pepper and parmesan cheese to the cream cheese then stuffed them! Also put bacon in the microwave for 40 seconds to drained some of the grease and cook them a bit before I wrapped them! They get crispier that way. Perfect!

Made these for a party and they were the most popular thing there!  Very easy to make, just time-consuming.  Used thick cut bacon, each slice cut in half for each half jalapeno.  Didn't use whipped cream cheese but don't think it made a difference.  USE GLOVES WHEN CUTTING THE JALAPENOS!!  My hands burned for hours!

These are spicy little snacks! I loved them but some of them were a bit too spicy. Here are a few changes I made . . . 1. WEAR GLOVES - otherwise you'll ruin your eyes/contacts for a day. 2. Thanks to another review, I used raspberry cream cheese instead of the plain stuff.  Don't worry about getting the whipped kind, you can just beat it with a fork. IT'S AWESOME! 3. I stuffed my halved peppers, sprinkled them with BROWN SUGAR, and then wrapped them in smoked turkey bacon. The turkey bacon was perfect due to its thickness. 4. I also used a whole piece of bacon. 5. I also used chive/onion cream cheese (w/o the brown sugar step) and those were great too!

Excellent recipe overall. I only wished it had called for regular cream cheese instead of whipped cream cheese as I believe they would have come out better. The whipped cream cheese fluffed up in the oven and lacked a little body. If not for that I would've given it five stars. My hubby and I loved them though. The kitchen smelled delicious. Next time I make them I will use regular cream cheese and a full strip of bacon. I didn't need toothpicks to hold the bacon put, just make sure the ends of the bacon end up under the jalapeno.

I make these a little different, but they are a favorite at BBQs.  I leave the peppers whole, fill with a cream cheese/shredded cheddar/diced onion mix and wrap with a whole slice of bacon.  Secure with a toothpick and toss on the grill! Keep some of the seeds for those that like it HOT and add back into the cheese mix to stuff back in a few of the peppers.  Make sure to put two toothpicks in those lol!

MAJOR success story!  as others have indicated, the heat is baked out of them significantly (although by no means completely).  as others suggested, doctor up the cream cheese with spices and shredded cheddar.  do NOT overstuff -- just make level with the tops of the peppers (I didn't need the whole 8 oz, and I did use regular cream cheese).  this will help them to not overflow.  also, I baked at 350 to control boiling out of the filling, and ended up with a little overflow, but not much, and the pepppers still held together.  I tried using a whole slice on some peppers, with no better result.  a toothpick inserted to hold the bacon down seemed to help a little, but not completely.  2 thumbs up -- thanks!

When I was cutting the jalapenos, I got so much 'essence of jalapeno' in my throat that I assumed the ones I had were super spicy (garden fresh from a coworker). So I boiled them for a minute or so to take some of the heat out. They ended up hardly spicy at all, so I'm not sure if I would do that again. Anyway, I used plain block cream cheese and a half a slice of bacon on each. Granted, the bacon was thick sliced, but I can't imagine using a whole slice for each jalapeno half, as the ones I made were plenty rich with just half a slice. For those who think a half slice of bacon doesn't wrap the pepper as well, you can stretch the bacon more than you think (especially when using the thinner sliced bacon). Overall, they were a little rich for me, but tasty too!

Absolutely delicious!  The first time I had them, they were served with raspberry chiptole sauce to use as a dip, and I now won't serve them without it!

Someone at the races gave us this recipe which we tried and loved. After making it the first time,we decided to use turkey bacon and fat free cream cheese to make a healthier version which we actually like a little better. Our third time, we added fresh red pepper, cilantro and onion (chopped real fine) to the cream cheese which also was a big hit. There are so many options. I can't wait to try more.

I tried this recipe and it was a hit at work!One thing I did to make the bacon crisiper and less greasy was to microwave 8 half slices for 2 1/2 mins at a time on paper towels.  I then blotted them PRIOR to wrapping the bacon around the jalapenos.  I also took the suggestion of others and used pineapple cream cheese and whipped it with a hand blender. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper.

I have made these a few times now-excellent!!!  This time, I used a block of cream cheese & mixed in one small bag of real bacon pieces (by the salad dressings in the store).  Baked for 20 min.  Much easier & just as good as wrapping w/ bacon strips.

Very delicious and extremely easy! I will try and tinker around with the cream cheese, maybe adding a spice or herb will make it even better.

I will make these again, we had a very large peppers from the farmers market. Splitting in half six peppers gave enough for the cream cheese/cheddar cheese and crab meat and cream cheese. The moral of this recipe for us you can stuff j-peppers with anything so long as you use cream cheese and bacon wraps! Fab! Easy!

Good recipe, though I changed it by adding BBQ pork, crispy pork sin, and pineapple. Turned out well.

I blanched the seeded peppers before stuffing to take out some of the fire and lessen baking time. Next time I will mix some sharp cheddar in with the cream cheese to give the filling better flavor.  Be sure to use toothpicks to hold the bacon on!  I didn't, and they did not come out picture-pretty.  Still, a simple and yummy low-carb appetizer or light meal!

I added 2 TBSP of Ranch Dip seasoning packet in Fiesta Ranch flavor to the cream cheese (I just used a block of it and whipped it myself) and then stuffed the jalapenos. (I'll probably add the whole packet next time). I also used turkey bacon and they were to die for!

YUM!!!  These were a big hit with us.  First time I followed recipe exactly, second time we blended minced garlic into the cream cheese.  Great for game day snack - I made them earlier in the day then popped them into oven.  Excellent!

I just made these for the first time a few weeks ago, but I did them the way one reviewer did them...by adding a bit of shredded mild cheddar cheese and real bacon pieces into the cream cheese, then topping with more shredded cheddar and baking. Everyone loved them!! These will be making regular appearances at our house. Making some tonite!!  just DELICIOUS!!!!!  : )

Didn't care for this. Followed instructions but bacon burned on the bottom.  Sounds crazy, considering there's bacon & jalapenos involved, but all in all I found this very 'bland'

FAR too much bacon! Will crumble some bacon into the cream cheese next time. The recipe's cooking time was WAY off (30 minutes at 400 degrees???). As a new cook, my first home-grown crop of peppers was nearly destroyed! Be careful using this app!!

Saw this recipe and decided to make it on a whim... they are great! And I made em while I cooked my brats on the grill... I know the recipe says to put em in the oven, but, I didn't feel like firing up the grill & the oven, and they did just fine on the top rack... great recipe though...

So addictive!!  I love these!  My jalapenos and bacon blackened on the bottom, and at first I was worried that I burned them, but they were awesome that way!  So don't be afraid if they get black on the bottom because they taste amazing!!  I will definitely be making these a lot!!!

I had on gloves for this! I cut off the stem, sliced them in half, scraped out the membranes and seeds by hand. I rinsed, then soaked the jalapenos for 5 min and it seemed to cut down the heat. I will soak them for 10 next time. I used cream cheese and a little cheddar and parm. Really tasty appetizer. They were pretty greasy the next day. I am definitely trying whipped cream cheese next time for a lighter cheese flavor without all the grease.

Three ingredients...easy...delicious!! The cream cheese cuts the spiciness of the jalapeno, and I find most people can handle the medium heat.

These are delicious.  I did whip some cajun seasoning with the cream cheese the second time I made them to add more flavor, as well as soak the jalapenos so they wouldn't be so hot.  These disappeared in an hour when I brought them to a party, and I will definitely be asked to bring them again.

I made 44 halves for a party and they were the first appetizer gone!  I used the garlic and chive cream cheese and mixed a little finely shredded sharp cheddar in the cream cheese.  Then filled the halves level to the top, sprinkled with sharp cheddar and bacon bits (instead of the sliced bacon).  They were DELICIOUS!  Will definitely make them again and again!

These were really good! I did use a whole slice of bacon as some of the other reviewers suggested. I also added some shredded cheddar in with the cream cheese to try to bump up the flavor a bit. I liked the flavor, but will try some more variation to give it that extra bit of flavor.

These are really good but I feel they need just a little something.  Not sure what though, I guess something mixed in with the cream cheese to give just a little more oomph.

Add a "little smokie" on top before you wrap with the bacon.

I wasn't sure how I would feel about the bacon with cream cheese but it's actually pretty good.  Had a little trouble with the cream cheese oozing out during baking though.

I made these for a BBQ. I only had regular cream cheese, that I jazzed up w/ some cayene pepper and mixed herbs. Only, because I know, they would of been bland, w/out the jazzing. They cooked in about 40 mins. and were the hit of the party. If your really not into too much hotness, skip the cayene.

OK..we like it hot at my house, so the one change while I double the batch was to dice 4 habaneros and put it in half of the cream cheese.  I followed the rest of the directions, cooking until the bacon was done.  It was nice to have a popper with a punch!

OMG! These peppers ROCK! The only thing that I suggest is to be sure to clean all the seeds out of the peppers. If you don't your mouth will be on fire! Also, use a whole strip of bacon to wrap the pepper.

These are awesome! I made a few small adjustments. I used whole slices of bacon on mine, left a few of the seeds in for more heat and used a flavored cream cheese (garlic and chive). These are a hit everywhere I take them! Thanks!

I didn't get this recipe from here but it's the same recipe I use!  These are absolutely AWESOME!!  I don't cut the peppers in half though.  I just cut the tops off, slice out the seeds, and rinse.  Then I stuff the cream cheese in them.  If you have sensitive skin, using a baby spoon to stuff is good.  Then i wrap a WHOLE bacon strip on it and secure with a toothpick.  I sprinkle these with a tiny bit of kosher salt before i cook in the oven.  They are great!  I frequently make these and am asked for the recipe constantly!

Perfect!  The only thing I did different was add just a little bit of dry Hidden Valley Ranch mix to the cream cheese.  I think next time I will leave a little bit of the jalapeno seeds in the cream cheese mixture to give it a little more “heat.”

These Jalapenos are not spicy but they pack a lot of delicious flavor!  So easy to make and so delicious. I also used regular cream cheese, yum yum!  Everyone loves them.

I found this recipe May 2006! I can't count how many times I've made these.  The family absolutely loves them! I don't bother whipping the cream cheese, just use a butter knife and cut the block into strips to fit the size jalapeno you have ;)  They come out perfectly every time.  I also think that 45 minutes is way too long.  I only need 20 - 30 depending on the size, and the bacon is crisp.

This recipe is wonderful.  I made a couple of changes.  I don't like SUPER spicy things so I boiled the peppers for about 1 1/2 minutes before stuffing them.  I also mixed regular cream cheese (that's all I had) with a little bit of garlic powder and shredded cheese.   Also, use a full slice of bacon.  Like other readers, the half slice came undone.  Yummy recipe - THANKS!!

These were excellent!  I had an over abundance of jalapenos in my garden, but now I can't seem to grow them fast enough with this recipe.  I have already passed it on and shared and the recipe has received rave reviews.  I used chive and onion cream cheese.  I also love that there was no frying involved.  I hate the mess of frying.

Just the right amount of heat, and the smokiness of the bacon was very nice. I used a whole piece of bacon and wrapped it around the whole pepper half (no need for toothpicks!) and it held the cream cheese in nicely. Also put these under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of baking to get them good and crispy. Delicious!

There is nothing to love about this recipe. It is simple and spectacular. Made a double batch and they didn't last 20 minutes - with TONS of other foods. I did add the powdered ranch - loved it! Will make again and again. Actualy I am already making them for New Years Eve!

These are great!!!!  I had some leftover cajun chicken, so I diced it up and added it to the cream cheese along with about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. I wrapped it in turkey bacon and they were sooo yummy!!!  I will make these again!

Does the bacon grease soften up the jalapeno or does it stay crunchy? I don't like the crunchiness of fresh jalapenos but this recipe sounds great.  Just wondering if I need to cook the jalapenos a bit first to soften them up?

I made these for a birthday party - they were gone in minutes!  Out of all the appetizers I made, these were the hit.  They are quick and easy to make, and delicious.  I have incorporated this recipe into my list of favorite appetizers.  I thought they might be too hot being fresh jalapenos, but they had a mild spice (due to the cooking?) that was perfect for my tastes.

Excellent.  I added shredded montery and cheddar cheese to the cream cheese along with a little minced jalapeno and a little taco seasoning.  Bake time took about 30 - 35 minutes.

These were amazing however, I did use the pineapple cream cheese (comes that way in the store) and whipped it up using my hand mixer.  I used very large jalapenos thinking they wouldn't be as hot but they were but people still gobbled them all up!  Actually, 3 people ate all of them prior to me getting them out of the kitchen - I was stunned.  Amazing and am making them tonight.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Great!!!!!!!! Recipe!!!!!! I had a BBQ at my house by the pool and I have to tell you this went over so well at my party, I had about 78 people and everyone wanted this recipe. I did change it, I Layed some foil on my gas grill and BBQ'd them for about 45 mins or longer I then served them with some GOOD BBQ honey BBQ sauce. I  love to cook and have some pretty good recipes I will be adding this one to my book. For those of you who don't much care for the jalapenos, try this recipe they're not hot they have so much flavor you will be in heaven!!!

These are SO great and SO easy!  I ended up running out of bacon, so the remaining cream cheese-stuffed peppers I just covered with shredded cheddar, and those were great, too!  Also, regular softened cream cheese works just as well as the whipped kind.  These are super!

Oh, man this was great! 
Even my husband, who is not fond of bacon or cream cheese liked these. I used regular cream cheese, instead of whipped. This is not something to make to far before a party because, you would eat them all  yourself! 
Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was simply delightful.  It has just the right blend of zest and simplicity.  One note - make sure you protect your hands when removing the jalapeno seeds.  My fingers burned for a day or two under the fingernails.  A major hit at my dinner party.  Make a lot - they'll disappear fast.

We really like these, but think something needs to be added to the cream cheese.  I will make these again adding sharp cheddar and garlic powder to the cream cheese.

Awesome...we added some seasonings to the cream cheese (cayenne, powdered horseradish, bacon bits, salt and pepper) and followed the other reviewers tip of putting shredded cheese on top of the cream cheese to help it from oozing out.

On superbowl, I decided to add shedded chedder cheese and a couple spoonfuls of salsa to "kick up" the cream cheese filling. Came out great!! They were soooo easy and tastey!!!!

WEAR GLOVES!!! I only rated it 3 stars because it didn’t say to wear gloves. While some more experienced people might think that’s a no-brainer, someone like me (who’s never cooked with fresh jalapeños) I ended up with burning hands. It felt like I had put my fingers on a hot stove.

These were easy and DELICIOUS. I shared with friends at the pool and they loved them. Pointer: wear gloves to deseed jalapeños. I did not and my hands were “on fire” several hours later for at least three hours . (No fault of recipe...can’t wait to make them again.)

Excellent and simple to make. I reduced my convection oven to 390 degrees and used thick bacon (1/2 slice). It took only 31 minutes so would not recommend 400 for 45 mins as recipe states. Next time I will try  using thinner bacon as i think it would wrap the jalapeño more fully which would prevent cheese or jalapeño from burning. A reminder to use disposable gloves when handling jalapeños.

These were good. I pre cooked bacon in 400 degree oven in roaster on rack. Baked jalapeños for 20 minutes in same roaster. I just cut regular cream cheese in slices and pushed into peppers.

I made it with pineapple cream cheese as suggested by someone else. They were a big hit. My nephew told my niece to get the recipe :) so easy too. The peppers were done but the bacon was not crisp enough so I put them under the broiler for 4 minutes. Perfection!

These are delicious!  I was so glad that I used rubber gloves when removing the seeds and membranes because my gloves disintegrated!  So glad that wasn't my fingers.  I will definitely make these again... after I buy new rubber gloves.

These were delicious. Filling though. I think next time  I will use some type of makeshift pastry bag to fill the jalepenos. I also used Philadelphia chive and onion cream cheese. Because of the high heat you will have to lower the heat and cook longer or constantly turn them so they don't burn. I will make these again and it sounds like they're a party fav!

These are great! I did add some sharp cheddar to the cream cheese. This gave me a little more filling for a few more jalapenos. But this is a great recipe all on its own.

These  went really fast!  I followed some of the suggestions and used half shredded cheese and half cream cheese.  Used a mixer to blend them, which also gave the cream cheese that whipped texture.  I seeded and rinsed the jalapenos to cut down some of the heat, which made for the perfect amount of heat.  Not too spicy, not too mild.  Don't forget those gloves when seeding the peppers!

I can't get enough stuffed jalapenos, and probably have tried most of the variations I come across.  I doubled the recipe, and maybe it's the size of my jalapenos (which were pretty good size), but I only used one 8 oz package whipped cream for a double batch.  The bacon seemed a little small for cutting in half, they only wrapped around one time.  Next time I plan to use the whole slice of bacon, mix the whipped cream cheese with some shredded cheddar and then fill the jalapeno halves.  Otherwise, this was delicious.

AMAZING!  I had a bumper crop of fresh jalapenos from the garden and scoured online for a recipe that baked rather than fried the peppers.

ADDED:  5 small cloves of finely chopped garlic and  forgot the cheddar cheese...baked at 400' for 30 minutes and finished 10 min @425'   ...  wrapped the bacon lengthwise and did not toothpick  All of the cheese stayed.  Used broiler pan to cook on, caught all the drippings.  They were amazing!  I did not rinse them at all and found they were quite mild.  Thanks to all the input.  This will be a definite Keeper in our home.

Followed recipe exactly except cook time.  I did 400 degrees 20 mins and then broiled it 5 mins trying to get the bacon crispy.  
The taste is great.  BE SURE to wrap the bacon carefully around the jalapenos.  I got in a hurry in the end and those the filling blew out the cracks.  These are going to a potluck in about a hour.  I hope they are a hit.

I love these! The first time I had them was at a party at my daughter's house and I started to think what else I could add to them and I found you can add anything, such as sun dried tomato strips, or small chucks of Pineapple. Let your imagination run wild.

These are good! The only modification I did was to top the cream cheese stuffed jalapenos with shredded cheddar cheese, panko bread crumbs, and real bacon bits. (I didn't go crazy with these additional toppings, just lightly sprinkled them)

We used smaller pieces of Jalapenos, and cooked them on the grill instead! Fantastic!! We also tried goose meat instead of Sausage, and that was great also!

These were very good and easy.  I cooked them on the grill on a cast iron flat plate with a grid.  I used low temp on my burners.  I let them be for about 10 minutes and then watched often to turn them when needed.  I did have to sop up some grease from the iron plate during cooking.  I used several paper towels for this.  I also used a whole strip of bacon and unwhipped block cream cheese.  I do wish the cream cheese had more flavor. Maybe I'll add cheddar or garlic powder next time.

Smashing hit. I sprinked a little cajun seasoning and a dash of garlic powder. Also, bought more jalapeno's (20) and was still able to accomodate 1 package of cream cheese. 

I brought them over to a friends for 4th of July, they were gone in 10 minutes. Even the kids ate them.

Excellent Recipe. I would like to say that the size of the jalapeno designates on whether you use a half or a whole slice of bacon. For added zip try finely cut green onion to the cream cheese mix.

Not the most appetizing looking things but tasted pretty good. The pictures I see looked ALOT better than than what I ended up with on my plate. The cream cheese melted everywhere and simply did not look good. I think these would have been better stuffed with cream cheese AND sausage.

These are very easy and hit at any get-together. Rather than wrapping the bacon around the jalapeno, I just lay a small piece on top and toothpick it in place.   I also recommend lining your baking sheet with foil--makes for a much easier cleanup!

These are so delicious!!!  Everyone who's tried one has raved about it.  I will be tripling the recipe when I make it again for Sunday's Super Bowl because I know they will get devoured in an instant.  Five stars!!!

Made this as a football game snack for my boyfriends' family.  Everyone loved them! I normally hate cream cheese but this combination just works perfectly (although I am sure that anything wrapped in bacon in delicious). I highly recommend this recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I made these for Christmas Eve. My family absolutely devoured these! I read some of the reviews and made a few changes to the original recipe. I doubled the recipe and used 2 packages of cream cheese, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. I followed the recipe other than this. Oh my!! They were gone in minutes! I was asked to make these again for New Year's Eve! Wonderful recipe!! A new family fave for us!

These are an easy, yummy snack for any get together!  I made them for Superbowl last year & will make them again this week for a party.  Jalapenos are a little hot for some guests, so I also stuff some small red & yellow peppers (Costco plug!!) & cook them the same way--awesome & loved by all!!!

I was somewhat disappointed in these. They were good, but nothing outstanding. I love fried jalapeno poppers, but I was trying to make this somewhat "healthier" version. Maybe I am just biased towards the fried type. We ate them, but I probably would not make again.

These are absolutely remarkable. A few suggestions.....after cutting and seeding I pop mine in the microwave for 2 minutes or so (unstuffed). I also forego the 'wrapped bacon' and add liquid smoke and bacon bits right to the cream cheese and then broil....always a hit. That way they only take a fraction of the time and work to stuff and wrap each jalapeno.

I make mine with one whole strip of bacon wrapped around each pepper. It definitely keeps the sour cream inside. Very easy to make!

I love this recipe. It's a surprise for your taste buds for those who haven't tried it. I make this for company buffet style along with other dishes. For those who haven't tried them before I always get the same expression...bacon, creamcheese, & jalepenos? But everyone always falls in love with them!  Plus they're super easy.

my husband made these for our superbowl party... they were a hit! Some helpful tips: The grease from the bacon drips a LOT, so use a pan with sides in the oven to avoid a mess. Once they cool down they loose spicyness, so eat them hot! They shrink quite a bit, and the color will fade.  They are not as nice as I'd hoped for presentation.  Overall, awesome, very manly, and delicious!

These were so incredibly yummy!!  I made 50 of them last night for a Chistmas party and everyone raved over them.  I added some sharp cheddar on top of the cream cheese before wrapping in bacon.  After they baked I broiled them for a few minutes to get the bacon extra crispy.  I am making them again on Christmas Eve and will be many other times in the future too!!  Yummy!!

These stuffed jalapenos were a hit at my Thanksgiving, but something seemed to be missing.  It could have been the type of bacon I used, because I felt like I needed to add salt after cooking them.  They were really simple to make, though, and I will definitely make them again.  Next time, I think I will choose a saltier brand of bacon.

I used this recipe for a pool party, the kids and adults couldn't get enough. I have never had an appetizer go so fast. I do recommend a whole piece of bacon and found that those who typically do not enjoy the spicy kick liked the whipped berry cream cheese instead of the plain. I also provided pepper jelly for dipping and that seemed to be a nice addition.

This may be the very best appetizer I have ever had!!  My hubby likes the frozen poppers but I don't care for them.  We made these and my husband asked where they had been all his life!  I made one change, I added shredded sharp cheddar after I had put on the cream cheese.  Wonderful!

Advice:  I don't care how much you may think you like spicy, DO NOT LEAVE ALL THE SEEDS IN, haha.  I did, and my husband had to gargle milk.  That aside, when I made these they tasted bitter. I don't know much about baking jalepenos, but the actual pepper just needed something to make it taste, well, to taste good.  My husband and I didn't care for them much (and we LOVE stuffed jalepenos, but usually the fried and breaded variety), but judging from the other reviews I'm willing to accept that the lack of yummyness was on the part of the cook, and not the recipe.

Huge hit at my girls night party last night!  Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I appreciate the suggestion of using gloves to cut, clean, and seed the peppers -- if I hadn't I would have been in a lot of pain!

I've tried these several times with different seasonings and shredded cheeses mixed in with the cream cheese and it was amazing every single time.  They didn't look very presentable when I made them, but they more than made up for it in taste.  Everything is better with bacon!  lol   **WEAR GLOVES** when seeding the peppers, I didn't, and I couldn't put my contacts in for a week!!

I followed this recipe exactly with the jalapenos fresh from my garden--some red and some green. This is my first time growing peppers and making anything with them---my boyfriend LOVED them! They were a huge hit. I did follow the advice of other cooks on this site and wore gloves while harvesting, seeding, and preparing the peppers. This recipe is perfect, thank you so much!!!!

All I can say is YUM!! I eat a low carb diet and have always been a fan of the breaded poppers. This is a great and dare I say better substitute. My peppers were rather large so I ended up eating with a fork but that was not a big deal. I cannot wait to have these again...the recipe is perfect as is!

So simple - sooooo good!  I will make this again and again.  I did use gloves prepping the jalapenos - learned that lesson the hard way.  Even my picky eater friends tried these and loved them.

This was really delicious, they flew off the plate. I also used whole slices of bacon to wrap the jalepeno, otherwise the cream cheese would melt out. I also washed them really well to make it mild. Next time I'll try some cream cheese chives or another flavor. Yummy.

These were great. Though I saved some for later and came back to them about two hours later and all of the hottness went away from the jalapeno. I'm not sure what happened there, but they were fabulous anyways.

I had something similar at a party and they were so delicious I couldn't stop thinking about them. One thing the party-goers did was use onion & chive cream cheese instead of plain cream cheese. Honestly the recipe is a great stock recipe that you can personalize as I've seen other reviewers do so far.

Worth a try!

These are fabulous. I eat them all the time in the summer and they are great with COLD beer.
The more of the inside you get out of the pepper generally the less hot they will be. DO wear gloves all they way through the process of cleaning and stuffing.

WOW! These are SO good that my husband will volunteer to go get the ingredients from the store! :) I added a few shakes of dry ranch mix to the cream cheese for flavor...yummy! I usually make a bunch with turkey bacon for myself and the cooking time is about the same. These are a sure thing for a football party!

Easy to make.  Not enough flavor even though I did add green onions to the cream cheese.  Did take advice of cooking on slotted pan to minimize greese.  Next time will add chedder to sour cream.

I've made these for Superbowl parties and summer picnics for years.  Since I typically make enough to feed a small army, I buy the big cans of pickled jalapeños.  I also mix cajun spices with the cream cheese (preferably Tony's) before filling.  This recipe is always a hit!

I added 1 cup cheddar cheese and a whole slice of bacon to each one.  I thought they were time comsuming to make and you can only have a few.  They were good, but I probably wouldn't make again.

These were great!  I added a little garlic salt to the cheese & some shredded cheddar, not much, just a tad.  I didn't have any trouble getting the bacon to crisp, it was pretty greasy though.  I might follow the suggestion by a previous poster to cook the bacon & blot it a bit next time.

Very good, my husband loved them. I mixed some shredded cheese, garlic powder and cajun seasoning in the cream cheese and placed a piece of hickory smoked bacon on top-seemed to much bacon to wrap around it. Came out really tastey!!

My husband really liked these.  I was relatively pleased with the results, but found it difficult to get the bacon to crisp up.  I ended up having to broil them for a little while, but was disappointed with how the cream cheese mixture browned up...which was unavoidable if the bacon was to get crisp.  These were met with mixed reviews, but not all people are into hot & spicy peppers.  I will make these again, though, but will alter the cooking time and method.

These are wonderful! I've never looked up the recipe, but my husband makes them all the time.  I thought I would look them up to read reviews because I always get great ideas how to change things up a little bit. (Pineapple cream cheese,, yummy!) I've never even thought of baking though, we always secure the bacon with a water soaked toothpick and grill them.. Excellent, never any left!

Very good with turkey bacon-  However, an important note:
If you have veg friends and think it's a good idea to try this recipe with "fakin" or other soy-based meat substitute, think again. Yowch...the texture is too far off.

I have made this recipe years ago and still use it to this day. It is a recipe people keep asking me for a copy. I don't take all the seeds out I leave a few for people that like it extremely hot the more seed the hotter they are and I also always use herb & garlic cream cheese to give it flavor.This time I am going to try pieapple cream cheese as others suggested. Great for Mexican parties!!!

Little bit of heaven. I use turkey bacon, this makes them less greasy and more crispy! I also throw them on broil for just a few minutes to brown the cream cheese.

A big hit at our "Waiting for Hurricane Frances" party!  I will certainly make these again with the changes mentioned (breading them and topping with shredded cheese).  The cooking time was WAY TOO LONG.  I baked them for 25 minutes at 350 degrees and next time will add the shredded cheese at the last 5 minutes.
