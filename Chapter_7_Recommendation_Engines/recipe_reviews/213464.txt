The relish is great, but the chops were dry. I had grapefruit juice and oranges, so I used grapefruit juice instead of OJ for the brine, and orange sections instead of grapefruit for the relish.

Oddly, my review is the exact opposite of the previous reviewers: the pork was good and the relish was awful.  It may have something to do with the fact that the previous reviewer reversed the use of orange and grapefruit.  I also halved the salt.  I think this would probably be excellent if the grapefruit was omitted altogether and oranges used in their place.
