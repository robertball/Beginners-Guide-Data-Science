This is such a great recipe that seems to be loved by all!  I made a couple of changes- I just mixed the recipe ingredients with the raw sausage and baked a few minutes longer until cooked through. Also, I omitted the mushrooms for picky eaters.  These have a perfect balance of spices and create such a tender on the inside, crispy on the outside appetizer! Prepare ahead and make a double batch...you won't regret it!

We really like this convenient breakfast in a Ball. Hubs thinks they'd be great to take out on the hunting trail. I'm going to pack some to eat while traveling by plane next week. Next time I make I'll use Parmesan Cheese. Or maybe Swiss. This recipe is a keeper.

Definitely set the sausage out for 20 to 30 mins before mixing. I grated my own cheese and used the dough hook on my KA to mix the ingredients. I used a cookie scoop for the sausage balls and placed them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. The All Natural Hot Ground Italian Sausage puts these over the top. Make ahead and freeze for later.

Baking mix = Bisquick, or use a recipe from here to make it from scratch.

For the life of me I couldn't find the Hot Italian, so I used the Sweet Italian.  After mixing everything together I realized I had to cook the sausage first.  If you can bake a meatball, you can bake breakfast sausage!  Into the oven they went....raw.  They still came out perfect, held together nicely and were a huge hit at brunch.  The only change I made was the raw vs. cooked baking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to make a couple of small changes to this recipe, but it's so versatile that you can adapt it to suit your family's tastes.  I knew my kids wouldn't like hot sausage and mushrooms, so I used mild Italian sausage and diced apples instead of mushrooms.  Ahhh-mazing!  I know I would love this recipe with the hot sausage and mushrooms, and I'll make that in the future.  I can imagine many possibilities--sneak chopped spinach or kale into these for added nutrients. The shape is perfect for little hands.  Thanks Johnsonville!

These was amazing! We was really worried about the mushroom flavor so I cut the mushrooms back to 1/8c finely diced. We are making another version of these for breakfast in the morning with the maple sausage! Thanks Johnsonville for the great recipe!

This is a very easy and versatile recipe. My kid's are weird about onions and mushrooms so I used chiffoned spinach instead. I also use GF bisquick with no problems. These turned out great and disappeared fast!

These were really yummy.  I could not find the hot sausage in my store so used the Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage instead, then I substituted pepperjack cheese for the cheddar so I think that this was comparable to the original recipe.  We loved these will definitely make them again.

This is a great recipe.I never have browned sausage first. Always just mix it , Cheese, and Bisquick or whatever baking mix you choose, and blend with dough hook of the Kitchen-Aid. Form to balls and bake. Has always worked very well.

Great recipe, but I will use half of the onion next time-a little too much for breakfast for me. I may even use just a dash of onion powder instead the next time. Other than that, the mushrooms were good-I chopped them fine since I'm not a true mushroom-lover. Great recipe-thanks, Johnsonville!

This turned out pretty tasty!  The recipe as it stands is good however I decided to do some adjusting to make it diet friendly for us low carb-ers.  First for those that didn't know, baking mix is something like Bisquick so I made baking mix by using Carbquick flour, baking powder, salt and shortening then used heavy cream instead of milk.  I also doubled the recipe and used two chubs of hot sausage.  I browned the sausage as listed then mixed everything in a large bowl along with some additional onion powder and cayenne pepper for extra spicy.  I did not add any mushrooms because I forgot them at the store but they weren't missed at all.  The balls turned into lovely sausage biscuits that were slightly spicy and slightly moist.  Perfect for on-the-go or as a side for a nice breakfast.  Making them like this means low carb and great for diets.  Highly recommended!

I made he balls too big and they flattened out like cookies, but they were good. Next time I will make them smaller and add more sausage.

These were interesting. I cooked them for quite some time, longer than the recipe called for because they weren't done in the time it said. I was waiting on them to brown some. They were still slightly doughy. I was also expecting them to remind of something you'd have for breakfast. Just my misconception. They were somewhat tasty though!

I made these with the Johnsonville maple breakfast sausage instead of hot Italian since I am sharing the recipe with my kids. I used CountryGirlGourmet's suggestion to mix the uncooked sausage with the rest of the ingredients. It didn't affect the cook time at all, and the texture was really nice. These are VERY good.

This was a terrific party pleaser!  I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage.  I didn’t have baking mix so I used Homemade Baking Mix by fayyr on this site.  I used parchment paper on my old baking dish.  Next time I’ll make them smaller so they cook quicker and I can eat them sooner.  These WILL be on my next party table.  #AllstarsJville, #JvilleKitchens, #Fall

I ended up making a double batch of these tasty sausage cheese balls.  They are PERFECT to serve while watching football, or any time really.   I made these in my KA like the last reviewer, using my dough hook and they came out just perfect!  I chose the Hickory Farms Honey Pineapple Mustard to serve them with.  Outstanding!

Have been making these since Adam was first created.  I remove sausage from casing, smush it up and put in bowl with baking mix and very sharp orange cheddar. I use mild sausage so add a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. Mix altogether, form into golf size balls -- note that my personal preference is to leave out onion and mushrooms. I bake and enjoy. No dipping sauce required.

I make these all the time.  My entire family loves them and I am asked to make them in large batches.  They freeze well and are handy to pop in the microwave for a on the go breakfast.  I am gluten free and use a gluten free baking mix and it turns out wonderful.
