This may be a personal preference, but I like cold soups like cucumber and gazpacho a little thick.  I added 1-1/2 cups of vegetable broth (not 2), and this still was too thin for me; you literally could drink it.  I did use reduced fat sour cream and Greek yogurt.  It does have good taste, so if I make it again, I definitely will cut the vegetable broth in half, maybe more.  Also, I typically eat smaller amounts of cold soups, like not a soup bowl.  Considering that, this made way more than 4 servings in our house (made about 2-1/2 pints), so depending on much you normally serve, you may want to take that into consideration.  That's not meant as a negative remark, I just ended up with more than I would have liked.

Fabulous and a huge hit with a crowd.  Based on the other review, I also cut way back on the vegetable broth so it wouldn't be too thin.  Otherwise made exactly as written, yet tripled it for a crowd of 18 people -- and still had some left over (which I am enjoying right now!).  Delicious and refreshing on a hot summer day.

All of us liked this recipe incredibly. We chose to only use 1 cup of vegetable broth, instead of 2 cups. The flavor is very light, so I would recommend it for a summertime soup. We would definitely eat it again.

I followed the suggestions of others and halved the amount of vegetable soup. I also used non-fat greek plain yogurt and Nancy's cultured sour cream. And, I added lime juice. I felt it needed just a little zing.

My family really liked it. I followed the suggestions of adding less of the vegetable broth so as to get a thicker consistency. I used Greek yoghurt because it was the one I had. I would definitively do it again.

I also used only 1 1/2 cups of broth so the soup would be thicker. I also added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to give the soup  more body and creamier texture. I then used Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt to bring out the flavor. Chilling it in the fridge for 4 hours was needed to make it very cold. The result was a wonderfully delicious summer soup.

Blended all the ingredients in the food processor and added seal salt and Mrs. Dash to taste...also chopped cucumbers and added them.  This is so delicious and refreshing.  My teen age daughter loves it!!!  And so do I!

Very pleasant, though I just added a little salt to the end result, just as a personal preference.

It was way too thin. This would make a refreshing drink but too thin to be a cold soup. Taste was good though

Very tasty, definitely less stock than the original recipe called for. Went for half, could even dial that down. Maybe I'm "duh", but do you immersion-blend the herbs, or spoon blend? Knife skills I possess, but still the dill and mint were rather prevalent texturally, so I went back with the blender. I Did add some lime juice.

I haven't decided if it was too much mint or too much dill, but it just didn't appeal to any of us. My cucumbers were massive, and I thought I'd have to add MORE of the fresh herbs and broth. I ended up using half the broth called for, and a 'scant' 1/2 cup for each of the herbs, and found the cucumber overpowered.

Last time I made this I thought the garlic overpowered the taste of the cubes. So I skipped the garlic and added half a green bell pepper and a small hot red chili pepper (all the vegetables except the mint came straight from my garden). The result was extremely tasty!

I would totally make this again.  It is easy and refreshing.  I followed the recipe (even with the 2 cups broth) and did not find it too thin.  I did use less of the fresh herbs.  As written, I think they would be overwhelming.

Made it again.  I can understand the comments about too thin.  Will try with half the broth and see how that plays out.  Still about half or less of the fresh herbs depending on how you are cutting/chopping them.  Shaving off the leaves and leaving out the stems means much less needed.

First time I made cold soup and will certainly make it again.  Added 1 cup of chicken broth, 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce and about 1/4 cup of instant potato flakes.  Came out perfect to my taste.  Was well balanced in terms of flavour .  Thanks for the recipe.

It was awesome, I did leave out the garlic because of food allergies and I did only use 2/3 of the stock called for.   I added a bit of salt and floated a cucumber flower on the top.  40 women at a banquet all agreed that it was one of the best cold soups they have had. Will make again for sure and if no allergies will include the garlic.

I halved the recipe to try it out. I also halved again the vegetable broth, used 1T each of dried mint and dill since I didn't have any fresh. After tasting, I thought it was a little blab so I added a teaspoon of coarse sea salt and 1/2 t if ground black pepper. It is a slightly thinner cream soup consistency and delicious and refreshing.

I  used about one cup of Greek yogurt, one cup sour cream, 4 cucumbers (4th cut into pieces for texture in soup) , and vegetable soup base granules rather than adding more liquid (per other reviews stating too thin).  I also added shallot  and lemon juice.  Currently resting in fridge, but loved my last sample taste!  Was considering diced tomato and/or cold steamed carrots for topper/garnish.

Loved this and was a big hit as an introduction to a cold supper an a hot day. I increased the yoghurt and decreased the sour cream to make it less dense and have fewer calories.
