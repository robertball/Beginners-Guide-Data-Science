My wife and I love this recipe! I decided cook tonight and just had some chicken and looked for a good recipe and come across this recipe. Instead of crushed red pepper which we were out of I used Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb and it came out great! This is going to be a great recipe in our arsenal of great cooking. Thank you so much

Easy and fast; marinated it for 4 hours. I like all the ingredients but we just didn't care for the flavor.

As is.. not nearly enough marinade and the chicken didn't seem to pick up enough flavor... Double the marinade and then make some extra to use as sauce on the side. It was moist and easy to make

Good flavor but a little bland. I cooked it in the crock pot with the marinade. I only used 18 oz chicken but there didn't seem to be enough marinade so I will increase it next time.

This was really good and made the chicken so tender! I only used 4 half breasts and I'm not sure the sauce would've made it for all 6 called for. I also omitted the tomato puree because I didn't want to open a can of it for only 1 TBS!
