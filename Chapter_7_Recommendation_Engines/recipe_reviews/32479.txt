These are great.  My mom started making them years ago to cover up the taste of weight gain powder she had to feed my brother.  She would add extra peanut butter to hers.

I made it for my whole class. They loved it! It was great! Janice, thank you! It was te best thing anyonme brought in that day, except maybe thr candy for the activity. That wasn't supposed to be for the food part , though and the Georgia Shake was. The candy wound up being part of the food part because we had a lot of leftovers, but this was the best thing that was supposed to be part of the food part.

Fun way to end dinner tonight! I doubled the recipe but used more Reeces PB cups (bought one of those "king size" pkgs and used all of them!). Also, although I started with 3/4 cup milk (remember, I doubled it) but added until it got to the right consistency we enjoy (my family likes it thick). Very good and fun! Why didn't I think of this? :))) Thanks Janice!

My family and I agree this tasted much better the second time I made this because I added ice in the blender.

I did have the p-nut butter cup, I just used the ice cream and milk, and it was very good! Tonight I am going to make it using chocolate milk!

Um, hello? How could you not love this recipe? Peanut butter cups, ice cream, need I say more? My hubby isn't the biggest fan of the peanut butter and chocolate combo, but he loved this shake! I used vanilla ice cream and a couple spoonfulls of chocolate sauce instead of chocolate ice cream. Chopped up some more PB cups for garnish on top. Fabulous!

My husband loves these. I make them with a full package of Reese's, which is two peanut butter cups, and I only add just a little milk.

I'm not a big chocolate fan but Husband is, and he went nuts over this stuff. I added a little more icecream as he likes it pretty thick. Thanks, Janice! I'll be making this again!
