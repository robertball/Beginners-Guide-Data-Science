This dip was the hit of our party this weekend!  I will agree that it is definitely a garlic-lover's dip and might cut back to one clove of garlic next time.  I made this up the night before and put it in the fridge to let the flavors mingle.  It was teriffic!

Great recipe, but because this is "sun-dried tomato" dip, I doubled the tomatoes to 1/2 cup and got more of the flavour I was after.

After reading through the recipe, I thought I would like this but knew 2 cloves of garlic and 3/4 tsp. salt seemed heavy handed, at least for my tastes. I used one clove of garlic and 1/2 tsp. salt and was very glad I made those adjustments. I think this is an "either you like it or you don't" kind of recipe, no in between. Hubby said it was ok, but nothing special.  But the fact that he only tried one taste and didn't go back for more spoke more accurately--he didn't care for this at all. While I liked it a little better than he did, I don't believe I'd make a point of making this again. A bit lacking in flavor, this was nothing extraordinary or memorable.

This is delicious! Much better than a store bought dip. I doubled the amount of sun-dried tomatoes and used garlic powder. Real garlic can be too strong when it is not cooked. Added salt and pepper to taste and omitted the hot sauce. Hard to stop eating! Thanks for sharing!!

I made this dip because I was in a rush to bring an appetizer to a party. It was a HUGE hit at the party!  The only thing I would change next time is using one clove of garlic instead of two. I'm a garlic lover, but people said they could smell the dip from across the room. Also, I only had 4oz of cream cheese, but it seemed to be fine without more.  I used several dashes of Tobasco, and instead of fresh basil, I used a few dashes of dried.  It was delish!

I brought this dip to a dinner party, and all 6 people absolutely loved it.  There was not a drop left!  I increased the sun-dried tomatoes to 1/3 cup, used garlic powder equivalent to 1 clove, and used salt and pepper to taste since the tomatoes are already salty.  I made a day ahead, and was thrilled with the results.  You should not leave out the fresh basil as suggested by some reviewers, as it is an important taste in this delicious and EASY recipe.

Loved this one! Very gourmet tasting, but easy too. Great on toasted crostini bread slices, and as previously stated, try pita chips. (they don't compete for flavor with the zingy dip) Celery & cucumber would go well, plus try stuffing into cherry tomatoes as a wow appetizer.

this was yum. I used sun-dried tomato pesto as well as some oil-packed tomatoes and it turned out deliciously! I also cut down the mayo and cream cheese as others suggested. Will definitely make again.

This was really good. I usually don't try recipes until they're already rated, but this one sounded good, so I decided to go for it. I wasn't disappointed. I took it to a dinner party, and everyone loved it. I served it with crackers and veggies, and it was yummy both ways. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!  This was really an outstanding dip that was a huge hit with everyone at the party.  No one could belive how simple this was since it tasted so special.  I followed the recipe except for two minor changes, I used garlic powder since I agree that raw garlic can be a little overpowering and I used sun-dried tomatoes that weren't packed in oil  They were just the ones that are dried and in a bag and they were fabulous!  I also used dried basil instead of fresh.  I love that I have everything to make this wonderful dip in the house and I can whip it up at a moments notice.  I sliced french bread, topped it with a little olive oil and sea salt, then toasted it in the oven for a few minutes.  We tried it with pita chips and that was great too, but I think veggies would be perfect.  I am going to spread it on crostini and sprinkle some fresh basil on top for Christmas to accentuate the red and green.

Very good. Would make an excellent bagel spread. I used light cream cheese and cut back on the garlic. Delicious.

This was good, but definitely for people with certain tastes. (I loved it!) Those who liked it loved it, and those who didn't, really did not like it. Must be a sun-dried tomato thing. I had a lot of leftovers (from a potluck).

Oh my gosh, I love it!  Used 1 clove of garlic like mentioned by others. I love the flavor of sundried tomato so this recipe will be remake again and again. Loved it so much remaking for Memorial Day picnic so I've updated this review. Still love it! Seems so do my guests. Update (original review was 5-25-12) I'm back to make it for a Thanksgiving Party! Still love it, still add the garlic.

I took this to a party last night and it was a hit!  Made changes suggested by others. Doubled the sun-dried tomatoes, only 1 clove of garlic. Also used 3/4 cup sour cream and no mayo (did not have). It is thick, more of a spread than a dip. Will definitely make this again. thanks!

I served this dip with Mini Toasts from Trader Joe's. Everyone said it was addicting. (Even the kids loved it.) The flavor ripens beautifully when the dip is made a few days ahead. Also great as dinner with a nice glass of pinot! :)

This is terrific!  I doubled the tomatoes and added a little extra basil.  I used 2 smaller cloves of garlic and only a few drops of hot sauce.  So easy and SO TASTY!  Thanks, Robin!

Very good!  Very Easy!  I too used 1/3 cup of tomatoes and only half of the garlic and it turned out perfect.  Made this for a baby shower and there was only a little leftover.  Will definitely make again!

As written the recipe only yields 3 stars. I love garlic and always add more but didn't here and it was strong. I only made a half batch and it was tons. So with one clove of garlic 4oz of cream cheese and half of everything else it was lack except in the garlic flavour. This is a sun-dried tomato dip with hardly any sun-dried tomato taste. In all I used a 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes in my half batch when the original only called for a 1/4cup. That's four times more. Then it was great and everyone loved it though it was still heavy on garlic.

EXCELLENT!!! Big hit at party's. I used Mike's Spicey Buffalo sause for the hot sause. Not too spicey and not too mild. Puts a nice sweet sour taste to it. Had every one asking for the recipe!!!!!!!!

We used one garlic clove and could have cut down on the salt.  We also used non-fat cream cheese, low-fat sour cream and light mayo. It was delicious!

Very tasty!  I didn't have any fresh basil (unfortunately) so I used some prepared pesto in place of the basil and the garlic.  It turned out great!  It's a very thick spread - it would be great on a toasted bagel!

I made this recipe earlier today (for a party tomorrow) with a few of the suggested modifications (less garlic and more sun-dried tomatoes). It was good but way too salty! I have been trying to temper the salt flavor for the last few hours - tried more mayo and cream cheese and it's still just OK.

YUMMY!  I omitted the mayo b/c it grosses me out and just added more sour cream.  Still tastes great.  Oh, I also cut back on the garlic, and it was plenty garlicky.  Great with crackers, pita chips, tortilla chips, or even as a sandwich spread!  GOOD STUFF.

I took this to a bridal shower and it was a very popular dish.  Easy to make.  Be sure to refrigerate for a while ahead of time to allow flavors to come together.

I like this recipe. Only when I make it I omit the basil and I use 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and combine all at one time without chopping the tomatoes, in my mixer. Thanks, it really is tastful and elegant as well as practical and easy. YUM!!

I make this almost everytime we have company.  It is requested by all the men in the family.  Sun-dried tomato's are a staple in my pantry now!

Very good recipe. I made it for a party I was having and it was a hit with most! Some didn't care for it, but as for the majority...it was great. I made another batch a few days later and added it to hot penne pasta, along with julienne sundried tomatoes. It was excellent, made for a very creamy sauce.

This is an excellent dip to throw together in a hurry.  It literally takes only a minute to whip up in the food processor.  I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I omitted it.  I used a couple of generous shakes of Tabasco and it added a nice zing.  I may cut back a tiny bit on the mayo next time, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Made the mistake of serving this terrific dip with veggies as an appetizer.

My guests chowed it down and then weren't all that hungry for dinner!

Excellent flavor.

8.7.18  I put this in the fridge overnight, and the flavor improved greatly.  Bold, robust, and savory flavor, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Served today with Air Fryer Zucchini Chips, also a recipe on this site.

This recipe was a hit at the BBQ I went to this weekend. The only change I made was to double the amount of sun-dried tomatoes used. I paired the dip with pretzels, tablewater crackers and pita chips.

I didn't have sour cream so subbed with plain Balkan yogurt.  I omitted the salt altogether as the sun dried tomatoes are quite salty.  It turned out perfectly to my taste and was gobbled up by our guests.

we all loved this! served it with french bread slices, pita chips, and carrot sticks. all were great, and i kept changing my mind which way was best. i might add more tomatoes next time to really bring out that aspect of the flavour, but it really was delicious as written!

Delicious! I didn't have oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, so I soaked them in a little olive oil before adding to the recipe (maybe 2 tsp worth, just to soften them up).  Great blend of flavors - this goes well with chips, cracker, tortillas or a veggie platter.

Absolutely, it is so simple to make and delicious.  Now I have made it frequently.  Its taste is far better than any store-ready dip.  If you like sun-dried tomato, I would recommand you to try this recipe.

First time I made as directed.  I agree with others to cut garlic to 1 clove. Second time and added 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke and omit basil for a different taste. My family loved it! This will be a keeper!

I have made a version of this, add 1/2 cup black olives, the ones in brine, and do 1/2 feta and 1/2 cream cheese, (leave out the mayo) it isn't pretty but it tastes fantastic. Instead of mixing all the ingredients together, you can do the cheeses together and then do the tomatoes, olives, and garlic with a bit of olive oil and have it dripping over the top of the cheese, add a bit of fresh green basil to make it pop and it will look and taste great.

this went untouched at our superbowl party.  The pepper seemed to overpower the other flavors.  Otherwise it was bland.  Maybe if I had made it the night before the flavors would have been better.  I won't make this again.

I also just put in the sourcream & mayo to taste.

I just had Onion and Chive flavored cream cheese so I thought, what the heck and used that instead of regular cream cheese.  I also left out the mayo because I'm not a mayo fan and added more sour cream.  When I first mixed up the batch, I wasn't that impressed and figured I had ruined the recipe.  After letting it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge, the flavors blended and this recipe was a tremendous success.  I'm expected to bring it to the next party.

I agree with other reviewers that this dish may suit the tastes of some but I did not care for it at all. No one at my party of 8 ate much of it when I served it on various crackers. It might be better with vegetables but I probably won't try it again.

This recipe caught my eye because I love sun-dried tomatoes and am always trying to find new ways of making them so I was really excited to try it.  Unfortunately though there was just something "off" about this.  I think it might have been too much garlic but I really didn't care for this.

Brought this to a party and got mixed reviews.  My husband thought it was just "okay".  One of my close friends asked for the recipe.  Will make again but with more hot sauce (used 4 dashes this time)and an extra clove of garlic for an additional kick.

My sister liked this, but I thought it was just o.k.  I used it as a pasta sauce, which would be better with maybe some milk added to make it creamier and not as thick.  It seemed to be missing something in the flavor, too.  I used plain whole-milk yogurt instead of sour cream, but it seemed to be almost the same consistency, so I doubt that mattered.  I probably will look for another sun-dried tomato recipe.

I wasn't a huge fan myself, but all my friends enjoyed it.  I found that it lacked flavour and kick.  I would definately recommend using more than just a few splashes of hot sauce.

I've made this a few times already and its a crowd favorite! I only put one tsp of garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic as other reviews I had read said it was much but the rest I kept the same.  Easy putting all ingredients in a food processor and whirl away!

This is an easy keeper.  Other than having my blender stop, I had to finish with my hand mixer.  That proved not to be such a problem as I liked having pieces of the sun dried tomato instead of having it all blended in.  I did add a little Tuscan blend spice seasoning.  Important to be sure to let the blend sit for at least an hour or so.  It was a hit with only about 2 tablespoons left in the bowl ....... saved that and used as a chicken sandwich spread. Very good

Really, really good!  I followed this exactly.  The flavours were extremely well balanced, and it went equally well with veggies and chips, which I find isn't usually the case.  The bowl was practically licked clean lol.  I added just enough Franks hot sauce to give it a bit of zip since there wasn't an amount listed...about a teaspoon (didn't measure, just shook it in).  Was great!  I served this with blanched asparagus, red pepper strips, and pita chips.

Wow, this was definitely a hit with my young kids. Excellent flavor and I followed the recipe to the T. The garlic was NOT overpowering and the salt was the right amount.  Great job, will definitely make over and over again. ;)

This was very good, though I used about 3/4 C of tomatoes when all was said and done. I would probably omit the mayo next time and just use sour cream. It was definitely better the second day, as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

Just as the reviews have stated, this IS an amazing dip. I followed the recipe as written except I added a few more sun-dried tomatoes and an extra scoop of sour cream as it was a little thick.  I took it to a party and across the board it was liked, including by my "taste tester" ... kids (5 & 7) and my husband! 

However, if you want to take this recipe from amazing to excellent...once it is mixed (as written) add it to salsa!! WOW, does it make it even better..or you could make a double batch and leave one "as is" and mix the other half with salsa (I used black bean and corn salsa) to desired thickness and serve. 

Served with cucumbers and veggie flavored chip/crackers. A definitely party must!!

This was delicious. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and increased the amount of sun-dried tomatoes and used only one clove of garlic, though it was a large one. I also mixed it by hand, not in a food processor. Everyone at my party raved about it.

One of the best dips I have ever had!!  It was gone within a matter of minutes.  I did not have the fresh garlic so I used powdered garlic and omitted the basil.  I can only imagine what it would have tasted like with the recipe as-is. Wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good recipe.  I forgot the garlic and the hot sauce and threw in a spoonful of pesto instead of the basil and it still tasted great although next time I will try and remember the garlic!

I made also as listed, but found it way too salty! Which is weird because I am an unofficial salt addict...actually wait I lied I had to use dry herbs instead of the fresh, so that probably added to this low rating.  With that said i think i might try it again with fresh herbs but definietly will use the salt to taste...

I couldn't find sundried tomatoes when I went to the store so I made some modifications and it turned out pretty darn good. Instead of sundried tomatoes I did a can of regular diced tomatoes and a can of spicy tomatoes- jalopenos added. Then I added taco seasoning to taste and a touch of Old Bay. I reduced the garlic and kicked up the pepper a few notches and it made it into a nice southwest taco dip.

Very quick and easy.  I used fresh (just made them today) sun-dried tomatoes- so no oil.  I put in very little salt, dried basil, garlic powder, and 1 1/4 cups of sun-dried tomatoes.  That was just about right.  Still not too heavy on the tomatoes flavor- just right.  Spicy!

Good dip, I am not a huge fan of sun dried tomatoes, but had some in the house that i was going to use for another recipe but decided to try this for a party i was having this weekend. Everyone liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was OK, but not something I could get really excited about.  One garlic clove was definitely enough.  I served it at a party, and one guest did comment that he really liked it, but it didn't disappear as other appetizers did.

Fantastic! Everyone that had it loved it. Even people who normally wouldn't eat sun dried tomato liked it. I was asked to make it for an office christmas party and I cann't wait to hear the comments of everyone. Will keep you post it. I definitely recommend this recipe.

should change the name to garlic basil spread. I sure couldn't taste the tomato and the basil dominated and it was too thick to be called dip. even using heavy duty crackers. I will not be wasting my time and money on this recipe again.

I omitted the mayo and can only imagine it would have been even worse!

This dip was EXCELLENT!  It was a hit! I would definitely try regular mayonnaise instead of a Miracle Whip style dressing if you don't like tangy and let it sit overnight to let the flavours blend in.

Fair. DIdn't have slot much of a tomato flavor -- it is also hard to chop up sun-dried tomatos- added more basil ( I used the dried basil and it worked) -- Have had better dips by far.

This dip is GREAT! I have made it several times for parties and people love it! I have used both fresh basil and dried. I prefer the fresh, but the dried works well if you don't have any fresh basil on hand. I love it with pita chips and celery is good too! I'm tempted to make this just for myself to eat....

This was good...I doubled the the tomatoes and used half the garlic as others suggested.  Easy to make with ingredients I had on hand, not sure if I'd make it again.

This dip was magnificant.  I absolutely love it.  I plan on taking it to a Super Bowl party. The only thing I left out was the basil.  My wife doesnt like the "black licorice stuff."

Very tasty and easy to prepare. Used jarred minced garlic as a timesaver. Very pretty as well as yummy. Great for a party!

The next time I make this and there will be a next time. I'll reduce the amount of garlic to one clove as I found that it was a bit overpowering and I like garlic. My daughter's friend loved it though she sat beside it with some breadsticks and hardly moved all night. Thanks
