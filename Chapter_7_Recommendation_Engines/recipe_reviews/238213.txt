These were tasty! They are a bit on the thick/rich side so keep that in mind. I did use 2% light Velveeta and light Hellmanns mayo, and that worked very well. Also, I boiled my potatoes whole then peeled and cubed them b/c they hold less water that way, IMO. These do thicken upon standing, so you want to heat them as soon as you can after taking them out of the oven. All in all, the family liked them and I would make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I personally added more bacon and used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo. I didn't like how sweet it turned out, but my husband loved it! I think adding a half cup of mayo(not miracle whip), and half of sour cream instead of a full cup of mayo would be even better! I'm totally going to try that next time. :)
