This is a great recipe. The crust was chewy, and the texture was very fine and delicate.I followed the recipe with just two changes. I did not have the cheese listed so I used shredded cheddars.I also crumbled 3 slices of cooked bacon. This is one of the best bread machine recipes I have made.

I used Sharp Cheddar, Jack, and hard Parmesan cheese, about 1/3 of each.  That was based on what I had around at the time.  It came out great.  Next time 3 jalapenos.

Flavor was ok, but the liquid to flour ratio was of.  Dough was crumbly and bread was dense. Needed more liquid or less flour.
