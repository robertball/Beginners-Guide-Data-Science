I was a tad wary of this recipe. I'm not from the South so cooking w/ Coca Cola seems foreign. And the dry rub had cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves which seemed a bit unusual.  That said I followed the recipe faithfully and it was very good. I trimmed the brisket by hand once I had it home so much of the excess fat was gone. Also, I did sear the meat with dry rub in a cast iron skillet 2 minutes / side and I think that is an important part of the recipe. The process forms a crust on the meat. I extended the cook time an hour - so a total of five hours and for the last hour I removed the cover. The result was a flavorful fork tender brisket that everyone enjoyed.

I made this dish for Christmas this year and everyone loved it. I did do a few things differently. I did not add the carrots, celery, or lemon juice but it came out wonderful. I had a huge brisket so I ended up cutting it in half and putting half in the slow cooker and half in the oven in the pampered chef deep covered baker. The one in the baker was better but both were good. Even with how much meat I had there was enough of the rub. The meat just fell apart when we went to cut it. This was fine because we server it over rice. I am going to try this again with a beef roast tonight. This is a great dish. The left overs were good as left overs but not as good as the first night. Sorry I did not take photos of it. Next time I make it as a brisket I'll take photos.

Not difficult to make just need the tome for cooking. Brisket came out so tender. Good flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and incredibly tender. I added some garlic powder to the rub because we love garlic in everything, but Iâ€™m sure it would have been divine without it.

First time cooking with Coke. I must say I'm not a fan of the sweetness, and the thick molasses-like sauce that coated everything (also was a nightmare to clean.) Not a bad recipe in itself, just not my taste.

We just made it and it was very good, with a slight adjustment for next time. We made a 2 lb, not 4 lb brisket. The kosher salt was cut in half but was still too salty for our taste. And we used Diet Coke and that was great!

The aroma was lovely, but the cinnamon in the dry rub was overpowering.  I didn't find the brisket overly tender. In fact, although there was plenty of liquid the meat was actually a bit dry. I didn't know if I should remove the fat cap, so I left it on and cooked the meat fat-up (to allow juices to flow into the meat).  Not sure if I should have removed it.

I had reduced the amount of salt, because the last two times I made it, the veggies were bitter
