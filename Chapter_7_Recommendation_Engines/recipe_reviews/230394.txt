We eat a lot of cooked apples, and I think this may be the best that I've ever had.  The citrus zest and juice are what make this so awesome.  In the future, I will cut back a little on the white sugar.  But that's just a taste preference, as I typically don't like really sweet applesauce. Thanks, Annie, for a great new side dish.

Excellent Recipe! Totally Delicious! 
The lemon and orange zest adds a unexpected zing that guests don't expect.

Yummy!  Made it up to stir in my oatmeal. I cut down on the white sugar but very delicious.

made it as written and very good with more flavor than
traditional apple sauce.  I have made it two more times
using rum (2 oz.) or absinth (2oz).  Good both ways.

Wonderful!  This is an amazing chunky applesauce!  I plan on serving it warm topped with vanilla ice cream for a dessert and also using it for breakfast topped with granola.  I used 3/4 cup raw cane sugar instead of white sugar and also added the 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar.  I used Paula Red apples that I had on hand for the applesauce.  My husband loves it!  I'll be making this applesauce often.  Thank you for the recipe!
