This tastes very similar to an aji sauce I find at a local Peruvian restaurant.  The first time I made this was about a month ago, and I've been hooked ever since!  It's great on chicken, rice, and can even be used as a salad dressing.  To achieve the preferred consistency, I like to use a mixture of two-thirds mayo and one-third olive oil instead of just mayo.  Thanks Dorothy!

This stuff is addicting. Thank you!!
I used more mayo, left the seeds in the jalapenos, and didn't have any green onions.... 
You can't go wrong with this delicious sauce!

It's an amazing sauce!! It's modeled after "El Polla Inka " restraunts famous "Aji green sauce". I had to added some water to get it to blend in the blender, add just enough to get the blender to mix it. Otherwise it's too dry and the blenders blade just spins without actually mixing the ingredients. It's great on white rice, eggs, bread and especially rostarrie chicken (just like the restraunt serves! ) I live no where near one of there amazing restraunts,  so I have had to only dream of there green sauce. But not now, thanks to the person who got the sauce finally right!

AWSOME recipe ! Added about 1/8 cup of Olive oil instead of the entire 1/4 cup mayo. Taste was great!

With my changes, I would give this recipe 5 stars.  The end product wasn't creamy enough for my liking, so I used 3/4 c of mayo (next time will use 1 cup) and I also used 3 cloves of garlic.  I didn't want it to be too hot, so I only used one jalapeno and I thought that was perfect.  I was trying to replicate a Peruvian chicken dish that came with this fantastic and addicting green sauce and with my changes, this comes very close to it.

I followed the original recipe with a generous "half bunch of cilantro" and loved it!  Thanks Dorothy!

I like the aji however I definitely had to add a smidgen of water and a drizzle of olive oil so  the ingredients would blend. I also added half a lime juice for a little zest and a couple of mint leaves. Taste tested and thought it was great.

This was very good and probably as close to the original as you can get without having authentic ingredients. I think it could definitely use more cilantro next time but "half a bunch of cilantro" can be pretty subjective depending on your bunch. :) Now I know to use a generous amount of cilantro. Will definitely make again!

I used a large handful of fresh chives from the garden instead of the green onions, and used pickled jalapenos as I did not have any fresh ones.  I had less cilantro and only half a small head of romaine on hand - otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My husband said it was the best thing he had ever tasted.  Out of curiosity, I will try the original recipe next time, but it is hard to imagine it being any better!

Almost.  In my opinion, this recipe needs a bit of lime juice or white vinegar to get a bit of a bite. I also thought it was better with the addition of some ground coriander and cumin

It was very close to our favorite restaurant's version. I'll probably leave the seeds in the jalapeño next time to try and get closer.
