This is a great recipe. I place the potatoes in just enough water to cover over them about 1/4". I add the vinegar to the water when boiling the potatoes. This gives the potatoes the vinegar taste as well as making them more tender. It also will not make them fall apart if over boiled. Try it you'll like it!!

My family really enjoyed this potato salad.  I did sauté the onions a bit in the bacon grease because we don't like raw onions. As it sits, the potatoes do soak up the dressing, so next time I make it, I will double the dressing so it stays creamy.

I used this recipe instead of my tried and true recipe from Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (which was very much like the German potato salad that my mom used to make. 
 I was convinced by the strong reviews, and thought the   creamy dressing was a good compromise between cold potato salad and hot potato salad.  I must say I was pleased that it got rave reviews at our July 4th family gathering at the shore.  Thank you for sharing!

This was a pretty good german potato salad.  We had to make a bunch of substitutes for ingredients due to our location, but it was still enjoyed by all.  We used homemade plain yogurt  instead of sour cream, leek greens instead of chives and lime juice instead of cider vinegar.  We also added in green chiles and red pepper to give it a pretty vibrant splash of color.  We had too much of the suce for the amount of potatoes, though so it was a little soupy.  Next time I'll decrease the amount we made.  Day 2 and we just finished it up.  It's a good leftover!

Great recipe. Has a tangy but not overpowering taste. Just the vinegar mix would also make a great salad dressing, FYI. 

Made two substitutions; I used plain Greek yogurt in the place of the sour cream and green onions in the place of the red onions. I also cooked the green onions. (Not a fan of raw onion heartburn, or the bad breath it can bring.)

When adding in the vinegar/creamy dressing mix to the potatoes, be sure to add it in increments. I ended up only using about 2/3 of mine as I wanted a thicker consistency to my potato salad.

I really liked this.  Tangy taste, but doesn't make you pucker.  I did add vinegar to my water while cooking the potatoes.  It is a very good tasting cross between the standard mayo dressing, and your original german potato salad dressing.  Definitely let your flavors blend a bit in the fridge for the best taste. everyone loved it.

I never made it with sour cream before. Gramma  Benz never did.  Having some health issues made it difficult for me to tolerate vinegar.  Adding the sour cream made all the difference.  Thank you for giving me an old family favorite back.
