This was very good. I didn't have frozen carrots so I used canned and it still turned out fine. I also added a dash of garlic and onion powder in place of the minced onion. This dish made a lot so make sure you have a few mouths to feed if you make this, next time I'll half the recipe.

The onion was a littel bit much.  I would use garlic powder instead, in a smaller quantity.  My children LOVED this...even the super-picky 8-year old!  I will make it again.

It was good.  My mom always made homemade mac 'n cheese with just velveeta, butter, and milk, but I never liked it.  Nowadays, if I make it homemade, I use various cheeses (cojack, cheddar, etc.).  This was really good though.  I had fresh carrots that I boiled for a bit before putting it in the cheese mixture.  I used onion powder and garlic powder rather than flakes, which I don't have anyways.  I added some of the carrot water to the cheese mixture.  I used cheddar, extra sharp cheddar, and generic velveeta.  After two of us eating this (technically 3 I guess since I'm prego), there was  A LOT leftover.  I'm a VERY pick 23-year old and wasn't sure about the carrot thing.  I'm glad I tried it.  This is a keeper.

Creative use of mac and cheese, thanks!  I took a shortcut and used a boxed mix of mac and cheese, so I modified the directions a bit.  I boiled the noodles and carrots together & drained and then put the onion (and garlic--had to add that) and little smokies in with the mix from the box and the milk and butter, fried that for a minute, then mixed it all together.  It worked just fine.  I do prefer homemade mac and cheese, but when you have 20 boxes of the storebought it's hard to justify making it from scratch until the boxes are gone!  I like the add ins to normal mac and cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

My son loved it so I think that's a plus but the grease from the cheese and lil smokies was extremely over powering for me

Instead of processed cheese, I like to used shredded sharp cheddar instead. I also like to add a little hot sauce. If you don't have Lil' Smokies, this is just as good with sliced all beef hot dogs. My kids inhale this whenever I make it--I don't usually make it for the grownups, this is usually best made when you've got kids over for a sleepover.

My kids love mac and cheese and little smokies, so I thought this would be the perfect recipe to sneak in a veggie!  They loved it so much, they didn't even mind the carrots!

I halved the recipe but used the whole package of lil smokies. Sour cream, mixed frozen veggies in place of milk and carrots and some ground mustard. It looked a little juvenile when I put it on the table, but my husband loved it. Who knew?
