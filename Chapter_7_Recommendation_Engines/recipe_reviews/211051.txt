This is definitely 5 stars if only for the ease of it.  However, it tastes great, too, as I used homemade sauce (not having any jarred sauce on hand).  It was cheesy enough with half the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  It was not dry at all--actually, perfect.  Although it makes 8 servings, it really only serves 3-4 people.

I love this dish and it is so easy to make.  I changed it up a bit and I add 1 can of rotel to give it a little more flavor.  I also only use 1/2 of a container of ricotta cheese and I used a full bag of cheese in the dish and then half a bag of shredded cheese on top.  The cheese I used was colby and monterey finely shredded.

So quick easy to make. Mixing the Ragu & water  made the whole dish taste better!  You know how sometimes the sauce separates from the pasta?  Not when you make it as directed!  We really enjoyed the dish and will make again.  I did sprinkle in some onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper before baking.  Oh and I didn't have any parm, didn't even miss it!

I made this recipe the other night and it was great.  Instead of using jar sauce, I used homemade sauce I had made a couple of nights before and it was a great way to use up the leftover sauce.  I also had links of sausage in my homemade sauce so I cut them up and added them to the bake and it worked perfect.  This is a recipe that I will absolutely make again & again.

I loved this ziti! I only used about 1 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup Parmesan cheese, and it was plenty cheesy. It was a little bit mild, so I added a bit of hot pepper flakes to the dish. It was not dry, but I still kept a little sauce warmed up just in case. Will definitely make again.

It doesn't get much easier than this. I added ground beef and will add cottage cheese next time to give it a lasagna feel. My toddler loved it!

Yummy and so simple and quick to make. I used traditional Ragu because i dont like chunky sauce and just used less water in the mix and added garlic powder / crushed red pepper for flavor. Will make again

not my favorite - I made this last night for dinner. It could have used something......  I should have made additional sauce to add over the pasta when ready to serve.

This had a good taste, but was a bit dry.   Will use more sauce and water next time.  It was like the ricotta soaked everything up (if that's even possible).

For me a good base recipe, but was lacking in flavor. I will add some spices and maybe some cooked ground beef to keep it simple.

It was really good. The only thing I might do different next time is layer the ricotta instead of mixing it with the pasta sauce. The ricotta flavor got lost I thought....otherwise a great recipe. And I did add a layer of cooked ground beef on the bottom of the pan before putting in the oven.

I found this recipe back in 2002 and it called for 16 oz of noodles, not 8. It had been a few years since I had found my little recipe box (after  moving a few times) so I went ahead and followed these directions. It's tasty, but still 8oz of noodles is definitely not enough for 26oz of sauce and everything else it calls for. The noodles should absorb more of the other ingredients. Still a good recipe. :)

Easy and yummy.  I used nonfat plain yogart in place of ricotta and swiss on top.  I also added frozen corn.  Next time I'll add some diced onion and maybe some cooked ground beef.

I thought this was great.  I used my own brand of sauce and whole wheat ziti.  I also put some sausage in there too.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Super easy! I cooked up some ground turkey and added it into the mix just to make it more of a meal. I can't get over how easy this recipe was! I loved that you didn't have to boil the pasta and it was not dry at all.

I used homemade sauce instead of ragu but this recipe is a keeper. So easy to make and you could add in veggies or meat if you wanted to.

Wow.  Never new ziti could be so easy!  Love the way the pasta is put in dry. I added cooked and reheated italian sausage (from the freezer) to my husbands portion as he really doesn't care for meatless meal.  Great weekday meal and reheats great in the microwave for lunch the next day.   A keeper.

This is so easy!  Only 2 dishes to clean.  Really yummy.  I use whole wheat noodles, and nonfat cottage cheese instead of the ricotta (it's cheaper).  You can throw in some smoked turkey sausage, chicken, or turkey, but it's good without.  Easy street!

Yummy and so easy! This is perfect for those days when you really don't want to cook, mix a few things together. pop it in the oven, and an hour later you're eating. Thanks for the recipe.
