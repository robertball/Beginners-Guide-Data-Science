We've tried lots of different GFCF (Gluten and Casein Free) recipes for pancakes and they were... edible. Most were really flat like tortillas. Not this recipe! My kids had NO clue they were eating gluten free! (My daughter needs enzymes in order to consume wheat or milk products.) She thought they tasted like the real thing.

I did change a few things.... instead of the canola oil, I used applesauce. Instead of the buttermilk powder and 2 cups of water, I used almond milk. It was a little runny (so, I'd probably add the almond milk until it was the perfect consistancy.) I also added some dried blueberries to the mix. :)

Other than that, they were fluffy & thick and oh so good! The batch was big enough for me to freeze some. Every morning my kids wake up and ask for more yummy pancakes. Thanks a lot for posting this :)

This recipe is great! I used rice flour from an asian food market because it's ground so fine that you don't get that gritty taste that some rice flours have in the finished product. Instead of artificial sweetener I used one tablespoon of sugar. To one cup of the batter I added 1/2 cup frozen blueberries. To another cup of batter I grated one medium apple and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.
My family loved them and there was no aftertaste that some flours leave. Can't say enough about how great these were!!!

Excellent!  It really does have a consistency and taste comparable to wheat flour pancakes.  Much to the dismay of my long suffering family, I've tried many gluten free pancake recipes and store bought mixes...all of which have been disappointing.  I made a few changes to adapt to the fact that I couldn't buy dry powdered buttermilk, only dry powdered whole milk.  Since I substituted regular milk powder I also added 2 T (heaped) sour cream.  I also added 1/3 C additional water as the batter seemed a bit too thick.    Instead of xanthan gum I used 4T of gluten substitute.  I have found that the gluten substitute replicates the texture of normal wheat flour much better than xanthan gum.  Generally you use 2T/20 grams of gluten sub for every 1C/+-100 grams of gluten free flour mix.  I also added a can of rinsed blueberries which made them extra tasty!  I had extra batter left over which I used the next morning with the same great results.  Thank you Joe for this great recipe (my family thanks you even more)!

These are AMAZING pancakes! I couldn't even tell that they were GF! Instead of the 4 T. dry buttermilk and 3 cups water we use 2 T. Vinegar and enough milk to make 2 cups.  We also use real sugar. Thanks for this recipe!

This is a great recipe!  My husband doesn't even know I am using a gluten-free recipe - and I'm not telling him.  I did make a few changes, though. I have a grain mill, so I used 1/4 cup brown basmati rice and 1/3 cup regular brown rice milled to make 1 cup flour.  I also used 1 1/2 cups lo-fat buttermilk since I didn't have buttermilk powder (use in place of water and buttermilk powder).  I don't like the taste of artificial sweetners so I used 8 drops of stevia liquid (an herbal substitute for sugar)in place of the packet of sugar substitute.  They turned out great and I have used this recipe for family and guests alike and received rave reviews.  No one has even asked me if they are gluten-free.  You can add blueberries, too.  YUM!  Thanks, Joe, for a great recipe.

I used strawberry applesauce in place of the oil, and soy milk in place of the water/buttermilk powder. This was amazing!

This was my first gluten free recipe experience.  The pancakes were excellent.  I was afraid my kids wouldn't like them because we are used to eating whole wheat pancakes made with hard white wheat milled in our grain mill, and eat them several times per week.  My oldest son who is very picky loved them!  He said that they were so good you don't even need syrup with them.
The texture was perfect and I am glad I doubled the recipe so I can freeze some.  Here are the changes we made:
1 cup freshly ground long grain brown rice flour was what I used for the rice flour
rather than art. sweetener, 1 1/2 tbsp maple syrup added to the liquid ing.
Just under 2 c. buttermilk rather than milk/powder mixture
I also substituted 3 tbsp melted butter for the oil, mixing it into the liquid mixture with a hand blender.
So good!  This saves breakfast for my pancake eating family.

These were VERY good.  And yes, they really are indistinguishable from regular wheat based pancakes.  We used them in our waffle iron with excellent results.  Our only variation was to use egg substitute.  I was out of baking powder but found a recipe for it and happened to have all the ingredients necessary.  For anyone who needs it, just mix 1 part baking soda, 1 part cornstarch and 2 parts cream of tartar.  For this particular recipe I omitted the cornstarch since the recipe itself already had tapioca starch and potato starch.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with the following change, I used buttermilk for the liquid and substituted 1/2 cup montina flour for 1/2 cup of the rice flour.  These were so good that even those not on gluten free diets thought they were excellent!

These are delicious pancakes!  My grandchildren are wheat-intolerent, so when they came to stay, I made these pancakes for them.  They scarfed them up!  My son told me he cooks batches of these, freezes them, and they use them to make sandwiches and snackes.

This recipe is so delicious!!! I am casein-free as well, but I used soy yogurt and almond milk in place of the buttermilk powder and water and it still worked perfectly. I can already imagine the variations I can make with this recipe--some nut flour, vanilla & cinnamon are among the ingredients I plan to try next time. 

I will definitely be making a huge batch of pre-mixed dry ingredients to make this recipe much quicker on a busy morning.

**Follow-up: I made these today substituting 1/4 of the rice flour with almond meal, and added a teaspoon of vanilla and they were even more amazing than the first time. I think I might even add more almond meal next time since it didn't seem to affect the texture in a negative way and it adds plenty of protein so I don't have to feel so guilty about eating these several times/week! 

Also, if you let the batter rest for about 5 minutes before you pour it on your griddle, it will thicken a bit and give the soda/buttermilk (or in my case, soy yogurt) time to start producing bubbles making the pancakes super fluffy.

And a quick tip if you want to pre-mix a large batch of the dry ingredients to save time: use 2 cups of the pre-mixed dry ingredients and keep the liquid ingredients the same. And halving this recipe makes the perfect amount for me and my two little boys (4 1/2 and 1 1/2).

This is my first review on this site and also my first ever gluten-free recipe. I am simply AMAZED at how good these pancakes are! I was worried that gluten-free would mean yum-free, but I have been filled with hope and excitement because of these pancakes. The only modifications I made were: instead of buttermilk powder which I didn't have, I used 1 and 1/3 cup fat free lactose free milk and NO water. I also added a tbs of brown sugar to replace the sugar substitute.  I ran frozen blueberries under hot water and added them to the pancakes while they cooked. My husband never knew they were gluten free! My kids gobbled them up and I was so happy after every bite. I know you probably think I am silly, but this really has given me a new hope for living a better life. Wheat has been causing me problems since my first pregnancy and now I think I have the confidence to try lots of other gluten-free recipes! Thanks a bunch!

I did not care for this recipe. The interior texture is all mushy - no matter how you cook them, even when the exterior is nearly black (I tried this to see if they would improve), they still stay mushy on the inside! What a waste of expensive ingredients.

Amazing! I'm wheat, sugar, dairy, corn and oat free, so finding yummy things can be occasionally challenging. But this recipe is easy to follow and easy to alter. Instead of a dry sugar sub, I used 1 TBSP agave nectar, and 4 TBSP coconut milk for the dry buttermilk. Used 3 TBSP applesauce instead of oil, and reduced water to 1 cup. My hubby knows I have dietary restrictions, but he said these were so good, that he thought I used a box mix at first-until I started eating them too! ^_^ Thank you for this keeper!

AMAZING pancakes! I find buttermilk powder to be quite expensive, so I just use 2 cups of milk and add about 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to create the buttermilk.   Definitely a keeper - even my non-celiac family members devour them!

I have to say that I was skeptical when reading all the reviews for this recipe.  I'd heard many times before that things tasted comparable to the real thing, and then I found that I was sorely disappointed.  However, these pancakes truly are as good as ones using wheat.  They turned out so beautifully! I used brown rice flour instead of white, real sugar instead of the artificial sweetener, only 1 T. of coconut oil (replacing canola oil) and a mashed banana!  The results were excellent!  I felt like I was back in Hawaii again with my banana/coconut pancakes.  Thanks for helping me forget I was gluten intolerant for a day!

The whole family loved these!  We did make the following changes: 1) substituted lowfat buttermilk for the powder and water, 2) substituted 1 TBS sugar for the sugar substitute, 3) substituted 3 TBS butter (melted) for the canola oil,  4) used 3 eggs since they were small, and 5) added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Prepared the dry ingredients in one bowl and set to the side.  Combined the buttermilk and egg whites in one bowl and the melted butter and yolks in another.  Then added the butter/yolk mixture and vanilla to the buttermilk/whites and stirred.  Added the liquid to the dry ingredients, stirred until blended, and then let set for 10 minutes before making the pancakes.  We used to buy expensive gluten free pre-made mixes but not anymore.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

These are perfect. They taste almost as delicious as my "regular" homemade pancakes. The only change I make is that I use real sugar instead of sweetener. I also find that you want to cook these a little longer than you would "regular" pancakes.

Very fluffy & yummy!  My daughter can't have cow's milk... so I used 4T of plain goat yogurt, in place of the buttermilk.  I also only added 1 1/2 cups of water.  Instead of canola oil, I used melted coconut oil... added a great hint of flavor.  Be careful that your eggs & yogurt are not to cold to turn the coconut oil to the hardened form.  I had to wisk out the hardened coconut & warm it up again.  It was a pain, but worked out.  They were very delicious... I will definitely use this recipe again!

These tasted great & had a really good texture.  I used 1/2 c millet flour & 1/2 c brown rice flour.  I used potato starch in place of the tapioca flour since I didn't have any on hand (so I used 3 T + 1/3 c of potato starch).  I used 1 1/2 c coconut milk + 1T lemon juice instead of the buttermilk powder & water.  I used 1/4 c maple syrup as a sweetner.  So, um, yeah I guess this was nothing like the original recipe, but this version tasted great!  =)

These were excellent! I used buttermilk instead of the powder and water (2 cups of buttermilk), used extra light olive oil instead of canola, and used 1 Tbs. of sugar instead of the sweetener packet. I cooked them in unrefined coconut oil and had to use less than 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake since the batter was thick and made very fluffy pancakes. 
If you add a bit more coconut oil once you flip the pancakes, you will get a nice crunch over the entire surface of the pancake - yum!
This recipe is so much better than any GF pre-mixed pancake mix.

I just have to say, this is our favorite pancake recipe, Gluten free or not! We make these every Saturday and my family looks forward to it. But I have changed the flour a little because of allergies. I used cornstarch instead of potato. Plus just for fun sometimes I mix it up with sorghum and buckwheat. My daughter said, "You make the best pancakes in the world!" Of course I  take all the credit. LOL! This a great versatile recipe that turns out every time! THANK YOU!

These were amazing and a SUPER treat for anyone whether they are coeliac or not. So light and fluffy!  My substitutions: As I am allergic to egg I used a gluten free Organ powered egg substitute. In place of the buttermilk and water I used rice milk with a little drop of white vinegar so that the pancake would rise. Instead of the oil I used very finely grated apple and used 1/2 teaspoon or organic unrefined caster sugar instead of the sugar substitute. Before cooking I added blueberries in and when finally done, I poured agave and fresh strawberry sauce ( strawberries pureed with a little water mixed into the sauce, no sugar added). FABULOUS! Thanks for a great recipe for allergy suffers to enjoy!

Ditto, Ditto.  Although my husband did come up with one negative.  He said these are so good, he's going to eat way too many!  The kids didn't notice they were gluten free.  Both went back for seconds.  I made the basic recipe but substituted for what I had on hand.  Brown rice flour instead of rice flour.  Ground flax seed instead of tapioca flour.  Honey instead of sugar substitute.  I didn't have buttermilk powder or use a substitute.  It does take some time to make the recipe but that's true of nearly every gluten free recipe I've made - I'm getting used to it.  (My favorite bread recipe has 18 ingredients.)  Before I put everything away, I put together the dry ingredients for two more full recipes in separate containers.  That should make it much faster next time.

Great recipe!  I just used 1 1/4 c . all-purpose GF flour, 1/4 c. buckwheat flour instead of the rice & tapioca flours & potato starch. I also used 1 1/4 c. coconut milk instead of the buttermilk powder & water. I forgot the soda but it was fine without it. The family loved em.

These were really good!  We are just now learning about gluten free cooking and baking, but unfortunately we can not do eggs or milk products along with gluten.  I used Energizer Egg replacer instead of the eggs, and coconut milk instead of the buttermilk powder and two cups of water.  I also used half white rice flour, and half brown rice flour.  I will make these again, but may cut back the rice flour and use sorghum in the future.  They were definitely gummy rice flour in texture.  I must add though my kids scarfed these up faster than our usual gluten egg milk pancakes, and asked for seconds and thirds!

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to write reviews.  My husband recently decided to try going gluten free to stop the horrible stomach pains he has gone through for the last 5 years.  Not having the first clue, I have to rely on reviews and they are all on the mark on this one.  We loved these pancakes!!!!!  I didn't have potato starch so I had to sub tapioca flour and for the 3 tbsp of tapoica flour I used Bob's Red Mill GF Baking Mix.  I used Stevia instead of sugar and reduces the baking powder and soda because I live in a high altitude area.  Last, I slowly added the water to where I thought the consistancy looked good and cooked them on a griddle.  Perfect, fluffy, yummy pancakes.  Thanks to everyone!

Not sure whats going on with the recipe? The middle is gooey no matter what I tried. Medium heat, high heat and even low heat, they come out gooey. I even tried to bake them to see if it were possible, still gooey. I've cooked these about 4 times now. I followed the recipe exactly and its always gooey.

These are wonderful. Very light and fluffy - I have missed my wheat pancakes, but now I am OK! I did substitute coconut flour for the potato flour. I also thinned the dough a bit so they weren't too thick (more water). Otherwise I followed the recipe. I will try potato flour next time to see if they come out as fabulously.

Best GF pancake recipe ever! I got tired of spending a fortune on mixes, and now ground my own flour. I make a big batch of this flour and leave it in a canister so I can whip up pancakes quick. 

For a lower fat option I cut the oil to 1 tbsp and mash up a banana. I've also used coconut milk (Silk coconut milk in the carton, not the canned kind) instead of the water and it's so creamy and delicious!

You can freeze these and they re-heat without becoming crumbly and falling apart. This is the only pancake recipe we use!

These pancakes are simply amazing. They cook up brown and beautiful with a crispy outside and tender inside. I like my pancakes a little thinner then this recipe makes so I added more water and I had delicious thinner pancakes. I also substituted buttermilk instead of the water and buttermilk powder. Such a treat when I can't have regular pancakes!!!! Thank-you for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe, but I had to modify it.  2 cups of water made the pancakes too thin, almost like crepes.  I have to add only one cup of water then gradually add a little water until I get the consistency they way I like it.  

These pancakes brown well, and taste good.  Also this recipe can stand little mistakes and still come out well.  I'm not a precise cook so baking can be disasterous, but I've never made a bad batch, even when I mixed up the baking power vs. soda.  

The other great thing is the batter will last a couple of days in the fridge. 

Lastly I have a modification I make for special occasions (like PMS), I add 2 TBSP cocoa powder, about 1/2 cup sugar and chocolate chips.  Top with your own homemade whipped cream - spectacular!

These were great. My children with MULTIPLE food allergies loved these. I substituted soymilk powder for the buttermilk powder, used an egg substitute, used agave nectar for the sweetner, and added applesauce for moisture.  These are the best gluten free pancakes we have ever had... and we've tried ALOT of them! :) Thank you!

I have a son with dairy & gluten allergy that needs low sodium, so I modified your recipe. I think it tastes better.

Dry Ingredients:

1 cup rice flour
3 T tapioca flour
1/3 cup potato starch
1/2 t xanthan gum 
1 T brown sugar
3 1/2 t gluten free no sodium baking powder

1. Mix these in separate bowl and set aside.

2. Mix 2 cups of unsweetened almond milk with 2 T lemon juice; let that set at room temp for a few minutes

3. In separate bowl beat 2 eggs; add 1 1/2 t of vanilla and 1 1/2 T grapeseed oil

4. Add milk mixture to egg mixture and mix well

5. Add wet mixture to dry mixture and mix with spatula until large lumps are gone--leave the small ones. 

6. Heat skillet using grapeseed oil; use 1/3 cup batter per pancake

Note: Each pancake has ~35 mg sodium.

Probably the best pancakes I've ever had.  Modifications I made were 1/3 cup sorghum flour, 4 tbsp non-fat dry milk powder, 2 tsp evaporated sugar cane, and 3 tbsp Smart Balance oil.

My first experience making gluten free pancakes and these are soooo wonderful!!  My husband couldn't tell the difference and keeps asking for me to make more. They keep great in the frig and toast perfectly in my toaster oven for quick snacks and sandwiches. I didn't have buttermilk powder so I used 1 cup kefir and enough water to make a batter, less than 1 cup. I also used sugar instead of a substitute. Fluffy goodness!!!

These were fantastic, but the four stars is because I made a major change in the liquid. They were too runny and the pancakes were thin. So after I made the first few, I added about 1/2 cup more rice flour (approximately, I really just dumped it in til the consistancy was right). They they came out really good. Next time I will use less liquid from the start. Oh, and I used milk and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice in it instead of buttermilk powder and water.

WOW!  I just decided yesterday to cut gluten out in my 2 year old's diet as I am thinking she is intolerant.  This is my first gluten free recipe and I am so amazed, the flavor is much better than regular pancakes!  We are big time pancake people and these are absolutely delicious.  I used brown rice flour and 2 cups of milk instead of the dry milk/water, and 1 tsp sugar instead of the substitute.  I am stuffing my face while typing and can't get over how yummy they are :)

These are excellent - and do taste like "regular" pancakes.  The only changes I made was to add about a cup of frozen blueberries, and about 2-3 Tbs of ground flax seed, for a little extra nutrition and fiber.  Highly recommended for a gluten free alternative.

These were delicious! I'm not much of a pancake eater, but my husband is.  I found out about 3/4 wks ago that I have 36 food allergies.  This receipe was so easy to substitute a couple things more that I can't tolerate.  My husband is a very fussy eater and I wasn't sure he would even try them, but he was gobbling them up and giving ideas for fruit to use instead of the suggested blueberries - wow! He loved them and I really like them.  Thank you so much.  It is the first thing I've found that he will also eat,

These are great for gluten-free, but the consistency is not at all similar to regular wheat pancakes as described. The TASTE is great though! I made a few modifications to fit in w/ our diet: ground flax seed for eggs, 1 tbsp agave for sweetener, and almond milk instead of water. (I added about 1.5 cups.) My experience w/ xanthan gum is that there is a kind of "gummy" texture to anything I bake w/ it. I may need to explore other binding alternatives. All in all though, this is a great recipe and a keeper. My kids love them!!

My two teenage sons have celiac disease and have really missed having pancakes. Everything we've tried is almost inedible. These are the best gluten free pancakes we have ever made! I'm not a big fan of reviews that have a ton of substitutions, but I did have to make one substitution as we didn't have any buttermilk powder. Instead of the powder and 2 cups of water, I used 2 cups of milk, mixed in 2 T of lemon juice and let it sit for 5 minutes. The batter came out more watery than normal pancake batter, but my gluten free bread batters are more watery as well so I didn't make any adjustments. I did turn the burner down lower than for normal pancakes to compensate.  The pancakes were nicely browned on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. Amazing! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I use wholegrain rice flour, substitute the water for soy milk, leaving out the buttermilk powder (dairy allergies) and substitute guar gum for the xanthan gum, but these changes are superficial. The pancakes have more of a cornbread taste this way, however. The texture and rise is PERFECT. I haven't found a gluten-free recipe that looks and feels so much like the fluffy pancakes of my youth. I serve my pancakes with salsa and my two toddlers just love it.

Stop the car. The search for a real tasting pancake is over! My little boy couldn't believe these pancakes were gluten free. Yeah!I've tried a lot of recipes and this one was by far the best. I did question the amount of water indicated, but the batter did thicken after a few minutes, so I added the water gradually .

I sifted all the dry ingredients and added cinnamon and 11/2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Substituted Xylitol for sugar substitute, 2 cups coconut vanilla milk  for water and dry buttermilk and added milk to dry ingredients and stirred while mixing eggs etc.  This eliminates a lot of the grittiness of gluten free flour.

I only used 1 1/3 cups of water and also used regular dry milk powder and added bananas.  It was delicious, I couldn't tell it was gluten free pancakes.

These were just as yummy as wheat pancakes. I used 2 tsps of sugar instead of the sugar substitute, added 1 chopped up Granny Smith apple, and 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I also prefer a thicker pancake, so I only used 1 1/3 cup water. Thanks for sharing AC6AA!

Best GFCF pancake we've had!  We made it casein free by omitting the dry buttermilk and using coconut milk or rice milk (whatever was on hand) for the water.  Sometimes I add Enjoy Life chocolate chips, other times I add diced apple and cinnamon.  My pancake deprived 7 and 9 year old thank you!

These were excellent.  They were fluffy and tasted great.  I added 1 Tbsp evaporated cane sugar (instead of sugar substitute), real buttermilk (instead of powdered buttermilk + water), 1.5 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  I didn't have any potato starch so I substituted it for tapioca flour.  The pancakes turned out great even with the changes I made.

I debated between three and four stars for this.  The batter was very runny and the pancakes were thin.  I'm sure I should have added more flour, but was worried I'd mess up the proportions and the kids were too hungry already.  The flavor was pretty good, as close to regular wheat pancakes as gluten free gets, but if you're new to GF don't expect exact - ever.  We've tried so many that were barely edible.  I'm not giving up on this one yet.  Next time I'll try it with rice milk in place of the powder and water, and start with much less liquid.

When I first made these, I followed someone else's suggestion to use almond milk as the buttermilk powder substitute. The pancakes were good, but were still heavy like all other gluten-free pancakes I've made. This time, I just used water (and almost halved the called for amount!) and used 1 T. of agave nectar for the sugar substitute, and the pancakes were AWESOME. We all loved them....1 year old, three old, husband and all! Thank you for a great recipe.

Thank you, thank you for this recipe!  I made this recipe two times this morning.  My kids kept eating them up!  The first time I made them as originally posted.  I found them thin and kept adding flour to thicken.  The second time I followed Susan's suggestions of using Annalise Robert's brown rice flour mix (1.5 cups) and not even the whole 1.5 cups water.  I've been looking for a thick regular pancake.  The second batch turned out better as far as my tastes go.  They had a better flavor and were thicker.  I added chocolate chips both times for part of the pancakes.  Finally, I have a recipe I can make for my whole family and not feel bad that it is gluten-free!  Yummy!  It didn't take that long mixing it up.  It was worth it.

This is a fantastic recipe.  It tastes just like wheat pancakes.  We are dairy free as well so I took out the buttermilk powder entirely and used soy milk.  I used 1 cup soy and 1 cup water.  You could also use almond milk.

Great recipe!  You'd never know the difference between regular and gluten-free and you don't even have to buy the expensive mixes. :)  I use fresh blueberries rolled in a bit of rice flour so the extra moisture that comes out of them while cooking gets absorbed.  Thanks for the recipe!!

SUCH a great recipe! Since being GF, I've really missed eating pancakes -- even my brother and sister who aren't GF enjoyed them. I didn't have buttermilk powder or buttermilk on hand, so what I ended up doing was substituting 2 cups of milk (+2 tbsp of lemon juice) for the buttermilk, and they came out great!

Used guar gum instead of xanthan and 1-1/2 cups milk instead of dry buttermilk and water. Batter made around 20 pancakes. Easy to make. These do not taste gluten-free. Thank you!

These are really good!
I made a few changes since I didn't have buttermilk powder and had no intention of buying it. I substituted buttermilk for the water and instead of sugar substitute, I added about 1 Tbsp or a bit more of regular sugar. I also didn't have potato starch so I used cornstarch instead. 
I found the batter to be extremely runny and lumpy so I added a little bit more tapioca flour, cornstarch and a pinch more zanthum gum. For an added spice I added a couple teaspoons of cinnamon. 
These are WONDERFUL! You absolutely cannot tell these are gluten free.

Incredible!  my husband who is on a gluten free diet was so excited when i made these for him!  They are so much better than the pre made mix i bought at a health food store.  They taste and look(very important) like the real thing.  I threw in few blueberries to the batter as well.  I'll try and put a picture on here soon so you can see it to believe it!

Well named. Excellent recipe. We cut the water down to 1 cup. For the very best waffles we use one cup of milk and beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold them in just before baking. Thanks for sharing this great and versatile recipe!

These pancakes are very good. I also made them without the eggs and they were a little dense and filling but they still had a tender texture that absorbed the butter and syrup well and tasted yummy.

Great recipe. First time making gluten free pancakes. I used a flower blend and instead of the buttermilk powder and water I used milk and a little vanilla flavored coffee cream. I used a table spoon of real sugar instead of a substitute, added a bit of melted margarine and I put blueberries in  and served with cut up banana. I made some in a frying pan and then the rest I put into a muffin tin and baked for rushed morning breakfasts :)Definitely my go to pancake recipe for now on.

EXCELLENT!  This is truly a undetectable GF recipe.  Fluff, great texture, and yummy. Used 2 cups unsweetened plain almond milk with 1TBLS lemon juice (mixed and set aside for few minutes) as substitute for buttermilk powder and water.  Also added 1tsp vanilla. Served to reg wheat eaters and they LOVED them.

I enjoyed these very much.  I did substitute the dry milk/water as others suggested.  I used 1 1/2 cups skim milk that had added 2 TBSP white vinegar to make it like buttermilk.  I also used 3 TBSP splenda blend instead of the sugar-sub packet.  AND...I used 3 TBSP applesauce per another's suggestion.  Then right before cooking I tossed in fresh blueberries.  After cooling off, I froze some and had them for breakfast.  They are better fresh, but not bad at all after freezing and reheating in the microwave.  I don't like syrup, so I just had these plain.....again, they were very good for gluten free.

I made these pancakes twice and my whole family loved them! They were the best gluten-free pancakes we have ever had!  We added a little bit of cinnamon to them and that gave them a wonderful flavor.  We will be making these again for sure!

This was an awesome recipe.  Seeing the great taste and texture of the pancakes, I was anxious to come up w/a more fiber-filled version, & I finally did.  I thought I'd share for anyone wanting to do the same: For the rice flour, I used King Arthur Flour whole grain gluten free flour mix (a 71% whole grain blend of sorghum, amaranth, millet, brown rice, teff & tapioca starch). And then I used KAF hi-maize natural fiber (a cornstarch w/6g fiber per serving) for the potato starch, and only half the milk (used soured w/lemon juice milk) called for. I whisked it til smooth in my kitchen aid mixer, and used a 1/4 cup measure to ladle equal portions onto a hot griddle. These substitutions worked perfectly without comprising the character of the recipe.  I'll upload pics soon to show a better visual.  Thanks for such a great recipe that is good as is, but can also withstand substitutions (which is not always easy to do in GF recipes)

I've made these several times now for my husband who is on gluten free diet.  The last time I made these, I added sour cream, lemon juice, and lemon zest.  My daughter, who is NOT on the gluten free diet, said they tasted better than the regular pancakes I used to make.  My father in law who is NOT on a gluten free diet, told me I had to send this link to my mother in law who is on the gluten free diet to try.  These were yummy!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes.  I didn't have dry buttermilk powder, so I used 4 TBS milk plus 2 teaspoons of lemon juice.  I used 2 TBS granulated sugar instead of sugar subsittue.  I omitted the tapioca powder.   Added about 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla flavoring.  Since I used milk in this recipe, I decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups.  The batter will be a little "runny", but it didn't effect the taste.  I will be making these again and freezing them.  I will be adding blueberries next batch I make.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

These are delicious!  I'm on a wheat-free diet rignt now, plus I work in natural foods where we get a lot of customers that are gluten-free, so I wanted to try this recipe for them.  I substited 2 cups real buttermilk for the powder and water.  I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  They tasted really good!  The texture is not the same as regular pancakes, we found they were a little mushy.  But if you have to do gluten-free, definitely give these a try!

WOW!  These ARE delicious - tasted almost like crepes!  I sub'd homemade almond milk for the water/buttermilk powder & just added a Tbsp of brown sugar instead of sugar substitute.  FANTASTIC recipe that fooled the most anti-GF eater of our family!  Thank-you SO MUCH for sharing this...it is a weekly treat for us now!

These were really good! We are dairy free as well, so I substituted rice milk for the buttermilk/water.

Fantastic! These are delicious. They taste exactly like wheat ones! The only changes I made were minor ones and only because I didn't have everything. I used corn starch instead of potato, regular milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk powder and water, and salad oil instead of canola. It looks like a lot of ingredients but most of them are in every kitchen, and the uncommon things are common in GF kitchens (xanthan gum). I also used a tsp. of sugar instead of substitute. I did make a lot of changes but they were ones that you should be able to make in every recipe without changing much. Thanks so much for the PERFECT recipe. GF mixes are so expensive and these taste better!

Okay, I'm new the gluten free world, but everything I taste gluten free tastes bad to me. I can't stand the texture. This reminded me of griddled cream of wheat in texture. The taste was okay, but I found these pancakes very heavy and thick. It wasn't what I was expecting, but then when I could eat pancakes, I thought my husband's recipe from scratch were the best in the world. I won't do it again. I'd rather do without.

Wow! Was this good.  The pancakes are so light and fluffy, not heavy and gritty like some of the mixes I've tried. I used Authentic Foods' Brown Rice flour rather then the white rice flour. I also, based on other reviewers suggestions, substituted 1.5 cups milk mixed with 2 Tbsp. vinegar for the 4 tbs. dry buttermilk and 2 cups water.  I think reducing the liquid as well made it just the right consistency.  I look forward to trying it with the buttermilk powder (or maybe even real buttermilk-what a treat), just didn't have any on hand. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that celiacs as well as non-celiacs can enjoy.  Oh! And they tasted just as good warmed up in the microwave the next day.

These are great!  My non-GF husband loves these along with my two boys!  I did make a couple of substitutions: used dry milk for dry buttermilk, 1% milk for water and  3 tbsp sugar for sugar sub.  Had to beat really well to get the lumps out especially with the starches.  But the consistency and taste are excellent!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is by far the best I've found for pancakes AND waffles.  The other reviewers are right on track with the consistency and taste.  I used the Sour Cream variation and it was excellent.  For some additional flavors that "kid" friendly, I used a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and/or cinnamon.
Additionally, instead of the standard "processed" sugar substitutes, I use pure Stevia (1/4 tsp) which worked very well.
The best benefit of all is that this recipe is simple and easy to make for my youngest son who is Autistic and a picky eater.  This recipe goes a long way - I made 40 "dollar" size pancakes (about 2-3 tbl spoons each) and 20 "dollar" size waffles from the same batch.

Thank you!

Sometimes when I'm cookin'em up I place a few frozen blue berries on.  Their even good cold I take them to work for a morning snack ...WOW  !

This was better than the store bought gluten free pancake mixes that I have tasted.  The measurement of milk was maybe runnier than I like for my pancakes so I gradually add it in.  I found that it is perfect for making waffles too.

Best Gluten Free Pancakes, can't tell they are gluten free. I did make a few changes and they were the fluffiest pancakes so far. Family hit. I used honey for the sweetener adding it last and I used milk instead of water decreasing the amount by about 1/8 cup.

I recently thought I would like to try some GF recipes, to lead a healthier life-style. I also have my in-laws, some nieces, and other family members who have gluten intolerances, so the more GF recipes I master, the more options I have for family get-togethers. I was worried these would not turn out, as they smelled very GF as they were cooking. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. My 8 year old daughter declared them the best pancakes she had ever had, my 6 year old son said he didn't like the "bread part", only the M&M's (so obviously he didn't like them.), and my almost 4 year old and 19 month old scarfed them down without complaint. I thought they had a distinct GF taste, but they were pleasantly edible. I only had a GF all purpose blend, so I used that instead of the rice, tapioca flours and corn starch. I didn't have any buttermilk powder, so I used just over 1 C almond milk in place of that and the water. I used 1 T real sugar, and applesauce in place of the canola oil because I do not cook/bake with canola or veggie oil anymore. So thank you for a great recipe! I am hopeful that more of the recipes I want to try will turn out fine and enable me to make the transition to GF. :)

Gummy texture...No matter how long I cooked these they still didn't seem to cook in the middle.  Maybe it was because I used real buttermilk and not the buttermilk powder/water option.  I'm new to gluten free cooking and this was my first pancake recipe.  I could taste the potato starch.  My kids weren't a fan.  HOWEVER, I give it 3, almost 4, because they actually taste great cold.

We are not celiac but had a friend who came for breakfast brunch who is gluten sensitive, so we decided to do a batch of GF pancakes. This recipe is awesome tasting. It made about 25 3-4inch size pancakes. Only modification we did was replace buttermilk powder and the water with 2 cups actual buttermilk and thinned it out with some milk since the batter got too thick to pour. Added 1 diced banana and about 1/2 cup chocolate chip to batter and let the batter rest for 10 minutes while we worked on the other brunch items. Cooked beautifully and for a GF recipe, you would not notice much difference. Fluffy and moist and everyone enjoyed it.

I have tried this recipe several times forgetting that each time the end result yields a  watery substance. I think the original recipe might of been accurate but now it is anything but accurate. One cup of water, milk or buttermilk will suffice. I hope you read the bad reviews before wasting expensive ingredients.

Okay, I never review things.  I'm not even a member of this site.  Well, I wasn't until I felt compelled to join so I could tell you how amazing these really are!  

I just made them for breakfast, and they're incredible!  They really do fluff up like regular pancakes (and if you eat GF, you know what a feat this is)!  Despite all of the reviews, I had to make them to see for myself.  Mind.  Blown.

I substituted 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch for the tapioca flour.  And instead of water and buttermilk powder, I poured in soy milk until the consistency seemed right.  

If I had to critique something, I'd say add a little more sugar.  But I do have a bit of a sweet tooth :)  Such a good find!  YUM

Great basic g/f pancake recipe. I will try playing with a flour blend next time instead of all rice flour, and when I doubled the batch I used 3 cups of rice milk instead of what would have been 4 cups water & the buttermilk powder. i made a bunch extra and froze them for a quick warm breakfast when we are running short on time, they taste just fine reheated in the toaster.

My kids declared these better than regular pancakes. I only made one substitution. I was out of potato starch so I used  instant potato beads. I just made sure I crushed them into a fine powder. I was worried  they would taste too much like potatoes, but they came out perfectly. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

These are awesome!I have been trying pancake recipes all afternoon.The last recipe went in the trash.Hard to do when these items cosy so much .I did not have potato starch so I substituted with arrowroot starch, used 2 tablespoons sugar instead of sugar substitute and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.I was making these for my son ,the rest of us don't need to eat gluten free.My spouse tried one said it didn't even need butter.I tried one ,hard not to eat them as they came of the griddle.Then my son came in fixed his plate,ate a few bites, smiled and said now that's pancakes.Have deleted all other pancake recipes.Any one have a recipe for a great GF white bread or hamburger buns?Thanks so much.

Thanks for the great gf recipe!  I really enjoyed these pancakes. I think the batter was a little thin.  Next time, I'll use less liquid (I used vinegar & milk instead of buttermilk). Besides that, they are great. Just a word of caution to those new to the gf lifestyle - gf will never taste the same as wheat so don't expect it to. But these are very good.

Fantastic and yummy! Didn't tell my picky-eater son they were gluten-free, and he gobbled them up without batting an eye. I used 1-1/2 cups almond milk instead of the dry buttermilk powder/2 cups of water. Also substituted 1/4 cup sugar for the 1 packet sugar substitute. Makes 'em a bit sweet...2 tablespoons of sugar might be plenty. Used cooking spray on the skillet. For 4 people, I doubled the recipe and had about 3 pancakes left at the end of brunch. These are simply scrumptious hotcakes--thanks for sharing the recipe!

substituted almond milk for water & buttermilk; coconut oil for canola oil.  Do remember to mix the coconut oil the second you measure it out.  Has a tendency to coagulate and it had slipped my mind!  These are delicious -- like other comments, I am thinking of serving these to my wheat eating hubby.  Halved the recipe - plenty for 2 people.

Pretty good but I cannot give it a Five since I had to change it to make it better.  

I agree with another reader who said leave the powder milk out.  Instead what I do is mix in some coconut milk for the liquid.  This gives it that extra creamy texture without the weight the powder milk seemed to give it.  

I also add some Watkins Vanilla Nut extract and some sugar. 
 MAKE IT RUNNIER THAN TRADITIONAL PANCAKE MIX AND LET SIT FOR A WHILE.  This will take care of any gritty texture that one can get with Gluten Free.  

I mix the dry ingredients in large batches and then just add the wet ingredients when I am making them but no longer really measure the dry as I go by texture.

These are really, really good! I used almond milk instead of buttermilk flour and water for dairy free and added until it reached proper consistency (probably 1.5 cups). I would add a little more sweetener or sugar for a sweeter pancake, but that's to taste. Thanks for a great recipe!

these pancakes are really really good! we've had a lot of gluten free baking failures and this is not one of them! we've made them 3 times now and my husband even likes them and usually he won't touch anything gluten free. i wish they were more healthful but at least they are yummy. only change we make is to use real sugar or syrup instead of sugar substitute.

Amazing Pancakes! My son and I had to give up our Saturday morning pancakes due to our intolerance to Gluten. With these pancakes I can tell you that you WILL tell the difference and honestly BETTER THEN ANY WHEAT BASED PANCAKE! Tastes fresh and beautiful to freeze for quick week day breakfasts!

Excellent!  Very similar to wheat pancakes.  I used everything as called for, except the sweetener which I omitted and guar gum instead of the xanthum.

There was no flavor to them, we had to add extra flour because the batter was too runny, and they did not raise up well.

I NEVER review recipes online, but these pancakes were incredible.  I am amazed!  I used 1.5 cups of Annalise Robert's brown rice flour mix, 1 T sugar instead of sugar substitute, and more like 1.5 cups of water (I like thicker pancakes).  WOW!!

Wow! These are the best pancakes! My nine year old put all the ingredients together and they were perfect!  I've added apples to them and also bananas another time.  It's amazing how well they turn out! Fluffy and so flavorful!

I submitted this recipe several years ago. Subsequently, with the aid of an iron supplement, I was able to go back to a normal diet. Recently, I tried the Gluten-free Pancake recipe again and found that much less water was required to obtain the proper consistency. Other reviewers have some interesting variations to this recipe, that I am going to try. Thanks for their comments.

Great gf pancake recipe! They taste and look like "regular" pancakes. Like so many other people, I didn't have buttermilk powder so I tried both the lemon+milk and vinegar+milk substitutes suggested by other reviewers. I recommend the vinegar sub - 2Tbs vinegar (Heinz distilled white vin is made from corn) and enough milk to equal 2 cups. The lemon juice made the pancakes flat and had a weird lemon aftertaste.

Tasted quite good but just a little mushy inside.  I used real buttermilk instead of powdered and water, maybe that's why. My son has ADHD and his diet calls for Omega-3 and more protien. I added a little flax seed for the Omega-3. Next time I am going to substitute some garbanzo flour to give higher protien. I used stevia as the sweetener and cut back on syrup (real maple, not high fructose corn).

I didn't have buttermilk powder so used skim milk powder. I also used corn starch in place of potato starch for the same reason. The pancakes came out thin like crepes but with a touch more body and were delicious. This is a great recipe and thank you for sharing it! The good thing about being thinner is they will cook evenly as long as your stove is level.

These were a surprize.  Really good.  Not just good for gluten-free.  
I did add a bit of lemon, cinnamon, and honey and used almond milk which 
I'd turned into a "buttermilk" by adding a bit of vinegar and lemon for 5 min.  
The kids and husband asked for more.

We love these gluten free pancakes!  I made them dollar size, they seem to cook better.   I used 2Tbsp of vinegar with 2 cups of milk rather than the buttermilk powder.  I also used 1Tbsp real sugar.

My 10 year old son gas been gluten free for over a year and my pancakes were especially hard for him to give up (my kids call me the pancake god). I have tried many recipes and all of the store bought mixes, but, they all just suck. This is amazing!! The only thing I changed was putting reg buttermilk because I couldn't find powdered. I also took the advice of another reviewer and went to the asian market and bought my rice flour...not gritty at all. My son about lost his mind because he can finally have yummy pancakes again

This was a great recipe to start with. Didn't have tapioca so just made it without. I used 2 Tbsp of real sugar, instead of a packet, as we can have that. I cut the oil to 1 Tbsp. 2 cups seemed like a lot of liquid, so I made 1 cup "buttermilk" by splashing about a Tbsp of vinegar in a measuring cup and filling it the rest of the way with milk. Sit for a minute or so, and is nearly indistinguishable from buttermilk. I mixed all dry ingredients and then added oil, beaten eggs, and buttermilk. I then began to mix, adding from a cup of water as needed. I only used approx 1/2 of a cup, for a total of 1 1/2 c of liguid besides oil and egg. Read the post about not getting done in the middle, so cooked it long and low on 2 on the stove (with blueberries) and just flipped once. Only me and my son are GF, and I didn't tell my hubby or daughter these were GF. They both thought we had lost our minds and were eating regular pancakes. The only comment was that they were a little more "spongey" than regular ones, but this was considered a good thing by all.

This recipe has the best flavor!!! I would certainly cut down on the amount of oil next time though. Way too much for my liking, but other than that it was great! I added cinnamon only because I can't seem to make pancakes without it!

This was the first gluten-free recipe I tried from scratch after my daughter was diagnosed with celiac disease.  Fantastic!  It was a real confidence booster for this overwhelmed mom, too.  At first, she also had to avoid dairy, so I used lactose free milk instead of the water and buttermilk powder.  

Now that she can handle a bit of dairy, I'm making the recipe with the buttermilk powder, but I'm boosting the nutritional value by substituting half of the white rice flour with brown rice flour.  Last time I made these I also threw in a tablespoon of flax meal as well.  Turned out great, and the whole family likes these better than the pancakes I made before I started cooking GF!

It is not utmost perfection, but it is the BEST gluten-free pancake recipe I have found to date. They were nice and fluffy, mostly cooked through quite well.
I did have to substitute cornstarch for the potato starch and I used milk with a splash of vinegar in lieu of water plus I didn't add the buttermilk powder (didn't have any). I used a little less liquid to compensate for that loss. I will be making these again for certain!

Best gluten free pancake recipe, ever! Good wheat taste approximation. I use actual sugar instead of sugar substitute, rice milk instead of buttermilk powder in a pinch and melted butter instead of vegetable oil (taste preference). None of these substitutes impact the overall flavor - great recipe!

these pancakes are simply wonderful! The inly change that I made was to use brown rice flour instead of white, and to use almond milk instead of water and buttermilk powder. My hubby didnt know the difference, which I dont get. These are better than the traditional. Each bite tasted like a bite of custard/ pancake....terrific! So good. I actually threw in a dash of cinnamon. I almost firgot. Hooray!

Awesome!  They were not flat and tasteless like some.The batter did not turn runny after sitting either. I used brown rice flour and substituted Bob's Red Mill flax seed meal for the eggs for extra nutrients!  Perfect recipe!

I completely agree with all the others that gave rave reviews for this recipe!! It is exactly what I hoped for! Christmas morning breakfast is always a 'special' breakfast and I was dreading it this year because of my gluten free attempt! These pancakes made a gluten free breakfast we all enjoyed together!

I will try again.  Maybe I will add more baking soda and /or powder.  Mine didn't look as beautiful as the ones in the picture, but they were not bad at all.
The batter was very runny (my husband likes that)
and the pancakes didn't rise like I was hoping.
Not bad though, especially if you have gluten intolerance.  
Oh, I didn't have buttermilk powder, so I made buttermilk with the milk by adding apple cider vinegar.

These pancakes are awesome!! Kids love them and beg for more. I did make a few alterations, I didn't have any potato starch so I just added an additional 1/3 cup of the tapioca starch. I used agave nectar in place of the sugar substitute, and I used coconut milk in place of the buttermilk. I added the milk as needed until it was the right consistancy. This one is a keeper!!

These pancakes were amazing!  I just went gluten-free six months ago, and it's been tough to bake gluten-free without my husband really enjoying what I make also.  He says there's a weird aftertaste usually with baked goods I make.  Well, it's not the case with these pancakes!  They taste just as good, if not better, than the real deal (he even said so!).  I used white rice flour, corn starch instead of the potato starch, and substituted 1 1/2 c. 1% milk and 2 Tb. vinegar for the buttermilk powder and water.  Topped with banana's and raspberries...muah!  Magnifique!  Already placed promptly in the front of my recipe box!

The buttermilk adds a great flavor to these pancakes. I add a tablespoon of cinnamon with splenda-sugar to the mixture before baking them. A dollop of unsweetened applesauce on top makes this a fantastic taste treat!

My one year old is on a gluten free diet so I tried these and absolutely loved them. My husband and I both felt they tasted very much like regular pancakes. Have used this recipe several time since then and always great results.

The best pancakes we've ever had.  Period.  My bf and I went gluten-free but couldn't afford all the ingredients to make these at first, and after a sad attempt at using a gluten-free mix, I made these and was amazed at how good they are!  The only thing I did differently is used 2c vanilla rice milk in place of the water and milk powder.  My new favorite recipe!!!

These are excellent!!  I can't believe I can finally enjoy a gluten free pancake that doesn't taste gluten free!  I was out of potato starch so used corn starch instead, and I did add about a 1/4 cup more tapioca flour to thicken up the batter a bit.  I used a teaspoon of regular sugar instead of the sweetener. so delicious!!

These are absolutely fantastic!  I have been trying several gluten free pancake recipes and alterations and they haven't turned out.  Thanks so much!
I didn't have potato starch so used corn starch and used soured soy milk to replace the water and butermilk powder!  So great!

I made these pancakes exactly as written but thought they were too thin and then, once cooked, the texture was strange albeit the taste wasn't bad. I then made a second batch using one cup of milk instead of two cups of water. I also left out the xantham gum in batch two. They were fantastic like this. After about 10 minutes, the batter thickened but the pancakes were still light and fluffy. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this 3 times, and the third time is the charm!  Way too much water and xantham gum in the recipe.  I cut the water to 1 cup ( plus a little once all mixed together based on consistency) and the xantham gum to less than 1/8 teaspoon.  Let the batter sit for 5-10 minutes before putting it in the pan (it will thicken a bit more) to let the ingredients mojinate.  The gumminess went away!  I also added cinnamon and vanilla because I always do, and used coconut oil instead of canola.  These are good if you make these tweaks!

Great! Even my picky kiddo & hubby liked them. I did make 2 substitutions. I didn't have potato starch & found I could sub corn starch instead (the only reason I see to use potato starch over corn starch would be if you had an allergy or reaction to corn products, but people with corn sensitivity also tend to be sensitive to xanthan gum and would need to use Gwar gum instead in this). I also didn't have buttermilk powder and we try to be dairy free so having almond milk on hand I subbed soured almond milk (1 2/3c almond milk + 1T + 1t vinegar + 1/2t lemon juice) for the powdered milk and water. Made perfect consistence & delicious results - as evidence but needing to make at least a double batch next time!

Good pancakes.  Not a ton of flavor but not a bad flavor, and good consistency.  Made even better by adding chocolate chips or spreading with Nutella.  = )  Not the nutritional content I would usually go for (I like higher protein and vitamins/minerals), but overall good for a weekend treat every once in a while.  Hubs says "One of the best pancake recipes ever!"  Son enjoyed the ones with chocolate, but didn't like the flavor of the plain.  Overall quick and easy and I would do again.

I had to add more than a full cup of flour on top of what was called for because it was so incredibly runny. I may try this recipe again but with far more caution.

these are fantastic!! I used about 1 TB sugar instead of sweetener, added a heaping tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice; if not using rice flour from Asian market let batter set at least 30 minutes and it wont be gritty. Love these! my new favorite pancake recipe!! :)

Pretty good! We used melted butter instead of oil, and 2 cups of buttermilk rather than powdered and water.

Really good basis for a recipe.  I found it a bit watery and thin with the recipe as described, so I modified it a bit.  Instead of 2c of water and buttermilk powder, I used 1 1/3 c of soured milk, and 2/3 c yogurt.  I also replaced some of the rice flour with millet flour (1-3 ratio).  I also added some vanilla.  Finally, I would NEVER use an artificial sweetener, so used a bit of sugar instead - about 1tsp.  This time they puffed up to the thickness of regular pancakes!  They were indistinguishable from my previous wheat-based recipe.

Loved these pancakes. They are so much better than GF mixes I have tried.  We are dairy free so I substituted dry goat milk for the buttermilk, and they still came out delicious.  Yes, they are a little softer or moister inside than a standard pancake, but I wouldn't say they were too mushy or anything.  Great taste and texture, I enjoyed eating one without butter or syrup or anything.   However they were better with my blend of maple syrup and fig preserves on top...yummmmy!

These were terrible.  The insides were mushy.  No matter how long they were cooked or at what temperature, even tried different griddles/skillets the inside remained mushy.

This is the second time making this recipe, I'm so glad I tried it again! The first time I made it, they were very flat, come to find out my baking powder was expired! Lesson learned, make sure your leavening is fresh! Aslo this time, I mixed and added the eggs and oil first, that way I could gage the milk (I used Lactaid instead of water) adding just the right amount, so the batter wasn't to watery. Ended up using only half the recommended. I can't wait to try this recipe using apple sauce instead of oil and I think I will try adding a bit of almond meal to the rice flour too!

Best i have tried! This one is a keeper for sure. After the 3rd one I cooked my daughter had a bite and was very impressed.  She asked if I could add 1 tablespoon flax seed, I said sure way not, and it was still good. We only added flax seed only b/c we know its good for you, not b/c it needed it.

Ok, I am NOT in favor of messing with recipes then rating them, AND I am breaking that when it comes to gluten, dairy, free, etc etc as everyone has their own tastes.  I loved this recipe.  It's the third pancake recipe I have tried.  I used the reviewer hint of Brown Rice in stead of White Rice flour, and a few other ideas as I have played with the favors of these flours.  I used 1/2c Brown rice Flour, 1/4 c Buckwheat Flour, 1/8c Sourghum Flour, and 1/8c Almond Flour.  In place of the buttermilk powder and water I used 2c hemp milk original flavor mixed with 2 TBS white vinegar.  I used soy free Earth Balance Buttery Spread in place of the oil, and I used 1 1/2 tbs pure maple syrup in place of the sugar substitute.   Mixed all dry ingrediets, melted butter just to make it liquidy, poued all wet ingredients into dry and mixed fairly well.  I did add a few blueberrys to the pancakes after they began to cook a bit... if you add blueberries, make sure you cook longer on side two or you will get doughy cakes!!  Thank you for a great recipe!!  My husband loved them!!!!

I'm new to gluten free. This recipe made an awesome base for the the substitutions I ended up making and in the end tasted exactly like reg. wheat pancakes! I wanted a more whole grain flavor so used brown rice flour instead of white rice. I had no buttermilk powd. so used 2 Tbs. vinegar and enough milk to bring up to 2 cups instead of water.  I don't use sugar substitutes so I used 1 1/2 Tbs. pure maple syrup for the sweetner and I love the taste of butter so used 3 Tbs. melted butter instead of oil. Everything else remained the same. It took a few pancakes to learn I had to turn the heat down quite a bit to cook the cakes more slowly so they'd be golden and not burnt. To the cook who found them mushy in the middle--the secret to a great pancake is to only turn them once and that is when they've bubbled and the "sheen" has gone off the entire surface. They'll be cooked every time! I hope you'll try them again. I can't wait to try them with 3/4 C. brown rice flour and 1/4 cup of GF buckwheat flour! BTW, I froze the leftovers separated with waxed paper and simply used the reheat button on the toaster. Excellent for a quick breakfast! I'm also going to try these as a "hamburger bun" substitute for a burger.

These pancakes were light and slightly fluffy, though not thick. The texture is a bit grainy as expected with rice flour, but not bad and the flavor was neutral, the substitutions/additions I made notwithstanding. I subbed coconut oil, agave syrup, and added a tsp of vanilla extract. Note that the recipe made about 30 'regular' sized cakes for me. I used a 1/4 c sized scoop and as the batter is quite thin, 1/2 the scoop full spread to make your typical size pancakes. The stated serving of 10 pancakes would be if you made them dinner plate size! It will be interesting to see how well the numerous leftovers freeze :-) Even the non-gluten-free partakers enjoyed them.

I thought these were quite good, though I don't think they would be easily confused with wheat pancakes.  They do not have a GF taste to them but are quite eggy, sort of like a cross between a crepe and a pancake.

I suspect, actually, that if the batter were thinned they'd make great crepes!

I made the recipe as listed.  Next time I will add blueberries to see if they camouflage the egg taste so that they come closer to being like regular pancakes.  The egg-i-ness wasn't a bad taste but wasn't really what I was expecting in a pancake.

Used Quinoa and buckwheat flour. Must have made about 20 pancakes. A bit runny as another reviewer said, but nice flat fluffy pancakes were the result. Thanks!

"We should eat gluten free all the time," was the comment from my 7-yr old when I served these for breakfast.  My 12 yr old said they were better than regular pancakes to eat plain.  I think that is testimony enough.

The only change I made was substituting 2 cups of milk for the water and buttermilk powder.  These were excellent.  None of my gluten-eating family could tell the difference.  They cooked better when I spread the batter thinly on the pan.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks so much!

I never review any recipe, but had to review this one.  I have 2 very picky kids who ate 2 large pancakes each after making this recipe.  The only change I made was to remove the salt and baking soda (as I didn't have baking soda on hand), and instead I added an extra 1 tsp of baking powder, other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  I should also state that I am a NOVICE cook, and found these easy, you just have to watch the pancakes carefully as they burn quickly :)

I would give this 5 stars,  but 2 cups of water is WAY too much. Every time my husband and I make this, we only need 1/2 cup of water. I also do tapioca starch in place of the potato starch because I never buy potato starch. So, I do 1/3 cup plus 3 Tablespoons tapioca flour/starch.  Otherwise, the flavor is great. I leave out the xanthan gum quite often too.

Can't say anything more than what's been said here--D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.This recipe compelled me to become a member of allrecipes so I could add to the review number. Used brown rice flour. Didn't have tapioca flour so used 1/2 c. potato. Used 1 T. Agave Syrup instead of sugar substitute. Used 2 T. of Flax Meal w/ 1 T. oil. Used 3/4 c. water + 3/4 c. Almond milk, which seemed to be enough liquid. Added huckleberries.   Can't wait to try again with the suggestion of cinnamon and apples!

These were really good and quite easy to make (as far as gluten free cooking goes!).  I used less liquid than called for.  and they still rose quite a bit as they cooked.  I froze half the batch and pop them in the microwave for 1 minute each for a quick breakfast.

sooo good, cant even tell they are gf. Here are the modifications i made as i didnt have the exact ingredients called for: i used Rogers GF flour blend to replace the rice, tapioca & potato flours (so 1 & 1/3 cup plus 3 TBSP), 1 TBSP raw sugar instead of the sugar substitute, 3 TBSP melted butter instead of oil, I used 2 cups buttermilk.

I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but these were the most odd GF pancakes I've ever made. Lots of ingredients, but I had to put the batter in a blender to get the lumps out, and then after cooking on the griddle, they just wouldn't fluff up.  they were very thin, and very mushy inside. I threw away the entire batch, because they were just inedible, unless you like to eat mush.  I've made a lot of GF pancakes, and none of them ever turned out like this.

Delicious and fluffy! I normally use King Arthur’s pancake mix, but it’s expensive even if it’s bought on a military base. This recipe is a life and money saver. Now I don’t have to settle for gluten pancakes and deal with swelling. Like another reviewer, I used almond milk. Though I only needed 1 1/4 cups. I also used Bob’s Red milk 1 to 1 gf flour since it already has the tapioca starch and xanthum gum.

Turned out really well! Here are some very minor adjustments i made: 
I used Mochiko sweet rice flour as it is ground extra fine and has higher binding ability than regular rice flour. To make it completly dairy free I put 2 tablespoons vinegar in a measuring cup and filled with almond milk till 2cups.  I used Xylitol instead of artificial Sweetners.  I used 1/4 less liquid as i thought the batter was becoming too thin and most importantly: I let the batter rest for about 15-30 minutes for the Xanthan gum to activate and thus thicken the mix. Came out perfect and light.

It is a fluffy pancake! I didn't think this would be possible. Most gluten-free recipes don't turn out. Anyway, I didn't use buttermilk powder, instead I used 1 1/4 cup of almond milk and about 1/2-3/4 cup of water. I kept adding water to thin it out to my liking. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I do feel like it needs even more flavor however, so maybe another TB of sugar next time and more vanilla extract. Overall, happy with this recipe and would make it again with the modifications above.

I usually use the bisquick gluten free pancake mix. It is really good and I haven't found a better scratch recipe. One morning I went to make pancakes for my wife and nephew and had run out. So I looked up some recipes and found this one. It seemed to have really good reviews and there were comments that it had a very similar taste and texture to regular pancakes. I didn't believe it, but, had to try to find out for myself.

To my surprise, the pancakes did get thick and fluffy like regular pancakes. They have a really nice texture, something that can be challenging when making gluten free. Everyone loved them. I do a lot of gluten free cooking/baking so I am very critical, but, this recipe is the real deal. 

Usually I just make pancakes for my wife. This recipe makes over 4 cups of batter, so, it is quite large for someone who just wants to make a few. Next time I will half the recipe. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Move over Bisquick, you've been replaced!

This is a great base recipe that easily adapts to modifications. I use soy milk instead of the buttermilk powder and water and egg substitute instead of the eggs. I have also made it with fruit, protein powder and chia seeds and they still turned out fluffy and flavorful.

These were wonderful.  My son said they were the fluffiest pancakes he's ever had.  I substituted 1 Tbsp coconut palm sugar for the sugar substitute, arrowroot starch for potato starch, and 1 1/4 cups of almond milk for the buttermilk and 2 cups water.

Delicious! We only had regular dry milk powder, so that's what we used and we used white rice flour, not brown rice flour, but these are the best pancakes I've ever eaten...even before I became gluten-intolerant. My husband, who is not gluten-intolerant says he loved them so much he will make them all the time. Love!

Waste of time and ingredients...batter turns out like cookie dough without adding a cup or more of water. Also, cooks up terribly. 1 star is a stretch for this recipe.

To convert recipe to low fat and GF: delete dehydrated milk. eggs, canola oil and water. Use 1 1/3 cups of almond milk instead of the water and dehydrated milk, 2 T of ground flaxseed instead of the eggs, 3 T of unflavored applesauce instead of the canola oil. I use coconut oil to cook the pancakes and it adds a subtle nutty aroma. This is the absolute best recipe that I go to in over 250 favorites on Allrecipes. You will not be disappointed!!

The end result was the best gluten free pancakes I've made to date!  My husband was surprised!  My modifications:  ditched the water for milk (probably a key change), used 2 T Evap.Cane Sugar instead of a substitute,  omitted the buttermilk powder, added 2 T coconut flour just because, used olive oil in the mix and coconut oil to cook.

My adult son who is sensitive to gluten, cow milk, soy & cane sugar said, "These taste like real food!" A huge relief after the many failed recipes we've tried! I had powdered goats milk so used that instead of the buttermilk so also added a tablespoon of white vinegar (the recommended substitute for buttermilk). 2 cups of water is way to much. Just add as much as you need for the right consistency. We will definitely be making these again!

I didn't have sugar substitute so I used 1/4 c sugar. I only had potato flour (not potato starch) and milk powder. They turned out fine. They were still fluffy, I imagine they would have been fluffier if I had the proper ingredients.

Tastes as good or better than regular pancakes from Fannie Farmer. You would never know this is gluten free. Batter is a bit thicker but results are perfect. Highly recommend for gluten free folks! Bravo

Amazing!! These taste just like the real deal. My first attempt at pancakes so I didn't know what to expect.  I always make regular pancakes for the rest of my family and so I haven't been able to eat them. I was so excited to have pancakes again!! I made them with chocolate chips and my kids didn't even know the difference! I didn't have tapioca flour so I used soy flour instead. Also, I used organic milk instead of water and buttermilk powder.  Can't wait to make them again!!

I have tried too many gf pancake recipes to count, and these are by far the best!  I doubled it but otherwise didn't change a thing and they came out almost exactly like our favorite recipe using wheat flour.  Seven people eating them said this recipe is a definite keeper.

This is an awesome, if not the best recipe I've tried thus far for gluten-free pancakes. Both my 6 year old son and husband didn't even know they were gluten-free. I did make a few changes: used coconut oil instead of canola, turbinado sugar instead of sugar substitute, 1 and 1/2 cups of non-fat, organic milk instead of 2 cups of water and added 1 tsp of organic, gluten-free vanilla extract. SO GOOD!!!

Too thin and tasteless. I added approx. 1/2 cup oat flour, 2 TB potato starch, 1 TB vanilla and a another pinch of xanthan gum and baking power with agave instead of the sugar substitute packet and they ended up REALLY good. We even added bacon to a few:)

We have been trying gluten-free recipes for about 2 years. This is the FIRST one that REALLY tastes like pancakes. In fact, my teenage son said he liked them better than the other (regular) pancakes! I did make a few changes, real cane sugar for the sugar substitute, coconut oil for the canola and I used soured milk instead of the water and buttermilk powder. Oh, yes and I was out of potato starch and used oat flour instead. I think next time I may try the almond flour that someone else mentioned. Great recipe, that I WILL be SHARING!

This tasted good as gluten free pancakes go, but the batter is way too thin to get fluffy pancakes, tried it with muffin proportions of wet to dry, (1 1/4 cups of milk, also left out the xanthan gum), added 1 tsp of vanilla,turned out pretty good, a little heavy. Looks like regular pancakes too.

This was delicious, although I made a couple of changes.  I substituted extra virgin coconut oil for the canola oil.  I used low fat regular buttermilk instead of buttermilk powder and water. I added some almond paste (byproduct from making some almond milk).

I changed a few things to suit my ingredients on hand. I didn't have all of the flours so I just used Bob's Red Mill pre mixed all purpose gluten free flour instead with the same measurement as if you mixed all of them in the recipe above. I also didn't have powdered buttermilk so I skipped water and substituted the same volume of water for a mix of 1 part milk to 2 parts cream and 2 tsps of white vinegar. I also subbed out the canola oil for cinnamon apple sauce and added extra cinnamon. These take longer to cook than wheat flour ones, keep that in mind. My dad didn't notice and really liked them and when I told him they were GF he said, "what is this,  witch craft?" Ha ha they were a win in my house.

I love these. These are by far the best gf pancakes! I make them every other day, even my kids love them. I do make a few changes... I added abut a teaspoon more soda to make them a bit fluffier. I also add one cup of real buttermilk and one cup water....or just until it's the thickness I like, if you add all the liquid then you will have a thinner pancake. I like them more fluffy. I also add a few tablespoons of flax seed and it adds a real hearty flavor. You can mix it up and add blueberries or bananas too. I love them!

These are my family's favorite pancakes by far. We don't need to do gluten free anymore for my daughter but these are still the top requested breakfast item.

Edible, slightly weird texture, nothing to write home about but better than no pancales at all.

I loved this recipe!!!  I gave it my own little touch by adding honey instead of the sugar substitue and almond milk instead of the dry buttermilk.  Even my husband approved.
