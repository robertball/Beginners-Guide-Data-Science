My husband and I are not big fans of beets but we had 3 delivered in our produce box. We didn't want to throw them out so I found your recipe made some changes (used sharp Cheddar instead of Gruyere) 4 cloves of garlic salt instead of garlic salt baked and had a super yummy meal! I put the extra filling on slices of French bread and baked for 10 minutes and those were delicious too. Thanks for the recipe.

My beets took a very long time to cook and were never soft enough to scoop out the middle. I diced them and made the recipe into a casserole. It was pretty good and I used low fat sour cream and low salt turkey bacon instead. Good flavors but would have been equally good if not better on potatoes.

I was very disappointed by the sharp bitter taste of the filling. It didn't blend well with the sweetness of the beats. Sadly.

This was really good. My husband and I love beets but we rarely eat them any way but boiled and on a salad. I used sharp cheddar since I couldn't find gruyere.

Soooo good!!! I substituted Canadian cheddar cheese for the Gruyere and sprinkled the Parm on top before baking. These do take a while when you include the time to boil the beets (took about 40 minutes to boil them-maybe I used bigger beets than Brent?) but well worth it!

I was preparing stew & these stuffed beets for dinner. It took me almost the full two hours the stew was simmering to prepare the stuffed beets. I followed it precisely to the recipe. They were tasty but didn't capture my attention. I felt like it needed a stronger flavor inside and some crusted cheese (parmesan?) on top.

This recipe was just ok. I used a package of shredded cheese that was a Mexican mixture and sharp cheddar cheese. The beets take much longer to boil than the recipe says....more like an hour. It was incredibly difficult to gut the inside of the beet. If I were to try this again I would simply chop up the beets mix it all together and make a baked dish out of it.
