Just a quick tip on how to brine a turkey, especially when your fridge is full of other holiday goodies! Ive done it this way for a few years now, and it works great.  Instead of soaking in the stock pot overnight, I put the turkey & brine mixture in a oven bag, squeeze out the air, and tie it shut.  Put the bagged turkey in a cooler with ice overnight.

This really does make the juiciest turkey.  Cooks Illustrated magazine recommends letting the turkey sit in the refrigerator for several hours uncovered after rinsing off the brine, so that the skin will brown and crisp up.

I loved this recipe when I made it last year for Christmas, but I have a question...when I turned the bird 2/3 through cooking it fell apart.  Does anyone know why?  Did I cook it too long?

fantastic!!!  i will never make a turkey another way again!!!  The veggies were awesome!  
I was so nervous to flip the turkey cause I was by myself!!, but I have a tip...take 2 pot holders and put them in freezer ziplock bags.  put your hands in the bags, grab the bird and flip!!!  it was sooooooo easy...i didn't even burn myself...lol!!!

This is outrageous.  My husband was a serious skeptic of the brining process... until carving time came.  I'm amazed the bird made it to the table!  Absolutely amazing.  *Definitely* use more vegetables.  Especially carrots.  I added a smidge of wine to the gravy I made from the drippings and it set it off perfectly.  Definitely the best gravy we've ever had -- which we didn't even need with such a moist, delicious turkey!  Thank you!

I have used this recipe for 3 years...it always comes out succulent. Even the leftovers are moist days later. I double up oven baking bags to brine overnight in the fridge. (I don't use the oven bags to cook in though.) The meat isn't salty, so don't be afraid to use the full amount of kosher salt. I do flip the bird breast up at the end like the recipe calls for. I follow the recipe with a few tweaks...I add lots of fresh sage inside the cavity (thyme is good but sage smells and tastes like Thanksgiving to me) & sprinkle a little no-salt poultry seasoning on the outside. If I have some fresh yams & apples, I'll chunk up a couple inside the bird too with the other veggies. Be sure to use a good wine that you'd drink. The gravy is to die for. I pureed some of the carrots, onions & celery separately (use a hand blender if you have one or make sure the veggies aren't hot if you use the blender....no apple or yams in the gravy puree) to add to the gravy drippings to taste. I use a grease separator for the drippings and make a roux out of a little of the fat from the top off the drippings to start of the gravy. Resting before you carve is really, really important. The juices go back into the meat. Make your gravy and bake your rolls while it's resting. That way you aren't tempted to carve too soon.  The carcass, leftover veggies & drippings go straight into the pot for day-after Turkey Barley soup that my has become as much of a family tradition as the turkey dinner.

Had to downsize recipe since I only had a 12lb turkey. This is the only way I will do turkey from now on. I changed it slightly by stuffing the turky with chopped apples instead of the veggies and put all the veggies in the pan. Also added double the amount of white wine.

I highly recommend this turkey recipe!  Made it for Thanksgiving and it's the best one and the easiest that I've used.  The brining makes the turkey superbly moist and flavourful.  I used aluminium foil to cover it for 2/3 of the cooking time.  The vegetables outside the turkey were too oily for my family's taste, and the stuffed vegetables were still very crunchy.  I will boil the stuffed vegetables first next time.

This was the moistest turkey I have ever had in my entire life. It was gone as fast as lighting. I did not have the wine on hand so I substituted it out with chicken broth. It was great, so favorful and juicy. Great recipe!!!

I was so excited to try this recipe but unfortunately I had already bought a Butterball turkey. Butterball turkeys are already brined which I never realized before. I saw on the label that it is infused with a 7% salt solution so I googled it and found out you should never brine a Butterball because it will come out too salty (which I'm guessing is the reason a few users said this recipe was too salty). So when buying a turkey for this recipe make sure it is not already brined. I will try this recipe with a different brand another time:)

I was pretty brave this year! After reading the reviews for the turkey, I decieded to make the turkey. Thanksgiving was at my sister in law's house, which created a problem. Without my wifes permission I asked my sister in law if I could make the turkey. So as I'm preparing the turkey and bring it over to her house I decieded to tell her, "I've never made a turkey before". She was really supportive and when the turkey was on its breast that through them for a loop. 
Ofcourse the whole party was focused on this turkey. It better not be dry was the overall response. I'm not going to lie, I was so nervous. Flipping over the turkey was pretty tough since it was 24lbs, next time I'll use a lower roasting pan to help with the flipping. 
After 5hrs 15mins the turkey was finished. Let's just say by the end of the night my new nickname was "TURKEY BOY" I've never tasted turkey so moist, even the white meat dripped of juices!! I soaked it in Celtic Sea Salt for about 16hrs and followed the veggies & added about 2 1/2 cups of white wine! Thanks for this outstanding recipe. This was my first turkey and I'll stay with this recipe for life. Thanks for making me a hero!!!

Excellent recipe the first time I made it and here's what I did to change it up for Christmas.

 I brined it overnight in a cooler in 8 gallons of ice cold water to 8 cups of kosher salt and 6 cups of loosely packed dark brown sugar. After taking it out of the brine mix I thoroughly rinsed it. I then put the turkey in a bowl in the fridge to rest for 3 hours then discarded more of the brine. Set oven at 400 degrees. Paper towelled the brined turkey dry, put unsalted butter under the skin of the breast with 1 large bay leaf under skin of each breast. I then rubbed a mixture of roasted garlic, unsalted butter, and sage all over the turkey. I put the turkey on a bed of carrots, celery, and onion, breast side down, then added 1/4 cup water. Turkey roasted uncovered for 1 hour at 400 degrees fahrenheit, without opening oven door turned it down to 300 degrees fahrenheit. Roasted at 300 degrees fahrenheit for an hour. Opened the door to baste the turkey. Roasted another hour at 300 and basted again. Covered turkey with foil. Roasted another 15 - 30 minutes. Uncovered turkey, basted it and probed with thermometer, removed when it reached 180 degrees fahrenheit. 

Discarded the veggies! Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes covered with foil. All in all roasted 3 1/2 hours. Best turkey I have ever had! Moist, flavourful and delicious yes even the breast.  NOTES: don't use chicken broth or salted butter on a brined turkey or your gravy/turkey will be salty.

The Thanksgiving meal this year promised to be difficult due to my diagnosis of fibromyalgia.  I had to plan a meal that I could starting preparing several days ahead and only work on it a short time each day.  This turkey recipe allowed me to do that, and was totally delicious and juicy, even though cooked and sliced the day before Thanksgiving and reheated.  I also found these other recipes that I prepared and then refrigerated to await Tday baking:  Day Before Mashed Potatoes, Sweet Potato Casserole II, Thanksgiving Cheese Ball, Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake.  In using the Shopping List feature, it allowed my sometimes foggy brain to be very organized.  Thank you, AllRecipes, for all the help in overcoming my disability to continue a meaningful family tradition!

I've brined my turkey for more than 10 years now.  There a guaranty that your turkey will be moist & juicy when brining.  I add much more flavor to my brine however and it makes a huge difference.  I also add some unsalted butter (you should ALWAYS use unsalted butter with any meat you have brined!!) into the cavity along with the veggies.  Also fill the neck cavity with same.   I've never started out the bird breast side down, either.  Really no need with a brined bird.  Plus, you risk having it fall apart like a reviewer said, when turning it over and it certainly will not look as picture perfect as when roasted breast side up the whole time.  Trust me, a brined turkey will be wonderfully moist.  If you use any sugar in your brine or apple juice (as I do) keep the turkey covered the entire roasting time so that the skin does not brown too quickly!   I also have several comments in the Brining Article that offer some great tips & suggestions.  Happy Turkey!!  Aunt Tilly

I bought a small turkey to try this recipe because I didn't want to serve something that wasn't perfect on Thanksgiving day and boy am I glad I did!!

Yes this turkey was moist, but the flavor and moistness was exactly the same as when you use a turkey oven bag.  And I COULDN'T stuff it with this recipe.  I'm sticking with what works.

I will never cook another turkey without the brine first!  This is the first time I have used the brining method and it was delicious.  Every part was tender and juicy.  The turkey was for my husband's military function and it was the first thing to go. The other turkey there was hardly touched.  I didn't have thyme however I got a tip from Alton Brown about the veggies you cook in the bird.  Chop the onion, celery and carrots, then microwave them in a dish with shallow water for 3-4 min.  This gets the cooking started for the veggies and helps to infuse the flavors faster.  I also sprinkled garlic powder and pepper on the outside before cooking.

Oh My Goodness!!  I made this at Thanksgiving - TO DIE FOR!!! My family raved about it!  I took pictures - which looks like something off of a Butterball commercial or something!!!  I will post them at a later date!!!  Definitely Brine the bird overnight - since I didn't have the fridge space I placed the bird in a large cooler, topped with water and added lots of ice to keep it cold.  Use a plate to weigh the bird down under the water.
I used cooking wine instead of regular table wine.  Definitely use more veggies.  Whatever you do, don't put stuffing in the bird - gets VERY soggy!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with the world!!!  ;))

I also scattered all the veggies around the turkey in the pan, stuffed it and  stuck an  apple in at the neck. My method is, when the apple is done, so is the turkey. (It works). This is the only recipe I will use from now on. We were in heaven last year, and plan to be there again this year! The turkey was incredibly moist from the brining, and the gravy     was to die for. My husband ate all the carrots, but I did puree some of the onion into it.  Thank you so much for this recipe, Shelly!

The reviews dont lie! This is the BEST turkey!  This was our first turkey and I wont lie, we were a little nervous.  My husband was unsure about turning it half way through and we were worried about the saltiness.  No need to worry! Just follow the instructions! For those who said it was too salty, we did end up using only about half the kosher salt for an 18lb turkey.  But you HAVE to rinse the turkey REALLY well before cooking.  We stuffed it with stuffing instead of the veggies and just used all the veggies in the pan.  The stuffing turned out amazing!  Other then those few changes, we followed the instructions to a T and it was wonderful!  There was Lots of juices at the bottom for gravy, the veggies were delicious and the turkey was out of this world!  Just like other reviewers said, I had people who dont even usually like turkey who absolutely loved it.  My Nana even went as far to say it was the best meal she ever had.  For flipping it over, we had the legs held under the skin to prevent it for all falling apart.  Then my husband used oven mits covered in plastic bags to flip it. Sounds silly, but it worked perfectly.   Perfectly browned skin all the way around.  This is our turkey recipe for life!  And I think we'll be making lots of it since, as of last night, we have been named the official turkey cookers from now on!

Have made this the last two thanksgivings.  Best turkey recipe I've ever tried.  The keys are the soaking in brine overnight...(gets out all the blood which dries out the turkey), and cooking it top-side down (makes the juices run to the white meat and the dark meat always stays moist)

Wonderful.  Wouldn't change a thing

This is by far the best and only turkey I cook for Thanksgiving. I use a large ziplock bag for brining and throw it in a cooler with a couple of bags of ice. I don't have the space in the fridge. I use Kosher salt, white sugar, a whole garlic bulb with the top cut off, fresh rosemary/thyme, and 12 or so whole peppercorns for the brine. In the morning rinse it, dry it and season inside and out. I stuff the cavity with 1/2 a grannysmith apple, 2 carrots, 1/2 an onion, 2 stalks of celery cut in half and in a cheesecloth I put peppercorns, 4 cloves of garlic and fresh rosemary and thyme. I add a bit more white wine with the vegetables in the pan. I roast according to the directions. The gravy is so flavorful and the turkey is so delicious and moist. I will never cook a turkey any other way.

I am cooking Thanksgiving for the first time this year and have decided to use this recipe.  My family is adament on stuffing being cooked inside the turkey.  Is this a good idea for a brined turkey or will it change the juiciness and/or flavor?  Has anyone tried this recipe with stuffing cooked inside the bird?

This is "THE PERFECT TURKEY!"  I made my first Thanksgiving dinner for my inlaws and they are still calling me to tell me what a delicious turkey I made! It was such a big hit, my mother in law is planning to use this recipe next year for the holidays! Do not skip the brine, and we left the vegetables in the gravy. SOOOOOOO GOOOOD, I think we will be eating a lot of turkey this year!!!!

I've been cooking turkey like this for years with a few variations.  I make my brine with 1 c salt, 1c sugar, 1/2 c  pepper corns, rosemary, and tyme, put it in a stock pot cover with water and when dissolved put the turkey in it and cover wit water. After taking out of the brine and a quick rinse off, pat it dry and use olive oil.  I stuff lots of carrots, onions and celery in the body with tyme and rosemary, sew closed, stuf 1/2 onion and carrots in the neck and truss the bird.  That way when you turn it over to get the skin brown, it doesn't fall apart.

OMG!!!  Roasting a turkey breast side down is a little difficult to do, I turned mine right side up to brown the breast skin a little at the very end of the cooking time.  It was a two person job to turn it, BUT we have never had such moist, flavorful breast meat.  I will never roast a turkey any other way!  I did stuff it with all kinds of veggies, celery, onions, apples, butter, and salt, and parsley.  SO GOOD, TRY IT!

This is fantastic! I made Thanksgiving dinner from a similar recipe last year and my Grandma (the family chef) came over and was so impressed that I knew to brine the turkey. She recommended that I also add sugar to the water. I may try that this time.

Someone asked what to do if their turkey is bigger than any of their pots. I used a garbage bag since my turkey was so big (well, two bags so nothing would leak out) then set the bag in my roasting pan in the fridge to keep it from rolling around.

I have been making turkey this way for a few years now.  The only thing I do different is I place the turkey breast side up and cover with a piece of cheese cloth soaked in the brine and when the turkey is 2/3 done, I take off the cheese cloth.  My turkey is always too big as we cook a big one every year to turn half way through the cooking process.  Moist and juicey turkey every time

I made this for Thanksgiving and I'm a little sad to say it was drier than any turkey I have ever made before.  I brined it, which was the first time ever doing that, and was a little disappointed it wasn't more juicy...which is what I've heard the brining does for the turkey.  Regardless, the flavor the thyme and veggies gives the gravy was AMAZING!!  It truly made the best gravy I have ever had!!  All in all, a good recipe.  Thanks!

If I couldgive this recipe more stars I would!!  My husband never wants turkey because he thinks that it is always dried out.  So....when I saw this recipe with the brining method I thought why not give it a try.  Well...  all my company and my husband whole heartedly agreed that this was the moistest[is that a word] turkey they had ever had and with the most flavour.  I will never change turkey recipes.  I did stuff this with the stuffing recipe from classic stuffed turkey.  It was just the final touch to this great turkey dinner!! Thank you thank you!! ps- after making this turkey now too many times to count, I can honestly say that all my friends and family are now using this recipe and agree that there is NO OTHER turkey recipe for them as well!

I had my in-laws and parents over for Thanksgiving! What a great recipe! I also stuffed turkey with 2 chopped granny smith apples and used fresh herbs such as sage and rosemary  (made a big difference).  Make sure you rinse of brine well after soaking for 12 hrs, and definitely leave in fridge for at least 2-3 hours before roasting. I placed turkey on a rack and like the recipe states, turn over 2/3 of the way during roasting. I used two big bbq forks to turn over the turkey, and it was not difficult. Basting turkey with melted butter browned the turkey and this is reason you need to turn over, and baste rest of turkey. I will use this recipe again for Christmas dinner.

The only way to do a turkey. The Thanksgiving turkey has become my husband's baby and he always boils the brining mixture first, to dissolve the salt and bring out the flavors. After it cools, we put it in a large plastic trash bag with the turkey overnight in the fridge (or outside in a cooler if it's very cold!). He adds apples to the vegetables inside the turkey. Num, num!

This recipe was so easy. It was also very, very good. The only thing I would change is to put more carrots around the turkey because they turned out so great we didn't have near enough to go around because everybody wanted more of them! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. A keeper.

I made this turkey for my son's preschool Thanksgiving Feast... it was great!! I added a lot of extra carrots to the pan and the veggies were amazing! I also made a butter/flour roux based gravy from the drippings. I will definitely use this recipe again!  ***Regarding flipping a hot turkey*** I took my square pot holders and sealed them in Ziploc bags then used them to turn the turkey over. Kept my hands from burning and kept my pot holders clean. Worked great!!

This is great, but do know that the brine does get inside the turkey and for people having to watch their salt intact that must be considered. There was a really good article about brining that I read recently, and it, too, stated that the salt from the brine can be a problem for those with high blood pressure who must watch their salt intact.

This is an absolute perfect recipe.  My entire family devoured this turkey and it was the most moist turkey that any of us have ever had.  I did do a few extras, first I rubbed the bird with sage and salt and let it soak overnight in Ice water in a 5 gal. bucket with a plate to weigh it down, then I flipped to bird over during the night.  I didn't stuff the inside with the veggies, instead I used an apple, 2 sitcks of fresh cinnamon, a whole onion, fresh rosemary sprigs, the bay leaf and a small amount of thyme.  I left all of the veggies for the bottem of the pan with the wine and they turned out perfect.  I will never make a turkey another way!!!!!!!!

I am a newly married, young mom and this was the first time ever that I made a turkey.  I made brought it over to my mother's for Easter and it was a huge hit.  The turkey was so moist.  I used more veggies like suggested.  The veggies inside the turkey weren't as good as the veggies on the outside.  They were more crunchy, but still good.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

made this for x mas dinner. i cooked a 23 pound turkey and eye balled all of the ingredients. turned out to be the absolute best. however, it was done cooking in 3 hours! i fliped it as directed but 1/2 way through the cooking because it looked done on the one side. when i flipped it the little thermometer it came with had popped up! so i took it out of the oven and covered it with the roaster lid and let it sit for almost 2 hours until my guests arrived. my mom was amazed at the color of the turkey and when she went to carve it, it was falling off of the bone! they had to pull it apart with their hands! so so so so so juicy! let the bird sit as long as you can before carving!

I was scared silly when it was decided that Thanksgiving was to be at my house, and I had NEVER cooked a turkey before!  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Many people tried to talk me out of trying a brine on my first attempt at cooking a turkey, but I ignored the nay-sayers!  I'm so glad I didn't listen to them! My husband (who usually is afraid to try my cooking!!) said it was the best turkey he had ever tasted!!  The meat was moist and juicy, and the drippings made the most delicious gravy! I followed the recipe exactly, but I left out the celery. (hey ~ I'm not a cook!! I don't keep celery in the house!) Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!  I have been asked to do the turkey every year from now on!

I cooked this for my sister-in-laws Thanksgiving dinner when she was ill and had committed to cooking for 12.  I used a 19.5 lb Butterball turkey that she had already purchased and thawed.   Rubbed the turkey inside and out with the kosher salt, placed in a cooler and covered with water the night before.  The next day I rinsed the turkey and patted it dry, made about 1/2 cup of garlic butter and shoved it between the skin and meat of the the breast sections and smeared it on the outside of the turkey as well.  Placed it in an open roasting pan and put it in a 450 oven for 15 minutes to brown, then turned down to 350, placing foil over the breast sections and wing tips only. After a couple of hrs I turned it down to 325. I placed the turkey in the pan breast side up and did not baste at all.  It was done in about 4.5-5 hours and was sooooo moist and juicy and flavorful.  I removed most of the juices from the bottom of the pan (there was about 4 cups, plenty for the gravy) then covered the turkey and pan with foil and let it rest while I finished up other dishes in the oven and made the gravy (about 45 min) before carving.  This made very good gravy, it was not too salty at all, just do not add salt, only pepper when making.  The guests could not quit raving about how moist and flavorful the turkey was and how good the gravy was.  I will definitely make this way again and again.  It definitely was....the perfect turkey

LOOK NO FURTHER! Oh my goodness, this was a very juicy turkey! I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I used chicken broth instead of white wine. I didn't have a bucket big enough for my turkey to brine overnight so I stuck my prepared kosher salt turkey, put it in a heavy duty garbage bag, filled it with water, double bagged it, and stuck it in my crisper drawer in the fridge. Also, I did what previous users did to turn the turkey - two pot handles - worked perfectly. I loved not having to baste it! This was fantastic, I will never make turkey any different for the rest of my life! Thank you so much for sharing!

Don't believe the 1 star rating.  Been doing it this way for years and it make the most succulent turkey you can imagine, and with plenty of drippings.  Flip the turkey over using two clean dish towels for the final 45 min. for the perfect brown.

I've often wondered why it is a rare thing to see a recipe for roasting a whole turkey breast down. Since the breast tends to dry out, This makes sense to me. Also my personal recipe adds eaual amounts of salt and  sugar to the brine. I think it is one cup of each.I don't know if this makes it juicier, but mine sure was juicy.

I was nervous to brine since my Butterball already had a 4% water/salt/spices solution, so I cut the salt down to 1 cup and brined for 12 hours, then let the bird sit uncovered in the fridge for a few hours after rinsing and patting dry. I added more veggies to both cavity and roasting pan (esp. carrots), doubled the thyme and upped the wine to 1 1/2 cups. I accidentally put the turkey in the oven breast side up and didn't catch that error until about 45 minutes in. At that point I turned it upside down for a couple of hours and then turned it breast side up again for the final 45 minutes or so. The color was glorious on both sides. The turkey was delish but it wasn't quite as juicy as I'd expected based on other reviews, so when I make this again at Christmas I'll use the full 2 cups kosher salt and make sure the turkey goes in the oven upside down from the start. A great recipe despite my bumbling. The gravy was incredible! Thickened it with a cornstarch and water mixture after trying to get most of the floating oil off with a spoon. The pan veggies were too salty for my taste but others liked them; we served them as a side dish. Next time I'll add some potato chunks to the roasting pan to suck up some of the salt and then I'll discard the potatoes before pureeing some of the veggies to add to the gravy. This recipe is practically fool-proof; I made plenty of mistakes and it was still terrific.

Seldom mentioned is the brand.  Butterball is pre tenderized and flavored.  It is also much more expensive.  I buy the cheapest turkey on sale and inject the breast with my favorite flavors and brine. Then brine the whole bird in a 5 gallon bucket over night.  To cook it and be moist I always cook slow and low in a bag.  200 to 250 degrees for no less than 8 hours on a 22 pound turkey.  For certain use a bag to keep the moisture in.  This is a no fail inexpensive turkey.  Dave

Excellent! This turkey turned out absolutely amazing. The meat was incredibly juicy. I added a quartered apple to the cavity and mixed garlic, dried thyme, and onion powder in with the butter before spreading it all over and underneath the skin. The meat had amazing flavor. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks :)

What a great tasting bird! Moist and flavorful! The skin was a little pale though. After talking to a chef friend of mine he suggested leaving it uncovered in the fridge overnight after rinsing to help brown the skin, same comment was added by cookin_mama. I can't wait try this deep fried!

Odds and ends. For Gracibabi; it's been a long time but re the veggies inside and out. They're their for flavor; inside the turkey to infuse the meat, and in the pan to flavor the pan juices. Toss them, they've done their job. For Pikapfatchance; rinse and dry the turkey well, then stuff. Adjust cooking time for a stuffed turkey. For Ambo; did you use table salt instead of kosher salt? Table salt is more salty than Kosher salt. About 2 times. You can use it but you'll need to adjust the amounts. To make it even more interesting, different brands of Kosher salt have different size salt crystals and will also require different amounts. Cooks Illustrated has very good info on brining and salt amounts. They also have a great recipe for a butterflied turkey where they use the cut out backbone to make  gravy ahead of time. I've used turkey parts, ie necks and wings instead and it works out great. I've made my gravy stock a week ahead. Just freeze it and thicken the day of along with the pan juices.

This was, without a doubt, the best turkey we have ever eaten!  I was going to make it ahead and freeze it, but my family wouldn't let me.  They ate it as fast as I cut it off!  I would definitely use more carrots.  Also, I bought fresh sage, rosemary and thyme and cut the skin loose from the meat and placed the herbs under the skin as well as in the cavity of the bird.  The flavor was incredible!

This recipe was great.  I have never had a turkey stuffed with anything other than the traditional bread stuffing.  The vegetables were really good but because they were sitting in the turkey pan, they were a little oily for my taste.  The meat was so juicy.  TO the brine mixture, we added an orange peel, peppercorns, bay leaves and a few spices.

This is definitely a five-star recipe. Very easy to make and absolutely the best turkey I've ever tasted-worth trying!!! It's even worth giving up the stuffing and the vegetables are delicious! We double the veggies so there's enough for a side dish. To cut down on the greasiness of the vegetables when using as a side dish, we also boil some plain veggies to mix together with the baked ones, still plenty of flavor but not as greasy. Also, when removing the veggies from the roasting pan we put them in a strainer over a pot to get most of the drippings out. We then use all the pan drippings mixed with a little flour and water to make a fabulous gravy!

The name says it all! This turkey is fantastic! The moistest turkey I've ever had! I was nervous about turning the turkey over during the cooking process, but I think that is the genius part of this recipe because all the fat dripping off the dark meat lands on the white meat. Yum! Loved the brining part as well! I did use a half-cup of butter for the initial brushing and another half-cup for the second.

In the middle of cooking but for easy turning. Put on oven gloves and then put 1 gallon bags over those.

My absolute favorite turkey! I have made this about 4 times now! I will never go back to the old way. The only thing I do differently is I use an oven bag to put everything in! Makes it even more moist, so moist the meat falls off the bone!! mmm

This was without a doubt the best turkey I have ever cooked.  I didn't have room in the fridge for a stockpot (the bird was 23 pounds) so I used a cooler, 2 bags of ice and covered all in water.  It worked like a charm.  Also increased the veggies as others had recommended.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have brined my turkey for years.  This just confirms how much more tender and juicy it can be.  I use the seasonings in extra melted butter for basting every hour!

What a fiasco this turkey was.  Soaking it in brine did nothing to improve the flavor or moistness. And I'm not even going to get into all the trouble I had lifting the turkey after it was covered with water to remove it from the refrigerator. I should have known that turning it right-side-up during the roasting process would present a problem.  Using my silicone-gloved hands to turn it over, the turkey stuck to the rack (which I had greased) and pulled all the skin off the breast.  This was the most dried out, tough turkey I've ever cooked. And because the recipe said not to cover the turkey, my oven is a big, greasy mess from top to bottom. Never again!

This was my first turkey, and I won't bother looking for another recipe -- this is it!

I didn't bother roasting the turkey upside down, and the meat was really flavourful and moist anyway, if slightly salty (I may cut down on the salt in the brine mixture next time). 
In addition to simply rubbing butter all over the bird, I also mashed half of the butter with a teaspoon or two of dried thyme, which I then spread under the skin and all over the breast. 

This was a fantastic recipe. Thanks for helping to make my first turkey dinner a success, Shelly!

This recipe is not for the low sodium dieters....but it does make one juicy turkey.  Rinse the turkey really really well or it will be too salty for even the average person.

I have been brining my 24 lb. turkey for years. I add 1 cup sugar to 2 cups salt, mix in water and pour over turkey in brining bag. Seal it shut and place in cooler with ice overnight. Rinse off brine and pat dry. Stuff bird with veggies if you want. Roast over a bed of whole cleaned carrots, halved onions, celery, and parsnips. You can also chop up poultry herbs and mix with butter and carefully slide under breast skin. Check your turkey sooner, rather than later. Brined birds cook faster. If you have convection roast on your oven DO use it. My 24 lb turkey takes 3 hours. Always moist and tender. Make sure you let it sit for at least 30 minutes.

I always, always, ALWAYS put my turkey in a brine at least one day before Thanksgiving, and it's absolutely delicious.  I like to add a quartered orange to this brine recipe(squeeze the juice first into the brine), as well as a couple tablespoons of allspice berries, several whole cloves, and I load it with fresh herbs and parsley stalks.  Then, when I put the turkey in the oven I leave the parsley stalks, oranges, and onions scattered throughout the turkey pan to continue adding flavor while it cooks.  It's absolutely delicious!

We roast our turkey similar to this.  Always cook breast side down for the first 2/3 cooking time.  You will never have a dry turkey, ever.  We add portabella mushrooms on the bottom of the pan with chicken/turkey broth.  Wow, what a gravy you have.

I made this last year for my new husband who normally doesn't like white meat. This turkey came out so moist I could not believe it. I used the baggy covered pot holders like others suggested to turn the turkey. My husband was so impressed he has been telling the ladies at work. I just can't rave enough about this reciep. I am now the talk of the family.

AWESOME! This was the juiciest, tastiest turkey I have ever had. My stock pot wasn't big enough for brining, so I used a small Rubbermaid container. The weather was cold enough outside, so I left the container on the porch to brine overnight. Since I cooked a 24 lb. bird, I increased the amount of vegetables and wine. I didn't turn the turkey as the recipe suggests, I just kept it breast-side-up for the entire time (24 lb. bird, about 5 1/2 hours). I also baisted with the juices from the pan every hour or so and kept the turkey loosly covered with foil until the breast reached 180 degrees. The turkey browned beautifully, even loosly covered with foil. I received several compliments during dinner. We will brine the turkey every year! This was a HUGE success - thank you Shelly!

My family has brined the turkey for the last three years and it has turned out perfectly each time! This year, even after letting it sit and rest, there was so much juice coming out we had to place towels around the carving board! I also add about 3/4 of sugar to the brine water to help with the browning of the skin. This is the only way I will ever do a turkey. You've never had breast meat so moist!

Great recipe! I love turkey all year long and I have made it several times. It has turned out great every time! Brining is the way to go. When I've tried putting herbs and stuff in the brine, I didn't taste a difference, so I stick with just salt. I've tried it with and with out the wine, and I don't taste a difference there, either. So, now I just leave it out.

IT'S A KEEPER!  I used this recipe in my first solo turkey attempt.  In contrast to how I imagined turkey prep to go, this was easy-- these directions are very straight-forward.  And the turkey was DELICIOUS!  I was very heavy on the wine (I poured until I saw it all over the bottom of my pan), and although this probably sabotaged my gravy-making attempts, I think it made for a really juicy turkey (my nibbling toddler dropped a small piece on a table cloth, which then showed a wet spot where the turkey fell). 

For other first-timers like me, be sure to plan ahead!  If you want to thaw your turkey in the fridge (easier than using water), be sure to throw it in the refrigerator about a week in advance.  I bought some turkey bags for the brining, since I don't have a huge stock pot.  I still ended up double-bagging it in a garbage bag, just to be on the safe side.  Also, I used two folded (clean) kitchen washcloths to flip the turkey onto its back, and flipped it lengthwise, since I had no tools substantial enough to assist me with such a weight, and the lenghthwise roll proved a little more manageable.  Oh, and if you don't have a roasting pan or rack, you can use a large baking pan (I used a glass one) and rest the turkey on uncut carrots and celery to keep it from sitting directly on the bottom of the pan.

The flavor is amazing, always does turn out right.  The only "problem" is a lack of drippings for gravy.  But, since that isn't the turkey itself, it doesn't detract from my rating.  The best thing about this recipe, timing has never been off.  The turkey is always done when the recipe says it will be done.  (Something we've struggled with a lot.)

Use a big garbage bag for the brine water. Much easier when you have a big turkey!

I found this to be a very delicious and easy recipe for my Thanksgiving turkey. I used Sea Salt as I could not find kosher salt at the store and it worked quite well. I did have some difficulty trying to turn the bird over after 2/3 of the roasting. After giving it some thought, I grabbed a couple of old pot holders and placed one in each cavity of the bird. This gave me a very strong hold on it and I was able to easily turn the bird over.

This was tender and flavorful and I will definitely use this recipe again, although I will
be careful to rinse the salt more *thoroughly* from the turkey.  The vegetables were not edible
because they were so salty, and the drippings made a delicious gravy that bordered on being too
salty.

This is a delicious recipe. Ultimately I found it was best to let the turkey itself sit in the mixture during the initial cooking with breast down. Then I flipped it onto a rack to let it cook the rest of the way. The flip was simple, I placed a wooden spoon inside the cavity to use as leverage, then just pushed a 180 on it using the other hand with a rag or mit to avoid being burnt, and just eased the turkey down. Great recipe!

I used this recipe last year and it was amazing. It was our first year in our new home and we were having a Thanksgiving dinner for my whole family (extended included) and my husbands whole family. It was my first time ever hosting such a large dinner and also my first turkey. I was motified that it would turn out horrible. I followed the recipe and it was amazing. I received so many compliments and I am cooking the turkey again this year. Thanks!!!

Very moist and delicious!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND cooking the turkey breast side up.  It it does not make a pretty presentation cooking breast side down.  The skin peeled off because it stuck to the bottom of the pan.  And the legs were sitting in juice so they began to separate from the turkey.  They were mosit, but falling apart.  Overall a delicious recipe though!!!!

I've cooked many a turkey, but none was as moist as this one.  I usually find white meat too dry for my taste, but I loved it when cooked this way!  Prior to roasting, I brushed it with olive oil rather than butter--it's healthier for you and just as delicious.  And I agree with the others who said to rinse it well; even with much rinsing it will still be slightly salty, so don't add any extra in the cooking process and try it before you salt it at the table.

This was the first turkey I ever made 2 years ago.  My mother-in-law even raved about how delicious it was!  Don't skip the brining...that is key to a moist bird.  You can even mix it up a bit with the brine and add the salt directly to the brine and add allspice berries and whole black peppercorns (just be sure to get all the salt dissolved).  Simply wonderful, thank you!

This was a great Trukey recipe, however, I still don't know if turning the bird upside down was a key to the greatness or not.  I concur, expect to use and eat more veggies. 

Try this, lift the skin and add fress herbs (rosemary, thyme and lemmon grass) and garlic between the skin and the meat.  Also, rub butter and seasoning mixture below skin and inside cavity.  Keep the salt very low, if any, since it can get very salty after all the other steps.

I was brave and tried this new turkey recipe with 24 quest coming for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a complete success.  Everyone raved about it.  It will now become my traditional turkey recipe.  On a 23lb. turkey I used 2 1/3 cups of kosher salt.  It was perfectly salted all the way thru.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and wouldn't make my turkey any other way. This the perfect recipe and I don't change anything about it. The brining makes a huge difference! The turkey is so tender and juicy. This is also a huge hit with my family!

i used this recipe for my very first thanksgiving turkey about 5 years ago.  we all loved it.  i got so many compliments.  even my hubby's step dad liked it and he hates turkey.  i did change a couple things.  i didn't have a pot big enough so i used a new and clean 5 gallon bucket with lid.  we have a second fridge in the garage and the bucket fit just fine in there.  i did a practice turkey and found that while it was more moist than usual it was still a bit dry in the breast area.  so i added an apple inside the turkey.  i cored it and cut it into wedges.  the apple helped to make it more moist.  it was delicious and the gravy made from the juices had a sweetness to it.  another reviewer said their turkey fell apart when turning it over.  trussing the turkey should keep that from happening.

This recipe was excellent!!  My first turkey ever, and I wasn't disappointed.  

I added apple cider vinegar, brown and white sugar to the brine, and I added some fuji apples to the veggie mix.  I used a turkey with a pop-up timer, rested it for 45 minutes, and it was juicy and wonderful.  The veggies came out slightly tart and tangy.  

I made a gravy by heating 2 Tablespoons of flour with 2 Tablespoons of fat (from the drippings) in a saucepan.  I drained the rest of the fat from the drippings and added water to make 2 cups of liquid.  I added that to the fat/flour mixture and boiled while stirring for about 10 minutes or so.  It was the best gravy I've ever had.  

I can't wait to impress guests with this recipe!

The turkey itself tasted good.  BUT, the skin was too crispy and in general this was alot more trouble than necessary.

I tried this recipe for my first turkey ever, and it came out delicious!! my husband loved it! i am definately saving this recipe. I could pratically shred the turkey rather than have to carve it. Very moist and extremely tender. I skipped the part about turning turkey over while cooking (still came out perfect). I also used chicken broth instead of white wine. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

The wonderful reviews have convinced me to use this recipe for making my 1st turkey next week. Two questions...do I need to tie the legs together with string? And how do I make the gravy that so many people are raving about?

I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving last month and got so many compliments from my guests. I made a couple changes. When I rinsed the brine off the turkey next day I rubbed it with a Caribbean seasoning (mixture of ground onion, garlic, chives, salt, pepper and cilantro.) Then I rubbed the butter mixture under the skin as well as on top.  It was so juicy and flavourful. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing Shelley!

Perfect it is!  I did brine it overnight and stuffed it.  A nearly 15 pound bird took 4 hours and 15 minutes plus 30 minute standing.

This turns out a very juicy and flavorful turkey, but be warned that if you plan to use the drippings for gravy, it could be very salty.

Thank you! This was my first turkey to make and there were no left overs for our family! I brined the turkey in my sink with ice water and covered the top of the bird with a bag of ice for 12hrs. I also used a cooking bag and cooked for 6-8 hours in an oven of 250 over night. I stuck two whole onions inside the birds cavity and used a bottle of charrdonay (that was what I had on hand). Used fresh sage and parsley with garlic and dried thyme, rosemary and paprika in butter  and basted the turkey. This was a test run I made for our church thanksgiving and like I said I had none to take home! Great recipe!

Found this recipe last week and cooked a 15 pound turkey...sort of a test run!  The turkey was perfect; very, very tender with a wonderful flavor.  And, this was a "market" turkey at sixty-nine cents per pound.  The only part I missed was that there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan and not the usual dark drippings which make a good gravy.  Of course, this was from all the veggies and the wine.  Good trade-off though since the turkey tasted wonderful.

I have been making my turkeys brest side dowe (1/2 cooking time) for years. I tried the brine last year after seeing it on alton brown. I really like the idea of adding the wine to the pan and the butter (new ideas for me) so I will def add this to my turkey this year. I read one of the reviews say the turkey fell apart when they turned it over. Yes you cooked it too long. Do not follow the time on the recipe. Go by the time of your turkey size. cook on the breast 1/2 to 2/3 done then flip. I will be very hot and you are going to mess up some kitchen towels doing it but oh so worth it.

I love brining.  I used rosemary in addition to thyme as well to season... and infused some the white wine/herbs into the meat.

Excellent. Add some seasoning to the brine and it will be much better since the flavors will be pulled in with the water. I used liquid few drops of liquid smoke flavor to make tast as if it was in the smoker all day.  By the way, this is not just for turkey. You can brine ANY MEAT. Chicken, lamb, beaf roasts, duck any thing. It is the best way to get flavor and moister into the meat.   I also like Elton Brown's way from Food TV and that is to fast cook the bird at 500 degrees for 15 minutes to brown it on the top then cover the top with aluminim breast cover and reduce the temp to 350 for the remainder of the cooking time.

I'm torn between a 3-star and a 4-star review.  I was delighted that my first ever turkey turned out so moist and flavorful, but it was just too dang salty.  I even used less than the amount of kosher salt called for, and made sure to rinse the bird very well after brining, but it was just too much.  I made a very rich turkey stock from the bones, but the excess salt was overpowering.  I may try this again after reading more about brining, but perhaps I would skip that step next time and just try to baste often.

This works great on that whole chicken that was forgotten in the back of the freezer. In fact, brining the frozen bird works even better than fresh (Thaw before brining). Maybe because it's dry and soaks up more brine. I mix up my brine adding brown sugar or whole allspice or herbs to add more flavor. I butterfly the chicken and let it dry out over night in the fridge, this does make the skin crispy. I put the chicken in a large freezer bag and stand it up in a large measuring cup during brining. This ensures that all the bird is in the brine and no leaks in the fridge.  Juicy and flavorful every time.

I purchased a cooler specifically for brining the turkey since I don't have a pot large enough nor do I have room in the fridge.  In Colorado it's cool enough that I can set the cooler outside overnight and usually into the next morning till I'm ready to cook the bird.  Brining the turkey makes a HUGE difference in moistness!

I prefer to make the brine by simmering about 30 minutes, adding orange peel, 1 cup orange juice, a bay leaf,  3 sprigs of thyme, 15 peppercorns and 1 cup brown sugar.  Cool completely before adding to the turkey, and make sure the turkey is completely covered.  Also, do not soak in an aluminum pot! Brine at least 12 hours.  Also, if possible, use a fresh turkey.  This is SOOOO worth it!

This is sooo yummy! I didn't have a pot big enough to soak the turkey in so I used another turkey bag and that worked out great. I've always cooked my turkey breast down so that wasn't anything new for me. Great recipe though.

I don't know what I did wrong, but for me this tasted just like a normal holiday turkey (I made it mid-year though). I am just thrilled that I did not mess it up and everybody liked it. But it was not overly juicy like I expected. I soaked it for over 12 hours, and tried to follow all the directions, but it still came out just a regular turkey for me. But again, the 4 stars are because I made a nice beautiful turkey and would never have otherwise I'm sure. The great thing was I did not cover it, and it turned out an amazing presentation, the color was perfect and it could have been on the cover of a magazing! I put my potholders inside plastic zip-locs and turned the turkey (but it melted the sack just a bit on one side) and that worked out great. Per other reviews, I did not cook veggies inside bird, but on the outside on the rack. They turned out fine (I don't mind greasy veggies so I'm not a good judge of it). The pan will be full of juice though just from the brining process.

I made this last year and it was so good and moist even my fiance's grandmother loved it and she doesn't really like turkey.  The white wine really adds a nice flavor and I am making this again this year.  Great recipe.

This is the ONE!  Absolutely do NOT skip brining.  I use a Rubbermaid washtub to brine.  Plain Kosher salt for a brine is excellent, but this year I added to 3 c. salt: 3 c. brown sugar, 3 T. cracked black pepper, 8 garlic cloves, 8 bay leaves and 4 sprigs fresh rosemary.  Then I followed the Perfect Turkey recipe.  Jump up and down it was so good!  (Even my mother in law was impressed, and my father in law kept taking more and more!)

I made this 2 years ago for thanksgiving. I was 20 at the time living with my bf, cooking thanksgiving dinner for my family and his family. Talk about pressure to not screw up! And the turkey was incredible! Now our families think I'm a master chef! Since then I've been asked to make the turkey every year. This is now a tradition in my family so thank you ??

Very tasty and the gravy was really wonderful.   I also had the issue with the veggies inside the turkey not cooking completely, but the veggies at the bottom of the pan were soooo yummy.  Will definitely use this again.

Most store bought turkeys today are already "brined". I skipped that step as my 12lb Butterball was already brined. I followed directions from there adding a bit of olive oil to the butter mixture. I diced half the veggies for cavity (I heated all diced veggies w/a bit of water in microwave for approx. 3 mins. to start the process) prior to adding to cavity and chopped the other half of veggies in "chunks" which were added to the outside of the turkey when I flipped it. Added fresh Rosemary & Thyme to the veggies as well as fresh garlic and a diced apple. I sprinkled a bit of adobe spice, salt, pepper, bay leaf over turkey and veggies. I didn't have white wine so I used dry red wine which turned out FABOULOUS. Roasted at 330 degrees 2 hours, then flipped and lightly covered with foil for the last hour. Took foil off and let top brown for another 10 mins. Turkey was already done! Placed (oh so moist turkey) on platter while I made the gravy in the roasting pan. Drained out fat from juices and poured all juice into another pot except approx.3tbs. Added a little cornstarch and let 3 tbls of juice thicken, threw in some sliced mushrooms and sautéed them for a few minutes then poured in a cup of the dry red wine and let alcohol simmer. After alcohol reduced, I added the remainder of the juice back to roasting pan (on stove top) and let it come to boil. Added salt and pepper to taste then mixed approx. 3tbls. of cornstarch w/cold water and slowly added to thicken. Family LOVED~

This was my very first Thanksgiving turkey, and it didn't disappoint. I'm sure it would have been better if I'd have had the space in my refrigerator to fit a stock pot to brine it, but alas, such is apartment living. Nonetheless, this was delicious. My only complaint is that my mother (who is queen of gravy) and I had a hard time making gravy because of all of the butter that was in the drippings. A little bit too much for our liking but it didn't detract from the turkey. It was very pretty :-)

The turkey came out great, I received lots of compliments!  I served it for Christmas Eve dinner.  Turkey was moist and oh so delicious!

With the exception of not brining the turkey, went by recipe.  Reading through reviews it was advised not to brine butterball turkeys because they have already been through brining.

For the amount of work that went into this turkey, it was just "ok".  Might look for easier recipes next time.

My first time cooking a turkey and first time cooking for the in laws and it was a big success! I combined it with another recipe and here is what I changed
- Mixed dried sage into butter (remove twigs)
- added one apple and half a lemon inside cavity
- put pieces of butter under the skin in addition to brushing the outside don't forget the thighs
- punctured 2 holes in bottom of turkey at boney part of the rib cage to let fluids out
- added water to bottom of try when it dried
- cooked fennel separately with butter and ouzo, baked sweet potatoes with salt and pepper, roasted and pealed chestnuts and served them with tray vegetables around turkey
- definitely add more vegetables to tray than recipe, they will melt with the heat
- let turkey rest for 20 before serving

Okay - I never had moist and juicy turkey like this before.. This was a hit on Thanksgiving day even with my picky kids who never eat Turkey.. I did not brine it overnight though ( was nervous that it would be too salty) but  I bought a fresh young turkey and put kosher salt all over it and cooked it exactly as the recipe suggested.. Thanks for making my Thanksgiving yummy!

thought turkey was a little salty at first so I will cut back on salt next time.( my fault for not adjusting with a 15 lb bird) My hubby loved it and I even took the carcass and all the cooking veggies and made a really great turkey stock for soup.  The herbs,wine and veggies gave stock a wonderful flavor without adding anything!

Very impressed ... my 1st turkey was a success thanks to this recipe. Carved the turkey and put it in the crockpot w/ the jiuce - served as sandwiches for a family celebration. Will definately make it this way again. (I did use an oven bag and it took 3 hrs.)

Amazing recipe! Be sure to use kosher salt for the brining. Also covered it with foil for 2/3 of the cook time. Came out AMAZING!! We had a small turkey for the 2 of us for Christmas and we finished ALL of the leftovers which is very rare! Very moist and delicious. Didn't even need to use gravy! Make sure to use good drinking wine also!

PERFECT!  Have to say was just a wee bit worried since we only had one turkey and so many people coming on Thxgiving and wanted everything to be just right.  Using a new recipe you never know what can happen.  This recipe was to die for!  Will be using it from here on out along with everyone else that came for Thxgiving!  = )  Best turkey I have ever eaten...incredibly moist.  Thx for sharing.

Amazing!!   Here is a great way to do the brind though (more flavourful than JUST kosher salt):  Fresh rosemary, basil, peppercorns, juice of 2 lemons and 2 oranges; and for each gallon of water needed to cover the bird, add 1 cup kosher salt and 1 cup brown sugar.

This is a success. I put the turkey right side up from the beginning and cover it with foil paper then uncover it for the last half hour and bast it several times. Simple, nice looking and very good.

Turkey was great, flavorful, and moist!! The presentation on the other hand wasn't great.  It didn't have the beautiful golden skin as in years past.  I guess that's the sacrifice!

This is the best turkey my family and I have had in years.  This was my first year the veterans let me have my shot at it and it was a show stopper.  It was just as pretty as it was delicious! The only thing I didn't do was turn the bird wrong side up - just cooked it breast side up the whole time.  This is the juciest turkey EVER!! My husband loved it so much he went and bought another turkey the next day for me to cook so he didn't have to share!!

This was the best turkey recipe that I have tried (or it turned out the best). I had to downsize it a bit for a 11 pound turkey, but all worked out great. It was extremely moist with great flavor. My only caution with this recipe is that flipping a hot turkey is a bit difficult. My boyfriend had to help me do it and he wore special heat resistant gloves that he uses for work. If someone has a trick for flipping the turkey, please let me know :-). Otherwise this recipe is "perfect".

By far the best turkey!  I used this recipe to cook Thanksgiving for my new in-laws and everyone raved about the turkey.  I used salt and alittle bit of brown sugar and let it soak overnight.  I put a few pads of butter under the skin over the breast and did not roast breast side down, instead, I roasted breast side up the whole time, and started it at 450 for the first 30 minutes and then 350 for the remaining time.  I also brushed butter on the skin.  Turkey was the best EVER.  I will be doing this every year!

Very good turkey, very moist and tender. The best part, however, was the leftovers.  I doubled the amount of veggies, thyme, & bay leaves when I cooked the bird and saved all the veggies, unused drippings, & carcass to make soup later. This turkey soup was the BEST ever!  Leftover turkey, stock (made from the carcass) & veggies from roasting, rice, and the extra fresh thyme from the package...WOW! UPDATED: I brine my turkey now in apple juice instead of water & rinse off the brine the night before and let sit uncovered overnight. It makes for the nicest skin. Because of this recipe, I now have to buy two 25 lb. turkeys at Thanksgiving; one for the family and one for us the following weekend - we can't get enough!

This is a great recipe! My husband said this years turkey was the best one I've made yet, and I have been roasting turkeys for about 20 years now, I also could not find kosher salt and had to use sea salt as well. Thanks for the recipe!!

The best......I really mean....THE BEST turkey I've ever made!  I didn't brine it. I added 1 can of low-sodium chicken broth in the pan along with the wine.  Did everything else the same.  Then I let the turkey cool, cut it up in slices, strained the veg.from the pan and put the juice back in the pan.  I then put the sliced turkey in the juice, and put it in the refrigerator.  All I had to do the next day was put the pan in the oven and warm through.  After warmed through, I made gravy with the juice.  FANTASTIC gravy too!

I wasn't very sure about brining, because I've never done it before. I used less than half of the recommended ammount of salt to actually rub on the bird, but added salt to the water until it tasted just slightly salty. The cooking was a breeze, the butter gave the turkey a beautiful color. Juicy white meat that even the guests that prefer dark meat enjoyed. The pan drippings made a fabulous gravy. The greatest thing about this recipe is the ease - I didn't even have to baste it. I will absolutely be using this recipe for every Thanksgiving and Christmas to come. Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good turkey - I just cooked a breast this year and wanted to be sure it stayed moist.  Love to use a brine-makes all the difference.  Added a cup of orange juice and some brown sugar to the brine, from years past experience.  Basted 8 lb. breast every 1/2 hour and it cooked in just under 2 hours.  Ended up with great drippings, and some of the best gravy we've had.

Incredibly good!  The breast was so moist!  I will never cook a turkey the 'old' way again!!  Also, at least triple the veggies...they are too delicious!  Thanks Shelly for the recipe!

This is my second year making the turkey, and I tried this recipe.  My husband thought it was soooo moist and flavorful.  I did make a change, instead of white wine, I used olive oil and honey mixture.  Turning the bird, give it such a beautiful color all round.  Will be doing this again.

Making our turkey this way is now our annual tradition.  I stuff the cavity with herbs, garlic cloves and orange slices for roasting.  I have to add wine/broth to pan intermittently while roasting, otherwise my juices burn.

For my first time cooking a turkey, I turned to this recipe for help.  Wow!  So impressed with the results!  All though I had a much smaller turkey, only 5 lbs. :)  I guessed on the measurements of salt & veggies & such.  Instead of soaking it in water overnight, I used Grandma's Farmhouse Turkey Brine, also from this site, instead.  I also, decided to cover it, as many people advised, to help seal the moisture in the turkey.  Then I removed the cover for the last 20 min. of cooking time or so, to get that nice golden color!  Again, great recipe, especially for beginners!

This receipe is the absolute absolute best. My inner Paula Dean does add about four additional sticks of butter and does about a half a bottle of wine not a cup. :) i put some of the butter inside the cavity along with the veggies. I also keep basting it about ever hour. It always comes out perfect and super moist.

Truly the best turkey ever....and I have cooked lots and lots of turkeys.  I use a fresh, free range, organic bird and used Cook's Illustrated verson of allowing it to dry out.  I also used a portable convection oven since the bird was only about 12-13 pounds.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  Leftovers for sandwiches were even moist and juicy after several days.

This was the second time I ever baked a turkey in my life. The first time was a disaster! This turkey came out perfect....literally. I had to read up on the brining process and learned how important it is to making sure the turkey will retain water and come out juicy. Whatever you do, don't skip this step. If you follow the directions to the letter, you should do quite well.

I have been stuffing my turkey with vegetables and fruits for years. Try lemons, apples, onions and the spices you like. Turn the turkey so the breast is down not up, it will be a moist turkey breast not dry. The stuffing is always better in its own dish, doesn't turn out so mushy like when you put stuffing in turkey. Don't forget to season the outside and inside of the turkey also.
Happy Thanksgiving !

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out too salty.  The next time, I used only 1 cup of salt and allowed turkey to soak for about 1 hour in the sink.  I also injected with my own seasoning and put in the fridge overnight.  Followed the rest of the recipe and exactly and got a really great and juicy turkey.  Thanks for posting.
Forgot to mention it, but the drippings from the turkey into the pan and flavors from all the veggies and wine helped to make the best gravy I've ever had.

This Turkey was amazing. I did add a few things though. I didn't brine the turkey. I also didn't use as much salt. Instead, I gave the turkey a good rub with Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. Then I injected it with Tony's marinade. I basted the whole thing with my leftover marinade. Even though I brushed the turkey with the marinade, I still also brushed it with the regular butter. When I turned it back over, I brushed it with the rest of the butter, the rest of the marinade, and then sprinkled more creole seasoning on top. Then I flipped it and did the same to the other side. This turkey turned out wonderfully. Everyone loved it!

I added whole cloves of garlic to the veggies in the cavity.  I minced garlic, added that to the butter and placed that under the skin.  Tented the bird with aluminum foil to help retain moisture.  After roasting, I pureed the remaining veggies, garlic, and spices (except the bayleaf) and created a gravy with turkey stock.  Tasted amazing, no need for a thickener.

Absolutely the best turkey I've ever had.  And the vegetables were fantastic.  I could have made a meal of just the vegetables they were so tasty.  I used red wine as I had forgotten to buy white and it was still fabulous.

This is the first turkey I've ever made.  I'll be looking for other recipes.  No one ate the vegetables, and they didn't seem to bring much in the way of flavor.  There are probably better recipes out there, despite the deceptively high rating on this site.

This is the best turkey yet. I didn't have the dry white wine so i used chicken broth which worked just fine.  Will try the wine next time though. I didn't read the entire recipe when I started the brine and my turkey was only about 10 lbs so ivwas worried it would be too salty, but it was great.  The water was completely saturated with a lot of salt left in the bottom of the pan so it worked anyway.

I combined this recipe with the recipe called "Turkey Brine" here on the allrecipes website, and it was delicious. I used the portion of this recipe to fill the turkey cavity to enhance the flavor of the turkey from the inside. I also used the white wine suggested in this recipe, which was a great idea.

Wow.  This turkey was fantastic.  Everyone at dinner mentioned it was the best turkey they had ever had.  I added rosemary to the brine and that was it; put it in an oven bag and put that in a stockpot overnight in the fridge.  I had a 12lb turkey, so I only used about a cup of salt.  The next day, stuffed with a sliced apple, half a large onion, a chopped large carrot, and some sliced frozen celery.  Rubbed with olive oil and put in the oven uncovered at 350 for 3 hours.  I forgot the bay leaf but that probably didn't matter much.  We poured apple wine over it, and halfway through added a cup of water in the pan since it dried up.  Never flipped it.  It came out perfect, the skin was crispy and yummy, and it cut like butter.  Slightly salty but it tasted perfect.  After the turkey is done I'll boil it down into soup, and add the vegetables that were stuffing it when the soup is done since they're already soft.  I'll never make a turkey another way after this.

This was the first turkey I have ever cooked, and also the best turkey I have ever eaten. I added more seasonings to the brine other than salt, doubled the amount of wine in the pan, and added more veggies. Delicious!

Oh Yesssss!!!  I've roasted many turkeys and always like to try a new recipe, but I don't think I will ever roast a turkey any other way than this.  We followed the directions and roasted a 13 lb. turkey on a rack in a roasting pan breast-side down and turned it 2/3 way through per directions while paying close attention to the internal temperature of the thigh with a meat thermometer. The only thing I did differently was roast it at 325.  Never have I had such moist and tender breast meat. And because it's breast-side down, no need to baste. It's self-basting!  I was a rock star at Thanksgiving this year!!!

This was my first ever Thanksgiving turkey.  When I told my family that I was going to cook the turkey without aluminum foil or an oven bag (like they do), they thought I was crazy.  I think they ate their words when they tried this turkey.  Although when it came out of the oven, it looked terrible (definitely not like the ones in the pictures), it was by far the best turkey I have ever eaten in my life.  I hate white meat and even the white meat was juicy on this one.  In the morning, the turkey was still juicy after being microwaved.  I will forever use this recipe.  I did not use any of the vegetables or white wine.  All I did was brine the turkey and cook it by itself.  I did not have a bucket big enough to brine the turkey in, so I used an oven bag.  I put 1 1/4 gallons of cold water, 1 cup of salt and 1 cup of sugar and let it sit in one of the pull out drawers in my fridge.  The extra effort of brining is well worth it.  I also used a Butterball turkey (one reviewer said not to brine it, as it's already brined). Obviously I did not have a problem with it, so if you want a Butterball, get a Butterball!

Great recipe! But DON'T brine your turkey if it's already injected with a salt solution (like most commercial brand are..Butterball, etc)! This recipe is best for fresh, un-messed with turkeys. I'm sure this is the reason that there are quite a few people that said their turkey was super salty (either that or they didn't rinse it well enough). Either way, this is an excellent recipe! Along with the white wine, I also added a cup of chicken broth. Also, once you rinse the turkey (well), dry it and set it uncovered in your fridge for another 12 hours if you can. It makes the skin super crisp and tasty! Excellent!

Used this recipe to roast a 10.6 lb bird yesterday.  I used a full bottle of chardonnay for the dry white wine.  We were duly impressed with the incredible flavor and moistness this turkey finished with.  And the gravy!  WOW!  I will always use this recipe, from now on.

I have a house of picky eaters. If I omit the veggies will that ruin the turkey or is it best to just pull them out after cooking? Thanks!!

My son made this for Christmas Dinner and I have to say it out beats any Turkey that I have ever had rather done in a home or restaurant. We took some home and even if u put it in the microwave to warm up its just as juicy.

it did make the turkey moist,which is what I wanted. But it was too salty for the family and I didn't even use the whole two cups of salt.

Today was the first time I've ever attempted to cook a turkey. I've always wanted to but was afraid of failing at it and ending up with a dry hard turkey that I'd have to throw out. This was so simple to prepare and bake! The meat came out so juicy and flavorful. I think it might just be the best turkey I've ever had, just don't tell my mom....The only change I made from the original recipe is that I didn't use any thyme. I wanted to, I just didn't have any on hand so I went without it. Still super delish!!

I made as written the first time and then added more veggies and garlic/spices the 2nd time around.  I won't cook a turkey any other way and have convinced my Mother in law there is no better way either!  this is the best as is or adjusted to your liking (adding garlic sent it over the top for us)

This is the best turkey my family and I have ever had. I double the amount of wine and add a little water to keep the bottom of the pan from drying out. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made my first turkey in my 54 years Monday using your recipe.  It was so delicious and was not hard at all.  It was very moist and I followed your recipe with no deviations.  So good.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  Kudos to you for sharing!

¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬I made this for Thanksgiving dinner – it’s only my second time cooking a turkey. My father who has ALWAYS been THE "Cooker of the turkey" was extremely skeptical when he watched me run the bird down in salt and place it in a giant pot overnight.  He has been cooking the turkey the same way for 20 years and it’s always been great, why the need to change? BUT - Once the bird was on the table everyone one was highly surprised! It was juicy and delicious.  The only thing I added was ground sage to the outside. My dad even put in a request to have it again for Christmas Eve dinner!  Highly recommend the recipe!

Followed this recipe for Thanksgiving this year, really good turkey.  Got lots of compliments from the inlaws! I had a 20 lb turkey and I had never brined a turkey before. I started Wed. morning, washing the thing and rubbing it inside and out with kosher salt.  Stuffed it with 3 stalks of celery cut up, 1 whole onion and 2 small Granny Smith apples chopped up.  My mom had me worried about it being too salty so I dissolved 1 cup of kosher salt in water instead of 2, stuffed the turkey in an oven bag, poured the salt water over the turkey adding enough water to cover the bird, and put it in a cooler with a bag of ice (no room in the fridge).  Let it stay all day Wed. and took it out about 9pm that night.  Rinsed it REALLY good and let it drain uncovered in the fridge overnight.  Put pats of butter underneath the skin and cooked it according to the directions (uncovered), breast side down to begin with and figured about 4 to 5 hours.  Basted it with melted butter every hour and about 2 hours into it had to cover it with foil to keep the skin from becoming charcoal.  Flipped it at about 3 hours (an experience!) and cooked it another hour uncovered breast side up.  Skin was becoming a lovely brown color so I put the foil back on.  It was completely done at 4 hours and was very moist and juicy.  Will do it this way again next year!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving, but forgot to rate it. Shame on me!   What a fabulous turkey!! Moist, tender, succulent. And the gravy made from the drippings was unbelievable. We only eat turkey at Thanksgiving usually, but I find that I crave this now and find it hard to wait for November to come around to enjoy it again.   I will say I had a hard time handling my 18 pound turkey in terms of putting the salt all over it and getting it in a big stock pot and making space for it in the refrigerator to brine, but I won that wrestling match eventually. :-)   This is definitely the recipe I will use for turkey from now on. Thanks so much for finally curing my dried out tasteless turkey blues!

If possible, I'd give this 10 stars.  This is the only recipe I will ever use when roasting a turkey.  I made two for church and one for our Christmas dinner.  Even the left overs in the frig stayed moist and tasty.  It was a picture perfert turkey; evenly browned from top to bottom.

So delicious.  One of my guests for T-day dinner ate 4 servings!  I did change one thing that I think made my turkey breast extra juicy.  Instead of melting the butter I cut it into about 1/4 inch slices.  I cut small slits into the turkey skin on the breast and inserted a slice of butter into each.  This really kept the breast very moist while it cooked.  This is my new go-to turkey recipes.  Thanks!

This was by far the best turkey I have ever made. I used this recipe and mixed it with the Rosemary Turkey recipe. I cooked the turkey according to the Perfect Turkey recipe. I did everything its says to do and in the morning when I took the turkey out of the brine I used the rosemary recipe. 
3/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

I cooked it breast down and flipped it 2/3 the way through. The turkey was so moist some of the skin broke so I had to baste it every 20 minutes and then I wrapped foil over it and let it cook the remaining time. I made a 24 pound turkey and feed 17 people and EVERYONE said it was seriously the best turkey they have every had. The white meat melted in your mouth and the dark meat was to die for. I will do this every year from now on! Thank you!!!

This was an incredible bird!!  I did exactly as the recipe called for and it was delicious.  I've always bbq'd/smoked or fried our Thanksgiving turkeys but decided to roast this year due to Colorado weather not cooperating.  Brining the bird in 2 cups kosher salt and using a non-reactive stock pot worked the best.  Thanks for a great recipe that will definitely be used for years to come!

I really wanted to rate this recipe higher, but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed.  The bird fell apart when I turned it over, only half way through the cooking time.  I can't imagine how bad it would have been had it cooked 2/3 the way as the instructions said.  I also had to keep adding liquid, as I had hardly any drippings.  Was it moist?  Yes, but not very different than other turkeys I have cooked.  I think I will continue to make my turkeys the way I have done for years...  The gravy was very good though! 
UPDATE: The leftovers were VERY good.  I'm not sure why, but sometimes flavors mingle better after the first day.

I didnt read all the comments but I make mine alot like this but instead of just water and salt I do vegetable stock, black peppercorns and some candied ginger and a touch of Brown sugar. Heat it all up to a boil, then add some ice to make it cold or let it get cold in fridge and let the turkey sit in that brine all night and YUMMMM!

Fantastic! Marvelous!  Simply wonderful! This is guaranteed to be the best, most delicious turkey you will ever have!  The meat is so tender and juicy, I have cooked turkeys before, but have never had such rave reviews.  Everyone simply loved it!  There were no leftovers!  The only thing I did different was I stuffed it with a homeade bread stuffing instead of the vegetables, other than that, there is no need to adjust this recipe.  The kosher salt soak was amazing.  I would highly recommend this to everyone!  AAAAA+++++

I made this turkey for last Thanksgiving and i plan on making it agai this year. They call this the perfect turkey for a reason. Not only was mine the most moist turkey i have ever had it also litterally fell off the bone. I mean when i pulled it out of my NESCO, not oven, I had to have 3 people help me pull the meat out of the pan. It was funny because no one had ever seen a turkey do that. Thank you so much From Fort Hood, TX. it really was the Perfect Turkey

This turkey recipe is the best!  Ours didn't come out burnt like the one in the picture lol though.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the dry white wine - we used riesling & it was perfect.  The turkey was moist & everyone commented on how great it tasted.  Will be making this every thanksgiving from now on.  Thank you!

This was the best turkey!  It was sooo moist and easy to make....Truly, the hardest part was flipping the turkey.  I stuffed the turkey with onions and apples and rubbed sage on the turkey, as well.
It was beautiful and everyone loved the flavor.

This was the first turkey I've ever made and it turned out absolutely perfect.  Instead of just rubbing with salt and soaking.  I did that plus made a water solution with about a 1lb of brown sugar, more salt and enough water to cover the bird.  It was wonderful!

I have been brining for a few years now. I have also added Brown sugar to the water as well as candied ginger and garlic. The best way to brine a very large turkey if you dont have a pot big enough and to be sure it is fully submerged is to buy a 5 gallon paint bucket and clean it out real well, you can get this cheap at Home Depot or Lowes. submerge it and be sure to put a heavy plate on top to keep it from bobbing up. you can take a rack out of your fridge, and slide it in. Or some people just use an ice chest. The meat is so flavorful!

I followed this recipe to a tee! It was a lot of work and less flavorful and moist than my simple traditional turkey in the bag that we have every year. I have learned my lesson.

Excellent turkey!  I used my convection oven which browned it beautifully.  I turned mine twice.  I'm not sure if the vegatables in the pan are needed.  In my opinion they're too greasy too eat.  The abundant pan drippings made some of the best gravy!

Very good. My only problem was, being new to turkeys, I asked the butcher how large a bird to buy. He said 1 lb. per person, and I bought a 9 lb bird for 7 people. It was too small. Maybe because the recipe was so good and people ate more than usual... Also, I was wondering what you would soak a very large bird in as the largest pot I have barely held the small turkey. Advice, anyone?

This is the first and only turkey that I've made for Thanksgiving dinner and it was/has been excellent.  

Few Notes:
1.)  For flipping the turkey a tip I saw that was incredible was to use oven mitts inside of gallon freezer bags to flip the turkey with no mess.
2.)  You can use stuffing to stuff it like any other turkey.  Just because the recipe doesn't call for it doesn't mean it doesn't work.
3.)  More white wine the merrier to baste it in.  I used extra and the outcome was a ton of AMAZING gravy.  The gravy (as dumb as this sounds) will make everything better, it's that good.  
4.)  If you like a bit more salt, use onion or garlic salt in with it and it really helps out.

Great turkey recipe.  My breast skin was not as crispy as I wished but it was great and had wonderful drippings for gravy.  I will try again.  I did not soak overnight.  My husband's fried turkeys were slightly more popular, but guests who did not usually favor turkey ate this one.

I used this recipe for the first time this Christmas and turned out the moistest juiciest turkey we've ever had.
I didn't follow the brining portion of the recipe, instead I used the most popular brine recipe and we brined our turkey for 24 hours in a coleman cooler on the patio.

After the brine, I rinsed out the turkey well. Placed the veg, thyme and we stuffed the neck with stuffing.
I brushed the bird with butter and cooked uncovered, breast down (which caught the mothers attention) and roasted until the internal temp reached about 160. Then we flipped the bird breast up (with oven mitts in ziplocs to protect hands), brushed with butter again and roasted until done. WE did 350 and it took a bit longer than expected (paritally in part because we were going in and out of the oven a bit melting brie and cooking roasted garlic) but eventually I got the two mothers approval that it was indeed cooked and fit to serve. Pulled it out and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.

It   looked     AMAZING.   Beautifully browned and caramelized.  Moist, juicy, delicious.
 I sit smugly now basking in the glory of winning Christmas.

I have NEVER made a turkey before and was going to be hosting Thanksgiving in my new house. Used this recipe and it was a hit!! The turkey was amazing! It was so moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly, no one could believe that this was my first turkey. Didn't have any leftovers. Now everyone wants me to do the turkey for now on. Thank you Shelly White for this awesome recipe!!

A+mazing!!! This was my first time ever making my own turkey. Decided to go all out. I used a 14lb butterball turkey and used a different but similar brine; couple of substitutions but mostly because I didn't have everything. I used my thyme from the spice rack and added way more celery(little bunch) and used a can of chicken broth instead of wine. but it was absolutely amazing! Had my husband help me flip it and it was perfect 180° at 3 1/2 hours for me. I think letting it rest for 30 min made a huge difference. Super flavorful and perfectly seasoned :) thanks for sharing this. Had to make a turkey for an event tomorrow and this was a lifesaver!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was the best turkey I have made. Much easier than making all the flavored brines (which I have tried) and just as flavorful. Will be using this one again!!

I made this Turkey last year for the first time. My husband loved it so much he asked me, to make sure, if I was going to do it the same way this year. Super simple and turns out yummy. I put my turkey in a oven bag with the brine, in the garage, covered in ice since I usually do not have room in my fridge. :D   YUM YUM

Turned out very flavorful and moist. My husband cooked it in an infared turkey fryer (no oil). I would do it again, but the whole submerging a huge turkey thing was difficult. We put it in a garbage bag, and put the whole thing in a cooler just in case it leaked. Seemed to work, but what a pain!

Best turkey ever! Added fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme and tarragon to brine.  Cooked an 18 lb turkey for 15 people, and leftovers were gone by day after Thanksgiving.

By far the juiciest turkey I have ever made.  I did have a slight problem flipping the bird but maybe because I waited too long.  It started to fall apart.

Perfect bird everytime!  Used a 12-lb turkey, so only used 1 cup salt.  Also added whole peppercorns and fresh sage leaves to brine liquid.

This was really good! Even my husband who is more particular with how food is cooked loved it and thought it was delicious.  We have always done our turkeys in the deep fryer but I didn't feel like spending more money on the peanut oil than we spend on the turkey.  So I tried this recipe and it was a huge success! This was only my second time ever cooking the turkey in the oven so I was definitely nervous and skeptical of how it would turn out.  No worries with this recipe. It was a no brained and it turned out great! Thanks for this recipe! Just a quick note, I doubled the wine and also added a can of chicken broth to the pan because I thought it needed more liquid to cover the veggies. Turned out great!

My first turkey: Very delicious, even after forgetting to brine the turkey overnight (i brined for 2 1/2 hours, I also forgot  to flip the turkey over till the last 30 min! Skin ripped off but mmmm juicy! The juices are unbelievably flavorful! I put clumps of butter under the skin of the turkey, which helped lock in moistness! After pouring melted butter all over I smothered in garlic salt and I received compliments and also, pouring done of the juices over the turkey was a fabulous compliment!

This turkey was great, but I did a lot of things differently. I kept the turkey breast up, tightly covered the breast area with foil until the last hour, and found I needed a LOT more broth on the bottom than just a cup of wine.

I'm not a lover of turkey meat, but this recipe was outstanding! I even loved the left overs!! I did have a problem figuring out what 'soul food seasoning' was, but I googled it and made my own. It is: 2T grnd red pepper; 2T garlic powder; 2T onion powder; 2T dark chili powder; 1T paprika; 1t thyme; 1t black pepper. T=tablespoon; t=teaspoon.

Our guests asked to bring some of the meat home with gravy. That was a first for me! 

This is truly a NO FAIL recipe.

I made this on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. My family said it was the best turkey I have ever made.  Only suggestions..make adjustments on the cups of salt according to the size of turkey and as somebody else suggested, use salt free butter.  I had a 12LB turkey and should of only used 1 cup of salt.  Also, I found a package of fresh Poultry Herbs at the grocery store and put all of them around the bottom of the turkey, along with the veggies.  The gravey was wonderful too!

First time brining a turkey and it turned out perfect!  Served for Thanksgiving and everyone was raving about how juicy the white meat was!  I had to do 2 turkeys and ended up brining them in a cooler, and set in garage overnight -easy!

Best turkey EVER. The whole cooking method made the moistest white meat we'd ever had. And the drippings were what made it incredible. What we didn't use to make the gravy, we saved and added it to the After-Thanksgiving Turkey Soup from this site... SOOOOO AMAZING!

I decided to try something different this year and found this recipe and based on the results and complements I am never going back to the old ways! The brine really help to season the turkey.  The vegetables also flavor it wonderfully but the white wine is what really made this turkey very flavorful.  I follow a review that explained that instead of putting it in the fridge they put it in a cooler with ice inside a bag with the water and salt and this was a good tip that I will follow as well.  Overall a winner!!

The turkey was moist and full of flavor. The aroma was amazing. I substituted apple juice for the white wine and substituted a granny smith apple for one of the onions. I also added a fresch sprig of rosemary. I will use this method for all my turkey cooking. mmmmm!

Made this and everyone said it was fantastic.  I personally didn't think it was juicy enough.  I did put the butter and fresh thyme, sage and rosemary in the food processor before slathering on the bird.  Also I added carrots, celery and onion minced to the turkey juices about and hour and a half into cook time.  I will try again, might throw champaign in with it next time.

I've used this for 4 years running. My family raves more each year. The white meat is so juicy. But the real story here is the gravy...it's to die for. I triple the veggies & double the wine. Use lots of fresh sage too. Then I puree about a cup of the savory veggies and add it to the gravy.  I've even quartered apples & sweet potatoes in the bird for little flavor accent.

Cooked the bird according to the recipe, but it was a disappointment compared to past turkeys.  Was much drier than the recipe I usually use, which involves honey, worshestershire sauce, soy sauce and poultry seasoning.  Oh well, live and learn, and go back to what works for you!

I do my turkey this way and also the dry brine way.  I only roast it breast side down for 1 hour though, and the rest of the time breast side up.

@Sarah - the vegetables stuffed in the cavity are just to flavor the turkey and the juices.  You do not serve the vegetables, although they taste good if you decide to!  

@caquilter - Cook's Illustrated did a survey to see which turkey is the best, and the Kosher Brined won out!  It is already brined, so just follow the directions on the package.  You do not brine it again.  I plan to do my own kosher salt dry brine this year but will use a Butterball.

I read in a magazine to also use fresh fruit and stuff the turkey with it and if u cant get white wine try apple juice instead. It makes it just as juicy and tender. Cut the fruit up and peel off skins of the orange limes and lemons. Add parsley thyme and oregano for seasonings of the turkey. And top with 2 cups butter rubbed all over inside and out and bast towards the end once the skin is browning. Great made it this way for 3 years now for thanksgiving been doing this since i started cooking for my own family because i wanted to be sure i made the most tender yet crisp brown skinned turkey n this did it.

Made this recipe last weekend when we had family in town. I didnt have thyme so I used a dry mix of italian dressing seasonings that I had stored. I didnt have time to brine it overnight so I did it for about 6 hours. The turkey turned out delicious and moist! Had a lot of compliments on it. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was great. I found the difference was the next day, the meat stayed so moist even after the family would make sandwiches and not cover it up properly. Thanks for the recipe:)

Brining a turkey in the fridge is a bit cumbersome, even for a small (14lb) bird.  We used a large ice chest with combined water and ice.  By morning some of the ice was still unmelted.  The process resulted in a very moist and tender turkey.

I tried to do everything just as the recipe said.  However, I was kind of disappointed in how the turkey turned out.  Well, the turkey was alright--it looked beautiful, but the meat was not as juicy as I'd hoped, and the gravy was very salty.  I turned the turkey after it had cooked 2 hours, hoping to avoid its falling apart while turning.  That worked pretty well.  I did stuff the turkey, and parts of the stuffing were too salty also.  I rinsed the turkey well after brining, so don't know how you'd get rid of the excess saltiness.  Don't think I'd try it again exactly this way.  Probably will try the upside-down method, but not the brining again.

Fantastic outcome!  I improvised on some of the seasonings so my flavor was a bit more robust.  Roasted 15lb turkey breast side down for an hour and a half uncovered.  (Note:  turning it over intact was the only struggle.  It helps if you have the right utensils which I didn't.  I jammed 2 large knives up the middle and manipulated it into the breast side up position and cooked for 3 addidtional hours until thermometer popped up.  The meat literall fell off of the bones.  My very first Turkey was SUPERB!!!!

Best way to make a Turkey!  I'd like to add that due to new USDA guidelines I would cook at 325*F until 165* in the thigh for a an even juicier delicious turkey.

I have been using thebrine method for years now. I even brine my chickens, cornish hens etc. I use 1 cup sea salt and 1cup brown sugar and cover with ice and water and put it in a 5 gallon bucket overnight.

This was the first turkey I've ever made and this recipe was a great guide! I had a really small turkey as I was cooking only for myself so the amounts I used got skewed a bit, but I tend to take such liberties when I'm cooking. I accidentally bought a utility grade turkey instead of a grade A turkey, but that's okay because the brining process really helped make it a moist and delicious turkey. In the brine, I had onion, carrots, celery, apple, and thyme... just because I could.  No idea if it helped or not, but I did it anyways. For the vegetables, put in the onions, carrots, celery, thyme, and bay leaf as suggested, just in smaller quantities due to the small size of my turkey.  I also added apple, just for kicks.  Used the full 1/2 cup of butter, even though my turkey is half the size of the 18 lbs recommended turkey.  I didn't bother with the turning 2/3 of the way through.  Didn't feel like I needed to... Turned out fantastic! =)

This was my first and best turkey recipe i have made for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it and my boyfriend raved about it for weeks. This is the recipe I'm using for the rest of my life. The only thing is that i used about a cup and a half of kosher salt and that still seemed a little too much. But overall it's great.

This makes a delicious turkey!  I saved all of the drippings and vegetables after Thanksgiving and froze them.  I just recently pulled them out, thawed them, and added chicken in a big pot.  I added some more carrots, some brown rice, a little salt and pepper, and a little more dried thyme.  I let it simmer on the stove for a few hours.  It smelled so good!  It reminded me of how good the house smelled when we were cooking the turkey during Thanksgiving.

Delicious and Beautiful! I got so many compliments on the moist turkey!  I followed the Cooks Illustraded recommendation that another reviewer suggested - to let the turkey sit uncovered in the fridge for several hours after rinsing and drying off the brine. This turkey put off so much delicous pan drippings that the gravy was terrific.  I made the Easy Turkey Gravy from this site.  Awesome.

I used this "Perfect Turkey" recipe last year and it was fabulous! My husband HATED whole turkey before this one. He always complained of turkey being too dry and un-flavorful. Well, he absolutely LOVED this recipe. I had to look it up again this year so that I can prepare my "Perfect Turkey"! Thanks Shelly White and thanks AllRecipes!!

I didn't have kosher salt, so I used ordinary salt, which didn't work so well and left the turkey a bit salty. So my advice to anyone making this is to use kosher/rock/Maldon salt, not fine granulated salt, and rinse it under running water really, really well then pat dry before cooking. If it had not been a bit salty, I would give it 5 stars.

I used the rosemary/olive oil mixture as recommended by Kristin, which was delicious.  I put the turkey in a roasting bag and used two big meat forks to turn it breast side up about 2/3rds the way through.  It didn't fall apart and was beautifully golden brown. A lot of liquid came out during cooking which I kept removing after basting and it made a lovely gravy, together with the drained stock I made by cooking the giblets & neck with a bouquet garni, celery, onions and peppercorns. The turkey was incredibly moist and I will definitely make it again, but I will use kosher/Maldon salt, and RINSE IT VERY, VERY WELL.

Moist & flavorful!  I used a cooler to braise my 20 lb turkey in and it worked perfectly.  The turkey was already fully thawed and so I added ice to keep it cold overnight while it was in the cooler.

We had to use regular salt (we didn't have any Kosher on hand). It tasted pretty gamy to me. My husband loved it though.

My guests really enjoyed this turkey. First of all, for those saying their turkeys came out salty: Make sure you bought a natural turkey and not a pre-basted one. Also the salt to water ratio should be 1 cup per 1 gallon.

Rather than rub my turkey with the salt, I dissolved the salt (also added 3/4 cup of sugar) in hot water first. I had an 18 pound turkey and I did a test first to see how much water I would need in the pot. It turned out that I needed a total of 1.5 gallons of water to keep my turkey submerged. I dissolved 1.5 cups of kosher salt and 3/4 cup sugar in 2 cups of hot water. (Let cool) Then I added the rest of the water to make 1.5 gallons. I placed the turkey in the water and soaked it overnight in the frig. I only put the veggies inside the turkey. I skipped the wine. This is how I will be making all future natural turkeys and turkey breasts. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I was, as always, in charge of the turkey this year for Thanksgiving. Well, this year I decided to try something new. I used this recipe(with some of my own tweaks) and it was a hit! I used chicken broth instead of the wine and I also used more thyme than what was called for.  Everyone loved the turkey! This turkey was the most tender, most jucy bird I have ever made! I told my brother about the turkey and now he has me making him one especially for him when he comes to visit later this month! Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!

This really was the perfect turkey.  I didn't place it breast side down and then turn it because I knew that would be hard to do with a 20 lb. hot turkey.  I didn't use the vegetables, either, since I didn't need them.  So basically, I used the brine and cooking directions - it turned out perfect.  Very moist and very tasty.  Will use this again and again!

This is the perfect juicy turkey. My family and friends raved about it. I did the brining as stated, then I injected it with butter and jalapeno seasoning. I topped it off with the spices rubbed on and inside.  I only had celery, onion, and leeks to put inside.  It was fantastic.

Easy, fabulous smell while cooking, moist, delicious!  We made the A. Brown brined turkey last year, but all agreed this was better.  Cooked faster than I thought and therefore didn't brown as much as I would have liked, so I'll turn it over sooner next time.

This really was good. I was nervous about doing this without having had a practice run, but my fears were unfounded.  I brined my 23.5 lb turkey using 2 cups of kosher salt for the 12 hours as stated in recipe the day before. Then took it out of the brine and stored it overnight in the fridge to let any salty water drain from the bird as suggested by some other reviewers.  My bird had no water drain out at all. I also stuffed my bird because that's the tradition with our family.  I was worried that it would be too salty, but it wasn't and I even put sausage in my stuffing.  Truly, the brining process makes the turkey very moist and tasty. I will always do this from now on each thanksgiving!

Family was very cautious of this.  But it was so amazzzzzingly moist and flavorfull... Per other reviews i did add more vegitables, and drained the brine and let the turkey set a few hours in the fridge withought it.  Other reviews had said it was dificult and messy to flip the turkey.  I tied twine around the turky securing both wings in it, Put my mits inside of baggies and it was so simply easy to flip.. no problems at all... i did Baste every half hour.  And i used 2 cans chicken broth in the bottom of the pan and no wine.  It was amazing and the only way i will ever do a turkey again.  WAY worth the trouble.

This turkey was wonderful, I did do some things a little different: First I boiled the water, 1.5cups kosher salt, thyme and pepper for about 5min, let it cool completely. I spread 1cup of kosher salt all over the turkey, in and out, then placed the turkey into a small cooler and poured the brine mixture over the turkey and let it sit in the garage for about 17 hours. The next day, I wash the turkey very well with cool water, slit holes in the breast and legs and filled with chopped garlic, spread melted butter and olive oil ALL over the turkey and sprinkled with pepper and thyme, then I placed the turkey in the fridge for about an hour to chill. I still stuffed the turkey, but I covered/tented the turkey with tin foil for 2/3 of the roasting time, then the rest of the roasting time I removed the tin foil and watched it brown up, then let the turkey sit for about 30-45min and served. This was the best Turkey I have ever had and since I cooked Thanksgiving dinner for the first time this year, I was very proud (I submitted a photo if you would like to see how it turned out), I am going to do it all again this Christmas and Use it next year!!!! Enjoy, this is a MUST try recipe.

I was very nervous about trying the recipe after reading the reviews this morning about Butterball turkeys. Other reviews said not to use a butterball turkey for this recipe because it would be too salty. I thought, "OMG!! I've ruined the turkey and I haven't even put it in the oven yet!" That was not the case though. I had a 17 pound Butterball turkey and followed this recipe just as it was. The bird was moist, pretty and delicious. I will use this recipe again and again. Next I want to try it with a chicken. Thanks!!

Very, very good. And I mean this. THE best turkey I've ever had. The white wine really makes this. NOTE: Now that I've made this two years running, I now add a mixture of poultry seasoning, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and salt and rub that into the bird before moving on with the rest of the recipe. Outstanding recipe. Our favorite. I can't stress enough to keep basting your bird to get that wonderful white wine/vegetable/turkey juice all up on your bird. This will be my only turkey recipe from now on.

To Yummy,,,you are right, cook your turkey on a roasting rack.  This also will help with the lifting of the bird out of the pan.  Enjoy and Happy Thanksgiving!!

This is the only way to cook a turkey, if you ask me.  Some of you wanted to know about turning the turkey.  Well, you can try and use the top of the roasting pan, flip it and then sort of slide it or life it out and into the bottom,again or, you can use two disposable roasting pans and when it's time to flip the bird (j/k) put the other pan on top of the pan with the bird and flip it.  It might take two people if you have a big bird.  I just thought about this method as I was typing this review.  Another thing I used to do (and I think I'll do it this year) is this: follow the directions, but have the butter room temperature.  Add crushed garlic and black pepper to the butter and rub it all over the turkey.  Then, this is the trick: put everything in a brown paper bag, veggies, spices and all and roast at 425 for 20 minutes,then lower to 350 and continue roasting until done.  This seals in the juices adn spices, then the bag bastes the turkey.   It will not burn!  But, you can't really use the wine.  Trust me....you won't miss it or, maybe you can figure out a way to add the wine a little at a time, after the turkey starts cooking and the bag gets greasy.  Happy Turkey Day To All!

This really is the Perfect Turkey, I made this yesterday to see if I should use it for my Thanksgiving dinner with my family and I literally fell into Turkey heaven.

It's not dry at all, very moist and succulent.

Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful masterpiece :)

I was scared to death about making my first Thanksgiving turkey, but this recipe plus a few little extras was fantastic!! I just rubbed the inside and outside of the skin with a homemade herb butter, and used the bottle of wine on the bottom of the pan,,,, it was fantastic!! Thank you!!

I've done the holiday turkey for years and always gotten compliments.  Several recipes I've tried have turned out well--but this one is THE BEST.  I can stop searching for the perfect turkey recipe because this can't be improved upon!

Brining the turkey overnight is a must! It was so tender and juicy. I won't make it any other way.

This is the first time I've brined (sp)a turkey.  My bird was huge, so I had to buy a 5 gallon bucket to soak the turkey in overnight.  I was also worried about how much salt was used to brine the turkey, but it washed off and didn't taste salty to me.  It was very moist.

A roasted turkey has so much more flavor than a bird out of a bag.  This was a first time endeavor for me and now I know.  We turned the turkey over 2/3 of the way through and now I've been hearing to turn it in the last half hour, just enough to roast the breast.  It didn't need anymore cooking when I turned it so the turkey ended up a little overdone.  I would do the last half hour next time but I will also pay more attention next time as it cooked a lot faster in the last fifteen minutes than it had in the previous three and a half hours.  I do highly recommend the roasting and not using a bag concept, though.  It's just so fantastic when it gets to be roasted instead of steamed.  I'm a convert!

Wow!!  Amazing is the best word for this turkey.  This was our first time ever having Christmas with the whole family and our first time ever making a whole turkey.  We made a few slight adjustments for taste.  First, our turkey was 24lbs.  We soaked ours in salt water for 2 days only because it wasn't defrosting.  Second, we took a steak knife and made stabs in the white meat (like you would a potato) before adding any butter or spices.  I guessed on the amount of butter.  Third, we didn't have the fresh herbs so we only used a little salt, some pepper and dried parsley.  We added the veggies and to the bottom of the pan we added cooking wine (white wine) and chicken broth.  We ended up cooking the turkey breast side down for about 3 1/2 hours, flipped it and cooked it for another 2-2 1/2 hours.  My mom and grandmother (both Italian) said it was the best turkey they have EVER had.  My mother-in-law raved about it.  24lbs and 15 people later, there was a small amount of turkey left.  
I highly recommend this recipe.  It won't disappoint!!!

This is a perfect turkey! I didn't have a container large enough for brining, so I emptied out a produce drawer in my fridge (I have large produce drawers) and lined it with a garbage bag. It worked perfectly for brining. We cooked it breast side up the entire time. I had images of dropping a turkey on the floor while trying to turn it mid-way, and didn't want to deal with that. All of my Thanksgiving guests said it was the best turkey ever. I'll never use another recipe again!

Everyone agreed that this was the best turkey ever.  Very moist and juicy.  I recommend purchasing a pair of silicone gloves to easily flip the turkey over during roating.

I used this recipe as directed only I substituted an apricot glaze from "Ma Lipo's Apricot-Glazed Turkey". The sweetness of the glaze complemented the hearty taste of the wine and veggie-herb meixture perfectly and gave a nice refreshing contrast.

Awesome! I made turkey for the first time this Christmas. The family loved it! It was so tender and juicy. I subbed water for the dry white wine as I didn't have any. Finding a big enough container to brine the bird was a challenge. I will definitely be making this again next year!

I flavored my brine a little differently with fresh herbs, used an electric portable oven and of course kept the wine!  It was the best turkey any of us had ever had!!!  Only thing I don't think the portions are right, I used a little over a 20lb bird and with 12 of us there were very little leftovers.   Will definately use this recipe for now on

OMG!  This is amazing!  I've roasted a LOT of turkeys before, but THIS method/recipe has blown me away!  I must admit that I didn't have the time to brine the bird, so I can't fully review the recipe as it was written.  Otherwise, I followed the method and ingredients as was written.  I can't believe how moist and tender this bird was. Even my 8 yr. old (who is NOT a turkey fan), raved over this!  I'll be doing my birds upside down from now on!

By making this turkey, I may have inadvertantly permanently moved Thanksgiving dinner to my house!  It was an absolute hit, especially for being the first turkey that I've made.  Don't be intimidated by the brining and don't omit it.  It's easy to do and the results are more than worthwhile.  The vegetables turned out nice, but I may use a different combination for the stuffing next year.  Truly is "Perfect Turkey"!

This was GREAT!  I omitted the salt because I brined the turkey before roasting.  Next time I will double the wine.  Yummy veggies...

This was my first time brining a turkey and I thought it was easy and tasty. I had seen on Food Network their version of a brine and did a combo of this recipe and that. I added to the brine some whole peppercorns, a couple of bayleaves and crushed garlic cloves. I let the turkey soak in the brine overnight, cooked as directed according to this recipe and it turned out wonderful. Thank you!

The outcome of this turkey definitely was worth the extra trouble of brining!  I didn't rub the turkey with salt, but instead followed other suggestions here to just dissolve salt into water--first dissolve the cup of salt into a small amount of hot water, then add the rest of cold water so that you are not putting the turkey into warm water!!  (Directions called for 2 cups salt, but I ran out--and it didn't seem to matter because my turkey turned out just great.) I just stood the turkey up inside a regular stock pot and put it in the fridge.  Three hours later, I flipped it so the top side could be submerged for 3 hours, as well.  Then I used pre-sauteed chopped veges to loosely stuff the cavity as well as fill the pan.  Oh, and don't add any salt--there is plenty already there, thanks to the brining process.  I simply peppered the turkey prior to roasting.  OH, and the best part is that I didn't have to baste this turkey throughout the entire cooking process.  I simply buttered the skin in the beginning, as well as when I turned the turkey over midway (at that point, I brushed melted butter over it.)

WOW WOW WOW This was the BEST! I made this today for Thanksgiving and now I'm on my 2nd plate! I think this was a very easy method and cooking it breast side down was definately a plus. I rubbed it with butter and turned it back breast side up for the last 2 hours,.. this turkey was absolutely the best I have ever made! It is also a very pretty bird to serve, deep golden brown crispy skin, juicy in all areas, and EASY. I brined my turkey in 12oz table salt,6oz white sugar and 6oz brown sugar, covered in water in the fridge for at least 12 hours. Worth it believe me!

I love this recipe because it gives you a turkey that you normally would see on tv or magazines.   Flipping the turkey on both sides is the secret to a "perfect turkey"!

Great turkey. Did a 23 lb. Used my turkey fryer pot to soak. Added more carrots. Roasted a little longer because of size. I have tried to cook turkey many different methods. This is the best. Thank You

The turkey was done perfect and the white meat was so succulent.  I don't remember having a turkey this good in my 67 years and it is the first time I did not stuff with dressing.  Just excellent.

This turkey was moist and yummy! My only "complaint" was that it is easier said than done to flip a turkey during cooking. I had a 22 lb turkey and it was tricky, it was hot and also so moist it was hard trying not to damage it. Since it cooked on its breast most of the time some pieces(skin and meat) came a little loose and when flipped over it wasnt as "pretty" as it could have been, but no one minded and ate it up. It's also tricky to put water around the turkey (used two trashbags) and stuff it in the fridge.. it was somewhat funny really. I most likely will use the recipe again. thanks! :)

This past Thanksgiving was my first time hosting Thanksgiving dinner.  It is also my first year being married and I was hosting dinner for my in-laws.  I had never baked a whole turkey myself before and was looking for something that was as juicy as my mom's.  Of course I wanted to impress my new in-laws also.  This turkey was absolutely wonderful.  My father-in-law said I may get stuck making the turkey every year now!  There was not even one morsel of turkey that got thrown away this year.  My mom heard about the turkey and wants me to make it for Easter this year--she is even buying the turkey for me to make.

I got married 4 months ago and volunteered to have Thanksgiving for both of our parents and siblings this year. For my first ever family dinner I used this recipe and it was PERFECT! Flipping the turkey was a little difficult, but we got it... and the turkey was beautiful! Maybe I can have holidays at my house more often!

My go to turkey recipe for years!  I noticed when reading the reviews quite a few people stated this is salty or dry.  I have never had this problem.  Here's  a few tips...  To avoid a salty turkey,  you must use kosher salt, and the pan you brine the bird in has to be big so the bird is completely submerged in it and water can move around.  Do NOT use the brine water, dump it and rinse the turkey well.  If the bird was dry you probably stuffed it too much, this makes the inside take longer to cook therefore drying out the outside.  Only loosely stuff with the vegetables indicated in the recipe.  Another reason your bird is dry is the process of basting.  Every time you open the oven the temperature fluctuates and will eventually dry out your bird.   Don't touch it, just let it cook!  Dont stab the bird either, all the juices will run out.  I put a few of the vegetables under the bird and it doesn't stick to the pan during flipping.  Lastly if you live at a high elevation (6000 feet) I have to add 25 degrees to the temp and 20% more time.  It also depends on the size of the bird, I get giant turkeys that can take 6-8 hours to cook because of the elevation and size.  Best bet is to follow your birds package instructions, it will tell you how long by pound and then just do the math.

Wow!  it was SO juicy!  My husband kept asking over and over, are you sure it will not dry out?  It was so juicy, it literally fell apart.  I used  the butter and olive oil, combined.  I also used some sage & garlic cloves, as well as the baby carrots (didn't have to chop them!).  Wow, will do this recipe over and over and over.........best turkey I've ever had.  Then I used some of the juice to make my potatoes (which my in-laws raved over....thank you for those happy points with my in-laws!!!).

I don't want to take any points away from this recipe, but I read that a butterball turkey is already brined and you don't need to  brine it again or it will be too salty and doesn't absorb any extra moisture.  Someone confirm!

This recipe turned out fantastic.  So fantastic, in fact, that now my extended family said I get turkey duty each year!  The wine creates a beautiful aroma while cooking even after just a few minutes in the oven.  A couple tips on this recipe I found are: 1) for brining process - a canning pot is a good size for most turkeys and fits well in fridge.  2) Stuff turkey with breast side up, tie it closed or use turkey prongs, and THEN invert it to breast side down and pour wine over it at that point.  (The recipe has you putting breast side down too early in the process.)

I was nervous to host my husband's family for thanksgiving, and even more nervous to make a turkey for the first time. (Especially for a mother in law who is an amazing cook!). After dinner, I was informed that I made a terrible mistake, because I am now in charge of the turkey every year! Delicious! Fell right off the bone. 

I brined in an oven bag, paper towel dried the turkey and let it rest in the fridge a couple hours after rinsing to let the skin brown up. I used more veggies, and had surprising success flipping the bird(!) with oven mitts covered with ziplocks.  

Thank you for a great recipe.

I used this recipe this year and my turkey was AMAZING. It was literally perfect.. I added a couple things like fresh sage, parsley, rosemary and a quarter of an apple to the cavity. I did not flip it, because presentation didn't matter. Juiciest turkey I've ever had.

The best turkey ever, and it was my first time to cook one myself! I followed the advice on several hours in fridge after debrining step. I added fresh rosemary, sage with fresh thyme and doubled wine and veggies and three cloves minced garlic. I added some minced herbs to the butter to make an herbed butter and doubled this too. I used a pinot grigio I like to drink, but I'm no connosiuer. However, here's the kicker--my husband IS MR PICKY-...I have taught myself to cook (or am doing so) through this website/app BC of previous complaint s-, and HE IS A world traveled gourmand and he RAVED about it, and was so impressed!!!!I'm sure this recipe is five stars without a change. THANKS!!!!

First turkey i have ever made, best turkey i ever tasted.  Turning the turkey on time was key.  Made this at mother-in-laws, while turning turkey at the right time; the turkey "looked like a tv turkey". Later did the turkey at my mother's and turned it late, did not look as pretty. . . but tasted amazing.  Everyone said this was the best turkey they have ever had.  I was generous with butter and the wine and it seemed to work out well. However, turning the turkey sounds easy, was harder than I thought.  It took two of us. .  so good luck at that part.  Beautiful turkey.

I'm not sure why, but when I flipped the turkey ( which was very, very difficult to do), all the skin stuck.   I have mad many, many turkeys that turn out great.   I would suggest making this one WITHOUT flipping it!

We made this turkey last year for Thanksgiving, it is, hands down, the best turkey I've ever eaten.  We add the veggies to the stuffing and have great stuffing too.  We've made this turkey several more times and use whatever wine we have on hand; it's always great.  Each time we make this recipe we add more veggies and find more uses for them, flavor soup, rice, etc.  One note, be sure to rinse the turkey well after brining.

I haven't tried this recipe but am sure it is good. However, through years of cooking Turkeys I have found the easiest simple way to make a juicy Turkey without turning it upside down or brining. Instead of salting use Adolphs meat tenderizer. This makes an awsome Turkey and juicy every time. If it doesn't turn out juicy then you didn't use enough. To use the right amount think of it as salting so you don't over do it. I just make sure I put a fair amount all over Turkey. I butter first then meat tenderize, pepper, and poultry seasoning. Makes really good Turkey that has a great flavor that isn't over shadowed by some crazy flavoring.

am a novice, at least regarding holiday cooking. this recipe made my first turkey FANTABULOUS! I will not prepare a bird any other way.
great drippings made for divine gravy as well!
I used bacon grease instead of butter and would def use more veggies next time.

It was a lot of work and a bit salty. It was also a little dry. Don't think I will do this one again.

I had never roasted turkey before but I came across this recipe and followed all instructions as the recipe called for. My family and I LOVED THIS TURKEY! We even made soup from the leftovers and it was simply delicious. I see how important it is to brine the turkey so that it is very moist and flavorful. I will always brine before roasting now. Thank you for this recipe!

I am a terrible cook. I have tried cooking a turkey for 17 years, and it's never to my liking.  I tried this recipe.  The look was Beautiful!  The taste was just 'ok.'  I used a fresh (not frozen) turkey. The brining process was a big mess.  I used an oven bag, that ripped, so I had to transfer my brine & turkey into another pot.  When doing so, blood-soaked water splattered everywhere..... walls, countertops, blinds, window and husband that went running!  So, beware. The only thing that I loved about this turkey, was the fact that it kept it's moisture day-after-day when eating left-overs.  I will try it again next year.  Also:  I didn't have any issues when turning my turkey.  I turned it over at the 3 hour mark.

This was awesome! It was very moist and flavorful with some slight modifications.

An important tip on rinsing the bird before brining it: be sure to thoroughly remove the bladder (or whatever that organ is called on both sides of the backbone at the tail end) and all sinewy gunk from the cavity of the bird, I’ve never seen any recipe state such and whatever that organ is called, it will foul the taste of any cooked poultry.

My main changes were with the brine. I didn’t rub the turkey with kosher salt but rather I made a brine out of 2 gallons water, 1 cup Kosher salt, 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 1 sprig fresh rosemary, 1 sprig fresh sage, 2 bay leafs, 1 medium onion with peel & cut into quarters and 3 bruised garlic cloves. I used a large brining bag, had the breast at the bottom of the bag, which is very important. I placed the sealed brining bag into a large heavy duty oval roasting pan then placed all of that into a cooler that was large enough to hold the pan, surrounded the pan in the cooler with 5 pounds of ice cubes and I brined the bird overnight with the lid on the cooler. You MUST thoroughly rinse the bird under cold running water before roasting it.

Scrumptious!! I found the whole process easy and delicious. I didn't use wine though, instead I used organic chicken broth so I could make some gravy. This is my only way to cook turkey for years now and it never disappoints.

Made with only a full turkey breast.  Only had salted butter and it really does make the veggies and gravy too salty if you brine.  The turkey breast was very moist.  I had no problem flipping it and it didn't fall apart.  I'm pretty sure I used way too much salt too, about 3/4 cup for only a 4 pound breast.  Read reviews afterward and might consider adding sugar of some sort to the brine.  This was my first experience doing a brine and I'm now a big fan.  I used a pound of carrots and next time I will use more.  Aside from the turkey and the delicious gravy (although a bit salty but with undersalted mashed potatoes it worked out fine) the carrots were also big stars of the meal.

This recipe was incredible....I used the recipe almost exactly I added a bit more seasoning to the brine ( boiling in a pot with water, then cooling the water then draining and put in brine water). My mom said that it was the best turkey she had ever eaten!! Great Recipe! This is the only recipe i will follow for Turkey from now on!!

I had trouble with this recipe.  I mean the turkey was good, but more effort than it was worth.  Firstly, brining the turkey was too much effort. On thanksgiving I have NO extra space in my fridge to pre-soak a turkey so had to do it in a cooler with lots of ice.  Also cooking the bird breast side down on a rack made a not-so pretty turkey.  Finally, there was just not enough drippings to make a gravy.  I really had to add a lot of liquid to make enough gravy to go around.  I will be going back to the "Michigander" recipe.

Came out way too salty for our taste though quite moist. I followed the recipe. We decided we liked the bird cooked in a bag better.

The brining makes all the difference for super juicy turkey.  I used rosemary instead of thyme (just because I did not have any).
I loved my 7 year old niece's comment during dinner..."The turkey is good this year"!

This recipe was okay.  Ever tried to flip a 20 pound hot turkey half way through cooking?  I don't recommend it!  Besides the difficulty flipping and the scars it left on my beautiful bird, the recipe was okay.

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving this year and it was AMAZING! All my family members told me that I should make changes here and there but I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out PERFECT! I was nervous about flipping the bird and it was a lil tricky but with some help I did it and it was totally worth it.  It came out so juicy and tender. I will definitely use this recipe again! :-)

WOW!  This was our first time doing a brine on a turkey and it came out wonderful.  So simple.  The turkey was so moist.  I think this was the first time I have ever been at a Thanksgiving where there was no turkey left.  We also layered the back of the turkey with bacon strips before turning, then removed after.  Because, you know, everything's better with bacon!  Also, did a stuffing inside the bird, then added roasted potatoes around for presentation.  Yuuuuuummmmm...

The brining was kind of a pain, but well worth the effort.  Very moist turkey!  I got lots of compliments on it.

You really should double up on the wine and veggies.   And next year I'm going to tweak the brine recipe a little.  But as it stands, this was the best that I've had.

Will never use a different tky recipe! I hav e made this the passed 2 yrs. now and each time the bird is moist and delicious! This year, while I believed I was turning off the oven timer for the tukeys flip I recalculated and realized the bird needed another a hour before flipping and ended up turning off the oven. I didn't realize it until 45 minutes later and quickly turned the oven back on and STILL, it came out PERFECT! I just left it in for an extra 45 min.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving 2011, and was absolutely astonished.  I have always been proud of my turkey when served, and I was so pleased with this recipe that I can't see using any but this one.  The one problem I had was getting it to the table before my taste testers ate it up.  We truly, truly loved it.

It has been a few years since I have had to cook a turkey, so I was looking for cooking tips when I found this recipe. I was skeptical about turning the turkey during cooking time, but I was able to figure it out. The end result was very moist and flavorful. Everyone complimented the turkey. Truly, this was simple to prepare and much, much better than expected. I will be using this recipe in the future!

The only tricky part (for me) was the brining - I used a brining bag that didn't quite all the whole turkey to be covered.  I compensated by rotating the turkey in the brine to make sure all parts of the bird had some time to soak.  It still came out moist and delicious!

This is pretty darn awesome.  Everyone raved so I had to tell them the secret of cooking the turkey breast side down for 2/3 cooking time.  Brilliant!  Used a 14 lb. bird, and cooked at 325 for exactly 4 hours.  Perfection!

Never had such a wonderful turkey.  I used a "butterball" and still did the brine.  I also added some sugar to the brine.  Had great reviews by our guests. So moist and flavorful.  We used the drippings (strained) to make the gravy. It was so full of flavor.  I would do this again in a heartbeat.

This was my first time making this. I followed the instructions exactly and the turkey came out perfectly! I gave it only three stars cause in my opinion it was a lot of work and to be honest, the meat was not as moist as I was expecting it to be. I seem to have better results using a turkey bag. But the flavor of the veggies and the thyme were really good!

This was absolutely hands down the BEST turkey recipe. I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was so juicy. the gravy is to die for. I didn't need to make another gravy! I added 2 cups of wine instead and a lot more carrots (to the bottom of the roasting pan).  I also didn't brine the turkey as it was already done. I love the fact that both top and bottom were browned and had such a nice color. I will be doing my turkey using this recipe moving forward.

My turkey was still dry I find other brines that use sugar and longer brining times as well make a moist turkey. The flavor from the vegetables and butter and wine made a awesome gravy just very salty so may want to add some water before you make it

THAT was the best turkey I ever made.  I didn't have the time for the overnight salting, but I did get a few hours in there.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the white wine (I didn't have any) and I used a turkey roaster set at 325 (the temp on the turkey package.)  My turkey was moist and falling off the bone.  Fantastic recipe!  Thank you Shelly for my first successful turkey!

I've used this recipe twice with fantastic results. Didn't have room in the fridge so I used a cooler! Also, I mixed in some herbs/seasoning to my butter & rubbed the turkey all over with it, even between the skin & meat. You're turkey comes out juicy & amazing.

I've made this twice now and both times the turkey has come out delicious.
The first time I followed the recipe. 2nd time, I used chicken bouillon in the brine and I didn't add any butter to the turkey. I also accidently overcooked the turkey, but it still came out tasty and juicy! Got so many compliments on it.
Def going to be making this once again on Christmas :)

This recipe is Great!!  My first big bird that I've ever cooked, and with this recipe it came out perfect. The whole family enjoyed it.  Truly worthy of going into my recipe box for many moons to come.

I've been doing this recipe for years and it still remains the favorite of the family.  The bird browns evenly and looks picture perfect as well as being the most flavorful, moist turkey we have done.  Love it.

I have brined my bird for years...the first time I did this, I was trying to salvage a pastdue frozen turkry that I thought surely was past it's prime (frozen for two years). It was so good !!! I made this my ritual when making a turkey or a whole chicken. I always brine in a salt and sweet mixture, using whatever I have onhand at the time. Honey, pancake syrup, brown sugar, white sugar along with just plain table salt that is well dissolved in water. Mix and match what you like. You will not regret doing this. I always use a cooking bag for my roasting endeavers.

I've cooked our family's turkey for the last 3 years using this recipe. I've gotten RAVES for the flavor and how incredibly juicy the (usually), dry white meat stays. All due to cooking the bird upside down for 2/3 of the time. Do yourself a favor, try this recipe for this coming Thanksgiving.  You'll say it's the best turkey EVER!

Since I only needed to make supper for two, I used a small chicken for this recipe. I subbed chicken broth for wine and left out the veggies as I was throwing them in another recipe. Chicken turned out amazingly moist and flavorful.

The name says it all, perfect! The only thing I did differently was added garlic powder to the outside of the turkey once I brushed it with butter. I will be using this recipe for Thanksgiving! Endless compliments on the meal!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it had a really good taste to it. I was always taught to cook turkey breast side up, and therefore figured that maybe breast down was the key to success.  I did exactly as this recipe called for and this was no juicier than any other time i cook turkey.  So either i'm already cooking my turkey properly or i did something wrong without realizing it. very tasty either way.. good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Came out perfectly moist and melt-in-your-mouth tender. The night before brining really helps seal in the juiciness and adds to the flavor. Will definitely make again using these techniques.

This was a great recipe from start to finish.  I took what a few other reviews stated and went with that.  The turkey was moist and succulent and my dh who really doesn't like turkey loved it.    Here's what I did: I brined my turkey in an oven bag in a cooler for 12 hours.  Rested it in the fridge overnight.  Baked it breast side down for 2 hours, flipped it over and baked for an add'l 1.5 hrs. (12 # bird).  To flip it I put on oven mitts and then plastic bags over them.  I basted every 30 minutes and seasoned the skin with pepper (no salt due to the brine).  Much easier than I expected it to be.  Also I only stuffed it with celery, garlic, and onions.  I don't think you can mess this one up!  I used chicken broth instead of wine for the bottom of the roasting pan.  The gravy turned out delicious!

This was a great, easy to follow recipe. The turkey came out very very moist, and was well received. A simple tip regarding the roasting-- if you don't have a rack, simply make one-- roll up aluminum foil into equal sized balls to fill up your roasting pan. Then place your turkey on top of that. The bottom of your turkey will then be able to roast as well!

This was my first Thanksgiving turkey and it came out great! My boyfriend raved all night. I will definitely use this recipe next year. Best of all it was naturally gluten free! The only thing I would do different is no veggies: they came out a bit oily in the bottom of the pan.

I am 19, I just got married May of this year and this is of course, my first Thanksgiving. Because my husband had to work, we could not travel home to eat at grandma's house this year, so our immediate family decided to come celebrate at our house. As you can guess, the pressure was all on me, and I had never made a turkey, or even a mean for 10 people before. I rushed to this website, found this recipe and decided to go with it.  It was a huge hit! My dad even told my grandma it was better than hers! Haha! The only thing I changed about this recipe was I used cooking wine (I can't buy the real stuff!) and I did not use the celery and carrots. Instead, I just stuffed one large, chopped sweet onion inside and scattered the rest around and used 3 bay leaves inside. I also used 3 sprigs on thyme inside and scattered a few around the turkey.  It was a reddish-brown when done and it was so moist and had so much taste! I am so glad that I used this recipe, and thanks for making my very first Thanksgiving a huge hit!

My Goodness, I never encountered a more simple and amazingly delicious recipe.  The turkey recipe from step one to the last step produced thee PERFECT turkey.  I added more seasoning to mine.  Before baking, I did allow the turkey to sit in the fridge uncovered (after the brine was rinsed off) for three hours so the skin will crisp up nicely -- which it did.  I buttered turkey with melted butter mixed with rosemary and thyme.  Sprinkled black pepper and garlic powder all over.  This was requested for christmas as well :).  Don't waste time finding another turkey recipe, this will make your thanksgiving perfect everytime.  ENJOY!

Yesterday was the first time I have ever cooked a turkey. I was so nervous, but it turned out to be one of the best turkeys I have ever had. I had a 26 lb bird (I had to feed quite a few people!) and I brined it with two cups of salt and two cups of brown sugar. It soaked for about 8 or 9 hours. I let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours and then put on the "Herb Turkey Rub" and let it sit in the fridge overnight.   I cooked the turkey breast down at 325 degrees and it took about 6 hours. About four hours in, we flipped the bird over and covered it with foil. I took it out when the internal temp was 165 degrees. The turkey sat on the stove, covered for about an hour. When it was time to eat, the bird was still hot and perfectly cooked! Moist, flavorful, absolutely amazing!

This was one of the best turkeys we've made.  I didn't have as big of turkey but it still worked.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients just estimated and it was all fine....I skipped the bay leaf and put in rosemary instead.  Moist!  The only hard part was figuring out how to turn that bad boy!

I have made this turkey for 3 years, and let me tell you everyone in my family loves it! It really is the  juiciest, and best turkey that I have ever had! The juices from the turkey make an excellent gravy also.

Absolutley perfect!  Turkey was nice and moist.  It didn't get a crispy skin (I am sure due to cooking the bird upside down at first.) but  I really shouldn't be eating the skin anyway ;)  WIll be making this turkey for every holiday!!!!  Thanks!

This turkey just fell off the bone, making it much easier to carve. It was so flavorful! And I used the stock as a base for a vegetable soup that we have savored for weeks. I totally recommend this recipe unchanged.

To all the brining skeptic: Be  not afraid!  Brining is the key to a perfect bird. I agree with other reviewers, the amount of veggies/broth can be adjusted to what you have on hand and to your personal taste. The bird will still turn out beautifully! Good luck and Happy Holidays ~!~

I'm not a turkey lover but this turkey came out juicy and tender and sooo flavorful! I added a seasoning salt rub and put potatoes into bake with the turkey. My husband said this was his favorite turkey he'd ever had. This is now my go to Turkey recipe!

GREAT flavor and very moist!  I stuffed the cavity with oranges, lemons, onions and herbs.  I will cut back a little on the lemon next time - it overpowered my gravy!

I was nervous to try this for my first Thanksgiving dinner and after using this recipe I will always make a turkey this way.  Amazing how moist it really is!  I did alter a couple of things I was concerned because my turkey had 6% saline injection so I used half water and half apple cider to soak in, I boiled water with some of the fresh herbs added cloves let it cool.  My turkey was too big to turn so I opted not to and no difference it was still very moist. I put a couple slices of salt free butter under the skin on the breast. Also added fresh cranberries, apple slices and sweet potatoes to stuff it and on the outside added mushrooms - MMM this was amazing!

Wonderful recipe!  Although it wasn't as moist as everyone said it would be and I followed the recipe exactly.  Oh well, I suppose that's just how turkey goes.  But I must say, it didn't matter because the drippings made the most amazing gravy ever!  I kept eating more and more turkey just to have the gravy poured on it.  This is certainly a keeper, I hardly had any left-over turkey this year!

For the first time in my families Thanksgivings, I was the one to make the Turkey. This was an excellent recipe. I was nervous on how it would come out, since I had never made a turkey before. I got rave reviews! Everyone has now dubbed me the Turkey cooker for the holidays. My husband even told me that he usually has to have lots of gravy, because of dry turkey, but he could gobble this down without a bit of it! The only variation I made was using a flavor injector. I simply used the juices from the pan (I cooked it in an electric turkey roaster as opposed to the oven) and re-injected them into the turkey. Absolutely wonderful!

This was my first turkey ever-- a 19lb bird!! I was skeptical at first about the salt-water over-night soaking, but the end result convinced me! It was so moist and tender. Everybody was so impressed. The only thing I did different was the stuffing: I added bread stuffing to all the veggies. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful!...I made just a few slight changes...I had to fry/steam my veggies a bit in the end, as the carrots didn't cook all the way through in the turkey...I will par boil the carrots next time.  I also added a little more of all the veggies and put everything inside the turkey (instead of some inside ands some outside)...didn't want the veggies to be to salty...also I suggest adding water and extra thyme to the wine in the pan...makes for an amazing gravy...excellant recipe... a definate keeper!

I don't eat any kind of poultry but this was a BIG success. The most frequent comments were about how moist the turkey was. I always thought that cooking it in a "turkey bag" would result in  a moist, enjoyable turkey. No comparison, according to my guests!

Definitely very moist and super juicy! The white meat was gobbled up before the dark! My family really enjoyed this recipe, I WILL be making this again.  After seeing the comments about adding more vegetables, I threw in some squash, garlic, and potatoes. Interestingly enough, my baby carrots didn't cook through! The veggies inside my bird were still quite crisp as well.  Next time, I'll double the veggies and add a little more flavor!

This turkey recipe was the BEST!   Since we have such a big family we made 6 turkeys.  So as you would imagine, I was able to tweak the recipe a bit.  We soaked ours in the brine for 2 nights, skipped the veggies inside; all except for the onion.  We kept that.  I also added a few extra bay leaves, and used a heaping teaspoon of dried thyme.  We needed a little extra gravy so we used 2 cups of wine for the last 2 turkeys.   Plus I turned it over at the half way mark, it was easier; then I took a stick of butter and melted it over the whole turkey that was exposed.  I couldn't believe that we cooked the whole thing uncovered, but it was a perfect golden brown.  This is definitely going to be the recipe for out family, we all LOVED it!

Excellent!!!!!  Made for Turkey Day and it was moist and wonderful.  Very easy to make.  I put the brine pot with the turkey soaking in the garage overnight.  The temperature here was low enough for it.  Turned out delicious, not salty at all as I was anticipating.  This is my new Thanksgiving turkey recipe.  Thank you!!!!!

Very good recipe!!!  I used it for this Thanksgiving and was told by my 70 year old father in law it was the best turkey he's ever had!  I did do a few things different though.  I added brown sugar to the brine to even out the salt and added rosemary to the brine as well.  DO NOT PUT THE BRINE AND TURKEY IN A TURKEY ROASTING BAG!!! bad idea, let's just say I had brine all over me and my kitchen the morning of Thanksgiving :)  Also I stuffed my turkey with apples and cranberries and it gave it a sweet taste.  Also rubbed the turkey with softened butter mixed with frest thyme!!  Other wise did everything the same.  Used the wine ect and placed it on the breast side while cooking it!!  Great turkey!!!

This is the only turkey recipe I'll ever use again. Even though I overcooked my turkey, as I generally do with most meat, it was tender and extremely delicious. I used half a bottle of chardonnay, drank the other half. After I flipped the bird (get it?), I sprinkled the breast with garlic salt after basting. Leftover turkey still tender after 4 days in fridge. Thank you and your French friend for this recipe.

We forgot to rinse the turkey, but it didn't seem to matter. Very good.

Cooked this for Thanksgiving with a bigger bird (23 pounds) and it was amazing - the moistest turkey anyone had ever had.  People called the next day to ask if there were any leftovers.  I'd never "brined" before and I was a little worried, but it was easy and came out flawless.  Highly recommended.

I made a Thanksgiving turkey for the first time this year and after reading the reviews I chose this one.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I used other reviewer's ideas and stuffed it with apples and used twice the wine.  It was falling off of the bones.  Plus, my husband liked it and he does not like turkey because it's usually dry.  Now I will make this turkey every year.

This recipe is AMAZING.  I added some garlic herb butter under the skin and cooked the first 30 minutes at 500 degrees.  Then I dropped the temperature down to 350 until the thermometer read 165.  The turkey was flavorful and so juicy, and the gravy was to die for.  I have found my go to recipe for turkey.

This was only the 2nd time I had baked a whole turkey.  I used a brined turkey from Trader Joe's and skipped the brining steps.  I used a turkey injector and injected a total of 6 tbl of melted butter into the breast area (next time I will add a bit of seasoning salt).  Some oozed out, so I smeared it over the skin.  I followed the rest of the recipe, except I baked it breast side up and covered it loosely in foil.  I did not turn it (I couldn't imagine turning a 20+ lb turkey).  It browned beautifully and was extremely juicy.  I used a turkey timer (you plug it into the breast and it pop-ups when it hits 180 degrees).  It took about 3 1/2 hours.  I will definitely use this again.  I don't know if the vegs in the roasting pan were necessary, and it was a mess to clean up.  Next time I will definitely line the pan with foil and might omit the extra vegs.  Oh, and the wine I used was a 2007 Kenwood Chardonnay.  It had been recommended to pair with turkey in our local paper's wine column.  It was a very nice Chard and value priced.

I BRINED A BUTTERBALL TURKEY - it was too late to turn back because I had not read all of the reviews about brining a BB turkey. I am sooooo glad that I did it.  Now I did not use the brining ingredients in this recipe because I had already purchased a brining kit (with a bag) at the grocery store and used that, but I did follow the rest of this recipe. I did stuff it, but the stuffing came out so wet that it was almost unservable until my husband said to mix it in the the extra batch that always goes in the oven and Wow, that made the stuffing even better too.  I did do the upside down thing and it was not fun turning a 22 pound stuffed hot turkey, but we managed and in the end, it turned out to be the best turkey any of us have ever had.  No one could get over how moist and flavorful it was.  The brine kit that I used was from Fire & Flavor and they do have a website  FIREANDFLAVOR.COM.  It was not too salty and I will never do a turkey again without brining it. Perfect turkey is right!!!

OMG!!!  This IS the perfect Turkey.  I'm a Ham person at Thanksgiving not a turkey person, but now, after making this turkey, I'm a turkey person.  I have NEVER tasted turkey like this.  It is not that the other turkey's were dry it's that they were so so bland.  I would always have to add salt or dressing to make the turkey taste good.  This "Perfect Turkey" is just that, perfect!!  You don't need to add anything to this turkey to eat it.  It was moist and tasty. Everyone at Thanksgiving raved about the taste.  Unbelievable.  I've only made two turkeys in my whole life and I am floored by how good this is.  The kicker is I used the left over Turkey to make soup and I didn't need to add anything but water.  The Turkey had so much flavor I made Perfect Turkey Soup with it.

I made this for Thanksgiving -- my first turkey.  I had nightmares for weeks beforehand too.  Every one of my guests raved about how moist and flavorful it was.  The only thing I did different was I did not use a rack and did use an injector tip on my baster to inject the breasts with basting, and I used extra butter.  I didn't have time to let the turkey dry so the skin wasn't very crispy, but it was still amazing.  I used a ton of vegetables and the gravy turned out absolutely wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe -- looks like it's going to be my tradition to have Thanksgiving from now on!

P.S. I had a Butterball, I brined it, and it did not turn out too salty, or salty at all.  I saw a review saying not to brine a butterball... I didn't see this til after but had no problems at all.

This turkey was beautiful and moist, but I gave the recipe only 4 stars, because the salty taste was overwhelming in the turkey and gravy (and I love salt).  I cooked a 14-lb. turkey (which is no doubt the reason for the salt issue) and brined it in a 5-gallon bucket overnight.  Realizing my turkey was smaller than that called for in the recipe, I put as much water into the brine as I could. I might give this another chance, but even if I cook a much larger turkey, I'll definitely cut back on the salt.

If you have a frozen basted turkey, or a kosher turkey, yes, you should skip the brining step. You'll still get great results from cooking it upside down for most of the cooking time. I actually turn mine twice - 1/3 of the time with one thigh up, 1/3 with the other one up, 1/3 with the breast up. Silicone oven mitts are good for turning it over - be sure to have a helper hold the pan and rack.
I make some extra stock to use in the stuffing and gravy by cooking the neck and wings, with a few herbs and vegetables, in a pot on the stove.

This really is a perfect turkey!  I made this last Thanksgiving.  It was the first turkey I have ever made and it turned out wonderful!  I may have used more vegetables and I definitely tucked some thyme sprigs and pat of butter underneath the skin.  It was the best turkey I have ever eaten.  Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I did a couple things different.  I skipped the wine and added some apple cores in the body.  I made little slices in the skin and put some butter pats inside the skin as well as all over. I used a cooking bag to keep it moist.

This is the first time I brined a turkey and it's true as the other reviews have stated - It's SO juicy and moist.  As you are carving it, it looks very juicy.  I will always brine a turkey.  I did add sugar as others have stated.  Thanks!  This is the PERFECT TURKEY.

This is AWESOME! I hate making turkey because its so much work, and it doesn't always turn out. HOORAY! This was just perfect. I thought turning the bird 2/3ds thru would be difficult but it wasn't at all.
A hint: Brining is Key. I didn't have a big enough stock pot to cover the Turkey with H20. So I put it in an oven bag, stuck it in a box and then filled the bag with enough water to cover the bird, and stuck it in the fridge. I had to remove a couple shelves to fit it in. When using an oven bag for brining make sure you double bag it. i haven't had one fail, but you never know. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. My family and I are happy we'll never eat another dried out bird again!

This is a great way to cook turkey!  We added some garlic, basil and parsley overnight with the water and salt.  We also just put a cut onion in the turkey and one in the roasting pan no other veggies.  To the white wine, we added some chicken stock to keep it moist in the oven from the start.  I will defiantly cook our turkey like this from now on.
Thank you!

The turkey was tender and moist, but what really stood out was the gravy.  It needed no seasoning and was excellent. My husband's aunt always handles the gravy and she was amazed at the rich color and delicious flavor. (I put stuffing in the bird, rebel that I am, and it was wonderful, also.)

I read somewhere that you shouldn't brine turkeys which have been injected with seasonings, salt solutions, etc. I didn't want a bird that was terribly salty so looked everywhere for an "unenhanced" turkey.  Does anyone have experience with brining an injected turkey?

A moist, tender turkey that brings raves from my family. Here's a gravy tip: Even after a thorough rinsing, a brined turkey still releases salty juices, so when you're making gravy, use salt-free chicken or turkey broth along with the pan juices (which develop a rich, deep brown color). Once thickened with roux, the gravy should need no extra salt.

I want to let everyone know that all of the dishes that I made for Thanksgiving came from allrecipes, and that everything turned out perfect! I've been married for awhile now and my husband rates it the best meal ever!
My dishes were Perfect Turkey, Vegetable Dip, Whipped Sweet Potato Casserole, Waldorf Salad, Watergate Salad, Bread and Celery Stuffing, Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes, and No Bake Craneberry Sauce Pie.
I made gravy with the drippings and the veggies, generally my gravy is nothing special or even good. The gravy was Perfect-for lack of a better word.
The Turkey was the best ever, not the least bit dried out, and not at all too salty. You must try Turkey this way, you'll love it. We will never do turkey any other way. Thanks Allrecipes for helping me create my best Thanksgiving ever. Sue

omg. just finished our dinner and it was just like the recipe says. PERFECT TURKEY. I did use my own vegetable broth for the brine and did not give it a salt rub down. Just cooked my own veggies and spices with kosher salt, cooled it down and put my beautiful 25lb turkey in a brining bag overnight in a cooler and then followed the recipe. It was hard to stop eating this. PERFECT! oh, easy on salting, the bird had already had a salt water bath so no extra is required.

Awesome recipe that worked like a charm!  This was my first attempt at cooking a turkey and I'll continue using this recipe! Very simple, and the vegetables in the pan were delicious.  Next time I'll have to add more for sure!

Brining the turkey really does make a huge difference in the moisture level of the bird.  Wonderful basic turkey recipe.  I highly recommend.

I was nervous about cooking my first turkey this was easy! I added both sage and thyme to the brine and made sure to rinse very well before cooking. I stuffed with homemade stuffing, the gravy turned out wonderful. Everyone raved about the moistness, this recipe is a keeper.

My husband wanted to do the turkey this year and I found this recipe so I gave it to him to try. The turkey was excellent!! We will always brine our turkey now. The vegetables cooked up to nothing though because he cut them too small (I told him he was cutting them too small but he didn't listen! haha) and they weren't really edible. I recommend cutting large chunks so you can eat the ones on the bottom of the pan as they are swimming in the yummy juices!!

The turkey came out so tender and juicy.  Even the leftovers were tender and juicy.  I've never had turkey leftovers as good as I did with this recipe.  I will never cook a turkey any other way again.

OK...this was my first Turkey ever (I usually just do a breast).  It was good...it was WAY juicy...I did the whole brine thing and even added some spices and brown sugar to the brine, but the downfall was...it tasted too "gamey".  The veggies were great though.  My husband liked it, but me and the kids were turned off by the flavor.  I'm glad I did it...it made a great picture, but I think next year, I will go back to doing the breast only.

I used this recipe as a guideline, stuffing my 14-lb. bird with celery, apples, onion, carrot,fresh herbs, and lemon wedges. I skipped the white wine, and roasted the bird in an electric roaster for just under three hours-it was moist, juicy, and delicious. One drawback of the roaster-the skin did not stay very crispy.

I made this yesterday and it came out great. Very moist and flavorful. Worth the work!My husband raved, which he never does about roast turkey. It's very close to the recipe from The Perfect Recipe, but with a couple of shortcuts. i made the gravy from the Perfect Recipe and it all came together great. Thanks.

This was my first time cooking a turkey. I used this recipe at the last minute when I realized that I had to figure out how to cook a turkey after it was brined. I used the Turkey Brine recipe from this site and modified this recipe for my needs. I buttered the turkey, stuffed with veggies and used 1 cup of white wine per the recipe. I followed all the other cooking instructions and the turkey came out beautifully and tasted wonderful. I will use this recipe again for turkey.

It didn't taste any different then a turkey cooked in a oven bag. Wasn't dry but wasn't as juicy as expected either. 
The hassle of brining the turkey the night before for me was no different in taste.

The best turkey ever. I cooked it last year and going to do it again. The only change I am going to make is adding more vegitables, they are sooooooooo yammy.

I loved this turkey. My whole family did. We ate it for Thanksgiving last year. The only problem I had was turning the turkey back over because it was so tender it was falling apart. I just finished cooking it upside down. Thanks.

Made this turkey today for my family Thanksgiving.  I only made an 11 pound turkey - 2 hours at 350 (couldn't believe how quickly it was done!) - and it was tender and flavorful.  Didn't even use the wine, only chicken broth in the bottom of the pan.  I think that brining always makes a huge difference.  Probably the juciest turkey breast I have ever had.

Juiciest turkey that I’ve ever made! I tented with foil for the first 2/3 of the time and then cooked uncovered after flipping. I used the tip someone else posted about putting on oven mitts and then covering with plastic storage bags to hold the turkey to flip it. I turned the bags inside out so that any juices where on the inside, then we were able to use those bags to store leftovers instead of waste them.

AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as written and placed the turkey in an oven bag. The only change was that I added a few garlic cloves along with the celery and onions and spices. The turkey was so moist and flavorful. Everyone loved it. I'll make turkey this way over and over for Thanksgiving!

Best Turkey ever!  I am ancient so I have fixed a few turkeys in my life time, this was by far the best.  I tweeked it to suit me, there are only two of us in our household our children are all over the country.  I used a 12 pounder and I "dry" brined it two days before, using 3 Tbs Kosher salt mixed with parsley, sage and thyme, salt and white pepper 1/2 teas. each. Distribute inside the bird and under the skin of the breast and legs as much as you can without breaking the skin (use a wooden spoon handle) I have broken the skin once or twice but I just sew it up! Cover the bird with a sheet of parchment paper and then cover with a clean tea towel, refrigerate for two days if you can or one if you're short on time.  This method was much easier for me to do and to handle.  
I gave this a 5 star because the brining method wet or dry delivers about the same results, it's just a simpler method for an old lady.  Everything else I followed the instructions as printed, probably used about two cups of wine, oh....I did cut two shallots in half and added them to the veggies.

I have made this turkey for 2 years and am going to make it again this year.  I brine the turkey in a drink cooler like you would see at sporting events.  This way when I'm done, I can even push the button and drain the brine out of the spout.  I usually put a little ice in the cooler and set it in the garage overnight (live in NC)

I use a different Brinning recipe found in all recipes, but outside of that I follow this exactly. Have a little more white wine on hand to add when you flip the turkey 2/3 of the way through cooking. Also, clarify your butter before basting if you want that perfect golden brown and crisp. If you don’t clarify your butter the milk solids will run. Turning an 18 pound bird can be tricky when trying to use traditional kitchen instruments. I recommend that you use waterproof grill gloves, they go for about $20 on amazon. When it comes time to turn the turkey you can get both hands on it, it makes it incredibly simple. Internal breast temperature should be 165, I pull the bird at about 162 or 163 and make a aluminum foil tent over it while it’s resting. This keeps it moist and the internal temperature will continue to rise to 165. I use all those veggies and white wine in the roasting pan and put the roasting pan right on the oven top and make the simple turkey gravy recipe found in all recipes while the turkey is resting. It finishes right when the turkey is done. Pour the gravy through a wide mesh strainer to get the veggies and thyme springs out. Happy Thanksgiving.

I bought a small turkey, about 13 pounds, and it was easy to brine in plastic bag in bucket in fridge. I reduced the salt accordingly but did not reduce other ingredient quantities.  Very delicious!!  For gravy, I added white wine and corn starch to pan drippings, after pouring off all the fat, and pureed everything with the oven roasted veggies. Really good!!

Made this for Christmas dinner and the family was impressed. My husband is a midwest guy who loves stuff like fried turkey or real hearty food, and doesn't like wine. But he loved this turkey. Very most, easy, no continual basting needed. I followed the recipe exactly except I had a 10lb turkey and used a roasting oven. Will use this recipe again. The drippings were wonderful for flavorful gravy and the vegetables left in the roaster were delicious too! It smelled heavenly as well!

This is my never-fail go-to turkey recipe! In the past eight years I have made it at least six times and the other times a turkey was cooked using a different recipe it was flat out disappointing. And the gravy that it makes is heavenly!

Easiest turkey recipe ever!  We usually smoke turkeys on our Traeger but it was out of commission this year.  I looked at several recipes and this one caught my eye due to the fact it is roasted breast-side down for 2/3 of the time.  Everyone was pleased with how delicious and moist it was.  I made my gravy the day before and added some of the pan drippings before serving.  Big hit!!

I have to say I was a little hesitant on this because in years past the brine recipe I used had a lot of spices and fruits where this just had the salt. But it turned out very moist and flavorful. I didn't make any changes.

This was just perfect. The only change I made was to add 2 cups of wine instead of just one. I did everything else exactly as the recipe called for, and it was perfect. As others have suggested, I also brined mine in an oven bag in an ice chest, because the refrigerator was too full to accommodate a huge stock pot. After we were done, I put the entire carcass and all of the leftover veggies in a stock pot to create soup stock, and because of the veggies and seasoning, I actually already have a nearly completed soup without any additional work. I'm just going to add some of the leftover turkey and some rice. This recipe really was foolproof (it was my first turkey), and all of my friends loved it. I will make this every chance I get to host a big dinner.

Live out in Brussels now and this was my first time making a Turkey by myself.   This recipe was great. Cooking it upside down for 2/3s of the time kept the meat moist and flavorful!

This is the perfect roasting recipe. I followed an Alton Brown trick and put my frozen turkey covered in the brine in a pot on the counter overnight. As long as the internal water temperature stays below 40degrees the turkey will be safe from bacteria. The frozen turkey serves as an ice cube to keep the water cool. Very helpful for those with frozen turkeys on the day before thanksgiving.

This is the third year I've  made this recipe.  This year I used a Honeysuckle turkey with 7% solution injected. It still was not salty. I used the full 2 cups of kosher salt. I brined it overnight, and rinsed it thoroughly, and let it sit in the refrigerator for two hours to tighten the skin. It turned out beautifully again, not salty, and very juicy.  Don't be afraid of using turkeys with solution injections. And I flipped the turkey, as prescribed. But I did not put vegetables inside the turkey. I put all the vegetables in the bottom of the pan, and added twice the carrots as others recommended.  I also microwaved thm 4 minutes before putting them in the pan, as someone recommended. They came out great as a side dish.

I only did the brine soak , then stuffed it with an herb stuffing , basted it with the butter and a bit of white wine , followed the cooking instructions as directed . This is the best turkey ever ! I've made all my turkeys like this for the last 3 years.

Never brined before.  It was so simple and I will never make a turkey any other way.  Everyone loved this recipe.  It was so tender it fell off the bones.  There was zero need to carve because it was so tender.  Someone else said you couldn't stuff this turkey. Not true.  I stuffed my turkey following standard stuffing recipes and still turned out fantastic.

I made this Saturday for my family Thanksgiving.  It was terrific and so easy to do, rather than all that fussing.  This was so simple, very tasty and the turkey was so moist.  It was one of the best I ever made.  Thank you for sharing.

I have used this recipe several times and it never fails. I always serve a moist, flavor packed bird that gets raves and is talked about for weeks afterward. I may use more than one bay leaf and more butter depending on the size of the bird. This recipe is a must try.

So this was my first time cooking a turkey and I thought I was going a bit to far with this recipe (the brine process can be a bit tricky), but the effort was well worth it.  I used a brine bag and figure out a way to get it to fit in fridge.  I followed the recipe as it was written and the turkey was very moist and everyone really enjoyed it.  This is a great recipe!!!

Made this turkey recipe for Christmas lunch and it tasted amazing. My husband never liked turkey but he loved this one. I followed the recipe as is except I only brined it for about 5 to 6 hours. Also sprinkled a bit of poultry seasoning on it I used dried thyme seasoning instead as I didn't have fresh and I also used fresh savory instead which is similar in flavor to thyme. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for our Christmas dinner which we had this evening.  I was worried as I did not have the wine but Googled a substitute and used-strange ingredient though  white vinegar!
It was the best oven roasted turkey I have ever had and you never notice the vinegar.  Oven baked in a foil pan covered with foil until the last hour.  Made lots of broth.  This is a winner!

It was our first time hosting Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit!!! Thanks to this recipe...everyone liked the moistness of the turkey. I used vegetable broth, sea salt, dried sage, dried thyme and dried rosemary for brine and followed the steps. 
It was great!!! Highly recommended!!!

What I usually do for the brine mixture is I take a bucket and clean it out, and then fill t with all the stuff I'm going to use for the brine. Then I put the turkey inside, and since I live in Wisconsin it's usually cool by now so I put it outside and cover it overnight and take it out the next morning and cook it!

I made this turkey last year and family members 65 and older boasted it was the best turkey they had in their lives. Our 1 year old son was pounding on the table demanding more too. I neglected to tell them just how easy the recipe was as to look like a culinary genius. Invest in a good meat thermometer and the actual cooking is a breeze. We've started doing turkeys all year long thanks to this recipe. Trying the same recipe with duck this year! Happy holidays all!

My family of 20 ish loved it! My brother said it was probably one of the best turkey's he's had and his wife said she didn't know turkey could taste so good! My brother in law said I'm on turkey duty now.  The best part?! This is my first turkey I've ever made! :) FYI I skipped the thyme because I didn't have any. But did everything else to a tee. Very easy and very good!

I used this recipe ever since 2008 that I first started to make my own Turkey tradition.  The only thing I changed for this recipe is to add way more vegies.  They taste soooo good with all the juice at the bottom.

Extremely moist turkey!!! I brined it, rinsed it, patted it dry. I buttered the beast, then stuffed it with White Castle stuffing. I cooked it upside down which made every adult exclaim "what are you doing?!? I've never heard of such a thing!!". I tried to flip it 2/3 through cooking process and it fell apart a little- so I just let it cook upside down. It was a very juicy turkey!! The top didn't get crisp because I couldn't flip it, but no one seemed to mind. It's still the talk of the family a year later.

HOWEVER, waaaaaahhhhhh mine fell apart... Do you think it could have been because of it being cooked in a Oven Roaster by 'Oster'????

I used a fresh 12 pound Butterball Turkey. Used this recipe plus some suggestions from reviewers. I did equal parts salt and sugar (1 cup each).  I added garlic to the brine and also pepper.  I rinsed the turkey and let it dry in the fridge a few hours before baking.  
I included green apples to the stuffed veggies.  My mom uses the broth to make stuffing so cooked the turkey breast up and we completely wrapped the turkey to preserve the juice.  We also added sage and poultry seasoning and didn't use cooking wine.
The turkey was super juicy and everyone raved about it.  I think the brine is key to keeping the breast juicy.  I highly recommend the recipe.

Came out beautiful. Everyone said it was the best turkey they had ever eaten. It was gone by the next day. The only thing I would do differently the next time around would be putting some tin foil over the breast meat to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. It did that and tore the skin off the breast, so I put some tin foil over it to keep the moisture in, but next time I would put the tin foil over the breast at the very beginning.

It was "falling off the bone" tender and juicy...my family loved it!

Very tasty.  I brined the turkey overnight, drained then let it dry in the fridge for a few hours.  In addition to the herbs I added some fresh sage I had on hand.  I used a sauvingnon blanc wine and the gravy was much better than the "made ahead turkey gravy" recipe from this site.    Cooking time was 3.5-ish hours.

I have used many techniques over the last 30 years, but this was by far the best.  My family agreed who have had bagged, cheese clothed, etc.  Only addition I made was to add oil to the basting butter.  I also basted with the wonderful broth in the bottom of the roasting pan.  I did add more wine when I turned her over as veggies were exposed. This was a 13 lb Butterball which had been brimed (according to the wrapper).  I cooked for 3 1/2 hours, then let rest tented lightly with foil for 30 minutes. Now going to make turkey soup with the vegetable broth.  Have about 4 cups.

Everyone liked my turkey this year, however it was not as juicy as I expected it to be based on the other reviews. I followed the directions exactly, even flipping 2/3rds through. It was very good and I would make again, may try brining for 48 hours instead of 12 as Cooks Illustrated says that is the proper length for a turkey.

My husband is the cook in the house and was a bit unsure about me introducing this new turkey recipe. Let me tell you, it was just as the other reviewers said it would be, juicy and tasty! The whole family enjoyed it but the veggies around the turkey were covered in grease so they went to waste, uneaten, so I will do without them next time.

I got rave reviews for this turkey!  I didn't use any of the spices other than the kosher salt bath and it was still amazing and moist.  I couldn't taste the wine, but it was still great and I loved how the veggies in the cavity turned out.  I would make this one again for sure!

Great recipe! We will definitely be keeping this for future reference! It was the hit of thanksgiving dinner.

Next time we will use a cooler full of ice to brine the turkey, rather than the fridge. At first we put the turkey in two large garbage bags and added the brine but it wasn't very practical in the fridge. 

Thank you for the tastiest, juiciest and flavourful turkey recipe ever!

Great turkey recipe! This was my first turkey and it wasn't hard at all. I agree with some other reviewers... The turkey fell apart when it was time to flip it but it wasn't too big of a deal as the meat was juicy and delicious and I carved it before placing it in the table! The only change I made was to add extra wine to the sauce.. It made the BEST gravy!

This past year I had to have two back to back Thanksgiving dinners, with all of the fixings. I don't like to experiment when having company but the first dinner was very informal and included my son who is trying to eat healthier. This version, with the vegetables as stuffing seemed perfect and it was! So good, that I made it for the second dinner as well and it was a hit. I stuffed it with all kinds of vegetables - I added butter nut squash which was my favorite of all. Great Recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!

This turkey is amazing. It looks gorgeous and tastes like gourmet turkey if there is such a thing;) This Thanksgiving was the second time I made this turkey but last year I used water instead of wine. The wine is the secret ingredient to the "perfect"! The carrots that were in the wine didn't even make it to the table as they were picked over by the family before I could get them in the bowl. That says a lot as cooked carrots aren't usually battled over! I turned the sauce into a thickened the turkey/wine broth by adding a 1/2 cup of chicken broth with a bit of cornstarch. What a sauce! I will never use another turkey recipe again. By the way, I froze the leftover sauce and dumped it into my chicken and noodles that I made in mid December. My family raved over those also. I followed this recipe exactly this time and will do so from now on except I will put all the carrots in the bottom of the pan so they can cook in the wine. Enjoy!

I only brined the three hours due to lack of time (if you don't have a large enough stock pot, a cooler will work). This guide is fantastic!!! Before I put it in the oven I melted a stick of butter and poured it all over the bird. With about an hour left I flipped the bird, breast side up, and poured another stick of butter all over the bird. I basted about every twenty minutes. While the bird was resting, I poured the drippings in a pan, whisked in about a cup if flour, and a pinch of pepper ad sage. This was a huuuuge hit for Christmas!! We normally deep fry our turkeys but this was so, so juicy!!

The name says it all. This turkey eas juicy, moist and flavorful. I followed the directions exactly and couldn't be happier with the results. The suggestion of putting the turkey in an oven bag and placing in a cooler with ice worked great!

I never really bother to write a review, but this recipe is epic! I never made turkey before, followed the instruction and boom! A well roasted turkey! It's so easy, you just need to follow the instruction! All of my guest gave positive comments on my first-time turkey and they think it's juicy and taste really good. Thank you recipe!

This recipe is genius to cook the turkey upside down!  I used this recipe to cook my very first turkey and it turned out so moist and delicious, the family loved it!  Now, I used the other recipe on there 'Turkey Brine' for my brine, soaked it for 2 days in a cooler.  Then overall followed this recipe.  I didn't stuff anything inside the turkey after ready how you shouldn't eat it, but put the veggies and wine around the turkey.  The gravy was so declicious as well!  The leftovers stayed so tasty and juicy.  I do recommend this recipe!

I'm not a fan of brining the bird... yes it is juicey, but it I think it loses significant flavor. Best to learn how to get the temperature and time just right and use some techniques that keep the juices locked in like keeping a terry cloth soaked in butter on the bird until towards the end for crisping skin. Do remember that you have to constantly soak the cloth in butter so it doesn't dry out.

The turkey came out very juicy and the skin was crispy.  I only had a 13 lb turkey so I had to cut the time down to 3 hours before the internal thermometer popped and my real thermometer registered the right temp.  This was a huge hit with the family.  I also diced up a large pinata apple and added it to the carrot/celery/thyme mixture, which the kids really liked.

We substituted some of the butter with olive oil.  We stuffed it with Italian turkey sausage, cornbread stuffing, onion, celery, and carrots.

We make this turkey every year and our house has become the "come-to" house for Thanksgiving! My father has fallen in love with the turkey so much that every year he takes a picture of it =).  Would definitely recommend this recipes to anyone about to make their first turkey and is terrified of it!

Ok, so seriously, this recipe made the BEST gravy ever!!! Instead of onions, I used shallots. I too puréed the veggies and added back to the turkey drippings and let it simmer.  I also added about 1/3 cup flour and water. Everyone raved!! I had one guest attempt to eat the leftover with a spoon. Lol

I made this at Thanksgiving and will be making it again for Christmas Eve. I was looking through the turkey recipes on this website, debating on which one to try for this year. I decided on this one, and I'm glad I chose it. The turkey was so juicy and flavorful, much better than what I usually make for Thanksgiving. I usually make stuffing with celery and onions, so I used that as a substitute for just regular onions and celery. I highly recommend this recipe, and will be making it for years to come.

This Turkey was PERFECT just as its named. I did however make a few changes such as using a cooking bag which self bastes the Turkey. No flipping required. The turkey browned perfectly and there was not a dry piece of meat to be found. It was JUICY! My guests were gushing over it.

Excellent, cooked my first turkey this year and used this recipe. It came out perfect :)

I did stuff it with stuffing, not vegetables and I found a great brining recipe that I used to soak turkey in overnight. I did not rub salt onto turkey, I was afraid with all the brine that it would be too salty.

Great recipe i did everything  the recipe said.
1-Rub down with Kosher Salt,
2-Brinning process which I used an oven bag then added water and let sit for 12 hours in refrigerator once completed rinsed off salt and discarded oven bag
3-Then i seasoned with all list items and added extra stuff like raw ginger chopped medium sized for an extra spice and added chicken broth instead of wine like one of the reviews said.
4-Then rubbed it down with butter and placed in  pre-heated oven at 350 for 4 hours

I tell you everyone really enjoyed and i made gravy with excess drippings by adding a little flour and a little can 
chicken to stretch a little and that very good as well.I will use this again in the future indeed.

Made this recipe for my first time cooking a turkey and it was easy, idiot proof and DELISH! I did however, add some baby multi-colored potatoes to the pan with the left over veggies and everyone went crazy over them! I hosted my first thanksgiving and of course the one thing that you want to be the best, is the turkey. I had about 10ppl and made a 20lb turkey. I cooked it at the recipes 350 instead of the recommended 325 by 'Butterball' and turned it over after 3.5 hours, then cooked it for another 1.25 hours. When flipping it over, I could see the juices boiling under the skin....needless to say I was a bit excited. When it was done we let it sit for 20 min and carved it. It fell apart! (in a good way) It was tender, juicy, sweet for us sugar lovers but not too sweet for those with a salty preference. My mother-in-law even said it was delicious and she's not a fan of turkey. Needless to say, i WILL be making this again. Thank you, All Recipes! You made me look like a professional chef!

Can't imagine ever doing a turkey any other way... it's absolutely perfect. We did tweak it a bit: inspired by Martha Stewart's instructions, we mixed up a paste of butter, sage, rosemary & thyme and spread this into the space between the skin and the breast meat. The gravy was very salty when I made it with 100% drippings, so I doubled the quantity by adding equal parts water and pan drippings. The meat was perfectly tender, nicely flavored, succulent and moist. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This turkey was the best turkey I've tasted! Everyone loved it and wondered how I made it. I made sure to let them know about this recipe and this website.

Wonderful flavor, the buttery turkey satisfied everyone. My boyfriend (who hates turkey because of the dry texture) had several helpings, as did everyone. The gravy was divine. My picky boyfriend had two helpings of potatoes (another food he hates) just so he could have more gravy. I did add a few more cups of wine to the turkey a few hours before it was done and I made my own sage stuffing instead of stuffing with vegetables. Will definitely be making this every year now!

I am so glad I used this recipe for making my first Thanksgiving turkey. It turned out perfectly and there is no need to make any adjustments. Very simple and easy. Adding the wine on top of the turkey before roasting gives a great taste for the gravy. The tastiest gravy I have ever made came from this recipe. I made the gravy by putting in a bit of the potato water in the pan with the roasted carrots, onions, celery and juices. I put the pan on the stove burner over medium heat and whisked the mix while adding a little bit of flour at a time until it thickened up to make a gravy. Then I used a sieve to separate the cooked veggies from the gravy, and that was it! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Husband proclaimed this turkey to be part of the best meal I've cooked in our life!  I did mine in a roasting bag and also use Old Bay in the seasoning, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Excellent!!!!

Absoutely the best Turkey anyone at our Thanksgiving celebration ever had!!  Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter.  We added a little more wine and 2 sprigs in and out of the bird.  Brined it in a cooler overnight about 14 hours.  Actually turned the bird 2x, the last one to crisp the skin on the breast.  Won't ever cook a Turkey any other way!  This was an excellent find.  Thanks so much!

Wonderful turkey. I mostly used the ingredients for this recipe (minus the salt since I was brining with 2 cups of salt already) but not exactly the directions because I was brining the turkey using "Turkey Brine." With that said, the turkey was absolutely wonderful. Also, I did put the turkey breast side up. In addition, I used all of the room temperature butter on the turkey because I was cooking it in a brown paper bag and wouldn't be able to flip the bird. Last of all, I did let the bird rest for 30 minutes when I took it out of the oven. After the 30 minutes, I then opened the brown bag and the turkey was cooked to perfection.

This was by the far the juiciest turkey I have ever made! I think the white wine made all the difference,  however halfway through cooking time I added a little bit of chicken broth to the pan which also may have helped make it so moist. Great recipe!

This was my first time EVER making a turkey and it turned out amazingly!  Moist, flavorful, delicious!  One of the best turkeys I've ever had! Veggies didn't cook completely but that was a small price to pay for the deliciousness of the bird. :)

I loved this a lot. white meat was a bit dry. (could have been my fault). I got to say the drippings made for a good gravy and really kicked up the taste of the white meat so all and all thumbs up. Thanks a lot you made me and my family's Christmas .

WOW. This was by far the best turkey Ive ever ate. Even my mother, the Martha Stewart do-a-like, called me today and asked me how I made the Turkey on Thanksgiving. I dont typically like white meat but the white meat on this turkey was so juicy and soft, its all I wanted to eat. I highly recommend this recipe.

Amazing. I will make this from now on. I used all ingredients, plus added a granny smith apple.  Next time, I will add a little more water to the bottom of the pan for the drippings, the wine seemed to dry everything up.

The turkey came out great! Moist and flavorful. Instead of turning the turkey over while cooking, I turned it upside-down while it rested after cooking, for 20 min. I think I got the same effect, because it was so moist! Thanks for sharin!g!!!

I have been roasting turkeys for more than 50 years. I fixed the turkey using this recipe this year and this is it from now on! The seasoning is all through the entire bird, I added more white wine to the pan. The pan juices made the most delicious gravy and the vegetables were wonderful. I liked the fact that the enire turkey is golden brown

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth. Followed all of the other directions exactly as written. This is the only way I will cook my turkey from now on.

This recipe is awesome! I was able to make it at the first try. I used a smaller bird and deboned it before brining, and it's fully cooked before the timer is off at 3.5 hrs. It tastes awesome and the moist and all.

Excellent!    NOTE TO COOKS WHO LEFT NEGATIVE REVIEWS:  If you use a 'basted' turkey, you will likely get a very salty, possibly even inedible product...  which I'm betting is the reason for at least some of these negative reviews.  You should NOT brine a bird that's already been saturated with the salty 'basting' solution that the manufacturer injects and/or soaks these turkeys in.  Use a regular fresh or frozen (and properly thawed) bird, and you'll have excellent results!

Not nearly as juicy as I hoped. I didn't put the turkey breast side down-not sure if that had anything to do with it. I have made juicier turkeys in the past.

Kept the turkey moist, but it was really salty tasting.  Also, based on reviews, I thought a brined turkey would cook faster.  My my 23-pounder took over four hours to cook.

The BEST TURKEY EVER!  I did not change a thing.  For the first time everyone was so busy eating the MOIST breast meat, that they didn't even fight over the legs!  It wasn't as pretty as I like, but what it lacked in presentation was worth it for all the flavor!

This was worth all of the work involved!  We had a 20 lb. bird and it was brined in doubled turkey size oven bags.  This was a wonderfully moist turkey.  The white meat is definitley the best I have ever had!

OMG, this recipe was FANTASTIC!  I've done different brines before, always like to try something a bit new every year.  The turkey came out pretty good, I'd give it four stars (I've found better brines on this site) but the gravy that this particular recipe makes is UNBELIEVABLE!  Everyone said it was hands down the best turkey gravy they've ever had.  All I did was mix several cups with a few tablespoons of flour in a saucepan, and OMG, wow!    The only way we deviated was instead of bothering with turning the turkey and whatnot, we just used a turkey bag.   Used a 20lb turkey, it was done in a little under three hours.   I might add more ingredients to the brine next year, but other than that, I am keeping this recipe the same next year!  LOVED it!

This was awesome! We made this with a fresh Amish Turkey and instead of using the oven we used our roaster. It turned out absolutely amazing. My whole family was skeptical about trying this new way and was giving us a hard time but everyone loved it. I will always make our turkey this way. My husband actually wants to make another turkey just for us because there were no left overs.

Kind of a pain (buying a 5 gallon bucket and finding a refrigerator empty enough to hold the bird overnight), but it was worth it.  The meat was moist and flavorful (something not always easy to accomplish with a whole bird).  And, since the turkey is the star of the show, I guess it deserves to be pamphered :)

FABULOUS!!!  My family never complained about my turkey before, but this is the first time they all RAVED about it!  My unanimous agreement, this is the ONLY way I will prepare our turkey in the future.  The gravy from the pan drippings was outstanding.

Used this recipe and grilled the turkey based on the grilled recipe on this website.  BEST TURKEY WE EVER HAD!!!!  We've deep fried our turkey for the last few years and wanted to try something different this year.  Now, I don't think we will ever do it differently.  This was WAY better than the  deep fried turkey.  Juicy, tender, and delicious!!  We had three turkeys Thanksgiving Day: one deep fried, one traditional oven-cooked, and one grilled using this turkey recipe combined with the grilled turkey recipe.  Our turkey was by far the best!!!  Everyone raved about it.  I think it would have been just as good cooked in the oven, but the grill is nice because it allowes you to keep the oven free to cook appetizers and side dishes.  I think the key is the brining process.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers today!!

Freaking Amazing!! Moistest turkey ever! I will only cook it this way from here on out! I started brining at 8am the day before Thanksgiving, because I did it in a bag in a roasting pan. First I had the turkey breast down in the brine until late that night and then I turned it over so the other side would sit in the brine overnight. In the morning I took it out of the brine and rinsed it well. I then let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours until ready to go in the oven. The gravy was super as well. I made a giblet gravy with the pan drippings.   Just to note nothing was salty at all and I brined the turkey as stated in the recipe, and it browned up beautifully!

Oh my God. I can't believe how juicy and tender this turkey was! I asked my husband what was his favorite part of the dinner and he said the turkey... I can't remember the last time I ate a turkey that good. Without a knife in sight. Thanks for an awesome Thanksgiving Turkey!  This one is seriously a keeper. I'm going back now to get third's.  : )

First turkey ever, and I have to say I'm so pleased with the result. My family just loved it, and even after we were SO full, there was still some nibbling as the turkey was carved for leftovers.   Really flavorful and juicy... and relatively simple to make. Overall a relaxed Thanksgiving, and the turkey was definitely a highlight!!

What a great addition to anyones recipe box. I decided to try it to prove that turkey does not have to be tough, or pink to be moist. It was flavorful, and very juicy. Even the next day when I made sandwiches, and later that day made turkey fried rice, it remained moist and tasty. Thankyou!

This will be the third turkey we have cooked using this method, I cooked it for Easter last year and it was a huge hit. I am going to be Brineing it this year for 24 hours instead of over night. I love Cooking Turkey for guests because this recipe gets people talking about my great skills in the Kitchen

I used this recipe to cook with but used the other turkey brine recipe to brine turnkey.  My turkey cooked in exactly 3 hours on 350 with no covering of foil whatsoever.  Turkey was moist and great!  For my first bird, it was a winner!

I skipped steps #1-#2 the "Turkey Brine" recipe on this site- where I followed all instructions exactly (the savory used here is a MUST in any good brine).  Then, I followed #3 and #4 below. My only change- I substituted the wine marinate with 2 cups of apple juice. PERFECT turkey.

I followed Shelly's recipe and we had the best turkey we have ever had for Thanksgiving. It didnt fit in the fridge so I put it in a tote in the bathtub to let it soak in brine. I kept dumping ice in it to keep it cold. I did however use a oven bag because I like to make sure I get lots of flavorful juices for my gravy. It was perfection. Wow, thank you Shelly from all of us

This was the best turkey ever!! I have never really liked turkey much, but this was delicious! I didn't have a large enough pot for soaking the turkey, so I flipped it after several hours. Followed the recipe exactly other than that and LOVED it. This is the only way I'll make turkey from now on.

I was so worried that it would come out salty. I made sure to wash it really good after taking it out of the brine. I dried it and put it back in the fridge a few hours before I put in the oven. I was moist and full of flavor. I had a bunch of very honest picky eaters over and they loved it. This is the second turkey I have ever made and I think I will do this method from now on.

This was my first attempt at a whole turkey.  It turned out awesome and tasted just as good.  It wasn't dry, and it was easy to make.  Great directions and the house smelled wonderful when it was baking.  Will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  My family doesn't really like turkey but my 16 lb. turkey was pretty much gone after dinner! Everyone said it was tasty and moist! I do have to say that turning the turkey over while cooking was a little hard but I was able to accomplish it! Will do this again next Thanksgiving!

This was second time making a turkey and this time it came delicious!! I didn't have fresh thyme or a bay leaf. I sprinkled the  thyme in a bottle and some rosemary over the veggies before putting them in and around the turkey. I also used about double the veggies. I cooked it at 275 covered for about 6 hours and once it was done, I uncovered it and let it brown for about 45 minutes. This was the best turkey ever!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and like other reviewers I brined "Thomas" in a cooler on the back porch overnight.  My pro-ham, non-turkey eating family really enjoyed this recipe. It was very moist, tender and flavorful and I will be using this recipe every year from now on! Thanks so much for posting!

Fabulous!  The only thing I did different was I used an oven bag.  Everything else was the same. Even the breast was moist.  My family said I have to make the turkey from now on.

The best turkey I have ever eaten, and the only turkey I have made! I used "turkey brine" from this site and followed the rest of this recipe. I had a 21lb bird and brined it for 24hrs. I let it rest after a good rinse for 3hrs in the morning, then roasted it at 500degrees for 20min and lowered the temp to 350 for the rest of the roast. It was done sooner than expected, only 3 1/2 hrs into cooking. I will prepare for the bird to be done sooner next time, since I will be able to sleep longer!

This recipe did call for something additional... Couldn't quite put my tongue on it, but overall. This was an excellent recipe and I will definitely be sticking to this recipe for next year. Hope all of you had an excellent "Turkey Day".

This smelled great and was AWESOME!  We actually used all the veggies and drippings on the bottom of the pan and from inside the turkey cavity to make a turkey soup using the carcass and leftover bits.  Added some Cavatelli pasta and it made a perfect hearty soup - with a great flavor!  Suggest getting some tin foil big enough to line the bottom of the Turkey pan to make the transfer of all the goods on the bottom easier.  We will be using this recipe from now on.  Already have had great reviews from family!  Thanks for a keeper - made us not 1 new recipe, but 2 great ones!

Great turkey recipe.  I didn't even roast breast side down, just left it up the whole time and basted twice.  It was amazing.  I don't agree with the wine pairing though, Chardonnay doesn't go well with turkey, a sweeter white or Rose goes much better.

This turkey was very tasty, I'm sure because of the brining.  As someone else mentioned, however, I had a heck of a time turning it over, and mine was only 12 pounds.   Next time I will cook it right-side up and baste it.  I cut back the salt to 1 1/4 cups because of the size of the turkey.  I am glad I did not use more because it would have been too salty.  I also stuffed it with our favorite stuffing recipe.  I cooked it for 4 hours at 350.  Thank you!

I tried this recipe with a small turkey breast, not a whole turkey.  Perhaps that's why the roasting pan dried out, and I had to keep adding water to the bottom to keep from burning.  The turkey did not turn out juicy.  I might try this again if I'm cooking a whole turkey, but not just the breast.

I will never cook a turkey again without giving it a nice brine bath first. This truly does make for a wonderfully juicy and flavorful turkey. I did put the butter and herbs under the skin as well as in the cavity with the celery and onion. I also added a couple slices of apple to the cavity and omitted the carrots.

I am not much of a turkey eater, but this is a great recipe.  I've made it several times now and every time it has come out wonderful.  I added some broth and extra wine to the pan because one cup didn't seem like enough to me.  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe right on and it worked great.

I will never make a turkey any other way. This is the best! It was juicy, tender and had an excellent flavor. Every single one of my family members agree that this is the best turkey that I have ever made( and I have been making Thanksgiving dinners for 25+ years)Thank-you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This was GREAT.  I will never fix turkey any other way.  It was beautifuly & moist.  I stuffed it with our traditional oyster stuffing and a 20# turkey only taken 4 1/2-5 hrs. to cook. I did however leave the turkey exposed in the refri over night as mentioned in
 previous reviews.

I cooked this for Thanksgiving this year and it was the best oven turkey I've cooked yet.  The only thing I did different was bake breast side up because I didn't think I'd be able to get it turned back over with out a huge mess and it still turned out wonderful!  This is one of the most moist turkeys I've ever tasted.  I'm not a huge turkey fan and I really enjoyed the flavor.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This was juicy/tasty but it did not get any color, it was barely brown.  However the skin was crispy and my boyfriend loved it.  I am going to give it another shot for christmas.

This turkey turned out fantastic.  We did not turn the turkey halfway through, we just put it in and basted - and it still turned out great.  (We did not want to chance any turkey mishaps...)  This is going to be our turkey recipe for holidays from here on out!

At 8 1/2 months pregnant, I hosted my first Thanksgiving dinner for 12 people.  
We had every possible problem with the day, including the oven breaking in the middle of cooking this 23 pound turkey.  This recipe was not only easy to do, but the turkey was absolutely incredible!  It was so moist and tender and full of flavor!  This recipe will be in my book forever!!!

Made this dish for Thanksgiving 2008 and it really was wonderful.  It browned up nicely and was plump and juicy.  There was just a hint of too much salt, though.  Next time I'll cut the brine salt back to less than two cups.

I enjoy this recipe a lot. Easy to make and the turkey comes out juicy as can be.
The only modification was: I brushed butter on the turkey before putting it in the oven.

I made this turkey just like the recipe said, and it turned out wonderful. I soaked the turkey all night in brine water, and like some of the reviews said, I used a garbage bag to put it into. My family was all around the bar munching out on it while my husband was carving, and they were saying, "Mom, this is the best turkey you have ever cooked. The breast meat was so moist and tender, we couldn't believe it. My son got the recipe and cooked one the very next day just like mine, only I think he left the veggies out of it. I will make my turkey's this way from now on. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Great Smell but, the brine was off in my opinion. Resulting in a very dry Turkey. I bought two turkeys same weight and brand. My husband and I made this one and the Elton Brown one. The Elton B. one was terrific, So moist. The brine included herbs with the salt and broth to cover the bird while it brined. 
I also had a problem with all the alchohol burning off right away. This bird was a mistake. People please know birds can be juicy and not dry.

This was the first turkey I have ever made and it was amazing.  My boyfriend and I both thought it was the best we have ever had.  Very juicy.  We did not use carrots, but used whole mushrooms instead.  The mushrooms left whole absorbed the flavors in the pan and were one of our favorite parts of the entire Thanksgiving dinner.

This was the best turkey I ever made and with the turkey juices we had the best stuffing every. Will use this recipe every year. Used Fresh Turkey (3% savior seasoning) & just shy of 3 cups of salt (did rub lightly the outside of the turkey), boiled brine, iced it down. Filled the cooler (large lidded cooler)with a 20 lb bag of ice and water to cover the turkey overnight. Everything else was by the recipe.

BY FAR THE MOISTEST TURKEY I HAVE EVER HAD!!  THIS WAS MY 2ND TURKEY I HAVE EVER MADE.THE FIRST ONE WAS I COOKED IN A BAG AND WAS DRY. I THINK IT MUST BE THE BRINING PROCESS THAT MAKES IT SOOO MOIST.  I RUBBED THE SALT ALL OVER THE TURKEY AND PUT THE TURKEY IN A GARBAGE BAG IN THE FRIDGE OVER NIGHT- BECAUSE I DIDNT KNOW HOW ELSE TO KEEP THE TURKEY COVERED IN THE WATER?  WORKED WELL.

Ok, this was my first turkey ever. I added 1/2 cup of sugar, maple syrup, honey, garlic, pepper, and lemon juice to the brine. I am never NOT bringing my bird again. This was the best turkey I have ever had in my life. My husband and brother went crazy over this. Thanks for the recipe.

Very moist and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly except i let the bird sit uncovered in the fridge for about 3 hours after removing from the brine as suggested by another reviewer. Great way to cook a turkey and relatively simple.

This was my first time to cook a turkey, and it turned out wonderful.  We used a twenty pound turkey, and it was not easy to turn over (but well worth it).  The white meat was to die for.  My family was very impressed.  The only thing I would recommend is not putting the vegetables in the bottom right away.  They tend to burn.

The name says it all...this is the ONLY way I'll do turkey from now on...breast meat (which hubby and I don't like) was delicious!  Fixing to make soup from leftover carcass and veggie stuffings.

I made this for Thanksgiving and couldn't be more pleased with how it turned out...everyone loved it.  The brining was somewhat difficult (mostly because I didn't have a large enough stockpot), so I ended up with about 1/4 of my turkey hanging out on top. I just turned it over early on Thanksgiving morning so that the other part could soak for a few hours before I cooked it. It sure was worth that extra trouble, though, I was so surprised at how moist it turned out, and that was even after over-cooking it a bit.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and put chopped apples inside the turkey and a lot of vegetables (carrots, celery and onions) around the outside of the turkey. Great recipe, a definite keeper -- thank you so much!

I cooked my very first turkey on Thanksgiving yesterday and it turned out very well. Sooo juicy and flavorful. My family and guests loved it. One of my guests (who is a chef) commented that my turkey was so far the best that he had tasted. The process is long but if you follow the instructions carefully,you will be happy with the result. Though, I am not so happy with the skin browning.Next time I will cover it with foil half way during roasting to make it more brown.Thanks for the recipe and I can't wait for next year Thanksgiving.

By far the juiciest turkey ever!!! I always cook mine breast down for about 2 hrs. It forces the dark meat fat to pool into the breast meat. The brining made it succulent and tender. Use lots of veggies and herbs. Worth the effort!

This is an excellent recipe! My pickiest eaters (my 7 & 10 year old daughters and my opinionated father in law)LOVED IT and even had seconds. It was my first try and it was a hit! It was absolutely flavorful, juicy, moist and tasty!

This is the first time I made a turkey like this. I must say it was fantastic tasting. I really rinsed it good after the brining so the salt was there but not overwhelming. If you add broth to the gravy using the drippings you HAVE to use the reduced sodium broth.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is the manner of cooking. This was the juciest turkey I have ever had BUT when I turned it over as instructed it looked like a cross between the Pillsbury Doughboy and a Chinese Shar Pei. I used a turkey roaster with the V shaped rack. The bars were about 2 inches apart and the turkey breast weht through about 2 inches. It was a 23 pound turkey so I am sure that didn't help. I will make it again this way, with it's juicyness and browning it was fabulous but when put out for my family to see and do the official carving, they laughed so hard they had tears in their eyes! Once they tasted it...they settled down and couldn't believe how awesome it tasted. Next time, I will look for a rack with narrower spaced bars or maybe put foil layers down the center. Great recipe, and I will take any tips to solve the Shar Pei breast issue.

First time briner, and this really truly is the only way to go.  I can't really state enough how much better a turkey tastes after brining.  I did a 24 hr brine instead of 12 hrs, because I had read other recipes stating 24 is ideal.  I was going to try a Martha Stewart brine that was 48 hrs, but decided, for the first time, I would be less ambitious.  I will NEVER make a turkey another way.  I got raves from my own mother - which is hard to come by!  I also did not flip it 2/3 of the way- I cooked it breast side up the whole time, and just loosely covered it with foil for the last 1/3 of cooking.  Looked as good as it tasted.

Excellent and much easier than the brined turkey I did last year (it involved all sorts of spices and ice). I used a 13-pound turkey and it took exactly three hours to cook. I roasted it breast-down for two hours and then breast-up for one hour. I didn't have room to put the stock pot (containing the turkey) in the fridge, so I left it on the cold stove all night. We keep our house well below 70 degrees, so it was fine. I don't have a rack for the roasting pan, so I just put the bird in the bottom of the pan among the veggies and broth (instead of wine). Our five-year-old scarfed on a drumstick for most of the meal! It was fabulous and moist, this will be my go-to for turkey. Thanks for sharing, Shelly!

Great recipe.  I didn't have fresh thyme so used a little dried - and chicken broth instead of white wine.  Also, I didn't have a rack to put in the roasting pan so I put the bird in breast side down for an hour and then turned it breast side up and put the lid on.  Then another hour.  Wrapped the ends of the legs and wing tips in foil and roasted uncovered the remainder of the time, basting every 30 minutes.  Turned out amazing!  Thank you for a permanent recipe for my holiday turkey!

This, by far, was the best turkey of my 40 years of cooking turkeys. I followed the recipe exactly - adding a small bit more of everything for a 21 lb bird. 16 yr old son, who usually "tolerates" turkey, slobbered all over himself repeating the phrase: "oh my goodness, oh my goodness" as he tested the white meat prior to serving... Husband, picky bro & entire family loved it. The most difficult part of the process was a container large enough to cover the bird - was resolved with a designated "brining cooler"!  Thank you, thank you! for this amazing - yet simple- recipe.

This was, by far, the BEST Thanksgiving turkey I have ever eaten. Due to a problem at my local butcher, I didn't get the turkey until Thanksgiving morning and thus only got to soak it in the brine for 3-4 hours, but it was still so juicy and full of flavor! I will be using the recipe next year and every year - thank you very much!

I have been making Thanksgiving dinner for 14 years and have made turkey several different ways. This turkey recipe is now one of my top two favorites! It was perfect for a non-Thanksgiving turkey craving. I saved the drippings to make gravy for open-faced turkey sandwiches with mashed potatoes the next night. Delish!!! Thanks for making turkey fun during the "off-season"!

So, so easy!  My first turkey ever was beautiful and super moist.  I microwaved the veggies a little before putting them in the bird and they came out just right.  I recommend this recipe to everyone.

This turkey turned out SO tender.  We made 2 turkeys, baked one with this recipes and fried one with another.  Fried turkies tend to be more tender but they were both equally tender and SO tasty.  The vegetables inside had no flavor after baking so don't plan on using them when finished but you could taste them in the turkey.

Loved the tip about roasting upside down.  However the brining didn't seem to make a difference, and the veggies turned out horrible.

This turkey turned out awesome.  My husband said it was the most tender turkey he's ever had. I purchased a brining bag and invested in turkey turners which paid off and made the whole process much easier.  After putting it in the bag, we put it into a bucket and set it in our refrigerator overnight.  The only thing I might do different is add more spices, but that's about it.

WOW! This not only made a very flavorful and juicy turkey, but the gravy was fabulous!  We only needed to add a touch of pepper to it and BAM.. absolutely to die for!  The only changes I made were I doubled the veggies used and added a dry white wine to the brine and the bottom of the roasting pan.  You could taste the celery and onion in the bird - do not pass up this recipe!

I followed the recipe almost completely.  I substituted Chicken Broth for the white wine so I didn't have to make another trip to the store.  This was the first turkey I have ever made.  It turned out great!!!  My family (even the in-laws) loved it.

Used this recipe for Thanksgiving. It worked great. Brining is definitely the way to go for moist, flavorful turkey. I used a brining bag since I didn't have a vessel big enough for my bird. The white wine adds a nice flavor to the drippings/gravy as well. Thanks for the recipe.

I used only part of this recipe for my 2007 Thanksgiving turkey.  I used the part to stuff the inside of the turkey cavity, and used the rosemary and olive oil recipe for the outside.  It was fantastic and very moist.  See Rosemary turkey recipe for the other details.

Loved this recipe! I did the "easy herbed roasted turkey" from this site last year, but this one was better. I couldn't find a roasting rack at the store so I decided to throw all of it into a bag. It was fabulous. The men all stood around the turkey as it was being cut just picking away. Thanks for this one--I'll be using it next year.

Wonderfully moist turkey! It was beautiful. The first turkey I ever made, people were impressed. Last Thanksgiving the person that made the turkey did not know what they were doing. It imploded just like on the movie Christmas Vacation. I should send her this recipe

How can you not give this recipe 5 stars? Thank you Shelli for sharing such an excellent recipe with us. First of all I received so many looks while the turkey was brining. I didn't have enough room for our bird in the fridge so I put it in a 5 gallon bucket and covered with ice water. I kept draining off the water and adding ice. My hubby wanted to know why I was soaking a turkey in a bucket in the laundry room. Ha ha isn't he cute?

Despite the sarcasm and the curious looks this turkey hands down was the best either of us has eaten. I was complimented on my ability to make a ridiculously awesome Thanksgiving feast and he even shared the news with his mom who was wondering if he was going to fly home last minute for dinner.

Again Shelli I can't thank you enough and for all of you out there wondering... YES! make THIS recipe you won't regret it.

Cheers!

Amazing. I was skeptical about the lack of seasoning, but I've never had a better turkey. And I don't know why no one else commented about the drippings. The best gravy I've ever made and it basically made itself. I poured everything from the pan in the blender to puree the remaining vegetables. The flavor was amazing. I added a bit of flour and that's it - no broth at all! Had tons of perfect gravy and the best turkey ever. Thanks so much!!

Just made this recipe for our Thanksgiving on Sunday!  It was great - but I did make some minor changes.  First, you must brine the turkey (if you've never done this before, you have to, it'll be the best, most moist turkey you have ever had!  For the brine, I added abt. 8 cups water with 8 cups apple cider, plus cinnamin sticks, 2 tsp. brown sugar; fresh sage & fresh rosemary; plus kosher salt.  Let turkey sit in brine (I did it in a bag & put it in the refrigerator) for 14-18 hrs.  We grill ours also - another great tip is grilling, adds a great flavor that the oven just doesn't match.  Grilling takes the same time as in the oven, our 18 lb bird took 4 hrs on the grill (added charcoal as needed to keep hot).  Other minor change I made was adding fresh rosemary in lieu of bay leaf in cavity, along with carrots, celery, onion & thyme.  Also, initially basted turkey with melted butter, then olive oil.  During cooking I basted it with melted butter only, turned out perfectly!!!

This was first time using this method. We used a low cost turkey at 88Cents a pound.We let it brine for just over 24 hrs. It turned out great,very moist and tender. And take the time to make the gravey, it is easy and tastes great. Everyone was impressed.

I have rated this recipe 5*'s based on the happy and full belly family members.

This was my first time to make a turkey so I wanted to prove to my family that even though I'm a Vegetarian I could still make a good turkey. 

The aroma is amazing. I could tell that is was a very moist turkey from the moment I stuck a fork in it. The juices came flowing out. When you carve the turkey it slides right off because of how tender and moist it is. My family always eats the ham, but not this year. They ate a whole 18lb turkey and then nominated me to make it for all the years to come.

Thank you sooooo much for a very successful recipe.

This turkey was good.  The only reason I didn't rate it as 5 stars was because it was so hard to find something to fit it in.  Next time I'll cook a smaller turkey.  I also omitted the white wine since I didn't have any and the taste was still very good.

This was such an awesome recipe. The only thing we changed, and this is because we don't use alcohol of any kind, was the white wine. In it's place we substituted pineapple juice and my it was delicious, and still succulent two days later.

This was my first time to brine a turkey and it was great!  When I went to roast it in the oven, I found out that my pot wasnt big enough - oops!  Forgot to take into account all the extra vegetables (and the fact that I had a 22 pounder).  So I put it in my large roasting oven.  It cooks much faster in there (another thing I found out, ha).  Even though the turkey was ugly, the taste was great!!!  Very moist and tender.  All my guests also raved about the carrots!  Will definitely try this again for Christmas, but maybe I'll look for a larger pot to put it in:)!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This turkey got rave reviews from my entire family at Thanksgiving. I was a little worried about the wine, but it was wonderful.  I have to agree with adding more vegetables (I didn't and wish I had) the carrots had such a wonderful flavor. The vegetables in the turkey cavity didn't cook all the way and were still a little crunchy. I suggest adding more carrots around the outside of the turkey. You'll be disappointed if you don't. The gravy was really good as well. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

The veggies and wine added to the turkey made for the absolute best gravy that I have ever had. I followed the cooking instructions for this recipe, but used the "Turkey Brine" recipe on the site for the brine as it has spices in it; not just the salt. I didn't bother turning the bird, and it came out just fine. Will definitely do this again.

This was great! The meat was practically falling off, and it tasted wonderful. We bought a plastic storage bin to put the turkey in our fridge for brining, and it worked out great. We're not sure if this will become our standard turkey recipe, but we will definitely try it again!

It really is perfect turkey.  Personally, I left out the bay leaf and added a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary.  Also, you can add other ingredients to the brine.  Overally, a great turkey recipe.  Thanks!

I have used many Turkey recipes over the years but this is by far the easiest and best. The only thing I did different was that I didn't roast the turkey breast side down. It still was wonderful. The gravy was great too.

This was my first turkey and it was a huge success! I soaked it in sea salt water overnight, and it was very moist. Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME Turkey!!!  So incredibly moist and the veggies were so tasty. I made a few changes, in addition to the white wine I also used a small amount of Jack Daniels.  I added some black pepper to the veggies, and extra fresh thyme and some fresh sage leafs under the turkeys skin.

I had never made a turkey before.  I made it for a Holiday party in which I was in charge of the Turkey.  Out of all the turkey's brought, this one recieved the most compliments and was the only one finished off.

I blame myself--we skipped the brining process and our little 8 pound turkey was a little dry on top but the rosemary and gravy ultimately helped it out.  It's actually been more useful for leftovers so all is not lost (and the leftovers have been great in soups!)

I had always been satisfied with my thanksgiving dinners before, but this year was absolutely the best dinner ever.  I felt like experimenting with a new recipe, and this one is definitely a keeper.  It was really the most moist turkey I've ever made.  It was my first time "soaking" a turkey overnight.  It sure did make all the difference.

Holy juicy turkey, batman!  This is the BEST turkey recipe, ever. Period.  The brining is the key, I think.  The veggies were also a big hit and the white meat was just divine.  I actually saw a guest of ours taking a picture of my turkey!

I have never made a turkey myself before.  I bought one of those give away turkeys at the market. What a fabulous suprise!  It was terrific.  Added extra veggies as per others instructions and I was happy.

All of my guests said it was wonderful! I drank too much on Thanksgiving and really don't recall what it tasted like, so I guess I'll believe my family. :) My boyfriend insisted on using his own favorite brine mix but other than that I followed the recipe.

For the vegetables, I used sweet potatoes, onions, and celery.  Inside the cavity, I squeezed the juice from 2 lemons, then baked it with the lemon rinds, rosemary, sage, and thyme.

(In addition, I rubbed butter between the skin and the meat before cooking, and sprinkled thyme and rosemary over the top)

The family loved it!

Delicious and juicy turkey.
I did not follow the stuffing recipe though; made my own.
But the salted water definitely played an impact in the turkey's juiciness.

This turkey recipe is amazing!!!! This was my first time ever making a turkey and it was for my whole family too. It’s was perfect!! Even the white meat was so juicy and delicious. I didn’t brine it because my turkey was pre brined. I also kept the turkey breast side up the whole time for fear of it falling apart. Everything else I followed exactly and it was so perfectly delicious!! I will use this recipe every year!!! I never write reviews, but I had to for this because if your hesitant and scared like I was, don’t be!!

This turkey recipe is absolutely a keeper! I was worried about the flipping process, but we used oven mitts with plastic bags over them so we wouldn't worry about the juices soaking through and burning us (or ruining the mitts) and it was very easy. My turkey was an Oven Stuffer, which is already brined, so I skipped that part. I used the vegetables and herbs inside the bird and on the bottom of the pan as the recipe called for. I did add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the outside of the turkey. We couldn't believe the difference in how moist the white meat was! It came out perfectly browned, too. I'll be making it this way from now on. Highly recommend!

My turkey was only about 12-14 lbs so it took only 3 hrs 15 mins to bake on 350. I chopped the veggies smaller to stuff inside the turkey since previous reviews said that their veggies didn't cook well. I cut the veggies for the bottom of the pan a little bigger and they came out perfect to eat. I added almost 2 cups of white wine instead of 1. I used a non-stuck roasting pan with a shallow rack and scattered the veggies on the bottom underneath the rack. Turning the turkey was tough. I used someone's idea of putting oven mitts on and covered them with ziploc bags and turned it that way. I used the turkey juice/drippings to make a turkey gravy. I just added salt and pepper and flour to make it thicker. It was really good. People who don't usually eat gravy said it was good. Hope this helps!

Yes, I'd make it again...and since I'm the 76 year old cook, it means that it's easy.  I skipped the brining...rubbed kosher salt inside and out; sprinkled a bit of poultry seasoning inside before stuffing it with a typical bread/celery/onion stuffing.  Yes on all the vegetables, wine, etc.  Had to add more wine and some broth  during the cooking.  Basted as it cooked.  It went about 4 hours...and was 185 degrees in the leg--perfect.  Guests loved it too.  Very juicy.

I really like this roasting technique.  I've followed this recipe exactly before and it's come out great.  This year it was better though. I dry-brined for 2 days in a turkey bag, did not rinse the brine, removed the bag and dried it  in the fridge overnight before roasting.  I started the turkey upside down as stated, but at 450F for 30 minutes.  Then lowered the temp to 350F an followed the recipe as suggested, flipping the bird 2/3 the way through.  The bird was unstuffed, but had onion and apple in it.  It took almost exactly 12 minutes/pound to reach 160F.  I rested it 30-40 minutes with foil and it was PERFECT.  So moist!

I wish I thought to take a picture!  This turkey was picture perfect.  It looked fake!  The seasoning was spot on, the bird juicy, and the skin perfectly golden. I did Not turn it, however. I knew It would be too heavy and too hot for me to handle. I simply cooked it breast-side up the whole time.  Excellent.

This turned out to be the best juiciest Turkey I ever prepared! My son is very picky when it comes to Turkey and he would not stop eating it. That made it our number one receipy for making Turkey from now on.

This meal turned out GREAT! And super moist. I did however change a few of the ingredients and seasonings to make it more flavorful. But my family and I really enjoyed the way it turned out. Thanks for sharing this info.

I used bacon grease instead of butter due to my son not being able to have milk. Added rosemary and more Thyme to the bird and roaster. Put about 1.5 cups of wine in and it was amazing!!!! Otherwise I followed the recipe and everyone raved. Used the drippings to make gravy and all I had to do was strain it!

Getting ready to make for the third year. It always turns out great and everyone loves this turkey. I followed the recommendation of putting in an oven bag and placing in cooler overnight vs. stock pot in fridge to brine the turkey prior to.

This was the “perfect turkey!” My husband needed a recipe to make a turkey and we chose this one. We followed the instructions. Only thing I forgot to buy was the bayleaf so wasn’t used this time. It not only made the entire house smell good, it was the tender, juiciest turkey I’ve ever had. I don’t even like turkey because it’s always dry and this time I couldn’t believe how much I loved it. The friends we had over loved it too! Great recipe!!

We made this turkey recipe a few years ago and the onl thing i did differently was uses a flavored wine. It made the best gravy. My family  still talks about this turkey. Also i cooked it upside down. Whe i went to turn it the last 30 minutes of cooking ( to brown the top ) the turkey broke in half. It was very very tender. I personally think its brining the turkey that makes it so tender.

I decided  to prepare a turkey dinner for my ladies Bunko group. I purchased a 24 pound turkey then got worried it might be a disaster if it came out dry. So, off to allrecipes I went for some suggestions. This recipe looked to be the best and easy too. It turned out beautifully golden brown and after resting it was delicious and so juicy. I shared a breast and leg  with my daughter-in-law to serve for dinner. Rave reviews from the Bunko ladies and my son and grandsons. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is great! Don't forget that Butterball turkeys will already be brined so you can skip that step. Also, for larger or smaller turkeys they usually have guidance printed on them how long to cook them for.

Been doing my turkey like this for years now. My 97 grandmother  in law says it’s the best she’s ever had! Huge hit here, thank you for this. Only thing I changed was covering the turkey with tin foil for the first 3/4 cooking time and when I flip the bird I then leave it in covered . And shove some butter under the skin .

Deeeeelicious! Best turkey I ever had. I didn't have celery or rosemary though, just onions and carrots. I diced them and stuffed the turkey with it, then added them to the Stovetop dressing--yum! After turning the bird over I added a bag of small carrots to the roaster-- best-tasting carrots ever.

My family loved this meal! I will make it again and again.

This was the most delicious turkey I’ve ever had. I didn’t flip the bird and it was totally fine with just the foil tent. The brining kept it from being too dry. Next time I will double the pan veggies because they were so yum!

No changes and I may try making it again as it was very juicy and good. Next time though I need a bigger pan as it was hard flipping the turkey over.

This year was my 3rd Turkey making experience & The Best!!!  I skipped the salt water brining (because I fell asleep) but will definitely do it next year!  The turkey was so moist!!!  I ended up letting my turkey rest for 1 hour after I flipped it 2 hours in, before cooking it another 1-1/2 hours.  13-1/2 lbs.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe - Total Win!!!  I also made a gravy with the drippings; 2C. Drippings + 2C. Chicken Broth + 4T. Corn Starch, that turned out fabulous, thanks to the turkey flavoring!

This was easy and delicious.  I actually didn’t do the brining and even with a relatively cheap turkey, it came out moist and flavorful.  I just salted the inside and outside of the turkey and went on from there.  I also took the broth and veggies  that were at the bottom of the pan when the turkey was done,  threw them in a blender, put the blended liquid in a saucepan, added a little bit of sifted flour and had a delicious gravy.

My buttermilk brine worked perfectly with this recipe. All my birds never seemed to come out completely done, until this recipe. What struck me most was the awesome mahogany color of the turkey and just how truly delicious it came out. My 12 pounder came in just under three hours and it was so juicy!

First time making a turkey and I can't believe how moist and perfect it actually came out.  My kids loved it too, they were surprised it was actually turkey because it really was that moist.  I read other reviews and the modifications I followed were: leaving uncovered in the fridge 3 hours after rinsing off brine solution; adding herbs to the basting butter; and removing from the oven at 170 then resting for 30 minutes. Delicious!

Wow!!! Very good! We all really enjoyed this turkey. The gravy was also tasty used part of juices from turkey. Added to neck broth cooked with celery and onion. I used savigon blanc wine.
Can't wait to make again.
Thanks!

Hands down the best turkey ever! I do make a jazzed up brine though (rosemary, bay leaf, fresh pressed garlic, Apple cider, brown sugar, Kosher salt, orange peel, and poultry seasoning) which is to die for! Due to using sugar and apple cider in my brine, I do cook it covered with foil the first 2/3 of the cooking time.

This was a hit at home!! It's not thanksgiving yet and I have a family of three so I didn't want to cook a large bird. I ended up getting a 5 pound turkey and reduced the portions of other ingredients. This has to be knew of the best turkeys I've had. It was even better as leftovers. Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  So moist and wonderful.  Next time, though, I will drain the juice out of the pan at some point during cooking. It was like a big vatt of soup at the bottom!

I've used a butterball turkey, 20lb and have a convection oven. It took exactly 4h to be ready, I feel like I should have covered the breast for the last hour or so, but didn't do it. No stuffing inside, just a small onion and some carrots as the recipe says. We skipped "turning the bird" part, as I was afraid it could have fallen in pieces or ruined the skin. Otherwise, followed the recipe on the dot, adding a bit more of onions and carrots only. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

My husband was skeptical, but he LOVED it! It was very moist and yummy!  Very easy to make and simple taste, but very good.  If you're looking for a very seasoned turkey, this is not the one.  But if you're looking for a basic juicy turkey, this one's delicious!

I made this and everyone loved it. It was falling off the bone, but I cooked it at a lower temperature & longer than called for and while it was  tender, it was dryer than it probably should have been. My advice is stick to the cooking temperature and time.

As simple and fail proof as it gets! And makes for a very tasty classic bird!! Once i notice my turkey getting really golden i tent it with tin foil to keep it from browning too much. Other then that- no changes made- came out perfect! Juicy!

I used this recipe for my first turkey. It was definitely juicy, but I wish I had followed my instinct to add more spices because although it had the perfect amount of saltiness, it lacked in the flavor department.

The breast was incredibly juicy, though, and I'd say cooking it breast down and flipping it is a great idea. Don't skip that.

Just add more spices!

First off I made a big mistake and used pink Himalayan salt, followed directions & brined overnight. Rinsed and flipped over etc turkey looked amazing, skin so crisp. Unfortunately it was so salty we couldn't eat it. Believe me I tried a few times I love salt! Meat a little salty & that gorgeous gravy salty too. Felt so bad at least we could eat the meat. Next year I will use the kosher salt and maybe cut in half.

This is a perfect Turkey. Did use a different brine recipe from this web site but followed everything else from this recipe. Used rubber oven gloves to flip after two hours of roasting a 15lb turkey. Had no problems. We did have to broil on low a few minutes to brown skin but the end result was a moist delicious turkey. Have had dry Turkeys in the past but never again. I did the make ahead gravy from this website so I wouldn't have to hassle with it on thanksgiving so we used the drippings and veggies to make a stew. Everything was delicious!!!

Awesome recipe!  This resulted in my best-tasting turkey yet. I used a fresh turkey from a local farm. It was just under 13 pounds (we had a small event this year). I brined it using sea salt for about 20 hours,  and then rinsed it and let it sit in the fridge, uncovered, for about 4 hours before roasting. I didn't use all the veggies. I stuffed it with a cut onion, a cut apple, and some celery. I also used turkey stock instead of wine. Otherwise, I roasted it per the directions, flipping after 2 hours. It browned beautifully, and was juicy and tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed this recipe with the exception of adding an apple to the stuffing mix, and microwaving the stuffing for 3 minutes prior to stuffing it in.  It was without a doubt the moistest  turkey I have ever eaten (and I'm 63 years old, so that's a lot of turkeys!).    I did as other reviewers recommended and used pot holders in baggies to turn the beast.  Also, since I had no stockpot for the brining directions,  I used my refrigerator's crisper drawer and it worked like a charm.  Try it....you'll never go back!

Wow, starting the turkey out breast-side down made all the difference in the world! I ended up with a perfectly crispy skin all over, yet moist and tasty bird, as well as an amazing gravy.  My bird was pre-brined, and I used chicken stock instead of white wine, but still fabulous result. I had a 17.5 lb bird, so flipping wasn't too crazy, just had someone spot me, and I used a trick from someone else's review -- I put my oven mitts in quart-sized ziplock bags so I could grab the turkey with both hands firmly instead of using tongs and a fork. Sure enough it was already tender enough at that point that it tried to fall apart, and the mitts in the bags kept it from doing so. Will definitely make my turkeys this way from now on!

Perfect!! I loved this recipe. My only suggestion is to NOT put veggies in the bottom of the pan, surrounding the bird... mine scorched and had to be removed and almost ruined my pan drippings for gravy!

I've gotten so many compliments and a lot say my turkey is the best they ever had. I had a heavy hand on the wine and brined my turkey for two days.  I could get the top to crisp up but I think that's due to me flipping it a bit late.  Again the most moist turkey ever.  Everyone loved and I can't believe how awesome this turned out!  I read thru some tips that helped. I set my turkey outside in the cooler with ice.  Temps outside were cold so turkey did well. My bf used welding gloves with ziploc bags to turn over.  Turkey almost fell apart!  It was again amazing!

I followed the instruction as is. I had a smaller turkey so adjusted the time a bit. It turned out great and I will not make it any other way again.

Made this today and OH MY GOSH! The BEST turkey i have ever had. I used a Butterball turkey. I know, I know, they say not to brine a butterball turkey because it's already "pre-brined". I was hesitant to brine it after reading about the pre-brine.  I am so glad I went ahead and made it this way!!! I reduced the salt by half a cup and followed the recipe almost  exactly. I added more thyme to the roasting pan, and I lightly dusted the outside of the turkey with poultry seasoning. Oh, and I increased the wine amount to two cups. I had no need to use foil to cover any part of the bird, and the gravy made from the pan drippings was heavenly. 5 stars all the way!!!

Turkey came out delicious and moist.
What I changed was use a full cup of butter and sprinkled herbs de provence on the turkey after applying butter.

For my first ever turkey, I feel like I needed to baste it more, some of the white meat was a bit dry but otherwise it turned out great! And the drippings made awesome gravy.

So good! I bought a 10.5 pound turkey frozen and let it thaw for 2 days then brined it overnight. I used dry seasonings and omitted the bay leaf. I did not use carrotts but did use the celery and onions. The turkey was very moist and stayed that way after carving, we stored in fridge and ate it for 3 days. The bake method of turning the turkey over really helps for even doneness. My dark meat was a little more done than probably should be but I think I had my oven rack too high. Veggies were delicious, great flavor. The ones in pan were a bit greasy and the ones in the turkey were kind of crunchy but still good. I used Chardonnay for the wine. Will definitely do it this way for Thanksgiving!

My first turkey and it was a hit! I did use a different brine from this sight. That recipe added chicken stock and spices to the brine. Other then that I followed the rest of the recipe as is and everyone loved it. It was super juicy. Using a roasting rack in the pan made it easy to flip the turkey when it was time. I will be using this recipe again.

This was my first time making my own turkey, & it was simple & delicious! I've seen fam use complicated (& impressive, I guess) recipes that require so many ingredients I don't have on hand, so this was refreshing & unintimidating. I had a 13lb turkey, so I halved the salt & marinated it for more than 12hrs. Fam said it was a little too salty, but I thought it was prefect. I also picked up the "poultry mix" herbs (thyme, Rosemary, sage) & used it without the bay leaf. Now that I have it down, I may attempt to do something more impressive next time... Great basic recipe though!

So yummy! I poured the brine into an oven bag and placed the turkey breast-side down. I sealed it up, put the bag in a large cooler, and put more ice in the cooler. It worked well and didn't take up the needed space in our fridge. Thank you!

Turned out a bit dry (though this might have been due to me accidentally dumping half the salt-water on the kitchen floor while trying to negotiate filling up the brining bag). Not the best turkey I've even eaten but not the worst either.

I used a prepared, organic brine, which was added to water, instead of the kosher salt.

My turkey was free-range, grown organically. I was warned that this kind of bird is tougher than a Butterball, but more flavorful.  Cooked this way produced a tender AND flavorful turkey.

I had a 14# turkey. Cooked much faster. Used a digital meat thermometer, so luckily pulled it out on time!

The gravy from this wine-based pan drippings? OUT OF THIS WORLD!

I am sorry it took so long to write.  This is the best, melt in your mouth way to make any kind of Bird, let alone the Thanksgiving Bird.  No matter when you are serving a Bird for your meal.  

My Family love the way it tastes and how wonderful it is.  Soft and yummy.  

It is a lot of work and it does take a few days.  But if you can and if you have the time.  Do it.

I will not make a turkey any other way again.  Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was fantastic.  I had planned to repeat at Christmas but may have to make it sooner.  The drippings for gravy was the best.  One thing to remember , do not salt the gravy until you taste it.  Mine did not need any salt at all from the turkey being brined.

Followed the directions completely except that I brined it with vegetable stock, salt, iced water and spices overnight. My first turkey came out great! Juicy, flavorful and enjoyed by everyone!

Best turkey I've ever had. It was juicy, tasty and perfectly cooked. I didn't have white whine on me so I chose to use the closes thing I had: sparkling grape juice (which worked perfectly well).  I also used a different brine. I used the following brine with orange slices added:

Used a 13 lb. turkey.  Therefore, I did minor adjustments to the amount of spices, etc.  Did not have any Sage so I used Rosemary instead - tasted great!  Didn't use any celery.  Did what a previous member said, added apple, cinnamon sticks, onion and rosemary to the inside of the turkey (still had the carrots & onion added to the bottom of the roasting pan with Chicken Stock added versus Dry Wine.  Absolutely a keeper!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Omg, the turkey turned out AMAAAZING!!! Everyone loved it! It was very moist, juicy, and flavorful. This was the first Thanksgiving my husband and I ever hosted and the very first time I've ever roasted a turkey. I will be using this recipe again for the next turkey. I followed this recipe almost to a T for our 25 lbs turkey! The recipe was sooo ridiculously easy to follow. We got our pan roaster from walmart for $10 that came with a rack. Having it roasted on the rack in the pan is so important. I planned on eating the turkey skin with the meat so I covered the turkey with aluminum foil the entire time it was cooking and the skin did come out tender. Although I did cook the turkey breast side down, I ended up not flipping the turkey at all bc it got done sooner than I thought. I thought it was supposed to be done at 185 degrees, so I took it out at 180 intending flip it but we ended up just carving it instead after I double checked the recipe, whew!! Im so glad I used a stay in meat thermometer while the turkey was cooking bc it was done 30 mins sooner than I anticipated. Also, the brining part was really tricky for me bc I dont have a pot big enough to submerge the 25 lbs turkey in. So I ended up using the turkey bag for baking a turkey to brine with in the roasting pan and filled the pan and bag as much as I could with the salt, a little bit of sugar, and water combo after I rubbed the turkey with the salt and some sugar. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I though

This was an amazing idea and recipe. I used another stuffing recipe that I found on this site that was phenomenal. However, I did follow the recipe and used the dry white wine and vegetables in the bottom of the turkey. I did cover the turkey with aluminum foil so it doesn't dry in the oven. I removed the aluminum foil one hour prior to taking it out. My traditional grandma was astonished at this turkey turning business half way through it cooking.

This was my first thanksgiving making the turkey by myself and I followed this recipe exactly and everyone loved it. A very simple recipe to follow and everyone commented on how juicy the meat was. It was a little difficult to turn the bird over, but I was able to do it myself using the pot holders in ziplock bags method. The taste of the wine was very strong in the vegetables and gravy. I used a good tasting Chardonnay and you can really taste it throughput the dish. I didn't like the taste of the vegetables as many other reviewers commented because of the strong wine taste, but this is a great recipe for an easy and delicious turkey

My turkey was only 10 pounds so I reduced the recipe by half.  The brining process was a massive success!  At my table, turkey has always been something you eat but not something that is enjoyed.  This is the FIRST year that the turkey was enjoyed by everyone.  The vegetables were not a success so I will leave those out in the future.  The turkey itself, however, was sublime.  This is going to be my go-to recipe for turkey in the future although I will definitely add some spices next time.

Turkey was awesome, but only 4 stars because I needed to make adjustments. As written, it would not have worked for us. The adjustments I made, were to brine it in liquid rather than a rub. In a large pot of water (I just filled the pot), I dissolved 2c each sugar and kosher salt, approximately 1tsp each allspice and peppercorns, 1tbsp each dried thyme, sage leaves, and rosemary (crushed). Boil until sugar and salt are dissolved. Cool. Pour over turkey in a large pot, bag, whatever. Top off with cool water until submerged. Stuffed turkey with 2 cloves of garlic, a handful of fresh sage, thyme, and rosemary, cubed sweet potato, green apple, carrots, celery, and onion. In that order. All leftover vegetables went into the bottom of the pan upon which the turkey was placed breast side down. To about a cup of white wine I added approximately 1/8th tsp pepper & seasoning salt and 1tsp of dried parsley. Poured that over it. Then did that again after I flipped the turkey back over. My 18 lb turkey took 4.5 hours to cook. The little button never came out. But it did eventually after letting it rest. Meat thermometer was at 175 when I took it out. I did rub it under and over the skin with butter as well. It was fantastic! And I will definitely make it again. Gravy from the drippings was a bit sweet, probably from the wine.

Fantastic!  I made a 9 lb turkey and it took approximately 1 1/2 hours to cook to internal temp to 155.  Let  it sit as directed for 30 minutes. And not only was the turkey fantastic, the vegetables too!

We just got through cooking and eating our turkey. It tasted absolutely wonderful. We doubled up on the wine and used a fat separator so the drippings wouldn't be so oily.

Made this recipe a couple of years ago and it was the best turkey I ever had.  Unfortunately, I lost the recipe and didn't find it until now.  I will be sure not to lose the recipe again.  Can't wait to try it again!

Yum...didn't brine...turkey was already injected with solution.  Didn't flip turkey over...was just for us and didn't have to be picture perfect...we don't eat the skin anyway.  It was the best turkey I've ever cooked...and I cook them frequently.  I will always cook breast down from now on.  The meat along the back of the turkey was delicious.  It usually just gets added to the stock pot.  I got so much more meat from the turkey using this method.  Juicy and came off of the bones so easily.

Turkey was great but when I went to flip over my 22 pound turkey at 3.5 hours, it was falling apart and already fully cooked. Not sure if this had anything to do with using an electric oven. The veggies inside the turkey were slightly crispy. I left the oven on at 170, covered the turkey with foil, a damp hot towel and a dry towel to keep it from drying out since I had about 2 hours until I was having my guests over. Turkey was delicious and moist and the veggies cooked through during this time.

I've brined many turkeys using many different methods.   Usually they involve some kind of sugar, but this one did not.   In spite of that, the results were excellent.   The turkey came out perfect and was very juicy, even the next day.   I had never cooked a turkey breast side down before, but I think I will again.   I ended up with an evenly cooked and evenly browned bird.   Thank you for the great recipe.

This was my first turkey and I'm so glad I had this recipe to follow!  I didn't get a chance to brine it - next time.  My boyfriend and I loved the turkey and the veggies in the pot were extra yummy!  Our house smelled amazing all night.  Next time, I'd like to use more veggies - I just need a bigger roasting pan!

I used the recipe for "out of this world turkey brine" , but only used 1 cup of kosher salt.  I followed everything else as the recipe states except I did tent some aluminum foil over.  My turkey turned out nice and moist.

I was finally a star.  EVERYONE said so after Christmas.  I admit, I also used a turkey that was already soaked in brine from the store.  I used sparkling apple cider with the maple syrup.  And I just used used Italian Seasoning that has thyme, marjoram etc in it pre-mixed.  Lots of salt, and some pepper.  And I was a star.  The gravy was from  heaven too.

I crushed a whole garlic and added it to the brine.  So glad I did because it gave it even more flavor.  This is how I will do it every time now!

This was my first year making a Turkey. I found this recipe and I am so happy that I did! I had a quick change in plans so I was not able to soak the turkey for 12 hours. I just rubbed the turkey in salt and I cleaned it. I then cleaned he turkey again and put very little salt on the outside and the inside. I had a 10 pound turkey so I ended up using a little less of the celery,onion and carrots. When the turkey had been in the oven for 3 1/2 hours I simply added more butter. I did not move the turkey at all.  I let the turkey cook for about 4 1/2 hours and then did another light coat of butter. It was amazing! Everyone loved it and kept asking me for the recipe !   It was so juicy and tender and tasted great. Thank you!

I made my very first turkey today with this recipe. I made a few adjustments based on family preference. I also stuffed it with an apple. I also cooked it covered for the first 2/3 of the time, and then uncovered it for the remainder of the time. I basted the turkey when it was uncovered! It was delicious!

Great general, easy turkey recipe.  I also add 1 cup of sugar to the brine.  This recipe has me busy during the holidays as my turkey is requested at every holiday gathering and office luncheon.  I usually have to cook three at a time.  The cooking juices are excellent and I always have people fighting over them, crazy I know.  Get your brine on girls!

The reviews are spot on. This turkey is jucy and falls off the bone. This was my first ever turkey, and I am so happy with how it turned out. I will add more veggies around the turkey next time. For anyone concerned about the two cups of salt used in the brining process, I too was skeptical, but it turned out great. I let my turkey brine for 24 hours and it came out a perfect, crisp brown. Amazing recipe!!

Turkey Day 2013 - was great.  I didn't marinate in the salt because it was already done from the store.  Otherwise, followed receipt exactly and produced a tender, tasty bird!

The best TURKEY EVER! I've made it 3 times using a 22lb turkey I just added a little extra ingredients because of the size of the bird but each time it's so juicy and tasty. Since using this recipe I have been designated to be the one who makes the turkey for our family. Never any leftovers it all disappears, we LOVE IT!

Awesome turkey. I made it twice this holiday season. The second time, I did not stuff it with the veggies as they were too oily. These were my first two turkeys and everyone thought I was a pro.

Great flavor and texture. i added more herbs overnight with the salt brine, and more thyme before roasting. All 20 people agreed it was the best turkey they'd had.

This is a great recipe! I used dried thyme instead of fresh, and I didn't use a bay leaf because I didn't have one. I suspect it would be better with these things but it still turned out good. I also had to settle for regular salt not kosher salt, and I didn't measure the salt I just rubbed some on. Next time I will use a little more. 
What's great about this recipe is that the turkey is juicy and falls right off the bone. Usually Turkeys are hard to carve but we got all the meat off with little effort.

This recipe works like a charm.  Apartment dwellers may find it useful to use your (clean) recycling bin as the turkey brine bucket.

The first time I made this recipe for my boyfriend, he thought that the turkey was upside down when it was done.  If you want to picture-perfect turkey, make sure that the breast is facing up for the last two hours.

Yes and it was super - this time I don't want to put the veggies in the turkey I want to use stuffing.  Anyone tried it without the veggies?

First time hosting Christmas at our house: We used this method last Christmas and can't wait to use it again!  Amazingly moist!!! The turkey *could not* make it out of the roaster whole (so I guess that might be an issue for some... we carve in the kitchen and serve a platter to each table, so not a problem here) My mother-in-law was impressed, which is saying a lot! And my father-in-law had 4 servings! Definitely recommend this :)

Awesome!!  We didn't have a bucket or huge pot so we very carefully brined it in one of those plastic turkey bags in the roasting pan.  (imagine goldfish in transport bag)  My husband was terrified of flipping the turkey over - strong tongs are good... but he stuck the landing.  Looked fabulous, tasted even better.

Made this one for Thanksgiving this year, and I have to say it is the very best turkey I have ever made.  Incredibly flavorful and juicy.  The only thing I did differently was to rub the bird with softened butter, some of which I stuffed under the skin of the breast meat before placing in the roasting pan.  Then I covered with a generous sprinkling of herbs (thyme, rosemary, sage, and herbs de provance) and let it roast.  The entire family loved it and I was complimented repeatedly.  It's definitely worth the extra step of brining it.

I just have to say this recipe was SUPERB! I will never cook a turkey another way from now on. I didn't have any kosher salt but had coarse sea salt which I used instead. I also added a couple more carrots and celery stalks since my turkey was bigger. I brushed the entire turkey with butter first instead of doing the breast after flipping. It came out amazingly moist and browned up nicely. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful method for cooking a turkey.

This made a very good turkey, but I thought the vegetables were a little pointless. The veggies inside the carcass were too crunchy, and the veggies in the pan were overcooked and SALTY. I loved the flavor and aroma of the wine though! The drippings were a very nice addition to the gravy. Overall, very good!

This was my first year making Thanksgiving dinner and I'd never even touched a turkey. So glad I tried this recipe. It was the best turkey I have ever tried. So must, even the left overs are most and it's Monday after Thanksgiving. Don't be afraid to use the amount of salt listed. I used a 8.75 lb. Turkey.

Stop looking for a turkey recipe - this is it!  I've made this a 2nd time for Thanksgiving and ijt was even better 2nd time.  Here are some hints.  Rinse the turkey...a lot!  1st year I thought I did and had salty gravy that even cut up potatoes couldn't completely rescue.  This year I spent 5 minutes rinsing off turkey - especially the inside and it was perfect.  I also threw in 1 sliced potato in with the veggies at the bottom so that may have helped too (and those potato slices tasted heavenly).  ONE important NOTE, this has not yielded much gravy for me.  My guess is that the vegetables soak up a lot of the juice.  Luckily I had a jar of gravy to add to the homemade. Also after letting the turkey set out before carving, had more juice that I quickly added to the gravy. 
1st Time Notes:   Hooray!  This was a big hit.  It was easy to do - except storing the turkey in the brine.  I finally resorted to an oven bag to put the turkey & brine in and then placed all of that in a clean bucket.  My gravy was salty and I tried to save it with a potato which helped.  Still, not a big problem - I just warned everyone not to salt anything.  The turkey was very moist!.  I followed recipe exactly except I added some 1/2 cup of chicken broth I had left over that I didn't just want to throw out. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this recipe to make my very FIRST turkey this past Thanksgiving.  It turned out excellent!  I used a pre-brined turkey so I skipped the first few steps.  Heavy poured on the wine and used extra FRESH thyme.  I wish I could bottle the fragrance this turkey filled our house with!  And the turkey turned out perfectly browned and juicy.  Stellar recipe.

This was a great recipe. I didn't change much. I didnt have enough space to cover the whole turkey in the brine so I put it in my crockpot in the fridge in an oven bag. In the morning I flipped it. It did spill though! Those oven bags dont work. I also ran out of Kosher salt so I used sea salt. Still tasted amazing!! Very juicy and super good. I stuffed it with baby carrots instead of regular carrots.

I never review anything. THIS WAS AMAZING. And made me look like a star. I was so incredibly impressed with myself, but in reality all I did was follow the recipe. Only thing I did differently was substitute half the stock for Apple juice (used 2 cups of sea salt) and use fresh herds. IT WAS AMAZING.

Just used this recipe for Thanksgiving and it produced some of the juiciest moist breast meat I have ever eaten. The only thing I did differently is that I roasted my turkey half the time breast down, the turned it halfway instead of 2/3rd. I also added more of each ingredient since I was roasting a 23 lb bird. Lastly, I roasted my turkey at 325°.

Made exactly as stated.  Best turkey in years!  18 pounds worked well for 9 adults and 6 kids with plenty of leftovers.  Herbs I used were fresh rosemary and sage along with poultry seasoning.

I was nervous about making my first turkey so I used this recipe.  I got compliments from even the pickiest eater and they all commented on the juiciness of the meat.  I didn't have it defrosted early enough to let it soak for 12 hours but it was still good for only having soaked it for 2 hours.  I can't wait to try adding apples next time like other raters had suggested.

Wow!  Easily the best turkey I've ever made.  I had a 24.5 lb turkey so was really worried about the breast meat being dry since I knew I'd never be able to flip a bird that big.  I cooked it breast side up the whole way. It was as moist, juicy and flavorful as you could want.  Really didn't change anything else.  I have used other brine recipes in the past, which had more flavorings in them but for whatever reason, this simpler one is the BEST by far.  Oh, and my bird did not have a pop up timer and I ended up putting my regular meat thermometer in a bit late.  It read 184 degrees in the thigh meat and I was so worried I had ruined it.  Most guides say 165 degrees.  But as I said, it was awesome!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic!  We followed it almost exactly.  We used the an extra turkey bag to brine it over night.  It was really cold where we live, so we were able to keep it in the garage over night.  Simply delicious!

This was the juiciest turkey I've ever made. Used the Turkey brine from another recipe. 18 lb turkey only took 3 hours to cook at 350

This is the perfect turkey!! It was absolutely amazing and so juicy. My hubby questioned the entire brining process, so much that I started to get concerned, but once it was time to carve, he couldn't stop saying how this was the best turkey we've ever made ha! I accidentally used table salt, but clearly it didn't negatively affect the end result. Also, I didn't flip the turkey and just baked it breast side up. 20lbs turkey on 350F for 4 1/2 hours. Made the gravy from the vegetables by blending some of them and mixing them up with the drippings - it was great!

This was seriously the best turkey I have ever made. I will NEVER use another recipe again. My family raved over how moist and juicy it was. I was sceptic at first about baking a turkey for 4hrs uncovered that it would dry out. Im glad I read the reviews and didnt cover i. I only used the kosher salt, butter, and white white. Due to the fact that I had so much other food I didnt need the additional veggies. And it still turned out amazing. I would give this recipe a million thumbs up!

Tried this recipe today and it came out excellent.  The turkey was very moist after brining the turkey overnight.  I did cut the salt in half and added 4 sprigs on thyme to the cavity of the bird.  The vegetables the cooked inside the turkey tasted delicious.

I don't think turkey gets any better than this! Excellent recipe. I used the onion and celery to make stuffing. I used Pinot Grigio wine-2 cups. The gravy was awesome, a little salty at first (maybe I didn't rinse my turkey enough after brining) but I added a potato and let it simmer until the potato was tender and it was perfect.!

I have done this turkey for four years now.  The first year I followed the recipe to the letter, I had never cooked a turkey before! I now have to cook the turkey every year no matter who's house we are at.  I don't think I will ever try another recipe.  Always a huge hit with whoever tries it.  This turkey is always super moist and has a great flavor.  I only made a few simple changes to the recipe.  I added two cloves of garlic in the bird and two outside, just gave them a quick smash with the knife and added them to the other veggies.  I fill the bottom of the roasting pan with wine until it touches the bird, it ensures there is enough liquid to make lots and lots of gravy.  Like others I use a oven bag for the brining and toss it in a cooler with lots of ice for at least a day.  Turning over the bird seems a little sketchy at first but like another reviewer here said, just put plastic bags over the oven mitts and you will have no problems. Not sure why you are still reading this and not trying it.

This will be the 7th year I make this turkey.   I don't use carrots as no one eats the veggie stuffing.   i stuff the turkey as much as possible with spices, onions, and celery.  I also pour the white wine over the turkey, not the veggies.  I have always used white cooking wine, but this year I'll be trying a Sauvignon Blanc.   I use a large stock pot with ice water for brine as I can't fit a turkey in water into my fridge.

This was the, best turkey we have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly. I could hardly wait for the leftovers the next day. I brined my turkey in a cooler (in an oven bag) overnight because our refrigerator was so full. 
You definitely need help to flip over the turkey, so be sure to have an extra set of hands ready.

The stuffing was over saturated with liquids from the turkey. Aside from that--spectacular! Heated 15 degrees higher than recommended.

I used all the suggestions from "lalalina's" review and it helped me make a great turkey for Thanksgiving. I didn't want to carve it because it looked so pretty. Litehouse brand makes "Freeze Dried Poultry Herb Blend" so I added about 1/4 cup of that in the bottom of my roaster and it gave it great flavor to the turkey and the gravy. Thanks for the tips to help me make the best turkey ever!

Made my first turkey ever using this recipe with great success. We didn't eat any of the veggies (I didn't have the right amount of them anyway), but it added good flavor to the meat.

This turned out really delicious!!!! I added a spice rub to add to the outside of it, but will keep that part to myself. lol. I also went ahead and covered it in foil to help keep the juices in. Also basted about every hour with the drippings/white wine mixture. Wish I had time to take a picture of it, because it turned out to be a beautiful dish, but people were hungry. Will definately make this again, might even try this recipe on chicken & or a cornish hen.

First time hosting Thanksgiving and roasting a Turkey so I made sure to follow the instruction exactly and it turned out wonderful!  My husband couldn't stop talking about how juicy the turkey came out and said it was the best turkey he has ever eaten. Everyone that came made sure to take some home with them. You definitely need room in the refrigerator to brine the turkey, we had to do some rearranging but it worked out. I know that someone suggested using a bag and filling it with water and putting it in a cooler filled with ice, I will try that next year.

This was my very first turkey and it came out flavorful and moist. Everyone  loved it. The only tricky thing is turning the turkey but  it is worth iit. I followed the recipe exactly. Also, if your oven cooks quiuckly, you may want to cook the bird at 325  for a longer time than 350.

This recipe was absolutely awesome!!! This was our first time cooking a turkey for the holidays and we could not have been happier. We had a 16 lb. turkey and used about 1/2 a bottle of Pinot Grigio, rosemary, thyme and sage. Everything else I followed exactly by the recipe. Everything worked out perfectly! The gravy was fantastic as well. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!!

The taste of the breast from the brine was just amazing. However, the vegetables weren't really edible after cooking, but they did add to the flavor.

Turkey came out beautiful!  I followed the posted directions but did rinse the turkey completely and let it sit in the frig to dry.  I wasn't sure what type of white wine (this is not noted in the recipe) so I went with Cupcake Chardonnay. I could smell the wine throughout the house.  I totally enjoyed making this turkey and it tasted delicious.  The only problem was that the turkey I made was the second turkey at our gathering so we didn't get to eat it until later in the day.  Unfortunately, I did not get to taste it until it had set out for hours.  It was delicious then so I can just imagine how it tasted when it was still warm.  Would most definitely do this recipe again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Since this was the very first turkey I've ever made, I can not compare it to other turkeys I've made. However, if I go by what everyone said then I have to say IT WAS THE BEST TURKEY EVER!!! It was so moist and browned so beautifully. I was worried about cooking it breast first because when I flipped it, it looked as though I had boiled it. But within minutes, it was golden and crispy. My husband isn't a fan of turkey but he just couldn't get enough of it. And btw..if you have a turkey that has a plastic thermometer in the breast, it will still serve its purpose because you should have it flipped before it pops out. Usually for Christmas, I cookout ribeye steaks but because of how delicious the turkey was, I'm definitely making turkey instead! Perfect turkey is the best name for it!!

Best turkey I ever made.  I used Williams Sonoma brine mix, but then followed the recipe once I rinsed it off the following day.  The turkey browned very quickly, and I had to put some foil to keep it from burning, but no big deal (I live at high altitude, and the 350 degrees may have been a bit high).  Even with the very brown skin, it was amazing, tasty, MOIST and tender, everyone loved it!  I added a lot of extra carrots and onions, and those were eaten up by the guests, as well.

Like every other family that has had this turkey, mine was in love as well.  The brining process was something that I'd never done before so I was a little hesitant to try it.  However I am so glad I that I did because my family all agreed that it was 'the best thing on the table'!  The only negative thing I heard was that the turkey was too small!  Definitely adding this recipe to the artillery.

I followed the recipe but left out the wine and cooked my turkey in a roaster oven.  My turkey fell apart when I flipped it but if you don't care about the appearance of your turkey, it will be the best turkey you've ever had! The breast meat was very moist and flavorful.  The gravy was a bit salty but I was able to water it down a little and it tasted great as well.  Overall, loved it and I'll do it again next year!

it was my very first turkey and nobody could tell! very very juicy and no need to do a separate gravy! the only tricky thing was that when I turned it, I removed the skin by mistake so it wasn't the beautiful presentation you always see.

Very juicy. Keep in mind cooking the turkey breast side down means the legs cook first, so checking the thigh shows the proper temp half way through the cooking time. I flipped the turkey and waited for the plastic popper to pop. Will definitely use the recipe from now on!

AWESOME!!  Our turkey was super moist and the skin was perfectly browned and crisp.  I will never try another recipe.  I didn't care for the wine in the gravy, so I will just use chicken broth in the future.  I made a 13 1/2 pound bird and still used the full two cups of salt and our turkey wasn't salty at all.  We used a fresh, range free bird, not a Butterball.  I brined our bird in a turkey bag inside of a stock pot...worked perfectly. Thank you for this great recipe!!

I made this last thanksgiving, and it turned out fabulously. It was my first thanksgiving cooking and it was easy, low maintenance and a huge hit! I did use an entire bottle of wine instead of a single cup though. Don't be afraid to play with it until you find what's perfect for you!

Used this recipe yesterday and love it.  My husband even commented on how good it is.  The next time I won't cook the carrots with it.  We thought they were too greasy.  I did sprinkle black pepper on the turkey before baking but what a wonderful fragrance all through the house.  Can't wait to try this at Thanksgiving when the whole family will be here.

This was my first time ever making a turkey and I am proud to say it came out delicious and it's all thanks to this recipe!  I added and extra onion and 6 sprigs of thyme but everything else is pretty much the same.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and helping me make my very first turkey!  I am ready to host Thanksgiving this year!

I am giving this the 5 stars only because I cant go any higher. 
First I followed the recipe until it was to the seasoning. I added my own flavor along with cooking it in a countertop roaster in a bag. I cooked it for about 4 hrs. it was only a 14 lb turkey but around the 3hour I opened the bag and let it cook the rest opened. The turkey fell off the bone. it was so tender. 
I also like to insert [Corona] was the beer I added to it. It was delish.!!!!

I used this recipe last year.  It was great.  I used rosemary instead of thyme (for no reason except that is what I had on hand)  Love the white wine-have tried red with my bird in the past and I prefer the white.

An easy and very tasty recipe yet potentially very salty for some palates, as you could expect.  There is no doubt that soaking the bird in brine will improve this traditional dish, however, the gravy made from the drippings may be, likewise, overwhelmingly salty.  Be careful how much salt you use in the brine.  Also, this overwhelming salt taste to the gravy can be neutralized by deglazing the roasting pan with boiled water and/or adding stock to the roux in lieu of the juice from the drippings.

I am not a natural cook, I have to have a recipe.  I cooked this on Christmas for 16 people.  EVERYONE said it was the BEST turkey they've ever had!  I attribute a lot of it to the Kosher salt method and flipping the turkey 2/3 of the way through.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

Really good recipe!  My turkey, whose name was James :-) was excellent! The vegetables inside the turkey didnt cook so well, but were still nice to eat with the turkey.  White wine was excellent! I added a lot more vegetables than called for around the turkey including SWEET POTATO! After it was done, I processed some of the turkey juice with all the vegetables and added it to boiled chicken broth. It made for an excellent excellent gravy. Everyone loved the sweet potato taste!  Thanks for helping me make my first turkey!!

This turkey came out moist and flavourful. Amazing! Cooked ours stuffed with instant stuffing and it was wonderful.  Did not change anything else, the veggies were a tad on the greasy side but went well incorporated into the stuffing!  YUM!

The brining process really made a difference.  It was very diffucult to turn the bird over at the 2/3's mark.  However, my family is huge so we don't do the carving thing.  We just tear it up and serve in trays.  We served three medium birds to 44 people this year they all raved.  :)

Was a lot of time to prepare and tasted average.  Didn't meet my expectations and the stuffing fell quite below my expectations.  Not worth the time & effort.

I've always had a bit of trouble cooking a full bird, whether it's turkey or a chicken.  This turkey was absolutely delicious- perfectly cooked, juicy, and completely flavorful.  I cooked a 16 lb turkey and kept a close eye on the cooking time since every bird cooks differently- mine took a little less than 4 hours.  This is my turkey recipe from now on- thank you!!!

This was my first time trying this recipe and I couldn't be happier. The turkey was so moist and juicy. The gravy was to die for good! This is my new way to cook a bird and will try the wine and herbs with my next beef roast and veggies. Amazing results, super easy to do.

I just made this turkey for Thanksgiving this year for my family and this recipe is easy to follow and like it says -makes PERFECT turkey. The brine is absolutely what makes the difference. I left mine overnight- and every inch of meat on the bird was juicy and delicious. If you are looking for an easy recipe-look no further.

I hosted my first Thanksgiving Dinner this year and it was fantastic! I chose this recipe...seemed easy enough. It was delicious! I have never had turkey so juicy. I always thought I didn't really care for turkey it was always so bland. Brining is key! It is a bit of extra work but it is SO worth it! This will be my turkey recipe for many years to come!

The turkey was very tastey, and even easier to make.  It wasn't as moist as I hoped, but I think that's because there wasn't enough liquid in the bottom of the roasting pan.  Next time, I'll add more wine or chicken broth.  This turkey made awesome gravy!  I couldn't get enough of it!  Overall, I loved how easy this turkey was to prepare.

In my 45 years of cooking , I have made turkey for the holidays about that many times. This year was by far the best tasting turkey I have ever cooked. The taste was just the right amount of salty and juicy. Cooking the bird breast side down is the key to moist white meat as well as dark.  I followed this recipe completely with the exception of pouring the white wine in the turkey cavity that was stuffed with the recommended vegtables and not over the ones that were in the pan and I did not flip the bird as I left it breast side down throughout it's complete cooking time. Oh, and don't forget to pour yourself a glass of white wine to toast your Perfect Turkey.

This is the best turkey I have ever made!!  I didn't have any carrots on hand and I used 1/2 the salt and chicken broth instead of wine.  Otherwise, I did it just like the recipe said and it was absolutely wonderful!!  I "tented" the breast with foil after I flipped the bird, then removed the foil for the last 1/2 hour it so it would brown all over evenly.  I took it to a Thanksgiving potluck - it "rested" during the ride - and everyone raved about how tender and juicy it was, even the white meat.  It needed no other seasonings and the gravy was also awesome.  Yum!

Best turkey I have ever made.  I followed the directions to the tea and it turned out so moist and juicy.  I used a mid-sized plastic container that I cleaned out really well and placed a glass casserole dish in the bottom.  I used that to do the overnight brine soak.  I just placed it in the garage with the lid on where it was 36 degrees, since the plastic bin would be much too large for the fridge.  I can't wait to make it again next year!

I am a newlywed and expectant mother so I figured this year was an oppurtunity to take lead in the kitchen and attempt my first turkey. My family came to visit me and my husband and I was a little nervous about the food turning out. I followed this recipe and between 5 people we finished a whole 15lb turkey in 1 day!!  Something I can suggest: I don't care for wine base in food so I used 1 cup of apple juice. I also stuffed 2 big sprigs of fresh rosemary and sprinkled some sage (power). My dad is very critical of food and he said it was the best turkey he had EVER eaten!!!

Outstanding!! The best turkey I have ever made. Didn't have kosher salt, just used a little less table salt. Used canola oil instead of butter. Used an aluminum foil tent to prevent overbrowning. Also started at 500 degrees for 30 minutes first, then followed the rest of the directions. Never brined before, but this turned out great!! Thanks!!

My Thanksgiving turkey was great!  I had a 20 lb bird so it was too heavy to flip during the cooking time.  The white meat was so moist.  The gravy from the drippings was so flavorful with the vegetables that cooked along with the bird.  Thanks for the Thanksgiving goodness!

Absolutely Delicious!!  I'm not sure if it was the salt rub or the soaking or the upside down roasting, or the wine or what but this is absolutely the juiciest, yummiest turkey I've ever eaten (or made).  I used my own recipe for stuffing, but otherwise followed as directed..it was amazing! Next year I might try the previous suggestion to let it sit in fridge a few hours once rinsed to crisp the skin more (because hubby likes crispier crust) but I thought it was just PERFECT!

This was my first year ever cooking Thanksgiving dinner and this recipe was a HUGE success!! All 8 people at dinner raved about it...the initial overnight soaking is definitely key along with roasting the turkey for the first 2/3 time upside down. It really helped the breast meat soak up the juices. The turkey was moist and delicious! Thanks for the best turkey recipe ever!

I loved this recipe! I used poultry seasoning instead of the thyme and bay leaf and chicken stock in place of the white wine.  It was the roasting method I liked the most.  The breast meat was nice and juicy and the meat practically fell right off the bone.  I will cook my turkey this way everytime!

Just like everyone else has said, this IS the perfect turkey. After having my mom cook the turkey for  all of my 59 yrs., I took over the job this year, (about time!!) Everyone raved about it being the best tasting, moistest turkey ever! I never eat white meat as it's so dry....not this time! Even went back for white meat seconds!  I didn't have Kosher salt so I had to substitute unground sea salt....worked just fine for me. Added a few spices as suggested by others - sage and rosemary. Drippings made such good gravy I didn't add any spices except pepper. Thank you for sharing such a fabulous recipe. I can't wait to do it again!

We had a much smaller bird, so we halved the recipe. We had never made the bird solo and were thrilled with this recipe. Ours looked just like the picture and tasted great!

Wow!  Followed recipe exactly with exception of using fresh thyme--didn't have it.  Used dried thyme mixed up with the veggies instead.  Was very moist--definitely best turkey I've ever made.

This recipe made the most flavorful and moist turkey I have ever cooked.  My family raved as they gobbled it up.  Will definitely use again.  I cooked a 6 lb bone-in turkey breast, so I halved everything.  Cooked at 325 for 3 hrs.

Made for Thanksgiving and it truly turned out "Perfect."  Very moist and flavorful.  Flipping the turkey was a challenge, so make sure to have extra help when doing this.

I did not need the veggies but was looking for a way to cook a turkey.  I had purchased a store brand turkey and was afraid it might be tough.  I used the 2 cups salt and soaked overnight.  I washed, dryed and peppered it but forgot to put the butter on it.  It was tender & delicious.    I will do it again next year.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (added an apple as well, added herbs to melted butter to be brushed on skin and used a flavor injector to inject the same butter into the meat). It was the moistest most flavorful turkey ever. Several guests have now deemed me "the turkey maker" from now on and claimed it was the best they ever had....not sure if that's good or bad :)  Oh!....this also made the best gravy too! Thanks so much!

This really was the perfect turkey!  Every bite was extremely moist and flavorful.  We followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  We didn't have a pot large enough to fully submerge the turkey so we turned it upside down halfway through the soaking process and it was fantastic. This will definitely be our Thanksgiving turkey recipe from now on.  No more dried out, flavorless meat for us!

This was the best turkey me and my family have ever had! I also added 2 apples and some red, yellow and orange bell peppers into the stuffing... because I had a 24lb bird I left breast side up and basted every hour.

WOW, what an amazing, easy turkey (especially since I used a pre-brined bird from Trader Joe's)! This was my first ever, and it came out unbelievably moist, juicy, and flavorful, and the drippings made a delicious  gravy--all I had to do was add 2T flour.

I have been using this recipe since 2006 and it never fails to produce the juciest turkey ever. And what I especially like is I am not basting every 10 minutes. I can actually enjoy time with family instead of running to the oven to baste!

I tried this recipe for the 1st time. My turkey was so delicious and juicy. The flavor was through the roof and went all the way to the bone. I made a substitution of adding apple cider vinegar to my brine liquid and instead of celery stuffed with granny smith apples. The flavor was fantastic.  Will definitely make my turkey this way again.

Great recipe. The turkey was tastey.Hasn't anyone else noticed that the combination of the bird and the water and the stockpot and/or cooler is heavy?  I tried the oven bag in the cooler method and the bag split when i tried to lift the bird and brine into the cooler. Then when I placed the brined bird uncovered into the frig for a few hours to dry it out, there was a LOT of liquid weeping out of it. Just be prepared the effort is worth the trouble

This was the first time to prepare a turkey.  The prep process was not difficult or time consuming.  The turkey was moist and delicious.  The stuffing at the bottom of the roasting was very oily and not preferable to eat.  However, next year I will strain it and use the juices to make an amazing gravy.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Well I tried this recipe today for Thanksgiving and it turned out awesome! Everyone loved it. My 85 year old father in law wants the recipe!! It was moist and the skin was done just right. I did not start the turkey with the breast side down. I cooked it breast side up (I was afraid to turn it) being the 1st time trying it with guests. Next time I will try breast side down. Thank you for the recipe can’t wait to try it again.

I made this for our Christmas turkey, and my family and guests adored it - they raved about the flavour of the turkey, saying it was the best ever. I inadvertently cooked it about 15 minutes longer than called for (important to note that shorter cooking time) and it still turned out quite well, and not too dry after it had rested properly. The vegetable stuffing also worked out brilliantly, as I am a celiac, and was able to use the carcass for a turkey soup afterwards, which also turned out well. Will make this again, definitely.

I followed the recipe, only put a little too much spices on the turkey, but it came out moist and perfect.  It was kind of spicy, which gave a little kick to it. Whole family of non-turkey lovers loved it!

What a lot of trouble for a turkey and it is no better that the way I have made one for years.  I will not go to this much trouble again.  The only good thing about this recipe is the addition of white wine.  I made for a really good dressing and gravy.  This is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.

THANK YOU! this was the very first endeavor at baking a turkey (my husband usually makes it).. it was great.. moist.. my 13# turkey took a little under 4 hours..
I cooked it breast side up b/c i was concerned about turning it over!
it was perfectly browned...
I was concerned about the amount of salt-- but it was perfect..
I made it yesterday (in case it was a flop-- i wanted another day to redeem my New Year's eve dinner!-- but it was perfect.. so we have perfect leftovers and no cooking for me tonight!!!)

rine. vegetables and seasoning aren't necessary. just the brine and the melted butter. use light brown gravy. cook at 350 for 3-3 1/2 hours flipping 2/3 through. 2 6 pound turkey breasts=2 1/2 hours at 350 flipping 2/3 through. Throwdown: Turkey & Stuffing

This was my first attempt at Thanksgiving dinner and my first turkey. I had to modify slightly i used a 27 pound turkey! I also basted it in melted butter every 45 min or so and the skin turned a beautiful crisp golden brown color. I will be brining all my poultry from now on.

This was my first time ever cooking a turkey.  This was a very easy recipe to follow and it turned out perfect!  Everyone in my family agreed that it was the best turkey that they ever had.  Even my dad who doesn't like turkey asked me to cook it for Christmas this year.  I have a feeling I'll be making the turkey every year!

Very tender and moist. I thought the meat would have more flavor. It smelled wonderful but didn't taste as good as I thought it would. I will use the recipe again but maybe rub the turkey with seasonings.

Tried it out on a whole chicken. Unfortunately, I was unable to find kosher salt in my area and had to substitute with table salt. Maybe I didn't rinse it well before cooking too, but the end result was the juiciest chicken ever. Will certainly be having the perfect turkey for Christmas Lunch.

Indeed the best turkey I have ever prepared in my 25+ years of hosting Thanksgiving.  My husband and I share the responsibility.  We did it this year in a turkey roaster and omitted the wine soley by accident.  The drippings are perfectly seasoned for gravy.  There were no leftovers.  This was a first!!

this was a good recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving this year (08), but my Turkey was still dry and there wasn't much flavor.  Next time I will do a few things different, like putting the butter and spices under the skin of the turkey before cooking. And if you have a large turkey like I did (26lbs).  It is really hard to turn it over.  I will have to rethink how to do that.  Otherwise, everything was fine.

Turkey and vegetables tasted amazing. The wine flavor is lovely however it decreases the flavor of the gravy made from the juices. we cooked the turkey in a bag which may have altered the flavor saturation. Definitely worth another go!

This was the best turkey I have ever prepared and the gravy was to die for. The house smelled so good when the turkey was in the oven and baking breast down really made for a moist turkey. My children and grandchildren could not talk about a dry turkey this Thanksgiving.  Next time I will brine the turkey.

Very good turkey.  I liked the change of baking on the breast side down.  I didn't brine, but will next time.  Also, cooked to temp of 165.

This is the first time I ever cooked a turkey, so I was very nervous.  I did exactly as the recipe instructed, and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  For some reason my turkey didn’t brown, but that was probably a lack of expertise upon my part.  Next time, I will triple the carrots.  The carrots were so good they almost overshadowed the turkey.

I had never used a roaster for anything. I was told by several friends to try it, so I bought a roaster and tried it! Wow, the turkey was soooooo moist and very flavorful. I will be making Thanksgiving turkey like this more often. Update 2011 Thanksgiving: gallon bucket in garage. Covered with ice. update 2011 - used 3 boxes of stuffing and added celery and onion cooked in butter to it, then stuffed turkey. Wow, the stuffing was out of this world with flavor!

It was moist...but it was salty, and that ruined dinner for me.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was NOT a Butterball, which already is brined.  I rinsed the bird at least 6 times when it came out of the brine...but it was still salty!  Maybe my taste is weird...others thought it was salty but okay, my Mom and I thought it was really too salty.  Anyone with any hints to what I could have done differently?  I read all the reviews and expected it to be delicious...

After countless Thanksgiving turkeys, I tried this recipe last year and everyone raved at how good it was.  Tasty and Tender.  Be warned - Everyone asked to take leftovers home (which there wasn't much, so keep what you can).  This is definitely the way to go -- well worth the hassle of brining a big bird and finding the space for him.

I am giving this recipe four stars because I did not like the gravy.  The turkey turned out moist and very tender.  It was not too salty, which I was a little nervous about.  It also browned nicely.  I guess my disappointment in the gravy was because it tasted more like a vegetable broth than a turkey gravy;  I think the next time I make this I will use chicken broth in the pan and eliminate the vegetables -- except for the onion.  I guess my tastes are unique because based on all the wonderful reviews, the taste of the gravy didn't bother anyone else.  I made a 13 pound fresh turkey for just three people.  The two other people hate turkey -- and unfortunately this did not conform them. I followed the recipe exactly.

This is an awesome recipe! I did change a couple of things. I used 1 gallon of chicken broth in the brine instead of just water. I also added dried herbs; rosemary, thyme, sage, savory and garlic powder to the brine. I used sea salt instead of Kosher salt. I pulled up the skin on the breasts and stuffed 1 1/2 tbsp.s of butter under the skin on each side. I seasoned the top of the turkey with poultry seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper. It was phenominal!! Best turkey I have ever tasted!!

This is probably hands down the best turkey I've ever made.  For years I have tried everything from brown paper bags to deep frying, etc, etc, etc.  I am not through looking and will use this recipe again and again.  And the GRAVY!!!   Wow!!

This was a pretty perfect turkey for sure! I followed the recipe without any changes. The sin came out nice and crispy while the meat was very juicy. Thanks!

I used a Butterball "Young Fresh Turkey" and brined it. Not all Butterball turkeys are brined. Read the package and it'll tell you. It came out great. I ended up cooking it a little too long but even then it came out juicy. 

One thing we did was to puree everything in the pan below and used it as gravy. Maybe that's what everyone does, I don't know (this was my first bird) but that was the BEST gravy ever. In future I would add a thickening agent so it wasn't so thin, but we didn't care. It tasted so good! HIGHLY recommended!

The name of this recipe says it all!
I shall forever brine my turkeys.  It is amazing what a difference brining makes!   You won't be disappointed.  The turkey needed no additional seasoning.

This is the best turkey recipe, I have ever tried! Letting it soak for twelve hours in the brine mixture makes the WHOLE turkey so good and moist. I will never cook another turkey without soaking it in the brine mixture. It was a tremendous hit in my family! I can't wait to do it again!!

My thanksgiving guests said it was the BEST turkey that they had ever had in their lives.  Brining is a pain in the butt but totally worth it; I will brine all poultry from this day forward.  I stuffed thyme inside and around in the pan.  Turned out so juicy and tender.  Had to tent the turkey with tinfoil for the last half hour. I made turkey's shepherds pie with the leftover gravy, turkey and mashed potatoes.  I love thanksgiving!

This recipe really is perfect. The turkey was perfectly browned, juicy (not at all dry!), and tasty. Everyone loved it and decided it had to become the official turkey recipe for Thanksgiving. I would suggest tossing the vegetables in oil if you plan on letting them bake with the bird (they'll dry out otherwise).

Absolutely the best turkey I have ever eaten.  Moist and delicious.  The wine gave it a little extra flavor to it.  My skin never crisped back up on the top but I didn't miss it at all.  I didn't have the celery or thyme but it was still wonderful.  I will always make my turkey this way.

The brine was great and made the turkey very moist and juicy. I think it could have had more flavor. The taste of the turkey was bland. Also the juice from the turkey was very oily and it produce a lot of this oily juice. I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and this was also my first turkey.

First time I have ever "brined" a turkey and loved it.  No dry white meat for us.  Thanks.  I'm going to make homemade soup tomorrow with some of the leftover veggies and gravy.  Bet it is fantastic.

This turkey was superb!  Everyone raved about it at the table! My grandmother, who is an excellent cook, was skeptical about the brine and cooking breast side down, but when she tasted it, she said I'm in charge of the turkey from now on.  I did choose to use chicken broth instead of the dry white wine and I added more vegetables and herbs than the recipe called for. ( I had a 20 lb. turkey )  When my brother in law went to carve it, he said it took no effort because it was falling off the bone!  That moist!  Yummy!  Well, I'm off to make a turkey sandwich!

This is a KEEPER!  My first Thanksgiving to cook a bird... My husband held his tongue as I rubbed in the salt. He looked down his nose when I poured in the wine.  My mother chimed in that I was cooking the bird upside down. (Breast side down) Everyone was concerned when I didn't baste the bird.  HA - THE TURKEY WAS GORGEOUS!  Evenly cooked, juicy and flavorful.  Quite easy - Truly the PERFECT TURKEY.

This was the best turkey I have ever made.  It was perfectly moist, flavorful, and tender.  I used another readers idea and brined the turkey in a garbage bag and put it in the vegetable bin overnight.

I love to cook however I have never had the opportunity to do a whole turkey. Yesterday was my boyfriend and I's first thanksgiving together and I was so nervous I would ruin the turkey. I used this recipe and we both LOVED the turkey. We had an 11.5lb turkey, which I prepared the night before, the next morning I only needed about 30 minutes max to finish it up before putting it in the oven. It was the best turkey I've ever had and I now my boyfriend wants a turkey dinner at least once a month-which is fine by me. I will definately continue to use this recipe. Thank you.

I was so frightened when my parents were coming for dinner because I'd have to make Thanksgiving dinner for the first time.  Everyone loved the turkey and I could not believe how moist the breast was because I'm used to it being a little dry.

I didn't stuff the inside of the turkey with the veggies but put them all on the outside.  I also used more wine than suggested initially and when I flipped the turkey I added more wine on the breast in addition to the butter on the breast.

Perfect Turkey is correct !!!!  It was the most wonderful tasting turkey I have ever had. This was my first time cooking a turkey and I will always use this recipe for the rest of my life. This is an easy recipe. I only changed two things. First, I had a 20lb bird and so I added another cup of dry white wine. Second, I found a peppercorn rub at the grocery store that smelled fantastic and I so I rubbed my turkey in it.  My husband said that this is perfect, and his family made me the official Thanksgiving turkey cooker!

By far the most moist turkey I have ever cooked. I stuffed the turkey also. This was my first time brining and it certainly makes a difference. I will always brine in the future!

This turkey was the best one I have ever made -- and this comes after almost twenty years of making turkeys!
It was juicy, deliciously flavored, and almost every bite was eaten.  Thanks for a great technique.

I made a 7-lb turkey breast.  I was a bit apprehensive about brining my turkey, as I never did it before and worried that it might make my turkey salty, but no worries here.  The turkey was excellent - very moist and tender!  I did reduce the ingredients by half, used 3/4 cup of kosher salt, used olive oil rather than butter, and cooked it entirely with the breast side up.  I also inserted a pop-up thermometer, which you can purchase at your local grocery store, and it turned out excellent.  Will definitely continue making my turkey this way. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is really good for a basic turkey but it didn't turn out quite as juicy as I expected. The breasts were a bit dry. I also used white grape juice instead of white wine. Everything tasted great. The vegetables turned out to be very tasty. I will probably use this recipe again.

This was perfect! I used this for Thanksgiving and the entire turkey was eaten by my family. Now they are begging me to cook it for Christmas as well. Thank you for this fabulous recipe.

The name definitely fits this turkey.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone said it was the best flavored and most moist turkey they ever had.  I am now the designated turkey cook for Thanksgiving!  Thanks so much!

I was really expecting a juice running down your cheek kind of turkey. This was not very flavorful and was as moist as other turkeys I've made with out a brine. We will try again with something else next year.
