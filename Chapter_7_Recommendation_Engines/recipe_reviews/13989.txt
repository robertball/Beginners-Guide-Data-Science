This was a great dish! Chopping veges is the most time consuming part of this dish.  But don't let this stop you from making it!  I didn't have enough barbeque sauce, so ended up toppin w/grated cheese in an effort to keep the burritos from getting too crispy.  They turned out great!  Even the kids like them, but one child was turned off by all the onion/bell peppers, the other the seitan.  Otherwise, they thought they were great!

Real tastey and simple to put together, but watch out for how much chile's you use if children are going to eat it.

An exceptional recipe.  Granted, a bit labor-intensive, unless you have a food processor (I don't), but I found it to be tastier than expected and easy to put together.

A did make a few substitutions in the recipe, though.  First, I substituted 3 jalepenos for the habanero (my area grocery stores don't even carry serranos) and tofu for seitan (again, my store didn't have it).  Second, I used a spicy BBQ sauce -- same amount, just a bit more kick to it.  The end result was quite spicy, which is the way I like it, so be careful.  :)

What great taste!  I added black olives and extra cilantro.  I also added a little cajun seasoning to the rice while it cooked.  I surprised my roommate with the recipe, and we both loved it.

For yummystuff99. Seitan is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. It has a chewy texture and can be seasoned to taste like just about anything. You can find it at your store usually in the same section you would find veg deli slices and possibly near the water-packed tofu. I highly recommend you give it a try. You can also make it yourself out of vital wheat gluten. There are lots of great recipes out there. My favorite comes from the Post Punk Kitchen website. These burritos were awsome, by the way. My bbq addict fiance refused to share.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I tweaked it just a bit, though.  I used jalapenos instead of habaneros, shredded tempeh instead of seitan, and omitted the cilantro & green onions (didn't have them on hand).  I added some shredded low-fat cheese, and used a mesquite barbeque sauce, which added a nice flavor.  Next time I may add some corn.  For spreading in the pan and coating the burritos, I cut the bbq sauce with a bit of water, to make it less gloppy and more of a sauce (I used a very thick bbq sauce).  I baked it covered with foil, then removed the foil for the last 5-10 minutes.  That kept the burritos nice and moist.  The recipe makes a lot; freeze the leftovers individually for quick, microwaveable lunches.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will go into my regular meal rotation!

This recipe was so easy to make and follow, yet it tasted like I spent all day making it. My husband was in heaven. He just recently became vegetarian and he didn't think that he could do it, but after eating that he was ready to try anything!

I hate to rain on the parade, but this one didn't do it for me...WAY too much barbecue sauce. The filling isn't bad by itself, though.

I really love barbecue sauce and was eager to find a vegetarian recipe that used it but for some reason the texture of the seitan just did not agree with me.

This recipe was great! I made a few modifcations based on what I had in my kitchen.  I didn't make rice, and instead of peppers and some of the onions I used mushrooms, spinach, and sprouts, along with hot pepper flakes.  Very tasty!

I made these more like a fajita, but with a dry barbeque spice rub on tempeh that I sliced then braised in a little cumin-infused olive oil and liquid smoke. Didn't use the onion sprouts or barbeque sauce but grilled slices of caso blanco and wrapped in a wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato and medium salsa. Served with a side of avocado slices spritzed with a fresh lime.

Flavors come together wonderfully. The key is choosing the BBQ sauce you love since it is the most forward flavor in this recipe. I could have done with less rice, but my boyfriend loved the rice in it. The seiten offered a nice texture, but could easily be omited from this delicious recipe to reduce the cost, but not the flavor.

I had never cooked with seitan before. Now I think I'll do it more often! One suggestion though, Use smaller tortillas. There was a little too much tortilla on the 10 in ones for my taste. 

I substituted 6 jalepenos for the habaneros, it was great!

This was okay.  But the flavors were weird.  The barbecue sauce overpowered it and made the whole thing too vinegary and salty.  It would have been bad with any meat, so don't blame the seitan.  Great idea, and I'll likely use the same concept with a different sauce.  But not this particular combination.  I was glad, however, to be given a chance to try seitan and I'll definitely seek it out again to be used in something tasting better.

I've never had seitan but my boyfriend is a vegetarian and wanted to make something with it. So I found this recipe. I was a little skeptical but it was really good! We followed the recipe to a T except we used serrano chilies and whole wheat tortillas. His non-vegetarian friend loved them. We topped them with extra cheese, salsa, and avocados. Next time we want to add some corn salsa. Yummy!

My compliments to the chef! It is unusual, but the flavors came together nicely. Made it for a birthday dinner for a non-vegetarian and it was enjoyed by all. I always like to pan-fry the seitan before adding it to a dish to give it a nice crispiness. Also, I used more than a bottle of barbecue sauce. I think it might be nice to use two different kinds- maybe a nice thick one for the filling and a slightly more marinadish one for the top. A thinner bbq sauce I really like is Frontera brand, with a bright yellow label. I topped with cheese before baking, and served with sour cream- yum yum!

Fantastic recipe.  My grocery store did not have seitan, so I used tempeh instead.  It was the perfect texture for the burritos.  I used 3 habaneros because I like things spicy, and used a sweet BBQ sauce to counterbalance it.

I omitted habaneros and cilantro, substituted quinoa for rice, and added some fat free feta (which is virtually flavorless but packs a protein punch). Also used corn tortillas rather than flour, which is less fattening and brought a nice additional flavor. As another reviewer pointed out, the success of the recipe hinges on the bbq sauce. Mine was homemade and ho-hum, so the end result suffered a bit, but it was still yummy. Sliced avocado on the side was a welcome addition. If I'd seen the suggestion about adding corn sooner, I would have done so. It might also go well with some grated cheese on top. I'll definitely continue playing with the recipe and work this into regular rotation.

yums! I used tempeh instead of seitan and next time will put a little less habanero (maybe 1 or 1 1/2) cause it was spicy. The leftovers were great for lunch.

Lovely and very tasty and well worth the time to slap together. You really DO need to coat the assembled burritos very well before baking or they will carmelize and burn. I fed this to "the guys" for lunch and they never knew it had seitan in it.

This is the best new recipe I have made in a long time.  This makes a very large quantity. I left out the bell peppers and cilantro since we don't care for those. I also substituted a small can of diced jalapenos for the habanero. Delicious!!  The additional baking time at the end can be shortened if you are starving like we were - prep time was an hour for me.

i made it easier, healthier/ lower calories by doing this: less oil in sauteing, used 2 c brown rice (although the rice can easily be omitted & taste great! I think even better). I used dried cilantro, skipped the baking step all together & added bbq to taste (

Excellent recipe.  The flavor and texture of the food was pleasing to the senses.  This was the first time I used habanero peppers, so I put in two large ones - boy was it hot!  I think next time I'll use 1/2 a pepper.

We invited some vegetarian friends over for dinner and found this recipe. We omitted the seitan since we couldn't find it in the store, left out the habanero peppers, but used one jalapeno and added mushrooms. Our favorite bbq sauce is Sweet Baby Ray's, which added just the right flavor and we topped with avocados. Our friends brought over a corn, avocado, cilantro salad that was a perfect side dish.

I made this for my lab holiday party because one of my labmates is vegan and I wanted to make sure he had something to eat. These are so delicious! Even the hardcore meat-eaters complimented them. I personally didn't think they were spicy enough...but I've never worked with habaneros before and it's possible the two i picked weren't ripe? I picked the smallest ones because of the reviews of how spicy these were...I'll pick bigger peppers next time. 

And as others mentioned, I thinned the barbecue sauce before putting it on the bottom of the pan and on top of the burritos to make more of a glaze. After I removed the cup of sauce for the mixture, I added half a cup of water to the bottle and shook it up. Worked perfectly.
