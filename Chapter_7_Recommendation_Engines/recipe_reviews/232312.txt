So awesome! Two of my favorites: cilantro and lime. I tried to be cute and measure out the ingredients, but why bother; this recipe is fool proof. I omitted the chili sauce, and added some grated carrot. Oh! I also used the "juice" from a jar of pickled jalapenos in place of the rice vinegar and served the jalapenos on the side. I just served it with some fried pork chops this time, but I bet this would be AWESOME on a pulled pork sandwich. :-) Thanks for posting!

Perfect - just what I was looking for.  :)  However, I used plain yogurt instead of mayo, and did not have chili sauce.  The flavor is even better the second day, so if you can, make the dressing ahead of time.  The veggies get too soggy if you make the whole thing a day ahead.

This is downright tasty and definitely a winner in our house!  I love the ability to add or subtract ingredients to influence the type of main dish you are serving, ie., Mexican or Asian.  Served this with Slow Cooker Carnitas and Refried Beans w/o the Refry both from AR.   Recipes such as this make it fun to try new things.  Thanks 'Mom' for a great little recipe!

This was so great! I didn't measure, I used yogurt instead of mayo, spicy chili garlic paste instead of sweet chili sauce and I used a few scallions instead of red onion...it was excellent!

Made this and took half batches to 2 different get togethers.  Everyone loved it!  The cilantro and lime were a happy change to a normal mayo coleslaw.

We really enjoyed this different take on coleslaw! I thought it could use some salt, but that's my personal preference. This was nice, creamy and flavorful...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

so good. we use this on top of pulled chicken sandwiches. I use sriracha instead of the sweet chili sauce and white wine vinegar instead of rice. it's the bomb.

Loved this.  Really fresh tasting.  It's great as is, but I added a bit more lime and liked it even better.

Awesome!  I used the juice of a whole lime, used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar (i didn't realize that I was out), used regular chili sauce instead of the sweet chili sauce, added a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce because I was too lazy to peel garlic, and finally, put in a dash or two of fish sauce for more of the savory flavor.  I also added carrot, although it would have been too sweet for me as written... it's definitely a keeper for me!!

Awesome!  I do not usually like coleslaw, but love cilantro and lime.  Was trying to find a new way to use some cabbage and this is a perfect side to Mexican dishes or BBQ.  I cut back the mayo to keep it lighter and substituted some cayenne pepper since I didn't have chili sauce.  Also used a bit more rice vinegar and less sugar.  Last change was no onions.  Tastes fantastic without exact measuring :)

There's not an ingredient in this slaw that I don't love. I'm diabetic so the sugar concerned me so I substituted Splenda & it was great!!! I will be making it again.??

This is way better than traditional coleslaw. I stuck to the ingredients listed but I didn't measure anything. It turned out awesome! I added carrots and salt because salt makes everything better, in my opinion. This is the only way I'll be making coleslaw from now on. Thank you for posting!

Excellent slaw, I did add finely diced jalapeno, cumin and a dash of taco seasoning. Served with pork carnitas tacos and Mexican beans and nice cold cervezas!

I've made this coleslaw so many times, I nolonger need the recipe.  I've brought it to a few pot luck dinners now, and now it's the requested dish for dinners I'm invited to.   I double the recipe when bringing it to dinners, I also use bagged coleslaw to save time.  Great for bbq's!

This is delicious! I made some adjustments and it is still awesome. I omit the sugar and the mayo and use olive oil instead. It is seriously good and my 9 year old daughter calls it her favorite!

Killer Cole slaw ;)  Like the author said, it's really flexible.  I threw in half a chopped mango, subbed two stalks of green onion for the red (not a huge fan of raw onion), used mirin in place of rice vinegar (I was out of the latter), upped the sugar, zest and juice a bit, downed the mayo a tad, and despite all of that it was still great.        Much appreciation for sharing this!

Delicious and so fresh!! I used Napa cabbage, added freshly grated carrots and thinly sliced radishes because my husband loves radishes. Perfect side for Asian Pork Ribs in "Big Green Egg" cookbook! I agree that this is a no fail recipe. Definite keeper!

Have made this many times and it is always a hit. We play fast and loose with some of the spices so it changes a bit every everytime. Everyone always likes it. Pair it with some slow cooker chili and cold beers...

This was the first time I had ever made coleslaw without simply using bottled dressing.  It was so easy and yummy!  I'll definitely be making it again.

I love cilantro and I love lime but I was not a big fan of this. I'm not sure why because I really do like everything in here. Maybe I was just looking for more of a traditional Cole slaw taste. I still might make it again.

I followed the directions.  I thought it had a bit too much lime but my husband loved it.  Maybe next time I will use less zest.  I will try it again because it did have a different taste.

Very good and easy to make. I may not have measured accurately, but pretty much followed the recipe.  Believe this would be good for fish tacos as well.

This was my first time making coleslaw. This was a easy recipe to follow. I added my own little twist by adding a grill jalapeño. Mixing the sauce few hours earlier help with the flavor before adding to the cabbage. Adds a great flavor to a chicken taco.

Every single time I have made this everyone says it's the best coleslaw they have ever had.  I'm making it again for Christmas to put on our large green salads (in lieu of salad dressing, which I usually make from scratch).

So delicious! I used broccoli slaw instead of cabbage as that is  preferred in this house. I made the dressing in advance but added th slae veggies at the last minute to retain crunch as another reviewer suggested - will def do that again in the future.

It was great, although I didn't have all the things on the recipe (chili sauce, sugar) so I added honey and a 3 dashes of Chilula and it was delicious.  In fact, I plan to use it again but will be serving it with fish tacos!!!

This was great! I loved switching up the normal coleslaw and this was a great change. I served it with burgers, but it could work for mexican too! I added extra lime just for myself.

This was a huge hit. Used juice from the jalapeño jar instead of rice vinegar, turned out to be a great flavor with the fresh cilantro which we were liberal with.

Delicious!  If we could give this 10 stars we would!  It was very flavorful right away and didn't need any marinating time.  The lime and fresh cilantro gave it a nice zing and the sweet chili sauce was the perfect amount of heat.  I did add about double the sugar and the full lime squeezed for the juice and added in 3 sliced green onions.  Since I didn't have any coleslaw mix, I made up a mixture of thinly sliced red cabbage, lettuce, and carrot.  It was so good!  We will be having this on the side of a sweet and spicy asian style pulled pork for dinner.  But I can tell I will be making this all the time!  Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome!   I increased the amount of dressing ingredients but didn't add anything else to dressing. I did add shredded carrots and purple cabbage to the mix of fresh veggies.  This is a keeper!

This is a definite keeper.  The key to this recipe is the Thai sweet chili sauce, do not leave it out, make a run to the market if you don't have it!    It is a great side dish for anything Mexican.  I will be making this many more times!

This is my favourite coleslaw that I've ever had! I didn't have sweet chili sauce, and I don't really like overly sweet slaw anyways, so I subbed in sriracha and it's perfect. Keep this one for the coleslaw nonbelievers!

All I could taste was lime.  Wasn't that great to make again with less lime juice.  I will stick to traditional coleslaw.

I have always wanted a good delicious alternative to very creamy coleslaw that does still have a bit of creaminess to it.  This recipe seems to fit the bill.  It is a good note to taste and adjust based on what you are serving with.  The tartness of a lime is variable so that can be the difference.  I served with Ultimate chili so the lime/cilantro freshness was an excellent contrast and palate cleanser.  Would be an excellent addition to a buffet table.  I think mayo is key but I may try a mix with yogurt or sour cream in future.  Will definitely make again.

Like "Mom" said, tweaking is the fun.  Great recipe! A different, sweet-ish slaw. The onion is another change from the normal cole slaws that I've had. I'm a cilantro fan, so I was very generous what that. We had it with pork short-ribs. Excellent! (...and even better the next day!) Thanks for sharing

The best coleslaw I've ever had.  I didn't have sweet chilli sauce so used some spicy relish. Lots of compliments at the BBQ.  I had a bit leftover and it was still good the next day.  This will be a standard on my summer menus

This is my favorite slaw recipe & best slaw I've eaten. Made exactly as stated it tastes great. Also as others have pointed out, you don't have to be super exact in your measurements. As someone else commented, it is true, you should make the dressing part hours ahead & let the flavors combine & heighten then add the cabbage & toss before serving. After the 1st time you make it, you will know if you'd personally want more of any of the ingredients such as cilantro. Is there ever enough? Haha

Excellent. I added shredded carrots but other than that I followed the recipe. The whole family enjoyed this. My 13 year old thought it tasted "Mexican" because of the cilantro. The kick of the chili sauce made my hubby think it had horseradish in it so that might be a reasonable substitute if you don't have the chili sauce.

I made this exactly per the recipe.  WONDERFUL!!!!  The combo of flavored was excellent. Only change I'd make is I'd use more cabbage but that's not even a change because the recipe says "more to taste" on the ingredient list.  JUST DELICIOUS and couldn't be easier to make!!!

A very tasty recipe! I love the taste of cilantro and lime - what a great way to add flavour to cole slaw. I used only 1/2 a cup of half the fat Hellman's Mayo to cut calories, Siracha sauce in place of sweet chilli sauce, added 1/3 cup of white wine vinegar and a few drops of Stevia sweetener in place of sugar. It turned out awesome! Thanks for posting this recipe, it's a keeper.

This was a real hit with a family group.  Had to give out the recipe to many and the entire bowl disappeared quickly as people who normally pass o. The coleslaw tried it and went back fore more.

Made this for the first time and it was fabulous! Didn't add as much sugar, nor the chili sauce  but otherwise it was perfect! My husband does not like sweet coleslaw and he gave this recipe two thumbs up.  Loved the lime and cilantro combo as well as the red onions. Great combo overall. Will make this again!

I've made this several times, and it's always a hit! My only modifications are that I only use half the sugar, and almost always add extra cabbage. Be careful with the red onion, though. Sometimes, you'll get a red onion that is SUPER strong and it can kill the dish.

I followed the recipe except for substituting apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar and cutting back the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup.  I also added fresh diced pineapple. It seemed pretty good the 1st day, but the next day it was really awesome as you could taste all the flavors really well: cilantro, lime, and pineapple.

tasty - my fam liked but dh said still too mayonnaise -y.  We have varied the amount of cabbage from six cups or so to the full head of lettuce  We use all the juice of the zested lime (zest first) and use homemade chili sauce.  We use "some" cilantro - I think it is quite a bit more than called for, but this is pretty flexible.  Tasty with less cabbage but not as healthy.

We loved this Cole Slaw and it was a nice change of pace from our normal sweet recipe.  I used light mayo (the exact amount), a tad more lime juice (maybe half a teaspoon more), a sweet onion (all I had) and bagged cole slaw mix.  This was tasty upon mixing, but out of this world the next day.  Even after being in the refrigerator for 3 days, the flavors are still bright and bold.  We had this with Pulled Pork Y'all (from AR) and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We also look forward to having this the next time we have grilled fish tacos or Mexican themed turkey burgers.

I will definitely make this Cole slaw again.  I didn't have the sweet chili sauce but the slaw was excellent without it.  I added salt to taste.  My family, who are not the slaw fans that I  am, even loved it.

Great as written. We did add more lime juice at the table (had left out most of the zest mainly due to laziness). I had also omitted cilantro because dh doesn't like it, but I know it would be even better with it!  I thought cumin might be a good addition for next time, plus some other veggies like carrot and cucumber. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe several times. I used 2/3's cup of mayo and use the packaged angel hair coleslaw. I omit the sweet chili sauce and add cucumber. It is amazing! My family doesn't care for coleslaw but loves this recipe.

This was delicious! A nice change from traditional coleslaw, but not too much so that people will still enjoy it. I added more lime juice than called for, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

this was so delicious.. made a few changes  due to personal preference.. reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup greek yogurt.. left out the lime zest and doubled the lime juice (bottled).. subbed garlic chili paste for the sweet chili sauce and left out the sugar.. subbed 1/4 cup of chopped white onion (that i soaked in water for about 20 minutes to take away the bite) for the red onion.. and sprinkled a little salt at the end.. ty so much for the recipe

I love this recipe. I used extra lime juice, cilantro and hot sweet chilli sauce because duh- makes it better. The rice vinegar helps add just the right kick. I used this for red cabbage and works great. Will add a nice crunch to meat heavy meals

I get requests for this all the time!  Depending on the company,  I've added chopped jalapenos.  Goes perfectly with just about anything!  Great on pulled pork sandwiches, fish tacos,  you name it!  My husband is gluten sensitive so he just mixes it with his pulled pork!  In fact, I'm making some tonight!!!  As another reviewer stated, why bother measuring.  it's fool proof.  Oh, and it keeps for some time.

I made this for a big get-together. The main "dish" was frogmore stew, but the main talk was this slaw. Used pineapple/habanero marinade as I didn't have chili sauce. So delicious. Been asked to make it for a big bash at the racetrack.

I loosely followed the recipe. I added more fresh lime and a bit more sugar, maybe some other changes that I don't remember, but basically the same recipe. My hubs is NOT a cabbage or cole slaw fan but he loved it and so did I.  Really good.  The best I've ever eaten.  Thank you Mom for the recipe!  This is one that I'm sure we will be eating often.

Love this recipe, such a great snack! The sauce was a bit overpowering, so I add more cabbage or funny as it sounds, I add canned shredded chicken to the mix, for some extra protein. A yummy and filling snack I like to eat with my favorite cracker.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I didn't have any fresh lime so I added a splash more of lime juice, and I omitted the chili sauce. I made the dressing the previous day then mixed it right before serving and the dressing was the perfect consistency. Since it was for a large group, I tripled the dressing recipe and used three bags of the shredded cole slaw mix. Excellent.

This recipe is quite flexible and forgiving.  Using cilantro and lime is such a refreshing change from normal American cole slaw and lends itself to a lot of tweaking to adapt to various type of flavors.    

I've made this twice with some tweaks to accommodate ingredients I prefer and those on hand.  Both batches were made with apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar, reduced fat mayo, turbinado (Sugar in the Raw) and sriracha instead of sweet chili sauce.  The first batch was very good except I did not care for the lime zest, I felt it was overpowering and detracted from the slaw.  The second time, I omitted the lime zest and used the juice of one whole lime (probably 1 Tbsp) and added more sriracha (2 tsp), which I liked better but felt it was a bit too hot because of the extra sriracha.  However, I did miss the lime zest flavor a bit.  Next time I will add a bit of finely chopped lime zest (maybe half of the zest) and 1 tsp sriracha, which should be just right.  

I used this slaw with smoked brisket and smoked chicken to balance the sweet, smokiness with some acidity and herbiness (is that a word?).  Works great!

Excellent recipe.  I served it with pulled pork. I followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time I will omit the sugar and see how we like it.

I am not a huge cole slaw fan, and I thought this was pretty good! Definitely different. Made it for a family picnic, and people gobbled it up!

This is a great coleslaw! I didn't have sweet chili sauce, so I added about 1/2 t chili powder and a bit more sugar to make up for it. I also added some grated carrot and some chopped red bell pepper for a little color. This is a really creamy slaw, so if you like it a bit less creamy add more vegetables.

This recipe is wonderful! Like everyone else, my family is not a huge fan of
coleslaw, but the lime and cilantro change it up just enough! 
I made it exactly like the recipe called, but maybe added a bit more lime juice.

Very good!  My husband wanted slaw with burgers and I wanted to have some left over for fish tacos, which I love with a cilantro lime slaw.  This was perfect.  Left out the onion and chili sauce, only used 1 clove garlic and made it a bit creamier.  Delish!

My whole family loved this! Such a great retreat from the same old slaw. Was really great on shrimp tacos.

made this yesterday and followed the recipe with no changes. Really loved the fresh lime flavor and different twist on regular slaw.  I would make this again.

Perfect for chicken wonton tacos!  As suggested in the footnotes, I added more sweet chili sauce...a LOT more!  I didn't have red onion so I used scallions instead.  Also, used a bagged blend of green and purple cabbages and carrot.  There was plenty of dressing to coat a little more than 4 cups of slaw.  Yum!

Great with pulled pork.  Skipped the sweet chili sauce this time and added 1/2 poblano pepper.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and much like the original poster, I never measure anything. The first time I made it I served it over brown rice and chicken vegetable stir fry with peanut sauce, it was a hit! The next two times I put it on tacos made with soft corn tortillas ( once chicken, once steak) and Wow it is fantastic. Works well with Asian and Mexican inspired cuisine, who knows what else I'll try it with? Anyways excellent recipe great way to get in added vegetables.

I love this recipe. It's so fresh tasting even though it's not a vinegar based slaw. The only thing I added was salt and pepper. We had it with bbq chicken and EVERYONE raved about it! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!
