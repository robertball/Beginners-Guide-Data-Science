Because it began with a cake mix and because of some of the reviews, I set out to make this with low hopes and poor expectations, all of them dashed.  I was prepared for the cake to be ugly – it isn’t.  It has a pretty, golden exterior and the cake itself a delicate and pretty pastel green. Too sweet and too limey, some reviews said – nope, it’s just right.  In fact, in hindsight I would have added some grated lime zest, maybe a tablespoon.  Tastes awful, SO like a cake mix.  Wrong again.  While I don’t necessarily think it would fool anybody, it nevertheless does not have that obvious commercial cake mix taste, tho’ I’m convinced this is because I started out with a French Vanilla cake mix – better, as far as I’m concerned, than lemon, yellow or white cake mixes.  I thought maybe a cup of oil would make this heavy and greasy but it was not.  Again, I used a Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix (deliberately, as with all this oil I did NOT want a pudding-included cake mix).  I used fresh-squeezed orange juice, which really was why I chose this recipe in the first place as I had a number of oranges to use. I baked it in a Bundt pan, 325 degrees for about 55-60 minutes.  Fearful of infusing any more moisture or sweetness into the cake, I did not use the recipe’s glaze.  I used a simple powdered sugar and fresh lime juice glaze.  I’m pleasantly surprised.

I have been searching for a recipe close to my mothers lime cake for over 15 years. This is the closest I have had! I just baked it, and havent even poured the frosting on it yet. I just leveled the layers and got to nibble on some of the extra..WOW! its delish!
I did not purchase the lemon cake mix, I used yellow instead. All I had here in my pantry. And it still came out wonderful, I just added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract, when I still felt that diddnt give it enough tang I gave it 1/2 tsp of lime juice. I am going to frost it with a cream cheese frosting with a few tbls of lime thrown in. I will make this over and over. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!Edit:8/27/08- I have made this cake over and over. I have made it in a bundt pan with a lime glaze and powdered sugar over it. I have also made it into a 1/4 sheet cake by doubling the recipe, and using a cream cheese lime frosting. YUM

This recipe is awesome!  I have used it to make lemon, orange, pineapple, cherry, cranberry, raspberry and strawberry.  I think you are only limited by the flavors of Jello.

I also tried this recipe as a strawberry lemonade version by adding strawberry jello instead of lime, and lemonade instead of orange juice, and it was a hit. I baked it in a bundt pan and topped the cooled cake with coolwhip and garnished with sliced strawberries and lemon zest.

Made this for my husband to take to work.  It was devoured way before lunch and everybody wanted the recipe.  I can't eat it because I'm on the low carb diet, but from all reports, this will be a permanent addition to my dessert file.  My husband usually prefers pies over cakes, but he said to make this as often as I can.  I fixed a frosting for it with only 1 tub of cool-whip and a small box of lime jello mixed together and spread over the cooled cake.  WONDERFUL!!!!!!!

Absolutely scrumptious!  Very moist and wonderful tasting.  What a beautiful green color too.  I made this cake for work and it was gone in no time.  I love the very simple lime glaze which gives just the right finish.  I did not poke the holes in the cake.  Instead, I let the cake cool and then poured the glaze over top.  Finally, I garnished with lime twists on top for a nice presentation.  I will make this recipe over and over again! mmmm! mmmm!  p.s.  It's great FROZEN too!

This cake rocks! I baked it in a bundt pan. The only thing I changed was instead of the lime juice, I used a 6 ounce can of thawed frozen limeade concentrate & mixed that with the 2 c. powdered sugar before pouring over the cake. I also added a very tiny bit of blue paste food coloring to the orange juice mixture in the blender which made it a festive green color. My family loves this cake & it's great in the summertime or when you don't want a heavy dessert as it doesn't require any frosting!

this cake was pretty good. im not sure if it was something that i did or what, but as soon as i took it out of the oven the center caved in. and i didnt put the lime glaze on, instead i frosted it with cream cheese icing. and im glad i did, because trust me...it is sweet enough with out it. i made it for st.patricks day at work, so it worked well for that occasion. Everyone said that it was good, but it didnt get the rave reviews that my cakes in the past have recieved. i dont think i will make it again unless requested.

This recipe is definitely different! The color is fabulous, and the flavor is highly unique. I like poking only a few holes in the cake and leaving most of the glaze on top of the cake. Great recipe when you are looking to make a statement!

I had my doubts about his one (all that oil and 5 eggs and ?? Jello!??) but I had too many limes and was looking for a recipe to use some of them up.  I made this earlier today and just tasted it.  It's REALLY good!  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, this could easily be changed up using different combos of cake and jello but I really like it the way it is. I will definitely make this one again and again - it will be nice to serve in the summer on the deck. All that lime reminds me a little of Margarittas. The color is quite pretty! The glaze soaked in making the cake super moist - a little tart and a little sweet, all at once. Excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!

I served this at a party, and although I personally really enjoyed this cake, my guests were not thrilled.  I am known for making great desserts, and they all said that this was not their favorite.  The main problem people had with the cake was that the lime flavor was very overwhelming.  I however, thought it was very tasty!  To make the top a little prettier, I sprinkled powered sugar and green sprinkles on top.

I found this cake to be way to heavy.  If I made it again I'd reduce the oil to one quarter cup.

Fabulous recipe!  The only thing I changed was to bake it in a bundt pan and to add a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint when serving.  I had intended to submit a photo but the cake was DEVOURED before I knew it!  This was a hit and soooo easy to make.

I love citrus and I love cake, so I hate to say that this was just ok.  The glaze made it very sweet, but was not satisfying - it needed the cool whip or cream cheese frosting.  Probably won't make again.

Made this cake for church Saturday.  Made the glaze (halved the recipe for the glaze) and poured over warm cake.  Also took advice and put Cool Whip over the cake with lime zest and slices of lime.  Husband said cake "way too sweet."  Had hoped that the Cool Whip would bring down the sweetness--kinda had a feeling that cake would be too sweet.  Next time I eliminate the glaze and just put Cool Whip over it with the lime zest and lime slices.  The cake was not a dud though.  Smelled wonderful and was told that it was absolutely moist.  Will make it again with changes.  Still thinks it's worth 4 stars!

I thought this was ok - the flavor was good but it was hard to frost, very sticky and almost too 'wet'. If you were just going to "frost" it with cool whip I think it would be perfect.

An excellent recipe. Instead of making the glaze, I used cream cheese frosting, and it was a hit! However, if you make it in a glass pie pan, let it cool for about an hour before you try to remove it. My first attempt crumbled!

Made this for a St. Patrick's Day BBQ.. Everyone Loved It!!  I didn't have quite enough lime juice for the glaze.. so I added some orange juice.. I also added some lime gelatin to the glaze for a nice green color.

I served this for company and was very pleased.  A unique and colorful cake!  I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top and garnished with strawberries - looked like something out of southern Living magazine!

This is Awesome. I cooked it 43 minutes and it was okay but could have been cooked less time - so just keep an eye on it! Also, I topped w/ cool whip mixed w/ a little lime juice and it was delicious! Thank you :-)

VERY, VERY GOOD.  I made this for New Years Day.  It was a nice change after all the other heavy deserts for the holidays. I had used a recipe like this before but lost it. I used lemon juice instead of lime juice for the glaze. My husband and son really liked this cake.

Very good! I used yellow cake mix instead of lemon because that was all I had.

This is just like the one my mom used to make.

Surprisingly refreshing even though some people were taken aback by the color. I make cake mix from scratch and add lime juice to orange juice to give it a kick. I skipped the icing here and use cream cheese frosting with a hint of green food coloring and a table spoon of fresh lime juice. Definitely serve with plain whipped cream. This cake freezes well and I think it's even better the next day or after freezing/thawing.

Pretty good.  I used a vanilla cake (what I had) and did two round cakes for a layer cake and it turned out well.  Used box directions for a better guide to cooking time.  I also made frosting using a tub of Cool Whip and some lime Jello (as others suggested), then garnished with grated lime peel, a lime slice and sliced strawberries.  The Jello was a little granular in the Cool Whip to start, but by the time we ate it, it had dissolved.  Would make it again, but probably not because there's just too many other recipes here to try!

This recipe was a great hit with my family.  I am not a very experienced cook (meaning the recipes was very simple to follow and complete).  If you are a fruit lover or know someone who is this is going to be a big hit!

I'm not a big fan of lime anything.  I didn't really like the lime flavor.  However, the cake is very moist and I will try it again with other flavors.  I made the glaze a little thicker after I poured some of it on the cake.  This stayed on top for a little frosting and my kids ate it up.

I have made this recipe dozens of times, it is great!  You can even substitute the lemon cake mix and the lime jello for different flavors and create all kinds of great flavored cakes.  Thanks again for the recipe.

I goofed when it came to the glaze and ended up putting the half cup of lime juice in the batter.It still came out ok needed a little longer cooking time and was very moist and I used half a cup of orange juice instead for the glaze. Wow ,it sure is a delicious cake.

I put the lime zest in the batter. I used a bundt  pan and need to remember it takes longer to cool before putting on glaze. Cake was thinly glazed and the rest ended up in the hole and around the serving platter.  We will just have to scoop it out! I have used this recipe countless times since 2010. I tried the  lime cake boxed mixes and they don't come close to this recipe!

I have made this cake many times and it is always requested by co-workers.  Everyone asks for "that green cake"!  It was so popular, I never got a taste of it until I made for my family.  I misread the directions the first time I made it and have continued to make it wrong since.  i added 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice to the batter,  I put the cake in a bundt pan and drizzled a glaze of powdered sugar and lime juice over the cooled cake.  I also zest the lime and add the zest to the cake and glaze.  I have taken this to bake sales and have even sold several to co-workers to take to family reunions.

This cake was excellent.  I only used four eggs because I only had jumbo eggs on hand.  Five seemed like a lot anyway.  Next time I will cut the amount of glaze in half - that's about all I could actually get to soak into the cake and it was plenty.

I have made this cake twice in the last two weeks - the first for my son's birthday and the second for a picnic.  The first time I used raspberry jello and frozen raspberry lemonade in place of the orange juice.  I mixed the leftover lemonade with the powdered sugar for the glaze.  I think because I used the lemonade without diluting it, there was a stronger flavor.  The second time I followed the recipe as written.  Both times I made it in a bundt pan which turned out well.  Both versions were very well received.  Next time I'll try orange jello with the orange juice and glaze.  Overall, it's a very good recipe you can play around with.

This cake was a HUGE hit. It's easy and doesn't take too much time. I made it in a Bundt pan and it turned out great. It is a tan color on the outside and then bright green on the inside.

Oh, my!  This was a huge hit at my house.  I love to bake, but am not much of a sweet eater.  Let's put it this way, I ate way more than one piece of cake!  It is so easy to make and it isn't super sweet.  I used key lime juice instead of fresh lime juice.  Loved it!

A variation of this recipe has been in my family for 4 generations (originally from my great-aunt, now to my children).  It is a favorite, and always requested at our summer gatherings.  Quick, simple, yummy.

This was very good.  I did not have to cook it for as long as it stated but ovens vary so just make sure you watch it.  The whole family really enjoyed.  Next time I think I will try the cool whip like some of the others suggested but it was good as is also.

I was looking for something out of the ordinary to take to a potluck.  So I made this and it was a hit!  Very yummy and moist!  Plus the green inside is a nice break from your typical cake.

This is great and so easy to make. With a little guidance, my 9 1/2yr old son made it for dessert the other day. We topped the cooled cake with whipped topping. We are looking forward to experimenting with different flavors.
