This was delicious! I mixed two cups of arugula with some lemon juice, olive oil, and fresh ground pepper before chopping it up as the topping so it's less messy to cut and eat. YUM! Very savory recipe.

This pizza was DELICIOUS! We absolutely loved it! I actually used spinach because that is all I had on hand, and it went wonderfully with the goat cheese! And the tomatoes were an excellent touch.  I will definitely save this recipe and make it over and over again!!

This was DELICIOUS! I used a classic pesto recipe on top of a homemade unbaked crust, then a creamy cottage cheese in place of goat cheese (How much better it could be with the goat cheese!) and then grape tomatoes sliced thin. THEN, I sauteed the arugula (2 or 3 cups) in some olive oil and butter and placed that on top of the pizza before baking it. It was so good.  Had leftovers for lunch today. I can't wait to make this again with goat cheese!

This was simply fabulous!  I also chopped the arugula and tossed it with a little olive oil, lemon juice and pepper.  I also only used about 2 oz. goat cheese and sprinkled it over the pizza to save a few calories.  It was wonderful and I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

SO GOOD!!!  Goat cheese and arugula are 2 of my favorite ingredients, so this recipe was right up my alley!  I used a thin crust pizza dough, so it was more 'flat bread pizza' than traditional pizza.  I also used only 4-5oz goat cheese (plain, not seasoned) and that was enough.  I only needed 2 roma tomatoes b/c my crust was on the smaller side, and I took other recommendations and tossed the arugula with lemon juice, EVOO, salt, and pepper before topping the pizza, and I think that made it even better!  Oh, and save yourself all the hassle and use minced garlic instead of cutting garlic yourself!  Cannot wait to make this again!!

Overall a tasty recipe. I took the advice of someone else by cutting up my greens and tossing them in lemon & pepper before putting on pizza. Definitely think that added something extra. 
Would try homemade pizza dough next time. Not the fault of the recipe but the pre-made crust was certainly lacking.

I agree- way too much goat cheese.  I think 4 ounces would be enough.  I couldn't find seasoned, so it was just regular goat cheese.  Upon other readers suggestions, I did toss the arugala with lemon juice, evoo and a little salt and pepper.  I also added some sliced black olives.  Pretty good but nothing totally amazing.  It is a nice change from regular pizza though and a great use for pesto.

Made this last night and it was great. Used Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust, baked until brown. I skipped the pesto becauce of the high calorie and fat content, and used a very thin layer of red sauce, maybe only two tbsp. I added caramelized onions because that is my favorite pizza ingredient. Used four to five ounces of goat cheese that I crumbled evenly across tbe pizza and sprinkled a small handful of pizza cheese over it. Two roma tomatoes and a few handfuls of arugula after it came out of the oven. An easy and deliciosly different pizza that is not too heavy like manh pizzas.

A great recipe. As others did, I used flatbread. I also upped the protien by adding diced chicken and a bit of bacon, plus a bit of diced onion. Sounds overkill but each flavour was present and simply delicious! Preparing your own pesto with fresh basil is also a nice touch :)

This is very easy, but very good.  I love goat cheese, but for the people that don't love it quite so much, I have made this with cream cheese with just a few sprinkles of goat cheese.  They seem to really like it without realizing what they are eating. I also buy extra thin pizza crust.  Even men love this one.

A huge hit at recent party I hosted. Pefect in 20 minutes at 400f degrees. I also used spinach leaves in lieu of the arugula. My goat cheese was seasoned with rosemary.

I love the pesto sauce!!  Very strong tasting pizza.  I put spinach on top instead.  Taste is a bit too strong for me.  I'd make it again but with more tomatoes and less goat cheese

Amazing. I made homemade pizza crust (thin) and homemade pesto (have tons of basil the garden). I also used cherry tomatoes from the garden. This pizza was fantastic, perfect medley of flavors, they worked  together phenomenally. I highly recommend this recipe.

This pizza was really good. I was looking for something without tomato sauce on it (my father is allergic) and this fit the bill perfectly. A word of caution, you need to really like goats cheese as it is very strong.

Great, easy recipe for a quick Friday night at home. I followed another reviewer's recommendation and used 4 oz. of goat cheese and it was great. Drain the pesto so it doesn't have a lot of oil, mine had too much and ran over so the oven was a mess. Other than that, yeah!

This was so good I had to have it twice in a row - dinner and lunch the next day!  Instead of arugula, I topped the pizza with chopped baby spinach that I tossed with lemon juice, EVOO and S&P.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!

I used flatbread for a crust so reduced the other ingredients by about 1/3 to accommodate the smaller sized crust. A nice change from regular pizza.

This was delicious!!!!  I did make it without the arugula, because I could not find any where I live, but it was still so good.  The only reason why I put the 4 starts was because I made it without the arugula.

I admit that I'm a pepperoni and mushroom pizza kinda girl, but even I thought this was pretty darn good. Apart from using sliced grape tomatoes, and also adding a little cracked black pepper, I made this as written - not bad at all! I still prefer a red sauce base, but this was really nice for a change. Thanks!

I will def make this again!  I used the garlicky nan bread from Trader Joes, spinach, homemade pesto, mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, parm cheese and goat cheese.  I also put little bits of country ham on it.   I cooked it in a cast iron skillet for almost 20 minutes.  I put the bread in the skillet as it was warming up to 400 and then I flipped it and put the toppings on.

I have to rate this because I made it the other day, but used my own pizza crust, and my husband LOVED it!  I make pizza all the time and he said this his favorite!  Great combination of toppings!

So easy and delicious! I splurged and bought some prosciutto from the deli to add to this pizza, also used half the recommended amount of goat cheese, and a spring mesclun mix instead of straight arugula.  I tossed the greens with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar before adding to the top.

Really, really, really good. I was lazy and used the (not so great) Pillsbury pizza dough and it still came out great. I did not precook the dough and it came out more like a thin crust. The mix of flavors is amazing!! If you're going to splurge on any of the ingredients, go for the best pesto you can find.

OMG this is outstanding even my husband liked it.  Used Pilsbury thin crust, pre baked 5 minutes cooled put toppings on and baked.  Next time I am going to try it without pre baking, which will give tomatoes longer in oven.

I reduced the goat cheese to 6 oz as other suggested to our tastes and did as others recommended and toss the arugula with garlic, EVO, lemon juice and smitchen of salt.

My favorite new recipe! Used some tips such as 4 oz goat cheese, tossed Arugula in lemon pepper(found this in Wal-Mart in a mix Arugula and Baby Spinach container). Thin crust worked great. It skyrocketed to one of my favorite quick meals! Not expensive, quick to make, and relatively healthy. FIVE!

This is AMAZING. My fiancé and I are doing “Meatless Mondays” (to his dislike), and so I tried this recipe.  Wow, it was so good.  I used thin pizza crust, which adds the crisp and crunch that made the recipe taste so good.  I also made homemade pesto in the food processor - SO easy and you can freeze portions so you can make the pizza on the fly on a weeknight again and again.  I have made the recipe twice now – once with sautéed mushrooms and 4 ounces of goat cheese topped with arugula tossed in lemon and salt/pepper.  The second was with sautéed zucchini, mushrooms, and 4 ounces goat cheese topped with spinach tossed in lemon and salt/pepper.  Both were stellar.  Presentation is great – could be served as an appetizer too.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

Very good. I made this for a last minute dinner and it was very well recieved. I love goat cheese more than almost any other cheese, so I knew this was gonna be a hit. Didnt change a thing other than the cooking time because my dough was still reaalllllyyy soft. Thank you for the great recipe.

Wow - yum!! This pizza is incredibly tasty. My local grocery store doesn't carry uncooked pizza dough or arugula (and its a Lucky for cryin' out loud!), so I used a local focaccia bread for the crust and baby spring mix for the topping. The focaccia was AMAZING as a crust--highly recommended if you can get the good stuff. Sring mix was fine, though I preferred the bites that had arugula, so I'd recommend using just that if you can get it. Also, though it's harder to work with (read: messy), try took look for chevre rather than feta, as most feta in the states is actually cow's milk. I really think a good goat's milk cheese is key!

I liked this. I had two pizza bases, so made one pizza as written here (except I only used just over 1/2 a pack of goat feta as that covered the base), and the other using bits and pieces of what I had about to change up this recipe somewhat. The pizza as is got a 4 - it was good but felt it a little lacking.  I rate the second pizza 4.5*. Some changes weren't so good, but I think this base recipe with the following changes would make a 5* meal: mushrooms instead of tomato (makes for a heartier pizza without adding meat), a second cheese on top (I used some Parmesan but would consider mozzarella instead next edition), KEEP the arugula - subbing for spinach just does not cut it, and finally, toss the arugula is a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to give it a bit of dressing. Can't wait for next pizza night to try this again.

Good !!! I did add shaved Parmesan and red pepper flakes on top of tomatoes .. Which gave it quite a delightful "kick" and the arugula with lemon , salt and pepper that another reviewer added was awesome .. My vegan daughter loved it !!!!!!

Wow! Absolutely the best pizza we've made and certainly in the top 10 best no-meat pizzas ever.   I added a bit of  lemon juice and EVOO to chopped up arugula.  When pizza was almost done I pulled it out THEN added the arugula and put under the broiler for less than 2 minutes to wilt it a bit.  Unbelievably good. Oh and I used the pillsbury prepared thin crust dough which turned out great.

This is a great, fresh, light pizza.  I definitely recommend mincing the garlic and plain goat cheese is just fine (no need to overpower the pesto sauce with seasoned goat cheese).  Also, I only used about 5 ounces of goat cheese and the flavor was great.

Amazing! Used Valentino's Pizza Crust and Pesto Sauce from AR. I couldn't find seasoned goat cheese so I added fresh parsley, dried oregano, and s/p. Other than than that, made exactly as is.

Love this! I used 4 ounces of plain goat cheese, minced the garlic, and tossed the arugula in lemon juice, salt and pepper before topping the pizza with it. I also salted the tomato slices, let them sit for 10-15 min or so to get some of the moisture out, and then blotted them with a paper towel. This helped keep the crust from getting soggy or adding any extra moisture to the pizza. It seasons the tomatoes up nicely too! This was even better the next day straight from the fridge.

This is very good.  I made it on flatbread and cooked it at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.

Don't change a thing! This recipe is absolute simple gourmet deliciousness. Oh but if you do change one thing, I'd half baby grape tomatoes instead of slice roma tomatoes, it would look cuter I think. Also DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT saute the arugula people! It would take away from the fresh crisp brightness the arugula lends to the pizza. Enjoy!

Excellent!!! I did just use a pilsbury crust but I pre-baked it and spread it thin. I tossed the chopped arugula w/ olive oil and lemon as some of the reviewers recommended.

This was ok- made it for a quick late dinner. I only had regular goat cheese and a crappy pillsbury crust, so that probably affected my end result. I might try again with better crust and the seasoned goat cheese (if I can find it).

Delicious! What a great change of pace from regular pizza. I followed the recipe above and did the whole lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper on the arugula (as many suggested) which made it that much more fresh and tangy. Huge hit in my house!

I didn't have pizza dough so I used this recipe on macaroni  (about 10 oz., not a full pound) and it was Great! I changed a couple of things: 1) I didn't use any tomatoes; 2) I didn't use arugula but instead used a handful of baby spinach which I cut up and mixed w/1 teaspoon lemon juice and very small amount of evoo, salt & pepper and only 1 crushed garlic clove (I gently steamed this over the boiling macaroni by putting it in a small pot and balancing on a flat strainer on top of the boiling macaroni pot; 3) I used only about 4 oz. of goat cheese. This was delicious! Mixed everything into the macaroni as soon as it was strained. The cheese melted and it all came together. Delicious.
