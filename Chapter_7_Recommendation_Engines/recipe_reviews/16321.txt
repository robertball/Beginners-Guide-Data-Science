I thought these burgers were pretty good, but not "southern" as the name implies.  I used dijon mustard, 1/4 c. of plain bread crumbs, 1 tsp. of garlic powder vs. garlic salt and used 1/4 tsp. each of salt and pepper.  We grilled them and put them on toasted sesame rolls with cheddar cheese, lettuce, roasted tomato, thin sliced red onion, and little mayo.  They were very juicy.

These are the only way i am going to make burgers now.  My 4 yr old ate 2 of them and wanted more!  These were the best and the moistest burgers I have ever made.  I also added tome steak seasoning like I always do and I used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and added a little bit of liquid smoke.

This burger doesn't sound too Southern.  It might be a meatloaf burger.

These were good, a bit too much worcestershire sauce.  I pan fried these babies but they didn't completely hold together as well as I hoped.  I use 93% lean ground beef.

These were very flavorful. I added extra breadcrumbs as it needed it to hold the burgers together. Also added some finely diced pickles instead of using them as a topping. The mustard really gives it a flavour hit. Thanks.

This was an alright burger. It has alot of flavor but it lost the burger flavor with everything in it. But so ppl know, i have a trick to keeping homemade burgers together... After you form them put them back in the fridge for about 15 - 30 min before cooking them. It always helps me with keeping them together!

This is a good burger. I would have rated it a five, but it doesn't stick together when cooking. I cut the cooking time in half, and it was still cooked all the way through. Thanks!

These are just average.  They are meatloaf burgers not really hamburgers.  Even the great American chef James Beard's favorite hamburger recipe is a meatloaf burger.  Anytime you add this much stuff to the meat it becomes meatloaf.  Mine also did not stick together, but I thawed the meat in the microwave.  To make them stick together better, try using fresh - never frozen - hamburger.  Or, at least, don't thaw the meat in the microwave.

Yummy! The second time I made these, I added chopped onion to the mix and also cooked them in the oven broiler instead of the frying pan.   I made 4-5 patties, not 7 like the recipe called for, they would have been way too small!

Very good base recipe for hamburgers. As others said, it's kind of a meatloaf burger (which my husband LOVES).  I added two eggs instead of one, since I used previously frozen ground beef which never wants to stick together for me.  Next time I think I will add in some cooked bacon and onion to make it even more savory.

This was pretty good in terms of flavour, but they did not hold together very well.  In the future, I will probably use a different recipe but add some of the flavours from this one.

this is a great recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and seasoned bread crumbs instead of slice of bread.  Also mixed in chopped onions.  What a great hamburg with alot of flavor.

I used 96/4 lean ground beef, omitted the salt, used garlic powder, and used bread crumbs.  These are very moist burgers.  The Worcestershire sauce gave it a wonderful flavor.  Thanks!

Super easy and my family LOVED them. I added two eggs because I had more than a pound of beef. My burgers did not fall apart but I also had fresh not frozen ground beef. I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. Will definitely make these again!!!!!!

The burgers were pretty tasty but the main reason I gave it 1 star only is because it really didn’t stick together. It fell apart and so was hard to eat.

I added a tablespoon of steak sauce and diced onion. It was delicious! I'm sure it would have still been yummy without the addition. (sub'd a 1/4c breadcrumbs for the slice of bread)

This recipe was similar to the way I already made burgers but the addition of mustard and using real bread where a nice touch. I think if you use garlic salt you should skip on the regular salt, but otherwise delicious.  Will be making this again.

For more flavour, I add some grated onion and 1/4 beef stock cube and, after making the patties, chill in fridge for an hour.

It was delicious. I made mine into sliders and I loved them. I did use 2 slices of ancient grain bread and they stuck together well. They will definitely be made again.

I doubled the recipe and used dijon instead of regular mustard and substituted a slice of bread for about a cup and a half of breadcrumbs.
