Very delicious!  Don't be afraid of the lemon extract, it just adds a delicate touch of flavor to the cakes.  I had more batter left over in the fridge and they fried up perfectly the next day.  I did not need quite as much oil as the recipe called for.

Well, I've been searching for a perfect funnel cake recipe, and took me a while to get around to trying this one because it only had 4 stars, but this is the BEST funnel cake I've ever made!  I used a clean, empty, pancake syrup bottle to squeeze out the funnel cakes easily into the oil.  Saw them use that at Knott's Berry Farm actually.  Topped with powdered sugar, strawberries (mixed with white sugar), and whipped cream.  AMAZING!  I'll never be able to spend money on them at theme parks and fairs again!

We love this at my house. Kinda messy, but worth it. My kids enjoyed seeing what shapes they could make drizzling the batter, but of course I stayed right there (hot oil!) A fun, old fashioned, economical treat. Think I'll make some spider web shaped ones for Halloween! It's easy if you use a squirt bottle for drizzling the batter. It makes thinner strands that way.

I just used this recipe for the kids at a Memorial Day cook-out and boy was it a success. Not only for the kids but the parents also, it really took us back to our carnival days.
Thank you for a great recipe

Although my family liked this recipe, I did not care for it.  I thought the batter was too sweet.  Also, I had to add a bit more milk.  For those reasons, I only gave it 3 stars.  I may fix it again for my family, probably, I will use a tradtional recipe, though.

I don't know if I did something wrong but this did not work for me and I was SO excited.  Once I got the oil temperature right the batter taste was not good and not light and airy like at the carnivals.  Guess that's where I will continue to get them... :)
