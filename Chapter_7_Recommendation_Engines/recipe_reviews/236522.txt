Loved the idea of these, but the filling turned out quite runny, and for us, there wasn't enough 'buffalo' flavor. I also think  these would've been better with some crumbled blue cheese either inside or on top. These were nice to try for something different, though. Thanks for sharing. :)

We are eating these as we speak, we like them! I didn't use the paprika or celery and had to add a little more ranch and a little more buffalo sauce which made it kind of too thin but we enjoyed these and will be making it again thanks for the recipe!
