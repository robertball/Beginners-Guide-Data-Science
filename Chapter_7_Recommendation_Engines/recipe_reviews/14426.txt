I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  The lime dressing is very light and a perfect compliment to the melon and watercress!

A little bit bizarre. It was worth trying once though.

LOVE THIS! I had just picked up some watercress and wanted to do something light to go with dinner.  I added honey instead of sugar to the dressing and ginger powder instead of fresh.  SO yummy! The best part is, it can be changed during the season.  I think I might try it with peaches next.  Thank you for sharing!

I like lime vinegarette, but I didn't like this one....tried to figure out why. It is too tart for the fruit. I want enough lime to make it "bright" but not actually "tart" and this one was "tart". I looked at my other lime vinegarette dressing recipe to see what was different. My other one has 1 TB of honey in it..so I added 1 TB on honey and tasted it. Much better. I will just keep my previous lime dressing though.

Delicious. I love it. Try putting coconut sugar in instead of white sugar. Love it.

As recommended by another reviewer, I used honey instead of sugar.  I also substituted toasted pecans for the almonds because that is what I had on hand.  Brought this salad to a dinner party.  Everyone wanted to take some home.  Such a fresh dish with sweet, salty, acid and the radish-like spice of the watercress.  Thank you for sharing.

This was lunch today with a cup of mushroom soup.  The lime brings a little bit of tartness to the dressing and the fresh ginger gives it just the right amount of zing.  I did cut back on the amount of oil to reduce the fat grams, otherwise, followed the recipe.  Good salad loaded with bright and fresh flavors.  Donâ€™t skip the almonds, as they give you another dimension of flavor.  Thanks, Barrett, for a refreshing salad.
