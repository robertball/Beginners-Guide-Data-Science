Disappointed. After all the great reviews, I can't say this was a hit. Peanut Butter topping was nothing special. The cake itself was very good and quite moist. By the way 10 tablespoons of butter is a smidge under 2/3 of a cup. UPDATE: I just frosted the cake with Butter Cream! MUCH BETTER!

Very good once I followed the recipe in full.  I tried to get off easy by not broiling but the icing was much too grainy that way.  I also stirred chocolate and peanut butter chips into the cake batter and sprinkled some on the top.

This cake is so moist!!! I made it for my mother's birhtday and my grandmother came over and said that it wasn't too sweet but not too sour either, it was just right!!! All of us, my grandmother, mother and I all LOVE peanut butter and the only thing better than peanut butter is peanut butter with chocoate! THANKS!!!!!!!!

My family and I really liked this cake. I didn't make the frosting. The cake was moist and not overly sweet. The texture had a fudgey feel. I can't wait to make this with a cream cheese frosting. Or maybe caramel and pecan topping. The possibilities are endless. With the cake not being too sugary it allows to play with different toppings that may be heavy on sweetness. The prep time was quick and it's kid friendly too. I think a little cinnamon in the batter would give it a little zing! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm only rating the frosting here ( I used another wacky chocolate cake recipe).  As written,  I found the frosting recipe yields a grainy texture, not to mention the peanut butter taste was a bit intense. It just wasn't creamy enough for me and I didn't want to put the entire cake back in the oven to broil so instead I followed the recipe up until the last step then added 1/2 package cream cheese. Creamed this together, then frosted the cake (obviously omitting the broiler). It was delicious this way.

I want to give this a lower rating, but people at work claimed to have liked it so I guess I can give a little credit. I followed this recipe word for word, whereas I typically make my own changes.  I was terribly disappointed when the cake began to darken around the edges and the middle was still raw.  The frosting was a mess, too- I didn't have much trouble with managing it under the broiler, but I was not impressed with how runny and grainy it was.  It ran everywhere and just didn't seem at all frosting-y.

I just made a Devil's Food cake from a mix, and then spread on the peanut butter icing, and sprinkled with mini-chocolate chips. Sooo yummy! My family of 8 gobbled it up in one sitting.

Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. The Amish make a cake very similar to this and its impossible to find a peanut butter ICING. All you can find is frosting, which I didn't want.  A few things I would do differently next time. I would cook the icing in a saucepan instead of putting it under the broiler, and then pour it on the cake. The recipe doesn't say the broiler level (hi/lo) nor does it say for how long. So I put it on lo and checked it every minute. Well, it burned a little on top. I had to scrape the burnt part off.  I also think I'll add more peanut butter to the recipe because the brown sugar overpowered the taste a little. Plus I think it needed more icing overall.   But this will be my go-to recipe for this cake. I had been searching for it forever and my husband loves it!

I had a small gathering which the neighbor kids helped me prepare for.  The 12 year-old girl made the cake and it was delicious.  We decided to get REALLY wacky and added chocolate and peanut butter morsels to the cake and the peanut butter topping. We also threw in some marshmallows and toffe bits.  It was delish!

The cake itself is very moist and my family loved it.  The frosting didn't turn out so well for me.  It was like sticky hard candy/burnt sugar .  I found it difficult to chew and it wasn't very peanut buttery by that time.  It's possible it was under the broiler too long, but I did follow the directions to place it under broiler until brown and bubbly.  Either way, I scraped off the frosting and made another peanut butter frosting recipe from the site that was more conventional and pleased the family.  Great cake and super easy!  Thanks.

I made this cake for my fifteenth birthday this year, and my entire family seemed to enjoy it. In fact, my aunt recently rated this recipe. I would definitely suggest this cake and icing recipe for anyone's birthday. Especially a child's.

How could this get a bad review?!? Absolutely amazing recipe. The chocolate cake was just as moist as everyone raved about. I added reese's peanut butter chips and chocolate chips to the batter. I also added rees's peanut butter cups chopped on top. Might have been a little over kill but everyone who tried it said it was the best cake they had ever had. I will use the chocolate cake recipe with different frosting just for fun next time. Thank you for the great recipe!

I have to say I am reviewing it without trying the frosting.  Made a half batch if the cake in an 8 x 8 pan and baked for 25 minutes.  It was really good and moist, like the Wacky cakes I've tried in the past.  I love frosting but I really don't think this cake needs it.  Mine was a little taller than I would prefer.  Also gotta add - this is cheap to make!

I did not make this Exact recipe but I have a recipe almost identical which I have used frequently for the past decade or so [I am only 22 also] The best chocolate cake, I always make it for friend's birthdays.  The delightful thing about it is it can easily be made vegan! [shhh :D] - just use coconut oil or something instead of butter. Have not tried the peanut butter frosting though - Sounds delicious!

I made this (double recipe) for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  It was a huge hit!  Very moist!! If you follow the recipe and directions exactly; there is no way that this would not be a great cake!  I used large cake pans so the baking time needed a bit of adjusting; but the cake was fantastic!  I used a peanut butter frosting (not this frosting as the reviews were mixed) but the recipe is off this site and it was a huge hit! Will be making again I'm sure with 2 little girls in the house!

pretty good.  The cake was awesome.  The frosting was good.  I used crunchy peanut butter, and i didn't care for the nuts.  Both my kids requested this cake for their birthdays.

I made this for work birthday party and everyone loved it.  Next time I make it, I will double the recipe for the icing, add half while the cake is warm and punch holes in the cake. Then when it cools I will cover it with the second batch and broil it.

This recipe for the cake was delicious, but the icing...not so much.  I tried it again using powdered sugar (more than 1 cup though...just kept adding until it was the right consistency)and it was superb!!!  Hope this helps!

My family loves this cake!  I misread the directions and added 1/4 cup of Peanut Butter to the batter and it was still delicious.  I used a different icing the 2nd time I made it.  I didn't care for the grainy texture with the brown sugar.

This cake tastes amazing! So moist and fudgey! I didn't make any differences to the recipe, with the exception of leaving out the frosting. I just frosted the cake with chocolate frosting and put twix bits on top. It was great!

I made this for hubby's b-day and everybody loved it. It was really good the day I made it, but even better the next day. Next time I'll make a day in advance. I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used "fluffy peanut butter frosting" from this site and that went really well.

Delicious! My husbands new favorite! The frosting burned after 3 minutes; had to scrape it off and only broiled for 2 minutes the second time- was perfect. Very moist cake, even after a few days.

Actually the cake is about 4&1/2 stars, very good. The topping, about three. If you really like peanut butter, it is good. I made this for my daughters birthday, and it was different, not a hit, but well recieved! As a note, do the broiling, it makes a huge difference, makes the topping crispy and gooey. Similiar to a toasted marshmallow.

In my opinion the only good thing about this was that the cake was moist. The icing was not very good either.  I'm not sure why everyone gave this recipe such a great review, maybe my tastebuds are REALLY different.

This cake was great! Moist but not gunky, & very rich & satisfying. For me it made 24 servings. I made a couple of changes: reduced both kinds of sugar slightly (but I still found the icing a bit on the sweet side), threw in some choc covered & roasted peanuts & didn't bother with broiling it. Very good indeed!

The cake was very moist and tasty, but the topping was not what I expected.  If I make it again, I will try a peanut butter buttercream type frosting.

My now "15" year old niece picked out this recipe and made it for her birthday.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  The  peanut butter frosting on top is light and crunchy.  The best cake I've had in a long time!!!

Very moist, perfect amount of chocolate, I did end up sprinkling some butterscotch chips on top of the batter before I put it in the oven, it ended up baking into the top and middle so when you cut into it it explodes with butterscotch, yum! 
I did however have some trouble with the frosting. while it tastes great,  it was so runny it fell mostly into the sides of the dish so part of the cake was exposed. it wasn't the prettiest cake once baked given the frosting issues but it tasted amazing!!!!!!( I suppose if my cake was too hot still that explains that problem) I also only baked it for about 25 minutes, as it was perfectly done at that time.

I loved how the cake part turned out... I confess I used a different frosting which was just okay... but the cake part of this was outstanding... super moist... and NO EGGS - that was the great part... These would do well as cupcakes also...

Pretty good cake. It is extremely moist and rich. I followed the recipe exactly and ate it warm out of the oven. It's almost like a pudding cake. The combination of the cake and the frosting is very, very sweet.

This is a very easy cake to make, and the results are excellent.  The cake is moist and dense, and the icing is a perfect complement to the cake.  I had a little trouble with the icing since I wasn't sure how close to put the pan to the broiler.  Finally I just kept moving it around until the icing got browned. You have to be careful not to burn it by leaving it in one place.  Browning the icing gives it a nice caramelized taste.

Perfect!  The cake was moist and brownie like- very rich.  Perfect with a glass of milk.  I added chocolate chips and made it in a round springform.  The frosting was awesome before and after putting it in the broiler.  I will definitely make this again as it was so super easy and everybody loved it.

I cooked this recipe as written. I used real butter. Everyone really liked it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I felt it staled by the second day. Still tasted good, it was just slightly stale and I thought it rather quick to stale.

This is an excellent cake, created exactly as written (however, due to taking it for a distant potluck, I could not broil the frosting).  The icing had a looser texture which went over very well as far as taste, maintaining the integrity of the cake instead of pulling it apart into crumbs, and just for appearance.  The cake had an excellent flavor, truly one of the best scratch cakes I've made, and it was remarkably easy to make.  I did make another one in 2 round cake pans and it was just as great as the sheet cake- I did double the icing to fit on all that cake surface and it looked beautiful and delicious.  All things considered, one of the better recipes I have tried!

Loved the cake. But made a little different icing that didnt require the use of a broiler.
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons milk
2 cups powdered sugar 
Put butter and peanut butter into a  bowl, and beat with an electric mixer. Gradually mix in the sugar, until a little thick, add  milk one tablespoon at a time until all is mixed in and the frosting is thick and spreadable. Beat for at least 4 minutes for it to get fluffy.

I made the cake without the topping and used the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this site instead. I wanted a more traditional cake and the reviews implied the peanut butter topping was not ideal. Anyway, the cake itself was delicious. It turned out like a mild, brownie-ish cake and, with the Frosting, was absolutely prefect. Will make again.

Yum!  The peanut butter icing will be grainy if you don't follow the recipe and broil it.  How long you need to broil it depends on what temperature you have your broiler set and how close you have the cake to the broiler.  Watch it carefully--at 400 degrees, mine took less than three minutes to bubble and brown.

Very deep and chocolatey taste with a rich dense texture. I used Stevia instead of white sugar, and warmed the topping in the microwave until it was smooth. Put it under the broiler for 2 minutes and then topped with mini Reese's pieces once it was cool. I don't love the icing so I would skip it next time. I might make the cake again with regular sugar to see if there's any noticeable difference.

This is a nice moist and dense cake.  Not enough chocolate flavor for me. Maybe some mini chocolate chips would help. The frosting didn't do a thing for me. It had a weird consistency. Maybe the whole thing would be improved if it had a better frosting.

I was going to give this recipe four stars because I felt as if it were lacking flavor after I initially made but decided against it. It was super easy first off and didn't call for any eggs. You could throw this cake together in an instant! After it sat all night and I tasted it the next day I noticed that the flavors had time to enhance and I thought that it tasted better. It reminded me of a box cake, but better of course!! I didn't use the frosting recipe that it called for, I used the fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe from this site. The cake was really moist, light and fluffy. I added pure vanilla extract to the wet ingredients for adding them to the dry. I would recommend giving this a try, it's worth it!

This is a great cake! I cant comment on the peanut butter icing (didnt make it) but the cake itself is just right; not super sweet but chocolatey and almost gooey it is so moist!  I used the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting on this site. GREAT!!

I absolutely loved this cake! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he and his family loved it too, it's a constant request now =) I also used peanut butter chips on top (and in the batter) instead of messing with the frosting and broiler

I made the cake part only and didn't even try the topping after reading the reviews and it was awsome! I made my own Peanut butter icing.

This chocolate cake is awesome. I really wanted to give it 5 stars but we did not like the topping! But lets get back to the cake. What an easy recipe that doesn't even take many ingredients and it makes a 9x13! And you don't have to worry about 'sampling' the batter. My husband stubbled across this recipe for my birthday cake. He made it first and it turned out great (exept for the topping). This cake is now one of my favorites!!! Just use regular icing or none at all.

The flavor was pretty good and very different.  I added a little more peanut butter since I'm a peanut butter freak.  The cake was so incredibly dry that I almost choked trying to swallow!  I will try this one again but a little differently, so as to not have the cake so dry.

Very Moist and chocolatey!  It was like eating a cake/brownie with yummy peanut butter icing.  I followed someones advice and I only broiled it for 3minutes,--4minutes may have been better.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it!  Be careful about the frosting though, we burned it the first time in the broiler, and had to scrape it off.  The second time it was done perfectly in about 3 minutes.

I used a different icing, but the cake was very good. Very chocolatey, and it didn't taste stale as others said.  I've made it twice now and both times it was excellent.
