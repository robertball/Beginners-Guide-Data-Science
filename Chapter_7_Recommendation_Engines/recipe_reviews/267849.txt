I made this for Thanksgiving because I thought roasting the sweet potatoes might give them a more complex flavor.  While that might have been true, any benefits were overwhelmed by the  super sweetness of the dish.  One person even said it tasted like a dessert.   Disappointing.

It was very good but a bit too sweet. Might try it again with less sugar.

Super easy to make.  Family loved it at Thanksgiving.  Wish it had more precise measurements other than 3 medium sweet potatoes.  Used one sweet potato and it was enough for 1 serving for 9 people
