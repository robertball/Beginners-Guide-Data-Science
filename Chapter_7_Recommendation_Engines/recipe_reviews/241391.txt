I feel like the flavor balance is off. It could be very tasty, but it is so salty that I could barely finish my serving. I added broccoli to put in some veg. The flavors that are good are very good. It is just undermined by the salt.

I have some of the marinade left. I think adding some acid and sweetness may help balance out the salt of the fish sauce. Iâ€™m going to throw in some honey and rice vinegar. See if that kicks it up without masking all the original flavors.
