OMG!  I added a generous sprinkle of cajun seasoning, a squirt of hot sauce and some smoked sausage, and it was absolutely delicious.  Served it with cornbread, which absolutely put it over the top.

I make this alot in the winter for my family. Only difference from the original recipe is that I use dry black eyed peas, that is soaked overnight, and add either a spicy Italian or bulk sausage, or some cubed ham, and a splash of liquid smoke. Fix up a castiron skillet of homemade cornbread and you got a meal! This will be a part of our New Year's Day dinner.

This gumbo is excellent. The flavor is perfect without all the spices other reviewers felt they needed to add. I did use two cans of rotel tomatoes (instead of one rotel, one regular diced tomatoes) and omitted the celery (not a fan). I added carrots for color. I also cooked it at very low heat for much longer than recipe indicated, which may have accounted for the rich flavor. This was a big hit....served with corn bread as suggested. Yum.

This is a great wintertime dish.  I prepared this dish for a family function that I was hosting.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it.  I added 3 cans of black-eyed peas instead of 4.  I also added creole seasoning, salt and pepper, beef smoked sausages (cut into bite sized pieces) and a cup of cooked pasta to the recipe.  I forgot to add the green peppers but it didn't matter because it was great without it.  My husband advised me that this is a "keeper."  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  We will enjoy it from now on.

Wow!  This was good.  And healthy, which is always nice.  I only added the can of tomatoes with jalapenos, not the plain can of tomatos.  Instead, I added a box of frozen okra.  I also added a tablespoon of creole seasoning mix (from this website) and some salt.  Also about 2 cups of extra water.  Mmm, mmm, good!  I served it with Texas Spoonbread (yet another recipe from this site).  We will definitely be having this again.

As is, this recipe is very bland and that's even after we added a ham hock during the cooking.  However, once we added Tabasco, Worcestershire sauce, and salt it was pretty good.  Definitely needs additional spices.

I am always looking for healthy recipes that my 3 and 5 year olds, my husband, and I will like, and this was a hit for all! I did add turkey kielbasa a the end, and next time, I will not cook the onion, celery, and peppers with the rice (they got too mushy). Thank you!

This recipe is definitely easy and delicious.  We like it a little less spicy, so I used more regular diced tomatoes in place of the tomatoes with chilies, and added chili powder to spice it up to where we wanted it.  We loved the rice in it, and it was great with cornbread.

Good, but I had to add spices-- I added 2 tsp of Creole seasoning and 1 tsp of cayenne, but that was too much cayenne, so if I were to do it again, I'd do half. I had some dried black eyed peas to use instead, so I soaked them for 4 hours and then simmered them for around 45 minutes before making the gumbo. Since I didn't have the liquid from the cans to use, I doubled the chicken broth. The end result was seriously spicy, but filling and easy.

Fantastic recipe. I needed to make several subsitutions:  1. Could not find canned black eyed peas so I used a 1lb bag of dried beans boiled in 6.5 cups of water until tender (about 45 minutes). It turns out to be about 3 cans worth, so I added 2 cups of frozen sweet corn in lieu of the fourth can (for great flavor and texture too).  2. Like other people mentioned, this recipe came out too thick, thicker than most chili's I've had. Instead of all the diced tomatoes, I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. In addition, I wound up adding about 2 cups of extra liquid (beef broth is what I had) to thin the gumbo out just a little.  3. Forgot to buy celery so I omitted that, I used 3 cloves of garlic because you can never have enough, and I used barley instead of brown rice (great texture!).  4. Finally, I added about 1 Tbsp of hot pepper sauce (Sriracha is my favorite) which added a ton of flavor and just a touch of spice. I then add a few dashes to each bowl I eat since I can handle more spice.   Otherwise, this recipe made a ton of food! Make sure you have some freezer space or plan to eat it for a few nights. An excellent nutritious and filling meal served with cornbread.

Very good...used 1 can of onion pepper diced tomatoes and 1 can tomatoes with zesty jalepenos and substituted vegetarian broth for chiken broth. I couldn't find black eyed peas in a can -- bought frozen instead. To my husband's dish, I added mexican sausage browned in some oil. My veggie version was good and he found his sausage version quite yummy too. Very filling.

This is good, and healthy! I make this for my husband as he's on a high protein diet to gain more mass (started weightlifting again). I did change a few things: some spices (cumin, pepper, thyme, paprika), a little more onion and garlic, some green onion, carrots, and mushrooms, omitted the green chiles, and used the dry beans that you soak overnight instead of the canned ones. I also add a little bit of beer about 500g of lean braising steak, which I cut into 4cm pieces and seared first. I slow cook it for about 2 hours, so the beef gets very tender, adding the rice and mushrooms for the last 30 minutes so they don't get too soggy. He loves it! The beef is so tender and the beer makes the sauce so rich, not bitter at all! I make a big pot so he can easily reheat more for himself later. My kids like it too, it's a great recipe!

First, if there's no okra in a recipe, it's not a gumbo, just a stew. That said, this was far too bland for my taste. It's just missing the taste one normally gets from using a good homemade roux and adding the okra to thicken along with gumbo file (ground sassafras) at the end. To me this was nothing more than a "soup".

Fabulous recipe! Made today for New Year's good luck. Husband does not like B.E. peas but thought this looked good in the slow cooker. He tried it and ate 2 bowls full. I sauted onion, celery, red and green pepper and dumped in to 4 qt. cooker w/  3 cans peas, minced garlic, 28 oz. petite dice tomatoes & 4 oz. green chilis. Did NOT cook rice w/ peas, so omitted chk. broth. Cooked on hi 2 hours, then low 3 hours. During last 30 minutes or so, turned to hi &  added 2c. sliced frozen (thawed)okra and 1/2 lb. sliced smoked turkey sauage that I had browned. Served over white rice with a side of  hot cornbread. Everyone at lunch deemed this to be a KEEPER!

EXCELLENT.  I could only find Ranch Style Blackeye Peas (canned) (seasoned w/bacon).  I also used Red Gold Fiesta Mexicana Diced Tomatoes (seasoned with lime juice and cilantro).  Read reviews, so added Green Giant Mexicorn and also sweet turkey sausage.  Oh My Goodness.  This was soooooo good.  We will not only eat this every New Years Day (with the cornbread, as suggested) but also throughout the winter.  I'm sure the original vegetarian version is excellent, too.  I'll use that when my daughter visits. I love these kinds of recipes that can be "tweaked" depending on what you have on hand in the kitchen. Thank you Lynn, for such a great recipe! (And for starting off our New Year right! :-)

My dad is a firm believer that you must have black eyed peas on News Years Day to bring yourself plenty of good luck in the new year!  So I have been making this recipe for us for the last several years, and in fact have a pot simmering away on the stove right now.  This is a hearty and filling gumbo, and I've found that I've only had to make a couple of minor additions to suit my taste.  Today I threw in a ham hock while the gumbo cooked to give it a heartier and meatier taste, but in the past I have also added turkey sausage or kielbasa.  Since I enjoy a little kick to my soups, I also added 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1 tsp. Cajun seasoning.  This is just the right amount for me without going overboard.  If my tastebuds hanker for a little extra zing, a couple of shakes of Tabasco will do the trick.  A fantastic side to this gumbo is Mexican cornbread!

I could eat this for days. Literally. I ate this for days until I was done with all the leftovers. This is classic, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I can't say enough good things about this recipe...only change was to add significantly more garlic since I love a strong garlic taste in....everything.

Made this for a New Years Day gathering and it was a big hit!  I used frozen black eyed peas and increased the amount of of broth to keep it moist.  To give it a little flavor I put a few pieces of bacon in while it was simmering and removed them before serving.  This is an excellent cold day lunch or dinner.

Awesome...and this is coming from a native Alabama girl!  The only black eyed peas I could get at the store were "seasoned" black eyed peas.  I noticed a lot of people made modifications, so if you use these, then no additional seasonings are necessary or it may be too salty.  It was just salty enough in a good way.  The only change I made  was to add a couple packs of cajun sausages, which DEFINITELY made the dish!  My husband and I both gobbled it up.  We paired it with homemade honey corn bread.

This was amazing and a perfect way to start out the new year! I added half a can of corn, jalapeno smoked sausage, little bit of bacon, some cayenne pepper, and paprika (while sauteeing the veggies). It turned out great. Paired it with some jalapeno cornbead..sooo good!

Very misleading calling this gumbo. Gumbo means Okra in Swahili.  There is no okra in this recipe.  Must have okra to be a true gumbo.  I would call it a black eyed pea stew.  Tastes good though .

A great base recipe!  Served it for New Year's with Absolute Mexican Cornbread (from this site) and collard greens ~ was a huge it!  Ended up draining the beans and adding extra stock.  Also used a 28-ounce can of fire-roasted tomatoes and a 4-ounce can of diced green chilies instead.  Added 1 Tbsp. of Tony Chachere's Lite Creole Seasoning, some fresh ground black pepper, sea salt, a little extra water and then some file (sassafras leaves) on top before serving.  Next time I'll probably make a roux and add some okra.  Tasted even better the 2nd day ~ Thanks!

i made this with dried black-eyed peas instead of the ones in a can and just followed the directions on the back of the bag (boil beans in 8 cups of water for 10 mins and let soak for an hour) and just used that (with the left over water). I also used real peppers instead of ones in the can with tomatoes. I ended up adding a lot more rice than was recommended so it ended up being more like a cajun rice dish- I added okra, sausage and shrimp. My "new" dish needed a lot more flavor in it-I added a little "cajun spice" but it still needed a little something more.

Yum. I omitted the bell pepper as I can't stand them, and decided at the last minute to use 3 cans of black-eyed peas and 1 can of field peas just to give it a little toss up in flair. Everything else was as written and I thought the dish was very good. I had trouble getting the brown rice to cook thoroughly, despite giving it extra time and liquid to cook. I seem to have that problem with most dishes involving rice so next time I'll just use my rice cooker and cook the rice completely and toss it into the mix. I made this a second time and added cooked ground turkey for a more satisfying meal. With or without the ground turkey, my family loved it. Thanks for a great addition to our family menu!

This was fantastic!  I added fresh, sliced mushrooms and a dose of cayenne pepper to mine.  Also, I used white rice as they were out of brown rice at the deli.  That may explain why mine cooked in only 20 or so minutes instead of 45.  It was just about to burn on the bottom of the pan when I rescued it with a little more water, but the rice was nice and soft so it was definitely done cooking.  I had cornbread alongside the steaming bowl of gumbo and it was a fine start to 2005.  Highly recommended!

I made this today, to celebrate New Years Day.  It tasted great!  I did not add any meat, but I think that adding meat would make the recipe excellent.

I really loved how easy this dish was to make. The taste was great but I did add tabasco sauce carrots and ham cubes. Chicken would also taste good with this and corn bread. I added more seasonings to bring out the zing but overall loved it! Happy New Year! 2012

OK, does anyone beside me see that there is corn and sausage in the picture, but not in the recipe?  I added both and it is yummy.  Gotta have black eyed peas on New Years day!

I made this as written, except I added a ring of beef smoked sausage sliced 1/4" thick. Tasty, yet I will add cajun seasoning next time. Also, I had to simmer at least an hour to soften the brown rice. Very tasty.

Wonderful.  2nd time I partially cooked the brown rice separately w a chicken bullion cube and then leave out the broth in the pot.  It made it easier to cook through in a reasonable amount of time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good for a healthy, from-the-pantry meal.  Followed the suggestion of others and added an extra can of green chiles; drained and rinsed the beans and added a second can of chicken broth.  Took a while to cook the rice without the lid on, but once it was done it was pretty good.  Added chopped good ham we had leftover; made a nice addition.  Next time will add another can of tomatoes and maybe a little more spice.  As is (with extra can of chiles) it's good but still pretty tame.  Makes a BIG batch; use a soup pot.

Wow! This was so much more yummy than I anticipated! My kids loved it, too. I added another 2 cups of chicken broth to make it not so thick. I will make this one many more times, I'm sure.

Amazing recipe - hearty, flavorful, healthy - perfect. I've been eating a little bit in the mornings and really fills me up and powers me through the day, then I get my healthy carbs out of the way for the day to burn efficiently. I followed a readers recommendation to add smoked sausage, I used smoked turkey sausage and then we either dabbed on Chulula sauce or tapatio. Instant hit in the house! I froze some to defrost at a later time, I don't think that will be too far off. Delicious...thanks for the share!

This is a "baby, it's cold outside and I'm hungry" recipe for anyone who has spent time in the chilly temps and needs warming from the inside out!  I followed the recipe with the exception of subbing the can of diced tomatoes for a can of tomatoes and okra, which gave the soup a real gumbo effect.  Added a bit of salt and pepper as I do everything I cook, served with a loaf of AR's Amish White Bread and we had a perfect meal.  Super easy to prepare, ingredients you have on hand lots of flavor and sticktoitiveness!! Will gladly do this again.

This is GREAT!  Thank you for the recipe.  Taking a cue from other reviewers, I added smoked sausage (browned that first, then removed and did the onion/celery/peppers in the same pot to flavor them - returned it when adding the stock and other ingredients).  Used two cans of plain tomatoes (no salt added) then put in some hot peppers and some creole seasoning - about 3/4 t.  Cheated and used Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (brown) in the pouch so just heated that and put it in the bowl before putting the gumbo on top of it.  Also used Pearson's black eyed peas from produce section in lieu of canned - just boiled them 10min as per instructions on package.  Served with cornbread and it was a wonderful New Year's lunch.  Thank you for sharing this!!! Going to be a tradition now, but of course will want to do more than once a year...!

Super easy and yummy! Served it for New Years and loved it. I made a few minor modifications. I added two bay leaves, a ¼ cup of ketchup, plenty of hot sauce, and topped each serving with fresh chopped parsley.

Excellant recipe, spiced just right, the only thing I added was smoked sausage and about a 1/2 cup more rice because I like it thicker. Really a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've cooked this twice. The first time I followed the recipe. The second time I added chicken andouille sausage. Either way, the pot was all eaten up.  A very simple, but delicious recipe.

I have now been making this recipe for get togethers every New Year's Eve for 5 years. It is always a big hit for gourmet types, teenagers, and even Cajun southerners! I sauteed andouille first and skipped the oil, adding the vegetables to the sausage after a few minutes. I also added about a lb of sautéed shrimp after everything else was in the pot. This works just as well with dry beans and in a crockpot, just don't add the sausage and shrimp until the end for maximum flavor. One pound of peas makes about 4 cans worth. Great served with cornbread, and even better the next day. Add Old Bay if you need more flavor and kick!

It sounded good although the picture was not appealing. I started making it and wondering at the same time "what was I thinking?" I did deviate a bit by adding smoked turkey sausage, a bit of cajun seasoning (recipe on this site) and a touch of hot sauce. And I have to say it was pretty darn good. Surprisingly my daughter LOVED it. So did my wife. They thought it was great. Giving it 4 stars and a thank you. Give it a try, I think it's an excellent side dish.

Easy, healthy & tasty. Made as written & felt it was a tad bland - like it's missing something.... Sprinkled green tabasco & grated parm cheese on my bowl & enjoyed it more.  Served copycat tastefully simple beer bread on the side.  Will make again!

This gumbo is yummy! I used black beans instead of black eyed because I had a case of them and added chopped up sausage.  No seasoning is needed, there is plenty of flavor. This is the kind of soup that sticks in your tummy and makes you full.

I cooked the onion, celery, and green pepper on the stove, and browned a pound of jimmy dean sausage. I then transferred the vegatables and sausage to a 5qt crock pot. Then I added 2 cans of black eyed peas, and the rest of the ingredients. Finally, I added a bit of brown sugar to cut down on the tomato acid, and a few shakes of creole seasoning for heat. What a wonderful winter evening meal. The fresh baked corn bread and white wine topped it off perfectly.

This was my first attempt at gumbo and it turned out awesome.  Easy, nice and spicy, but the 8-year old still loved it.  We traded one can of black-eyed peas for garbonzo beans and added chicken sausage.  I'm sure it would have tasted just fine unmodified.

I made this for New Years Day 2011.  It was just okay.  I liked the fact that it was all made in one pot, but I think next year I will try a recipe where you make the beans separately, and then throw it over cooked rice.  I didn't think there was enough rice in this, a not enough liquid to cook the rice properly.  Again, not a bad recipe, everyone enjoyed it, but it didn't knock my socks off.

this is an excellent recipe.  Not real hot but you can taste the green chiles.  If you like hot add 2 cans of rotel tomatoes and omit the regular can of tomatoes.  I will make this again.

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I left out the celery cause I didn't have any, just sauteed the onion and pepper first, then threw all the other ingredients in the crock pot plus added a pound of sliced smoked sausage and some cajun and creole seasoning... cooked on high for 2 hours, served over crumbled corn bread and thanked God that this was the featured recipe today!  Fast, easy prep, economical and delicious!  It doesn't get any better!

Made this for a Mardi Gras potluck at work and it was a hit! We already had a rice dish so I omitted the rice and then added about 1 TBSP of sea salt for flavor. I also used dry beans (vs. canned). Didn't think it needed other flavor besides a little salt however a few shakes of hot sauce adds extra yum. This is a great low-cal and high protein/fiber meal, too. Awesome.

I added two pkgs of smoked sausage and a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. Yum! Even my picky daughter liked it, though she thought it was spicy. (I'm assuming from the green chilies in the tomatoes.) My hubby and boys added hot sauce and pepper to theirs. I think a few teaspoons of bacon bits next time will really kick it into overdrive. Oh, I also used a 16oz. bag of frozen black eyed peas, long grain white rice instead of the brown, and threw it all in the crockpot on low before I went to work. Outstanding and it only took me 10 minutes to assemble!

I made this for guests NY Day.  It was a huge hit.  None of us like the taste of sassafrass/file' so I was  happy not to have to omit anything.  We all loved it with my award winning cornbread.  This a keeper & a lovely winter supper.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was excellent and very easy to make. We added jalapenos and some Tony's seasoning but other than that, followed the recipe as written. We will definitely be making this again.

A new New Years Day tradition. I used one 28 oz can of Rotel instead of the 2 cans of tomatoes this recipe called for and I added a quart of frozen okra. I also served it over rice instead of cooking the rice in it.

Per other reviews, I added some cajun spices and hot sauce as well. For those who thought it was missing something, add a 1/4 c brown sugar.  It brings out the spices.  I made with ham, but can't wait to try andoulle sausage next time.  Also, I had only canned tomatoes with oregano and basil in it.  You could also use some canned salsa you don't quite care for as salsa!  I did not have peppers and was too lazy to go to the store, so maybe that was my 'needed something else' complaint, but that was my own fault.  EXCELLENT base recipe!  So many ways to tweek it to what you have in the pantry!  Glad I stubbled across this one!

this was so good with the modifications suggested by previous reviewers. I added chicken andouile sausage, chili powder and herbs from Provence (it has thyme and rosemary along with other spices). I was worried because I'd never had black eyed peas before, but after doing an ingredient search this was my best option. I did have to go to the store and get some ingredients, and it wasn't ready 'til 8:45, but definately worth the wait.

I used my pressure cooker to first cook unsoaked black eyed peas.  I used my smaller pressure cooker to cook hot Italian sausage.  Added about 5-6 large cloves of garlic, and I omitted the brown rice.  Excellent dish.  Kids thought it was a tad spicy, but they ate it anyway.  Can't wait to make it again.

This was really good!  Easy to make, very tasty. Maybe a tiny bit on the bland side for my family (although the chiles that I used weren't very spicy).  I added a little cayenne pepper, and it was good to go.  Great for leftovers, we had it for lunch the next day, and it was even better after the flavors had time to mix.

DELICIOUS! I did add some hot sauce and cajun seasoning as suggested by other reviews. It was perfect on this cold winter day. I served this with cheddar bay biscuits (also from this site). Thank you for this wonderful new recipe that I will be making again soon!

I tweaked recipe because of lack of ingredients & still turned out great, I used 2 cans black-eyed peas, 2 cans cannelini beans, 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes & 4 oz can of whole green chiles, which I chopped. Also added one more cup of broth.  Everyone loved it. Easy to make & use what you have!

I changed it pretty substantially - but we loved it.....I used three cans of rotel, 4 cans of peas, one full carton chicken broth (in the cardboard container it's probably 32 oz) sauteed my onion, pepper, celery, garlic and two lbs smoked sausage in olive oil then poured in the peas with liquid,rotel and simmered down for about 20 minutes......I had already prepared chicken flavor rice-a-roni from a previous dinner and probably had about 2 cups left....I stirred this in and sprinkled with creole seasoning (no msg kind)....I didn't add any other seasoning to it.....it had the right amount of heat and I think the rice-a-roni really added a nice flavor to the rest of the soup and helped to thicken it....I then simmered another 20 minutes until it was as thick as we liked it.

Following reviews, I made just a few changes.  I added 3 Hillshire Farm Hot Links diced and only used 3 cans of peas.  The hot links add enough  heat to eliminate the need for red pepper or hot sauce.  This is a very different recipe for me - somewhere between chili and gumbo.  Served to family and surprise guests - ugh!  Everyone really liked it.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

This is a great recipe...but you do need to perk it up a bit. I used a combination of red, green and yellow peppers. I also added hot turkey sausage, cooking it first in the saucepan that you cook the onions and the rest in. I added the chopped up sausage back in 15 minutes before serving. I also added extra chx. broth instead of water to thin it out. It was VERY tasty!!! A definate keeper!!!

If you make this as is, unless you are in the 1% of the population that likes their food BLAND BLAND BLAND you will NOT like this!  I mean, there is NO flavor.  Yes, I made it exactly according to the recipe except for no green pepper.  But...it was salvageable!  It needed more salt and way more TANG.  I divided it into two batches and part of it I added another can of the HOT diced tomatoes with green chiles plus quite a bit of salsa.  The other half I added a lot of Louisiana hot sauce and chorizo.  Both ended up pretty good.  Just be ready to doctor it up and it will end up pretty good.

This was a good jumping off point. I used fresh jalapenos, spicy turkey sausage, and quinoa instead of rice, as well as spices galore: cumin, red pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, Worcester, onion powder to round out the spicy flavor, and Tabasco. Though this technically makes it a different recipe, i hope this will help those who are looking for additions

this is very good for a vegetarian meal by substituting vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  If I were to make this a meat based dish I'd want to add chicken, beef, or shrimp for extra flavoring.

I put this in a crockpot instead of over the stove. I drained the black eyed peas before putting them in the crockpot cause the liquid doesn't evaporate the same as stovetop. I also sauteed the onion and celery with the olive oil and some italian turkey sausage and put the meat and drippings in the crockpot. Put the rice in uncooked and let everything cook on high for four hours. My mom made some homemade cornbread to go with it. It turned out great! Everyone loved it!!

Really good--made for New Year's Day but will make again befpre next year.  I made in slow cooker and did not add brown rice (not instant rice) until mid day.  Cooked a total of 6-7 hours, mostly on low until the last hour.  Also used two cans of Rotelle (mild)

This is a very nice side dish.  I don't often make black eyed peas but I would definitely make these again. I left out the green pepper and celery (too lazy to make the trip to the store) and used fresh tomatoes and a fresh chopped Thai chili pepper. I added a little chicken stock at the end to thin out the consistency. I also added salt, pepper and a little bit of Cajun seasoning.

I followed this recipe with the exceptions of: used a crockpot, added andoiulle sausage and shrimp towards the end, added Penzey's Gumbo File (powdered sassafras). AMAZING!!! My husband flipped out for it, this will become a regular for us.

I was looking for some way to use up a bag a dried black eyed peas left over from New Year and thought I would give this a try. It turned out really good, even with some modifications. 

First, I used dry beans which I soaked for about 2 hours. Then I used a slow cooker, starting the beans first with the  chicken broth. By the way, 2 cups of broth is no where near enough. I added  a cup of leftover beef broth and a can of water in all. Next I used white rice instead of brown, which is not as easy to find and I don't usually keep on hand. 

The end result was very good. It made lots and leftovers reheated very well. Very good.

Loved this gumbo.  We did add some sausage to complete the meal.  Some liked it spicier so we kept hot sauce on the table to spice it up.

This was delicious!  I added sausage to my husbands bowl and he just raved about how great this was!  Will definitely make again.  Also, I added about 1 tsp. of Creole seasoning to spice it up.  But I think it would have been good without as well.  Great flavor!

This was very simple, fast and DELICIOUS.  I used the extra hot tomatoes and chilis and it had quite the kick.  Topped it with a bit of sour cream.  Rave reviews all around.  I let it simmer longer than called for and had to add a bit of water.  Definately a keeper and will be made again.  Thanks so much!!

Tasty, and a good starting point, but whoever heard of Cajun food without seasoning? After the addition of salt, Cajun seasoning, file powder, and about 10 shakes of Louisiana hot sauce, this was much better.

I agree that this was very bland.  I used soaked and rinsed dry beans, so I added another 2 cups of broth.  Also added 1/2 tsp creole seasoning and two cut-up Italian sausages.  It's a hearty base, but it needs more flavor.

I used dried black-eyed peas instead of canned.  Not sure if that was the reason, but this took forever to cook - about an hour longer than the recipe called for.    Still, it was worth the wait.  So yummy and healthy tasting.

This was GREAT!!!! Like others suggested I too added cajun seasoning (1tsp of zatarain's blackened seasoning to be exact) and sausage. I also decided at the last minute to add some frozen okra, just because it sounded good :) without the sausage this recipe is only 7 weight watchers points.

Very good! Perfect for new years. I added some cajun spice just cause I like it spicy but it would have tasted fine without it too. I also simmered it longer than the recipe called for and that seemed to really bring out the flavor. Defiantly making this again.

Very good and healthy. I did not have celery and had a half a head of green cabbage so I used that instead, and a red pepper instead of a green one. Also threw in some bulk hot Italian sausage at the start. I only gave it 4 stars because it did not reheat well - got kind of mushy as leftovers. I will make it again but not plan to have a lot left.

This recipe has all the ingredients that I love so I had to try it.  I'm always looking for healthy, low sodium and low fat soups that taste great for my lunch.  To make this more of a soup I used 32 ozs fat free, reduced sodium chicken broth.  I ouny had 2 cans of black eyed peas on hand.  I used no salt diced tomatoes and "hot" Rotel.  Near the end of simmering I added 2 bay leaves and 1/4 cup dried parsley.  Even with the added chicken broth this still came out thick.  A bowl of this soup, piece of fruit and a big glass of ice water and you have a perfect lunch.

My family loved it. I made a few minor changes. I put sliced and quartered pieces of kielbsa when I cooked the veggies. I also put my garlic in part way through cooking my veggies. I am considering using bacon grease instead of olive oil; as alot of southern cooks do, the next time I make this. I used Rotel tomatoes for the 10 ounce can. I served it with corn bread too.

I like spicy food, but have never been to Louisiana to have authentic gumbo, and am not sure how it should taste.  But I liked this once I tried it out...I did alter it, probably making it not gumbo at all.  I started heating 3 slices of chopped bacon to get some liquid going...as the bacon released it's grease and started to brown I then added some olive oil and then the onions, celery, etc.  I also added two chopped up cajon sausages.  I had to add much more water than I had expected...about 3 or 4 emty tomato cans' worth of water.  N ext time I will use white basmati rice over brown rice as I prefer it.  And as it was a bit bland I also added a 4oz can of diced jalepenos.

Oh My Heavens, my family and I loved the soup so much!!!  I followed all the ingridents, no changes.  So perfect soup!  Very spicy!  I will make it once a month along with other soup recipes every month for the cold weather!  For the fact, blackeye peas has great benifits, it prevents the colon cancer, reduces the risk of having diabetes.  It has high fiber & protein and low fat.  It also helps people lose weight because the blackeye beans designs to keep you full.  Very delicious and healthy soup!!  I didnt add anything like the meat.  Perfecto!!!

This is a great recipe! The only thing I added was about 12 oz. of smoked sausage (diced) and a large ham hock. This gave a little more smokey flavor. Excellent recipe! Thank you for submitting.

The seasonings have to be revved up in this one. I recommend black pepper, cayenne, etc.

Made the gumbo tonight.  Omitted the celery and added sausage as recommended by others.  It was wonderful!

I chopped up 1/2 jalapeno pepper deseeded and added it to the onion, bell pepper, and celery for a little heat.  I also added Andouille Sausge for some meat.  It was easy to make and awesome.

Wanted blackeyed peas for New Years but not a big fan. Found this recipe and fell in love. Did not have any brown rice so substituted a box of Zatarains long grain and wild rice mix and thru in some smoked sausage. Its a keeper! Will have it again. Very easy and quick to make.

I was looking for Gumbo recipes and came across this. There is no Roux, no Okra and not File, so it is not a gumbo at all. Gumbo is also supposed to be spicy. There is no hint of spice at all here. I may make this someday, when i am looking for a bean soup recipe, but for now I will keep looking for that real Gumbo recipe.

I followed the basic ingredients of the recipe yet omitted a couple ingredients, substituted a few and added:

replaced - can black eyed peas for dried (soaked overnight)
cut - bell pepper (don't care for them)
replaced - dried onion for fresh onion as I didn't have one on hand.
replaced - brown rice with approximately 1/2 cup quinoa
added - one pound of mild Italian sausage

Otherwise I didn't add any additional seasoning however; I cooked in the crock pot for about 7 hours with no prior cooking of veggies or meat.   Garished with some sour cream and home made cornbread.

I'd certainly make this again.

The one extra I had planned to add but forgot...chopped fresh kale.

Made this for New Year's Day. Changed a few things for what I had on hand. Used orzo in place of brown rice, water in place of chicken broth (added some extra seasonings) and carrot in place of celery, used one can of back-eyed peas and one can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Turned out great!!

Great recipe for black-eyed peas.  I'm not usually a fan of them, but thought I'd give this a try for New Year's Day.  I only used 3 cans of black-eyed peas instead of the 4 called for, and I also added some andouille sausage.  Great flavors without adding any spices.  I'll keep this for next New Year's Day!

4 1/2: pretty tasty.  added the cajun spice (1T) and smoked sausage.  didn't use can diced.  added extra cup chicken broth.  used 2 cans mix (black-eyed peas, jalapeno, tomato) - should use maybe one of those and 3 regular peas.  Little spicy this way for K's taste - just about right for me.

Very bland as is. It needs at least 2 tab spoon of cajun spice, 2 tea spoon Spanish paprika, 1 tea spoon thyme, 2 tea spoon fresh rosemary and 1/4 tea spoon chipotle pepper. 2 cups of cooked black-eyed peas w/o liquid was enough.

I made this recipe as written, and the brown rice was a little hard at the end of cooking time. The flavor was just ok- the soup overall was kind of bland.

This was okay.  My husband liked it and since it makes so much, he took it to work and shared it with co-workers, who also thought it was good.  I personally found it bland, even though I added some hot sauce and cayenne to the recipe.  I don't think I will use this particular gumbo recipe again.

Easy, delicious and filling.  The only adjustment I made was to add some chili powder to bump up the heat.  It is perfect in the dead of winter.  Makes a great meal.

OK, so this is really a different recipe - just used the idea, but whole family loves it.  To make this fast & simple, start with Louisiana brand gumbo mix (use chicken stock), then add the peas (2 cans drained), one can diced tomato with celery & onion, chopped okra (one frozen bag), one chopped onion, Worchestershire (to taste) & shrimp.  Play with the spice level 'til you get what you want & serve with hot sauce at the table.  It's gumbo, play with it & have fun!  Great idea!!  Would never have thought to use peas in gumbo!

Kept the recipe exactly as stated and turned out pretty good, though I did simmer mine for much longer than 45 mins. I used Bush's blackeyed peas (the best!)  Hubby and I kept commenting on how "different" this recipe is from my usual cooking, but different isn't always bad!  We finished full and satisfied!  The gumbo went well with a spinach salad and Cheddar Bay biscuits (AWESOME recipe found on allrecipes!)

Awesome recipe! I took it a step further and made into a meal by adding shrimp and thinly sliced smoked sausage before letting it simmer. I also didn't have the diced tomatoes, but a large can of diced tomatoes and green chiles, so added that plus some diced fresh tomatoes.  Also added Tony Chachere's for added kick. Loved it!!!

This was very bland. I tried doctoring it up the next night to get rid of what we had left. I put 2 bay leaves some cajun seasoning and some garlic salt. It was better, but still would not make it again.

Every time I make this my entire family loves it. The only changes I make are to sub veggie broth for chicken broth (I'm vegetarian) and I also add cajun seasoning and/or hot sauce for some kick.

By far one of my favorite quick meals from this site! Everyone in my family loved it which is saying something in this family of 7. It is more like a jambalaya than a gumbo but who cares when it tastes this good!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Since my husband is a vegetarian, I added Tofurky-brand kielbasa, and it turned out great.  We did notice, however, that the gumbo tasted the best the first night.  It did not seem to get better as leftovers.  Next time I may cut the recipe in half.

This recipe makes a ton of gumbo!  Adding sausage or ham to this is really a must.  I'd recommend to spice it up a little too, maybe cajun seasoning or hot sauce?

This really is more of a jambalaya because there is no roux and the rice is cooked in it.  That said, it is delicious.  I halved the recipe using a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of the 2 cans called for.  I also added a 1/2 pound of diced smoked sausage.  I cooked it first, removed it from the pan, then proceeded putting the sausage back in with the peas, etc.  I also rinsed and drained the peas, ICK!  I added some salt to taste and some tabasco.  I used white rice only cooking for 20 minutes and it was great!  Thanks, this will be a winter staple.

Everyone I served this to had three bowls each!  I followed the base recipe then made a few additions:

-Added 2 carrots (thinly sliced) to the celery, onion mixture that was sauteed in the beginning
-Baked a chicken and pulled the meat and chopped about 2 cups worth and added it to the gumbo
-Created a rich chicken stock from the bones, fat, and drippings while the Gumbo was cooking, added about 4 cups homemade stock to the original 2 cups chicken broth
-Added about 2 Tbs of lime juice half way through cooking
-Added about 1-2 tsp of red pepper flakes
-Continued to add water as needed

It created amazing, complex flavors that meshed together so nicely!

This is a great recipe for New Years day. I  started off by adding ground meat. I sauted the meat fully and add onions, celery, bell peppers and then a bag of cabbage. Then I added that to 2 quarts of beef broth. I didn't use tomatoes or make it to spicy since my mother-in-law was having stomach problems. I cooked the rice by itself and poured the gumbo over it. It has peas for luck and cabbage for money all in one dish.

This was quite good. I made a few mods by using 1 can diced tomatoes zesty chili style and 1 can diced tomatoes with zesty jalapenos. This way I didn't have to add too many seasonings just a dash of creole. I also started to cook the rice first then added the other ingredients about 15 mins later so the peppers and celery didn't turn to mush. Oh I also used the lundberg jubliee brown rice blend.. I SWEAR BY IT!! Thanks

I achieved perfection and kicked up the flavor for this recipe with just a very few variations.  For one of the four cans of black eyed pea, I used black eyed peas with jalepenos.  Also used two cans of Rotel, one original and one mild, and omitted the canned tomatoes.  Added two pounds skinless smoked sausage (or smoked turkey sausage) about 15 minutes before serving.  Served with cornbread.  Excellent dish, and very healthy. My family loves it!

I made this last night.  I have to say, it's probably one of the best recipes I've tried on this site.  Absolutely amazingly good.  The only changes I made were to use dried peas (cooked about 45 minutes with a ham hock) and added a little cajun seasoning.  It took a lot longer for the brown rice to get done, I think next time I'll use white rice, but even my 20 month old grandson loved it!  Very, very good!

Great recipe.  I did add the creole seasonings and a dash only of cayenne pepper.  Just enough.  This will be traditional for us on New Years in years to come.

Great dish!  We will be enjoying this dish for many decades.  I agree with some of the other reviewers about needing to add a great deal more spice.  As for the sausage suggestion, my husband loved it.  I prefer it without the sausage though.

After reading some of the reviews I decided to add creole seasoning and also added smoked sausage.  It was really simple and quick!  Being a working mom I like to do what I can to save time so I have a huge bag of chopped onion, pepper, celery that I buy from the grocery store.  I just added 2 cups of the vegetable mixture and sautéed with the smoked sausage.  I then added 3 cans of blackeyed peas, 2 cans of diced tomatoes and instead of the 2 cups of chicken broth,  I just added chicken bouillon to flavor it.   I usually don't have good outcomes with cooking rice in gumbo/jambalaya dishes because it never comes out in the consistency that I would like so now I cook my rice separately and either add it at the end or pour the gumbo over the rice.

Really good! I love everything in this recipe, so it was a no-brainer for me. I changed it a little: used 28oz Rotel instead of any plain diced tomatoes and didn't cook rice in it. I served it on baked potatoes with garlic bread on the side. I will make it again for sure.

This is a real "stick to your ribs" dish. Omitted the celery, as we don't care for it, and added a ring of spicy sausage link, and 1/2 small can of jalapeños.  Otherwise made as directed and was wonderful!  Am going to make again soon.  JD The Old Cooker

Oh my yum! LOVED this! Just made this but tweaked it a bit (like others suggested)..added turkey kielbasa, okra, cajun seasoning, and hot sauce. Did not use the green pepper or garlic because my hubby doesn't like them. It's a keeper!

Good, easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used a 1# bag of frozen black eyed peas in place of the canned peas, and a full (~14 oz) can of diced tomatoes with chiles in place of a 1/2 can each of the tomatoes with chiles and diced tomatoes. Had a nice nip to it. Good winter meal.

This is a good starter recipe. I don't usually add things to the recipes before I rate them, but I did have to add things to this because the flavor was bland. I took the suggestions of a lot people who added things. I added smoked sausage, worcestershire sauce, a little more garlic, soft cooked bacon, bay leaf, paprika, himalayan sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, mushrooms. The sausage realllyyyyy needs to be added. It makes it so much tastier. To me there are way too many tomatoes in this recipe, but that may just be my taste. They seemed to overpower the recipe. I took some out as it began cooking. I put in the one can of diced tomatoes, and only added 1/2 the can of tomatoes with green chilis because with stomach issues, food can't be too spicy. Added 2 tablespoons brown sugar as someone else suggested to lower the acid of the tomatoes. I left out the rice altogether, and cooked it for nearly 3 hours on the stove top. It's still a great recipe, and I do thank the person for posting it, just had to add my own touch.

Made pretty much exactly according to the recipe except I used 2 frozen bags of vegetables (celery, onion, and bell pepper medley). Turned out great!

I liked it a lot, very easy to prepare and without that much of spices it tasted delicious! 
I had to make some changes/adaptations because of the ingredients I had and didn´t. I didn´t use de can of pepper and tomato and instead used 2 peppers, instead of the canned tomatoes, I used a natural tomatoe and the rice wasn´t the brown one.

I think a bit of chorizo, sausage or smoked ham with give that extra kick! Definitely will try!

This recipe is so good! I substituted veggie broth instead the chicken broth and also added in half of an extremely ripe jalapeno. It just kept getting better with each day that it had time so soak up the flavor!

This was absolutely delicious, and very simple to make. The only ingredient changes I made were to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and to add salt and pepper near the end of the cooking time. I simmered it for longer  than the recipe calls for, as my rice was still hard at the end of the specified cooking time. This is my first time cooking with  black eyed peas and it will definitely become a New Years Day tradition in our house. Thanks!

Excellent recipe. I had a friend who asked me to bring the black-eyed peas to their New Years Day gathering, so of course, I came to Allrecipes for ideas and settled on this one. I'm pretty much a "recipe follower", but always read a lot of these reviews and based on that, I decided to add some Kielbasa sausage and a few shakes of Cajun Seasoning from this site...the latter since one of the hosts is from N'Orleans. To let the flavors incorporate, I prepared this the day before. It was a big hit. The next day, the hostess called and said these were the best black eyed peas she's had...except for her mother's. Being the good daughter that she is, I think she felt obligated to say that last part! ;-)

Very good. I used Jamine rice and topped it with a dollop of sour cream and shredded pepper jack/with red/green jalapenoes cheese. Serve with cornbread for a hearty Sunday football fare.

Made this for New Years Day and loved it! I added smoked sausage and bacon. Did not add celery and used white rice instead of brown which I cooked separately then added to the beans. Will for sure make this again.

Makes a massive amount of food.  Thought that the flavor was way too bland without some serious cajun seasoning and hot pepper addition.  Probably wouldn't make again.

Following tradition, I made this for New Years Day for my Kids and Husband.  They usually never eat Black-eyed Peas.  They loved it!  
I changed slightly by adding a can of corn and smoked turkey.  This recipe will be a keeper!  Thank you!

Wonderful! I used dry black-eyed peas. First I put a smoked shank in my crock pot and cook it most of the day until it falls off the bone. I then wash and soak the black-eyed peas all night so it's ready to cook the next day. I turn on the crockpot and cook the peas and shank for a couple hours, I then take out the shank and bones and discard the bones and fat. I put the meat back in along with kilbasa sausage, browned onion, celery, green pepper and garlic. I added chicken broth granuals, 1 can diced tomatoes. I then added a little cajun seasoning called 'Slap Ya Mama' along with a little pepper. I made white rice on the side to add in as desired. The entire crockpot was gone in a couple hours. When I first told my family what I was making they thought it sounded nasty but they are already asking when I will make it again.

I made this the other day and loved it(so did My husband). The only change I made, actually an addition, was sauteeing some sliced smoked chicken and apple sausage and adding it to the gumbo. Very tasty dish and full of nutrition.

I normally follow the recipe exactly as provided ... but I did not use the liquid from the beans, added an extra cup of chicken broth, and didn't add the tomatoes with chilies and served with shredded cheese. A friend who doesn't even like black-eyed peas LOVED it! i think whatever tweaks you make will probably be great.

I scaled and down to 3 and rounded things up and down a little to use whole tins, so less beans more tomato - i had to use a jalapeno sauce in place of green chills in tomatoes but it tasted great all the same

Made this last night. Gave 4 stars because I changed according to reviews I thought we'd like.  Hubby liked and said to keep since it tasted similar to his ham & navy bean soup.  This would be good with the addition of ham or sausage by the way.  Our second bowl we added a little ketchup over it as he suggested and it really did give it something extra.  Good recipe for adding fiber to your diet.  I used 1# dried beans I soaked overnight so per reviews I used 4C (whole box) chicken broth.  Used 2 cans Rotel Original rather 2 cans of diced in recipe.  I added 1t Creole Seasoning and 1/2t cayenne pepper as suggested.  I brought to a boil then cooked on low for 1 hour.  Hubby wants cornbread with the leftovers!!  I will make this again.

Absolutely wonderful gumbo. Followed as written just added Tobasco at the end. It gets better the next day as the rice and veggies get softer and the flavors settle. It makes a lot but we made it meatless, pretty figure friendly. My boyfriend said he wants me to make it again in the future and add scotch bonnets for heat. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this for a tailgate in NY in January. Perfect winter food. I added some hot sauce, cajun seasoning and andouille sausage. Rave reviews from my friends.

I made this for family and friends on New Year's Day and I have to say it was wonderful!  I made it as written with 3 slight modifications: I used the juice from 2 cans of black-eyed peas and rinsed and drained the other two; added a pound of smoked sausage; and a sprinkle of cajun seasoning to taste.  Reading other reviews, I did not saute the trinity but added it raw to the gumbo and by the time it simmered on the stove, the trinity was done.  The rice was added 20 minutes before serving and it was perfectly cooked.  Happy New Year!

This was a wonderful gumbo for a cold day.  We made it exactly like the recipe stated but we added the 1 tbsp.creole seasoning as someone suggested. Also chopped up 2 jalapeno peppers and through them in. (We like a kick!). Oh, yeah we used white rice instead of brown.
Excelllant!

This was really good.  I made some slight adjustments.  Basmati rice instead of brown and I also cooked the veggies with salt & pepper.  After everything was combined, I added a bay leaf and some Cavender's Greek seasoning.  The recipe would be pretty bland without it, I think.  Overall, really delicious!  Add a slice of cornbread and it's the perfect New Year's Day meal!

Great starter recipe. I omitted the celery. Used 1 cup low sodium chicken broth and four links of fresh andouille sausage browned. Didn't use canned tomatoes, instead used fresh tomatoes (skin removed), and fresh chile peppers. Added spices - tsp. cayenne pepper, a dash of habanero Tabasco sauce, tsp. Old Bay, two bay leaves and tsp. hot chile powder - to an onion, bell pepper and garlic (4 cloves) saute, then added all to the pot of peas...it would have been too bland otherwise. As it was, the chileheads in my house still added extra habanero hot sauce to their individual servings. Initially didn't add the rice...we started out serving this over white rice made separately...but after the first meal, I stirred the leftover rice into the black eyed pea mixture and the result was even better than the original. Will definitely make this again. Even my mother, who does not like black eyed peas, liked this.

Needs a bit more oomph - so added green beans (okra would also be good, but I don't have any - would keep with the New Orleans theme). Here in the UK, we don't have tins of tomatores with green chiles in them in many places, so I just added my own fresh chiles. Also took the advice of adding Worcestershire and Tabasco as my family love spicy food. Love the brown rice (mine was basmati).  A good, basic dish that is easy to prepare and as it relies on a lot of store cupboard ingredients, is pretty straightforward. Substituted veg stock for chicken to keep the dish vegetarian (we're trying to each more veg meals in 2012). Can you please fix measures in brackets, as this makes it confusing for non US people following the recipe!

Cooked this on New Years Day! Followed directions as stated, only added some Cajun seasoning and chili powder as mentioned by others to help spice it up! Came out perfect, great taste! Was worried at first because of the beans and rice mixed, however since I love rice dishes I continued preparing.  Next time will scale back on serving size since it's just me and my fiancé. Cooked a side of skillet bread and baked wings.....great new years dinner to start of 2011!!

Great recipe!  Healthful, easy, AND delicious.  The only change I made was that I drained the beans and added an extra cup of broth.  Also used white rice instead of brown.  This was tame enough for the kids but husband and I enjoyed a dash of Emeril's Essence with ours for an extra kick (bam) or whatever you want to call it.  Was delicious along side of the fish we had!!

This was wonderful! My 5 year old asked if we could make it "every night", which is amazing to hear from her! I only used 2 cans of black eyed peas, 1 28oz can of diced tomatoes (so we'd minus the chilies), half the onion and half the pepper and threw in 5 leaves of collard greens. It was perfect for the whole family. 18 month old included! It may sounds like I watered it down a bit but wanted my kids to not find it "spicy" as they say. I'll throw in a 3rd can of peas next time and soon we'll try the original version! I think its just a great recipe all around if you can add and take from it the way I and other reviewers have! de-lish! Happy 2011!

This is delicous! I made it without onion and celery b/c my husband passionately hates them both. And without green chiles b/c I don't care for them. I added carrots and little bit of salt, pepper, and chili powder. So yummy!

My husband loved this!  I didn't change a thing on the recipe ingredients except that I didn't have quite a cup of brown rice and had to fill in with white rice.  For my black-eyed peas instead of using canned, I used raw peas that I had sprouted (makes them soft like canned ones and really brings out the nutrition).  I kept it more like a side dish on our plates instead of a soup.  My husband wants to use the leftovers for breakfast and add some scrambled eggs to it and perhaps some green chile sauce over the top.  Tonight he tried putting some homemade kimchi over it and that was yummy too.

I tried this today and it was delicious!  I ate four helpings; fortunately it's healthy!  I didn't change the seasoning as some of you have, but I did use dried, soaked peas rather than canned and also a fresh tomato.  No peppers or chilies though, didn't have any.

While I did not follow this recipe exactly as written I still give it 5 stars for being such a good recipe that it can be liberally tinkered with and still have favorable results. Since I was only cooking for myself, and from leftovers besides, I didn't measure anything and I used carrot instead of celery since that's all I had. I sauted the veges and then cooked the whole thing in a pressure cooker, which cut the cook time almost in half (and I was using leftovers!) I added just a little bit of Spike seasoning and the results were so good that one of my roommates ended up sharing the pot with me! I will definitely be making this again.

I loved this stew.  It was easy to make and so delicious.  I had never had black eyed peas before.  I never knew how creamy they were.  This was a great recipe, I didn't have to change a thing.

This is an amazing gumbo. I added zuccini, carrots, omitted the celery, used low-sodium vegetrable broth instead of the chicken broth, and added a healthy amount of creole seasoning. This recipe was very flavorful, hearty, and healthy!

This recipe was much too bland and the consistency was not good.  I attempted to spice it up with chili powder and cajun seasoning, but this did not help very much.  I would not make this recipe again.

I give this recipe as is 3 stars.  It has no spices at all and is terribly bland.  I give it 5 stars with some cayenne, basil and thyme, with a dash of file at the end.  My kids ate it without complaint and I enjoyed it, too.

Yummy, but definitely needs more spices. I added dried thyme and some cajun spice mix (garlic and onion powders plus some red pepper would work fine). I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used 2 large tomatoes.

I added carrots, a can of corn, and a beef smoked sausage (cooked in the pan before everything else was added) and forgot the green pepper. we were surprised that there were no added spices in this dish! I followed other suggestions and added 2 or 3 tsp cajun seasoning and 1 tsp cayenne and everyone loved it! my husband doesn't like corn, so next time, I'll skip the corn and add the green pepper. but this was a great new years dish-easy to assemble and let sit while watching football ;)

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was awesome.  We did use Louisiana hot sauce to season our individual bowls, but that was added after cooking.  Delicious!  A new recipe for our household to enjoy!  Happy New Year!

Loved this recipe!!  I added a red beans & black beans and halfed the black eyed peas,a little cooked orzo (instead of rice)  and smoked turkey & andouille sausage as well as a little Cajun seasoning.  Loved it!  Husband loved it, too (he's not a big fan of any kind of beans, and he had to servings).   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Works out really well as stated, but I ended up adding some fresh jalapenos for a kick.  This recipe makes at least ten servings, as opposed to the eight according to the nutrition information.  Low calorie and very tasty!  No need to add more salt!

it was pretty good, but I did have to add some more spices. I also had a little corn and spinach left over so I threw some of that in there too. I don't think that made much of a difference. but overall it was pretty good.

Yummy! I made it as written, with Zatarrain's and Frank's Red Hot on the side. It fit a wide variety of spice preferences that way. It was much more satisfying than other soups I've eaten recently. I also froze and ate it later. The rice was a bit gooier, but still yummy.

As written, I gave this recipe a 2.  No seasoning, very bland.  With the additions I made I would give it a 5.  Absolutely delicious.  Used 4 cans of black eyed peas with bacon, a pound of smoked sausage cut into bite sized pieces, a teaspoon and a half of cajun seasoning, a sprinkle of wosterschier, and in place of broth I dissolved chicken bullion in hot water.  I left out the bell pepper because my family and I don't care for them.  I served this with fried cornbread fritters.  Comfort at its best!

This was sooooo good!!!!  Instead of using only black eyed peas, which I couldn't find, I used a can of mixed beans.  I accidentally bought canned jalapeños instead of chilies, so I used just a few of those sliced up. It turned out amazing!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I made this dish for a New Year's potluck at work.  We have several vegetarians in our group, so I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  I chopped and sauteed 3 vegetarian (soy) chorizo sausages and then added the sausage after the celery, onion, and pepper had cooked.  I used Zataran's Jambalaya rice in lieu of regular brown rice.  Also added 1 tsp of cajun seasoning.  Excellent flavors, and went great with corn bread!

good. used dry black-eyed peas. did not saute onion. did not use celery or bell pepper because of personal preferences. put everything except rice in slow cooker. also added bacon, beef smoked sausage, left over chicken and creole seasoning. gumbo was finished when got home from work and just had to cook rice. pretty thick, probably because of using dry peas. will add more chicken broth/water next time. everyone liked this. my pickest child even asked for more the next day. a week later, she asked me to make it again. very easy, definately a keeper!

very good & filling stew -- threw in slow cooker for the day with a pound of kielbasa and a heap of old bay seasoning, which gave it lots of flavor.  hoping for good luck this year!

I was looking for a black-eyed pea recipe that's not plain like regular black-eyed peas.  I have found it.  This was declicious!!!  I, too, added the cajun seasoning and smoked sausage and I used Del Monte Original Stewed tomatoes instead of the plain diced tomatoes.  And since the Del Monte already has bell pepper, garlic, etc.  I'm thinking when short on time, I may be able to skip all the prep chop work. Definately a keeper for the recipe box and will make more often than on New Year's day.

Mmmm Scrumptious!! I had to wing somethings which turned out worth it, I used fresh green chili instead of canned, didnt use B.E.P's Liquid in the can(ewww thats just gross) drained canned tomatoes, used a Jambalaya rice mix (couldnt find the gumbo mix but it worked just as well, and a couple of wapping tablespoons of Cajun Spice OooOooh chile i never thought anything could fix black eyed peas but this recipe makes me look at them in a different light! Happy New Years!

This is an awesome and easy recipe!  Added about 4 cups of  water and simmered for about 1.5 hours.  We added some chili powder, salt, pepper, and hot sauce.  Also it is great to serve with shredded cheese on top.

This was so good.  A quick, easy and healthy weeknight meal.  My two little ones loved it as well as my two young nieces.  I used a fresh chopped chili pepper instead of the tomatoes with chili.  I also added carrots to the dish.  I topped it with some organic turkey kielbasa.  Yummy!  Served with cornbread it was a hearty meal.

This was a great recipe but the rice took a lot longer to cook then what the recipe said. I added a few things like a teaspoon of cumin seeds, half a teaspoon of paprika, 1/4 teaspoon of curry powder, some lemon pepper, and a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. This was a super hearty meal, perfect for bringing in the Fall!! This is something I will make again!!

Yummy!  We added some cajun spices.  Beware, though, because our family of four had to eat it for dinner three times before the pot was gone.  It makes a LOT.

VERY good!  The only thing I did different was the addition of cajun/creole seasoning.  Can't wait to make again and will probably add smoked sausage it to, too!

As is, it's a little bland.  I used 2 cans of black-eyed peas with bacon, and 2 unseasoned cans.  Then I added creole seasoning like others have suggested.  Made like this, I would give it 5 stars.  My whole family loves it.

This was delicious! First off, my family (2 teens + husband) hates black-eyed peas however, they loved this meal. I also made a few adjustments: omitted bell pepper because didn't have any, used water + chicken bullion cubes instead of can broth, used dried peas (soaked overnight & cooked) & added 1 lb. smoked beef sausage. The sausage made a world of difference! I served it with sweet cornbread muffins... Yum! I will definitely make this again!

Delicious.  I also added some Cajun seasoning, smoked sausage, and chicken breast.  We doubled the recipe for a dinner party we were having on New Years Eve.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe. :)

Excellent blend of flavors!  I did make some changes, though: I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and I added about 2 tsp of cajun seasoning.  I also added a pound of smoked sausage, which gave it a nice smokey flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

Even my one year old liked this and is eating leftovers for lunch today.  I used a second can of Rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes for extra spice.  I also added turkey kielbasa.  No additional spices were needed for us.

Very good change from the normally plain black eyed peas on New years day! I also used dried peas that I soaked overnight. cooked rice in rice cooker first and added to soup later. used the creole seasoning from this site. and had to keep adding water to keep it soupy. waited to the end to add green pepper so it wasn't mushy and also added some Beef Sausage. I cooked on med/low for about 5+hrs. The whole family loved it! this will be our new, New Years day meal.

This is very good if you follow the advice from several of the other reviewers, adding  1 tsp. Cajun seasoning, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to taste, and smoked beef sausage. A simple, first-rate recipe especially good for folks who don't like black-eyed peas.

Made this today for our New Year's dinner. I added okra (can't eat gumbo without it) and Tennessee Pride hot sausage and served with cornbread. I've already had a request to make it next year. Thanks for sharing!

I liked the recipe, but I don't think I cooked it long enough, because the beans were still kind of chewy for my taste.  But good overall.

great recipe. Only addition I made was to fry some bacon in the skillet prior to adding the chopped veggies. Gave it a great flavor. Will definitely make it again, and not just on New Years Day.

Absolutely delicious.  This will become a regular at our dinner table.  The only change I made was that I used two cans of diced tomatoes (with liquid) and one 4.5 ounce can of diced chiles (with liquid), simply because I did not have Rotel on hand.  Also added a little salt and pepper to taste.

WOW!! Awesome & flavorful recipe!  I did make a few changes however; I used 3 cans of peas (4 just seemed like way too much), and subsituted Chili Fixins Seasoned Ro-Tel for the greenchilies&dicedtomatoes - This gave the gumbo a real kick!!! Overall this gumbo was delicious - & I would've loved it even without the spicyness. This will be a keeper for years to come ~ Thanks!

Made for football watching. Was quite good... but we added several spices since out did not have any. I think it was kosher salt, pepper, cumin, crushed red pepper, tapatio sauce.

Serious flavors here! Everyone loved this! I had people flocking over for it! I used dried beans (soaked overnight) threw everything in a crockpot and tossed in a ham bone left over from Christmas. Severed over rice.  Recipe is perfect! Can't wait for leftovers :)

This turned out so good and was the best tasting Black-Eyed-Pea dish that I have ever had. Yummy. I used frozen BEP's so added another 2 cups of broth and 2 tbls of the Cajun Seasoning mix from this site. Used two cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles. Delicious!

I altered AllRecipes' version to include fresh frozen black eyed peas,  pork bone stock,  shrimp shell stock, sauteed [poblano+sweet red pepper+two onions], shredded pork, five garlic cloves, fresh oregano, two ear's worth of fresh corn kernels,  two pounds fresh steamed shrimp, cumin, salt,  fresh ground black pepper, celery seed, smoked paprika.  The corn went in at the very last. 

I thickened it with refried black bean paste and filet gumbo, then served it with fresh avocado pieces plus fresh chopped cilantro on top.  

My family said 4.5 stars for my version because only grilled fresh fish or smoked medium rare, thick steak or slow smoked pork butt or slow smoked brisket are 5 star foods.

Found this while looking for an interesting vegetarian black eyed pea recipe. I used dried black eyed peas soaked overnight and cooked in the Instant Pot for 12 minutes. Really bland as written. Added thyme, oregano (1 tsp ea.), paprika (1/2 tsp), bay leaf (1 ea.), cumin (1/2 tsp) and cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp) and simmered an additional half-hour for the seasonings to come out.  Still turned out pretty mild. Served with Slap Yo Mamma seasoning at the table to up the spice for those who like it even spicier. I can't imagine eating this without any additional spices or seasonings as it is written unless you're serving this to kids.  

The recipe has good bones and will make it again with the additional seasonings added.

I would say that this is a nice play on gumbo, but do not expect a traditional gumbo. I added some old bay, about 2 tsp.  I added a healthy dose of a hot sauce from Louisiana.  I added 2 types of sausage right at the end, Mississippi  Sausage and Johnsonville Andouille.  Wonderful to eat black-eyed peas for New Year's Day.  I served with Roasted Okra from this website and cornbread and coleslaw.

I made this for New Years Day. In the South, we have a tradition that eating black-eyed peas on New Years Day brings good luck throughout the year. I wanted to do something different with the peas so I made this recipe. It was fantastic. Of course, I added my own twist to the recipe.

I'm admitting this isn't a 'fair' review of this recipe, because my MO is to look at a few similar recipes, and take some items from each. But this is the recipe I used the most of.  I needed to keep it vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth, and fried up some chorizo I had on hand, to add separately. I added some chopped frozen okra to the veggies and chopped carrots. Used cumin, chili powder, creole seasoning all to taste since I didn't have the diced tomato, w/chilies, and omitted the rice.  It's a very good dish; I will continue to tweak it, adding chicken, shrimp and/or andouille sausage to future batches.

Made several modifications to make this vegan & think it turned out pretty good! Cooked 2 (12-oz) pkgs frozen black eyed peas (since most cans are seasoned with pork). Discarded the water and added 2c. vegetable stock in lieu of chicken broth. Added frozen "vegetables for gumbo" in addition to fresh veggies. Made roux with 3T each flour and olive oil (thinned with additional cup veg stock before adding to gumbo). Seasoned with 2t. garlic powder, 1 T. creole seasoning & 1 t. thyme

We all love this gumbo variation! I use the canned black eyed peas with jalapenos and veg broth for the chicken. I simmer longer because it feels better and less celery for personal reasons. I add okra because its gumbo! Thank you so much for sharing Lynn!

It was just ok.  It needed salt and cayenne pepper then it was fantastic.  I have to say gumbo without okra is strange to me but I was surprised.  Next time though we'll add okra.

This was delicious!! I halved everything in the recipe and to cut corners I used frozen diced green pepper , frozen diced onion, and minced garlic in the jar. This is 6 Weight Watcher points for anyone on Weight Watchers.

Great rice & bean dish. I soaked my black eyed peas over night in vegetarian broth. I also added veg broth instead of water. I also added sliced jalapenos from a jar.  It made a lot so I FROZE half of it. Thanks.

Made this for my "foodie" sister and her husband.....they loved it.  Managed to have a little bit left and it was even more delicious the next day.

Pleasantly surprised how delicious this turned out although I did make some edits. I used a fresh jalapeño pepper and swapped carrots for the green pepper and left out the rice. I think the jalapeño added a lot of flavor and sprinkled feta cheese on top. Rave reviews from the husband too.

It was just kind of ehhh when I followed the recipe exactly.  I added ham and hot sauce and that did the trick. I will make it with 2 cans of rotel next time.

I did my best to follow the recipe, but I couldn't get all the ingredients! After visiting 3 grocery stores, the only black eyed peas I found were dry, not canned (about 2 cups dry make up the 60 ounces canned). I couldn't find a can of tomatoes and green chiles and instead used diced tomatoes with chili seasonings, and it was a big enough can that I skipped the regular diced tomatoes.

The recipe is good, but I found it needed extra water (I used extra chicken stock), because there was almost no liquid remaining at the end. You may want to add extra spices to your taste, but I found the seasoning in my canned tomatoes was enough.

This is a good recipe to start, but as you read  most reviewers had to put additional flavor including myself. I added vegetable bouillon cubes along with Cajun seasonings to give  this flavor (my family like lots of flavor). In addition I added smoked sausage and que bueno! Oh so delicious.

I think this was a great base, but a little bland for my taste. No insult to the chef, everyone's taste buds aren't the same... No, it doesn't have the taste of a gumbo, but it's still delicious, whatever you call it.

Very quick & easy & tastes wonderful! I didn't plan ahead & buy dried beans & am really glad to find this recipe! I added water & cnicken bouillon instead of the broth & also added about 1T Italian seasoning. I let it cook 1 hour before adding the rice and also added a package of chopped ham-deelicious!!!

Made this last night. I increased amount of cans blackened peas to 6. Half with jalapenos. I also used one box and one can Swanson chicken broth. The celery in increased to 7stalks, the bell pepper to 2 and onion was a huge onion. You can't go wrong with the holy trinity of ingredients. I found a huge can of hotel at my Kroger store and committed the other can of diced tomatoes. We are garlic lovers so 2 cloves increased to 2 bulbs...don't judge me. I increased the rice to one and a half cups long grain I had on hand and added  salt, pepper, Creole seasoning and GUMBO FILE! Put it all in the tallest stock pot I owned and filled it to  top.  Boiled, simmered, DELICIOUS, SO YUMMY. LOVED IT. WE ALL HAD SECONDS OR THIRDS.!

Recipe was great. A few things I changed.. I used real butter instead of olive oil. I added bacon, garlic salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I also used canned black eyed peas with jalapenos.
This was my first time making black eyed peas and it was a success!

Very good.  I thought people might be interested in how I modified for the pressure cooker.  I only had dry BEPs, and I forgot to soak them in advance, so I followed directions in a pressure cooker cookbook.  I placed the dried BEPs in the pressure cooker and topped with water about 1" over the BEPs.  (This also helped any debris float to the top, which I skimmed off.)  Heated to high pressure then cooked 5 minutes.  After depressurizing the beans were completely soft!  Next, since I had already dirtied the pressure cooker I decided to just make the whole recipe that way.  Only a couple modifications - I added a chopped Anaheim pepper to the celery & onion mixture, because I had one.  Because of that I used plain diced tomatoes, and only 1 can.  Also I doubled the garlic.  Finally, I used about 4 times as much chicken broth, since so much steams off in the pressure cooker.  I cooked it under high pressure for about 9 minutes.  We added salt at the table - would be good with Tabasco as well.  Served with cornbread as recommended.  Yummy and healthy!

Try the recipe as-is first. I added a bit of paprika, oregano, and black pepper, but my additions made the dish too spicy for the youngsters. The adults enjoyed it just fine, though! Cooked up some bits of andouille sausage for a tasty topping.

This one is definitely going in the recipe box! My family loved it, even my 5 and 7 year old. It is so easy to make and its a bonus that it is a healthy dish too. I did add some cajun seasoning because I felt it needed a little extra umph. I also added sriracha to mine and my husband bowl to give it some spice. Look forward to having left overs today!

We are meat eaters but try to incorporate vegetarian meals into our diet frequently.  This is a fantastic recipe to accomplish this with.  Incredibly healthy, gets protein from the black eyed peas and plenty of vegetables with very little fat.  All of that said, it still turns out very tasty and can actually make you forget that you're not eating a traditional meat heavy gumbo...almost.

This was GREAT! I add kielbasa and a little ground black pepper. 
I am writing this review as I eat it with BEER BREAD!
Delicious!

This recipe was good. Spouse and kids ate it but weren't too excited. Perhaps it is because we just don't love black-eyed peas enough! I will try making it again, although I think adding some fresh corn will add a little sweetness and crunch, and my husband said he thought I should sub some of the black-eyed peas with black beans.

I substituted one can of Ro Tel and added sliced andouille sausage with the onions.  Was fabulous. Keeps great in a freezer bag for the most amazing left-overs.  Must serve with corn bread.  Thank you.

I actually made this today! I was in the grocery store ( Publix) and wanted something easy, healthy and good to eat. The dish was so good to me. I'm a fan of black eyed peas. Therefore I felt I couldn't go wrong. I made it exactly as recipe called for. It wasn't  spicy,but my family don't really eat salty or spicy food. This was great for us. The flavors of the onion and the celery came together nicely. Since I have a vegan in the family I didn't add meat to the pan, but as a single dish for one other family member. I added italian turkey sausage to a single dish and it was superb! I will make this dish again.
I tried to add my photo but maybe it was too large.

This was an excellent recipe with a few modifications. I used dried beans instead of canned, tripled the garlic and added salt, chili powder, cholula, cumin and turmeric. I also threw in some chorizo, though it would have been just as good without it. We ate it with both cornbread and fried plantain, and it was delicious.

I added okra in place of some of the celery, and added some extra peas (I used dried ones instead of canned).  You might want to up the seasoning some, but that depends on taste.

Without the 1 tsp. of cajun seasoning, it would have been bland.  However, with the seasoning and some added German sausage, it was fantastic.  Only gave it 3 stars because I had made some modifications based on other reviewers' suggestions.  Also used frozen black eyed peas instead of canned and they were great.  Lastly, used already-cooked leftover brown rice and added it at the end which saved a lot of time.  Husband loved it!

I was surprised with how much flavor there was in this with a lack of seasonings.  I did double the garlic because that is something I tend to do, but my other can of tomatoes was fire roasted with chiles and that might have helped.

I made this for new years day because of the great reviews.  I found it to be a little bland.  So the second day I spiced it up a bit more with a little liquid smoke and a some chopped jalepenos.   So as written I only give it a 3.

We really truly enjoyed this on New Year's Day and it sure did make the house smell good! As I threw everything together I wasn't so sure about it, but once the rice was cooked and it was all done, OMG... it was delicious! My only additions were 1 raw chicken breast (chopped), some cooked chicken andouille sausage (diced), and about .5 to 1.0 tsp of cajun seasoning. Otherwise, exactly as written. I did learn one big lesson. This did not work well as a slow cooker meal... which I thought I'd try so I didn't have to watch it so closely. It worked perfectly until it came time to cook the rice... and it was never going to do that at the 180 deg crockpot temp (at least in the time frame I was seeking!) I removed everthing to a big soup pot, added the rice, and it was ready in just over 45 minutes.

I made this recipe for New Year. It came out great. I also changed slightly to my husband's test. I made with dried beans, added only one can of tomato and added frozen cut okras. Also added one bay leave. My husband loved it. Will make it again.

This is not a gumbo to people that are used to traditional gumbo. But being from Plaquemines parish and raising a family in the Midwest they think of it as gumbo-ish. I added Cajun seasoning, tabasco sauce, lots of garlic and smoked sausage. With homemade buttermilk cornbread every bite was eaten. I think next year I will add bacon.

Made this last year on New Year's Day, and it was DELICIOUS!  Made it exactly as written, only halved it (and I always puree my tomatoes in the Magic Bullet bc my husband and I prefer a sauce rather than chunks in recipes that call for tomatoes).  Hearty, healthy and filling.  Making it again tomorrow for New Year's Day.  Will be a yearly tradition in our home!  Thank you for the recipe!  :)

Very good and heathy. I used yellow pepper as a preference. I accidentally used hot tomatoes with chilis in one can, which really zipped it up. My husband loved that. Planning to freeze leftovers for lunches at another time!

Fantastic dish! As you can see from the many other reviews, you can customize this at will. I added sliced smoked sausage and added corn starch as a thickener to give it a stew-like quality.

I used a frozen bag of ready-to-go soup vegetables, and I added some cajun seasoning that made it anything but bland! (I was a bit too heavy-handed with the seasoning, actually--it cleaned out our sinuses!). Also, I only used a small amount of black-eyed peas (for good luck, of course!) and used other types of beans for the rest. Very good!

Not being a big fan of these beans, I thought I would try and find a more tasty way of preparing them for my family on New Years Day.  My 3 kids did not like this recipe.  My husband said it was okay.  It was better then eating them plain.

Really good, I suggest adding some season all/cajun seasoning to taste and some ham or kielbasa for some more oomph.  I only used 3 stalks of celery and I doubled the amount of chicken broth since I used dried beans that I soaked the night before. I just threw everything in the slow cooker and let it go all day, I cooked and added a cup of rice at the very end.  A keeper and a new family tradition for new years day....thanks for the recipe!

Made this today for the first time and loved it!  I did not have celery on hand so used celery seed instead.  Also added Creole seasoning.  I added too much so will start with about a teaspoon or less next time and adjust up if needed.  I look forward to my leftovers this week and can't wait to make this again.

Fantastic. I added smoked sausage and a bit of creole seasoning. This is very hearty and satisfying.

Made this recipe & it turned out really good. I'm not a big fan of bean soups.  But this was good. I decided to make it in a slow-cooker instead & I added cajun style sausage, which added extra spice & flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

I was reluctant because I don't really like black-eyed peas, but WOW, this is a great soup/stew that really sticks to the ribs. Just like most good stews, it's better the next day. Didn't change a thing expect adding a pinch of red pepper.

Having grown up in New Jersey, I'm not a black-eyed pea lover, but it is standard fare in the south (and Texas) for New Year's Day.  Hubby always makes me eat a spoonful for good luck.  (The one year I didn't, well, the year was a bad one!)  I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  It is absolutely FABULOUS!  I didn't change a thing and  both DH and I loved it.  I ate 2 bowls of the gumbo, so I'm predicting 2011 will be a great year for me!

MMM...My husband and I both loved this. We added chalula, tobasco, 1 TBS chili powder, and increased the amount of vegetables. We doubled the chicken broth and still would have liked it a little more soupy next time. Next time we will add shrimp.

We loved this recipe.  I only give it 4 stars because we added salt and pepper and some chili peppers to give it more flavor.  I also added quite a bit more chicken broth because we used dried beans instead of canned beans (soaked them overnight before cooking).  Pretty easy recipe for so much for leftovers!   Overall a great recipe we will use again!

This was a good meatless meal.  But it was not one of the best I have had.  I used 2 can's rotel instead of 1 and 1 plain tomato.  Also added tobassco and cajan seasoning.

It was a 5 star recipe after the following changes: doubled the garlic, only 3 cans of black beans, added cajun seasoning, 1 lb of sliced andouille sausage (lightly browned), 2 10oz cans of rotel (no regular diced tomatoes), simmered at least an hour and a half.  Lots of flavor, a little kick but definitely not too spicy (there were some guests who don't like spicy foods).  Yum!

Good flavor, but we liked it more as a side.  It needed more substance to stand on its own. Also, I did it in the crockpot as another reviewer suggested, and my rice became quite mushy.

I tried this recipe last night.  I added one teaspoon cajun seasoning, which was just right.  It was very hardy and delicious - perfect for a cold winter night.  I'm keeping this one.

So good!  I added a little extra garlic and some red pepper in addition to the green.  Also I already had some cooked brown rice which I added half way through the simmering time instead of doing the uncooked at the beginning.  Watch the salt as depending on the brand of peas and tomatoes you use the salt content varies widely.  The peas I got had a lot of salt so I rinsed half of the cans and it was still pretty salty.  So just keep that in mind depending on how much of a salt lover you are.  Do try this - super tasty and super easy.

Delicious. I've made this a few times and the recipe always changes because you can throw just about anything in here. This time I added: Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, jalapenos, cayenne, parsley, thyme, 2 bay leaves, and 1 cup okra.  I think this might be a new year's tradition from now on.

This is comfort food to me! YUMMY! I didn't add any extra spices and the flavor was great. I forgot to make cornbread and was anxious to eat so I'll have to do that next time because I WILL be making this again and again.

This was amazing!  I added andouille sausage and some tony chacheres seasoning to it.  i only put 2 cans black eyed peas (don't really care for them) and a can of black beans.  This turned out PERFECt!!!  I will for sure make this again...even if it's not new years day. To go with this I made the Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this site and it went very well....sweet and spicy...what more can you ask for??? Thanks for such a great recipe

I saw this and knew it was for me! Unfortunately the stores were closed. I didn't have brown rice, which I usually have. There were no cans of diced tomatoes either. I used white rice, tomato sauce and sun dried tomatoes.  It is wonderful. Next time I'll use the right ingredients.

We enjoyed this gumbo. I was not sure if I was supposed to drain the tomatoes or not, but I did not. It worked out nice. I added little bit of black pepper and paprika, it was all it needed.

This is really good but I thought it needed more spice and I don't like things real spicey. I'll definitely make it again though with added seasoning.  I added okra from the garden. Would also be good with sausage or what ever left over meat was in the fridge. Edited to say. It wasn't good reheated. Will scale it down next time.

This recipe is a good base for what can be an excellent meal.  I found it needed some type of pork for flavor.  Raiding the fridge, I gave it andouille sausage, ham and a few leftover bacon slices (a much needed improvement).

I really liked this recipe, but my husband just said it was ok- but he isn't a big soup guy.  It was a healthy meal and the only thing I changed was that I added chopped turkey sausage and did not add the rice.  I was really hungry and didn't want to have to wait on the rice to cook.  It had a great flavor!
