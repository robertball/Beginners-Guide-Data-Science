This meal was very tasty. I would recommend cooking the potatoes and carrots first.

Just made this for the first time and it turned out DELICIOUS!!!    Tastes just like home pot pie without the crust!!    I have to agree with cooking the potatoes and carrots first as they took a little longer to cook.......I had to add a little water to the soup and milk so that they could cook until they were done.    I made some garlic cheese drop biscuits and put this over it and I had my chicken pot pie!!!  So easy and quick to fix!   Great meal!

Very Tasty. I also think that the potatoes and carrots should be cooked a little first.

Tasted okay.  Red potatos need to cook longer, taste raw.  Could be a good dish with some tweaks.
