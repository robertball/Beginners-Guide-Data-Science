I didnt use the crockpot.  I cooked it on the stove on med low for about two and a half hours.  I have cooked oxtails many times but wanted to try some new seasonings.  This was ok, but a bit bland for my taste.  I actually prefer mine cooked without the wine (though I love cooking with wine), and seasoned with curry powder.

No changes, liked it very much, even cooking longer than time allowed beef was still a bit tough.    I purchased beef ribs because price wise the same, but more meat on ribs.   So, I guess I did make a change :)

So easy and delicious. I tweaked the recipe a little by adding crushed Garlic, two Bay Leaves, three cap fulls of white vinegar, lemon peeper, garlic salt, and it was fantastic. I also used 1lb of oxtails and 2lbs or short ribs = AMAZING!!

Lovely recipe, with a nice kick. I've made it twice so far. I added a little sugar to the sauce (just for my personal taste). Great with rice (or stir in some cooked noodles at the end).
