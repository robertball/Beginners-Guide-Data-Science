This was pretty good. I used jalapeno & cheddar sausage, dried kidney beans, frozen corn, and southwest salsa.

I've never made chili with sausage before, and honestly it was the best! I didn't have salsa so I used a can if diced tomatoes in chili sauce.

This is a simple yet flavorful alternative to the regular chili.  Using sausage instead of ground beef gives it an extra kick!  Easy to prepare!  I served it with a batch of cornbread.

We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! I did make a few, small changes: I held back on the water, since we like our chili more stew-like, and I add taco seasoning to the sausage when browning it. I also add just a wee bit more chili powder (okay, a LOT more chili powder) because we like it with some fire!

Quick and really good. I changed a few things based on what I had on hand. I used a pound of farmland original sausage, 2 cans of black beans, no water, and 1 can of Rotel in place of the tomatoes and salsa, and dried onion. Used the same amounts of tomato sauce, corn and chili powder. It was a little to spicy for my kids with the Rotel tomatoes added but I loved it. Also added sour cream for the kids to tone it down and a little Colby. I'll be making this again!
