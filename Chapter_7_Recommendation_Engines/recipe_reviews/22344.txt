This is basically a sugar cookie crust with a delicious cream layer and chocolate pudding!  My 13 year old son and 14 year old bro-in-law DO NOT eat pie, but LOVED this and asked for it for Christmas dinner!  Easy and wonderful!!

My 16 year old daughter made this for Mother's Day which is in March in the UK.  We can't get frozen whipped topping here so she used whipped cream, she also decorated the top with whipped cream and cherries. It was absolutely delicious. Many Thanks.

This recipe is great and very quick to whip up.  I have made it a few times now and have even tried different types of pudding in place of the chocolate.  (Our favorites are butterscotch and cookies n cream.)  We have also tried this recipe using an oreo cookie crust, it is so tasty!  As you can tell, we use this as our base and then add whatever kinds you want.  Enjoy.

Super easy crowd pleaser!  I made this dessert for a church potluck and it was gone before I even had a chance to get a piece!  Everybody loved it - especially the crust.  I used a large box of chocolate carmel chip pudding.  It seemed a small box would be a very thin layer of chocolate.

My husband and kids loved this.  It's super easy to make and the ingredients are ones you probably already have at home.  Great for times when you have a craving for something sweet but not too sweet!

I doubled the ingredients for the cookie crust, so it would be thicker. I also used Chocolate Fudge Pudding flavor rather than the plain chocolate. I took another reviewers suggestion and placed sliced strawberries on the cooled cookie crust. It turned out absolutely great!!! You could actually use any flavor of pudding with this recipe....My family absolutely loved it. Will definitely be making this again:)

Great recipe. I find that cooking it in a 13x9in pan is too thin. Next time I will double everything. The family loved it! It was gone within 2 days. Has anyone tried marshmallow fluff instead of the cream cheese mixture? If not , that is my next experiment! :)

The crust recipe is excellent.  I set out to make this recipe, thinking I had all the ingredients on hand.  Not! I didn't have chocolate pudding or the whipped topping but I had whipping cream which I prefer over whipped topping, anyway. So, after making the crust, I mixed the cream cheese,sugar and 1 cup whipping cream together, beating it really well. I put cut up strawberries over the cookie crust and poured over the cream mixture over the strawberries. Not a chocolate pie but a great pie nevertheless.  Mmm mm delicious.
