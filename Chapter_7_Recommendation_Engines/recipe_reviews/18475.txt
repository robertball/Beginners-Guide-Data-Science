Very good recipe, make sure it cools all the way first though.  We ate it while it was still luke warm and it was good but would've been better chilled all the way (we let it chill for 2 hours) but I did not refrigerate the rice after I cooked it so once it mixed in with the other ingredients it was not as cool as we would've liked.

Great flavor.  I reduced the oil to 2 T and the rice to 2 cups, so it was lighter but had more chicken per bite.  I served it outside on the deck with chips and salsa and corn on the cob.  It was a lovely, refreshing summer meal.

This is an incredible recipe. I've made it three times now and each time I improve it a little more. I serve sliced avocado on the side, sliced jalapenos (in addition to those in the recipe) on the side and optional hot sauce and salsa. The flavor is so good. I get rave reviews from everyone. I will make this one again and again.

This was really delicious...and a great change from heavy holiday food!  I added a can of corn and a can of black beans to turn it into a main course.

Nice tasting. If you make it, let it sit overnight so the rice and chicken absorb the wonderful flavor. Tastes better cold too.

This recipe is great.  I love the combination of lime and chicken.  I added a can of corn, a can of black beans, more cilantro (1/4 cup) and left out the rice.  It tastes fantastic!  It's light and easy for a wonderful summer meal.  I think I'll buy tortillas next time to go with the salad.

This was delicious! I didn't add the rice, and I baked the chicken for about 20 minutes. I basted it in olive oil, some garlic powder, and salt and pepper. The chicken turned out great! Also, instead of buying a thing of lime juice, we just used fresh limes. It takes 4 BIG limes to yield 1/4 of a cup.

I needed a somewhat quick & tasty dish for an office Cinco de Mayo luncheon. This looked interesting so I thought I would try it. I am not a great cook so I was nervous when I made it. But everyone liked it! I know that I will use this recipe again in the future!

I've always looked for a lite refreshing mexican inspired chicken salad. This is it! Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. I also top with salsa.

I made this for a bridal shower and everyone loved it.  Not only is it delicious, but pretty also.  The red peppers, avacadoes, rice and cilantro make a very appealing package.  I've made it for my own family since then also with rave reviews.

I've made this recipe several times over the last year and I lve it! Better yet, my non-vegetable eating husband loves it as well as my three year old, but she does like spicy food. I keep the recipe just the way it is.

This is a very good, fresh-tasting chicken salad.  Like some other reviewers, I thought the dressing was a bit on the oily side, so I added some extra lemon juice (had no more lime juice, so I ended up with a mixture that was 3/4 lime and 1/4 lemon juice), which cut down greatly on the oily factor.  I also found that the addition of ground cumin really makes the dressing taste much, much better.  I left out the avocados, only because I decided to make quacamole with them instead, but I will definitely add them next time, as well as black beans and corn.  I thought I'd have leftovers for dinner tonight, but my son finished off what was left for a midnight snack!

Very good, very tasty and it presents well at the table (colorful!). I just added a touch more lime juice.

Although my husband liked this, I didn't particularly like it.  The taste seemed bland and unremarkable.  I would think this  group of ingredients can be combined in other ways (ar amounts) that would be more interesting.

Too spicy for me, I'm a bland food lover. (I know, I know - yuck.) However this was a  HUGE hit on the fourth of July. All the chopping was cumbersome, but it's October and I am STILL getting requests for the recipe!

I made this for a going away party for my sister.  I had never made it before, so I was a little nervous.  It turned out great!  There were a lot of people to feed, I doubled it (sort of) and made a few slight changes:  I used 4 cups of cooked rice and 6 chicken breast halves (marinated for several hours in a spicy salsa!).  I also was only able to use 3 avacados.  It was great.  More chicken per bite and wonderful flavor!  I got rave reviews and many people want the recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe!  It makes a wonderful summer meal with some bread.  I tried making it with a wild rice mix, and I think I'll try it with pasta too.
