I made this for an xmas app and it was a big hit! I only rated it a 4 because i did make a couple minor changes. I added a few Tbsp of the pickle juice and a couple large dallops of sourcream to make it creamier! Will be making it again for sure!

Love pickle wraps and I love this recipe!!  It is requested at every meeting for work!!  I use dill pickle relish instead of chopping up spears.  It's faster to whip together and the juice of the relish makes it a little less thick.  AMAZING!!!

One of my girlfriends brought this recipe to a girls weekend. It didn't look the most appetizing, but she raved that we had to try it! All of us went home with the recipe, we loved it! Made it at home, and my 8 year old pickle lover couldn't get enough!

Wow, sooo much easier than making the wraps! Used dill pickle relish as suggested by others and also added some sour cream to make this a little creamier. We will definetly be making this one again! Update 5/31/12, I make this dip often and it was once requested that I bring some spicy pickle dip. I chopped up some jalapeno's and added with everything else (maybe 2 tbsp of sliced jalapenos chopped)...amazing, but the longer it sits the hotter it gets!

Being asked to bring pickle wraps for a family event this weekend, I was looking for an alternative that would pass for pickle wraps, but wouldn't need pickles.  The one ingredient I didn't have on hand.  I really didn't want to run out for pickles, and really didn't have time, so I found the review by Valerie, where she used dill pickle relish for this recipe.  I had that on hand, so make this Magic Pickle Dip.  It was a hit beyond belief.  My family liked these even better than pickle wraps.  The dill pickle flavor really comes through and by using the dill pickle relish is adds just enough pickle juice to keep the cream cheese spreadable.  It was gone in no time, everyone wanted the recipe and I was told, I didn't have to mess with pickles again, if I promised to bring this dip in place of them.  Loved the recipe, super easy, and I would recommend using dill pickle relish rather than dicing up pickles, unless you have pickles and no relish, then go with the dicing, as I think it would be just as great either way.

This is surprisingly good.  I didn't have dill spears or relish, so I chopped a few hamburger slices.  Will make with better quality pickles next time, but will make again.

I did not care for this. It lacked in flavor. The pickles overwhelmed the beef and cream cheese so much that all you can taste is the pickles. I let it sit overnight in the fridge and tried it again and it wasn't any better.

Excellent!  I find it's easier to use a jar of dill pickle relish (don't drain it!).  It doesn't *look* pretty but boy does it taste good.  Everyone loves it!

People always request my pickle roll-ups but I never thought of making them a dip instead.  Now when I'm feeling lazy or don't have as much prep time I make this dip.  I do use ham instead of beef, though I should try beef sometime.  I also add some garlic salt to taste (just like my pickle roll-ups).

My favorite dip by far!  Sometimes I pour in a little bit of the juice from the pickles to make it softer for dipping with Wheat Thins.

I made this for our family Christmas gathering and it was a huge hit.  I made some additions to the dip.  I added a few spoons of sour cream and a small amount of mayo.  Instead of using beef I used ham.  This tasted like dill pickle roll ups without having to spread the cream cheese on the pickle and roll the ham around it.

I used whipped cream cheese and I added a little onion/garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. EXCELLENT spread on crackers. The boys and I adore this spread--we inhaled it.

It wasn't bad, a little bland.  I would probably add garlic or dill if I made them again.

Like the other reviewers, I cheated and used dill pickle relish, a couple spoons of sour cream, some onion powder, and a pkg of little ham cubes I found in the lunch meat sections.  Served with cracked pepper water crackers.  It was so good I have been asked make a double batch for the Super Bowl party next weekend.

This was super easy to pull together.  I did use pastrami instead of the dried beef since I wanted it to be closer to the pickle rolls we love.  I agree it's a little thick and next time I will use some sour cream to thin it out a bit.  Overall a fun and tasty appetizer.

I use bacon in place of the beef and added a couple tablespoons of sour cream. If you love pickles, you can't go wrong with this dip.

I made this for a potluck meeting. The summertime temps were over 100degrees and I wanted something cool. I chopped up whole dills and added a bit of dill juice to thin it. It was still too thick so I added some sour cream to make a nice dipping consistency. The flavor seemed good to me but it wasn't liked very well at the meeting.  thought it tasted good!

Another ingredient you can use is plain Greek yogurt to add creaminess without altering the flavor!

Any three ingredient recipe that tastes this good is a keeper--took it to a girls' lunch, and brought none home.  Did use ham and dill cubes (used the "dump and taste" method for the amount of cubes).  Served with Pita chips.  Delicious!

The original was far too salty for me. I substituted crumbled turkey bacon for the beef, lowfat cream cheese, and some onion flakes. Like others, I went with the dill relish. Folks ate it up.

This recipe is totally different from the one I grew up on & we didn't put pressed beef in the dip with pickles. How I was taught 1 cream cheese soften, 1 sour cream, chopped white onion, chopped Milwaukee Pickles add pepper & garlic salt to your tasting mix all together let it chill in refrigerator and you can put the pressed beef in same dip bas minus the pickles. A lot better this way & not so thick

This was SO good and easy. I followed a couple reviews and used 8 oz whipped cream cheese and also used about two-thirds of a small jar of dill pickle relish in lieu of pickle spears. It's ready to eat right away. Served with crackers.

this was great just as is...super easy and quick to make and my BF liked it after looking at me side-eyed over the dried beef in a jar lol cream cheese tip: microwave it for about 20-30 seconds to get it soft to easily mix it all up

I did use dill pickle relish, guessing that helped with consistency too.   Everyone loved it.

I made this with a small jar of relish and added about two tablespoons of sour cream to smooth it a bit. It's a simple recipe to whip up when I don't have time but need to bring something. It went over well with my family.

This is the third time I've made this recipe.  My family loves it as written.  Today, I'm making it for a bigger crowd and am going to try adding a couple Tbsp. of sour cream to add some creaminess.  Thanks for sharing... this is a new family favorite!

Love it. I also add a cup of sour cream to break down the thickness.

A friend recommended these tips: use whipped cream cheese, sour cream, dried beef, chopped pickles and pickle juice to taste. Serve chilled with pretzel crackers. With these changes -- 5 stars!!!
