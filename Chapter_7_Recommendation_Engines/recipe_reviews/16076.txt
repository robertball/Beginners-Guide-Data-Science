My 13 month old daughter and I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband did not like it stating it tasted too much like onions (he hates onions).  I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for three.  Also a food processor is a must.  It only took me 10 minutes to prepare this.  I did everything in the processor, shredding cheese and potatoes and chopping the onion.  Also I only cooked for 60 minutes and the casserole was crisp and done.  I had to cover with foil the last 15 minutes and it still burned a little on the sides.  I will start with the foil if I make it again.  This may be due to the larger pan I used (9x11.5).
If you add more cheese I think these would taste just like the potatoes at Cracker Barrel.  I also added about a teaspoon of dried mustard for extra flavor.  
I probably won't make again for home, but may take to a pot luck as I really liked them.

Very good!  I used two large pans and baked them at 350 for an hour then 400 degrees for 10 min.  Great taste, will make it again for sure.

This potato loaf is wonderful for breakfast. Just slice off the number of pieces you need and fry or broil. YUM! I did cut the olive oil in half because it seemed a little greasy the first time I made this. Also, for more flavor I added garlic powder and a touch more salt. Thanks Mindy.

FYI: For those of you concerned with the potatoes turning brown, add water to the bowl of your food processor before grating. Just grate directly into the water.

This is awesome! My boyfriend is Jewish and I make this when he's homesick for traditional food. Even the first time I made it, he said it's as good as any kugel he's ever had, and asks me to make it all the time! I made it for Easter dinner and my Mom and brother loved it too, it was gone right away and now she wants to make it.
My only complaint is how long it takes to make- shredding 3 lbs of potatoes is hard work! I wonder if frozen hash browns would be okay in it?

This was really good, nice and oniony. Also really easy to make since I used the bags of already grated potatos you can find in the meat section of the grocery store.

My family and guests thought this recipe was delicious. Many comments about how good it was, including a good review from my picky son-in-law.
I grated the potatoes and cheese in my food processor, which saved some time, although certainly handgrating would not be a problem. Instead of cooking in a loaf pan, I did as others suggested and used a 9 x 13 inch pan. I found they browned just fine without having to raise the temperature to do so. I also found they were done in about 45 minutes instead of 1 hour. I forgot to squeeze the water out of the potatoes, but found that was not a problem. The potatoes were perfect. I think next time, I might try making them with a bit of a kick by adding some hot sauce, jalapeno peppers, or chili powder.
This was an easy recipe to make, and except for cooking time it didn't take that long to fix.

This is good stuff. Unfortunately, I had to substitute onion powder for the onion on account of a picky hubby, but it was still good.  I found it needed a little longer than the time called for. I fit it into a loaf pan, really packing it in, but maybe next time I will divide it between 2 loaf pans (that way I can add the onion to mine!) The leftovers are great fried or cold and picky hubby has asked me to make it again!

I love this recipe. I added a little sour cream to the mix. We use this as our morning hashbrowns as well. Make them up the day before and heat them in the morning, they are great.

We prepared it for dinner tonight and it was loved by all!  I baked it in 2 casserole dishes rather than a loaf pan this time but I will do the loaf pan next time for more moist finish.  The onion & cheese added a lot to the flavor.  We really enjoyed it!  Thanks!

This recipe was very easy and good...but I sauteed the onions first..as my husband doesn't like them either. To me the potatoes really need the onions...but when cooked first...the flavor is very different. I use this method for potato pancakes as well.

This was great.  The food processor speeds things up, but peeling takes a long time too.  I might try leaving the peal on next time.  I used low fat cheddar, less oil (2 Tbsp), and only two eggs (because I didn't have any more) and it turned out great.

I halved the recipe, used frozen shredded hash browns, and used salt free Spike rather than salt, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  Good taste, but next time I think I'll do more to spice it up a bit.  Looking forward to some leftovers tomorrow for breakfast...!  Thanks for a good potato side-dish!!

Delicious! I definitely will make this again. I made it for my boyfriend and friends, who have had very little exposure to traditional Jewish dishes. They loved it! Like other reviewers, I recommend the use of a food processor to shred all the ingredients. 
Also, I'd use a folded piece of cheesecloth or a very clean baker's towel to squeeze the water out of the potatoes, its easier than using a colander. 
The flavor and consistency of the kugel was perfect, especially with a dollop of sour cream. 
Many Thanks!

I make a potato casserole, but this was easier because you don't have to cook the potatoes first.  I also used the food processor for the potatoes, onion, and cheese, and it came out great.  My husband loved it too!

This is a really delicious dish, and it's pretty easy to make. I use my food processor for the potatoes, onions, and cheese, so that cuts down the prep time significantly. I cut the oil in half because it's a bit greasy as is, and I cut the onion in half because my husband doesn't like a lot of onions. It still has the onion flavor, but just not as strong. This definitely makes too much to fit into a 9 x 5 loaf pan, so I use a loaf pan and a round casserole when I make the full recipe.

I make this recipe all the time.  To save on time for the potatoes, I use the pre packaged hash browns that are in the refrigerated section.  They are fresh and to date no one has even noticed the difference.  I have, it saved me tons of time!  Other than that this recipe is always a hit!

I absolutley love this dish.  I've made it a few times and it just seems like it gets better and better.  I tried making it with hash browns instead.  You know how long it takes to shred 3 lbs of potatoes?  Expanding?  Not an option.  It just doesn't taste the same.  Something in the hash browns.  Very good though.  To make mixing a little easier, I put all my ingredients in a bowl with a lid and shook it like crazy.  Mixed so much easier.

My husband and I really liked this.  I used dehydrated onions, I was out of the fresh, and I added some garlic powder and dried parsley.  I baked in a 13X9 in. pan.  Very tasty.  This is a keeper.

My husband raved about this dish. I did not add any oil but to encourage browning, 'painted' the potatoes with olive oil twice during cooking process.  Excellent result, crispy top covering almost fondant potatoes.  Will be making this again when my family visit for Christmas.   Thanks for this great recipe.

This recipe was easy to make with the food processor.  I recommend you shred (not too finely) the potatoes last since they quickly discolor when exposed to the air.  This dish baked nicely, although the baking time could be increased perhaps by 15 minutes prior to increasing the heat (depending on coarseness of the potatoes).  It was very tasty and I will make it again.

This did not turn out very well. 3 pounds of potatoes was way too much to fit into the 9x5 loaf pan. It tasted as if the potatoes were going bad the day after I made it and I had to throw it all in the garbage. Maybe it would be better in a 9x9 pan.

We didn't really enjoy this. There is nothing wrong with the actual recipe. The potatoes were lovely golden brown & crisp. The flavour just didn't appeal to us. Sorry.

Ok, but next time I'm going to try Pepperjack or smoked Gouda cheese. Really like how crispy this gets.
