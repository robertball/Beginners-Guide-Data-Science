I used fig infused balsamic vinegar. It was a awesome dish. My husband ate it so fast I never took a picture. I will make this again.

So easy and absolutely awesome!  I used a fig balsamic as well and it was off the charts with flavour, a new family favourite!

very easy recipe! I love how the figs added a small amount of sweetness to the chicken. Can't wait to make it again

Some modifications I would do next time: 1.) Chicken doesn't need to be cooked as long as the recipe asks. 6 minutes TOPS in the balsamic-stock solution. 2.) Reduce the solution longer. I did 13 minutes, but it could have gone to 15. 3.) Add a little salt to the reduction.

So delicious. So simple. I was out of rosemary , so used tarragon and thyme. Absolutely delicious. I'll make it again, and again, and again.
