The nutmeg totally ruined it for us...without the nutmeg a solid 4.5 stars.  It was just powerful enough to really take the glace to a 'bad place' for us.  My meatloaf needed an extra 1/2 cup bread crumbs to come together, which is perfectly ok.  Mine was done at 1 hour exact.

Great meatloaf recipe! I did leave out the nutmeg because I didn't really think it was necessary...my husband and I both really enjoyed it. I served it with mashed potatoes and lima beans. Yum, gotta love that comfort food!

I'm surprised someone said the nutmeg ruined it for them, for me it made the recipe. My housemate asked me to make more of the topping next time she liked it so much. I used actual nutmeg and ground it myself probably better flavor than spice island ground nutmeg. I usually use panko instead of bread crumbs a dash or two of worchester sauce and some chopped up bell pepper. It's been a steady in my repertoire and I've never had anyone not finish their plate, and as far as I'm concerned if the plates come back to the kitchen with nothing on them, then it must be good!

Added just a dab of Worcestershire sauce during mixing.
Tastes amazing! Very soft and easy to make.
