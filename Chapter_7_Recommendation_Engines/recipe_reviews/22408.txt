These brownies were soooooo good!!  It's my favorite scratch brownie recipe, by far, and the caramel and nut topping was phenomenal.  I made them for someone at work as a thank you for working for me and everyone she shared them with loved them.  They were pretty easy, too.  I used 35 caramels instead of 25 and a tiny bit more butter and milk...really tiny.  I just like my caramel gooey, I guess, it came out great, very smooth.  A keeper, definitely!!

I don't know what I did wrong, Iv'e never baked anything that turned out un-edible!!! I followed every direction carefully and the batter would just not harded at all.  I cooked it the suggested amount of time and let it sit for a while and it never hardened, so I tried to cook it some more, nothing.  There was way too little flour in this recipe.  It was mainly chocolate,which is fine, but the chocolate didn't harden, it needed more flour.  All I ended up geiing was a brown block that was completely un-edible.  What a waste of chocolate!!!!!

Delicious! I've been making the Baker's One Bowl Brownies for years, passed down from my Mom, but these are my new "specialty brownies"! After all was finished, these are amazing brownies, both aesthetically and "yumm-illy"! These are definitely not for those who are looking for anything less than decadence. I eyeballed a little bit more flour in the batter, for a bit more richness. Use the caramels recipe on this site for even more of a homemade taste! I cooled the brownies on the counter on a wire rack overnight. In the morning I put some wax paper on top and gently pressed the pecans into the caramel to set, then but put them in the fridge for an hour while I got ready for work, took them out and cut them into the prettiest chocolate brownie squares ever! I have to say that I was a little hesitant putting the caramel on the top while the brownies were hot, but with a little patience, it works fine- you HAVE to wait a day (or overnight) to eat these. Also, no need to line the pan. Use a non-stick pan 9" square pan and grease very well (I didn't flour either)and the brownies will come out great and very clean after refrigeration. Next time, I will drizzle the extra caramel over the top of the pecans as well. I will still stick to my classic Baker's brownies recipe because it is such a staple in my family, and it is a differnt type of brownie, both are equally as delicious, but these are great for a special calorie-laden treat. They look bakery made and taste even better.

The brownies were very cakey but still very good.  Next time i make these i would add some chopped up pieces of caramel and nuts to the batter and then add some more on top.  Overall,  very good and easy to make.

This is THE best dessert that I have ever made, and I've made a lot of desserts!  I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 11 x 15 just 2 minutes or so longer.  I also used margarine in the recipe and heavy cream instead of milk in the caramel sauce.  I took them to our first PTA meeting of the year with rave reviews.  They are time consuming to make, which is nice only because you won't be able to eat too many of them, too often.  Fantastic!

my family absolutely loved these brownies.  I will try the carmel sauce next time.  Unwrapping the caramels was time consuming, a one reviewer mentioned.

This is a very simple recipe that takes only a few minitues to make, but will create compliments to the preparer.  I liked this dessert heated in the microwave and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

It is definitely a decadent dish.  If you do not have a sweet tooth you will likely not care for this dish.  Luckily, I have a sweet tooth.  I made this without the nuts.  It definitely needs the nuts to counter the sweet, but for various reasons - we don't do nuts in our house.  I made this a second time and replaced the nuts with toffee (you canuse something like a Heath bar chopped up)it turned out fabulous.  Also, the seond time I made it I used Worthers Originals caramels rather than Kraft caramels... fabulous.

This recipe is really good, but I do have a few recommendations. I don't recommend that you use foil to line the baking pan.  Just grease the baking pan with vegetable oil. Also this receipe makes too much carmel topping. I found that if you use about twelve to fifteen carmels instead of twenty five, it was more that enought to spread over the pecan bars. You can also use walnuts instead of pecans.

Very good recipe!  It seems that it would turn out extremely sweet, but it isn't too sweet at all.  The perfect sweetness.  I made it twice in 3 days: that's how good it is!  Addictive.

Really tasty but very messy.  Fairly easy to make, though -- the hardest part was lining the baking dish with foil, and then greasing/flouring it!  The foil kept ripping on me when I tried to fit it into the baking dish, and then again while I was greasing it.  But since the caramel was so messy, the foil really helped with the clean-up.  It was taking forever for the butter/water/sugar mixture to come to a boil at low -- after about 20 minutes I bumped the heat up to medium.  (Could be my stove though.)  I discovered too late that I didn't have milk for the caramel sauce, so I used water instead, and it seemed to work fine.  Also, I scattered a few butterscotch chips among the chocolate chips in the topping and then put the pecans on after that.  I let it sit overnight to cool before cutting it.  It was still pretty gooey the next morning, but I was able to cut it up.  Good thing I had the foil in the pan -- I just lifted the entire thing out of the pan and peeled the foil away, otherwise I would probably still be trying to extricate the bars from the baking dish!  But overall, a really good recipe, and not too difficult.  Everyone loved them, and I will probably make them again.

These are sinfully delicious.  Very very rich, but that's what I like.  If you don't like sweet and rich, this is not a recipe for you.  Dangerous to have around because they WILL disappear. I made them per recipe.No changes!

Absolutely fabulous and easy! A perfect way to dress up an average brownie. I brought it to a pot-luck and it was the hit of the party. Everyone thought that I had spent hours on them!

These were absolutely WONDERFUL!  I made them for a family reunion.. brought home an empty pan!! I used twice the caramels tho because we love caramel.  I had to bake longer than the recipe stated...used the toothpick test to check if done.  Best to make a day ahead of time so the chocolate and caramel have a chance to set up firm.
Will definitely be making these again!
Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a pretty good brownie.  The only thing I didn't like was that the directions call for pouring the caramel on the fresh out of the oven brownies.  It made them a little too gooey, which isn't altogether bad, it just took several long hours to set up enough to cut and serve.  Those were very long unbearable hours!!  Good though the next day.

Here I used a boxed brownie mix (Duncan Hines).  I made the recipe fudgey and with the gooey caramel topping...let's just say HEAVEN!  I would go for a little more nut topping to balance all the gooeyness or make the brownies more cakelike.  Just a good recipe.
