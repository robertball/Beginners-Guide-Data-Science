So easy. I didn't have feta cheese, so I used Parmesan cheese instead! It turned out great!

This recipe was really tasty. I used baby kale so I could skip the steaming and Kraft Sundried  Tomato & Oregano dressing. Delicious!

Double the quinoa and add an extra tbsp of dressing. I used Kraft Italian zesty lime. YUM. Cilantro would also be good in this.

This recipe was delicious! And fit the requirements for my Uncle who is vegetarian and on the Candida diet. I just had to make my own Italian dressing that excluded sugar. Thank you for the yummy recipe

Excellent!  I had to substitute asparagus for the avocado due to allergies, but I'm sure it's amazing as is.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper....

Tastes delicious and very refreshing!  I seasoned my quinoa with salt, turmeric, and onion powder so that it could make the entire dish tasty- Enough to not have to use any dressing. I also doubled the ingredients. Turned out ????
