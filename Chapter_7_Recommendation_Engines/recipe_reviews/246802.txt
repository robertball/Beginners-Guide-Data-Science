This is interesting. At first I wasn't sure if I liked it--it's just different, more like a watered down cream of wheat in texture than oatmeal. Once I started eating it, I liked it. It has a nice flavor. I put pecans and toasted coconut on it, and I really needed that crunch to enjoy this. I didn't have any fresh fruit, but I think blueberries would be good.
