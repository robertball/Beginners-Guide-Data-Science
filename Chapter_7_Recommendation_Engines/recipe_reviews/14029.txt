This is a wonderful and colorful dish that tastes as good as it looks.  The tomatoes made plenty of liquid when I made it and the only thing I added was a little basil.    Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy to make, perfect for all the veggies out of the garden, and tasty. Only thing I did differently was pretty much cubed all the veggies instead of shred, dice, or slice. Also, I used scallions since that was the only type of onion I had. Turned out great.

I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with juice instead of fresh. Added 1 tsp salt & 1 tsp basil and a can of black beans to make it more hearty. Hubby liked it and he isn't a squash fan.

Very good dish! I also needed to add some liquid, used Vegetable stock I had on hand. I added some cannelini beans to the rice and had a complete vegetarian summer meal!

This was great - I added some dried oregano and parmesan cheese to give it a little more zip.

This has become a staple in my house.  It is so healthy and so great tasting, but I made some modifications.  I added oregano, basil, McCormick Roasted Garlic and Bell Pepper seasoning, McCormick Garlic Pepper, and used mini sweet peppers (red/yellow/orange) instead of green.  I also used Italian style canned diced tomatoes with the juice.  I bought julienne carrots in the bag (easy) and used a lot more garlic.  I serve it over Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil Couscous that has been seasoned with the two McCormick seasonings above.  I absolutely love this dish!  Just wonderful!!

I make this dish all the time. My family loves it!. For more flavor add 1/2 cup of salsa (or) pasta sauce and parmesan cheese, when the squash is just about done. The flavor is amazing!

Very, very tasty dish and incredibley easy to put together.  I chose to cube the zucchini, slice the carrots instead of grating and omitted the garlic.  I also added a little shredded cheese just before serving.  Excellent - no leftovers!

This was really just okay.  
We sort of missed having some kind of sauce or something.
We even added some fresh basil.
Served over brown rice alongside a veggie patty.  Very filling meal, just didnâ€™t thrill us.

I've been cooking a lot lately with zucchini and a few of the recipes had cream cheese added, so I added 2 TBsp of cream cheese.  YUM!!

This dish is very easy but the name should be changed to stir fry because that is all it is. Also it isn't much of a main dish unless you are planning on just eating a light stir fry. I also added speghetti seasoning mix (basil, oregono, parsley, etc.)

I wasn't really crazy about this recipe.  I don't know if it is because I used a food processor to cut the veggies, and they were too thin?  It just came out very watery and not very flavorful.  May be okay for a side dish, but for a main dish it was lacking.
