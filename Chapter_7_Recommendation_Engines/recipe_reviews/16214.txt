This is great! I've been making it for ages. One thing though... use 3 cups of chicken broth otherwise it is a little dry. I also substitue 3 teaspoons of dried basil for fresh. Increase the garlic to 6 cloves.

Not thrilled with the turnout.  I used 4 chicken breasts and per previous review, added another cup of chicken broth. It baked and looked fine but the taste was something to be desired.  It was one of those meals where we all sat around the dinner table...eating in silence because no one wanted to comment on the obvious...that dinner was not that good.  We ate it but quickly threw away the leftovers.  I just think that different spices need to be used but can't say what.  Sorry, I just won't be making again.

I think the flavor was okay, but the instructions for baking it was completely off the mark. This was one of my first times using a recipe from this web site, and I have learned a lesson the hard way....from now on, I will read the reviews before attempting a recipe. This baked in my oven for a total of two hours, and the rice was still not done. I added more chicken broth, and still had to cook it for another 45 minutes. My children just about gave up on dinner while waiting.

Good idea, but I, like others added to it.  I saueteed onions, spinach, and chopped fresh tomatoes in olive oil.  I added about 1 cup more chicken broth, and I pre-salted the chicken pieces.  The chicken was properly seasoned, but the rest of the rice was too salty.  Also, the rice remained crunchy even though I cooked the dish for about 2 hours.  It took that long for the chicken to cook all the way through.  I'll keep the recipe, but next time, I might partially cook the rice before adding it to the rest of the mixture.

i really liked this dish, but made some adjustments to make it more flavourful. i chopped one medium onion and sauted it in a frying pan with some olive oil, then added the fresh mushrooms, 3 garlic cloves chopped and some diced zuccini.  cook until mushrooms just wilted and still lots of liquid. add to caserole dish. i also added 3 cups chicken broth, on suggestion, and it worked well. one thing i don't like about this dish is that the chicken comes out bland. i tried salting the chicken pieces and then frying them for 8-10 mins (until golden brown on outside)in a bit of olive oil.  still wasn't as i would have liked, but was better. also i used cream of asparagus soup.

This is just an excellent-tasting recipe that is surprisingly easy to make.  I usually leave out the green pepper and add more green onions.  I also use chicken breasts for my husband because he doesn't care for thighs.  It doesn't make much of a difference.

I have enhanced this Risotto with Chicken by adding 1.5 lbs of Arborio Rice, homemade Chicken Broth, fresh herbs and spices, 1/4 tspn of Saffron threads, Red Wine Vinegar, fresh red pepper, tomato, parsley, diced green scallions, fresh carrots diced, white pepper, olive oil, white wine vinegar, tomato sauce, onion diced, green olives stuffed with pimento, and green peas.  This is a traditional Arroz con Pollo, Cuban-style for a Risotto with Chicken.

This was so good!  It turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe as is.  Although I only had a 14 oz can chicken broth.  Also, I added 8 pieces of skinless chicken.  When covering with the foil, I made sure all the edges were sealed tight to keep the moisture in so the rice and chicken would cook better.  I don't think I need to make any changes, otherwise.

Enjoyed this....I definitely recommend the 3 cups of broth although I put in some white wine with this which gave it quite a distinctive flavor.  Will definitely try this one again.

This was dry! Nothing like risotto i've tasted. It's ok. Seasonings were good, but it's not the greatest recipe. I wanted the rice to be more moist and sticky. It was dry.. more like pilaf!

Very dry and not very flavorful. I ended up adding chicken gravy to get my husband and kids to eat it. I like the idea of it again so I probably will make it again with some modifications.

This recipe was a complete disaster. Cooked it for over 3 hours and the rice was still hard. Ended up in the trash.

I always thought risotto would be hard but this was easy and it came out so great. I added the extra broth like some of the others did and it was so moist. This meal will go into the regular roation!

This was great! I cut the chicken into smaller bits to reduce cooking time. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and left out the bell pepper. Add spices to your liking. Wonderful flavor!

We did not care for this very much. I did make some adjustments though after reading all the reviews. I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, I added 1 cup white wine to the chicken broth, I used fresh garlic and onion (sauted), I used cream of broccoli soup, I added sliced zucchini, and I used part fresh basil and part dried. I'm not sure that these adjustments effected how this meal turned out although I wouldn't expect that it would have been much different. In any case, the rice and chicken was too dry, it was pretty flavorless and the little flavor that this did have just wasn't very good. Everyone just sorta picked at this.

This is horrible!  I made the following modification based on reviewers: added an extra cup of broth, sauteed onions, garlic and mushrooms first before mixing.  I baked it for 90 minutes and the rice was still hard.  I proceeded to put it back in the oven for another 45 minutes and some parts came out done and other parts were still hard.  On the part that was done, the flavor was not terrible - very bland except the strong taste of oregano.

This recipe is quite good but needs some adjustment.  I found the rice to be too dry so - I would add about a half a cup less of rice.  I must say - the garlic was so potent to smell but didn't taste potent.
I will make it again with less rice.

Way too garlicky...and we're garlic lovers! Is easy for a one-dish meal. As other reviews said...needs more liquid. I added 1/2 cup more broth.

This was a hit with my whole family, kids included! I was nervous that my rice would turn out "crunchy" (based on some of the reviews), but it was perfect-o. I did change it to 3 cups of broth, as others advised. Other than that, I didn't change it, and it was delicious.  Will definitely make this a regular on our dinner table.

Tasted great.  I only had instant rice on hand so instead of putting the rice in for the full hour; I put it in for the last 15min so it wouldn't get overcooked.

"It's...um...good." That's all I could manage to tell my boyfriend when he made this dry and tasteless dish for me last night. A surprisingly unexciting casserole, given the spices, garlic, and extra can of chicken broth he added. The only real flavor, and color for that matter, came from the breadcrumbs generously layered on top. If it's true risotto you're after, skip this bland and boring rice bake for something better.

The recipe turned out excellent but I changed some things: I used organic chicken breast because we are a "no-bones" household, I used two boxes of alfredo rizotto (it is a different grain!) I also threw in the powdered alfredo sauce, I used fresh herbs and fresh onion minced, I also added fresh gaarlic minced, I put in more bell pepper half green and half orange. I did not have any bread crumbs so I over-toasted two slices of whole wheat bread.
Everyone ate so much they had to go to bed early!

I was actually quite surprised at how well this dish turned out.  It was quite delectable.  I didn't have peppers and replaced the legs with full chicken breasts.  The chicken turned out to be the most tender that I've had in a while.  In a cassarole dish, I would bake an additional ten minutes to be sure full-size rice is completely done.  Other than that, I wouldn't make any other changes.  I definitely liked it and will do this dish again in the future.

I used Basmati rice instead of white and perhaps this is why this recipe 
wasn't enjoyed by us. My husband and I didn't mind the first few bites, but
after that, it went downhill. I would recommend more chicken broth as well
and would not use flavored rice next time. Very easy to make though with 
more time to relax before supper !

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed previous
recommendations to increase the chicken broth.  I
used 3 cups and the rice cooked up perfectly.

Tasted fine but directions as posted with Thai Jasmin rice, did not cook the rice properly. Cook the rice first.

I have 5 grown men to feed and I must say this recipe is wonderful to have in the box. The first time I made it, they devoured it.  I used Campbell's Cream of Cremini & shitake mushroom soup instead of the basic one. The second time I changed the veggies to cauliflower, broccoli and zucchini.  I had no basil so I used Herbes de Provence.  Amazing again.  I use the delay bake on my oven so that I can get it in early and have it ready at dinner.  It literally takes 10 minutes to throw together and that's it.   It's a wonderful basic recipe that can be modified with any cream soup and vegetables.  Use up what's in the fridge and have some fun with it.  Mix it up and enjoy!

Definitely needed 3 cups of chicken broth to keep the chicken moist, but my husband liked the dryness if the risotto since he doesn't like it soupy. It was perfectly cooked but it was firm. I followed the recipe exactly and my family ate it all.

This recipe was okay. Agree that the cooking time is off; needs more. Flavor needs some more pop.

Not my favorite. I used chicken breast and they were very overcooked. Other than that tasted ok. Will not make again.

This is an absolutely delicious dish! The flavor of the risotto was scrumptious and complimented the chicken very well. I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 2 cups and the outcome was perfectly moist rice and juicy, tender chicken. My husband and 9 year old stepson give it a resounding 5 stars. This is definitely a keeper!

What a burst of flavor!  This will be a family favorite!  The next time I fix I will add a little more chicken broth, my rice was a little dry.

My Chicken Risotto came out very dry, even the chicken was
too dry.  I believe it could be a very good meal if I adjusted it 
a little. I'm not sure if it was my oven or the recipe.  I will make 
again with more liquid this time.

I've made this several times after finding it on the site.  Excellent flavor and texture and one-dish ease.  Great for long-cooked casserole lovers..

Since Risotto is one of my favorite
foods, I was thrilled to find a recipe
adding chicken. I had tried several times
on my own to add meat to a risotto with
not so great results. This was done 
perfect, and enjoyed by all!
