First, I'd like to say love the color that the peas and carrots add to this salad. I didn't use near all the mustard as I knew it would be too overpowering for my family. I'm sure next time I will add a bit of onion, but this recipe can be changed so easily to fit your needs and is very attractive looking.

I love this potato salad!  The first time I made it was right after we got back from Israel.  I was so inspired by my sister-in-law's amazing Shabbat meal for 16 (!!!) that I had to do an Israeli Shabbat at our house.  Best potato salad ever and I love the pickles, but NO ONIONS!! Yay!  Thank you for giving me the ability to bring a little Israel into Texas for my Israeli husband!!!

I like all kinds of potato salad and this is one I will be adding to my recipe box.  I was not sure about the pickles, so I brined chopped cucumber for a week.  It was very good!  Will make again!

Just realized I never reviewed this, just took a blurry photo a while back. :) I really liked it! We didn't have frozen peas and carrots, just peas; I diced carrots and blanched them in the potato cooking water for about two minutes, then chilled them. I found a can of Israeli pickles in the "ethnic" section of my market. I definitely want to make this again! I love the mustard flavor, too.

This is very similar to the Ukrainian "Mayonnaise" version of the salad, which my sister and I refer to as the "Cube" salad because everything has to be cubed such that all the salad pieces are roughly the size of the peas. I didn't have pickles on hand so I didn't add those in, but typically I'll use Dill (Polish) pickles since those are my favorite. Another addition that works great if you have it is cooked ham, cubed, and scallions. I used a can of peas, drained. I also used fresh carrots, boiled them, and then cubed them (as much as one can cube carrots, really). Since I'm trying to avoid starches, I cut down significantly on the potatoes, doing only about three large potatoes.

Hi All - This is the original recipe poster, here.  Just a note about the Israeli pickles - these are NOT Kosher pickles.  They are usually imported from Israel, or they are noted as Israeli-style.  These pickles can be found in the international or Kosher sections of many supermarkets.  You may also be able to find them in the refrigerated section, where hummus is sold (Sabra brand).  These pickles don't have much of a vinegary bite to them, hence the amount of mustard called for in the recipe.

Love this! It's great alternative to regular ol' potato salad. And being I've never been a fan of celery, like that this still has the crunch from the pickles. Yummy stuff!

I thought this potato salad was good. I liked the extra color the carrots and peas gave to it. I used Kraft mayo with olive oil and dijon mustard, as it was what I had. The only downside is the pickle taste was very strong and so was the vinegar bite from the mustard. I have never heard of Israeli pickles, so I used the type I had. I wish the recipe would have been more specific of the type. I believe it could have been Kosher. I think the spicy mustard may have been even stronger. I don't know. I am certain it will all get eaten though.

I used celery and onion instead of peas and carrots,  but otherwise made the recipe is written.  This is the best potato salad recipe I've found so far.  Simple but flavorful.

This is a family favourite from my childhood and my mother usually also added chopped pickled herring. I didn't have frozen carrots so cooked and sliced some baby carrots. I added a tablespoon of diced red onion, some left over red pepper (also diced) and I substituted a tablespoon of sour cream for some of the mayonnaise and mustard. For garnish I chopped some fresh cilantro. It's a great stand by to keep in the fridge to go with just about anything. I will definitely be making it more often.
