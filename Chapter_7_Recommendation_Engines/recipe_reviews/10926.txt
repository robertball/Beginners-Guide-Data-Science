This is about as easy as it gets for a cookie recipe.  Rip open a box of cake mix, plop in two eggs and a little oil, and voila!  Great cookies!  I made mine too big, so by the time they cooked on top, the bottoms were pretty well done.  Just follow the recipe and make "little balls" and you'll be  good to go!
UPDATE:  I made these the next night  with lemon cake mix.  I scooped a bit up with a teaspoon, rolled it in a ball, dipped it in sugar and baked.  They were super delicious.  Another Update:  We made these with dark chocolate cake mix and 1/2 bag of chocolate chips.  The best yet!  Perfection.

I LOVE this recipe! I love it's versatility and how quickly it can be prepared.  I've tried several variations so far...yellow cake mix, with a chocolate drizzle...this were ok.  Then I tried chocolate cookies, rolling some of the balls in powdered sugar, and some in cocoa powder.  The cocoa powder disappeared, both in flavor and appearance.  But the powdered sugar comes out really nicely and tastes great.  However, my favorite variation so far was the one I just tried.  I followed the recipe exactly...choosing a BC Butter Pecan Cake mix.  Then I rolled the balls in a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon.  When I put them on the cookie sheet, I flattened them into little patties with my fingertips.  I let them bake just until they had risen a little.  I pulled them out before they had a chance to brown really (the cinnamon gives that appearance) and they were still very chewy in the middle when they were all cool.  I think it was about 7-8 minutes.  They were DIVINE!  I think they're my favorite cookie of all time, even better than chocolate chip cookies.  So try this variation, I think you'll like it.

These are great cookies when you don't want to  mess with a lot of indgredients.  I read all of the reviews on the cookies with cake mixes and this is what I came up with.  I used 2 eggs, a yellow cake mix with pudding, 1/2 cup of oil, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and 1 1/3 cups quick cooking oatmeal.  I used a cookie scoop, patted the cookies flat and dipped them in a mix of cinnamon and sugar.  I baked them on a stone for about 10 minutes.  I removed them when they were still pretty gooey in the middle.  I let them sit on the cookie sheet for at least 2 minutes before removing them to cool on foil.  The next day, they are still crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  They turned out like "snickerdoodles" which is one of my families favorites.  My kids loved these, they were so easy to make, and I enjoyed one with a cup of coffee this morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great cookies.  For those having trouble - too oily, too gooey, etc., it could be because you used the 15.25 ounce (Betty Crocker) cake mix rather than the 18.25 ounce size (Duncan Hines or Pillsbury).  Betty Crocker pulled that little stunt a while back.  And then they price the mix at $1.00 on sale, making you think you're getting one heck of a deal.  Believe me, you're not!  The loss of 3 ounces is significant in many recipes and shame on this company for trying to dupe us!  Try this recipe with Duncan Hines.... it's terrific!

Can you believe this recipe only has 3 ingredients?!?! It is AWESOME. My husband said they were the best cookies I ever made. I used Cherry Chip Cake Mix and added 1 1/2 Cups of Semi Sweet Chocolate Chips. Wow. Soooooo Good! I recommend putting them in an airtight container. If you do this, they'll stay soft for 3+ days. I am going to try other combos like, Fun Chip Cake Mix with White Chocolate Chips or Chocolate Cake Mix with White Chocolate Chips and Macadamia Nuts or Banana Cake with Butterscotch Chips or White Cake Mix with Buttercream Frosting. Have fun with this recipe, it ROCKS!!!

I had a pineapple cake mix I really didn't know what to do with.  I like to buy mixes just for cookies, and I like to try different recipes on here using them.  I added 10 oz can drained crushed pineapple (squeezing out through 2 coffee filters works better than a collander) and 1/3 cup shredded coconut.  Had half a tangerine and grated the zest of it also.  These made a wonderfully fluffy soft cake-like cookie.  Some of the coconut toasted which gave it a really nice flavor.  These were a wonderful combination with the pineapple mix, crushed pineapple, and coconut.  The batter was a softer batter I think because of the crushed pineapple, and although they did spread a bit, they weren't flat, but rose nicely and very soft.  Very nice recipe.

Great, easy recipe.  I used the white cake mix and added vanilla and pecans b/c this was all I had on hand.  They were very moist.  I'm anxious to try other variations.  Hint... to keep cookies moist - stick a piece of bread in with them in an air tight container and this will help to keep cookies soft for longer.

Awesome and so simple (don't even need a mixer)- I took popsicle sticks and stuck them in the balls of dough before baking - the kids loved frosting and decorating to make their own "lollipops".

My mother-in-law gave me a recipe similar to this that called for rolling the dough into a ball around a Rolo candy and then rolling the cookie in powdered sugar before baking.  The finished cookies have a cool crinkly look.

YUMMY.  These were delicious and easy.  They didn't have as much "sweet" as the cookies that I am used to.  I did add some vanilla and some milk chocolate chips.  Have to admit the cooking time threw me...there is a huge difference between 4 and 10 minutes...mine took about 8 1/2 to 9.  Thanks for the post.

I am 9 years old and I made these cookies all by myself.  I used a Party Rainbow White cake mix.
They were beautiful and yummy. Rebecca

I have made this recipe several times with my kids because it is so very simple.  For the cookie to have flavor, you need to buy a mix with flavor. Chocolate is our favorite but we have also enjoyed lemon, orange, funfetti, and strawberry.  If you are using a white or yellow cake mix, those don't have any flavor as a cake and therefore won't have any as a cookie.  If I don't have a flavorful mix on hand, I will add lemon juice, or peppermint extract, or some other flavor agent so that the cookie will not be bland.  I have also noticed that some of the cheaper mixes don't make as nice of a cookie compared to some of the more expensive mixes, particularly where taste is concerned.    Once I make the dough I sometimes roll it into a log and refrigerate for an hour or so.  Once the roll is cold it is easy to slice in even 1/4 inch circles for baking.  .  Sometimes I will roll in sugar, nuts, or coconut for added flavor and texture before baking.   You need to watch while baking as these seem to brown quickly at the end and can be easily overcooked.

1 package of cake mix, 1/2 cup oil and JUST 1 EGG (not 2) and you will get a perfect cookie not a cake like one. I promise. Yummy :):)

I'm impressed!  I felt like baking today but didn't have much time. This recipe was a good pick. I had these cookies in and out of the oven in no time.  But more important, they're really good! I'm really impressed! I used a devils' food cake mix, butter rather than oil, and added one teaspoon each of vanilla and chocolate extracts. For added measure I threw in a bag of semi-sweet & white chocolate swirl baking chips. If not overbaked these taste like a gooey, fudgey brownie. After chilling the dough until somewhat firm, I dropped them by small cookie scoopfuls, didn't flatten them at all, and baked about 10-1/2 minutes. Now here's a good use for a cake mix, that doesn't taste like a cake mix!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe. I am not a cook or a baker but this was SO EASY to make - I made a batch this morning while my son had breakfast! (so not typical of me) I made them for a cookie exchange, so I had to make a lot. I did Red Velvet cake mix with white chocolate chips mixed in.  The first two batches (which were combined) I did with 1/2 cup oil (1 cup total).  Did another batch this morning using only 1/3 cup oil and I think they came out better and softer so that's what I'll do in the future, with about 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.  I baked them for about 8 mins, taking them out of the oven when the top started to crack.  The batch with less oil is chewier.  Also, I think I made mine really small (I was trying to make enough for the exhchange) - so I got 62 out of this morning's batch, even though the recipe says 48.  I got about 210 cookies out of 3 batches (3 cake mixes, 6 eggs, and oil).  HTH!  This will definitely become my new cookie b/c they were so easy to whip up in a hurry!  4 stars b/c the first batch just seemed to have too much oil.  1/3 cup oil and these are 5 star!

Just a word of caution:  The recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. box of cake mix.  I thought all cake mixes were in the same size box.  After I had assembled the recipe and it was really sticky, I glanced at the box I used, and it was 15.25 oz. That really is enough to make the recipe not work.  I added some other to it and my husband and I could tell it was a really good recipe.  Just be sure to check the size of your cake mix, it makes all the difference in the world.

Wonderful, and if I may, if they turn out great for me, then everyone should have smashing results.  I am just not a baker, and really hardly ever eat sweets, which leaves me lacking a lot of ingredients needed for and impromtu sweet tooth.  For some reason tonight, I had that semi-annual attack, and thanks to a similar attack some months back, that passed before I had a chance to make anything, I had a box of cake mix!  I made them exactly as written and they were amazing.  I love lemon, so I made a powdered sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice glaze to top them and it's yummy.  I put half the dough in the freezer to make up later.  Thanks Hannah for a great recipe (especially for we baking challenged)!

These were pretty easy and tasted good!... I cut the oil down to 1/3 cup and  used a glass to flatten them before baking...  Didn't bother to frost because I used funfetti cake mix with sprinkles inside the mix... Thanks!

As a gift for friend who like german chocolate cake, I made these cookies with german chocolate cake mix and made sandwich cookies with coconut pecan frosting in between.   My husband thinks they are better than the actual cake!

Holy cow!  This recipe is so easy and the results are so good.  I tried another variation of this recipe using milk chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips.  They were like giant reese cups!  I can't waitto try other variations, I have so many ideas now!

These are super soft chewy cookies!!  The only drawback is they are really greasy!  I made a second time using 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, it helped cut the greasiness down, and they were still moist & chewy!

This is a great key recipe, but it screams for flavor/texture additions. Didn't have white cake mix so I used yellow. As for the additions I added 1/2 cup each of chopped walnuts and butterscotch morsels. I spread the entire batter onto a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet and baked at 325 for 18 minutes (rotating pan halfway through). Cooled in pan for 2 or 3 minutes then I flipped pan onto large cutting board then peeled off the paper. Nice, golden color. I cut 32 squares but probably could have cut into even smaller pieces for 3 dozen! The texture was amazingly soft and chewy. Pan cookies are great when you don't have many cookie sheets and don't want to wait around for a second batch.

This is my first time ever making any cake mix cookie recipe. I was quite surprised that they turned out pretty darn good. They are ridiculously easy to make, and require such few ingredients. I usually bake from scratch, but being in a hurry, you can't beat these cookies. I used Duncan Hines red velvet cake mix, and made little sandwiches using Duncan Hines cream cheese frosting. I tasted one of these plain, and thought they needed something else. I didn't think they were too sweet at all. The frosting made them so much better. That may be because I didn't use a white cake mix, so I don't know if that makes a difference. I would make these again for sure, trying other flavors of cake mixes. I do think these are better frosted or made into sandwiches. Next time I would like to try lemon with vanilla frosting, or strawberry with chocolate frosting. Very simple recipe, mine baked perfectly in 9 minutes. Thanks :)

I found the same recipe with a couple of extras.. 3 eggs, 2cps of instant oatmeal, 1/2 c of sugar, tsp of vanilla, 1 box of cake mix(any kind) I've made these cookies over 3x's in the past 2 weeks and I've used all different cake mixes each time and the best added ingredient MIX INTO  "cake dough" a cup of your favorite add-on (shredded coconut, walnuts, pecans, chocolate chips...you get the idea; even a combo of ingredients works too as long as it's a cup full) then spoon out and place on cookie sheet on top of parchment paper(so it doesn't stick) place in preheated oven at 350 degrees and take out at 10-11 minutes..so they are soft..let cool then remove and put on cookie dish they'll go fast but with these ingredients you can easily make @ 36 cookies and 1 big 6" cookie for the cook!

My 11 year old daughter made these for a cookie swap, and they turned out delicious.  We made one with devil's food cake mix and one with yellow cake mix.  This is the easiest cookie recipe ever.  Thanks!

This is the recipe found on the box, it's perfect as is! Mine took almost the whole 10 mintues to bake.  For christmas, I used a red velvet cake mix, added chocolate chips, and smashed candy canes into cream cheese icing. I then added extra crushed candy canes to the icinged cookies. They were delicious and easy to make!

Five plus stars for overall "bang"! You can normally find cake mixes at the 99 cent store and sometimes Target has them on sale of 89 cents. My local grocery store has even had a coupon for less than that. Bottom line - for five minutes mixing time and about a buck you can have warm cookies from the oven. You can't top that!!! Do yourself a favor and stock up on cake mixes next time they are on sale. You will always have a cookie trick up your sleeve.

These are blissfully simple, and the flavor options are only limited by your imagination.  Tons of different cake mix flavors out there, tons of yummies to add - I used milk chocolate cake mix and added Kraft caramel bits.  Good flavor combo - however, the caramels hardened back up once the cookies cooled so if you're looking to try caramel, you might find softer caramel pieces or another option altogether.  The cookies themselves were perfect, though - I chilled the dough for a few min. before rolling it into balls; also found if I made them too big they just a tad too gooey in the middle - and I love soft, almost gooey cookies! Can't wait to try all the other flavor possibilities ... this is an EXCELLENT, simple cookie recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Easy and delicious!  I used a French Vanilla mix, the kind that has pudding in the mix too, and dipped the dough balls into cinnamon-sugar before baking.  They turned out like snickerdoodles!

Easier than using the mix to bake a cake! I'll admit I've been making these at times for at least 30 years.  They're great to fall back on when you don't really feel like doing a thing, but need a sense of accomplishment or a kid tells you at 9:00pm he needs cookies tomorrow for school.  Just be sure there's someone to share them with in any case because they're high in fat - especially sandwiched with buttercream, as I prefer. Using a standard cake mix and level cookie scoop I get 46 cookies, or 23 sandwich cookies.  They take 8 minutes in my convection oven.   Today I made them with a yellow cake mix and a handful of mini MnM's.  They are delicate and don't ship well, but they do get eaten. Btw, the buttercream icing I made is 3 c powdered sugar, 1/2 cup margarine and 3 T. orange juice.  Food processor for a few seconds.  Laziness knows no bounds.  Enjoy!

Not a big cookie person but this the best.  Read all the reviews before starting and used 1/3 cup oil as suggested, added teaspoon of lemon extract.  Used parchment paper and dropped by teaspoons on paper then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar combo. Brought to church and were gone in a flash.  Will make again and again using different cake mixes as suggested from fellow cooks.

this is a simple cookie recipe if this is what you need! they do taste different. like a cake, moist. i used a yellow cake batter & mixed in white chocolate chips. 
**TIP** for those who find the batter too sticky to ball up or touch, just stick it in the fridge for about 20-30min to solidify. easier & less mess! i also had to leave the cookies for 11-12min.

Thank you for posting!! If you are in a crazy hurry these cookies cant be beat! Mixed them in a bowl by hand , couldn't have been easier! I used a chocolate cake mix, added cocoa (maybe 2-3 tablespoons), increased the oil by a 2-3 tablespoons(because  the added cocoa powder is drying) and added a few tablespoons of vanilla. I know that sounds like a lot of vanilla, but here in Corpus Christi we can buy Mexican vanilla in quart size bottles at low prices so we can just slosh it in at will! Glad I read the other reviews about the size of the dough balls because they came out excellent! Definitely make little (teaspoon size) balls and then roll them in sugar before baking.  The texture was nice, sort of between cake and brownie, moist and chewy.My niece said they reminded her of chocolate muffin tops ( the best part of the muffin!). Will definitely make them again! Gee, can you tell what a hurry I was in? I really didn't even measure, I just  dumped and poured and presto! A big, delicious hit with the gang!

I think cake mix is meant to be cake mix, the cookies are OK but I prefer making them from scratch. I gave the recipe a 3 star rating for how convenient and quick it is to make. Thank you for the recipe anyway.

I had a spice cake mix in the pantry that needed to be used, so I went to AR to search for something quick and easy to make.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I mixed in 1 C of quick oats, and a couple handfuls of Craisens, and baked on Parchment paper for 9 minutes, and they came out perfect, and tasty!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Hannah!!

I love this recipe! The cookies turned out perfectly, however, I wouldn't reccomend using a carrot cake mix.  The carrots did not rehydrate and were hard.

I used a 15.25 oz white cake mix and used melted butter instead of oil. I only used about 1/3 cup butter to compensate for the smaller size mix. I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extracts. Instead of rolling balls (I didn't let the dough chill) I just used a spoon to scoop rounded tablespoons. I dipped the dough in powdered sugar before placing the ball-type shapes on the cookie sheet. I baked them for about 8 minutes and they turned out wonderful! Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. These are going to be dangerous...

These are just sooo easy peasy. I only add as much oil as it takes to bring the dough together. Add any kind of chips, nuts, mallows that you like. Terrific!! Thanks Hannah for sharing.

These are delicious and SO simple! I tried them with spice cake mix and they just taste like gingerbread cookies! I baked for 8 min, took out for a minute or two and put them back in for 2 min and they were nice and soft :)

What an amazing find.! This was beyond easy. I used a Duncan Hines Decadent Carrot Cake mix. I soaked the raisins and carrots as directed on the box but I drained them before adding to the cake mix. I then followed as directed. I made whoopie pies out of the batter. So good. I will make these for years to come! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I would use the recipe on the side of the funfetti cake mix box and only use 1/3 cup of oil  - 1/2 cup is too much. I wouldn't change anything else. Very good and very easy!

SO simple and SO delicous! The combination possibilites are endless.  My personal favorite is Pillsbury Moist Supreme Strawberry Cake Mix with white chocolate chips added to the mixture.  They just melt in your mouth!  I get requests for them all of the time!

So easy!  Spice and carrot cake mixes are good when frosted with cream cheese icing.

I made these cookies for a scouting event. They were a huge hit! I added all sorts of goodies and even subbed applesauce for the oil to cut out some fat. All got rave reviews. 75 cub scouts can't be wrong!

This recipie is unreal... tastes great! I tried this with yellow cake mix, plain, and they tasted like sugar cookies. i varied my baking times and i found a light golden brown makes the best cookie.  I also tried it with a combo of milk and semisweet chocolate morsels... totally amazing.  I also tried it with butterscotch morsels and made them into ice cream sandwiches with 'dulce de leche' ice cream... i almost died and went to heaven...

A little oily and an odd texture.  I think I'll skip the 'shortcut' version of cookies and just make regular cookies.

Super easy to whip together anytime. I made them into thumb print cookies. I rolled them into small balls and then placed an indention in the top of each. Then I topped some with a cherry from cherry preserves and others with red raspberry preserves. Easy to modify these to your liking.

This is a great, versatile recipe and so easy to make.  My aunt makes them using only one egg and a stick of softened butter instead of oil.  I've tried it both ways and can't really tell a difference--depends on which ingredients I have on hand.  My favorite ones are the lemon.  Rather than making them on a cookie sheet, I use a mini muffin pan to make little lemon muffins (warn people that they are not cornbread muffins:)  -- I usually bake about 10 minutes for these.  They're like teeny little cakes.  I have aso lused a carrot cake mix and made sandwich cookies with cream cheese in the middle -- very rich.  Other combinations:  red velvet with white chocolate chips; fudge cake mix with peanut butter chips; butter recipe cake mix with chocolate chips and pecans; strawberry cake mix made into muffins with a dollop of cream cheese frosting on top, garnished with a slice of strawberry (my aunt made these for a pink-themed baby shower).  The possibilites are endless!

These turned out to be very delicious cookies. We're having a barn put up by the neighboring Amish, it's raining, and I thought I'd make them cookies. I had to get my husband to run a big plateful out to them before we devoured them ourselves! I used a lemon cake mix and lowered the oil to 1/3 Cup. I also added 1 T of lemon concentrate but could have added more. I used a teaspoon scoop to 'measure' out the dough. It worked great. I refrigerated it some which made it less sticky. Some I rolled in confectioners sugar, some not. They don't spread much at all. The first batch I put in for 8 minutes and they were way to done. The second and subsequent sheets went in for 6 minutes and 45 seconds. They didn't quite look done when I took them out but after leaving them on the tray til cooled they looked great. Much easier, also, to take off the pan. Will make again for sure!

This is a great recipe!  I made these to give to people at work.  The leftovers were fantastic and everyone loved their cookies.  I made 6 different kinds: Strawberry with milk chocolate chips, Orange Supreme with cinnamon chips, Butter Pecan, French Vanilla, Devil's Food, and Spice.  They all took about 8 minutes to bake.  The Spice cookies took a little longer than the others.  Great recipe!  I will be making these again!

I am so surprised by these! I normally don't care for cake mix cookies, so I was really making them for my daughter (who loved them). I made these with a mixture of oil and butter and added some vanilla extract. Then I rolled them in cinnamon sugar using some very high quality Vietnamese cinnamon from Penzy's (the best!) Made yummy snickerdoodles, a bit sweet though. I think the cinnamon sugar masked some of the cake mix flavor. The texture was soft, moist, and just slightly gooey. 9 minutes was perfect for my oven.

Easy & delicious! I decreased the oil to 1/3 c. as suggested by other reviewers. Group of middle schoolers, "Best cookies EVER!" I made them with a chocolate fudge cake mix & rolled each cookie in powdered sugar before baking. Great recipe to have on hand when you need a quick snack. Thanks :)

My Mom used to make these a lot when I was growing up, except she made them in a pyrex and cut them into bar cookies. She usually added raisins or chocolate chips, and drizzed frosting on top. I did the same, and baked it for 20 minutes. Probably could've gone a few minutes longer. So fast and easy!

Super easy to make and they taste great ... what more could you want. I wanted cookies but didn't want to make them from scratch and take a long time mixing. This was the perfect solution. I only had butter cake mix so that's what I went with. I made some cookies bigger and lighter in color than others. I like my cookies small and more of a caramel color and DD likes them super big and barely golden. A win win for both of us.

for what this is, it's awesome! i used a french vanilla cake mix and added 2 tbsp of home made vanilla extract, and a cup of mini semisweet chocolate chips! super good!! mine didn't flatten out like the ones pictured...stayed more like the shape of the ball i made it  into, but baked all the way through in about 9-10 mins. just waited to see them slightly browning. 
thanks for a great easy last minute recipe!

These were SO easy to make! & it only cost me $.88! already had the oil & eggs, so just went and bought funfetti cake mix.  I baked them 8-9 minutes and they came out perfectly. I did notice that they are much poofier when you take them out of the oven, then they flatten. BUT they are still sooo soft in the middle! Thank you for this recipe! Now I want to try all sorts of things!

These tasted good. I used yellow cake mix. And while I was mixing the ingredients, I noticed it was very, very, oily. And although when it bakes, and we don't really see or taste the oil, it's still there. But that shouldn't be a problem for those who don't care about calories. =) (trust, I didn't care either, though I felt guilty =) Tasted just like the cookies you get at those cookie places in the malls. But I prefer homemade cookies. But these were very addicting.

In case nobody has ever tried it, you can use a brownie batter instead of the cake mix as long as it is a similar sized package. For half of the batter, i rolled the balls in powdered sugar, and the other half added dark chocolate chips. sooo good!!

Wow, who knew that 3 ingredients could be such a success?!?  I made these with a Lemon Cake Mix and turned them into Whoopie Pies with a homemade Cream Cheese Frosting (from Wilton).  My friends were disappointed I didn't make these again instead of a cake recently! YUMMMMMMY!

This is the first time I've ever written a review, for anything, although I read quite a few of them to get additional ideas.  I've made these cookies at least 20 times, for home, for bake sales, for potlucks.  I've been told by young and old that these cookies are great.  I've tried different varieties, added sprinkles, frosted, etc.  After many batches, I have found that a quarter cup of oil works well as long as there is pudding in the cake mix.  They don't spread as much, but they are still very moist.  Recently, I have made balls and then used the bottom of a cup to press them into perfect little circles.  Even if you see a little imprint in the raw dough, this disappears when you bake them.  When you prepare them this way, it ends up looking like sugar cookies.  Overall, these are super easy and super quick.

Very nice and easy recipe for a young baker, my 12 year old is making them and just took her last pan out of the oven, and she is quite proud of herself. She used a devils food mix and chocolate chips. We know they pass the test because my 3 year old keeps coming back for more!

This is so easy and fun. I made these and put popsicle sticks in them to make them look like lollipops. I frosted them and put sprinkles. Everyone loved them and have asked when I am going to make them again.You should deffinetly try these.

Bein a guy cook that has not ventured too much into baking, I made these cookies for a men's Christian retreat.  I added chocolate chips and chopped pecans, baked them for 9 minutes at 350 and they were perfect! My wife the cookie maker really likes them also.  Will make again

This recipe is great.  I used a spice cake mix and rolled the balls in a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking.  They were fantastic!!

Fantastic. This is my new "go to" cookie, when i'm in a pinch.  I used spice cake and they came out perfectly.  I rolled a dozen of them in sugar,which also worked nicely.  Thanks, wish I had known to use cake mix a long time ago!

Perfect and Easy! I used Betty Crocker Supermoist Lemon Cake, the eggs and oil, rolled into balls, rolled in sugar, flattened a bit with a spoon, cooked 7 minutes, and they are perfect. A little brown and crisp , on the edges, chewy in the middle. Just like we like them. The only word of caution for lazy cooks like me: make sure you get any bigger clumps out of the dry mix before you mix in the wet ingredients or the batter will not mix up well.

A friend's daughter gave me the best tip--add a package of Jell-O, any flavor, to the cookies for variety.  I made two batches last night using two different kinds of cake mixes--golden butter yellow and regular white.  To the golden butter yellow, I added regular Jell-O black cherry flavor.  These turned out more flat and crispy.  To the white cake mix, I added store brand sugar free cherry gelatin.  These turned out more cherry-flavored and more cakey.  Depends on your preference, but both were good.  This basic recipe is limited only by your imagination and the number of flavors of cake mix and Jell-O in your grocery store!

These are really easy to throw together in a hurry.  I decreased the oil to 1/3 cup and actually use melted butter in the oils place.  Our favorite is butter pecan cake mix with Heath toffee pieces mixed in.

My 6-year-old daughter is diabetic.  I made this recipe using a low-sugar white cake mix, add half a packet of sugar-free cheesecake flavored pudding mix and rolled in cinnamon.  Delicious!

I made this with duncan hines devil's food cake mix and baked for 6 min... tasted just like brownies warm out of the oven.  yum! also made them with an orange cake mix and that did taste more "cake-mixy" but it was a nice change.

I cannot stress how EASY these are to make!  The dough is so easy to roll into little balls, and it doesn't feel all nasty and stick to your hands!  I will make these over and over - VERY convenient for bake sales!  I used different toppings; chocolate chips, mini-m&ms, cashews, and shredded coconut.  Also EXCELLENT plain.  Make sure you take them out when they start to wrinkle on top, because they won't look brown.  VERY good!

These are probably the best cake mix cookies there are but they aren't really very good.  Although my son (13) and his friends like them - I don't think they are for more discerning taste.  He had fun makeing them and slathering frosting on half of them so they serve a purpose.  They have a VERY processed taste (of course they do there from a box).  One bite left a funky taste in my mouth.

Tried it with red velvet mix... baked them for 7 minutes and they were maybe a little too soft, so I would recommend 8-9 minutes.  Absolutely a wonderful, easy recipe!

Excellent quickie recipe.  I made these for a family member to take to the beach on spring break.  Used a lemon cake mix and sprinkled with powdered sugar immediately after taking out of the oven.  The powdered sugar adhered to the top as they cooled, and made a pretty presentation.  They would be nice for a baby or wedding shower too.  Everyone loved them.

I made these exactly as the recipe states, although I used a devil's food cake mix. I topped them with a little vanilla frosting and some heart shaped sprinkles. They were okay at best. If you use one stick of butter in place of the oil the results are MUCH better.

Okay. So these are the best cookies I've ever made. I don't know if that my regular baking is just that bad, but these were amazing. First, talk about easy!! 3 ingredients?? A perfect recipe if you ask me. Second, the possibilities of what you can do with this is limitless. I made French Vanilla cake and a light layer of vanilla frosting. They were chewy, gooey, just perfect. I've already shared this with my friends and will be making a batch for the office soon!!

very simple recipe to make tasty chewy cookies that taste like vanilla cake (or any other mix that you chose to use) I will try using other flavors of mixes. I substituted butter for oil for half the batch and I liked the texture that came out of them better then with oil . I used a little more then called for

This recipe deserves 5 stars for ease but using a reduced-sugar devil's food cake mix produced a slightly gritty and artificial taste.  I had to add 1/4 cup water to the dough because it was so dry, I suspect these issues were a result of the reduced-sugar cake mix.  I would consider making these with a regular cake mix since they were very chewy (my favorite); however, I think I prefer spending the extra 7 minutes making cookies from scratch but in a time crunch these are a decent alternative.

I just made this with a good quality devil's food mix.  I rolled the chilled dough in powdered sugar and with almost no time invested, I had beautiful "homemade" cookies.  But I have to say, they were pretty, but flavorless.  Completely tasteless.  I tried to salvage the rest of the dough by adding chopped semisweet chocolate (didn't have choc chips).  That made them much better...but without choc chips or an equivalent, these are something I wouldn't do again.  Soooo fast, but if their only flavor is a hint of cake mix...why make them?  Good frosting would help them, too.  One more note: I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil and they were perfectly moist and with a nice texture.

I used Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix.  This way the chips were already in the mix.  I rolled some in sprinkles and others in sugar after scooping with my mini ice cream scoop.  Baked them for about 10 minutes each (I guess they were a little big!).  They were a bit crispy on the outside and fudgy on the inside.  Can't wait to share these with my sons and neighbors for making it through week one of school!  Thanks for the recipe.  Simple, quick and very versatile.

I have been making these for several years.  I recommend using 1 stick of high quality margarine, rather than oil.  I then refrigerate the dough for at least an hour.  It does increase the baking time somewhat, but I believe it keeps the cookies plumper yet chewy. Adding a little bit of flavoring (vanilla, almond, butter--whatever) takes away from the cake mix flavor--especially for the yellow and white mixes. Using oil speads the dough too much and I think it leaves more of a cake mix flavor. I'm a bake from scratch gal, but you can't beat these for quick, easy and versatile.

Very easy to make, bakes quickly and easy to add different things in. We tried plain as is the recipe, with walnuts, walnuts/chocolate chips, and our favorite was plain and just as they were done around the edges, removing then and placing a Hershey kiss in the middle. They did have a metallic taste to them, but it is the same taste as is in boxed cake mix.

I'm not sure what I was expecting to come from a cake mix cookie recipe, but these were not great. Yes, it was quick. Yes, there were only 3 ingredients. But you could taste the chemical-y cake mix too much. I don't like that "zing" you get when you eat boxed mixes. Especially white cake mixes. Won't be making these ever again!

just made these and they are awesome!! made kids just can't have enough it. i made them with devil's food cake mix and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips. the only issue with mine was that i had to bake mine for about 15mins @ 350 and i also reduced the oil to 1/3 cup. i guess my oven heat might have been odd but they turned out fabulous.

Easy and yum, what's not to love?  Made them as the recipe is listed, used the confetti cake so mine came out with with spots.  Yum enough for a quick cookie.  Oh, the time is also oddly vague (hello, 4-10 minutes, why not just say bake 'em 'til they're done... I made BIG cookies [dropped by the tablespoon] and I needed to bake about 11 minutes... try for about 8-10 minutes on this one!)

Very Easy! I used a lemon cake mix and added 1 teaspoon of lemon peel to the mixture. To finish it, I made icing using powdered sugar, dash of lemon juice, and splash of milk (not too runny). Then I added a dab of the icing to the top of each cookie. Pretty and delicious!

I love the simplicity and versatility of this. I found a forgotten strawberry cake mix and this was the perfect solution. The directions are a bit vague, however. Bake for 4-10 minutes? That's a big window! Thanks :)

I used German chocolate cake mix with mine. It was tricky timing them at first, trying to tell when they were done, but after the first batch or two that went in the oven I had it figured out when they "looked" done. I used parchment paper to line my cookie sheets and let them cool a minute before I moved them to a plate. Then I used pecan frosting to sandwich them together, turning them into German chocolate sandwich cookies. OMG, they were SO GOOD! I put them in a Tupperware container and they have stayed soft, perfect and fresh all week. They're almost gone though. I will definitely have to make these again, and experiment with other cake mix and frosting combinations.

so good and so easy. i threw 5 squares of baker's chocolate and about a half a cup of almonds into the food processor and added them to yellow cake mix, along with about 3/4 cup of oatmeal. i accidentally added another egg, and then had to splash a little water in to mix the dry ingredients. these came out AWESOME, and with so little effort. thanks for the great recipe!

*DROOL* Some of the best cookies ever. I made them with devil's food cake mix that I had laying around, and WOW. They came out pretty cake-y at first, which wasn't that amazing, but when they cooled they collapsed into dense fudge-y deliciousness. Before baking I pressed one chocolate chip in the center of the balls. That just made the cookie. I even put a mini marshmallow on some of them. YUM. I'm going to start keeping cake mix on hand just in case I want some quick cookies!!

I always frost these--cream cheese frosting is a good choice.  I also usually make these with the confetti cake mix, and they turn out great.  I've tried using chocolate cake mixes, but they don't taste as good to me as the vanilla/white cake mix, plus it's harder to tell when the cookies are done!  I always keep a few cake mixes and tubs of frosting on hand for those emergencies when I have to take refreshments on short notice.

My husband hated these.  I thought they were ok.  I added mini chocolate chips.  They were way too sweet. I also tried another batch without the chocolate chips and rolled the balls in cinnamon/sugar.  These were a little better.  Just ok

I always pack my sons lunches the night before school and found that I had no treats. I needed something that I could make quickly so I logged onto All Recipes found this recipe. I was worried that they'd be too sweet as some cake mix cookies can be. They were so easy and good, and my teens loved them! I used Duncan Hines white cake mix, added about a half bag of milk chocolate chips, used a 1 TLBS scoop and they baked for appox 12 min. There are so many possiblities with this recipe. You don't even need to be in a time crunch, they're that good.

Used lemon cake mix and drizzled with lemon glaze. They were divine. They had to be baked for just the right amount though so they wouldn't be either too soft or too browned around the edges. And the cake mix didn't bake up that many cookies. But they were very easy and very delicious! I can use the softer cookies to make all sorts of special ice cream sandwiches (lemon cookies with lemon sorbet, spice cookies with ginger ice cream, strawberry cookies with strawberry ice cream, etc.) I love that I can always make cookies without a lot of trouble now. Thanks for the recipe!

These are great!  I added 1 t vanilla and pressed the dough into a pizza pan and baked it.  Sliced it like a pizza also.  My daughter's school sold slices to raise money for drama.  Sold out everytime.

Fabulous cookies just don't get any easier than this recipe. I made two batches: yellow cake mix with chocolate chips and devil's food cake mix with almond extract. I was pretty concerned at first with the yellow mix cookies because the dough was REALLY oily, but they came out great. Yum!

No muss, no fuss! It IS a very sweet cookie, though...(so of course it was a hit with the kids! But I do have to say adults liked them just as much!) Made it for a 4th of July party, and tried it with 2 different cake mixes: devil's food cake mix, and a white cake mix.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts to the devil's food version, and the result was a "brownie-like" cookie (used a 1 1/2" dough scooper and baked for 9 mins. on a Silpat, removing immediately to cool. Yielded 30 - 34 soft, chewy cookies).  For the white cake mix version, I used 3 egg whites instead of the 2 eggs (wanted the cookies to turn out looking white instead of yellow), and next time would use less than 1/2 cup veg oil (1/2 c was too oily); then dipped them in red and blue sugar sprinkles to fit the occasion. These are great, especially if you're short on time (or too lazy to bake from scratch!) I had a batch ready to go into the oven in the time it took to pre-heat it!

My husband and I give this a 7.5-8 out of 10 stars (our own rating system we use).  Nice and easy -- quick way to get something sweet -- especially since I was running out of sugar.  I added vanilla and lemon extract to mine so they had a nice lemony flavor.

I just made these and they taste wonderful. They have a nice flavor and texture; sort of chewy and cakey at the same time. I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Butter Recipe Yellow Cake Mix  (rated as most preferred yellow mix by Cook's Illustrated) and butterscotch chips. Maybe they are a tiny bit oily, but personally I don't mind it. Yum!!

I made this using a spice cake mix and added walnuts and cranberries - excellent taste and so very easy to make.  I like the fact that your imagination is the only limitation when it comes to cake mixes and add-ins.

To me these tasted oily, I thought they were pretty gross, but my husband who is very picky liked them because they were soft.  But they were fast and easy, especially because my grocery has cake mixes on sale for $1 a box, can't beat that with a stick.

This recipe is key!  I used Betty Crocker's carrot cake mix and added butterscotch chips.  They were extremely simple to make and got rave reviews.  I made a few more friends in life as a result of these cookies!

I used Orange flavored cake mix and put in chocolate chips, pecans and coconut - wonderful!  The recipie doesn't say how big to make the balls - the cookies don't spread all that much so it's just your preference.

I just made these....sort of.  I used a spice cake mix, a whole egg, two egg whites and half a cup of applesauce.  Baked for about 8 minutes and they were great!  Next time I'll use chunky applesauce with the spice mix!   Will totally make again.

I also can't believe how simple and easy this little recipe is!  Perfect for when your family craves cookies and you might not have the time!  We added chocolate chips to ours and scooped them onto the cookie sheets with a teaspoon and they released nicely, not sticky at all.  Good recipe for children to learn with.  Thanks for sharing!

Soooo good! I made them vegan by adding some cornstarch instead of eggs, with a little extra water. My husband loves them - he thinks they taste like miniature brownies (I usually use chocolate cake mix). Very, very easy, quick, and delicious!

Shockingly good.  I typically prefer things made from scratch but this is just as good if not better!  I tried yellow butter cake mix with 1 cup candy-coated chocolates.  Yummy!  They don't get as brown as I'm used to, but the simplicity more than makes up for it!

Also good is devils food with peanut butter chips!

I followed the recommendation using oatmeal and vanilla, etc and have tried every cake mix there is.  Tonight it will be carrot cake mix.  I am everyone's favorite person at work.  They haven't found a cookie they don't like!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Awesome!!!

Wonderful. I have been making all variations of cake mixes and extras for a while. The trick is to put them in airtight baggie or Tupperware within 10 minutes after baking. Can also be frozen in freezer bags. I make 200 dozen cookies this way.

This is my favorite recipe EVER!!!
I work with special education and we make this
at school all the time. We usually have these 3 ingredients on-hand.
I also make these at home all the time. 
Not knowing that they were made from cake-mix,
a friend told me they tasted "Gourmet".
The best are white cake mix with vanilla frosting
and chocolate cake mix with chocolate frosting.
Definitely a 5+ + + +

I had to make a hurry-up dessert for a school function, and found this recipe. I used an orange cake mix I had on hand, and piped melted chocolate chips on top. I was done in no time, and apparently everyone liked them, because there were none leftover! The *only* drawback is that one cake mix didn't make many cookies.

I made two batches of these.  One was with a devils food cake mix & the other with a butter pecan cake mix.  The devils food was good, but the butter pecan (a great "dunk-able w/milk, or coffee) was incredible!  They are incredibly easy to mix up (a 5 year old could do it-no problem).  My only complaint is that the baking times were kind of "off".  You kind of have to "babysit" them.  But it's still worth it. :-)

Very good and easy.  Don't overbake!  Best when slightly underdone, when taken from
oven.  Good with other cake mix flavors, my favorite is spice cake!

This recipe also works if you use sugar-free cake mix. Because I'm a diabetic I'm always looking for a good diabetic friendly recipe.  I used a sugar-free yellow cake mix and added a cup of sugar free chocolate chips plus a teaspoon of vanilla. The cookies were wonderful and much better than most of the sugar-free cookies in the grocery stores.

I used a yellow cake mix and rolled them in sugar. I didn't care for them at all, tasted like odd flavored cake. I would just use white cake mix and leave it plain and see how that works, if I made them again. They didn't smell good while they were cooking and have a strange after taste. I will definitely stick to making cookies from scratch. With that being said, the teenagers in my house thought they were ok. I will give 3 stars though, because I didn't use the white mix as instructed (I don't know how that would have helped, but just being fair!)

We love the spice cake mix to make these. So much easier than measuring all those ingredients. A real time saver, and a flavor that you don't always think of. I sprinkle some with powdered sugar, others I drizzle zig-zags of a mixture of powdered sugar, lemon juice, and a little butter. Really like the combination of the spice and lemon.

Really good really easy. I used a yellow cake mix and added some rainbow sprinkles. Used my smallest cookie scoops and they took about 6 mins they do brown quick at the end. I made cookie sandwiches with them. Total keep for something quick and usually have on hand.

I made "Lemonade Cookies" - 1 box lemon cake mix, 1/3 cup oil, 2 eggs, stir with fork and drop by teaspoon onto ungreased cookie sheet. Baked 10 minutes at 350, made about 36 cookies. Spooned 1/3 can of lemon frosting in a zip lock baggie and melted the frosting by placing in a bowl of hot water while the cookies baked. Then snipped a corner of the baggie and drizzled the glaze over each cookie immediately after removing them from the oven. My grandkids LOVE them.

Cake mixes bought with the best of intentions have been sitting in our cabinet for far too long -- and then I ran across this recipe yesterday.  20 minutes later, I had 2 dozen great cookies.  My edges were a little thin and crisp, but that was MY FAULT; I didn't follow the directions and roll the dough into little balls, but just dropped the dough onto the pan.  I will be more diligent next time.  A cookie recipe really can't get any simpler than this and still be any good.  NOTE that most of the reviewers who gave this recipe less than 5 Stars had *changed* the recipe.  My advice is to follow the recipe exactly (2 eggs and 1/2 cup of oil with an 18.25 ounce box of cake mix) without adding, subtracting, or changing anything -- then get creative on the next go-round, if you like.  That way you KNOW if your changes improved on the original or not.  Just for kicks, I made a frosting mix and topped some of the cookies with it.  That was good, too.  I think the real beauty of this recipe is that it is SO simple, yet results in good cookies.  That said, a little imagination (or just checking out what other reviewers added) can give you a wide variety of cookies with just a simple addition or two.  Have fun!

Love these.  Always a good last minute cookie.  Easy to have supplies on hand. I know it takes away from the simplicity, but if you add about 1/2 c flour, 1/4 c brown sugar or so, a good dose of vanilla, about 1/2 tsp of baking soda and a pinch of salt it kills a bit of the cake mix flavor.  Try it...

Super simple! I had a last minute cookie swap to do with twelve of my coworkers. I have a box of triple fudge cake mix in the pantry, half a bag of reeses peanut butter chips and viola! I was utterly shocked! The real trick was to make sure I didn't eat them all on the way to the party ^_^ .

I cooked a few until they were golden which made them a bit more crunchy. A few were cooked just until the edges were golden and that seemed to be everyone's favorite - very cakey but cooked through. Great recipe, super quick, but the batter is thicker than you might be used to.

This would of been good, but it had the cake mix. I don't know about other people but I like to start from scratch with all the recipes I try. So it would be better. This seems really easy too. But I was just saying..

Awesome and so easy! I just made 2 batches to take to my college age sons & I can't keep my husband out of them. I made 1 batch with white cake mix, a touch of almond extract, & chocolate chips and 1 batch with fudge cake mix and walnuts. Wonderful, soft, & chewy.

always look for the easy way out and this is it for cookie making. Easy, delicious, and little to clean up afterward. Will never make cookies any other way.

Tasty and very easy.  I make them with a small cookie scooper, put frosting in the middle and sandwich two together.  Just like moon pies!

Amazing. I used a basic white cake mix and added some decorating sugar, then I turned them into sandwich cookies. They were almost identical to the ones at the mall. :)

I used the spice cake mix from Duncan Hines.  While these are yummy tasting, my dough came out too sticky, so just spooned the cookies rather than make balls out of them.
All in all, cookies came out great.  Slight spreading, but they didn't come out flat, only large and puffy.
Also, sprinkled cinnamon on top before putting in the oven.
One change I'll make next time: add a bit more flour, and possibly some nutmeg/allspice when making the spice cake cookies.

I was expecting these to be better based on reviews. I made exactly as written using a BC white cake mix, but rolled in sugar and cinnamon. I probably won't make them again. They might be better with a frosting or drizzle. Might try with a chocolate cake mix. Otherwise just ok for me.

Used DH Fudge Marble Cake Mix - used exact ingred. as stated in recipe, but at the very end, mixed the extra choc. fudge packet from the cake mix with 1/3 of the yellow mix - just gave it a mild swirl to mix so I got a choc. and yellow swirl mixed cookie. Added two large handfuls of Nestle Milk Choc Chips. Used a melon baller for scooping cookies which gives you a good sized cookie. Baked on a parchment lined cookie sheet at 350 for 17 minutes. Family went crazy for them! Great cookies and really quick and easy!

These are so good and much better than any of the other cake mix cookie recipes!  I make them all of the time because they are so quick and easy and taste great.  I've used chocolate cake mix, carrot cake mix, and rainbow chip cake mix.  So far, the rainbow chip is the best - tastes like a sugar cookie!  Will make next time with lemon cake mix.

I used yellow cake mix, sugar-free applesauce instead of oil and added 1 cup of oats and vanilla. I didn't roll them into balls I just plopped about a teaspoon full onto a lightly greased cookie sheet like you do with drop cookies and cooked them for 8 min.  I thought they were tasty and my 4 children ate them.  They satisfied my sweet craving that I was having and the applesauce and oats help me not feel so guilty for eating lots of them..

Very sweet. I was in the mood for something very sweet but it was almost too sweet. I used white cake, a box of vanilla instant pudding and about 1/3 cup of oatmeal. I also added 1/3 bag mini chocolate chips which added to the too sweet aspect.  Balled them and flattened as you would with a peanutbutter cookie. Stuck a whole walnut on top because I like walnuts but the family doesn't. Very good. Very sweet, I would cut back the chocolate chips or just add nuts next time.

Cookies came out pretty good. Going to decorate them maybe with some icing. SOME TIPS: I refridgerated the cookies for about an hour to keep them from being sticky when rolling them into balls (plus they role much easier). Also be sure to grease the cookie sheet, otherwise the bottoms of your cookies will stick to the sheet, this goes for insulated cookie sheets too (unless you have a high quality dark non-stick cookie sheet). It states to bake 4-10 minutes, that is a BIG variation in time. I baked mine for about 7 minutes with my insulated cookie sheets and 6 minutes with my dark. When the edges of the cookie just start getting a light golden brown - take them out immediately! The recipe does not necessarily make 4 dozen cookies like it says - It made 3 dozen for me. My cookies were fluffier and less flat than the cookies pictured.  They end up tasting really good as long as you like the flavor of cake mix! Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious! If you like Subway's cookies at all then you'll like theses. It was very easy and quick. I used chocolate cake mix with M&Ms and they had a great flavor. They were soft and moist but not so soft that they fell apart when cooked the proper amount of time. My first set (I can only cook one pan at a time) were falling apart a bit but when I cooked the next pan for 10 minutes they were solid enough to not fall apart, with a little bit of crunch on the outside and soft but done on the inside. I did press them down a little bit but not a whole lot. As far as adding needing extra ingredients goes-only if you're playing with making different variations/combinations. I gave this five stars because I didn't think it needed tweeking in order to taste great. I can't wait to try different combinations. Thanks!

I've been making these for many years.  My favorite combos are lemon with lemon glaze. Squeeze juice of one lemon into about 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  Spice oatmeal.  Add 1 cup of quick oats and 1/2 cup of raisins or craisins to spice cake mix. Red velvet with cream cheese frosting. Butter pecan with 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Make Snickerdoodles using a white or yellow mix.  Roll balls in cinnamon sugar before baking. A tsp. of vanilla will improve the taste of most cake mixes whether you are making a cake or cookies.  The sky is the limit with these.

Tried several cake mix cookies and they never came out well. These are perfect! medium scoop - 4 min. rotate and 4 minutes more... perfect! Drizzle with glaze, dust with powdered sugar - or use small scoop and make little sandwich cookies! Doesn't get any easier!

You can't get any easier than this recipe. I used yellow cake mix and the cookies came out great, tasted just like a sugar cookie.  This is a great basic so that you can add anything from extracts to chips and/or nuts.  The best, easiest recipe for cookies I have ever used.  Thank you!!

Acceptable. I went the snickerdoodle route and was disappointed. Chocolate chips might have redeemed these "cookies," but I think next time I'll just take the extra 5-10 minutes to use flour, sugar, etc.

These cookies turn out with a good appearance and texture, but I (and my family) think cake mix cookies have a wierd taste compared to cookies made from scratch.  I would liken it to the difference between homemade strawberry ice cream vs. store-bought, artificially-flavored strawberry ice cream.

So yummy!  I made them and they were as delicious as everyone had said!  I am looking forward to making many more batches and having fun experimenting with different flavors and mixes and decorations!  Make sure you bake them for 8 minutes and let them cool all the way before you remove them from the pan or they will fall apart.  They look so pretty once they have cooled and are still chewy!

Easy and tasty.  However, too much oil in the recipe posted.  Cut the oil back to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup and they come out much better.  Lemon cake mix is my favorite!

These were incredible!! It was super easy and fast! I used chocolate cake mix, rolled into ball and coated with cinnamon sugar. A huge hit with all. I should have read the other reviews about making more than one batch.....they were all gone in minutes!!

Nice easy way to make a delightful cookie! I used a lemon cake mix and added about 4 tbsp of lemon juice from concentrate then rolled them in confectioner's sugar before baking ... delightful!

Tasty and a kid favorite.  I save some of the dough for my daughter's Easy Bake Oven. It worked better than the mixes you can buy for it. She made a perfect little cake in 10 minutes.

I have always loved these cookies because they are easy to make and you can make them your own. I usually make rocky road cookies with this recipe. Take chocolate butter cake mix or devil's food and add marshmallows and pecans. It really helps if you have a silpat to bake on.

my kids and I made these cookies with a butter cake batter. The were quick and easy and turned out great. I added just a bit of powdered suger to the mix. My son wanted to try adding raisins,we folded them into a few and tho the taste combination was a little off for me he loved them and i think the raisins would be nice in a cinnomon based dough.

I'd say these cookies are okay at best. Only in the fact that they are easy to make and kids seem to like them..  Entirely too much oil!  Next time I will put 1/4 cup oil in to see if they turn out better.

Apparently I'm the only one who had never heard of these...  I needed a dessert in a pinch and came across this recipe.  I typically don't keep cake mixes on hand, but someone had given us a couple, and so I made these cookies.  I was pretty unimpressed (you just can't beat homemade), but everyone else loved them and seemed to have grown up on these cookies...  I guess I have my mom to thank for my wholly made-from-scratch roots!  If it was just me, I'd probably give this three stars -- two for taste and one for ease of preparation.  But given the fact that these were well-received, it gets four! :)

Simple and delicious! I recommend looking at the oil amounts on the box. I had one that called for 1/4 C for the cake itself, and that worked fine for the cookies.

This is probably THE most versatile cookie recipe in the world! -not to mention it's SO easy and they taste delish!  I took a suggestion to try Cherry Chip cake mix and add 1 1/2 c. of chocolate chips.  OMG!  We call them "Cherry Cordial Cookies" because they taste EXACTLY like a cherry cordial!  I also figured out that using a tablespoon measuring spoon is the PERFECT amount and that the cookies are done in 6 minutes.  I got 24 cookies out of ONE box of the Cherry Chip mix.  They were so easy, I made Lemon Poppy Seed cookies and used the glaze that came with the mix.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract for an extra pop. Those were awesome with the glaze drizzled over the top!  We called them "Lemon Coolers".  I also had some mix called "Cinnamon Struesel".  It was a gift and I've had it since LAST YEAR.  It just didn't look all that appetizing.  Well, I followed the recipe and added about 1 c. of finely crushed walnuts and mixed it in, then rolled the balls in cinnamon and sugar.  My husband and daughter ate them ALL last night!  Those we're calling "Walnut Crispies" because the sugar gives a little crisp.  **As a tip, let the dough sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes if it's sticky.  It sets up nice and is easier to handle and roll into balls.  Also, you don't have to mush the balls or anything.  They melt down and turn out perfectly on their own!  This is an idiot proof recipe!!!

Very easy and tastes great! I added a tablespoon of real lemon juice to a yellow cake mix. Pay close attention to the cook time, at 10 minutes my middle rack of cookies burned. 7 minutes cook time worked for me.

LOVE IT!!  I made this twice within two days.  The first time I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and added toffee chips.  Very tasty!!  The next day I used a yellow cake mix and added white/milk chocolate swirl chips! WOW those were amazing!! Everyone at work loved them!   This is so simple and so amazing!  I'm going to try a rainbow cake mix next and take them to my young niece and nephews!

These are the BEST! I made yellow cake with chocolate chips and then chocolate cake with peanut butter chips. I used the cake mix with pudding in the mix. Will never again make cookies any other way. So very easy.

My mom used to make these cookies for us when we were kids and I had kind of forgotten about them. When I saw them on this website I thought I would try them with my 2 1/2yr. old.  We used the rainbow chip cake mix and they turned out so yummy. Plus they are so easy to make he was able to help do most of it and was very proud of the cookies he made. A very good recipe to make with kids!

These are tasty cookies and super easy to throw together at a moments notice.  I tried the butter pecan cake mix as another reviewer suggested and threw in 1/2 cup oatmeal to help stiffen the dough and they were delicious.  Watch carefully though since if they start to brown along the edges they may already be overbaked on the bottom.

Very good! I did cut down the oil to 1/3 c. like others had suggested and it turned out great. I am excited to try this recipe with other cake mixes.

Wow! What an easy recipe with great results.  I used a chocolate fudge cake mix I had on hand.  I baked for 8 minutes until they began to appear cracked on top.  They were such nice looking cookies.  Thanks for the fast fix for after school etc....

Easy and wonderful! Made with chocolate and lemon cake mix and also angel food cake (my husband bought it by mistake). I thought the angel food would be a disaster, but it was still pretty good - interesting texture. I did feel like my lemon dough was kind of greasy with 1/2 c of oil, so I put in closer to 1/3 c in the chocolate cookies. The angel food needed the whole 1/2 c. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are awesome!  EASY to make, and not so pricey ingredients!
The batter is fun to play with also.
When the cookies are done baking they have a soft dense cakey center and a crispy cookie edge, you could probaly do anything with them(dip in sprinkles, decorate with icing, or dip in chocolate) and theyd still be amazing.

Really great cookie and so easy. I put 1/3 cup oil, little bit of vanilla flavoring and I flattened with the bottom of a glass which I had dipped in sugar.  Then my boys frosted with vanilla frosting and red and green sugar sprinkles.  Chewy, just the way I like them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful cookies, I have made these twice. When you use a white cake mix, the cookies don't really brown and they took about 15 minutes bake for me.

Easiest and great!! I mixed  some confectionary sugar, butter, milk and lemon extract to make a frosting so that sprinkles would stick and they were a big hit.  I have already made them 4 times :).  They are great quick and easy when the kids bring friends home afterschool....

Woo-hoo!! This is the easiest thing I've EVER made!! I might not ever make cookies any other way again. I used a French Vanilla cake mix and about 3/4 c. choc chips, thus omitting the need to add any extra vanilla. They cooked for about 9 min and came out perfect--not too sweet (which I like for the kids). I can't wait to try different variations. Thank you, thank you!

I made these using a yellow cake mix and in half of them I added chocolate chips. These were so gross. They were almost sickingly sweet. It had a weird artificial taste. 
I will say, however, that if you usea devils food mix, they are great. I've made them with mint chips and regular chocolate chips. Those turn out great. But the yellow ones we threw out.

Can't get much easier than that! I used half a package of cake mix and that made 17 generously sized cookies that took 8 minutes to bake and a few minutes to cool on the cookie sheet.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  These cookies really were great and didn't taste like white cake mix (I hate white cake mix).  I did add 1 teaspoon of Wilton butter flavoring, 1 tablespoon of mexican vanilla, and 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  I baked them for exactly 10 minutes and they are perfect!!!  Moist, fluffy, and delicious.

Easy and very tasty! I added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup. They came out just right, not too greasy and nice and chewy. They baked and were ready after about 7 minutes. Thanks!

These are pretty good. It was my turn to teach our neighborhood preschool, and I couldn't afford to spend any money. We had nothing in the house to use for snack time. I found this recipe and just so happened to have several cake mixes. I made this using Betty Crockers Butter Yellow Cake Mix. I didn't have any eggs, so I shook 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water in a tightly covered container, and substituted that for the eggs. I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, and decreased it to 1/3 cup, and added 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter. I made vanilla buttercream frosting and let the kids frost their own cookies and put sprinkles on them to make kaleidoscope cookies. They are very tasty and chewy. My 4 year old and his preschool class loved them, and so did my toddler and 6 year old. They will be upset when they wake up tomorrow and find out they're gone. But no matter, because there is more cake mix in the pantry! The only reasons I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is 1- there is no way these cook in only 4 minutes. I have a gas oven that typically cooks hotter than most other ovens and my cookies took 8 minutes. 2 - I was using tablespoon sized mounds, not teaspoon sized, and still got 36 cookies. Not a bad thing, but I would recommend not going with the tiny teaspoon size that is called for. And 3 - the original recipe calls for vegetable oil, which is loaded with trans fats. Use a healthier oil, or use applesauce.

Wow!  These were the easiest, tastiest little cookies!  I made a bunch of little ones so my son could take them to Sunday School, and they were such a hit!  I couldn't keep my husband out of the batter though.  I just did yellow cake mix with mini choc chips and they turned out spectacular!!!

Too bad that there isn't more than five stars.  Three ingredients, super quick, and taste great. I made one batch with a chocolate cake mix and one with a white cake mix and added lemon extract.  All gone in a day.  Can't wait to make then again.

These are very tasty and so easy! *Tip for Canadians* I used a 510g box of Betty Crocker Rainbow Bit cake mix, which equals roughly 16.5oz of cake mix (2oz short of what the recipe calls for). This resulted in the cookie dough being too thin (it was more like a thickish cake batter and spread out quite far when baked). Next time I will either try decreasing the egg and oil slightly to compensate for the lesser amount of cake mix or I may add a little flour to thicken the resultant dough.

I made this using vanilla cake mix and choc/caramel swirl chips and they tastes great right out of the oven but after they cooled they got hard and crumbly. Followed advice from other review and put them into a ziplock while a little warm but it didn't help to much. I also tried undercooking them and that helped out a little. Tried these three times and it didn't come out the way I'd have liked. I think I may try one more time and add a little water to them.

This recipe was fabulously easy. I used a white cake mix and a large bar of chocolate with almonds cut up into chunks. I made one batch with really small bite sized cookies for the kids, and another with big cookies for the adults. Both times the cookies rounded out beautifully and were just the right thickness. They are on the sweetside, I think next time I will try it with chocolate cake and white chocolate chips. After I baked the cookies, while they were still slightly warm I put them into a ziplock and they sayed perfectly moist and chewy. Wonderful! Could NOT be easier than this. The cookies LOOK very nice too!

Absolutely wonderful!  I used yellow cake (because that's what I had on hand) and mixed in chopped pecans into the mix.  I placed them in a gallon size storage bag along with a slice of bread to keep them moist.

Perfect.  My family was eating them even before I could get them frosted.  I used "Sugar Cookie Frosting" on them, and made them into pumpkins with mini chocolate chip faces.  They were a big hit!  They taste a lot like the Lofthouse cookies from the store!

Quick and easy and the whole family loves them!  I have tried this recipe with several different kinds of cake mixes and have had great results!  Put these cookies in the cookie jar before they are totally cooled and they'll stay soft.

These are very quick and simple cookies to make when you want homemade cookies in a pinch.  I made this recipe with a milk chocolate cake mix and chocolate chips.  These cookies are best removed from the oven slightly underdone for a softer, chewy texture. Hubby & Kids loved them! Will make them again.

This are EASY and good! At first when letting them cool- they still seemed to be doughy in the middle. After letting them cool overnight they harden but were still very moist. The coloring is different but they are very good and SIMPLE to make. I used yellow cake mix and chocolate chips. Using different varieties could be even better

This is an excellent recipe!  It is EXTREMELY easy.  It is fun to try different mixes like the yellow and any of the chocolates.  They are also easy to decorate with sprinkles (prior to baking).  I always get compliments and requests for this recipe!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe. I make them with my daughter all the time. I would suggest to use only name brand box cakes. We tried a no name brand and they were just not the same.

I made mine with Lemon Cake Mix. I used a large round stone and made 1 big cookie, like a pizza. Once it cooled, I spread cream cheese frosting on it, and then topped it with lemon curd. My family & friends LOVED it! I've already had several requests to make it again.

Quick and easy recipe for a small batch of cookies with limitless possibilities. 
I used rainbow bit cake mix, added some almond extract and topped with sprinkles.   
Made almost 2 dozen small cookies.  Needed 9-10 minutes in the oven and cooled on a rack.

Made with devil's food cake mix and rolled in chopped walnuts. Gave to my son and daughter-in-law to take to work--both had friends wanting more, plus the recipe.  I should've told them it was a secret, complicated family recipe--but I was happy to share this "simple cake mix hack"??

Next time I will make them with softened butter, vanilla, and roll them in some cinnamon sugar mixture.   I may try something besides white cake mix another time as well.

These were super easy and tasty. I cooked them in  a convection oven at 325 for about 12-13 minutes. They were soft and had a nice crunch on the bottom. I used a baking mat and they slipped right off. Easy recipe,  very little cleaning,  delicious - that's a win!

OMG. These are like heaven in your mouth! I used Pilsbury Devils food cake cake mix, and added m&m's. Reduced oil to 1/3 cup like others suggested, and baked for ten minutes, rotating half way through. Delish! I ate 3 before second pan was even done, and I'm not usually a sweets person. 
For me, one batch made 30 cookies. One was a bit larger than the rest tho, so if you made them small, could probably get a few more than that.

Following some of the other suggestions I chose to add 1 cup of oatmeal,  omitted the oil & replaced with 1/2 cup applesauce and added 3 eggs.   I used a devils food cake and added 1/4 cup walnuts & 3/4 cup chocolate chips.

I just made these cookies, and after reading some other reviews I noticed the one problem most people are having is the cookie (when placed in the oven  in a little ball) does not bake enough in the middle. To fix this, I flattened the balls a little before baking, increasing the surface area of the cookies, which should help it bake more evenly on the inside and out :)

These needed less oil than called for, but that may be the type of oil I had on hand, not the fault of the recipe. I used the color-confetti-type cake mix added almond extract and rolled them in sugar before baking, used large balls of dough and they baked up beautifully. So easy.

So I want something  sweet  after  dinner. Remember  see this cake batter cookies recipe.  So all I had on hand was red velvet  cake mix. After reading a lot of the reviews.  This is my version;  one box of Duncan Hines red velvet  cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of oul, 1 cup of sweet cranberries and 1 cup of walnuts crushed. I use a small cookie scooper that made the ball then dip them  in sugar and flat them down with my finger and bake them 10 minute on 375. The came on chewy and soft. Next time I going to cut our the sugar and drizzle a little cream cheese  icing on them

Quick and easy. Let the dough sit for a few minutes as it firms up and is easier to handle. The kids loved these. I used butter cake mix with milk chocolate chips.

AWESOME... EASY, QUICK, & YUMMY!
Great for a quick treat or that late night snack.  Only 3 ingredients -- 4 if you don't check the box size first, LOL.  Then just add 1/4 cup flour and your good to go ;)  Ours cooked in about 7-8 minutes and were cool enough to eat in about 3...a dozen later we was outta milk and grandma's cookie jar got a treat!  (Should we hide it from the kids?  hmmm. Now there's an idea.)

These were great! So simple and so quick, not to mention delicious! I used Funfetti cake mix but only 1/3 cup vegetable oil. I also added standard rainbow sprinkles and also rainbow star-shaped sprinkles. They disappeared very quickly. Will definitely make these again!

definitely need to add flavor, just adding vanilla and rolling in cinnamon and sugar isn't enough, i only used 1/3 cup of oil, this could be an amazing cookie if adding flavor or using another cake mix other than white....good recipe needs tweeking, make sure you don't leave in long bottom will burn fast...cookies will finish cooking on cookie sheet after you take off

You may want to add vanilla,almond or coconut extract (depending on what cake mix you're using)to the batter. That may help if you thought it tasted "strange"! :D

I love this recipe! I am totally going to do this again.  I think that the best way to make them is to use german chocolate cake mix, and make a german chocolate original topping; coconut pecan frosting! I love this recipe so much its insane!

Great recipe and so easy to adapt! I added a package of pistachio pudding and 3/4 teaspoon almond extract. They turned out a pretty shade of green perfect for St. Patty's day! Thanks!

I tried lemon cake mix & rolled tsps of it in raw sugar before baking 7min. My grandaughter loved them! Very easy. Will be trying this again w/other flavors.

These were wonderful. Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned that most cake mixes are 18 oz and DH has a 15 oz mix. The mix I had on hand was a 15oz so I adjusted the oil to about a 1/3 a cup and used 2 eggs. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of almond oil for added flavor ( I used a butter/yellow cake mix). Perfect. I used a cookie scoop and got about 22 delightful cookies. They were really good plain, but I also shook most of them in cinnamon/sugar  and the guys at work all raved about the "snickerdoodles". I can't wait to make them again (w/ an 18oz cake mix this time)!! Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper!

My children and husband love these cake mix cookies. They are very simple to make. I like that I do not have to drag out a dozen ingredients. I saw a few reviews about an odd taste, we have had the same experience on occasion when I use a cheap mix. Overall, they disappear fast whenever they are in the cookie jar.

I used white cake mix with the pudding, I thought they were a little grainy, but the kids and hubs ate them all up and I can't beat the amount of time it took to make them. I gave them a light powder sugar glaze and they tasted pretty close to a sugar cookie with just a bit of a texture difference.

I have used this several times, experimenting with different cake mixes. My favorites have been with Lemon Cake Mix, and Chocolate mix... I added vanilla and white choc chips to the lemon, and choc chips and walnuts to the chocolate cake mix. They are delicious even plain though. It is so very easy, and so scrumptious, and with holidays coming, they are so easy to ad-lib with other ingredients... Try them, you will love them I am sure.

I added a 10 oz. jar of maraschino cherries (drained and squished with fingers),  almond extract (splash), only 1 egg (I like crunchy cookies).  Rolled balls in sugar , put on a baking sheet (with silpat) , smashed down  - excellent!

Good! We had a hankering for some sweets but I didn't have much in the house to bake anything with. I grabbed a box of Red Velvet cake mix that has been sitting around for a while and gave this recipe a spin. They're not my favorite cookies in the world, but I give them five stars for how easy they are.

I made this recipe with lemon cake mix, the zest of one lime, and about a teaspoon of homemade lemon extract. My dad says that I need to make something less tasty to bring to church tomorrow. :) I used a little more than 1/3 cup of oil, and a little less than 1/2 cup.  and I only made two dozen out of one cake mix, adjusting bake time accordingly.  next up, spice cake with cream cheese frosting...or maybe triple fudge with peanut butter chips...or...(there's too many variations to decide now)this recipe is awesome!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I only tried them because I was in a pinch for cookies but was out of butter/margarine.  I made a few changes (added coconut and then rolled the balls in cinnamon and sugar).  I also cooked them for a bit longer (about 12 minutes) but they are DELICIOUS!

I use white cake mix, 2 eggs, and 1 stick of butter melted, mix it all up, roll in little balls, then take a fork and press down making a checkered pattern on each cookie, sprinkle with sugar, then bake as directed. Yum, yum!

OK, this was sooo simple that I thought that these cookies would be just "OK", but I was in a hurry and took a chance. Glad I did! They are awesome.  I actually made 3 different cookies out of one batch, (using chocolate cake mix which was all that I had at the time)  The first pan I added chocolate chips, the second had chocolate chips and then I rolled them in powdered sugar (mmmm) and the last I added some butterscotch chips with the chocolate chips.  I always have cake mixes on hand, this quick delicious recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!

I made this using Butter Pecan cake batter and threw some chopped up pecans in. I coated my hands in powdered sugar because that batter was some kind of sticky lol. I topped it with some melted creme cheese frosted drizzled over top of them lightly. They were awesome!! Thank you soooo much for this recipie!!

for a cake mix recipe these were surprisingly good. I followed the ingredients but added a box of instant pudding to the mixture... first batch I baked I didn't refridgerate the dough. and dipped the cookie balls into raw sugar on one side and faced them up. I didn't pat them down at all. and baked them for about 8 minutes. make sure to check them before taking them out.
This next batch that I refridgerated I pressed a the center and put some strawberry jam in it. I always wanted to make cookies like that... I will be making these again if I'm having another Lazy day, with my modifications

I had a couple of white cake mixes near their best before date, so I decided to try this recipe. I rolled the 1" balls in a cinnamon/sugar mix (1T sugar/1/2 T cinnamon - like snickerdoodles), baked them for 8 min.  I still prefer the real snickerdoodles, but these are an easy, quick, use-up-that-cake-mix alternative.

Just made these and wow are they so good! I made some changes and glad I did. I madet hem with a spice cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/4c of oil, 1 package of vanilla instant pudding, 1/4c of oats and 2tablespoons of waterp...added some white chocolate chips and some butterscotch chips...amazing taste they are a must try and I will make them again for sure! Even with the added ingrediants it only took minutes to whip up a batch. The only thing I would recommend is they cooked a little longer then the recipe suggests, I dropped them by the teaspoon and pattted them down a little and they baked for 15 minutes, not sure if it is my oven or not but just watch them and add minutes if you need to, they still came out with a little crisp but chewy in the middle. ENJOY.

This is the 2nd time I've made these. The first time I was disappointed because they didn't taste like 'cookies'. The 2nd time, I pressed down on them with a spatula and the texture was great! I used yellow cake mix, lots of chocolate chips, some pecan chips.

Perfect! Use chocolate cake mix and then top each cookie with an Andes mint as soon as they come out of the oven. Put them back in for about 10 seconds to melt the mint, then spread it with a knife.  Mmmmmmmmmm.

Just okay.
If you like the taste of cake mix goods, then you'll probably like this recipe because its easy...and tastes like something from the box.
I made two batches, one vanilla and the other chocolate (Devil's Food).

The vanilla cake mix cookies were so much better than the chocolate one.  The chocolate one tasted just like brownies....with a crunchy outside. 

I made these to fundraise for a club, and it is more profitable than goods made from scratch so I recommend to make these to sell but please put more effort into treats you give to friends or family.

the varieties of cookies you can make are endless.  I like to add some flavor of chips with the cookie mix and then bake as directed.  a few of my faves are german chocolate cake mix with butterscotch chips, lemon cake mix with white chocolate chips, spice cake mix with heath beits with chocolate.  Next I'm going to try carrot cake mix with peanut butter chips.

I'm never baking from scratch again---perfect for making with a 2 year old.  Used dark chocolate cake mix.   I think the two of us ate the whole first batch.  Nothing's easier!

One of my student's brought these to our Christmas Concert last year and I fell in love with them. I would recommend a cake mix with pudding in it. My cookies cake out very moist.  It took about 10 minutes per batch for my cookies to bake up enough that I could get them to come off the pan.  If you are having a craving or in a pinch for cookies this is the quickest and easiest way to make some yourself

These are super!  Crunchy on the outside but chewy inside.  Yum!  I used a lemon cake mix & added 1 tbsp lemon juice & 1 cup coconut.  Added a glaze of powdered sugar & lemon juice.  OMG!  WOW!

These come out very soft but rich at the same time.  The flavor is very concentrated.  I tried this with carrot cake mix and it turned out tasting almost like a spice cookie- very good though.  This recipe is perfect for making flat cookies to use for sandwich cookies.  My favorite combination was red velvet cake mix, then I used homemade cream cheese frosting.  MMMM!

Fast and easy! A busy Mom's dream.  I used a devil's food chocolate cake mix and mini resse's pieces. I did cut the oil back to 1/3 cup.  I baked them on a baking stone, using parchment paper at 350 for 8-12 minutes. They were perfect!

The recipe I have calls for a lemon cake and 2 teaspoons lemon juice. I used strawberry cake with lemon the first time and they were SO good. I think you can use any cake and any flavor and they will turn out SUPER yummy.

Easy to make and my kids love them.  I made these into multi-colored cookies like the clown cake by using food coloring gels.  They turned out very cool looking.  My daughter was having a party for her volleyball team, and the girls thought these were "the bomb".

I let my husband choose the cake flavor and he chose strawberry with chocolate chips.  I did everything else as stated.  Cookies came out perfect just really sweet. It would good with milk or coffee.   My cookies usually burn, but I don't really think you can burn these, they are pretty foolproof!

These get a 5 star for over all ease. I don't like to bake and I only do it for my kids. This was a very easy to prepair recipe. The taste, I have to give 4 stars. I used white cake mix and I sprinkled with colored sugar. These tasted EXACTLY like the sugar cookies you would get from the bakery in the grocery store. Since this was so easy, I will be keeping this recipe and trying out different flavors. Thanks!

These are soo yummy! I made about 20 and they're almost all gone. I didn't time them, though. I just left them in there for as long as I thought was necessary. I'll defintiely be buying more cake mix just for these! Delicious.

Love the simpleness of this recipie... I used BC Butter Pecan.  I rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar and then topped them all by pressing a pecan half into the tops!  Yum!    The baking time was interesting... I made 4 dozen cookies and each tray baked for about 10 minutes at 350*.  The longer the dough rested, the poofier my cookies became!  The last batch was very airy.  Maybe I over mixed the batter???

I also used a stick o butter instead of oil,but I didn't see in the reviews about how sticky they were.When I tried to roll them they went all over my hands and wouldn't make the perfect little ball everyone was saying.I ended up putting them in the freezer for awhile and as long as they were pretty cold they did okay.

I just tried my first cookie from this recipe.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I added coconut, white chocolate chips and walnuts and I used French Vanilla cake mix since it was what I had.  I'm not much of a baker but this recipe was obviously so easy and turned out wonderful.  Definitely making these again and I'm sure they will go over great at my husbands work.  Thanks for the AWESOME recipe.

5 stars for cheap and easy!!  I bought a cake mix for 88 cents and frosting for $1.39...what could be cheaper than that!!  Made the mix with the sprinkles in it with the white frosting with sprinkles!!!   They make very pretty cookies too!!  Made with lemon cake mix and icing...very good.  The strawberry was good, however no one else liked them.

This is a great basic recipe. I dipped the baked cookies half way in melted chocolate just to add a little more taste and appeal to them. They came fantastic.

Wow!  Wanting an easy recipe and wow I got it.  I went shopping and found a holiday special on mint/ dark chocolate chips. I needed a way to use them.  I used a devils food cake mix.  These have such a great chocolate flavor.  I can't wait to share!!

Awesome and easy to customize!  I used the holiday colored cake mix, added chopped almonds and coconut, came out colorful and substantial on the cookie tray!

Simple, fast and delicious!  I used Betty Crocker French Vanilla cake mix, and added a tsp of vanilla extract to the recipe. It came out perfect, with a melt-in-your mouth taste!

This is the most versatile, easy to make cookie recipe I've ever seen.  The cookies turn out perfect every time, the combinations are endless, and if people knew how easy they were to make I'd lose all my chef status!  I've used just about every kind of cake mix and every kind of add-in and have never been dissatisfied.

wow im so impressed. i used a yellow cake since its what i had and i only used one egg ( what i had) and added chocolate chips to the batter. im not much of a scratch baker so i buy the break and bake cookies alot. theyre really pricy for half as many and these were just as good. im sold this is how im making cookies from now on. you could totally use a chocolate cake mix to make a chocolatey cookie. id put these on my cookie/candy christmas tray.

5 Stars because it is easy, very good and versatile.  I used: BC Butter Pecan cake mix 1 cup walnuts 2 eggs 2 T oil 1 T vanilla  1/4 cup leftover cinn/brn sugar mixture. Cooked 11 minutes @ 350 on parchment paper and they are a little crispy on the bottom and moist inside.

Wow- I am soo glad I found this recipe.  I needed to bake cookies with my boys and didn't want to have to deal with all the mess and ingredients. Well, this recipe is AWESOME.  All I did was add Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chips because my boys love those and I didn't alter the recipe at all.  This is fast and easy and Delicious!  Thanks your this recipe!

fantastic!  i can make easy snickerdoodles... my family loves them. : )
update 12/09: I used a spice cake mix, added 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper, added some molasses (a Tbsp or more) into the measring cup with the oil, and rolled the cookie dough balls in some sugar. Pressed down with two fingers and baked for 11 minutes.  Delish Gingerbread cookies!

This is one of the best cookie recipes I have used yet! They are so fast and easy to make...which is a bonus when baking with a toddler;-) We made them a little more fun for the kids by using a funfetti cake mix and topping them with cream cheese frosting and rainbow sprinkles. yummmm

When I first read this recipe I thought it was a really interesting idea and one that I really wanted to try.  However, I didn't have any cake mix in the house - I did have an extra box of brownie mix sitting in my cabinet, though. I tried a 19.25 oz box of fudge brownie mix, 3 eggs, 1/3 cup of oil, 1/2 cup of flower, and some M&M's.  The experiment was a success - I baked them at 350 for 10-12 minutes, and they are gooey, and soft and brownie-like but in cookie form! No fighting with cutting brownies from the pan!  :)

SUPER EASY RECIPE!!  I made it using a devil's food cake mix and my sons LOVED them.  I rounded the dough into about 3/4 inch balls and baked for 6 minutes at 350. They turned out perfectly.  Since I always watch for cake mixes to go on sale, this is a MUCH cheaper alternative to store bought cookies!!

I made them using this recipe! I used a Red Velvet Cake mix and white chocolate chocolate chips. After they came out of the oven and cooled, I frosted them with cream cheese icing! DELICIOUS!!! I forgot to mention, I used a half cup of melted butter instead of oil.

This recipe is so simple. I have used various cake mixes, made with many different add-ins such as chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, pecans, etc and they always turn out great. I've also substituted the eggs with Egg Beaters and they still taste wonderful!

Fantastic and SOOO SIMPLE!!  I made Devils Food mix, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and cut the oil down to 1/3 cup and they were even better!  1/2 cup oil was too much for the first batch.  Less oil made them fluffier and better!

I used French Vanilla Cake Mix and the cookies came out soft and kind of crunchy on the sides. They tasted really good! My friends loved them! I'm totally making this again.

This was so easy and delicious!  It was very good with Milk Chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips.  We also did Milk chocolate mix with a Rolo inside (as suggested by someone earlier) and they are soooo good!  (And very easy.)  Milk choc mix with a caramel kiss on top was not as good as the caramel is pretty runny and the chocolate on the outside made the whole thing too sweet.  (I thought I'd never say that!)  It will be fun to try different things - the trick for me was not to overcook them.  (9 minutes at 350 worked well.)

These are amazing!! I used white cake mix, only 1/3 cup of oil, and rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar before I baked them.  A huge hit at my house and a definite repeat!!

This is easy and tastes great. I tried it first with a red velvet cake mix and then with a spice cake mix. I topped them both with cream cheese frosting and they both came out delicious! In fact, my husbands coworker offered to pay me for a batch of the red velvet cookies. The only change to the recipe was that I had to bake them for 10 minutes.

They're all right.  I probably won't make them again.  I used 1/3 c oil as suggested on the Pillsbury box and they were pretty good.  This is the type of cookie that stays soft and its cakelike.  I think I prefer more of a crunch.  Back to scratch for me.  Yes, simple but still doesn't compare.

The first time I tried this, I used yellow cake mix.  The cookies came out okay (they're cookies after all, it takes a lot for a cookie to be bad).  They weren't all that great though.  I decided to give it a try again and used a DH Chocolate cake mix, and used only one egg (to make it more fudgey, less cake-like)...and YUM, they came out great.  I'll have to try some different kinds of cake mix to see which ones are keepers.

I got a similar recipe from my nephew. His recommendation was Devil's food cake mix and add in some chocolate chips. The cookies almost taste like Brownies and they are soooo goood! Great for bake sales because they are so fast and easy. I'm trying a carrot cake with white chocolate chips in a minute. Should be great. I like the butter pecan cake idea. Sounds yummy!

I used a yellow cake mix and added white and dark chocolate chips. The cookies were good, very soft and really sweet. But the dough was really greasy and I found it almost impossible to work with. I put it in the fridge for 20 minutes and it was much easier to shape after that. I noticed after I made them that my cake mix had pudding in the mix so maybe that was what made my dough so unworkable.

It doesn't seem like anyone can mess up this recipe but somehow my "cookie dough" wasn't stiff enough to roll into cookies. I used a Funfetti cake mix and ended up with something thicker than cake batter, but no where near "rollable" in the palms of your hands. I followed this recipe exactly. I'm pretty sure I won't be trying this one again. I ended up just spreading the batter/dough into a pan to make bars and just ended up with dry cake.

I found this recipe at a great time. I had a cookie exchange I needed to bake for at church. When I saw this recipe only had three (common) ingredients, I thought I would try it. I am SO GLAD I did.  Not only is this easy and quick to make, the cookies are delicious.  I selected a devil's food cake mix, and then dusted with powdered sugar. They look and taste better than any store bought cookie I could get. Perfect for kids to help make too.

My husband and I just took a stab at these and we LOVE THEM! We used Strawberry Cake Mix in place of white and didn't need to add any extras. After making the small balls, we rolled them in a light dusting of sugar and baked them for 10 minutes. Surprisingly makes 3 dozen cookies! Will sure be the only way to go for cooking making here!

I made these cookies last night with Devil's Food cake mix and they were sooo good! I will definitely be making these again. I will probably try experimenting with some other flavors and adding things like nuts and chocolate chips.

This recipe came about many years ago, when Funfetti Cake Mix first came out. My kids were little then (They're in their twenties now!!!) and this recipe was a lifesaver-when their friends came to play at our house I was always turning out fresh baked cookies-their Moms never suspected how easy it was!!! I'm happy to see it making the rounds again!

My family said that these were the best cookies I have ever made! I stired in some chopped heath bar (my family's favorite!), chocolate chips, and chopped pecans. They were so easy to make and tasted amazing! I under cooked them slightly, for about 10 minutes, and let them sit so that they stayed soft and chewy in the middle without getting hard. I will definitely make these again!

It is definitely an easy cookie with only 3 ingredients.  I gave it 3 stars because I thought they were greasy, I will use less oil next time.  And I also added some white chocolate chips to spruce it up a bit.

Forgot to bake the cookies for the field trip to the local firehouse until 30 mins before the bus came! This recipe saved the day. Why bother with scratch!? These cookies were really good, and I am not easy to impress. I used a chocolate cake mix and chocolate chips and did just what the recipe said. They were awesome- chewy with a little crispy crust. Baked for 15 mins on stoneware. Yummy flavor. Can't go wrong with chocolate. I sent 2 dozen for the firemen and had to stop myself from eating the rest before the kids got home from school! YUM!

These are very good cookies.  I followed the recipe to a T, just adding some chocolate chips.  Everyone in my house pronounced them wonderful!  I am going to try them again with differing variations of cake mixes and additives!

awesome because theyre super easy-but i found them to be really salty. i used a devil's food cake mix and reese's peanut butter chips. i dunno what it was but it seemed like the chips didn't wanna "stick" in the batter so when i put them down i really had to smush them to form a cookie. they turned out fine though-everyone loved them, i just thought they were SUPER salty and just kind of... "eh". but it could've been the PB chips

These are SO easy and delicious! After theu were done, I iced them and added festive sprinkles...They were cute and tasty!
I mixed them according to the posted recipe, but added some vanilla. I baked them on a stone for about 10 minutes. Although, next time I think I will take them out just a mi ute or two sooner. They were a little too browned on the edges...
Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!  I have made it using lemon cake mix with 1 1/2 cups of white chocolate chips, which my grandpa said were the best cookies he has ever had!  I also recently used cherry chip cake mix with white chocolate chips...these were my fav!  I cannot wait to try more varations of this cookie!

Wow, I never review recipes, but I had to come back and give this one 5 stars. I literally made them and baked them all in under a half hour. I mixed and rolled while my dinner cooked, and then used my already heated oven to bake them. I have 3 different brands of sheet pans, and I get different results each time, except this one, they were a perfect golden brown on the bottom. I pulled them out when the top started to wrinkle and moved them to a rack 3 mins. later. We used a funfetti mix, and my toddler loves them so much she snuck into the kitchen and stole half a dozen off the rack and hid them so she'd have them later, lol. I did think they were too greasy before they cooked, there were oil puddles forming under the cookie, but they are great and easy!

Ive made these before using lemon cake, it is good!  This time I used a chocolate German cake mix. Along with the egg and oil I added about a 1 1/2 TBSP of dark rum. I also had some left over chopped pecan, sugar and cinnamon mixture from another recipe that I rolled the cookies in before baking.  Tey turned out GREAT!

I had to make these like drop cookies and I coulndn't roll them like the recipe called for. I also added some flour because it was just like cake batter, even without the water added.Next time i will add less oil & applesauce. All in all they turned out just fine. I am going to drizzle mine with some melted chocolate. They make a good, soft cookie. Will make them again using different cake mixes and/or different add-ins. They are a good cheap cookie to make for bazaars too.

I love this recipe, although it turns out a little different each time.  I added oatmeal to the recipe this time, but then needed to add water to get the mix moist enough to spoon onto the cookie sheet.  I also added chocolate chips.  My favorite combo was devil's food cake mix, oatmeal and butterscotch chips.  Yummy!

Super easy cookies...great for my kids home ec class. We added mini baking M&M's, pure vanilla and chopped pecans..which made colorful cookies. Can't say they're the best cookies I've eaten, but not bad either. Thanks for sharing!

mmmmm...these were very yummy, easy, and made the house smell great. I did they could use a bit of dressing up so I added about a tsp or two of orange zest, about a half cup of orange juice, one box of vanilla pudding mix, and about a cup of chocolate chips. This definitely gave the cookies a little something extra.

The taste is really good but I wanted the consistency to be more like a cookie than cake.  I bought reduced sugar yellow cake mix that called for the addition of 1 cup of water so it could've been this that changed the texture.  I used one box mix with 1/4 c apple sauce, 1/4 cup oil, 2 eggs, and 3/4 c water.  Added mini choc chips and baked for 10 min.  The cookie is super light, moist, and puffy.  Next time I will try it with butter and a different mix.

these were great and easy to make. I made a bunch of cookies for christmas and though they weren't the best of the bunch, they were up there and by far the easiest to make. To pick them up a bit, before baking, I divided each cookie into two, put a dollop of chocolate frosting between them and sandwiched the two halves together, sealing the sides of the cookie so the chocolate wouldn't escape.  They were a hit.

I had boxes of cake mix leftover from a Christmas project so I thought we would experiment with this recipe. First we used 1 box of cake mix, but it was too runny, so we added another box. 
We used 2 18.5 oz boxes of cake mix 1-yellow 1-white, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup canola oil, 3.9 oz cup of natural applesauce, 2 heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 cup of old fashioned oatmeal (all we had in the house. We baked 1 batch of cookies and decided it needed something so we dumped in a package of milk chocolate chips. My 5 year old LOVES them...  I think they are pretty good too.

Fabulous little cookies you can whip up in 5 minutes!  Mine took the whole ten minutes to bake and were still very soft (how I like them) and I made them pretty small too (size of a chips ahoy cookie).  I used a dark chocolate cake mix and nestle toll house dark chocolate/rasberry swirled chips.  Can't wait to try the lemon ones like somebody else suggested.

Just took the last batch out of the oven.  I used Aldi's choc cake mix, added choc chips (I chopped them in my food processor while still frozen) & chopped walnuts.  I used my small PC scoop, baked exactly 10 min & they turned out perfect.  Can't wait to try different combos!

To my palate, these are too artificial "cake mixey" tasting but when I made them for a school carnival my ten year old declared them "beautiful" and "so delicious"!  I rolled the tops in colored sprinkles before baking.  These couldn't be easier and kids love them.  Will I make them again?  You bet!

Perfect! When I'm feeling lazy and I don't feel like making cookies from scratch, I just use this recipe. It's the perfect quick fix for chocolate chip cookie cravings and it's not too high in cals either so its perfect.

I love this recipe. It is also on the side of the pillsbury funfetti box. I used 1/3 cup of oil as directed by the box, but it still came out great. I left them in for eight minutes and they came out perfect. I roll half of the dough into little balls and the other half I used a fork to criss-cross the top of the cookies. They smell wonderful and taste better!

SO EASY yet SO GOOD! I used yellow cake & 1 cup milk chocolate chips! Don't overbake- just until they are getting crinkly on the top. Wait 2-3 minutes before removing from sheets. I took advice & stored in a ziploc baggie pretty soon after they cooled off a little. Great while warm & great the next day, too!

These were some of the best cookies I've ever tasted. I've been giving this out to everyone!!! It's so easy, and the cookies are so moist and chewy. The best thing is you can use ANY cake mix with this recipe. I used Cherry Chip, and then for an added touch I frosted the cookies with vanilla frosting for an added touch. Though they tasted just as good without the frosting. They were gone within a few hours.

Great recipe! Try using different flavors of cake mixes (Cherry chip, Lemon, Chocolate, Spice) All work great. The next time cake mixes go on sale I will be buying one of every flavor.

These are the best cookies to make with kids.  Super simple and extremely tasty.  With 4 adults and 6 kids in the house, staying fresh just isn't a problem.  Try these using a white cake mix and caramel frosting....yummmy!  They taste like a very soft maple bar!

This recipe is great for anyone who wants that homemade taste, but doesn't have time to bake from scratch. I used a moist yellow cake mix and added pecans and a few drops of vanilla extract. It took a couple of minutes to mix up and pop in the oven! Mine took a good 10 minutes to bake but were very good! I'd like to try chocolate next time, might be good too!

This is an excellent recipe as is with any flavour mix or add a great starting point. I used carrot cake flavour. I'll be adding boiled raisins next time. Mine took about 9-10 minutes.

This was so easy and quick. I used the butter suggestion from other reviewers and they came out much nicer than with oil. Also I had to lower the heat to 325° or they start burning at 10 minutes but are still raw in the middle 325 for 12 to 13 minutes was perfect. I did double chocolate (devil's food with semi sweet chips) and vanilla spice (spice cake with with baking chips) these two are family faves and that butter tip took it to the next level. I make these every year.

Love ease & quickness
Used lemon cake, next time I'll add small amount of chopped ginger
I did add one cup quick oats as suggested by one review. Glad I did. Thanks for thereview with  info. of different ounces of cake mixes. Mine was 15oz. I would not have thought to check that. It needed the quick oats
Cake mix does leave a slightly off taste I will add more flavoring next time

I used moist (store brand) cake mix (I made lemon, cherry, red velvet) and added 2 tablespoons of vanilla pudding (to each mix). Baking time was perfect at 10 minutes. Easy way to make a variety of cookies in short time.

We make these all the time. So easy and taste great! We make double batches and gift these out to friends, now I get asked " When will you make more cookies?" They are a hit! Our favorites are Chocolate fudge cake mix with peanut butter chips, strawberry cake mix with mini semi sweet chocolate chips, daughters absolute favorite is Spice cake mix with pumpkin flavored chips. We will be handing these out as gifts this year.

Great emergency cookies! I made it with carrot cake mix and added raisins and almonds. Everybody liked him but I wasn’t too keen on their cake like the texture. It made 33 cookies and I bake them for nine minutes.

Super yummy! I made strawberry lemonade cookies and I will definitely use this recipe again. I used a strawberry cake mix and then mixed some country time lemonade with sugar and rolled the cookie balls in it before cooking and dusted some extra on after for good measure.

The cookies ended up great! I ended up adding a 1/4 cup of flour. So the cookie dough would be less sticky and form into a large ball. Also so it would be less sweet.
I added mini M&Ms to mine!

Made it with sugar free chocolate mix, added 1/2 c semi sweet choc chips, baked for 9 1/2 mins. Very good recipe, quick & easy.  Not sure why original recipe said 4 - 10 mins to bake, Threw me off...

These are so easy my 5-year-old grandson can make them almost by himself. And the family just loves them! Keep them in an airtight container and they stay so soft!

This turned out wonderfully with multiple cake mixes. I did two six minute oven stints with a 180 turn (we have a gas oven) and they were crispy on the bottom and edges and soft in the middle.

Great taste, a bit sticky to work with, but chilling the dough and using a little flour on your hands make working with the dough loads easier to manage.

Fast & easy cookies
I roll them in powdered sugar for a nice crinkled look. Those were fabulous, so then I used a spice cake mix and rolled them in cinnamon and powdered sugar which also turned out great.

Love to make these. If you use a name brand cake mix I use 1/2 cup oil. The store brand cake mix is a smaller box, only use 1/3 cup oil.  I bake for 11 minutes let sit for a minute on the pan, then move the parchment paper to my counter to cool completely.  I turn them over after a few minutes to cool underneath as they build up some condensation and need to dry before putting in your cookie jar, makes about 2 dz cookies, nice and soft and inexpensice to make!

I used a pumpkin flavored cake mix, but slightly changed the recipe. Since the boxed mix was only 15.25 oz., I added a 1/4 cup of flour and a couple pinches of baking soda to the recipe. I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 2 liberal shakes of pumpkin pie spice as well. Turned out great and is just the right cookie for the fall season.

Love this recipe overall! Although my cookies were pretty raw when I took them out after 10 minutes so I kept them in longer. I used cherry chip cake mix and drizzled a sweet vanilla glaze on top! Very good!

I needed to make a something easy and fast for a bake sale.  I tried this recipe.  I used choc. cake mix. After reading the reviews, I used just under 1/2 cup oil, and added some cocoa powder and some coffee.
I added i cup chocolate chips and my cake mix was 15.65 oz or something like that.
They looked fluffy when I took them out, but as they cooled they flattened almost completely.  They were also very oily and mushy.  Could not use as they were.
I tasted one and it was OK, but the texture was not good.
I am not sure what happened.

I added a packet of jelly crystals, and measured out the dough into 14g balls, then when they were baked I let them cool and sandwiched them with frosting and drizzled with chocolate. Mouth watering and delicious. Have made them twice now, will make them many many times. So easy to remember the recipe

It tastes really good but I recommend putting them in the oven for 5 minute intervals and checking them each time with a cake tester skewer. I used chocolate cake mix and added olive oil instead of  vegetable oil and chocolate chunks and it tasted really good. I would recommend trying this recipe out but like I said, cook it for longer and make sure to flatten them out.

Great for a quick, easy recipe. However, the dough comes out VERY sticky. So I recommend having flour on hand to either dust your hands or scoop with.

Added M&M to the yellow cake mix cookie recipe.  It's easy, quick and though it doesn't make as many as my usual recipe, it's great for surprise guest.  BTW you can add anything like choice of nuts, or candies that can be baked.

Made this without changing or adding ingredients.  These came out fabulous!  Wasn't sure on the cooking time at first, but found that 8 minutes was the perfect cooking time.  This recipe is a keeper :)

I used yellow cake mix, and thwy turned out great! In the past, I've used confetti cake mix which is my favorite.  The confetti one makes a prettier presentation when you need to bring it to a potluck sort of thing, imho.

Someone gave me this recipe 10 years ago but I lost without ever making them. I used a vegan cake mix Duncan Hines, used egg replacer that I had, 1/4 Cup applesauce, 1/4 Cup vegetable oil and in13 minutes I have vegan lemon cookies. It was the only mix I had. I was looking for another cookie to add to my Christmas dessert plate and this solved my problem quick thanks.

Made with cherry, chocolate and white cake mix.  All turn out great every time.  Our neighbor told us that these were the best cookies she'd had in a long time.  Definitely a keeper!

Sooooo good! 

Easy, and only 3 ingredients! 

Added sprinkles (jimmy's) to the mixed dough before baking, and gives it some color!

Baking took a bit longer than anticipated, but depends on your oven. 

Made for Christmas gifts, and my husband wanted to eat them all!

We did like these, but all the cake mixes at my store (all brands) were only 15oz not 18oz.  So I cut the oil down to 1/3 cup.  They weren't oily or greasy or gooey.  Just fine.  I added some fruitcake mix to the Spice Cake mix and got Fruit Cake Christmas cookies.  I'll certainly make them again next year.

I used the smaller cake mix (15 oz.) and I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but I thought these tasted really strange.  I am going to try and eat them, but I might end up throwing them away.

Easy and tasty. 
I did have to bake a little longer though-my cookies came out perfect at 12 minutes.
I used a butter pecan cake mix and added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Next time I would probably add a full cup of pecans.

I made it following the recipe exactly. Except I didn't have the 18 ounce cake mix, I had the more common 15 ounce box.
It did not make the cookies too greasy at all.   I used a chocolate cake mix.
I baked them about 10 minutes… They will still be very soft but will firm up upon cooling. 
I'll be trying this again with different varieties of cake mix, and different mix-ins.

I made this exactly as the recipe states. It leaves a weird taste in the mouth. It is great if you need something ANYTHING sweet like now, but for a repeat dessert I'll pass.

These were surprisingly really good!  I was low on homemade cookie ingredients, and needed something non-store bought for an event for my kids.  I added 3 chocolate chips to the top of each cookie before baking, and voila!  Fast, easy, and good!  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies came out moist and delicious.  I made lemon cookies and added fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Then I did a simple icing (1 cup powdered sugar, 2-3 tablespoons milk, juice from one lemon) and put that on top while they were warm so it soaked down into the cookie.  Magnificent!

I use this recipe every time I need cookies fast! They only take about 15 minutes total. I've done it for years and I have some cool combinations. Cherry cake mix with chocolate chips. Orange cake mix with coconut flakes and white chocolate chips. Strawberry cake mix with white chocolate chips. Chocolate cake mix with Andes Mints and dark chocolate chips. White cake mix with butterscotch chips. Lemon cake mix with while chocolate chips!!

I make these cookies ALL the time.  For a quick snack, it's great!
From start to finish, you have 2 dozen cookies in 20 minutes!  If I have chocolate chips, ground nuts or even some heath bar brickle, I'll add that to the recipe, but most times, it's exactly as stated.

I love this recipe because it's so easy!  I have made it many times in the past but hadn't made them in close to 5 years. Thanks for posting this because  with this being such a long winter, I wanted something simple and quick.  Tonight made these delightful cookies with yellow cake mix. I made small balls of the dough and rolled them in powdered sugar. I baked them in my countertop convection oven, and I wanted a crunchy outside with a tender middle. Baked them for 13 minutes and got exactly what I was wanting.  A great recipe to make with the little ones. Thanks for sharing!

I love these cake mix cookies. Especially when I'm craving cookies and only have cake mix on hand and not a lot of time to spend baking. I bake them for 7-8 minutes, let them sit on the sheet two minutes, cool them fully on a wire rack, and then store them in an zipper baggie or air tight container. If they do get hard, I put a slice of bread in with the cookies and they are soft again in a few hours. I've used chocolate mix rolled in white sugar, which bake up with a pretty, crackled and sparkly top. Also I've used red velvet mix sprinkled with powdered sugar after baking, or with a cream cheese drizzle. Loved those!  I used yellow mix during Christmas and dipped the bottom of a glass with a small star design on it into green and red sugar crystals and flattened the cookies slightly before baking.  They were really pretty and I got compliments from people who tried them.  I will say this...the brand of cake mix you use makes  a HUGE difference because that's really all this recipe is. If you use the cheaper, store brand box of cake mix, you aren't going to get the same results as you would from a box of "high end" mix with pudding or other extras in the mix.  Also, the more flavorful the mix, the more flavorful the cookie.  Just plain white or yellow cake mix cookies don't have the same taste appeal as, say, a red velvet cookie with cream cheese frosting or a dark chocolate cookie with chocolate chips and a white chocolate drizzle. Then again, a plain white cake isn't going

I made these last night using a lemon cake mix. I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup. I also added a bit of lemon extract to boost the lemon flavor. They were delicious! I think this will now be my go-to cookie recipe as there are so many variations you can make.

Easy, delicious, fast, and diverse! Truly the perfect recipe for any last minute event or do the creative type who wants an easy base to work off of. I made these with 3 (could have done more or to taste) candy canes crushed using a hammer and a heavy duty zip lock and about a 4th tsp eggnog concentrate and they were delicious and adorable with the little specks of red. If you don't have eggnog concentrate, you could also substitute regular old eggnog for part of the oil, probably about 4th of a cup. Will definitely make again!

After reading all other reviews, I used 1/4th cup coconut oil, 1 egg,  fresh squeezed lemon juice from one large lemon, lemon zest of two lemons, and yellow cake mix (15 oz). The cookies came out amazing. Light small puff balls which I added a lemon glaze and dusted powdered sugar on top. Out of this world!  The trick is putting the rolled balls on the cookie sheet into the fridge for 10 minutes. This will prevent it from spreading too thin. My next batch I will try cardamom and rose water.

I honestly was a teeny tiny bit skeptical about making cookies out of cake mix; I figured since I had some I'd try it to see how it goes, it went pretty stellar! 

I put in a little bit of vanilla in mine and my family loved them, they were so nice! I'd definitely make them again maybe with different cake mixes to see how they'd go too!

I used a chocolate mix with chocolate chips and coconut. They were soft and moist which I like - not bad. I like to have a buttery taste to my homemade cookies and I didn't get that with this recipe.

I made these cookies using a devil's food cookie mix. I rolled the balls in sugar before baking. The cookies take 10 minutes to bake at 350 degrees.

I thought these were good.  I added vanilla.  I think the flavor was a little bland so I may add mini chocolate chips next time.  It's nice to have a basic recipe from a cake mix so you can add what your personal tastes are.  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you

I have been making these for ages and am finally getting around to posting a review.  I use either chocolate fudge or Devil's Food mix, add 1/3 c cocoa and about a cup of chocolate chips (sometimes closer to 1 and 1/3 cups). I also add  1.5 tsp of vanilla and bake for about 6 or 7 minutes,. Always a huge hit and so easy.

Love how fast it is to make these cookies. This recipe was a little more oily than i expected but when the cookies came out of the oven I saw why they needed  so much; so soft and (excuse me) moist! I added some semi sweet chocolate chips into the mix and combined with milk, this was the perfect craving saver.

This was a really easy, fast, and yummy recipe. The recipe calls for an 18.25 oz cake mix, but I used a 15.25 oz cake mix and it worked fine. I used some store bought vanilla icing to put on them, and they tasted great!

These are soo good! My son doesn't like cookies and he absolutely loved these! I made them with Betty Crocker Rainbow chip cake mix and mmm. They weren't over cooked or anything. I put them in for 12:mins and I'm officially addicted.

I have made this a few times.  I did one with yellow cake and dipped half of the cooled cookie in white chocolate.  I also just made a vanilla cake and put Nutella in the middle of the ball before baking... This was amazing!  I cut the oil to 1/3 c both

These are the  kids' FAVORITE cookies.   I do refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes to prevent the cookies from spreading too thin.  We love using a triple chocolate cake mix and adding chocolate chips.

They are delicious! Although, I failed to find a box big enough. I don't know if there is one bigger than 16.5 oz. So I didn't think about less oil, so I ended up adding flour. I made them from spice cake and sprinkled on some cinnamon and sugar. YUM!

I made this recipe using  a box of Betty Crocker Devil's Food cake, 2 large eggs, and just under a half-cup of oil. I rounded out 13 large balls (I needed larger cookies) and baked in 2 batches for 15 minutes a piece on 350. I used my Pampered Chef pizza stone (as I do for most of my baking needs) and did not preheat the pan. The entire cookie turned out perfectly, with the tops and bottoms evenly cooked. I am using them to make cookie sandwiches (thus why I needed them to be bigger) and I put icing in the middle of two. They look amazing, just like out of a cookbook!

Made these a couple of times now, with coffee and peppermint extracts as well as shopped up candy bars in the batter.  Both times with devils food cake mix and the were as awesome as they were easy.  Actually used them as a cookie swap recipe and they were the favorite cookie there, based on flavor.  Once everyone found out how easy they were to make, they officially voted them best cookie at the swap!

Wow!! so easy and so tasty!!! As per another reviewer, we made it with the butter pecan cake mix and then rolled the balls in a sugar cinnamon mixture before placing on the cookie sheet. They came out delicious!  Tasted just like cinnamon French  toast.

I'm sorry but these were terrible. I followed this to the tee. They were not the consistency of cookie dough at all. They spread way too bad. They taste weird, they were difficult to make and I will never use this method again

I make this all the time! TIPS: you can use other cake mixes and replace with applesauce. I used blue velvet cake mix and added chocolate chips to make Cookie Monster cookies!

so easy to make. I followed this to the letter, plus added sprinkled sugar on top to make sugar cookies. (Stevia sweetener as I am diabetic) wonderful soft cookies! next time I may use a yellow cake mix with chocolate chips. :)

So quick and versatile! I had warm "semi-homemade" cookies in about 15 minutes! I followed what one reviewer suggested and used the box of lemon cake mix that was sitting in my pantry and rolled the dough in sugar. I baked mine for about 8 minutes. They were very good for being so quick and easy! Definitely cured my sugar craving! I cannot wait to try with different cake mixes. You can really get creative with this recipe and play around with ingredients!

Very easy. It seems the older i get the more i want easy recipes. I preferred my cookies baked a little longer. I used yellow cake mix and added peanut butter m & m's. They were pretty good. Not super sweet. Some of the other reviews had delicious sounding combinations. I will try some of them in the future.

Easiest cookie recipe ever.  Our favorite is orange cake mix with lemon frosting.  I pull these out at 9 minutes and let them rest on the cookie sheet for only about 30 seconds to 'de-puff'.  Be sure to let the cookie sheet cool between batches.

I have an Orange cake mix I would like to use but it is 16.25 oz.  Do you think a little flour would help to correct the wet/dry proportions or should I just use a little less liquid?

Wonderful Easy Cookie Recipe !    I substituted Ghee for the vegetable oil to give it a delightfully buttery flavor.   Topped with plain white frosting and sprinkles and made all of my cookie lovers very happy.

I did not care for this recipe. Understandable they taste like a cake from a box. Very processed and bland. Just goes to show, if your going to take the time to bake, do it right and make something good.

I love using cake mix to make cookies, there are so many varieties to choose from and you only need a few ingredients. I use this recipe to make ice cream sandwiches - the cookies on their own are nice and chewy, so they stay nice and soft.

This recipe was delicious! Just tried it and was done with 30minutes?? Used the Duncan Hines 16.5 oz Red Velvet cake box mix. Followed the directions and scooped the batter up with the smaller ice cream scooper and plopped it on a cookie sheet 4×3 for 10minutes each. Took them out, removed the cookies onto a cooling rack and waited 2minutes before biting into one. THEY WERE DELICIOUS. Mine came out like brownie cookies. Crunchier like a cookie on the outside and soft and chewy like a brownie in the middle. I fell in love. My new favorite and easy "go-to" cookie recipe. Just in time for Christmas!??

I had some Key Lime Pillsbury cake mix that was about to expire and didn't want cake. This did the trick. I only used 1 egg, based on another reviewer's recommendation. The cookies baked with just the slightest crunch on the outside and were fluffy and soft in the inside. I ended up baking for about 15 minutes at 350 though.

Super easy and fast!  I added a little something extra by dipping half of each cookie in melted butterscotch or dark chocolate chips.  Remember to add a little vegetable oil or coconut oil to yur melted chocolate to make it softer to bite through once it hardens.  Great idea for a quick bake sale contribution!  Thirty minutes of your time, preparing, baking, cooling, and decorating.

I used Duncan Hines 8.5 ounce yellow cake mix (2 boxes). I followed the directions for measurements but used olive oil and added some chocolate sprinkles I had on hand. I baked for 5 min on top rack. It made 45 small cookies that were nice and moist, not too sweet, and had golden brown bottoms. I will definitely keep this recipe at hand for "cookie emergencies"!

As a constant failurer in cookie-baking, I don't mind to take short cuts at all! People have positive feedback about those cookies as I tried it 3 times in a row. As other people have mentioned, you gotta modify the baking time. I baked about 15 minutes until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown.

Wanted something quick to whip up, heard about cake mix cookies.  I used Confetti Cake mix.  Cookies came out good, the only thing I did different was upped the cooking time by 4 min.  Just keep an eye on them.

I made these with yellow cake mix and added half a bag of heath to the batter. YUM!!! We preferred them on the less cooked side so they were chewy :)

These were great!  I used the confetti cake mix and iced them with colored icing and sprinkles.  Gone in no time.  Going to use 2 boxes of cake mix next time.

What a quick and easy recipe! I make little sandwich cookies with these using frosting and they disappear very quickly. My son and husband demand these weekly.

I tried this recipe with Funfetti cake mix and the cookies were over the top sweet, too sweet for my liking.  Won't make Funfetti cookies again but I  will give it another try using either chocolate mix or lemon mix.

Fantastic cookies! I made these for the first time tonight. I used a yellow cake mix and tossed in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels and about 3/4 cup of pecan pieces. I used a tablespoon to measure the dough, and the cookies took about 14 minutes to bake. The recipe couldn't be easier and the cookies are soft and delicious. It's definitely a keeper!

This was quick and easy and delicious! I didn't have a white cake mix, so I used an orange cake mix. I made a drizzle out of powdered sugar and the juice from half an orange. I also made a drizzle from a couple of squares of dark chocolate. I drizzled the cookies one direction with the orange and the other direction with the chocolate. They were so pretty! And they tasted like a dreamsicle. Yum!

not bad - was looking for something to make with an almost empty pantry.  Added chocolate chips to half the batch - those were pretty good.  I added sprinkles to the other half of the batch and they were so-so... they were also over baked.  It was hard to gauge when they were done.

Used the dark chocolate cake mix with Hershey's special dark syrup, 1/2 bag dark chooolate chips, and the original recipe.  Very moist and tender, did not flatten out much.

These were just okay. I was really bothered by all the oil when I was mixing up these cookies -- it just did not look like the powdery mix and the oil wanted to be one thing. The oil kept seeping out of the dough and I had so much oil left over in the bowl when I was finished. I was just super not impressed. That said, the taste was pretty good and they came together very quickly. I think maybe I would add a bit of applesauce or yoghurt and cut the oil a bit, just to bring these together a bit better. I ended up using these cookies for ice cream sandwiches which were a big hit. Not sure if I'd make the recipe again as-is, but with some adjustments I might try it again someday. :)

Easy, soft, and tasty.  Anything else is superfluous.  I had some Halloween cake mix and needed something for a friend's granddaughters for school.  Two boxes cake mix, 1 cup oil, 6 eggs = 70 cookies.  PERFECT!!

I think it's best to go by the box when it comes to proportions and I'd add cinnamon and some vanilla extract to give it a little more flavour.

Easy!  Made these in the morning, while my youngest was getting ready for school... she was eating them before her bus arrived!  I used the french vanilla cake mix by Betty Crocker, and with that box I was only able to make 1-1/2 dozen cookies.  I used one egg, not two - but you can use two, if you want them more cake-like.  I rolled them in a cinnamon-sugar mixture (very generously), and then flattened them slightly on the parchment covered cookie sheet.  They did not take long to cook, I did not time them, just eye-balled them.  I take them out before they appear done, and are still soft on top... they harden afterwards, if they are hardening when you take out - you are overcooking.

As written in the recipe these are simple, not too sweet cookies... great if adding frosting & sprinkles on top! However you can use any type of cake mix to make any flavor cookies you want! i also tried a batch using triple chocolate fudge flavor cake mix & added 1/4 cup brown sugar, baked 8mins; which came out crunchy on the outside & chewy in the centers. SIMPLE PERFECTION!!

These were extremely simple to make. Prep time was about 5 minutes and bake time was about 10. I used party chip cake mix and canola oil instead of vegetable oil. I think next time I'm going to add white chocolate chips and/or frosting

I tried this as a quick treat the day before school was back in for the fall. One kid loved them and the other hated them so it went over 50/50 I guess. On the plus side it makes for light soft cookies. I added colored sprinkles like in the pic as the cake mix I had was just plain white (as stated in the ingredients). As far as cooking time it took longer than stated .

I absolutely hate making cookies, but this recipe seemed so easy I had to try it.
I took the advice of other reviews that said there was to much oil, so I used 1/4 cup of softened butter and a 1/4 cup of oil. I also added sprinkles to the mix. I made the balls about 1/2 inch round (I spray my hands with cooking spray). I flattened them with a fork dipped in sugar (like you would peanut butter cookies). I baked for about 10 minutes. I then added powdered sugar glaze to the tops (after cooling) and they are really good. Hubby likes them too!

I had an overabundance of cake mix in the house, so I decided to give this a try.  I used a yellow cake mix and cut the oil to 1/3 cup.  I then added aprox 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a mixture of choc chips and candy pieces to finish up some miscellaneious bags in the cupboard.  Turned out great.  This recipe is a great base.  Thanks for sharing!

What really makes this recipe awesome is to add the canned frosting after they are baked.  My favorite is lemon with lemon icing and strawberry is very good as well.  With all the flavors available, the options are almost unlimited!

I was feeling less than ambitious, and unwilling to put forth the effort to follow through with a recipe that requires three or more ingredients. So i found this recipe, thinking that it wouldnt take rocket science to make something tasty to put in my mouth. UNfortunately, the dough turned into a goopy mess. They baked alright, even though it only takes about four minutes if your oven is fueled by hellfire itself. otherwise the cookies take about an eon and a half. And although they now require a fork and knife and the occasional straw to eat, i would say... not bad.

This is such an easy go to recipe for fast cookie making.  I used BC super-moist yellow cake mix, 1 mashed banana, 1 egg about 1T of oil and 2 T orange juice, added 1/2 c chopped walnuts,1/4 c mini chocolate chips, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. banana extract and some cinnamon to the mix.  A nice, but light sort of banana bread type taste.  I didn't use much oil because of the mashed banana.  I used the large side of my melon baller for scooping the dough, did not flatten them, baked them for 9 min.  Yum Yum!

So easy! I used Applesauce instead of Oil or Butter, and I omitted one of the egg yolks (gotta save calories somewhere). I used Pillsbury Funfetti Cake (sprinkles pre-mixed into the dry mix), and it worked PERFECTLY!!!! I baked at a high altitude, and therefore, 9 minutes and 15 seconds was the perfect time. Thank you! I will be making this again and again... SO many options!!!! Carrot cake and cream cheese frosting cookies?! Um... yes, please!

Yummy and easy. I chilled the dough, rolled the balls, made an indent with my thumb and put a small amount of strawberry jam in. My son loves jam and cookies so I put the 2 together :)

I love how easy it was but I wasn't as impressed as most people seem to be with these.  They were ok. Definitely not one of the best I have made. I have tried it three times with three different cake mixes. I used devils food, spice and yellow. The yellow was the best because I pressed the balls flat. It is a good recipe if you are in a pinch and need something quick and easy..

Excellent base recipe. I gathered other comments to help me with my cookies. I made Iced Lemon Cookies. I used a stone in a gas stove at 375 degrees. I preheated the stone. I used Duncan Hines Lemon Cake Box mix. I poured 1/2 cup of oil in measuring cup then I reduced it by 1 tablespoon before I poured the oil in the mix. I used the same tablespoon to scoop up to make my balls. The cookies are oily when you roll them but after it was baked, the cookies were not oily at all. I am glad I reduced the amount of oil.  After the stone was preheated, I put 10 balls on the stone. Then I took the end of a small glass to press down each ball to look like cookies. I baked for 8 minutes. Then I mad my own icing, mixing 1 cup of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. You can add more lemon juice based on your taste buds. Then I spread the icing on top of the warm cookies. I made them for our holiday party and the cookies were an absolute hit. Thanks for the recipe. I needed something quick and easy. That one box made 20 cookies.  I left some at home and my husband said these cookies need to be on the rotation.

I make these almost every night! My kids love to help...even my 12 year old son who currently doesn't like anything! Using different cake mixes makes it seem like different cookies.  They are great plain yet easy to add to if you want them a lil different. My husband even loves them and he isn't much on sweets! Thanks so much!

I love cake mix cookies! They are so quick and easy. Sometimes I use a Brownie mix instead and sandwich the cookies together with vanilla frosting for easy whoopie pies. Yum!

These were great for an evening I didn't want to deal with cookies.  They were quick and easy.  I used a very heavy cookie sheet.  My cookies took 12 minutes.  I chopped some leftover christmas chocolate and milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. Very good.

So easy and delicious!  Best cake mix cookie recipe for me i think it works best with white cake mix.  That and a sugar cookie icing reminds me of the soft frosted cookies in the grocery stores, and my boys love them!

Can't say I'm a huge fan of cake batter/cookies.  First time I made them and they were okay... think I should stick to just making the batter the old-fashion way.  If you want sweet/quick... it's ok.

EASY!!! This is a quick recipe.  We like carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  Used the recipe exactly. Have a Jenn-Air convection oven took 9 mins.  This is definitely a keeper.  I will try a lot of different cake mixes.  This is a great recipe to use if your cake mixes are getting close to the "Best Used by" date.

I just made this for a last minute treat for work tomorrow; also threw in half a bag each of semi-sweet and butterscotch chips.   I liked that it was fast; prep was literally 5 minutes and with baking in batches of 12 the whole thing took less than an hour.  I am pleasantly surprised; they were a little sweeter than I would prefer but I've eaten at least 5 since they came out of the oven so obviously that was not too big of an issue.   I will definitely make again!

So easy and budget friendly.  I used egg whites and cut oil down to 1/4 c.  They didn't spread as much as with the 1/2 c, but were just as good.  If you are cutting the oil best to cook on parchment or a silpat for easy release when done.

These turned out really oily. Rolling them into balls my hands were covered in oil and they seeped out oil on the cookie sheet. They came out a little flatter then the others I looked at in the photos. This does make them a really good cookie to ice. They took me 7minutes in the oven. I will try these again with a little less oil as the flavor of the cake was really tasty.

This was so easy, just what I needed to share with a hungry group of teenagers who showed up at my house unexpectedly. I made with Devil's Food and Yellow. I added chocolate chips and Heath bar to the chocolate cookies. They were a huge hit. I made them about tablespoon sized, and they took longer to cook than I expected--about 12 minutes.

These cookies are so EASY and so YUMMY!!!  I did add chocolate chips which only added to the amazingness :-)  My fiance kept sneaking into the kitchen to grab another!!!  I have only made these once, last night, but, I can not wait to play with variations on cake mixes and add ons.  If you love simple and yummy recipes, these cookies are for you!!!!

This was very easy.  I used chocolate cake mix, added white chocolate chips, rolled in a ball and then in powdered sugar.  I rubbed the tops in the powdered sugar a bit after they cooled as well, just to add to the look and taste.  They looked really nice and were quite moist.

These tasted great right out of the oven, but got very hard as they cooled. I transfered them into an airtight container while they were still a little warm, but they still hardened more than I like. Definitely had to dunk in milk to soften. Yummy, though!

Love this recipe - so easy, all I do is add chocolate chips! Also, definitely don't use Yellow Cake mix or you'll get that "cakey" taste. For more of a sugar cookie effect, use only White Cake Mix

These cookies are just perfect. I think it's great that you can use any cake mix and change it upp!! I used white cake mix and added in a full lemon (zest and juice) and a fair amount of bottled lemon jucie. Also i added a bit of sugar to make them sweeter. My ended up as basically litte cakes...so cute!

I loved them! Looking at other viewers I made some substitutions - Used 2 eggs; 1/2 c. oil; 2 t.vanilla; 1 spicy cake mix; and 1 1/3 c.granola mix. bake 9 mins at 350 oven.  Super great oatmeal tasting cookie! Great for fall weather! Thanks for the recipe!

These are edible, though the flavor leaves something to be desired and they are pretty darn gritty.  That said, watching my seven year old bake cookies "from scratch" without help from mom is just priceless.  This is a great recipe for kids who are just learning to bake.

This is the greates basic cookie recipe out there!!!!!!I just made Dunkin Hines French Vanilla with Chocolate chips.Out of this world.I made them a little larger so I got 18(That was the size I was going for)left them in a few minutes longer and they were perfect! Next is going to be Heath Bar Chips.The only suggestion I have is to make 2 or 3 batches at a time because I have to make more before Bruce gets home.

These are great!  I was looking for a quick fall treat...so...I made these with a Spice Cake mix & rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  When I tasted them I decided to go one step further and make them into 'mini-icecream' sandwiches..however, to cut calories, I used Cool Whip!  Froze them and wrapped them individually!  Yum!

I was skeptical, at first.  I wanted cookies, but was very much lacking in the butter department (the ONLY way to make cookies, IMHO!).  I found this and tentatively tried it with some French Vanilla cake mix.  I also used a previous reviewer's tip of rolling them around in a mix of powdered sugar and cinnamon.  WOW.  Talk about tasty.  Definitely a keeper.

I used chocolate fudge cake mix.  These are good, but not great.  If you want a really quick cookie that tastes alright these are for you. I would rather spend a little more time on something and have it taste better though. If you do make these, bake them for less time.  They will come out so much better.  Mine were perfect at about 5 or 6 min.  Otherwise they turn out kind of crispy and hard. I would try this again with a yellow or white cake mix, I think that those may be tastier than chocolate.

I make these constantly!!!! I use devils food chocolate cake, there are some with pudding in the mix and it makes them even more moist.  Use applesauce instead of oil, and add a whole bag of chocolate chips.  I know it may be an overload, but they are never a disappointment!!!

I have made these cookies several times with a variety of combinations (favorite: snickerdoodles with butter pecan cake mix). My first suggestion is to cut the oil back, or substitute some with applesauce. They are far too oily. This time I had half of a white cake mix that I needed to get rid of, so I was just going to throw some chocolate chips in these cookies and call it good. Then I saw malted milk in my cupboard and got re-inspired. This batch I made with malted milk, vanilla, and cocoa powder and they were delicious. If you like malt, try these.

These are great! I used double chocolate cake mix with about 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of oil. I also added peppermint extract to half the batch. Easy, easy, easy and very tasty. Tender and chewy with just a tad of a crust. I would definitely make these again.

They were sure easy to make! I had a little trouble shaping the dough into balls in the beginning, but I got the hang of it as time passed by. Next time I'll wait a little before handling the dough.  They turn out incredibly soft and are addicting. Beware of what kind of cake mix you use, though!

This was a great base recipe for the cookie I was making.    I used it to make chocolate marshmallow cookies - chocolate cake mix in for the vanilla, cooked in 350 oven for 3-4 minutes, added 1/2 a large marshmallow to the middle of each half-baked cookie and returned them to the oven for 2-4 minutes (cooking time varies with oven and cookie size).  When cookies were done and marshmallows melty, I pulled them out and allowed them to cool, then frosted with chocolate frosting.  :)  YUM!!

Great recipe!! This is the easiest recipe, the only thing I have learned is to let the cookies set after u take them out of the oven so they dont crumble.

Awesome, simple recipe. I've made this several times with different kinds of cake mix and the cookies are always delicious! Try it with a lemon cake mix for spring/summer- it's perfect.

I used lemon cake mix for the cookies and lemon frosting. The cookies were so easy to make and absolutely delicious. The baking time was about 8 minutes.

Great recipe.  This is the same recipe on the Pillsbury box.  I made chocolate cake and walnuts.  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt it was missing something -butter!  I will add butter next time.  Also, I felt the cookie was slightly fluffy, so if you want a thinner type of cookie, flatten before baking.

so easy and yet so good!  I made these using a yellow cake mix and added m&m's.  I did take others advice and decreased the oil to 1/3 cup.  I shaped the cookies by hand into large 6 inch disks and baked for 12 minutes.  Perfect for our bake sale.  Thanks for great idea.

I love this recipe!! I had run out of butter and brown sugar to make my regular cookies. I happened to remember that I had a cake mix on the shelf. Oh did they come out great. One thing I changed was the oil. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (I ran out)which made no difference in how the cookies turned out.

A great cookie to do with kids. I made these with my peanut allergic, 4 1/2 year old grandson using Duncan Hines Devil's Food mix. After a long day and a few hours with a somewhat hyperactive pre-schooler this was the perfect recipe.

Delicious and amazingly versatile.  Also, unlike a lot of other cake mix cookies I've tried, they don't have that distinctive "cake mix" taste that so many have, as well as the dryer texture.  We will definitely make again with the many possible variations!

I decided to make these after reading all the rave reviews and I gotta tell you, you must make these! They´re cheap and done very quickly and they´re delicious! I used betty crocker super moist devils food cake mix and wow! I tried different baking times and in my oven, 4 or 5 mins tops is the key to soft, chewy cookies. I left a batch for 7 or 8 mins and they were crispy, but still good. Fantastic idea, so versatile!

I added trail mix into my yellow cake mix. It is delicious with nuts, raisins & choc m&m's. I also cooked it for 15 minutes. They were too soft if cooked for 10 minutes. These cookies would get 5 stars for me if they didnt come out so flat.

Yummy little cookies that were a snap to make.  I made 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 oatmeal raisin with apple spice and cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top.  I think the 4-10 minute cook-time is a bit off.  It took a good 11 minutes for each batch I made.  Definitely a keeper!!!  Thank you.

Very easy recipe. Works in a pinch especially when I am craving cookies and don't want to work real hard at making them. I use whatever cake mix I have on hand. This time I used a milk chocolate and added some butterscotch chips. The kids loved them.

3 stars for convenience, but I guess I just like a more substantial and "healthy" cookie. Theynwere also salty tasting to me. I will keep looking for a cake mix/cookie recipe.

I was looking for something that would taste like the "Lofthouse Cookies" that you buy at the grocery store (someone said this would work). These were very easy and tasty, but did not taste like the Lofthouse Cookies which are more cakey.  I used 1/3 c Crisco instead of vegetable oil.  I tried mixing everything with a wooden spoon, but it was a lot easier once I threw it all in the mixer.  I was able to get 2 dozen cookies from this recipe.

I've been making cake mix cookies for awhile and they are delicious and easy.  I've used several different kinds of cake mix and found them to be good.  My favorites are funfetti and lemon but I didn't really care for strawberry. You can use only 1/3 cup of oil if you find the cookies or cookie dough to be too greasy.  They will dry out a little faster but otherwise they are just as good and better for you.  Also you can dust powdered sugar over the tops for a nice decorative effect if you like.

I used a cherry chip cake mix for my cookies. Yum!I loved how fast they were to make and my family really enjoyed them. We will have to try different variations now. If you need to make cookies quick, this is the one to use!

This recipe is SO simple and very tasty!  I have used various types of cake mixes and got great results every time.  I always add 2 tsp. vanilla and mix in different types of baking chips and nuts each time!  The only suggestion I have is make sure to keep a close eye on them, as they go from done to overdone very quickly!

Not crazy about these cookies.  I was really disapointed because they got such good reviews.  I used yellow cake mix with mini peanut butter cups, and it just tasted too cake mixy.  Might try again with white cake mix to see if they turn out better.

These are the best cookies to make with young children.  Add food coloring and different mix-ins for fun.

These are pretty good cookies, and exceptionally easy to make.  I used a different flavor of cake mix than the one called for, and it stilled turned out well!

Very good and so easy! Watch them closely as they do burn quickly.  Also, put them on the top rack as opposed to a lower one. Three ingredients? Yummy cookies? Love it!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. These cookies are great and don't taste like they were made from a mix at all. I made it with lemon cake mix and added white chocolate chips. Great recipe! Thanks

Very easy, pretty good.  I used a spice cake mix and they came out nicely.  Great texture, density and shape.  Super when you need easy cookies fast!

It doesn't get any easier than this!  These are always a big hit and I look like a great cook (which I'm NOT!) Keeping them in Tupperware is a must for these, because they DO dry out, like previous members posted.  However, I don't see how anyone can leftovers to 'dry out'.  These are always gone within 24 hours around here!

I had forgotten all about this recipe.  I used to make these when I was in Jr High.  I cringe when I think of all the time I've wasted making cookies from scratch.  This is a great recipe & with just a little imagination and a few extras it creates fantastic cookies.  You'll be the hit of every school holiday party.

These were surprisingly good for how simple the recipe is.  I'm always baking cookies for the kids' events, so now I have a quick and easy recipe to use.  I look forward to altering the recipe in different ways, as previous posts have.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful, easy and deeeelish!  I made these last minute for a dinner party I was hosting and people ate them up!  I decided to make them a little interesting looking by adding a spot of blackberry jam (it added some color too) for half of the batch and the other half I brushed on some glaze once the cookies were baked.  I made the glaze by mixing some powedered sugar with a bit of water.  Thanks Hannah for adding an easy and quick, yet yummy new dessert to my list.

cookies turn out very good! I used a white cake mix that had candy sprinkles. The kids loved them. I frosted with vanilla frosting with sprinkles. Great for when you are in a rush!! Thanks Hannah
