My mother always made thick potato pancakes with leftover mashed potatoes. I still make them--the family loves them! Almost the same proportions of flour and egg, but also add a little milk for softer "dough", chopped onion and parsley, and pan-fry rather than deep fry. Have to try adding corn--sounds like a great variation!

This is such a great idea for leftover potatoes.  I don't have any kids...but I do watch over younger siblings and a niece...they love this stuff.  I made it just because they were really hungry and I didn't have anything for them to eat.  Now they ask my mom to make it for them.  Thanks.

I didn't care for these very much, but I'm giving them 4 stars because my son ate most of them.  I used instant mashed potatoes and added about 1/2 a cup of shredded cheddar cheese like other reviewers.  This made my mixture very sticky and hard to work with, which may have been why the batter tasted so strongly of oil.  It soaked up quite a bit and we couldn't taste much of the potatoes.  I also added some garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper...but couldn't taste it.  Glad I gave this a try, but won't make again.

My husband and I devoured these.  I added twice the salt (1 tsp), black pepper to taste, and about a tabplespoon of minced onion. I pan fried them in a 1/4 inch of oil.  Pan frying is a little more work because I have to keep rotating the puffs to brown them, but I don't have as much oil to clean up. We used Chili Sauce as a dip. These puffs could easily be made into potato pancakes. Yum.

These were good but we thought the flour taste was a bit overwhelming.  I think next time I would cut the flour back to about 1/3 cup.  Also, I cut the salt amt. in half and should have added the entire amt. - they were a little bland.  I added a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese, which was a nice addition. I will make these again but will tweak the recipe a little.

These were excellent! What a unique use of left over mashed potatoes. I added some grated cheddar cheese for added substance. Great for kids! Thanks.

I remember begging my mother to make extra mashed potatoes so we could have her potato puffs the next night.  As a child I helped mom make them.  My mother handed down her recipe to me.  I lost it and couldn't remember the exact measurements.  This recipe jarred my memory.  The only difference is that I use less salt.  Also as others said you can add diced onion, and/or bacon, etc. to add different dimensions.  I use a small cookie scoop to make hush puppy size puffs.  If you make them too big they won't get done inside or else you'll have to fry them way to brown.  Other than the salt this recipe is the one!  Thanks for posting this. Also, some reviewers mentioned the "dough" to be too runny or too thick. The viscosity of the raw product will depend on how thick you originally made your mashed potatoes.

This is so good (my wife wanted them again). I also added cheese, onion, bacon,and garlic as others have suggested. My potatoes were a bit dry, so I also added another egg. Having no children to worry about I added Worcestershire sauce, mustard and a dash of red pepper flakes.     Fried in a bit of oil, these came out crispy and tasty, no need for a dip.

These were a HUGE hit with my kids especially my extra finicky 2 yr old. I have had potato cakes before but these were the perfect size for little fingers. I added grated onion, minced garlic and 1/2 cup shredded cheese. They were grabbing them before they were cooled off! thanks for sharing

These are pretty good! I am against using too much oil in my cooking, so I had to bake my puffs after frying them to a slight golden crisp. Either way they turned out really delicious!

We enjoyed these a lot.  Took advice from others and cut the flour in half.  Added cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Great!

I had a left over roast chicken with potatoes. Made sandwiches out of the chicken and didn't want to throw the potatoes away. So I threw them in the food processor and followed the instructions. A great success, even if a little greasy amd fattening.

These are the best way to use leftover mashed potatoes!  The whole family loves them, and guests are always impressed.  Using a small cookie scoop, such as the ones from Pampered Chef, makes for a neater presentation.  They also reheat well in the oven, just like baking store-bought tater-tots.  Yum.  Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe.

I used garlic-seasoned left over mashed potatoes which were very flavorful.  After I added the flour (half the recommended amt), eggs, and baking powder, the potatoes lost a lot of the flavor though.  I even added mozzerella cheese, but it was still on the bland side.  I recommend adding quite a bit more seasonings than you normally would.  Deep frying also made them heavier (greasier) than they needed to be.  Next time I'll try pan frying them like others suggested.

I've made these twice... The first time, I did a double-batch but only used one egg. I have to agree, you do really taste the flour when you use the full amount called for. The second time, I only used about half the flour and it was MUCH better. I added pepper and seasoning salt both times, a Mexican cheese blend the first time and cheddar the second, and I added some imitation bacon bits in the second batch. I deep-fried the first batch up as instructed, but the second time I just made potato pancakes and pan-fried them. Yum! Good with butter (and the deep-fried ones were great with syrup!). Next time, maybe I'll add some onions or maybe different cheese... Thanks, Patti, these were fun!

I like to try recipes as they are written. This recipe brought back memories of what my mom use to make called, dofinkles , which kind of tastes like a potato donut hole. ( Back then they were somewhat bland, and we would dip them in pancake syrup or sour cream or sprinkled powdered sugar.) Today my two children and I made the potato puffs and they tasted as bland as they did 30 some years ago. I got such a good laugh, because I knew what to do, get out the pancake syrup, sour cream and powdered sugar and let the children decide on their own topping.  We had alot of fun this rainy day, and the children enjoyed these as snacks. Family rating, 5 for fun, 4 for toppings 3 for potato puffs. Nice Memory.  Thank You

These were surprisingly delicious!!!  I had company coming for a BBQ and was making potato salad, but I accidentally over cooked the potatoes and ended up with mashed potatoes.  I found this recipe and added some fresh thinly slices green onion and cheddar cheese like some other reviews suggested.  I made them more like a fluffy pancake then a ball, I felt they cooked better that way.  I ended up serving them along side some sour cream as appetizers.  They were a HUGE hit and I was thrilled to used up the mashed potatoes!  Will be using this recipe again in the near future, on purpose or accidentally!!

The batter did not form into a ball and was slightly runny. The flavor, however, was delicious.

I first had these out so I was happy to see this recipe posted here. Also, thank you to previous reviewers for their helpful hints. I thought that these were great. I have never met a potato that I didn't like yet. Carbaholic here. Anything wrong with this recipe was my fault though, as I am not much of a fryer. Thanks for the post.

Even though I added a lot of seasonings, I'm still rating this a five based on creativity. I used my favorite brand of instant mashed potatoes and quadrupled the recipe because both of my daughters boyfriends were here (and you know how they can eat). I only used two eggs and didn't measure the flour; just put in what looked about right. I added bacon and parm to the mix and yes, the "dough" was sticky, however, I floured my hands very well to help with the rolling. My buddy Josie tried this recipe and found the potatoes to be too greasy, but I think, honey bun that maybe your oil wasn't hot enough. I always use a candy thermometer to make sure the temp is at 350 degrees. Patti, I certainly made a lot of these babies and I'm happy to say, that most were devoured!! I can see myself making these as an appetizer using cheddar and jalapeno peppers. YUMMO and thanks so much!!

WOW! They were so good. I had 4 of them. I added cheese onions and bacon. I added a little sour cream on one. I prefer it without the sour cream. Next time I will add more onions.

I finally found the recipe i was looking for.  My dad would make these for us when we were kids.  although my dad had put in seasoning to improve the flavour.

I changed a little bit for my taste I dipped potato squares or cubes into the batter and in the better I added milk paprika cumin and garlic powder. Everyone liked them but got tired of them quickly

These were pretty good.  Definitely add the cheese and maybe scallions for flavor.  I also added black pepper, increased the salt and served with sour cream.  They actually tasted better the next day, as most dishes do.

I had a recipe similar to this in my recipe box, but didn't have the measurements.  This is so good, I am making them for the first time right now, couldn't wait to try them.  Delicious!  I did add some minced onion, but that was the only change.  Thank you for a very simple, great recipe.

I found these tasted too floury, but other than that were an interesting alternative to our usual potato side dishes.  I think next time I'll use less flour, add some corn, green chiles, and cheese, and perhaps pan fry rather than deep fry to cut down on the fat.

I liked the flavor, but the potato mixture was so runny.  It cooked up really unattractive, so nobody would even try them.  I may tweak the recipe and try again.

These turned out good and the grandkids loved them.  Nice to have something a little different.
