My husband and I LOVED these!  Used Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from AR for the BBQ sauce.

Grilled peaches make for a wonderful side dish or dessert!  It's so simple and so easy yet the results are delicious.  This definitely needs a bbq sauce with a spicy kick to compliment the peaches for a nice combination of sweet and heat!

What a great idea and it is so easy. My concern was that our Colorado western slope peaches are a month away so I grabbed some imports at Wallmart. Not the home grown quality so I did add a little brown sugar to help the peaches out. Another winner Chef John--thanks. We will be making these again when our home grown season arrives.

I love grilled peaches and these were great.  Next time try Texas Pete's Buffalo Wing Sauce, they are to die for!

I tried them with store-bought white peaches, topped with Maya Kaimal Spicy Ketchup. Don't be fooled by the name-it's really like spicy BBQ sauce with an Indian flare. I've tried curried peaches before but this was far superior! The peaches could have had more flavor and sweetness, but that's no fault of the recipe. I have a few halves left over that I'm going to try with ice cream. I think I'll also try it again when peaches are in season here.

These were wonderful!  I wasn't sure how these would taste, but I was very curious.  I though the BBQ sauce would be overpowering, but I was so WRONG!  I used Stubbs Spicy BBQ sauce and once these were grilled, I could not tell that they were slathered in BBQ sauce at all.  But the peach flavor was amazing and the peaches had a hint of spice to them.  We will definitely be grilling these again this summer.

BBQ sauce too strong and masks the the sweet flavor for peaches.  I love them BBQ'd, but just rubbed on the cut side with a bit of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  They brown quickly before they get too soft, then onto some vanilla bean ice cream! Divine!!

I did not like this at all. The combo of the peaches and BBQ sauce was not pleasant.
I think that a simple grill on the peaches and maybe a little honey and brown sugar would have been much more appealing.

I love the grilling part, but adding BBQ sauce was not at all my favorite.  I think it'd be good just grilled and served over ice cream!

Found this recipe this morning, decided to make it for a family get together tonight.  I definitely got some raised eyebrows when I said I was making barbecued peaches.
Everybody loved them!  Including my 3 year old and finicky 10 year old.  I did run out at the last minute to pick up vanilla ice cream, definitely puts it over the top. :)  This is a keeper.

We tried it last night and thought it was absolutely wonderful and was easy to make too.  Can't wait to try them again as soon as I get more peaches.  Linda from Manchester, TN

Loved the warm peach...but I don't think my favorite BBQ sauce was a good addition to it.  Next time I'm just going to sprinkle the peach with sugar and cinnamon!  Skip the BBQ sauce!

4 new fans of this recipe!  Paired well with our BBQ chicken--the homemade sauce I used definitely had a spicy kick.  The peaches weren't even quite ripe due to last minute shopping, but they were still wonderful.
