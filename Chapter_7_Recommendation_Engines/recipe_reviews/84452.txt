We tried these because my fella is working on a project about the Ukraine, and I'm glad we did!  Super-yummy and super-easy.  I used turkey kielbasa, sliced lengthwise and browned in a pan, and we skipped the hard-boiled eggs (mostly because I forgot about them).  We did this twice, once with cold (but browned) kielbasa and once with the sausage right out of the pan; I'd recommend using it cold, otherwise it melts the cream cheese mixture and you end up with an incredibly messy sandwich.  We loved the cream cheese mixture, although I think next time I might just mix the garlic with cream cheese, and see if it's as good without the extra fat from the butter.  All in all - great combination!  Thanks!  EDIT:  Made again, skipping the butter but including the hard-boiled eggs.  I think skipping the butter did make the garlic spread slightly less awesome - it doesn't spread as smoothly, and obviously tastes more strongly of cream cheese - but it's still pretty darn good.  If you're not totally averse to eggs, definitely take the time to do those.  Adds a nice creaminess to the sandwich.

I found this recipe to be quite good, but there are a few things I would recommend when making them next time.  Use a ciabatta loaf or slice larger pieces of french bread.  Be sure to slice the tomato, sausage, cucumber very thinly otherwise you'll  have problems getting it all in your mouth!  Also, I think I would like to use more garlic (I love the flavor of garlic) and let it sit in the cream cheese/butter mixture for an hour or two so they take on more of the garlic flavor.  This is a great sandwich though and I loved how unique it was!

I grew up on these.  Although we made ours with rye bread and thin sliced ham. Also adding a dash of paprika to the cream cheese butter mixture adds some color.

I'm from Ukraine and I make the cream differently. Mayo instead of butter. Also the shredd the egg so there's no chunks.  You can also sprinkle with Mexican blend cheese instead of egg.

Mmm. This is very good! I used kielbasa sausage and followed the recipe exactly except slightly toasted the bread. It was nice and fresh tasting. Good for a nice warm day.

I love these sandwiches! I served them on sliced ciabatta instead of french bread... I thought slices of french bread would be too small to hold all the toppings so I chose the ciabatta since it was a little bit of a bigger loaf.  Also, I used kielbasa which is a Ukrainian/Polish sausage and I highly recommend it. 
these are SO european, I love them.

I made these to go with soup and the family loved them.  I did add a little more garlic because we are big garlic fans.

These were excellent. My family loved them and they were gone in one day. They are really easy to make and are delicious.

These were tasty - I used the suggestion from others to toast the bread and brown my meat (used smoked turkey sausage) and let cool before spreading the cheese mixture.  Next time I will halve the butter and add the egg - didn't have any on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding recipe! Super delicious! I used deli roast beef in place of sausage and sliced the hard-boiled egg instead of chopping it to keep it from falling off the sandwich.

This was good...but not great.  It tasted like your basic sandwich.  I was disapointed as I had expected so much more.  The only change I made was to serve it on sandwich bread and not french bread.

This recipe is amazing. I first tried them when looking up Ukranian recipes for an exchange student we had visiting, I was trying to make her feel more at home. She and the whole family enjoyed them and I have since taken them to many different potluck's. I always use kielbasa of some sort and omit the tomatoes and eggs, which I don't think are necessary if you are in a hurry. To make as more of an appetizer instead of a meal get a thinner loaf of crusty french bread and layer with cheese-butter mixture and only 1 slice each of kielbasa and cucumber. Also, I double the cream cheese butter mixture sometimes and use it as a spread for hot bread out of the oven for dinner the following nights. My family and friends LOVE it.

So good and easy!  My husband I just recently moved to Ukraine and found this recipe as I was looking for Ukrainian recipes.  I couldn't find cream cheese in the market (kind of hard when you don't speak the language), but used some kind of cheese spread that worked wonderfully. For the meat, i used salami.  I also added fresh dill to the spread which added extra flavor. Delicious!

This is a little fattening, but worth it. I feed it to my husband for a quick luch. I buy breakfast sausage and freeze in small portions. My husband raves about this sandwich.
