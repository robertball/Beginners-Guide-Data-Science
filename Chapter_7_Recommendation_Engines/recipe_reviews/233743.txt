I have made this salad about 10 times now for various people, and they all love it - even my picky teenagers! The only change I make is to use dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard because I think it tastes much better. Also, as someone else said here, only half the recommended dressing is needed. This salad has become a staple of our diet.

Pretty good. Great toppings of almonds, bacon, and avo. Made exactly as written but next time I will replace the maple syrup with honey and use a balsamic vinegar.  The maple was a bit overpowering for me. Also needs another softer green like spinach or baby romaine.  Since I knew kale was going to be much firmer, I added the dressing early -- about 20 minutes before serving to make sure it added a lot of flavor.  Definite potential here

This is a great simple salad! Omitted the avocado (didn't have one), but added about 1/4 shredded aged white cheddar. Tossed with half the dressing and that was plenty. Will definitely make this again.

This is the BEST kale salad I've yet to make; simply delicious.  Couple of things:
   1.  I use only 1/2 the amount of salad dressing called for, and omit salt (see 2. below).     

    2.  Prior to adding other ingredients, use salt called for in the dressing on the kale, then massage the Kale for 1-2 minutes to tenderize.   (This makes a HUGE difference in tenderizing the Kale).

Would make kale slices even smaller and marinate in the lemon for at least an hour beforehand so the citrus can break down the kale better. Cut the dressing in half and still had leftover, the 1/2 cup of oil just didn't seem right for 6 cups of greens. Also only used one large apple and cut into smaller bite sized pieces but threw in the whole avocado - as everyone knows they don't keep well once cut open. Substituted smoked salmon for the bacon which was great and used Dijon mustard, loved dressing the flavor.

We have gobs of kale in our garden, and this is my absolute favorite, go-to salad. I can eat it all summer long and never grow tired of it. It’s always a hit when I take it to gatherings.

Absolute best salad ever just as it is.  However, I often don't have avocado's so I omit them sometimes and have often times used Swiss Chard instead of Kale.  I think it is mainly the dressing and you could add whatever else you wanted for the salad part except of course you would have to keep the lovely smoked bacon in it.  I also agree with others on probably not using all the salad dressing.  I just mix up a double batch and use what I want and keep it in the frig for the next time.  Set it out a little before supper so the olive oil melts and it is ready to go.

This was yummy!  I find raw kale to be a bit coarse, so I used finely shredded baby kale and tossed it with the dressing about an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Did not use the maple syrup because I did not have any. I used brown sugar instead.  But it was a hit nonetheless! Will make it repeatedly in future.

I loved this and made a few changes the second time around. Reserved a tablespoon of the bacon fat and sautéed the kale until it was bright green and slightly wilted. I also toasted the almonds and in lieu of the avocado I added one cup of cooked quinoa to bump up the protein. It's a meal! Thanks for sharing!

We love this recipe! Very flavorful - a hit at picnics and now a dinner staple to use up all the kale we have in the garden. We dress the kale a while before adding the other ingredients (at least an hour beforehand) to soften the kale -- works great!

I made this for my family, all guys, and they loved it. I made it more Manly by doubling the bacon! Less healthy but really good. I used honey mustard because I was out of regular mustard and used pink lady apples. We had honey dark wheat rolls with it as well. The salad is one of the prettiest salads I have seen, restaurant quality!

I loved this recipe! But I made a few changes. I used shrimp instead of bacon, white vinegar, and yellow mustard. I also omitted the apples. Besides that, it was quick and easy! The dressing was delicious!

Do yourself a favour and add goat cheese to this. It's a nice and tasty hearty salad. My favourite way to eat kale.

Made as written w/ julienned baby kale and diced smoked ham instead of bacon, and added seedless red grapes because I had them. I saved half of the dressing for another day so as not to drown the greens and fruits. Sublime!

I made this salad per the directions except I added an entire avocado and I massaged the kale in the dressing before adding the other ingredients. It is delicious! I will definitely make again, but next time I will add a lot more kale (3 more cups?), smaller pieces of, and perhaps less, apple.

Per the other suggestions, I made this with honey instead of the maple syrup and let it sit in the dressing for a bit before serving. Huge hit at the party! Great recipe!

I know this is definitely healthy but I need something to soften the stiffness (lack of a better word) of the kale.  Most kale salads that appeal to me are drizzled with a hot oil to wilt the kale slightly and then sprinkled with a light dusting of finely shredded cheese.

My husband and I were invited to another couples place for dinner and when I asked her what I could bring, she said salad.  I didn't want to bring just a plain old garden salad so I went on the search for something a little fancier.  Along came this recipe to my inbox like an food angel!  This was actually my first time using kale so I was a a little nervous as I had heard talk about bitterness and such.  I doubled the recipe and did pretty much exactly what it read.  
The salad was a huge hit with our friends as well as my husband!  I enjoyed it as well but found that I may have used a bit too much of the apple cider vinegar as I found it a little overpowering but no one else seemed to feel that way.  Will definetly make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Didn't use the exact dressing recipe because I already had one made that was similar. We're new to kale but finding it to be quite tasty and versatile.
