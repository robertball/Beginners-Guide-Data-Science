I am rating this recipe as a great idea because I did not even try to make it as is.  The marinara/pizza sauce did not sound appealing--too much like pizza.  So I baked the pitas (with olive oil, italian seasoning and parm on them), covered them in some pesto and black olives, melted italian cheese on top, sprinkled with more parm and thoroughly enjoyed!  I would rate that 5 stars!

Well, I guess I'm the voice of dissent. I didn't think there was enough sauce for these. I considered thinning it with a little water, but I guess I would just double it next time. And I think I would maybe stir the basil into the sauce at the last minute, as large chunks of fresh basil are pretty overwhelming. AND, I would put the cheese on and then stick them back in the oven to melt it. I put the cheese on within 10 seconds, and it still wouldn't melt. I know I could have made these adjustments along the way, but I always try to make a new recipe exactly as written the first time. This could be a lot better without adding much fat.

This was so yummy and so easy to make!  We don't like olives so I substituted sliced mushrooms.  It's also a good substitute for pizza and fun to eat.

These were pretty good. I really didn't like the flavor of the basil with the black olives but I added mushrooms and that was really good. So next time I'll double the cheese and mushrooms and leave off the basil and black olives.

I finally got around to making this for a small group and they were gone in seconds. A few suggested changes.  I mixed cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  On the pitas before baking, in addition to the Parmesan, I sprinkled on some Italian Seasoning and drizzled olive oil over them.    One interesting comment of note from my guests - "The basil makes this recipe!"  Oh and one other thing - I used Pizza Sauce instead of Marinara sauce and mixed a little parmesan into the sauce.

This was alright. I ended up using a lot more sauce than called for. I probably won't make this again, but it was fun to try something different.

Husband came home from work at lunchtime expectedly, so I threw this together. We actually really enjoyed it. I used a lot more pasta sauce - about half a jar - more cheese too, and I also added some diced onion to the sauce. This would be good with different combinations of pizza toppings. Thanks!
