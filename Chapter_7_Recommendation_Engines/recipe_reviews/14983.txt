Amazing taste, and amazingly easy to make. If this were from a restaurant, I'd pay a reasonable price AND come back for more.

Awesome! I replaced part of the curry with cumin, and since i didn't have rice, I added frozen vegetables into the chicken when i added the red bell pepper. It's just fantastic, and healthy!

An easy and delicious dinner! I added some chicken broth with the chutney just because I wanted more sauce and it turned out great! Served with flatbread. Yum!
