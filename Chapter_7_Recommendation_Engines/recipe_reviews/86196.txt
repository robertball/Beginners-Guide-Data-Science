Just to let everyone know as the original submitter of this recipe, pikelets are not meant to be eaten as a breakfast food like pancakes. They are meant to be eaten at morning tea, tea parties, birthday parties, lunch and just as a treat or snack. It is fine if you like to use the recipe for a pancake, but originally you had them for brunch with cups of tea or coffee. Kids love them at birthday parties. Spread the pikelets with jam and put on top a big dollop of whipped cream.

It's a pretty good basic recipe. I use a little more milk than suggested to cut down on the flour flavour. I also add a dash of vanilla.

Pretty much a basic pancake recipe as far as I can tell, the only difference being using self-rising flour which is a nice timesaver.

My kids are huge pancake hounds, I doubled this for my family (five) and they still wanted more so consider that when making this.  Next time I'd triple it or even quadruple it and have some possible leftovers.

Mine didn't look like the picture, which looks kinda like a filled doughnut, but they were oh so good.  Mine looked more like silver dollar pancakes.  I was really surprised at how much flavor these had with all the more ingredients.  I made two batches in the time it would have taken to make one batch of my hubby's pancakes.  I think they are lighter than pancakes so in that I differ from other reviewers.  This is a definite keeper.  Quick and easy homestyle breakfast that can be whipped up in a snap!  Thanks so much!

I spent my HS years in New Zealand and had been craving some yummy pikelets.  These were absolutely delish!

I prefer a slightly thinner pikelet so I used roughly 3/4 c. milk and the were absolutely perfect.  Just like I had rememembered.

I've never had pikelets before, so I have no idea how to compare, but this is a nice, easy recipe for basic pancakes.  A little heavy.  Next time I will add more milk.  Also kind of plain.  I think vanilla would be good, though it tastes pretty yummy with strawberry jam! Definitely will use again, though, for how quick a simple it is.  And lower in calories than most pancake recipes!

These were great! I didn't have self-rising flour so used 1 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 1/2 tsp. double acting baking powder. My children enjoyed these with applesauce on top.

MMMMM!! I made these for breakfast this morning and they were mighty good! The kids really liked them. The first batch I made was good... but kinda bland. So for the next batch I add a little bit of vanilla extract, a couple sprinkles of cinnamon, and a TINY bit of nutmeg. MUCH better. I served these with blueberry jelly. I'll be making this soon.

Updated:** read submitters notes. They ARE the ones like I had in Scotland!! ** These were very good. These remind me of the little pancakes we would have in Scotland at tea time. I used quite a bit more milk than suggested and I  do like them just a tad sweeter so I may add more sugar next time. Lovely. Thank you

I didn't have self rising flour and using baking soda and all purpose flour didn't taste right. Use the right ingredients and they taste a lot better.

Being an Aussie, I have grown up loving these my whole life and when I get really greedy, I sandwich them together with butter and strawberry jam so I can eat two at once! This batch made about 13 pikelets. Electric frypans are best for these with even heat though I did mine on the stovetop and they turned out ok. Trick is to watch the pan getting too hot. Next time I will add a little more sugar though.

These are good and really easy! My one complaint is that mine turned out a bit tough, not really fluffy. They weren't really rubbery, just tougher than I thought they'd be. That could be my fault because I did have to substitute olive oil spread for butter and cane sugar for caster sugar. Over all, the taste is really nice, so I will definitely make these again.

I made this for my kids and some others that I babysit.  My son who eats anything, loved them with grape jelly, fresh banana slices, and fresh strawberry slices on top.  The other 6 kids tasted them, ate all the toppings, and left the pikelets on the plate.  I thought they were plain and gummy.  I always use vanilla soy milk when making baked good so maybe this contributed to a poor result.  I will try something different next time.

they were good. i used my homemade strawberry rhubarb jam and whipped cream. For me it was just a small heavy pancake. It was good. Nothing to write home about. I followed the recipe to the note. It just isn't fair to rate something unless you do!!! I did find that the thinner I made the batter, the better we liked them. I would make it again because they are just so easy.

Great recipe, very easy.  I use buttermilk in my pikelets instead of just plain milk, and it gives a fluffy mixture which makes for a lighter pikelet. Funny how here in NZ and in Aussie they call them pikelets - in the English Midlands that is the name for crumpets. The English name for this recipe would be "Scotch Pancakes".

Very good. Quick to whip up. Uses things usually on hand. My son devoured these and could have eaten the entire batch, if I hadn't had some too. This only made enough for 2 of us, so if you are feeding more or if you are feeding a teenager like I am, you may have to double this.

Thank you AussieMum.  I am an Aussie married to a Canadian and living in Canada.
I have been looking for a pikelet recipe for ages to replace the one I lost when I moved here.  My husband had never heard of pikelets.  Now he has tasted them he loves them. again, thank you.

YUMMY! I forgot to add the butter for the first one, then I added it for the rest, the rest seemed fluffier.  So much better than pancakes!

This was a great basic recipe.  I doubled the yield, and added vanilla, lemon, and topped them with cinnamon/sugar when they were done.  Excellent!  Even added a dollop of whipped cream.  My kids loved them.

These are fantastic!  I made them for a tea party my girls were hosting.  All the kids loved them.  I served them with homemade strawberry jam.  I have also added pureed zucchini to the batter and they came out perfect too!

This recipe is so great I was in a hurry and hungry. I used all-purpose flour and add baking soda instead of self rising flour. on a medium heat 7 minutes I had around 20 really yummy pikelets and they were like fluffy pancakes. So quick and really so easy. Thanks for the recipe.

These were ok but not fantastic. I cut the sugar in half but maybe I shouldn't have. They tasted very bland. I did take another reviewers suggestion and added some vanilla but they were still bland.

Different, but good.  Having never even heard of a "pikelet" I can only compare them to pancakes. These are not the light & fluffy pancakes Americans are used to, but they are good none the less. I also had to substitute A.P. flour & I took the others advice & added 1/2 t. vanilla. I served mine with blueberry sauce. I would definately make these again.

I realize this is not a pancake recipe... however I was searching for a recipe for pancakes with self rising flour since I wanted to use it up and found this.  I figured one of you might be doing the same.  It's perfect, just add vanilla and a ton more milk to the batter consistency you like.  They were super thick and fluffy, just perfect for us.  We just used regular sugar and didn't sift the flour by the way.  Thank you!  I'm sure pikelets are fabulous too!

This recipe is awesome. I'm not amiliar with Australian cuisine and make these instead of American pancakes. It works as a perfect substitute - tastes better, easier to flip, fun to eat. I serve them with a bunch of condiments - maple syrup, Nutella, whatever fruit jams I have, honey... They are so yummy and I love how the better grows in the pan, it seems less messy than a giant bowl of batter. Everyone I've made these for has loved them. Just as easy to make as any gross box mix would be, but this one has cleaner ingredients. Yummyyyyy!

So I had to improvise the recipe because I did not have "castor or superfine sugar" nor milk. I substituted it with powder sugar and evaporated milk. I don't know what Pikelets are suppose to taste like,but what I made were tasty and fluffy :)

These were awesome. I used whole wheat flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder to make it self- rising flour. These turned perfect: they weren't too heavy and they had an okay flavor. Next time I'll add some vanilla.

These were great.  I did a search for pancakes and these were on the list.  They easily cook all the way through. I topped mine with butter and syrup but I imagine they are awesome with whipped cream and fresh fruit!  Will be making again when I have those on hand.

I didn't know what pikelets were before I tried them, but they are amazing!  I served them with sour cherry jam and Devon cream (like one would serve scones), and everyone enjoyed them with tea as an after-school snack.  Thank you for introducing me to pikelets!!

Absolutely delicious. Yes, they are pikelets but I don't think I'll ever make pancakes any other way!! I tried them plain and with jam, butter, maple syrup...  It's good anyway!

These are way beyond yummy, AussieMum1! Excellent recipe. They were so incredibly light and delicious. We had them last night with maple syrup. I'm already craving them again . . . Thanks for such a great and simple recipe. Cheers!
