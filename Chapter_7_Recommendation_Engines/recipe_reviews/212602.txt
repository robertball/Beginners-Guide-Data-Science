Five stars because it couldn't be easier, but only 3 for taste.

This cheese dip was a massive hit at the b-day party I went to last night. I knew there would be a lot of people so I had to make several batches. I just added in a little salt and did both red and green pepper. Served it with regular tortilla chips and Doritos. Everyone loved it, literally. There wasn't a single complaint. Now I know the easy thing to make for parties.
