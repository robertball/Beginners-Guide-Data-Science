I did increase the ketchup a bit to give it a nice pink color and I used chopped garlic dills in place of the relish only because that was what I had on hand. This is an excellent fry sauce. If you can, make this as much in advance as you can because the longer it sits, the better it gets.

This is really good!!! I used ZATARAIN'S cajon seasoning. I didn't have ketchup so I used a dash of Worcestershire sauce and this is great!!! My husband who doesn't like mustard likes this! (Just dont tell him it has mustard)  Thanks for this share!

5-28-2016  ~We tried a little of this “on the side” in case we didn’t like it.  We didn’t like it.  Not on hamburgers anyway – it just seemed “off.”   On a chicken sandwich or wrap, a sauce for crab cakes perhaps, or on a Po’boy sandwich, this would be much more appropriate.  On a classic All American Burger, however, nothing beats ketchup and/or mustard. Note: I prepared this exactly as written in order to provide an accurate representation for myself of what it was supposed to taste like. I found it a little heavy on the yellow mustard and if there were to be a next time (probably not), I would eliminate it altogether.

Hubby declared the GOOD!  I scaled back the recipe because it does make a lot but didn't change anything else.  Thanks!

I made this sauce for our bbq and it was a hit on the hamburgers. I made one sauce as per recipe and the other sauce I added sriracha sauce to it, for my guests who like it hot.

This sauce is more than the sum of its parts. I was skeptical, wondering how mixing normal condiments together would make a "sauce". But the worcestershire sauce and spices really do elevate it to something special. We enjoyed it and I will make it again.

This is excellent. I put a little more pickle relish in (about 1/2 tablespoon more). I made Quinoa Black Bean Burgers and the sauce really topped the sandwich off. This is a must try!

I thought it was great.  I added some chopped chipotle peppers in adobo(because it was already mixed with my mayo)  It turned out really well!  Not too spicy, but still a nice sharp taste.

My 2 y/o and I loved this. Was a bit spicy... kinda reminded me of the Southwest sauce you get with your onion rings at Burger King.
