I liked this; the cinnamon and vanilla gave it a nice flavor. I'm not a big fan of avocado smoothies, but one serving of this frozen for a couple of hours was good. It was just enough to have with my breakfast, or it would be nice by itself as a snack between meals.

I love this! I added a little bit more cinnamon just because I liked the way it blended with the avocado. I tried it chilled and frozen, and I actually prefer it frozen. I think it would taste good over some wheat toast chilled. I wish there were more avocado dessert recipes like this!

I made the recipe as directed, and while there are differences in sizes of avocado, I think I had an average size.  I wanted to like this as I love avocado and everything else that went into this easy dessert, but after freezing I found it barely edible.  I left half to thaw out and added more of all the other ingredients and found it quite tasty, so I will probably make it again my own way, but it definitely needs more sweetness to it and more cinnamon.  I may even add ginger and play around with it.  Thanks for the idea.

I made this with almond extract for flavoring instead of cinnamon and used too much.  The recipe has a nice texture and I will probably make again.

I liked this. The flavor reminded me of rice pudding. I was pleasantly surprised by the pairing of the avocado and cinnamon. Thanks for sharing.

This was ok.  I prefer chocolate avocado pudding better.  I whipped up the cream/vanilla/non-refined sugar first, then folded into the creamed avocado and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.
