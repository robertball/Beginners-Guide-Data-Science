I was looking for a Black Bean and Wild Rice Salad that was different from the usual Mexican style and found this.  I made it and took it to a church salad potluck this weekend and got rave reviews.  I made the salad the day before and added the dressing the morning of the potluck as I was worried the rice would get mushy if I added it too soon.  There are two things I did differently. One was to add a large can of mandarin oranges, which was not a good idea.  My husband liked it with, but I think that was the one thing that did make it a little too juicy and I would not add again.  Sorry, honey!  The second was I did add another half cup of cranberries (I just really like them and it added some extra sweetness) and I added in some extra cashews for more crunchiness.  The salad was awesome!   I will be making this all summer as a side dish for grilled chicken or pork.  Yum!

Most excellent! I buy the bulk wild rice mix and used it instead of the packaged rice. I also used rice vinegar and a pinch of tarragon. This recipe is delicious and gets better on days two and three (if you can keep from eating it all up that long).

Awesome!  I added an apple, some extra crasins and I used white wine vinegar because it was what I had.  Served with pita bread for a fresh summer supper.  Loved it!

This got mixed reviews. My husband liked it except for the orange, I wasn't crazy about the beans, and my friend loved everything about it. I love black beans, but I would have liked this better with more rice. Also, with all the interesting ingredients, I expected bold flavor, but it didn't taste as interesting as it sounded. I also thought it could have used more cranberries, because they added a nice burst of flavor. All in all, not bad, but probably not something I'd make again.

Finally!! A healthy and delicious alternative to boring old pasta salad! Loved the freshness and color of this dish. And the flavor is fantastic. In Indiana, it's not always easy to find TRGN vinegar so I had to sub a seasoned vinegar instead. Made for a healthy lunch carry in and even my unhealthy, Mountain Dew drinking co-workers liked it. Great recipe.

Awesome.  Added chopped apple, jicima, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, green onions, and substituted parsley for cilantro from my back yard garden pot!  Added balsamic vinegar dressing to add more flavor. Topped with mandarin oranges, not mixed in. Did not have orange juice, but used a little freshly squeezed lemon.  Loved the crunch in every bite.

A pound of wild rice is expensive, let alone already cooked! Made this a while back & cooked my own mixture of brown rice with wild rice. Worked just fine, tasted great. And people, stop substituting dried herbs for fresh! So easy to grow a little pot of something fresh indoors.

Wonderful alternative for a cold salad. I made adjustments due to what I had on hand. Used bottled OJ with pulp, apple cider vinegar & a tsp of tarragon leaf, 1/2 tsp of cumin because I like it. I had pecans rather than cashews and dried cherries rather than cranberries. All substitutions seemed to work fine, the dish earned good reviews and requests for the recipe. I will use it again.

Something different and vegetarian, perfect for a cookout. I made as directed except: used dried cilantro since it's what I had on hand, my grocery store didn't have just wild rice so I used a blend of wild, red, white and brown rice. The mixture of textures with the chewy cranberries and crunchy cashews is nice.

I added red grapes and orange segments instead of black beans and skipped the cumin. The orange segments were not a hit. I did use half wild rice and half white rice. I liked it! The teenager boys did not.

My son took one bite and said, "Wow!"  Great flavors, but easy to make substitutions.  We used pecans instead of cashews, kidney instead of black beans.

This salad got better with age, as the flavors blended and the onion flavor smoothed out. I will definitely make it again, but will use less red onion.

This was awesome, I used fresh parsley as my family do not like cilantro. It was very good and even stood up to leftovers after 2 days.

With all the interesting ingredients in this salad, I was really expecting more flavor. I followed the recipe but in order to save this salad, I'll be adding lemon juice and salt to try and zip it up a bit. With wild rice, cashews and cranberries, it isn't cheap either!

Delicious! I add chopped celery for some crunch as well as  edamame. People love it. This is my current "go to" dish when I need to bring something to a friends.
