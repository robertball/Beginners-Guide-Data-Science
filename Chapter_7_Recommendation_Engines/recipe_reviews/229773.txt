I cut the brown sugar back by half and used a homemade apple butter instead of applesauce. I crushed a package of Nature Valley granola bars and sprinkled a little over each muffin mound before I baked them. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at just over 20 minutes. VERY moist muffin. These actually were even better the next day, after they'd sat overnight.

This bread came out very good. I did omit the pecans for family preference. This recipe did not miss them. The flavor was great. Thank you for a good recipe.

Omitted nutmeg and pecans. Used applesauce instead of oil as well (applesauce can be used as a healthier sub for oil, butter,and eggs in any recipe)and added 4 ripe bananas mashed in the batter. BEST BANANA BREAD EVER!

Do not be concerned that this recipe is eggless. It is delicious! I make it often throughout the school year for a treat at school or when they come home. We have even had it with a smoothie for breakfast. My 3 kids love it! I use less sugar (3/4-1 cup loose) and they still love it. I definitely recommend trying this recipe.

Very easy and tasty.  I made this for a work breakfast and didn't think one recipe would be enough, so I doubled it.  It made for a huge cake--almost too huge! However, everyone at work loved it, and I was asked for the recipe.  I left out the pecans but topped it with dried cranberries for a pretty touch.  Very tasty, very light and doesn't need anything else.  Thanks for the recipe!

I must add that since I used mini muffin tins I cut the bake time down to 20 minutes and they came out perfectly!

Third time making this bread;  also, made a loaf to give to my daughter in law, since she liked the slice she had of my first loaf; it's great warm with a cup of tea. Also, after cooling the loaf I like to wrap it in foil and refrigerate for an hour or longer, which makes it slice neatly. This loaf I added half teaspoon of lemon extract to my homemade applesauce and used 2&1/2 teaspoons of Penzeys Baking Spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg. I sprinkled fine shred organic coconut on the bottom of the prepared ceramic loaf pan, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top before baking.

This bread is SO good! Nothing needs to change. I made it in muffin form (12 muffins, 20 minutes baked) and I just want to eat the whole pan. Will definitely be making this recipe again.

I was concerned because there was no egg! Most quick bread loaves have an egg, so I added one. I also bumped up the spices and cut the brown sugar to 1 scant cup. The applesauce was sweet enough. This was delicious, rose high, and sliced beautifully.

Halved the portion --> made 5 muffins 
350 F 48 min 
 (and further extra halved brown sugar)
Omit the pecan (college broke girl lol)
Used corn oil for veg oil 

I reduced the sugar content and it turn out quite good. 
I'm supraise that the texture is not bad even though it's a vegan recipe!!
Will try again with chocolate powder and/ or coconut oil!!

Used this recipe as a base for muffins.  I omitted the apple cider vinegar and subbed walnuts for the pecans because I didn't have any.  Instead of mixing the nuts into the batter, I mixed them with 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon to make a streusel-y topping for the muffins.  The recipe made 18 muffins and took 20 minutes to bake.  The muffins have a great texture - very soft and moist .  The flavor is mostly spices with just a hint of apple.

It was delicious and my family ate it so fast that it didn't last a day.  I personally thought it was unnecessarily sweet but I used sweetened chunky applesauce next time I will use unsweetened chunky was delightful little bits of apple.

I made this today!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Just because I had whole wheat i needed to use up.  I also used toasted slivered almonds, added raisins, omitted the vinegar (only because I was out of it) and added an egg.  I made them into muffins and they turned out beautifully.  A sample taste let me know they are yummy! I can hardly wait to have one for breakfast with my coffee tomorrow.

I think this recipe needs 1 -2 eggs so it will rise and hold the rise better. It tasted good.  It just doesn't look good.
