I added a little garlic powder/onion powder to the flour before tossing it with the meat. I used fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned and red wine instead of white (that was what I had on hand). After cooking the egg noodles, I tossed them with a hunk of butter. Man oh man, this is SO DELICIOUS. The family INHALED it. No leftovers. I loved that this recipe was cheap to make and was bendable to use what I had on hand. Beef stew meat is always easy for me to buy marked down which really helps keep my food budget down.

Everyone liked this but most said just a little too much Worcestershire sauce.  I made this exactly as written except that I used fresh mushrooms and added 1 cup of beef broth in place of the canned mushroom juice.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Good recipe. I liked the fact that it didn't involve canned soup. I used red wine (I had on hand) instead of white, was delicious and a hit with kids & adults alike.

We didn't like this very much at all. Too much worcestershire sauce and ketchup. I don't recommend this recipe.

This recipe is good but sweet from the ketchup.  I used beef broth instead of wine, fresh mushrooms instead of canned and only 1/4 cup of ketchup.  I might use this again but will leave the ketchup out completely.

Fantastic, with the changes I made based on other reviews and what I had on hand.  I used ground beef, only a 'squirt' of ketchup, several dashes of Worcestershire sauce and fresh baby bella mushrooms. The family loved it!

I love this recipe!  I have made this at least a dozen times.  It's just a great concoction of flavors.  Sometimes I have left over steak, I just dust in the flour and seasoning, throw it in the pan and crisp it up for a few minutes.  Sometimes red wine sometimes white, depends on what is in the pantry at the time.  I love the onions, my wife doesn't.   Great recipe to alter to your tastes.  Easy to work with.

This was a good meal, but the Worcestershire and ketchup flavor were quite strong.  Not really what I think of as a stroganoff, the flavor is too 'heavy', but still good.  We didn't have any wine on hand, so used 1T apple cider vinegar to 1C ginger ale.

I made it but with substitutions. I used 1 pound of fresh white mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms. I didn’t use any wine. I used beef broth instead.

Surprisingly spicy. I used fresh mushrooms, which may be why there seemed to be as much meat as mushrooms in the final product. I put it in a slow cooker instead of simmering on the stovetop for 3 hours - seemed safer that way.

Delicious! Very flavorful. I've never added ketchup and Worcestershire sauce to Stroganoff before; it was excellent. I changed only one thing, and that was to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Still tasted great!

I really liked the flavors in this recipe. I will definitely make this again. I made the recipe as is except I used a pressure cooker to speed up the cooking.

I made this with a few changes. I reduced the Worcestershire sauce to 1 Tbsp, and used beef broth for the remainder; I used sirloin steak and a mixture of fresh portabella mushrooms and white button mushrooms. This made me think of my childhood-yummy!!!

Love the flavors in this recipe!  Instead of stew meat, which needs 3 hours to cook, I used some good quality steak cut into chunks, reducing cook time to 30 minutes and it was tender and delicious.  I didn't have wine, so used chicken stock.  And I love fresh mushrooms.  Great meal!

I liked it!  It was a nice variation from the standard recipe.  I cut the meat in smaller pieces and was able to cook it in half the time.

We both liked it!! A little less Worcestershire and ketchup but other than that, a delicious and creamy texture. It was kind of nice not to use a can of soup like I have in the past. This recipe had a lot more zip to it and the meat came out very tender!! Will try again...
