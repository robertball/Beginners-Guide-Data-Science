Made this tonight for my DH and SIL, (sorry I don't care for desserts).  They both gave this a solid 5 stars and said that it was really delicious.  DH really wanted a second piece but he was already too full.  I made this recipe exactly as posted.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I will keep it in regular rotation, as it was fairly easy to make.

Excellent plain or with vanilla ice cream! I'd recommend adding the milk one cup at a time so it doesn't splash everywhere when you mix it in. I'd also suggest not softening the butter in the topping and just cutting it into the mixed dry ingredients instead. If it's soft, then the topping is very gooey and not crumbly at all. Tastes fine either way, but it's just hard to glop the topping on the top of the batter if it's gooey.

I was looking for a new way to use our plums when I came across this recipe. This is the best plum desert I've had in a long time and everyone I fed it to thought it was fantastic. I did have to make one change thou, I had to bake it an additional 10 minutes as the center wasn't done. I will diffinently use this one again next year when my plums are ready.  Thanks for sharing Mark

Somebody complained about the taste of baking soda.  I can't see anywhere in the recipe where it calls for baking soda.

I have never taken the time to rate a recipe, but this one is so good I had to. I will definately be making it again (and would probably be good with many other kinds of fruit as well). The cake is nice and fluffy with a good flavor. The only change I made was a substituted part of the white sugar in the topping with brown sugar.

Just had a slice out of the oven and this was bursting with fruity goodness. It uses a LOT of plums, so you may want to cut to 6 cups. Butter can be replaced with oil, and oil and sugar can all be cut by 30% without affecting taste in the least. This would be fabulous hot with vanilla ice cream.

This is delicious! I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to nearly double the cooking time. It is worth the extra time it takes to bake. When my husband tried it, his eyes got big and said, "Do you have any extra plums?!" So I'll be making another one today and will freeze it.

This was delicious and easy to make. We ate it hot right out of the oven.  I purchased a 30 oz can of plums and was looking for a plum dessert to use them in when I came across this one. I had one can of plums so I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 9 x 9 glass dish. It still took 45 minutes to bake. I did everthing else the same, but used brown sugar instead of white in the topping.

This was great and super easy. I cut the amount of sugar in the cake in half and only used 3/4 cup butter in the cake and 1/4 cup in the topping. I used 6 very ripe plums. I also increased the vanilla to 3 tbsp and added 1 tbsp of nutmeg to the cake batter. IT WAS AMAZING warm with some vanilla ice cream I WILL be making this again! Thanks!

Just made this.my hubby loved it.Everthing is fine with this recipe, just follow the instructions.taking advice of other viewers i used cold butter for the crumb topping, topping thankfully I did & it set into a beautiful golden brown top, cake like.Also this took an additional 15min. (45+)to fully bake, else the centre wouldn't be completely baked.Also I used 1cup blueberries (frozen), as I was little short of plums.the combination was fine.I did bake it in 9by13 glass  dish &it looked beautiful. My advice use cold butter for top crumb &itll set beautifully because the bottom is already mushy/gooey u will want a firm top, else everything will be a mess . Thanks pretty kitten.

This was delcious!  I needed to bake it much longer to cook the crust all the way through.  Definately worth it but will account for longer baking time in the future.

This was really good! I especially liked the batter for the topping, such a great sweet contrast to the tart plum, next time I will definitely remember to buy some vanilla ice cream to go with this dish!

Add sugar to the plums. 5 Stars with Sugar. The bottom part with the plums was to sour for most people to eat. I will make again- but with sugar & a little flour mixed in the plums first.

My boyfriend loved this recipe. He told me he loves plum cake and this ended up being the first attempt mainly because it looked simple and didn't require fancy pans I don't own. That being said, the sweetness of this cake balances really well with the tartness of the plums. Divine!

Note: I do not keep white sugar on hand. I can't say for sure that the raw cane sugar I use made it better, however, typical results of the raw sugar includes a slightly more brown sugar taste and more moisture. Therefore, the cake baked a minute or two closer to the maximum time, perhaps a little past (I lost track). The taste came out phenomenal so I will say with confidence that if you even simply like the idea of the raw cane sugar--go for it!

To the person who couldn't find baking soda anywhere in the recipe, baking powder is nothing but baking soda with cream of tartar mixed in.
That is probably why they tasted baking soda.
The recipe is excellent as posted! Try making sure baking powder does not have lumps in it. Sometimes lumps do not get distributed all the way and gather in one bite.

This recipe was delicious.  I was given plums and wasn't sure what to do with them since I'm not a huge fan of them.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try and am glad I did.  I had 6 plums that came out to be around 6 cups after dicing.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It had sort of an apple taste to it.  Served it warm with vanilla icecream.  Would def make again.  I left the skin on the plums as I wasn't sure if I should peel them or not and it still tasted great.

I halved the recipe and used a 9 inch cake pan- worked great! I only had 1/4 cup milk so i used 3/4 cup water and was a bit worried but it turned out great! I also added 1/2 cup oats to the topping-- it seemed very creamy so i added the oats to make it more "sprinkly". Thanks for the recipe!

Can you say FANTASTIC??? My family purchased a case of plums for very cheap. I decided to try this recipe after we got tired of eating them plain. So good!!!! I will be making this again, and will be trying it with other fruit as well. I alternated the flour and milk when I mixed it, and eliminated the mess that others spoke of. I might add some sugar to the fruit the next time, but only because  prefer my fruit sweetened. Also make sure your using baking powder instead of the soda that another reviewer mentioned. But DELICIOUS! You must try it.

I loved this recipe!  The cake is super fluffy and goes well with the tart plums.  I used Santa Rosa plums with the skin the very first time.  It came out extremely sour.  The next time, I put the plums through a food mill to get rid of the skins, and it came out perfect!  I've heard that Italian prune plums are good for baking, but I haven't seen any to purchase.

It was good. I changed a few things - I put 1/2 cup of honey directly over the plums and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup in the batter. I think the cake would have been just fine without the topping. Next time, I won't make the topping.

Good flavour, and a great way to use sour plums!  Loved the crunchy baked topping!  My guests all enjoyed the dessert as well.

I've never reviewed before but this was AMAZING! My husband loved it - the taste, the textures, he's raving and he doesn't really like desserts.

Made couple of tweaks - our raspberries just ripened so added some of those to the plums. I also added the zest of an orange and half the juice from it when I added the milk - gave it a nice edge. Also used golden castor sugar as someone recommended using brown (good tip thanks).

Used about 2/3 of the topping and might use less sugar next time. Cooked it for about half an hour extra as had rectangular dish. Thank goodness it's so filling so we can't eat it all in one sitting!.

I have made this a few time and LOVE IT. The batter recipe is excellent and can be used for many other fruit recipes. For this recipe, play with the amount of plums. I use Santa Rosa plums. 7 cups is a lot of plums and you definitely need to use a deeper pan. The cake will soak up the plum juice quickly, turning it in to a bread pudding. If you don’t like it like this, reduce the plums to 4 cups or as low as 2 cups finely chopped. I prefer to make the topping using half white and half brown sugar. If you are having trouble with your crumb topping texture, keep adding flour to your liking. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg as well. You just can’t go wrong with this!

We have excess fruit from our two tress and came across this recipe. It's very easy to make and tastes delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream! Did however, take a lot more time to bake then what is listed in recipe.

I give this a solid five stars. I made it exactly as written. The cake portion of the recipe has a fantastic texture...not really cake, not quite pudding cake. I'm not one to bake often and mostly purchase desserts, but I'll make an exception for this recipe because I've found nothing like it anywhere else.

I halved the recipe as it was just for two of us.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated just added one apple.  Very good. Even my husband liked it and he claims to not like plums.

I followed the recipe. The topping was more soft than crumbly so I just placed some topping around on the cake.  I also  had to bake an additional 10 min because the center wasn’t done.overall, a yummy cake!

Baked for about 90 minutes. Tastes delicious! A few notes: Make sure to use a tall 9x13 pan - I started in a shorter one and realized it was all going to run over so fortunately transferred to a taller one before adding the batter. I wouldn't soften the butter for the crumb topping - it wouldn't crumble - too soft. 4 stars only because the baking time was SO far off. Otherwise it is a great recipe! You could probably lessen the sugar and it would still be good.

I needed something other than plum butter to use up the oodles of plums my sister brought from her tree. This buckle is AMAZING. It's delightful, not too sweet, and so fluffy. My only criticism is that the crumble on top didn't really turn out for me, but then again, I have pretty bad luck when it comes to crumbles. So anyway, I didn't get the texture of the topping, but the whole thing still tastes SO good.

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe as written. It overflowed my 9x13 (luckily I had put a tray under it thinking it might do that). Next time I would recommend splitting the recipe between a 9x13 and an 8x8. OR better yet, at 9x13 and a cast iron skillet! That would be amazing.

My recommendation to Bridgette would be to use baking powder (as the recipe calls for) instead of baking soda. It will make a huge difference in the final result...

Very tasty. The only change  I made is for the topping I used oatmeal instead of flour and brown sugar instead of white. I  should have used a larger pan also, next time.

Loved the recipe.  However, I found that the cake part was too  much and overwhelmed the delicious plums.  I solved the problem  by doubling the amount of plums and then flipping the whole concoction upside down.  The result was aplomb soaked dessert that received rave reviews.

I really liked this recipe & it reminded me of cobbler.  I liked it better without vanilla ice cream.  The very sweet ice cream seemed to make the plums taste sour.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. Turned out excellent and after it was gone Hubs demanded I make it again! Sweet and tart all in one bite! Add some vanilla ice cream and you'll think you're in heaven! Also made this with apples. Thank you for this great and easy recipe!

This was heavenly, big hit with family and friends! Had about 3 3/4 cups of over ripe plums so cut the receipe in half which worked out great! Even though I only used half the recipe still needed the same size pan to prevent over flowing of juice from plums I used. Perhaps with prune plums there might not have been as much juice. Definitely recommend it with the ice cream although it was good without.

Swapped 1/2 the flour for  whole wheat and exchanged 2c of the plums for mulberries (all fruit was frozen but thawed prior to construction.  ) This was a spectacularly easy and flavorful treat- will be trying it with other fruit combos to!

I just made this dessert and it was delicious!  I didn't have enough plums so I added apples to it. Worked great! It cooked perfectly in the time recommended but didn't brown on the top so I put the convection fan on for 4 minutes. Beautiful and yummy!

The Best cake. Add vanilla ice cream on the side and it's off the charts. I don't use white flour or white sugar, so I replaced it with whole wheat flour and coconut sugar from trader joes.

Absolutely delicious.  I baked mine in a glass dish and it looked so pretty too.  Didn't change a thing. Didn't need to.

This was quite good - like many others, I had a bunch of plums that were going soft and needed to be used. The fruit part of the cake was quite tart, I might add a bit of sugar next time. The cake was very good, but the cinnamon topping was not crumbly for some reason - it went on gooey. I was expecting it to be more like a coffee cake topping. I found it definitely benefited from vanilla ice cream...

Easy-I was concerned how it would flip out of baking pan-I used 2 smaller baking pans -one to keep and one to share-flipped first to cutting board and then to plate- So good

Delicious and moist. Made this because I had plums I didn't know what to do with. Wonderful!
