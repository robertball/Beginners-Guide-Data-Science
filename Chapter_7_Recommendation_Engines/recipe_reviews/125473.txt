It wasn't exactly a fruit salad, it wasn't  exactly a tuna salad; it wasn't an appetizer dip.  I don't know what exactly it was, other than something I'm never going to make again!

I really enjoyed this. It was different than my usual tuna salad recipe. I did not add that much red wine vinegar (just a couple of splashes). I didn't have an apple so I threw in some dried cranberries. Thanks!

This was a fun recipe.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and used 1 TBSP of miracle whip light.  It was a little dry.  But I really liked it and so did my husband.  We ate it wrapped in romaine.  Nice change from the standard tuna recipes.
