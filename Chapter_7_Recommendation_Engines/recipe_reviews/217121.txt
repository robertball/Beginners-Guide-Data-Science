This is my recipe and I've made it many more times since I first submitted it.  I have found that it usually takes longer to bake.  Unfortunately, the inside does not cook as fast as the outside.  If you bake it for 20 minutes, cover lightly with foil and bake another 20 minutes you will have a nice crust that is cooked all the way through.

I made this today and read all of the reviews first. I took two cans of turkey chili and beans from Trader Joe's and poured them into a 9x13 oblong baking dish sprayed with pam. Then I sprinkled two kinds of cheese over the chili.
In a bowl, I mixed one box of Jiffy Cornbread mix with one egg, and added 1 can of creamed corn and about a quarter cup of milk. I mixed it up and poured it over the chili and cheese. I put it in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes. Took it out and put more cheese on the top, put the foil back on for 10 minutes. 
I served this with sour cream, olives, and Pace picante sauce. It is a family family fave now.  From the Baer Family in Tacoma, WA

I really liked how easy and fast this was to make. The flavor was also very good. I have not had canned turkey chili before but found that I could barely tell he difference from the beef kind. The cooking time specified in the recipe worked fine for me.

We made it tonight and it was gone in minutes! We used only one can of chili and leftover pork from the night before. We used Marie Calendars corn muffin mix and used half for extra muffins since it made am twice as much mix as called for. Next time I will just make a double batch so the guys can take it to lunch the next day too they were sad their were no leftovers!

Great go to recipe. I've already made this three times. Following other reviewers suggestions I cook for 20 minutes uncovered and 20 more minutes covered with foil. After putting the chilli in I top it with about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I've made it with turkey chilli and original chilli either way it turns out delicious.

Great easy dinner. Have made multiple times now and in order to cook all the way need to bake for 20 min then cover with foil and bake another 20.

It was easy and tasted relatively good. However after cooking for 25 minutes the center of the bread was not cooked (was liquid dough in the center). I covered it with aluminum foil and had to cook for another 30-40 minutes. I was frustrated with the length of time and our delayed dinner.

This made a great meal. I baked it for 20 and then 20 more with foil and it was baked perfectly. We prefer Chunky's firehouse chili and the jiffy cornbread worked great with that.

I'm so excited to try this! I found out that the 9 in. pie pan didn't hold all of it so I'm gonna have to use a bit less chili next time. Oh and I used jalapeño chili instead of turkey so we'll see how that goes! Thanks a bunch for this awesome and super easy recipe!

This tasted so good and really easy to make. I definitely will make this again. I did make a change and added some cheddar cheese to the cornbread mix. I also sprinkled it on top too.

Very easy. Very tasty and filling. Perfect for a cold rainy night. Yes I'll make it again. However I may try it with only one can of chili if making it for just my daughter and me.

I haven't tried it yet but I'm going to line the dish with parchment and then crumble day old cornbread as a "crust". then I'm adding the canned chili and top it with some Jiffy cornbread. I probably won't add all the Jiffy cornbread to bake.

Loved how easy this was to pull together! The turkey chili is nice because of the leaner protein. Followed others advice and did 20 minutes uncovered then 20 minutes covered with foil. Came out perfect. I used a 2.5 qt. casserole dish and there was plenty of room. Pie plate probably would be too shallow.

I halved this recipe because we are only two and I only had one can of chili. After reading about the time issues some people were having I divided the chili between two bowls and gently warmed them a little in the microwave before spreading the cornbread batter over the top so it only took about 25 minutes to bake. I forgot to add cheese before that layer and I think that would have improved the dish. Also I think my cornbread layer came out too thick like the batter would have spread better if it'd been a little thinner in consistency (maybe my egg was on the small side?). If there's a next time I'll go with my gut and add a little more milk. I'll also try a different brand of chili or maybe try this when I have some of my own chili leftover.

Kids and I were craving this, so I made it Monday night. What a hit! I used one can of chili, added a can of corn, and sprinkled cheese on the top for the last 10 minutes of baking.  

Easy to make; I think I paid $5 and fed 3 hungry students, with leftovers for work the next day.

Serve with refried beans and spanish rice for a nice southwestern spin on it.

Highly recommended by this busy dad.

I decided last minute to use a Jiffy Mix to make my chicken chili more festive. I used a glass casserole dish & spread half the Jiffy mix on the bottom, added the chili & spread the rest on top with some cheese. I cooked in 20 minutes on 400, which is normally too hot for glass, but this came out perfectly cooked, browned & delicious!

I added sliced several things. For one I doubled the Jiffy mix. I wanted more corn bread on this mix. In addition I added jalapenos serranos 1/2 can of corn 3 garlic cloves and sautéed them before adding to the mix. Oven for 25 minutes. I made 3 contains of beef 3 of turkey and one veggie for my work. Enough to feed 50. No complaints!!! Good deal!
