i stretch saying i tried this recipe because i had pork chops and honey mustard, but no peach preserves or lemon juice. i chopped up some canned apricots and used some of the syrup. i baked the chops sauce and all in the oven at 300 since it's cold out right now! 

this was delicious and i can't wait to get peach preserves. thank you for inspiring me to try changing my comfort food, i never don't make gravy with my pork chops :)

Wonderful flavor with pork chops- very flavorful but not overwhelming.  Easy and no need for marinade time.  Only change I made was some cracked pepper and kosher salt on the chops prior to grilling/basting.

What a delicious twist to traditional chops! I made a few changes (not on purpose). I used low-sugar apricot preserves instead. I had two bottles of apricot, could have sworn I bought peach preserves! Apricot was delicious and I imagine peach would taste even better! I planned on grilling but Mother Nature had other plans. I seasoned with salt and pepper and seared then basted with sauce. Maybe next time when I try the peach, I will add a little ground ginger and cayenne pepper for a kick.

This sounded very weird to me but tasted surprisingly good - and both men in the house approved! If I had had any, I might have tried using leftover basting mixture as dipping sauce.

I enjoyed the flavor but I think I overcooked the chops because they were a bit dry. i think I'll bake them next time.

I used half of the sauce to marinate the pork overnight then basted the rest on while broiling for 10 minutes. Came out fantastic!

I normally don't like pork chops but I decided to give this a try.  It wasn't bad.  I'll probably make this again some time.  It was a nice change from just frying them.
