This recipe is incredible, but I did change some things. I made it with 1 lb. of shrimp and YUM!!!! I used olive oil instead of avocado oil, 1 packet of Truvia instead of sugar, I used green onions with the bigger bulbs and added sliced mushrooms, roughly chopped baby bok choy and the broccoli.  It was so delicious that my husband wanted it again tonight! Tonight, I made a double batch because my 10 year old son was home. He loved it and asked me to get him a Thermos so that he can take it to school for lunch lol. This will be a regular in our house. (Side note: I think A Taste of Thai coconut milk is my new favorite! It has so much more coconut flavor than my usual brand)

I was only cooking for myself, so I did half of everything. I had a cup of coconut milk, Three tsp of lime juice, 2 tsp of fish sauce, tsp red curry paste, tsp of ground ginger, and sprinkled garlic powder heavily on top. I didnt have oyster sauce but it worked great with out it. 
I served it with tilapia and 8 shrimp over brown rice. This was delish!! 
Thanks for the recipe!

My husband wanted more!  I did make a few changes. I didn't have oyster sauce or chili-garlic sauce so I left them out.  I also used coconut oil instead of avocado oil. And I increased the curry powder to 2 tsp.and added a good dash of cayenne pepper.  The sauce was thinner than I like so I thickened it with about a Tablespoon of corn starch.

Had my best friend over for dinner and she can't have gluten, so I thought this paleo recipe would be perfect. Come to find oyster sauce has gluten in it so beware! Thankfully I caught the mistake and omitted it. Pretty good recipe, made 3 generous portions when served over rice. Chicken was just a tad bit dry and it definitely could've used more than 2 cups of broccoli! Will be making it again however :)

I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the oyster sauce and used coconut oil instead of avocado oil. At first I was worried the fish sauce would ruin the dish (it didn't smell good after adding it) but it turned out really good! I served it on top of brown rice (I'm not on the Paleo diet) and a side of veggies. I'll be making this one again!

Excellent. I did add extra curry powder, a little salt and used honey in place of the sugar. At the end I added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a bit of water to thicken the sauce a bit. It was super yummy. Thank you!!

Perfect blend of ingredients. Made recipe substituting avocado with sesame oil, used 3 cut up chicken thighs for the protein.  However, I do suggest marinating the meat and seasoning the vegetables slightly to avoid blandness. Other ingredients were used to recipe specs. This recipe is spot on! Can't wait to make it again for my family.

I made it using shrimp and it turned out delicious.  Added some carrots and yellow peppers which added a nice flavor.  Served over a bed of rice.  My family devoured it!  Not a morsel was left!

We enjoyed this and served it over cauliRice. My only issue was not sufficient curry. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add lots more curry and also some mushrooms.

Delicious! The only modifications I made was to omit the oyster sauce because I didn’t have any, seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt and pepper before cooking, doubled the curry because I simply love curry and used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and a can of bamboo shoots instead of the broccoli. It was a bit runnier than I am used to, but all that flavor soaked into the rice over which it was served. So good! Will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this a few times and have loved it every time.  I have used both chicken breasts and thighs, and both broccoli and green beans.  A couple of changes on the last time made it even better as I added red bell pepper and I salted the chicken just a little as it was cooking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I'm curious what made you believe this was Paleo at all.  Besides that... this is a good recipe... a little to sweat from me so I didn't include the sugar at all - but the coconut milk with the curry makes the dish.

I used shrimp instead of chicken and left out the oyster sauce. I also used a smaller frying pan and boiled the shrimp in the curry sauce instead of sauteing it beforehand. It had great flavor and went well served over rice. Next time I'd like the sauce to be a little thicker so I'll add some cornstarch. Can't wait to try it again!

I realized I never reviewed this but that's my picture currently on the main page! This was so good and so easy to make. It was dinner for one and just what I needed. I only changed the avocado oil for coconut oil since I had that on hand it would pair nicely. Oh and I likely added more sriracha because I love spicy food. Great recipe!!
