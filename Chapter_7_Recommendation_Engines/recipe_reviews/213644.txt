i loved this! I used fresh dough and baked it prior to the toppings. My hubbs thought the blue cheese was WAY to much! I used 3/4c blue cheese and 1/4 cup feta. Blue cheese is very strong and we used the 'good' blue ;)

This was very easy to make and surprisingly good.  I wasn't sure how the flavors would mesh on a pizza, but my husband loved it.  I did add crumbled turkey bacon for a little extra flavor.

This is delicious! I'm craving it right now in fact. I added mozzarella cheese and some chicken. It had just the right amount of blue cheese that the recipe called for. I loaded it with asparagus, but to make slicing the pizza easier, place the asparagus straight towards the center and slice between them. Otherwise, it gets messy!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I can't believe how easy it was.  A pre-made pizza kit, fresh asparagus and a small package of blue cheese makes for an extremely easy but very gourmet meal.  Fresh asparagus is in season right now, and it complimented the blue cheese nicely.  It was also delicious with my merlot.  I will make again, but I do recommend making this one when asparagus is in season, because the taste of new asparagus is out of this world.

I did not use the tomato sauce base - instead I used fresh tomatoes with asparagus and cheese and thought it was quite good. Added some fresh oregano as well.
