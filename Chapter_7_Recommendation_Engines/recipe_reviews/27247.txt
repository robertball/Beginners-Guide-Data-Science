Too much of a vinegar flavor...I doubt that I will bother with this again.

This is an excellent dressing for pasta salad.  It tastes like something you would bet off a salad bar.  I used a jarred sun dried tomato pesto.  It was very tangy so I did add about a teaspoon of sugar and thought this made it perfect.  I then tossed with cooled bow tie pasta, cubed cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers and olives.  Both my husband and I really liked the dish.  I am not sure how I would care for it on a salad though, I am also wondering how it would taste on hot pasta.  I will probably try that next.

This is very good.  I added some fresh lemon juice for some more flavor.  It was great with the fresh herb salad and grilled chicken breast salad I made.
