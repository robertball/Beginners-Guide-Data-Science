I did my best to cut this back to one sandwich. I did not have reduced fat feta cheese, I just used regular feta cheese. Instead of lettuce leaves, I used fresh spinach because that was what I had on hand. This was a filling sandwich--I had a half cup of leftover broccoli salad to go with and I was plenty satisfied.

Delicious! Plus it's perfect for a light lunch! I love deli flats, but instead I put everything into a whole wheat tortilla for a nice wrap sandwich adding a some fresh spinach leaves vs. lettuce.

I loved this! I used roasted red pepper hummus (still kept the diced red pepper, too), and spinach leaves instead of lettuce. Oh, and I used ARNOLD brand sandwich thins, the multi-grain kind. Delicious!
