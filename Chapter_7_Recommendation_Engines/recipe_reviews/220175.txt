This recipe was definitely colorful and a nice change from the usual. I did omit the tofu and almonds and used dried dill and parsley instead of fresh (all to save some $). I also don't like kale or cabbage completely raw so I steamed each until just slightly softened. The dressing was a little salty from the soy sauce, but otherwise pretty good. Next time I might reduce the soy sauce and add some honey.

I made this recipe for a party and left with an empty bowl and yummy compliments. I used black sesame seeds and a bit of fresh lime juice because I didn't have enough fresh lemon juice. Everyone loved the tamari almonds and finely cubed tofu! I used Russian kale, which has a relatively soft, flat leaf. I will make this salad again. Sorry no photo . . . empty bowl!

Good and Different enough that I will make again for variety sake. I prefer the kale with quinoa instead of rice as in a salad from this site. The cabbage kind of got in the way of the other flavors as well, maybe I added too much? Husband and teenage son had no such complaints and I really liked the dressing, so 5 stars it is. Thanks for submitting! Edit: I use tamari instead of soy sauce, always. Not as sharp or salty.

The best kale salad everrrrrr.  Didn't use tofu and added a bit of extra olive oil in the dressing.  The fresh herbs really do make a difference and the dill especially makes it really special. Have had lots of requests for this recipe and it will certainly be a regular from now on.

I used quinoa instead of brown rice, but next time I would use the rice.  Probably a brown rice and wild race blend.  I would also try upping the ratio of parsley and almonds and adding honey to the dressing.  I used more carrot and tofu than called for.  I marinated and baked my tofu before using.  This is a hearty salad that can actually survive as leftovers.  It's definitely for kale lovers and people who enjoy healthy eating.

I thought I was going to hate this recipe. But I was so wrong. I made tamari almonds from scratch since I didn't have any but added a little wasabi...this was genius since now I have leftover almonds. I substituted red quinoa for brown rice. Used regular soy sauce. Used dried dill instead of fresh. And fried my tofu in peanut oil first. Would totally make this again!

Taste much better a day or two later. I omitted the tofu because of not liking the texture. Instead I doubled the amount of carrots, kale and cabbage. I listened to other reviews and cut the tamari to 1/3cup. At first the tamari sauce made it a little salty but the next day it was just right. I also used dry herbs, about tsp of each, and found the flavor to be quite delightful. I will definetely make again, but next time I will have it sit in the fridge overnight before serving.

This is sooo good! I added 2 cups chopped spinach.Didn't have almonds, and used regular light soy. Healthy. Colorful. Delicious. I will try it with all listed ingredients next time.

This recipe is awesome.  I made it with local Kale from our CSA and the rest was organic ingredients from Whole Earth in Princeton. I made some minor tweaks to amounts and I baked the tofu cubes in 1Tbsp of Tamari & 1 tsp oil at 350 for 15 minutes. This makes a lot but I brought to an outdoor concert & everyone loved it... YUM!

I loved this, but definitely changed a fair number of things. I didn't add any tofu, couldn't find tamari almonds so i just used slivered almonds, and used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds, subbed sesame oil for olive oil, and added some honey to the sauce because it just seemed like it needed some sweetness to balance it out. Used quinoa instead of rice, and should have made more, my bunch of kale must have been enormous! Overall, excellent though, and easy to alter.

I followed the recipe exactly and wanted to love this salad based on all the healthy, fresh ingredients and lovely colors. The salt from the soy sauce in the dressing was overpowering in my opinion and I didn't even add the salt to taste as directed. Maybe more rice to absorb the salty taste? Less soy sauce? I want to try this recipe again, but definitely need to adjust something.

Too much soy sauce.  Reduce it to 1/4 cup or less.

Didnâ€™t use almond, feta, soy sauce, sesame seeds, lime juice, or parsley. I used already cooked white rice, lemon juice, and marinated mushrooms. Really clean tasting
