next time I might try a little almond extract in the dough, I think this a wonderful recipe!  I also  used reconstituted dried figs:)

They were good, but they take a longer time to cook than the recipe called for. The filling was weird there's a little too much honey and the cinnamon added a weirder taste to it and it needed a thicker and sweeter substance. The consistency was good and the dough cooked well.

I'm not the best measurer so ended up with a little too much nutmeg. But they were very good.
