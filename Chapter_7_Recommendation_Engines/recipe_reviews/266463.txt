I am the submitter of the recipe and yes 1 lbs of meat is correct! Yes we get 12 large meatballs out of this recipe! Adding in the zucchini bread crumbs cheese and eggs in addition to everything else really bulks up the recipe so you only need 1 lbs of ground turkey! If you want to add more by all means do so! But it isn't necessary!

I added some extra italian season breadcrumbs at the end because it was too soft to make meatballs out of. then i used the broiler to brown them at the end because they were not browning in the oven

I have not made this yet but know from experience that 1 pound of turkey for this recipe is not enough for 12 large meatballs! That must be a mistake stating 1 pound of ground turkey. They sound OK except for this.

They were very good! The only thing I did differently is I cooked them longer. I took a bit to make them shredding zucchini takes a bit?? All in all I ll definitely make them again!

I followed the recipe and I could see this would not make meatballs. The mixture didn t hold shape at all. The flavor was good but I made a meatloaf with it. I wondered if it needs two pounds of meat?
