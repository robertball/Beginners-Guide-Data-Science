I made this recipe in my bread machine.  It turned out very well--nice texture and a light rye bread taste.  I agree with Phyllis's mother; it's just about ideal.

Nice twist on a rye loaf.  I used buttermilk instead of buttermilk powder, so I used the amount of liquid called for (water) by subbing buttermilk instead.  I just left out the powdered buttermilk.  This makes a loaf that is clearly rye but with a bit of an extra zip.  I rarely bake fully in the bread machine, so I did the dough cycle and then baked in the oven at 375 for 40 mins.  Turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite rye bread recipe to date.  I made only one change, which was to use First Clear Flour instead of bread flour.  First Clear Flour (available from Baker's Catalogue, a gread resource for serious bread makers) is described as "the flour NYC bakers have always used for the signature Jewish-style rye breads...in combination with rye flour." Maybe this change will bring this recipe up to your mother's ideal -- who knows?!

Very nice bread! I love the wholesome taste of the rye combined with the tang of buttermilk. I added a tiny bit of wheat to mine, too, and about 1/4 cup of plain yogurt that I needed to get rid of. Thanks for the post!

I baked this in a covered clay baker for 40 min. at 400 degrees.  Used the dough cycle, let rise in the baker, then covered it and baked in the oven.  Nice light rye flavor and very light in texture.  I love it!!!  I don't usually bake white bread and like wheat or rye.

Best rye bread to come out of the breadmaker yet!  I used 1 1/3 cups of buttermilk since I had some to use up instead of the powdered, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It smelled terrific while baking.  The caraway seed really punched up what I think of as rye flavor.  I will try adding that to my other rye bread recipe and see if it helps

The bread came out fine...but I wasn't "wowed". I've tasted better.

I loved the texture and tangy flavor of this loaf.  I added 1 tsp. dough enhancer to the dough and shaped and baked it in a 350 degree F. oven for 35 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used butter instead of vegetable oil.  It looked great and was delicious!

Love it. I didn't have potato flakes, so I cooked 1 big potato in a microwave, I didn't reduce liquids (you should usually reduce it by quarter cup for 1 big potato too substitute this amount of instant potato) and because of my dough was a bit too moist I baked it for 55 minutes at 350F. Turned out perfect.

This is a nice combo of the traditional buttermilk and rye breads, light in color but crusty like rye bread.  I made this in the KA mixer, and the only thing that I would do differently next time would be to add more caraway seeds to suit our tastes.  Wouldn't call it either soft or dense but, perhaps, firm would be a good description of the bread.  It does make nice sandwiches.

This is a really nice rye bread from a bread machine.  Don't think hard rye, think moist soft rye with a nice chew to the crust and a really good crumb (used regular white cycle with light crust selected).  

I first made this some months ago and made a note that it was an easy recipe with nice outcome.  I myself a note to try again.

I made this recipe again yesterday and after a test slice with butter was forced to go to the store for some deli ham, swiss, a bit of salami, and some hot mustard.  This bread just SCREAMS sandwich me.
