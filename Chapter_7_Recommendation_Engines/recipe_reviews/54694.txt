Excellent pie!! I added a tsp of cinnamon to the sugar/flour/butter mix that goes on top of the pie.  I took this to my family's thanksgiving meal and I was really nervous because I am not known for been a good baker (or dessert lover) in the family but everyone loved it!  I had a bite and it was really tasty. I did cook it about 10 min longer than called for and some of the butter/moisture from the topping bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven (which I guess I have to clean anyways) but all in all, excellent and easy pie. My family couldn't believe it came from canned pears!  Thank you Tanya!!

I made this pie for family and everyone really liked it.  Only problem was it bubbled up and over the pie pan.
Was quick and easy to make, especially since you use canned pears.  I have never made a pie with canned fruit, but this was pretty tasty.

Very tasty! But I wonder if this freezes well at all? I made little tartlets with this recipe for a Bible study which got cancelled last minute and now have 2 trays of these tarts. Anyone tried freezing these? SO I did freeze them and they did turn out well after I reheated them in the oven. It was a hit!

This is a scrumptious pie! The topping was especially lovely...I added some almond extract which really gave it something special. I didn't have graham crackers so I made a crust in my food processor with brown sugar, melted butter, flour, salt, vanilla extract, almonds, and candied ginger. The pie was a little runny when I cut it but DANG it was good!

I think this pie is fantastic.  It's such a unique flavor!  My husband, daughter, and parents love it, but my sister-in-law finds it too rich.  Personally, I didn't think it too rich at all.  Definitely a recipe to try at least once!

Very good!  I let it bake until the topping turned golden (beware of possible drippage). A little whipped cream on top and you're set with a refreshing dessert.

This was a really nice recipe!  I did make some changes to suit my family better though.  First, I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the filling, and I also used fresh, ripe pears in the filling instead of canned ones.  I didn't use a graham crust but instead made pie crust using the recipe on the Crisco box, it always turns out for me and delivers a nice, flaky crust.  Lastly, I added some oatmeal to the topping.  We really liked this pie, and will make it again, it would be quite refreshing in the summer!

I don't like pears, but I made this pie for a friend and I really enjoyed it. So far its always been a hit everytime I've made it. It can be time consuming because you crumble the crust on half way. and I always broil the top for 2 mins approx, otherwise it doesn't brown. (Watch it carefully) and it serves better after it's cooled.

This has become a favorite request for dinner get-togethers.  Thanks for such an unusual treat.  My sister's boyfriend loved it so much, he converted the recipe to feed 100 for the church camp he cooks for.  Incredible!

This pie was great!! My husband don't like pie's that much, but said I could make this one as often as I like. The only thing is I didn't care for the gramhan cracker crust. So I made it again and I used a regular flour pie crust and that once was perfect!

I used Fresh pears from our trees. It turned out fabulous. I loved using the graham cracker crust as it didn’t get soggy like a normal pie crust. I will definitely be making this again!

I thought it  is an excellent pie! I don't normally like fruit pies but I had some pears to use up. I used 4 ripe pears and 1 can of halved pears and ended up with enough filling for 2 pies. I didn't change anything else and I really like this pie. Will make it again!

This is a GREAT recipe to try, if you're looking for 'something a bit different'. I made it for Thanksgiving, and all loved it. The only change I would make would be to reduce the amount of butter in the crust by half; the full amount was enough to leak out the top of the pie and make a ghee-burn mess in my oven. I'll be making this one again, though with the butter reduction.

I never ate or even heard of a pear pie before making this recipe but I was looking for a recipe that utilized the cans of pears I had. This pie is delicious!  it is refreshing and the crumb topping is amazing.

The only change I made was to use fresh pears, approx. 5 large, and added a little cinammon on the top finishing dough. Very good. Thank you for the recipe.

I thought this was very good and looked just  like the picture. I did use unsweetened canned pears and patted them dry with a paper towel before cutting them.  I got a lot of compliments on the pie. It was different and was very tasty. I served it with vanilla ice-cream. I actually didn't read the recipe correctly and added the topping on at the beginning and it turned out fine. I did put a cookie sheet underneath the pie plate and used a 9" fruit pie plate as it is larger and I had very little spillage.

This pie is soooo delicious!!  My family's eyes lit up when they took a bite, and each one raved about it.   We love a good pie and have some great recipes, but this might have taken over the "favorite" spot.   

Our pear tree produced an abundance this year, so I used 1 1/2 pints of my canned pears which was perfect for this recipe, but it made for a very full pie. I made no other changes to the ingredients.  However, I added 10 more minutes to the cook time before adding the topping then I added almost  12 more minutes after I added the topping.  Then I broiled the top for under 2 min.  Keep your eye on it while broiling!  The top came out perfectly crispy, and the pie was not gushy at all but nice and moist.  Make sure to put it on a cookie sheet while baking, because it will flow over a bit.  It is just right in its rich taste in our opinion, but 1 piece will fill you up!  It will definitely be a crowd pleaser!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

we really enjoyed this pie, exactly as it's explained in the directions. So refreshing, delicious and way easier than other similar ones wich more effort. I was very heavy handed with the cinnamon, as we like it a lot. It's great cold, and after a few days it's even better as all the tastes have blended in

This pie was a hit with the family.  I personally thought it was a bit to sweet, but I am just the cook, so my opinion doesn't really count.  Those I prepared it for, loved it!  So this will remain in my dessert rotation.  Thank you for sharing Tanya

I made this on 3/14 to celebrate PIE day. ;) I added a tsp of almond extract to the egg/sour cream mixture, as a couple other reviewers suggested. DELISH!!  My youngest son doesn't like pie, but he tried a piece and LOVED it!!

This turned out to be one of my most successful desserts ever. My lunch guests went into rhapsodies. The only addition was putting it under the broiler for slightly under two minutes, turning it a rich color and partially caramelizing the topping. This one's a keeper.

I haven't eaten this pie yet, but I know already that there is entirely too much butter in the topping. It's cooking into a big dripping (smokey oven!!) greasy mess already.... if it survives the smoked flavor, I'm hoping it will still taste good. Other than the puddles of buttery grease on top, it's still attractive. As long as it doesn't catch fire...

The main reason I made it was because canned pears had been left at my house, but it was quite good.

I made this using raw fresh pears so it took awhile longer to bake. Next time I will pre-cook the pears before making the pie. This pie was amazingly delicious. It tasted both light and yet rich, like a fruit pie yet like a cream pie. and I usually prefer a rolled crust but the graham cracker crust was exactly right for this recipe. Everyone LOVED it. Next time I need to bake two.

Im really surprised this is so highly rated. Its not bad, but just not...really anything. I thought the pear flavor was too mild and the topping bland and not sweet enough. Needs something else in the filling to make it have more taste, definitly!

A great twist on apple pie. It felt like it would be fancier than it turned out, but my entire book club LOVED it!
