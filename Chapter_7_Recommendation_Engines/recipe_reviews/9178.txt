These are probably my most requested dessert. Be sure to bake them until the center will no longer move when you shake the pan. Let them cool completely or you will have a mess! They always turn out great and they are SO easy!

This is the most delicious (and probably the least healthy) recipe on this website.  I've made this quite a few times now, and I'm getting better at it.  Bake the bottom layer for only 15 min, or until solid, just don't overcook it.  Oh, and don't be afraid that it's so tough to spread over the bottom of the pan; it's meant to be that way, and you haven't done anything wrong.
IMPORTANT:  These WILL come out gooey.  I ALWAYS cook them a day ahead of time and leave them in the fridge overnight BEFORE cutting them up.  You can also use just 1 cup of corn syrup without much difference to the recipe.  This way, you use exactly half of a bottle of Karo Dark Corn Syrup (8 oz = 1 cup).  But still, the full amount will give you the full experience of these bars :)

Excellent.  This is certainly the easiest of the "Pecan Pie Bar" category.  However:

The picture attached to this one is NOT, I repeat, NOT what these bars look like.  Take the cake layer (in the middle) and move it to the bottom, and mix the other two layers on top and you have an idea closer to what they really are.

Also, I agree with previous reviewers on this thread  that this version may be a bit too gooey and will not stay together.  However, they were much better after they had refridgerated for 24 hours and re-thawed, and I also may have accidentally added too much corn syrup.  If this happens to you, no problem-- I still had people compliment them even when I myself was severely disappointed!

I'm making these again tomorrow.  I will update then.

Mmmm.  I used butter pecan cake mix instead of yellow and I believe this made them even more d-lish!  Yes, the bottom crust was difficult to spread and pat into the pan but it did work.  I allowed mine to cool some before I put the filling on top.  The filling wasn't done in 35 minutes.  As every oven temp differs, mine took 45 minutes until the center no longer jiggled when I shook the pan.  I took the advice of others and allowed it to cool then I put them in the fridge over night to harden some so it can cut easier as they are gooey/creamy in the midddle (yummy). A very good peacan bar.  THX

Something is missing from this recipe. I have tried to make it twice now and the crust or whatever you pat in the pan and bake for 15-20 mins is pure glue, I followed it exactly using Imperial margarine with one egg and cake mix (minus the 2/3 cup reserved cake mix), It still didn't work!

Very good, followed the directions exactly and turned out great.  Made them for Thanksgiving instead of the Pecan Pie.  Definitely served more than a pie would have.

Totally love this recipe! I've made it MANY times (for Thanksgiving AND Christmas) and it's ALWAYS a huge hit!! My Aunt (who is a MAJOR league accomplished baker) asked me for the recipe!!! There are some reviews stating that something with the crust is amiss.  My suggestion is to make it EXACTLY as it states - with butter!  This is NOT a "healthy" dessert, so if that's what you're looking for, you might want to skip this one and keep looking instead of making alterations and then giving it a bad review (not fair in my opinion).  Anyway.... :)  The only suggestion I have is to make sure that the crust is nice and golden and then wait five minutes after you take it out of the oven and then pour the other ingredients on. Other than that, a fantastic recipe! :)

Delicious, easy and lives up to the positive reviews.  My only change was to increase pecans to 2 cups.  Will definitely make again!

Awesome recipe!  I made for Thanksgiving, and everybody loved them.  I am not a fan of pecan pie - too sugary, too gooey, too rich - but the bars have the same flavor and are just right.  I used more like 3 cups of pecans - just coated the top until it looked thick and good.  Turned out really well, I'd recommend it - I can't imagine them with only 1 cup of pecans.

Great tasting bars. I ended up using about a cup and a half of pecans to cover the top better. These were very easy to make.

This was amazing. My father LOVED it and so did my brother, he wanted to bring an extra batch to work but...they ate them before he could bring them. I'm going to be making them for my family for many more occasions to come. The only thing I did different was to make home-made sugar syrup (i didn't have any dark corn syrup).
