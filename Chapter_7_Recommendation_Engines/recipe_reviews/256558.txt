Wife and I had high hopes. But this fell way short of carrot cake or any resemblance of carrot cake flavor. We shredded the carrots and fine diced the walnuts for better consistency. Didn’t help. Added a tbl of honey to make it bearable to eat

1.2.17  For my personal taste, this had waaaaaay too much cinnamon and ginger, and I will cut that at least in half next time; it just overpowered the flavor of the oatmeal.  You can always add more, if necessary, but you can’t take it out once it’s in there.  The other slight change I will make is not cooking the pineapple (don’t think it needs it), rather,  I’ll just stir it in at the end.  The pineapple color changes when cooked, and distracts just a little from the eye appeal (not a BIG deal here, just personal preference, and it doesn’t affect the taste).  I had my doubt about the combo of carrot and pineapple in oatmeal, but you’ll taste the sweet pineapple more...it works!
