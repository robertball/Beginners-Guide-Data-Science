This is a basic, traditional guacamole recipe with the additions of the ingredients I enjoy and the omission of those I don't.  I cut the amounts of jalapeno and cilantro in half simply to suit our personal tastes and used yellow onions rather than the green. I wouldn't hesitate to refer to this recipe again.

Yummy! This was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of flavor - nothing artificial, no jarred salas or other oddities to make it some sort of "creation". I cut the recipe in half to give it a try. I de-seeded the tomatoes, used one jalapeno, a few pinches of kosher salt, opted out of the black pepper and added a little more than 1/4 tsp. of cumin - it went great with warm tortilla chips and ice cold margaritas!

This recipe is very much like my favorite Guacamole. The only change I make (for 8 avocados) I use 3 TBS finely minced red onions instead of green onions.  I like the coarse texture of the "mashed" avocado so I use a large fork rather than a small one.  If I'm making a large amount for a party I strain the juice from a couple of fresh lemons, put it in a spray bottle and lightly spray the interior of my bowl and the top surface of the piled on Guacamole. I have found that if you get too much lemon IN the Guacamole it changes the whole flavor, makes it taste lile "store bought".

Spicy and fresh - this will be my go-to guacamole recipe from now on.  All the flavors in this recipe were perfectly proportioned for our tastes.

Love this !!!!! I already made my guacamole the exact same way. The only difference is I don't measure my ingredients, I eyeball them & taste as I go, that's how my abuelo made his famous salsa, so that's how make my guac! These ingredients are all you need!

Everything I love in my guacamole! I reduced the recipe to use 2 avocados & it made a huge portion- I think using 8 would feed a big group. I like more garlic & think next time I would use 1 more avocado per reduced portions of everything else. Yummy!

The first time I made this, I wussed out and used less limes, jalapenos, and salt/pepper than called for. It was alright but lacking a punch. The next day I repeated exactly as written and it was bangin! I don't like a mouthful of hot but this had a great amount of flavor without being overdone. Fresh cilantro is not to be overlooked, in my opinion.

My 10 year old Son suggested we make fresh Guac for game night. He had never tried it before but wanted to. We went shopping for everything and prepared it together. We halved the amounts of all the ingredients, except we  used about a quarter of the amount of cilantro. (Not my favorite- too much gets overpowering) It came out so good! By halfing the ingredients, it made plenty for 4 people. This is the first recipe my Son and I made together, but it really awakened his inner chef! He loved helping me chop everything up. I'm sure this guac will be on our new game night tradition!

02.06.17 ~ I made a scaled back version of this to go with our Mexican meal.  Loved it!  It had just the right amount of heat and thickness.  We like a chunkier guacamole, and this fit the bill, perfectly.

Guacamole perfection!  I didn't add tomatoes because hubby doesn't like them and it was still very delicious.  I will never use a seasoning mix again.

Made this twice already. Three fourths into my Whole30 I needed something to garnish my fajitas. This recipe nailed it! I put it on everything. Salads, baked potato chips and of course the fajitas. Itâ€™s food like this that keeps me on track. Yummy.

This was a very good guacamole recipe.  I added red onions instead of green onions.  I will make again.

I so cheated when I made my guacamole. There are only two of us so I used only two avocado's. I mashed the avo's with a fork and added a few teaspoons of finely chopped onion, about a 1/4 of teaspoon of garlic and a fresh 1/2 lime squeezed in. The best part was I also added a few teaspoons of salsa sauce. It's really a season to taste type of a dish.  A little more of this, a little less of that depending on what you like.  Always tastes great.  Enjoy!

Love it! Only difference is I don't add pepper and I use pickled jalapenos. It's perfect. Love the green onions. Only way to go.

Someone else brought the guacamole  to the super bowl party so I made this tonight to kill leftovers. I cut the recipe in half except the tomatoes and I was out of green onions so I used half a red onion.  Pretty simple , extremely good. Some times simple is better...this is one of those times.

Great guacamole. I left out the jalapeno and used about a teaspoon of jalapeno hot sauce instead. It seemed to be too much lime for me, so I didn't use the whole amount, but my limes were rather big. I liked the green onion in this instead of the typical red onion. My nephew, who happened to be over at the time, started eating this and loved it.

Iâ€™ve made this 4 or 5 times itâ€™s so good everyone loves it!  I have a Cuisanart food chopper and it makes it so much easier.  Iâ€™ve decided I like red onions better than green.  The thing Iâ€™ve learned is to keep tasting it and add more as needed.  For example start with half of the cilantro, garlic, onion etc., taste it and add more to your liking!  I tend to use less cilantro more onion and garlic!  Buy a food chopper it makes a big difference!

this was great!  I did add feta cheese on top just because my husband likes it that way.  It was gone in no time!

Using fresh ingredients  is  important.  I used diced red onion instead of green onion.  For presentation I  added some grated Oaxaca  cheese on the top.  Delicious.

I used regular onion instead of green and added lemon with the lime.

One of the best Guacamole recipes I have  made so far. I use little less  jalapenos  because of the kids, and omit the tomatoes, because we  like our guacamole without them. Also, I always add little bit of cumin, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon, to my guacamole. It adds a note of smokiness to it..

This is very close to my guac recipe and as good as it gets!  (I use chopped yellow onions instead of green)Try mashing the avocados with a potato masher.  It's quicker and mixes the guacamole faster than a fork.
