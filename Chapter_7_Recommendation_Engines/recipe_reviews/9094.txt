I was very impressed with this recipe. It made a good side dish using frozen corn, and I loved that it used corn meal instead of wheat flour, which added another layer of flavor and possibly made it gluten free. I did not add the crushed tortilla chips, as I felt it didn’t need it, but I did add some chili powder. You could easily turn up the spice level by using poblano peppers instead of bell peppers. I’ll definitely keep this one in mind for brunches too.
