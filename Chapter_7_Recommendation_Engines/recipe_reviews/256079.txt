I must admit I was very hesitant about adding all the cinnamon called for in this recipe, but it's not too much at all. These are dark chocolate truffles, so you need to know that you like semisweet, dark chocolate before making them. I used pecans for the coating because I was out of walnuts, and they turned out fine. This would make a nice hostess gift or addition to a mini dessert tray.

Made a batch of these as a gift for some friends, and they were a hit! Flavour was wonderful- I used toasted ground almonds for the coating instead of walnuts because it's what I happened to have on hand. I also added 2 or 3 tablespoons more cream than the recipe stated because it looked like the chocolate was starting to seize when I added the cream cheese, but followed all the other directions as given. These looked beautiful and tasted fantastic. I'll definitely hold on to this recipe!
