My husband had been nagging for a while for me to make a lentil casserole like his mom used to make. I found this super easy recipe, and he loved it! fantastic hit! He even liked it better than mom's! (Sorry mom!) So yummy and easy. I just added more broth than listed... full 15oz can

Great recipe! I made this with brown rice and it was fabulous. The brown rice made it a very hearty meal. I added a bit more salt and used HOT italian sausage and browned it thoroughly before adding the rest of the ingredients. It took a bit longer, but I am sure it added to the overall flavor of the dish. I like flavorful food and I found this one very good!

This is a very basic meal. Don't expect a wow of flavor but rather a warm simple, wholesome tasting meal. I halved the recipe and my 3 year old and I finished it at one sitting. I used 2 large links of mild italian turkey sausage and took the meat out of the casing. Browned the meat in a 2 quart pot, removed, and then added the onion and some chopped celery. Then soon added the broth and a splash of water, brown rice (healthier and takes just as long to cook as the lentils) and lentils. Brought to a boil, then set to low for 40 min. Added the sausage back into the mix a few minutes before the lentils were done. My son gobbled this up.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe which was a hit with my family and will become one of our regular meals.  Instead of water, I used vegetable stock.  I also added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp Italina sesaonings.  Sometimes I add spinach, mushrooms, or other veggies on hand.  I've taken it as a side dish and have even made it for mom's with newborns.  Thank you for the inspiration.

This was FANTASTIC!  It had a great flavor and the entire family loved it.  Best of all, it is so easy to prepare.  I changed this a bit according to ingredients on hand.  I used chicken and sun-dried tomato sausage, omitted the bell peppers, and added more rice, lentils, and chicken broth.  I used 3/4 cup each rice and lentils.

Flavorful, simple, filling, and nutritious. I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could. I needed to cook it longer than an hour and had to add a little extra liquid before the lentils were done. I think next time I make it I'll use brown rice (to more closely match the cooking time of the lentils) and extra liquid, and either bake it or use the slow cooker. I think either of those methods would be better for this type of recipe. We really liked it, very tasty.

Made the mistake of thinking it'd be okay to use brown basmati since the cooking time is so long. Well, 70 minutes on the stove and only some of the rice was fully cooked. Most was partially done, but luckily the dish was still edible. The flavor was overpowering for me, but my two companions loved it. Next time I think I'll use low-sodium broth or cut regular broth with water, and I'll serve this over rice instead of including rice in the casserole. I will make this again, though, it was really fast and easy.

I was leary about this recipe because that's a lot of Italian sausage for four people in this household- we like it, just not LOTS of it.  So, I upped the rice, lentils and broth and also added some barley (probably one third cup).  It made it less meaty and increased the servings to probably seven or eight.  I also added four cloves of garlic.  The sausage I used was spicy and it added a ton of flavor.  This is very hearty and delicious- definitely agree with all who call it comfort food- it has that feel for sure.  Thanks for the recipe, Jill- I will make this again and again.  My kids said it's awesome.

Very good base recipe. With some extra veggies and seasonings it is easily a five-star recipe. The cooking time is off though. I used arborio rice which only requires 17 minutes to cook. My lentils, French Puy, need the whole 40 minutes, so next time I will add the rice after the lentils have stewed for about 20 minutes.  Thank you Jill for your recipe.

Strangely, I found this dish simultaneously bland and too salty.  Also, the recipe said to use dry lentils, but I soaked mine overnight and they were still hard and undercooked; I don't know but perhaps I used the wrong type of lentils?  All in all, this was a fairly hearty and filling meal but I don't think I would make it again.

Maybe because I omitted the sausage(husband vegetarian) that it was bland to me.  I followed the suggestion of other reviews and cooked the lentil seperate adding them at the end.  I used green peppers, onions but added carrots and I used a par-boil rice. It was an okay dish but at the end the taste was a bit washed out to me so I seasoned it with salt, pepper, thyme and paparika. Otherwise it is a good base for a lentil and rice recipe.

Simple ingredients and with spicy sausage, it packed a super kick on a cold night. I must have done something wrong though as my rice & lentils were mushy :/ The flavors were so good though that it was eaten anyway but I will have to make another go around on this one.

Very yummy and wholesome meal that you can feel good about serving to your family.  Only glitch was that at 40 minutes, the lentils still had a bite to them but the rice was perfectly done and the liquid was cooked out.  I wasn't sure if I should add liquid to continue cooking, and the crunch wasn't too crunchy, so we ate it like that.  My 5yo had two servings!  The 4yo didn't care for it, but he's one that the food must be visually appealing and this wasn't so much.  Only changes I made were to use a half lb of sausage instead of 1lb, and substituted celery for the bell pepper.  Will definitely make again but tweak the liquid/cooking time.  Oh, and bonus points for only requiring one cooking pot!

I was very pleased and pleasantly surprised at how great this turned out.  My 3 year old ate it up and the hubby liked it too.  It was super easy, great for a mid-week meal.  I made a couple of tweaks - I didn't have any bell peppers on hand, so I used a jalapeno.  I also threw in some vermicelli, paprika, and a few other seasonings.  I had to use some cauliflower and celery before it went bad, so in those went too.  I think a variety of other veggies would work well with this dish too.  Definitely adding this into the regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is as many say, basic and homey. But with the HOT pork sausage it is kickin! My husband and I have eaten this several times in the last few months, each time customizing it to whatever veggies we have available... We add just a little less than 1/2 c. rice, and just a little over 1/2 c. lentils. What a great way to add lentils to the diet, while still enjoying a hearty and tasty meal.

this actually tasted way better than i was expecting! my husband who doesn't like brown rice or lentils, raved over it. even my two small kids ate it up! i simmered it for a little over an hour since when i had checked it at 40 min. the lentils were still a bit crunchy, but other than that, i followed the recipe exactly. it's not the prettiest looking dish i've ever made but i found it flavorful and healthy, a great combination!

Love this dish! Used brown rice, hot Italian chicken sausage. Took 60 minutes to cook. Instructions and serving size are right on. Did not have bell peppers, added some chopped red cabbage in last 5 minutes to boost nutritional value. Will make again.

This was very easy to make, hearty and with a very comforting taste.  My husband and my children also loved it.  The kids, who always pick the green pepper and onion out of anything I make, didn't even say anything about them in this thing.  They just ate them!  I used a mix of long-grain and wild rice, added some herbs and paprika for a bit of extra flavor, and had to add quite a bit more water than called for, but it cooked in about 45 minutes.

This is a perfect recipe for a Rice Cooker!!!!  I cooked the rice and lentils together in my rice cooker w/ a pinch of cardamom. Cooked the sausage, green peppers and used mushrooms instead of onions-don't like them. Combined when rice/lentil ready....My family LOVED it!!!!  This has added to my recipe box!

Overall a decent dish, very easy to make.  The one thing I noticed is that it was too salty for me, probably from the italian sausage.  Maybe next time I will try a turkey sausage or something with less salt.  I used low sodium chicken broth.  A good, inexpensive meal.  If you do not like onions you can omit, or reduce the amount.

Used  HOT chicken sausage and cubanelle peppers diced with some green chilis and it was absolutely THE BEST !!!!!  Also doubled the lentils and brown rice which necessitated a little more broth, but at least that way had another meal out of it.   We put salsa on top of it and it was really great.  THANKS for a superb healthy recipe!!!

Followed Jennifer 2008 comments but added apple chicken sausage. Sauteed the onions and bell pepper first then added everything.  I ran out of rice and used the lentils solo to suffice.  It was a hearty meal with a fresh baked baguette ( a nice crunchy crust and soft not chewy inside). No leftovers! The preschoolers ate all of theirs.

I think this was a great starting point.  I added some garlic, and added the rice 10 minutes after the lentils.  When there was about 15 minutes left I added a can of tomatoes, and mushrooms.  I used two cans of broth and seasoned with rosemary, and italian seasoning.  Wonderful.

We loved it!  My husband and I and our two young kids really enjoyed it.  I used Johnsonville mild Italian sausage (removed from casing) and water with a chicken bouillon cube since I didn't have chicken broth.  I added some extra water and used brown rice.  I also used red/yellow/orange peppers since I didn't have green.  Cooked for about an hour and it came out great.  Thanks!

This was a very tasty dish. Simple and easy and pretty healthy for you.  One tip:  when you drain meat after browning it, if you rince it with water you can drain off up to half the fat.  One change, I would use an entire can of chicken broth

Very good! I left out the sausage and used water instead of broth (just because I didn't have the time to defrost the broth). I already had onions and peppers sauteed so I just threw them in at the end. This was a super easy meal and reheated well. I will be making this again!

This meal was great!  I'm trying to eat healthier and this recipe will definitely be made again.  I used italian turkey sausage and brown rice.  Even my husband, who never eats anything healthy,  liked this.

Great, quick recipe that my husband loved. I didn't have the lentils, but used barley in a pinch. Next time I'm using the lentils since I know that will be even better. I threw in some steamed veggies at the end to make a one pan kind of meal. I also used very spicy sausage which was a hit.

I made a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of sausage I used soy pepperoni, water intead of broth. I added everything in the pot and cooked. Well I should have cooked the rice seperately like some others have suggested. I used brown rice and it takes awhile to cook. Red lentils cook quickly so needless to say the lentils were mush and the rice was still crunchy. In the end I burned the bottom of the pot... I thought it was a huge disaster, but it ended up tasting good. Not sure if I will make it again but if I do I will cook the rice seperatly!

I made this, and decided it needed tomato for flavor because it was rather bland.  The tomato didn't help.  The sausage is not really a welcome addition either.  Lentils didn't seem to go well with sausage.

Yummy and easy one pot dinner.  I added 4 large minced garlic cloves,  1 diced celery stalk and 1 carrot to the green pepper and onions. Also, i used reduced sodium soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and parmesan cheese for flavor since i had no chicken stock.  My lentils were just under cooked. Next time, i think I'll add to the pot with the veggies at the beginning. My rice was a tad overcooked because of the lentils.
This is not something to serve guests because it looks like mush but, the flavor is great. We loved it. I served it with buttered rolls. But this would be great stuffed into acorn squash, too.

Read the other reviews and followed a few suggestions.  Checked on the dish and it was done in 20 minutes.  Turned out great...  Had some leftover ham and a small amount of sausage... I make my own chicken broth (stored in freezer) with a little bit of chicken in it...  it will take almost any meat and veggie you want to add...  great basic recipe.

Quickish, easy and relatively healthy. I followed others suggestions to increase liquid and added some jalapeno stuffed green olives just for fun. Will make again.

It came out way too mushy for our taste.  The sausage with the rice and lentils all mushed together.

Tried this tonight with great reviews.  My picky son even loved it.  I think the key to this recipe is the sausage:  picking one that's heavily seasoned/flavored is a must, otherwise the casserole will taste bland.  The only thing I did differently was to use 2/3 of a pound of boudin sausage (removed the casing before cooking) because that's what I had on hand.  It didn't look too appetizing, but it was filling, wonderful taste, and healthy.  I like that I was able to make this in one pot, but I can see that it would look a little better if the rice was served separately, using the casserole as a topping. But either way, the best use of lentils so far!

Yum!!   I used brown rice, but that took longer to cook.   Might pre-cook that a bit before adding.  Otherwise, great flavor, so easy to make.

I doubled the chicken broth and it came out good.  It needed the extra broth if you use brown rice.  My family who doesn't like beans/lentils, ate it!

for its versatility! i added garlic, roasted red peppers, corn, and sub'ed barley for the rice. subed ham and bacon for the italian sausage too.  YUM and hubby & kids approved! :)  my broth is seasoned, otherwise i'd say it would be a little to plain (if using store-bought broth)... TFS this, Jill! :)

I had some lentils cooked & needed to find some way to use them.  I searched here & came across this recipe.  Because they were already cooked, I cut back to 1 cup of broth.  Turned out to be better than I expected.  Figure next time I can add celery, zuchini &/or okra.

I was really excited about the idea of this dish, but it turned out really bland. I'll eat it because I love lentils, but my husband opted for a frozen TV dinner instead. I may try making it again with some hot sauce or something. I also went through an entire carton of chicken broth and ended up cooking it for a couple hours.

This was a nice recipe. I only had two Italian sausage links left over in the fridge so I cut those into pieces and threw that in. The meal turned out pretty good and my husband really liked it. I took another reviewers advise and added water to the pot even tho I had already used the chicken broth. I also needed to added extra seasoning to it too. If I ever did this again I'd have to omit the meat because we're trying a vegetarian diet.

Two words - add water. This was really good otherwise except it was bland. I think we will add some spices to the dish at the same time we add the water.

Outstanding one-dish meal. My husband LOVED it and practically licked his plate. He even packaged up the leftovers for his lunch. I used 6 Italian sausages cut up into pieces. Thank you Jill - this will become a regular meal at our house!

Tastes very good, but I would cook the rice seperately and serve the mixture over it.  The presentation wasn't too appetizing.
