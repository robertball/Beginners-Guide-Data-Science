Skip the gym today and break out your heaviest pestle and mortar folks. You gotta try this. The fragrant smell of toasty sesame seeds and the spicy peppers will have your mouth watering. It takes some effort, but it is definitely worth it. Add to anything for a twist in flavor. Thank you for the recipe.
