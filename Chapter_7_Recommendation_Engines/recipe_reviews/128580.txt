These are the best and SO simple to make as the recipe is written!  But for my family's personal preference, I increased the brown sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each, added a teaspoon of vanilla, increased the butterscotch to 1 1/2 packages as my family likes more of the carmelized syrup.  I also sprinkle the cinnamon in the bottom of the bundt pan, then the pecans, rolls, butterscotch and lastly the sugar and butter mixture and another sprinkle of cinnamon.  Just to experiment, I rolled each "ball" in the butterscotch mixture and it didn't seem to make a difference after it was finished baking versus pouring it over the top as the recipe is written.  Let it sit overnight in the oven, set the timebake and walla it's ready to go the next morning.  What could be better than waking up to the smell of these rolls!  Thanks so much Jen for submitting this recipe!  This is definitely a keeper!!!

I needed something quick to take to our church monthly breakfast. These are awesome! I only had frozen dinner rolls in the freezer so they were already in balls.  They thawed very quickly, so that saved a lot of time.  Next, I added about a 1/2-3/4 cup of heavy whipping cream (I was cleaning out the frig) to the melted butter and brown sugar mixture, cooked on low until the sugar was dissolved. Poured over the rolls with pudding/cinnamon and then everything else the same! Cooked for approx 40 minutes. This is a keeper and I will definetly use it again!  Thanks Jen for posting!

I love this recipe and have used it and lost it over and over again over the years, so am so glad to find it again.  I remember rolling each piece of bread dough in the dry pudding/cinnamon mixture before placing them into the pan, then pouring the butter mixture over the entire thing.  It guarantees gooey goodness on every single piece!

We have been making a recipe just like this for years and LOVE them! The only thing we do different is use frozen bread rolls (12 of them... Rhoades sells them in a bag), plus, we pour 1/2 cup heavy cream over them right before baking in the morning to make more of a butterscotch sauce when inverted...SOOOO good! These will always be my favorite "special" breakfast!

The flavor was good on these and I liked the extra something that the butterscotch pudding option gave. The bread was as expected of any roll made from frozen bread dough. My issue with these was temperature related. As Jen said, be careful when hot as they will burn you badly if you try to eat them. The problem is that once they get cool enough to eat, the 'sticky' sauce starts to get hard and is no longer sticky or gooey. By the time they are cool enough to just grab with your fingers and eat, the caramel part is the consistency of taffy and way to hard to be enjoyable. I may try them again, but possibly add a bit of cream or milk or even more butter to 'thin-down' the caramel sauce. I won't make them again as listed though. (It took hours to soak the sauce out of the pan they were baked in.)

Very easy to make and really good!  I used an 8 or 9 inch round pan, non-stick.  I don't have a bundt pan!  OH, and I accidentally used instant butterscotch pudding, but it did not seem to make any difference in the final product!

Wow!  Easy and great!  Couldn't find cook and serve butterscotch pudding, so used a 3 ounce package of cook and serve vanilla pudding instead.  Turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was just going over my recipe and noticed it says to refrigerate the rolls. I have never refrigerated the rolls and don't know why it's written that way. I don't recall writing that when I submitted the recipe! Anyway, do not refrigerate the rolls; allow them to raise overnight on your counter. Also, I'm glad y'all love these as much as my family does^_^

This is a PHENOMENAL recipe. I made a few changes: I used frozen individual roles, opposed to a loaf that I had to cut up, I used chopped macadamia nuts instead of pecans (not a huge pecan fan) and I added 1 tsp of real vanilla extract to the sugar/butter mixture. The higher you let the dough rise, the lighter the finished product is. If you prefer a denser end result, do not let rise as long.  I now get requests to make this for every holiday/birthday breakfast!

Great breakfast rolls or perfect for a sweet treat. My 3 yr old step son loved helping me roll the dough and even asked the next day if we could have them again.

So good, somone had made these for us before and I was searching for the recipe on this site.  I found this one, which is a little different from the one we had had before.  Point is, these are AMAZING, so good.  Made them exactly as is.  My husband was worried as he is not a fan of the butterscotch pudding, but you can't even tell that is what is in there.   So great, we will definatley make these again :)

Sinfully Delicious and easy! The only thing I changed was to put a little extra butter and some extra cinnamon and pudding mix on the bottom of the pan. Let it sit in the fridge overnight, popped them in when I woke up in the morning. Total hit at my brunch I had, these are deff. a must try!!!!!

I actually messed up and bought the precooked frozen dinner rolls, Sister Schubert's. Otherwise I followed the recipe, only skipping the dough work, and using a 9x9. I would still give it 5 stars even with my errors! About 3 minutes of prep time, and I only cooked it for 20-25 min with these rolls, and gooey deliciousness! Next time I'll try the right way, but I dig the speedy perks of the wrong way.

This recipe is fantastic! Great for the holidays or when you need something that can be made ahead of time for the next morning. Rather than full bread dough, look for pre-formed dough for rolls in the freezer section. The dough balls are perfect size and ready to put in the pan.

Really Yummy!  I have been making for years.  I use small pkg frozen roll dough balls (no need to thaw) instead of bread.  Be sure to cook butter and brown sugar until it just starts to bubble.

delicious! i omitted the nuts, used instant fat free butterscotch pudding mix and i used stone ground whole wheat bread and you couldn't tell! i only cut my bread into 8 pieces (16 just seemed like they'd be so tiny) glad i did and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon in the bottom of a square 9x9 and it worked perfect. my bread didn't rise overnight and i took it out in the morning for about 1 1/2 hrs and still nothing so i just baked anyways and they still rose big and fluffy. when i took out of the oven i used a basting brush and brushed the ooey gooiness in the pan over the tops. like someone else complained they aren't ooey gooey after they cool but the flavor is still just as delicious! cant' wait to make again next weekend!

These were awesome. I'm not sure what the pudding mix adds but they were great! I prepped them the night before, pulled them out to come to room temp and then cooked them off in the morning. Very good and really pretty easy.

Oh my! This was wonderful! I was afraid as it resembles Monkey Bread and that always turned out mushy and undercooked for me. This was incredible! I made this Christmas morning and it reminded me of the wonderful little sticky buns our club serves and everyone loves! Thank you! My husband says this is his new favorite!!

Super delicious! I was a little worried at first, because my dough did not really rise overnight in the fridge. I used little frozen dinner rolls, so I am assuming the type/brand I bought had something to do with it... Well, they finished rising in the oven! Plumped up perfectly and were nice and ooey gooey! Very easy! Will be making these again and again!

I've made these a few times and they are wonderful.  I follOwed the recipe as is and the results are perfect.  I did however bake them in 2 8" cake pans, with the intention of sharing them, that didn't happen! I tried doubling the dough amount without increasing the rest of the ingredients, didn't work out well. It looked pretty but was no way near as yummy.

So simple and delicious!  I used a square pyrex dish to bake them, then inverted them into an identical dish.  Then I spread cream cheese icing over them and let it melt all over them.  Awesome recipe!  Next I'll be trying the cream trick mentioned in other reviews.  And maybe some orange flavour in my icing.  Yummmmm.

I poured about 1/2 or so of milk on top when ready to cook. That kept the carmel from getting hard.  It was DEVINE!

These are FANTASTIC!! I followed the recipe for the rolls exactly a written. But instead of making the icing I used store bought buttercream frosting. My whole family said that they are the BEST cinnamon rolls they have ever eaten.

This is our Christmas morning tradition; however, I use 25 oz. frozen rolls instead of cutting up dough.  It rises overnight and is ready for the oven first thing in the morning.

Sooo good.  I would have liked had the directions explained that the butter and brown sugar need to be mixed together really well... I am guessing that this would have prevented the rolls from being a little gritty... but maybe they'd be gritty either way. Still, I'll definitely make it again.

this recipe is awesome! incredibly easy, & my husband loved them. didn't have a bundt pan so used a round cake pan & it worked just fine. Also took some others' advice & added vanilla to the butter mixture. Did the prep last night, let them rise in the fridge overnight, popped them in the oven when we got up & 25 mins later...YUM!

OMG these were divine. I followed the recipe exactly except I used walnuts instead of pecans bc that is what I had on hand. These were so delicious and the presentation was very impressive. Will add this to the regular rotation.

These are delicious.  I have made them for years. Mine is just a bit different.  Using 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and 1 Tablespoon of Brown.  I also only use 1/2 pkg. of the pudding.  It is perfect every time.

Made the night before and put in the refrigerator. Even on the warmest setting, the fridge is still uber cold, so the dough didn't rise much at all overnight. I let them sit out for 30 minutes and then put them in the oven at the 150 for another 15 mintues before baking them (they rose pretty well this way). Despite this setback, they turned out to be delicious. Bit hit!

After reading many reviews, I changed a few things. I used 12 frozen rolls in a 9 inch cake pan. I only had vanilla pudding, so I used that, and I added a half cup heavy cream, right before baking. Also, I skipped the nuts. These were so good I've made them two days in a row!

Fantastic recipe! I didn't have frozen bread, so I made fresh dough using the Amish White Bread recipe.  I also added 1/2 cup heavy crea, to the butter and brown sugar mixture and the sauce was lovely, creamy and didn't harden.  I'll be making these again!

Delicious! They turned out great. Instead of sprinkling the ingredients over the top of the rolls I dipped them in the butter and rolled them around in the dry ingredients. With the left over ingredients I poured them over the rolls. This way the rolls were completely covered in the carmel, and there wasn't a powdery residue. My family makes this all the time and absolutely loves it.

Make this for Christmas every year! We call them sticky buns! I use vanilla cook n serve pudding and Rhodes rolls. No need to roll them! Just cooking spray your 13x9, layer the pecans, (I chop some and leave some halved) then rolls and pour glaze over! Cover with aluminum foil (which I also spray with cooking spray), pop in oven till morning, remove foil, bake and voila perfect!

I used vanilla pudding  instead of butterscotch, halved dinner rolls instead of using a loaf and drizzled 1/4 cup of milk on the buns right before baking to keep the sauce from over hardening. Perfection, will definitely make again!

I do the same thing, using bread dough,(1 lb loafs) but with a couple changes. I mix cinnamon and white sugar, enough to cover the bottom of a plate. Then I melt some butter. After I divide dough, into as many as you choose, typically a doz (but I have made little bite size ones too that work great as a platter on mini cupcake wrappers) I dip the dough in butter, then in cin/sugar. If you want nuts or raisins, place that in the bottom of your pan, then after dipping in butter and rolling in sugar, place in pan. Leave a small space between buns. Once I am done, I mix 1/2 parts caramel ice cream topping to 1/2 maple syrup, and pour any remaining butter into that as well. Pour overtop, allowing the liquid to get into all the spaces. Bake 30-35 minutes. This is so easy and You don't even need to measure. I just make sure the liquid covers the buns. (about a cup total, but like I said, I don't really measure) So if you like a lot of goo, add more.

I used 12 frozen Rhodes rolls and added 1/2 cup of whipping cream before baking. This kept the caramel soft, even the next day! Yummy! Loved this recipe!

Made these for Easter.  I took the advice from reviews and used pre packaged frozen yeast rolls.  They didn’t rise overnight so I had to place the bunds pan in a warm spot for an hour before cooking to allow for the rise.  I also used the advice and poured some heavy whipping cream over the dish before placing in the oven.  I didn’t do much for fear of overdoing it.  Next time I will do more whipping cream as mine were really good, but didn’t produce a lot of the glaze that everyone loves.  Possibly due to the fact I used about 20 rolls...which may be more than the loaf rolls produce.   I also rolled each of my rolls into a cinnamon sugar mix before placing them in the bundt pan.   Wonderful make ahead recipe that is sure to please.

My family and I loved these. The bread dough didn't roll out to the measurements listed but it worked fine. Some of my pieces were pretty small and I wasn't sure they would rise but they rose perfectly. The only downside is the next day, the caramel turned really hard and the rolls were hard and not that great. Right out of the oven they are perfect.

I made this just the way the recipe reads Except I used 3 12 oz cans (the big cans not small ones) of buttermilk biscuits cut in quarters. It was Excellent!!! Everyone loved it and it was good as leftovers warmed in the microwave.

I wasn't sure what was meant by "frozen bread dough" so I used a package of grands biscuits and skipped the covering overnight part. I also use chopped pecans at the bottom instead of whole ones, which I think was more manageable. The butterscotch pudding seemed odd but it totally works! I made it for a few adults and a few kids visiting for the weekend and it was gone about 5 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

Second time making these and they are incredibly easy and fabulous!   I used 18 Rhodes frozen Texas dinner rolls in a buttered tube pan. and let it rise overnight on the kitchen counter. This time, however, I  used Vanilla pudding mix and melted butter with brown sugar plus 2 T. bourbon. I increased to  1 C. chopped pecans and lots of Cinnamon.  Got rave reviews.! This is a keeper.

It tasted great! I thought that the presentation wasn't as good, though, so next time, I think I'll just make it in a square pan. I let my frozen bread dough thaw on the counter overnight and then divided it into pieces in the morning. I let it sit about 30mins to rise as the oven heated up. Perfect!

I really wanted to love this.. But it just wasn't great. I followed the directions and it turned out, but to me it wasn't aesthetically pleasing.. It looked like someone puked on some monkey bread. I will stick to my tried and true monkey bread.

This has the potential to be a really delicious dessert, but mine is not there yet. The recipe did not provide enough topping for me, so I keep increasing the quantities. Also make sure you use light brown sugar for a better result.

I made this recipe as listed and it was good, but I would have liked smaller pieces of bread dough so that the flavours were a bit more balanced. If I make it again I will cut each frozen roll in half.

Wow. These rolls are really fantastic. I thought I was putting too much pudding mix on by sprinkling the whole box on the dough, but it turned out perfectly. As long as you plan ahead, these rolls take almost no effort. DELICIOUS.

I have been making this recipe for years.  Only difference is that I use a large box of vanilla cook & serve pudding in place of the butterscotch pudding.  This is so easy, and so yummy!  Glad to find it on here to easily refer friends to this site for the recipe.  Thanks!
