We Just Love scones and oatmeal always adds nice flavour.  Especially nice these fall days ahead.  A hot pot of tea along with it sounds just right.(Or Coffee if you favor, :O)

Wonderful recipe! Definately will make this again. The taste and texture was excellent and very easy. The only thing I did different was I used self rising flour and omited the baking powder and I patted the dough into a 7" round circle and cut into 8 wedges. Very Very good :)

Excellent.  Very tasty, moist and delicious.  Easy to put together. There is one glitch in the recipe.  In the directions section combining ingredients, it reads ...1/4 cup sugar, that should read 1/2 cup.  Otherwise you end up with a 1/4 cup left over. Also, I found it impossible to get them all on one sheet, I needed two.

I have made these scones many times over the last several years.  The only time they didn't turn out well was when I tried to make them as mini scones, freezing them to bake later.  However, that is my fault, not the recipes.  One note though- several reviewers have referred to these scones as healthy.  Look at the nutrition information:  Scones are basically sweetened biscuits.  If you make 12 scones as the recipe indicates, each contains 292 calories and 12.8 grams of fat.  These are wonderful for an occasional treat;  they are not health food.

I am not a very good pastry cook, but these came out wonderful.  I used a metal potato masher to mix the butter with the dry ingredients and it worked pretty well.  I also added a little vanilla to the glaze... I love vanilla.

these were very tasty, plus felt a little healthier/heartier because they contain oatmeal. I will make these again.

Didn't use the glaze, and they turned out really good.  We love scones, and if you have never made them...they are a really quick and easy weekend morning treat for the family.  My kids loved these and I never feel bad about also giving them to them for a treat because they aren't filled with lots of sugar and they are filling and good with a glass of milk.

Great texture and nice flavor.  I cut into wedges like another reviewer, and 10 made nice serving sizes; 8 were really huge.  Next time, though, I'm going to try adding some light brown sugar to the pecan mixture.

This recipe is a great, healthier alternative to my favorite scone recipe that calls for sour cream, eggs, and butter!  I use egg substitute or egg whites and margarine to reduce cholesterol in this recipe and use raw sugar instead of refined.  I reduce the salt to 1/8 t. but add the grated zest of one orange or a few drops of orange oil to compensate.  With a drizzle sugar glaze, my husband doesn't even notice the reduced sugar content in this scone.

These weren't the best scones I've had but they were really easy to make, and they were good. I'll probably make them again.

These were really great! My mom doesn't really like scones, but she loved these. The pecans added a lot of flavor, and I am not a big fan of nuts, but I wouldn't leave the pecans out.

Lots of compliments. I missed the 1/2 vs. 1/4 cup error in recipe and only used 1/4 cup sugar so I guess they could have been a little sweeter, but still yummy. Add a little more milk to batter if it seems a little dry after mixing. I will definitely be making these again.

These scones were AMAZING.  I made mine with whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead and i didn't have pecans, so i used raisins.  Everyone loved them!

This was absolutely the best scone recipe I've ever made or eaten.  I've made it at least 10 times so far - I follow the directions exactly using orange juice for the glaze.  They are just as good the 2nd day. My family loves them and they are much easier than cinnamon rolls.

These are very good.  I've made them twice - substituting almonds for the pecans and adding a 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the dough.  They're a little more moist than I usually like my scones, but they have a great flavor and the cinnamon swirl effect and the icing really make them look like something special!  Thank you for sending this recipe in!

These were super easy and super tasty!  They were very light and moist, and I loved the way the nuts and cinnamon swirled through the scone.  I made them for company and they loved it!  I felt like the hostess at some fancy bed and breakfast.

yum these are GOOD!!  They ar good nice and warm and they are the perfect scone not dry and not too sweet.  The oatmeal is perfect in them.  I usually get the oat scones from Starbucks ($$$) but I like these way better.

A wonderful, quick recipe. Usually have all ingredients in house, so it is very easy to make just before breakfast. Combine dry ingredients the night before and these can be in the oven in just 5 minutes w/o messing up the kitchen.

Very tasty, even without the nuts!  I added about a cup or 1-1/2 cups of peeled and chopped Golden Delicious Apple instead of the nuts, and oh my it was superb.  I forgot to make the icing, but it was still excellent.  I highly recommend trying it out.

I, personally, am not really a fan of pecans or scones, but DH LOVED these! I used triple sec instead of orange juice/milk for the glaze and came out great.  (also forgot to toss the pecans in cinnamon) - can't wait to do it the right way next time!

This recipe was very good--it made moist scones which my husband thought were the best he ever had. I'm rating it only 4 stars because while they were very good, they were more like a cookie or cinnamon roll than they were a scone.

Delicious and easy to make!  It was my first attempt at making scones and I was half expecting to have to pitch them - even when I inadvertantly forgot the baking powder and had to mix it in at the end (gulp!).  However, they turned out delicious - they had the dense texture of scones, with a hint of sweetness and nuts from the glaze and topping.  I will definitely make these again!

These are very good! I even forgot to put the 2T of sugar into the nut/cinnamon/sugar swirl and they were fine. I use oj in the glaze, and I have to use 2 cookie sheets - the recipe makes a lot!

Thought these were very good. I used chopped almonds, since I didn't have pecans, they worked great. I made icing with cinnamon, powdered sugar and vanilla creamer, was good ! Used a cast iron scone pan, I just got to bake then in, and it works great !! I'll make them again.

Tasty treat- yet make sure to stir the flour in ENOUGH, otherwise simply taste floury.  My dad loved them warm with some butter!

It was a very easy recipe! I used raisins instead of nuts. And only used about 1\2 of the icing. next time i will probably add a little more cinnamon mixture because a fair amount stuck to the raisins and there wasnt much left to swirl. Overall a very good, easy recipe i will be making again. Thanks Quakor!

I made these for my dad and the rest of my family for Father's Day...they were definitely a hit!  No one could stop eating them!  I would definitely make these again, they were extremely easy and pretty fast (just be sure to add 1/2 cup of sugar in the first part of the recipe instead of 1/4 cup like it says).

This recipe is excellent.  I made this for a tea we were having at work.  Everyone raved about these scones.  I'm not a scone lover but these were exceptional. I found them to be moist, unlike most scone recipes.  A Keeper :)
