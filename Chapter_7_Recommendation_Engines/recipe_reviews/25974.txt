I was disappointed with this recipe for several reasons.  I followed directions exactly, making no changes but it still came out rather dry and tough.  The strange thing is, I baked it for exactly 70 minutes, checked it for doneness, and then when I sliced into it, you could see that it was slighty undercooked.  Usually, that would make for a moister cake...but not this time.  The frosting/glaze was great, though (if you like brown-sugar candy, you'd like this!).  It did not have the texture I was looking for either.

While this is a pretty cake, and while the frosting is wonderful, the cake itself is dry, dry, dry.  'Nuff said.

This cake has become a favorite at our house.  Easy and proud to say it is a "scratch" cake.  My grandchildren love the glaze!

oh...my...goodness...this icing was to die for.  I did not make the cake because I had my own recipe, but the icing was so good.  I had so many compliments on the icing and how it really complimented the cake.  I will always make this icing for my pound cakes now!

Good pound cake recipe.  I didn't have maple extract so used vanilla.  The cake had a good texture and flavor.  The glaze on top was really great.  We served with strawberries and whipped cream.

This exact recipe appeared in a magazine I saw last month-I believe it was Southern Cooking or something like it...anyway I wrote it down and made it the same day and it was fabulous. I gave some to all of my "cooking friends" and everyone was VERY pleased. The frosting is great, although I thought the recipe made way too much of it and I covered the cake like 3 times with it! I'd scale the frosting back by 1/3 but otherwise a great addition to my recipe box.

I made this cake without eggs--children are allergic.  It came out moist and great.  The icing was also good.  I would definitely make this cake again.

This was favorite recipe during the Christmas Holidays.  It was easy to put together and had a firm, but tender texture.  The maple flavoring adds a delicious flavor and makes the house smell wonderful! I made several for serving and for gifts. Great anytime.

I was disappointed that the cake did not rise even a tiny bit, making it quite dense. It tasted good, but not nearly as good as the frosting.
