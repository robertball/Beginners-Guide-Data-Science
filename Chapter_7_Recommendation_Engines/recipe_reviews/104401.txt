This is apple pie brings to your senses and taste buds a surprisingly refreshing apple pie flavor with just a hint of sweetness. Not heavy like some apple pies can be. Even the little ones loved it. Perfect for picnics, or summertime pot lucks. It does take a bit more time to make but it is so worth it.

This pie turned out runny.  I think it was because of the oranges.  I suggest trying to add some flour in with the apple mixture to help thicken it up. The flavor wasn't that good to me either, but to each their own.
