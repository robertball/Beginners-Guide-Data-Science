Boy, my husband loved this! I added some celery and chicken base, cooked the potatoes in 6 cups of water and added 2 cups of skim milk in place of the last 2 cups of water right before I stirred in the rub noodles. Hubby ate three huge bowls full and wouldn't let me throw away the dab of soup left in the kettle; plans on eating it for lunch today. A good 'old school" potato soup and a definite winner. Thanks!

This is a terrific soup!  I used a combination of Yukon Gold and red skinned potatoes and probably used more potatoes than the recipe stated.  Also, as a reviewer suggested, I cooked my potatoes in a chicken broth.  In addition,I smashed some of the potatoes.  It was thick, rich and wonderful.  Will make it again!

Thanks

Pure comfort food! Went together in a snap. I added some minced parsely at the end for color.

This soup is amazingly simple for how great it tastes. I did tweak the formula a bit. I made a 4 serving pot of this soup and added about half a can of evaporated milk just after i put in the drop noodles. I also used more egg because the dough was too dry and added sage to the broth.

Fab!

I love this recipe. I have made it three times for my family. I usually use chicken broth and add chopped celery instead of celery salt.

Really good, I have made it twice already in a few weeks time.  I added 2 chicken boulloin cubes, carrots, and celery to give it a brothier taste.

I grew up on this soup.  My grandmother and my mother made it, and now I make it.  We never used a recipe, but this gets guaranteed results every time.  The ultimate comfort food!

My grandma, then my parents mad this but we called it Potatoes and Rivels. Fantastic comfort food, but we add bits of bacon, then we serve it with shredded cheese on top.....mmmmmm

Stop scrolling and start peeling potatoes, because HOLY HELL, YOU GUYS. This soup is to die for.

Exactly the same as my Ukrainian Baba used to make, you should never make this for people you only like. Save it for people you LOVE. 

Thank you so much for this recipe. 5 stars.
