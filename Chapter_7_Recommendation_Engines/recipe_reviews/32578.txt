Not our favorite.  Kiwi is such a beautiful fruit it was a shame to use it in this shake where it basically contributed nothing except an off taste, to water down the strawberry flavor and to cast a weird color to what would otherwise have been a pretty pink. It wasn't sweet enough either.  I added honey, which helped a little, but the taste was still off.  In desperation I threw in a banana.  Saved.

I scaled this down to a cup of everything. Good, though very wet. Next time, I'd cut the milk by half. I used Turkey Hill vanilla bean ice cream.

This tasted good, but had a slightly odd consistency for me. I will probably make this again, but I think I will freeze the fruit before blending to help thicken the shake.

Make this recipe even better by adding a delicious and nutricious protien blend called Complete. It not only has 17 different fruits and veggies it is filled with all whole food source nutrition that will balance out the food in this shake and make it a balanced meal. I also use rice milk instead of dairy and frozen bananas instead of icecream (it really is good and more satisfying). Check out my website at Welcometojuiceplus.com.

One reviewer counsels against using whipped cream. There is none in this recipe that I can see. Please reread the ingredient list.

part of the reason we did not like this recipe is because we used cookie dough instead of vanilla ice cream.

Love the tartness that the kiwi adds to this.  I scaled this down to only serve 4 and only had about 1 cup of ice cream left in the carton, so I also added 1 carton of strawberry yogurt to make up for it.  Kids drank it down in no time.  Great for when the kiwis are in season and cheap at the store.  Thanks!

This was ok, but felt it could have been sweeter.  The texture of the seeds kind of put me off as well.  My hubby reckoned it would be a winner if the kiwifruit was subbed out for banana.
