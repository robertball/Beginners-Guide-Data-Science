Absolutely delicious! For anyone who has a Trader Joe's nearby, they offer fully cooked, peeled, fresh beets in the produce department which streamlined the process incredibly!

*Loved* the combo of flavors and textures! A definite keeper; thanks, Megancake!

This is the salad I pull out when I really want to impress.   It's rich, impressive, and delicious.   I put together everything but the beet slices and the dressing, then add those immediately before serving and toss again.  Adding the warm beets melts the cheese and just slightly wilts the salad, which is great!

Very nice! I substituted the goat cheese for light feta (lower in fat), and used olive oil instead. I also substituted the pistachios for roasted almonds. The combination of the flavours = YUM

I omitted the greens as I knew there were green salads being bought to the party that would be eaten along side the salad. I toasted pine nuts instead of using pistachios and used olive oil, balsamic and a little sweet rice wine vinegar for the dressing. The peach, roasted beet, goat cheese combo is sublime. Next time I might try caramelized  walnuts with maple syrup as suggested in the "beet salad with goat cheese" recipe submitted on this site.

Very delicious, I just used what I had on hand: 3 small beets, 1 large and perfectly ripe peach, walnuts and green onions. For the dressing I used 2 T. oil and 1.5 T. balsamic vinegar, plus salt and pepper. It was very delicious, the sweet beet and sweeter peach with the sour snap of balsmaic vinegaraette ad punch of onion is perfect. With goat cheese it would have been better (I woudl have lightened up on the vinegar in that case), unfortunately I didn't have any on hand. I piled the salad on some fresh greens, and loved every bite. Thanks for the great recipe.

WOW - impressive looking and tasty.  I used roasted pine nuts instead.  Next time, I will also add rasberries.

Although I think it has potential, and it was good, the goat cheese, fruit and beets are too heavy for the lettuce's used, and it becomes mashed/compressed just from the weight.  Maybe if it was served on a platter with guests being able to add what they wanted, vs. having it pre-mixed, that would work.  But pre-mixed I found it settled too much for the types of lettuces used.

Given the simplicity of this recipe, I expected the results to be good but not spectacular.  Boy, was I wrong -- this is a five-star dish!  A week before I made this, my husband and I dined at a well-known East Coast restaurant that features organic local produce.  We agreed that this yummy salad would have been right at home on that menu. Only change I made was to boil the beets rather than roasting them (in order to save time).   This dish was served along with the Corn and Basil Cakes  from noblepig.com.  Nice combination of flavors.

Beautiful and delicious!  I used a spring mix/herb salad blend, safflower oil for the walnut oil and added just a squeeze of lemon to the dressing (only because I had half a lemon left from another recipe I was serving).  I actually roasted the beets the previous day, intending on making this salad then, but our plans fell through and the beets were stashed in the refrigerator overnight.  I used a goat cheese that was pretty creamy, and the flavor and texture of that with this salad was just incredible.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

We really enjoyed this salad.  I didn't have peaches so I used fresh mango instead.  Delicious.

This knocked my socks off!  Each flavor perfectly complimented the next.  Couldn't find walnut oil so used peanut instead. I think the ratios of fruit to salad are a little off as written--I liked it even better when I made it a second time and just "eye-balled" it.  What a summer treat!

Technically, I had to make this with some substitutions.  I stayed true to types of flavors the original salad used, but changes the peaches to nectarines that I had on hand, pecans for the pistachios, only used arugula, and bleu cheese crumbles instead of goat cheese.  Still ended up having incredible flavors!

Our little market didn't have mache, walnut oil, or pistachio nuts so I substituted a mixture of arugula, butter and red leaf lettuce, used olive oil, and raw almonds.  The beets, peaches and goat cheese really make this salad wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I couldn't find Walnut oil, so I used Blood Orange olive oil.  The flavor mixed very well and we will use this recipe over and over.  My 2 year old even loved it!

Totally d'lish!  I had 4 beets roasted and wanted to make a salad with goat cheese...the addition of the fruit, nuts, oil and vinegar were tops.  I skipped the greens (because I don't like greens) and used plums, finely diced sweet onions, olive oil & walnuts b/c that's what I had.  Can't wait to make this again.  I'm thinking it would be great with a little bit of fresh mint sprinkled on top.  Wonderful summer salad!

This is an amazing salad and I constantly get requests from friends, family, and coworkers to make it.  As in other reviews, I also made some changes and substitutions.  I use feta instead of goat, used organic Waimanalo greens instead of the recipe greens, and I love to add sliced green apples instead on peaches.  This recipe is so simple and easy to make your own.  Enjoy!

I used spring mix instead of the mache and arugula. Subbed yellow onion for the shallots, skipped the pistachios and used a creamy pimento pepper goat cheese. As for the dressing, I used sweet almond oil instead of walnut oil. Overall the salad was nice, and a little different. My fiance went back for extra salad (which is unusual- he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy) so this is a keeper.

I tweeked this recipe a bit...I used canned beets instead of fresh, omitted the pistachios, and used a light balsamic vinagrette dressing...all of which saved a lot of prep time.  Even with my substitutions, the salad was AWESOME!  I served it with grilled bone-in pork chops.  I will definitley make this again!

this salad was wonderful! i was craving beets and my mouth watered when i read the recipe. it was even more amazing when i tasted it. roasting the beets brings out the sweetness. i heated the peach slices in walnut oil and put the beets in the salad straight from the oven. it was a great warm salad!

I accidentally forgot to bring the beets to my mom's house but this turned out great anyway. Peaches weren't in season, so I tried it with mango. It was awesome! I would make this many times and could probably work with lots of different fruits and veggies.

I made this using 2 kiwis since the store didn't have peaches ... it was awesome!  I used an arugula, spinach mix and only had 1/2 the goat cheese I needed so I added some shredded parmesean.  I will make this again for sure AND I'll be cooking more beets - they were so flavorful!

Delicious and flavourful. I made it exactly the way it's written. It was not clear what type of goat cheese one had t use so I picked a crumbly one that resembles feta.

I made this recipe using the cooked and peeled beets from Trader Joe’s and I pickled them using Chardonnay Queen’s Scandinavian Pickled Beets recipe here on All Recipes. I also substituted nectarines for the peaches and I used a mix of arugula and baby spring mix for the greens. Let me tell you it’s one of the best salads I’ve ever had!

This was amazing.  I substituted pears for peaches and I only had leaf lettuce and spinach so that's what I used.  Very versatile.  I put the beets on warm on top of the goat cheese so it was warm and delicious.  Great recipe.

Loved it! Added boiled eggs to make it a full meal and used canned peaches in light syrup because that's what I had. I was hesitant to buy walnut oil just for this, but it really enhanced the flavor. Will make this again when we invite friends over for a BBQ. Thank you whoever submitted this, it's a keeper!

I cheated. Used canned, sliced (not pickled) beets and used a prepared (Marie's) greek salad dressing with feta in it. Absolutely delicious. Potentially better doing everything from scratch, but sometimes you just don't have the time! Yum. Will make again, the right way or the wrong way!

I used walnuts and extra virgin olive oil instead of the walnut oil, but the nut combination was really tasty. Thanks fo the recipe!

This recipe was delicious. I didn't have pistachios, so I toasted pepitas instead. I will make this again.

Delicious salad! I used a container of organic arugula and spinach in place of the mache. Didn't add the pistachios, as my husband doesn't like nuts in his salad, and used EVOO in place of the walnut oil. We had guests for dinner, and everyone loved this salad. Will make again - actually, maybe tonight!

YUM!.  Didn't want to buy walnut oil so as a suggestion from another person I toasted walnuts and subbed them for the pistachios and used regular salad oil in the dressing.  Also used Trader Joe's  ready-to-go beets.  It was really good.  Unfortunately my peaches weren't sweet, but we still enjoyed it, and of course, it was no fault of the recipe.  I think this would be good with nectarines too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. Definitely going in our recipe book. Roasted beets for an hour in water at a slightly lower temperature.

Wow!  I have never found a beet recipe I liked and this one was fantastic.  All the different flavors worked so well together.  I did cut the dressing in half and still didn't use it all.  I think with the amount called for that would have been WAY too much for my taste.  I also used sesame oil instead of walnut oil since that is what I had on hand and used green onions instead of shallots.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

This was delicious.  I got a lot of brownie points for this one. I didn't have the fancy lettuce, so I just used romaine, and I couldn't find any decent peaches, so I cut a tart apple into matchsticks and placed them on top of the beets.  It was a nice contrast of favors all the way around. I also added some slivers of red onion as well. The pistachios were a nice touch, too.  I'll be making this again!

Wonderful!!! I used peaches, goat cheese and organic spring salad mix. I also used the olive oil and beet juice dripping from roasting the beets for part of the oil in the dressing.  And I topped it off with toasted sliced almonds that I tossed with a little honey before roasting.

The salad is delicious and beautiful for guests. We served it with simple grilled burgers. It is too heavy to serve with mild meats, but it really holds up to all sorts of additions like blueberries.

This was very good. I used small fresh beets and roasted as suggested. I didn't have walnut oil but used olive oil as another reviewer suggested. I also had 1/2 orange juiced to give a nice citrus twist. I used almonds which I pan toasted in a bit of butter (only used what I had). This recipe is a keeper and I will make every summer with fresh Niagara peaches and fresh beets.

I omitted the greens, used gold and red beets, chopped walnuts and chopped fresh dates. I whipped aged balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper for the dressing. It was delicious!
