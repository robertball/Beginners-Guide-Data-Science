I have had this recipe for years and everyone loves it.  A couple of tips that have made this even better:  bake the loaf in a larger casserole dish and double the sauce recipe - it's the best part!  Since the loaf itself is just average, I use 1 lb ground sirloin and 1/2 lb hot italian sausage and I add about 1/2 cup or so of the fancy (thin) shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  This has made a fantastic recipe even better.  Also, for parties I have made meatballs instead of the loaf, baked them, and then put them in a crock pot with the double sauce recipe - always a big hit.

This is great!  I've made it many, many times.  My roommate and I both enjoy this at least once a month.  I've made a few changes though: I use 3 teaspoons of dried minced onions, add 3 teaspoons of minched garlic and add a 1/2 cup of finely shredded cheddar cheese.  

Suggestions: When making the sauce add the mustard as the next ingredient after the tomatoe sauce.  This will ensure it gets mixed in well.  Prior to pouring the sauce over the top of the meatloaf be sure to drain out the fat.  I love this recipe, it is wonderful!

Yup ... five stars.  Everyone LOVES this comfort meal.  Just a couple of tips:  after cooking for 40 minutes, drain the fat before adding the glaze, and secondly, cut back a little on the breadcrumbs if you like it a little firmer.  The next time, I will try substituting the sugar for Splenda.  All in all, this is a def keeper.  Thanks.

I have been making this recipe for the past 34 years and my mother made it before that when I was growing up.  The only difference is that we don't use the white sugar at all, we mix the sauce cold and pour it over the meatloaf before baking and cook it all together at one time.  Makes for a few less dishes and the taste is excellent.  It also freezes well, so if you have a small family you can make the meatloaf, divide it in half, pour the sauce over and freeze. Then all you have to do is thaw and bake.

Very tasty, a nice change from the regular ketchup meatloaf.  The meat mixture itself is nothing special, but I loved the sauce.  I don't like to cook meatloaf in a loaf pan because it traps the fat, so I cooked on a broiler pan.  I based the meat with sauce the last 15 minutes and served the left over sauce with dinner.  It was really good.  I am already trying to think of other uses for this sauce it was so tasty.

I made this exactly as the receipe stated and it was fantastic. My whole family loved it. When I put the sauce on I put a few slits with a knife into the meat and let the sauce really get in. I have added this to my receipe box.

I make this frequently and it's always a big hit. It tastes so good and is very easy. I make this so often that I package 1.5 pound amounts of ground beef just to have on hand for this recipe. I almost always serve with rice and peas.  If I remember, I add grated cheddar cheese to the meat mixture.  I also use two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce so I don't have to measure out half of a 15 oz can.  It works out fine.  I put in more dried minced onion than is called for, probably closer to a tablespoon.  Very yummy, a family favorite.

this was de-lish! I didnt have a meatloaf pan so shaped my own and it worked out well-just pieced the meat all over when I poured sauce over it twice while cooking. 
Made a great sandwich with a slice of cheese on top two days later. Thanks for a greta recipe. PS I added plenty more onion.

If making with real meat, make sure to drain it after the initial cooking time.  I actually prefer to make it veggie-style: Replace the ground beef with a 1 lb pkg of protein crumbles and then make up the extra difference with sautéed mushrooms, peppers, onions, and throw in some frozen cut up broccoli as well.  It only has to cook 20 min before you put the sauce on since you're not cooking meat.  You can also replace the sugars for Splenda blends with no real change in flavor.  Incredible recipe!!

My family has never liked meatloaf (kids and husband), yet they love this.  I have made it for my parents (who dislike meatloaf), and for a group of my in-laws (who were very skeptical, but ate it to be polite), and they were converted.  Everyone who has eaten this meatloaf asks for the recipe.   I make extra sauce, since everyone always wants to cover the meat in the delicious and tangy sauce.

I have attempted and ruined several meatloaf recipes, but I have to say that this one is fool-proof.  I have never had luck with meatloaf but decided to try this one and I'm so glad I did.  It was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, using 80/20 hamburger.  Leaner hamburger would be healthier, but it doesn't bind as well.  80/20 is greasy, but I just drained the grease at the forty minute mark before applying the sauce.  Also, I didn't use all the sauce as I saved some to go on top after it was all done cooking.  This recipe will be made again and again, the loaf and the sauce are so good!

We absolutely love this meatloaf, and more specifically, THE SAUCE! When I make this dish, I only add 1 egg and only 1-2 tablespoons of tomato sauce to the meat.  I also add 1/2-1 cup grated cheddar cheese and I add 2 minced fresh garlic cloves. For the sauce I add the remaining tomato sauce.  I find by adding it to the meat, the meatloaf itself is just too mushy.  And because I love the sauce so much, this way you have alot more of it! An excellent, easy and authentically "homestyle" dish.

I've used this recipe for years.  I made it for the first time 9 years ago, at age 16, for my first boyfriend.  He said it was the best meatloaf he'd ever had.  I've made it numerous times for my current significant other since then, and he agrees.  I don't change a thing.

This was a great recipe. I did have to make some substitutions because I didn't have exactly what was called for, but it still turned out really well.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I substituted two cans of Campbells Tomato basil and oregano soup - one can in the meat and one can for the sauce.  Because the tomato soup is a bit sweeter than sauce I added an extra tbsp of vinegar and an extra tsp of mustard. I also substituted cracker crumbs for bread crumbs.  Everything else was the same.  The fact that it turned out, and we thought it was really good, just shows what a good recipe this was. Will make sure to have the right ingredients for next time. :) Yum!!

This was just loaded with sugar. I can't believe some people doubled the sauce! The meatloaf was drowning in it. Way too sweet, not enough sour, will not make again. Thanks anyway.

This recipe was so delicious. I tasted the sauce when I mixed it (before bringing to a boil) and was worried that it would be too sweet. But after it boiled it was perfect, the flavours really bleneded. I don't like the regular ketchup recipes I find them too bland. This one has lots of flavour!

I have 2 words for this recipe---"AWE"--"SOME"!!! My husband says it's the best meatloaf he's ever had, and he'll gladly eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!  I used 1/2 red onion instead of the minced onion and it was great!  I'll probably make extra sauce for company in case others want more sauce. I didn't use as much white sugar as it called for and it was still soooo good!  The sauce is good enough to drink!!  YUMMY!!

With over 170 reviews and an average rating of 5 STARS, I was really excited and optimistic about making this.  Followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out to be a disappointment.  The smell as it was cooking was a turn off, and then the meatloaf itself was kind of bland.  The sweet and sour sauce was tasty, but just too sweet for a meatloaf.  Neither my husband nor myself would want to serve it again.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I think I will follow others' suggestion of draining the fat before adding the sauce next time, though. It made great meatloaf hoagies (melted swiss cheese on top) two days later which was a nice bonus. This recipe helped my husband to see that meatloaf can be good and not like his childhood nightmares of chunky mystery stuff inside and plain old ketchup on top :)

I really like this meatloaf. Though in my own recipe I usually put in a bit more brown sugar and some of our favorite tangy BBQ sauce. 
:)
Enjoy.

Yum!!!! The meatloaf was moist and the sauce was delicious. My husband doesn't like sweet sauces or food (besides dessert) and he loved this!! The only thing I changed was put half the sauce on top and baked as directed, and the remaining I drizzled on top after I plated the meatloaf. Definitely will make again!!

Everyone else seems to love this, but we didn't. It wasn't terrible, the sauce was just too sweet and the texture of the meatloaf was too soft. My 18 month old gobbles his all up though, so that's good at least.  Sorry, I would have to tweak this if I made it again.

Giving this a 5 only for the sauce.  I wasn't impressed with the meatloaf recipe (I could tell by the ingredients it would be bland) so I stuck with my tried and true grandmother's recipe which uses crushed crackers, pepper, salt, diced onion, shredded cheese, one egg, and half a packet of french onion soup mix.  I also only used a pound of ground beef because this was just for me and my fiancé.    The only change I made to the sauce was I substituted red wine vinegar for cider vinegar because I didn't have any cider on hand.  Turned out great! Glad I finally found a meatloaf recipe the future hubby likes (he's found every other recipe "bitter") Thanks for the recipe!

This was just ok for us- it was way too sweet for our taste's and we like meat with sweetness. The meatloaf was standard- I would probably make this again with less sugar and see if it comes out any better.

I did make this as written.

WOW!  I would give this recipe a 10 if I could. My husband & son-in-law raved about it.  It is the best meatloaf I've ever eaten & it makes wonderful sandwiches if there are any leftovers.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand & I think that added a lot of flavor.  But I omitted the salt because of the extra salt in the bread crumbs.  I also used freshly chopped onions instead of dried.  I doubled the gravy recipe to ladle over the meat & potatoes.  This will definitely be showing up on my dinner table at least one a month.

Really good & easy. I didn't have cider vinegar & I thought the brown sugar & white sugar would be too much so I used a little more brown sugar and left out the white sugar. I added bar-b-q sauce in place of the vinegar. All of my family liked it. The meatloaf was very moist.
Thanks!

This was the first meatloaf I have ever made.  I thought it was more sweet than sour for my taste.  My boyfriend and brother loved it though!!!  I made a gravy out of the extra sauce I had and it was wonderful with mashed potatoes.  I would definitely make it again...with less sugar.

I really liked the flavor of the meatloaf itself. Probably the best I have made. The sweet & sour sauce was a little too tangy to be paired with beef, in my opinion. My husband did not care for the sauce either. But the meatloaf part of the recipe is a keeper!

Excellent Recipe!!! Instead of halving my tomato sauce I used ketchup in the meat to save the can for my sauce. I put a layer of sliced cheddar cheese in the middle of the meatloaf, decreased the sugar to a little over 1/2 cup for the whole can of tomato sauce, added a little Lousiana hot sauce and it came out wonderful, Thank You!!!!

Love this recipe. The second time I made it I was putting all the ingredients in the bowl and inadvertently put some sauce ingredients in the loaf mix. There was no going back so I threw it all in and put it in oven and baked it. To my pleasant surprise it came out delicious! Go figure! I am going to make it that way from here on out!

This is the only handwritten recipe I have from my Mother. We all love it. My recipe has 1 C milk, no tomatoes and 1 teaspoon of sage in the meatloaf. The sauce doesn't have white sugar or vinegar but does have 5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg too. It's amazing how the sage & nutmeg add a different flavor. Think I'll make this for dinner tonight!

This was very good, although I guess you could say I didn't follow the recipe.  I accidentally grabbed a can of tomato paste (yes, a large can), so I ended up mixing some of that with tomato soup for the sauce.  It was very good, although I will have to make it again following the recipe. I also baked it in an 8" square pan...more crust, definitely cooked.  It was still VERY moist.

This is pretty good.  I use cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  I once made the mistake of trying to blend together the remaining meatloaf ingredients while the hamburger was defrosting in the microwave.  Didn't turn out too well!

I'm a novice cook, and I've had rather limited success with the recipes I've tried, but this one was a hit!  The only changes I made were to double the pepper and onion, add a little garlic powder, and I used half the recommended amount of white sugar for the sauce.

This is my second time making this meatloaf.Second time around I made a small change. I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce instead of the 15 oz.1/2 went into the meatloaf and 1/2 went to the sauce.I added maybe an 1/8 of a cup of kethcup in my meatloaf and in the sauce as well. Used about 1/4 cup of fresh minced onion.The ground beef i used only had 4% fat in it so i was really worried it would end up dry.because i added fresh onions and all that ketchup my meatloaf ended up so moist,flavorful and DELICIOUS! I added 3-4 tbs.brown sugar to the sauce and did not add the white. I will continue to make this meatloaf with my alterations. The sauce is great by the way.

To pack in some nutrition and add flavor and moisture, this is what I do: Use 1/2 lb lean ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork (Yes that's only 1 lb meat total).  Instead of using dried minced onion, add chopped 1/2 medium-large onion.  Add 1 cup finely chopped carrots and at least 1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach, and follow recipe as directed.  I use a mini-prep electric chopper so the additional prep is simple and fast.  The extra veggies actually mellow out the sweet and sour flavor.  I never use a loaf pan, but instead I use a 9x13 baking dish and shape it into a loaf about 1 1/2" high.  This is excellent over white rice.  My whole family, including a very picky toddler, loves this.

Awesome recipe.  Really tasted great and didn't take too long to prepare.  I like things spicy so I added some Tabasco to the meat mixture as well as some red pepper flakes to the glaze.  Came out wonderful...sweet and spicy!!

I give this recipe 5 stars for flavor, the sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and sour. However, my loaf was too wet. The meatloaf didn't hold its shape when it was time to serve (it broke into pieces) and the texture was mushy and not firm. I did use ground turkey instead of beef.

This was a great meatloaf recipe.  I also tried another from this site (Rempel Family Meatloaf) and then liked things from both recipes and combined and made one.  Loved the tomato sauce from this one but used the crackers, steak sauce and Lipton Onion soup mix as well.  I also used a special meatloaf pan (regular pan with insert to keep the fat on the bottom without touching the meat).  This is a must-have if making meatloaf.  Also for something different you can put half the meat mixture in your pan and then add American Cheese slices and then top with remaining meat and bake as usual.  This is a great alternative and added flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this over and over again.  It is a staple recipe in our family now.  The only changes I make are, I use 1lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground sausauge, I use about 1/4 cup diced oniion in place of the dried minced onion and I add 1 clove garlic to the sauce since we love garlic.  EXCELLENT recipe!

I didn't have the dried minced onion so I subed a package of onion soup mix. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. I think this is one of the best recipes for meat loaf that I've made yet. I do think that I could have used about half of the white sugar and it would have been just as good. This is definately a five star meat loaf.

The sweet and sour taste of this moist meatloaf is not typical, yet it's not special either.  Nothing about this meatloaf stands out positively or negatively.  If you like meatloaf, you'll like it.  If you don't like meatloaf, you won't.

Extremely delicious.  I used Hunt's tomato sauce seasoned for meatloaf and Garlic seasoned bread crumbs and it turned out fabulous.  Will definitely make it again.

The sauce is so good on this I wish I had made more so I could have had some to spoon on the mashed potatoes. The meatloaf came out very moist and delicious. This will definetly get added to my rotation.

Our family's favorite meatloaf.  If you like meatloaf with a little tang or you eat it with ketchup, this is the recipe to use, Always moist. Replaced my family's recipe from generations ago.

This was wonderful.  Hubby doesn't like meatloaf texture, so after cooking just the meatloaf, I cut it into 1" slices and browned each side in a skillet.  I then served the slices with the sauce poured over.  A big hit in my home!  It's also a good idea to double the sauce.

I made this last night and my picky husband gave it two thumbs up (and he usually doesn't like my meatloaf)! I followed the advice of another poster and drained the fat before adding the sauce - that was necessary. Also, I added diced onion and bell pepper, and used jar marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce. Even my 3-year-old ate this (and she usually skips meat).

Oh, this is GOOD!  My family thinks it is the best meatloaf I have ever made!  It's the only meatloaf recipe I use now.  The sauce is TDF!!!!  I didn't have any tomato sauce in the house the first time I made this recipe, so I substituted condensed tomato soup.  It turned out so yummy that I have used tomato soup every time I have made it. I serve this with mashed potatoes and a vegetable, and it's great comfort food.  Thank you for a recipe that I will use again and again!

Overall this was very good:  Moist, and a nice tartness from (apple cider) vinegar.  I only added 1/4 cup of sugar, but it was still VERY sweet.  Next time I'll add a bit more vinegar, and omit the white sugar.  I'll probably reduce amount of brown sugar, since that flavour was very noticable, so dish has a better/equal balance of sour & sweet :) 4/18/09 I've made a few more times since original review in 8/08, and we like it even better w/changes made (still using 1.5# ground beef):  1 T brown sugar, 3 T cider vinegar, no white sugar.  For us the balance between the sweet and the sour is much better.

From someone who was never a big fan of meatloaf, I love this recipe!  Also, my husband and two kids love it and request it all the time.  When do kids crave meatloaf?  Not mine until I tried this recipe.  I normally add some of the sauce to the meatloaf so the sweet flavor is throughout.  Just don't add too much or it won't hold together.  Trust me on this one, once you try this meatloaf recipe, you'll never make meatloaf any other way!

I thought this recipe was GREAT! My husband on the other hand thought it was way to sweet! I will compromise with him next time I make this and make the sauce less sweet. (I'll make this sauce for me on the side, ;-))

This was sooo good. I was at a loss for dinner one night and found this recipe. I had everything I needed right in my pantry. My family LOVED it, my son, who is quite finicky, wants it again and again. I think the sauce for this would be delicious on pork chops and grilled chicken too. Thank you!!

I love making this meatloaf. It is so easy and makes great lunches for my husband who is a teacher. A tip for blending ground beef so that it doesn't end us solid as a rock: use a pastry blender to mix ingredients. It incorporates air into the mix. I use the pastry blender to make hamburgers as well. I prefer to use ground sirloin for this one, and always line my pan with aluminum foil to save on cleanup.

Had to use red wine vinegar , also added minced garlic for flavor . EASY! I really don't like meatloaf , but this was soo yummy !! The meat was moist , full of flavor ( I eye-balled everything). Hubby, said it was o.k. (he doesn't like drowned food, I suggest keeping sauce on the side, instead of pouring over whole loaf). Kids didn't ask for 2nds

DEFINITE KEEPER!  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and used ground turkey, extra sauce, garlic and real (red) onions.  I even added some of my own meatloaf recipe ingredients such as: milk to my breadcrumbs and let them soak for 5 minutes before adding the breadcrumbs to the mixture, parsley, garlic, grated parmesan and fresh thyme.  This meatloaf was EXTREMELY moist and a hit with everyone!  Try it out, you will NOT be sorry!

YUMMY!!! We are not real fans of meatloaf but my whole family Loved this one! I baked it in a square pan and used half the white sugar. Simply delicious. I will definitely be making it again. Thanks

O.k.  I have never had luck with meatloaf, but I guess I got lucky this time!  I hate mushy meatloaf so I put this in a square pan instead of a loaf pan and it turned out great.  I also have a huge sweet tooth and this was perfect for me!  I had no tomato sauce on hand and used tomato soup instead and it turned out excellent!  My kids all had seconds.  This is one you have to try!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. Excellent sauce with a tangy taste. I used an onion instead of the onion flakes and instead of the prepared mustard i used a french's honey tangy mustard and it was yummy. Thanks for this recipe

Awesome recipe.  I ended up substituting Manwich sauce for the tomato sauce because I didn't have any in my pantry and WOW!  I made this for my husband's family and they all raved over it.  Had to send home a few slices for my brother in law to take for his lunch! My sister in law took my printed copy with her because her OH SO PICKY teenagers LOVED it!  My 5 year old gets so excited when she sees me make it. Thanks a ton for this one Jo! This will become a huge regular in our house ;o)

This recipe is so easy.  We like it saucy so I doubled the sauce recipe and it improved this already yummy recipe.  My 3-year old loves it as well as my husband.  Made it for company and received rave reviews.

This was a great change!  I like a really sweet meatloaf and I dip mine in to ketchup, but my kids don't like the ketchup part.  This was a great compromise!!!!  My daughter kept saying it was the yummiest.  Great recipe!

My Kids and I LOVE sweet dishes and my husband LOVES sour dishes so I needed a recipe that would satisfy both.  This dish is absolutely scrumptious!!  I didn't have a loaf pan so I used a regular baking dish and it turned out beautifully!!  The meatloaf was moist and the sauce is what makes the meatloaf!!  I will defitnatly add this recipe to our favorites list!

This very good.  I used extra lean ground beef so there was no fat buildup to worry, nothing to drain off.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and froze half for another dinner.  I made one error which actually turned out very well: I put half the sauce mixture in with the meat, instead of just half the tomato sauce but as others said the meatloaf itself was less than remarkable I think my mistake gave the meatloaf an extra boost. I'll make it the same way next time.

very good recipe, everyone loves it and its so easy to make. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef because its healtier and it seems to mix together with the other ingredients easier.

I added a bit of worcesershire, 1/2 c sauteed onions and green bell pepper.  The sauce was outstanding, my fav. on any meatloaf to date.  Also, for more texture bake the meatloaf on a roasting pan, not in the loaf pan, that has slots that allow it to drain the fat.  It gives you those really good end pieces.  Also, good tip about forming the swell to hold the sauce.

This was really good!  A great alternative to regular meatloaf.  My super picky son even liked, so it HAS to be good!  I paired it with the broccoli and rice stir fry I also found on this site.  I can't wait to use the sauce recipe for a meatball appetizer as well.

I thought this was good.  I don't know how some people could double the sauce and have it all fit in the pan though.  I chose not to double the sauce and thought it was plenty!  Very simple to make, I will put this in my rotation.

The meatloaf was wonderful! I, of course, forgot to include the bread crumbs as I started cooking at around 8pm and must have been too tired to read the directions carefully. However, despite the fact it didn't hold to a typical meatloaf form, it still tasted great! I followed the advice of another reviewer who said to double the sauce recipe as it was the best part and I'm glad I did as I put the left over meatloaf in a container with the sauce on top for my work lunch. Even my boyfriend who is a vegetarian (or at least he strives to be anyways) tried it and loved it, and it's a 50/50 shot on if he will love anything I make.

This is a really good recipe - mostly the sauce!  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef to cut the fat in the recipe and it was just as good if not better!!

I asked my husband to make this for dinner and he just went through the list of ingredients and through them in all together and baked the meatloaf.  We did use half beef and half ground pork which worked well too.  Baking it this way didn't need a sauce as it was cooked right in and it was delicious and very moist.  The whole family loved it, especially me!

Thanks to whomever said to add the 1/2 packet of onion soup mix that made the meatloaf full of flavor.  The meatloaf is great and moist but blah on the sauce. It is tooooooo sweet!  I felt like I was eating sugar. I like a sweet and sour flavor but that too me was more sweet.  I did eventually end up doctoring it up to make it more edible but next time I think I'll make this meatloaf with the onion soup packet (oh and I used real onions) and just leave off the sauce.  I'd rather have the ketchup flavored sauces myself.  All in all I'd give it a 4 because the main part of the meal was great!  Skip the sauce or cut back on the sugar maybe???

A very pleasing meatloaf.  Could be a bit more sour.  I will probably add an extra tbsp. of mustard next time.  Overall very pleased.  Works well with mashed potatoes and brown gravy.

This is wonderfull. My husband was not much of a meatloaf eater but when I made this he could not get enough of it.  He would usually ask me sometime during the week "When are you going to make that meatloaf again?" I was making it at least once a week for him.  I have taken this to work for our potlucks.   Now when we have a   potlock I am usually told that I need to bring the MEATLOAF. Everyone raves about it.  This is the only meatloaf that I have ever made that was not DRY.

YUMMY! I only had one pound of lean ground beef (instead of 1 1/2 pounds), but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The texture was perfect, and it tasted delicious! Definitely a nice change from the typical tomato sauced meatloaf!

Not 5 stars but excellent.  I'd suggest either a little more bread crumbs or bake it a little longer.  Just a touch mushy in the mid section.  Good recipe!

Very tasty. Since this was my first time EVER making ANY kind of meatloaf I learned that lean or extra lean beef would be best for this recipe! And the only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because the bread crumbs were really soggy...but other than that, tasted good.

Made this last night for the first time and turned out wonderful, just delicious! I feel the need to mention that my husband is NOT a meatloaf person and he too enjoyed this! Per another reviewer's suggestion, I added about 1/4 cup of shredded sharp chedder cheese to the meatloaf. I also used a can of tomato sauce for meatloaf (just happened to have it on hand), and it addes a little extra flavor to both the meatloaf and the sauce. I used approximately 1/4 cup of white suger in the sauce just to cut down on the sugar a bit. Turned out great, will be a regular at our dinner table! I finally found a meatloaf my husband will eat - Thanks Jo!

The taste was great.  I used 1/2 cup red onions and put some garlic in the sauce on top.  I left out the white sugar and it was still wonderful.  The only problem was there was a lot of fat at the bottom.  Next time I think I will try it baking it on a rack.  Very moist, juicy and flavorful.  I am not a meatloaf lover but this one is a keeper!!

We absolutely loved the flavor of this recipe and I will definitely make again. However next time I will read the directions! I just started adding everything to the meat instead of making the sauce separate. So the flavor was great the loaf was kinda soggy, again my fault!

To the woman who said it was too tangy, it's called Sweet and Sour Meatloaf! What did you expect?!?!?!

I am NOT a meatloaf lover but my husband and brother-in-law are so I was looking for a recipe to make them since I never make meatloaf.  Needless to say they loved it and I actually really enjoyed it myself.  I used seasoning salt, less breadcrumbs and more onions as others recommended.  Will definetly make again.

This is a superb meatloaf recipe!  I've made it at least five times now and each time anyone who eats it agrees it is an absolutely delicious meatloaf.  The only change I made was to use real onions.  Do yourself a favor and make it for dinner tonight!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yumm! I made it with ground turkey, wheat thin crakers and omitted the white sugar totally (just personal preference and less calories). Added 1/3 cup of each, freshly chopped basil, parsley and 1/2 cup chopped mashroom to add moisture. It turned out moist and less sweet. No left overs. Thanks.

I made this last night for some friends, and EVERYONE was absolutely thrilled with it. The one thing I will change next time I make it, is I will mix more tomato sauce into the meat, and have less on the top. It makes it easier to pull out of the oven, and makes the meat a little more moist. This recipie is delicious, and I will continue to make it for years to come. I can't wait to eat the leftovers today!

I was really excited to try this sauce and it was so good ! The actual loaf was just O.K. -
I am going to stick with my personal meatloaf recipe but am using this wonderful sauce from now on with it ! I always put in a whole packet of dry onion soup mix in the meat mixture as well as a litle ketchup & garlic salt. 
But this sauce was so tangy & yummy !
My family liked it too.
One thing I forgot -- my usual glaze on top is
equal parts honey & ketchup. 
The second time I made this sauce I added just a little of some kethup/honey mix with it and it was even better ! I just used a small amount to taste though.

I've had some real mishaps with meatloaf over the years.  A friend told me to add rice to my meatloaf, that it was a good binder/filler.  She never said anything about cooking the rice first.  You should have seen the look on my husband's face when he started to chew his first bite.  He thought the hard grains of rice were his teeth cumbling in his mouth!  Well this recipe was better than that rice meatloaf, but it wasn't "Oh my gosh this is sooooo...good."  It was OK.  I guess I'm still on the quest for the perfect meatloaf recipe.

I thought the recipe was great! I used "meatloaf mix" rather than all ground beef because it just tastes better.  Also I didn't have minced onion so I used some fresh onions.  Next time I will add more fresh onion to the recipe.  Definitely better than your "traditional" meatloaf recipes.  I will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good meal..that I would serve even for a real King....But I do say thou ..I have fresh pineapple left and so cut it into slices and I put that on the bottom and sides of the pan and then added the meat..The kids ask why I didnt have enough of the pineapple and meatloaf....So I will have to make this for 14 people now instead of 6 people which I really made it for 12 to start with....How a family can grow overnight because of a meatloaf that you came up with...unbelieveble....Thank you is all I can say....

Phenomenal! Moist...tangy, easy to make, and I KNOW the leftovers will make excellent sandwiches. Sliced well...didn't fall apart. I used an 85% lean ground round. The sauce/glaze was plentiful. I used it as a sweet-tomatoey type gravy after pouring the excess out of the pan and "nuking" it briefly. Served it next to some roasted garlic mashed potatoes and a green salad. Meat loaf as an art form. Good one, Jo!

THIS MEATLOAF WAS QUITE TASTY.  I USUALLY MAKE A MEATLOAF THAT HAS BEEN AROUND THE FAMILY MANY TIMES AND IT IS ALSO GOOD. BUT THIS WAS A NICE VARIATION AND THE SAUCE IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD ENJOY THE MEATLOAF AS WELL IF NOT FOR THE SAUCE. NICE CHANGE OF PACE.  THANKS.

Our family loved this meatloaf.  My husband asked that I make it again soon, and often.  I used 1 lb. ground beef as that's all I had, but made no other changes in ingredient amounts.  Also, I didn't have tomato sauce so used catsup and omitted the 1/2 c. white sugar and vinegar.  The tangy taste of this meatloaf goes particularly well with maccaroni and cheese.

This exceeded my expectations. Meatloaf part was a bit plain for me, I added a small chopped onion and some worchester sauce to spice up the meat. Definitely its necessary to drain the fat before pouring on the sauce. Next time, I'd make more sauce as it really is good, and its tasty to have some sauce left for rice on the side. 
Basically, this is a sweet and sour meatball recipe for meatloaf. My kids loved it as did I.

My family loves this recipe.  I do NOT cook it in the micro.  I just think that sounds HORRID!  But baking it at 350* for a while is perfect.  I do add a few more things that we like, spice and such.  I add a dash of this and a dash of that into the topping b/c we like those things.  But the onion soup mix makes it SO easy.  And I use the whole thing.  Usually I use a half # of beef and a whole # of turkey.  This makes it hearty, yet a little healthier for my family.  I love to pot the oven on broil for just a few seconds at the end, and get the ends all crispy and brown.  YUM YUM.  My stepson always says, "I know, I know, you get the butts!"  LOL  If I "slave" over that stove, I DESERVE THE GOOD PARTS!  HaHa!!  Anyhow, it's so flippin' easy and good.  Try it!!!

I think this is one of the best meatloafs I have EVER had!  I took other posters advice and did it on a roasting pan so it wasn't greasy AT ALL and I made the divit in the top of the meatloaf with a spoon so the sauce stayed on top (such a good idea!).. I also added a touch of garlic and wine seasoning from the melting pot (one of my favorites I add to just about everything) to the meatloaf and a little bit of worchestershire sauce to the meatloaf and sauce... I doubled the recipe and we have enough for dinner tomorrow.. I can not WAIT to eat it again tomorrow!!!

It was incredibly moist and a nice change from the usual repetoire.  Initially, I put the meat in a meatloaf pan and the quantity of meat did not fit - the pan was too small.  So as someone suggested, I transfered the meat to a large casserole dish and it was great!  Hubby and 1 picky child loved it.

This was pretty good meatloaf.  I found the vinegar to be a little overpowering.  There was a LOT of sauce.  I didn't really like that, but my husband did (certainly kills the need for ketchup). I probably won't use as much sauce (but keep in reserve in case he wants to pour more on) to make it more manageable out of the pan.  Overall, it tasted good and was a nice change from the traditional meat-loaf.

This is a very good recipe. Similar to "Sweet-and-Sour Meat Loaf" also found on this site that is made in the microwave. I made them both. For this one, I tried it once as is - and then made some changes to make it just right for me (using some things from the other recipe). I upped it to 2 pounds of ground beef, added 4 tbsp. ketchup, 2 tbsp. yellow mustard and 2 tbsp. onion soup mix to the mixture. I increased the minced onion to 2 tbsp. and left the tomato sauce out of the mixture altogether. I increased the cooking time to 1 hour for a crustier loaf around the edges. For the sauce, I used the whole 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, 4 tbsp. cider vinegar, 4 tbsp. brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I left the mustard out of the sauce. I drizzled just enough over the loaf to glaze and returned to the oven for an additional 15 minutes. Then, we had plenty of sauce to use as a "gravy" for our mashed potatoes (which was out of this world) and more for the meat if desired. This is a sweet and tangy recipe for sure - so you really have to have a taste for it. This recipe provided a great base for me to get to what I was after. Thanks so much!

Great meatloaf.  Very moist. I did cut back on the sugar a bit and used fresh sweet onion. Also used butter cracker crumbs.  Will definitely make again!

This is an excellent dish...my family love the meatloaf.  The only thing different that I added was a sweet pepper from my garden.  This really set the meatloaf off with the sweet and sour sauce. Simply delicious

This recipe was just ok for my family.  I expected it be great based on the reviews, but I wasn't overly impressed. I followed the instructions as written and although the meatloaf was moist, I would have prefered it to be a little crispy around the edges. The sauce was tangy (a change from the usual sauce on meatloaf), but I didn't care for it. We won't prepare this agafin.

The whole family loved it. Depending on time and mood I add onions, green peppers and cheese.  The sauce is a great addition to the meatloaf.  Will definitely make again.

Meatlof was just ok, but the sauce was really good. Based on other reviews, I added real onion and cheddar cheese to the loaf.  I used crushed Ritz crackers bc I didnt have breadcrumbs and I doubled the sauce. I made 4 mini meatloaves instead of one large one.

The sauce was fantastic, I think I will add real onion and garlic instead of powdered next time and maybe less bread crumbs and egg.  It didn't get quite as crispy around the edges as my boyfriend would have liked, but I will definitly make this again.

i liked the meatloaf, but the sauce is too sweet. i thought 1/2 cup white sugar PLUS 2 TBS of brown sugar sounded like a lot, but i tried it anyways. it was too sweet for me. i would make it again though, just less sugar.

Amazing what a simple recipe can do for a common dish. This was delicious. Even my wife, who always resisted anything other than the meatloaf her mom made (with a catsup/brown sugar top), admitted that this was great.

SOOOOOO good!!!  "Mini-meatloaves" from this site are my fiance's absolute favorite, so I tried this recipe because it has similar ingredients.  We loved it!!!  And it was easier to make.  I'm dying to try the sauce on something new.  Thanks!!

Looking at this recipe it's hard to imaging how good it tastes.  I decided to try it based on it having 5 stars.  I accidentally cooked it too long and it still turned out wonderful.  Also I added nearly a half of a cup of oatmeal to it, and used spicy brown mustard in the sauce.

I don't know what I could have done wrong, as I followed the directions to a T but this meatloaf had the consistency of cat food.  The meatloaf itself lacked flavor but the sauce on top was delicious.  1 star for the meatloaf and 4 stars for the sauce.

I was a little leary about making this dish.  I've never been a meatloaf fan, but  seeing that it was made with a sweet and sour sauce,  convinced me to try it.  Boy am I glad I did!!  It is such a tasty dish.  My familiy loved it. And it's so easy to make.. very little prep time, for such a great outcome.

This is the only meatloaf recipe that my kids love!  Everytime I make meatloaf, they tell me that it better be the sweet and sour one.  The sauce is excellent with this and gives it a real tang.  Definitely worth making.  Its's now a staple in our household.

Good as described, very tangy.  This is a good change of pace for "regular" meatloaf.

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious!  I did think the sauce part of the recipe was too much sauce for the top of the meatloaf, so I only put in half of the sauce I made.  Yum!  I will make this recipe again!  Thanks so much!

Good taste. I have recipes that I prefer, but this one was a good meal with mashed potatoes. I ended up messing it up a bit and added the entire sauce to the beef mix, instead of pouring it on top. It made the meatloaf a little crumbly, but I added some extra bread crumbs, and it held together pretty well. I kept all the ingredients the same otherwise.

OK - I was originally going to make a chicken loaf but did not have the ground chicken...decided to go with this recipe since it had such great reviews.  I am so glad I did.  I tripled the recipe and I quadrupled the sauce.  Low and behold, I did not have tomato sauce; I used the next best thing, V8!!  It was awesome!  I added the Lawry's Seasoned salt, mined onion (real onion) garlic, cheddar cheese and some other spices.  I let the meatloaf bake for about an hour.  I got so many complients.  I have already made it again!  Great!  Thanks for the awesome recipe for boring old meatloaf!

After seeing rave reviews, I tried this recipe.  Our family didn't like it too much.  The sauce was different, could have been that I used balsamic vinegar instead (did not have cider vinegar).

Don't believe the hype. This sauce was much TOO SWEET. I even cut back on the sugar and it was still too sweet. I will not make this again.

The sweet and sour sauce is excellent! I omitted the dried minced onion and added two medium onions, 1/2 green pepper and one clove garlic. A definite keeper!

Very good and easy to make.  Leftovers make great meatloaf sandwiches.  I did use a sweetener substitute but I think just sticking with regular sugar might be a little better.  I used Splenda and I think it made the sauce a little tart.  I would also like to figure out how to decrease the carbs in the actual meatloaf – instead of bread crumbs maybe almond flour?

This is a most delicious meatloaf recipe that is very simple to make.  The flavor is wonderfully tangy and compliments the onion and meat.  I have not really liked meatloaf in the past, but this is now one of my favorite dishes.  It is great as leftovers, too!

I could not find my own recipe for sweet and sour meatloaf so I tried this one...way too sweet and way too much sauce! If I make it again, I will make it into a loaf ( not in a loaf pan) and make a trough in the top in which to pour some of the sauce. I’ll half the sugar and watch as I pour the sauce that I am not drowning the loaf. The meatloaf is tasty but we have to scrape the sauce off before eating it!

Very Tasty and can be economical when ground beef is on sale.  I make two and keep one in the freezer, ready for defrosting and baking.  Everyone loves it.  A regular rotation item.  Thank you for the recipe.

A great recipe, I just made a few small changes to suit my taste.  1)  As others reviewers suggested, I eliminated the white sugar from the sauce and added a few more tsp of the brown sugar, 2) used 3/4 of the sauce to pour on the meatloaf while cooking (saved the remaining 1/4 for the table for guests to pour on as needed while eating) and for the meatloaf itself, used 1/4 cup regular ketchup,  3) drained the fat out of the pan before adding the sauce.  It was yummy!

I make this all the time,  but I make individual meatloaves,
shaping them with my hands.  Since there are only 2 of us, I
freeze  and then vacuum seal excess loaves and sauce.

NOTE:  The other day, l thawed two of the loaves, but decided
not to do a meat and 3 meal.  So I flattened the meat loaves, 
and fried them.  I also fried some panko coated leftover mac
and cheese.  Put it all together on a bun with mustard and
lettuce, and had a new meal we both liked immensely.

My husband and all others that  have eaten this meatloaf , always ask for seconds or thirds  The topping  really makes the flavor.  Recipe does not need help but once in a while I add a little 57 Steak sauce to the meat mixture.

My mother's recipe is similar.  The meatloaf itself I use meatloaf mix(veal,beef and pork) giant food, acme sell this mix. I then add 1/2 can Hunt's tomato sauce, 2 eggs, 1cup of gluten free bread crumbs or Progresso Italian bread crumbs. Then 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, I also use 1 small onion minced. S&P, if use GF bread crumbs then use 1T Italian seasoning. Sauce the same but 2T stevia instead of sugar then pour on meatloaf in a 9 x 13 glass pan lightly buttered and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 15 mins baste every 15 mins. By putting sauce on for the whole time it goes into meat and gives great flavor. If want gravy just doubled sauce and make from drippings . My favorite meatloaf.   Great flavor.

Amazing!  Swapped out the tomato sauce for  jack Daniels original no. 7 bbq sauce.  Next time I will half the amount of sugar in the sauce since it's a bit much with the bbq sauce.  Fortunately, my sweet tooth isn't complaining ??

A wonderfully seasoned meat loaf .  Others say bland, but I think that it came out really good .  The sweet and sour sauce is the star of this dish. Not overly sweet bc I used only a 1/2 cup of a natural brown crystal sugar, and added an extra tablespoon of "Chianti" red wine vinegar . I doubled this sauce recipe for Chinese cooking later in the week . This recipe is my " go to " from now on....Enjoy....

Sauce was way too sweet for me I like mine tangy.  I left out the white sugar and replaced the 2 tbl of brown sugar with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  For the meatloaf I replaced minced onion with real chopped onion that I sauteed in butter.  I added a chopped red bell pepper and 1 tbl of mayonnaise.  I also did not add the tomato sauce to the meatloaf mixture.

I make a microwave meatloaf that is similar so I thought I would try this. My family just loved it. I put my own spin on it by cutting out the white sugar, using about 3 Tbs of brown sugar, adding white and dark raisins to the sauce (for sweetness)and using honey mustard. The mustard really added terrific flavor.It was so moist. Give it a try.

The absolute best meatloaf!  I have not given this to anybody who has not loved it.  I also add mixed cheeses, onion soup mix and I use half spicy sausage and half beef.  I also double the sauce!

I used 1/2 lean ground beef and 1/2 angus ground. Used a little less bred crumbs and used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. It was a winner and even Better the next day. :)

This is a great meatloaf recipe.  I loved the sauce that went on top.  I actually made a double batch, and I had to add a bit more brn sugar for my liking.  I had some sauce left over so I drizzled some on the meat when it was on our plates.  My kids loved it (ages 6 and 4), and had seconds. :)

This is the only meatloaf recipe I use (and probably ever will).  The meat is great and I crave the sauce - it's simple but works so well on the meatloaf.  I make this a lot and even get requests for it when I visit my family.

Really weird smell and texture, but very good taste.  Family seemed to love it.  I think I put too much tomato sauce in the meat.. it was a little soft...

I had great reviews for this recipe.  I did not have the bread crumbs on hand so I used oatmeal.  I will cut down the cider vinegar to 1 tablespoon next time.  It was a little too tangy for my taste but my family loved it the way it was.

This is a decent recipe; The meatloaf itself is unimpressive; the catsup topping is what makes it so good.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I halved the sugar, substituted onion powder for minced onion because I was out, and substituted red wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.

Awesome meatloaf.  My kids would never eat meatloaf until I made this, of course I had to call it a meat dish before they would try it.  Made great sandwiches too!

I didn't have cider vinegar so I substituted with rice wine vinegar. I also didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted with one can condensed tomato soup and 3/4 can water. I also used fresh minced onion. Even with the substitutions, the meatloaf came out great!

This meatloaf is great. Not too sweet as one might think. The combination of sweet and sour (more like tangy) is just right.

My 9 year old son really liked it but my husband said I've made better meatloaves.  I used half a chopped onion instead of dried onion.  Also cut sugar to 1/4 cup in sauce.

The meat loaf was good but the sauce was to runny for me. I make a sauce quite similar but mine is thicker. I like mine better.

My husband liked this but still prefers the meat loaf recipe I've used for years.  I, on the other hand,thought this was fabulous! I followed the suggestion to add more minced onion, but the sauce is what makes this so special. I will continue to humor my husband with his preference, but I will definitely make this again for me.  It is wonderful.  Thanks, Jo.

This is really delicious. I'd never had meatloaf before, and I picked this recipe because of all the good reviews and because the sauce looked particularly tasty, and it is! I used several cloves of fresh garlic, and one medium-sized chopped onion rather than dried onion, and also I used Hy's seasoning salt rather than regular salt. Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this!  We did add 1 Tbsp of HP sauce (or A1) to liven it up.  The lemon was surprisingly good.
