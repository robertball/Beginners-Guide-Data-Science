this was a.m.a.z.i.n.g. i loved the nutmeg in it. i'm not sure how long i baked my, but the crisp on top had its deliciously crisp parts. beware: the pan is really heavy so use two hands. i didn't, and my crisp flipped onto the table. it was totally intact, but upside down!

YUM!!! I just made this apple crisp today and it tastes amazing!! The only variation  I made was putting a little less water and a little more butter (i actually used margerine) but everyone loved it! Tastes great and pretty easy to make

I just made this tonight and my son and husband really enjoyed this apple crisp.  I especially liked the soft, moist apples.

This was fabulous. The tartness of the apples and crunch of the topping were perfect. I served with ice cream and don't think I would do it anydifferently. I did double the topping for a little extra delight!

Found the recipe read the rating so I tried it. My husband ate 5 serving of this and my kids loved it warm with yogurt icecream on top. It is one recipe that I will keep.

Good apple crisp, I would make again.  Nice traditional taste, I thought.  Great warmed up with ice cream!

I have done this recipe twice now, and it is a terrific dessert.  The second time I made it, I had help in the kitchen and the apples were sliced a little thicker.  Maybe 1/4 inch or so.  When I did it the first time, the apples were sliced nearly transparent.  With the thicker slices, the apple peels were still intact after cooking.  They made the crisp difficult to cut into portions because they wanted to string themselves together.  The flavor is fantastic -- just the right balance betweeen "fruit" and "sweet".

OH MY GOD!!! This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I love the topping on apple crisp so I always make a little extra, which I would recommend doing. Served warm with some vanilla ice cream on top this is sure to be a winner. My husband couldn't stop raving!
