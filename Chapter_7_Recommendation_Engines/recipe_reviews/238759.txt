YUM! This was perfect for pizza night! I love pizza and this was delicious plus the Reynolds foil made for easy clean up. I opted to use store bought individual pizza shells that I brushed with garlic infused olive oil. I also subbed thin sliced tomato for the mushrooms as my husband isn't a huge fan of mushrooms on pizza. I also added some thin sliced onion. The fresh basil really made this pop. So easy and so good - perfect with a glass of wine!

Great Pizza!  I made my own dough and rolled it out into two thin crusts.  I made one exactly as the recipe reads.  The second one I added some fresh spinach and feta cheese.  They were both great!  They were great for leftovers the next day, too!  The reynolds foil made for simple clean up!

I used Reynolds Wrap Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil and was able to grill these pizzas right on my barbeque! No dishes to clean up after! This was my first time grilling pizza, and I LOVED the smokey flavor it brought to it! Any season you will find us outside with the barbeque!

Really tasty! Never make homemade pizza, and I am reminded why - the darned dough. Couldn't make it thin enough to save my life. So went with it thick and stopped fighting it. Still very good.  I added some thinly sliced red onion and red bell peppers. Yum! Thanks Reynolds! Slid right off the cookie sheet!

Easy to tweak to personal tastes and a DELICIOUS pizza recipe! I cooked on foil and baked in my oven, using a pizza dough recipe I found on Kraft that we like (I made one large 16" round pizza), and adding diced onions and peppers to the sausage when I cooked it. I used canned mushrooms since we were out of fresh. I used mozzarella cheese and sprinkled Italian seasoning and garlic powder on the ingredients to give a little extra "Italian" flavoring, along with the sprinkling of Parmesan. Baking on the foil was not only super easy for clean up, it gave a very nice texture to the crust and we all really enjoyed this dish!

I started with my own pizza dough and used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site then topped as directed.  This is so much better than cooking directly on the grill and I will do it this way in the future.  This  makes making personal size pies a breeze.  Thanks, Reynolds!

This was great! I make my own pizza dough and we added sliced onions to ours. I also made 1 16" pizza instead of individual ones. I love how using Reynolds makes for such an easy clean up! I very easily transferred my pizza to a cutting board and it kept my pizza pan completely clean.

This pizza turned out perfectly. The mushrooms and sausage went well together, and were a nice departure from our regular pepperoni and cheese pizza night. I didn't have the fresh basil, but I'm sure that would have added another lovely layer of flavor. Definitely will make this again.

I used a store-bought whole wheat crust for these pizzas (it made three small pizza). I also substituted breakfast sausage for Italian sausage. I used two different cheese blends (Italian and a three-cheese blend). I added diced onions to our pizza. I used crimini and white button mushrooms. I wanted to grill the pizza but the foil burned up on the grill before I cooked the crust so I baked the pizzas instead.
