Great recipe!!!  I went to Houston's last week and got a rough recipe from the bartender that was essentially the same – she didn’t know any measurements, but the ingredients were consistent with the recipe listed on this website.  According to her, they boil the artichokes for 20 minutes and then refrigerate them for 1 hour before grilling.  I just tried the recipe at home (incorporating these instructions) and they came out great.  Because I am limited to an oven, I broiled the artichokes on high, as closely to the burners as possible (without touching of course), for approximately 20 minutes.  This gave them the nice charred look and flavor on the outside.  Hope this helps those without access to a grill.

Really good, and very simple!  I boiled the artichoke halves the day before, drained them thoroughly on paper towels, and refrigerated them before scooping out the chokes with a spoon (don't forget this important step) and grilling them the next day.  Get them good and charred for the best flavor!  The marinade/dipping sauce is great!  I also made a garlic aioli for dipping that complemented the artichokes nicely.

Very good! I do think it's odd that the instructions don't mention to remove the choke, some cooks might not know that they should do that. Anyway, next time I think I would boil the artichokes for longer and only grill long enough to put a little char on them. Great flavor though. Thanks! :)

I also had grilled artichoke for the first time at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant, and loved it, so I was very pleased to find this recipe. I've made these a couple times now, and will continue to use this recipe. Living in an apartment, however, outdoor grilling is not really possible for me, but I thought broiling these in the oven also worked well.  (I made the mistake of placing them too close to the broiler at first... with all the oil on them that's probably not a good idea--I moved them to a lower rack to be on the safe side).  Broiling does not give them the same charred look or quite the same flavor as grilling, but is still good for a second-best method.  Also, rather than cutting the artichokes in half before boiling them, I boiled them whole first for longer (30 minutes) then drained them and let them cool for a few minutes before cutting them and then basting and broiling.  Just my personal preference.

This recipe reminds me exactly of the taste of the grilled artichokes at Houston's Restaurant.  The only variation I put on it was to steam in a basket instead of boiling the artichoke.

Great recipe and super easy. I used small artichokes and made them for an appetizer - really a crowd pleaser and so pretty on the plate. I boiled them a little longer and also added a small amount of balsamic vinegar to the marinade. Delicious and everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks!

Very good.  Even my kids enjoyed it.  Recipe didn't mention removing the chokes before grilling - which I did.  They needed a bit more salt but were tasty even without using the additional dipping sauce.

Gets three stars because it did not say to take out the "choke," the flavor was not enough at all, and trimming the top of the artichoke is not specified (i.e. cut off the top 1/3?).  My husband and I feel like three stars is generous.  Not sure why the reviews are so high-- maybe we are just crazy!

Living in the produce capital of America we have access to many fresh fruits and vegetables picked straight from the fields with artichokes among them.  Easy preparation, though readers should take note that the submitter forgot to mention to remove the "choke" prior to grilling.  This recipe had too much lemon in it for my taste buds, but that's a quick and easy adjustment.  Thanks so much for the submission rosiella.

This dish is amazing, the tastiest dish I've tried in months! Wonderful! We ate grilled artichokes in Cheese Factory but this is way better. Highly recommend it. We have charcoal grill that gave it nice smoked flavor. Thanks Rosiella, you made my day!

I really enjoyed this.  Made as per recipe (halved) and it was delicious.  I didn't have any leftover oil mix for dipping, but the flavor of the artichoke and garlic was good on it's own.

This recipe is excellent! The char marks on the artichokes make it so tasty! I made a dipping sauce similar to the one we get at Cheesecake Factory: 2 big tablespoons of mayo, 1 teaspoon balsamic vinaigrette, 1 clove smashed garlic, 1 teaspoon chopped cilantro. Sooooo good!! My honey ate 2 artichokes by himself!

Absolutely delicious!  I modified the recipe just a bit by adding lemon juice to the boiling water, and instead of just salt and pepper I used a homemade Cajun seasoning spice blend in the oil and lemon mixture, then added to that a little bit of the water the artichokes were boiled in.  Basted it constantly while grilling, turning often, and it came out beautifully and very, very delicious.  This is a keeper and an instant favourite.  Homemade Cajun spice blend (can be used on MANY different kinds of dishes):  Roughly equal amounts of black pepper, onion, garlic, and chili powders. Half measures thyme, basil. Double measure cayenne pepper. Blend well until uniform color. Increase volume by about 1/3 with salt, and mix thoroughly (do not reblend). I like sea salt or kosher salt because it's crunchy, but any salt will do.  Use as you would any seasoned salt.

Delicious!  I cut the sauce in half and there was still plenty left over!  The only change I made was adding some parmesan cheese.  These were excellent and we will be making them again!  My husband loved them!

This was very good. I liked the grilled flavor over the traditional boiled method. I used baby artichokes. I did not boil them prior to grilling. This recipe is a keeper.

It was great! Did just like the recipe states but added  a little more garlic and lemon. Cut side up first on the grill, let the oil mixture cook inside the artichoke, then flipped over for a few more minutes.  Gave it lots of garlicky goodness. Probably less than 10 minutes on grill ...Thanks for the easy recipes. I will be making this again.

Wonderfully tasty recipe.  I boiled my artichokes for about 15 minutes and then grilled all sides until nice grill marks appeared.  The combination of lemon and olive oil and charred bits of artichoke is heavenly.  Left out garlic as husband is allergic and it was still great tasting. I played with lemon juice to oil ratio and bumped up the lemon as well as using kosher salt and freshly ground rainbow pepper. So pretty for a party as well. Removing the choke is done by slicing the artichoke lengthwise and using a spoon to scoop it out. Trim sharp points of leaves with kitchen shears.

I have been growing artichokes in my garden and this is my favorite recipe for serving them. it is basically the same as the ones served at Houston's which are fabulous. For appetizers, try this method, using baby artichokes...they are a crowd pleaser!

Yummy!  I don't even bother firing up the grill...I just pop them under the broiler for a few minutes and they are perfect!  What a delicious way to enjoy artichokes, thanks!

The flavor was fine, but I thought it dried out the artichokes. I much prefer to just steam them.

This is probably the 30th recipe I've tried from this site, and all of them have been fantastic until now.  I'm trying to figure out how this recipe received so many positive reviews.  I followed it exactly, and was very disappointed with the results.  The heart was decent, but none of the leaves were even close to being edible. The only thing that I can think of is that maybe the boil time should be increased to 40 minutes?  Next time, I will boil my artichokes for 45 minutes and enjoy them.

These artichokes are wonderful.  I have a slightly different method.  I simmer the trimmed whole artichokes in well salted water with a lemon sqeezed over them and the lemon tossed into the pot.  When tender - remove from hot water and invert to drain and cool.  Use an electric knife (serrated) to cut in half.  Use a sharp paring knife to score between the choke and the heart and a small spoon to carefully remove the choke.  Coat with the garlic olive oil etc... and place on a tray in the refrigerator.   This way the are ready to grill and the mess is all cleaned up.

Made this last night with one addition, drizzled black truffle oil on at the end of grilling. Served it with Aioli Sauce - the artichokes were outstanding!  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent! The only thing is that we used 1/3 of the oil that it called for and I still felt that I ate too much oil. The flavor is phenomenal though!! REALLY good! :) We will make it again for sure.

This was a great recipe, but I wish the ratio of lemon to oil was greater than the recipe suggests. The lemon really adds great flavor to the artichoke, but can be masked by too much oil.   I steamed mine for 30 minutes before grilling. Yummers!

I would give it 6 stars if I could.  Best way I've had artichokes ever.  I halved the recipe because I knew my husband wouldn't want any.  I ate both halves and could have had two more and that be my dinner.  I don't see ever making artichokes differently again.

A great alternative to dipping in butter.  It's easy to prepare, and a crowd pleaser.

Oh, my...This was so amazing! I don't know if I can appreciate an artichoke again unless it's cooked this way! I followed the recipe exactly...which I must add, is rare! I signed up here just so I could make a comment! :-) These have the most incredible flavor! It's worth the little bit of effort...believe me. Oh, I've decided if I ever need a "WOW" factor included in a meal...these are on the menu!! :-) Deserves 10 Stars!!

Wow. This recipe has changed my life! This was my first time grilling artichokes - one of my favorite foods and one I grown in my yard - and I am just amazed at how delicious and easy they are. I love that you can just rip the heart right out and eat it first! I made a total of 8 artichokes last night (they were so good we made two batches). I had three different types and sizes and the recipe worked great for all of them, though I cooked the big ones a little longer. Do remember to scoop out the choke with a spoon after parboiling. So good - thank you!!

Perfect! Mine boiled up s green and pretty and because it was cold and I don't really have a grill I did the grilling part on my George Forman grill...turned out fabulously. My boyfriend complained that there was no butter be he somehow managed to eat quite a bit and really enjoy these artichokes...so did I and I didn't miss butter or (gag) mayo at all.

This was my first time making fresh artichokes--my mom use to make them all the time when we were kids.  It wasn't as easy as expected and I wasn't that crazy about them the night I made them.  But, I had them the next night for leftovers and they were phenomenal!  Also, I was out of coals and didn't feel like running out so I made these by baking them on 475 for about 20 minutes.  Yum!

These were just okay. I had steamed them then grilled. I also inserted sliced garlic inside the leaves to boost the garlic flavor but turns out to be just a hint of garlic flavor.  It didn't quite taste like the one we loved at Santa Barbara. I will find another recipe.

Definately a good one to make for a party.  You can cook them ahead of time, then just toast them on the grill when everyone arrives.

I made 8 artichoke halves and in my family of 5, they were gobbled down in less than half an hour. I had an incredibly silent table for having 3 girls. Anyway, the consensus was that these were the best artichokes they had ever had, and I agree.

The lemon flavor came through perfectly. I decided to marinade them in the lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic before grilling them, along with basting them while they cooked. Every bite was a burst of flavor!

Really good but a little bland for me - I served it with a ranch dressing mixed with a little balsamic vinegar dip instead.  Felt better than dipping it into oil.  The technique worked perfectly though!

These were one of the best grilled artichokes I have ever had! The dipping sauce was excellent. The only thing I will do differently next time is have a bit more of the sauce to dip in made up as I ran a bit short. This one is a keeper!

We will never make artichokes the old fashion way ever again (boiled/steamed and stuffed). Although I miss stuffed artichokes, it was always difficult. More than half the time they wouldn't come out good. With this recipe they come out great every time!

These are the best!!! A new regular on our menu. I've always liked artichokes but now I think I LOVE them! The basting sauce is great with fish as well so double the sauce and make an easy dinner. Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent! A very nice change from regular steamed artichokes.  I liked using the leftover basting sauce as a dipping sauce too.

I love these artichokes!  Full of flavor - healthier than with butter & mayo, but much more flavor.  I microwave the artichoke a few minutes first, then put the artichokes cut side down in the marinade.  Grill until stem is tender.   We accidently overcooked them, and they were still wonderful!

Easy. I grilled them over the low open flame on my stove for about 15 min, until charred. I served them face down atop a pool of lemon, olive oil & salt. Was out of garlic, didn't miss it. 
This would make a nice small course as part of a multi course Italian meal. It takes time to eat, so it will stretch out the meal.

I doubled the "sauce" which was fantasic!  Steam or boil them at least 20 min, much too tough after just 10 min.

Oh my.  I think I've just made the most gorgeous appetizer on the planet:)  I've never worked with artichoke before so I'm really happy everything turned out so awesome.  I don't have a grill so I used my George Foreman.

Not sure why the reviews are so good on this recipe, I made these last night and the flavor of the dip/sauce automatically over powers the flavor of the artichoke. The lemon, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper did not serve to add flavor or season to the artichoke at all.

I don't see the fascination with artichokes, but if I ever make it again, I will use this recipe. My husband loved it. He really loved the dipping sauce recommended by reviewer on May 10, 2011.

WOW! I ended up eating the kidlet's leftover artichokes. Next time I would like to use 1/4 cup olive oil because I wasn't really pleased with the dip. Served with white rice, Marinated Tuna Steak, Idaho Fry  Sauce for the artichokes, and Cherry Cobbler I.

This was really good. I did scale back the olive oil to 2 tablespoons due to the fact that I only had one artichoke and I am trying to cut down on fat intake (I didn't even use it all).  I kept everything else the same.  I am a die hard butter and artichoke fan but this is so much healthier and  I will continue to make it this way. I too broiled instead of grilled like other reviewers and it was yummy, can't wait to try on the grill.

This sauce is spectacular! A quote from my boyfriend: "I want to BATHE in it!".  It would be great drizzled over vegis, as a marinade for shrimp or chicken, or a dipping sauce with crusty bread.    The artichoches were perfectly cooked, though I prefer them without the crispy edges you get from grilling.  On top of being delicious, the recipe was very simple & healthy. Can you ask for anything more?

These were really good and the grill added so much extra flavor. I didn't use as much lemon as the recipe calls for because we're not huge lemon fans but other then that this was good. Next time I will probably add more garlic and other herbs just for a little more flavor.

OMG! Best grilled artichokes I have ever hand! Not to toot my own horn, but these are good! I didnt soak these, just put them straight in the pot with some garlic salt and pepper. Then took em out and dipped them and seasoned. Threw on the grill, and made a dipping sauce with the left over oil/lemon. MMM good!

These are VERY yummy! I made  the mistake of steaming for 25 minutes -- way too  long and as a result some of mine fell apart and couldn't get to the grill. The halves that did make it were exceptional! Looking for the flavor of the ones from Houston's -- this is close.

I'll never steam artichokes again.  This recipe was fantastic.  No dipping in butter needed!  I didn't even use the butter in the recipe- only olive oil!  What a great healthy alternative.  THANKS!!!

These were good, but I do not recommend dipping them in the oil as you eat -- it was way too oily!!  I like the idea of marinating the chokes in the fridge after boiling...I think I'll try that next time to help the artichoke absorb more of the flavor.  This was an easy, delicious recipe that I'm sure we'll make again.  I really liked the lemon in this dish.

Good recipe and very easy too.  I would have liked a more garlicky flavour so next time I will add more garlic.

Was very tasty especially w/ adding balsamic vinegar before serving. Also added thyme to the oil mix. Grilled too long and they got crispy/charred, but still good. Started the timer for 30min when I put the pot on to boil, so I don't know how long they cooked for but it was enough. Maybe cut back on the olive oil, or use light next time.

Excellent! As many reviewers noted, don’t forget to remove the choke. I cleaned & trimmed and halved the artichokes except for the choke. Boiled them for 20 minutes. Placed them in a prepared iced water bath & then drained & easily removed chokes. I then brushed them with some of the marinade and let them sit in the fridge in a covered dish for about 30-40 minutes. Charred them up on the grill, basting as instructed. I added additional flaked salt & pepper just before serving!

The recipe really should be modified to remind beginner cooks to take the choke out.  Also the dip not as good as I have tasted from other recipes. I'm going to try the mayonnaise, balsamic vinegar, cilantro dressing that someone else mentions in their review. Will be perfect with better dressing.

Fantastic!  Tried them for end-of-summer dinner party. Brave, I thought ??. Be sure to constantly watch them on grill, as the olive oil drips into fire and will burn them. The guests loved them. Huge hit. I added more lemon and garlic and used a bit of chile-infused olive oil with plain for a little extra flavor. ??

Made this last weekend for guests and we all loved it!  A nice change to our usual garlic butter dipping sauce.  Loved the grilled flavor and was a great light side dish.  I removed the choke after cooking, but before serving, as it's easier for me at that point.

These artichokes are incredible. I will never go back to plain old boiled chokes. Cutting in quarters before boiling ensures faster cooking and easier to baste the sauce into the chokes.

I loved this! I've had grilled artichokes in restaurants but had no idea it could be this easy. I didn't have any garlic so used McCormicks garlic salt instead. It was delicious! Whole family enjoyed. I used my little electric grill inside and it worked out very well.

These were WONDERFUL!! I have always been intimidated by artichokes, but when they went on sale for $1.00 each, I thought I would give this recipe a try. So glad I did! SOOOO EASY! I steamed them in my steamer, then marinated in the fridge for a couple of hours, & grilled just long enough to warm, and they were a huge hit! Making them again this weekend for our camping trip!

I was looking for something new and low carb. I had never made artichokes before so I thought I would give it a try. I also made a sauce out of just mayo and balsamic vinegar to dip it in. This was AWESOME!

I made it last week and I'm making it again right now :)

I made it last week

Good recipe, very simple.  The artichokes I used were very large and could have boiled a few minutes longer.  I let the artichokes marinate while waiting for the charcoal to get ready.  Served with a lemon wedge, awesome!

This could be a 5-star recipe, with one significant change, the artichokes need to be steamed for longer before grilling them!  If you steam artichokes for only 15 minutes, they are still going to have tough leaves.  Grilling them doesn't really cook them, it only chares them and imparts flavor.  I made these once following the recipe exactly, and was disappointed to try and bite into raw artichoke leaves, total fail.  I tried it again steaming them for about 30-35 minutes first, and they were amazing!  I also skipped the step of soaking them in lemon water (after trimming, halving and removing the chokes) and just threw them directly into a pot of about an inch of boiling water with a little lemon juice in it.  After basting I grilled them for 5-7 minutes per side (no flipping more than once).  My husband likes to dip his in mayo so I made a sauce of mayo, balsamic vinegar, crushed garlic, salt and pepper. But I didn't think they needed to be dipped in anything at all.  So delicious!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It was tasty, but it seemed like an awful lot of effort for not a lot of flavor.  I boiled my artichoke halves in water that was seasoned with garlic and onion and then added butter to the dip.  It was perfectly good tasting, and the grill did add a nice flavor, but I think I could have been just as happy with boiled halves thrown on the grill and dipped in mayo while eaten.  Forget all the extra steps.

I am not a fan. It's possible that I simply do not like artichokes all that much, but I did not enjoy this dish as much as I'd hoped.

Forget the olive oil, use truffle oil. Makes a huge difference. I actually steamed the chokes the day before and let them cool overnight. Before throwing them on the grill I sliced them in half and removed the fuzz. I sprinkled just a bit of the truffle oil on and I stuffed the garlic and lemon mixture into some of its layers and basted the rest.  It makes for a really beautiful presentation with the grill marks and some thick sea salt sprinkled on top.

So bummed.  My husband said they tasted like roots.  I even bought baby artichokes in hopes of changing the bad reviews.

I really thought these were terrific-I've only ever had artichokes steamed before.  I actually made these for a crowd and found that I had trouble with all of that dip separating, so I stirred in a little dry mustard.  Also, I broiled mine because we were out of fuel, but I can't wait to try them grilled (I thought they were a little greasy, but I'm sure cooking them cut side down on the grill would have taken care of that problem).    Next time I make them for a huge group I think I will actually marinate them.  I will definitely try this again!

Very easy and tasty!  May need to boil for a bit longer than 15 minutes unless using very small artichokes.

Very tasty! My brother & I went out to a local steak place for dinner one night and saw these on the menu. We decided to give them a try and they were SO good. My brother can't stop talking about them. I found this recipe and made them for my husband. He loved them too. I am going to make them for my brother and surprise him. Since all he has talked about since our steak dinner, are the BBQ'd artichokes he had!

Oh were these good!!!!  I followed the recipe closely except for using less olive oil-just a personal preference.  I found 1/3 cup oil was just enough.  There is no need to dip them in any of the leftover olive oil if you do make the whole amount of dip.  Flavorful enough.  I would suggest that you get the water boiling before trimming and chopping to avoid having to soak the artichokes in water first.  These are too good to pass up!

Hands down the best artichoke ever!  Be sure to steam your choke long enough if its one of the really really big ones, mine came out slightly crunchy after BBQ.

These were delicious! I loved the grilled flavor. I steamed them first, rather than boiling them, because I like that method better. My only criticism with the recipe is that there's WAY too much marinade - I couldn't really brush them too often on the grill without causing flare-ups, and I thought they were oily enough (and flavorful enough) to not need dipping.

This is a great alternative to the mayo dipping sauce. It tastes like something you would order as an appetizer at a fancy restaurant. My kids weren't the biggest fans. I would use a lot less lemon next time. This is definitely a recipe I'll monkey with.

I steamed these whole for 35 minutes then refrigerated and cut in halves.  I was worried about all the calories in the dip so I only made half the sauce and brushed fairly conservatively on the grill. I think I prefer my mayo/curry/white pepper dip instead.

We saw grilled artichokes on TV and thought they looked great so I found this recipe.  It was a success and my artichoke hating husband has been converted.  No more steamed chokes dipped in mayo for this family...lol  Although Hubby did not know that the marinade was homemade and asked if I used Italian salad dressing.  Obviously I didn't but to save time I do now and it's just as great.

Great recipe.  Will steam them before the grill next time, rather than boiling.  I also added some balsamic to the olive oil dip.  Very good.  Even my 7 year old loved them!

Grilling the artichokes halves gave the leaves and hearts on the exposed side an undesired crunchy texture.  I prefer whole cooked artichokes.

This was great...very tasty. I boiled the artichoke whole and removed the choke. I also added a little more garlic, salt, and lemon juice. I didnt use the left over sauce to dip because I didnt think it needed it. Will definitely make again.

I have always cooked my artichokes in a pressure cooker, so I steamed the artichokes for 15 minutes (whole) in the pressure cooker then chilled before cutting in half and following as directed. Absolutely loved them!

Love these!  Like others I have had the Cheesecake Factory grilled artichokes and wanted to replicate that recipe so I added some balsamic vinegar to the marinade.  I also steamed them instead of boiling to retain more nutrient value.  Yum!

Great way to have artichokes.  I took the choke out before I boiled them, it makes them easier to eat at the end.  I love what the grill does to the flavor of the artichoke.  These just have to become a regular side for the grill!

Excellent! I have made these twice so far, within a week of each other...my Husband does the grilling for me and they are very yummy, it is nice to have a different way to cook artichokes besides steaming them :0)I did not change this recipe at all.

These are the bomb-diggity!  Whenever we make these, they're devoured instantly!  Wouldn't change a thing!  I do serve it with a paprika aioli, just to indulge a little extra.

This is not the way I usually cook artichokes. But I really liked it. Didn’t have access to a grill, so I finished it in the boiler. I had also seen another similar recipe where they put some garlic, salt, pepper and lemon in the boiling water as well.

Directions were easy to follow and the artichokes were delicious. I made a side of aioli sauce but honestly drizzle lemon on top and you don’t need anything else. Will definitely make again!

Loved these!  I took out the hairy choke part after boiling. I used the garlic oil to spread on other veggies and chicken breasts that I grilled. Used a lemon aioli instead of the oil as a dipping sauce.  Will make again and again!

Having grown up eating artichokes, I have to say I'm impressed with this recipe.  A tip I learned a long time ago is to use an electric knife (the kind you might use on a Thanksgiving turkey) to cut the top off, as well as to cut it down the middle.  Takes out all the work.  Lastly, I grilled for 2-3 minutes per side.  Can't wait to make this more often. & of course remove the choke.

Very tasty! And as most others have noted, you NEED to remove the choke. There are very helpful videos and instructions online if you've never done it.  Instead of boiling, I steamed them in my pressure cooker for 6 minutes. When brushing the artichokes with the oil, I made sure to separate the leaves to get in all the nooks and crannies.  I then grilled them cut side down for about 4-5 mins, then flipped them over, brushed with more oil and grilled an additional 4-5 mins. Watch for flare-ups! I'll make these again!

This was just “okay”. Tried it because the doctor said my husband needs more fiber in his diet and artichokes are high in fiber.  This was my first attempt at cooking fresh artichoke so didn’t really know what to expect, but we both thought it was a little tasteless.  I think I would add garlic and onion powder to the water when I boil them if I try this again.

Was delicious and helpful!

Only thing is that the recipe fails to mention that you need to remove the hairy looking bit from the center after removing from the grill.

I'd also recommend a different dipping sauce, maybe horseradish, dill and cream based.

IFantastic. Based on comments, I  changed a bit. Cut  in half, removed the choke,  dipped facedown in lemon juice.  Placed face up in a steamer basket. Put minced shallorts/garlic on the inside.  Spooned leftover lemon juice and refrig until ready to grill.  Grilled for 10+ mins.+/- . Butter, minced garlic, minced shallots and a splash of lemon juice for the marinade/dipping sauce .  FIVE STARS!

The flavor was great but 15 minutes was not long enough for the boil part.  I'd double it or wait until you can sick a fork in the stem.

Just as others have said. Remove the choke which, after you cut the artichokes in half, take a knife and cut right below the fuzzy area. Take a spoon and scoop out all the fuzzies with the purple leaves. The recipe was awesome. !!!! I also used an ice bath to cool it down before adding the garlic oil.

I will never eat artichokes any other way! This was delicious! I cut off the spikey ends and some of the top, steamed the artichokes, let them cool. removed the choke with a spoon and drizzled on the marinade. I didn't measure anything,  just threw it together then on the grill. Very flavorful. Thank You for a wonderful recipe!

Super flavorful! I cooked the artichokes in advance. Cut them in half and took the choke part out. Then poured the marinade all over the insides and let them sit until we were ready to cook - several hours later. Grilled them cut-side down until nice marks forms. YUM! No dipping sauce required!

Sorry didn't like it.  Maybe I did something wrong.  To me, it still needs the sauce with a little mayo like Houston's!

It was a bit tricky removing the choke fibers thoroughly.  I boiled for about 18 minutes but they were not done enough.  
The garlic lemon oil was very good.  
I grilled, cut side down for about 12-14 minutes and they had an attractive char.  Slight charring on leaf ends and nice grill marks on the bottom.
If I make it again I will test that it is done to my liking before grilling.  The grilling did not significantly cook them further.

It wasn't until after I put the artichokes in the boiling water that I went to look at the reviews and saw that I needed to remove the choke.  I had to pull them out of the boiling water and wait for them to cool down.

After enjoying grilled artichokes in many restaurants, I was ready to enjoy something like I've enjoyed in the past.  I have to say I was pretty disappointed,  These just didn't have as much "umph" (flavor) as I had expected.  If I make them again, I will certainly add more herbs and spices.

Turned out fantastic. What a great way to make artichokes that doesn't involve white wine and 10 pounds of butter. The artichokes I had were quite large so I would boil them for maybe 20 minutes next time as the very outer layer was tough and the heart not tender on one. I loved em and it was so simple! This is going into the mental cookbook for sure. Thank you!

I read all the other reviews before I made this  recipe:      
1.   first I think the success depends a lot on your artichoke, is it fresh & ripe?         
2. for how long to steam before grilling if steaming at all - how big is your artichoke? mine was huge        
3.  is it really necessary to remove the choke or will it burn off on the grill?  I didn't risk it because I brought these to a bbq party, but next time I will try to not remove the choke first.

This recipe had lots of potential but I blew it by throwing my large beautiful artichokes on a too hot charcoal grill at a party.
It was a big risk, and I will try it again.    They were burnt and not fully cooked after 10 minutes.
I steamed them for about 20 minutes before removing the choke and marinating in this wonderful dressing.  I followed other comments on this site and reduced the oil and increased the lemon and garlic.  I pressed the garlic and added all the bits and juice.
I made a dipping sauce out of 3/4 c yogurt, more garlic & lemon, and 1 chipotle in adobe sauce.
I can tell its going to be awesome once I get the right grill temp.

I usually steam artichokes but I'm glad we decided to grill them. Delicious!  We sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray, salt and peppered them then sprinkled with garlic. Easy peasy

There's nothing better than grilled artichokes.  Having said that, I would say we are split on this recipe -- my husband loved it; I liked it.  The flavor was okay, but they were so oily and messy to eat that it made the overall experience, for me,  just a little...meh! 
I still preferred the mayo for dipping.

This was a very good accompaniment to our BBQ steak tonight.  I had never had grilled artichokes before, but will make them like this from now on. I cut back on the oil like some others did also.

Fantastic! I found the artichokes could use about 5 minutes longer on the boil. The dipping sauce is worth its weight in gold. I'll never go back to using butter with artichokes.

"Pretty Great Baby!", was the response from My Guy. So tasty that it was eaten up before I could take a picture. I like my artichokes on the firm side, so 15 min boiling & 10 min grilling made them just right. More lemon flavor than I expected, but in a good way if you are a lemon fan. Followed directions as written, except I put the boiled artichokes directly into an ice bath & then drained them for an hour prior to basting & grilling.

Making this for the second time. Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I love the idea that we don't have to have any dipping sauces either. A favorite for sure.

Just what I was looking for. I've made boiled and then later, steamed in the microwave, artichokes throughout all of my adult life; I taught each of my children starting at age 3 how to eat an artichoke. In recent years I've ordered the grilled ones in restaurants and wondered how to replicate that at home. Tonight I decided to try, consulted Allrecipes and found this one, and bingo this is it!

As others have noted, do remove the choke first. I did mine before boiling.

Thanks, recipe author, and Allrecipes!

This was really delicious. Even with lemon juice instead of fresh lemons. I agree that it tastes a lot like the one at Houston's. Only issue was the leaves toward the outside didn't get the seasoning, so I think next time, I'll use the brush to get some of the oil in between those leaves as well. Yum!

This recipe was great for a person that knows how to prepare an artichoke. I made it this spring when I got several artichokes in my bountiful basket. We had guests with really particular taste and they loved them, as did we. It was also a great introduction to artichokes for our kids.

This is the only way I make artichokes, I love it!  Make a little bit more of the garlic oil mixture and mix it with a couple of tablespoons of mayo to dip the tips of the artichoke in.  It's amazing!

Did not add the lemon juice to the water to keep the artichokes from turning color. I wish I had. I cooked the chokes in the water before cutting in half. One cut well the other did not.

Delicious!! Grilling adds a wonderful flavor. I still prefer a lemon-mayo sauce with the artichokes, but this was a delicious basting sauce for grilling them.

I am rating this for me, and my artichoke-loving daughters. My hubby loves them too, but is too closed-minded about how I prepare them, and won't accept any other way than my pan-braising, so we'll forget him in this. My boys are too lazy to eat them, so they're not included either! So....these were fabulous! We really loved the way the grill added that extra "umph" to the artichokes after they were boiled. I did put a tied-up spice packet in the water with them that had a bay leaf, peppercorns, and thyme. After the basting, we didn't even bother to dip! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is great.  Me and my 11 yr old grilled the artichokes and the one thing she suggested after eating them was to add more sauce and make sure it drizzles deep into the part that you actually eat.

Next time, try boiling for an hour before grilling.

The recipe itself was good.  Not sure the artichokes were worth all the work, though.

Very good. The recipe made way too much oil, though.

I love artichokes and typically steam them.....never again. This is an easy foolproof method that is so flavorful, you don't need to dip them. Thanks for the great recipe.

We use two artichoke recipes in our house.   This one is our favorite and it is also our indulgent one.   The other is a very low calorie recipe.   If it is my choice, we cook this excellent recipe for.

These were fabulous.  I've been eating artichokes since I was very young the traditional way - boiling them.  This was the first time I've tried them grilled, and they had a different flavor - so great!

YUM! YUM! YUM! My family loved this recipe!! I didn't use lemon because my family doesn't enjoy it much but it still came out delicious! I used half butter and half oil (because I didn't have enough olive oil left for the recipe). I also basted the artichokes while grilling and they came out DELICIOUS!

This was really good and my roommates loved them too.  I would have prefered a stronger garlic taste but thats me (and I'm a garlic-o-holic!) but it was very good as written too!
