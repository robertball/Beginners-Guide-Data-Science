These were a little messy, but oh so very good. It was easier to use one tortilla at a time, just cover the whole tortilla with cheese, and put the onions on half and fold over, mush easier to flip over. I used a mix of Colby jack and pepper jack cheese. The cooking time was perfect.

AMAZING!!! The boyfriend and I ate them all up! I did only half an onion and it was enough. I did add a can of chicken to the stove top onion mix. Perfect! Added side salsa to dip. It made three large quesadillas.

I was *starving* when I made these and really looking forward to them.  That being said, they were just ok.  They lacked flavor.  I'd even added some sliced baby bellas to make them a bit heartier and they were still fairly bland.  I love how quick and easy there were, but if I made them again I'd definitely add a bit something else (though I don't know what that is yet).  I also find it easier to flip to use one tortilla (and fold it in half/flip).  THANKS for the recipe!

DELICIOUS. I use way more onion and used some bacon grease and brown sugar to caramelize them. On a foil lined baking sheet I put tortilla down- cheese on half then onion, 1/2 piece of crumbled bacon and more cheese. Fold it over and repeat for other tortillas. Bake in oven turning them over when slightly brown and enjoy a simple delicious meal.  No additional butter or oil in tortilla is needed. The addition of bacon gives this 5 stars. Thanks for a great base recipe

Did not have fresh peppers so used jarred ones, also used shredded Gouda cheese. Turned out brilliantly!

Simple but delicious. Jalapenos added a good amount of heat to it. It is a bit simple, and I could see adding one or two more ingredients (steak, especially, is sounding pretty mouth-watering to me right now). But it is a great canvas to add your own little artistic touches to! I'll be making it again.

i tweaked this recipe a little bit and only made one quesadilla with 2 jalepenos and half an onion which turned out good but quite spicy

I love anything with caramelized onions and this is no exception. I wish I had added more stuffing, but next time I will.
