THIS ROCKED!!  What a refreshing change for leftover turkey.  By about the 3rd day of leftover turkey, you want something that doesn't taste like turkey and this is it.  I served it over leftover hot dog buns that I buttered and turned into garlic bread. It tasted tangy and a good BBQ flavor.  My husband LOVED it and wants to make another batch with the rest of the leftover turkey to freeze for another time.  I will cook this anytime I have leftover turkey!

Great idea for leftover turkey, an easy meal indeed!  I like my bbq meat really saucy, so I needed to double the sauce part in order to get the desired consistency.  I also added a splash of red wind vinegar and some thyme and sage (always a must w/turkey).

This was surprisingly tasty.  I made a few minor tweeks and doubled the sauce, reduced the worcestershire to half of what it calls for and added 3/4 cup of vinegar for some tang.  Very good with these modifications...at least to my taste.

This was awesome! A great way to use leftover turkey without feeling like you're eating leftovers. I added a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar because I love the flavour it adds to barbeque sauce. I served them in whole wheat pitas with spinach and some grated cheese. Thanks for the recipe, Katie.

This seemed almost like BBQ shredded beef. Good flavor.

This was pretty good. The sauce had a nice flavor. The only thing I changed was no celery and I added about 1/4 cup water. I would have liked more sauce for the 4 cups turkey though.

I used red bell pepper -- but otherwise did not change a thing.  We really liked it -- maybe I'll try it with ground turkey or beef as a sloppy Joe.

This was better than I thought.  I used about half the butter to cook the onion and celery.  Didn't have green pepper either.  Also, I only simmered for about half the time.  I think I may try this with cooked chicken too.

This was a great way to use up the last of the Thanksgiving turkey! My young kids thought it was a variation of my BBQ pork and I didn't argue because they ate it up.  (They aren't big fans of turkey.)  A nice change from a white/cream soup based recipe.  I left out the green peppers (knew they wouldn't go over well with the under 9 crowd) and then substituted one Tbs. molasses and 2 Tbs. white sugar for the brown sugar (because I didn't realize I was out until I went for the sugar).  Thank you!

7.25.16  Didn’t have turkey, but I did have some cooked chicken breast in the fridge, so that’s what I used.  This would be delicious as a sandwich, but it transitioned nicely to an appy filling a baked wonton wrapper and garnishing with chopped fresh mango.  Tasty, easy, tangy and has good eye appeal!  And I will remember this the next time I have leftover turkey, always looking for ways to use that up, too.

I thought this was easy, and good. Nice change for something to do with leftover turkey. The longer you let simmer, the better. My son loved them.

This was just okay - there are bottled bbq sauces that are better tasting (quicker, too).  I did enjoy the fresh veggies.

This had great flavor. But as others I had to double the sauce. Anytime I have BBQ. I like to put some on my rice. Thanks  for a good post.

It was not bad but I would not bother making it again.  I had to double the amount of sauce or it would have been really dry and it was kind of bland

DOUBLE THE SAUCE!!!!  We really liked the flavor, but there was very little to no sauce.  Definitely a keeper for us.
