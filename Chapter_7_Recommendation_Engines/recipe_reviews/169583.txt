Also made a couple of changes, but nothing major. Made it vegetarian, and added some chickpeas to make it more hearty. Also was out of red onion, so used regular onion instead. Excellent flavor, enjoyed this recipe a lot.

You know, I always dislike those reviews that say: I changed this, I changed that, etc. HOWEVER, I am going to post one like that because I didn't have all of the ingredients necessary for the dish. Very, very good, even with my changes and omissions. I'm sure it'd be even better. We don't like peppers and onions so I skipped those. I sprinkled a little onion powder in the mix. I was all out of Balsamic Vinegar so I used Red Wine Vinegar instead. I had no fresh herbs so I skipped those too. I'm sure if I had all the ingredients it would have been even better. It was excellent.

I thought this was a great salad! I used a red pepper instead of a green, I added diced cucumber, and I only used half of the lemon juice. I also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth like other reviewers suggested. Excellent! Will make again!

I hardly ever leave reviews , but this was sooo good I had to rate it! I omitted the chicken since quinoa has a good amount of protein, as well as the salt- the feta and olives provide enough salt for my taste.

I really like this recipe, i'm a vegetarian, so I did a few substitutes (I use vegetable broth, and no chicken. I also don't like olives, so I didn't use any..)   The recipe was still great, and it's an awesome protein dish that I can throw together really quickly, using whatever vegetables I have on hand. I have made a habit of making this dish in large quantities, then refrigerating it so I can take it to work later in the week. It's the kinda dish that tastes as good or better on the second day. Enjoooyyyy

Excellent! I adjusted the recipe: cooked quinoa in chicken broth rather than water and bouillon; eliminated the garlic and parsley; used a yellow onion rather than red and yellow bell pepper rather than green; added green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, grated carrot, a couple handfuls of chiffonade spinach leaves, and sliced celery. I like to add more veggies...Yum!

O....M....G!!!!! DINNER LAST NIGHT WAS AMAZING! My husband and I LOVED this. He's not big on trying new things, but when I told him  about how healthy quinoa is and had a way to make it that he'd like, he went for it.  I read over the reviews to see what  adjustments we could make and with them it was delicious! We omitted the salt, used half the lemon juice and added chickpeas. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth, and used red instead of green pepper (that's all I had). I also am weird about raw onions, so when the chicken was almost done I threw in the onions so they could cook a little. We will definitely make this over and over again! Thanks a ton!!! (:

This salad was a big hit with my family.  My 13 year old's exact words were "flippin awesome". The only change I made is that I decreased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup because that's all I had, but it was perfect and I will stick to that amount.  This will be my new go to recipe for potlucks.

Excellent Quinoa recipe! Here's what I did: cooked quinoa in chicken broth vs. bouillon cubes. Omitted Chicken (wanted it as a side for fish). While quinoa was cooking, I chopped all the veggies and herbs called for and added 4 seeded/diced roma tomatoes. Mixed veggies and herbs with lemon juice, balsamic, and olive oil. Let it all sit together while waiting on quinoa. Added olives to the mixture (it is very important to use Kalamata olives specifically). When quinoa was done, added it to the mixture. Stirred gently until mixed, then added feta and stirred again. Delicious!

This was outstanding! Have made this several times since my original review and love it. I always use chickpeas instead of chicken. I sometimes add artichoke hearts. Be sure to use fresh lemon juice, it makes it. I didn't use all the oil & balsamic so mix and add to your liking. Thanks, Colter! This is a keeper and will be highly recommended!

Delicious - There are so many different complimentary flavors in this dish - I left out the chicken - the quinoa is very filling on its own - may use less lemon juice next time - this was great!

I dont usually review things but i HAD to review this. SO DELICIOUS!!! I changed only a couple things. 1. I used chick peas cause I hate chicken. 2. I used sundried tomatoes cause I hate kalamata olives. 3. I added some cucumber cause it was in my fridge. And it was FANTASTIC! Made a huge batch and have been eating it for lunch and as a side for dinners!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the parsley and salt.  The only tedious part was all the chopping, but it only took one cutting board, a knife, and a little bit of time. My boyfriend also thought it was delicious and appreciated how healthy it was.

This was good but I thought the lemon flavor overpowered the other flavors in the salad. That being said, I will make this again because it's a good and healthy option for lunch.

This is a great idea and you can adapt it.  For ex., I found that lime juice works great.  Add cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro, and cumin if you like, and try making lettuce wraps using this salad.  Delicious!

This is very good as is. However, if I may make a few additions for a more "authentic" Mediterranean style salad: tomatoes and Persian cucumbers. Also, 2/3 cup of lemon juice is too much. The juice of 1 lemon (about 1/4 of a cup) is sufficient. Instead of the chicken, I used garbanzo beans. Thank you for the recipe!

I had never heard of quinoa before this recipe. Cooking the quinoa with the boillon/garlic is a MUST - it tastes terrible/bland without it. Any mediterranean ingredients just make the dish more awesome. I like to add diced tomatoes and pepperoncinis.

I loved it. I made it as is, but used yellow peppers as that is what I had on hand and took the advice of another and used chick peas instead of chicken. Delicious. The flavors seems strong at first but by the evening and the next day the flavors blended and it was even better. I will definitely be making it again.

Packed with protein and full of bold flavors - the whole family agreed this was phenomenal!  I left the garlic in (there wasn't anything left to remove after simmering/resting) and eyeballed the dressing ingredients.  Just a tip: after simmering the quinoa for ~15 minutes, remove from heat and then cover until all the remaining water has been absorbed.  Then remove the lid and fluff for perfect quinoa every time.

Excellent flavor! Used chicken broth and half of the quinoa, added chick peas, roasted red peppers (not fresh green), fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, fresh cucumbers and artichokes. It's a keeper!

Excellent! Don't skip making this just because you don't  have fresh herbs on hand. I didn't have any fresh so I used dried.  Didn't hav chives at all and added dried basil.  I was making this for a vegetarian group so the quinoa was cooked in salted water only.  I made it for a group of 80 people for their buffet and this was the first to run out.  They LOVED it!  So did I, YUM! Very flavorful.

This is very tasty.  I made it with regular black olives instead of kalamata and threw in some steamed zucchini I had leftover.   It was eaten at room temperature but I think it would be great cold or reheated in the microwave.

This is a great salad.  Quinoa is so good for you and this is a wonderful way to eat it.  I went the vegetarian route, using a can of rinsed garbanzo beans instead of chicken.   I also poured the lemon juice on to taste, and ended up using much less - maybe 1/3 to 1/2 a cup.  Will definitely make this again.   Thank you!

Love this.  Took it for lunch on the combine today.  What a treat.  Being 40 miles from town I made due with the veggies I had on hand.  Had all the other ingredients.

This was a party in your mouth!  We used it as a side dish alongside chicken.  We didn't have fresh lemon juice, so we used it from a bottle, but boy was it fantastic.  We wouldn't change a thing.

Perfect! I subbed garbanzo beans for the chicken and left out the chives (because I had none).  I also added some halved grape tomatoes to stretch the salad to feed more people and my tennis team loved it!  The dressing tasted way too lemony by itself, but when it was mixed together with everything it was really delicious.  Made it the evening before and it was still very fresh tasting when I finished up the leftovers at the end of the day.  I would suggest mixing everything together and then adding dressing to taste:  mine didn't need all of the dressing.  Delicious!  Try it as is, or add a couple of your favorite ingredients (may try sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts next time).  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great light summer salad. I had to make a few substitutions due to my ingredients on hand. I did substitute the red bell pepper for green added a tbs of fresh basil and one large cucumber. Amazing. I placed this on a bed of baby spinach and it completed it perfectly. Already looking forward to leftovers.

Yep, this is pretty fabulous. I had something similar at a baby shower recently and craved it so much that I was super delighted to find the recipe here! 

I used chicken stock instead of water, used pre-cooked rotisserie chicken, and added a red pepper.

This is so delicious that my non-olive eating significant other said I was allowed to make this again and again. Thumbs and big toes up. 

Will be adding this to my go-to potluck recipe book (although, it's so good, I kind of don't want to share). Thanks!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this!  I did make some changes: 

1. boil chicken for 30min, add salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder to the water and use the left over water/broth instead of the bouillon 
2. use 1/3 red onion 
3. omit bell pepper 
4. add marinated artichoke hearts 
5. 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar 

voila! Enjoy RC

I LOVED this!! The flavors were marvelous. I sauteed the onions with some mushrooms before adding them, just to cut down on that harshness of raw red onion. I left the pepper raw to give it a nice crunch. I'm not a fan of kalamata olives, so I substituted sun-dried tomatoes. I cut down the lemon juice and oil as well. This was melt in your mouth good! I had it warm for dinner and later on in the night I had to go back to the fridge and sneak a few bites of the cold leftovers..It was just as scrumptious!

Super versatile and tasty recipe.  Here is what I did:  Used chicken broth.  Instead of discarding garlic, I chopped and added back into salad.  Used 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice/ 1/8 C. olive oil and 1 Tbls of Balsamic.  Added:  Cuke, shredded carrot, baby tomatoes, & chopped fresh spinach.  NO salt or olives.  Used more feta.  Will serve cold, but tastes great either way!  Will make again!

This is a delicious salad.  I have made it twice now, once with chicken and once without.  Like other reviewers, I half the lemon to 1/3 c, use yellow onion instead of red since I never have it on hand. I don't like peppers, so I add sundried tomatoes & chopped spinach.  For ease, I make the quinoa in my rice cooker with chicken broth.  It has wonderful flavor that  my whole family likes, even the picky eaters.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe and ate it all up in two days. From reviewers suggestions, I left out the chicken this time, used just 1/2 red onion, cherry tomatoes instead of bell pepper, added cilantro, cucumber, garbanzo beans. Left out the salt. Used juice from 1/2 lemon, 1T balsamic, and 1T olive oil. And a box of Quinoa with roasted garlic and olive oil. I plan to make this for a dinner party in a few weeks.

This was good but had WAY too much lemon juice for us.  I didn't add the chicken because I didn't have any but followed the other ingredients exactly.  After tasting it, I made more quinoa, doubling it to make up for the missing chicken (too much sauce) and it was better but WAY too lemony so I added some sugar and a little more oil to counteract it.  It was much better.  My husband likes it a lot but I think it is just O.K.  Next time I will definitely cut the lemon juice in half!

One of my husband's favourite recipes, although I like it less mostly because it takes SO long to prepare.  15 minutes???  I'm not exactly slow but it takes me well over a half an hour just to do the prep work.  Overall prep and cooking time is more like an hour and a half.

The lemon juice, balsamic vinegar and olive oil combo needs tweeking as it is too much for this recipe.  Add a little at first, you can always add more later.

DELICOUS! I was making this as a side dish so I didnt add chicken pieces. I also didnt have bouillon cubes so I cut the water in half and used 1c of chicken stock from the can. Turned out wonderful, the next day I had a bit of left overs and sauted some sausage threw it together and was a great 2nd time around meal! Ive already recommended it several times!

My first time cooking quinoa and it was delicious! Used red bell pepper but used all the other ingredients but to my taste. Ate some warm at lunch then cold tonight with warm naan bread. Fabulous and filling. Will make often and add other veggies as well.

Excellent flavor. This dish adapts beautifully for holiday buffet luncheons. I used half green and half red bell pepper for extra color. Very good dish.

When I made up the dressing and tasted it, I seemed way too lemony. But it turned out fine. I made this a day ahead of time. I was using as a side salad so I swapped chick peas for chicken. I added some basil.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments based on other reviewer's comments. I honestly think that 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice has got to be a typo, there is no way that you could add that much lemon juice to any salad and have it be edible. I ended up only using 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I didn't use chicken, and instead used shelled, cooked edamame beans to add some protein to this salad. I only had a yellow bell pepper, which worked out well, because I really wanted to add cherry tomatoes and ended up with a very colorful, tasty, healthy salad

This is sooo good! I hate when people leave a review that says all the ways they changed the recipe, but I'm going to do it anyway because I think this is a very flexible recipe and can be good as made or with modifications. I left out the chicken because I wanted it for a side salad but I can't wait to make it with chicken. I also didn't put in as much onion because I felt it would overwhelm (for my tastes). I'm eating the leftovers right now for lunch and it is still just as delicious! I can see this being in our regular rotation, even making a big batch at the beginning of the week to enjoy for lunch several days. I also really liked the flavor of the quinoa cooked this way with the boullion and garlic and will probably always make it that way from now on. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Loved this!  Modified quite a few things because I didn't have them.  I was looking for something like tabbouleh, but with quinoa.  

Used leftover cooked quinoa - plain - so not bouillon or garlic.  Added dressing - red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  No peppers or chives.  No chicken.  Let sit for an hour or more in the fridge to blend flavors. So yummy!

I love Quinoa and all it's versatile recipes. I especially think this version of a salad is great. My family loves it, especially cold. But maybe this winter we will eat it warm.  I have changed the ingredients for our taste buds with cucumber & carrots along with the red bell pepper as green pepper bothers me. Other than that it is a tasty, healthy, & filling salad.  I use this for any pot lucks and it gets great raves! Keep finding other Quinoa recipes also!

Love it! I made it vegetarian by using faux chicken and veggie boullion. I also used a little less lemon juice. Really delicious :)

Holy moly! I don't generally enjoy quinoa but made this recipe to humor my husband.  This was absolutely incredible; so full of flavor.  I also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and added diced cucumber. The lemon flavor is intense, so use less lemon juice if you'd prefer the salad more mild.  I thought it was excellent.

This was my first time using Quinoa.I know it is so healthy so I prepared this recipe. What a wonderful surprise! The blend of all of the flavors are oh so wonderful. My husband loves it. This dish would be a great compliment to any potluck or BBQ. This is sure to be my new summer favorite!

This was delicious. I replaced the chicken with a can of garbanzo beans to make it vegetarian. But 2/3 cup lemon juice??!! That's insane. I barely used 1/4 cup.

This is pretty good but could be way better. I added quite a bit more parsley and wanted even more. I cut way back on the lemon juice but it was still too much. I also wish I'd bought cherry tomatoes to add in, they'd add a great pop of juicyness. Thanks for the recipe; it's a great idea and I'd make again with my changes.

definitely cut back on the lemon juice (I prefer 1/2 cup) and only used 2 TBS olive oil.  I was out of chicken one time and it was still good!  Another comment, about the red onion....I used approx 1/2 - 2/3 cup finely chopped red onion.  Also, I have never included the green pepper...just seems like that wouldn't taste very good in this dish.

I don't know what happend, but I did not care for this recipe and couldn't serve it to the family. I followed step by step, and couldn't understand why it tasted so... sour. To those who make this, I would suggest using less of the vinegar and lemon juice.

Loved this and it was super easy to make - my husband agreed that it was a "nice change of pace". I did change a few things - I marinated the chicken breast ahead of time in a Greek marinade; boiled the quinoa in chicken broth instead of the bouillon; only added half of a purple onion (it was plenty); and left the dressing on the side. It would probably taste even better then next day if I had added the dressing and let it soak, but my husband gets acid reflux from too much oil and lemon juice. 

Oh, and I added a can of garbanzo beans for even more protein. I'll probably make this with veggie broth and just the garbanzo beans (omitting the chicken) next time so it will be vegan for my sister.

Very flavourful.  I suggest that the lemon juice be cut down to 1/4 cup otherwise it is very sour (to my taste).  Then increase the balsamic vinegar slightly as well as the olive oil.  Really great...with or without the chicken.  Great for healthy eating.

Flavors are great, but I thought it could use a little less oil and lemon.  It was also a bit mushy, which didn't make it look very appealing.  Will definitely make again with less oil!

LOVE this recipe and have made it many times. First time followed the recipe exactly and it was good. Now I make it with a few changes and it's even better. Cook the quinoa in chicken or vegetable broth. Leave out the chicken. Use yellow instead of green bell pepper. Add chickpeas, shelled edamame, halved grape tomatoes, cucumber.

I skipped the green bell peppers, and in place of the kalamata olives, I used chickpeas. Delicious and light--I will definitely make again.

I made this last night and had some warm (which was excellent!) and brought it for lunch today served on a little bed of fresh arugula. It was excellent!!!
I substituted the chicken with lightly sauteed crimini mushrooms and onions. I also omitted the bell pepper since I hate them and the salad turned out DELICIOUS! I love the flavors and the texture. This was my first time making quinoa and I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I passed on the salt since I figured the feta was enough salt for me. And I cooked my chix on the grill and served them beside the salad with pita, so we could make little salad/chicken sanwhiches as we ate. I LOVED it. I will certainly make this many more times, and love the use of quinoa! Quinoa is delicious and adds a super texture.

WOW! This is so yummy! I made this salad for a pot luck tomorrow and I'm hoping everyone loves it as much as me. I basically followed the recipe - and also added cherry tomatoes and cucumber to make it even a bit more Greek.

This was delicious as a main meal. I made the quinoa in veggie stock instead of chicken.  I didn't add the chicken, parsley, chives, or oil (on a diet) and instead added some cooked shrimp and then on a whim, stirred in some garlic hummus.  Yummy.

Wonderful when something this good for you also tastes really good.  Thank-you for the suggestion to replace olives with sun-dried tomatoes.  I've never liked the taste of olives, so the sun-dried tomatoes gives the salad the kick it would have been missing without either of these ingredients.  I had compliments at the potluck I brought this salad to as well.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I have been experimenting with Quinoa in an effort to eat healthier.  I've realized I prefer it cold, so I made this cold.  Everyone at the party loved it...even people who didn't like olives.  I love knowing it is healthy and it had so much flavor.  It was very easy to make too.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking to make a healthy, satisfying, great-tasting side dish.

Watch the serving size on this recipe - I believe it would serve 4 as a main dish salad, rather than 8.  I didn't want any leftovers, so I made 1/4 of the recipe (supposed to serve 2) and there was only enough quinoa for one person.  I had to cook another batch so that there would be enough for the two of us.

Other than that, it was delicious!  I did make a lot of changes, though, based on our food preferences and what I had on hand.  I used roasted red pepper instead of green, skipped the onion, added fresh tomatoes, used fresh basil instead of chives, and skipped the salt (it was plenty salty!).  The combination of flavors was delicious!

I make this salad frequently and love it more and more each time I make it. Its a very forgiving recipe and you really can't mess it up.  I do not add the chicken and use red pepper instead of green  pepper.  This is a very refreshing and healthy salad. Quinoa is a wonderful source of fiber.  Thanks for the recipe

Outstanding!  If you like tabouleh salad, you will like this.  Super healthy too! I left out the chicken and I only needed half of the lemon juice/olive oil as the recipe called for.  Also, I used organic chicken stock instead of bouillon and water.  Served room temperature and it was great!

This was pretty good...not something I'd crave, but fresh and healthy.  I used red quinoa so it was very colorful...might like it better with a little more feta.

This is SO tasty! After mixing it up as the recipe stated it seemed WAY too saucy, so I cooked another cup of quinoa (as per the bag's instructions: 1 Cup to 1 1/4 Cups water) and stirred it in. I would recommend going a bit easy on the lemon juice and onion, but that's just my personal taste. I threw in tomatoes and cucumber pieces too for crunch, and served it cold. Delish!

This is a delicious salad, a crowd pleaser and good for buffets since it can be served at room temperature.  I added some wheat berries to the quinoa; they have to be cooked separately though.

I love this recipe! I wanted a recipe to try quinoa for the first time and this one looked pretty good. My whole family absolutely loved it! It tastes even better after it's been sitting for awhile to incorporate the ingredients. Super yummy!

I made a vegetarian version for a party and it was great!  I also used a mixture of white and red quinoa which made for a very pretty presentation.  My guests, most of which are picky meat lovers, thought it was fantastic.  The best part was trying to explain what quinoa is, lol. Have made several times since.

My only change would be to add less red onion. Perhaps mine was too big, but i would go with 1/2 and add more if you want! Amazing recipe, will make this all the time.

Very good dressing to finish the quinoa.  I used the veggies I had on hand; red onions, mushrooms, shredded broccoli and carrots, and sundried tomatoes.  I didn't have any of the fresh herbs so I used dried and it still came out great!  I think the balsamic/lemon/olive oil really make it special!  Don't forget to soak your quinoa before you cook it!

Yum! I left out the lemon juice because the tartness of the olives, feta, and balsamic were enough to wake up the taste buds. I tasted after mixing everything but the lemon, and it would've definitely overwhelmed it and ruined it. I didn't have green pepper, so I used red bell pepper and a half a jalapeno, seeded. I didn't have kalamata olives, so I used green. I added some chopped spinach, mushroom, left out the oil, and used chickpeas instead of chicken. This recipe is great that you can make ingredient tweaks and it's still a yummy quinoa and veggie dish, that's nicely seasoned. I'll try it with chicken sometime for sure. **Just an update: I made this for the full 8 servings, and have been eating it all week. You probably shoudln't do that. :P Unless it's lasagna.

Thank you so much for this absolutely delicious and healthy dish!  Made it earlier in the week and am making it again as a side dish for our superbowl party this weekend.  I desperately needed something healthy amidst all the typical superbowl snacks.

This is a great dish and keeps well in the fridge.  We usually use it as a salad topping over mixed greens.  Sometimes it is a tad too sour for my tastes but the wife loves it!

My husband absolutely LOVES this recipe! I didn't use all of the oil and balsamic because the lemon seemed like it was a LOT. I also used Inca Red Quinoa, not sure how different it is from regular. He says he has been craving these flavors which he can't find in restaurants here. So I've been ordered to ensure that there is always a portion of this in the fridge (I served it cold with roast chicken) Delish!

This is a great base recipe that I have used for many years with changes.   I cook the quinoa in the same manner as rice.   I add a  1 clove crushed garlic to the water or chicken broth before cooking.  I add the feta right after putting the cooked quinoa in the bowl.   I use whatever veggies I have on hand.  I soften 1/2 of a red onion in olive oil before adding to the bowl.   Chop all, stir together.   I often leave out the parsley and chives if they are not on hand.   I like to add black olives, roughly chopped, 1/2 a cucumber, 1/2 red bell pepper and chickpeas.     I use 1-1/2 T lemon juice, 1/4 c olive oil and 1-1/2 T balsamic Whisked well to the mixture.   I like everything to sit at least 4 hours in the fridge before serving.   Always a hit!!!!

I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth with a couple of smashed cloves of garlic....added all the same veggies (except a red bell instead of green) I used shrimp instead of chicken - reduced the lemon juice and it was amazing....

Absolutely delicious! So fresh tasting and satisfying for a one dish meal. I didn't have chicken so added 2 cans of cannelini beans which was perfect! I will make this again and again for sure and will bring it to the next potluck. Thanks Coulter :)

I cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker with chicken broth and minced the garlic, which turned out great. I had to use regular olives (bummer-the other olives would be better) and didn't have the chives on hand and I only used 1/2 of the lemon juice because that was what I had on hand. This would have been a better salad if it didn't have so many onions in it. One whole red onion is WAY to much, and we had to pick them out of the salad in order to eat the salad.

"One large red onion" is extremely arbitrary - if I used a large one here in Florida I'd have about 2-1/2 cups of chopped onion.  Otherwise quite good.  Try a garlic ramp instead of the chives if in season.  I prefer red pepper over green myself, but that's just a preference....

I made this and it is ok. I don't have chicken broth so I used vegi broth and the qeniou seemed too wet and mushy for a salad. I only squeezed in 2/3 of a lemon because of how wet everything was and I added 3 cups of mixed greens. I also didn't have fresh parsley and used dried parsley instead.

This is a really refreshing summer recipe.  I love it as is or sometimes I change the vegetables in it to whatever I have on hand.  The only change I alway do is cook the quinoa in homemade broth not bouillon cubes and water to reduce the sodium in an otherwise healthy recipe.

Fantastic flavorful recipe! Layers of flavor & texture are delicious. Added grilled (cubed) chicken & substituted sweet red/orange peppers for the green bell. I was reluctant when my other half suggested this, but I was pleasantly surprised. We'll make this frequently.

This is a great substitute to your boring old pasta salad!  Everyone who tries it, loves it!  I don't typically like red onion, but it is a really nice addition to this dish.  I also substitute cucumber for the bell pepper (as i'm allergic).  You won't be disappointed!

Delicious! I eliminate the salt.  Between the feta and the olives, there is no need to put additional salt in this.

Hubs loved this; DS picked at it, DD said 'it's okay...', and I thought it was a bit too lemony. We resolved to make it again when the kids are away at camp. Summary: it's a keeper for adults, but not for kids.

A very nice salad with lots of flavours and textures. I omitted the salt with the thought that the olives, broth and feta would add enough and used chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes for more flavour and less salt. Which accomplished the task. I also, made and used the entire helping of the dressing but will use about 3/4's of it next time, my preference. Used rainbow quinoa, multicoloured quinoa, instead of the mono-colour quinoa just to add more colour. This recipe is now in my recipe box. Thanks Coulter!

The concept of this is pretty good.  I thought there was too much lemon in it and the quinoa didn't quite cook with all the water.  Personally I loved the quinoa with ONE bouillion.  it was so tasty. I think 2 would have been overkill IMO.  If I made it again, I would cut the lemon down for sure and add more green onion. I didn't measure anything but I only had 8 kalamatas and that was plenty.

Like many of the other reviewers, I amended the recipe to what I had at hand, leaving the base recipe intact--quinoa, a viniagrette dressing, feta, and olives--if we are still looking for a Mediterranean feel. My adds and changes were: chick peas for a different starchy texture, white instead of red onion, and some garlic powder in the dressing. I didn't mix in a protein, but it serves well with the white meats--fish, pork, chicken.

Oh my goodness... DELICIOUS! I originally planned on refrigerating my salad before I eat it but I haven't even finished cleaning up and I've already served myself a bowl. Really great combination, even if you do end up making substitutions. First I put the dressing ingredients on, but I found that a little too vinegar-y so I added a little drizzle of one of those Greek Kraft dressings and together they work perfectly.

Great recipe! No need to change it.. but you can also play with flavors of red bell pepper vs green, cucumbers would also be good.. but I did add crushed red bell pepper to give it some spice

I thought this was a great salad! I used a red pepper and green, I used a half cup of lemon juice. I cooled the chicken and quinoa before mixing.After mixing,I folded in the Feta as not to break it up.

Wow this was awesome and very easy to make! I didn't have red bell beeper or feta cheese but used Parmesan. I sautéed the kale with some copped garlic. This is definitely a favorite.

This was really good.  I used olives from an Italian deli & they were a little too salty.  So next time, I'll either rinse them or not put the salt in.  And, personal opinion, I liked it better without the lemon juice.  It's still good with it, but I'll omit that next time.

YUM! I've been searching for a quinoa recipe I liked and this is it!  Made it mostly as written except did not use chicken (didn't have any on hand) and used a red pepper instead of green. Will try it with the chicken next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was out of feta cheese so I used 1/4 blue cheese instead as it is pretty strong, and it turned out to be great. Also I added cumin which gives a nice flavor to the salad.

Fantastic. I used chicken broth but didn't add the chicken because I wanted it as a side. Everyone loved it. If you're looking to try quinoa or if you're already a fan this is a great way to prepare it. Delish!

Holy cow, this is excellent! I used slightly less lemon juice based on other reviews, no salt and more olives. I also added cherry tomatoes on a lark. I like it better hot than cold but if you do what I did and add the cherry tomatoes, wait awhile after you microwave it to bite into one.

I made this recipe exactly as written! My whole family (of men) loved it. I made it as a side dish, but decided that it was better served as a meal. So we wrap this up in flatbread and eat it like that. I've never made anything with Quinoa before, so it was great find! A keeper!

Rating this recipe AS IS gives it a 3 only because the lemon is overwhelming.  I also did not see the need for that much olive oil.  We solved the problem by cooking up 1/2 c more quinoa to dilute the taste.  If you like to stick to the recipe exactly as printed, I would add lemon and olive oil to taste. After that, the great thing about this recipe is that you can really change it up to suit your needs.  Some of the best suggestions submitted by other readers were to add cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and chick peas.  I did all three and loved it.  Also, I eliminated the olives and substituted and red pepper for the green with fabulous results.  I would absolutely recommend this recipe (and give it a 5 with the lemon/olive oil changes) as I think it is very versatile and easily manipulated to make every family happy.

This is such a great and versatile recipe. I make a veggie version using celery, green onions, garlic, parsley, grated carrot, tomatoes and olives...superb! It goes well with so many different dishes and we really enjoy it. Thank you for such a great recipe!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe, but agreed that it could use way less onion.  Red onion is quite powerful.  I even doubled the recipe and used only one onion.  I am not sure we could have eaten it if I had only made one batch.  I will be cutting the onion back to 1/2 red onion next time.  It was very delicious despite the overpowering onion taste.

Great recipe for a summer dinner.  Light and satisfying with lots of texture and layers of flavor.  Next time I will add a little less lemon juice, as the dressing was a little too citrusy.  My very picky six year old really enjoyed it, which is a rarity.  Overall, a great salad in which we will do again.  Thanks for the recipe.

UH-MAZING! This is my first time writing a review, ever. Like others on here I adjusted and added to my family's taste... I used chicken stock instead of water + 1 smashed garlic clove to the stock + quinoa, with 8 minutes cook time remaining I added canned chick peas (drained the chickpea water) to the stock and allowed the stock to evaporate and do it's thing. Removed quinoa from heat and added cilantro (instead of parsley) + chives + olives + sun dried tomatoes + feta. I prefer cooking my veggies so I sautéed red onions + 2 minced cloves of garlic, allowed it to sweat a little, added bell pepper + salt...once cooked to my liking I added it to the quinoa mix. This recipe tasted good even without chicken or the vinegar/lemon/olive oil mix. Def will make this for a larger gathering, thanks!

This recipe was very tasty.  I used only fresh, brined kalamata olives and feta cheese from my local Greek grocer to give it a more authentic Mediterranean type of flavor.  I was concerned at the amount of lemon-balsamic dressing that I put on the salad, but the Quinoa had absorbed all of the liquid in a matter of hours.  I did however, use just under 1 cup of lemon juice for the dressing because I didn't want to waste the extra I had left, so next time I will stick to the recipe's amount of 2/3 cup.Instead of using green peppers, I added some color by dicing the bottom third each of a red, green & yellow pepper.  The peppers were cold & crunchy, I seasoned the chicken breasts before cooking, & I used fresh lemon juice, not the bottled kind, and served it cold.
I've been storing quinoa in my pantry for a few months now waiting for just the right recipe to try it out on, and this was it.  All in all, it was a hearty, tasty authentic Med-style salad.  Thanks for your contribution, Coulter!

Used less lemon and salt then called for. I think you could also only use one bouillon cube.

We liked this recipe but make sure you only add half of the lemon juice!  It is too tart and lemony with the full amount.  I made some changes, added diced cucumber and quartered grape tomatoes.  I left out the red onion and bell pepper.  I only added 1/8 c. of oil too, to make it even more healthy.  It was yummy but next time I will adjust the lemon juice as I mentioned above.  Chickpeas sound yummy in it too! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Great cold salad!  I made it vegetarian.  Added chick peas, red pepper and artichoke hearts.  Next time I will use VERY little olive oil, if any--1/4 cup was too much.  We love feta cheese so I doubled the amount.

I absolutely love this salad!!  I make it without the chicken for a quick lunch all week.  I also do half the lemon since the rest of my family doesn't care for lemon like I do.  If you are a lemon nut like I am than it is perfect the way it says!!

Seriously enjoy this recipe. We make it often. I have also made several variations of it as it is easy to play with. For a quieter version for preggo tummy and toddlers, I leave out the lemon and balsamic vinegar and just add olive oil to taste. Have used canned chicken. Also, I use chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube and that is tasty as well. A red or yellow bell pepper can be used for a sweeter flavor. Again, AMAZING recipe, easy to play with, keeps very well! Makes a great picnic meal.

Very good!  I left out the chicken and added cucumbers, subbed green onions for red onion, yellow bell pepper, and halved cherry tomatoes, hearts of palm.  Didn't really adhere to quantities in recipe - just made a huge batch.  I also didn't use this dressing, I used another greek dressing recipe from this site.  Yummo!  Definitely adding this one to the rotation.

OMG! This recipe is delicious! I've never had quinoa before and had picked some up at Trader Joe's.  When I came across this recipe I knew I had to try it.  I don't like onions or bell peppers so I left those out, but instead I added garbanzo beans, a tomato, and a cucumber.  I also cut back on the lemon and cooked the quinoa in chicken stock. It turned out so yummy that I can't wait to make it again for my mom.

My whole family of five (including 3 teenagers) faved it!!  I cut back on the lemon juice a bit, didn't have red onions, but the yellow onion worked great.  My 15-year old asked if we could have this every week.  It's a keeper.

Once I added the lemon juice the quinoa became mushy and the lemon overpowered the nice, rounded chicken bouillon taste. All that work to have the lemon juice ruin it. Very frustrating.

This was a great healthy dish, and very tasty. I added chickpeas and one chopped tomato. Only put juice of one lemon and left out the olives as i did not have any on hand. Hubby loved it and he normally does not like quinoa. I will make this again, for sure!!!

This is great!  I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store and roasted red peppers instead of the green pepper.  Very lemony...but very fresh tasting.  The whole family loved it!  I served it over butter lettuce to boost veggie intake!

For me this was a great starting point for what I wanted and it turned out great, I basically made a greek salad and the rest of these ingredients to make a fantastic salad, I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and crushed the garlic and left it in the salad after it was done, I didn't use the fresh herbs or the chicken, I wanted to have the chicken on the side and next time I will cut back on the fresh lemon it was a little too much I guess because it's fresh, this is a great salad, thanks for sharing it...

Absolutely incredible!  Next time I am making a double portion-- it was gone in a flash!  I did omit the salt because the kalamata and feta make it salty enough.

This is a tasty, simple, and healthy recipe that doesn't get boring. The only modification I made was to add sun dried tomatoes, but it's awesome without.

I made this (without the chicken) for a wedding reception and it was absolutely fantastic. It is really high in sodium, so those with high blood pressure or heart problems should avoid it - sorry! It IS even better the next day, if there's any left.

Delicious. I made it as written but without the chicken.  I think next time I will cut back the lemon juice since it had quite a strong lemon flavour by day 2.  A nice refreshing summer salad.

WOW! If you like mediterranean food, don't pass this one up! 
This recipe is wonderful and will be a staple for us, especially through the summer! I didn't have any fresh parsely or chives so I omitted those, omitted the chicken (already had a main dish) and used minced garlic instead of a whole clove. Next time I'll add those herbs as I'm sure they can only enhance the flavor even more. FANTASTIC!

This salad is so amazing, always a hit with everyone who tries it. However, too much red onion (I only use a half), lemon juice (about 1/3 cup), olive oil (1-2 T) and not enough balsamic (1/4 cup). That's my taste and most love it!

Good!   Used regular black olives and fat free feta....will buy reduced fat or regular feta next time. The fat free was kinda strange tasting.  Other than that I love quinoa salads. Loved the fresh parsley and chives. Thanks!

Really good!  Made this for Christmas but I think it tastes even better a few days after making. Reduced lemon juice just to taste. Used chicken broth instead of bouillon because that was what I had and used red bell pepper instead of green. Makes a pretty side dish and is filling too!

Delish...I went a bit overboard with the Kalamatas and Feta and the salad came out a bit salty...I also grilled the chicken with lemon pep and garlic salt, good!!  Can't weait to make this salad again.  Also, I smoked some weed the next night and got the munchies so I made some nachos and added some of the leftover salad on top and it turned out soooooooo good.  Cheers!!

This was a very yummy recipe.  I did omit the chicken since it was going to be a side dish for my family.  I used half of a green, red and orange pepper because it's what I had on-hand and it made for a very pretty presentation.  I served it warm with dinner and then cold the following day with lunch.  Definitely will make this again!

Pretty good. Found it slightly dry. I wanted more dressing I guess. I also threw in grape tomatoes, cucumbers and skipped the chicken. The quinoa is plenty of protein for a meal in itself.

So good. I'm not usually a green pepper fan, but they're perfect in this. I made it without the olives since I don't like them, but my boyfriend mixed them in to his dish and said it was really good.

This is so simple and really filling! We made it w/o chicken, and it still filled us up. We also cheated and just used Newman's balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing, omitted lemon juice. We found the parsley to be a little strong. Could just be us though. Will make again, and again, and again!  :)

I left out the chicken, and the olives, but added a diced tomato and cucumber to keep with the Mediterranean flavors. I also added some fresh lemon zest to make the lemon flavor pop. Overall a great dish! A quick, easy and light summer meal that I would definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Followed the recipe with the exception of cooking the Quinoa in a no salt added chicken broth (it doesn't need the sodium).  Next time I'll try cutting the lemon juice a little bit and will add more feta to taste.  This is going to be a new staple in my diet.  Thank you for posting!!!

This is a great salad to make for a light healthy meal. I was looking for something to make with leftover chicken breast when I stumbled upon this recipe (as a bonus, I had quinoa I wanted to use as well); this recipe was a winner for me because I had all the ingredients on hand. I made a few substitutions: cooked the quinoa in chicken broth rather then water + boullion cube, red bell pepper in place of green, goat cheese in place of feta and I also added a few grape tomatoes. Although I added balsamic to the dressing, i feel that it was not necessary and I wouldn't add it in future. Overall, it's a yummy salad that I'll be making again and again, but I do have to say it's very reminiscent of many salads I already make with cousous, rice, quinoa, etc, probably because it has a winning combination of wholesome ingredients.

This was very tasty!  I used chicken broth and a yellow onion I had, although I would recommend the red onion to add color.  I also put spinach leaves on top, which added to the flavor.

I find that most recipes for quinoa have too much water - in this case I used 2 cups quinoa and 3.25 cups water, but there was still too much water - the result of this is soggy, overcooked quinoa that sticks together in lumps. what u want for a salad is more dry quinoa, since you'll be adding dressing and moist vegetables at the end.

I've made this many times and it is delicious. I can vary it with different vegetables; this time I lightly steamed asparagus and spinich and added it to the salad. I agree with one reviewer that the lemon is a bit strong. Next time I'll try it with 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice (instead of 2/3) and see whether that makes a difference.

This may be a second review, if so, after several years its still a 5-star side/salad for me.  This is a great base recipe that can be changed a bit depending on what I have on hand. I always reduce lemon juice to juice of one lemon.  Today I omitted chicken, up’d the kalamata olives, added one cup of halved grape tomatoes and about one-third cup grated queso cojita cheese.  Delish!

Followed the recipe.  Used Chicken Bone broth instead of water and cubes.  Used two large cans of chicken.  Fantastic!   The blend of flavors is indescribable!

I made this for an after-church luncheon a couple weeks ago and received several compliments! I was afraid it would be too tart, with all the lemon juice, but it wasn't. I actually didn't measure the juice, I just juiced 1 good-sized lemon. I followed someone else here's suggestion for adding a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas. I made it the night before the luncheon and the flavors blended wonderfully overnight. I'll make it again as soon as the weather warms up!

I made this exactly as directed and found it to be outstanding. I will definitely make this again.
With that said, it may be easier to use stock instead of the bouillon cubes as some have suggested, and it could be tweaked in hundreds of ways to suit ones specific tastes, because it is, after all, a salad. But, this recipe as written, is great.
Thank you.

My kids and I love this salad for lunch about once a week.  

We love the flavor combinations  and I'm happy that we get to sneak quinoa into our diets a bit more regularly now.

At first we thought the lemon juice was overpowering, but after letting the salad sit a few minutes, the lemony taste was reduced.

I make it as written, although sometimes I add a bit more feta or olives than called for.

Very good, but thankfully I only had 2 lemons.  If I had used anymore I would not have been able to eat it. I omitted the green peppers, chicken and olives and reduced the red onion. Will make again with this variation.

Yum. The balsamic and lemon are what I think did it for me. Delicious!! And really adaptable to personal taste, which lends itself to fun experimentation.

Came out amazing (with some changes)! 

I only used the juice of 1 whole lemon, I would start with half a lemon and go from there.

I marinated 1 lb of chicken breasts in olive oil, lemon juice, red chili flakes, and S&P. Then I cooked the chicken in a large pot, set it aside, and cooked the onion and green pepper in the same pot. Mixed everything else together according to the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly how it instructs you to. My family and I all felt that the lemon flavor was really overpowering. I couldn’t finish my plate, so my mom is going to add grains or something else into this to level it out. It was a pretty good recipe other then the lemon juice just being to much.

It is rare that I find a recipe that I can imagine throwing together on a regular basis. Healthy but satisfying and easy to adapt. Not much harder than a box of mac n cheese.

Love this as a main dish. I also used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes to cook the quinoa, omitted the salt (didn't need it, IMO) omitted raw onion (not a fan) replaced with cucumber. Fresh lemons are a must.

My first time trying quinoa and it came out great!  It was very flavorful. I would go a little lighter on the salt next time. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was a touch too salty.

We love it.  DH wanted tuna steak for dinner, and a salad.  I found this recipe and I used everything but cucumber, red onion (used chopped green onions), no chicken, I chopped garlic (3 of them) and left them in the salad.  I used boxed chicken broth, dried chives and parsley (didn't have fresh), lime juice (bottled) b/c had no lemons, and used waaaay more balsamic vinegar than called for...I added sliced avocado on top...also I chopped orange and yellow bell peppers...and no carrots (too lazy).  Next time I'll add black beans, I believe and leave any meats out.  The rest I used exactly as written.  It made a lot and we really liked it.  Will most def make it regularly.  Great recipe, Coulter...we thank you.

This recipe is fantastic! Either as a side or  main dish. I subbed a can of italian style tomatoes for the puree and chopped tomatoes. Goes well with all kinds of meals

I've made this a few times for parties. Always a big hit. So easy; so good. Like others, I'm a vegetarian and made some changes - no chicken and use vegetable bouillon. When we have vegan guests, I simply put the feta cheese to the side since I haven't been able to find a vegan version of feta yet. I've also found a few tweaks I like - lighter colored quinoa presents better - looks more appealing.  I use a little more lemon juice and whisk that with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and then drizzle over. I also omit the green peppers because few around me like them. I bet in the cold version, cucumbers are a good addition.

I decreased the amount of lemon juice to 1/3 cup and it was plenty lemony for me.  Serve red Tim Tom a non quinoa lover who happened to stop by at dinner time and she loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

Substituted 15 oz. can of garbanzo beans for the chicken and used 1/2 the amount of olive oil.  Wonderful!!!  Served over a green salad.  Shelton Cabernet Franc pairs well.

I liked it but I do love Quinoa and the Tricolor Quinoa is the best for some recipes.  I added some toasted sliced almonds to the dish for a nice crunch and added flavor.  Plus added a little more vinegar than it called for.  Just make sure it doesn't make the dish too wet.  

Love or the ingredients so couldn't go wrong with this one.

This is a great recipe although I omitted a few ingredients I did not have on hand such as the chicken, chives and I changed the olives for green ones.  I loved the lemon taste of the vinaigrette.  It was awesome!

Excellent recipe.  I made it with what I had on hand, so there were various substitutions, but not enough to change the base of the recipe..  What made it for my family was the large quantity of lemon juice.

Great day 1 and day 2.  Finish it before day 3.
Delicious as written.  I added chopped and seeded tomatoes and diced cucumber.

I think green olives would be fine subbed for kalamatas if you don't have them available.

Next time I may make half the recipe.

Easy to make vegetarian, and is inherently gluten free!  The recipe is flexible -- I added diced cherry tomatoes and cucumber, and left out the chicken.  I cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock and omitted the boullion.  Delicious and healthy- thanks!

I am vegetarian so I left out the chicken. Also, I didn't add the feta cheese because  I didn't want it to get mushy in the fridge so I add the feta separately each time I serve it. I cut the lemon juice down to 2 T. I also added roasted pine nuts and diced cucumber and it was really good!

I just finished making this and it's sitting out for a while to merge the flavors. However I've had a couple spoonfuls and I think it's very good. It does have a little bit of a sour vinegar/lemon taste but I didn't add much lemon juice to it so I think it's the red wine vinegar.  I also added a teaspoon of dried oregano and I didn't have parsley so I just added some spinach. 
I steamed some green beans and put those in along with some diced red pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes.
I had no problem with it being gummy or soupy like some complained of. If it's soupy...cook it longer. I cooked mine 20 min as per the recipe and it came out fine.
I will most likely make this again but, I have to try more of it later on and to see what my husband thinks. He hasn't had any yet.

While making this salad, I was dubious: shouldn't I be sauteeing the onions and peppers?  Isn't that an awful lot of lemon juice?  As it turned out, I was wrong on both counts and the recipe ranks five stars in our household.  The lemon juice made the salad.  I used minced garlic and left it in the salad instead of discarding it.  I thought there was enough onion flavor already, so I skipped the chives.  A few minor changes: I used yellow onion instead of red because that's what I had on hand, used red bell pepper instead of green, and used cilantro instead of parsley (the latter two changes due to personal preferences).  We enjoyed it and it'll be added to my permanent rotation.

Wow! I have a new favorite. This is so freaking good!! The only thing I did differently was to substitute fresh basil for the parsley and chives. I did use chicken.. I cooked it in a skillet with olive oil and Greek seasoning. Someone suggested chickpeas instead of the chicken. I'm trying that next. I could live on this and nothing else!! Yummy!!

YUM!!!!  This salad was delicious.  I used red, yellow and orange mini bell peppers because I don't like green and I also seeded and added a tomato (the picture shows something red diced up in it, but nothing red was listed in the ingredients).  I also used tomato & basil feta cheese and my leftover Costco rotisserie chicken .  It had so much flavor, almost didn't need the dressing.  I made it last night and put it in the refrig and we all had it for lunch today.  So tasty!  My daughter doesn't like bell peppers, so next time I may substitue the bell peppers for a seeded cucumber.  Will definitely make again.

I used the vegetarian better than bouillon, which is now a staple in my pantry. I also carmelized the onion and pepper in a small amount of olive oil prior to adding to the quinoa because I don't like either vegetable raw. It was so delicious! It's definitely become a lunch time staple.

I made this for an event for 100 people.  They all loved it - there wasn't a single kernel left over.  I multiplied the recipe by 20 - but I limited the balsamic vinegar to half of the required amount, which ended up being perfect and not overwhelming.  Great dish!!!

Very very good.  We have had a very hot summer here in Southern Ontario.  I made this for a picnic lunch.  It was excellent served in romaine lettuce leaves (like a lettuce wrap).  Nice to get away from mayo based chicken salad.  Also tasted great hot the next day.  Only change I would make would be to cut down on the lemon juice but taste it as you mix for your own liking.

Made it without the chicken chunks, parsley and green pepper because I didn't have them on hand. Made the Quinoa as directed on the package so adjusted the water quantity as well. The person I made it for LOVES quinoa salad and really liked the feta cheese addition. The chicken bouillion really added a nice flavour that my guests just couldn't put their finger on but loved. Making this again today!

I love this salad!  The crunch of the fresh vegetables, saltiness from the olives and feta, with the tanginess of the lemon juice make it outstanding.  If you like Mediterranean flavors, this is the salad for you!

I used half chicken stock liquid and water to boil Quineo.  Used zucchini, green onions, yellow pepper.  Used about half and half of lemon juice and olive oil, tablespoon of balsamic mixed liquid and veg while Quineo cooking.  Then added feta and fresh mint.  LOVELY.

Loved this recipe. There were only some minor changes I made. I omitted the parsley and vinegar (because I forgot to add it in) and I didn't use that much lemon juice, probably only about 1/2 cup. I took another reviewers suggestion and added in sun dried tomatoes, julienne. Since the tomatoes are packed in oil I didn't feel the need to add the olive oil in because it coated the mixture enough. I then sprinkled the feta when serving rather than mixing it in. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

I made this dish with red quinoa which  I prefer.  I did leave out the garlic but used the same veggies, feta, and olives.   I used Knorr's tub vegetable stock (our store did have vegetable bullion), left out the lemon juice and soy sauce and just poured on some balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

Really flavorful! I used 1/2 the amount of lemon juice like several reviewers recommended. I also threw in an entire can of drained black olives and didn't bother to chop them. I used a sprouted grain/quinoa mix and it gave it great texture.

Ok, I did make quite a few changes!  
I used the entire bunch of parsley ( trying to clean out fridge!).  I added a cucumber, 2 tomatoes.  Omitted the feta and olives.  Added dried mint.  The large amount of lemon juice I thought would be a waste.  I cut it down to less than 1/3 lemon juice.  I added 2 tsp rice vinegar instead of balsamic.  I am kinda getting tired of balsamic.   I also just cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of using buillion, and added minced garlic instead of just smashing a clove.  I like garlic!  Didn't use chives either.  It tasted just like tabbouleh!

My cardiologist recommended a Mediterranean diet as part of my 'Lifestyle change'.  Found this recipe and several others in the Mediterranean diet section.  This was delicious!  I didn't have a green pepper so I used a red one.  After tasting it (rating it!!),  did add a few things.  Mixed in a cucumber and a fresh tomato then slices of avocado on top of each individual dish.  Yummy !

I made the vegetarian version (grilled Mediterranean chicken on the side) basically as shown.  Though we loved the dressing, it was way too much for my family's taste - the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.  I halved the amount, then only tossed in about half of that - serving the rest on the side.  Great salad!  Next time I'll probably add grape tomatoes and English cucumber.

I made this delicious salad and I only added a fresh tomato to it.  My picky husband who hasn't liked quinoa before actually liked and said he would eat it again.  It has a wonderful citrus flavor. 
We loved it.  I served it at room temperature.

Okay, the lemon was waaaaay too overpowering here (this is a common complaint among reviewers). That's my biggest complaint. Also I would've sautéed the onion with the garlic... altogether "meh" wouldn't recommend

I used a cartoned chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon. Then I added fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. I don't think the recipe state to use curly or Italian flat leave parsley, but I used the flat leaf and a lot of it.
Also, I was being lazy and bought a roasted chicken from the grocery store and used that! Easy and delicious.

This is so yummy and healthy. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I was out of chives so I used green onions and used dry parsley instead of fresh cause thats all I had. It is extremely tart so when I make it again I will only use 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice. Will make often!!!

Made it for me, but turns out it's so good that the entire family enjoys it!  Even the person who was originally not a quinoa person.

Definitely something worth trying!

I left out the chicken and made it just for a side. I had a couple of lemons but not enough so I used lime juice so was a bit tart but still delicious! I am going to make it a second time today.

This is a great and adaptable recipe.  Like others, I reduced the lemon juice to the juice of one lemon.  Also thought 1/4 cup was a bit heavy on the olive oil. I added drained chick peas instead of chicken.  Another great addition is chopped fresh spinach.  Really though, I think this is the kind of recipe that you can play with according to what's in your fridge or pantry.

This was a wonderful dish! I followed it almost exactly. I used dried herbs instead of fresh and red pepper instead of green. We ate it all up in minutes! Why does the picture show cucumbers and tomatoes in the salad when they aren't listed as ingredients? I should've added those too! Needs a little more feta.

This is an excellent salad. Cutting back a bit on the lemon as others have mentioned works fine and is simply a matter of adjusting to personal taste.  I also added in different types of peppers.  Overall, this is one of my favourite salads!

Didn't add the chives or the olives.  Just didn't have them to add.  Otherwise followed the recipe relatively closely, substituting a viidalia onion for the red onion and a red pepper for the green one.  Added 1/2 cup lemon juice rather than the suggested amount because I ran out.  I don't think we would have wanted any more added if I'd had it to add, however.  It was slightly tart with just 1/2 cup.  I liked it pretty well.  My husband said it was ok but he wouldn't want it regularly.  He offers high praise often, so I tke his praise, when guarded, seriously.  I think it is a solid 4 star recipe.

Great recipe! I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I just cooked the quinoa in chicken broth.  Works the same, I think. I added extra chives from the garden, red peppers, and artichoke hearts.  I also marinated the chicken first.  I used slightly less quinoa, which is mort to my liking, but overall this is a recipe that is VERY tasty and easy to make!

Great flavor!  I made a few changes: I put in half a red pepper and half a green pepper, substituted red wine vinegar for the balsamic vinegar and put in less lemon juice based on reading a few other reviews commenting on how over powering the lemon juice was in the dish.  We added some fried shrimp to our dish and my husband and I gulped it down.  Really great, easy, fast recipe!

Took the time to make this recipe and I am totally satisfied with it. I used red bell peppers and chickpeas instead of chicken and green peppers but otherwise I followed this recipe to a t. This is definitely going to be something I make often! I'd add cucumber as well :)

Omg, my boyfriend and I are obsessed!!! I think it's the flavor of the quinoa boiled with the chicken cube and garlic mixed with all if the other ingredients - especially with the lemon juice! I also really love olives, especially the Mediterranean ones....so, I added about a cup to a cup and a half chopped to give it more flavor. We followed this recipe to the tee...I ended up buying a lemon herb rotisserie chicken for the 2nd time of making it and it turned out amazing. This recipe takes about an hour to prepare....so, I'd advise doing it on a weekend or when you have a lot of time. Also, we did not have this warm....we prepared and then stored in the fridge overnight....it's just super delicious with all of the favors!

Much better as a cold side dish . I suggest making ahead of time and refrigerating immediately. This recipe is brilliant AS IS. You can't say it's good if you omitted the onions... this salad is mostly raw onions . If you don't like raw onions you won't like this recipe. Also, red onions are so much better to eat raw than yellow . Just follow the recipe!! Not a big fan of olives but I used them and I'm still obsessed with this salad. Delicious and healthy

This was amazing!It was also the first time I ever prepared any dish using quinoa.. so it was fun, and.. my  family loved it! Even my Dad who tends to be picky with "foreign"  food, loved it.

Sooo good and defiantly making again.
Also, I didn't have any bouillon cubes, so I just added an extra garlic and some turmeric to the pot.
I also added a little bit of fresh thyme and 1/2 of the onion instead of the whole thing.
It came out fantastic!

Overall, I like this salad, but there was too much raw onion for my taste and the dressing made it too tart (even reducing lemon juice to 1/2 cup). The recipe has potential, but I would make many alterations next time. There seem to be many good suggestions in the other comments.

A really great recipe! I have served this both as a hot dinner entree, and as a cold salad for summer picnics. Extremely well received both ways! I omit the bell pepper, but add in an avocado and cucumber. Chop both up and mix in right before serving. Delish!

Way to much lemon juice. I may scrap the batch of I can't find a way to salvage it. Next time, maybe 3/4 Tbsp. Up until I added that though, it was shaping up rather nicely.

Way too much balsamic vinegar for me!  A little disappointed because I think it would be good with half the amount.  I'll leave it out next time.  Other than that, it was good.

Yummy!!! I love it!  We serve it alongside a salad of spinach, chopped tomato, chopped cucumber and marinated artichoke hearts.  It all ends up mixed together and I love it that way but this recipe is great as is and you don't need to add or change anything.

Delicious!  The acids are really well balanced, and the dish is bright with a lot of textures.  It really handles alterations to the recipe as well (I hate olives, but it stood up well without them).  Play with it yourself!

I made it with rice instead of quinoa, and added the salt to the rice as it cooked. I fried the chicken cubes in a lightly olive-oiled pan. I thought a large red onion would be too much, but added it anyway -- I was wrong -- this salad had so many flavors it was amazing. I love it. 
Next time 
- I will mince the garlic and cook it with the rice/quinoa
- blue cheese would work for me in this salad

This is a fantastic recipe. I call it my vegetarian hypoallergenic potluck salad (if you use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth). Just make sure to cut back on the lemon juice. Start with 1/4 the amount in the recipe and increase to taste. The first time I made it I had to add sugar to cut down the tartness. Every time I make it people ask for the recipe.

I've made this recipe several times now. The first time I made it exactly as written. I thought the flavor was way way too strong. I did not care for it at all then. Luckily for me I know I like this salad (I've had a version elsewhere). I made several changes now- I use cucumber, quinoa made as stated, orange green and yellow pepper, red onion. I omit the rest as I don't care for olives or chicken in this salad. For the dressing I add roughly 5 TBSP lemon Juice and 2-3 TBSP olive oil and 1 TBSP balsamic vinegar. I know this is quite a difference from the original recipe however I didn't much care for the original and rated it as such. The good thing is I got my recipe from tweaking this one so it's a win

I didn't like this recipe at all.  Way too much lemon juice and didn't like the flavor of the red onion.  I think it would taste better if the onion was sautéed with some garlic then added to the cooked quinoa and use only a quarter of the lemon juice.

Very good flavors but the dressing was a bit strong so I only used about 1/2 of what the recipe calls for and it was perfect.  I also omitted the Feta since my husbands and GI tract are not fans and the chicken because I was using it as a side.  It had enough zing even without the Feta.  I have added it into our rotation.

Made this with less lemon juice than listed and it is still very overpoweringly lemon flavoured. Hoping it tastes better after sitting for a while.

Sorry, I wasn't a fan.  This can't compare to the Mediterranean Barley Salad.  Since the quinoa is supposed to be so good for you, I may try adding some of it to that......

This was outstanding!  I used red peppers, green onions, and green olives, b/c that's what I had and what we prefer.  I didn't measure the dressing ingredients, just squeezed half a lemon, drizzled about 1/2-1 T. of olive oil, and a T. or so of balsamic.  So healthy and yummy!

Maybe I over cooked  the quinoa, but I carefully measured and the quinoa would not absorb all of the broth, so I let it cook longer than 15 minutes. In any event, after all the chopping and measuring of all the beautiful vegetables, after it was assembled it looked gummy and disgusting and there was no way I could serve it to my guests. I will not make this again.

I make a double batch of this recipe every few weeks, have it for dinner and then take leftovers to work for lunch.  It stores well and love it cold.  I add chickpeas and sometimes cucumber.  If I add cucumbers I do so just before eating, I do not feel they store as well.  I also use half of the olive oil.  Love this recipe!

a wonderful recipe and a crowd pleaser. Could be served as a side dish or a meal by itself. Next time ill be adding some cherry tomatoes, more feta cheese, and a tiny bit more olives.

Very tasty and easy to make... but be careful, it can be very salty because of the olives and the feta. Rinse the kalamata olives very well before chopping and omit the salt.

This was wonderful!  Have never made quinoa before so I think I should have left it steaming a few more minutes to dry out more because my salad came out wet even without all the liquids(which I had combined).  It didn't bother the taste though or turn people off, this was a hit at a potluck.  I did add halved cherry tomatoes and cucumber, left out the chicken.

Very refreshing for a hot summer evening's meal. Even better the next day, after all the dressing had been absorbed by the quinoa. I made adjustments based on what I had in the fridge. Added cucumber and sun dried tomatoes, used green onion instead of red. I prepared it as a side dish for grilled salmon, so I left out the chicken. Next time I'll include the chicken or even tofu for a main course. Yummy!

I've been meaning to make this recipe for ages but with a new baby it's been tough to find the time.  Finally got around to it today and it is fantastic!  I did swap out the green pepper for a red one as we don't care for green peppers, and used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  I also added a handful of chopped basil as there's so much in our garden right now.  Whole Foods makes a quinoa salad that I'm addicted to and this comes really close!  Will make often from now on, baby or not :)

We really enjoyed this recipe! We made it ahead of time and let it cool in the fridge, making it a perfect dinner in hot summer weather.  We also decided to add tomatoes and black beans to it and loved how it tasted and looked.  The only reason it didn't get a 5th star is that it was a bit time consuming with the chopping required...but with some planning ahead, it is pretty simple to make!  We will definitely do this one again!

Made this for my 1 yr old Granddaughter with chicken.  She loved it, I loved it, and her parents wanted the leftovers I sent home with her for a couple of meals during the week. I did take it a little easy on the pepper & onion, but easily added more to my serving.  Delicious, healthy & easy.

LOVED IT. This was soo good-I made it true to the recipe but my family thought that it had way too much lemon. I will make this again for sure but will decrease the lemon, use half the bullion (husband has trouble with salt) and go with it. the flavors of the olives (do not skimp...use the kalamata for sure) really do make this dish-I put this on the top of my grilled balsamic chicken rather than mix it in so that i would have control over the amount of chicken i got...my kids tend to pick it out and leave me with none..very nice-

I agree that the lemon flavor really overpowers this recipe.  It is better chilled, in my opinion, since that way the lemon is a little less offensive.  I will probably make it again and experiment with the lemon and balsamic to find a ratio that is more appealing and less like sucking on an actual lemon.  I really like the individual ingredients.

I used yellow onion, instead of red, because that is what I had on hand and red onion is always a bit strong for my taste.  Initially, I made this without the chicken and even adding only half the dressing, it was way too soupy.  I then added some chicken, hoping to  help the consistency.  My husband and I liked it (my daughter ate several bites and my son would not try it), but a little goes a long way.  Next time, I will try using red onion and few less olives.  I will also add the dressing a bit more gradually to avoid the soupiness.

This is my first "rate".  I served it for Mother's Day since it seemed so light and healthy.  My provincial relatives (what is QUINOA??) all enjoyed it and I loved it.  I used my fresh leftover lemon juice from my homemade limoncello at Easter, and that was the only change in the recipe as written - used about 1/3 cup plus a tablespoon or so, rather than the full 2/3 cups.  You have to try this!  Easy, just a bit of time for chicken and chopping...

Is there a way to award this 10 stars? I cannot say enough good things about this dish! It's so exotic, flavorful, and unique! I came up with ONE thing that could make this recipe better: using half the amount of onion and green pepper. Anyway, this recipe is a keeper.

Took this to a Mother's Day cookout yesterday (made it without the chicken)...It was light and refreshing, but everyone thought the lemon overpowered everything.  I will make this again, but reduce the lemon by maybe 1/2 to 2/3.  I saw other ideas about adding chickpeas, cucumber, etc. and will probably try those additions also.

This was good.  A little too lemony for me - I might cut back on the lemon juice next time.  But I liked the blend of flavors and a good solid side dish for those who like this kind of thing (we left out the chicken and used veggie broth to make it vegetarian).  Thanks for the recipe!

SO SO SO GOOD!  I just emailed the recipe to all my friends.  I didn't use any salt, a little less olive oil, and skimped out on the chicken (but will definitely try it with chicken next time).  Tasty, tasty treat!!

Love this recipe but will defiantly make it with half the lemon juice next time.  2/3 c is a little too much.  Great lunch that you can make in the beginning of the week and have a cup each day!  Easy, and healthy!

This is awesome and I look forward to taking to work for lunch.  Reduced lemon juice to three lemons and only needed 1/4 cup olive oil.  Red bepper in lieu of green gave a great sweet/salty flavor.

So good!  I've been trying many new recipes lately, as a new vegetarian.  (In this recipe I substituted chickpeas for the chicken and used a vegetarian boullion replacement.)  Many of the recipes I've tried have been good, but not as good as I had hoped they would be.  This one, however, delivered!  It was very good and exceeded my expectations.  I will make this again!

Loved this! I mixed the dressing but honestly used about a tablespoon..I the salad has so much flavor it doesn't need much! I threw in some torn spinach and used yellow pepper. My new fav salad...

Once the quinoa was cooked, the dressing looked like way too much. So I only used about half of the dressing (lemon juice, olive oil, vinegar), and none of the salt since the chicken bouillon seemed to add enough salt flavor. I also used chickpeas instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. With those changes, I quite liked it. My husband didn't care for it much so it might not be for everyone, but I would make it again for myself.

easy and very good.  this was the first time my family tried quinoa and there were no leftovers.  will use a little less lemon juice next time even though my husband thought it was great the way it was.

Fabulous recipe! Substituted red bell peppers for the olives and vegetable bouillon cubes for the chicken bouillon cubes. I also omitted the chicken as I forgot to take it out of the freezer in time. Excellent dish, got rave reviews.

This recipe would be great as is no doubt.  I did make a couple changes though.  I added 16 ounces of chicken, artichoke hearts, and cucumber.  I also used red bell for a more mild flavor.  This was amazing!

We loved this! The only change we will make is to reduce the red onion by about half - it seemed like too much. Otherwise perfect! My vegetarian daughter was willing to eat around the chicken so we all enjoyed it.

Fantastic! So light & fresh. I only used 1/4 red onion & cut the olive oil back a little. Will definitely use this as a go-to meal esp for company because it's different.

This was very good.  Great for packing for lunch, too.  I'm not sure you can make a healthier meal, either.  Very balanced and fresh.

Very tasty!  I sauteed the onion and pepper with the chicken and served the salad warm.  Also used dried parsley and chives.

Definitely will be made again.  I forgot to pick up bell pepper at the store and so subbed cherry tomatoes instead.  It is a great base salad to which you can make all sorts of substitutions.

So easy... so delicious! Didn't add onion first (didn't want onion breath):) and still yummy! Also filling for a main dish. Made a big batch and got better and better!

I love this salad.  I couldn't get any feta (small town in Mexico) or olives.  But it still worked out great!  The fresh lemon juice makes it a great summer salad!

Loved this recipe! Like everyone else, I made a few adaptations - no chicken because I plan to use as side dish, no peppers because they don't agree with me, used half lemon and half lime juice. With all those omissions only used 1//2 the dressing - saved the rest for the next time, which there definitely will be!

This turned out well but was kind of cacophonously flavorful.  If I try it again, I think I will cut back on the lemon juice, and possibly also the olives, since those two tastes seem to overpower the more subtle flavors.

I like this recipe however I think the two bouillon cubes is too much. There is enough salt with the feta and kalamata olives. Also, I used much less olive oil, just drizzled a little bit in there and it seemed perfect. And I added some grape tomatoes.
