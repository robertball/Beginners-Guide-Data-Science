This recipe is very good.  I have made this dish several times before finding this version (most of them are alike, with small exceptions).  I have always used Reblochon cheese - it is regularly available here in Monterey County, California, at the better cheese shops.  Yes, Brie works - but it often has an ammonia smell/taste which is never the case with Reblochon.  This is a great side dish, easy to make and pleasing to almost everybody.

Well, whats not to love about carbs smothered in cheese, creme and bacon?  I think this is a good recipe.  I had this a few times when I was in France and it is fabulous treat after a day on the slopes or while sipping on a Sancerre on a cold winter's night in Paris.  I had to go to 3 cheese stores to find the Reblochon because brie just isn't the same.  Having said that, probably isn't necessary.  The one thing I would change to this recipe is blending a glass of white wine (a Sancere or Sauvignon Blanc) with the creme fraiche.  Also, I don't think it needs to be cooked for so long at that temperature.  If you want it to bake quicker, put it in a 450F oven for 17-20 minuts uncovered.
