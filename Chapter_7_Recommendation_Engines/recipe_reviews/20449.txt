Broiled instead of frying in margarine and it was terrific! Use fairly thick fillets and broil about 6-8 inches from element. Remove when golden brown& check for flakiness. Great recipe!

This was sooo good, flakey and moist! Very simple. I can only imagine that the person who burned it had the temp up way too high as I had, if anything, too much margarine. I can give one note, I bought "pre marinated" lemon pepp. catfish from the local Raleys (always very fresh there). I also added just a pinch of salt to the flour mixture. I would DEFINITELY serve this to my in-laws..and that's sayin' something! Thanks Hallie! P.s...this was my fist catfish..2nd fish!

Okay, tasty catfish, but, heavens, I can't see the need for *4* eggs.  One was plenty for the 2lbs of catfish nuggets I used.  And had leftover breading as well.  I would decrease the breading and probably up the cornmeal ratio also.  Used a mixture of butter and oil for frying.  Fried up nice and quick and browned easily.  Good fish!

This is very easy and it's a wonderful way to prepare catfish.  I suggest adding salt to the cornmeal mixture.

a fat siamese cat was sitting in the kitchen while i used half butter and veggie oil. i was mixing the mixture while the cast iron pan heated up, when thunder struck very close by. i'm pouring lemon pepper in the plastic bag to shake my catfish strips up and the cat fleabag attacks. i think only about 3 tablespoons of lemon pepper jumped into the bag. so,...4 stars... use more lemon pepper, use cast iron, use butter/veggie oil blend and rent a storm-scared siamese cat to help you judge the extra amount of lemon pepper needed.

This fish had a great coating. I used butter to fry and it turned out great. I would probably add more Lemon Pepper tho if that is the flavor you are looking for. 1 TBS does not give it much lemon pepper taste.

I followed the directions, and somehow the fish still ended up burning on the sides as I flipped it. I think the recipe called for too much margerine.

Good---made a few days ago with SCI hushpuppies. I used oil instead of margarine to fry, and I used less flour and more cornmeal + some Italian style bread crumbs. Very close to my fried catfish recipe.

This recipe was a hit with the family, even the picky little eaters.  Really, 2 eggs were sufficient for the 6 fillets I made, and I used only 3/4 c of flour and 3/4 c of cornmeal, just because that's the texture/taste I was going for.  I also added about 3-4 T of lemon pepper seasoning, due to the recommendations of the other reviewers.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with PAM, and sprayed the fish with a light coating, too.  I broiled about 8 minutes, flipped them, sprayed that side of the fish lightly with PAM, and broiled another 8 minutes or so, til they were golden, crispy, and flaked easily with a fork.  Overall, very tasty with that "fried" fish feel.  Thumbs up! :)

The only changes I made were to use butter instead of margarine, and I added a little Cavender's seasoning salt to the cornmeal mix. Quick, easy and pretty tasty. Thanks, Hallie!

Absolutely the family favorite! I tried this on the catfish that my husband caught and its great. It will be the only breading that I will use on fish from now on. Add more lemon pepper if you want a more robust lemon-pepper flavor. That is what I did and it's delicious. Thank you for sharing as I have been searching for the perfect breading batter.

This is a very simple recipe, I didn't use margarine but butter instead, and no cornmeal. Instead I used bread crumbs and dipped the fish in along with the rest of the mixture. It turned out real crispy and nice!

Very simple choice for making basa(catfish). Next time will add more lemon and salt as it lacked some flavour, and try another cooking method. Overallfairly good recipe.

I used cod (I think) instead of catfish.  This dish turned out excellent.
I would cut down on the flour & the eggs though, so much went to waste.

This recipe has MUCH too much breading and egg listed. I used 1/4 of it and still had leftover. I kept the lemon pepper at the original amount, but still did not get much flavor from it.  My only change was to broil it rather than pan fry, but that should not have changed the outcome. We ate it, but it lacked flavor and I had to throw away a lot of breading.

Tasty, but like another user noted, I somehow ended up burning some of the filets (first one turned out great). At medium-high heat, the butter seems to turn a brackish color which I assume is causing the burnt fish. This is probably a sign that I need to back off the heat a little.

My husband liked this recipe, but I thought it was ok (probably because I like red fish more than I do white fish).  I had a problem with the breading falling off the fish as it was cooking.  I had huge catfish filets and added about 1/2 tsp salt to the cornmeal/flour mixture.  I used the same amount of cornmeal and flour the recipe called for and this was more than enough for my large filets.  Next time I will use more lemon pepper seasoning.

I had never even eaten catfish before, much less prepared it for my family but since (a) I've always heard it was delicious (so I've been long-term curious), (b) catfish nuggets were (short-term) available at a ridiculously low price in my area, and (c) I had recently purchased ground lemon pepper spice, I thought I'd give this recipe a try. And it was good. Probably VERY good (even EXCELLENT) if you are a "catfish person" (which is why I gave it 5 stars). But my family wasn't particularly impressed. For us, it was the catfish (not one of the 5 of us liked it). But the recipe is good and, therefore, not to be faulted. So while I probably will not be making catfish again any time soon (if ever), I will, in likelihood, be using the recommended coating, seasoning and cooking method the next time I prepare flounder or sole filets.

I love this recipe, it goes great with any kind of fish. I love the lemon pepper, I'll never use another recipe for my fish. Thank you.

You don’t need so many eggs.  And let the fish sit in the eggs for  15 minutes or so before dredging.  And we like more of the lemon pepper.  But it is the best catfish we’ve ever had.  Tender and just spicy enough.  Crust nice.  I make it on my NewWave burner to keep a consistent temperature.  The only way I’ll fry catfish!  Thanks to the sharer!

Being new to cooking catfish, I was thankful to find this recipe! Quick and easy, and full of flavor! Great crusting without being  deep fried. This was perfect for a quick weeknight dinner!

I really did not like this at all. The flavor was very bland. Thanks for posting though.

This was really good!  Very simple and tasty.  The only change I made was adding more lemon pepper.  I will be making this again, for sure.

Great for a casual quick main course, I used suggestions from other reviews and added salt, used 1 egg. Turned out great, although I think medium-high heat is a little much. The breading is great!

This was very, very good. I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal. This is a recipe I would highly recommend due to its ease and great flavor.

I used this recipe with tilapia, and my family loved it. We've had it once a week since I first tried this. I do agree with adding some salt to the flour mix, and also a little bit of lemon juice on the fillets before coating. Thanks!
