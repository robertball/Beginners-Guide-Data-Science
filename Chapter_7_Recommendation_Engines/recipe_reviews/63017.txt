This cheesecake is very good considering it is a sugar free and it left no after taste. However, I found using the "reduced fat" versions gave the cake a much more crumbley texture which I find unappealing in a cheesecake. I made a second batch, using regular full fat dairy, and the results were much better. I also used some of the strawberry sauce and swirled it into the cake before baking, which helped give it a bit more moisture. Still a very good cake.

I am not sure if I cooked this too long but it was very dry and almost flavorless. This is my first cheesecake I have ever made, so I don't know when they are done. When the timer went off, I used a toothpick to see if it was done and it came out a little wet. I left it in for another 5-10 minutes after the timer. If I try this recipe again, I will cook it a little less and if that doesn't work, then try regular cream cheese.

This is an AWESOME cheesecake, you would never know it is low sugar.  I did find the reduced fat vanilla wafers & used those.  Good plain or with fruit topping
