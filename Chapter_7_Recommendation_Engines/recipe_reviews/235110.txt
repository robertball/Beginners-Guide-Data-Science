I'm not quite sure what to say about it.  I made it very carefully.  I didn't follow all the measures and I used green pepper instead of the red and yellow. I was making for one.  I had it marinating for about 11 hours and decided to have a taste.  Couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.  I must like it, because I have been back to the frig at least 6 times for another couple of spoons.  It would be rather nice at a buffet for a party.  I don't know whether it changes anything, but my mussels  are not bigger than a large thumbnail.  Oh I forgot, I did add pepper.
