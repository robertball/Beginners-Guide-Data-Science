This was really good and super easy. Instead of a garlic clove, I sauteed about 1/2 tsp or so of minced jarred garlice and I used a 1/2 stick of butter rather than just the cooking spray, and I added 2 cups of chicken stock/broth rather than 3/4 cup (I was cooking 6 pieces of boneless chicken breast). I also squeezed in the juice of a 1/2 lemon (we like lemon), using the pampered chef lemon citrus squeezer. Then I thickened it just a bit with some corn starch.  Truly tasty! (By the way someone needs to replace that truly terrible picture of raw-looking chicken for this recipe.)

A very easy delicious recipe. Here are my changes.  I started with 2 garlic cloves and I used lime juice instead of lemon juice as I didn't have any lemons.  It tasted great.  I only used 2 large chicken breasts for this recipe.  I thickened the sauce with 1 tbsp. of cornstarch just before serving.  The cooking times worked perfectly.

I made this recipe tonight with some of the reviewers changes. I used 2 cloves of garlic, olive oil to saut√© garlic and dredged chicken with flour, cayenne and salt and pepper. Lemon juice 1/3 +cup( they were in ice cube form) Chicken cooked  about 10-12 min and added cornstarch to sauce. Very lemony. Served with mushroom and spinach salad(also from this site) will make again

The chicken I bought was thin, so I had to adjust the cooking times drastically---almost just 8 minutes in total.  I don't spray my skillet, so I used a little lemon olive oil for the "browning."  The broth I used was from the bones from a chicken I roasted using Roasted Chicken Rub by Semigourmet from this site, so it did have quite a bit of flavor to it to begin with.  I usually also use Papa's Seasoning also from this site as my salt and pepper.  So all in all I did follow the recipe in my mind!  I almost cooked out all the broth/lemon juice at the end, and I would have liked a little more if I'd have used vermicelli as suggested by the submitter of the recipe.  This is a simple but tasty meal easily done in a short time!  I'll do this one again, but I may just have to add a little butter to the broth in the final steps!  Thanks, Karina Mitchell!

Delicious! I followed other reviews and used the juice of one whole lemon and increased the garlic.  I first dusted the flattened breasts with flour, salt and pepper.  They took  about 10 minutes in total to cook through.  I removed the breasts and added the garlic to saute for a few minutes then added the broth and lemon juice.  I also added some cornstarch to the sauce and poured it over the breasts.

Tasty and tender and not a bit dry. So simple, even a teenager could make it without too much complaining. This one definitely goes in the rotation!

The chicken turned out well, I just needed to make a few adjustments to make it work. I had to cook the chicken for nearly twenty minutes because they were fairly thick. Due to the longer cooking time, I had to repeatedly add more liquid to the pan to keep the garlic from burning
The lemon flavor was not strong at all, if I was going to make lemon chicken, I would add some lemon pepper.

Great recipe!
I tried it first with only small modifications - I like to use pureed garlic and olive oil instead of fresh garlic and Pam. It was awesome! Unfortunately I over-salted the chicken a bit which didn't matter at first, but I warmed up leftovers by chopping the chicken in pieces and warming in the sauce, and it was too salty.
I made it again this weekend and used less salt, but I threw in about a TB of capers as well (I love capers!) and it was again awesome.
Really easy and quick, and only a few ingredients!

Family favorite now. I added corn starch in the pan with the sauce & chicken to thicken the sauce & it stuck to the chicken better. They thought I made chicken francaise & put all this work in. 30 Minute meal & definitely delicious. (Only got a pic of the leftovers it was so good).

I was worried that by cooking the garlic first it might get brown and therefore ruin it...and it did get brown. But didn't ruin it! Very tasty! Thanks for posting the recipe!

I did not read the reviews before I made this and I agree with at least one of the reviewers that write this is very bland. hardly any lemon taste to the chicken at all. if I had read reviews and changed a bunch of things like more garlic, more lemon juice, corn starch to thicken then it would have been much better but then would I actually be reviewing the true recipe something to think about for those of you that have this 5 stars but noted all your changes.

I did not care for the recipe at all. It was bland. The chicken breasts did not seem to absorb any of the lemon or garlic so they were just bleh. Would not make this again.

I enjoyed this. Just a few changes... I used olive oil instead of cooking spray. I used the juice of one whole lemon, but that may have been too much. I used a full cup of chicken broth and added a pat of butter and a tablespoon of corn starch. This was easy and tasty.

I made it as written with the exception of how the garlic was handled (see following), and was very pleased with the way it came out. So easy! The garlic flavor is very mild, so I plan to add another clove next time. I do recommend that you either saut√© the garlic in the oil and then remove it until the chicken is browned, or add it near the end of the browning  stage to avoid burning it.

Made a couple of minor adjustments. Used 2 cloves garlic, added some capers with the broth and added about a tablespoon of cornstarch after the chicken was removed to make a creamy sauce. I also had to use bottled lemon juice which didn‚Äôt harm, but fresh lemon juice would be better.

I followed this pretty much to a T. Not our favourite... the sauce tasted really bad. Not sure why.

I‚Äôm on my third day cooking‚ÄîI wish there were clearer instructions on how much salt and pepper to ask. I guess I‚Äôm still shaky on cooking without actual measurements. It turned out okay though. Half the table enjoyed this meal, half found it alright. Added a touch of oregano but other than that kept it as is. It was good for a quick fix dinner.

The only change I made was to use a dry chicken bullion powder in water instead of the clear broth.  It was easy to make and very tasty.  Will definately make it again.  Was a family hit!

So easy even I could do it.  Turned out delicious and recipe was perfect.  Nice lemony taste with a hint (not knock your socks off) of garlic.  Will be a staple of mine.

SO DELICIOUS! I made it and it had tons of flavor. Both the lemon and garlic came through and they balanced each other perfectly.

I used 5 chicken breasts I cut in half. I seasoned them with lemon pepper and salt. I doubled the broth. I added 2 Tbs cornstarch to 1/4 water to the broth after boiling for 5 minutes. Returned it to a boil for another 3. It turned out to be a nice light gravy. Everyone enjoyed it.

I had to use a lot of butter, and I used chicken with bones in it, so I had it cooked longer, but over all it was amazing!! This is something I will make again!!!

Turned out great! Nice and moist! Used 2 garlic cloves and a full lemon instead and added tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce at the end like the other reviews suggested and it worked very well, thickened the sauce perfectly. Will definitely make again!

Super easy and super tasty. I added lemon pepper and a touch of Dill.  I also thickened the sauce as others mentioned, with a tablespoon of corn starch. Served all over a bed of tricolour fusilli, accompanied by a green salad. My husband I agreed that it was a keeper.
