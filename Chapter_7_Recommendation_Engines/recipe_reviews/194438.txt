Very good. The second time I made this I added 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tsp mustard, and 1 tbs lemon juice. Both ways are very good.

Fantastico! Used white onion, but otherwise followed the recipe (with cucumbers). Great flavor combo! Kind of a lot of work with all the  chopping, and I only made a 2 serving salad. Wasn't a big deal, since we had it with take out pizza, but if i was making other dishes, I would keep with a more simple salad! Thank you!
