My family makes this recipe for holidays & they love it.  I don't care for the cream of mushroom taste so I made it w/ all half & half.  Everyone loves it even more now.

This was a great tasting dip! The anchovy was a little strong tasting and I will use half next time. Will make again and the possibilities for dipping items is endless.
