This bread was very easy to make!  I have been making my own bread for some time now....and this is a wonderful recipe.  It helps to put a pan of boiling water on the rack UNDER the rack the bread is on.  It makes a nice chewy crust, with warm soft bread on the inside!  Thanks for sharing this receipe:)

This is an easy recipe, with guananteed results. I do add 2 tsp. sugar, and melt the butter instead of cutting it in, and it tastes terrific. I love that it has no milk in it, and since I've made this several times I can honestly say it's always cames out great. Nothing worse than bread that doesn't rise, and that just doesn't happen here. Thanks!!

This bread was yummy, but not as wonderful as I was expecting. It was my first time making bread, so it's possible that I did something wrong! Tastes great with honey drizzled on top.

This was my first project, and I'm a novice bread-maker...I found the recipe simple, easy to follow, a bit more time consuming than the times given, but it delivered a massive, wonderfully textured loaf...am very glad to have found the recipe!

WONDERFUL!  My family loved this bread, from the 2yr old to my husband. It was much easier than other recipes I have tried and it came out great. Even with 3 small children underfoot. If you haven't tried it yet, you should.

Texture-wise, its wonderful! With a crisp crust and fluffy inside. But like others mentioned, its kinda bland. I did add 2 tbsp of sugar like someone suggested, but... I also doubled the quantity of salt. Reckon it would taste pretty good

I halved this recipe--no way that amount of ingredients results in just 12 slices.  It's a very easy, very basic, plain white bread.  The only change I made was to put it in my bread machine on the dough cycle, then I baked it as written.  It worked very well with the Orange Pecan French Toast I made for breakfast this morning.  The size of the loaf makes very long slices, but if you cut them in half they are perfect half size sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE this bread!  Was my first time using my stand mixer and first time making a yeast bread.  It was so easy and turned out really beautifully.  I ended up using a little less flour but went to a 'T', for the most part and everyone loves it.  the texture is moist and chewy inside and nice and crusty on the outside.  I am no longer afraid of making bread!  YAY!!!!

This recipe made a fabulous loaf of bread!  The texture was light and fluffy, and it rose beautifully.  I think it could use a little bit of honey to sweeten it a little, but other than that it's a terrific bread!

this was my first time to make bread, and this turned out perfect.  I divided the bread into two parts, and baked each in a loaf pan.  I let the bread rise in the pan for the second rising.  also i turned down the temp on my oven because i don't like a thick crust. my husband and i ate one whole loaf the day i baked it.  good thing i have another loaf. :-)

This is one of my favorite bread recipes.  It always comes out to be a huge loaf, is super easy to make by hand, and is very easy to adapt or add small touches too.  Such as rolling in seaseme seeds, rolled oats, etc.  It also makes wonderful pizza breads - my son loves them.

Great recipe for a first-time bread-baker because of the simple ingredients and easy instructions.  It was crispy on the outside and soft and crumbly on the inside - it looked very much like store-bought white bread.  However, it tasted quite bland.  The next time I make it I'll add 2 tsps of sugar to the yeast-water mix and 2 tsps of kosher salt to the dry ingredients to see if that helps any.  Overall it's a wonderful, basic white bread that I'll use for a variety of things.

A nice bread, small crumb, not a lot of rising so don't punch it down too much.   I tried substituting 2cups whole wheat flour to the mixture and a 1/4cup more water as well. Tonight I will also try retarding the mixture in the refrigerator for 10-12hrs after letting it rise for the 1hr the first time. This should let the flavors develop more and help to get an more airy bread.  I'm also going to try adding steam to this bread while baking for the first 10mins to get the crust to stiffen up as well.  Good recipe... my first decent bread I've made and it was well received and went quickly. Enjoy.

This is a great recipe to use to add to.  I have made it several times with adding either beef flavor or chicken flavor boullion to the water and yeast before adding flour.  I also add about 2 tablespoons crushed garlic to it and at times 1 tablespoon dried rosemary.  I also don't bake it as just bread I roll it out after the first rise and cut it into about 6 to 8 inch rounds and put in chicken with either alfredo sauce or just creme of chicken soup in it and then pull up the sides like a pocket and then let stand for about 15-25 min for 2nd rise before baking.  My three football player sons love these filled with chicken or beef and sauce. I only rated it 4 stars because of the changes I make to it.

result: a huge, flat loaf very similar to focaccia, with a crispy crust and a soft, springy inside.  i recommend the following for a tastier loaf: dissolve chicken broth powder into the yeasty water, and stir in 1.5 tbsp of rosemary into the flour.  i also added cooked cubed chicken breast.  AMAZING, i tell you.

I tried making this recipe in two loaf pans rather than a round loaf.  I was not successful.  It didn't raise enough.  It also needed more salt.

I made this into one *really* tall 8 x 4 loaf and about 7 buns. I used 2 cups of whole wheat and 4.5 cups of white, and I added an extra teaspoon of salt. Also, I added 2 T sugar to my yeast mixture. The loaf turned out light and fluffy with a pretty hard crust. All in all though, it's pretty bland.

I’ve made this recipe twice. The first time I made it as written the second time I made it I decided to customize it. I doubled the butter to make it flakier (also melted the butter instead of cube pieces), I added a little more salt and i separated the dough (1/2 of the dough was used as a pizza crust which was delicious) I let the bread rise in the bread tin and followed all baking instructions. The top of the bread didn’t get brown but the side of loaf did. Next time I’ll use butter instead of water to brush on loaf before placing in oven. I love that it’s a simple recipe! My 4 year old loves helping me make this and always so proud of herself for “making bread” must try for little ones

A lot of people are saying it tastes bland. I think it's suppose to read 1 tablespoon of salt, not teaspoon.  I usually do 1/2 tsp salt per cup of flour. Hope this helps.

I am new to baking bread from scratch. Very easy recipe to follow... and turned out great! I added a bit more salt and rosemary.... was wonderful with pasta.

I used half this recipe to make 3 small loaves to try. It was really good and a really simple recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the recipe. Would be a GREAT recipe for dinner rolls.

This bread was very easy to make and perfect for sandwiches or to enjoy with dinner.  I divided the dough in two and did the second rise in two standard size bread loaf pans.  I didn't need to add all the flour; omitting about a 1/2 cup. The result was a nice sturdy bread with a good crust all around!  My family ate half of one loaf waiting for dinner to be ready!  It's a keeper!

It was gone the first day, if that's any sign it was a good recipe :) I did a couple things different, I used instant dry yeast, which I just mixed in with the dry ingredients, still adding the warm water to the liquid part, and using shortening instead of butter. I am making it again today, however I am halving the recipe.. can't wait!

Great loaf of bread! To a good chunk of time to make, but it was well worth it for the size of the loaf.

I made this bread with unbleached flour and kneaded it with whole wheat flour. I was out of butter so i used butter crisco. It turned out wonderful. A very nice hardy bread. Delicious!!!

This bread is like a brick! It didn't rise well and was very bland, even though I added 2 TBSP Sugar, extra salt, and cayanne pepper.

UPDATE: It is now my go-to recipe for making focaccia bread. I make 1/2 a loaf and add 1/4 cup sugar to the yeast/water mixture. After the first rise, I roll it out to 9x13 and place on baking sheet. I spread a butter/honey/salt mixture on and then sprinkle with Italian seasonings..... BEST in the world

This turnd out with a huge loaf, even when the proportions were reduced down. Over all very tasty- I drizzed mine with honey and butter partway through the baking.
