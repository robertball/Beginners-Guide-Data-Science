I've never had hominy before, but I really enjoyed this dish!  It was very east to put together and had great flavor. Hubby also enjoyed this, but the kids, not so much. I liked that this didn't make a ton, either. I would def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Served it with pork chops, green salad and roasted asparagus last night to guests and it was a hit.  A new replacement for potatoes.
