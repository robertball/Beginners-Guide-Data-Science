This is a good recipe to tweak to your preference.  I made it as is but we like our veggies a little more cooked, so the second time around sauteed them in a little olive oil and butter.  Mixed all ing. added cheese to the top and skipped the potato chip mix. Turned out pretty good for a fast dinner.  Thanks for the post.

This is very good and enjoyed by all; however, when I make it again, will substitute sour cream for the mayonaise, and bread crumbs for the potato chips.

Execellent and satisfying for those "calories-be-damned" days when you need a tummy-warming meal. This is a great fall/winter meal when cold chicken salad just won't cut it.

Although the flavour was ok the combination of chips, celery and cheese just didn't work for us.  The cooking time was also off...either that or the celery was cut too big.  This recipe may have potential but I won't be trying again.

This recipe was so good.  To cut corners I used a rotissere chicken from the store that was already cooked and cut it up.  Yum,Yum.  I will make this again and again.  To cut calories I used low fat mayo and low fat chips-still tastes sinful!

I think I must have done something wrong because mine was not very good. Way too much tang for a hot dish.

Yummy!   So easy to make.  This is a magic dish ... it will disappear before your very eyes.  The potato chips give it a unique taste and crunch!!!!

This was really good! I used diced red pepper since I didn’t have pimentos. My husband hates mayonnaise (so he thinks), but didn’t see it go into this dish. He went back for seconds! I served this on toasted French bread. Delicious!

This is one of my favorite meals my mother used to make. That said I have to say my husbandx9 who is not a chicken lover by any means, Hates it. I dice the celery and I use red bell peppers as hey are sweeter and I used a 9 x 9 pan or a deep round dish to cook this in. I do everything else the same. Great recipe for a dish to bring to a church supper or community get together as most all chicken lovers love it.

This is a great recipe. I added a little stevia to the mayo mixture. Used a red pepper, because that is all I had. Used 2 cups of cheese and just a handful of chips, because trying to lose weight. Kids ate it right up...yes the onions and peppers were still on the plate. 1/6 of this recipe was under 400 calories... It had 25 grams of fat. Worth it.
