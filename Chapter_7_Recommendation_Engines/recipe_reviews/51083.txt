This was very gummy and sticky with a bland flavor.

With a few modifications my family found this to be a favorite.  
In assembling the ricotta mixture I also added in the chopped basil (instead of reserving it), salt and 1/2 tbsp. of fresh crushed garlic.  It made a big difference in the flavor.  
I also cooked up chopped chicken to add into it and combined that with the tomatoes and tossed it with the pasta and sauce in the pan I cooked the chicken in.  This seemed to infuse the pasta with a medley of flavors and facilitated the tossing of the ingredients together.  
I also found the key to non-lumpy pasta and sauce mixture was to toss the pasta with the sauce immediately after draining while it was still very hot.  The cheese melted and blended much more easily.  
No complications, but a few additions made this a requested favorite.
