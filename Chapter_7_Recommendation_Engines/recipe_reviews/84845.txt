This was delicious! Instead of 'seasoning blend', I used garlic powder and thyme. I also put the strips on a baking rack, set on top of a baking dish lined with foil (easy clean up). They were crispy all the way around and very moist inside. Served with mashed potatoes and corn for a pure comfort food meal. Delicious, thank you!

This is my family's favorite! We make often and have experimented slightly - is also good to dip in beaten eggs instead of melted butter (not as greasy, same taste) and you can use French's French fried onion rings instead of Rice Crispies and is also quite delicious, but slightly more expensive. Also good with cheddar cheese baked on top!

I lined the pan with foil then sprayed the foil with Pam. I melted 1/4 c butter in bowl. Then I put 1 cup Rice Krispies, 2 TBS flour, 2 tsp Montreal Chicken Seasoning into a small ziplock bag to crush and mix ingredients (don't over crush). Pour dry ingredients into separate bowl. Coat chicken in butter then coat with dry ingredients. Bake for 30 mins. for crispy coating. Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.

I was surprised how much the whole family liked these. I cut 2 chicken breasts into strips and then dipped. Used olive oil instead of butter for healthier meal.

This recipe was marginal.  Admittedly, I probably over-crushed the rice crispies, but it just wasn't very flavorful.  I might make it again, but I will definitely add some salt and other spices to add some flavor.  Not bad, but blah.

I like a little bit of a kick, so I added creole seasoning (I used Tony Chachere's)  Other than that I didn't do anything different and it was SO GOOD! I had company over, and so I let them eat as much as they wanted and ended up only getting 1 strip myself because they ate it all up so fast! LOL.. it is a favorite here!

This was very tender. I didn't have the seasoning so I replaced it with two dashes of garlic powder and it did the trick.

My two grandchildren loved this.  And the one don't like much as far as nutritional food goes.  So I was happy that he liked this since it's more healty than some of the other recipes I make for lunch or dinner.  Check the nutrition values on the recipes.  Thanks so much for the post.

These were really yummy and easy. I used Rotisserie Chicken seasoning with the Rice Krispies and it was really good! Make sure not to over-crush the rice krispies.

I followed another users suggestion and baked it for 20 minutes and turned out perfect! I also added garlic salt to the cereal breading, I used Corn Flakes instead of rice cereal. 

I also have to mention that I made two batches, one with butter dip and another with egg dip. I couldn't taste the difference. So next time I will prob just make them with the egg instead to shave off some extra calories 

The strips disappeared within moments, everyone raved about them.  It was a hit !  I will definitely use this reciepe again

Very tasty and very versatile.  There's lots of room for creativity with this recipe.(Seasonings, ect.)  I used eggs instead of butter as others have mentioned. I was out of rice crispies and used corn flakes instead. My family really enjoyed this meal.  It will become a "go-to" meal at our place.

Scrumptious! I used chicken grill blend, cayenne pepper, creole seasoning and a spice/salt seasoning, and the turned out perfectly.

My husband has been craaaaaaving chicken strips, but because we no longer eat fast food, he thought he was out of luck.  I tried this recipe for him last night, and we both LOVED it.  To save on calories, we used Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and because we didn't have any chicken seasoning, I made my own using a mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, salt and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I also gave them a very light coating with cooking spray before popping them in the oven, but those were the only changes.  They came out golden brown, crispy and juicy, much like the chicken tenders I used to enjoy at Claim Jumper's!  YUM!!!  My only complaint was that the serving-sizes were a bit small--I used a pound and a third of chicken tenders (and upped the other ingredients by a third to compensate), which worked out to approximately four medium tenders per serving.  You really need a hearty side-dish to make up for the small-ish amount of chicken per person.

Absolutely fabulous.  The only thing I did different was add more seasoning.  I added some garlic salt and montreal chicken seasoning.  I still added some Mrs. Dash but I also added some sea salt and pepper.  I had read reviews that said it needed more seasoning so I added it.  They were great!  I still gave this recipe 5 stars, because some people do not eat as much salt and seasonings due to heath reasons.  The chicken was fabulous and I think it still would have been good without the extra seasonings.  Bottom line is it was a perfect coating for the chicken.  I have tried several similar recipes and this one was the best by far.  Thanks!

I have never written a review, but after making this chicken and everyone in the family eating it, I had to!  I have picky eaters and I'm not the greatest cook, but everyone loved these chicken strips.  They even said, "They're better than KFC's."  This is a keeper for my family.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used Rice Chex.  Mine turned out crispy and delicious!  I did turn them after the 30 minute cook time thinking I would use the broiler on the soggy bottoms.  To my suprise the bottoms were crispier that the tops!  Yummy!  I served them with baked french fries from this site.

For some reason, I thought this would be better.  The rice cereal coating was really bland for my taste.  Didn't quite meet my expectations...

This was quick and easy to prepare.  The chicken was moist while the coating was crunchy without being too "hard".  I didn't have the salt-fee seasoning blend, so I used rotisserie chicken seasoning instead, and used Italian flavored planko bread crumbs instead of cereal (because I didn't have rice cereal, either).  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This makes and awesome gluten free chicken strip!  We used brown rice krispies and GF flour blend, but we used McCormicks Grill Mates Smokehouse Maple seasoning and it came out excellent. One of our favorite "fry night" treats. Just like eating out. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This one surprised me and favorably so!  I used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site which worked well.  I changed the process a bit, but I think still came up with what the submitter intended.  I didn't add the flour to the cereal, but instead dredged my chicken in flour first, then in a beaten egg and then in the cereal/seasoning.  I cut the butter to 2 T. and drizzled it over the top.  I baked this on a rack to help crisp the underside which really didn't work for me because it was still a bit soggy.  I will definitely make this again, but I will tweak it a bit more.  I'll just coat one side with flour/egg/crumbs and bake without any coating on the underside.  The top will still get crunchy, but no soggy bottom.  I don't often have rice cereal like I did last night, but I think this would also work well using panko.  Also, I think I'll leave the seasoning out of the crumbs and just sprinkle it over the top before drizzling the butter.  All in all this was flavorful and crispy and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again!

My kids liked these but it's not something I'll make very often. All that butter left me with a very heavy feeling in my stomach after I ate them.

Yummy, dipping in egg prior to crumbs. Covergirl, a salt-free product would be like Mrs. Dash, for instance. I'm sure there are more different kinds out there too.

Delicious!  We tried these with egg white in place of the butter, and they were still tasty (and healthier).

These were easy to make and extremely tasty!!! I increased the amoung to seasoning blend and also added additional garlic powder and a dash of chili powder. Yummy. We will definitely make these again. (Note: I made half of them w/ finely crushed cereal and I think I liked that even better)

Didn't have rice krispies; used the rest of a box of Yukn Gold potato flakes (instant mashed potatoes). We don't eat out much, but kids (9&11) said these sure beat out McD and Sonic's chicken strips! WOOT, WOOT! I added garlic powder, smoked paprika, and Penzey's Italian seasoning. THIS ROCKS!

This recipe just did not excite my family, although quick and easy I would rather put forth a little more effort for a crispier and more flavorful chicken strip.

I decided to try this recipe and I gotta say it was a very quick easy recipe that provided excellent results! It doesn't say which seasoning to use so I just seasoned to taste. I added a ton of pepper (chicken strips are always peppery), some salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. The recipe was so great my parents raved about it and are already begging me to make it again! Definitely a new favorite.

I loved the idea of baking rather than frying. But unfortunately, my husband and I found these dry and fairly unappealing. The kids, though, enjoyed them.

Changed this a tad.  Used panko instead of rice crispies, baked for 25 minutes, and broiled for 5 more to crisp.  DELICIOUS!

Fantastic...OMG, I love this.  So easy, so delicious, even fabulous the next day.  BTW, she's not kidding when she suggests salt-free add-ins; I'm a salt lover, but the first time I made this it was too salty.  Will trust you next time.  Thank you!

This was my first time trying baked chicken strips and it was a big hit with my 2 kids! We loved it ... I didn't use salt free seasoning but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and there was just enough coating for the chicken! Excellent and easy recipe - thanks!!

This recipe is really great.  All my family loved it...even my picky 3 year old.  My daughter gave up fried foods and she said this was a great sustitution.  I did not have rice crispies, so I used ritz crackers like another cook did and it turned out great.  It was moist and crispy just like fried strips are.  Prep was a snap.  I will make these often b/c they are quick and easy to make and great tasting.

I didn't have the seasoning so I used 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp thyme and another reviewer suggested. I broiled it for the last 2 minutes to give it an extra crunchy top. The texture was GREAT, but after trying it, I had to add a tiny bit of seasoned salt for flavor.

These were good.  I usually fry chicken tenders for the kids, but I wanted to bake them for a change.  I used whole wheat flour, and added onion powder, garlic powder, season salt, and McCormick barbecue seasoning to the dry mixture.  I also used Smart Balance instead of butter and sprayed the assembled chicken strips with butter flavored Pam before popping in the oven.  They were not bland with the seasonings I added, and they were SOOOO tender! Hubby loved these....he and my oldest son ate a ton!  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper :)

I only had drumsticks, so I used them. This was very good...nice and crispy! I followed the recipe except instead of 2 tsp of unsalted seasoning I used a tsp of seasoning salt and a tsp of Creole seasoning.

I thought it was interesting, and nice to try once.  I used garlic salt, onion powder, thyme and crushed red pepper flakes. There was a slightly sweet buttery aftertaste, and I’m still not decided if I liked it. It may be good with a dipping sauce. I feel there’s a good base here for people to work with.

Made it but used instant potatoes and baked it for 30 minutes and then turned them over and baked for an additional 15 minutes.  This is a keeper.

They really are crispy! Didn't have tenders so I just used breasts cut up. Used egg instead of butter (for calories sake). Such a versatile recipe! Change up the seasonings to suit your desire, use what meat you have on hand. How wonderful is that?!? My family lapped these up!

My family loves this recipe! Super easy and delicious. I don't have seasoning blend so I use garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and pepper. I also press the blend into strips of chicken for thicker breeding and more crunch. Thank you for the great recipe, it's cooked on a regular basis in my house!

Fast and yummy!  We loved the Rice Krispy coating, but used one tsp. of blackened seasoning, and one tsp. of my own salt and Italian seasoning blend in the breading mixture.  I would definitely make this again.

Loved it! Husband says make them again any time. I usually have Mrs Dash for "salt free", but was out. I used 1 tsp ea of Creole and garlic powder. Was truly happy with the whole thing. Also, I used a rack with a lined sheet so heat would circulate.

I love this recipe and we now make it all the time. Instead of butter we use an egg wash since we can not have any dairy. but over all it's amazing and we will continue to enjoy them.

I make this at least once a week for my protein picky son. I always season it a bit different each time and it definitely needs salt added to the dry mix, but the base recipe is perfect. Awesome with honey mustard dip!

These were delicious.  I added the seasonings to the butter (poultry seasoning, onion and garlic powder,  salt,  and pepper). Bake in a dark pan for extra crispy!

These are so good!  You can easily customize the flavor of the strips to your tastes.  I usually add some creole seasoning (I use Tony's), some garlic salt and some thyme.  They're also great leftovers--I love them on Hawaiian rolls with some mayo.  I recommend using your oven or toaster oven to warm them up so they stay crispy.

3 & 4 year old boys and husband loved it! Not often that all 3 like the same thing. I thought they were very tasty too--used an egg instead of butter and made a honey mustard dip from the site. I'm sure I'll be making these almost weekly.

I'm not sure if I over-crushed the cereal, but there was absolutely nothing crispy about this dish. The flavor was alright and the chicken cooked just fine, but the coating was just mush. Not sure I want to give this one another try...

This was a big hit with the family.  I didn't have chicken tenders so I cut up a few chicken breasts into strips and that worked just as well.  I used Italian seasoning along w/some garlic powder.

This was a good recipe - thanks for sharing.  I didn't have rice cereal so I used Rice chex.  I also used chicken garlic & herb seasoning, garlic powder.  Needed more seasoning.  Next time I will try w/rice Krispies and probably add some red pepper to spice it up a bit.  In addition instead of the butter I used egg beaters to dip the chicken in.

Quick, easy and pretty decent. I used chicken breasts since it's what I had. Not crunchy at all (son glad, I was disappointed). Per suggestion, I used garlic powder, thyme and a bit of seasoning salt. Worth making again.

Just made this tonight but used egg in place of butter and used panko in place of rice cereal as that is what was already in the pantry. Dipped these in the honey mustard dip recipe from this site and it was FANTASTIC. Will definitely make again!

I usually use egg, but I think using the butter kept the chicken more moist.  I also pounded the chicken out first and only baked it for about 20min.  My picky and healthnut husband loved them and my 2 year old son devoured his share!

Delicious. I was a little nervous at first since I've never used rice crispies for anything, but I had some in the cabinet so I thought I would give it a shot. Pretty good.

Very good.  I think I crushed the crispy rice cereal a little more than I should have and I didn't drizzle with remaining butter.

This was a great recipe and easy!!! I did crush the rice cereal to much though so watch it. The first strips i did were alot crunchier cause i got the bigger pieces on them and the rest got the finer left overs. But otherwise great.

Looking for a quick and yummy chicken strip. These were so delious. I usuall don't eat left overs, but I did take these strips to work the next day. My co-workers thought they were just as good. I did not have enough butter to drizzle over the top, this is a must so that they are not powdery.

This wasn't so good for me.  I think it might have to do with the seasoning blend I chose.  It was a little difficult to find a seasoning blend without salt in it.  I probably won't make this again.  I've had better.

It was really moist! so that was great but I think I would put it on a rack like other's suggested to make sure it was coated all around the chicken strips.

I changed it up a bit based on reviews and what I had in the cupboard.  I used a cup of rice krispies and 1/2 cup of fried onions for more flavor along with a little garlic power and thyme.  I also marinated the chicken strips overnight in ranch using a food-saver.  My boys are picky when it comes to chicken  but there were no leftovers this go round.  That says something!

Thanks for a great recipe!  I did alter it slightly by using creole seasoning in the mix instead of the one suggested.  I also baked the chicken on a rack placed on top of my baking sheet to ensure crispiness.  I will definitely make this again!  Yummy!

These were OK, but we won't be making them again.  I did have to substitute Crispix for the Rice Krispies, but I don't think it really made a difference in the overall recipe. Will stick with the Breaded Chicken Fingers from this site.

We love this recipe! I've tried a couple of chicken strip recipes but I always come back to this one. The Mrs. Dash gives it a little zing. I find that crushed corn flakes work better than the rice krispies though, they stick to the chicken better so you get a little crunch. My 2 year old (like most 2 year olds) has become a very picky eater, but he loves these! I made these with home-made mac and cheese and my 5 year old nephew told me I should be a chef. Very yummy!

These were great, my kids loved them!!  They were so easy as well.  I didn't have seasoning salt so I used garlic powder and some cajun seasoning, turned out great!  I probably won't buy frozen ones ever again!!

The recipes for Chicken Fried Chicken and Breaded Chicken Fingers from this site are both soooo much better than this recipe.  I did not like how buttery these tasted, and they were not crispy at all.  They seemed to be swimming in butter when I pulled them from the oven and besides tasting buttery, they were bland, kind of like how rice krispies are bland.  Sorry...

This is a great recipe!  Our family loves it.  I did not have crisp rice cereal on hand.  So I substituted Ritz crackers, which also turned out well.

I kind of mixed this one up a little and used Rice Chex, but the technique with the butter & cereal is nice. It made a good quick crispy chicken strip.  I would personally not use the spice mix again, but that is more a matter of taste.  My kids & picky husband loved them.

Love these!! I have two very picky eaters to plan for, and they both loved these, and asked for leftovers the next day. I made the honey mustard recipe from this site for dipping sauce and it was also a hit.

I thought that the chicken was good..but it was not crispy at all. I soaked my chicken strips in Jack Daniel's honey teriyaki for 2 hours, and then dipped the chicken into the cereal/flour mix. Again, the flavor was good, but the strips were not crispy at all.

My fiance made these with his cooking class and they were a huge hit! Easy enough for 10th grade kids to make. The store had run out of fresh chicken (!!!) so they cut up  frozen Mediterranean flavored chicken breasts into strips.

These were really good, the rice krispies made a great, already-crispy coating. I made minor alterations; i added a small clove of  crushed garlic to the melted butter, and i only had about a tsp of mixed herbs so i subtituted the rest for Mrs. Dash's garlic and herb seasoning blend and black pepper. I didn't grease the baking sheet, and it was a good thing because there was a fair amount of grease from the butter anyways. Great idea, extremely easy. I will definately make this again in the near future.
