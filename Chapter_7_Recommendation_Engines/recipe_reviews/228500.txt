Made for recipe group 7/19/13. I used fingerling potatoes sliced up. And of course extra bacon! These were wonderful. And easy enough where I left the directions for DH to make. Nice hearty side dish.

These were really good especially after seasoning with a little garlic salt/powder and fresh cracked black pepper.  I followed the recipe to a tee and would not change a thing other than seasoning to your personal preference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Mike!

This is a good recipe! My fries didn't take long at all and they were that perfect soft/crunchy ratio you get in the restaurants. Thanks for a simple but tasty recipe!

YUM! I used chopped pickled jalapenos instead of the whole slices (for better distribution), and just eyeballed everything to taste. Oh, and I salted my fries when I was finished frying them. This was a nice change from the usual cheese fries, and I loved that you used fresh made fries, instead of using frozen fries. I will definitely be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)
