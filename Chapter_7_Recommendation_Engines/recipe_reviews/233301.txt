yes, I made a double portion, added a half of cup of sugar; and did not measure the Sprite. I also added extra brandy.

Made as written minus the cherries. I love them but they are out of season right now and $8 a pound so I had to leave them out. I loved this recipe! Lambrusco is my go to wine so I knew this was a winner as soon as I saw it. 5 stars all the way!
