I doubled the recipe, left out the almond in the center and added about 1 teaspoon of baking powder. I used a cookie cutter to make football shapes and they turned out really well! Crispy, with a nice flavor. Great addition to Grey Cup Sunday!

Thought the cookies were a little bland and smelled like playdough. But they were edible and none went to waste.
