These are tasty, but we prepared: the batter is atypical.  We followed the directions and found ourselves with a very soupy batter thinking, "this can't be right at all."  It simply didn't look like anything that could turn into a pancake.  But we decided to try out one small one, just to see how it cooked up, and amazingly, it did turn into a pancake.  We did end up adding an extra tablespoon or two of flour to thicken it up slightly, but our advice is still to not get too freaked out by a very thin batter.

The mixture was bland, and the peanut butter flavor was barely there. However, once I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter, the pancakes had a bit more flavor. I also recommend mashing the bananas for the batter; it made it easier for the pancake to cool well on both sides.

These were very delicious!! I only had about 3/4 cup of flour so i used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and they turned out fantastic. I'm going to try them again using just the wheat flour. I also added another half of a banana and used the other half as a garnish. As the inscription says, they are so yummy, you do not need syrup. Thanks for this recipes!!! KUDOS!

I used whole wheat graham flour and these were good.  I think I should have chopped the bananas smaller, but it was nice to get pockets of banana burst flavor!  Needed to cook long to get totally done, and the batter was thin, but it cooked up just fine.  The PB flavor was just enough, and there were flavor pockets of it too - yum.

I read through the reviews as usual. I read that they did not have a strong enough peanut flavor, then I read that it had an overpowering peanut flavor. However, I found this recipe to be a perfect balance. My husband said they were the best pancakes he had ever had. I served mine topped with some warm, homemade applesauce.

I doubled the recipe, with the only variance being that I added a little extra salt to make up for the lack of it in my natural peanut butter, added a little extra vanilla, and substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose. 

Cutting the peanut butter into the dry ingredients was a clever method of incorporating it evenly. Although some reviewers suggested mashing the banana, I am glad I chose to chop them into extra small pieces as more per the recipe. The little bites of banana added some bursts of moist, flavorful goodness that made for a nice contrast with the peanut flavored pancake.

I had no issues with it seeming too watery nor did the banana chunks sink to the bottom as another reviewer mentioned.

I thought that the peanut butter over powered the banana.  Next time I would use a litle less peanut butter, and maybe a litle more banana.  I also added a 2 T. more of flour to thicken up the batter.  You don't need too much syrup on these!!

This is a quick and easy pancake recipe that I will definitely be keeping around.  I substituted peanut flour for peanut butter, which cuts down on fat, calories and also has more of a peanut-y flavor to the pancakes.  Definitely use ripened mashed bananas.  Next time I would probably add some cinnamon or nutmeg to the batter.

I used whole wheat flour, nonfat "soured" milk, natural chunky peanut butter and instead of brown sugar, I added a tbsp. of honey. The batter was really thin, so I had to add an extra 1/4 c. whole wheat flour. I cut up my banana really small and sprinkled pieces over the pancakes right after I ladled it onto the griddle. I made these ahead of time for tomorrow morning, so I'll update my review once my kids have a chance to try them. EDITED: My kids loved these! I served them with a little homemade strawberry jam on top and they inhaled them!

i read everyone else's reviews AFTER making the batter and eating a pancake, and i feel as though maybe a lot of people who chose to try this recipe don't make pancakes regularly... if you haven't made pancakes frequently, and you haven't experimented making pancakes before, then you should before trying this recipe.
i followed the recipe as it were, adding all the dry ingredients, vanilla, and peanut butter together (two spoonfuls~1/4 cup) and then the whole banana (mashed while stirring).
once this appears mixed, i poured milk directly from the carton into the mix until the mixture was of the right consistency--this is always the recommended method when making pancakes, because then you are able to adjust your batter better. i found it should definitely be slightly runnier, because the peanut butter and bananas chunk up and make the pancake thick while it is cooking (leading to either burning on one side, or raw in the center)--
PERFECT PANCAKES, every time. and they're outstandingly delicious. the only pancakes i've ever wanted to eat without needing butter or syrup, so i'm not sure if others used bad pb or bad bananas, but Jif and normal-sized, raw (slightly blackened peel) bananas were fantastic in this.

*Only* thing i added was a teaspoon of baking soda. (baking powder+baking soda=awesome baked goods, especially pancakes)

Tripled the recipe and made these changes based on that: all whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 4 cups milk, 1/2 c. pb, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 egg and 1 jar banana baby food.

I tried doing less milk at first and the pancakes wouldn't cook through (and they were thick and goopy inside). After adding more milk they were flat but better cooked. The children didn't like these and I'd make them again if I was out of eggs but it's the only reason I'd make these. :)

I followed the recipe and added the following based on people's comments: a dash of cinnamon, a tad extra vanilla and I mashed the bananas - no major changes.  The pancakes were tasteless - could taste the flour not the peanut butter or bananas.  Those items sunk to the bottom of the bowl.  The last batch had those and were better but nothing special.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I doubled the recipe right off the bat so I would have leftovers to freeze. 
The only thing different that I did, was first mash the bananas, not chopped, and blended them with 1 cup milk that I held back from the recipe, this gave a very smooth texture, next time I may blend the PB too. 

Thank you for an excellent and so so simple recipe!

Let me first say, i love banana, especially with peanut butter, but this combination just did not work for me.  I even tried a dash of cinnamon, after tasting the first set, and it didn't help much.  I really liked to idea, but it just wasn't something I'll make again.

I followed the recipe, mostly.  I used organic whole wheat pastry flour and I sifted it.  Then I substituted the milk with un-sweetened almond milk and cut it to 1 1/2 cups.  I also used crunchy peanut butter.  And I used one large banana with large-ish pieces.  I spread some more peanut butter on top with some lyke's golden syrup.  GOOD stuff

The pancakes were good. I used whole wheat flour, cinnamon, and extra vanilla as others suggested. But the pancakes stuck to the pan like glue, even when I put more oil on the pan. Maybe it needs oil in the pancakes.

I gave this 2 stars because I found the flavor really nice, even though I threw them all away.  I wanted to make something different and special for breakfast today, and I had no eggs.  This sounded perfect.  I followed the recipe except that I doubled the ingredients.  The results were dense and way too "moist".  They were not fluffy and even when the outside was way too brown, the center had a wet texture as if it were not fully cooked.  I will not make these again.  ever.

I added some flax seed meal and used whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier. 
Like other reviewers have said, batter came out really watery and the I didn't taste the bananas. I added a tad more flour as suggested but still a no go. Disappointed.

I made this morning for the family and it came out great! I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract (instead of 1/4) and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar (instead of 1 teaspoon), and chilled it in the fridge for 30 minutes to allow the baking powder to activate. I didn't find the batter to be thin and soupy at all. The pancakes came out fluffy and delicious and the flavour balance of peanut butter and banana was great. Will definitely make these again.

Amazing and my child loved it. One thing though, you can never have enough peanut butter and banana in there. Impossible. :)

My favorite pancake recipe so far, my family loved them. Next time I would try to cut much smaller chunks of banana, as the larger chunks seemed to keep some of the flipped pancake from cooking all the way through on the first pancakes I made. Lovely recipe, yum! :)

This was great. I think there was just enough peanut butter and just enough banana. I used one frozen banana which I mashed and one fresh banana that I cut into chuncks. I did double the batter and used half whole wheat and half all purpose. It was great.

Very Good. I added some cinnamon, and chocolate chips to it, as per some of the reviewers advice. It's so good. This is the second time I've made these, and they always turn out amazing.  Thanks. =D

Very yummy.  I used half whole wheat flour and three overripe bananas. I served them with butter and powdered sugar. Will make them again, probably in a few days :)

I added an additional 1 tbsp of flour and it made the consistency just right.  These pancakes are pretty good, a bit on the dense and sticky side and I couldn't handle too much at once, but tasty.
