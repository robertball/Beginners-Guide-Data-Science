The brownies were really not good. First off, I was about to add chocolate chips when it dawned on me that then they wouldn't be sugar free.. same with sprinkles. I used unsweetened cocoa powder and that might have been a huge mistake. These did NOT taste good. The rest of the recipe was the same and then I added walnuts to the top. I was trying these out for a bake sale and needless to say, I won't be making them. Later I will try it with sweetened cocoa powder to see if that helps, but I'd need to see if that contains any sugar.

I guess I should know better than to think "healthy brownies" can taste good. I do love the nutrition of the black beans and my 3 year old actually finished the one on his plate but politely refused seconds.

This is definitely a keeper for my household. The dense texture may not be for everyone. I used an 8x11 glass pan and the only issue I had was that the brownies "stuck" a little. More cooking spray next time. And I used dark chocolate cocoa instead of regular. We are big fans of dark and semi-sweet chocolate, so this recipe worked great. If you're looking for cake-like brownies, this may not be for you, or you may have to modify the recipe to get it more airy.

If you do not like sweets, and enjoy the bitter taste of dark chocolate, you MIGHT like these. I followed directions to a T, and my husband and I didn't really care for these. I even added some stevia to try and soften the bitter-blow. We will not be making these again.

I added walnuts instead of chocolate chips for health reasons. As well, I didn't have quite enough black beans so used 1/2 cup of white kidney beans that I had. I cooked it 5 minutes less in a muffin tin as I didn't have a pan the right size. I loved them and will make them many more times.

I have made these twice now and followed the recipe exactly.  They are delicious!  Make sure you blend all the ingredients together very well so your batter is smooth.  I used a Vitamix and they were velvety!
