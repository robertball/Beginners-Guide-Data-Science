5 star all the way! I've always loved Bulgogi and then you go and add spicy to it? Yes please! This recipe rocked. In the footnotes the recipe creator mentions reducing the spiciness by eliminating the cayenne pepper, the chile, and then some of the Sriracha if necessary. We both like heat but cayenne is not our favorite way of achieving it so here is what I did. I eliminated both the cayenne pepper and chile but then upped the Sriracha from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup and this was perfect for us. One thing the recipe did not mention and that is that you need to slice your beef against the grain . That is very important with this cut of meat in keeping it tender. This is a great recipe and one I will make often!

Loved it! The whole family ate up! I thought it would be too spicy but it had a little heat but not too much. I didn't change a whole lot. I did it on the stove instead of the grill. I didn't have sesame seeds or whole dried cayenne peppers so just skipped them. Even the picky eater ate three portions. The best part is that it is super easy to throw together - you just have to remember to marinate in advance. I made up the rice and made a bed of rice and put this over it. Really lovely - thanks for sharing.

I may try it again.  Flavor was good but  I would have liked it moister or more sauce.
