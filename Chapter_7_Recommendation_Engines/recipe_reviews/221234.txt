I doubled this recipe. After adding the initial two cups of stock, it wasn't nearly enough to cover the potatoes. I ended up dumping the whole 32 ounce carton in. I did throw in a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders, a healthy amount of fresh chives and some Frank's hot sauce. I did use fat free evaporated milk (I've had some disasters using refrigerated milk in the crockpot--I now use canned milk) and reduced fat cream cheese. This turned out very well and smells AMAZING. The cream cheese added a nice creamy flavor without going overboard. Next time, I think I'll cut the milk back by half to get a thicker soup.

Absolutely delicious!  I made mine on the stove and it was ready in less than an hour. Instead of ham I used bacon. I used whole milk and it was thick and creamy. Will make again for sure!

This is the best potato soup ever. I added more potatoes and extra onion but the overall look and taste of this soup is wonderful. I served it with fresh biscuits. A hearty meal

This recipe is the reason I love this site. The ingredient list cleared out my fridge and provided a wonderful dinner. My wife likes spicy foods so I topped this savory soup with some fresh sliced jalapenos to add a kick.

Easy and if you follow the directions given, it will blow you out of this world.  Initially, I doubled the ingredients; ate half and froze the other half.

My husband and I both loved this soup. I used a 4 qt pot, and after putting the potatoes, celery and onion in the pot, 1 cup broth was not enough; I added about 3/4 cup more. Everything else was as the recipe was written (used canned milk though). To mash the potatoes, I used my immersible blender which was perfect. The cream cheese didn't all melt, but it tasted great anyway. I'll cut the cream cheese in smaller pieces next time. Thanks for a great recipe. UPDATE 12/27/14: I used 2% milk and the soup didn't get as smooth/creamy as when using evaporated milk. Cutting the cream cheese into tiny pieces worked better. I also added 1/4 head cabbage that I had on hand and it was tasty!

Very good recipe! Easy, easy, easy! The only change we made was before adding the ham, we pureed the soup in the blender. This made it very rich and creamy. The whole family liked it, which is very rare! We used low-fat cream cheese,and it was still very rich and good-tasting. Thanks for an easy recipe!

I made the recipe as is, without doubling it, because there's just the two of us here. I found the flour/milk mixture wasn't thickening quite as fast as I wanted it to so I added a bit of instant mashed potatoes to hurry it up. Then it got too thick so I added more milk to make it the right consistency. Other than that, I made it exactly as written by the original submitter. The only thing I'll change when I make it again is I'll cut the cream cheese down to half. I could taste it too much in the soup and although I like it okay, I don't want my potato soup to taste most like cream cheese. I think if I cut back on that and don't add the mashed potatoes, the listed milk will probably be about right for us. Otherwise, great recipe.

This recipe was wonderful. This was my first time making any kind of potato soup, and I couldn't have been happier. I did double the recipe, and like someone before me, I ended up using the entire box of chicken stalk, two cups was just not enough. The other thing I did was I added some well cooked bacon to the soup. I will be making this again, for sure. It was super easy. Also, because I started late, I did this stove top to cut down the cook time, and it was still amazing. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

The BF and I loved it! It made only enough for two bowls each, and we wished I had doubled the recipe because I bet it would have tasted even more awesome tomorrow. This is definitely a keeper. I found, also, that only 1 cup of chicken stock didn't look or seem like enough, so I used 2 cups, and I used crumbled bacon instead of ham, only because that's what I had on hand. We also found that it needed a touch more salt and pepper, but other than that, it was YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled this recipe and it fed our family of 3 big eaters and 3 small eaters with a few servings left over for lunch the next day. The only changes I made were 2 use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

Loved this recipe. It's a keeper. Increased to 6 med potatoes, 3 celery stocks, 1 onion and 3 c chicken stock, got to fill that crock pot!
 Minor change: I used 1/2 c of whipping cream (frozen leftovers) in place of the cream cheese and grated 1 carrot for a bit of colour. Didn't mash the potatoes but should have. I will next time. Fed 3 of us for dinner, 2 for lunch and the same went into the freezer. Big hit for our hungry family.

Loved this recipe. I did change it somewhat. Instead of regular milk, I used soy milk. I also used more stock so it wasn't so thick. I also did not use the celery just because I did not have any on hand, but will try it next time. Great tasting and was gone in no time.

My family liked this potato soup.  I think next time I will modify the chicken stock and add a little more.  Didn't seem like it was enough liquid for the potatoes to cook.  Other than that... good stuff!

I made this on the stove instead of the crockpot and made a few changes. Most people suggested ham or bacon but I added diced chicken and broccoli. I used a bag of diced hash brown potatoes instead of fresh potatoes. I also added chopped onions and red and green peppers.

One comment I saw the writer had complained of the soup being too thick. I was raised on thick potato soup. If it gets too thick, then add milk or water which is what I did the next day when we ate the rest. This is a good base soup and I will make this again and maybe add cheese or other veggies too.

It was very tasty and great for a cool day. The only thing was that I thought it was a bit too thick... I had to add about a half a cup of milk.

Very very good!  I made it exactly as written.  I do question the technique of "stirring until thickened" after adding the milk/flour.  Perhaps she meant stir until blended?  It's not going to actually thicken until heated, and being a crock pot, after adding 1 1/2 cups of something cold, it's not going to be heated for quite a while.  Only thing I will do different next time is add the ham along with the potatoes n the beginning.  My ham wasn't "left over" and hadn't been previously cooked (although I know all ham is sold 'precooked'), and I think my ham would have been more tender if it had cooked longer.  But all in all, terrific recipe.  Thanks Donna!

This soup was absolutely delicious! However I did make a few changes. I doubled the amount of celery, onion, stock, and ham. And added some whole golden new potatoes and about a cup of chopped cauliflower. Then instead of mashing the potatoes in the slow cooker I put the soup into a blender. Then put it back in the slow cooker for the 2nd 2-hour cooking time. Also I browned the ham slightly before putting it in the soup. Even my picky 12-year-old liked it.

It made mashed potatoes basically! Is my HIGH, higher than normal? I cup of stock was not enough to cover, and only 1.5C of milk hardly added enough liquid. (yes, I only had 3C potatoes)

Great flavor, great texture.  For the ham, I went to my grocers deli and had them cut me a thick slice of ham and I cubed it.

I doubled the recipe.  Just doubled everything and didn't have any issues.  Creamy and very good!  We left our potatoes chunky, didn't mash at all.

11/2015 this is my go-to recipe. I use a stock pot on the stove instead and start to finish  the recipe takes about an hour. Depending on how many potatoes I used I adjusted the amount of chicken stock. My three large and one tiny potatoes required 2 cups of stock instead of just one. Add a couple cloves of crushed garlic . I crumbled bacon and shredded cheese on the top before serving
1/16 update I doubled the recipe and froze half, used cubed ham instead of bacon.  Still excellent!
10/16 finally used crock pot, doubled most everything,  used thin sliced lunch meat ham,  too salty. Emmulsion blender would have made it smoother but then no bag in crock pot ??

I thought this soup was good, although after 5 hours on high in my crockpot, my potatoes still seemed hard. I moved everything to the stove, but lost patience after about 30 minutes as it was past our dinner time. I put 3/4 of it into my blendtech, then put the blended mixture back into the pot. It resulted in a thick soup with some chunks of potato.  I should also mention that i used bacon instead of ham, and also found it necessary to increase the amount of chicken broth. I used 1/2 of my 8oz package of cream cheese because it was unclear to me what '1/2 (8 oz.) package cream cheese' is. Seriously, do you want half of a 16 oz pkg resulting in 8 oz? Or do you want 1/2 of an 8 oz pkg? Regardless, it was good with just 4oz. I served this soup with a yummy garlic flavored bread.  When I make this again, I will give it much more time to cook and perhaps use cheddar cheese or sour cream instead of cream cheese.

I made this recipe today and me and my son loved it.  The only thing I did different was add 2 packages of onion soup and instead of milk I used can milk to make it a bit richer. Also I added frozen peas and bacon to eat.  I really loved this recipe it turned out great!!!

This was a great slow cooker soup recipe. My husband said it was EXCELLENT! I did tweak it a bit by using evaporated milk and added a bit more potato and some minced garlic and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. I also doubled the recipe because my husband LOVES food. I will be making this again. It was perfect for a cold winter night in Illinois.

It's easy to make which is a plus.  I don't love ham in potato soup so I should have just replaced it with bacon.  It wasn't the best I have ever had but it was easy and tasty with some bread, so 4/5 stars!

This was one of the easiest soups to make. I used condensed milk similar to other reviewers and also used all gluten free ingredients, including the flour which was a gluten free all-purpose baking flour. Still yummy! I added additional broth to cover the potatoes. One batch is enough for a family of four but there's nothing left over. I quadrupled this recipe for a teacher luncheon at my daughter's school and they all loved it!

We accidentally came across ANOTHER great soup while making this. As I started to break down my veggies in the VEGGIE STOCK (made ours vegetarian) ...hubby taste tested it and loved the broth with the veggies (prior to the potatoes breaking down), esp the onion chunks, so much.. that he asked me to let him eat a BOWL OF THAT!! It was delicious! So the next time I made this soup, I stopped there. It was a huge pot and my family demolished it within two days!!

I started out making this to doubling the liquids used less parsley and did not mash the potatoes. My other half doesn't like cream cheese so I waited to tell him after he finished his first bowl. He ate 2 more after that. Very good recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe, but I did doctor it quite a bit.  I sautéed the onions and celery with a 2 T of butter and added 3 cloves of garlic.  This softened the onion flavor!  I also added about a 1/2 of a cup of shredded Monterey Jack cheese and doubled the chicken stock.  This soup was amazing!

I followed directions exactly until I opened my fridge and cupboards to find out of milk and cream .. then I remembered I had powdered milk in the back of the pantry. I made it one cup less water then directed on the box and stirred it right on in. Nothing changed this recipe at all. It’s perfect for a day when all it’s done is rain and you don’t feel like going out.  Served with left over garlic bread ! Thanks for an excellent and lazy recipe that works out for two people ??

I made this and my sweetie could not get enough of it.....or quit telling me how wonderful it was. Not like him at all to be so effusive!  Only changed a bit. Used up about 1/2 c heavy cream with the whole milk. Had to cook it longer to get potatoes softened enough. Added a bit extra cream cheese because it was in an opened package. I recommend!

Made it stove stop, adding some garlic to sauteed vegetables.  Used double the chicken broth and added some paprika to the roux.  Excellent soup.

I gave it 4 stars only because of the basic recipe. I had to put it on top of the stove after 3 hours because the potatoes were not done. I also added bacon bits to add to the flavor.

It has been -20 and -30 below zero here for more than a few weeks now, so warm soup like this is welcome at our house!  This recipe was so easy and my entire family absolutely LOVED it!!! (A few of them are not easy to impress, so kudos!) I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers and wish I would have tripled it because we couldn't get enough. We will definitely be making this for years to come!

This was awesome. I used more stock as I doubled the recipe. Next time I will try it with low fat cream cheese to cut the calories.

Excellent soup.  I made a ham for New Years and used the leftover stock rather than chicken broth and it turned out delicious.

Excellent!  I made mine on the stove.  Softened the veggies up first; added diced carrots and diced broccoli stalks as well.  I used evaporated milk too.  It was amazing, will definitely make again!  Next time, I might reduce the potatoes and add a larger portion of the other veggies to reduce carbs.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out fantastic.  The only change I made was I boiled the milk before adding the flour and adding to the crock pot.   I loved that, for a potato soup, it's super easy.  I have another recipe and it takes me all day.  I will be doing this one instead.  My kids all ate 2 bowls each.  Next time I might just add a few more potatoes only because we like thicker soups.  A keeper!

Seriously great! I did make slight modifications due to what I had on hand. I used 2 tsp granulated garlic instead of onion, whole milk instead of 1%, carrots instead of celery and I cubed some ham instead of using chopped. 
According to my kids, Jesus will want this at the marriage fest of the lamb. Thank you so much!

Not a potato soup fan but needed to use up some food goods that we're all in this dish. Turns out this dish is delicious and I will definitely make again. Only thing I can recommend is to add more liquid. My "soup" was more like a creamy mashed potato than soup.

I love this soup...with the few tweeks I made. I added 1/2 a cup of corn and carrots, used bacon instead of ham, and added garlic and thyme.  And replaced the flour with cornstarch since we have wheat allergies. 
And instead of putting the onions, celery and potatoes all in to get mashed, I sauteed the celery and other veggies after I put in the cream cheese since I  like texture in my soup personally. And I cut my potatoes too small, so they didn't mash all that great...but it tastes AMAZING! lol My hubby has already laid claim to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow haha

ì absolutely love this recipe. I made the following  changes: a tsp more of parsely, and a 1/4 cup more of onion. I like a very flavorful potato soup and I did not put ham in it so this helped .  I also pureed about 2/3 of the veggies/broth before adding the milk. I think this helped with the texture. The result was delicious.  Next time I will double the recipe though, as I doubt it will make it to the fridge for leftovers!

Very good. Mine was a little salty and I did not even add the salty. Must have been the stock I used. I used vegetable stock instead and omitted the ham to make mine vegetarian. Otherwise I made it exactly as recipe stated. I would make this again, possible on stove top next time. Since there are multiple steps it will likely be easier on the stove top. You can't throw the ingredients in and leave it all day (my ideal crock pot recipe)

Worked out well but I changed it up a little.I used 6 medium Russet  potatoes unpeeled and diced small. I did have to add additional chicken stock to cover the potatoes. I substituted sliced baby carrots for the celery and 6 slices of bacon diced instead of the ham.

This was excellent. I tripled the potatoes to 9 cups, ( love leftovers) diced small, one cup celery and onion, 3 cups stock, 4 tsp flour.. after 2 hours I added 2.5 cups milk. After another 2 hours I blended half the soup because I like some chunks. I then added 3/4 package of cream cheese. After putting soup in bowls I added a little more milk to each so as not too thick.

I didn't have chicken broth or stock on hand, but used a packet of poultry gravy mix for thickener instead of the flour. I also substituted plain greek style yogurt for the cream cheese. The yogurt adds a nice tang without the fat of the cream cheese. This is a very good basic recipe to add to or substitute as you like. I will make this again with broccoli stalks.

Planned on the slow cooker method, but ran out of time. Doubled the recipe except for meat and did it stove top. Added a little extra broth, enough to cover all the potatoes, etc. Worked great! Added carrots to the potatoes and added broccoli and curry just before adding the flour mixture. It was wonderful! Thank you for sharing it! It's versatile so you can tweak it as much or as little as you like.
