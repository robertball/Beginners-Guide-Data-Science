These turned out well, texture-wise they were perfect. I just think that the seasoning mix (which wasn't the brand name that the recipe called for but was similar) I used wasn't quite right. Next time, I'd use something else but keep all the ingredients the same.

Itâ€™s super good and super tasty. I really do no like sage and all the other breakfast sausage recipes had sage so I ended up choosing I make this one and I was skeptical bc why would maple syrup taste good with steak seasoning but to my surprise it came out great and it was super easy !! I cooked them on the stove instead of the oven and it turned out great just remember to lay them out as flat as you can bc they do puff up and shrink.

I appreciate the better texture than I usually get when trying to make any turkey patty. I added fresh minced garlic
