I thought there would not be enough moisture before mixing these, but there was plenty!  I subbed 1/4 cup honey for the sugar, and used raisins instead of dates.  My 1/2 sweet potato measured 1 cup of chopped sweet potato. These are wonderful tasting!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great  plant-centered dietary choice! Moist, hearty,  not too sweet.  Followed recipe except  to sub SF oil with veg oil. I had a leftover,  cold sweet potato, medium, baked with skin on, so just needed to peel and dice. Used the whole potato. Easy to see why it was voted #1 in Toronto!

Delicious! I only followed the measurements and swapped most of the ingredients. I used millet flour instead of spelt, maple syrup instead of white sugar, coconut oil instead of sunflower oil, and nutmeg instead of cinnamon. I added a pinch of salt and I mashed 3/4 of a large sweet potatoes along with the dates.

Soooo good. I bake this for my bed and breakfast. I use a whole sweet potato and add a pinch of salt.

This was a very delicious, moist & satisfying muffin...vegan or not!  I did use a whole sweet potato, instead of a half.  My husband, who is not vegan, loved these!
