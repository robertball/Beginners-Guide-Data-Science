I would like to give this recipe a 4/5, but I'm rounding up because this cookie has a unusually nice flavor. Unusual, due to when you bite into it, you wonder what spice is in this cookie.  If I hadn't made it I would have never guessed. I could tell it had cinnamon, but not  pepper. I took my son to Concordia University in Irvin, and they served this cookie. I've never tasted it before. I had to find the recipe. I only ate one, and was examining it closely. Months later, I thought, this is a christian college, with many Lutherans. Lutherans started out in Germany, so lets try a German cookie. I've made others but this is the one. I'm not sure it's exact, because of what others said about them spreading, I used 1tsp baking soda. The batter was too sticky, so I used a little oatmeal to thicken it, next time I will try more flour. They did not over spread. They are a crisp cookie on the edges, and has a chewy center. I rolled them into a ball and flattened slightly to get more of a uniform shape. I was suprised these cookies did not need butter/fat. That is why you have to spray the pan with pam, or lightly grease. I left out the raisins, for the cookie I experienced at the college did not have raisins. I really like these cookies, and will make them again, so I guess they really deserve 5/5 after all. I will have to tweek it with a little more flour next time, so they won't stick to my hands. Thanks for the mystery cookie recipe I've been looking for.

You can't eat just one of these chewy cookies!  I ground the raisins so I could sneak them past the high school  German class, and omitted the nuts (but walnuts would be fabulous in these).  The intensity of the cloves along with the heat of the black pepper made eating these cookies a sensory experience.  Careful: they spread quite a bit on my cookies sheets.  I will definitely make these again.

I was a bit disappointed because I wanted them to be more spicy, but overall an excellent cookie! I would make it again. As another reviewer said - make sure they're spaced far enough, may be even 3 inches apart as they spread quite a bit.

I made two changes to these: I used pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference), and I substituted baking powder for baking soda, as one other reviewer suggested.

These cookies are great!  Unlike another reviewer, mine didn't spread out very much at all--they kept their shape similar to the way meringue cookies do.  Maybe that's because of the baking powder substitution, but I'm not sure.  They are very aromatic and pleasantly spicy.  I recommend keeping the raisins because they add a lot to the texture.  I loved these cookies and plan on making them again at Christmas time.

I changed my recipe so much that the end is far from the original, but what I came up with was not too bad.  Everybody else likes them.

well I made a small batch of this recipe to try it out. I couldn't get the dough to blend together. I had to add some water to incorperate everything. They had a rough, chewy texture (maybe because of the water) . The cookies were Okay dunked with coffee and tea. They didn't improve the next day.
