Just made salad this evening and it was great!!
Easy, fast any a great flavor. Used green Italian olives chopped up and added some chopped fresh basil and red wine vinegar.  Will be a summer favorite for grilling out.
Could easily be dinner with some crusty bread!!
Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I used spinach tortellini, grape size tomatoes, a red pepper and Kalamata olives.  It's delicious.

Not bad, not great... kind of plain.  The broccoli is a bit too much texture in my opinion.  Needs more of a sauce.
