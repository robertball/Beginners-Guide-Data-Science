I used Jim Beam Kentucky Fire instead of Fireball. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. The cinnamonon makes a nice variation on the old school Manhattan. Warmed me right up!

I love to sip on Fireball so I knew this drink would be right up my alley. This is a nice sipping drink that takes a bit of the edge off the Fireball. I didn't have bitters so had to do without them. CHEERS!

This drink tastes like liquified Red Hots candy. It is very sweet with a powerful cinnamon flavor.  It was a bit much for me, I ended up adding a splash of Sprite to it once there was room in the glass.
