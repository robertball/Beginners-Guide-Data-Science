I probably shouldn't be rating this recipe because I made numerous changes but it turned out wonderful! I eliminated the cranberry beans, wheat berries, dried lentils (because I didn't have any), tomatoes and avocado. Then I switched from green onions to a red onion.  I loved the end product and so did the 5 people I shared the soup with. The second time I made it, the onions were soaked in white vinegar and used as a dressing just before I served it. The end result tasted so much like what "momma used to make" and a super recipe to tweak to your liking.
