This is a really great recipe with a few minor adjustments you will get rave reviews.  I use hot curry paste and about 3 tbs of it.  Also, I use the regular coconut milk not the light.  I use 2 pounds of shrimp instead and the more green onions the better. The extra ingredients helps to over come the sauce being too runny.  Cleaning the shrimp is a tedious job but the cooking time makes for that process.  Really should give this recipe a try.

From reading the other review it seemed a little bland.  From past experience with Thai food, I added 1 tsp nutmeg, cayenne pepper, 1 extra tsp of curry paste, fresh basil a little cumin.  It was then...delicious!

nice combination of flavours, but very very mild.  needs more of pretty much everything, except coconut milk - the sauce was pretty thin

Per previous comments, I used 2 and 1/2 tsp of red curry paste and it was hot and spicy!

This dish was just as tasty as one you would eat at a good Thai restaurant!  I used regular coconut milk, instead of light.  Also, I highly recommend adding about 4 tablespoons of fresh cilantro at the end of cooking.  I did, and I think it really made the dish especially wonderful.  My husband and I frequent Thai restaurants, and he said this was just as good as anything he'd eaten out.  It was easy to make to boot!  This will definitely be a regular at our house, thanks!

Holy wow!  Delish!  

I improvised on this recipe in a big way: I replaced the asparagus with half a pkg of frozen mixed string beans and baby carrots (personal preference), added  about 1.5 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley, 1 bunch of fresh spinach (whole), one 14 oz. can of pineapple chunks (thoroughly drained and rinsed), and upped the red curry paste to about 4.5 tsps (to a medium spiciness).  In essence the dish becomes Pineapple Curry with Shrimp (another Thai restaurant dish).  I served the shrimp dish over coconut rice with raisins (a recipe from my childhood in Latin America) and the whole meal was awesome!

If you're feeling adventurous, try the recipe as a starter/base for your own creation.  It serves like an authentic Thai restaurant meal.

This has been a time-honored recipe for my husband and me. It's fast and easy, very tasty, and can be modified easily. It's also good with a few leaves of fresh basil mixed in at the last minute (so they are just wilted) and I LOVE it with a squeeze of lime. Sometimes we use sliced chicken breast in place of the shrimp, allowing it to fully cook before adding the other ingredients to the skillet. I like to thinly slice red bell pepper and add that for an additional Thai touch. An old favorite of mine.

An easy thai dish that will leave you feeling like you just ate out. I added some pineapple and pineapple juice to sweeten it up a bit.

Fantastic and soooo easy! Regular coconut milk was perfect. Several people suggested adding more curry paste which is perfect but add it to your own taste!  I pre-cooked string beans to use instead and it worked just as well.  This is a keeper.  My dinner guests went crazy over this recipe!

Very good. I needed more red curry paste than what the recipe calls for but still very good either way.

With a few minor changes, this turned out great - it was as good as take out! I increased the red curry paste to 3.5 tablespoons, added sliced red bell peppers with the other veggies, and put fresh basil leaves in for the last 2 minutes.
Fabulous!

Yum!
Didn't have any red curry paste, so I used about 2 tbsp regular curry paste.
I also added 2 cloves of garlic.
The sauce is thin, so after cooking the rice I just added it to the pan & it soaked up everything nicely.

I thought this was delicious and so did my friend.  I couldn't find Thai curry paste but had some Indian Tandoori paste, put in about 2 tablespoons and about a teaspoon of cayenne and it was great.  I did have to cook the asparagus longer than was recommended - about 5 min.
