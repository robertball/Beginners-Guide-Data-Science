To get the fries crisp, I moved them to the highest rack in my oven once they were soft, then cranked up the temp to 475 for the last 5 minutes.

My family LOVES this recipe! We made two minor changes - We didn't peel the potatoes (we just washed them really well and cut them with skin on), and we didn't have Lawry's garlic salt with parsley, so we combined regular garlic salt with some parsley flakes. We have made this recipe over and over again. You've got to try it!

These are great!  I recommend soaking the potatoes in salted water as you slice.  They soak up the flavor as you prep!  I added Montreal Steak seasoning to this one.  It was ultra delicious!  This is a keeper.

I have made this twice in one week. I love it.  I baked as noted then switched my oven to Convection Roast for about the last 10 minutes.  I was able to get some of them crispy, but not all.  Still Yummy!  If your oven has this option you may try it.

The fries would not get crisp, so I cooked about 10 - 15 minutes than the recipe called for.  I got sidetracked and came back to find a portion of my fries burnt, and unfortunately, many of them were still not crisp.   
I was so surprised, the fries actually tasted awesome!  They were sweet and the black parts that were burnt actually didn't taste too bad.  I am going to try this recipe again, but I need to figure out a way to make the fries crispier- maybe I used too much oil?

really good!  i didn't wait for my fries to get crisp... as i'm not really a fan of crispy fries anyway... mine were cut pretty thin so 40 minutes was pretty much perfect timing.  i also actually only used one tablespoon of oil, which worked fine.

We really liked this one.  You may need to cook them a little longer, depending on how thick your fries are.

I used only 1Tbl. of oil like someone else recommented.  Although great tasting, I couldn't get them crispy without burning.

These fries were very tasty! I did add a little extra chilli powder and I broiled them for a few minutes to see if I could get them crispy. Unfortunately, they didn't get crispy but they still tasted fantastic- my kids loved them!

I finally made this recipe for my husband. He has been asking for these fries and I followed the recipe as stated and also sprinkled some cayenne pepper. I cooked them at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes along with another french fries recipe.

I used a combination of white and sweet potatoes to please everyone at the table, and we loved the spice blend on both kinds. My potatoes did not get crispy, but I suspect the problem is that my oven did not get hot enough. I loved the zesty flavor, and the recipe was a snap to throw together. I have leftover sweet potatoes in the fridge and will be baking a fresh batch tomorrow. Verdict? A healthy, tasty, easily prepared recipe. (The spice blend would make great home fries, too.)

Wonderful! A great spice combination, and a welcome break from oven roasted white or red potatoes. Using convection, I didn't have a problem with crisping. But watch carefully; at 425, the spices will burn easily.

This is a great healthy alternative to fried potatoes.  My family loves the sweet savory combo of the sweet potato and the spice blend you toss them in.  I do not peel my potatoes great!  Thanks!

Yummy!  These were absolutely delicious.  I did cut the oil down and omitted the cayenne pepper, but they turned out really crispy.  I only cooked the for 15 minutes on each side, for fear of burning.  They were so good my husband went to the store and bought more sweet potatoes.

I love a good sweet potato dish, and this one was what I would call spectacular! Its both sweet and well seasoned so you get that french fry taste with a touch of sweetness. My one recomendation is that you watch these while they cook because they can easily burn, but as others have said, even the slightly burned ones still had a good taste.

Yummy~ definitely don't need all the oil I used. I cut mine small and left them in the oven for extra bake time and they were nice and crunchy!

Made these when I had sweet potatoes lying around and didn't know what to do with them.  Oh they were so savory and delicious! I had guests over that night and there was none left!

This is a case where I would have loved to have read the reviews BEFORE I made these.  Like others, I would have liked these to be crispier.  I will definitely cut the oil down to 1 TB next time.  But my son loved them like they were.  Good recipe.

I never buy seasoned salt, since I have a cupboard full of all kinds of spices and herbs.. And I didn't have the brand of garlic powder called for in here either, so, I seasoned the potatoes with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic and onion powder, dried basil and chili powder and baked as directed. The whole family loved these baked sweet potato rounds and I liked how  faster they were to bake verses the whole sweet  potatoes.

I really liked the flavor of the seasoning, but the fries were burnt on one side (I turned them once, as recommended in the recipe) and they were soggy on the other side.  I was hoping for more crispiness.  I am doubtful that I will make this again.

Pretty tasty.  I kept them in for 40 minutes but about 1/4 of them burnt.  I still ate them, though.  I also added a little cinnamon and a touch of cayenne pepper.  I will make them again but keep a closer eye on their progess in the oven.
