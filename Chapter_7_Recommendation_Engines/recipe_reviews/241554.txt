The only thing I can say is...OMG! It is, to my taste, better than risotto and this is totally a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly as it was because I never cooked farro before and didn't feel adventurous. Actually I substitutes one thing...sour cream for crème fraiche but hat's it! It is PERFECT as it is! I served this incredible side dish with a BBQ chicken breast....again just FABULOUS! If you never tried farro, give it a try! Thank you Chef John

I found this recipe after searching for Farro. I love mushrooms so I decided to try it. I actually mixed this recipe with the Heathly warm Farro salas recipe on this site. That recipe includes spinach (actually kale) and crumbled feta. I followed this recipe mainly because of the mushrooms and the items in the other recipe are added last. It turned out wonderful! I am using this as the main course with a vegetable on the side. I wanted a healthier version, so I left out the creme  fraiche and the cheese in the one since I was using feta.

I've made this recipe multiple times now, and keeping coming  back to it.  I've just used regular porcini or portobello mushrooms, and subbed sour cream for creme fraiche.  Reliable and tasty -- probably even better as written.

First time faro cooker here... and huge success. I followed the recipe to a T but still needed to cook the farro about 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. My daughter who doesn't eat mushrooms cleaned her plate! I would say this dish is definitely flavourful, with a great texture, and the creme fraiche was a perfect addition at the end. A great rice substitute. Served it with roast chicken and green beans.

This is a great recipe if you're making farro for the first time.  I used a bit more farro (1.25-1.5 cups) and increased the chicken stock (vegetable) to 4 cups.  I let the farro cook about 20 minutes longer than suggested, which I think was a fortunate accident.  There were no procini mushrooms at my grocery store, so I used a mix of dried wild mushrooms and a package of  white button mushrooms that I already had on hand.  Next time I would add a bay leaf while cooking, for some extra flavor.  I used Greek yogourt in the place of the creme fraiche (about 4 tbsp) and 3-4 tbsp of Parm (which was a bit much, as Parm is pretty salty).  It's similar to this recipe, which I keep in my rotation http://allrecipes.com/recipe/barley-mushroom-risotto/detail.aspx

This was great - I used Cremini mushroom caps and Black Trumpets in leiu of porcinis. Awesome as a side with salmon and a green. Will definitely make again!

This was unbelievably good.  I followed the recipe.  While the farro was dimming for the last 30 minutes, I grilled some center cut pork chops and an iceberg salad.  Voila!  The cream fraiche and the cheese turned the simmering farro into a wonderfully succulent edible mushroom soup!  Can’t wait for my leftover lunch(es).

YUM! This one's a keeper whether it's for a side dish or your lunch. I didn't change much. The water I soaked the wild mushrooms in, I added that in along with the broth and decreased that by one cup. I didn't put in the creme fraiche but did squeeze tons of lemon juice on it just before eating and it was lovely. You could really add it lots of other veggies or even some feta. It is that "blank slate" type of dish.

Phenomenal dish! I made it as the recipe exactly as written to include the Creme Fraiche (which really make the dish!) Crazy thing is that I used dried Porchinni mushrooms that I purchased 35 years ago in Italy!  when hydrated, they were as flavorful as any I have ever had! Nothing like an "antique" mushroom dinner! Will be making this again and often!

I made this with a few changes using ingredients I had on hand.  Substituted Button mushrooms for the porcini and mushroom caps, beef broth for the chicken broth and sour cream for creme fraiche.  It was fabulous,  will definitely make again!

I LOVE this dish!  It’s time intensive, by my standards, but it’s got a fabulous taste!  I read the suggestion to use sour cream for crem fresh (good call because it takes just a little anyway).

Substituted whole grain couscous for farro, sour cream for crime freche, plus added broccoli stems and fresh peas.  I just adjusted the cooking time and approach for the grain I had.  I LOVE this recipe and am definitely making it again.   I would expect using spinach and carrots would also be delicious.

A sit down restaurant quality side dish! I had to us shiitake mushrooms instead of the fancier dried mushrooms because I just couldn't find them anywhere in the store.  Still had a wonderful earthy flavor that was balanced well with the creaminess of the creme fresh.

Yummmm... I was craving something a bit grainier than risotto and this definitely did the trick. The use of the dried mushrooms really added to the recipe.

This tastes amazing!  Everyone thinks you spent a lot of time and it is so easy!  I'm a shroom lover, so I play with oyster, shitake and whatever else happens to be on hand.  Sooo yummy!  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was my first time trying Farro - and I now consider myself a freshly minted fan of the grain. I was feeling bold and doubled the amount of porchini mushroom and used only 8 brown Mushrooms. The flavor was intense so I can see why only half an oz might be preferable for the porchinis. Otherwise, following Chef John’s process for cooking the Farro has it come out perfectly tender and chewy and simply delicious!

I used all dried mushrooms, porcini and chanterelles. Also used my kefir yogurt in place of the creme fraiche,  & VT extra sharp cheddar instead of Parmesan. Absolutely delicious!

My husband and I LOVED this dish, although we made quite a few changes. We used regular sliced button mushrooms, Fage Greek yogurt for the creme fraiche, doubled the recipe, etc. It was fantastic! Now we wonder what it would taste like made  according to the directions.

I added a lot more parsley because I like how it brightens the flavor. Did add Parmesan. Didn't have porcini or creme fraiche. Still delicious.

Interesting substitute to rice or any other starchy side for that matter. I was off the rails with this recipe, modified it to fit what was on hand in the cupboard.  
I started out  by cooking 1/2 cup of raw farro, to it I added onion and garlic powder, 1 can of mushrooms, drained, 1 tbsp. fat free cream cheese and 1/4 cup of parmesan petals, salt and pepper.  We had it for dinner with BBQ pork ribs and green beans.  Hubby's rating on a scale of 1-5 is 3.5 or 4.
