Awesome!!! I used red wine vinegar because that's all I had on hand, and I added pineapple juice from a small can of crushed pineapple. I also put 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, and the crushed pineapple in the dish along with the chicken while baking. It was perfect! Not too vinegar-y. I think the pineapple juice balanced it well!

I loved this! And so did my boyfriend and my son.  It was so easy! Instead of cornstarch I used 3/4 cups flour.  I just didn't have any.  It was simple and tasted great.  I used chicken breast tenders, so the oven cook time was about 30 mins.  The only thing different I would do; is after I put the chicken in the oven, I would make another bowl of sauce.  It would have been nice to have extra and some to add on the fried rice that I made.  This is a keeper!!

I cut the chicken in bite sized chunks, and used the wok (no oven!).  Added veggies, and yum yum.

This was good but way too vinegary.  I only added 2/3 of the vinegar that the recipe called for because of all the reviews saying to cut down the vinegar.  Next time I will try half of what it calls for. The chicken turned out great this way!  I will just have to alter the sauce a little next time.

Loved this easy sauce. I reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup because I wanted to add some fresh pineapple. I didn't bake the tenders just cooked on the stove top and then topped later with the sauce. Will make again especially the quick sauce.

Tried this last night and it was a hit! So delicious and no artificial food coloring as in some sweet and sour sauces. I doubled the amount of sweet and sour sauce and thickened the extra with cornstarch in a sauce pan on the stove. While the chicken was cooking, I made a pot of brown rice, mixed it with steamed vegetables, then served the chicken on top of the rice and veggies. Those who chose to, drizzled the extra sweet and sour sauce over all. What a great meal! Next time, I may decrease the amount of vinegar to reduce the acid in the sauce. Definitely keeping this recipe handy.

i have made this recipe twice the first time i followed the recipe as is.  i did not care for the taste.  i thought it was the ketchup making the difference.  
forward 3 months later i tried again i used 1/4 vinegar 1//4 sugar and instead of ketchup a sweet &  spicy hot sauce that is pepper based  much better taste to the dish will make again

My boyfriend could not stop talking about this dish.  I was actually getting a bit suspicious the way he was going on about it, but he was being honest.  I did not change the ingredients to the sauce but I did put the cut up bite size chicken pieces in the wok and I threw in some broccoli because I can't get him to eat green things - and he said he LIKED the broccoli in it. I also dredged the chicken in the cornstarch mixture first, then put it in the egg and then coated it with panko flakes. We had it over rice risotto.

Made exactly as written.  My husband & I really thought this was yummy.  Next time I think I will add some chili flakes to the sauce to give it a little heat as well.  Served it with fried rice and a veggie.  The sauce thicken up nicely and coated the chicken.  I would for sure make this again.

Excellent! I too cut the vinegar in half. I chunked the tenders and browned them. Made the sauce in a separate pan omitting the chicken broth and adding about 1/2 cup pineapple juice. When tenderes were browned, I added the sauce to the pan...the sauce thickened right up...wonderful over rice!

This was very tasty. I made it easier by doing it all in one pan-no oven. I cut the chicken tenderloins into roughly 2 inch chunks. After frying them up, I poured the sauce into the same pan and let it simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes, til cooked through. It's a keeper!

Loved it & it was a Big hit with my kids too! (ages 2,3,&7) The only changes I made were using red wine vinegar (it was all I had) and using just over half of what it called for. I cut the chicken into bite sizes pieces before doing anything else. I used a 9x9 dish lined with aluminum foil and I covered it with aluminum foil while cooking. I should have doubled the whole recipe! We will be using this recipe a lot from now on.

Yum! As far as home made Chinese recipes go, this was great. I skipped the browning and just put the sauce over the uncooked chicken and straight into the oven. It was fine. I also used apple cider vinegar because that is what I had. I will make this again when I am craving Chinese sweet and sour. It's quick, easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. Definately a keeper!!

Thia was great. It was my first time and the flavor was wonderful. I added pineapples and green peppers as well as red onions which took some of the vinegar taste away.

I made just a couple of modifications based on others' reviews.  I only used half the amount of cider vinegar, and I added some pineapple juice to the sauce mixture (from a can of crushed pineapple).  The sauce came out really good, but the chicken definitely cooked too long.  I think 40 minutes is way too long for chicken tenders, and it took longer than 5 minutes to brown my chicken in the pan, and I'm wondering if I could skip this step.  My kiddos didn't like it--I think it was because the chicken was overdone, though.  I'll have to try this again but reduce the time in the oven.

This recipe was really good! I only had 8 pieces of chicken tenders, and I used splenda instead of the sugar. It turned out very tasty.

Oh my. I was not expecting this to turn out quite this....fantastic. It doesn't look like Sweet and Sour chicken per se but oh boy it tastes just like it. I did cut the vinegar in half when making the sauce and did add an extra 2 tbsp. after a taste test. Definite keeper!

This is a great recipe to satisfy that Chinese food craving without the grease and thickly battered meat pieces.  I followed the recipe but differed in 2 things: (1) I doubled the sauce and (2) I topped the browned chicken with raw veggies before baking.  We loved the sauce but we love vinegar, so the acidity was not an issue.  We loved how tender the chicken was.  And to have as much veggies as we wanted was great.  Normally, Chinese restaurants will give minimal quantities of that.  I used yellow onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and broccoli.  I drizzled the sauce over all before baking for 35 mins.  The veggies were not crisp, but they weren't mush either.  They kept their color and shape.  We spooned everything on top of steamed rice.  This is a recipe I will repeat again and again!  Thanks.

The chicken was very good as written! I didn't change anything, except I thought I had tenders and I didn't, so I used chicken breasts that I cut into thick strips. Yummy!

Excellent!  The chicken tenders were extremely tender on the inside, crunchy on the outside, perfect.  The sauce was fantastic too; it caramelized very nicely and had great flavor and consistency.  This dish was even better than carryout.  I used half the amount of vinegar based on other reviews, and I omitted the extra salt on accident - which I'll omit next time I make this because it was just fine.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because it was what I had on hand.  This will definitely become part of our regular dinner rotation!

This was a great recipe and accomplished exactly what I was aiming for. I was using bone-in chicken thighs instead of strips so I baked it for about 50 minutes after doing the same pan fry part of the recipe. I also had to increase the measurements for the vinegar mixture to accommodate having more chicken. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is the first review I have done but felt I should after the reaction from my family the first time I made it. They were asking when we could have it again before we even finished the meal. I followed the recipe exactly.  We are having it again tonight. I believe this will be in our regular rotation.

Very good. Also added broccoli, onion, green peppers and a touch of pineapple and a bit of honey to the sauce. My husband loved it. The chicken was very tender and  good and I cut the tenders  into cubes after they were cooked-in the oven.. next time I might add a little less vinegar.  Over all we enjoyed this meal.

Made this tonight. Followed the directions; just doubled the sauce without doubling the vinegar (based on other reviews). Actually, it was a little to sweet for us! Just drizzled a few drops of lemon juice after it came out of the oven to fix that. Also, we didn't use the sauce after it came out of the oven. Just a personal preference. The sauce did keep the chicken nice and moist/juicy while cooking and definitely added great flavor. Will make again, but next time will use 3/4 of the vinegar instead of half. It has a very nice taste; perhaps pineapple would make this 5 stars?!?

We thought this was pretty good.  It wasn't quite as flavorful as we expected.  I would say 3 1/2 stars.   I added some leftover diced onions.  It definitely was tastier when I had a bite with the onions.  I agree with others that it seems to be missing something.  I served it on rice.  It was an easy dish.

So I did not fry the chicken just made the sauce and poured it over the chicken to bake. It was to runny so next time will add cornstarch to thicken first. Realised the chicken rolled in cornstarch would have thickened the sauce.

I used chicken breasts and sliced them into six pieces each, and omitted the egg wash. Because of some comments from other reviewers, I halved the amount of apple cider vinegar and made up the difference with broth. Added some sliced veggies and served over rice. Got the thumbs up from the family, so will make again. Next time, I'll add some pineapple tidbits and a little pineapple juice.

YUMMY!!!  I tried this recipe last night and followed it exactly...It came out GREAT!!!  Served it with white rice and steamed broccoli.  The only thing I would do different is make more of the sauce because my family likes to spoon the sauce over their white rice.  None left!!!  This one is a Keeper!!!

Easy to make and very tasty!  The chicken was a little dry, and most of sauce had evaporated, so next time I'll use double the sauce amount and try covering with foil for 20 mins of the 40 mins cooking time.  Definitely a repeat!

Made these two nights ago and the whole family LOVED it! I used less vinegar like one review suggested (about a quarter less) and it was just right for us.  I doubled the recipe because I have a family of five, two being teenagers. It made a big pan with plenty of leftovers, which got eaten right up the next day. You know they really like it when they want it again the next day! I've already added this to my cookbook containing my very best recipes!!

Awesome flavor!! I followed other suggestions and halved the Cider vinegar amount. Turned out perfect!! Even the picky hubby loved it! This method of dredging the chicken in corn starch and pan frying then baking in the sauce is perfect!! Would love to try with other sauces!

Will definitely make again! My changes weren't too crazy... I reduced the sugar by AT LEAST half & substituted with the juice from the canned pineapple also added to the dish. I cooked the chicken and glazed as stated, then removed from pan. I then sauteed cut red & orange pepper & sugar snap peas. Served over rice. Yum!!

I cut back on the vinegar but won't next time.  It is needed to balance the amount of sugar.  As others, I sauteed red and green peppers and onion after browning the chicken.  I added these to the sauce along with some pineapple. My family really liked it.

The photo showed pineapple and pepper but they weren't in the ingredients.  I cut 1/2 green bell pepper in thin slices and sauteed in pan after I removed browned chicken.  I added some canned pineapple chunks and added to chicken before I poured the vinegar mixture over it.  I will double the sauce next time.

Came out great. I added chili powder, garlic powder,salt and onion powder to the corn starch. I used half vinegar as suggested and cooked it in a skillet instead of the oven. I know it would be crispier in the oven. It had a great taste. I precut the chicken into bite size pieces.

I made a couple of changes due to dietary issues. I used turkey breast tenders (which still worked surprisingly!) and I replaced the sugar with a natural stevia based sugar substitute. The taste was superb. 

One note: I made extra sauce so instead of pouring it over the  poultry, I cooked the extra sauce in a pan to use for dipping. The sauce that baked with the turkey was delicious. The sauce in the pan was not. The recipe was perfect! 

Never heard of using cider vinegar and ketchup for a sweet and sour sauce, so I was cringing when I served it to my super finicky husband. After his 3rd serving he asked for it to be part of our regular meal repertoire.

This turned out better than I expected. I used a large can of chunked pineapple and its juice in the sauce, no broth, too much liquid. Very tasty.

Delicious! I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy. Just didn't have any. Added pineapple, red, yellow and orange petite peppers, and onion  and used leftover pineapple juice to  the sauce. Served over white rice. Fabulous meal!

Used pineapple juice instead of chicken broth per reviews. Meant to reduce vinegar but forgot. Kids loved it. Next time I'll remember to reduce the vinegar. Served over basmati rice.

I cut my tenders in half lengthwise.  After browning as per recipe I added 1 cut up red and  1 green bell pepper, and 2 scallions.  Cut t sugar to less than 1/4 cup and cider vinegar to l 1/4 cup.  I added 2 cups chicken broth.  Followed rest of recipe.  Covered with aluminum foil for 30 minutes.  Uncovered and added pineapple chunks.  Baked for 5 more minutes.  It was delicious.  My son in law who said he didn't like sweet and sour had two helpings.  Served it over rice.

I made it following the recipe BUT didn't bake it as long & it was still almost over cooked! I baked for 30 after frying, was on the dry side but still good! Also, too much ketchup, was a tad overpowering. All in all, loved by my whole family & pretty easy to make! Made w rice & baked w asparagus & carrots.

Its a good dish.  After seasoning I rolled the chunks in flour then egg and finally in the bread crumbs.  The sauce is a little sweet, missing something, so I cut the sugar a little and added chicken broth.  The curry is a little spicy but I liked it.

This is a family favorite. We always add pineapples and usually add carrots, bell peppers, and onions to make it a one pot dish with the addition of sticky rice. This has become one of my week night go-to's.

I just started learning to cook and this was a great dish to make.  It was not hard but still complicated enough that I learned a few things, especially about browning the chicken before baking it.  I think it is to make the chicken coating crisper.

It tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Used two large boneless chicken breasts. I cut mine up into little pieces and cooked in a skillet first because I was short on time.  I cooked with vegetable oil and put garlic on them while cooking and sprinkled a little white wheat flour on them.  Allergic to corn so didn't use that.  Made the sauce as directed and after the chicken was JUST barely finished in skillet (still really white)  I put into a casserole dish and poured the sauce on it.   Cooked 30 minutes. The last 8 or 10 minutes I broiled watching carefully. It browned the top for a delicious dish.  Not alot of breading at all - mostly just the chicken. Sauce was wonderful!

As per other reviews, I used pineapple juice in place of the broth, doubled the sauce ingredients except for the vinegar.  I used Splenda instead of the sugar. Put some chopped pineapple in the baking dish with the browned chicken, put large strips of bell pepper over the chicken then poured the sauce over.  Used 8 chicken tenders cut into bite sized pieces.  Covered pan with foil and baked about 30 minutes. Turned out great. Served over white rice with a side of stir fry vegetables. Picky husband even asked for seconds, which emptied the pan so double the whole recipe for more than 2-3 people.

This was a very good recipe, 4 stars as is  and 5 stars with a few changes.  I doubled recipe as have more than 4 people to feed.  I did not double apple cider vinegar tho, left it at 1/2 cup as other reviewers suggested.  Added 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/2 of 14 Oz can chunked pineapples. Used 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup flour to dip chicken in as others suggested.  I omitted oven and cooked it all in a large skillet.  After browning chicken (also added 1 diced red sweet pepper while browning chicken) I removed it to combine the sauce then added it back to the skillet to cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes.  Sauce was a bit watery to me so I thickened it with a cornstarch and water mixture (approximately 3 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water) at end of 15 mins.

This was very good.  The best part was the chicken was done to perfection and tasted like it had been done in a Chinese restaurant.  I think I can credit the cornstarch with that. I added about 1/3 of a green pepper and a small can of pineapple chunks.   I make a double batch of sauce to which I added a little pineapple juice.  I did think the sauce was a little sour.  Will add a little brown sugar next time.

I left out the ketchup, only used 1/2 of the vinegar as suggested, and did it in one pan on stovetop.  Very easy and good. It looked like far too much time in the oven and used more dishes!

We were looking for a different chicken dish and this was a great find. Instead of chicken fingers cut up boneless chicken breasts into 1 inch by 2 inch strips. Served over rice.Great taste

This  is a very quick, easy and good tasting sauce.  The only change I made was to reduce the soya sauce to 1-2 tbsp.

I made this recipe just as it is written.  Hubby and I loved it.  He was bragging about  it the next day.  Am sure we will have again and again.  
Will probably add veggies next time, and possibly doubling sauce to accommodate the veggies and have extra to put over the rice.  
Thank you for a great easy recipe.

I didn't have potatoes so I substituted rice. Didn't have paprika so I used another spice. Didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste; a whole can not a half can since I don't believe in waste. A friend gave me the recipe, she said you couldn't beat it...There must be something wrong with her...I couldn't even eat it!

My family loved this dish. It reminded them of general tsao's chicken from our favorite Chinese restaurant. Each piece of chicken had a perfect crispiness on the outside and soft and tender inside. Didn't make any changes.. Will definitely add to my rotation of meals.

Really easy to make and yummy!!!  Agree with other reviewers to cut the vinegar in half. I used 1/4 and it still was too much.  Otherwise it's really good.

The reviews here were helpful.  I added red and green bell peppers, and celery to the chicken; and substituted pineapple juice for the chicken broth.  I also added pineapple chunks to the chicken before putting it in the over, and had sesame seeds and cilantro as a garnish.  I cooked it for 20 minutes covered with foil and 20 minutes uncovered, because I was afraid the sauce would bubble off otherwise.  
My family loved it.  The chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauce was delightful without being too sweet or too tangy.  My guys are picky eaters but they enjoyed this one!

Yum. What more can I say?  Made exactly as recipe stated but made 1/2  extra recipe of sauce which I simmered then dumped over chicken when it came out of the oven. My picky son kept saying "this is soooo good".  I served on top of noodles and blanched veggies (be sure to put sauce on veggies, too). 5 Stars!

Made this recipe tonight. We all thought it was great! I did add pineapple, green pepper and onion. I also added a slosh of pineapple juice to the sauce. I liked how easy it was compared with other sweet and sour recipes I have used. The balance between sweet and vinegar was perfect.

Very easy and quite delicious! - After I made a few adjustments. It was too sour for me (and I love sour) which meant it would be worse for my husband. I added a little more: sugar, soy sauce and chicken broth. I cooked it in the skillet with the chicken once that had crisped up and let it thicken and my husband said it was great! That we can have this more often!! Hooray!!!

I loved this!  So quick and easy. I cut the vinegar from 1/2 to 1/3 cups, but followed the recipe exactly, otherwise.  I cut the chicken tenders into chunks, and it was great.  Next time, I'll leave them whole and double the sauce.  This is a definite keeper.

I made this recipe and it's delicious! Actually that's my picture on the profile:) thanks all recipes:) I often get recipes from all recipes and  this one tops the cake. I added some pineapple juice to the broth mixture and I cooked it on the stove first. Added some red peppers, yellow peppers and pineapple after cooking it for about 10 minutes and cooked it an additional 10 minutes just to steam them a little bit and it was phenomenal! Thanks again all recipes!!

These were really good. I cut in pieces, dredged in the cornstarch, and stir fried. Meanwhile I made the sauce in a separate pan. I threw some pineapple chunks in with the chicken and a little of the sauce and browned, then I just threw in the sauce and stirred until it thickened. My go-to recipe for S & S from now on. I added some broccoli and carrots for veg. Mmmmmmm

This recipe was delicious. My 6 and 2 year old both gobbled it up, along with rice and broccoli. I followed the directions exactly, except I used 1/4 cup of Apple cider vinegar. I will definitely add this into our dinner rotation menu.

way better than I expected! I didn't brown the chicken first, I made the marinade, I didn't have cider vinegar, I used pineapple juice from a can of crushed pineapples and 3 tbs of white vinegar …and put the teaspoon of garlic salt n marinade …I put the chicken in a baking pan (I used chicken legs, didn't have tenders) baked at 375° 45 mins covered with foil …took the chicken out poured the marinade and I bowl and added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it was a little thin, stirred it up and then put it back in the pan with the chicken and baked for an additional 10 - 15 minutes....I honestly at first didn't think it was going to be good when I got through making the marinade it smelled vinegary and I didn't like it, I cooked it anyways and it turned out to be very tasty!!!!!

these were OH SOO CLOSE but definitely NOT right.  They need pineapple on them.  I will have to work at tweaking these with a proper sweet and sour recipe.

Pretty good.  I used a store bought sweet and sour mix plus the vinegar.  Even the picky family liked it.

Made this recipe again.  This time I made 4 times the amount of sauce, but cut the proportion of vinegar by about 1/4, so to 2 cups of sugar (or Splenda), 1 cup each chicken broth and catsup, I had about 1 1/2 cups of vinegar, and about 1/4 cup of Ponzu Sauce.  I also added pineapple chunks with about 1/2 cup of juice, red & green pepper strips, and onion strips.  Cooked as before, stirring 'til it started to simmer, then added the chicken pieces which had been dipped in the cornstarch/garlic powder mixture.  I let it simmer for 40 minutes or so, turning from time to time.  It turned out even better than before.  For those who didn't like the cider vinegar, you might try rice wine vinegar.  I personally don't care for cider vinegar in most recipes, so use white vinegar, but I do like the rice wine vinegar, too, and find it not quite as sour as cider vinegar.

OMG...this was sooo good! My 7 year old asked for thirds!! Now going to be in the "I love it" recipes. Did cut down the vinegar (as previous posts had mentioned) by half, and doubled the sauce recipe for serving. Had the perfect sweet and sour taste without the added coloring and preservatives. I will be making this again...........

This recipe was amazing.  I didn't have cider vinegar on hand so used 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 1/4 cup of raspberry wine vinegar...amazing! I also just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts pounded thin instead of tenders. I definitely recommend!

Delicious and easy! Next time I plan to add 1/4 tsp. of Louisiana Hot Sauce and some onion and green pepper to the sauce.
