These tasted good and were an interesting change of pace.  Unfortunately, the whole wheat flour completely overpowered the squash.  Semolina flour might be a better choice for letting the squash flavor come through.

ohhhhhhhhhhhh my gosh, heavenly!!  I didnt have sage so I had to use a bit of rosemary and thyme instead but it still turned out AMAZING.  Quite a simple recipe  but a bit time consuming--worth it.  It took more flour than the recipe says but I did mine all whole wheat.

The gnocchi itself is great and so simple - thank you! 2nd time I made it, I added a tspn of pumpkin pie spice (blend of ginger, cinn, nutmeg, allspice) to dough. I didn't care for the beurre blanc at all. Next time I heated up butter, sage, pinch of salt/pepper in pan and tossed gnocchi with it - made the gnocchi a little crisp on outside - fantastic and paired well with the pumpkin pie spice.

Making the gnocchi was much more time consuming than I thought it would be, but turned out great.  In forming the dough, 1 cup of white flour was not enough to make the dough workable, I probably used an additional cup or so.  There was a slight bitterness to the dish overall, maybe due to the beer in the beurre blanc, and I'm not sure if it was supposed to taste like that.  But nonetheless, it was delicious, and my family and I enjoyed it.  Thank you!

I was excited to try this recipe. I have a few comments: The gnocchi were pretty easy to make, but there really should be a weight for the squash instead of simply "one acorn squash".  I think that has a lot to do with the other reviewers having to add more flour.   I also added more flour.  I can't decide if that made them dense or if they are supposed to be dense!   I don't have a garlic press, so I minced it.  I would suggest substituting garlic powder, sauteeing it first or putting it in the sauce instead of the gnocchi.  Biting into a pocket of raw garlic isn't so appealing.    I used the Creamy Sage Butter Sauce, as another reviewer recommended.  At any rate, I can't stop eating these dense little dumplings.

I gave it 4 stars for the way I made this dish. It probably would have been better if I hadnt used frozen squash, but sonce I did it was too wattery, and therefore I had to use a-lot of flour, and it was too dense. Next time I will use fresh squash, or I will strain the frozen squash.It had a really nice flavor in spite of my mistake.

This requires time and patience (and way more white flour than called for), but it's fun, tasty and satisfying.  I wanted a creamier sauce so I served this with "Creamy Sage Butter Sauce."

The gnocci was good.  If you have to disguise squash, this is a good way to do it.  I used only white flour and I used about 3.5 cups.  The brown butter sauce suggested was good, but not really worth the time it took to cook it.  This was a lot of prep, and good not great.

I didn't try the sauce, but this gnocchi was yummy.  Even my 4 year old asks for it, and I have a hard time getting him to eat veggies!  Thank you!

Very good! I only made the gnocchi and did not try the "blanc" just  to use up some of my acorns from the garden. I allowed them to dry and then place them in storage bags in the freezer for use all winter. I can't wait to try them as dumplings with chicken. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good! It was my first time making gnocchi, and it did take much more time than I planned. My squash had to be cooked in the microwave longer than 10 minutes (I took it out after 10, and it was still hard in the middle, put it in for probably another 10). I didn't use the "sage beurre blanc" but instead made a browned butter sage sauce. Yummy!

I made this recipe mainly because I love gnocchi but am allergic to potatoes. This made an excellent substitute. I gave it 4 stars, because the sauce for us was a take it or leave it kind of thing and not really worth the extra 25 minutes of cook time. Like the other reviewers I used more than the 1 cup of white flour when making the dough. Really, just keep adding flour till you get the texture described in the directions. I will definitely make the gnocchi again but will probably serve with a different sauce.

Great recipe!  Takes a bit of time but easy and it tastes great.  The parmesean sage sauce was a little salty (and I like salt) so will likely cut down the salt in the water next time.  Still definately worth making!  Also, we fed three adults with the suggested serving of 8 so you may need to adjust the serving size if making this for more people.

Only made the sauce and made plain potato gnocchi.  Was delightfully surprised with how well the sauce turned out.  Would have wanted it to be a bit thicker, and wish I had fresh parmesan on hand.

I made the gnocchi themselves as written, adding (as others have mentioned) more white flower until the dough became workable.  I didn't have the ingredients for the sauce, so I just tossed the gnocchi with butter and sage.  I wondered, while they were cooking, if they'd be worth the work...they were!  Great recipe, thank you!

I omitted the salt, forgot to add the egg, and used only whole wheat flour when making the gnocchi.  For the sauce, I omitted the bouillon, and changed the beer to soy milk.  I also added some chopped onion to the sauce.  This is delicious!  Portion control went out the window when devouring these, they went so quickly!  i will be making these again!

I was disappointed that these didnt taste like squash! I even added a bit of sugar to the dough, and some cinnamon to the butter sauce (which did help). I agree that the whole wheat flour is overpowering. These weren't bad, just not as delicious as I expected.

Like a previous reviewer states, the whole wheat overpowers. I use only white flour and it's fantastic. Also watch the size of you let squash. If it's really big you may need to alter the recipe.

Well these were about the ugliest things I have ever made - BUT this recipe makes a very traditional chewy gnocchi that I just love!  My dough was still too sticky after 3 cups of flour so as I formed my gnocchi and put them on a plate, then ended up sticking together.  So my advice, either spread them out or throw them into your pot of boiling water as you form them.    I think the extra flour does take away from the squash flavor but it's still a great way to sneak in some veggies.  I didn't make the sauce, but instead make a quick brown butter and sage sauce.  Next time I'm going to try homemade tomato sauce.

Review is for the gnocchi only, since I made my own sauce in order to use up some mushrooms and some white wine that were getting old...

I thought these tasted good - it's the instructions that are an issue. As others have noted, the amount of flour needed will depend on how big a squash you have. In order to figure out the right proportions, I peeled and cubed my squash before cooking it. I also halved the recipe, so my flour amounts are for just half a squash. I ended up with about 3.25 cups of squash, and had to use 1.5 total cups of flour (50% more than called for). I should have used more. I still wasn't able to roll it into a log after adding the extra flour, but I didn't want the flour to overwhelm the squash, and I was getting hungry and tired of mixing more flour in...so I just scooped up small amounts of the dough in a spoon and used my fingers to push the dough off the spoon into the boiling water. My gnocchi turned out wildly misshapen because the dough was still so sticky, but it worked, they cooked just fine, and they still tasted good. The squash gave them just a hint of sweetness, which I liked. I also liked that these use part whole wheat flour. (For my extra half cup of flour, I used buckwheat instead of more white flour to keep things a little more nutritious - and also because I needed to use it up. Worked great.) So there were a number of good aspects to this gnocchi recipe; the amount of flour was the only issue I had. Thanks for the recipe!

The gnocchi were great.  I skipped the sauce and used a simple alfredo instead.  Since others said it was too heavy on the wheat flour and I had semolina flour, I used 1/2 a cup of each.  It needed more white flour as well.

I'd love to make this, but could someone please tell me what to do with the squash if I don't have a microwave.  I'm worried halving it and putting it in the oven will bake it too much since it's supposed to be microwaved whole.  I rated 4 stars because it sounds delicious, but there is a lack of information for people who aren't microwave users.

Great recipe for the gnocchi!  We used dark beer in the sauce, and it was VERY bitter.  We will definitely have the gnocchi again (the recipe made a lot, we froze the rest), but with a different sauce.  It took a lot more white flour to make it workable, and you'll have to vary the microwave time for the size of your squash and power of your microwave.

This was delicious and surprisingly easy to make. I just did the gnocchi and made my own sauce. I used the Kitchen Aid to mix the dough. I took it out of the mixer once it was firm but still a little sticky, this took about 1/2 of extra flour. I used a lot of flour on the rolling board.

Really easy and yummy. Nice change of pace from potato gnocchi. My husband and I really liked the sauce. Does take a while to make. Good for a lazy Sunday.

I felt like a true chef after I made these.  They were delicious - and a great way to use acorn squash, which is one of my least favorite vegetables!  I make a lot of gnocchi (my mom's Italian), but I'd never incorporated squash into the mix.  Next time I'm not going to put quite as much beer in the sauce - I used a Korean beer (don't ask why) and toward the end of dinner I was not as enthusiastic to finish them as I was when I began :(  I'll definitely be serving these again!

Very tasty! Had to add a lot more than 1 cup of white flour to get the right dough consistency, but I think it depends on the size of your squash.  My boyfriend and I don't drink beer, so we used apple cider instead and it turned out GREAT.  For those without microwaves: Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds.  Place it cut side down in a Pyrex or similar pan.  Pour boiling water into the Pyrex to 1/4 inch deep.  Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, flip to cut side up, bake a bit longer until squash is tender.

I think a lot of the negative reviews on here are from people missing the point.  Acorn squash in itself, is pretty bland, hence why people add spices, etc to it.  I do believe the creator of this recipe had that in mind as she said she didn't care for it and therefore was wanting to disguise it.  There is a bonus in that it cuts down substantially on the starch as opposed to potato gnocchi.  For those wanting to be able to *taste* the squash, I suggest you use a Butternut Squash as it has a stronger flavour.

This recipe is a great starting point. You can tweak it in so many directions. Yes, you do have to be mindful of the ratio of flour to squash, but that depends on exactly how much squash you have. Therefore people, you should not take the flour amounts verbatim!  I used a small squash, which yielded about 4 cups of cooked squash, I used only 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour and 1 cup of AP flour plus more for kneading in until I had a soft dough that was no longer sticky.  Reason for only using 1/2 c ww flour is personal preference, I find any dough can get overly tough with too much ww flour.  Gnocchi's are supposed to be soft, little pillows, not tough, rubbery nuggets.  This did make a huge amount (I was just making it for me as I was solo for dinner) so I froze the rest on a cookie sheet for doling out later.  I didn't make the sauce but chose to use my own spicy homemade pasta sauce.  Delectable little pillows indeed.  Thank you SPEARL20 for a great recipe!
