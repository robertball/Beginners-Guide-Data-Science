This was a good recipe, however, I crumbled the sausage up instead of making patties and it turned out well this way.  You can never have too many side dish recipes and I am sure this will come in handy for the next party.  Thanks for sharing.

A very good recipe, I followed the advice of someone else and crumbled the sausage which worked great. We found it a little greasy so next time I will eliminate the butter, as even after draining the sausage there was still grease.

I used home made sausage (yum!), added a chopped Granny Smith apple and a handful of dried cranberries and chopped celery. I was thinking of using persimmons along with the apples.  Think it might be good that way, too! I also omitted the sugar and cinnamon, as the fruit added the sweetness.  Made a great, healthful all-in-one Autumn dish!

This was really good.  I like sweet potatoes with brown sugar, butter and cinnamon, but was looking for something a little different for Thanksgiving dinner today.  The sausage was awesome.  I used links and cut them into small pieces after cooking.  My only mistake was overcooking the sweet potatoes.  It turned out to be more like a casserole than sweet potato chunks, but the taste was just as awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I had Sweet Italian Brats on hand, so I chopped them into tiny pieces in place of ground sausage. I Loved it! Thanks!!!

I had a friend bake this for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous!  I loved it so much it will permanently remain on our turkey day menu.

This was a hit, even with the people who don't like sweet potatoes. I'm sure it will become a Thanksgiving staple.

This was delicious.  I substituted lite smoked sausage cut into small pieces and it was equally as good.  I also made the entire recipe in the microwave to save time.

Delicious! I used chopped up link sausages, and made sure to leave the sweet potatoes a bit undercooked in the first cooking because I wanted them to maintain some nice bite-texture. I also added a chopped honeycrisp apple and a handful of raisins. Delish and so easy!

Used maple breakfast sausage. There were no leftovers from this one -- everyone devoured it. 

A nice modification for this would be to peel, dice, and then roast the potatoes, to make more of a hash-type casserole. Serve it with a poached, sunny-side-up, or other slightly runny egg over it, and you have a really delicious breakfast that looks like you worked really hard on, when in reality it was as simple as can be! :)

No one else in my house was crazy about this, but I love it! Make sure you use maple sausage so the flavors mesh.
