This is exactly how my Grandma always cooked green beans out of the garden. Only change made was she cut the bacon up into bits, sauteed it in her cast iron skillet with a little butter and threw in the green beans and saute it a little before adding the water, pepper and salt. This takes me right back to childhood whenever I make it.

These were excellent! They had that southern vegetable taste, without frying up a bunch of bacon or cooking the vegetables in tablespoons of bacon grease. It made the texture much better too, in my opinion. I wasn't sure what this Kentucky bean was, so I used an 18oz bag of pictsweet brand whole green beans. I didn't even bother to defrost them. I just did the water to about 1/2" only to make up for the excess water of the frozen beans. For the bacon, I only had pre-cooked bacon which is really thin. So, I used 2 slices. It was perfect. I had finished the beans, and realized I missed the clove of garlic. They didn't need them. I will definitely be making these again, esp. with the calorie count. They were great with a seafood main dish. Thanks!

I was craving green beans and used this recipe. I added about a 1/2 tsp of onion powder to it. Very tasty! This recipe has been added to my recipe box.

Fantastic. I used extra bacon and added a bit of chicken bouillon to the water, but followed the recipe otherwise. The beans were a big hit. I will definitely make these again. Thanks!

I came across Kentucky Wonder beans in the supermarket yesterday and decided to give them a try.  Their appearance before cooking could lead one to suspect that they might be tough and stringy, but they were surprising tender, "meaty", and flavorful when prepared following this recipe.  I didn't have any bacon on hand, so used some chopped smoked ham.  This has been added to my list of vegetable basics!

I loved them - I made it with fresh green beans from the store and they were very tasty!
