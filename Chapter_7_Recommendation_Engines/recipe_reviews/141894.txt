My husband, who's diabetic, loves sweet, hot dipping sauces but the ones found in the grocery stores contain far too much sugar. I make this one for him and he just loves the way it compliments any Chinese meal we have. Its great!

Simple and delicious - a nice combination of sweet and spicy! I did end up cutting the amount of Splenda in half, but overall this was a nice accompaniment to Chinese dumplings.
