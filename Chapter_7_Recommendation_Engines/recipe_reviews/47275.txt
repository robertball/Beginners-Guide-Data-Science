Very good pie.The first pie I made I baked at 425° as directed, but left off the topping. The crust got too brown. The second pie I baked at 375° for 35 minutes and then I reduced the oven temperature to 325° and baked another 25 minutes(I omitted the nut topping).I covered the edges loosely with foil the entire cooking time and it was perfect. This is a very sweet pie. You could reduce the sugar somewhat.

The taste was a big hit with my friends, but I found it needed to cook quite a bit longer than the recommended 30-35 minutes.  I ended up turning down the heat so that the crust wouldn't burn.  The filling was tasty and people who told me they didn't like pumpkin pie said they LOVED this!

I have to say, this is a very good pie.  Very sweet and very fluffy.  I did not add the topping though, because I used the pecans already in the crust and I thought that might be to much pecans.  This recipe makes a little more filling than I thought.  I used the rest in a med. sized custard cup and cooked it along with the pie. Very delicious. Thanks

This was my first ever pie and perfect! I was a born baker, so I did alter it a lil. I used 2 16 oz. Bruce's canned pineapple-orange sweet potatoes, drained & mashed, instead of 1 can of mashed yams... I also added 1 Tsp. of vanilla extract to mix. Instead of suggested topping ~ I baked this for an extra 10-15 min. w/mini marshmellows and chopped pecans sprinkled on top.((until mellows are lightly browned and puffy)) It made for a pretty pie!  This recipe was great w/the never never fail pie pastry (again, altered) I rate ***** for both! I had tons of compliments and will continue to make this for every major holiday!

OK - forget the part where this is an absolutely wonderful pie!  The best part is that it makes enough for two 9" pies but freezes very very well.  I used 1/2 at Thanksgiving, froze the remainder and then thawed and used it again at Christmas (by family demand).  It's a keeper.

This is really good but I wish I would have read diamondlil's baking recommendations ahead of time.  I baked as directed, even covering in foil for 1/2 the time and baking on a higher rack and still came just short of burning the crust.  Still edible but a few more mins. and it would have been ruined.  Having said all that, this was my first time making or trying a sweet potato pie and thought it was fabulous.  I told my kids it was a pumpkin pie so they would eat it and no one, except my husband, could really tell the difference.  I didn't think this was a very thick pie so I wouldn't recommend the deep dish crust - a regular one should be fine.  Also, the nut topping was quite sweet so I would cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 a cup or a little less.  This will be on our Thanksgiving menu this year!

Excellent!  But, very sweet.  Really good served with slightly sweetened whipped cream.  (I only added about 1 TBL sugar per cup of cream)

This was the first sweet potato pie I ever made/tasted!  Everyone loved it!!  The topping makes the pie!  The canned sweet potatoes make it even easier to make. Just be sure to puree them or it won't turn out!!

Great, Great, Great!  This was a big hit at the office and with my family!  I cut the sugar a bit the second time I made it because I found it too sweet. I will definitely make this again!

I recently made this to use up some sweet potatoes that I had and served it to some some southern friend who were visiting me in Germany. The mother of my friends was so impressed that she said "This is simply the best sweet potatoe pie that I've had in years. Not to sweet and not to heavy." If one just reduces the amount of sugar in the recipe, and combined with the "Never, never fail pie pastry" you have a perfect dessert.

I was not too thrilled, but it was my own fault.  I used fresh sweet potato insead of canned and I think that made the difference.  Still had an okay flavor, just a little bland for my taste.  I'll will try this recipe again.

I will never make another pumpkin pie!  This recipe is FABULOUS!  It disappeared in mintes and I'm on my fourth pie in two weeks.  GREAT RECIPE.
