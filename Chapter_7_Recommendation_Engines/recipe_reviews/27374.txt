YUM - had a brunch & made this for the kids ... I couldn't keep the adults away!  I bought the pizza dough to save time & sprinkled it with the oregano.  Recipe is a keeper - Thanks for sharing!

I used turkey bacon and a different packaged crust, and it was amazing.

Soooo good.  The crust is easy to make and the toppings are delicious.  The recipe never calls for draining the bacon drippings so I didn't; however next time I make this, I'll probably drain off half.

I made this today and actually found it really good for a change from my usual pizza.  I added turkey sausage and also put some Tex mex cheese on before adding samali, pepperoni and ham on top.

Good for brunch.  When using instant yeast, I actually let it rise a full 20 minutes.  If your warm place for proofing is like mine, cooler on one side than the side close to the heat source, I turn the bowl around half way through proofing.  I recommend draining some of the fat from the bacon and onion step before adding the eggs.  You'd want a soft scramble on the eggs.  I'd add a little grated cheddar to the top.  The options are endless on this recipe.

I used already made pizza dough. It worked well! I just sprinkled the oregano on top and bottom and pushed it in before baking. If you have a pizza stone: USE IT! It made the crust perfect. Also, don't forget the pizza sauce. I accidentally did, and the hubby said it would be better with it! Also, I used turkey bacon, and more of it in place of the salami. It worked too!
