Love the soup..but didn't go for all the dairy products.   I used chicken broth instead of the heavy cream...added chives....used "real" shredded cheese instead of the velveeta.    Ham or chorizo are welcome additions too.   I threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook on low for 5 hours....very comforting on a chilly day.   Very versatile.   Thank you!    If the soup is too thin for your liking,  try adding in some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it up.

It was very delicious but I also used all shredded cheese rather then the Velveeta. Definitely tastes better the next day after all the flavors exchange and soak up.

I have made this soup many, many times and it is always delicious.  When my best friend was going through chemo treatments, I would make and freeze multiple bags of this soup so she always had it on hand.  It was the one food that she could consistently keep down after her treatments.  Also, with all the calories and carbs, it helped keep weight on her as she fought her illness. I'm happy to say that she is now a BC Survivor and she swears this soup is one of the reasons. This is a very hearty and delicious soup and super easy to make. It a great soup on a cold winter night and it absolutely hits the spot. It's definitely not a low fat meal but when you are craving a high carb, hearty, stick to your ribs soup, this is it!!

The other lady who commented about the soup curdling was right. Mine curdled too. It was ok, not great. Definitely wonâ€™t try this recipe again. Too much dairy.

Dont add the chedder cheese in right away if you can stand there and stir it non stop or if your busy in the kitchen it will settle and burn on the bottom of the pot. Other than that i shouldve just stuck to my own potato soup recipe it is less time consuming and doesnt involve baking potatos

I halved the recipe and it still made a lot. This soup is very tasty but it is VERY rich! I found that a small bowl really filled me up. The soup is full of potato and bacon-y cheesy yum so it makes a nice main dish soup. Really good with a salad and some crusty bread.

I used 1/2 the amount of butter.  Also 1/2 the salt amount. Added half n half instead of milk. Used organic chicken broth. And only added half the cheese to the soup. Reserved the rest of the cheese as garnish. Also half the amount of sour cream. I boiled my potatoes way easier the peel than baked ones.  Absolutely delicious.

Thin and Curdled. Maybe I did something wrong...? Wasn't thick and creamy like I'd hoped.

I made it exact to the recipe, except the Velveeta cheese. I couldn't find it in the store so I used slices. It turned out awesome. Thank you for the recipe.
