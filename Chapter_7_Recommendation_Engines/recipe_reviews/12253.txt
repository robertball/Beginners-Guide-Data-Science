The custard filling was a bit soggy the first time i made it, but I added another teaspoon of cornstarch to make it more durable. However, the taste turned out delicious and creamy!

This pie was excellent!  I added a tad more cornstarch as recommended by other users.  Will make again.  I am not even a cream pie lover!  The almond in the meringue sets this off as special!

My husband doesn't really like these kinds of pies, but he really liked this one. The crust did get a bit soggy, so I'll add another tablespoon of cornstarch next time. Other than that it was a good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Graham wafer pie has always been my husband's favorite and the only thing his mother made that I also make for him (for fifty years now).  No matter what you call it, the men all love it.

My Mom made this for me as a child and I now make it.  We only use 2 egg whites in the meringue and do not use the almond extract.  A very quick, easy, comforting dessert!

Simply delicious custard pie!  Reminds me of an old fashioned style pie my great grandmother made, didn't change a thing, came out perfect, had NO leftovers!

Excellent Recipe!  I added an extra tsp of cornstarch as another person had suggested and it turned out great... tasted just like the flapper pie I remember eating years ago!  I wanted to make it in advance so I prepared the recipe to the egg white stage and refrigerated over night, then made the egg white topping the next day and baked. I wasn't sure how it would be but it was fine.  I do think it would better made and eaten on the same day though as I noticed that the crust was getting a bit soggy as I cut the pie to serve.

Found the directions confusing so giving it a 4. Tasted good but did not thicken as much as I had hoped

It was like drinking almond, egg sugar soup.  I tried cooking later at 425 for another 20 minutes, until crust was almost burnt, and it was finally edible and no longer soupy, raw eggs. Regardless, it was way too sweet. No reason to ever need so much sugar. And I love almond extract, but it overpowered the recipe. Might try again but would make huge changes, including actually cooking the pie.

Excellent pie!  Added a bit more cornstarch, but didn't need to change anything else.
