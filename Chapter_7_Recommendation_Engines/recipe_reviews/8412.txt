Follow the suggestion to serve it with ice cream or whipped cream.  It is not tasty enough by itself.

Very good, moist cake. Easy to make. It didn't take quite as long to bake as the recipe says; mine was done after 35 minutes.

Yum! Turned out very moist and delicious. Definitely top with cool-whip, but it still is good without too. It was plenty sweet, I used homemade jarred apple pie filling. We all ate it last night for a treat, then hubby and I finished it off for breakfast this morning. Delicious! The only substitution I would make, which I always do, is to use unsweetened applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. I do this in any recipe calling for oil. It turns out just as moist and is waaaay healthier. Great recipe!

This cake is SO good! I made it at school for a class and everyone LOVED IT! It was very easy to make. My only problem was that it burned a little around the edges and the inside still hadn't baked, but I'm going to guess it was the oven. Two thumbs up! :-)

This cake was easy to make, moist, and delicious.  I did make a few changes, though.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil, I used one cup white flour and one cup whole wheat flour, and I only used 1 cup of sugar and it's plenty sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had 1 ¾ cups of homemade ‘Apple Pie Filling’ by Terri (AR) to use before it spoiled.  Found this simple cake to use it in.  I only had a half cup of vegetable oil left, so I used it and filled the rest of the measuring cup with applesauce – worked perfectly.  The cake was finished baking in 35 minutes, any longer and it would have been dried out.  For a simple cake, without any icing, this was wonderful.  I cannot believe how moist it was and how many days it remained moist.  I ate mine for breakfast and the rest of the family enjoyed theirs as a dessert in lunches and in the evening.

I used whole wheat flour and it still came out really good. I baked it for 45 minutes and the top around the edges was just a little hard. It may have been the wheat flour.

So good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used pumpkin pie filling instead of apple. It tastes perfect, you need the amount of sugar it calls for, because it sweetens the pumpkin. Hearty and filling! I baked mine for 55 mins, and it's moist and delicious. I lined my pan with butter and flour before baking. Lovely! I'll do this one again.

I was looking for an easy recipe that used apple pie filling and this fit the bill. It was moist and had a great balance of flavor. But be warned. Since a large portion of the cake is made out of the filling, the middle of the cake tastes a bit raw... I'm sure that won't be an issue for those of you that eat raw dough. Enjoy!!

Outstanding! So moist and yummy and a snap to through together. I had a craving for cake and made this in no time. I think I would like to experiment with other pie filling flavors next time. Very versatile and easy peasy.

I chose this recipe doing an ingredient search to use a can of pie filling I wanted to get rid of. So easy & quick to throw together. Didn't measure the pie filling, just used the whole can but I did chop up the apples so they were smaller. I also added extra cinnamon(because I do it w/anything that calls for cinnamon) & added a pinch of ground cloves. Loved it! Took it to a dessert potluck & it was a hit!

Great recipe! Super easy to make, my 10 year old did it with no trouble and it was very moist and delicious. I checked it at 35 minutes as Brian suggested and it was done, just a little crumb on the toothpick, perfect. Will be making this often!
