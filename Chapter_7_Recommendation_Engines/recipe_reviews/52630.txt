I am sorry, but that is disgusting.  You could make a good grilled cheese in the same amount of time by grilling it, as in GRILLED CHEESE!

Many of us men have used this on at one time or another. When you dont have a pan, from being either, on the road, or under the poverty line, this method is the winning horse. I mean, when a guy needs a grilled cheese, you've just gotta suck it up, haha. Not to mention this is better for you then being fried in butter and fat.

If you're really under the poverty line, and dont have a toaster, move the oven rack up to the top and toast the bread with that ovens broiler. :) You can't stop a determined man from enjoying a grilled cheese!

Ah, the modern day version of stoveless grilled cheese!
When we were kids (before the advent of the microwave), we'd toast the bread, add cheese and then wrap in foil.  Then place the packet on TOP of the toaster - "toast" for a minute - flip the packet and "toast" again..... voila - grilled cheese!

I disagree w/ the person who said this was disgusting! there have been times when my b/f's old stove didn't work, and I've made them this way.  They are great in the microwave and on the stove.

Ah, memories of university 20 years ago AND just last Saturday...I've been doing this for years, but I've simplified it even more by eliminating the microwave step altogether.  First I let the cheese slice warm up a bit on the counter, then I simply stand by the toaster with cheese in hand waiting for the bread to pop.  The moment that happens - BAM! - I put the cheese in between and press the whole thing down on the counter, letting the heat of the toast do the work. No need for the microwave.

This is definitely a kid friendly recipe.  My son loves grilled cheese and he's old enough now where he can start assembling them on his own.  Thanks Kaoru.

Like some other reviewers, I was not aware that there was an easier, more healthier way to make grilled cheese! I've been doing it on the stovetop for years. I don't think I will anymore. This recipe is a very good base-- I think I might try this with a slice of ham for a nice grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Thanks!

The sandwich was good. I used  wheat bread and cheddar cheese, and I added a slice of turkey bacon (which I cooked in the microwave while I sliced the cheddar cheese). It was good, but I missed that "fried" or grilled flavor that I get when I make the same sandwich on the stovetop. The bread just tasted like toast. I will make this again if I 'm feeling lazy and don't want to wash any pans.

This is how my youngest son has alwasy made his own grilled cheese since he wasn't allowed to use the stove. I was really surprised to find the recipe actually posted here. They aren't as good as a real grilled cheese but much less fat and a lot healthier! No pan to clean up either.

I have eaten these for years.  I teach at a school where we only have a toaster and microwave.  The cafeteria charges $1.75 for this....I just do it on my own.  Plus, younger brothers and sisters love doing this one their own.  Thanks for posting.

I think it is ideal for kids who can't be trusted to work a stove, not a teen, bachelor, or adult. It would be ideal for a college student I suppose, but that would be about it. It is kind of on the same level as adding water to a Kool Aid packet. Sure, you stirred, but that doesn't really make it a recipe.

Overall, you can make much better on a stove in almost the same amount of time.

I've been making this grilled cheese since I was in high school.  Over the years when I had no time or for a quick meal I've modified it some what.  I use one slice American Cheese with a slice of sugar baked ham and a slice of Montrey Jack cheese between two toasted slices of bread.  Then microwave, Great Taste.  The cheese melts around the toast and the ham into one comforting blend.  It's a great sandwich at the office when you don't have a oven.

Wow,I thought I invented this! What a crack-up. I started making these when my son was only a toddler and everyday he would want grilled cheese. I got so tired of dealing with cooking them and then cleaning the pan, I took this short cut way and he still devoured them. A great short cut and great for kids who can't use the stove and for dorm life.

Idiot-proof! The bread was slightly damp from the microwave, but still crispy. I will be making this again as a quick snack.

I make this using a toaster oven all the time. I agree it's great when you don't have a pan for whatever reason, or if you just don't want to wash the pan after. But with a toaster oven I partly toast the bread, then put the cheese on to melt. I also use lots of variations of cheese and bread: rye and pepper jack, 15 grain and provolone (sometimes with chipolte sprinkled on the cheese), or honey wheat with cheddar.

Toaster Ovens are even better - if you have one, combine the steps by putting the bread in the toaster oven with cheese on each slice.  Toast, and as soon as it dings, put the slices together.  Melty and yummy without the rubbery-ness that the microwave can impart.

Instead of white bread, I used a plain bagel to which I applied just a little butter.  It was good, but I kind of missed the "grilled" touch.  It was more like a warm cheese sandwich.  Oh well!

Great idea...but if you find yourself with no stove, microwave, or toaster you can butter 2 slices of bread, put cheese in the middle then wrap in tin foil and lay a hot iron on both sides. Works great and makes a flat but "normal" tasting grilled cheese.

Every now and again, I stumble across a recipe that leaves me scratching my head wondering why on earth I never thought of it myself... I consider myself a pretty decent cook, but I cannot make a grilled cheese without burning at least one side of the sandwich. Thank you SO much, Kaoru! I'll never make them in a skillet again! (PS, I just made the following discovery - Put 3 or 4 rashers of 'Bill's Fried Bacon' from this site between the cheese slices. Holy cow! Delicious!!)

I had to laugh, and post a review, when I came upon this recipe! After a few cooking fiasco's as a child, this was the only way that my Mom would let me make a grilled cheese for a couple of years! Personally, I love either the stovetop or broiler (can you say butter?!). Thanks for the post :-)

I have a sacrifice toaster that I use to cook in. Reheating buttered toast with cheese in the middle, reheating grilled hamburgers or sausage. It is a great upright element for cooking higher fat foods where the fat can drip off.  keep a metal pan under it. I also use my toaster oven to make these.  

Tip for the microwave. Learn to use the power levels. For cheese, keep the power low to prevent problems (separation,congealing) and even heating. set at 30% and start with 20 seconds, you can adjust up from there till you find the overdo point.

I admit I have done this too!!! One it is a little healthier form of a grilled cheese since you don't have to butter your bread... and two it is easier and gets less dishes dirty, great for a college dorm.... honestly it doesn't taste half bad either.... thanks for sharing the idea!!

I only gave it a five star because it is something I would have done. But I did find something a bit more easier, butter the outside like a normal grill cheese, heat up a waffle iron put the butter side down add cheese, then top with the next butter side up and close. ^.^ you get a waffle print.

TOASTED CHEESE - This is what my mom use to make us cause she couldn't cook. But she used Medium Cheddar instead of American and she called it Toasted Cheese since that's what it is.

I used to make this when I was a kid, it's a good way to make a yummy hot sandwich without using the stove :D
Whoever rated it 1 is being picky! 
Clearly this isn't meant to be a gourmet sandwich!

This is a super-fast meal when you're in a hurry. It's even better if you have a slice or two of ham to throw on it. No butter means a healthier sandwich too!

Hey, not everyone is a chef. I actually got into a kick of using my waffle iron for more than just waffles, and one of my favourites is grilled cheese (or other sandwiches) in the waffle iron. just assemble your sandwich, spray pam on the two outsides, and pop in the waffle iron for a few minutes until it's nice and golden. the grid pattern is fun, makes it easy to cut into strips for kids, and practically no cleanup (unless some cheese oozed onto the grill).

A dorm room classic.  This is the best way to make grilled cheese sandwiches when you have no stove (or are too lazy to do dishes later).

Unreal! I cant believe this actually exists! I used to make this when I was a kid just because it was easier and less to clean up. I didnt actually think others actually did this!  I hate using the microwave though so instead I used to hold the cheese above the toaster to get it warm enough that it would melt instantly when it hit the bread. I still think it taste better than a pan grilled cheese and is a little better for you. Havent done this in about 8 years now... memories.

This is a lot like a grilled cheese I made in the dorms.  The exception is I just put the toaster on its side with the cheese on the bottom piece of bread.  Place the plate a good foot from the front of the toaster and a "perfect" grilled cheese shoots out onto it.  Nice upgrade though!

Lol. My sister used to make this when we were little. I always found it a little dry but to fix that problem you just have to butter the toast before you microwave it.

When my children were younger and wanted to "cook" for themselves this was one of the first things they learned how to make. After toasting the bread throw on some tuna fish or a few slices of your favorite meat and tada it an even heartier sammy. Not to mention it allows the kiddies to eplore in the kitchen. Even now that my youngest is 11 they all still make this.

I remember doing this as a kid after school. To give it a more authentic flavor, spread a little butter on the "inside" of one slice of toast before you add cheese & microwave. As an adult I'm aware this is better for me--as a kid I was just proud to be able to "cook" grilled cheese sandwiches for my mom on soup nights :-)

I've known about this trick since my college days.  Two pieces of cheese always seemed too cheesy to me - we only used 1.  In our day, we called it "ghetto grilled cheese" and it worked great.

I would always make these when I'd want a quick grilled cheese but was too lazy to use the stove. My boyfriend laughs at this "cooking method." It is, of course, not as great as the real thing, but for a quick, easy snack, this does the trick.

This is the only way I like a "grilled cheese" sandwich.  I've made them this way for years - using different kinds of cheeses (favorite is Muenster).  It's less "greasy" than when you butter the bread and put in skillet.

I am a lazy person. therefore, I never "have time" to take out a pan or whatever, butter, heat for a few mins then flip it over, eugh. too much work and time for something that can be eaten in maybe a minute or two, so why not just take a minute or two to make it? this simple recipe can LOOK bad, but it's all the same when you compare the taste with a grilled cheese you wasted time on.

nothing wrong with this. Growing up the only grilled cheese sandwiches i knew about were done in the oven. Its only recently I met a friend from Canada and found out it was done on the stove with tons of butter over there.....very unhealthy as far as I'm concerned.

My husband, who makes a wonderful grilled cheese sandwich the traditional way, absolutely can not STAND that I make and enjoy making this quick treat this way. I've been doing this for years! Yes, you could make it on the stove in about as much time, but why? ^_^ This way is so much fun and you can eat off the dish you use to make the sandwich. It could even be a paper plate--no clean up! Sweet!  I toast the bread, butter both pieces liberally and nuke it!

I remember my mom showing me how to make these when I was about 4 years old... it's what got me interested in cooking as a kid!  We would toast the bread, and then butter the insides before adding the cheese. Assemble (dry side out), cover with a paper towel, and then microwave for 30 seconds to melt the butter and the cheese.   My freshman year of college, my roommates and I held some great girls' night dinner parties in our dorm room: snuck-in bottles of wine and "grown-up" versions of these with turkey/gruyere/cranberry, ham/apple/brie, etc... they were a big success among the "we have no stove to cook with" set ;)

My husband calls this a "Grilly Cheese". Every once in a while we will make grilled cheese like this if we are in a hurry or really don't want to cook anything.  No, its not great but it doesn't taste bad either. I suggest buttering the outside of the bread after toasting.

Also, use 2-3 slices of cheese for an extreme cheese flavor that looks like it came from a cheese commercial.

This is a perfect quick sandwich to make in the morning to send for the kids lunch. I started making them this way to cut fat. Have never had any complaints from the kids.

I've been doing this almost my entire life but didn't realize it was a recipe. I highly recommend it and applaud the PMS Princess for posting it. The only thing easier is to simply toast the breads, slap a slice of cheese between them and EAT! The cheese melts well enough without microwaving but if you want the cheese gooey, go ahead and nuke it.   I think I'm going to go make one of these now.

I've been making these for years.  After college and work, I didn't feel like washing any more dishes.  I Have toasted the bread and as soon as it pops, I put the cheese on it and let it set on top of the toaster.  When I was really in a hurry, I just put it in the microwave.  Make sure you don't leave it in there too long, the toast gets soft very quick. Enjoy!

I do this all the time, although I don't wrap in a towel and put in the microwave.  I just toast the bread and cheese together (like an open faced sandwich, then put together the bread), usually with tomatoes since I like my grilled cheese that way.  Yes, it lacks that butter taste but half the time it makes my tummy uneasy and I always eat grilled cheese with ketchup anyway!

This is exactly how I've been making my grilled cheese sandwiches for years.  I hate reagular grilled cheese because they are slathered in butter and way too greasy.  This is so easy and it takes 1/3 of the time of normal grilled cheese!

I've been making grilled cheese this way for years. I stopped calling the "grilled" though, after much bickering with the hubby. We call them "nuclear cheese" now, and the kiddo loves it.

I had to laugh at the disgust.  I have always eaten it this way..I don't like the added fat butter gives it. I do put a slice of cheese on each side of bread and throw in micro for a few secs..then take out, add reduced fat mayo and slice of tomato...Wonderful!

I've done this before but before you place into the microwave, spread mayonaise on inside of bread, add sliced ham or roasted turkey with a few sliced green olives. Microwave till cheese is melted.  Good sammy.

I did this as a child. It's the easiest way to make grilled cheese without having to use a stove. Glad to know I'm not alone in this method!

Since the bread is toasted and wrapped in a paper towel, it doesn't get that "rubbery" consistency that microwaved bread usually has.
Thanks for posting this recipe.  If you have a recipe for a quick and easy peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I'm all ears!

Great idea! I made this for the kids I baby-sit for as an after school snack and they LOVED it! Thanks!
