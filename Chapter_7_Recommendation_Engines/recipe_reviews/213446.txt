I am giving only 4 stars because although these taste wonderful the resulting dessert is not like Boston Cream Pie. They are more of a vanilla flavored cheese cake with chocolate topping. I followed the recipe to the tee, so it is not that I altered it in any way. I was just disappointed that they were not what I'd expected, as I love Boston Cream Pie.  Boston Cream Pie does not contain any cream cheese, which should have given me a huge clue that these would not taste like it. One of the reviewers posted that these do taste like Boston Cream Pie so I took a chance. I will make these again, as they are easy to make and do have a great flavor, especially if you are a cheese cake fan, which I am. These would make a great addition to a buffet or appetizer type meal since they are individual servings, easy to handle and eat. But I do think the name of the recipe should be changed to a more appropriate one.

I have a diabetic husband and to  reduce sugar and fat use fat free cream cheese and sour cream and use sugar free pudding. Pillsbury also makes a reduced sugar frosting. This is my recipe that made it as a finalist in Betty Crockers Mix It Up With Betty Cookie Contest.   They are very yummy and don't last long in my house!

Made this for Superbowl party and everyone loved them.  Did get a hint to use graham cracker for the bottom instead of sugar cookies.  But a great simple recipe!

Although I didn't think it tasted like Boston Cream Pie, it was delicious!  My family loved it!  Once mine cooled, it did sink in the middle...any ideas as to what I did wrong??   J.B.

These were good and pretty cute.  I removed the cupcake wrapper before serving.  I used fat free cream cheese and sour cream and they were still very rich.  The only thing I may change next time is using something different in place of the canned frosting like maybe a ganache or something.  Not only do I think it would improve the taste, my frosting kind of got runny after sitting in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these today for Super Bowl party tomorrow, easy to make , and very tasty.  Of course I won;\'t have the 24 cakes to take with me, because grandchildren and son in law sampled.  They past the test. As good as my own Boston Cream Pie that I make.

Make sure you get the full-sized paper holders. I got mini ones, and it grew too big.

I followed the recipe as written and found it easy to make and very tasty.  I agree with other reviews who question the Boston Cream title but itâ€™s easy to make and taste great.

Do not taste like Boston cream pie, but it's a pretty good cupcake
