Excellent tartar sauce! I used Hellmen's light mayo and relish vs. chopping pickles.  I love the capers in this! This was perfect for beer battered fish!

I made this tartar sauce minus the capers (I didn't have them on hand and forgot to pick them up at the store) and served it with boiled halibut.  My dinner party loved the tartar sauce!  Even a non-tartar-sauce person loved it!  It had a nice tangy and slightly sweet taste, from the lemon and bread and butter pickles, and I think the tarragon just rounds it out so nicely.  It made the dinner, I think! I made the recipe as 22 servings, but it served my party of 8 with maybe 2 servings left.  Like I said, they loved it. If I ever have the capers I'll have to try it that way, too.   Thank you for the tasty sauce recipe!

******* WOW, give me a bigger spoon!! This is SOOO good you don't need any seafood. Since I made this I try to think of something "else" to prepare just so I  can have more tartar sauce!

I found this recipe to be good...I feel if I left out the tarragon it would have been better.

Ok, first I have to say I am NOT a tartar sauce person.  I've gone my entire life (all 51 years) never liking it.... Until we went tpo a ling o ttle whole-in-the-wall restaurant that had homemade tartar sauce with tarragon-- I flipped. It was really good.  So, trying to recreate it, I found this recipe.  I did do some tweaking-- had fresh tarragon, and some extra left over basil and tyme leaves from a marinade I was doing... Used sweet gherkins, and capers, but then ran everything through a food processor before whisking it into a mix of 1/2 cup mayonaise and 1/2 cup of lite sour cream (El Esposo is trying to lose some weight). ERMAGAWD.  This is good stuff, folks!  (I think I may try to sneak some plain yogurt in there next time!)  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS!!!

Excellent recipe. I used substituted sweet relish though and added some salt and pepper. For the egg I used a an old pasta strainer I  was throwing away anyway.
Very easy to take this recipe and create different tastes. No tarragon? Try dill. No Parsley? Try Oregano 
Will be making this in a variety of ways many more times!

Edit: After finally getting tarragon to make this the right way I've concluded I prefer it without the tarragon. Dill and oregano are better. Other reviews as far back as 2012 agree. Tarragon does not belong.

Great flavour but too salty for me.,  even though I replaced half the mayo with plain yogurt. Next time will half the capers as I think they made it too salty. 
I hesitated to put the egg in but very glad I did. It adds a great texture and flavour 
A half recipe make slots.  Too much for 2 people.

I made this for basic heat up fish sticks in order to use up some tarragon I had handy, and it was perfect. I love that the extra flavor helped amp up an otherwise boring meal without adding too much additional effort.

This was so good, my hubby was eating it with a spoon! The tarragon adds a nice, delicate flavor to this condiment. Easy to make too!

My husband, who has loved tarter sauce since birth I think 1950) LOVES this recipe. I haven't remembered to buy Capers yet, but I will. I am told they enhance many recipes and I am very much into different tastes these days. At any rate, this is a WINNER, WINNER.

My entire family loves this tartar sauce (and I consider myself a connoisseur of tartar sauce i love it so much - ha!).  I want to use this on fish tacos too.  I may substitute cilantro for tarragon when I do use it for fish.  I love the tarragon, capers and eggs in it for a standard sauce.  My family insists that this become our standard tartar sauce now.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  It's fabulous!
