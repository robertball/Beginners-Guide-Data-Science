My husband and I loved this dish!  I didn't have a flank steak, so I used a flat iron steak and I pan-fried it first and then cut it in strips.  I wanted it rare, and I was afraid that the strips would over-cook. The instructions read: "simmer until the sauce thickens".  There really wasn't any sauce to speak of from one can of tomatoes, so I added some V8 juice to create some.  I increased the amount of paprika too:  2 tsp sweet-and-smoky, and 1 tsp of hot paprika. But that's just personal preference.  This dish was scumptious.  DH had two helpings at dinner and then ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning.  A real keeper.  Thanks, Jayda!

I thoroughly enjoyed the gnocchi (never had it before); however I found the recipe as followed to be a bit bland. I added a bit of butter to the olive oil for the saute and added some Merlot to make more sauce. I will make it again, but I will definitely "BAM" it with more spice.

No doubt this needs salt ‘n pepper, but sometimes it is possible to rush things and this is one of those times.  The quick cooking process doesn’t allow the flavors time to come together so the end result is very bland.  I tossed everything back in the skillet (minus the gnocchi), added a little water and let it simmer with a covered lid for about an hour.  The added cooking time really enhanced the flavor making it more like a pepper steak and the meat was nice and tender.   If I were doing it over, I would start by browning the meat, add all of the ingredients except the gnocchi and simmer in a covered pot for at least an hour.

Great tasting dish.  I followed the recipe but substituted or omitted a few things using what I had on hand.  It turned out great and can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

The recipe IS a little bland. I doctored it with salt, pepper, basil, tobasco and Cabernet.  Turned out amazing!  Great base recipe and very easy to build upon.  Also might be better over rice!

Gnocchi is such a bland pasta, I was looking for a good recipe to help liven the taste. This dish did not do that. It wasn't terrible, I'm just realizing gnocchi isn't the easiest or tastiest pasta to work with. Though, this recipe would probably work great with tortellini

My family decided how many stars to give, and they really liked this one.  It had a very interesting taste using the paprika. Will make again...

A good use of the smoked paprika languishing in my cupboard--and as easy as any stir-fry! I added some kosher salt, bumped up the garlic, and used freshly made potato gnocchi instead of store-bought. Tip: Stick the whole flank steak in the freezer for 10 minutes or so while you chop the veggies. It's easier to slice thinly when it's nearly frozen.

This was my first time making gnocchi, but I don't like the kind with pesto, so I was happy to find this recipe. 
It was so good I was literally licking my fingers! ( and also, my fingers somehow got into it)
However I did substitute a small pot roast which I cut into slices instead of the steak, because I literally ruin every steak I make. 
It worked though!
Easy weeknight recipe

This dish was very bland. Others did warn about that and I should have taken thier advice. The steak needs to be seasoned prior to cooking it. Will not be making again.

I used green peppers instead of red and yellow because they were way too expensive, but it still turned out great. I won't make this with gnocchi again, it was just too plain... I'll probably try what another reviewer suggested and use egg noddles instead. Other than the tasteless gnocchi, this recipe was really good.

I have made this several times. It's very good and easy to make. Serve by itself or on rice (especially if you forget or can't find gnocchi).

The only thing this is missing to make it amazing is some seasoning. Paprika is not enough. At the very least, it needs s&p, and I added some dried thyme. The results were plate-licking good though!

I found this dish ok, but I didn't love it and probably won't make it again.  There was no wow factor, and I'm not great at cooking steak, so mine came out a bit chewy.

Made this following the directions, using frozen gnocchi. The gnocchi were big, pasty and bland, paired with the rest of the dish. If we make this again, we'll serve it over rice.
