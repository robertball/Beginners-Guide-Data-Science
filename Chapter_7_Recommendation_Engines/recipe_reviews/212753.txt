Fabulous! I used about 1/8 teas of ground black pepper, because that's what I had. My Trader Joes chopped pecans were too big and almond meal was too powdery but worked; next time I'll chop almonds or pecans to an intermediary texture. Wet your hands a bit to form the balls. This recipe is a keeper. Yum!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make, yet quite classy. I tried them with basil and thyme, and GREATLY preferred the thyme. Just be aware that this can be quite messy - you'll end up with goat cheese all over your hands and spoon!

These were great.  I used fresh herbs (sage, oregano, basil) on half and nuts on the other half. Easy to make and turned out very impressive.   Thanks for the recipe.
