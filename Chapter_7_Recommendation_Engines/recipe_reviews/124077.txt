This recipe was DELICOUS!  I had to modify it ever so slightly - I was out of lemon zest, so I used orange - but it had a wonderful texture and was really light, not doughy.  The cream cheese filling was so smooth, a perfect compliment to the texture of the bread.

One thing to note:  the recipe says 30 min. prep time and 40 minute cook time.  It took me much longer than that.  I'm thinking they're just talking about the dough rising, but altogether, I'd say it took me well over 2 hours to make these.  They're worth it though!!

Wonderful recipe.  The prep time wasn't too long, and the kolaches weren't doughy.  Instead of the filling in the recipe, I bought a can of lemon pie filling and it worked GREAT!  This is a recipe I will keep.

These were very easy to make and they are delicious. I did add a little more lemon zest to the recipe. These are great little pastries. I shaped half of the batch into hearts.They are not overly sweet either,they are just right.The cream cheese mixture is yummy too!Thanks for sharing!

I really like the dough part of this recipe. I could have added a little more sugar to though. I filled mine with the lemon filling from this recipe as well as with blueberry jam and thick strawberry pie filling and a vanilla cream filling. The strawberry was the prettiest, but I think they all tasted good. I hope to make them again.

These were very good! It was a nice not too sweet option instead of a danish for breakfast. I really enjoyed the light lemon flavor- I added extra lemon zest to the filling mixture. I also liked how light and fluffy the texture of the bread was. I will make these again!

I just took my last tray out of the oven. These are wonderful, light texture and the cream cheese filling is so creamy. I did not make mine lemon, didn't hame any fresh lemons. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the dough and one to the cream cheese. But I will try them with lemon next time. I'm sure they will become a family favorite, if not I will make them for ME.. Bet they would be really good with cherry pie filling. I also mixed powdered sugar, butter and half and half and drizzled it on top of them to add a touch of sweet. And I did the dough in my bread machine, worked wonderful. Took longer than the time said, but well worth the effort. You wont be dissapointed.

Absolutely awesome recipe! Better than I could buy down the street at the Kolache Factory. I have used several different fillings now, and all of them turn out well... Thanks!

Not bad, found them to be a bit bland but the cream cheese filling was good.  Over all, not really worth the effort.

I loved these.  My husband said they were better than what my grandma used to make.  The next time I will make them into 48 so that they are smaller.  I used apricot preserves instead of the cream cheese on some.   I didn't use any lemon based on personal choice
