Very very good - I made 2 and 2/3 batch (because that's how many chips I had) and used all butter, 1 stick margarine. was nervous as I've not had a lot of luck with shortbread BUT this dough was awesome to work with. We ended up though creating 4 times the number of cookies called for - if we had made it according to the directions the cookie logs would have been way too big. The end result was thumb-sized cookies. Because  there were so many more cookies I was worried we didn't have enough of the melted chocolate so instead of dipping, just put the melted chocolate in a bag, snipped the end and drizzled. Much faster, same taste. I'm actually glad we didn't dip - might have been too chocolatey. Also, next time might use just a bit fewer chips in the dough - there are a LOT. But overall, delicious, easy and will probably be one of my Christmas standards from now on.

Made for Recipe Group. Loved how easy to make they are. I made all sorts of different shapes. They do spread a bit and had a few that touched when done. I didn't use all the chips in the batter and melted the chocolate and drizzled stripes over with a ziploc. Look very nice and will go on the holiday cookie tray!

We followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT we made the cookies much smaller.  We ended up with 96 thumb-sized logs that we then drizzled the chocolate over rather than dipping them (since we had so many more to cover, we wouldn't have had enough chocolate to dip them.) The dough was very easy to work with and drizzling the chocolate was so much faster than dipping.  WAY YUMMY cookies!  I will definitely make these again. although I might try lessening the amount of chocolate chips in the dough as there are a TON of chocolate chips and I love shortbread.

Delicious shortbread cookie recipe with standard measurements being used for the butter, flour and sugar. After measuring the chocolate chips and based on other reviews I knew it would have been too much for my taste so I cut the chocolate chips back to 1 cup and ran them through the food processor briefly to chop them finer. Instead of making logs I pressed the dough out to about 1/2 - 3/4" thickness on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and baked till the edges started turning golden (about 20 minutes) since I was not making logs. I let the cookie slab cool, broke it apart and drizzled the pieces with chocolate. Good recipe patticake, one I will make again  (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*).

I made this recipe without changes to take to a party where the only two people I knew were close friends of my significant other's ex-wife.   Through clenched teeth, they told me that these cookies were delicious.
   I can't imagine where you could possibly get a better, more honest review.  Clearly, these cookies are excellent.

Made these for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! I made 1/2 batch (just to try), and got 22 cookies. These were so simple, it's hard to believe that they turned out this good. Instead of dipping the, I drizzled them w/ the chocolate for a prettier appearance. These are definitely going on the Christmas cookie baking list~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Crunchy, buttery and loaded with chocolate goodness - what else is there to say besides DELICIOUS? I used my small cookie scoop (1 Tablespoon) to form balls and then just made  into logs. I dipped the shortbread cookie into the melted chocolate chips and used a toothpick to make little downward, pointed designs. Just found a new recipe that will be a perfect addition to any cookie tray!  Made for the Buzz Recipe Group and I thank you patticake for sharing your 5 star recipe.

These are  amazing! We ran out of vanilla but they're still so so good. I found that if I gave them time to cool then gently gripped the ends of the cookie with my thumb and middle finger I was able to role them in chocolate quite easily.

This cookies are perfect dunkers. I enjoy eating them in the morning with coffee. I would suggest adding less chocolate chips to the base, but that's just me.

These were easy and delicious. I will make them again. I didn't like the way they looked rolled into logs (I couldn't get them to look like the ones in the pictures and I don't know why), so ended up rolling them out and cutting into rectangles.They ended up having a really nice presentation. I drizzled the chocolate instead of dipping.

This is a very tasty shortbread cookie that could not have been any easier to make.  I followed the recipe except to make the cookies about half the size indicated.  I yielded about 48 cookies and the beauty of this recipe is you can put them all on one cookie sheet and bake them all at once, since they dont rise.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, patticake.  We absolutely love them!

These cookies looked so cute on the photo I decided to make them. I bake all the time - and it is NOT possible without adding some milk to be able to shape logs or anything else out of this dough-as it is too dry to hold together. 
 The reviews I read with 5*, nobody mentioned that it was impossible to shape - so anyone who is making this recipe please be aware that the recipe as is  will make a dry dough. 
 I, nor my family was impressed by this recipe+taste, sorry to say...it is just Ok and will NOT make it again.

Delicious! I didn’t have mini chocolate chips, so I used regular. I also added some crushed pecans to half the batch. Great recipe!

Love this recipe! I made the dough and rolled into logs. I dipped the cookies in the melted chocolate chips then dipped into sprinkles or chopped nuts or coconut - they look very pretty and taste great! Everyone can’t believe they’re not from a bakery!

A tad dry — needed a drink immediately. I did as told, just added some choc covered raisins as well. Dipped in choc and some ground walnuts. Hoping they taste a bit better after complete cooling. As a nice option , this recipe also can be made with ground walnuts or pecans instead of choc chips, and then rolled into balls or crescent shapes. Once cool , roll in powdered sugar. They are mouth watering good.

These cookies turned out perfect. I dipped some and drizzled over some. I think I'll include chopped nuts either in the dough or over the dipped chocolate. This made a lot more than listed.  I had left one batch in a bit longer and thought they were burnt, but just made them a  bit crunchier.

Delicious and easy to make.  We used 6 ounces chocolate chips in the cookies and did not dip the cookies in any chocolate.  Our family loves these!

I almost threw these in the garbage when I made them. They came out of the oven, cooled, and I drizzled chocolate over them. 20 minutes later, I took a bite of one and almost immediately tossed the lot. It was just...bad. But I held off on tossing them out, mainly cause I couldn't bare to waste them. I'm so glad I did. On Day 2 they were better, almost even decent. By Day 5 they were the best shortbread cookies I've ever had. I will definitely be making them again, and I urge everyone to let them age a little before judging.

Love these cookies!  my step daughter made them for school, everyone loved them!  we decided to roll the ends in chocolate and put coconut on some and red sugar on the rest.   very yummy!
