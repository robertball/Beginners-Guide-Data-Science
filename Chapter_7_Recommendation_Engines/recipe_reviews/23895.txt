excellent!  I don't own a bread machine, so I made the dough in my trusty kitchen-aid mixer.

It didn't take as long to rise as the recipe called for.  I did a normal 1-hour first rising, punched it down and let it rise for another half hour, then shaped it and let it rise in the pan for only about 1/2 hour.  

Will make this one again.

I am actually writing this review hoping to get some tips from others. This recipe had a great dough texture (I like my sticky buns to be realy yeasty and soft not like bread) and the flavor was very good, but I ran into the problem I always do when I make cinnamon pecan sticky bun type stuff. Too Dry! not enough of the sticky stuff. So should I just triple the sauce recipe or something to make it more gooey?
Other than that nice recipe, easy but time consuming.
Thanks.

Update Dec. 5 2006:

This is a great dough recipe but I use the caramel recipe on "Cinnamon Rolls I" posted on this site. I double the caramel recipe and use pecans rather than walnuts. Great!

My rolls turned out very dry and heavy instead of gooey and light.  I took the advice from below and used the caramel sauce (doubled) from Cinnamon Rolls I and it was good.  I also used the cream cheese frosting from Cinnamon Rolls II and it was awesome!  Double the cinnamon and brown sugar that goes between the rolls too because there wasn't enough.  I'll make these again to try to get them softer but was disappointed.

Super rolls!  The rolls were soft, with a nice texture to compliment the gooey, sweet, cinnamony filling.  The only changes I made were substituting white sugar + molasses for brown sugar which isn't available and almost doubling it.  I also added more walnuts (especially in the mixture which is added to the baking pan).  Highly recommend this recipe and it will very quickly become a standard in my house!

My first try at sticky buns....thank you for the recipe! I made the dough in my Kitchen Aid.  Hubby and son loved them!  They looked like something from a bakery.  I do not like cinnamon, but Hubby took them to work and everyone wanted more.

I know I'm alone here, but I really didn't like this recipe all that much at all. I like my cinnamon rolls to be creamy and fluffy. These are really dense and the carmel is really... well, caramelly. I like the typical gooey frosting much better than carmel. I just found it too thick and dense and not much all that moist.

Really nice taste, and texture. I used regular All-purpose white flour, plus 3 tsp of baking powder instead of using the bread flour (didn't have any).  Turned out fabulous.  If you're not a big fan of nuts, I would recommend skipping the 1 cup of chopped nuts that go on the outside...  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I've never made cinnamon rolls before or any other pastry for that matter. I chose this recipie because it uses a bread machine and I'm a man and not into hand wrestling dough.  I followed the recipe exactly and these things turned out very pretty looking like something out of a fancy bakery.  Prettier than the recipie photo! They were sweet due to all the sugar but delicious!   I was worried that the sauce/nut mixture would all stick to the pan when flipped but that didn't happen.  It all came out on top of the rolls for a very fancy appearance.  The only change I would consider if doing this again is to maybe cut back on the brown sugar a skosh and add more cinnamon.  Other than that these were very best.  Thanks for the experience, Marylyn!

These were absolutely delicious!  I added canned milk instead of regular milk and 2 extra Tbsp of it.  I also only baked the rolls for 15 minutes.  Anything more and the rolls would have been dry.  Just like any other recipe I kept an eye on them and when they were to my liking I took them out of the oven.  My husband said they were the best cinnamon rolls that he had ever tasted.  I agree!!

I have gotten on a "yeast" kick lately and decided to make these rolls to take to work.  Boy, did they go fast and everyone wanted the recipe.  I thinned out some powdered sugar with a little milk and the zest of one orange.  Drizzled over the tops of the warm rolls.  I did double the filling as I wanted to have a stronger cinnamon-sugar taste. I could've eaten the whole pan--they're that good! I

I really liked these cinnamon rolls.   I don't know if it's my breadmachine or not, but the dough cycle took over an hour, so for me, the entire process was closer to two hours.  I liked the caramel on the bottom of the rolls, and I added an icing to the top when they were hot.  I also added a lot more cinnamon than the recipe called for, even adding some to the caramel in the bottom of the pan. I like cinnamon :)

These were delicious!  On the first day, I thought they were missing a type of icing in addition to the caramel sauce, but the next day, reheated, they rocked!!  I thought they were even better the 2nd and 3rd day!  They didn't last past the 3rd day.  (because we ate them all, not because they were bad)  To reheat them, I just threw them into the microwave for like 15 to 20 seconds and mmmmmmm  cinnamon rolls!!!

These are time consuming, but well worth the effort for a special occassion.  They will be our new cinnamon roll for Christmas morning from here on out.

These are pretty good. I served them for breakfast at my bed and breakfast this morning. The guests gave rave reviews. Not everyone likes raisins, so I put craisins in half of them. I let raise in the sunroom, and did the kneading by hand. I wasn't sure how to make them and freeze them and use a carmel sauce, so I made the dough, sliced it and froze on a cookie sheet. I baked two yesterday and used a frosting, instead.

This was very good and I cheated. I used a tube of pizza dough! I would only recommend that for a quick cinnamon roll fix but it worked. The filling and sauce were excellent. Next time I will use two tubes if I am too lazy to make the dough again. :) There was plenty of sauce for two, plus the dough does not grow like this recipe dough does.

These are the best cinnmaon rolls I have ever tasted.  They disappear very quickly!  I don't care for the caramel sauce, so I just bake them in a pan, and 15 minutes after removing them, I drizzle on a thick powdered sugar glaze.

These are absolutely the best I have ever eaten.
I made one change because I'm from maple country.
I used REAL maple syrup instead of brown sugar in
the bottom of the pan only. Wonderful!!

This recipe was great! I ended up using macadamia nuts crushed up because that's all I had on hand, and it was delicious! I also cut back the total amount of nuts called for to about 3/4 of a cup. I would recommend letting these cool for a few minutes before eating to set up, we ate them still hot from the oven and while they were delish that way...they were even better once they had cooled a bit and the "goo" had set up better. Overall this was a GREAT recipe!!

I am giving 5 stars to the caramel sauce, I would double the recipe for extra sauce.  It can be used with an cinnamon bun recipe.  I didn't add walnuts but it would be just as good with them.

These are excellent. I thought the amount of sauce was perfect; just enough to thinly cover the bottom of a 9X13 baking dish. When you cook them the sauce bubbles up and bottom 1/3 of every roll is glazed up the side. Based on personal preference i reduced the sugar sprinkled on top and then rolled into the bread to 1/4 cup, reduced the raisins to 1/4 cup, and did not add nuts to the inside. This resulted in a perfectly balanced bread that was complemented by the much sweeter toping.

I absolutely adored this recipe. I didn't have bread flour, so I couldn't use my bread maker, but I did use regular flour and did the dough by hand. The result was exquisite. Everyone in the family loved it. I'm definitely going to make this recipe more than once! Thanks for sharing!

I didn't like how the yeast acted in the milk.  Maybe mine wasn't warm enough.  I think this recipe would be fine using warm water, a pinch or two of sugar and yeast.  All of my other recipes call for an entire package of yeast and I think that may have had something to do with it too.  A package of yeast is 2 1/4 tsp according to my jar.  I think a full package of yeast would make better rolls.  They still tasted delicious.  We omitted the raisins, however.

Good recipe even without a machine. I did melt 1/4 cup extra butter to brush the tops after placing them into the pan for the second doubling. These were perfectly textured and moist, a satisfying and well received treat with the bunch at my house. As with any new batch of yeast, it must be proofed before using. Thanks!

I wanted a more traditional cinnamon role with white icing/glaze.  I used the bread machine for the rolls.  They were easy and the rolls turned out soft and gooey.  I just used a simple powdered sugar and milk mixture for a thin glazed.  I've learned from past experience to take cinnamon rolls out before they start to really brown on top.  Otherwise they start to dry out.  They are better when still just a little bit gooey still.

These are very good.  I just used frozen wheat bread dough instead of making my own, using just one loaf of bread.  I kept the rest of the measurements the same and put it in a 11x7 glass dish.  So far this is my familys favorite cinnamon roll, I have made them a couple of times now.

While test kitchening the best recipe for cinnamon rolls, I made these for the 3rd or 4th time.  I have botched them in every conceivable way... I don't have a bread machine, just a dough hook so I used that... Nothing I ever do wrecks these cinnamon rolls, not even accidentally leaving out cinnamon or sugar.  Don't ask...still amazing.

Like almost everyone else, I threw out the recommendations for the filling and I just winged it, liberally sprinkling cinnamon, brown sugar and walnuts to my liking inside the rolls.  I mixed some with the remaining butter (I used one stick) and poured a dab over the top.  One time when I made these, I forgot to put in sugar (duh).  It was such a disappointment, husband made the cream cheese frosting from allrecipes and man it was GOOD.  I can't wait to make this for an occasion so other people can eat these yummy things.

I have even crammed them into a 9 by 9 pan and they are still amazing.

Amazing! I can't  bake! But somehow miracle of miracles this turned out! I used my kitchen-aid for the dough and mixed the yeast in with the milk and sugar first.. I tried it the other way and had pieces of yeast all over the dough. Ya like I said I can't bake... anyway so it was amazing everyone enjoyed it!

These are delicious! It's a lot less work than it sounds like and believe me, the work is definately worth it! I made these for a mini-family reunion and everyone loved them -- even my 7 month old daughter and she hates most table food! I will definately use this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing it! :)

I don't know what's the deal with other people saying this comes out dense and dry. Nonsense. The recipe is perfect, I didn't have to modify it at all and the rolls came out great. My husband and I loved them :)

These were wonderful! I make them all the time. Sometimes I double the sticky mix and under-bake them slightly so that they're extra gooey! My mother and I each had one when they we're still warm out of the oven and they were heavenly!

these rolls are awesome. our family has a number of food allergies, so i substitute a bunch of stuff, but even after using soy milk and spelt flour (and no sugar), they are still fabulous. I baked them in a glass pan and they took a little longer to cook - but otherwise everything worked as planned.

This was very nice, I will make it again! In order to increase the volume of the caramel sause I added another 2 tablespoons of Milk and about 5 tablespoons of lemon juice. The lemon juice really added to the flavour.

I have NEVER EVER EVER had cinamon rolls this good. I doubled the recipe not realizing how many this made. They lasted 3 days and omg they were still very moist and ewwy-gooey.  My stepson ate so many he couldn't eat dinner!

I found these to way too dry...almost like they were three days old. ( I didn't make the gooey topping because I wanted to frost them.)  Also didn't rise much too. They did have a good flavor but I'll not be making these again. Sorry

Today is my third time making this recipe. My whole family loves them! My coworkers are begging for them. I will make a batch for them eventually :-)  this recipe was my choice for my first try at making cinnamon rolls from scratch. We are not disappointed! Note: a cream cheese frosting makes these disappear faster! Delicious!  UPDATE!!! I've made these many times since and they are so easy to do with a bread machine!

Okay, I was  inspired by an All Recipe video to make this recipe and I have made it twice. The rolls turned out perfect but my Carmel sauce for the rolls is dry and crusty.  What am I doing wrong? I melted the butter and added the sugar and stirred until smooth the first time.  The second time I decided to try boiling the Carmel sauce to see of that is what I was missing. I really want to have success with this recipe given the fact so many people have rated it so well. Any suggestions?

I am so thrilled about this dough recipe!
I have tried to find a good one for years and finally found it! I did double it and used my own filling and toppings.
And did not use a bread machine, but good old fashion kneading and let it rise once for an hour, kneaded again, rise for 30 mins, then made the buns! They turned out huge,moist,light,and pulled apart so nicely!Thanks for sharing!

Yummy recipe. We don't ever add the topping as we don't have access to walnuts, but the rolls are sweet enough. We make them by hand as well and just let them rise in the pan, then transfer them to the fridge covered so that we can bake them fresh in the morning.  Just take them out about 20 minutes before you want to bake them and it works great. Like most cinnamon rolls, the leftovers are hard the next day but we slice them up for french toast-DELICIOUS!

I suck at making bread.  This recipe worked wonders in a bread machine.  Just make the dough and let it rise in the bread machine.  Then take it out and make the cinnamon rolls.

I liked these - trying to discover a recipe most like the ones I made when I was much younger. Close - not overly sweet and the brown sugar lends an interesting touch.  Would be nice if the recipe were broken down into groupings for which items were for the bread machine, the filling and the caramel.  It was a little confusing.

Great cinnamon roll.  I used this recipe with my mixer and churned out 72 delicious rolls in about 3 hours.  I used a cream cheese frosting on half of them.  I also passed on the nutty and raisins.  Great recipe for quick delicious cinnamon rolls.

First bath of rolls I ever made. Halved the ingredients and made a small batch of 8. I read the complaints about the sauce, but once it boils in the oven gets in the rolls very well and they are gooey and tasted great! Thanks!
