I used canned whole cranberries since fresh were not available. This turned out more dense than I expected, but I think it is due to my higher altitude. It kinda reminded me of a fruit cake in looks. I cut a piece from the cake to take to with me. I wasn't gone long enough to need a lunch. My husband met me at the door when I returned home. He took my piece of cake because he and the other 3 people in the house had eaten the rest of it in the 2 hours I was gone. The 1 bite I did get was good.

I loved this! I did double the orange zest and substituted 2/3 cup GF flour... (Next time I will try all GF flour) I loved the orange zest and fresh cranberry combination. Not too sweet. One note about coconut oil not having used it before. When making the glaze you will want to try to emulsify the oil with the sugar or it will look kind of gross. Dont worry it will still taste great!

I needed a vegan dessert for a pot luck dinner. My hostess threw in a kicker needing it to also be gluten-free. This recipe fit perfectly with the only needed modification being the use of Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour. I usually add applesauce to my  GF desserts and breads to keep them moist. It was already a part of this recipe adding coconut oil. The cake came out fabulously! The taste was great and it didn't have the gritty feel that can often accompany GF cakes and breads. I highly recommend this recipe!

I'm just asking a question here - If you wanted to substitute an egg for the flaxseeds, etc. can you do that and how?

Help, I made the Orange-cranberry cake.  Results:  It didn't "raise" all that much, it looked nice. it came out of the pan easily, it tasted very good and I would make it again.  However, it was so so heavy and dense, it was almost wet (although it was done). I would like to make it again but how do you make it a little lighter and fluffier?

Moist and rich, without eggs or butter, so even your vegan friends can enjoy it. What's not to love?
