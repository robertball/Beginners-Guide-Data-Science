I had to alter this based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I skipped the mushrooms, and used frozen broccoli florets - which I cooked by throwing in with the tortellini.  This was quick, delicious, and tasted like I spent MUCH more time than required to make dinner!  Husband said it's a definite keeper.

This recipe was just OK for us.  Easy YES, but it seemed like something was missing.  In think it would be good as soup...maybe
