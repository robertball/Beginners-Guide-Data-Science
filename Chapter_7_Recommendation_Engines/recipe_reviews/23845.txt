Wow!  I have been searching for sauce like my Mom made.  She past away in 1996, but I found her sauce with this recipe!  I tripled the recipe so I could freeze some for a later date.  The amount of spice is perfect, would not change one single thing!  Thank you for bringing my Mom back to me with this sauce!  Addition made to my review 11.08.09, why some reviewers make changes before trying the original recipe is beyond me..how can you review and rate a recipe that you have not tried?  Try the original recipe then review and rate it..give it a shot before you pass judgement, all recipes are to ones taste, if you do not like spicey sauce, than this one is not for you! You should not try this one and give it a bad review if you do not like spicy sauce .....it is SPICY sauce, anyone can see that from the ingredients.

WOW this was good!!!  I would give it 6 stars if I could. If your a lover of spicey things than this sauce will be your favorite of all time!!  I made this last night for dinner, it was incredible!  Here's the only things I changed up...I used 1 lb grass fed ground beef and 1 lb ground buffalo (great quality meat makes all the difference).  Sauted the onions and garlic in a non stick pan with no oil then added to fully cooked meat.  Instead of tomato paste I used 2 cans diced italian tomatoes, fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I was worried about adding the full 2 TBS red pepper flakes based on other reviewers adding 1 and saying that was more than enough so I added 1 1/2 TBS and it was great I think it would be delicious with the full 2 TBS but you do really have to like spicey which we do.  Added a shake of garlic powder along with the other spices and I let it simmer for over 2 hrs just because that makes it so flavorful and the meat so tender.  Served it on top of whole wheat spagetti with a side of whole wheat beer bread to sop up the sauce, PERFECT!  This would also make an awesome lasagna sauce or if you keep the recipe as is with the tomato paste it would be a great pizza sauce. If you love a little kick to your food I HIGHLY recommend trying this recipe!!!!!!  OOps almost forgot...I cut the salt by half.

I thought it was really good. I followed other people's suggestions on not adding salt and cutting back on spice. I added 1 can of beef broth to get a better consistancy. 
Also it didn't take me as long to make it as stated in the cooking time. It took me under an hour for sure.

I am trying really hard to cook out of my freezer/pantry for the next two weeks to save money. I did make a one substitution in this recipe to reflect that--I used half ground beef/half ground sausage as that was the meat I had in my deep freeze. I used brown sugar (the recipe did not specify which to use, I made a judgement call), I went light on the red pepper flake, I used fresh mushrooms and did not add the full amount of salt. I also added fresh ground black pepper. This simmered most of the afternoon and the liquid evaporated quickly. I did throw in one can (undrained) diced red tomatoes and a little red wine in an attempt to add more liquid which was just what it needed. Very good sauce--smells wonderful.

This is a definite 5 star recipe with the changes in the amount of salt and chili flakes that others have recommended.  I didn't have chili flakes (not sure what they are,actually), so I used a mixture of ancho chili powder and crushed red pepper. I actually didn't add any salt at all. I also added a can of beef broth to make it less thick.  I made it just spicy enough for my family and everyone loved it!  Great as leftovers too.

Very good with a few modifications. I do not brown the meat in oil, the meat has enough fat in it to brown. I added two cans of diced tomatoes, drained, omitted Worc. sauce, mushrooms and red pepper flakes. Added ground pepper, some garlic powder and a dash of parsley. I thought that 2 TBS of salt seemed way too much, I just sprinkled some on top, not measuring. Sugar is added toward the end of the simmer period. We remove the bay leaves prior to serving.

This is the best sauce I have ever had...AFTER a few modifications.  Other reviewers were right about too much salt and also it was VERY spicy!  I too, will cut the salt at least in half next time and will leave out the red pepper.  My 6 year old loved the flavor but after about 2 bites, couldn't eat anymore.  This is after I added lots of Splenda to tone down the heat and it did add a nice sweet flavor.  I also had to keep adding water because it was very thick.  I will make this again and again with these modifications.  Served over whole wheat rotini.

My family and I love this sauce.  I take a small amount out of the pot and transfer it to another pot before I add the red pepper flakes for my kids. I dont use as much salt as called for and I use onion powder to please the family. It is a huge hit, thanks for sharing.

I am glad that I read the reviews before I made this sauce. I did not add any salt, I cut way back on the chili powder (I didn't have flakes) and I add some balsamic. oh, and I also only used enough olive oil to lightly coat the pan before adding the onions...I would say I used, maybe, 1 TBS. The outcome was GREAT...even my husband liked it and he is VERY picky:)

Very good, easy to make sauce. It's thick enough that it really doesn't need to boil 2 hours. I had to add water it was so thick. I reduced meat to 1 lb and that was plenty and added chopped fresh red pepper. I used crushed red pepper as I couldn't find flakes. Used only 1t and it was plenty, more would have been too spicy.

SO GOOD!! Did not add as much salt or chili flakes as specified (simply based on taste preference) but the flavor was amazing. Better than what I've tried in restaurants. 

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.

Sooo delicious and easy too! The only thing I changed was I did not have red pepper flakes, so I used ground red pepper and only used one table spoon. It was VERY spicy, and I love spicy food. Make sure you taste it after adding pepper so it is not too hot.

This is the best meat sauce ever!  I did have to add two cans of beef broth, otherwise it was way too thick.  Just writing this review makes me want to make another batch right now!

Loved this simple sauce!  My husband said it was the best meat sauce he's ever had.  Pretty much followed recipe except for decreasing the amount of red pepper flakes to less than 1/2. (I have little ones, and worried that they could not handle the heat.) I also added 2 extra cans of tomato sauce. Really delicious and hearty.

The flavor of this is incredible. Not too tomatoey. My hubby thought it was too spicy, son and I loved it and didn't even notice the red pepper. I will make this again only next time cut back on the red pepper per hubby's request. Although I thought this was amazing just as it is. The only complaint though is the thickness....I had to add a cup or so of water as it was like paste and way too thick. I used 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned. Delicious recipe! I cooked mine for a full 5 hours for flavor. Highly recommended, makes a very meaty sauce. (p.s. I personally loved the red pepper and didn't find this too spicy at all)

This reminds me of spaghetti sauce I grew up with in New Orleans. It is rich in spice and full of robust flavors. Yum!! I do add diced green peppers to the simmered onions and cook until soft. This is a must have recipe for any spaghetti loving family.

Only used 1 lb. ground beef and it still turned out great. Cut the amount of oregano and basil in half, added a can of beef broth as recommended by some and only added 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Didn't have red pepper flakes. Also used Splenda instead of sugar. We loved it.

My husband and two teenage sons loved this sauce.  My Mom and I found it almost too spicy and I only used 1 tbsp. of the red pepper flakes. Also the 2 tbsp. salt seemed like a lot, I used 1 tbsp and 3 tbsp oregano.  Also used 1 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1 can of chicken broth.  My 4 quart slow cooker was 1 inch from the top when everything was added.  Sauted onions, garlic and put in slow cooker and then browned ground beef.  Added everything to slow cooker and cooked on high for 5 hours. Yummy

I took the advice of others and didn't use any salt, but I could have used a little. I also added some garlic powder towards the end and only simmered the sauce abomut half an hour. I used fresh herbs from my garden, sage, thyme, oregano, lemon basil, rosemary and a bay leaf. The sage gave it a kind of smokey flavor which was nice. I only gave it four stars because it was a bit too thick. Overall it was very tastey! Fresh herbs are great.

This sauce has great flavor and is easy to make. I cut down on the red pepper for my children. It is a little thick. I use the leftover as a pizza sauce. Which is wonderful!

This tasted so GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly.  One small problem, I didn't read the reviews first ....now I myself had no problem with the salt seeing as how I add it to everything anyway on my plate, but my family couldn't eat it!  
 I /should have realized that 2 TBL. of salt was a little much with all the other ingredients.   That said, I personally enjoyed it and will definitely be making again! With LESS salt of course!  Thanks for this recipe Noell C.  !

have made this twice with just one change - used diced tomatoes with herbs and spices instead of tomato sauce. although we really liked this sauce, we did find the oregano overpowering, but that is likely more of a personal thing, as we use it quite moderately. i will definitely make it again, but with less oregano for sure.

Very good.  It was interesting to hear people's opinion whether it was too spicy or not spicy enough when I made it. it came down to personal taste.

I halved the recipe because I didn't need 9 servings. Very good and tasty.. but both my bf and I thought it wasn't spicy enough and there is a little something missing. Next time I will cut out a little bit of salt, and add a couple shakes of cayenne pepper for a kick.

My husband and I both thought this was a great sauce.  I did make an adjustment and will make a couple more the next time I make it.  I used 1 1/2 Tbsp of red pepper flakes and though it was a flavorful hot, it was a little more than we would normally like, so next time I will use only 1 Tbsp. I also think that next time I will add a little bit of beef broth or some of the liquid from the canned mushrooms so that it is a little less thick.  My husband liked the consistency, but I thought it was hard to mix with the noodles because it was so thick.  As others have mentioned this would be an excellent lasagna sauce because of its thick and hearty nature.

Absolutely wonderful! I followed the advice in the reviews and halved the red pepper flakes and salt.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste.  I ended up adding about 1/4th cup of water, but the end result was fabulous!!!!

I can't give this five stars since I made a bunch of changes to the recipe.  
After reading other reviews, these are the changes I made:  I sauted the onions and garlic in only 1 T olive oil, used one lb. ground beef, 1 can tomato paste, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 big can crushed tomatoes, added 1 cup beef broth to thin it out, 1 T pepper flakes, 1 T salt, and I forgot the mushrooms, and it came out really good!  We liked the extra kick that the pepper flakes gave it and I think two T would've been way too much.  Very good recipe with the changes I made.

I used a little less red pepper, oregano, and basil (we have a toddler in our house) and it turned out beautifully!  The delicous auroma filled the house, a nice suprise for my husband when he arrived home from work.  Excellent!

This is the first meat sauce I've ever made. It was easy to make and very tasty. I do however wish I'd looked at the reviews before I made it. Other reviewers were dead on about saltiness, spiciness and thickness (and I like things salty and spicy)

If I remake this, I will halve the amount of salt, halve the amount of red pepper and inrease the ratio of tomato sauce to meat.

The salt!  The salt!  I think the recipe is perfect minus 1 tablespoon of salt.  Nearly 3000 mg's of sodium per serving is a bit much.

I cut this recipe in half since I didn't need the full recipe. Be warned,  this is very hot. I only used half a tablespoon of pepper flakes in the half recipe and I have now added diced tomatoes and 2 more tablespoons of sugar to try to counteract the heat. My three year old will never eat this with it this hot. I also added a green bell pepper, just because I like it in my sauce. It was a very tight mixture so I added water to simmer or I would have been frying it soon even on low. The taste is ok, but I'm beginning to feel like I've altered it enough to call it my own. I've got to go brew tea to put out the fire in my mouth!

I went with my gut and did not add 4tablespoons of oregano and basil. That’s 1/4 cup, maybe if it’s fresh it would be ok.  I only added 1tablespoon of each and the oregano flavor is overpowering.  Added more tomatoes (diced, 2-15 oz cans) to cut the oregano flavor.  Not saving this one!

I loved the ingredients, but I did add a bell pepper, and without adding water to the simmer, it's just way to thick to cook 2 hours = we also cut the salt in half. Thanks!

Very good taste and thickness.  I also added one can diced San Marzano tomatoes, used less salt and spices.  You can add more if needed.  I added a little fresh green pepper.  Will uses this recipe again.

That perfect mix of sweet & spicy! 

A few changes I made:

- the salt isn't needed, in my opinion. Any spaghetti sauce is salty enough!
- Used canola vs. olive oil (preference)
- Again to cut down on salt, I used crushed tomatoes (undrained) vs spaghetti sauce

I sauteed the onion/garlic combo in a skillet, and browned the meat (I used turkey) in a squat stock pot. Then I threw the onion/garlic on top and stirred in. I didn't drain either of those because I figured it would cook in well, and it did. If you're going to do this, though, you can probably cut down on the simmering time.

I made this tonight and would give this 6 stars if I could! So good. I made just a few small changes. Used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground pork. Only used 1 can of tomato paste since the sauce was pretty thick. Omitted sugar since I'm on the Whole 30 diet and used fresh mushrooms. I also thinned it out a bit with one cup of water. The spices I kept as-is and it IS spicy! And hallelujah! I ladled the sauce over steamed broccoli. One of the best meat sauces I have ever made. Thank you to the submitter! Will make this again, hands down.

Excellent recipe! This was actually my first time making spaghetti sauce, and I will never use store-bought sauce again! I followed other reviewers suggestion & only used 1/2 tbsp of salt, which was perfect. Also, I don't like tooo much meat in the sauce, so I used 1 lb of ground beef instead of 2, which I thought was plenty!  Note that this recipe has a good amount of heat! So if you're not big into spicy food, I'd definitely reduce (or eliminate) the red pepper flakes!:)

The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of salt and red pepper flake.  I made enough for 14 servings it was a little to salty and spicy.  I also added mild Italian sausages to the sauce after browning in the left over juices from the hamburger meat.  It complimented the dish with a small meat side item, which also had the additional flavor of the meat sauce.  Additional side salad and garlic bread to complete the meal.

Not sure how this recipe got so many reviews and so many changes were made, I'm confused. Anyway I followed it all the way and it couldn't have come out any better. Thanks for sharing with us.

This was outstanding!  I added less red pepper flakes and put 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic salt.  I also cooked the onions and garlic in bacon fat since olive oil goes rancid at high temperatures.  I used half grass fed ground beef and half pork sausage. Fat doesn't make you fat or cause heart issues. Do your research!!!  I am a thin healthy 40 year old and eat a lot of good fats. Watch the you tube video..butter makes your pants fall off.

Turned out great with spaghetti. I did use green peppers which i diced instead of the mushrooms, followed advice on reducing the salt and added a little more tomato sauce than suggested for a preferred consistency. 
Sprinkle on shredded parmesan or mozzarella to add taste.

Way to much oregano.  I used 2 Tbl. and it was still too much.  Only used 1 tbl. red pepper and less salt.  Heat was just right.  I will make this again.

This was wonderful!  I read a lot of the reviews beforehand.  I am a pretty experienced cook, so when I read a recipe, I can usually tell how it will turn out.  I cut WAY back on the red pepper flakes to about 1/2 TBL.  I could tell the sauce would be way too thick for my liking.  I cut out one can of the tomato sauce and subbed One 28 oz. can Crushed Tomatoes and added one can of water from the Crushed Tomato Can.  Other than that, it was excellent!  Great, great recipe.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thank you.

This is my go-to! Love it love it love it.  Freezes well. Here's my tweaks:
I used one pound of ground turkey and one pound of chicken breakfast sausage, also used only .5 tablespoon of chili pepper flakes and did not use salt

It is really great. the flavor is rich and it is very spicy!  I guess I did not realize it as I was cooking it.  my wife was not a fan because she "couldn't taste anything over the spice" but I will not hold that against her.  I guess the next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I will have to tame it a bit for my wife, but that is the only reason I would.  I added Italian sausage, because I like it.

This is not a bad recipe for a fast sauce. It is tasty but I prefer the more traditional Italian sauces.

so delicious! I omitted the red pepper flakes and mushrooms because I'm not a fan of those or spicy food, but all in all a solid meat sauce recipe - I think I found my go to for spaghetti sauce!

I'm sorry. I followed this recipe exactly. I've made numerous sauces and this was the worst sauce I have ever cooked and I'm a basic cook kind of a gal.  The herbs were over powering. I will never cook this again.

This recipe is good!  It's a nice twist on traditional meat sauce spaghetti, and I like things that are different from what you're normally used to.  I do like spicy foods, but if you're sensitive you might want to tone down the red pepper.  I used half of this recipe which serves 2 people fine.  I chopped up a green pepper very finely for added nutrition, turned out fine.  Nothing else to say, it's good!

I love this sauce!  I've been using it for awhile now.  I make it without the mushrooms because of my kids.  And I just use about 1/2lb of ground beef or sausage, whatever I have on hand.  Just one can of tomato paste but more tomato sauce.

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. It's pretty close to perfect. Using fresh ingredients, it would be - but most of us usually don't have the time for that. I like my sauce thick, and this was. It's easy to tweak to your liking, but the recipe is very good as is.

Too thick and too spicy.  I used all the mushroom juice and 1/2 cup of water...still too thick.  Used a 1/4 of red pepper flakes and still too hot for me.

My boyfriend and I both LOVE this recipe, but be weary if you don't like extra spicy sauce! We took the advice of someone else's review and added a can of beef broth to make it a little less thick. Leftovers? Freeze it - it's just as good the second time around!

This is a great base sauce....... I sauteed up onion and fresh mushrooms with garlic.  Then browned a combo of sasauge and ground beef together.  I used a large can of crushed tomatoes with basil and one can of tomato paste.  I did scale down the oregano and basil and added fresh rosemary.  I used some others advice and subsituted brown sugar for the white.  I let is simmer for about 3 hours.  It had a great taste and didn't make a hugh amount for our small family of 3.

This is the best base meat sauce!  I call it base because I made quite a bit of changes, for our taste.  I added 1 to 2 lbs of hot sausage.  Cook sausage in the large pot.  Ground beef was cooked separately and then drained.  Once sausage was cooked, I removed it from the pot and sliced the links (set aside).  Removed all but 1 tbsp of sausage fat and cooked onion as directed and then added the garlic (I used 8 cloves of garlic).  Sausage bits at the bottom of pot adds great flavor.  Add the drained ground beef.  I also changed tomatoe paste and sauce to 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and 1 28 oz can of peeled plum shape tomatoes.  I changed red pepper amount to 1 tsp and salt to 1/2 tbsp.  The changes I made prevented this recipe from being too thick, salty or hot.  I simmered for about 30 minutes vs 2 hours.   My family absolutely loved it.  It can also be frozen for future use.
