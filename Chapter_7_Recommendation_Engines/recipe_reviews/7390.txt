I wouldn't even rate this as 1 star.  No taste, odd texture.  Everyone picked it out of the center and threw it away. This was for our Easter cake. I would suggest deleting it completely!

I didn't like the taste.  You could actually taste the cornstarch.  Some that had the cake actually liked it though.

Rich and dark and very creamy in texture, lovely butterscotch flavour and my fiance loves it! I add a little extra butter at the end which helps the smoothness and the flavour. I've been adding it to thick custard over the holidays to make a yummy filling for cupcakes and tarts and eclaires! I'm not a huge butterscotch fan, but this won me over totally.

I wish I had read the reviews before making it.  My husband liked it.  But I was disappointed in it.  I too could taste the corn starch.  If I cooked it until it boiled it would have burned.  Perhaps the size of the boiler used would make a difference as far as the boiling and burning aspect.

This recipe, as written, made a much stiffer product than I remembered from childhood.   It is probably OK for a filling between layers, but I wanted a frosting.

I used 1 cup of water instead and used it as a frosting on an 8 inch chocolate cake.  It would also taste great on a spice cake or an apple cake.  It's not overly sweet and has a pudding like consistency that stays soft even after refrigeration.
