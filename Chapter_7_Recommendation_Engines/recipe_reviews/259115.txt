Whenever I make a recipe from a food site, I make it exactly as shown if I plan to rate it.  No fair making changes and then rating it a 3 or 4 because it did not taste the way you felt it should.   So, no changes, followed exactly as written. I am a chicken nugget/chicken finger lover but hate fried foods. These nuggets were wonderful and as it made so many, I have lunch/dinner for the next few days. They were easy to make and by using the plastic bag, clean-up was a breeze.
Given the fact that chicken breast is $24.00 per pound where I live, I am very careful about using the breasts unless  I am sure it will be worth it.  These nuggets are worth every penny of the $24.00.

These were the greatest!  With the exception of additional garlic I made these as written.  Instead of baking on a rack I put them on a foil lined pan sprayed with Crisco butter spray and backed for 15 minutes and then under the broiler for a minute.  They were perfect.  Served them with honey mustard sauce from this site.  This is my go-to chicken nugget recipe.

This was really good. The ranch flavor comes through a lot more than I expected it to. They were also nice and crisp. This is great for a healthier alternative but I do plan on trying these deep fried just so that I can say I tried. Great recipe and 5 stars all the way!

These are tasty, but be sure to watch you don’t over cook them. They dry up pretty easily.

Moist, flavorful and crispy!  I followed recipe exactly as written and they are amazing! No need to change a thing. Why do so many write a review  for a certain recipe after they have changed so many of the ingredients ? It's no longer the original recipe. I'll get off my soapbox now. Make these, your family will thank you for it.

These were so easy to make and were amazing.  Have made them 3 times in 3 weeks!  Experimented with a Chili Lime Ranch dressing and they were awesome!  This will be a keeper and made often!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I like that there was no extra salt added. These were really tasty and the kids loved them. I only gave it 4 stars though because it's just not a visually appealing dish. The panko does not brown evenly and the nuggets are very pale. I wouldn't serve this to guests for that reason and I'm not even sure I'll make it again because of it.

Made it today and it was very good.  Good flavor and easy to make. I served it with Honey mustard dip. 
Thought it was a healthy dish and would recommend for busy families to make ahead and freeze for lunches & yummy quick meals.

Perfect. Used a pizza baking pan with wholes in it so the bottoms of the tenders didn't get soggy. Air flowed through and made them crisp!

I added cumin (instead of parsley) and 1/2 teaspoon of homemade garlic paste (instead of garlic powder). I did not use PAM to replace with Ghee (clarified butter) and parmesan cheese for a cleaner and lactose tolerant recipe. According to the Critics (children), the recipe was delicious but recommended oregano and to add more oil.

I did not bake on a rack (just single layer on aluminum foil in a 13x9 Pyrex baking dish) and I probably got the proportions wrong and definitely did the order of combination "wrong" but the whole thing worked out great in the end! This is essentially the exact same thing Kraft posted on their recipes but this uses ranch dressing instead of mayo so I like this a lot better. I did add a tiny bit of shredded mozarella because I had it on hand so the cheese was a little more "melty" but I was really glad I found a good use for the panko crumbs I had on hand. I bought them by mistake, intending to get regular bread crumbs and they are a totally different beast :)

My husband and I loved the flavor as did the visiting 5 yr old we made the nuggets for! They were good heated up as left overs the next day too. I had to make my own ranch dressing from a packet but had all the ingredients. Great recipe.

Super fast and easy to make.  My family ALL loved these and I have a toddler, 7 year old, and 12 year old.  Next time I will broil one side for 5 minutes and then flip for another 5 minutes because only one side was really crispy this time.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

My husband and 4 yr old son LOVED this recipe, as is - we all did.  Just made it for the first time recently, and we will be making it again...and again.  Made it with my son's help, it's great recipe for a toddler to help with.

Great recipe. Followed directions exactly and it turned out great. Wouldn't change a thing and my kids requested that I make it again.

I'm sorry, but my family didn't like these at all. I guess we aren't ranch dressing fans, and it just didn't compare to the crispness of the tried-and-true flour-egg wash-seasoned breadcrumbs method, even if you bake it that way.

Super simple and tasty!  Love how the ranch dressing keeps the nuggets moist.  I had to use Gluten-Free bread crumbs and they still came out good.

My husband is really "picky".  I don't make anything on allrecipes.com unless it has been rated a 4 or 5 stars.  
HE LOVED THESE.  It's a keeper.  Congratulations!

My son is a picky eater.  He actually liked them, and said he would eat them again.  SCORE!  They had good flavor from the ranch dressing and were nice and crispy.  The 15 minutes cook time was perfect.  This recipe is now in my recipe box.
