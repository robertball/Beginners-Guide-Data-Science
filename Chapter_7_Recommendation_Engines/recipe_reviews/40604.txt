This recipe has wonderful Asian flavor but I added some ingredients and made some tiny adjustments and it went from good to terrific very quickly. That's the beauty of allrecipe.com's Review/Rating Section; you get to share helpful ideas that can make a recipe shine. My changes, 
#1 Instead of using the chops whole, I sliced them into thin strips.You could also dice the meat. I dredged the pieces in seasoned flour and fried in hot peanut oil until golden brown.
#2 I used brown sugar (big improvement)
#3 I always use Kikoman Soy Sauce for its unique flavor. 
#4 I added a piece of fresh ginger and two cloves of garlic, diced. 
#5 I used a potato peeler and shredded a large carrot & added that near the end. 
#6 I added chicken broth to the fry pan and let it thicken, which it did beautifully. After scraping all of the tasty brown bits I returned the meat to the pan.
#7 At the very end I threw in frozen brocolli. Don't get me wrong, Fireball provided a great recipe but my family found the additions made for a better dish. Another possibility is to add cayenne or hot sauce. This tasted exactly like Kung Pao Pork but without the peanuts which we don't like anyway. The added vegtables can include anything from greenbeans to bok choy to cauliflower. The sauce was a deep orange/brown and it I would be proud to serve it again.Thank you, fireball and allrecipes.com

Simple and tasty.  I did cut my boneless pork loin chops in small cubes and dredged in flour before stir frying, for a yummy light coating.  I substituted peanut oil for oil, and brown sugar for the white.  Also I cut back a bit on the soy sauce and increased the OJ accordingly.  I let it simmer gently until the pork was tender.  Served over oriental rice noodles with steamed broccoli.  Will make again and again.

Ohmigosh!! This was really good! Of course, I used some of the suggestions of other reviewers. I almost never make a recipe as written. I dredged my thin chops in flour, browned in olive oil and removed to a plate. Then, in the oil in the pan, I sauteed two minced garlic cloves and green onions (6) sliced on the diagonal. Used brown sugar instead of white. Before adding cornstarch mixture, I shredded one whole carrot into sauce mixture. After thickening the sauce, I added one 6-ounce can of mandarin oranges and returned pork to pan. Oh, by the way, I mixed cornstarch with the juice from mandarin orange can instead of water. I doubled the sauce ingredients except the soy sauce. Served over white rice and passed crushed red pepper at the table. This was awesome! Can't wait to try it with chicken!

I doubled the sauce, try it on rice! YUMMY! I couldn't get enough of the sauce on the pork! More teryaki flavored than orange but still AWESOME! I'm going to do this with chicken breast just to try it out! This is a KEEPER!

This didn't blow anyone away, but it was a solidly good meal.  I thought the sauce needed something else, so I added a bunch of red pepper flakes, garlic, and black pepper.  That helped quite a bit.  I sliced the pork before cooking and served it all with rice and broccoli.  Edited to add:  I tried this again with the suggestions of other people, and it was much better.  Dice the pork, toss in a mixture of flour and black pepper, fry in oil, then coat with sauce.

* Definitely double the sauce. I had to cook longer because I had extra thick pork chops. Next time, I would cut the soy sauce in half and replace with extra OJ. My daughter did not like it because it tasted like teriyaki. I don't like teriyaki, but I liked it. My husband said it was good, but a bit to salty. Serve with rice. Thanks for the recipe

This was pretty good.  A little salty, even though I used reduced-sodium soy sauce.  It thickened up right away when I added the corn starch, so that was good.  I enjoyed the orange flavor.  I added ground giner, garlic powder, and black pepper to the pork chops as they were browning.  Served with steamed broccoli and brown rice.

Excellent dish! I picked up a pound of boneless pork loinchops that I cut up in large pieces. I seasoned with salt and black pepper and dredged in flour. In a skillet I heated up the veg oil then cooked the pork chops, and set it aside. To the same skillet I added a little more oil, then I grated a ginger (thumb size) and added one garlic clove, chopped,and scraped the bottom bits up before adding the orange juice, soy sauce and brown sugar. I heated up the sauce to a boil. I actually used 2 naval oranges for the orange juice called for in this recipe. I also zested a little orange (1 tsp.)for a more stronger orange flavor. I thickened up the sauce with cornstarch and orange juice that I reserved on the side. I added the pork back and simmered for a few more minutes. Delicious and full of flavor! I was very pleased with  this dish - easy to prepare and very tasty. I loved the orange sauce which was just right, not overpowering at all. The brown sugar was a better choice for the orange sauce. The orangey aroma was inviting as well. I served this with, "Colorful Fried Rice," and "Garlic Broccoli Spears," also from this website.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe!! My husband made this for the family and the only change he made was to throw in some onion slices then garnish with chopped green onion stems. He wanted to make the sauce a little thicker and couldnt quite figure out how, but never-the-less it is a very tastey meal!! It was a hit with the kids too. Thank You!

Very yummy!  It was tender, flavorful, and simple.  Everyone elses' tips were really helpful.  The ginger and garlic definetely added flavor, and reducing the soy sauce and sugar helped the dish.  This would most likely go well with mushrooms.  Probably making this again sometime soon.  Thanks!

This recipe was great! I made it just like the recipe said, with one alteration - I used Splenda instead of sugar (lighter on the calories). I thought it tasted wonderful and there was just enough sauce for each chop. I highly recommend this recipe!

Ok, this is how I changed it up and everybody loved it! Rather than just regular oj, I bought frozen concentrate oj and then when making it, I only added in one can of water (directions call for 3 cans of water to 1 frozen oj)...making it a much higher concentration than for normal oj. I also used brown sugar and 1/2 the soy sauce, but doubled the sauce overall. I marinated the pork in a portion of the sauce for an hour. I think the heavier concentration of orange in the flavor was wonderful.

Nice flavor!  I used a little less soy sauce, bc I ran out...but I made up for it with a little more OJ.  I even poured extra sauce on my asparagus and didn't have to double the recipe!  Careful if you use thin porkchops not to overcook like I did.  I'm sure it will be better next time!

The flavor of the sauce is very good. I made a lot of changes though, based on reviews. I did cut the chops into thin strips, and coat in flour before frying. I made more of a stir fry, with red peppers and carrots. Served over rice. Yum! Thanks.

Well I made this tonight and it was delicious!  Glad I needed a quick recipe.  I switched from vegetable to Olive Oil, and added garlic and ginger to give it more of a flavor.  The pork chops were so tender and juicy that hubby turned to me and asked me if it was chicken.  He gave it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 because it is quick, easy and yummy!  I recommend if you like sweet.  I served it with white rice and had enough "gravy" to cover everything.  I wish I had made the snow peas I had in the fridge, because it would have went very nice with the dish.  It had a "chinese food restaurant" flavor, which was good!

Mmmm this was really good! As usual I switched up a couple things as suggested by other reviewers! The first time I made it I cut up the pork into strips and fried it in peanut oil. I cut back on the soy sauce and substituted with more OJ, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar and served it on white rice! The second time was even better! I used strips of chicken instead of pork and doubled the sauce (using the same changes as previously mentioned). Then I made it into a stir fry with a bag of frozen veggies! The kind with the sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, baby corn, and julienned carrots, and red and yellow peppers. Mixed in the chicken and sauce it was so good (there was plenty of sauce to coat the veggies and chicken!! It was great served with rice and spring rolls as a side!

I don't often write reviews but I love this recipe so much that I wanted to do it.  I've made this with both chicken and pork and both were delicious. I always make twice the sauce because I like it so much.  I followed other suggestions to use more OJ and less Soy sauce which made a much more orange flavor which we like.  I've done both types of sugar and liked both.  I highly recommend this recipe and feel it's one you can experiment with, without messing it up.

We enjoyed these. I added a bit more Soy Sauce (low sodium), a "glug" of Dry Sherry, garlic powder while browning  and a touch of Ginger Paste. Nice meal with the rice and broccoli. Thanks, fireball2000.

This wasn't bad.  I was looking for something "orange" in flavor but in fact it was more "soy sauce" in flavor, which was disappointing.  However, it was still pretty good and I'll try it again with a lot less soy sauce and a little more OJ.

We just loved this meal! I found it very simple to make and I always appreciate that in a recipe. My family really likes soy sauce so we certainly didn't think it was too salty. I cut my pork chops into strips because my chops were really thick. I didn't have any O.J. so I used a Passion, Orange & Peach blend that I did have. I only mention this because I really liked that I was able to use a similar but different juice and still really enjoy the flavor. It made a yummy sauce and it was great over rice. Thanks. Plan to make this again really soon!

Really good, with similar modifications as others.  Made it as a stir fry: doubled and sliced the meat; tripled the sauce, adding diced ginger and garlic; substituted brown sugar for white; added broccoli, carrots, and zucchini.  Close enough to Chinese for the picky 10 and 12 year olds at my table.

This recipe didn't go over as well as we'd hoped. It was easy to prepar, but not the right flavor for us with pork, the OJ was too sweet, and the taste of soy sauce wasn't right either.  Over all it was fine if the taste meets your preferences

It had good flavor, a little on the salty side however. I will try adding a little more cornstarch next time, the sauce was not as thick as I had hoped.

Good job Fireball2000.  With modifications this recipe was COMPLETELY awesome.  Sliced pork diagonally into 1" strips.  Dredged in flour with fresh cracked pepper & pinch of cayenne.  Used brown sugar as opposed to white for the sauce, along with tangerine juice, also added 1/8 tsp of ginger & 1/8 tsp of chinese 5 spice to the mix.  Minced 3 cloves of garlic and added to sauted pork strips in peanut oil while browning.   Included julienned red pepper, sliced mushroons, one grated carrot and asparagus spears along with corn startch thickener to make exceptionally yummy.    Knowing how amazing the was, I would've doubled the sauce.  Served over a bed of rice and finished with a squeeze of lime for a lovely, bright taste.  ENJOY!

A nice change!  I really like citrus taste so this worked for me, but I have to be honest - I wouldn't want to have it every day.  A nice thing to make from random leftovers in my fridge :)

Excellent recipe, once I added garlic and ground ginger. My husband raved about the sauce. I looked up from cutting my meat to realize that he was already done! The sauce also tastes good over mashed potatoes on the side, but you'll want to double the sauce to have enough for the pork and the potatoes.  Here's what I did: Used boneless pork loin ribs instead of chops, but it's probably good either way. Added 1 minced garlic clove to the pan while pork was cooking. Then took all that out of pan, scraped it a bit, then added a little more olive oil, heated up for a minute, then sauteed 2 minced garlic cloves in pan for about 3 minutes before adding orange juice, soy sauce, only 2 teaspoons of white sugar, and 1/4 tsp ground ginger. Then follow original recipe the rest of the way.  Would also make a good stir-fry sauce, I think.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I did make a couple of minor changes though: I marinated the pork in orange juice for about an hour and then barbecued it and made the gravy separately in a pot.  That way the pork still had the yummy orange flavor but my boyfriend also got to use his bbq.  I also would recommend using the low sodium soy sauce, as others have suggested.  We didn't and it was quite salty.

These chops were outstanding and every bite was gone.  The only change to the sauce was that I doubled the orange juice and added two cloves of crushed garlic.  I thickened the sauce a little bit with a small amount of flour.  I served the chops over rice.  We will definitely have this again.  Delicious!!

This recipe was great! I did follow advice from other reviewers and used half the amount of soy sauce, replacing it with more oj, using brown sugar instead of white, and dredging the pork chops in seasoned flour. I doubled the sauce and served it over rice. The whole family loved it!

This was very ok. I cut back 1 Tbsp on the soy sauce after reading others' reviews. I'd make this again only if I had no other options, but even using bbq sauce from a jar would be better than this. Sorry; we wanted to like it, but it was pretty plain. I'm not sure how I could improve on this, except to say I don't plan on trying.

If you like Asian food you have to love this one. Delicious and good as any Chinese restuarant Orange Pork I have had. i doubled the sauce, marinated the pork in soy sauce. Also cut the pork into chunks about 1 inch pieces. I added water chestnuts and thin sliced carrots. Served over steamed rice with sauted cabbage with crushed red peppers as side dish. A wonderful Chinese dinner without the usual fuss.Thank you for this one.

Excellent and very quick.  Of course I tinkered a bit.  I used thinly sliced pork tenderloin instead of Pork Chops.  I didn't have orange juice so I used low salt chicken broth and a tablespoon of Grande Marnier for the orange flavour.  And I coated the pork tenderloin slices in about a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with garlic salt.  Also cut the soy sauce to 3 T instead of 4.  Served it over lighly steamed carrot slices and broccoli and basmati rice and it was just wonderful.  The whole dinner took about 20 minutes to prepare.  It actually didn't smell that great while cooking (the Grand Marnier smelled overpowering), but it tasted WONDERFUL.  My husband and I loved it.  If I were cooking for more, I would double the sauce, though.  Thanks for the great recipe base!

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't have pork chops, but I did have several oranges I needed to use and some pork country style ribs so I just used it.  I followed the recipe exactly using a slow cooker to cook them.  Big hit with the family.  My husband doesn't even know he's eating something akin to Chinese food.  Thanks for the great recipe!! I will use again.

Very tasty, my family loved it!
I followed some other suggestions here (less soy sauce, use brown sugar). But I also changed some things though. 

I used pork shoulders and cut them into 1" cubes and coated it in an egg whites-cornstarch mixture (3 egg whites + ½ cup cornstarch) before frying.

I generally do not rate a recipe if I made changes without trying the original first.  But, this time I did not have any orange juice on hand and used lemonade and orange flavoring. We were able to taste a subtle hint of the orange and the soy sauce was not overpowering but added depth to the flavor.  I dredged the chops in flour and browned, then made sauce and put chops back in to cook for about 20 minutes.  Very tender - served with Carribean Rice. I would serve to company, nice post...thanks.

This turned out great and was a big hit with my family. I used sliced chicken instead of pork and added cooked, frozen broccoli at the end when I put the chicken back into the sauce. It was delicious! Next time I will add the fresh ginger and garlic that others suggested and try using brown sugar instead. It was really good served with rice.

Because this was SO quick and easy and tasty I have to give it five stars!  I also added in some fresh spinach and a dash of powdered ginger, some chinese 5 spice and a little garlic pepper.  It was great and done in under 10 minutes from start to finish.  I'll make this again...

I tried this recipe with chicken instead of pork, because I had alot of chicken on hand. I used brown sugar and  doubled the sauce as suggested but didn't double the soy. Despite that, I still found it a bit too salty and next time will try even less soy. I also added some minced garlic and grated ginger to the sauce, which gave it a nice flavor. I cut the chicken into strips and next time I would like to try dredging the pieces in flour as suggested already. Overall I thought it was just good, although my boyfriend thought it was one of the best he's had.

This was pretty good. I used half the soy sauce called for. I used white sugar, but may try brown sugar next time to compare the taste. Next time I think I will make this in the crock pot - I love how tender pork is when made in a slow cooker. I think I will add some orange marmalade to the sauce and make up a second batch of the sauce to go over rice. Over all, a good recipe.

Had eight pork loin pieces so tripled the sauce. Waited awhile for pork to brown, not familiar with thicker cuts. Directions were a little ambiguous to me as to how long to cook the chops. All in all, took about 20 min. to cook. Still, the dish came out great. The pork was tender when hot but toughened up as it cooled. The sauce was reminiscent of Chinese orange sauce without the pepper flakes. The family loved it with a sides of sautéed green beans and carrots and apple sauce. Next time, will likely cube into 1-in. pieces.

I made the recipe as written and it was delicious.  I also sliced an orange and served it with the meal.  As we were eating we were thinking of all the meals we could use this sauce.  Very versatile sauce.

Wonderful recipe. The only thing I did differently was add a little fresh grated ginger to the sauce. I will agree with everyone saying to double the sauce recipe. It tastes great over rice and broccoli. 2 thumbs up from the whole family.

Like other reviewers, I used brown sugar and some vegetables.  Also about half of the soy sauce, because we don't like things too salty.  I added a little extra orange juice.  Next time I will try the mandarin oranges added.

My family loved this - my super picky 7 year old never finishes any meat and she asked for seconds!  I did listen to some reviewers though and used flour on the porkchops - I don't think this will drastically affect the recipe if you skip that step, and we used 2.5 pounds of pork so I tripled the sauce except I only used 1.5 times the soy sauce because some said it wasn't orange enough. I also tossed in a can of mandarin oranges toward the end.  It was delicious.  The sauce was great.  I'm sure it was good as written, I just wanted to enhance the orange flavor and we loved it.

I've tried it twice because the recipe sounds so good.  But both times there were problems.  First, the timing is off.  It took a lot longer to cook the pork chops than it suggests .  Browning evenly on both sides just doesn't cut it.  Secondly, it took longer than a 2 minute boil to thicken the sauce which in any case didn't taste like much.  I've never complained about a recipe on this sight before, but there is a lot missing from this one.

Delicious! Put a little garlic powder on the chops and dredged them in seasoned flour before browning. Then transferred them to the oven while I prepared the sauce and the sides. I used low sodium soy sauce, and a touch less than the recipe called for. I also put in a can of drained Mandarin oranges save a tablespoon of the juice from the can and added a touch more orange juice. I grated a little fresh ginger in too. This will be in my regular rotation, family loved it.

I cut boneless pork loin chops in halve lengthwise, sprinkled with garlic powder, browned in vegetable oil, transferred to glass 9X13, than made the sauce in the skillet (I added about a couple tablespoons of brown sugar) and poured over pork. Baked in oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Made a harvest medley rice and roasted some carrots while it was cooking. I got no complaints from anyone, there were no leftovers...it just lacked something I can't put my finger on...I would have liked some red pepper flakes in it to give it a slight zing...but family is not into it...will use recipe again and tweak a little more, but it was a good place to start.

I would give five stars, but I changed it a little bit.  Brown sugar instead of white.   I also made it with fresh honey from our friends beehive.  Both are excellent for sweetness.  I browned mine without oil and used the fat from the chops for the oil.  I did as another suggested and used the juice from mandarin oranges instead of water.  I added a large chunk of dried ginger and 1/4 cup of dried cranberries  and let the mixture marinate on keep warm on my stove for about 45 minutes.    This gave the flavors a chance to penetrate the meat, I drained off about 1/3 cup of sauce and added the cornstarch.  I love that allrecipes gives a great base for starting recipes.  great on any type of rice.  Thanks.

I tried this recipe exactly as written and found it to be quite good.  The only thing I intend to do differently the next time I make it, is to use low sodium soy sauce and more cornstarch and water.  Unless you like a very salty taste and a rather thin sauce, I would recommend both changes for a really nice pork chop supper.  I served mine tonight with white rice and corn, and the combination worked well. :-)

I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, added 1/4 tsp ground ginger, substituted oj for the water.  I also put in 2 potatoes, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 2 stalks of celery, 1 red pepper, and cut up the pork chops into cubes.  I loved the flavour of this, and will definitely make it again.

Came out great!!  I did make some changes however... I cut the pork chopsinto rectangular peices and dipped in flour before I sauted them. (I added cracked pepper, salt, ginger, garlic powder and mesquite seasoning to the flour.) I doubled the OJ and brown sugar and only used 1/8th soy sauce. I added matchstick carrots (1/2 cup), sliced red, orange and yellow sweet peppers (about 8 med sized peppers) Garlic and half a medium onion. instead of adding corn starch I added low sodium chicken broth like someone suggested... I added the chicken and let it simmer down and thicken up. Came out great!!! Thanks all for your recipe and suggestions.

This recipe is an excellent base from which to add your own special twist.  I took some of the other reviewers' advice and sliced the pork thin before frying.  Gave it a wonderful, crispy quality.  I gave four i/o five stars because you do need to tweak it to give the recipe that 'Wow' factor.

I followed suit of what others did.  I thinly sliced my pork and dredged it in flour, then fried it in hot peanut oil.  I then removed it from pan and cooked up some chopped onion and garlic and removed that.  Then I constructed the sauce (doubled it) and used brown sugar instead of white like others suggested.  I also used chicken broth that I had in my fridge instead of water, eliminated the cornstarch and added red pepper flaked.  Simmered that for a minute the added the pork and onions again. Added shredded carrots & fresh broccoli.  Delish!!!

Really good and so easy! I would have give it 5 stars but made a couple of changes. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and sprinkled the chops with garlic powder. Definately a keeper. Served with broccoli and white rice on the side.

Three stars because husband liked it (but then again, he eats pretty much anything).  The rest of us thought it was too salty (used low sodium soy sauce) and had kind of an odd flavor.  I doubled the sauce, but didn't need to.  It would have been plenty as written.  Won't be keeping this one...sorry!

Wow...I made this for dinner tonight and my husband can't stop raving about it. I did use a few of the other suggestions and doubled the sauce from the start. We loved this and will make it again. As my husband said...this is a keeper. Can't wait to try it on chicken too. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

I did not change anything from the recipe and it got better as it sat. I had to double the recipe to accomidate for my family size.  We had enough to have leftovers, but overnight it was really salty and could not eat the sauce but the pork chop was still good.  Will make it again for my family.

My husband and I thought this was delicious, I should have served it with noodles, and will the next time. Also broccoli goes well with it.

We loved this!  Like many other reviewers, I followed the suggestions of LIZ5 for the stir-fry and used low-sodium soy sauce.  I used homemade chicken broth which cut both the saltiness of the soy and mellowed the impact of the orange juice, but it worked for us.  (I added 2 1/3 c broth and ended up adding 1 T cornstarch mixed with 2 T water to thicken.  The flour wasn't enough on it's own to thicken that much liquid) Did add 2 cloves fresh minced garlic, but had to use ground ginger (1/4 t), because I didn't have any fresh.  Used shredded carrot, celery, water chestnuts and broccoli this time, but I am sure other veggie combos would work just as well. Definitely give this one a try!

This recipe gives you such amazing Asian/orange flavors. I followed the stir-fry suggestions of some other reviewers--used strips of pork and added garlic, fresh ginger root, red pepper flakes, fresh veggies, water chestnuts, a little chicken broth. Delicious and easy. I used low-sodium soy sauce and that was just right. I think this would be even tastier with chicken.

at first I thought it was too orangey and too salty, but everyone loved it.   **I added lots of crushed red pepper and a few dashes of habanero sauce to make it spicy.  I also added some orange peel, ginger, and chicken broth.  I just added, tasted, added, tasted until I was satisfied with the flavor changes.

Sorry, but I can only give this 3 stars. Basically it is a good recipe but definitely (in my opinion) needed some help.  I substituted brown sugar for white and added 2 tsps. of grated fresh gingerroot to the sauce.  Also added 1/2 tsp. of powdered mustard.   To our taste this was a little more lively.

You think this is good?  Wait 'til you use LAMB  chops instead!  A real inner party favourite!  I'd suggest you leave out the soy sauce though.  Will make this'n again and again.

I make a similar recipe, but without soy sauce or cornstarch...I deglaze the pan after cooking the chops with juice of one orange, zest of one orange and honey...makes a nice sauce for the chops...but there will not be extra sauce left for other vegis...I can't imagine soy sauce and cornstarch being good in this

This was not as good as I hoped.  I doubled the sauce as other suggested and sliced the pork into strips.  I added garlic, baby corn and water chestnuts and served over rice.  The flavor was not as strong as I would have liked it to be.  not sure i will make again.

This recipe turned out really good tonight. Slightly salty but that can be fixed by using low sodium soy sauce. I wasn't quite sure if this recipe was meant to be left using whole pork chops or if a step was left out of the directions. I didn't think the *whole* pork chop was a good idea so I sliced the chops into thin strips. This way worked great! I was able to serve them over rice and use the sauce, as well. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

I agree with others - half the soy sauce is plenty.  I used diced chicken instead of porkchops and added mushrooms & green pepper and made more of a stir-fry.  It turned out great.

Wanting to try something different from barbecue I tried this recipe.  I took the advice of others doubled the sauce and used brown sugar, name brand soy sauce added the broccoli. The mid range score is more a reflection of taste and texture of the sauce, which was strong on soy and texture was grainy despite throwing out the first batch and even cooking the second batch longer.  I won't be using this recipe again.

We followed the recipe, except that the pork chops we found had bones and I didn’t have any orange juice, so used lemonade.  As this wasn’t quite as sweet, I used 2T of monkfruit sweetener instead of 1-1/2T.  I don’t consider that the latter would have affected the flavour, as it’s a pretty reliable substitute.  We also used 2 tsp flour in 2 tsp water, because my husband objects strenuously to cornstarch.

Anyway, it tasted great!

I followed some of the suggestions from some other reviews. I added onion, garlic, ginger, and added broccoli to the sauce. I also doubled the sauce, but reduced the soy sauce. And I used brown sugar instead of white. It was very tasty. I've given it four stars because so many tweaks were required.

I suck at cooking.  I made it for dinner, and it turned out good.  Read the other reviews, cubed the pork, used 1/2 the soy, brown sugar  instead of white, and a little extra OJ.

Excellent recipe! I used about a tablespoon of orange marmalade instead of the white sugar, but did everything else exactly as written. This is delicious served with the sauce over brown or wild rice.

It was good, but I would cut back on the sugar, a little too sweet.

I rated this recipe as is. With the additions and changes I made, easily a 5 star. Second time I followed others suggestions of lightly coating in flour, doubled sauce, added minced garlic and ginger, upped the soy sauce, and added some sesame seeds, added broccoli to the sauce and pork while warming. Definitely cut the pork into small pieces and served over brown rice. The sauce tasted amazing over the rice and broccoli. Its a good base and easily made to fit your own specific tastes!

Delicious!!!  I would serve to company.  I browned the (bone in) pork chops in butter.  When I removed the chops, I added 4 cloves of garlic to pan.  I halved the amount of soy sauce (low sodium) and used 5 smaller navel oranges and added some freshly ground ginger to sauce.   This will be on our regular dinner rotation, thank you!!

Made modifications on LIZ5's suggestion by ALSO adding 2-3 tablespoons of thick cut orange marmalade to make it more orangey as well as shredded orange zest (orange peel)for decoration. Sprinkled Cinnamon complements this dish too as a festive sauce.

I'm sorry to say that I did not like this recipe.  Even having cut down on the soy sauce, it was still had way too much of a soy sauce flavor.  Did not enjoy.

This was a good meal, but it wasn't over the tops good.  We did make some changes - I marinated the pork in the sauce first, and then cut the pork and marinated the strips in the sauce.  I also used brown sugar, like some other recommended.  I added some ginger and garlic to the marinade.  Oh, and I also used frozen OJ concentrate, so I didn't use a lot, and had a very orange flavor.  Which was better than very salty, that I was concerned about with the Soy Sauce.  :-) This is something we will try again.

Oh my gosh!  Wonderful! Made a few additions.  I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  After the chops were cooked, I sautéed onions and minced garlic in the pan drippings before adding the OJ and soy sauce.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  Thank you for this recipe!

Fantastic taste! I bought stewing pork and was looking for a recipe to use it with. I don't like orange juice, but I had some pineapple juice so I used that instead - deliciousness. I will have to make this recipe more often, and I will try it with chicken, hopefully the results are just as tasty!

OMG Even my pickiest eater ate this it was wonderful. I to did like the others people and cut my pork into cubes and tossed the cubes into a seasoned flour mix of S&P Garlic powder and onion powder, and ginger, browned the cubes over med high heat. I mixed my liquid together with two cloves of garlic minced. put thinly sliced carrots into the pan and tossed them around right before I added my liquid. I skipped the cornstarch and water step as I have a corn allergy. It was thick enough with the flour from the pork. My family of 5 will be eating this dish often! super quick and easy to whip up when you need something fast and easy!

This gets 5 stars due to the quick meal that was extremely tasty, a very nice, subtle flavor. I did as other reviewers suggested and dredged the chops in seasoned flour first, otherwise it was exactly as written.

Really, really easy.  Added garlic while browning the pork and think it helped.  Goes well with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Next time, I think I'll try doing the stir fry version others mentioned.

This is SUPER yummy!!  I did a few different things though.  To the chops I sprinkled alittle 5 spice powder and Kosher salt on each chop before putting them into the skillet.  To the soysauce I added about 1 teaspoon ginger and the corn starch.  I omited the sugar and water but increased the OJ to 1 1/2 cups. Then i cut the chops into strips and put a few stir fry veggies in it and serving it over Thai rice which has a different taste then the "normal" rice.  YUMMY!!

My husband said it didn't have any taste.  My daughter thought it was too much orange flavor even though I didn't put as much oj in and also added other things (garlic, chili paste, carrots, water chestnuts, and more).  My husband told me not to make it again!

4 stars for the concept and I made some minor changes.  For the pork, I cut the chops into strips as others did, and for the sauce, instead of using water I used ginger ale and used brown sugar instead of white.  Reduced the amount of sugar to counter the sugar in the ginger ale, and tripled the amounts for 3x the sauce.

For those who prefer a more authentic Asian flavour consider adding scallions (green onions) cut on the bias,snow peas, garlic, and the aromatic Chinese five spice cinnamon,star anise fennel,cloves,ginger,licorice,szechuan peppercorn and white pepper) which can be found in most grocery stores. Five Spices can be potent so I recommend starting lightly ,tasting as you mix and adding more if necessary.

Easy to make. My family said it was ok. A little to tangy for my taste. May try again but use brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Really good orange flavor.  In my case the meat was a little tough.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed this recipe!

Good.  Quick.  Want to try making it the way some of the other people made it (cut the pork in chunks and put it over rice - a la Asian dish).

A very good recipe.  I sort of guesstimated the amounts for the sauce, but I think I added a little more sugar and oj than asked for.  I also squeezed fresh juice from an orange, and then dumped the pulp right into the pan.  I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before frying them.  I served the sauce separately with the chops because of my son's preference, but I think simmered in the sauce would have been excellent!

This was delicious.  I cut the chops into thin strips and dredged in flour.  I also added minced garlic, ginger and carrots.  Served over brown rice.  Tasted authentic and kids loved.

YUMMM! I dredged in flour after cutting into chunky cubes and served with steamed broccoli and rice. I mixed it together as a bowl and practically licked the thing clean! Definitley a favorite pork recipe.

I liked this recipe. I made 4 pork chops and found that the sauce was enough to cover the pork chops, but I can see if people wanted more sauce for their rice that this recipe wasn't enough.  I served it with rice and steam pea pods.  I might season the pork next time with a little garlic, salt and pepper before cooking.  Otherwise a quick and simple recipe.  Had I used instant rice I could have had dinner on the table in 15 minutes.

I thought the flavor combination of the sauce sounded delicious but had some leftover cooked pork roast to use.  So I made the sauce (with the addition of some garlic & ginger) as called for, and then added the shredded pork and some green onion.  I served that over Garlic Baked Potatoes (recipe from this site) and finished the meal with Cornstarch Chocolate Pudding (also from this site).  It was great.

Very flavorful recipe.  Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce and pored the extra over roasted, herbed potatoes and steamed veggies.  Mmmm.

I made this last night with boneless pork ribs...I followed the reccomendations and put less soy sauce in-about half a cup to double the o.j.,and doubled the brown sugar. I sliced the pork into strips cooked it and set it aside. Then I made the sauce. After taste testing it my husband and I felt someting was missing so I put about 2 tsp. of worstechire sauce in the pan and that did the trick! Will make again for the mother in law but as per husbands request I'll slice some onion very thin and add that and maybe try it over some rice noodles instead of rice.

Nothing special, but pretty good. I doubled the sauce mixture, and threw in some frozen broccoli while the sauce thickened. My boyfriend hates most veggies, but ate the broccoli, so you can probably get your kids to eat some vegetables this way :)

Followed the recipe exactly. The first time I tasted it I thought it was salty. My husband wasn't home yet so I let it cook on the stove. When we finally ate I didn't think it was quite as salty. This recipe doesn't really give cooking times. It was easy, tasty & I had all of the ingredients. Thanks!

I followed suggestions from other reviewers--doubled the orange juice, halved the soy sauce and used brown sugar.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Sauce was great; I think I'll try it with chicken.

EXCELLENT! I also used brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and I cut the soy sauce in half and replaced the lost soy sauce with orange juice. The sauce was very good and not too salty like some reviews say it was.  NO COMPLAINTS!

My family all loved this.  We didn't have enough soya sauce to put in as much as the recipe called for, so that may be why we didn't have any problems with that - but we did use about 3/4 of the amount it suggested.  I have tried pork chops with brown sugar and found that I personally liked the white sugar better, though my husband said brown sugar is better so it appears to be a totally individual thing.

Sorry, my husband and I didn't care for this at all. Soy sauce taste was too overpowering. Even cutting back on the soy sauce, using brown instead of white sugar, adding garlic and ginger and adding broccoli couldn't save it.

i made this with chicken since i don't like pork. I used thigh meat, coated in flour. It was good, but not amazing. I also used more orange juice than shoyu like some users suggested.

This was wonderful.  I doubled the sauce and I cut the pork into long thin strips.  I served over rice and the whole family loved it!!  Thanks
