I was skeptical of this recipe, but had only a small amount of drippings, so in desperation gave it a try.  To my delighted surprise it turned out great. Not bland as I had feared.  I like salty gravy, but this was a little too salty, possibly due to the seasonings on my turkey.  Will start with one bouillon cube next time and add the second if needed.

I have made this twice now, once for Thanksgiving and once for Christmas. It turned out perfect on Thanksgiving, but a little runny on Christmas. I think it was my fault though because I was too busy multitasking. The flavor is extremely rich and amazing.

I had enough drippings for half a cup, but still used 1/4 cup flour and instead of water, used chicken broth and it was great.  Will definitely save this recipe for the future.

Woohoo!!!  This recipe saved my dinner at the last minute!  We stayed too long at church and my turkey breast was over-cooked and dry.  I only had exactly 1/4 cup of drippings and found this recipe.  Not only was it great because I had all the simple ingredients on hand, but it was easy enough that I was able to make it gluten free by substituting the flour and bouillon for gluten free options.  Thanks for sharing!

This gravy saved our Thanksgiving!  We forgot the gravy and made some last minute.  We didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it was a great guide.  We used veggie stock instead of water and bouillon, the dripping, and a can of cream of chicken soup.  It was perfect!

Really good gravy!  I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon cubes.  Nice and easy.  I added a little bit of fresh cracked pepper.

Fantastic! I had never made gravy before and this recipe seemed easy enough.  It turned a fantastic color and had a wonderful flavor, it was a huge hit on the dinner the table.  The only change i made was instead of using bouillon I used the turkey stock I made from boiling off the gizzards(livers excluded).  I would definitely make this again.

Been using this for two years now. Quick and easy after all the other work you've done. This year my mother in-law asked me to bring packaged gravy mix. And of course with getting everyone ready and taking things I had prepared for our feast i forgot the packages. Then I remember the recipe that I made along with my thanksgiving dinner last year. Had gravy in minutes. Quick easy and homemade not packaged. Use more drippings for better flavor.

The easiest gravy I ever made.  I doubled the recipe.  It came out smooth and tasted great.  I cooked the turkey and gravy the day before, reheating the gravy in the microwave and it was as good as day one.  This will remain my go to recipe.

Super easy. I added flour to a cup of drippings, whisked, and added a can of chicken broth, slowly whisking. Cooked while whisking for about five minutes. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

I don't know why I had trouble with this recipe except the amounts don't seem right. I heated up the turkey drippings and flour and it just clumped into a thick ball. I had to add about 3X as much of the turkey drippings/liquid to get it to at least be a paste consistency. Then, after 5 minutes, on only medium temperature, the paste started browning to the pot. I ended up having to take it off the burner and add the broth and whisk it quickly. It didn't thicken up that much, and I ended up adding some cornstarch and then more turkey liquid to get it a browner color. After all of that, the taste was great. However, it took re-making the entire recipe. Per other recipes, on the site, I added a pinch or two of celery salt, black pepper, and poultry seasoning. I really enjoyed it with the meal, but the recipe was just off for me as is. The only change I made was using turkey stock that I had made. The recipe, at least got me started on the gravy anyway.

A little too salty for my taste, but maybe my turkey drippings had more salt. Will cut out one of the boullion cubes next time.

Not that good...but I never have good luck with making gravy.  I followed the instructions exactly and it tasted floury and was runny.  I had a jar of chicken gravy in the cupboard so I cheated and added that to the mix and that saved the day!

I can't imagine why anyone would give this a bad rating, its been my go to gravy recipe for years and everyone  always raves about it. The only thing I do differently is using chicken broth instead of water with bullion cubes.

Pretty tasty recipe for gravy, the only change I think I would make is to use the bouillon powder instead of the cubes.  I hate waiting for the cubes to dissolve.

The initial flour with drippings dried up pretty quickly but I managed to save it. And two bullion cubes was a bit too much for my taste but my family definitely enjoyed it nonetheless.

Okay so the recipe called for bouillon cubes. We had stock leftover from the gizzards we boiled for the stuffing so we used that instead of the water and bouillon cubes. 
We also added some of the giblets chopped up while it was simmering and it came out very well. 
Will definitely be saving this for Christmas and other gravy nights.

Not the best gravy ever, but in terms of time and cost efficiency, it wouldn't be fair to give this recipe less than four stars.

Super easy and delicious- especially for a first time gravy maker.  Only modification was that I used HALF of ONE bouillion cube...any more and it would have been way too salty.

I read several recipes looking for a great turkey gravy and I settled on this one. It was amazing. I followed this easy recipe and it came out perfect. I find that sometimes the simplest things turn out the best. Two thumbs up for this recipe.

I just made this today for the first time. Didn't have bullion or corn starch that my Aunt's have used. I winged it totally,used flour, salt and pepper, giblets and water to get the consistency I wanted, and got kudos. For making it and it turning out just right! Nobody knew how and I sort of did thanks to my Aunt's...which I called,and the rest is history.

I used 2 cups of turkey drippings, as I had lots. I did use 1/4 cup of the flour, plus another 1/8 cup. I added 1 tsp. of knorr chicken bouillon, that was it.  When you add the flour with the drippings make sure it is not to hot or it will clump. Just whisk it together as mentioned. I did not wait for my gravy to turn brown just had it simmer, while mixing. It did thicken quite well, and was brown from the get go due to the merlot I guess.I made a very tasty turkey thus the gravy recipe was perfect. I brined my turkey for 12 hours then used a whole bottle of Merlot during the entire baking time, I even injected the legs and breast meat with the wine.

Worked well, but quite modified. I used way more drippings though. Must have been two cups. I just used them all. Added a tablespoon of tomato paste and one of fig jam a few minutes before adding the water. Very tasty, and easy.
