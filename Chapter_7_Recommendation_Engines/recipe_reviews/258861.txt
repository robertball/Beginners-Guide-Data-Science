So delicious, you'd never know there were so few ingredients! Simple to make too. The fontina adds a nice smoky and creamy flavor. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to season the chicken with a bit of salt (and maybe some garlic powder too) in addition to the pepper.  The bites that I had that were mostly chicken were a little bland, which a few shakes of salt fixed. I served this over mashed cauliflower for the perfect low-carb/keto meal.  I will definitely make this again!
