I made some changes to this recipe because I didn't have an onion.  I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard, a teaspoon of lemon juice, half a teaspoon of black pepper, two tablespoons of sour cream, and a dash of tabasco.  The patties came out delicious, and I am giving this recipe five stars because it provides a great base that you can personalize to your taste.

These hit the spot!  I've been craving salmon patties so I guess I must need the omega 3's.  I looked in some old cookbooks and salmon cans used to be 16 ounces then, 15 something, and now they're 14 something.  (Trivia!)

I loved the reviews, and joined this web site to do this one!  This is my first review, woo hoo! I implemented the sour cream and garlic salt suggestion.  I also added a little lemon pepper. I ended up adding another egg and some more bread crumbs to make them stick together better.  My bread crumbs were the "Italian Style" seasoned kind "Vigo" is the brand name with Romano cheese!  Mmmmm I buy the honking huge container from Sams club. 

My batch made six hamburger size patties and I first tried frying them with a few squirts of Pam.  They got too brown before they got done all the way through = no good.  The next batch I fried in about a quarter inch of corn oil and they turned out great!  Well of course, because they were more fattening!  I drained them on paper towels and served them with cocktail sauce.  My husband said that his mother used to make them smaller and thinner (Hint hint!).  She was the best cook ever and as a wedding present she taught me how to make real biscuits and gravy.  (May she rest in peace.)  Anyway, next time I'll make 12 smaller thinner patties with the same recipe.

This recipe is so easy and quick to make.  My nine year old daughter even likes this.  She did like it better when I made it with cracker crumbs rather than bread crumbs.  If you're not a fish person (I'm definitely not), I'd suggest you buy the salmon that comes in a tuna-sized 3 oz. can.  I bought "traditional" salmon in a big can and was grossed out by it.  It literally looked like a salmon had been cut down to size and stuffed in a can, skin, bones and all.  I threw it away and couldn't bring myself to eat it. The little cans are boneless/skinless and look like the tuna I'm used to seeing.

Very good and easy.  I added about 1 tsp of Old Bay and some fresh grated garlic.  Made a dipping sauce of 1 cup sour cream, about 1 T of lemon juice and 1 tsp dill weed.  (Adjust measurements to your taste.)  Everyone in the family loved these.  Can't wait to make them. again.

I honestly have not made this particular recipe, but with one exception, it has all the same ingredients as my mom's salmon patties and we all just love them.  

The one exception is that we use crushed saltine crackers for the bread crumbs.  It adds a lot of good flavor.

Another suggestion - mom always served hers with a sauce made from a can of cream of mushroom soup, thinned with about a quarter cup of milk.  She then diced one or two hard boiled eggs and stirred them into the sauce.  I'm so used to having this sauce that I won't make the patties now if I don't have cream of mushroom soup in the house!

Try using very fine bread crumbs called Panko.  It is in the Asian aisle.  I don't know what makes this brown so evenly but it does if you do not heat the oil too hot.  Use Canola oil heated slowly and fry at medium heat.  Also, shred yellow squash & zuchini to the mixture.  Red pepper chopped adds color.  I served with wasabi mayo.  Wasabi is traditionally hot but added to mayo keeps it tame.  Some Asian markets sell there own version.  I prefer to make into rounded balls I think because it cooks so evenly and quicker than a patty.

I went the Pam route on this recipe in a non-stick pan and had absolutely no trouble with it. The patties browned and did not stick. I adjusted the recipe for health's sake using eggbeaters, and whole wheat bread crumbs with my own seasoning, and a little parsley. Very tasty and easy.

This is a really great simple recipe.  Was able to make it quickly on a weeknight and enjoy a homecooked meal like grandma used to make (only grandma used to use matzoh meal instead of bread crumbs).  I used green onions and added fresh dill, salt and pepper.  Served with tartar sauce and Russian dressing.

Very good recipe, serves as a great base. I like to zip mine up a bit by adding ground cayenne pepper and some minced garlic. I also dropped in a tbl of mayo.  The leftovers were great  used in a sandwich the next day.  Will definately make again.

I gave this 5 stars because it is a wonderful basic recipe from which to customize your own version.  My recipe: 3 small cans salmon, 2 medium eggs, 1/2c bread crumbs, 0.5oz shredded parmesan, 1tsp Old Bay, 1tbsp Texas Pete, a dash of white pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Formed into 6 moderately sized patties and baked at 375 for 20 minutes - came out wonderfully!  My boyfriend said they could even compete with his Grandma's salmon patties, and THAT is saying something!  I wouldn't change a thing next time except to spray the pan with Pam (parmesan made them stick a bit).  Just moist enough but not overly juicy.  Delicious!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have all the ingredients for the salmon patties I normally make, so I went in search of a new recipe. I found this one, and boy am I glad I did! I added garlic powder, parsley, sea salt and old bay seasoning to the mix. I doubled the recipe to feed my crew and thought the mixture was a bit dry and crumbly, so I added another egg. The patties turned out perfect! I served with a homemade tarter sauce made of light mayo, horseradish, dill pickle relish, diced onion, hot sauce, lemon juice, parsley and a pinch of sugar. My husband and kids told me these were the best salmon patties I had made....music to my ears! These were so simple, yet full of flavor. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

I had misplaced my Salmon recipe I used many times in the past and loved. In the process of making this recipe, I needed to use all the liquid in the can to get it moist enough and then remembered this recipe was almost the exact recipe I used to have (found it on a can of salmon way back when). This was short on the second egg. Two eggs makes this recipe have a perfect moisture level. I always double this recipe and have it for a couple of days and freeze the left overs as I always use the large canned Salmon and it is indeed messy, but, worth it. I tend to like to crush the bones and use them in the patties (can't even tell it's there).  They are wonderfully full of calcium and highly recommended by nutritionists.

I agree with other that this is a fantastic basic recipe for Salmon patties! I followed the recipe, but chopped up 1/4 cup green pepper with my onion (used red) and sauteed in olive oil with garlic until tender. Then I let it cool and added to the salmon mixture. Hubby went back for 2nds and I had to fight him for the last piece! Will certainly be using this again!

MAN, these were excellent!!!  I followed the advice of the most helpful review and used 2 tablespoons of sour cream and Louisiana hot sauce.  Used Italian flavored bread crumbs.  I also seasoned the canned salmon with onion powder, garlic powder and Tony Chachere's to taste.  Next time, I'll also add a little Old Bay and Chef Prudhomme's salmon seasoning to see if that enhances the flavor even more.  Best salmon patties I've EVER made.

This recipe is a lot of fun to play with and adjust until it's just perfect for your tastes. It is, however, a very tasty recipe just the way it is, with no adjustments necessary. I make this all the time for my picky husband, he loves it. I found that one egg was enough when using the liquid from the salmon tin, (or the same amount of milk if you want it less fishy). The only advice I do want to give on this recipe is: mix together the salmon, breadcrumbs, onions, egg and whatever liquids and spices you want to use, and leave it in the refrigerator for at least a few hours before frying. I've found that the longer I leave it (even for a few days, sometimes), the tastier the finished patties are!

These were pretty tasty.  Before frying, I coated them with Panko bread crumbs which gave them a crispy coating.  I'll be making these again!

I doubled the recipe and used 3 eggs instead of two.  I also used three 10 oz. cans of salmon from Sam's Club because they don't have those annoying bony bits.  This recipe was simple and delicious.

Loved this recipe.  The only thing I added was a bit of lemon pepper.  Served creamed peas over the patties.  I've made this same recipe (without the cream sauce) with canned tuna...makes a great sandwich with a slice of onion, dill pickle chips and wasabi mayo.

If I'm being honest, I gagged when I first opened a can of salmon. It looked terrible. I went ahead with the recipe anyway. It was pretty darn good.
I used egg white instead of a whole egg. I also used cooking spray instead of olive oil. It turned out great. I like to pour Pace Picante sauce over mine. It compliments the recipe nicely.

I make these often but have deviated a bit.  I add crushed 1/2 of a pack of whole grain crackers, 1\4 tsp old bay seasoning, tsp. fat free sour cream, tsp. dijon mustard, lemon juice and an egg or egg substitue.  All the above can be tailored to tast.  Roll into large meatball size then pat down.  Then fry or bake

I love Salmon patties and make them often. My problem with a few of these recipe's is they are being overcooked. The only thing in the recipe's that needs cooked, is the egg. This takes only low heat, and not too long. Canned salmon is fully cooked, like tuna, and can be eaten straight out of the can.
Stir your patty mixture gently, and gently place by tablespoonfuls in a pam/buttered heavy skillet which is medium hot. You may also mold your patties with fingertips, but don't "squash". Gently flatten with your spoon, and continue to fill your pan. Do not turn until lightly brown, then turn, wait 1 minute, then turn the pan off. Let set for a minute, then move to your serving dish. At no time should your salmon be squashed or pressed! For a prettier salmon, remove darker outer salmon skin, add 1 tablespoon of catsup,for a "pink" patty, fresh parsley, and a heaping tsp. of flour. If dry, add more catsup,or milk, not the liquid from the can. You'll like the difference.

These were fantastic!! I added 1/4 cup chopped onion, 2 tbsp lite sour cream, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp honey dijon mustard. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, and let the patties sit in the fridge for about 20 minutes before cooking them. My husband and I gobbled them up.

I follow the recipe as stated, but I do "roll" the patties in panko (Japanese bread crumbs) before I cook them.  It gives them an extra crisp - love it!

I baked these in muffin tins, the way my Mom does.  She lines sides of each cup with a piece of bacon -- very delicious, but sort of defeats the purpose of baking them, instead of frying!

This is a great recipe!  My only alterations to it was to chop up 1 rib of celery and add 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  It's a hit with my husband, and anything that is a hit with him must be great, as he has an eclectic palate.  LOL!

This is a great basic salmon patty! And that comes from a *beef* eater! Yes, as many reviewers have said, one might care to add lots of things to it and pour a myriad of sauces over it, but it still remains a great basic salmon patty! I did pre-sauté the onions, as some of us don't care for strong raw onion flavor, but that's the only real change I made. I didn't have to add back any of the juice (or any milk as at least one reviewer suggested) to make the patties come together. I made 4 patties instead of 5, coated 2 of them with Panko and left the other 2 bare. They fried up perfectly in about 4 minutes per side. I did enjoy the crisper crust of the Panko-coated patty more so than the non-Panko-coated patty, but understand that some sauces may negate that crispiness anyway. If you have yet to give salmon patties a try, this is a really good starter recipe. Thanks, Sue!

I only had a 7oz can, so i cut everything in half. I added 3 pinches of Lemon Pepper seasoning, 1 1/2 tablespoons of Sour Cream, used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and used some drops of the reserve liquid. These came out great, made 3 pattys because my dad was the only one eating them. He said they were as good as his mom used to make them which is a complement because his mom was the best cook, and my dad has tried tons of salmon recipies scence his mom died and hasent liked any until this one. Thank you!!

The bread crumbs make this recipe. So good!  Next time, I'll follow the reviewer who used Pam instead of olive oil.  I ended up having little burnt bits in the oil smoking up the kitchen.

Love recipe. I added lemon juice as another reviewer mentioned. Also added 1 tsp dill weed. Made 4 large patties.  I slowly added the rest of the broth from the drained salmon into the frying pan as the tablespoon of olive oil didn't seem to be enough to finsh cooking the patties. Delicious!

I had to give this only a 2 as it is  because it was so very dry and unable to form a patty, even after adding the liquid from the can.  I added an extra egg and some egg substitute to make about a total of 2 1/2 eggs and it was much better.  If I were rating it then, I would rate it a 4, but I am rating the recipe as it is. If you make it, you may need to add the extra eggt also.

great basic recipe that you can eat as is or add on to it! I love adding minced or chopped peppers to the mix for a pop of color. For a healthier option you can use oats in the place of breadcrumbs, or as a partial replacement.

After heeding multiple reviewer's suggestions, this was an all star dish!  I added 2 eggs instead of 1, added green onions, crushed garlic, black pepper, some old bay seasoning, a squeeze of lemon, and a few dashes of Tabasco.  They were delicious!!  I also followed a previous recommendation to serve with dipping sauce of sour cream, dill, and lemon.  Absolutely fantastic dinner!  My husband is still raving, hours later. :-)

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I added "It's a Dilly" spice  to the mixture and they came out wonderful.  I also added just a bit more onion (about 1/2 a medium size onion).  This is a recipe that is easy, quick, and delicious.

This is the best basic recipe I've found for canned salmon patties. They're a hit with my family every time! We like them made with crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.

Like many other people said, this is a fantastic base recipe that you can modify any way you'd like.  I used boneless skinless salmon (4 3oz cans), and added garlic, celery, dill, plain breadcrumbs, and Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning.  I served them over a bed of spinach with a Greek yogurt/sour cream sauce mix with dill, lemon zest, and garlic.  It was SO, SO good.  Crazy good.  Definitely will be adding this to a normal rotation.  Thanks for the inspiration!!

We really liked these. I added the liquid from the can, and some paprika, 1 t lemon juice, and 1 T mayo. I didn't have an onion so I used minced dried onion.  I fried the patties, then added a slice of cheese, put in on a toasted bun, then spread some mayo/lemon juice mix and some salsa on top. With the additions, it was really yummy!

Delicious! So simple yet so good. The only change I made was to use plain bread crumbs and add salmon grilling seasoning. I won't use canned salmon any other way now!

I remember my grandmother making this recipe when I was a child. The dish was called salmon croquettes and it was delicious. I made a minor change to the recipe by substituting flour seasoned with salt and black pepper for the seasoned bread crumbs, just like my grandmother use to make them.

This recipe provides a nice base recipe that you can make "as is" but would also be easy to add to and change up over and over (the sky's the limit). The cooking method was perfect, patties came out brown on outside and warm/soft on inside. Leftovers were a big hit with my husband who likes to just grab something out of the fridge to snack on. He would just grab one and eat it like a cookie (cold and all). I will definitely make these again.
Oh; I did add an extra egg, I try to stick to the recipe exactly the first time but I felt the extra egg necessary to keep the patties from falling apart.

Delish!! Made as written and came out wonderful. Only thing is, I don't understand so many people don't like the large cans because of the bones. Just crumble them up into the meat since they are so soft. CALCIUM!

I have been making these for years.  I made a few minor changes, use saltine crackers crushed up, add 2 teaspoons baking powder, gives them some volume, and some lemon juice to taste. Great receipe, family loves them.

I used Saltine crumbs as recommended by other reviewers (and because this was the childhood memory of the person requesting these).  I appreciate the reviewer that said to buy the small cans to avoid bones and skin.  Thank you!  I did that and it was so easy...without the unpleasant task of dealing with skin and bones.  My husband loved these.  They came out very well.  He was pleased that they did not have a 'fishy' taste.

They were good.  I added Old Bay seasoning as suggested and a bit of garlic powder, but still thought something was missing.

These were very good. I used freeze-dried red onion instead of fresh to save time, and threw in some garlic powder and Vidalia Onion salad dressing. The only problem was that a few of them fell apart when being cooked. I will make it again though.

My family LOVED this!  This is a great base recipe. After reading the reviews, I changed some things.  First, I put the salmon and a medium onion and put them in the food processor.  I kept some of the liquid and needed only one egg.  I used organic torilla crumbs, salt, and pepper.  Then we cooked it on our George Foreman Grill.  This will be a regular on our dinner table!

Great basic recipe, and a tasty and easy way to add fish to your diet!  We have tried several additions to add some stronger flavor - our favorite is to add 1 tsp of crushed red pepper, which gives it a kick!

I liked this recipe a lot.  I added garlic powder and pepper.  The patties were full of flavor.  Mine fell apart some so my mom said I should use a little flour next time.  They still had a great taste!  Thanks.

I used leftover, fresh salmon from last night's dinner.  I will saute the onions first next time because of the stron raw-onion taste.  Other than that, excellent!

Fantastic!  Modified as some have said by adding 1 t. dijon mustard; 1/2 t. lemon peel; 1/2 t. pepper; 2 T soucr cream; 2 T light mayo; and a dash of hot sauce.  Added milk to moisten.  The kids loved it!  I used left over salmon instead of canned.

This was pretty good but noting spectacular. I was a little nervous I wouldn't like it since I like salmon but only when I make it 1 certain way, but I wanted a change & I like crab cakes so tried this!
I will admit I couldn't tell it was salmon & it was pretty good though! I used a big can that I had to pick through the bones & skin. I made as written but added some 1 tsp old bay seasoning, 1 tsp lemon juice, a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, some pepper & fresh garlic. I was at a loss for a dipping sauce so we dipped them in honey mustard.....interesting but not bad, need to find a better sauce though to really enjoy these. But thats not the recipes fault!

This was a good starter recipe.  I added a little dill, a heaping tablespoon mayo and some fresh garlic.  I found if you refrigerate them for a while before frying they hold together better.

Makes a pretty delicious appetizer with green onion, shredded cheddar and dill added. Press a tablespoon or so of mixture into lightly greased mini muffin cups and bake at 350 until just golden brown. Also wonderful served with hot cream of shrimp soup with sour cream added as a dip!

I have used this basic recipe for years.  Try adding  fresh dill, parsley & celery. After making patties, cover w/ bread crumbs or crushed ritz crackers, place on wax paper & chill in freezer for at least 1/2 hour, so crumbs adhere before frying or baking.

Doubled the chopped onions, added 1/2c chopped yellow pepper, 1/2t McCormick Grillmates Salmon seasoning and an additional egg. No prepared bread crumbs on hand so used crushed crackers.  Served on a bun with mayo and pesto. The basil pesto video on this site is worth watching.

I added the Old Bay Seasoning & minced garlic, lemon juice, black pepper and a Tbs of mayo...excellent!  Easy! You can certainly adjust ingredients to your taste.  Fried in veg oil as someone else suggested and they came out crispy brown on the outside & moist inside. I will make this again!

An excellent recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. My father practically licked his plate! They did fall apart, but that's only because I over flip. I served them with "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" submitted by BABSKITCHEN.

These were very tasty! Mine had a tendency to fall apart, though, so next time I'll use two eggs. I added Old Bay to part of the mix and I liked the little kick. Also, the sour cream/lemon/dill sauce that another user suggested was EXCELLENT with these. Highly recommended. Here's a suggestion: when forming the patties, mold them against a flat surface. This helps them hold their shape when you put them in the pan. If you shape them in your hand only they will be curved and want to fall apart once they hit the flat surface of the pan. I will definately make these again!

I think these salmon patties would have been better if the directions said to saute the onions first.  The cakes fried up well, turned golden brown, BUT....there were lots of little bits of raw uncooked crunchy onion pieces throughout the interior of the patties.   I also think that I should have added some salt and pepper to them because the flavor was lacking (and I even used seasoned breadcrumbs).  All in all, these do not taste as fantastic as I had anticipated--the reviews made them seem wonderful.

So much fun to customize this great basic recipe. I often use Asian seasonings - 1/2-1 T. grated ginger, 1-2 tsp. fresh chopped garlic, 1/4 c. fresh cilantro, thai chile paste or wasabi (to taste). Other times I add dill (dry or fresh), dijon mustard, dill relish, or Old Bay seasoning. Sometimes I add 1/2 a cup or so of cooked frozen chopped spinach. You can really dress these up any way you'd like. Really delicious served with wilted leafy greens (kale, swiss chard, and spinach) with some Greek tzatziki sauce on the side!

I loved this recipe, it was quick, easy, very tasty, and suprised my wife!!! I gave it 5/5 Stars. 

I am still improving my cooking skills and I learned a couple of things with this. . .

1)The only other ingredient in the can of Salmon I used (it was Starkist) was salt and there was plenty of it, so be careful with the seasoning you add. Some other reviewers gave some suggestions that sound good.

2)This recipe recommends using the drained liquid to moisten the mixtures if needed to get them to form into patties. Make sure you need it before you add it, I added it before I checked and ended up needing more bread crumbs to fix my mistake.

This is a great basic salmon patty recipe.  My husband prefers tuna patties, and you can certainly substitute tuna if that is what you have on hand.  Don't be afraid to season these to your own personal taste.  Hot sauce in the mix is good, as is Old Bay Seasoning.

There were probably as good as any salmon patties I've ever had.  I admit that we're not salmon/crab patty lovers but I had some left over bbq salmon and was trying to find something to do with it.  These were tasty but I think I might add a bit more onion for flavor next time and perhaps some salt and pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never liked salmon, canned or fresh, but thought I'd try the salmon that you can now buy in the pouch with this recipe (of course, I had to use two pouches). I added 1/2 tsp dill seed to the recipe and did NOT have to add any liquid. I just kept my hands wet while making the patties. They held together and tasted wonderful! At last, a salmon recipe I can live with.  I will definitely make these again. Thanks Sue!

This was quick and easy, but the patties did not hold. No one liked the taste, it was really bland. I would definately either doctor it up, or try another recipie.

An excellent base recipe. My son loves to cook (11yo) and looks for a base recipe that he can personalize. He added salt pepper, garlic powder, dill and extra breadcrumbs for texture and patty- formation. He grilled some slider buns in the pan, it was salmon sliders for dinner!

This has been my go to recipe for salmon patties for years. Absolutely love them.  Sometimes I do like to add a little Old Bay.

Loved this recipe. So easy and tasty. Shared with two of my friends who both made it and thought it was good. made a sort of sauce of Greek yogurt, lemon and dill to serve with it and some rice. Definitely going into my meal rotation.

I'm not a measured but I grated some of the onion then chopped the rest. I probably used 3/4 onion. I used a little old bay seasoning, parsley, cilantro, dry mustard and I put chopped sweet gherkins in half of the mixture to try it out (someone has it and cheese in another recipe. I didn't use the cheese). I also used the egg and some panko  breadcrumbs but I didn't measure that either.  It came out really good and I liked both with and without the pickles. I didn't think I would like it but I did.  I made a sauce with mayo,wasabi oil (only a very little)and a tiny ketchup and another one with ketchup and banana ketchup (or sauce). Very good!

It was very good!  I save 5 stars for the spectacular but definitely this on "the list" and will make again.  Quite easy.  I took Cheryltom's hint and added a bit of Old Bay.  Also a little granulated garlic, salt & pepper.  Only had corn oil.

Will make this again! When I first announced I had bought canned salmon the family was less than thrilled. I found this recipe and took the suggestions of others. I used green onions instead of regular onions, added lemon juice, minced garlic, and old bay seasoning. It was a huge success and the family actually wants me to make it a regular in our menu.

Two thumbs up. Sautéed onions and garlic. Cool and added to mixture with a tablespoon of sour cream. 
Covered salmon patties with bread crumb. Made dipping sauce with mayo and wasabi. 
Served with rice pilaf.  Will definitely make again.

I used the basic recipe and went from there with suggestions from reviewers.  I used 2 pouches of Pillar Point pink salmon--14 Ounces total.  I also added another egg, used 2 TB. lemon juice, some chopped red onion, chopped red and yellow mini peppers, some dill in a tube, sprinkling of cayenne, smoked sweet paprika, Tbs. of Dijon and 1/2 C. seasoned breadcrumbs. I used a nonstick griddle pan with just a bit of spray.  Turned out great-  Incidentally for those who think that those bones in the can are bad--they are not--they have been through the canning process and are totally  edible and good source of calcium.

I made a few changes to the recipe. I added an extra egg because it was so dry, and used a little less breadcrumbs than called for. I'm not a fan of onions, and replaced them with chopped cucumber for that crunch factor. Overall, this was a great way to use up some canned salmon I had on hand. I will definitely make this again!

This was my first attempt at a Salmon Pattie.  I thought the recipe was simple and easy.  I also like that I can add seasoning if I want to tweak it a bit.  Since I was making it just for me, I used a 5 oz can and one egg white (my attempt to keep the ratio about right).  I'm not sure what that may have done to the final product, but I was very happy.  This is going in my regular rotation.  Thank you!

These were pretty good - I used unseasoned bread crumbs and also added fresh parsley, lemon pepper, and teriyaki sauce. The teriyaki sauce helped the patties stick together. I will definitely make these again.

I made these for the first time after wanting to try them for a long time!

What I did differently was add dry green onion, cayenne pepper, red onion, about 6 cloves of garlic minced, omitted the italian crumbs and seasoning, used garlic bread crumbs, tbls of mayo and a squirt of mustard. Oh don't forget some brown sugar! I just eyeballed everything.

These tasted really good, almost as if i've had it as a base for a crab cake somewhere. I just have to figure out how to cut some of the salt and they should be better next time. A remoulade sauce would go perfectly with these.

The only downfall of making these was the fact that the salmon was stuffed into the can with it's spine and all. It was actually kinda gross, but not really at the same time. It was fun to make these!

These were very good! My whole family enjoyed them.   I did not have seasoned bread crumbs, so I seasoned my plain panko crumbs wtih garlic, salt, pepper, and oregeno.  Will definitely make again.

Awesome!  These are really good.  I followed the recipe exactly and I added these based on the reviews: 1 tablespoon of hot sauce, 1 tablespoon of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of mustard, and green onions instead of white.  One of the patties fell apart slight when frying, so next time I plan on baking them.  I served them with fresh seasonal asparagus.

My friends and I thought these were delicious at supper last night however I added another egg, used whole wheat bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp dill weed, a dash of old bay, 1/2 tsp paprika and a pinch of sea salt. Otherwise the recipe was as is.  The ladies all requested the recipe.  I will definitely be making them again,  soon.

I'd never had salmon patties before this recipe so I had nothing to compare to but I really did not enjoy them one bit.  My boyfriend thought they were alright so I'm giving it three stars.  The only changes we made were to add a little black pepper and garlic powder. If we try these again we will have to make a lot of changes, starting with reducing the onion, possibly adding another egg and using a smoked salmon fillet instead of canned.  The canned salmon is the biggest downfall of this recipe in my opinion.

These were just okay.  They were missing some of the seasoning and crunch they I remember from salmon patties as a child

Yum! Used leftover cooked fresh Alaska silver salmon. Added 1 tsp dijon, pinch onion powder (instead of onions), splash of lemon juice, dash of old bay & black pepper. Rolled patties in crushed saltines. Kids loved em!

I had about 2 cups or more of leftover baked salmon so I decided to try this. I am not a very creative cook, so I took alot of people suggetions, and this was great. I didnt have bread crumbs or saltines, so I used crushed corn flakes. I added 2 eggs, garlic salt, lemon pepper, sour cream, lemon juice, soy sauce and onion. I cooked them in olive oil. They kind of fell apart, so maybe I need to cut down on the liquid next time?? Delicious!!

Very good, basic recipe.  I used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and canola oil instead of olive oil, but mostly because that is what I had on hand (and I remember my mom using crackers in her salmon patties.)

I added a lot of herbs/seasonings to make them tasty. I had to use a lot of bread crumbs to hold pattys together. I made a lemon/dill sour cream sauce to go with these. This recipe os OKAY, but i bit of a greasy pain. I don't think I am going to make these again. I am unimpressed.

I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 cup of saltines instead of bread crumbs like my granny did.  These were very good and my 3 and 2 year old gobbled it up!

This was a great recipes.  I agree that it is a good starter recipe to then add your favorites.  I added 2 tbls of Miracle Whip, lemon juice, parm cheese and fresh garlic.  I called it crabby patties and my kids eat it up!  Told them it made their brains bigger/smarter.  I do whatever it takes!

Perfect recipe.  My husband was brought back to his childhood with this recipe.  And I expected it to be messy and falling apart, but not at all.  It was very easy.  I think I may add a little bit of green pepper next time, because that's how my mom used to make them.  Thanks!

Delicious and so easy to make with ingredients always in the house. I made a few changes, I added pepper to balance out the saltiness from the salmon and I used the drained water instead of an egg and I baked it to reduce the fat and it came out great. I will definitely make this again.

This is very similar to an old favorite that my mom made quite a bit. The only thing I would add to this is throw in a bunch of dried dill to the salmon (dried dill and salmon is a fabulous mix) and also pour on a can on cream of mushroom soup !

Like other reviewers, I thought this was an excellent base recipe.  I bought smaller cans of salmon, so I would not have to deal with bones or skin (gross!).  I tweaked the recipe based on a couple of suggestions from other reviewers: I used saltine cracker crumbs in place of bread crumbs.  I add a little milk to hold the mixture together better (and didn't get all the liquid out of the can, while draining). I added onion powder, instead of onions; Old Bay Seasoning and some dill.  I would like to try it again adding the Dijon mustard.  I wanted to do that and simply forgot until after I made the patties. They tasted great! My only complaint was that my house is a little stinky after making these.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  Thank you so much for this recipe - and for everyone else who gave suggestions on how to liven it up a bit.  Everyone cleaned their plates, and my toddler who has been going through a phase of only eating toast and cucumber for the past few weeks ASKED for more!  As others suggested, I sauteed about 1/4 of an onion in some olive oil, then added it to the salmon & breadcrumbs, along with non-fat sour cream, stoneground mustard, lemon juice, and a bit of the reserved water from the canned salmon.  Served with small whole wheat rolls and a green salad.  Thank you for a GREAT, easy, family friendly recipe!!

Wonderful! Totally enjoyed the patties. Though my husband and I ate all of the recipe for one meal. Changes made added 1t Old Bay, then sprinkled with paprika after first turn. Served with the dipping sauce another reviewer recommended. Will keep this recipe for future use!!

These were great!  I added some Seasoning Salt and Cayenne pepper for extra spice and they fried up nice and crisp on the outside, tender on the inside.  (I used an electric frying pan set at about 375)

Pretty good. Great way to get in servings of fish if you're not crazy about fish (I'm pregnant). Change it up how you want. This is a really flexible recipe. The panko breadcrumbs were a great tip. I used half panko and half seasoned.

I followed recipe as written, which is no my usual style.. but even using the italian seasoned bread crumbs, and home canned salmon that I did just last week - this was WAY too bland for my taste!  I will try this again, as a base, and will add some zip & flavor - maybe some mayo, a little cajun spice (or just red pepper flakes) and definitely some garlic.  Good base starting point tho - the patties were firm, but not dry, and the mixture was easily handled.

I made this salmon patties for dinner one day and they turned out great.  I added a little bit of lemon juice, served them with rice and veggies and they were great.  I had some leftover patties and had them in a sandwhich with mayo the next day for lunch.  Good recipe.

My mother used to make these growing up so I crave them once in a while. Instead uf using bread crumbs I use crackers like saltines or ritz to add a little more flavor. Panko is good too if you want a little more crunch!

What I loved most about this recipe is even with the onions it is kid friendly. At least for my kids, and they are VERY picky! They loved them as well as my husband. So easy too, which is great when you want to make a quick meal. I added about a Tablespoon or so of sour cream as one reviewer had suggested and I'm glad I did. I think it made it moister and easier to keep the patties together.

I will say I made quite a few changes but I do feel that this is a great base recipe. I read pretty much every review up to date and was inspired. I did use 2 eggs and I did a mixture of italian seasoned crackers, and buttered round crackers. Nice mix. I chopped up a bit of fresh parsley and loved the addition of old bay. Wow thats alot of changes- but i really did enjoy the additions and plan on making it different each time. The last and tastiest change was coating each cake with panko. Fantastic, the family raved.

This is a good basic recipe to improve upon.  Per other reviewers, I added an extra egg.  I also added a tablespoon of dijon mustard, a few drops of Red Hot hot sauce, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and some salt & pepper.  They turned out so yummy with those alterations!

Tasty. I'm not a big Salmon fan so this recipe was a good way for me to eat it. I added pepper, parsley and italian seasoning. I also dredged in flour before frying. Will make again.

ok, this is the same recipe I've been using for years with a few exceptions.  Instead of adding juice from the salmon if needed, I add a touch of milk.  I know, it sounds weird, but it's what my meemaw did, so I do it.  Also, I use corn flake crumbs.  I make my patties small and as I'm pattying them up, I put shredded cheese in the center  - I use sharp cheddar but you can use whatever you want.  And I fry in olive oil.  Tada!  They are always fabulous and friends that say they don't like salmon patties end up loving mine!

I was also craving salmon patties and these were great! I added green onion instead of onion and hot sauce for some bite, but I think they would've been good with out the changes.  I will definately be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Definitely the best way to have canned salmon!  My picky kids liked it, and so did my husband, who hates canned salmon.  I used butter cracker crumbs in place of dried bread crumbs and added salt and pepper.  This will appear on our menu frequently!

These were very good.  I was actually searching for a tuna recipe and couldn't find one...so I substituted it for the salmon...I left out the onion, because I didn't think it would cook through enough for my taste, but I did add onion powder, garlic powder, a little ranch dressing, and a splash of lemon juice.  I will definatly make again with both tuna and salmon

i used saltines (i didnt have any bread crumbs!) and they turned out delicious!  like another reviewer, my husband didn't compare them to his mom's and that made me very happy since that's his fav. comfort food she makes him.  i didn't have to use any reserve liquid.  the only thing i can't get over is how gross salmon from a can looks.......

This recipe is so good, so easy, and so versatile.  I have now used it many times.  I always keep canned salmon in the cupboard just so I can make this whenever I have the urge.  I usually use the exact recipe as written, but sometimes add a tablespoon of mustard and some fresh parsley or dill if I have it in the house.  I have tried it with crackers as suggested by others, but definitely preferred it made with seasoned bread crumbs.  Thanks for this recipe...it has become a regular in my home!  Oh...and we especially love them cold the next day on a sandwich!

I've made lots of salmon patties and this recipe is the best and easiest!  I used one jar of home canned salmon and all of the liquid.  Also used herb seasoned stuffing for the bread crumbs - crushed with a rolling pin in a ziploc bag.  Good with celery and dill also.

This was a really good and easy recipe for salmon patties.  I did add about a quarter cup of the broth, but i like my patties very moist.  I also put in some adobo seasoning for a little extra flavor.

Thank you for this healthy recipe!  I made it a tad healthier by mixing equal parts bread crumbs and  oats, the latter pulverized in a food processor.  I also used egg substitute.  They were still delicious!

This recipe has been a favorite of our for years. We fast during the Lenten season so this is standard fair for us not only during Lent but all year. Nice easy recipe for any day of the week. Fix American fries and a veggie and you have a complete meal.

Definitely will make it again. I followed the suggestion of adding the sour cream and really thought it made a difference!
Also, I made braised cabbage as a side dish with this and the two really complemented each other

These were so good! I used Parmesan and herb shake and bake as the breadcrumbs and was excited to discover that one packet equals 1/2 cup! I went through the canned salmon with my bare hands and crushed all the bone pieces so they didn't have any crunchy parts and also added 1 tsp of lemon. I served them with homemade guacamole on the top and they were excellent! A definite do-again!

I doubled the recipe and made a few changes...was out of my panko (no corn syrup, Japanese style bread crumbs), so I used fresh bread, toasted it crisp and crumbled it by hand, added 1/2 tsp low sodium seasoned salt, and 2 cloves crushed and pressed garlic...I used extra large store bought eggs (small if you use 'yard eggs'), and went back and added a third egg.  I didn't read carefully, and added the olive oil to the mix, and still needed almost 1/4 cup reserved liquid.
This is the first time I ever got salmon patties to hold together well! They were great! Even better with a little of my homemade yogurt ranch dip and a spritz of dill. 
Hubby said he'd like to have them as salmon burgers with the ranch and a slice of cheese. Plenty left over for lunches the next couple of days.
We will be having these again!

Good basic recipe, but bland to my taste. I added 2 teas of Old Bay, salt and pepper, 1/4th teas garlic, and minced parsley. Used two eggs instead of one as the patties hold together better and cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Lemon wedges on the side.

Followed the recipe for the first few. Went fine but was a bit bland for me and my family. Added some salt, pepper, garlic, and parmesan. After that they were really good.

I used two 7oz cans of Atlantic salmon from Sam's club, ground up two pieces of wheat bread, two eggs, garlic powder, onion flakes, and about a half tablespoon or so of herbs de Provence.  I made them bite sized.  They came out great!  We ate them with Head Country BBQ sauce and bread and butter pickles.  They are also great topped with lemon juice, capers, and a dollop of sour cream.  I could eat these every week :)

I made them for supper tonight. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not terribly flavorful. I should've thought to add some extra ingredients like some of you other cooks! I did make a lemon, mustard, dill cream sauce, however, and that did help. It wasn't at all dry, so other than needing a little more spice to it, it was great and super easy to throw together. I will make again.

Good basic recipe.  Bland -- to my taste.  I added minced hot peppers, lime zest and a squeeze of lime juice.  Sauce (essential) of mayo, yoghurt, minced hot peppers and lime -- YUM.  RAVE REVIEWS from family, friends!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs and added some salt and pepper. Next time will try getting the cans of salmon from Sams Club as suggested by another review. This was my first time using canned salmon. Picking out the bones took forever and was rather disgusting. The recipe itself was very good though. Will make again, that's for sure.

This recipe is very similar to the one I've always used except that I use cornmeal instead of bread crumbs.

This was a midnight snack and was absolutely scrumptious. I added minced garlic, olive oil in the pattie and a little in the cast iron skillet. Instead of using breadcrumbs ( had none) I used chicken fry and bits of Ritz cracker to the mix and then dusted with flour. Yummie!

I don't know why everyone is so worried about using olive or coconut oils.  They are the healthest ones to use.  Other than safflower oil (I use occasionally), they are all I use!  Anyway, great recipe and I like alot of the adaptions.

I loved this recipe! I used craker crumbs because I didn't have bread crumbs. I also added a couple of pinches of salt and a few dashes of Mrs. Dash's salt free Lemon pepper Seasoning. Following another review I made up a cream of mushroom soup and hard boiled egg sauce for the top, yummy. I can't wait however to try this as a sandwich fixing. I'm sure it will be just great. :)

This is my mom's recipe, except she used a small handful of self-rising flour.  She rarely measured anything, but I would guess 1 tablespoon.  I will try some of the other suggestions to change it up a bit for variety.  I have also read that you can freeze these, either before or after cooking.  So they would be great to prepare ahead of time.  We ate these with cane syrup and biscuits, by the way -- just in case you are wanting a REAL southern treat!

Good basic recipe that I gave 3 stars. I made with some adjustments adding green onion tops rather that chopped onion. a pinch of dill, pinch of white pepper and to lean it up some I used egg substitute.  Using pan spray rather than olive oil for cooking. I served with an Asian sweet and spicy sauce over a bed of greens.  Very tasty.

I have attempted these several different times over the years, and ruined them all. These are foolproof and good basic salmon patties I remember from when I was growing up. I do recommend serving with a spicy mayo or something to kick it up a little. But these are very good.

Quick, easy recipe! The patties were pretty delicate to handle but ended up holding their shape in the pan. I had to add a little more liquid while making the patties and did a final dredge in the bread crumbs before frying. Served on a bed of spinach with a corn/bacon combo!

I used the original recipe, but added Old Bay seasoning and fried in vegetable oil. They turned out great! My fiance had never had a salmon patty before and he fell in love with this recipe. Next time I will probably add a little lemon juice.

I made these with fresh salmon and they were really delicious!  They are definitely easy to play with as far as adding ingredients.  I did add some mustard, lemon (love lemon) and sour cream as well.  I couldn't believe how easy they were to make.  A real keeper!

this was a good base recipe. we made it tonight.  it seemed a bit dry even though we added almost all the liquid back in.  we added cavender's and granulated onion instead of real onion, and also shredded some fresh spinach and mixed that in. We served it with sliced green onion on top.  A nice dill sauce over the patties would probably make it excellent.

These were quite yummy! I just added a little bit (maybe a tsp.) of Old Bay to the mixture and I mixed sour cream with a bit of Garlic & Herb Old Bay to taste for dipping. My mom was in love with these, but 7 year old daughter disliked the 'crust' (the browned sides).

I was disappointed.  I could only choke down 2 myself and my daughter ate none.  I had leftover Baked Salmon Fillet Dijon which I used in place of the canned salmon.  Because the fillet was already "dijoned" I followed the suggestions of the lazyandvain review and added a t. of dijon mustard & lemon juice each, 1/2 t. black pepper, 2T sour cream, a dash of Franks Red Hot Sauce and 1 t. Old Bay.  Also, used panko bread crumbs (I just like these much better for EVERYTHING!)Mixed and made patties the night before and let all the flavors meld together in the fridge.  The patties cooked up nicely in the canola oil - about 1/4" in the pan.  They looked great.  Taste disappointing.  My daughter and I both love Salmon and this was just not great at all.  I guess we're not salmon patty people!

These were delish, I don't eat grains though so I subbed the bread crumbs with some coconut shavings and crushed almonds. I also added in some cayenne , hot sauce, an extra egg and some garlic.     Great for salads, on the go lunch , snacks, appetizers, or for breakfast (fried or over easy egg on top mmmm)     Thanks for the recipe!

Love salmon patties.  Try adding some leftover mashed potatoes and not so much in bread crumbs.  Also great to dip in crushed french fried onions (the kind you would use in green bean casseroles) or panko bread crumbs get nice and crunchy also.

ummm, a bit too bland for my taste...I think I'd throw in some tabasco or jalapeno as someone else mentioned.  Giving one star because at least it was filling...not at all satisfying though.

this is a great baseline to start from...However, I made these changes: used panko instead of crumbs, no oil added chopped celery and jalapeno broiled on low in oven foe 5 minutes instead of pan frying.

More delish than I expected ! I started with raw ground salmon from my grocers & marinated it in half tsp salt and pepper before mixing with other ing. I thought the canned salmon would make it too dry & the fresh ground salmon adds a lot more flavour and better texture. Only thing I would change is mincing the onion before adding it would taste even better I think

My husband and I both liked this recipe, however we aren't big onion fans and prefer more spices, so I made the recipe again without the onions and added parsley flakes, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and we both loved it.

Since we're "watching our carbs"...I did the following... Did not use the breadcrumbs. Added one Tbsp of mayo (made with olive oil) Added sauteed chopped onions Added some pepper - not too much Added the egg Added some fresh cut dill of course, added the salmon. Mixed together and cooked in a fry pan. Topped with a bit more dill for color.

Thank YOu for this recipe, my mom used to always make these when I was a kid. I remember she added saltines to her patties, so I used hlaf bread crumbs and half saltines, we dipped them in ketchup and told the kids they were Krabby Patties (from spongebob) everyone liked them.

Great recipe! I made a few changes, using 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup self-rising flour, then lightly dredged them in flour before browning. Also added garlic salt & chives to the mix as well. The kids loved them, too! Thanks :)

These are terrific!  I used Cheez-it crackers instead of the breadcrumbs, added a dash of hot pepper and garlic powder.  I can't wait to have one cold on a sandwich tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe and reviews.

Super Tasty! I had prepared the mixture the night before so it would be quick to smush together and throw in the pan, and I don't know if that was why they stuck together so well but they did. I followed the recipe exactly with only one modification--did pre-fry the onions--and one additon--mixed in the zest of almost one lemon. I would definately fry the onion again and the lemon added a little freshness to it. Served with fried potatoes and was great on a burger bun the next day for lunch. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is a great basic recipe.  To keep it really moist, I like to put in about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella in the mix.  YUM!

For my first time ever making salmon patties, what a fantastic starter recipe! I changed things around a bit after I read some suggestions other people had made; I used low-sodium saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs, added 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, a pinch of sugar, 1/2 tbsp black pepper (I like a little kick), 1/3 cup of shredded fresh Parmesan and a dollop of sour cream. The mix held perfectly; the results were just YUM (though a bit salty for my taste, can't figure out how that happened). Next time I'm going to bake them for 20 min at 375.

This is a good classic recipe.  I didn't make any changes to it.  They came out great.  I used a recipe on this site for sauce.  It was called "dressing for potato salad".  I did change that by doubling the amount of Worcestershire.

GREAT!  Never made salmon patties before, but these were a hit.  I also added a bit more spice to them...I added Ms. Dash spicy seasoning (sorry forget the real name), and then a bit of the green tabasco.  I served on a bun with a spicy mayo that I made (mayo, green tabasco, cayenne pepper, and blackoning seasoning).  SO good and easy!  Will become part of our dinner rotation!

Very yummy as it is, however one could also add a wee bit of flavour if needed.

I tried it with chopped dill and ground nutmeg and whole cumin seeds.

I wanted a basic and easy recipe for salmon patties and I found it. I used the salmon in the pouch, it makes it alot easier than the stuff in the can. This is a great recipe for anybody to personalize.

Very tasty and easy.  I used 2 eggs, no juice from can (and definitely picked out the bones and skin....bleh), and used dried minced onion, garlic and onion powders, dried parsley, paprika, and salt and pepper, since I had plain bread crumbs.  Delicious.  I'll definitely make again.

I was so excited when I saw this recipe. I was raised by my grandmother and she made these all the time.  She called them "fish cakes".  I tried this recipe and it taste almost like my grandmother's.  I know the only difference is she (my grandmother) made hers with vegetable oil.

These salmon patties had the perfect texture and flavor. I used all the liquid from the salmon. I substituted green onions and added a little lemon juice and pepper, then breaded them with more bread crumbs. They turned out delicious (we really liked the breading, I just put formed the patties then put them on a plate of bread crumbs), definitely a repeat recipe!

Hubby and the kids loved them.
Followed the suggestion of adding an extra egg, also some old bay, lemon juice and black pepper.  Also following love2cook's review and made a homemade tartar sauce- mayo, horseradish, pickle relish, hot sauce, lemon juice, parsley- plus I added old bay seasoning to the sauce also.
Thanks Sue and Love2cook for the great recipes.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I didn't have any onion on hand so I skipped that.  I added a little garlic powder and oregano and used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  This will be a regular in our house.

This was a great recipe--just like my mom used to make!  My family loved it and they all agreed that this would be a regular.  I took some advice from others and added some black pepper, lemon juice, and sour cream.  I used some breadcrumbs, but I also rolled them in cracker crumbs for an extra crunch.  I added more oil and took more of a 'deep fry' approach.  This was great!

A wonderful basic recipe that most people will enjoy.  I used quick 1-minute oatmeal instead of  bread crumbs, increased the onion to 1/2 c, and sprinkled the mixture with garlic salt. I also make these exactly by the recipe and dip in Heinz 57 sauce. If I want  even more flavor, I fry in oil and butter.  Yum! Can't go wrong with this one.

Salmon patties are a favorite in our house. Instead of bread crumbs, I use corn meal. It gives it a nice crunch.

my mom has been making these for years, and i thought it was great that there was actually a recipe out there similar to hers! i always think it's funny that canned salmon can taste this good :) i agree with the others that you should play with different additions, but that's part of the fun with this recipe - you can adjust the ingredients to serve with different sides. a little green pepper or green onion and old bay seasoning is an easy favorite that you can eat alone or serve over mixed greens with a vinaigrette.

Nice, basic salmon patty recipe with lots of possibilities for adding "extras."  I added some lemon juice and a bit of garlic. Yum!!

I've made these many times, trying the recommendations in the reviews. The panko makes it taste so much better, I also use garlic and onion powder, paprika and a little cayenne. 

I had some leftover vegetables today and put the patties on top of a bed of baby spinach with red onion, and drizzled over a little bit of balsamic vinaigrette with Maille mustard. Turns this into a totally different, but still simple dish!

I enjoyed this very much.  I added about 1 tsp dill weed and 1 stalk celery.  I didn't add the crumbs as I was trying to make it "low carb".  This will become a regular meal in my house.  And the lemon sauce from this site was also excellent.

We thought these were a bit bland and a little dry.  I will try again adding some liquid of some sort, garlic, and maybe some Creole seasoning.

Yummy Yummy!! :D I'm licking my lips as I type. Those Salmon Patties were delicious! I didn't add or take away anything. Although I forgot about the part where you had to reserve the salmon liquid, and I was like, oopsee! But it would have needed the liquid anyway so it was all good. They stayed together and turned out perfectly! I was very pleased :D My sister kept trying to steal some of the Patties, and my Daddy took one right when I brought them to the table. Very good Sue!

I really liked this recipe.  Instead of the liquid from the salmon I used chicken broth.  I added garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, and a few crackers addition to recipe. I also used Pam instead of Olive Oil.  Once I made the patties I dipped them in a little flour.  My husband really liked them.  He didn't compare them to his mothers! So, that's a big compliment!

This recipie was great although I made several modifications.  To cut down on the fat I used 1/4 cup of egg beaters and fat free cooking spray instead of the egg and olive oil, also since I did not have an onion I used onion powder.  In addition, I added some garlic powder and zataran's creole seasoning (no set amount, just to your liking), then once cooked I topped them with some asian chili sauce and it was excellent!!  This is a definate keeper in my book!

I made these gluten free by substituting the bread crumbs with garbanzo bean flour and added my own spices and about 1/8 tsp horseradish. 
I will definitely make these again.

I added a couple tablespoons of the reserved liquid even though I was able to form them into patties and they were SO GOOD. My two kiddos aged 4 and 2 also ate and loved these and ate seconds. Thank you for the recipe!

I forgot to get a picture, but they turned out just like the photo shown in the recipe.  They were very easy to make and really good.  I love salmon patties but deep frying them like I normally do is just not as healthy as these are and these are just as good. 

Thank you!

I used cracker crumbs,  a scant teaspoon of dried dill and a tsp of lemon juice and fried the patties in salad oil and some butter.  Love it this way.  Love it better with a side of creamed canned peas, which turned my daughter in law green at the thought so my husband ate her portion.

It was good. Should have followed the directions a little closer. I put the oil in the patty and it made them softer than they should have been. But tasty either way.

Very simple and delicious! I didn’t have bread crumbs so I crushed up some seasoned croutons. I really love using coconut oil so I used that instead of olive oil. They turned out great! They didn’t fall apart when I turned them!!

We quadrupled the recipe and cooked them on a griddle.  It made 31 patties.  They were a hit for our large family.

This was so simple and delicious!  I only had 2 cans of salmon (5 oz each), so I cut down to 1/3 bread crumbs to make sure they wouldn’t be too dry.  I added salt and pepper to taste before frying in olive oil.  They turned out perfectly!  I sometimes make tuna patties for my two boys who love dipping them in ketchup—and these salmon patties are also a hit in my household.  I will make them again and again, especially if I’m in a time crunch.

One of my favorite recipes! I double the recipe, fry, cool and freeze these. I heat them in a cast iron skillet from frozen 3 - 4 minutes per side and they taste like they were just made. I use crackers instead of bread crumbs (ritz) and save the juice from the can to add if the mixture is dry. I like moist patties.

I used eggbeaters instead of whole eggs. I didn’t have bread crumbs so I crumbled Ritz wheat crackers instead. And I added coarse black pepper. My husband who is not a fish eater, ate a patty and said it was good!

This is my favorite way to use our canned salmon. For the breadcrumbs I grind up some gluten free multigrain crackers (Crunchmaster brand from Costco), and I fry in coconut oil instead of olive oil. They get a beautiful crust on the outside and the crackers add just the right amount of saltiness.

These patties were moist and delicious!  Wish I had found this recipe years ago.  I've been "choking down" my dry salmon patties for no reason!  The tip to save the liquid from the can is a much-needed step and GREAT idea!  Why didn't I think of that?  Per my personal taste, I added a lot more onion, garlic, and some Old Bay Seasoning.  My patties were a hit at dinner, my fiance asked for seconds, which was a first for my salmon patties!  Thank you for this recipe!

I borrowed other suggestions on here and added my own twist... garlic and peppers sauteed in butter then added to salmon with lemon juice, lemon pepper seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. I made one HUGE MISTAKE... I put it on the barbecue! Was too mushy for that and fell apart. Other than that, absolutely delicious!!!!!!

Really simple recipe that yields a great result! I only had 10 oz of canned salmon on hand, so I tossed in a can of tuna... so it was about 2/3 canned salmon and 1/3 canned tuna... Otherwise followed the recipe as written... worked great!

I plan to play around with other similar ingredients, such as imitation crab, etc.

I stayed with most of the recipe except I added two cloves of garlic. And crackers instead of bread crumbs. And I will make it again . It is a very easy start to a meal. I also made macaroni & cheese and stuffing to complete the meal.

Absolutely delicious.  I added an extra egg white, since I used a bit more salmon.  A huge hit.  Served with rice and a dollop of plain yogurt.

These are very tasty and so easy to make!! These salmon patties have a great flavor despite only having four ingredients. I made these and topped them with a sauce made out of Greek yogurt, fresh lemon juice, and capers. It was wonderful and my whole family enjoyed them as well. I will definitely make these again for a quick and easy meal.

The salmon cakes are very good but a bit plain. We suggest creative seasoning (Old Bay?). They can be pan fried in a small amount of oil (we use a combination of coconut & olive oils) in a good pan so the cakes are crisp on the outside, but not at all greasy.

This is how I make my salmon patties and have for years. The only thing I do differently is I use a whole grain/nut/seed bread, to make them even healthier. I let the bread air dry from morning till time to cook. We like them so much that I cook enough for leftovers, so 1 slice of bread for each can of salmon.

These were really good! I did make a couple of changes. Instead of bread crumbs I crushed up some Ritz crackers. I seasoned with minced garlic, parsley, white pepper, and black pepper. I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil. Lower and and slow frying made the outsides nice and evenly crispy. These tasted great as leftovers. Will definitely make again!

Family thought they were a little bland but I loved them. I added a little sea salt and pepper. Used Italian Bread crumbs  instead of plain (That's just what I had to work with) and I thought it added a little bit more flavor to them.
I made a simple dip out of sour cream and sriracha. The spice tastes great with these.

It’s a versatile base recipe but a little bland as is.  It needs a sauce for dipping.  Stored bought Thai chili sauce and wasabi mayo are really good with them, or of course cocktail sauce.  To the cakes I add 1T lemon juice, pepper, and paprika to taste.  I’ve also tried 1tsp Old bay seasoning, fresh garlic, and cayenne in the cakes.  Another quick sauce is 3/4c mayo, 1T lemon juice, 1tsp dill.

Funny thing. I didn't have enough crackers in the  house for all 4 patties. I had some cheeze its and ground it up and breaded one with that. Not as healthy probably but turned out delicious. Great recipe!!

Only difference is we use "fresh/stale" bread, not dry or crumbs. Comes out a little sweeter, only a little, which I love, and the flavor still soaks up after we mix by hand (clean hands obviously, but we don't mind getting them nicely dirty in the bowl!) getting it very well incorporated. We eat 'em bone in! The bones literally melt in your mouth adding amazing flavor, so don't be afraid to try it,  it's nothing like regular fish bones.  These are good.

Will definitely make it again! After reading some of the reviews I did add about 1/2 teas. lemon juice, a pinch of garlic powder and 2 eggs. It held together great!  We loved it but I think I will omit the lemon juice and garlic next time just to see which way we prefer it. Now to find a good Dill sauce recipe to go with it  for a fancier meal

This is a good basic recipe to play around with. I'm new to cooking and I'm not as adventurous as some when it comes to food. I'm allergic to onion. I added lemon juice, pepper, 1/2 t of Old Bay seasoning and used lemon. I had panko crumbs that I refined a bit more and added chia seeds. If I'd had non-flavored Greek yogurt, I would have added that in place of sour cream that was suggested. I will add more Old Bay the next time and try the Greek yogurt. Overall, I was very pleased!

Good basic recipe. Added some Tabasco sauce . Used a little milk. Also substitued 8 saltine crackers for the bread crumbs. Coated with crackers and a little flour!

These were delicious! It was my first attempt at salmon patties and my three guys loved them. I had to pop the mixture in the fridge for a bit (I added the reserved liquid and it was a tad too mushy) but that firmed it right up. I had some leftover bread crumbs (which I made out of ritz crackers) so I coated the outside of the patties with that so it didn't go to waste. I also seasoned it with salt and pepper and de-boned the salmon (I was told I didn't have to but I just couldn't leave all that in there.) I made a dipping sauce of honey mustard and mayo to go with it, which complimented it well. We will definitely eat this again!

These salmon patties were delicious cold. When you take lunch to work and no one will let you heat up fish due to the smell, this is the choice to make. Eat them with a salad on the side and you have a filling delicious lunch. Fish is a superfood and salmon has a lot of Omega 3 which is needed for your hair, skin and nails.

Rating reflects my minor changes.  I added finely minced celery with the minced onion.  Also added some butter to regular salad oil for browning.  Makes a great tasty crust.  I like this recipe because you get a lot of salmon with only 1 egg to dilute it.  I just remove skin from the can of salmon.  The bones will melt in your mouth, you won't know they are there.  Nutritious. They are pressure cooked in the can and pulverize.

The salmon patties turned out well! In fact I made smaller portions so I had 6-7 patties. I served this with half a baked potato and steamed broccoli.

Very good with addition of fresh garlic and Creole seasoning in place of salt & pepper. Will make again. Oh, I also used egg whites beaten rather than whole egg.

I changed the canned salmon with frozen fillets, which I Poached wrapped in cling film, in boiling water.  Then I also added a tiny splash of milk to make the mixture a bit more moist.

I made this recipe as described. Best salmon patty ever!! They were so delicious. My mom used to make them, and I have tried many times too, but for some reason these were so much better than any I have had. The only difference was I salted and peppered each side of the patty before cooking,  and I used Red Sockeye (canned) Salmon. The outside was quite  crispy (not burned, but browned nicely) with a softer inside. I ate them while still warm. I honestly think I could have eaten all seven of them, but I just ate two (for now at least).

Yummy. I've always used crackers but I  really liked the seasoned bread crumbs. This recipe was so easy. It made eight patties and I could have eaten the whole batch...but I didn't. With recipes like this who needs Red Lobster?

These were quick and easy and tasted mild, not fishy. We used Kirkland canned salmon from Costco. We used two small cans of salmon and added 1 Tbsp of regular mayonnaise. It made 5 patties. Will put into regular rotation.

Have always used crushed saltines in my salmon patties but never again. The panko bread crumbs and lighter and fluffier!!
I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, garlic powder and a little black pepper! They were excellent!!

I chose this recipe for it's simplicity. I used panko bread crumbs and think there should be seasoning in the patties, even a touch of sea salt would elevate it.

I did not have bread crumbs so I used rice krispies cereal b/c   it is low in sugar. I had 14 oz of  leftover salmon.   I also added a 1 Tbl brown spicy mustard and chopped 2-3 green onions as well as 4 shakes of Tobasco and 1 Tbl  lemon juice.   So good!

Easy to make! I followed the recipe almost exactly, using panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs, and made a quadruple batch, to use up the canned salmon I had. Didn't fry it right away; instead I'm keeping the prepared fish in the fridge, so we can make patties and eat them as a quick meal...we have had them for every meal of the day! They go well with scrambled eggs, or a salad,  or even fried up and placed into a tortilla. Easy to top off with your favorite sauce, too, if you so desire! I fry these in ghee, and they taste wonderful!

The recipe is good instead cooking on the stove I cooked on my george foreman grill. Three at time on the grill.you do not need to use no oil and it is health and I add garlic power and salt and pepper and one more egg.

Liked this a lot. Added extra seasoning and celery. Didn't have bread crumbs so chopped up a thin bun. Will make again!

In a word -"outstanding " I added just a 1/8 0f a rocoto pepper into the mix and gave it just the right amount of heat. With the patties left the next day I made a Salmon patty burger with a tomato &corn salsa and Napa cabbage cold slaw

Followed the recipe, added a little lemon juice since I was using the waterless packs.  Used a 2.5 and a 5 oz and was able to make 4 very nice sized patties.  Quite tasty, super easy.  Just like Mom use to make.

This had such high ratings, I had high hopes. I used two cans (7 oz. each) of Kirkland salmon and Panko bread crumbs  (and the onion and egg) and I was unable to make patties out of these! Even after adding all the liquid back in. What did stay together was so bland, even my husband (who everyone pegs as a bland eater) thought these were bland. Definitely needs some cajun or other seasoning to liven these up. Sorry, I'll search for a different recipe...

I have not had Salmon Patties since I was a kid. Cooking is not my favorite thing to do, but dinner must be made. I had 3 cans of canned salmon in my pantry so I looked up a recipe and found this one. I liked it because it looked easy. Well not only was it easy but for the first time making Salmon Patties they were fantastic. Way better than the recipe with saltine crackers in place of the bread crumbs!! My granddaughter who hated fish even liked them. The only thing I will add next time is some sort of dipping sauce, but again very delicious!

So good! This is simple and delicious! I use panko breadcrumbs and add haphazard amounts of salt, parsley, basil, and pepper to make up for "seasoned" breadcrumbs. Even my youngest child, 3 years old, loves these salmon cakes. I serve with a sauce of plain yogurt, dill, and lemon juice. Add a salad and mashed potatoes for heartiness.

Nothing amazing about it, but it's a quick dinner fix for that can of salmon you have in your pantry.
I added some red bell pepper, garlic, dill and yellow mustard.

This was delicious, nutritious and easy.  I made 4 patties using one 6 oz can of salmon.  I kept the rest of the recipe as is (i.e., I did not scale down) but added a sprinkling of salt, pepper, dill and oregano.  Delicious and super easy - took 10 minutes total.  Husband liked it and this will become a staple, go to weekday meal in our household.

honestly, when people review a recipe it is nice to see that it is still good with slight changes.  i have had great results by  omitting the onion or subbing scallion.  since these make great leftovers, i double recipe every time.  also, i am health conscious so i use half the amt of seasoned bread crumbs, plus i bake the patties at 350F until finished which takes 15 or so minutes in my oven.  Place one or 2 patties atop greens or microwave some frozen veggies.  add spicy mustard or a salsa for low calorie flavor condiment.  voila!

An easy, quick economical meal that was enjoyed by all.  Substituted saltine crumbs because I had a box of saltines and no bread or bread crumbs.  (Used quite a bit of the reserved liquid because of this).  Added some celery and a dash of old bay to the mixture.

Made these tonight. They turned out great. I did follow another reviewers suggestion and added some dijon mustard, about 2 Tbsp sour cream and lemon juice. The family loved them. Served them for the adults with a dill, dijon mustard sauce. My toddler ate them with sour cream spread on top.

I'm sure this is delicious just as written! I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs (or even bread crumbs), so I used panko (and coated the patties in it too) and improvised on the seasonings by tossing in some lemon pepper seasoning, garlic, and lemon juice. I had to use two eggs to get it to bind. Try frying in garlic olive oil!

I mixed with tuna style salmon, 1 egg, bread crumbs, minced onions, and I used Dawson fish and chips batter mix instead of flour to make mine.. they are tasty and crunchy ! Oh and a  1/2 a stick of butter instead of olive oil.. I ran out of olive oil! Ugh ! But my butter did fine!

I didnt have an egg, so I added mayo. Wanted to use up cream cheese with chives, so I added about 1/8 cup. Herb croutons and multi grain crackers instead of bread crumbs. Some cajun spices and cayenne pepper.

I had some leftover salmon that i wanted to use, so I went searching for a simple way to use it. This recipe was simple and hit the spot! Other than using leftover baked salmon, I prepared it just as instructed. Very tasty and I will be making this again.

Amazingly simple and delicious. I made it  with one altered ingredient- I used half  the suggested amount of bread crumbs and substituted other half with almond meal. Also added a teaspoon of horseradish mustard. A perfect snack or meal item!

My wife made this recipe.  Delicious.  The only thing different she did was to saute the onion and she also sauted garlic before making into patties.  She will make again.

This is a great base for salmon patties. I made some changes though because I'm eating a Paleo diet. Instead of bread crumbs I used 1/2 c of cooked quinoa. I baked them for about 25 minutes flipping them mid way. They weren't super crispy like my moms were growing up but the flavor was very similar.

Very good!! Quick and easy. Like another reviewer suggested, I used 1 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. dijon mustard and freshly ground black pepper in place of the onion. I will make it again.

Great base recipe! Per other reviewers I used 1t. Dijon, 1T. Lemon juice, dash black pepper, 2t. May, dash Franks hot sauce, Old Bay, fresh grated Parmesan, 1t. Garlic salt, finely diced sweet pepper and onion. For breadcrumbs subbed same amount of Ritz crackers crushed and used leftover grilled fresh salmon (YUM!). Pan-fried with Pam spray and they turned out fabulous! Flattened the patties so they would heat through easy. May try baked sometime (per another reviewer 375 degree oven for 20 min).

I think it's challenging getting the internal temperature to the 160F that is needed for products with eggs without burning the patties. Any suggestions?

It was my first time making salmon cakes. I used the 14 1/2 oz can. I mixed it on the  highest level on my mixer until it had a pasty consistency and dropped the patties in the griddle. Next time I might add an extra egg. I served it with brown rice and green beans. It was a crowd pleaser.

My whole family loved this!!  My patties weren't forming correctly, (and I didn't want to add too much of the juice from the can because of my picky eater) so I followed some of the other suggestions to add Dijon mustard and sour cream to the mix.  It helped them form into patties and made them yummy!
I will be making this again!

These were very tasty.   The only change I made was to use two small cans of boneless salmon.   I also chilled the patties in the refrigerator for an hour.  I will definitely  make these again.

this is a good basic recipe.  I used leftover cooked salmon, 2 eggs, bread crumbs with herbs, fresh red onion, parsley and garlic, salt, lemon pepper and lemon juice.  next time I will add dill weed, celery seed and my homemade green tomato relish.  I sautéed 6 patties in olive oil and served them with a bernaise sauce with green peas added.  delicious !

Admittedly I've become obsessed with beans, therefore I put some in this recipe, I added 15oz, 1 oz short 2 full cups of cooked navy beans. I processed them with about 1/2 cup of milk till pureed. In a bowl grated a med. size potato into bean mix and 1/2-3/4 cup of w.w. flour, 1/2 tsp soda, added 1 egg only, 1tsp lemon juice, 3 tsp. yoghurt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and garlic powder, 1/4 t salt, 1/4 cup oats then added sauteed 1 yellow pepper and 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 onion to mixture, mixed well. Gently added large  (418g) can salmon well drained. Fried on 3-4 setting till rich brown colour, they turned out really really good. Njoy. Next time will add, parsley and dill.

great recipe, but I made a few changes..I added two eggs to the mixture.  I used 1/4 cup panko in the mixture along with 1 tbs.  fresh parsley, 3 chopped scallion, 1 tsp old bay seasoning, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground pepper, 2 tbs. fresh lemon juice, and one tbs of sour cream.  Mixed this and then made patties.  I dipped the patties in more panko crumbs.  I cooked a few in a mixture of butter and olive oil.  I served them with  vegenaise mayo. I froze the extra ones I had not cooked.  I

I just made this with about ten minutes to spare before my husband came home for lunch. Super quick and easy! I made a few changes, though. Being allergic to onions, I eliminated those and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, Italian seasoning and paprika. I also tossed in a teaspoon of sour cream. I hadn't any dried breadcrumbs in the place so I substituted some seasoned croutons and ritz crackers. I added in a bit of the liquid from the can, too. Served it with a dollop of sour cream and a dash of dill. Delish!

Yes I love this recipe and I did make some changes instead of  one egg I put two eggs, instead of 1/2 cup breadcrumbs I put 1/4 cup breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese for this cheese you can use the store bought or you can shred fresh parmesan cheese, excellent either way, and instead of yellow onion I used scallions.  YUM!!!

I made this and it tasted great and my family liked it, however I have NEVER had good luck with salmon paties and getting them to stick together. How do you keep them from falling apart?

So quick, so easy and more importantly so tasty! year 13 student preparing for uni and can safely say this will be a quick one for the books! 

patties were gorgeous, did them exactly as the recipe (using paxo breadcrumbs) and were fab, and surprisingly sweet! 

served with herby potatoes and beans and used the recipe for lemon sauce for salmon patties and all in all a fantastic meal, if I say so myself!

This recipe is good and easy. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I toasted 2 pieces of bread and then crushed them, I seasoned the breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic, dill, salt and cayenne pepper. I used a bit more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, so I balanced that out by adding some of the reserved liquid from the salmon. They cooked really fast in my cast iron pot, I probably cooked them a bit too dark, but my boyfriend liked that- he likes charred things. They seemed a bit dry and like they could use more salt, so I didn't give this 5 stars. These would be nice with a sauce. I didn't want to make one so I paired this entree with juicy sides- buttery rice and corn and coleslaw.

Worked great.  I spiced it up with a bit of dill, a clove of minced garlic, 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan, and green onion instead of onion (for colour).

I used a large pk of Chicken of The Sea Salmond & Mrs. Dash to season & plane bread crumbs. I also substituted canola oil, instead of olive oil. Made it a much healthier version, without losing any taste.

Very good!  I only used about a tablespoon of bread crumbs as I could tell the mixture would be too dry to form patties otherwise.  I liked it with lemon juice squeezed over the patties.

Followed the directions... however I did not fully drain the canned salmon, which resulted in having to add  two extra eggs to bind the cakes together. Great recipe, I added into the cake mix: thyme, smoked paprika, smoked salt/pepper toscano cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. Topped it with Sriracha sauce and kimchee on the side.

OMG these turned out so good! I made mine with 16 oz leftover fresh salmon, which had no liquid to reserve. They were a little too dry to make into patties with original recipe so I added in a little bit of leftover creamcheese, jalapeno, artichoke dip that I had from Costco. It worked perfectly to bind everything together. Pan fried in olive oil.

An incredibly easy, quick and economical way to get your omega-3's.  My (quite picky) family members who are used to fresh salmon fillets gave this recipe a thumbs up!   I never thought I'd see them eat and enjoy canned salmon.    I did add some fresh (Meyer) lemon juice to help add moisture to form the patties and when I next make it (which will be soon, given family enthusiasm) I'll try to up the spices a bit.

Followed the directions except that I did what another reviewer suggested and coated the outside of the patties with Panko crumbs. Actually, I did half with Panko and half without and the family definitely liked the patties with the Panko crumbs better.

This was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I were scraping the plate. I added a tiny bit of red pepper to the making of the patties.. and then instead of using bread crumbs i food processed (well.. used the coffee grinder) half crackers and half fiber one. I used Parmesan and garlic crackers ( wheatables or something like that) and this added a great flavor. Both fiberone and crackers added a ton of fiber. I also added another egg.   I used a spicy mayo recipe I found which complemented the salmon wonderfully. Finally I noticed a lot of people mentioning the type of canned salmon. You can get an 8 pack or something at costco that is pretty cheap (kirkland -costco name brand) and delicious with no bones.   I will definitely make again! :)

These are super easy to make and tasty. I used this recipe to make tuna patties also and they turned out great. I added some garlic salt since my family are garlic fans but the recipe is fine just is too.

Great recipe. I skipped the onions, but seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, oregano, kosher salt, ground pepper, yellow mustard, and lemon juice. A couple of teaspoons of each. Also, used smashed up saltine crackers rather than bread crumbs. They turned out very well. Great with some tartar and cocktail sauce on the side.

My husband loved them. I also added a teaspoon of dijon mustard, a teaspoon of lemon juice, half a teaspoon of black pepper, two tablespoons of sour cream, and a dash of tabasco. They were so tasty. I think with or without these added ingredients, it is an excellent recipe especially now for the lent season.

I thought it was ok, for some reason my patties did not stay together while they were cooking. I added red/green pepper and some mixed garlic into the mixture.

We love to have grilled salmon about once a week, but in the winter months, it is way too cold to grill outside.  I was very surprised and happy to hear my husband say "Ohh! This is good!" when I served this to him.

These were really good...I used canned salmon..which happened to still have the bones in it. Although the can said completely edible it still freaked me out a little so I picked them out the best I could. I was very happy with the result. Served them with a light and healthy spinach salad.

We love it!  The kids love it.  We add in different spices to our taste of the evening.  Last night it was fresh basil, oregano and chives from the garden.  I do use a couple of the small cans of boneless salmon instead of the big can.  This is a keeper!

I used this recipe and several ideas and a few other recipe ideas. I used the sour cream, only 1 egg, used some of the salmon liquid, dill, garlic powder and salt & pepper. I used olive oil in the pan, a bit more than covering the bottom. I put red pepper flakes in the oil to add some spice. These were the best! My husband that is not a fish fan even really liked them. I might most a new recipe since we've changed this one soo much. Thanks for a great base and all of the suggestions.

Great base recipe! I added 3 tbsp of freshly chopped dill, 4 cloves of minced garlic (my family really loves garlic), 2 tsp of black pepper, 2 tbsp of low fat sour cream. I also made them on my indoor grill so they were perfectly warmed with nice grill marks! Experiment with different herbs/spices, this recipe is a winner!

Best pattie recipe! Great as is or customize to your likes...I took others suggestions and added 2 eggs. I also added cheddar cheese, wasabi, and hot sauce for a kick. I am planning to make these again as mini appitizers and also with wheat buns.

So good!  We added more onion (white and Green) and used Ritz instead of breadcrumbs.  A great quick, easy meal!

This was a simple and easy recipe.  I have made them twice in the last week and a half.  There weren't any salmon patties left at the end of dinner.  Thanks!

I cooked these salmon patties for my family. My 13-month old son and husband loved them. I have never been able to imitate my mother-in-law's, but these came very close. Thanks.

For the life of me, I couldn't get these to stick together! I will make this again but won't bother trying to form patties!  I added garlic and cayenne which went very well.  I brushed them with maple syrup just before serving which was the best part.

I really don't like canned salmon, but my mother-in-law used to make these for my husband and he asked me to make them for him.  He thought they were great.  He eats them on a bun with cheese like a hamburger.  He liked this variety better than his mom's.  I just don't get it!  Kids didnt like these much either.  They were easy and very economical though!

I had a hard time getting them to stay in a patty so we had salmon hash HAHa but still very good!
