Cream  cheese with garlic and herbs can be hard to find. I had success using light, plain cream cheese, adding garlic, bay leaf and basil from the start. It 's a good idea to skim-off the fat prior to adding the cream cheese.

It would be great if someone would recommend a compliment of herbs/spices to use with plain cream cheese!

This is my granddaughters FAVORITE meal, so I make it every time she comes down. The only thing I do differently is I add a few Tablespoons odds soy sauce. I live this recipe!!!!
