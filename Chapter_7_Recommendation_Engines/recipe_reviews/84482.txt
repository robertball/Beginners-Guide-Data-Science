After reading many of the reviews on this recipe, I modified the dish as follows: slow-cooked a 1&1/2 lb roast and diced yellow onion all day in two cans of soup, taco seasoning and 1/2 C water. Removed meat and shredded it, poured the seasoned soup mix into a bowl and stirred in the salsa, cheese, 1/2 C sour cream, and fresh cilantro. Stirred meat back into this mixture and started the layers. I sprinkled sliced olives on top of every layer. Cooked on high until the top layer of cheese looked melted (about 75 minutes). I kept my tortillas in the fridge all day, and that may have kept them from crumbling into mush while they cooked. All my husband and I could say while eating this was "oh my god this is good!", and we had to force ourselves NOT to eat the whole thing in one night. Reheated portions the next day (microwave for lunch, and oven for dinner), and it was even tastier!

[ETA]: I have made this several times for potlucks at work, using the ground beef and doubling the amounts. I prep it the night before and put my 6 quart crock in the fridge, then heat it the next day at work. If you sprinkle cheese on top of every salsa/soup layer, and use a DOUBLE-thick layer of corn tortilla wedges, the tortillas do not get very mushy, even after sitting in the fridge overnight.

We had a potluck at work last week and our notice was the day before at 4:30. GEE, THANKS!!! 

Seeing that I didn't have much time to prepare, I found this recipe and figured it would be quick and simple to make. I'm so glad I found it!!

I did make a few minor changes: I saw that quite a few people had noted that theirs had turned out "goopy" so I used 2 lbs of meat and also mixed in a can of drained black beans to give it some added substance. I reduced the water down to 3/4 cup and also cut the cheese in half (only used 2 cups). I used 1 and a 1/2 cups for the soup mixture and left the remaining 1/2 cup for the top. It was AWESOME!!!! It smelt, tasted and also presented itself very nicely!!! 

I was a little skeptical because I like to try out my recipes beforehand but this turned out to be a huge hit. There were no leftovers (which was a downfall for my family!!!) and I had to send out a mass email with the recipe because everyone kept coming by my office asking for it. 

Thanks so much for such a great recipe!!!! This is definately a keeper =)

This was very tasty!  I altered the recipe a bit though...  In slow cooker I used 4 frozen chicken breasts with the soups and taco seasoning.  Cooked all day and then shredded the chicken and added kidney beans to make the enchilada filling. This is the perfect consistency and very good! Then I made enchiladas with the filling and cheese.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I was excited when I saw this on the weekly email. Slow Cooker Enchiladas, what a great idea.

 I was dissapointed as soon as I saw the ingredient list. with plastic/fake ingredients like "Taco Seasoning Mix", "Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup", and "Shredded Cheese Blend."

Definately do not use flour tortillas - it turns into mush.

Over all a very good recipe!  I made a few alterations based on some other reviews, which I would suggest to others:  Use at least 1.5 lbs of beef.  Substitute regular soup w/ healthy choice low sodium (you could definitely  get away with one can!) since this dish is salty enough.  I used 12 corn tortillas, but I could suggest using more...even doubling the layers if you're a big tortilla fan b/c they seem to get lost in the mix.  Definitely don't need 4 cups of cheese (I used between 2 and 3).  I put a layer of refried black beans...one can...next time I will use 2 or 3 cans.  I also baked this in a casserole dish at 350 for 40 min.  Didn't see the point of using my slow cooker...unless you're planning to leave and then come back.  My husband suggested using crunchy tortillas next time or even layering some Fritos corn chips!  I will try that next time.  The only thing I was disappointed in was that this dish turned out more like a dip than an enchilada casserole.  Oh-and did I mention my 2 year old asked for seconds? :D

I sit here with the serving spoon eating the last little tidbits from the crock – couldn’t let any of it go to waste – it’s that yummy.  Never imagined that the soups would leave this dish tasting Mexicany, but they are subtle and let the other flavors shine.  I like trying new recipes “as is” the first time but didn’t have enough salsa or cheese on hand, so substituted Mexican style tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel) and substituted a mixture of cheddar, pepper jack and cream cheese.  Next time I will add green onions for color, plus I like them and double the amount of corn tortillas, I like them too.  The only problem I had was that I cooked it for 2 ½ hours and still had to zap it a little to finish melting the cheese – perhaps my crock pot cooks at a lower temperature than yours.

Made this recipe exactly as stated (except adding sliced black olives to the top), and it was just OK;  it was kind of bland, even though I used spicy taco seasoning for the beef.  But when served over a bed of fresh shredded lettuce and tomatoes, then covered with my favorite brand of taco sauce, it went from 2-stars to 4-stars!  The black olives on top were a big help, too.  Next time I'll probably use a mixture of pepper jack and habanero cheddar cheeses to add some spice to it.  I'll probably also add in another 50% ground beef, as there wasn't much to go around, and I'll use about half as much water in the meat.  Worth trying for sure, though!

A yummy dish! I slimmed it down by using the Healthy Request Campbell's soups (you could even use just one can in my opinion), cut the cheese in half and used reduced fat cheese.  I also added fresh cilantro!  I would recommend adding time to cook it - 2 hours would be good - and cut out some of the water of the meat mixture (I actually just followed the directions on the packet).  And yes you need more that 10 tortillas. This dish could even be cooked faster in the regular oven.  Will definitely do this one again!

I used this recipe as a base but made some adjustments and holy heck they were good! First off, I used 1lb ground turkey instead of beef. Second, after adding the taco seasoning and water to simmer I added a small can of rinsed black beans. Third, I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for Santa Fe cooking creme (to add creaminess and spice!) and used chunky black bean and roasted corn salsa. Since I used a 6quart crockpot I didn't quarter the tortillas, I left them whole and placed them 3 across. I cooked these on low for 3 hours, and the last half hour with the lid off to evaporate some of the moisture and brown the top. Delicious! I will definitely make them again!

Everyone loved these- even the kids had seconds and thirds!  Changes: I used ro-tel mild instead of salsa, flour tortillas instead of corn, and used cheddar and mozzarella because I didn't have Mexican blend.  They were so easy to make and tasted so good.

Very good, good comfort food.  I did change a few things based on what I had on hand... Used shredded cooked turkey, sauted with green onion and black beans and a little bit of water, with homemade taco seasoning.  And for the soup mix - used only 1 can of cream of soup and added a couple dollops of lite sour cream. and only 1/2 of the cheese.  Definitely would have been too goopy as is.  And it was a little salty.  Next time will use low salt version of soup.  Oh, and didn't have regular salsa - used TJ's salsa verde.  Overall, very easy and quite good but I enjoyed the shredded meat and bean mixture to give it a little texture - otherwise would have been too mushy.

I read the reviews of this recipe, see you give it 4 stars, then tell how you "adjusted" the recipe! It's one thing to add some salt or delete some cumin! You people are making a whole new recipe! How about you make up your own, based on this, on make it public!!!!
Some of the " i did this" is an entirely new recipe!!!!!
Come on peeps! 
I'm gonna try it as it is! If you need to add brisket, different seasonings and etc etc......make your own post! This recipe did not include chicken or beef brisket!!!!!

This is a great base recipe!  I added sauted onion & garlic, and 1/2 C chopped green chili to the meat mixture.  Quit complaining about using a package of taco seasoning - if you want to be a 'purist,' then add your own chili, garlic, onion, oregano, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper.  I'd much rather add one package already mixed for me!   I used low-sodium soups, and added a good-sized dollop of sour cream to the soup mixture.   Yes, this is a recipe for layered enchiladas, but could be rolled into corn tortillas if one wished.  The ease of layering enchiladas, however, is great!

This was wonderful!!  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on low and it turned out perfectly.  I followed some other reviewers advice and used 2 pounds of ground beef, however, do NOT be worried about mush, it is not mushy at all. I added 2 packs of taco seasoning mix b/c I used 2 pounds of beef, and used 1 1/2 cups of water as called for on the mixes.  The key is to let the beef simmer with the water until the water is absorbed - it takes anywhere from 10-15 minutes and the beef absorbs all the flavors.  I had 3 layers of beef and cheese/salsa/soup mix, so after the final layer I actually needed 4 more corn tortillas quartered to cover the top layer. I only used about 3-3 1/2 cups of cheese total b/c it is what I had, you could certainly use more or less depending on your liking.  If I was going to add a can of black beans I would drain and rinse them and add them into the beef mixture with the taco seasoning and water while reducing.  It is wonderful with sour cream on top, and would be even better with guacomole.

I wouldn't exactly call these enchiladas but it turned out really good! I think next time I will get rid of the soups and use enchilada sauce to make them taste more like enchiladas. It was a bit too salty for my taste so I recommend using low salt soups. I doubled the tortillas and used about 1/2 pound more meat. I also added black beans, fresh tomatoes and topped it with olives.

I modified this a bit.  My husband doesn't really like cream of mushroom or chicken soup, but he loves enchiladas.  Instead of the two soups, I used a large can of green enchilada sauce and the salsa and cheese.  I also only used the amount of water that was called for on the taco seasoning mix package.  I used 1 lb of beef and 1 lb of grd turkey.  I topped off with the enchilada cheese mixture.  My family loved this.  Remember that the green enchilada sauce is very mild, so its good for kids that don't like really hot stuff!

Ok, for starters, I'm 100% Mexican! and I have made enchiladas the original "authentic" way and this way. But hey, when you work and come home tired and the family is hungry, who has time to roast peppers, blend tomatoes and make sauces from scratch. On a weekend yes, on week nights, no way. For those snobs who can not use canned soups or packaged mixes, then, as my sister tells me, scroll baby scroll. I've made a version of this for years and my family loves it! I don't use the chicken/ mushroom soup. I use 2 cans of tomato soup. Gives it a more authentic taste and look, hahaha.   I will continue to make this as we can all use some shortcuts from time to time. Ps I usually bake mine in the oven.

I actually did not make this recipe. I think we should enforce the 'truth in advertising' here. (Joking)  I have lived in AZ for many years and Enchiladas are my favorite mexican dish. This is NOT an Enchilada dish. It is an Enchilada CASSEROLE. Those of you who know what a REAL Enchilada is, will understand. I always have to check out a recipe when it says 'Enchilada', always looking to see what is new and different out there. The picture of this dish is not even appealing to me.

I'm afraid I'm not keen on this receipe.  I don't think there is anything wrong with it, it just isn't my thing. It was very saucy, cheesy... and had a lot of salsa.  I think maybe I should have used a much smaller jar of salsa for my particular tastes.  I don't mind that the corn tortillas get a little soft because that's how real enchiladas are.  I am rating this at a four because I feel the only thing wrong was my own tastes.

The salt content and overall unhealthy qualities of the canned soup makes this recipe absolutely an embarrassment to serve guests.  It had such a high "canned soup" taste and was not at all flavorful as much as it was salty.  I liked the idea, but unfortunately would not ever make this again using the soup.

I added a few cloves of chopped garlic and a sprinke of chilli pepper flakes 'cause I likes me some heat.  For my taste, I also add more meat and use ground turkey.  Next time out, I plan to try low sodium beef or chicken stock instead of water.  I would also recommend draining any grease from the meat before adding the taco seasoning and water.

OMG!!! This is SOOOOO good!  I took the advise of others and doubled the hamburger and taco seasoning. To the cheese/soup mixture I added, an 8oz block of cream cheese, cubed, corn, black beans and sliced black olives and used 2 cups of cheese. I slo-cooked it 2 hours on low. We put shredded lettuce on top with salsa & sour cream. I had jalopeno ranch dressing on mine. So very good and like others said, it is hard to stop tasting! Will definatly make this again! Cant wait for leftovers tonight for dinner!

Oh My Gosh!! This was the easiest dish to make and everyone wanted more! I personally didn't like enchiladas, so I was a bit taken back when asked by my kids to make them for dinner. I originally used this recipe because it was a quick option. Not only was it quick, it was very simple and extremely satisfying!!! Yes, I even liked it! The kids decided that THEY would used this recipe to cook dinner for the parents once a week!!

I usually try to make these recipes as-is the first time around, just to be fair to the original submitter; however, I tweaked this one from the start to suit my family's tastes. 

I used 2 shredded de-boned chicken breasts that I prepared in advance by stewing, cooling and then shredding. I also used Herdes salsa verde instead of the jar of chunky salsa called for in the recipe. I've found over the years that my family prefers green sauce with chicken or pork, and red sauce with beef when we are eating Mexican dishes. I used the 16oz jar of salsa verde and one can of cream of chicken soup and omitted the can of cream of mushroom. We're not a mushroom family, and I thought 2 cans of the soup would've been overkill. *** Next time I will use the reduced sodium soup. I used a round of queso enchilado cheese that I shredded just prior to putting into the recipe. I also used flour tortillas, as my wife doesn't care for the texture of corn tortillas sometimes. My slow cooker has a 10" round crock, so I used 10" tortillas for an easy layering system. As a side note, I used non-stick cooking spray on the bottom of the crock to help with clean-up and any issues of the tortillas sticking to the bottom, and it worked like a charm. 

I cooked everything for about 2 hours and it came out nice and melty cheesy and was easily spooned out. It isn't pretty to look at, but it doesn't matter once it's on your fork. This is definitely going into rotation in my kitchen.

I thought this recipe was really delicious and easy to make. Plus, it really tastes like enchiladas from a restaurant, but without all of the grease. I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I only used about a cup of water because the ground beef I used was pretty juicy (85% lean). I also only used 2 cups of shredded cheese for the mixture, which was plenty. I was pretty generous with the shredded cheese on top, though. It was such a great meal, but watch your portions, as this is a very high calorie, high fat entree. I served it with a spinach salad to feel a bit more healthful!

This recipe is AMAZING!!  My husband calls it "step away" (as in, step away from the pan) and often times he can't step away! ;-)  I've made it several times & tweaked it slightly.  I only use 1 cup of water & then simmer until most of the water is absorbed so it's not "soupy."  And when layering the corn tortillas, I use two or three to create a good "layer."  But, it's a very yummy recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this a few weekends ago and had unexpected company arrive. Me, I love guests so I invited them to stay for dinner. The wife is originally from South America and she does the whole Enchilada softening and wrapping thing but me I found this wonderful recipe and took the shortcut. Thank goodness this was absolutely fabulous. All four of us had seconds and fought over who got what was left.(I won) Thanks for a wonderful recipe. It is going to the cottage this May24 weekend as my contribution to the potluck xx I did double the hamburger and used 18 tortillas (corn)

This is a great recipe and so quick and easy! Will definitely be using this again and again! I did take the advice of many other reviewers and doubled the tortillas, added a can of black beans and did not use the water at all. It turned out perfect! I would also recommend serving it with some extra salsa and sour cream on the side.

I made this and the taste was wonderful but the texture was terrible.  The corn tortillas dissolved.  It was like thick, thick soup.  Did I do something wrong or is this how it is????

Wonderful base recipe!  I sub'd the cream of chicken for enchilada sauce and added a can of black beans.  Doubled the amount of corn tortilla layers and it was DELISH!  I can see so much you can do with this.  Thank you!

I added olives to the layers n sprinkled cilantro on top.  Kept the meat on Med heat after it was browned b/x i didn't want it runny.  Yummy! try adding lime juice, avocados next time

From another note: After reading many of the reviews on this recipe, I modified the dish as follows: slow-cooked a 1&1/2 lb roast and diced yellow onion all day in two cans of soup, taco seasoning and 1/2 C water. Removed meat and shredded it, poured the seasoned soup mix into a bowl and stirred in the salsa, cheese, 1/2 C sour cream, and fresh cilantro. Stirred meat back into this mixture and started the layers. I sprinkled sliced olives on top of every layer. Cooked on high until the top layer of cheese looked melted (about 75 minutes). I kept my tortillas in the fridge all day, and that may have kept them from crumbling into mush while they cooked. All my husband and I could say while eating this was "oh my god this is good!", and we had to force ourselves NOT to eat the whole thing in one night. Reheated portions the next day (microwave for lunch, and oven for dinner), and it was even tastier! [ETA]: I have made this several times for potlucks at work, using the ground beef and doubling the amounts. I prep it the night before and put my 6 quart crock in the fridge, then heat it the next day at work. If you sprinkle cheese on top of every salsa/soup layer, and use a DOUBLE-thick layer of corn tortilla wedges, the tortillas do not get very mushy, even after sitting in the fridge overnight.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo potluck.  I did make a few changes.  I started by using my 5qt oval crock pot.  Then I changed it to 12 servings.  I only used 16 tortillas, 3/4 cup of water, 2- 10oz cans of rotel tomatoes instead of salsa and only 2 cups of cheese.  I cooked it on high for an hour and a half until bubbly and then turned it to warm...needless to say it didn't last long and everyone was asking for the recipe!!!  Will be making this again for sure!!

Very,VeryGood...I did make a few tweeks, as for some of the other reviews I only added half the water. On each of the corn tortillas I spread them refried beans.On every other layer I put double the tortillas, as it made it more hardier and easier to slice. Also, by adding double tortillas and cooking on high for about 1and half hours (or until bubbly) it prevented it from turning into a dip like so many other reviews. I did add the black olives. corn, and black beans which we all liked and gave it a great encilada taste. Needless to say feeding 4 hungry guys in their early 20's, they could'nt say a word because their mouths were full and going MMMMMMM. Also a plus to splash some of "Franks hot sauce" on it. A deffinate keeper....Easy, hardy and filling!!!!!

I thought these enchiladas were great! I used a few extra tortillas (about 15 I think), and 2 cans cream of chicken soup, and pepper jack cheese- gave it just the right amount of heat! Yum! Will make this again!

not what I expected.  It turned out to be soupy, mushy, not layered at all.  I did not like the consistency.  But, my husband liked the flavor, so I need to SERIOUSLY tweak this...and try it again.

I made this a couple of nights ago just as the recipe states & it's REALLY good and I will definitely make this again, it will make a great pot luck recipe too! My rating is for the recipe as it is written & NOT for the additions I made. I added a couple of sliced green to the top before slow cooking. I had black olives in the fridge and added those for whoever wanted them. Next time I will add another 8 oz. ground beef to make it meatier. I used a firm corn tortilla as I think a soft flimsy one would turn to mush from the moisture of the meat & cheese mixture. I suggest using a non stick spray your crock for an easier clean up later!! A note on the cooking time, it was not hot at the 45 minute mark, so I added another 20 minutes, but it could have gone for 2 hours to get nice & hot. Just keep an eye on it as we are @ 4500 feet!

I've been making something like this for years, sometimes I bake it. Use enchilada sauce in place of the soups. Then save the salsa and sour cream for outside the dish. I think doubling up on the tortillas would be a good idea if using flour.

Very good.  I actually changed it up a bit to make it healthier and to use what I had on hand, but the concept and process was all yours.  I'm very happy with how it turned out.  

I used shredded chicken instead of beef, extra tortillas (since others mentioned sogginess), omitted the cream of mushroom (hubby doesn't like them), and reduced the cheese a little (used about 3-3.5 c).  

I'm already planning to make it next time I cook for a church member!

I found this to be a bit mushy even when using Corn Tortillas. I plan on doubling meat and using a chunkier salsa next time.   The taste was great, just the consistency was off.

Wow! So surprised at how good these were! Will definitely make these again! Tasted just like my regular enchiladas that take way more time to put together.

Update: I have made these several times. I usually put these on low for 6-8 hours and they are fine. Cheese is melted and everything is nice and hot. Also, I make my own Taco Seasoning I (from this site). I would also like to say, that you want to use a good salsa. I think that really affects your final enchiladas. I also make a side of the Refried without the Refry Beans (also from this site). They also cook in the crock all day on high and are so tasty and super easy to whip up!! Would also second another person's comment. 1 hour, even on high, does not seem to be long enough for the flavors to come together and cheese to be melted enough.

This recipe was super easy & great- perfect to throw together after work, go & exercise or something, then come back & eat.
I made some changes though:
- used ground turkey
- only used 1/2 can of each soup and 1/2  the amount of cheese & salsa... using the full amount would have been too gooey for me, 1/2 of those worked out great, still creamy & lots of sauce but not overkill. I think I used 2 layers of 4 tortillas & just put 2 tortillas on top, topped w/ cheese. 
Will definitely make this again!

This is a pretty great recipe.  It tastes even better the next day. I used two cans of cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom / chicken combo.  I used mild salsa which I thought would make it bland, but it had the perfect amount of "kick" to it.  The only thing I would do differently would be to use more corn tortillas as I used twelve and they seem to be somewhat absorbed once they're cooked. I made a cornbread casserole with it (which I found on this site) and it complemented this recipe very well.    This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This turned out to be Taco DIP. .  Very salty what with the taco seasoning and the condensed soups.  Made exactly as written. It turned out very thick.  Will definitely not make again.

So glad I tried this! I am NOT a cook, but I followed this recipe almost perfectly and it was delicious. The only thing I changed was instead of 1 1/4 cup of water, I just put a cup. Also I somehow didn't see the cream of mushroom soup so I only used cream of chicken (10.75 oz). Since some people were saying it was too mushy, I will say that with my accidentally leaving out the cream of mushroom it was not mushy at all.

One other thing is that when I made this, my mom was confused as to why I would use the slow cooker for it rather than put it in the oven. She said she doesn't use the slow cooker for less than 4 hours at a time and this only said to leave it in for 45 mins-1 hour. I'm not sure if there's any difference in just putting it in the oven, but I might try that next time. Overall, great recipe!

Great dish.  I followed the suggestions of others and added drained and rinsed black beans and cilantro and used only 2 cups of cheese.  I also baked it in the oven on 350F for 40 minutes.  Everyone gobbled it up!

It's a hit, kids loved it. I baked in the oven instead of crock pot for 30 minutes. cooked ground beef the night  before and mixed other ingredients, then assembled wiht tortillas before baking so it didnt' get mushy. Leftovers made a great lunch too!

I rate this 5 stars with one change - replace either the cream of chicken soup or cream of mushroom soup with a can of enchilada sauce. I have made this twice, and my son has asked for seconds and to have it in his lunch both times.

I followed the recipe exactly without reading the reviews first.  It did not hold shape very well and was pretty sloppy.   It was very good, but next time I will increase the meat to 2 lbs, add black beans, and decrease the soup by 1 can.  I'll also saute an onion with the ground meat.  This is a great one for potlucks and prep ahead meals.

This recipe was mush. I would not consider it enchilads, more a dip. It had an ok taste, but if I made it again I would revise the recipe to maybe one can of soup and less salsa to make it more of a taco caserole.

I thought it was awesome.....one change and one addition.

I added to the layers some black beans
and instead of the soups...I used 1/2 jar of Classico sundried tomato alfrado-

Can't wait for the left overs tonight!

I used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the taco seasoning and water. Delicious  and easy to make. I put it together in the morning stuck the crock pot in the fridge and cooked it for 2 hours on high when I came home from work. In the summer I prefer to use the crock pot undead of the oven!

This was very quick to put together and had very good flavor. I added 1/2 medium onion and sauteed with my ground beef. Then I added a can of black beans to my beef mixture as some suggested. I did not use the water because my taco spices are a homemade blend and do not have corn starch to thicken when adding water. I then covered my 11X13 casserole dish with plastic wrap and foil and cooked in the oven @ 350 for 45 minutes.

Great recipe, I would modify it and not add olives and use New Mexico green chile instead of chunky salsa. Most hispanics use New Mexico green chile and never use salsa as a base for enchiladas. But otherwise it's great. Also, never use taco seasoning for enchiladas, add garlic and onion instead.

Really good, but next time I'll use medium or even a hot salsa.  Lacked a little 'snort' for us.  Also added onion and green chili to the hamburger as it was browning..

This is fantastic recipe, but I did follow some changes by the many cooks that tried this.  I gave it a 4 because I did think it was better with the changes suggested by others and myself.  Increased the hamburger to 1 1/2 lbs.  Doubled the corn tortillas.  Thanks for posting.

This is a really good start, I doubled the beef so it wouldn't be mushy as other reviewers suggested. We like heat so I added to the beef a diced hot pepper, onions and garlic and cumin, chilli pepper and cayenne pepper. Plus I added a can of black beans and corn to the beef mixture as well as diced cilantro. Then I layered but as other reviewers suggested I decreased the amount of cheese. I used Kraft Habanero cheese. It was delicious! Next time I think I will try ground turkey instead of beef.

I recently became a crock pot fan and found this recipe and wanted to try it but did make my own alterations! I cooked 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger then drained, added an onion and green pepper, then added a spicy taco seasoning packet and 1/2 cup of water, then almost a whole jar of medium salsa and a can of enchilada sauce, rinsed canned black beans and a can of seasoned pinto beans and simmered for 15 mins. Then I put 2 of the small flour tortillas on bottom (that I chose to heat real quick in a skillet) I spooned some sauce on from the mixture then added 3,4 scoops of mixture and a handful of cheese, and repeated. I watched it for about an hour and half on high and omg it was yummy! My youngest is one and oldest is 10 out of six kids and they ate it all! I like spicy but I Dix make it a little too spicy even though they ate it but that came from the taco seasoning pack. If it was up to me I would've added jalapeño and sour cream to top!

This was tasty but i did not put it in the crockpot since it was only going to cook for an hour.  My crocpot only has 4,6,8, or 10 hour cook times.  I followed everything else and added 1 can of black beans and baked at 350 for 30 minutes to heat through.

I made this recipe with ground turkey (browned with some left over green bell pepper and yellow onion) instead of beef, added a can of black beans, sliced olives, extra corn tortillas and some left over green enchilada sauce (about one cup), and omitted the cream of mushroom soup. SO VERY DELICIOUS! I served this with Mexican rice and fresh corn on the cob which, i thought, complimented it perfectly.

Well........ after receiving rave reviews by 3 VERY IMPORTANT people in my life (including 1 very small, very recently particular 3 year-old), this is a 5+ recipe!  My daughter just gave birth to our second grandson and in preparing some simple post-partum meals for them, she and her family were my "guinea pigs"on this dish - they were crazy about it, especially, as I said, my 3 year-old.  I am so thrilled that they enjoyed this!  I did double the tortilla layers, made a tad more sauce, and added black olives, kept ALL the cheese too.  Thanks AIMS312!

Delicious & so easy to make. I used 1.5 lbs ground turkey & also doubled up on the corn tortillas, as suggested by others. I cooked it on high in the crock pot for close to 1.5 hrs...it came out perfect! Next time, I may add some black beans & jalepeno peppers.

This recipe is GREAT with modifications. First, you MUST use corn tortillas or they get real mushy. I would suggest doubling the tortilla layer. Second, I suggest using much less water. I used 2 lbs ground beef and 1/2 cup water. Next time I'll use even less water. I think the soup and ground beef give off enough liquid to cook it all. Overall it was great!

Made healthy version ground turkey, low carb tortillas, low fat cream of mush and cream of chicken soups, ... tasty! Next time I'll try using only one creamed soup and replace it with a refried beans instead. (Using both creamed soups and adding beans will probably be too much filling). Over all: delicious, easy, and filling!

This was some great comfort food!  I didn't have time to put it in the crock pot & put it in the oven instead. It was great. I only used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup instead of one each of mushroom & chicken and added more salsa. Per suggestion of another reviewer, I stirred in some mashed up pinto beans in with the hamburger. Great recipe!

This didn't taste at all like enchiladas. Just another average Mexican casserole. Not my favorite on this site, but not bad.

I followed the recipe exactly and ending up running out of tortillas before I had run out of cheese mix and there was not enough beef either. Next time I'll cut down on the soup and add an extra pound of beef. Other than that, it turned out pretty well. I used Hot Rotel instead of the salsa.

WOW... this was soooo good!! Even my picky 4 and 7ry old loved this!! I did as others said and doubled the tortillas, used 2lbs meat and put in some black beans. Next time I make this, I am going to try refried beans instead of the black beans and maybe add some corn. Oh and I messed up and put in two cans of the chicen soup and still came out great (you cannot even taste the soup) Once I mixed the soup, cheese and salsa, I just threw all that in with the meat and mixed it together and layered that mixture on the tortillas. Oh, and I used a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas and was able to cut 12 king size corn tortillas at the same time with NO problems!! This is definitely one I am going to be making again. So easy and soo good!! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Recipe was quick and easy. I preheated my crock pot while I cooked the ground beef. I used 2 lbs of beef and left all the other ingredients the same. I have a large oval crock so I used 10 large tortillas quartered but I took them straight from the freezer and quarted them with a sharp knife and they sliced through easily.I did use double layers of tortillas. tortillas were not mushy this way and meal was cooked through and ready in 1 hr. 45 min.  I put green onion, black olives and diced tomatos on the top layer for presentation before cooking. I thought the taste was just okay but the hubby kept commenting throughout dinner at how much he liked it. I will make ths again because of the ease and quick prep time.

I followed the directions fairly closely but did have to substitute two cans of mushroom soup because I didn't have the chicken soup.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  For some reason this was not appetizing...at all...to me, at least.  My husband said it was 'alright' (though he'll eat just about anything) but mentioned the taste was 'too tangy'.  I don't know what that means because I didn't find it tangy at all personally, it was actually, to my taste buds, bland and boring.  I'd go so far as to say it tasted 'off'.  (And yes, I did use fresh meat and other ingredients, ha ha.)  A neat idea, for sure, and it did look neat coming out of the slow cooker (nice layers) and I might try to find another recipe for slow cooker enchiladas, but I won't be preparing this one again.

This was fantastic as a vegetarian conversion!  I substituted nacho cheese Campbell's soup in place of the cream of chicken soup.  I also used Morningstar Farms brand veggie beef crumbles (with 1/2 cup water for the taco seasoning).  I took other reviewers' advice and used double tortilla layers.  I cut the cheese down to 2 cups, and it was plenty.  

It took about an hour and a half to reach 140 degrees in my crock pot on high.  I have a larger, oblong Rival crock pot, which may have contributed to the longer cook time, as so much of the center is further away from the sides of the pot compared to cylindrical pots.  FYI!

I give this five stars not only for being tasty and easy, but it's so versatile.  You can alter the ingredients and add whatever you want, and it always turns out great.  I don't usually use as much cheese as the recipe calls for.  I've added green chiles, olives, etc.  Everyone loves this.  I don't make it in the slow cooker, I just layer it in a casserole and bake.

I read the reviews and guess my hopes were a bit higher than I thought.  This was okay-and I will make it again.  Next time I will add some green oinions, refried beans and some green chiles.  It was good-my husband ate it and really liked it-I just thought that it could be better.  Will try these things next time to improve.

I have made this several times--it's great!  I love the picture, and it really looks that way too.  I added the olives and then, I didn't use taco seasoning, because I don't really like it much--just added some chili powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt to the meat.  Thanks!

Oh wow.  These turned out great.  Followed the recipie exactly, using chipotle taco seasoning and a little ketchup to make the meat more savory.  I couldn't believe how scrumptious these were.. Wish I'd have put olives on top like the picture, that's the only thing that could have made them better!

Super easy, a big hit with the family!  I agree though, you do need more than 10 tortillas.  Also, with my crock pot it took 1.5 hours.

Excellent slow cooker dish to prepare and cook. I chose to use shredded beef instead of ground beef and added more tortillas then it called for.

I would not call these enchiladas; I would, however, call them delicious. I made a couple of modifications- I used flour tortillas and cream of onion soup in place of mushroom, both for personal preference. I also cooked it in my oven because my slow cooker broke- 30 minutes at 350, then I added cheese to the top and gave it another five minutes. It was EXCELLENT and will definitely become part of my regular rotation! Thank you for a great recipe!

My boyfriend & I loved it. Since we both are huge cheese lovers I doubled the cheese and added both mozzarella & sliced olives on top and also a dollop of sour cream. Came out excellent. Definitely throwing this recipe into the monthly/ bi-monthly rotation. I would have added a pic but it was gone in a flash. Thanks AIMS312 for sharing. 5+

Have made this twice - the first time, exactly per the recipe, and most recently with the following slight changes.  Used 1-1/2 lb ground turkey, cooked that with the taco seasoning, water and added a can of refried beans.  Used 3 layers of 6 untorn tortillas, which in my 6 qt slow cooker amounted to doubling each of the 3 layers, with a single layer of another 5 on top. Cooked on high for an hour, and served over shredded romaine with sour cream on top. Fabulous!

Tasted good and so easy to make!  I used flour tortillas and it turned out well.  I would probably use more beef next time.

After reading reviews I made a couple of adjustments. Used 1 pound beef & used Fajita seasoning. Added some fresh banana peppers to the beef once is was browned. Added a can of drained black beans to the cheese soup mixture. Also used only half the cheese suggested.  In hindsight would maybe use more beef & more corn tortillas. Cooked for 1 1/2 hours. Family LOVED it!

I found this to be a great idea, but bland. Does anybody have an idea to make it more flavorful? My fiance likes it, but he might just be polite.

This was good. I took other suggestions and added corn and black beans to the filling and doubled up on the tortillas. I did use lean ground beef and whole wheat tortillas along with low fat /low sodium ingredients. I really don't like buying store bought "seasoning packets" so I made up my own using chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper.. There is a similar one on this site. But overall I would make this again changing up a few things for my taste buds... This makes a lot! So I will be having this for lunch this week!

So good! I added a can of black beans to the meat and only 1/4 cup water.  2-3 cups of cheese is all it needs.

Great, easy weeknight dinner. I used Perdue Short Cuts chicken. I heated the chicken on the stove with the taco seasoning mix then mixed in refried beans. I served it topped with shredded lettuce and sour cream. It made a lot and the leftovers are sure to be better than tonight's dinner.

This recipe as is, is bland and tastes like mushroom soup. After tasting, I doctored it up and I would give my version 4 stars. Here it is if anyone's interested. 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground turkey (all low fat versions). 1 pkg. taco seasoning, 1 pkg. dry enchilada seasoning. Use just 1 cup of water. Add, cumin, oregano and chopped jalapeño peppers. Didn't measure any of it just went by taste. Add soups. Stir all together. Layer in crockpot, starting and ending with whole corn tortilla. I used 12 (if I remember right). Top each layer with cheese. Needed about 3 cups. Using less water made it less soupy. Was not at all dry. Single tortilla layers kind of got lost in the finished product but taste was probably the same. Mine cooked on low for about 4 hours but it wouldn't need to. Made early, layered in crock pot, and heated up several hours later. Served with sour cream and taco sauce.

Fast and easy dinner. I left out the meat and taco seasoning, added 4 more corn tortillas and a cup more shredded cheese. Kids loved them.

I made this exactly as written and it came out wonderful.  My VERY picky 7 year old said it's his 2nd favorite meal (his first is eating out).  My non-picky 4 year old ate 2 bowls.  My husband said he wished there was more (even though he literally ate half the batch).  This was so easy and CHEAP.  It is officially in the rotation.

I used a few more corn tortillas than the recipe recommended.  I also went to my pantry to get out the soups and had the cream of chicken but no cream of mushroom.  I did, however, have a can of cheddar cheese soup so I substituted that and it was delicious.  I did put one small can of slice olives inside and on top.  Makes a huge amount and I think it would make a great potluck meal.  I also used my homemade salsa, just perfect.  Served with the Mexican Rice II from AR and it was such a treat for a simple meal.

Dry had to add more ingredients to make this better. I didn't like the way it tasted in the end, you can just as well put this in a casserole dish.

Very easy to make and heats up well the next day for my husbands lunch. I used chicken instead of beef and I also mixed in a can of red enchilada sauce in with the chicken to give it some more flavor instead of using the taco seasoning mix.

The number one thing to know when making this recipe is do not use the more common flour tortilla instead of the corn. After cooking you will end up with layers that appear and taste like uncooked, gooey dough. The meat and cheese part of the recipe tasted good. But I suggest using it in a different way.

I made this, modifying with ingredients I already had. Made my own taco seasoning, used flour tortillas, and instead of using soup, I used ricotta cheese. I also added frozen corn into the cheese mixture and baked for 45 min at 400 F. Overall it was good, but I think I will add black beans to the meat and add more salsa to that. I served it with yellow rice.

This was good.  I used adobo seasoning, instead of taco seasoning, because that is what I had on hand.  Next time I will make it with the taco seasoning.

I found this recipe to be a bit salty and confusing as to whether it is 1 1/4 water or 1/4 cup water.  I did the 1/4 cup water, although next time I'll do the other because of saltiness.  I would prepare this recipe in a smaller crockpot.  I would love to add shredded chicken and possibly some green chili to this.  SOOO good though, top with sour cream!

Really good. I added onions and garlic to the meat which added more flavor. Used gluten free corn tortillas, Pace mild pecante sauce and let cook for 1 hr.  My family loved it.  If feeding kids make sure seasoning mix and salsa are  not spicy.  This is definitely a keeper.

Very tasty and very fast! Since the GF and I are trying to watch what we eat, I tried slimming this down by using Cambell's Healthy Request for the mushroom and the chicken soup and replacing the ground beef with a pound of ground turkey that was in the freezer. I also used lo-fat mexican cheese and cut it down to 3cups. 

Goes very well with a nice IPA.

These were good enough to try twice, but I still felt that something was missing seasoning-wise.  I will make again, but will tweak these with some home-canned jalapenos or some enchilada sauce. I used home-canned salsa, which is pretty sassy, but we felt it needed just a bit more kick.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I will not make these again. I followed the recipe exact. My husband and I kept eating it. I'm not sure if it was because we were really hungry or what. It was more like a stew. I used white sharp cheddar maybe that was why. It wasn't bad.

This is a keeper! Tasted great!  I admit I was a little leery about putting in cream of mushroom soup.  You can't taste it!  Just tastes cheesy/tomatoey like good enchiladas.  I made mine in a casserole --spray with nonstick spray and put in 325 oven for 45-50 min.  Yum.

This is easy and very good.  I aded more hamburger meat than it calls for and put chopped onions with the meat and added olives to the last layer with the cheese.  I also put corn in the cheese mixture - very good!

This recipe turned out really well. I used two layers of tortillas chips as many reviews suggested and they turned out well. I cooked mine for 90 min. and they were great. Enjoy!

Tried this using pulled pork I had. It turned out awsome. Will make again with pulled chicken or ground turkey to help make it more diet friendly. Thanks

I made this recipe today- tweaked things a little, by using shredded rotisserie chicken, and added some black beans, 1/2 cup sour cream, and green chiles- and can't hardly stop eating it! Highly recommended!

Almost everyone has modified this recipe because it needs "something": More flavor and a much better texture. Will never make this again.

I made this for the first time last night. We loved it and that includes my 2 year old twin boys. There was only half a spoonful left. I did make one tiny adjustment...I cooked it in the slow cooker on Low for 1.5 hours instead of High for 45 mins to 1 hour because I had to run out and didn't want it to overcook. Turned out to be the perfect amount of time at that setting. 
This is a very simple, inexpensive, tasty recipe. It fits into even the tightest budgets. I was surprised at how well these seemingly odd ingredients mixed together for a mouthful of pleasure! I will be sharing this recipe with my sister and my neighbor.

Very tasty!! Mine did not cook as fast but took closer to 2 hours. Next time I am going to cut out the cheese in the soup and salsa mix to make it healthier.

This was just okay for us. I made exactly as directed. We are not picky but only 1 out of the 6 in our family thought it was good. It is a great idea though and I may try to alter it a bit to come up with something similar.

This took no time!  I used the Healthy request soups and expected it to not be as good, but it was delicious.  I also didn't use 4 cups of cheese.  I only used 2 cups and it was plenty...plus it cut back on a lot of fat and calories.  I also added some black beans to the ground beef mixture while it was simmering and it was great.  I will be making it again.

Love it!  I read so many reviews and couldn't wait to make this.  I used 4 chicken breasts, both soups, taco mix with 1 1/4 cup water in the crock pot on high for 7 hours.  It shredded so easily. I emptied the sauce out of the pot to mix it with the salsa and cheese.  I used 2 cups of low-fat mexican cheese blend and it was plenty.  Since the crock pot was already used, I decided to stick with it.  Doubled the amount of tortillas, added a can of drained black beans to the layers (there were 3 layers total), and sprinkled a little low-fat cheese on top. Cooked on hihg for 1 1/2 hours. By using the the fat free soups, chicken breasts, and low-fat cheese, the dish was healthier, and so delicious.  My husband and 12 year old son are so happy that there were left-overs for the next night.

This dish is absoultely delicous.  I have made it several times and it always turns out great! You definitely need to add more ground beef.  I usually use 1.5 pounds.  I have used ground turkey before as well and it was just as great.  Instead of salsa I always use a can of Rotel.  It is cheaper and adds just as much flavor.  I like the chunky version because it adds a little more substance to the dish.  When making this I also add a can of drained black beans.  It just adds a little something extra.  Now...this recipe can turn out a bit soupy if you are not careful.  I don't drain the Rotel, but I do drain the beef before I add it.  I know some of the other reviewers said they had cut the cheese down to half, and while I do not use all 4 cups (I probably use around 3), I think it really depends on how big your layers are. I tend to make mine more towards the thin size, so the cheese isn't to overwhelming.  Oh and don't use flour tortillas...learned that really quick!

If you have a hankering for enchiladas, this will fix it and it's quick and easy to prepare.  I used chicken breast.  Like alot of reviewers I doubled up on the torts.  Used less than a full package of seasoning, plus less water for seasoning.  I had some of the cheese/soup mix leftover though, but it was plenty moist.  Maybe will use one can of soup instead of two, or less salsa.  Plus I baked it instead of slow cooker.  Especially good the next day.  All in all, not bad.  I'll probably make it again when we get the hankering.  So easy.

This was really good.  My boyfriend (a picky eater) took seconds, and then took home leftovers, so this is quite a compliment.  I made minor adjustments.  Another reviewer had used rotel instead of salsa, and I did that as well.  And I used only 2 cups of Mexican cheese blend and added 2 cups of cheddar.  Mine took longer to get hot in the crock pot.  I had it in for 1 hr. 10 min., and it still wasn't quite hot enough in the middle.  But I highly recommend this recipe.

This was really good! I made it as is except I used 1-1/2 lbs ground beef and glad I did. One pound wouldn't have gone far enough in making the recipe. Flavor was good. Be warned this is not a hot dish unless you make it hot. I used a mild salsa. I also added some sour cream on top at dinner. Leftovers were really good, too. I heated them up on LOW in the crockpot for about 90 minutes. Wonderful!

i added quite of bit of ingredients to this recipe, and was very impressed with how "mexican" it tasted.  some of the things i added: green chiles, jalapenos, fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes with green chiles, hard tostadas (which was the best idea), and, almost 2 pounds of ground beef, among other things, some of which were not necessary.  it was excellent, but i think i'll try it with chicken next time and i bet it's even better.  very nice work, carrie!   Follow up:  made this again, with chicken.  omitted the tortillas and used hard tostadas this time, since they soften up so much.  added small cans of green chilis, jalapenos, and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, otherwise stayed with the recipe, and it came out absolutely delicious.  so easy, the hardest part is frying the ground beef or chicken.  if you need a mexican tasting hit for your palet, this is it!

I have made this twice, once as written and once with shredded chicken and cream of chicken soup in place of the beef and cream of mushroom.  I prefer it with the chicken.  Good base recipe that can be tweaked to match your tastes

When I first saw this recipe, I was skeptical.  I did not think the cans of soup would work with it. However, I tried it anyway and used my Formula 1 group of friends as guinea pigs.  It was a real hit! Because of texture, I changed a couple of things. I followed the advice of other posts. This is what I changed. I used 2 pounds of ground beef and two packages of taco seasoning rather than one of each. I added 1 can of black beans, and 1 can of corn. I did not use the water, instead I used enchilada sauce but not in the mixture. I poured it over each layer of tortillas.  I used the slow cooker and cooked it on high for about two hours rather than one. The spice was perfect.  I served it with cut up avocado, salsa, olives, black olives, sour cream, halapinios and Tortilla chips all on the side. "perfect"

This recipe is sooooo easy to make and doesn't take much time at all. The first time I made it - I did it for a church potluck. It was so easy and got lots of great reviews. No one else thought it was salty but I did. When I make it now I use low sodium soups. This helps a little. Also - I have never in all the times I've made this used the amount of cheese suggested! I always double the recipe but don't double the cheese. 8 c. is waaaay too much!

I made this with leftover ground beef and tortillas from tacos, so I did not use the taco seasoning the recipe called for. I also cut back on the cheese and the salsa (just trying to use the ingredients I had on-hand without having to purchase more ingredients) and set it on low for a little longer than the recipe called for and it turned out great.

I made this for the first time for a work potluck and it was GREAT! Everyone raved about it! I changed a few things based upon other people's comments. I doubled the tortillas, used 1 can cheddar cheese soup & 1 can of cream of mushroom, and 1 pint of sour cream. They turned out great, and I will make this again for sure!

So sorry, but this was a big pot of "mush".  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, as I had to cook it on slow for a longer time (instead of 45 mins on high).  The taste was ok, but no one ate it.

I liked this recipe a lot and will make it again to share at a potluck or just at home. I used a medium salsa and so adding sour cream as a garnish was a good idea for the kids.

Really good and a pot-luck hit!  I used a combo of tostada corn tortillas (already crisp but flat) and normal and used a can of cream of chicken with herbs,  and one cream of mushroom with garlic.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I had mixed reviews from family and friends.  A couple of people loved it.  The rest said it was just ok.  Maybe it is because all those who ate it grew up on real Mexican or Tex-Mex food and while this is a fairly good imitation, it is not the real thing.

Mmmmmm....cheesy!  I had to make my own salsa with rotel tomatoes, onions and green chilis because I didn't have enough salsa but it worked great!  I served it with some Bush's pinto beans, but next time I might just add them to the casserole because they rounded the meal out really well.

Very good, even for my picky eaters. I was a little worried about how my husband would feel about it but he LOVED it. I was so excited. This was one of the easiest meals I have ever made and will definatly make again.

We really enjoyed this.  I added about a cup of sour cream instead of the cream of chicken soup, and a can of refried beans to the meat.  I took it to a potluck and didn't take any home.

I used only 1 can of soup, cut the water down to 3/4c, added lots of chopped onions, and sour cream and my homemade salsa. I covered it in foil and baked it at 300 for 2 hours, instead of using the slow cooker. It was great! Thank you for this quick and easy recipe!

This was very good, great as is or could be modified by throwing in extras like olives, ortega chiles, etc...  This would even be great as a dip with chips.

I had been looking for a Mexican style dinner recipe to replace our boring tacos. This recipe was just what I was looking for. It was tasty and satisfied us all. However, the high sodium content of the soups, cheeses, and taco seasoning mix made it too salty for my taste. Next time I prepare this recipe I will use low sodium soups.

This was a good recipe and very easy, but I would definitely reduce the cheese by probably half.  It is a very rich meal...I would consider making it as an appetizer.  We just couldn't eat a whole plate full of it.

I used quite 3/4 # of lean beef and 3/4 # of ground turkey, and then more or less followed the recipe.  This was very good and would be something great to make when having a bunch of friends over for poker night or to watch the game.

This tasted okay, but it was not all that great. Too soupy for my taste. It probably needed more tortillas. It almost seemed more like a dip.

I made this in a baking dish,I forgot to put the salsa in but it turned out great anyway.My finicky husband really loved it. I might cut back a little on the cheese I put in cheese mixture and save more for the top.I also ended up using more than the 12 tortillas.

At first I was leery because I didn't think that using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups would make this taste anything like enchiladas, but to my surprise they did.  I'm gald I took the chance and tried this, they were really good and cheesy. the only thing I would change is doubling the meat because 1 lb. really didn't make to much. It was excellent, very tasty.

Yummo!  Everyone in my house loved this.  I did use flour tortillas as that's what we like, otherwise followed the recipe.  Will make this for a potluck sometime too.

This was a big hit for my family. The only changes were,I put it in the oven instead of the crock pot and added a can of Rotel. (We like things on the spicy side)My husband suggested that when I make it again I serve some dorito type chips with it and I will make it again, soon.

This was really delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I used half the amount of cheese and it was still plenty. I was surprised that the sauce was so tasty with the soup/salsa combinations. Be careful not to overcook or the tortillas will get mushy. I will definitely make this again!

I changed this recipe up a bit because of the ingredients I had on-hand. I think I will stick to it because it was surprisingly delicous
I used shredded chicken instead of beef, could easily be done with rotiserre chicken too
I used a can of Campbell's Ranchero Tomato Soup that I had in my pantry for months and no recipe to use it. It was Perfect for this recipe and gave it such great flavor. 
I used less cheese because I didnt have much on hand. I also used 1 1/2 cup 3 Cheese Crumbles + 1 cup shredded for the cheese mixture and I think it was really cheesy because it didnt disappear like the shredded does. I will use this again as well. 
Next time I will add some drained black beans or refried beans to give it even more flavor.

I love enchiladas, but my husband was getting burnt out on them.  I tried this recipe last night for dinner.  My entire family loved it, and my husband said it was the best enchiladas that he's ever had.  Very, very yummy!!

Recipe had the right idea for being simple, but the cooking time was not even close which could vary between each slow cooker.  I ended up having to cook it in the oven at 350 for 15 min to get it cooked in time. Would be awesome for an all day cooker I think though!

I didn't have beef, so I used 1/4 pound of ground turkey.  I used white bread instead of tortillas and since I didn't have cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup, I used French Onion and tomato soup.  Instead of water, I used beer and I had no taco seasoning so I used chili powder.  I used canned whole tomatoes instead of salsa and instead of cheese, I used yogurt.  It was awful!  
Actually, I made it according to the recipe and enjoyed it for what it was - an easy, tasty Mexican-style dish.  Changing one or two ingredients slightly is fine,  I just get irritated by people who change everything in the recipe around and then complain about the taste, or worse, don't make it at all but give it one star because it isn't what they consider "Mexican" enough.  If people want to change everything, they should submit their own recipe under a different name for the dish.

This is not Enchiladas. Taco seasoning does not make enchiladas nor does cream of anything soup. It sounds like a dish you would find at a large potluck get together, with a bunch of hungry men.

I read this recipe and used it for inspiration.  Hubs loved it!!!  I browned ground beef in a skillet using my own taco season mix.  I also used green enchilada sauce to mix with the soup.  I was not able to use my slow cooker so I decided to just bake in the oven.  I layer corn tortillas, meat, sauce, and cheese until I ran out of ingredients.  I baked until it was bubbly hot, added a little more cheese to melt on the top and served it out of the casserole as you would a lasagna.  I had guacamole, pico, and sour cream on the side.  What a great dinner and leftovers were not too shabby either.

This was good. The recipe calls for too much cheese. I only used half of the cheese required and was still too much. So next time, I will just one 8 oz package.

I have made this quite a few times and my family loves it. Normally I do enchiliadas in a pan and in the oven, which can be a lot of work. This is a quick, easy, and good way to do them with hardly any of the clean up afterwards.

I made a couple uh ohs while making this (like getting chicken taco seasoning instead of regular) but it came out AMAZING. I also read the reviews about adding more tortillas so I did. And I used more meat than suggested so I added more of my own seasoning like garlic powder and seasoned salt. 
 Everyone in my family raved about this dish and the next day they told me that they wanted me to make it again. I didn't lol. But still a month later at least once a week they mention it and how they want me to make it again.

This is a great recipe loved by everyone who I've made it for. The only changes I made to it was use a black bean salsa instead of a mild salsa and to top it off with corn kernels or corn salsa! It adds extra flavor to an already wonderful dish!

I read some of the reviews and decided to add additional tortillas, as recommended, however I felt I did not need to do that.  This meal was delicious and I would definitely make again.  I did substitute ground turkey instead of using ground beef, and added chopped onion and minced garlic.  I also added sliced olives in between layers.

I made this recipe exactly as its written, except for the water. Use 3/4 cup of water and I wound up needing 16 tortillas and the cook time was closer to 2 hours. However it was delicious,  you can add what you want but this recipe is great as is. Thank you.

Family favorite.  I have made this dish several times using the my own taco seasoning and using only one can of Cream if Chicken soup.  Not a fan of canned soup thinking of a healthy replacement.

I was very happy to find this slow cooker recipe.  It's much easier than rolling individual enchiladas and baking them.  The one change I made however, was to substitute 1 10 oz. can of red enchilada sauce for the cream of mushroom soup.  I think this gives it a much more traditional Mexican flavor, as well as reducing some calories and fat.

Delicious! I couldn't find the corn tortillas so I used flour  ones.  I also had to leave it in the slow cooker for an extra 15 minutes.  So good,  had to go back for seconds.

My son loved this and was eating it before it went in the oven. And ate most of it when it came out. Me...not so much. But he is already asking me to make it again and it was cheap and easy. If you like Taco Bell,  you'll probably like this.

Cooked on high for one hour, was still not completely heated through. Pretty salty.  Did not hold together well, a little runny. Presentation on the plate was not pretty, taste was okay.

I gave it four stars because I think this recipe is a smart idea, I would never have thought about making enchiladas in a slow cooker.   I modified just a little to suit my taste and I baked the tortillas in the oven to get them crisp first and I only used cream of chicken soup instead of using the cream of mushroom.   I also put in a can of enchilada sauce in the browned hamburger before layering and it was delicious.

Very good and easy to make but rather salty.  Next time we're gonna try using low-sodium soup rather than regular.

Saw this recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand so I thought why not?  We really did like it, however mine seemed a bit more 'sloppy' than the picture shows.  This is a recipe that could be changed up if you'd like to try it a little differently. The only thing I did different was I had a Poblano pepper, so I cored it, sliced it in two, and placed it between two of the layers. 
We will try this recipe again.  Maybe I'll try some of the others suggestions.

Excellent recipe!  I made this late at night for a couple of friends and they loved it!  (As did I)  I used 1 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef, seasoned the way I do with most of my Mexican style dishes: cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and chopped onions (fresh onion is better, but for a late night meal, I used the bottled).  Also, I used flour tortillas, mainly because I can't stand corn tortillas.  I imagine the meal would have more of a crunch with corn tortillas, but there were zero complaints.  Salsa verde was used, and I shredded some sharp cheddar vs. using the pre-shredded, powder coated stuff (though, in a pinch, use the bagged).  Prep time really did take all of MAYBE 20 minutes, and 45 minutes to simmer in the crockpot.  Next time, I may try adding some crunch, without corn tortillas of course.

Absolutely amazing!  Thanks for the great idea!

Who would have thought you could make enchiladas in a slowcooker!!  This was a HIT at my teacher crockpot luncheon!  I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I doubled everything, used a half and half mix of ground beef and ground venison, one can of fiesta cheddar condensed soup, two cans of cream of chicken, and one can of cream of mushroom.  I did not add the shredded cheese to the soup mixture because we were out of shredded cheese and I was making this recipe the night before.  I did a thick layer of cut up corn tortillas on the bottom, a layer of the ground meat and onion mixture, a layer of soup, a layer of sliced olives, repeat.  I ended with a thick layer of tortillas on top, and then the next morning added a good layer of shredded cheddar.  I put the whole crockpot in the fridge over night, and then the next morning put it on low in the teacher lunchroom at school.  After reading some of the comments about the tortillas getting soggy, I was somewhat concerned, but they were perfect!  We topped with sour cream, and it was amazing!  Thank you for the recipe!!  :)

this is tasty! Added black beans and tried to double layer using corn tortillas as mentioned In the reviews, but it still collapsed to mush. I'll layer differently next time. The hubby however LOVES this dish... He really loves it. I served it to him  with avo-tomato salad, Spanish rice and baked sweet potatoes. Garnished with two nacho chips and a dollup of Greek yogurt. This was an absolute hit!

The family loved this!  I took the recommendation of other reviewers and used 2 lbs. of ground beef.  I added a small can of diced green chilies to the cheese/soup mix and included black beans in the layers.  We served on lettuce with pico de gallo, guacamiole and sour cream.  Tastes great topped with crushed tortilla chips, it needs that crunchy texture.  I cooked it for 3 hours.

I made this exactly like the recipe, and I loved it.  The only reason I have to get it four stars is because the rest of my family thought it was too cheesy.  I think a little more meat would taste great as well.

Easy and great for family with kids. Everyone loved it.Line your crockpot with a liner for easy clean up.  Since hamburger so expensive right now I did add ground turkey to my hamburger to make it go farther.

I am gluten and dairy free so I had to adapt it. It was fabulous! I am able to eat goat cheese so I subbed cheese for goat cheddar and Trader Joes Sliced Dutch Goat cheese. I can also handle the Kraft Brand 0% lactose cheese in small doses so I added some of that. I googled substatutes for 'cream of anything' soups and adapted that by making it with Gluten free flour and a milk substatute.  More work but SO worth it!! Everyone loved it and am the only one with food issues! 
Because of all of the adaptations that I had to do for dietary reasons, I chose to make two batches so that I could freeze one for another day and save time in the long run. It worked great!

I made this recipe as is to check it out first. It was a little runny and the corn tortillas got lost somewhere in the cheesy mixture. Next time I will double the corn tortillas, use 1 1/2 lbs meat, reduce the cheese to 3 cups, use one can of soup, and add black beans, rice, and fresh cilantro. Mine cooked perfect in the slow cooker in one hour but I'd say it would cook in the same time in the over & would probably be easier to serve from a casserole dish. Overall, a great recipe & idea!

We loved this recipe.  I did make some changes after the first time of making this.  First I sprayed  the crockpot with pam, and instead of the cream of soup, I used enchilada sauce and Mexican blend cheeses while layering. I also used thicker layers of corn tortillas because it gets a little mushy otherwise.  Delicious!

This was very easy to make. I thought it was good, but none of the other members in my family liked it.  Maybe adding some re fried beans to the layer would have made a difference for them, but I will not be making it again since I was solo on this one.

I made this about a week ago. I didn't put all the cheese into the mix but, sprinkled some top each layer. People are right,the soft tortillas kinda become muck, but still the flavor was good. My daughter who doesn't eat much tomato sauce stuff was afraid she wouldn't like it but, as I old her, that isn't a problem with the cream soups added. We topped it with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. To quote everyone, they thought it was "the bomb" Next time-and there will be a next time-I will use the hard corn shells. Gave it a 4 only because of the tortillas, the taste gets a 5.
I think after using the hard shells it may go to a 5.

I loved it! Modified it quite a bit, but I will make it again using a similar version to this one. I just have to use more vegetables than what is called for. First of all, I used lean ground turkey instead of beef. I did not use any soup, I used canned enchilada sauce. I added chopped spinach, drained black beans, drained diced tomatoes and plenty do garlic and whit onions to the cooked meat and let it season through. I wanted to use taco seasoning but I wasn't about to go to the store just for that, so I used fajita seasoning instead. After this cooked for about 30 minutest, I layered it with corn tortillas (4 with each layer), black olives, and chopped green olives.  I poured the remainder of the enchilada sauce on top and let it cook on low until it began to show a sign of simmering. After this, I put it on warm. It taste delicious! You can add more seasonings to your liking for added flavor. I did end up adding a sprinkle of garlic powder at the end and more cheese. The next time I will use chicken breast with this recipe, add the vegetables listed and sautéed mushrooms along with the recipe instead.

I have used this for what was called "stacked enchiladas".
The only difference, was a tin foil "T" Placed in the bottom of the crock pot, so that after cooking it can be lifted out of the pot placed on a platter and cut like a cake!To make the "T" I use heavy duty foil folded in to thirds making sure it is long enough that I have at least 6 extra inches to roll back to pot to form a handle for lifting I also can leave the tortillas whole and use my small crock pot.
But any way that you do it this one is a great recipe and a keeper. Make it your own! Stack and layer your favorite ingredients. Vegetarian works well beans cheese maybe a few veggies of choice Yum. If veggies are raw and you are going to try this method you might want to saute just a bit because this is a "heat " method not "cook". If you need to cook adjust cooking time .

YUM!!! This was really good and SOOOOOOO EASY!!!! I really didn't change anything besides only using a 1/2 cup a water, but i only did that cause I had dumped in my whole (16oz) Jar of Pace chunky salsa. Also i just used cheddar cheese, i'm sure pepper jack would be great too for a little spice! Husband said it was "Awesome"!

I changed the serving size to 10 because I have alot of mouths to feed. The meat/taco seasoning with the water was a litte runny, but I just figured the tortillas would soak it up, which it did. I didnt change anything on it till I tried the original first, and I'm glad I did! It was very good. I did let it cook longer then 1 hour because I increased the amount. Will make it again!

I really enjoyed this recipe the way I cooked it and so did my husband! I didn't give it a 5 because I made changes.  I used chicken and cooked 6 thighs in broth. Drained and shredded the chicken, added the taco seasoning and water and let simmer. I followed the other reviews and used only 2 cups of Mexican blend cheese in the soup mix. Something I really think helped reduce mush was using a DRAINED can of Rotel instead of salsa. Also, I did not use extra tortillas and don't think I needed to.  The final thing which I think made a huge difference was I cooked it in the oven!  350 for probably 40 minutes is alll you need. I used a 9 by 9 square baker. I will definitely make this again.

These are a favorite at our house and with company.  I also switch to flour tortillas, and add chicken, corn, black beans sometimes.  Very good.

My family loved it and so did I. I will definitely make this recipe in the future again. When I was cooking my ground beef I went ahead and added diced onions and garlic. I feel like garlic and onions can  enhance any meal. I also read up on some reviews and used less water, added more tortillas.

Although I wouldn't call it enchiladas, I really liked it and my boyfriend said it was just ok.  The only changes I made:  I used flour tortillas because that's what I had and I cooked this in the oven instead of the slow cooker, I only use the slow cooker for all day cooking.  I like that this was a quick meal with stuff I already had in the house.  This is a very good recipe to change to your liking.

I saved this recipe, bought the stuff to make it, then read some of the reviews and got nervous and almost didn't make it. I'm glad I decided to go ahead. I'm also glad I decided to ignore the many reviews that required multiple changes in order to like it. So I just followed the recipe exactly and crossed my fingers. My family loved it. As is. I think mine took longer to cook, but that could be because I had fixed the beef and taco seasoning part the day before and it was cold when I did the layering. Or it could be my crockpot. At any rate, I think it cooked about 2 hours. I served it when the cheese on top got melted. I had leftover tortillas cut up so I used those to make homemade corn tortilla chips and my family devoured it all. Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

I substituted the Cream of Mushroom soup for another Cream of Chicken.  I also baked at 350F for 40min. as another reviewer stated.  This seemed like a better way than the slow cooker.  Great comfort food.

A spoonful of ground Cumin powder added to the ground beef along with homemade (less salt, more flavor)seasoning is delicious.  Leave out the cream soup, and use Jalapeno Cheddar soup or regular shredded cheese instead.  I also use 2 flour tortillas in each layer and leave them whole because they fit perfectly in my large round crock pot. Less liquid will save the tortillas from turning to mush, And use a crock pot liner to save cleaning.

Delicious!  Don't use all the cheese.  I think I used under 3 cups.   I used plain shredded cheddar.  Also, added black beans to the meat and used some extra tortillas.  Still very moist.  And of course Seth "needed" plain yogurt on his.

I added a can of drained black beans to the meat and reduced the amt of salsa slightly.  Cut cheese to 3 cups. Made it with 5 layers of tortillas and 4 layers of 'stuff'.  Was still pretty goopy but tasted great.  Served with sour cream and salad.  Next time will add some sautéed peppers and more tortillas.

Family really loved this but the time was way off. I cooked on high for an hour and they said it was only lukewarm not hot. Need to cook at least an hour and a half maybe two. But other than in it not being hot, both of my grown sons gave it two thumbs up and asked to be added to their favorites.

Made this exactly as is.  I liked it, my husband and daughter did not. The title should be enchilada casserole.  Loaded with sodium, but then I would not eat this very often.  Thought it was great for breaakfast the next day with some overeasy eggs on top.  I agree with some other reviews which suggest using enchilada sauce instead of the cream soups.

Very nice but really, as written waaay too much sodium. I made with low sodium soups and lower sodium taco mix and it tasted really good. I didn't use as much cheese either (2 cups total), but only because I didn't buy enough when at the store. It didn't make a big difference. Davidbooks and I enjoyed this very much.

Great easy recipe for an effortless dinner. I increased the beef to about 1 1/2 pounds, used fire roasted corn salsa, threw in a large can of drained black beans and spooned canned enchilada sauce on the top layer of tortillas before I put in the final cheese. Perfect!

My 7 year-old has never cleaned his plate when eating something new. He was smiling ear to ear (he's a tough customer).This was delicious! I altered the recipe a little. I used 3/4 cup of water, 1 1/2 pound of ground beef, 2 cups of cheese, added 1/2 can of black beans, and I increased the layers of corn tortillas. I can't wait to share this with my friends and extended family :-).

I made this for a pot luck, and it turned out pretty good. This is the type of dish that actually is better the. Next day. I used extra cheese and salsa based on some people. Who said it was bland. The ingredients arent exact and its better to just eyeball it.
I also think the next time I make this,  I will double up on the tortilla layers......overall,  pretty good.

Did the recipe exactly as is except for using flour tortillas instead of corn and I'll stick with the flour. The only thing I will change next time is adding more meat. My husband even loved it.

My family loved it!  I changed a couple items.  I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, and I used 2 lbs of it, while keeping all the other amounts the same. Well, except for the cheese.  Only used 2 cups of that.  Very yummy!  Will be making it again.

Another conflicted rating.  I do like this recipe a lot....for a crockpot enchilada.  I feel I have to reserve a 5 star rating for real enchiladas.

If you have a hankerin' for a Mexican food casserole that you can just throw in the crockpot, this is a great option.  It's easy.  It's tasty.  It will satisfy your need for a Mexican dish without the work to make real enchilada.  The ingredients almost scared me away because soups didn't sound much like a Mexican dish ingredient.  I'm glad I gave it a try.  Have made it multiple times, and the fam likes it.

This sounds so good I will make it today.  Thanks for all the busy cooks suggesting tweaks.  I have long made a great Mexican dip in my crock pot with many of the same elements - just without the tortillas. It also goes to potlucks well, served with "scoop" chips, but also lends itself to folding into a tortilla as a quesadilla filling.

Really good and easy.  Used 1.5 pounds of ground venison and more taco seasoning, otherwise followed.  Will make again

This recipe is awesome and super easy to make. I made this as a quick fix for my family of 4 teenagers and one additional family member so I made 4x the servings to begin with. When I served it, I went to the back bedroom where my sister was on her computer taking an online quiz - NO EXAGGERATION - from the time I went back to serve her and wait for her to taste test the dinner was gone - as in the entire pot was empty. I didn't even get to taste it. The apologies were NOT sincere for not leaving me any but it is definitely staying on the keepers list. Great recipe!

I would leave a longer cooking time in the slow cooker -- the center of the meal was not hot in an hour -- and the cheese on top was not completely melted.

I did use 2 pounds of hamburger instead of 1 pound.  I didn't read the directions very well because I stirred the soups into the hamburger along with the slasa and taco seasoning before I realized my mistake.  The layering of cheese, tortilla, and meat still worked out fine, cant imagine it made much of a difference.  I totally omitted the water (which Im glad I did)  Since I had made a mistake I guess the consistency of my meat was a little different.  Turned out great though.  Cooked it on low for 3 hours.

Excellent and easy dinner.  Took 15 minutes at most to prep and then let the slow cooker do the rest.  Also, it made a ton of leftovers.

This was very good, but the cook time in the recipe isn't long enough...or maybe I layered it too deep.  In any event, it was fantastic, fed several people, and I would definitely make this again.

Easy to prepare, can be done in a slow cooker or an oven.  I taught my brother how to make this dish and he made it for the rest of the family a week later and they enjoyed the enchiladas as well.

To cut back on calories, use the healthy choice or fat-free cream soups and add extra salsa for more flavor.

Had this last night, prepared according to directions shown here. It wasn't bad, but I also didn't feel it was anything special. Needs some additional seasoning or ingredients to give it more life. This one won't make my recipe book.

At first I was skeptical about the combination of soups and salsa as the sauce, but let me tell you, it was FABULOUS!!!  I didn't change any of the ingredients at all, but I did make it in the oven in a 13x9 pan v. a crock pot.  There were ZERO leftovers and even my picky 2 year old ate it!  Loved this recipe!!

Oh, yeah...!  I score again at the potluck luncheon, thanks to Allrecipes.com.  Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe.  I doubled the recipe and let it sit overnight in the Crockpot in the fridge as another reviewer had done.  I did not double the cheese, though, and I had a pint of sauce left over that I did not use (which tastes great with tortilla chips, by the way).  Thanks again!

The corn tortillas turned out spongy in the middle, and hard and chewy on the edges.  Not enough meat, not enough tortillas, there was a lot of soup/cheese mixture for the amounts of meat and tortillas used.  Would have been better with flour tortillas and some canned or frozen corn to give it a crunch texture of some sort since everything in this is soft.  I recommend BURRITO PIE from this site over this any day.

I thought this was great.  Everyone loved it!  I did add an extra pound of meat. And, I used flour tortillas instead, because that's what I had on hand.  It wasn't mushy at all. This is a good recipe.

Very yummy and easy.  The cheese/soup/salsa mixture produces a lot of filler.  I will use more tortillas and meat the next time around.

Pretty good!  I changed some things based on other reviews though.  I used 2lbs of ground turkey instead of beef, doubled the tortillas and added a can of black beans.  Also I baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for 50 minutes.  All in all it was pretty good and my picky family ate it.  This dish was easy and I would probably make it again.

Made just like the recipe calls for, it is a tasty dish. I used sugestions from several different reviews, adjusted the flavors to my own family's tastes and made it fantastic.  Try it with chicken instead of ground beef!

I made this dish for Tex-Mex Tuesday and my entire family agreed it is a keeper! I made a couple of modifications per other reviews I read: I used a packet of taco seasoning and 3/4 cup water. I mixed 12-oz regular Pace Picante sauce with 1 can cream of mushroom soup and about 2 cups of Mexican blend shredded cheese, then sprinkled about 1 cup of cheese over the final tortilla layer. Even though I left my enchiladas cooking for 1 1/2 hours and they were bubbly around the edges, the cheese between the layers didn't melt. It still tasted just fine. I'll definitely make this again soon. It was easy to assemble using ingredients I had on hand, and it didn't take long to cook. This dish goes well with a tossed salad and Spanish rice.

Fantastic! As a New Mexican, good enchiladas are important to me. These are good and flavorfull. Can make as spicy or whimpy as you like. Very creamy. Too often enchiladas are dry.  These are perfect.

These were fantastic! I added peppers and onions to mine as well. The only thing i would do is let it cool down for awhile before eating it because it was mush taking it out right away i wanted more structure for the corn tortillas but overall amazing!

I followed another reviewer's idea and did not use my slow cooker.  I cooked in lg. casserole dish for 40 minutes in oven at 375.  I also used ground turkey and fat free versions of the soups, low carb tortillas and added a layer of fat free refried beans.  It turned out great.  It was great comfort food, my kitchen smelled lovely.  Because I used the cheese as called for, I probably cancelled out the effects of the healthier substitutes, but I didn't notice the taste difference at all.  You can't go wrong when you smother things in cheese!

Cooked chuck roast with soups, taco seasoning, water and 1/4 onion in slowcooker for the day.  Then scooped out beef and shredded it, added rest of ingredients to sauce (1/2 the cheese), then layered in Pyrex (double the tortillas) and cooked for 20 minutes.  Served with a side of roasted (olive oil, salt, pepper) brussel sprouts.  YUM.

Sorry, but this was just edible. When I read the recipe it sounded good and with so many high ratings I just had to try it. Unfortunately, none of us cared for it. We'll stick to other Enchilada recipes. There as some good ones on this site.

After reading the reviews I went ahead and double stacked the corn tortillas. Worked perfectly!  We served over rice.  My kids devoured it and asked for 2nds.  To me, that's a winning recipe!

Had this for dinner last night, very tasty.  It did take longer than an hour to get warm to the middle (thankfully I planned on it).  Also, I followed the directions on the package of taco seasoning and only added 3/4 cup of water and simmered it down.  I didn't use all of the cheese either, to cut down on some of the fat.  Will diffinitely make again.

Great recipe! After reading all the reviews, I did change a couple of things. I used a lb of ground turkey and added a half a lb of ground beef, with a small can of chopped green chilies. I also added a can of tri-beans (black, pinto, kidney) and instead of salsa a can of rotel. I also used flour tortillas per some other reviews and it turned out fantastic!! I thought it was going to be a bit soupy at first but the texture was perfect for us. We'll see how it is tomorrow. I might try it in the oven next time in a pyrex dish for ease of cutting and for presentation.

Gooy. To me that mean's it's not home-cooking with "real" ingredients. At 1 hour it was still cool in the middle.

I had my doubts about this recipe when I saw the mixture of soups and salsa. But then something incredible happened during that hour in the slow cooker that made my taste buds very happy!

Very good. I made a few changes -- instead of buying a jar of chunky salsa, I made my own (onion, garlic, mushroom, apple, all fried up together, ground cumin and cloves, as well as a drained can of diced tomatoes and a drained can of black beans). I also used lean ground turkey and it was delicious, not to mention cheaper at the store than ground beef.

My family loved this!  I followed the advice of others here and doubled the tortillas.  I will cut back to 2-3 C of cheese next time, maybe add a bit more meat, but this was delish!  I wish I had read all the way to the end before I put it in the crockpot.  Why use a crock pot when it only needs to cook for an hour, unless you don't want to start up the oven in the summertime possibly...

This dish was so delicious and took no time to make. My husband raved on it. I added a small can of green chiles to give it a bit more punch. Next time I'll make it with chopped, cooked chicken instead of the ground beef.

This was good, but has a lot of fat and sodium. I even used low sodium and 98% fat free soups and WW mexican blend cheese.  I reduced the amount of corn tortillas used and reduced the amount of cheese used by 1/4.  It's a keeper, but I'll need to find ways to try to slim it down further.

Holy cow this one is good.  Picky husband loved it.  Said "I'd eat that stuff cold!"  (Huge compliment)  Made as written except only used 3 cups cheese (really 3 cups is a lot of cheese) and I pureed the chunky salsa because I have little ones.  The tortillas end up tasting like masa on tamales.  Fantastic.  Next time will try adding black beans to the meat mixture just to stretch it a little.  Although this made plenty of food!

Easy to double & cooks well on low for 2 hours if you need to leave it for more time. This is a quick, easy solution to supper after practice or a ballgame! We serve it with corn chips and mexican rice.

Very, very good!  I used 1lb of beef and then added a can of black beans to make it more filling.  Doubled up on the tortillas on that layer. Also used my own seasoning instead of the taco packet. We enjoyed it very much.

My husband and I loved this! I'm from south Texas and was very skeptical about soup and salsa in enchiladas and cooking it all in slow cooker, but it was delicious! I used 2 lbs of ground beef and 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of the cream of mushroom. I also heated a little bit of oil in a frying pan and dipped the tortillas in for a few seconds before placing them in the crockpot. Just enough to cover the tortilla and get it wet, but not long at all otherwise it turns out crispy like a chalupa. This is what my grandma does when making enchiladas, so that the tortilla doesn't break when rolling; I read the reviews that mentioned crumbling so I tried this and didn't have any problems. Great recipe, definitely a keeper!

We loved this meal, it's sooo easy!  I made a couple of changes, I added a can of rinsed, drained black beans and used frozen, pre-cooked, diced chicken, whatever amount I had left in the bag. This is what I did: Place a tortilla in the bottom of the slow cooker, put a layer of chicken, then a layer of black beans, sprinkled some taco seasoning on top then put a layer of the cheese mixture.  Kept layering until all ingredients were used up and finished with a little leftover cheese.  Served this over white rice that was leftover from the night before.  This was so good, I can't wait to make it again.  Like others said, you wouldn't think that the soup makes sense, but it does, just try it!

Awesome recipe. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I changed the recipe slightly and added 1 can enchilada sauce to 2 lbs. of browned and drained hamburger, plus a half can of water. I used only 1 can soup and added 1/2 c. sour cream plus a half a cup of salsa to the soup. Flour tortilla's work fine in this recipe if you spray them with cooking spray on each side, bake at 350 degrees for 5 minutes, cool, then tear them up for the recipe. My family loved this. Comfort food for sure. We sprinkled Doritos on top.

This is a great comfort food recipe! The hubs loves it and it's so easy! I did use corn tortillas and it can seem like a bunch of mush, but it sure taste good! I added a can of black beans to the mixture as well. So yummy- such a great go-to for something easy.

Very good!  And left overs were gobbled up the next day!  I used some other suggestions on using healthy choice campbells soups.  I mixed a can of fat free refried beans in with the hamburger.  I layered it into a 9 x 13 pan, made ahead of time and stuck it in the fridge.  An hour before hubby came home baked it at 350 for an hour.  Very good with sour cream!

A real good slowcooker meal!  Easy with a busy life style and the kids loved it!  I added veggies (spinage, black olives and bell peppers) to give it more texture and less muss!

Wonderful recipe.  Easy to make and a huge hit.  I would make 1.5 lbs of taco meat instead of one because you seem to run out before you are out of tortillas.  Can be used as a dip--put nachos under it!

I thought this was fairly awesome.  I was a little worried because I was making it for the first time for a work function, and I do prefer to test out recipes before testing them on other humans.  These went over well anyway.  I did double the recipe and it was almost gone before I even got a chance to try it.  I used cream of chicken and cream of celery as one of the girls in the office is allergic to mushrooms(and i don't particularly like CoM soup.)  I used one jar of the Desert Pepper black bean and corn salsa (medium) and one can of mild enchilada sauce (store didn't have any medium that wasn't CRAZY salty.)  i also used the mexican cheese.  I added a can of black beans and I doubled up the tortillas as others mentioned previously.  They weren't super spicy but weren't at all bland either.  It is unusual for me to not add spices to something and just trust it won't taste like air... I went for it this time and am very happy I did.  I will definitely make this again for myself.  Oh and I don't eat beef so I did make this with ground turkey.  Nobody knew.  ;-)

I made this for a faculty feed at my school.  I modified the original recipe by using burrito spice instead of taco and enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I added olives to the mix.  I also followed the advice of others and added no water and layered the corn tortillas about 3 layers at a time.  This recipe was absolutely not mushy and tasted very good.  The word quickly spread at work to get to the teachers lounge before it was gone.  I had no leftovers at all.  Several people suggested that I could make this any time to bring to school and not wait for special occasions.  I will make it again!

This recipe was amazingly easy and very very tasty. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Highly recommended to try this. I am just beginning to start learning how to cook so this was a great start for my first attempt.

I adjusted by cooking with the taco seasoning as directed on pack, had 1/2 can left over cream of mushroom soup instead of the full can, used half salsa and 1/2 pico de gallo (which has jalepenos)used about 3 cups of cheese (1/2 mexican blend 1/2 Quesadilla)with this I figured the amount of beef and cheese mixture by placing the amount I would want on a nacho on each piece of tortilla.  I kinda of took the spoon across to blend it together. I also cooked this in the oven on 350 for 40min. in a 13x9 casserole dish.  My husband took it to work (minus my test dish)and the guys offered to pay for me to make it again:) I would say this was an awesome easy dish.

This was a flavorful dish. After reading the other reviews, I doubled the layers of tortillas, and they didn't get soggy. My husband thought the flavor was like a popular Mexican restaurant's food.  However, I prepped the ingredients earlier that day and refrigerated them until I was ready to put in the slow cooker - unfortunately, the ingredients didn't fully warm through even after 2 hours in the slow cooker.

I followed the recipe on these except for two exceptions, I used 24 tortillas instead of 10.  I did NOT add any water to the taco meat except during cooking the meat to cook the taco season in.  They were GREAT!  I will be making this one again!

YUMMY and EASY recipe! I had to be somewhere for 2 hours before dinner and couldn't monitor the crockpot. So I cooked on low for those 2 hours and it was cooked perfectly!  

I used chicken, a 10 oz can enchilada sauce in place of the chunky salsa, Healthy Request soups and 2% cheese.

Phenomenal!  My personal changes; sauteed onions and garlic, then added the beef.  Omitted the extra water and used a can of black beans instead.  Used the "healthy request" versions of the soups.  I used a fantastic salsa (Desert Pepper brand; Roasted Corn and Black Bean salsa) and added a bit of cumin to taste.  The flavors really melded after 90 minutes on high in the slow cooker.  Delicious!!

This is a very flexible recipe. I have made it as is (and as recommended by others). Most recently, I happened to have a few chicken breasts in the freezer, which I used in place of ground beef. And I had lots of part skim mozzarella, which i used in place of cheddar. I added a small can of diced green chilles and, my goodness, it was quite delicious. I'm about to make it again tonight. Even when I use the low fat versions of the soup mixes, it's still a winner.

This was okay.  I will make it again but its not something I will probably crave.  Way too much cheese though, it can be cut down by at least a cup.  Adding sour cream to the top and some olives and green onion made it yummy.

This was a winner with all my kiddos.  I used corn tortillas and added olives and black beans.  I gave the kids fritos scoops to use instead of a fork/spoon.  Definately will make this again!

At first, I read the ingredient and I didn't think it will turned out so well.  It was very good simple recipe.  I unused one can of chicken soup and a small can of tomato soup.  I used a roast and black beans instead of ground beef.  I recommend serving with sour cream !

This was really excellent.  I made it exactly the first time and it was really good.  I needed to make it again for a sort of last minute family meal with my parents.  I am never sure how many people will be at my parents house (siblings, their significant others/spouses, etc...) so I wanted to make more than the recipe called for.  I added a big can of black beans to the beef, and used 2 taco seasoning packets.  I did double layers with the tortillas, and I threw in some extra cheese (I bought a big bag, and just used it all, rather than having a handful left over).  It was REALLY good with the addition of the beans.  Turns out we had a ton of leftovers, though, b/c it was only my dad, my hubby, toddler, & myself who ate.  The leftovers were still really good the next day.

The whole family really enjoyed this recipe. I will be making it again! The changes I made were... I left out the salsa (husband does not like) and used canned tomatoes instead. But we had salsa on the side if anyone wanted to add it. I used turkey hamburger instead of beef (personal perference). I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and none of the cream of chicken (didn't have it) and last I used only shredded cheddar cheese. We had sour cream also to add if desired.

I made this last weekend and we really enjoyed it....it will be a keeper for sure.  I did however make some minor changes.  I only used half of the water in the meat and I also added chopped onion, a can of bush's pinto beans (with juices) and 2 cans of ortega diced green chiles.  To keep the corn tortillas from becoming "mush" I fried them in a little veg. oil and drained them on paper towels....you could also spray them the pan with nonstick spray instead of using the oil or spray each tortilla and bake them until just slightly browned.  I also used black sliced olives.  It was very yummy...served it with spanish rice.

I tried it with leftover chicken. My family LOVED it! I doubled the recipe thinking of lunch the next day- I still had no leftovers! I also used it on a ball game night, put it in the crock-pot, went to the game, came home to dinner. It was nice to not have to assemble it before work! One tip, mine did turn out pretty hot, if you don't like med/hot spicy try using a little less taco seasoning.

This was really good. I changed only one thing, I used 1/3 can tomato soup in place of cream of chicken soup for 2 servings. Actually, there was one other thing I changed as well. I used tomatillo sauce in place of regular chunky salsa. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good and easy. I modified it quite a bit - used double the meat and used chicken instead of ground beef. I also doubled the taco seasoning (next time I'll use 1.5 times the amount instead). I used low fat soups and cheese, and I cut the cheese in half. It needed a few more tortillas. It was perfect! I served with olives, tomatoes, lettuce and extra salsa.

I have four kids and finding something
that everyone likes is sometimes difficult, but this was a hit with 
everyone.  "A Keeper" as my husband
calls it!  The only change I made was
I didnt use the crockpot, I just baked
it in a casserole dish.

I made these last night and they were a hit. I have to admit I was a bit leary about using soup in enchiladas but was pleasantly surprised.

This really is fantastic! Every time I make this it's devoured. Always have the recipe ready if you take it to a function of some sort. I also use flour tortillas rather than corn.

This recipe has potential but definitely needs many alterations. The flavor was good but the cook time in a 5qt crock pot/slow cooker on high definitely needs to be at least 2-3 hrs not one. It was not even hot at one and I had to microwave plates an additional 2-3 minutes to get the food hot. Also it is very saucy and adding another pound of meat or 1/2 lb of meat and some black beans could have rectified that issue.

good, made with chicken and added black beans, cooked in crockpot for about 4 hours. then shredded the chicken and rolled the mix into corn torts, sprinkled some cheese on it and threw It in the oven. I have leftover "filling". my husband said he liked it better as a dip than as an enchilada. He even poured some leftover filling over a hot dog and loved it.

I have made this dish several times for potluck and I never have any to bring home.  I usually stick to the recipe, but on occasion when I have mexican friends over, I'll add a layer of fresh sliced jalapenos to the recipe.

Wow! Tthis was amazing! Made a few tweaks from others. Had Turkey burger thawed already, browned it with a small yellow onion diced and minced garlic, & added some Tajin spice, then taco seasoning. Used only 1 can of cream of chicken, used 1 can or Rotel instead of salsa, added 1 can of black beans, a little more cheese, and topped with olives. I ate 3/5ths of it, could hardly stop it was so good. Next time I might try adding a can of tomato sauce. This is now a staple on the menu

I am a novice cook to say the least (although I must say I am finding I have quite the knack for it), so this recipe was excellent for me. It was extremely simple and I happened to have most of the ingredients in my pantry already. I did follow some of my fellow reviewers’ views by adding a can of drained black beans to the soup mixture to layer and black olives on top. The dish was far from goopy. One of my renters are my can of cream of chicken soup so I had to improvise and create my own mock condensed soup with chicken stock and other ingredients. The only other issue I ran into was cook time. It took A LOT longer than the 1 hr 45 cook time listed on the recipe. Truth be told I personally was not too too impressed with the outcome but EVERYONE in my household (my husband,  my three renters, and my VERY picky 4 year old) totally raved about it. It was one of their favorite dishes I’ve made so far!

I am a Mexican food snob. Since we are Hispanic everyone knows that you’re raised to cook from scratch everything including tortillas. Yeah right. So when I saw this recipe using soup,  taco seasoning and salsa I wanted to try it. I like to taste everyone else’s recipes or Mexican dishes. I followed the recipe to a T did not add any other spices like or oregano, garlic, cominos,  etc.  we loved it! I didn’t put it in the slow cooker since the time was an hour or less I just stuck it in the oven at 3:50 until it was heated through. That was the only difference. Served it with salad tossed with tomatoes and sliced avocados. Make it easier. No need to make comment about plastic ingredients, just don’t make it. If the recipe doesn’t call for all day crock pot cooking make it ahead of time and stick it in the oven when you come home, or don’t make it! Love the recipe and will make it again. Thank you!

I did like this recipe, however I will be making some changes next time. I didn’t find that the one lb of ground beef was enough, and I will reduce the amount of water used for the taco seasoning. I will also add cilantro and maybe green chilies, but overall, it was good and my family really enjoyed it.

I was anxious to try this easy enchilada recipe but have changes and suggestions.  Though I used 80-85% lean ground beef it needed to be drained before proceeding which isn't called for in the recipe.  Would use triple amount of ground beef and two chopped onions when sautéing beef.  There is no substance to the enchilada for lack of meat. Far too much water is called for so I boiled out 90%.  In addition, the finished product was barely warm at the end of one hour cooking.  Had to microwave portions to enjoy.  Flavor very appealing but have another slow cooker recipe I've used before and would again.  This one is in file 13.

Husband loved it. It's a keeper. Very quick to make and it is done is 1 hr in cooker. I tweeked it a bit by reducing water to 3/4 cup and added a can of Zesty Black beans. It's the kind of recipe that you can dress up or down.

I cooked it for longer than it said because it did not look quite done. This would also stand as an amazing dip. My husband suggested adding quinoa to it for an extra texture but we destroyed all of it. Also delicious with eggs.

I've never had enchiladas without enchilada sauce. These were pretty good, I have to admit. I did add black olive slices to them

I added a can of drained black beans to the original recipe. Turned out great. Perfect for company as no last minute stuff to do. Just put the sour cream on the table. Will definitely fix again. We loved it.

Followed the recipe as is. Tasted good, but seemed more like a dip once all was said and done.  For the caloric intake, feel like it should have been heartier.

This is very similar to the enchilada casserole my mother taught me to make. Very strange to have no enchilada sauce in it, however it tastes very similar. Definitely will try again with some tweaks.  Love the crockpot and the easy clean up.

I followed the recipe but instead of beef I used ground turkey and it came out great!  I made it for a pot luck we had at our church and everyone that tried it told me it was delicious !!  I let them know it was a recipe from all recipe.com.

I thought it was very salty but the rest of family loved it. You can find sodium reduced soup to use so next time will try that.
Did not use salsa but actual enchilada sauce which made it taste great. And yes, you need a whole shredded bag, or a big block of cheese to make 4 cups but worth it..

OMG!! This was great! The flavor and texture were fantastic. I didn't change anything (accept more cheese to the top) to this recipe. My kids (7 & 10) could not stop eating it. Almost ate the whole pan.  

I was nervous when I saw the Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom soup as one of the ingredients. But, if I didn't tell you what was in it. You would never know. 

 I can't wait to make it again and try it with chicken. 

Treat yourself and try this dish. You will not regret it.

Easy, quick, and delicious.  Next time I will use more hamburger meat (maybe another 1/2 lb.).  My husband commented that this was a recipe to keep, and my son-in-law went back for seconds and thirds!

Rave reviews from my (picky) peeps!  I had two of the children thank me again for the delicious meal. 

My changes:  i added a can of  black beans to the soup mixture as others reviews suggested. I didn’t put the cheese in the soup mixture but added it on top of the soup mixture,  so the cheese was a layer. I used about 15 corn tortillas quartered...I also used a 9x13 sprayed dish  and baked at 350 for 30 minutes like others suggested then broil until bubbly due to time and it was amazing!

In place of the beef I used leftover rotisserie chicken.  I cut it up and added the taco seasoning without any liquid.  Generally followed all the rest of the recipe.  We liked it!

These were SO good!! I made it exactly as listed, but I cooked it on low for 2 hours instead of high for 1 hour. Only because I had them cooking while we were at church. Made some brown rice to put on the bottom of each serving. SO so good! I am making them again this weekend.

Perfect made it 4 times already, it is wonderful with beef or chicken! We like putting a spoon of sour cream on it when serving along with a dash of taco sauce.

I halfed them to fit inside the slow cooker. About 4-5 per layer. Layered as directed meat mixture with cheese then tortillas again. Repeated about 3 times. I set it on warm until I was ready to get dinner going then turned it to low. It was ready in about 1.5 hrs. My entire family LOVED it.

Despite not adding any salt, it ended up being very salty. Likely a result of the canned soups and taco mix.

We make this quite often, but increase the cook time to 2 hours.  We typically either add more salsa, or Ro-tel, or a can of green chiles to vary the flavor.  I typically slice fresh jalapenos on top too...

I had this at a party, she put green sauce over the top.  It was yummy.  If I make this I am going to use precooked chicken.  I have made this in the oven with precooked chicken and it is awesome.

We will definitely be making this again.  Utterly delicious!  Next time we may add some black beans, diced tomatoes and chopped onions.  It's perfect the way it is, though.

Why bother with a slow cooker for just an hour? I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. Done. Tasted great. I added black beans and green peppers because it's really unhealthy this way.

I did not care for the taco seasonings and the tortillas got pretty mushy. If I made it again, (and I probably won't) I would use different seasonings. I'm not sure what you can do about the mushy tortillas.

This is a review of a review. I noticed one reviewer gave this 1 star because the ingredients sounded "plastic" but didn't say if they made it or not.  That's pretty lame.  I have often seen good dishes that didn't sound too good based on the ingredients but in fact were good.  You can't always tell from the ingredients list.

Soooo.  This was delicious. I'm adding this to my repertoire of awesome dinners.   Seriously. Very good.  Oh yeah I did half mild half medium in chunky salsa.  I also used flour tortillas and put the n a crock pot for four hours.  It's sooo good.  Love love love.  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for posting!!!

This was easy enough to make and my family actually loved it despite its very mushy texture. Maybe I didn't use enough TOrtilla to layer but it was just really mushy and had no structure like in the picture. Still, taste-wise it was great!

I was reviewing this on my iPhone and somehow I was cut off early - so if I review it twice, no big deal, since I've made it differently on a couple of occasions.  Which, as I know many reviewers don't approve of reviewing a recipe that is made differently than as directed.  However, that's one of the reasons I love this recipe - it's like a basic template to me that I can change, substitute or make additions to, based on what's in my kitchen, personal tastes, etc.  I usually need a double layer of tortillas, mostly because I have a small slow cooker, and I need the double layer to support the mixture of meat, cream and cheese (I top every layer with some additional cheese too).  Some of the changes I've made in the past include adding chopped jalapeño's and green chilies to the cream mixture, substituting some cream cheese instead of one can of soup, more spices in addition to the taco seasoning when I have over 1 lb of meat (such as a Penzeys Spice seasoning like Berbere, Arizona Dreaming, or pretty much any spices that sound good), adding black beans or corn, etc.  Today I paired it with the quinoa and black bean recipe from this site.  Excellent recipe whether made as is, or used as a starting point and changing to accommodate ingredients on hand and personal tastes.

This recipe is great & so easy. It's only as spicy as the picante/salsa you add to it. I added 1/2 a diced white onion to the meat as it was browning & added green onion to the top. My whole family loves it.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but mine was incredibly soupy. The flavor was not bad, though my husband liked it more than I did. Modified by using white corn tortillas instead of yellow, and will probably add diced yellow onion to the meat when cooking next time.

Did follow suggestion of serving on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes. Only change was do to the fact I didn't have enough of an ingredient.  Those adjustments: 1 can Cream of chicken with mushroom,  2 cups cheese, Flour tortillas so I doubled them in layers. Cooked in a 6qt slow cooker for 2 hours (I ended up with only two layers). I added one step only because it wasn't noted but I did rinse the beef while I was sauteing the onions and two cloves of garlic then reintroduced the beef and simmered. Thank you

It's a great start to a recipe. It's a staple in my house and easy to make. I add a can of black beans and mix it into the beef. I completely omit the can of cream of chicken soup and replace with a dollop or two of sour cream. I add a little extra cheese and sometimes a can of green chilies.

Delicious. I used jalapeños instead of chiles since I didn't have any green chiles left. I also used the equivalent amount of enchilada sauce instead of the cream soups and dairy free cheese, as I have an actual dairy allergy. My dairy friendly husband absolutely loved it despite my modifications.

I am not a big fan of Mexican food so I didn't rate it a five , but I can enjoy a meal every now and again. This meal was delicious. I made it for my boyfriend and he cleaned his plate and asked if I wanted to more because he was about to eat the rest.  My suggestion for the meal would be to definitely add more meat. I  stayed authentic with ground beef but ground turkey would work, and if you want to go vegetarian just use black beans. I plan to get extra corn tortilla chips to make the layers nice and thick. With the directions as is I used one cup of water and drained the grease from the meat.  To avoid it being to runny.

I modified the recipe. First, I tripled the recipe because of the number of people I made it for. Second, I cooked the meat in Bahklouti infused olive oil, and seasoned it with Adobe, and other Mexican seasonings. I did use a little salsa from a jar. And I diced up 3 tomatoes. I quartered about 30 corn tortillas, spread half on the bottom of the pan. I spread some of the ground beef over them, put the soup mixture over that, then put the rest of the meat mixture over the soup mixture. I layered more tortillas over that, spread some of the cheese, put the last layer of tortillas over that, then spread the rest of the cheese on top. I covered it with non-stick foil and baked it. It was a huge hit!

Its good, but not great, and tastes much more like a taco casserole than anything else. I do feel like the cumin adds a more authentic taste, and I have a feeling if I leave out the taco seasoning, use only the 1/2 tsp of cumin and extra chilies, that this will taste more like enchiladas and less like tacos.

Everybody in my house loved it.  Have made it twice.  Even messed up cooking it and it was still delicious.  This will become a party appetizer to take to parties.

After reading the reviews and their recommendations, I made quite a few changes, and it turned out AMAZING!!  I used a can of cheddar cheese soup (instead of cream of mushroom), and a can of cream of chicken soup.  I used about half of the shredded cheese.  I did not have traditional salsa, so I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with cilantro & lime.  I also added about a cup of verde sauce.  I took other reviewers advice to use more tortillas (double), and make more layers.  I used a can of refried beans and spread that on each tortilla before putting them in the crockpot layers.  After all layered, I added the shredded cheese on top, and cooked it in the crockpot for about 3 hours.  It was not soupy or salty like others had said in their comments, and turned out very, very good!

It was good.  If you don't like the ingredients (ie taco seasoning, canned soups) then use something else.  But, easy to make and good.  You aren't re-inventing the wheel here.  Pretty much exactly what you would think it would be.

This recipe is pretty forgiving.  You can substitute many things as seen by many user reviews and it still comes out good.  I used ground turkey , Trader Joes cowboy salsa which had corn and beans in it, low sodium soups, and a little less water as users recommended.  I also used triple the corn tortillas, but I think it's up to your preference.  Brought this to a potluck and people liked it.  I myself enjoyed it too but I thought it was a tad salty even though I used low sodium soups so if you use the regular kind, I feel it'll be way too salty.  Very easy to make and def going to make again.

This was delicious. I used a lower fat cheese and added a little extra spice, and it was delicious!!! I got a lot of rave reviews at a potluck, and will definitely make it again. Maybe next time I'll try it with ground turkey!!! Yummmmmm

Made this for dinner and my husband loved it!  After reading reviews, I also modified the recipe a bit.  I used 1-1/2 lbs of beef with 1/2 onion, 2 packets of taco seasoning, half the water and 3 cups of cheese.  I could only find the smaller corn tortillas instead of the 6 inch so I used a lot more than 10.  I had to cook longer than 45 minutes (double that time).  I also added chopped lettuce, a can of tomato with chilis and sliced black olives right before serving.   I added sour cream to mine but husband doesnt like that.   We both loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I tweaked this a bit based on reviews and personal preference. I do not like salsa. I have texture issues that make me SUPER picky with food. I just left that out  of the soup and cheese mixture. I added chili powder to the meat. I used a block on manchego cheese instead of shredded cheese. I topped it with queso fresco. I did very thin layers of everything but thick layers of torilla. My husband was very pleased with his "Mexican lasagna". I will definitely make this as a backup for when I don't feel like making my enchilada sauce from
Scratch.

Love love love! I wouldn't exactly call this enchiladas...more of an enchilada casserole, but who cares what it's called? This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with a little sour cream and taco sauce. Definitely making this one again!

I only made one change to the recipe and that was to use green enchilada sauce instead of salsa. It is easy but I think it can do with more flavors and texture. I will have to read through the reviews to tweak this.

This recipe was so good, prepared just as written. My husband and I had two servings each the first night and continued to eat it for every meal until it was gone. In the future, I may add olives, beans and other ingredients, but trust me when I say this was awesome as is. Definitely going in our favorite file.

Made this but added my own twists. Chopped onions and cooked with the meat. And used only 1/4 of a 16oz jar of salsa, and replaced it with green enchilada sauce. Turned out awsome. Hubs is very happy :-p

I didn't change a thing and thought it turned out pretty great! I might try some more beef the next time around, but that's probably just a preference. Overall, a nice addition to this family's menu every couple of weeks. Simple and cheap enough.

This recipe was quite good but I would not call it enchiladas. I definitely made a few changes to adjust for my tastes. I made the ground  beef like the directions on the taco seasoning, so it was a lot less watery. Then i added a can of black beans to the meat to add a bit more nutrition. For the cheese mixture I used some queso fresco and shredded mexican cheese. That was just because i really like queso fresco. I also used a bit too much salasa. Finally I added some pickled onions and black olives I had on hand. I personally like the tang they add to a mexican dish. I recommend double layering your tortillas if you really want to taste them. I think you could easily also make this in the oven with a caserole dish. I think you could also add some nice corn and other veggies to it too.

This recipe was great! The whole family enjoyed it! You could even serve it with tortilla chips!  If you wanted to make half you could use it as appetizer. Would make it again! In fact I have no choice the whole family is asking me too!

This recipe had way too much cheese in it.  Also the consistency needed something with more texture.

It was mushy and too salty.  After cooling in the pot overnight the consistency improved.  Sour cream or greek yogurt with lettuce and tomato cut down the salt. Overall, I was not pleased.

I made this recipe with ground beef and added green chilis.  I substituted Picante sauce for the salsa... same difference just without the tomato chunks that my husband doesn't care for. I also added a dollop of sour cream on top. No left overs = a meal my family loved!  I'd definitely make this again. I imagine it would be good with shredded chicken too. Preparation was simple... I browned the ground beef with taco seasoning before I left for work and threw it all together in less than 10 minutes.  I think throwing it all together in the morning would make the tortillas too soggy.

Delicious, the family loved it.  I took severally of the suggestions: one can of soup, 2 cups of cheese, chopped an onion in with the meat, 3/4 cup water, put a layer of black beans between the meat & cheese.  Only used 6 tortillas. Also baked in a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish @ 350 for 40 mins.  Served on diced lettuce, sour cream & salsa along with refried beans.  Will make when we go on vacation! Easy peasy ??

My mom made this as a casserole when we were growing up.  It's still a favorite.  You don't need the crock pot; just brown the ground beef first, start layering, and bake at 350 until heated through and bubbly.  If you leave out the cream of chicken soup, it won't matter; and add a small can of diced green chiles!

We really enjoyed it. Followed the recommendations of others and reduced the soup, water and cheese by half.  Also added a can of kidney beans. Opted to layer it in a deep casserole dish and baked it in the oven. Would definitely serve this to friends.

Good, simple meal for a busy night. However, it took me much longer to get it hot enough in my crock pot and after 90 min I served the kids but had to microwave me and hubby's. Kids and Dad loved it. I added green chilis (one small can) and an extra couple tortillas.

We reduced the cheese, swapped out shredded beef for the hamburger but the cream-of soups were just awful. Will definitely not make again.

I thought this was very good!  I did add onions and garlic to the meat while browning and I read some of the other comments about adding black beans and I did that also. I also agree that the tortillas are not enough.  Next time I will add more of them. This can be lightened up with light soups,light cheese, and leaner meat.  But all in all, VERY GOOD!!

I made a few changes to the recipe. After reading the reviews I only used 3 cans of soup rather than 4 (I doubled the recipe). It turned out a lot less watery. I also used hot taco mix because I like my food a little more spicy. Used Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce with the sauce. Good stuff.

I saw this recipe and thought it would be a great quick meal.   Followed it word for word.   Ended up taking almost 2 hours to cook in the crock pot.   Won't trust the cooking times again.

I substitute ground beef with ground turkey for everything. I liked the idea of adding black beans for taste, consistency and HEALTH. I guess it would taste good with shredded chicken also. I cook for my stepfather and mother sometimes he watches salt due to high blood pressure. I will follow the ladys comment low sodium soup. Does it still taste as good? Most soups are too salty anyway. Especially chicken. Thanks everyone! I love this site.I know it's going to be good without trying it first.

I have made this recipe several times now and my husband and I love it! There are those who have given a low rating because it calls for condensed soup- well- the soup makes this dish wonderful- maybe they should have given it a try.. no one said it was authentic Mexican :) The only thing I do differently is I brown the hamburger, some onion and taco mix in a frying pan, then stir in the soups and salsa (no extra water) take a 9x13 and put some enchilada sauce in the bottom, then take a tortilla- put in a couple scoops of mixture, place seam side down, 6 fit well in pan, dump remainder of mix over top of enchiladas, sprinkle some cheese on top and bake about 20 minutes. Quick, easy and delicious.

I followed the recipe with only a few adjustments (added black beans and used Rotel tomatoes and green chilies instead of salsa.....cooked it in my crock pot for one hour...it wasn't even really warm in the middle...maybe it was my slow cooker?, it is an older model...but I've never had a single other dish not cook properly
so I think next time I fix this I might just bake it in a casserole dish...if I do the crock pot I honestly think I would have to increase the cooking time to 2 hours....
served this with salsa and shredded lettuce...simple and good flavors

I was not completely crazy about this recipe.  I thought that there was something almost "moldy" tasting in the mixture.  I had left-overs the very next day, and they were actually better than the day we made and ate it.

A good recipe and easy to make!  I made a slight modification and reduced the water from 1 1/4 cups to 1 cup, simmered for 15 minutes, and then drained it.  I was afraid that it would be too soupy or turn to mush if I had too much water.  I am glad that I did drain off the water!

This is a good recipe.  I haven't made it recently but I did make it from a cookbook and loved it.  I am thinking it was a Sandra Lee cookbook.  Very good recipe!!

I needed something fast and filling for a potluck. I had my reservations when I saw the ingredients. Others seemed to like it but to me it was  too salty. Conventional canned soups are never on my shopping list because of the salt, additives, and fillers. I used Mrs. Dash (salt free) Southwest Chipolte seasoning instead of the salty packaged taco mix.

Great flavor.  I will be reducing the water a bit next time around.  My slow cooker is rather old (30 years - lol) so I will have to increase the cooking time to about 2 1/2 hours the next time I make this.  I let it cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes and it still wasn't warmed through but finished up individual servings in the microwave.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very easy to make and very tasty but a bit gooey for my taste. My husband had no problems wit it and thought I should use it for a dinner party meal. I used diced chicken breast. Good and cheesy and just enough spice for me although my husband added more to his serving. Only wish I had a rectangular crock pot instead of the round one to make it an even bigger batch at one time.

I went into this knowing it was not going to be "authentic" enchiladas (not sure why others would have that expectation given the ingredients), but I did expect a nice Mexican casserole.    Sadly, it was not well received by anyone in our house and the leftovers have been in the fridge for 3 days without being touched.   I warmed up another slab of it today thinking maybe the flavors would come together better over time.   Not.

This recipe should work. The sauce is flavorful and the color is good (eye appeal). I was intrigued because I love Mexican and I certainly love a simple slow cooker recipe. However, the combination of taco seasoning and two cans of soup results in a very salty main dish. I followed the tips to keep the tortillas from being mushy, but to no avail. They were too soft right from the slow cooker and by next day the whole pot was just gloppy. I will not make this recipe again.

I love that this is a slow cooker recipes that doesn't take hours to do.  Very easy and delicious!  Added fresh avocado and sour cream for a nice topping.  Everyone loved it, and it was good as left overs too--even for my husband who HATES eating left overs!

I thought this would be a disaster. The corn tortillas had been around a while and my kids are very picky. I used diced tomatoes as I knew the salsa would not go over. I also added chili beans I found while looking for the cream soup. It got rave reviews. I will be making this often. I think I could even make it camping as I would sub in canned chicken. My 16 year old could have eaten the whole thing. He said this was as good as his girlfriend's mother's cooking. One happy mom here.

I thought this dish would just be blah. I made it anyway because I had all of the ingredients on hand. Not blah at all. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. I think next time I would add corn and maybe black olives. I might also substitute the mushroom soup for sour cream. Ground turkey instead of ground beef.

Added 1 medium onion, can of black beans, chopped fresh peppers from garden, and substituted vegetarian meat crumbles (wife's a vegetarian). What a treat! Would be great as a dip without the tortillas!

This was awesome & my family loved it!  I used ground turkey, lower fat soups & only 2 cups of low fat shredded cheese to cut down on some of the fat & calories.  You couldn't tell a difference - everyone asked for seconds.

It was really good, but turned out to be more of a stew than a casserole.  I did double the recipe since there are 8 people in my family.  I should have used 2 crockpots when I doubled it.  However, even doubling the recipe, there were no leftovers.

I made this for my daughters halloween party potluck.  It pretty much finished which was a good sign since there was lots of foods and not very many people.  My changes: 1) I used 1 pound turkey / 1 pound beef. 2) I used Pace Restaurant Style Salsa 3) 1 can cream of mushroom soup 4) Decreased the cheese to just over 4 cups. 5) I added 1 yellow onion and frozen mixed veggies to the meat mixture 6) Topped with green onions and sliced black olives 7) Cook for 2 hours 8) Doubled tortillas throughout.

This didn't work well for me at all.  I think it really needed double the amount of meat and seasoning.  As is, was bland and overwhelmed by the amount of tacos.

I love slow cooker recipes because you can just through everything in the crock pot and then walk away.  This recipe is very tasty, but I make a few alterations...  Firstly, I use canned chicken because it is so easy to use.  Secondly, I leave out the water, salsa, and taco seasoning because i am using chicken.  I add about half a cup of sour cream, and use flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.  This is a great base recipe, and my family loves it!

This was better than any Enchiladas I have ever made or had before. I did revise it using the changes that Misha had used and did some extra cheese each layer. Yummy!

This is always requested when I need to bring something...I make a lot of variations, the favorite is using the artificial crab meat!  Sometimes we'll add a layer of black beans, and add a layer of cream cheese.  I use whatever we have on hand.

This was very tasty. I used two cans of cream of chicken soup because I was out of cream of mushroom and I added a can of black beans. Everyone asked for the recipe! A huge hit!

This receipe was great! I added mushrooms, which I love.  I doubled the receipe, and topped w/ sour cream, mozzarella cheese, extra salsa.  I also, while doing the layering process tripled the tortillas...this was a fabulous receipe...this is a keeper....

These would have been better with the addition of refried beans, canned chili's, some sliced black olives, and a dollop of sour cream on top. Next time I'll try it with these additions and maybe a can of drained rotel.

This was really good! My only complaint-and it's really more of my husband's complaint than mine-it needs more ground beef. I'll use two pounds next time. Also, I didn't get the seasoning and water put in, so I added an extra half-can of "cream of" soup and it turned out great! I will use a mild salsa next time, as well-but it's nice you can fiddle with the heat level depending on the salsa you use.

These were good...not great.  BUT they were easy...that is a plus.  I didn't see the 45 min cooking time..so ours cooked for 5 hrs.  The mixture turned into a "dip" that was mighty tasty.  Not sure I will make again...the oven-baked variety are better.

I was really skeptical about creamed soups in enchiladas, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I did season the GB as it was cooking & I did puree the salsa (DH wouldn't of ate it if he saw chunks).  It did take closer to 2 hours in my oval crockpot to completely heat through.  I served it with "taco fixins" on the side.

Kimberly Alderman Tonight I made this recipe, EXCEPT that I omitted the cream of chicken, used 1/2 cup instead of water, 2# of ground lean turkey instead of whatev, added 3 cups kidney beans and a 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream when it was done cooking in the slow cooker for a few hours. Also used fat free cream of mushroom. I then ma...de it as a casserole and cooked in the oven. I only used 2 cups of cheese instead of 4, and used a can of tomatoes with green chilis instead of salsa. I made the taco seasoning by hand since I'm so cheapie cheap. I thought it came out very well and the men seemed to like it too! The cost was about $1 a serving, the turkey being the biggest expense. Not too fatty, either, about 9 grams per serving (all from the turkey, really).

i cooked this for my family and they all loved (except for my super picky 8 yr old). my husband even liked it and that is rare. i followed recipe excatly except i fried tortillas in cooking spray so they would be soft. I also cooked in oven for 35 minutes instead of slow cooker. i didn't have the time. i even made a vegetarian version using ranch style beans instead of taco meat. it was really good too. thanks for the recipe :)

This is one of my fiance's favorite dishes. I add a can of corn and a can of black beans to this. I have also made this recipe with out the tortillas and just eat it out of the bowl and it comes out great. This recipe is great because I can get the crock pot ready before I go to work, keep it in the fridge then come home and turn it on. This is a keeper!

This is such a great recipe! I added a can of black beans to the meat mixture and fresh cilantro to the cheese mixture. Next time I will add a few extra tortillas because mine came out a little soupy. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was wonderful. I did add a couple different things though. I added black beans and fiesta corn to the mixture and I substituted chicken for beef, WOW! It was wonderful. I used it for a potluck and got great applause.

it was ok...tastes too much like tacos so maybe Ill use an enchilada sauce packet instead.  I did not add extra water per suggestions and the corn tortillas still became soggy.  Also, I would use a larger crock pot for this, I used the smaller one and had lots of leftover filling and corn tortillas.  I also added canned corn and canned garbanzo beans to the filling (both minus the juice from the can).

Delicious as is! Will definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation. Great topped with black olives on the final layer, then garnished with lettuce tomato and sour cream.

My whole family loved this! I used flour tortillas, since thats what I had on hand. I also baked it ( 350 for about 45 minutes) since I didnt have the time to place it in the crock pot! I will be making this again! Thanks!

I took the advice of another reviewer and 'flash-fried' the tortillas (approx 10 secs in very hot oil). I also left out the cream of mushroom soup as I didn't have any - substituted with sour cream. Delicious!

Very good comfort food! Next time i will add some jalapenos, because we like our mexican with heat. Also, I only had i can of cream of mushroom, so i mixed it with a cup of sour cream, also added a can of red beans in with the taco meat. Will make again!

Very good. I took this to a work pitch-in and it wasn't enough. Everyone love it. It tastes a lot like it has beans, but no beans. Enjoy!

Great recipe, I used flour tortillas instead of corn and it was fine. I used a can of black beans and added a few spoonfuls on each layer, along with some chopped up olives. Quick and easy and tasted really good!

WOW!  Made these for a potluck, and they were the first thing that went!  I couldn't find corn tortillas in my grocery and didn't want to use flour tortillas because I thought they'd be too mushy, so I used tortilla chips instead.  It came out great.

Used low fat soups and cut (light) shredded cheese in half - chopped chick peas and lentils instead to make it healhier. Kids even loved it, as they have no clue when they are chopped!

I didnt love it but I thought it was ok. Had good flavor. I cooked chicken breasts in the slow cooker with the soups and added a can of diced green chiles. Shredded it and did the layers in a casserole dish. I didnt like the texture of the mushy corn tortillas but overall, I would make this again!

I love this recipe!!!! It was so easy to make. I used Ground Pork and served with Sour Cream. The smell drove everyone crazy. Amazing how something so simple could taste so good. It was a hit...and there are already hints for me to make again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I ended up making this in a pan and cooking it in the oven.  I need the crock pot for something else.  The recipe still worked beautifully though.  I did use 2lbs of beef and added 2 cans of beans.  Other wise I followed the recipe as stated.  I put the dish in the oven and cook it at 350 degrees until the cheese melted (about 40 minutes).  Yum Yum!!!  It has made great leftovers!

I have made this twice for my family and they ate it up! I added black olives to all of the layers and ate it with sour cream on top. This is a great recipe and there is plenty of room to experiment with ingredients depending on preferences. : ) Yummy!

I was really apprehensive about this recipe.  After reading the reviews I decided to make a couple of changes.  I used 2lbs of Hamburger instead of 1.  I used a can of HOT Rotel instead of the salsa and I also used 2 envelopes of Enchilada mix and an 8oz can of tomato sauce. I am not a fan of corn tortilla's so I used flour.  This turned out AWESOME!  I took it to a social gathering and everyone raved about it. I"m so glad I tried it.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

I found this easy and tasty. I added corn and black beans to the soup mixture,and used about three cups of cheese. This recipe is pretty versatile. I shall be making this again.

Delicious! My boyfriend who usually gives a, "Yeah, it's alright..." to food he LIKES gave this a, "This is GOOD!" We both went back for seconds. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut back the soup to 3/4 of each can and reduced the cheese to about 2 1/2 cups. I also used flour tortillas and added some black beans into the layers. No more mushy than a regular enchilada is! Served with tortilla chips and homemade cilantro-lime rice. SO good.

This was so good. I made this yesterday. My 7 year old helped me. It was so easy. I did make a couple changes, no much though. I did make it with 2 pounds of ground beef, and less water. and a little less soup. We ate it ALL!  I have no leftovers today. I was looking forward to them too! I will be making this again very soon since it was such a big hit. Thank You!

Like many others, my family is trying to cut down on eating meat. The recipe sounded great so I just left out the ground beef in the filling and subbed the following: I cut the kernels off 1 ear of corn, halved a cup of grape tomatoes, and diced a chunk of red onion (about 1/4 cup.) I added to this mixture, about 1 cup cooked pinto beans and 2 spoonfuls of taco seasoning from a large Costco jar. My family really enjoyed it! The best part was the crockpot cooking time (exactly 45 minutes on high). It was a little salty; next time I will use the reduced sodium soup mixes. The cream of chicken soup disqualifies this as a vegetarian entree, but it fit my "meat-free" guidelines and no one felt deprived. I don't like to review recipes unless I follow them as written, but I just wanted to let others know that this was still great even without the meat.

This was very easy and very good, though I added a few extra things, including a can of black beans and a can of dices tomatoes. You need to double layer the tortillas - I did not and they were almost non-existent. I also added onions and garlic to the beef while browning.

This recipe rocks! I made it for a pot luck at work and my co-workers are still talking about it. I made some modifications by adding green chilis, green salsa, and some jalenpenos. I poured enchilada sauce on the bottom before adding any tortias and made sure that the top was covered in sauce to prevent the edges from drying out. This is a keeper!

This recipe is great.  My extremely picky sister asked for seconds, and took a lot home.  I used chicken breasts, sauteed first, then shredded/cubed, and followed the rest of the directions.  I forgot to quarter the corn tortillas -- I just laid four down for each layer.  I also bought some low-fat jalapeno cheese and shreded it and used two cups of that plus two cups of Mexican shredded cheese.  It was very spicy, so next time, I'll use 1 cup to three.  I did everything else as stated, and it came out great.  My husband didn't like the look of it once we dug into it, but the tast was great.  The tortillas remained sturdy like real enchiladas.  I highly recommend.

what i like best about this recipe is that most slow cooker recipes require all day cooking, but this is done within an hour and a half. however, my husband and i didnt care much for it. we didn't like the corn tortillas. i think this would make an awesome chip dip if you omit the corn tortillas.

Not impressed.  I think there was too much cheese, and just didn't like the combination of the soups with the meat and tortillas.

Yum, yum, yum! This is the first recipe I tried with my slow cooker that turned out how I wanted! I made it for my family's Halloween get together this year. This is definitely a keeper! The only change I made was instead of chunky salsa, I used a can of enchilada sauce.  (Update) I made this again for a potluck last Christmas and before I knew it, it was gone! All the ladies were giving me compliments on it and a couple of them even asked for the recipe. =)

This was easy end excellent.  I subbed enchilada sauce for the salsa. And instead of cooking it in the slowcooker for an hour I baked it in a 12x8 dish in the oven for an hour.  Topped with olives.

the corn tortillas and beef shine, making you forget the soup it contains. Not healthy enough to make my top grade, but everyone ate it.

I made some modifications to this. I slow cooked chicken breast, shredded it and heated with some of the taco seasoning. When I finished layering in the slow cooker I sprinkled a little of the left over taco seasoning on top. I also used reduced/healthy select soups. My family enjoyed it.

I made some major adjustments due to the complaints everyone had about it being soggy.  I kept the tortilla count the same but halved the soup portion of the recipe.  It didn't turn out soggy which was good.  I added green bell peppers, onion, and minced jalepeno to it as well.  However, it still had a slightly "cream of..." soup taste to it.  I will try it again, it just needs more tweaking.

This is a wonderful recipe that I cook at least once a week. To reduce fat, use ground turkey, and the Campbell's 98% fat free cream soups.

Great potluck meal.  Fast and easy (perfect for a busy mom!).  Good but not the kind of enchiladas you know when you live in the southwest such as we do.  Will definitely make again.  I doubled the recipe and used 1lb ea. of hamburger and sausage.  Nice flavor!

I made this for dinner last night. It was a great dish, especially for a hectic weeknight. Next time I plan to make with chicken. I did add some extra spice, rotel, black beans and enchilada sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Good, but I felt that it needed a little more spice. It may have been the salsa I used, next time I will make with a medium salsa vs. mild.

These were very good, however I did make it with refried beans instead of beef.  I just mixed the beans in with the soup/salsa mixture and layered tortillas (used 2 packs of 10 6 inch), bean mixture and then cheese, repeating until it was all used up.  I only gave it 4 stars because although the flavor was excellent, it was too heavy for me and I could hardly eat it :(  Next time I'll make it with light soup...then it will be perfect!

I brought the Slow Cooker Enchiladas to work, and it must be good because I had a few people in the office request the recipe. Most importantly, there was none left over! Great recipe, and very easy to make.

I thought this recipe was good, but an extra pound of ground beef wouldn't hurt. Also it took longer than 1 hour, but I guess the size and width of your slow cooker will determine cooking time.

Good and Easy. A nice variety for mexican food. Though when I do a slow cooker recipe I usually like it to be a time saver type recipe or one that cooks while I am at work. This is not that kind of recipe.  I used flour tortilla instead and that worked fine.

It was easy to fix, tasted okay and it made a lot of food, but wasn't quite what we were looking for.

Used chicken breast in place of beef.  I was not pleased with the presentation of the dish.  Just a gloppy mess.  Overall taste was just ok.

This was the first recipe i made in my slow cooker and it was amazing!!  I made this for my husband and we loved it - it was so easy to prepare and it smelt so good.  The only problem was i made too much and it was so filling that some of it went to waste!  My husband has been telling everyone about the delicious meal i made forf him in the slow cooker - i will definitely be making this again!!!

We'll repeat this one at our house. It's the sort of recipe that you can play with real easily and it will still taste GREAT!

Pretty good! We used wheat tortillas and only cream of chicken instead of mushroom. I think I will use less tortillas next time as I felt like there was too much of that ingredient.

Used left over roasted chicken, just shredded it and put the taco mix with it before layering. Turned out amazing.

interesting, different and delicious although the packet taco mix makes it very salty so next time i will add my own flavourings. also, being in Oz i do not know what your mexican cheese mix consists of so made up my own.  thanks for sharing your recipe

This suprised my how good it was without actual enchilada sauce. I substituted regular cheese for the peppered cheese to make it more kid friendly, and the kids ate every bite. Next time I'm going to tweek it and do a couple of cans enchilada sauce and shredded chicken.
