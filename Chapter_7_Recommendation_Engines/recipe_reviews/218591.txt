Nice flavor- used my own garlic, leek and swiss chard- I do agree the parm cheese really should be 2 tablespoons-  I also added white wine when I added the leeks- mushrooms seemed a little dry and then when I was cooking the chard I also added some wine to the chicken stock- came out great!

So I didn't have portobello mushrooms so I simply used canned pieces & stems.  AND I forgot to add any Parmesan!  (the 2 cups of cheese obviously has to be an error - MAYBE 2 TBSP would be appropropriate.  Anyway, it was delicious - even my husband liked it and said I could make it again even though he hates Chard.

Great way to cook chard!  I used vegetable broth to make this a vegetarian dish and it turned out great!

Swiss chard is one of my favorite vegetables.  I love it.  It's a delicately flavored green, sweeter than most. It needs little more than a bit of garlic and some olive oil.  Bacon is good too. But I was willing to try something different, and I do love mushrooms of any kind.  But neither Hubs nor I much cared for this, both of us agreeing the Swiss Chard totally got lost in the more potent flavor of the mushrooms.

Yummmmy!  We really enjoyed this dish and didn't even add the Parmesan cheese.  Great favors.  Will certainly continue to make this.

I think this needs a little more swiss chard and maybe drain the fat. A yummy way of making swiss chard!

I eyeballed amounts and used veggie broth and it turned out great.  Make sure not to over cook the chard.  Obviously an editing error with the parm, and doesn't really need it at all.

I received a bunch of red and white chard in my CSA and was so happy to find this recipe! Wow! Like another reviewer said I added some white wine to the mushrooms. I used 2 cloves of garlic and some sliced shallot which added great flavor. Also use a few tablespoons of grated parmesan. 2 cups will ruin this dish lol

The best swiss chard recipe I've tried! Even my husband who doesn't like veggies thought this was great. Baby bella mushrooms also work well in place of portabellos. One variation I've tried and also love is using chopped zucchini and summer squash with some diced orange peppers in place of the chard.

Cooking the mushrooms and garlic together really brought out those flavors. Used shallots cause that's what I had. And Parmesan makes everything yummy. Used it to taste. Classic dish.

This is really amazing. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Perfect combination of flavors. It was a hit with everyone.

This was great!   The mushrooms really make it.  I would reduce the liquid a bit, though.

Made it with kale, didn't add the cheese (yet), drained the liquid (organic veg broth), drank it cut 1/2 with water, will use the rest as pizza topping tomorrow with the cheese, fresh mozzarella, white sauce, and a scratch crust.

I made this with mushroom broth, and skipped the Parmesan, as we're vegan. It was amazing!

: I made it with yellow onion and kale rather than leek and chard.  It was what I had on hand.  I accidentally forgot the garlic.  I only used about 1 tablespoon of oil and 2 tablespoons of cheese.  It was delicious.  Will do it again whith chard and leek.

I only used one tablespoon of olive oil and I added some kale that I had on hand. It was very good, easy to make and delicious. Definitely did not use anywhere near 2 cups of Parmesan- seemed an outlandish amount. Just sprinkled some on each serving and that was appropriate.

This was great inspiration and just what I needed to use up some stuff in the crisper. I've been trying to find more ways to eat greens. So I used half rainbow chard and half spinach. Also some green onions cuz I didn't have enough leeks. Chicken fat instead of olive oil -- just cuz I had it handy from cooking chicken. Wine instead if chicken broth cuz I had some I needed to use up. ;-) Next time I'll make it your way! This one's definitely a keeper. Bet you could dress it up with some toasted almond slivers or pine nuts at the end...

We really liked this. It was our first time with chard and we happened to have baby portobello mushrooms too. The only thing I would do differently is cut the crushed red pepper down to 1/2 or 1/4 tsp. Otherwise, it was quite tasty!

First recipe ever with swiss chard and it was good.  Would definitely omit the crushed red pepper, don't know why that's in there, as my mouth was burning some and eyes watering.  Didn't have parmesan cheese but did have some shredded asiago I sprinkled on and that made it good.

Super delicious, but I added bacon and that may account for some of that.  With portobellos sauteed in bacon fat, this dish didn't last to be leftovers.

this was ok, but definitely needed more salt/parm cheese.  it was very earthy/spicy but next time i will try more garlic/parm cheese.
