Please Read! I have no food allergies, that I know of, but my hand took about 3 hours to heal after peeling these!

"The flesh of chayote will remain firm if the skin is left on during cooking. You can peel chayote before or after cooking, but if you peel it before it may secrete a sticky substance that might irritate your skin. This substance disappears during cooking.

To peel chayote before cooking, wear gloves or oil your hands or peel under running water."

We really liked this soup.  I had 2 chayotes and had no idea how to fix them when I found this recipe.  The soup was creamy and delicious.  I served it 2 days after I made it.  The only change I made was to add 1 jalapeno pepper when cooking instead of the red pepper flakes.  I served it with a sprinkling of fresh ground parmesian cheese and a couple of homemade croutons.

This soup was good as is, but after making and tasting it I decided to enhance it to use it as a main dish. I added 1 cup cubed leftover roast beef, 1/2 cup chopped green peppers, 1/2 cup sliced carrots, 1 tbsp chopped cilantro to the cooked "base" and simmered for another 30 minutes.  Topped it with chopped fresh cilantro, and served it with crisp tortilla chips, orange wedges, and red grapes.  I sometimes use a soup similar to that utilizes  cauliflower as the "base," then add chopped ingredients to increased variety of texture and flavor. However, I am happy to know that Chayote can be used in the same way.  Having read other comments, I first simmered "immersed" chayotes in water for an hour, cut them (after cooling a spell) into about 5 rings each, then easily removed the skins manuevering quickly around each ring with a paring knife (took less than 2 minutes).  I used a food processor to puree the chayotes before adding them to the sauteed onion mixture and broth.

Cheap, easy, healthy... And I wanted to try it?  Why?  I bought some chayote because I'd never seen it before.  Didn't have a clue what on earth to do with them.  So I did what I do, and checked out allrecipes.  This recipe looked worth a try.  I had everything here, enough in fact, to make a double batch.  Oh, am I ever glad I did!  I used the immersion blender right in the Donabe, and it came out delicious and creamy.  I not only think it will be better after being in the fridge a while, I see using it in many of my recipes!  It's not just a soup, this is going to help enchiladas, tacos, spaghetti sauce, pot roasts...  A definite keeper!  I guess cheap, easy and healthy aren't all that bad after all.  :)  it doesn't taste like any of the above.  It tastes like a splurge!

This was so delicious that I could not believe it was healthy for me. It was creamy and the cilantro makes it taste fresh. My roommate loved it as well!   I took other reviewers' tips into consideration and added one jalapeno. Since I don't enjoy food that is extremely spicy, this was perfect for me. I also realized when I began cooking that I had no red pepper so I substituted in a bit of ground cayenne pepper. With this and the jalapeno there was a slight "hot" flavor after you swallowed and then it was gone; it didn't linger in my mouth.   The only con is that it is a very unattractive green color so it could be hard to get picky eaters to try this soup.

Delicioso!!! I made this soup for the 1st time and was a hit!! I'm not a chayote fan but mom gave me homegrown chayotes from her garden.  I didn't know what to do with them until I came across this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written, just next time I will add only a pinch of crushed red pepper not 1/4 tsp. My mom and sons loved it. Definitely a keeper...

We don't use bouillon cubes, so I followed the recipe using chicken stock in place of the bouillon and water--this soup was delicious! I garnished with some diced avocados, and they added a nice finish to the overall taste and texture. This was a super simple lunch and I'll definitely be doing it again!

Red pepper flakes are really spicy.  I like a lot of heat, but this is a bit much for such a mild squash like chayote.  I'm letting mine sit for a day and will add a dollop of sour cream and some crumbled queso fresco cheese for dinner tomorrow night.  I'm sure that will help tame the heat too.  This is a keeper!!!

Note: wear gloves when peeling the chayote.  It leaves a funky film that doesn't wash off right away.  Weird. ;)

I rarely take the time to rate items unless they are remarkably good.  This meets that criteria and then some.  This is by far one of the easiest and best soups I have ever made!  Thanks!

My husband and I really loved this. It has a great flavor! The cilantro in it was perfect. I also used one jalapeno instead of red pepper flakes. Next time I will not core the jalapeno so thoroughly to give it even more kick. With the one jalepeno cored it just had a hint of heat. I used an immersion blender to puree and it worked great with way easier clean up.  Served with parmesan and croutons. That addition took it from really good to AMAZING!! I'd never even heard of chayote squash before I was given some last week. Now I'll be planting them in my garden!

We followed the recipe exactly. The soup was very tasty. The spice kick hits afterwards and is very good. My MIL does not like spicy hot foods, so she topped her soup with a bit of mexican blend cheese and sour cream and loved it. My FIL loved the soup and took the rest home! Our total yield was 6-7 cups of soup (ingredients calculated for 4 servings).

we LOVED it!  my husband who didn't even want to try it because he doesn't like chayote very much is now asking for a bowl of it!  I made it a bit spicy with 2 jalapenos but the flavor is great.  i also used white pepper which adds a nice flavor.  we will definitely make this again!

This soup is a great way to serve a portion of vegetables and still keep it healthy, I never use butter I use cooking spray and the taste is still good. If you have kids this soup works amazing, they don’t have to know what they are really eating and chayotes have a lot of fiber and vitamins! The crushed pepper flakes give the soup an amazing flavor without making it spicy. We always eat it with grated parmesan cheese.

When I made this recipe (incl 2 jalapenos mentioned above) for my parents for dinner, my mother said it was a soup fancy enough to serve at an elegant dinner party.  Everyone loved how it tasted and that it was so pretty.  When I ate the leftovers the next day, I put in a dollop of sour cream and it was even more divine!

Good taste. Needs a bit more substance though. Maybe some meat or another vegetable. My husband doesn't like his food pureed. "I want to chew it for myself." I kind of felt this way for this soup too.

DELICIOUS. The crushed red pepper gives it nice heat, the cilantro keeps it fresh. I added a tiny bit of chicken stock to the bouillon which made it a bit richer and really yummy. I think it would make a great sauce as well, with tacos or enchiladas. So good.

Delicious! My only change would be to use a food processor instead of a blender. I have a really good blender, but it still came out not quite creamy enough until I put it through the food processor. It might be good with a dollop of queso fresco at the end too - I'm going to try that next time.

I bought chayote out of curiosity, then went about figuring out what the heck they were and how to eat them.  This recipe was easy, delicious, and I had all ingredients on hand.  I used veggie stock instead of chicken bullion to make it vegetarian, and added about a tsp of sage to give it some chicken-y flavor.  Wish I had doubled the recipe!

Cheap, easy, and WOW -- so good! Can make it as spicey or mild as you want. I substituted olive oil for the butter and mashed everything with a potato masher instead of running it through the blender, so mine was not a puree. Really good on a cold day.

Awesome soup!! Really loved the flavor, much more complex than I had expected for the few ingredients used. Didn't have enough left to try the next day, but assume it would have been even better. I'll be making this often!

I finally found a way to eat chayote, very popular in Honduras. I make it without the chilli peppers and my kids can eat it, and then I add chipotle peppers in the blender for my husband and myself, I loooove it with chipotle, and the leftovers are used as sauce for quesadillas or spaguetti the next day. Great recipe!!!

so easy and so delicious!  I added extra cilantro and jalapenos since my husband and I like spicy, and it was definitely spicy!

I can't believe how good this is.  This was the first time I have used Chayote and I am in love.  Seriously, it tastes like you have added so much cream to this soup.  It is delicious and guilt free!!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated except that instead of 20 minutes of cooking, once I finished cooking the squash I threw the entire mixture plus the hot water and bouillon into my vitamix and turned it on high for five minutes. It came out perfectly!  Creamy and tasty with a kick, and so few calories!

Excellent!  My variation: I added 1 serrano pepper including the seeds to make it hot.  Also two packs of Sazon Goya seasoning for added flavor.  Never had chayote before, but it was on sale and a good time to try it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didnt have a blender so I used a masher.  Needless to say it was a bit more chunky than the recipe.  I had some left over chicken and I put it in as well.  I deleted the salt and used can chicken broth.  Even though it was not smooth and creamy I thought it was very good.  I liked this recipe and will use it again.

Very good recipe.  The soup tastes creamy and delicious!  Instead of red pepper flakes, I just chopped a jalepeno instead.

I was trying to figure out what to do with the Chayote's my mother-in-law gave me and I loved this recipe.  Even though I like spicy foods, I will put less pepper in it next time. Love the creamy texture and the fact that it's healthy!

Yum! I used parsley instead of cilantro, and it's good, but probably would be better with cilantro. I also added two jalapenos, sliced/diced. This soup is delicious and I love how it seems creamy yet is so healthy. Thanks for sharing!

The flavor profile is exceptional for a healthy low calorie dish. The second time I made it, I made the following changes. I think is pairs extremely well as a sauce over baked spaghetti squash. I decided to thicken is a bit by only using 1 cup of water instead of the two. I also used Ancho Chili Powder instead of the Red Pepper flakes. This will be in my regular rotation of recipes now, and for those thinking of trying it, you will be surprised at your creamy (pureeing in the blender is a must) and flavorful it is.

Easy recipe with excellent taste... shared the recipe with all the girls at work they loved it so much. Easy way to mix veggies into your diet also. As others have said, tastes great when you add queso fresco on top!

This is a favorite in my house. I make it with mashed potatoes and use it as a gravy. 

Word of advice: go easy on those pepper flakes. The first time I made it. It was a little too spicy for me.

Nice recipe! First time making Chayote soup or using Chayotes period. I am an alkaline vegan so a few of the ingredients such as butter and garlic I either substituted or didn't use altogether.  Over all it is a nice recipe and I will probably cool Chayote soup in the future.

This soup turned out phenomenal! I used some of my own homegrown and dried peppers and no salt, and it was perfect for my taste buds. The texture was perfect, and even my chef husband couldn't give me enough compliments on it. He suggested I cut back the cilantro, but I love cilantro and think the strong flavor of it is one of the best features in this soup. I did leave the skin on the squash, but these were young with nice tender skins. Next time, I'd like to try it with fresh hot peppers just to see what it does to the flavors.

I remember my Tia making this for me years ago and I wanted to make some at home. Mmmmmm, I have been using this recipe for ages now. Cannot get enough of it. I find that the flavors really jump out if you leave the finished dish in the fridge for a day.

Note to all users new to Chayote: Wear gloves. Chayote secretes a sticky substance that can irritate your skin. Once cooked, it isn't an issue but definitely use while peeling and cutting.

This is by far my favorite soup in the world! SO delicious and savory. I like to add more cilantro, and I also top it with some sliced avocado and about 1/4 cup cooked rice. My husband can't get enough and regularly asks me to make it! 2 thumbs up ????

If I could give this more stars, I would.  I use homemade chicken stock and use more onions and chayote squashes.  The flavor is excellent, plus it has a great thick texture.  Outstanding.  We have made this many times.  One caveat, wear rubber gloves when peeling the squash.  I slit them in half and peel, then use a melon baller to scoop out the seed.

Absolutely delicious. I had to improvise with the red crush pepper since I didn't have none and used a very small piece of Jamaican hot pepper. Still came out great and definitely plan to make this again.

We enjoyed this recipe, even though I substituted butternut squash for the chayote, since I couldn't find it.  Also, I pureéd the soup with an immersion blender, which made it very creamy.  We liked it with diced jalapeños and Greek yogurt!  Thank you!

Excellent result and easy to prepare.  The entire family loves it.  I use chayote which I grow in my own garden so I simply harvest the squash and cook it!  Can't be more fresh than that!
