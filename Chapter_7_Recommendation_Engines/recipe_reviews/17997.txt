I needed a recipe to feed 5 kids (3 of them as guests) so I was pressed for time! I did brown the beef w/ the onions and added season salt plus garlic powder. Milk instead of water. I layared potatoes, then 1/2 of beef, plus added 1 cup of frozen green beans, rest of beef and baked at 400 for 45-55 mins...topped w/ cheese last 5 mins of baking.  Kids loved it!!

I made this recipe tonite and it was GREAT!!!!! But I used 2 cans of mushroom soup to make it creamier, and then at the end of the cooking time I topped it with cheese. I also added bell pepper to saute with the onions, and some garlic powder in the meat while it cooked. Will make again and again!!

Taste was very good. Needed several changes however. 2 cans of soup instead of one, one onion instead of two, canned green beans were an excellent addition, and I will definitely use frozen hash brown potatos next time instead of cubed as they did not fully cook through. Great base recipe though, and will make again as my family loved it.

Oh, my goodness, SO good and SO easy!!
I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the ground beef, and added some grated cheddar cheese in the layers. I also used two cans of soup instead of one. Great recipe !!

I made this recipe tonight for the first time.  My husband & 3 year old loved it, as did I.  I sauted the onions with the beef because I didn't read the recipe closely enough....no problem there!  I sliced the potatoes thinly and layered it in a square dish with just over a pound of hamburger meat (seasoned with garlic powder and salt/pepper).  I ended up not having cream of mushroom soup, so I used the golden mushroom soup instead.  It really added alot of flavor in my view.  I would use the golden soup again.  Thanks for the recipe!  My husband finished the remainder of the casserole tonight!  No leftovers for us!

This recipe is a good starter, for a meal.  But like the other reviews said, it needs a little help.  I added some mixed veggies, a clove of garlic and some cheddar cheese.  I did microwave the pototes to get them a little soft to shorten the cooking time, just 30 minutes.   I just used the 1 can of soup, I didn't think it needed more than that.  It came out great, and I'll make it again.

Wow - really loved this. Was simple to make and came out great. (I reserve 5 star rating for more elegant fare) What I did different was add milk to the soup instead of water, increasing the ammount to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup (didn't measure exactly). I salt and peppered plus added Zataran cajun seasoning to the potato layers. Baked about 1 hour at 300, potatoes weren't done and I was impatient so I cooked it another 20 minutes at 400 with no problems. I definitely recommend this recipe. I wouldn't do 2 cans of soup as some have posted. When you add the soup it looks like it doesn't infiltrate the top layer, but as it cooks, it makes it's way down. Adding 2 cans of soup would really increase the fat content. Again - mine came out great!

Great recipe!  Next time I will use only 1 onion (2 was just too much).  If you're pressed for time, you can boil the potatoes until tender first, then add to the casserole, and bake about 30 minutes.  I think next time I will slice the potatoes instead of cubing them - just my personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this the other night for supper. It was a big hit. Even my 6 year old who hates to try new things ate it! I made a few changes like some of the others. I used 2 cans of soup and some shredded cheese. It was very creamy. I also chopped up the onion and cooked it with the hamburger. (I knew the onion slices wouldn't go over with the kids) Will fix again!

Very yummy! It reminds me of S.O.S. (us military brats know what that is). I made some changes that really worked out delicious!
I cooked 1 large white onion w/ground beef then added 3 dashes of Worschshire sauce, 2 beef boullion cubes,a couple of dashes of season salt and 1/2 cup of water. I mixed the can of soup with a full can of water then I layered as instructed but in a crockpot.
I served it with garlic bread. This is a keeper.

We loved this recipe, Judith. After reading the reviews I added a 14 ounce can of stewed tomatoes rather than more mushroom soup. Yummy! Also, seasoned ground beef with 1 1/2t garlic powder while it was cooking.Just the right amount of liquid! Thanks.

This was good, my husband, who does not eat casseroles or potatoes, at least finished the helping I served (normally, if he doesn't like something, he won't even finish it).  

You should pre-cook the potatoes for sure.  Two cans of soup are required and I added a can of mushrooms with the juice, which made gave a little something.  This is a good "two days 'til payday" recipe since it calls for staples that you generally have on hand.

This was too bland.  My husband liked it & compared it to hamburger helper (which I hate).  I'm not even sure how I could jazz this up so I probably won't make it again.  It wasn't awful, just tasteless.

Really nice, quick meal.  I omitted the oil, and cooked onions with ground beef.  I used frozen cubed hash brown potatoes (Southern style).  I seasoned the beef with garlic powder and sprinkled seasoning salt on the potatoes as I layered them.  Like others suggested, I used milk in the soup instead of the water.  Reminds me of  a "tater tot" casserole my Mom made.  Sprinkled cheddar generously on top just before removing from oven.  Kids loved it - hamburger casserole!

This reminded me of tater tot casserole without the crunch of the tots. I followed other suggestions and used 2 cans of soup, one mushroom, one celery and cooking the onion with the beef. I also used 1 1/2 pound of beef and only 3 potatoes. I microwaved my potatoes for 4 min. before pealing and slicing. I used a 2.5 liter Corning wear dish. The casserole only had to cook 30 min. before it was done.

This was good, but needs a little flavor. I also think it needs a second can of soup and maybe 2 more potatoes and another onion. I didn't have any problems with the  cooking time and it was tasty and easy though :)

This was great! I also used two cans of soup and diced the potatoes pretty small. I put half a bag of frozen French style green beans on before pouring the soup over. I cooked at 385 for 1 hour and the potatoes came out perfect! Added about a cup of cheese on top for the last 10 min. Thanks for all the suggestions they really help!

Amazingly good for being so simple. I used one onion, added a clove of garlic, and used cream of celery soup. I also added a little chedder cheese on top towards the end of baking. Both my husband and 3 yr old liked it.

This was just ok.  While it did remind me of meals I had while growing up, my family wasn't impressed.  And I agree with other reviewers that it took longer than an hour to cook.

This was a great casserole for a cold winter's night. Very homey. I had to use one large can of cream of chicken soup (its all I had on hand), and I added milk instead of water and I added 2 beef boulion cubes. I also added some fresh garlic to the onions. The only thing I would change is it needs some bite....Maybe some crushed red pepper flakes in with the ground beef. I will try something next time. Thanks for sharing.

This was the perfect low budget, midweek meal--perfect for what it is. I could rename it the 'kitchen sink' recipe. I cooked up one organic onion and one pound of grass-fed, humanely raised ground beef. To the pan I added (all veggies are organic) one sort of shriveled, diced red pepper, two stalks of celery and two carrots. I seasoned it with a few bay leaves, garlic powder, lemon pepper, salt and a half glass of red wine from last night.

In the greased 9 x 13 pan I cubed 4 large potatoes, 7 tiny white turnips and two small yams—all from my local CSA box. I put the meat/veggie mixture over the potato mixture. I mixed a large can of crm. of mush soup, a few ounces of leftover evaporated milk, a few ounces of leftover beef broth and a half can of creamed corn—all leftovers in the fridge from the past couple of days and poured it over the meat and potatoes. Baked the whole thing for 45 minutes. Yum!!! It made enough for two adults and two teenage boys with plenty of leftovers for our lunches tomorrow. What a way to use leftovers and extend our food budget. Thanks LadyGuin2!

This is a very good, simple and hearty dish.  I too found that thinly slicing the potatoes worked well, as well as adding the onions to the meat is order to make cooking go a little more quickly.  I used two large baking potatoes, and that was plenty of potato for us.  I would recommend adding a little garlic to the beef while it's browning as well.  The veggies I put in were shredded carrot and zucchini, but I think I'll try the green bean suggestion the next time I make it-- and there will definitely be a next time.

Good, basic, hearty. I sliced the potatoes to cook quicker, used 1/3c water, and added worchestershire to the soup mix before pouring. Took about 45 minutes and the potatoes were perfect. Good to eat with a fork, I wouldn't add more liquid.

I am giving this 4 stars based on the version I made, and knowing that it was meant to be a quick casserole.

I chopped up an onion and fried it with the meat while I put together some instant hash brown potatoes. I seasoned the beef with season salt, garlic salt and S&P. I put the beef & onion as the bottom layer, added the cream of mush soup, then the potatoes & some cheese--baked for 20 minutes. 

It turned out pretty much like a creamy shepard's pie, but we personally like that taste!

This recipe turned out well, I used about 1.5 Lbs of Hamburgers that I had BBQ a few nights earlier. Crumbled the meat, placed raw sweet onion over that and layered with the potatoes that I had not peeled I had just sliced. I used a casserole dish because I wanted it to be deeper not wider and added almost a full can of water to the soup and cooked it about an hour and  half. The pre-cooked burgers gave the meal a smokey flavor and because I didn't peel or cook anything before it went in the oven it only took a few minutes to prepare. The family ate it all that night.

We really enjoyed this. The only thing I did different was added another can of mushroom soup along with another 1/4 cup water because I had almost 1 1/2 pounds ground beef. I also only used 1 onion, that was fine for us. But this is very tasty as well as easy. I will make again! Thanks for sharing!

It was very good. I used some frozen potatoes o'brian that I had instead of dicing them myself. I also topped it w/ some grated provolone cheese. And I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. The taste of the provolone cheese blended well with this dish!

I did have a couple of problems with this casserole.  I apparently didn't dice the potatoes small enough--even after an hour of baking, many of the pieces were still hard.  Also, I agree with other reviews--I think 2 cans of soup would be necessary--my didn't turn out with much of a sauce.  Also, next time I'll dice the onion as well--my kids didn't like the big pieces of onion.

This recipe was really good. The first time I made it, it did it exactly by the recipe, and it took me 45 minutes to prepare, plus 1 hour to cook.  The second time I made it, I cooked the hamburger and onion together and used my food processor to slice the potatoes - which was quicker (about 20 minutes total), but I don't think it was as good as with the potatoes cubed.

I loved this recipe, although I did add a few ingredients.  I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and some lemon pepper to the hamburger mix.(I knew the family would enjoy this)  I also sliced my potatos with my mandelin to make them "slimer".  I also added some chopped garlic to the "soup mix".  My teenager said it tasted similar to my "scalloped potatos and hamburger meal" but she enjoyed it.

This is a great dish however it took too long to prepare.  Try boiling your potatoes then baking the dish for 20 min.  This works great and cuts down on the cooking time.

This was a good and quick recipe.  I cooked fresh garlic in with the ground beef and did not cook the onions before putting them into the dish.  I also sliced the potatoes lengthwise instead of cubing.  I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with no water added to them.  Also each layer needs to be salted and peppered. It turned out great, everyone loved it!

Very good recipe! I also added some garlic and chedder cheese and used ground turkey instead of beef. I raised the heat to 400 degrees instead of 350 degrees to try and avoid the potato problem and it worked. The potatoes were fully cooked. Big hit with the kids. Everyone wanted seconds.

Ok, but not a redo. Alternated recipe slightly per others recommendations. Used 2 cans of soup (cream of cheddar & mushroom), sauteed beef with onions and garlic together.  Added plenty of salt and light cajun seasoning to potatoes.  The recipe was still on the bland side.  Not worth the effort - hamburger helper is a lot easier and more flavorful.

I thought this recipe was great, but I did tweak it a bit.  First of all, I sliced the potatoes (like scalloped) instead of cubed.  I only used one onion and stuck with one can of 98 % fat free cream of celery (my husband doesn't like mushrooms) adding milk instead of water.  I seasoned the beef as it cooked with the onion and fresh garlic.  As I layered the dish, I added swiss cheese, salt, and pepper after each potato layer.  My husband is also not a casserole lover, but really did like this one!

I followed the directions but added sour cream to the soup mixture and only half the onion.  It was pretty good, my husband and Father-in-Law weren't home for dinner, but ate ALL the leftovers when they got home; they LOVED it!  Next time I will make a few changes: cook onion w/ meat (or leave raw, or use minced onion), use 2 lb meat, 8 potatoes, milk instead of water, not so many layers (potato, meat, onion, potato, soup), add mushrooms and chopped bell peppers on top of meat..and maybe put cheese on top.

This was pretty good. I was looking for something simple to send with my hubby for his lunch. Something that I didn't have to spend a lot of money on, and I had everything for this so I made it.  For those who think it needs more flavor, just season your meat while cooking. I did slice my potatoes using my slice and grater, since I was kind of pressed for time. I quartered them lenghtwise and then sliced. I baked this at about 450 for 40 minutes, I thought for sure the potatoes wouldn't be done because I checked them after 30 mins and they were a little crunchy, but 15 minutes later they were perfectly done. Thanks for the easy to throw together meal.

This was very tasty and easy, however my potatoes were underdone.  I put it back in for another 1/2 hour in the oven.  

Changes I made:  two cans of soup instead of one with a half a can of water; added thyme, salt and pepper to all layers; and sauteed mushrooms with the onions.  I would think that carrots and/or zucchini would also be good with the onions.

We didn't care for it at all this time.  I will try it again another time with changes.  This time, I took recommendations and substitutions.  I sliced the potatoes.  I cooked the onion (1 large) and hamburger together.  I seasoned the meat with garlic powder.  We don't like mushrooms, so I used one can of lower sodium cream of celery, and one can of cream of chicken, I mixed them together with one can of milk.  I used one layer of potatoes, a layer of meat, 1/2 of the soup mixture, another layer of potatoes, another layer of meat, and another layer of potatoes, then the rest of the soup mixture.  I covered with aluminum foil and cooked it for 1 hour.  The potatoes were not done at all.  We love onion, but there was too much.  My husband picked out the meat and ate it.  My daughter tried it and asked if she had to eat it.  I ate it, but it was very bland and disappointing.  If I try it again, I will boil the potatoes, use 1/2 the onion, and use one can of one of those Mexican flavored cheese soups with milk.

This was pretty good but i am really glad iadded fresh garlic and some italian seasoning.  I think it would have been kind of bland otherwise.  My kids loved this so i will make it again even though it didnt knock my socks off.

So quick to make! The family loved it. They said they would like me to cook it again. "Homely and nice" is how they described it. I will be making this dish again!

I made so many changes to this that it probably qualifies as a whole new recipe!  LOL!  First of all, I have to recommend that anyone making this use more ground beef; it definitely needs more.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup.  For the potatoes, I used most of a pound of frozen hashbrowns and 6 thawed hashbrown patties that I had left (day before payday!).  I cooked the meat with some worcestershire sauce and spices, which kept the beef from being too bland.  I also sprinkled on garlic powder and italian seasoning after each layer.  I used a higher temperature-425 degrees-but only needed to cook it for just under an hour.  When it was done, I grated on a little smoked cheddar and some french fried onions, and cooked for another 5 minutes.  We all loved this; my husband ate 3 plates of it!  My toddlers also wolfed it down, but they drink out of the toilet so they're not exactly gourmets...Next time I'm going to substitute cheddar cheese soup in place of the cream of chicken, and it *definitely* needs more hamburger.  Green beans would also have made it better, but we were out.  Overall, this one's definitely being made again in our house!

Well at least I'm not the only one who found this to be 'hoh-hum'.  However my husband didn't mind it.  I found it to be very bland - won't be making again.

I have never given 1 Star before but this was bland & boring and that was with using the help of some other reviewers - Took suggestions and added more onion, also added frozen peas and mushrooms, garlic, definitely need 2 cans of mushroom soup and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic to give it some pizazz.  To no avail - it was edible but I made it on a Mon. and the leftovers sat there the entire week - never happens in my house!!  I'm throwing out the leftovers today (Sat.)

This was so good! I added other bits of leftovers I had in the fridge like BBQ'ed bratworsts and veggies. We don't like potatoes too much here so we added less than called for. I like this recipe because you can use up all the small amounts of leftovers in one yummy dish.

This recipe was delicious.   For added punch, I put some sliced mushrooms in the ground beef when I was browning it.  After my other half tasted this he said 'This is a keeper.   Don't lose the recipe."

True, it is bland so I added a few things: Spinach in the sauted onions, oyster sauce and cayene in the ground beef and a little worcestershire sauce in the soup mix...and cheddar on top!  Yummy.

Good winter dish!  Adding 2 cans of soup as some reviewers suggested means a bit longer cooking time so just be prepared. I thought it needed a topping and used crushed Cornflakes and shredded cheese. Good with a side salad.

I like this recipe because my son is a very picky eater and because it is cheap!  I usually have onions, potatoes and cream of mushroom soup on hand, too.  It was easy and good.  I will make it again.

I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and instead of fresh onion i used dried minced onion. I sliced the potatoes instead of cutting into cubes and let cook about a half hour longer to make sure the potatoes were done. This was absolutely delicious!! I really loved this dish as did my husband and kids. Because of all the reviews mentioning green beans, I cooked these on the side and they did pair well (and mix well) with it. I will be making this again! Big hit here!

This had a great flavor. I used minced onions to substitute the real onion because I hate the hassle of chopping onions. I didn't have a creamy sauce outcome I followed the do creations as is minus the onion. It came out literally meat and potatoes. I served it with some ketchup. My significant other went back for second helpings. This definitely has potential.

Just average as given.   I read a lot of recipes and added one can of cut green beans.  I upped the oven temperature to 375 and baked it for 1 hour, 20 minutes = perfect.  It needs cheese!!  I made as given due to a guest not eating cheese.

Fantastic recipe! Made it last night and the roomie and I both loved it. I did, however, use two cans of soup mixed with milk rather than water as suggested by several other reviews, and also added a bit of garlic salt as well. I will also boil the potatoes a bit first next time, as they cooked for an hour and a half before they were done. Other than that, this was super delicious and I will definitely make this again and again!

This was ok. I made it last night for the 6 of us and it was pretty bland.  I ended up adding cheddar cheese, and quite a few different herbs and spices to make it flavorful.  I would make this again but I would chop up jalapeno's and mix in for added flavor.

I sauteed in EVOO, onion; red, yellow, orange, and green bell pepper; added ground beef; salt; pepper, and granulated garlic. Meanwhile, I "baked" six small Russet potatoes in the microwave. Cubed the cooked potatoes and added to the skillet. Let the potatoes start to brown. Remove from heat. Transfer mixture to oven-safe casserole dish. Add one can of cream of mushroom soup and one cup of grated cheddar cheese. Mix. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. We called ours "PaPa Casserole", because we made it for grandpa. We served with fresh, ripe tomato slices on the side. Yum! Much better than the Hamburger Helper my parents suggested for dinner :-/

Great jumping off point, but I made many changes. I began by browning 2 1/2 lbs of ground beef with one onion and a healthy shake of garlic salt. Then I peeled and diced 10 small potatos and mixed those well with salt and pepper. I mixed two cans of soup with one can of milk and two heaping TBSP of sour cream. I layered these into my crock pot first half of the potatoes then half of the beef mixture. Atop the beef I placed 1/2 C. of monterrey jack cheese. I then added one cup of frozen corn on top of this layer before pouring half of the soup over the top. Then I repeated with the rest of the potato, beef, and cheese  layers before pouring the rest of the soup mixture over that. Sprinkled loads of paprika on top. I cooked this for 2 hours on high 1 on low and it came out delicious. Not salty enough, but next time I'll add a sharper cheese. I will most assuredly try this again.

My DH loved this. The first time I made it I realized that I had a can of cream of celery in my pantry and no cream of mushroom. I took a chance and prayed for the best. We have never even tried it with cream of mushroom. It was so good with the other!

Good solid meal.  My family enjoyed it.  Just beware of the name, its not jiffy, it has to cook for at least an hour.  I made a few modifications.  I used about 7 potatoes, browned my onions with my meat which was ground turkey.  I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and mixed with milk instead of water.  My family had seconds and are already fighting over who will take the leftover for lunch.  Thanks LadyGuin2

I've made this quite a few times and it is great. The last 2 times I would cube up and parboil 2 potatoes then take a bag of shredded southwestern potatoes and use them. I gave it a real good flavor. My whole family loves this recipe.

This is by far my favourite recipe from this site. I make it for my husband AT LEAST once a month but usually more like 2 or 3 times a month. We can't get over how good it tastes!! And I can't get over how fast and easy it is!! Now if only I could find someone to peel the potatoes for me.....

This turned out really well! I decided to cut down the amount of onion to 1/2 an onion, added 2 16 ounce cans of green beans and 1/2 pound mushrooms (sauteed with the onions).  Also used ground turkey instead of beef and thought I'd give golden mushroom soup (2 cans) a try as we're not big fans of cream of mushroom soup.  I seasoned the layers with cajun seasoning and baked it at 400 degrees for an hour and 10 minutes.  The soup ended up being very much like gravy, and we really enjoyed it.  I think it would have been really good just as written, too, and next time plan to use the full amount of onion.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make it again!

Thank you for this recipe.  I was looking for a way to use up some leftover beef and this worked out great.  I did use two cans of soup as others recommended with a little water, and sliced the potatoes very thin.  It only took about 45 minutes in the oven.  My husband and fil loved it!

This casserole is really good, especially on a cold winter night. I liked it even better heated up the next day for lunch. Mine turned out a bit bland, so I melted a layer of shredded cheddar cheese over the top after it was done. Next time I'll add a lot more pepper and season it up a little bit. I gave it 4 stars, because this recipe takes quite a while to make with all the chopping and the 1 hour cook time. I'm not sure why it's called Jiffy casserole because it was anything but quick.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made to it was that i shredded some velveeta cheese and put it on top along with some mozzarella cheese. It was absolutly delicious. I do not eat onions but the sauted onions in this made the dish. A++++ I will make again.

My husband and I loved it!  I added baby carrots and sliced the potatoes.  Also threw in some garlic and onion powders and only used one onion.  Oh, and since we don't like mushrooms, I used cream of celery-it worked just fine!

Pretty good for a poor-man's-type casserole. I added tomato sauce to the soup for a different taste, and it was ok, but I think I'll leave it out next time. I also added shredded cheddar cheese for the last few minutes of baking, and that added a great touch.

I wanted to make something different besides my regular beef and potato casserole. I like mine a bit better.  I use 2 cans tomato soup and add frozen corn. Nice and hearty in cooler weather.

YUM! I added fresh mushrooms as an extra layer on top of the ground beef. Next time I make it, I'm going to add shredded cheese on top while it bakes. We are big cheese eaters! Very easy! Very fast! Very yummy!

Everyone in my family liked this.  The only thing I did differently was adding a layer of fresh mushrooms, and  throwing a little fresh garlic in with the meat as it cooked.  VERY easy and it was nice to just throw together what most people have handy in their pantry and come out with something not only edible but tasty too!  (oh, I forgot that I also chopped up just ONE onion and cooked it with the meat, too!)

I added shredded hash browns on top of this casserole, and sprayed lightly with cooking oil so it browned.  My husband really liked it - said it was very Sheppard-pie'ish!  My daughter and I didn't care for this - hence the 3 stars!

I made this recipe twice and we liked it.  I think some of the not so glowing reviews missed the "jiffy" part of the title.  Yes, I cooked the onions and meat together also.  I did add a bit of garlic and seasoned salt.  After the dish was cooked, I added a layer of chopped olives.  And I set out sour cream, which several people said was a good addition.  The second time I made it, I didn't have enough potatoes, so I supplemented with a cup or two of cooked brown rice.  I almost always have some cooked brown rice in the fridge, so it didn't slow me down.  This is a keeper because it's QUICK! and also tasty.

I read the other reviews and made some modifications- added more soup, sliced the potatoes and cooked the onion with the ground beef.  We did not like it.  My daughter didn't like it, my husband picked at it, and I just didn't care for it.  It's too bland- and that was after I added garlic powder and marjoram.  Plus, using a cream soup with ground beef just creates a dish that doesn't look appetizing at all.  Maybe that played a part.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe was good. I didn't repeat the layers and cooked the beef and the onion together. I would like to try it with another type of soup like cream of brocolli and use ground chicken instead of beef. Thanks.

I was leery, but based on feedback I gave it a try. It's actually very good, but only 3 stars b/c it's hardly an impressive dish. I only used 3 potatoes and 3/4 # hamburger as a result of feedback ("needs more hamburger"). Will omit onion next time (I love onions, but the flavor was all wrong in this recipe) and replace with canned green beans for some color. Great meat and potatoes meal for family (not guests!).

This is just like the description says...quick, easy and tasty!  I did slice the potatos with my pampered chef slice and grate (awesome kitchen tool!!) which worked out great...I do think it needs more like 1 1/2 pounds of meat though!  Didn't change anything else and it was awesome...I will make this again!

It was okay, took a while to prepare and made a few extra dirty dishes.  It was like the hamburger helper in taste.  I won't be making it again.  We didn't even eat the leftovers.

This is yummy and fairly easy to throw together.  Like previous reviews, I also use two cans of mushroom soup. I always use sweet onions, like Vidalia, when available.  Thanks Judith.

With a few minor alterations we thought this was great! I sauteed green pepper with the onion and substituted a small can of tomato juice for the water. Sprinkled a small amount of cayenne on the hamburger layer and it was a wonderful casserole. Will definitely do this one again. Diane

It was very simple to make, but it needs a little "something" extra, a "boost" if you will. I sliced the potatoes lengthwise to simplify it even further...It was a nice change from our old standby's!

It needs a little something extra as far as spices, and I added cheese to the top.  Overall it was pretty tasty, I think I will make it again but maybe get a little more creative next time.

I seasoned the hamburger, but it was still a little bland.  Needs ketchup or cheese or something.  Maybe cheese soup instead of mushroom would improve it.  I left the skins on the potatoes and sliced them very thin, and they cooked fine.  Overall, this dish is okay, but nothing to write home about.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The potatoes were not cooked through after an hour.  Also, there is not enough meat in the recipe, you can hardly taste it at all.

I put my own touch to this. I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and added milk and Worcestershire to the sauce. I also cut down on the onion and added carrots, cellery, and green peppers. I added cheese on top near the end of baking. I thought it tasted great!

Good recipe--made some changes. Chopped onions and sliced the potatoes thin, added garlic powder to meat, mixed meat and onion together--used part milk, part heavy cream instead of water to the soup and added a little grated cheese in between layers. My family loved it!

My family enjoyed this easy meal.  I used my julienn cutter to slice the potatoes, and they all cooked fine.  I too thought it needed a little something.  Seasoning salt will be my next addition.

Lovely and tasty but would use less onions next time and you must cut potatoes really small to get them to cook in the time allowed, but would definately make again. Thanks Judith from the UK.
