This came out better than restaurant conch fritters!! I made a couple of changes, I used 1/4 cup corn flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour, used 2 cups of conch (be sure to chop them up real small, I chopped them up too big), omitted onion and bell pepper. This came out so good. I can't wait to cook them for company.

I lived in the US Virgin Islands for 6yrs.  I would have to say after eating conch fritters for at least that long, that these are just as good, if not better.

I have tried this recipe only to find that it does very well without adding green peppers.  Still has great taste.
I had to increase the flour to a full cup I also added approx. 4 full conch, not all markets sell just one cup.
Dipping sauce was too mayonaise based so I reduced that to 1 tsp and added equal amount of horseradish sauce for a nice kick and taste.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it is DELICIOUS!!! it's hard to find authentic recipes like this unless your from the islands but this one is spot on. Being from the USVI, this is one of my favorite Sunday recipes and your recipe is exact to mine exept I serve my fritters with a mango and papaya chutney dipping sauce and my family loves it every  Sunday along with some stew conch and rice.  Here is my version; ) I do everything stated in this recipe except you might have to add a bit more flour and milk and I also add 1/2 cup of cornmeal. I also use puerto rican sweet peppers minced instead of bell peppers and if I so use bell peppers it's minced red bell pepper. I also add a packet of sazon And/or a boullibon cube for that added flavor and my choice of seasoning salt is lawrys. I never leave out the celery peppers or onions what is an island dish without them!!!!! Instead for those who don't like the "crunchy" taste it gives the fritter mincing the celery and peppers and chopping the onion real small( not minced) then frying the batter on  low heat will cook the batter thoroghly and soften the veggies, it will take longer but the flavor is worth it!!! I also add a little chopped cilantro for some extra flavor then serve up with some mango papay chutney and enjoy( I've never tried the dipping sauce recipe.) also we pressure cook our conch for 30-60 min. in the islands or boil for 1-2 hrs in a pot with water and tsp of vinegar. Some also tenderize it before boiling.

Yes I've died and gone to heaven... absolutely wonderful!!  I actually had some crab too in the freezer so I mixed up some batter to use with the crab.. HUGE HIT too!!  The only thing I didn't use was the green pepper and that's only because I actually don't care for it and the sauce is good but I just ate these babies by the handful so I kind of missed out on the sauce!

Fritters were a wonderful consistency and very easy.  I used crab as the meat and left out the green peppers.  I had to double the recipe, as wanted to use it as a main entree.  Even doubled, it yielded only 6 fist sized fritters.  Threw in some canned corn and felt I added a lot of the spices.  They could have used more, maybe next time will try with some jalepenos, or a hotter sauce. Will do again and want to try different types of fish.

I LOVE this recipe. After a couple trips to the Bahamas I was craving conch fritters and stumbled upon this recipe. So I took a chance and tried it... tastes just like what we had in the Bahamas! I'm a little heavy handed on the spice but all my friends love these. By the way, it tastes just as good with crabmeat. Around here (suburban NY) I can't find fresh conch or crab, but I have found canned versions of both. These fritters are soooo addictive and easy to make!!

this is a fab recipes - my husband is from the Bahamas and LOVES IT! Because here in NJ Conch is very hard to find, I have used shrimp cleaned and diced into small pieces with all the other ingredients I left the same. I can't wait to make this for my friends 'International Party' this coming weekend!! Thanks~ Susanne :)

Everyone complemented me on these! And everyone was grabbing for more! This was a recipe that needed little to no "tweeking." My only advice is to really pound out the conch so it is nice and tender. I also threw the veggies in the food processor and gave it a few spins and then the conch just to add nice smooth textures. People complimented me on how they didnt have any rough nuggets of conch like some restaurants the have visited.

Better than mile marker 105 in Key Largo.  The only thing is that I only use red onion and mix red and green pepper.  Really adds umph! To make a thicker batter so it doesn't drip all over the place is I use 1 cup flour and 1 medium egg.  Very thick and easy to use my cookie scoopers.  I mix all dry ingredients together and add veggies and filler (crab, ground chicken, chopped shrimp, conch) into dry mix before adding liquids.  Much easier to get uniform mix when doing this.  All in all, this recipe is fantastic on its own.  Enjoy!!!!!

This recipe was awesome! I substituted the celery with cilantro and it came out fantastic.  I also used my meat grinder to grind the conch along with the green pepper, onions and garlic. It gave it a more even texture. Thank you so much for sharing this. It will surely remain one of my family's favorites.

Yummy! I substituted clams for the conch. Didn't have any green peppers, and they came out great! The hardest part was prepping the fresh clams. Otherwise this recipe is a definite keeper.

This was really great I added cornmeal & parsley flakes with the flour, I also tenderized the conch with a meat mallet prior to cutting it to small pieces so they conch will be tender. The only reason I  am giving this recipe 4stars is because the sauce was just okay but the conch fritters were excellent!

Cynthia this was OUTSTANDING! I made this last night for our New Years Eve hors' devours table and I was very surprised by the outcome! Most of the conch fritters I have had at restaurants were more like hush puppies. These had a unique shape, great texture and just the right mix of all ingredients. This will go into our favorites cookbook binder for sure! Thanks for posting!

I sailed all over the Caribbean and had conch fritters in a lot of different Islands. This a really fine recipe.I give it a five star rating. I did however add red bell pepper to it and about a 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs and it was still Delicious. Added it to my Favorites. Thanks Cynthia.

Excellent!!  This is almost the recipe I’ve been making for years!  I’ve been living in the Bahamas for 25 years and we’re all about conch.  I put the conch in a food processor or you can put it through a meat grinder.  I also double the amount called for and add 1 teaspoon baking powder and 2 tablespoons ketchup or tomato paste to the mixture.  I only put 1 stalk of celery in it.  For my dipping sauce I use horseradish sauce instead of mayo for some tang.

I used corn and scallions. I used an ice cream scooper for shape, and made sure the consistency of dough was good enough to stick. I used hungry jack buttermilk pancake mix and after completing the recipe, they were gone fast.

We had some frozen conch--diced and bought a little fryer. We were all so impressed at how close these were to the Bahamas version.  We were in heaven! We used twice the conch required so it was a lot of conch and just enough batter!

I didn't have celery so I just put 1/3 green pepper and 1/3 onion chopped fine with 2 conchs.  I just added enough milk (I used canned) to moisten it.  Also added 1 tsp of baking powder. Never made them before.  We took them over to the neighbors that are true islanders (We are in Cayman Brac) and they said they are the best on the island.  They asked me to make more for their upcoming party.

I made it with Phillips canned crab claw meat and it was superb! Can't get conch meat in my area without robbing Fort Knox ! I did have to add a little more flour to make it easier to mold into shape. I used OldBay as always when making crab.

A winner recipe!!

The only thing that I might change is the dipping sauce as it seems to have too much lime juice for my liking.

I was able to get conch on a visit to Key West. Froze it and brought it to Ohio with me. This recipe is wonderful and takes me back to the Bahamas every time I make it. Thanks for sharing.

Made these for dinner tonight and they were very good… but we've had a lot of good fritters in the Caribbean and we're a little spoiled.  I did leave the celery out because that just didn't sound right (couldn't think of any I've ever had that had celery in therm).  Like others have suggested, I used about 1/2 cornmeal and 1/2 all purpose flour.  I think next time I will try self-rising flour -- that's what I use in my hush puppies and it yields a nice, fluffy hush puppy… these fritters were flat, not round and fluffy.  We didn't care for the sauce at all, but preferred to just use cocktail sauce.  Overall, it's a very good recipe that curbed our craving for our favorite caribbean treat… but I will try tweaking it a little more next time.

This was absolutely perfect. I don't have conch where I live, but I wanted a conch recipe to adapt for periwinkles. It was perfectly complimentary to the periwinkle flavor!
