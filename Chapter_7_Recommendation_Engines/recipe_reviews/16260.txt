I made this twice exactly by recipe. While it is very good, it had an odd taste that a few in the family did not like. I omitted the garlic and changed the soup to cream of celery (added fresh mushrooms with carrots, though), and it was a bit better, but still not perfect. I tried with the celery soup and no garlic, again, BUT added three tblsp. worceshire sauce (4 lb. roast) and THAT was the winning combo! 

Everytime I made the roast, I added over one lb. of baby carrots and two stalks of celery to bottom of crockpot. After 7 or 8 hours, I added bite-sized cut red potatoes (skin on) on top. Cooked 9 to 10 hours every time for perfect doneness of veggies and meat, as well as moist meat. Cooking on LOW is best.

For those who don't like cream soups, replace with a can of beef broth, add the worceshire, and dredge the roast with flour before browning. This will give you a grand, flavorful result, too.

HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS NOT MENTIONED: If you're cooking this for 8+ hours with a 2lb chuck roast and adding potatoes, celery and carrots, I suggest adding 1C of beef broth or the whole can (2C).  A beef bouillon diluted in 1C of hot/boiling water also works.  I cooked the garlic in the oil that I browned the meat.  Have no idea why 16 was the magic number of carrots for her recipe, but I just put as many as I feel my family will eat.  Sometimes we add some onions ...sometimes we don't if our guests don't like them.  It makes no difference.  I definitely recommend adding a 1.5T of Worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf.  I also sprinkle some McCormick's Slow Cookers Hearty Beef Stew seasoning package like other reviewers recommend when making other recipes on this site.  Big difference!  This finished sooner than I thought (4hrs - 2lb meat), but I continued to cook it until we ate dinner (10-12 hrs), and it just got better with time (but needed more liquid).  While there was still gravy in the end, there wasn't that much.  I spray PAM along the sides if it looks like it's burning, and it works like a charm!  If you use this for beef stroganoff over some noodles, you must add 4oz of cream cheese right before serving for it to truly taste like traditional stroganoff!  When I feel like having potatoes on the side, I use the honey potato recipe (1 lb red potatoes quartered, 1T butter, 3T honey, and 1t dry mustard - bake 40 min). My toddlers love this!

I love this recipe and use it every time I make a roast.  I use a shoulder roast and add potatoes.  It's really good if you use Campbell's Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup. Adds a little extra flavor.  I have also found that the slower and longer you can let it cook, the better.  I have been rushed before and cooked it on high in my crock pot for less time and the meat comes out tough.  This is a great recipe to start early on a Sunday morning for a delicious Sunday dinner!

Wonderful roast - I didn't bother browning it though. I used a 3lb. roast and put it over a layer of portabella mushrooms. I added 1/4 cup of beef broth and 3 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce along with 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup. I also added the garlic and parsley. I left out the carrots and cooked this on low for 8 hours. It was falling apart and delicious!

I made this twice, once with a two pound blade roast and the other with a 4 pound cross rib roast - both times I added a few drops of Worchestershire sauce, and both times about the best roast we have ever had! Not at all dry and very, very tasty. We had the leftovers with gravy on bread so we could enjoy it all over again. I cooked the roasts for about 9 hours.

This is one of my most favorite recipes!  It is so very good and DH loves it.  I add potatoes to mine and a can of beef broth.  I saute the garlic in the oil used to brown the roast and then add the broth and the cream of mushroom soup.  It is a family favorite!

I'm giving this a 5 even though it was a little bland. I was ecstatic when I found a Laura's Lean Beef roast at Target! It was only 2 pounds, so I searched for a recipe using a 2 pounder. Definitely use at least double the amount of carrots- I made it as written & wished I had used more. I also would cut down on the onion & maybe use the mushroom soup with either herbs or extra garlic. The cut of meat was totally lean- & fell apart! I took the suggestion of cooking for 7 hours & that was perfect- being that it is such a small roast. Turned out really tender & the amount of gravy was perfect. Thanks Erica!

Purty darn good slow cooked pot roast! Hubby loved it. The second time I made it I used beef stew meat and added a cup of beef broth and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. It makes a wonderful beef stew too!

This was fantastic!

We seasoned the roast with a rub composed of 2 cloves of fresh crushed garlic and a 1/2 tsp.salt and 1/4 tsp of black pepper prior to browning. We also added a 1/4tsp of crushed red pepper and an additional two cloves of sliced garlic to the oil while it heated prior to browning; after that, we followed the recipe.

Thank you for sharing!

Some have suggested adding dried onion soup mix to this recipe. Don't do it, unless you really crave salt and are very healthy. The recipe doesn't need it. As is I would rate this great tasting recipe a 4. It's good, it's fast to make, and it makes a tender roast, good enough for company. To jazz it up this time, I cooked the roast straight from the freezer following the recipe. Left it on high for a couple of hours before turning to low. I added fresh mushrooms, a dab of worchestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar (about 1 tsp. each. My roast was 1.66 pounds. I should have added more.). Cooked until the meat could be shredded.
I shredded the meat. Added it back into the gravy and veggies and added some sour cream. Less than 1 cup. This made a strogenoff like mixture. I had some leftover spaghetti pasta that just had a dash of chili powder on it and a little olive oil, black pepper and some no salt and served the recipe over the pasta. Yum! I made a salad to go with. Oh, I used a low salt mushroom soup. I should have made my own, but didn't have the time to do so this morning. I left out the garlic as I can't have it. Still was very flavorful, a great tender roast.

The key here, as one other reviewer found, is to use cream of celery soup rather than the mushroom soup called for. I also left out garlic; one can always sprinkle on garlic salt or powder to the finished product on the plate, if desired. Truly a WONDERFUL sauce; didn't even thicken it, and it was just right. SO good that I ate it the next day as a vegetarian meal without the meat! Truly, it is crucial to the flavor of the dish to sear the meat before putting it into the crock pot. Do NOT skip this step; you'll notice the difference! One more piece of advice; pour about 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire into the soup mixture; gives a wonderful nother dimension of flavor to this dish.

I will be using this recipe from now on, we loved it.  I just added a couple additional items:  Potatoes, carrots and quartered onion layered the bottom of my large crock pot.  Browned both sides of 3.65 lbs roast on top of stove then placed on top of veggies.  Next I mixed 1 can condensed mushroom soup, 1 pkg of dry onion soup mix and 1 cup of beef broth together.  Then I added some minced garlic to the liquid.  Also added some garlic to the roast pot as well as some cilantro leaves-left out the parsley.  Then I added the liquid mixture to the roast and veggies.  Also added a few shakes of worcester sauce.  Cooked for approx. 9 hours.  Added chopped celery in the last 2 hours of cook time.  Lots of liquid in ending result, making a wonderful and flavorful gravy.  Thanks...

I have done roasts basically this way for years and they always turn out great. Someone mentioned about "an odd taste that a few in the family did not like". It could well be that the roast took on a burned taste if it was actually browned on all sides for 15 minutes over med-high heat. That is much too long for the browning process. Two or three minutes on each side is plenty of time at that temp and anything longer would give it a hard, possibly burned crust.

Excellent recipe. I noticed that everyone adds their special spice here and there, but thats OK, because everyone is different and has their own tastes. I'm no different. I've made it exactly like the recipe calls for and it's great. After a few meals, I too started adding a few items. I always cube a few potatoes and slice 1 1/2 sweet onions to the roast. Like some others, I add a tablespoon of L&P sauce. I also add one teaspoon of Gravy Master browning sauce, one teaspoon of liquid smoke and a can of cream of potato soup. This is all done using a 2 lb. roast. (I like to use Londoin Broil.) Just remember, everyone has different tastes, and no change in this recipe should be considered right or wrong. Also remember that Erica's original recipe makes a perfect roast, too.

My family didn't love this - not sure why.  I've never cooked with canned soup before - maybe it was that.  But it did make a nice, although fatty, gravy (and my meat was not very fatty).  

But here's something that may be interesting - because I put 2 roasts in the pot, after 9 hours the meat was still chewy.  I had sliced up all the meat, but after dinner, returned all the leftovers to the crock pot with the gravy and cooked another two hours.  Then it was nice and tender.  So it is possible to return roast to cooking even after it's cooled and improve the texture.

I have made this recipe for at least 50 years.  I sear a 3-5# roast in a Dutch oven, with onions.  Add the mushroom soup, onion soup, little Worchestershire sauce, potatoes and a bag of baby carrots.  Put it in the oven at 350* for 3 hours.  Then I go to church.  When I come home it is to a complete meal, already cooked.   Too easy.   I have also done it in a slow cooker when I had to work all day....Turned out about the same.  Great recipe!!  I think a chuck roast works best....more flavor...

Really good, and made the house smell amazing all day.  Cooked in a Crockpot for 8 hours.  I omitted garlic and parsley.  I did brown the meat beforehand.  I used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup and 1/2 can of Beef Broth and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.  The meat was literally falling apart.  Will make again!

This is a great recipe. I do suggest using canned beef and mushroom soup if you can find it. Some stores don't have it but it makes a huge difference in roast and stews that have any type of beef in them. I also use a bay leaf and add all of the veggies you list. I love your recipe as is too but I do change soups to the dehydrated ones sometimes or add along with the mushroom soup. Thanks for this one!

This was great- so tender and delicious.  I used Pacific Foods Natural Cream of Chicken soup, a pound of baby carrots, and added a few potatoes too.  We ate this with peas and Quick and Easy Yorkshire Pudding, also from this site.  This did not look like it'd make much gravy at first, but by the time we ate it, there was plenty.  Cooked on High for 1.5 hours, then set the temp to Low and this was ready to eat in about 6 hours.  (I used a meat thermometer to make sure).

THIS WAS AWESOME. I DO NOT USUALLY CARE MUCH FOR POT ROAST BECAUSE IT ALWAYS COMES OUT DRY. THE SEARING PROCESS MUST BE THE SECRETE. EVERYTHING ELSE I DID THE SAME EXCEPT I ADDED ABOUT 2 TEASPOONS OF 'BETTER THAN BOUILLON' BRAND BOUILLON TO THE GRAVEY WHICH GAVE A VERY RICH FLAVOR.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  'BTB'. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN REGULAR BOUILLON; THE 'VEGETABLE BASE' IS BEST AND IT IS USED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS REGULAR BOUILLON.

An important watchword of the reviews has been the reminder to keep enough liquid in the pot throughout the cooking; to aid in this process, I always add about a half cup of good red wine; obviously it also imparts a wonderful subtle flavor, as well.

Try using Golden Mushroom soup instead of the regular - more flavor and a brown gravy, not white. Good recipe and a litttle Worchester sauce certainly perks it up.

It was to be a very long and busy day today. I had a 3 1/2 lb boneless chuck in the freezer and decided I'd do this with it. I was out of carrots so I didn't add those. I didn't bother to brown the meat since it was frozen. I just put it in the crockpot. I didn't add any liquid but it made a lot of good gravy. The meat was so tender it was nearly falling apart.  It also browned nicely. No knife was needed to cut this.

Truly my favorite roast beef dinner ever.  Used 3 cloves of garlic not 4 and cookedon low for 8 hours.   Peeled red potatoes, carrots and onion on bottom, then browned  rump roast. Vegies cooked to perfection! Roasst could note be more tender. My husband says it is better thann his Moms.  And believe me that is really saying something.  This is def.  a KEEPER

I like this kind of recipes.  Easy yet good and tweakable.  I am not sure why so many people have bad experience with this.  Perhaps different brand of canned soup used?  I used Campbell.  And I brown the meat using a cast iron skillet until it is dark using high heat to keep the moisture inside the meat.  I can definitely tell that browning makes a difference, especially the gravy.  It is what gives the gravy the dark brown color.  In addition, I added a cup of chicken broth.

Don't need to add water or broth to crock pot- soup and roast will liquify plenty and the gravy will be thick and yummy also.

Cooked my first beef roast with this recipe. The delicious smells tortured the whole family all day, and we weren't disappointed when dinner time arrived! The roast was really moist, and had a creamy taste. I served it with potatoes, corn, and green beans. The juice from the roast also made a wonderful gravy for the potatoes. 
Thank you for such an awesome recipe!

Very tasty! I threw the onions & some potatoes in while I seared the meat, which carmelized the onions & cut my crock pot time since I didn't have 8 hours. Simple & delicious.

I had a slightly larger chuck roast than the recipe called for. I think it would have been better if I had taken the time to trim all the fat off because I ended up with very greasy gravy. Also, I think mine needed a second can of cream of mushroom soup as I had very little gravy after cooking for the prescribed amount of time. It was really good though.

To die for! Two cans of soup and a good splash of Worcestershire sauce and my trusty Italian herb mix. The beef was frozen and nine hours later it was so tender I had to serve it with a fork.

I bought a sirloin tip roast by mistake (it was mixed in the top round roasts), so needed a recipe to fit.  This one worked quite well.  Here's my changes:  If you have the time, slow cook the roast one day, wrap the roast and store the gravy separately.  Then slice the roast very thin the next day.  About an hour before dinner combine the slices with the gravy and simmmer on low.  In addition, I used an entire pound of baby carrots and added the celery and red wine as suggested by previous reviewers.  Served with golden mashed potatoes to sop up all that good gravy.  This is a good stick-to-the-ribs fall/winter dinner.  My husband loved it.

Very good.  I added some other veggies (about 5 potatoes and 2 stalks of celery, cut up), 1 cup of beef broth and 2 Tbsp Worcestshire.    Next time I may add add'l spices to jazz it up a bit.

I'll also have to experiment with different soups and cuts of meat.  I used a 3.5 lb boneless chuck roast which I thought would be perfect, but it actually ended up on the tough/stringy side.  Could've just been that particular roast, though.  Was in the slow cooker about 6.5 hours on Low.

I used to make this a lot years and years ago.  Glad you jogged my memory about it.  I think I'll make it this week.  It's wonderful.  I love to read the reviews and how others adjust to their tastes.  I pick and choose those ideas that would suit my family.  I understand the ratings are based on their changes.  The original recipes give us a good jumping off place.  I have taken some wonderful recipes from this site and picked some tweaks for my family and just got RAVE reviews from company.  Thanks to all for your ideas.

This was awesome. I tweaked it a little by adding 2 celery stalks with leaves which flavored the gravy nicely. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of broccoli soup and a ½ cup of beef broth. I cut off all of the fat from a cross rib roast, tenderized it all over with a multi-blade meat tenderizer tool and browned the meat in a preheated skillet over high heat for only a couple of minutes per side. The meat was melt in your mouth tender and the gravy was delicious. There is no need to mince the garlic, just crush the garlic cloves with the handle of a knife and peel the husks from the cloves. No need to chop the celery either because you won’t be eating it, it’s just added for flavoring the meat and the gravy.

I used the leftover meat and onions with some raw diced potatoes the next day for making roast beef hash and it was excellent.

Thank you Erica for posting your recipe!

Note: A multi-blade meat tenderizer tool is a must for tenderizing lower grades and cuts of meat. It breaks up the tough fibers in the meat. Use of a tenderizer tool also allows more marinade to penetrate into the meat. I have the Deni brand that has 49 razor sharp blades in a 2”x2” square pattern. Unfortunately I haven’t seen them in department stores. I had to buy mine on the internet. Jaccard is another good brand of a meat tenderizer.

Great recipe.  Followed except for the garlic and parsley due to personal preference.  I saw there was not going to be enough gravy so I added l l/2 cups of beef broth to the mushroom soup along with a few shakes of worchestershire for flavor and color.  Due to time, I didn't use the crock pot but put the onions, carrots and roast in a covered roaster, topped with the gravy mixture, and baked it at 350 for 3 hours.  With l l/2 hours to go, I added some quartered potatoes with the skin on.  Turned out tender and perfect.  As others stated, be sure and brown your roast.

This was good, but I thought the mushroom soup was a bit much.  Next time I'll try something different or just do broth, and then make gravy.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion of adding a bit of worcestershire, and balsamic vinegar.  That added some flavor.

Made this tonight - so good!  I used golden cream of mushroom soup and like some of the other reviews - I added Worcestershire and a cup of Beef Broth to the soup.  I also added celery to the veggies.  I will absolutely make this again.

I'm giving the base recipe 5 starts but my cooker must be running hot. It is a newer 7qt Rival and if I hadn't gotten home early today I would have had mush, even though it would have been good tasting mush! I didn't have the creamed soup so I used a can of condensed beef broth, pack of Lipton's onion soup, 2T of Worcestershire sauce, and a 1/2t each of garlic and onion powder.  I also added lots of potatoes, carrots, celery and a quartered onion. Made some gravy from the drippings after straining and had a great dinner with plenty of leftovers!!

I have never wrote a review, and I knew that I had to for this recipe, I made this with a few modifications, but here is what I did. I browned my roast in olive oil, then browned garlic in the oil that I browned my meat in. I set the meat aside and i had put 1 can of cream of celery soup in the crock pot, as well as 1 can of beef broth, about a lb of green beans, 3 red potatoes, the garlic, 1/2 onion quartered, and then put the roast on top, then I sprinkled about 1 tsp(I eyeballed it) of Ms Dash on top of the roast, as well as about 1 T of Daddy Hinkles on top then set it on low for 13 hrs, and OMG it was divine!!

This recipe was so easy, and very tasty.  I wished there were potatoes included, but they always get mushy when I add them to a roast, so I cut up some potatoes, boiled them for 10 minutes, then threw them into the slow cooker for about 30 minutes to pick up the flavour of the gravy.  Delicious.

I used the standardized recipe. I shared the meal with friends who said that it was the best pot roast they'd ever eaten. I even got the comment, "This might be better than my grandma's." It also made my entire apartment smell delicious!

Nice change from all the recipes that use tomato.  Makes a nice gravy and it's fast.. I added three large potatoes quartered on the bottom, definitely a keeper.

hubby liked it; I put in onion soup mix as some of the reviewers suggested and I didn't care for the onion flavor.  I think it would have been better w/out the onion mix added.
the roast was wonderfully tender and the gravy was yummers!

I thought that this roast came out great with one modification.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a packet of lipton onion soup mix.  My friends thought it was great, and was even better the next day!

This was very good.  The gravy was wonderful and so easy.  I always struggled makeing gravy out of the slow cooker.  Because other said this recipe did not have a lot of flavor I added worchestershire sauce Italian seasoning,salt and pepper. I will be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe!  I used a 4.5 lbs roast which I cooked for 2 hours on high, then 5 hours on low.  I altered the recipe a little by shaking some worcestershire sauce over the beef first, and adding 2 cans mushroom soup with 1 cup water and 2 beef oxo sachets for the gravy mixture.  When it was done I thickened the gravy with a little "Bisto Brown Gravy" thickening powder.  I was glad that I read the reviews before making this.  After hearing all the wonderful comments about the carrots...I anticipated much delight for these at my dinner table, so I used about 40 carrots and 2 onions!  This recipe was such a hit...and I've now just told my mother about it and she's going to make it this weekend when we come to visit...Can't wait!! Yum Yum!

Next time I would omit the salt.  I found it a little salty due to the bouillon cubes.  I'd like to even possibly put less bouillon in it in order to cut down on the salt

Recipe is very easy to follow -
however, it's not clear as to whether
you should reconstitute the cream of 
mushroom soup.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I followed other's suggestion to add 1 c of beef stock (1 beef bouillon dissolved in water) for additional liquid because it turns into this great gravy.  I cooked it for 9 hours on low and definitely suggest the longer cooking time - it comes out super tender!  I also sliced up the meat at the 7 hour mark and just let it stew in the sauce, which I also highly recommend.  Great recipe if you're in the mood for some comfort food!

Have made it twice using a 2 lb. or larger roast and adding 1/2 C. Red Wine to deglaze the pan.  Also added 1 Tblsp. Worcestershire, 8 oz. sliced Mushrooms and 1 C. Beef Broth before putting the roast in the slow cooker.  My husband loves this recipe and would eat it every week.  Downpat

Very tasty! My adjustments: I coated the meat in flour and seasonings and seared it in fresh garlic and onion. I added a can of cream of celery ( we like a lot of gravy!) and used beef broth. I added a tbsp of Worcestershire as well. I cooked the vegetables in the pot just to cut down on the prep work, they turned out great as well. I used a beef shoulder roast, and while it was tasty, it wasn't falling apart like I really wanted, though it was still easily cut with a steak knife.. I don't feel this is due to anything relating to this recipe though, I think it was just a tough piece of meat- I plan on making it again with the same cut of meat, and I plan on adding several more hours in the pot ( a couple on high) to see if that does the trick .

Very easy and good. The roast turned out so tender, it almost just fell apart. I followed some of the suggestions: added a can of french onion soup, dredged the meat in flour and sauteed the meat for only 2 minutes per side and added a little Worcestershire sauce and extra seasoning. It's mild tasting, so be sure to add a little extra seasoning if you like things with a little more taste.

Great recipe!  I used suggestions from others and: dredged meat in flour before browning, used 1 pound of baby carrots, replaced cream soup with 1 can beef broth & 3T Worcestershire, and added 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning Mix.  Excellent!  Served at big family dinner with roasted potatoes and two recipes from this site:  Yum Yum Green Beans and Amish Slaw.  Rave reviews from all...and so easy.  Thank you, Erica!!

I read the reviews and tweaked it. I only had a 1.5 lb boneless blade roast. Inserted sliced garlic into meat, seared for 2 minutes on each side only. Searing keeps the juices in the meat, so no need to overcook. Then salt, pepper. Put atop veggies in crockpot, same veggies as recipe, but added a turnip, and small red potatoes. Topped with Worscestershire all over meat (maybe 10-12 drops) mushroom soup, splash of red wine. Kept in crocktop for 7 hours on low, but could have stayed there for another 2 hours for even more tender meat. The sauce was amazing, great for dipping soft bread.

I used a mixture of this recipe and another one and it turned out great. I had 4 lbs of chuck roast. Didn't have condensed soup so it was 14 oz of regular cream of mushroom. Put in one cup of beef broth, a package of onion soup mix and one cup of 7up. Omitted parsley, less carrots, more garlic. Browned meat before putting it into crockpot. Resulted in a juicy, tender, roast. I think I'll continue to play with this recipe. Next time I won't put in the beef broth but will add red wine and worcestershire sauce. It's a good recipe. You won't be disappointed!

Home run at my house.  Seasoned the flour with salt, season salt, plenty of ground black pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning blend before browning the roast.  Added 1/2 package of onion soup mix to the top of roast after placing mushroom soup on top. Added a little water and a couple of splashes of red wine. Also, included two bay leaves in crock pot.  Excellent.  Made my BF very happy. :-)

This is my first review, I had to rate this recipe because it is so good. I didn't use onions or carrots because my husband hates them, but this came out so good it didn't matter. Served it with mash potatoes and the gravy was to die for! Thanks

Very Very Easy to make.  I had some relatives in town and decided on this wonderful dish.  I used about 1/4 cup of Balsamic Vinegar also.  It definately made a delicious gravy.  I will do this again and again and again!!

This roast was the most delicious roast I have ever made!  I used the carrots the second time I made it, but not the first, and I prefer it without carrots.  The carrots seems to make it sweeter.  But other than that, it was a hit!!  I didn't even need to use a knife, it was so tender!  The more garlic, the better!  Try putting extra, fresh mushrooms in too!  Makes great gravy!

This recipe turned out terrible.  But my family endured it.  The meat was done before 2 1/2 hours.  It did not make its own sauce.  My vegetables burnt. The worst thing ever that you could have named happened to this recipe.

This is a keeper. Like every recipe I always look at it, read the comments adjusting accordingly and then I'll add my own spin to it. I rarely follow a recipe to the letter unless I’m baking cookies or a cake. This always turns out Awesome. I'll put the veggies on the bottom like it says adding peppers, onion and garlic, sear the meat then make about three slits on the top where I will push in slices of onion, red, and green pepper, add Worcestershire sauce and the cream soup. Pour beef broth over that adding spices like basil, oregano etc. in with it. Put the lid on and let it cook.

Wonderful Recipe! 

I made this roast for Christmas Day instead of the traditional turkey. I roast my 4lb roast for 28 minutes on 500 after seasoning it with kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper and rubbed with fresh garlic. What a WOW factor it brought to our dinner table and taste buds!!

Delicious!  Best slow cooker beef pot roast. I used a 3 lbs blade roast and followed the same cooking times.  I didn't have any parsley, but I added gourmet dried mushrooms about 2 hours into cooking (followed instructions on package).  I used Keg steak seasoning instead of the salt and pepper. Used 1 can of Campbell's cream of mushroom and garlic soup, double the mini-carrots and 2 stalks of celery on the bottom along with the onion and garlic. I took the advice of others and added a little worchestershire sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Very good. I added about a cup of beef broth (low salt), and a few shakes of Worcestershire. Otherwise stayed with the recipe exactly, and used the leftovers over fettucine for a type of "stroganoff" the next night.

This came out amazing! Ready at dinnertime, made the house smell amazing, super easy. My hubby doesn't like the texture of onions, so I use dehydrated onions. SO GOOD! Thanks for the great recipe.

Made exactly per recipe. My slow cooker cooks hot - you may have to adjust cooking times. Very good!! Meat (beef roast) isn'y a pot roast so meat will be tender but not tender like a pot roast.

Delicious--the meat just fell apart. I did add more carrots and potatoes than called for since we like more. I also used the whole package of onion soup since I wasn't sure I'd use the other half. Gave it lots of extra good flavor. A definite improvement.

There was something severely lacking in this recipe.
Although my boyfriend wanted to eat the entire 2.5 pounds after 10 hours had gone by, I was still left a little unimpressed.

I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 4, 2 tablespoons of worcestershire, potatoes, onions, and carrots. I also added parsley and cream of garlic mushroom soup. I rubbed 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper each on each side of roast. I also threw in 2 tablespoons of butter (not like that would do too much to flavor the entire roast, but it really needed SOMETHING)

Why did it taste so bland?

I make this even easier by NOT browning the beef roast, mixing one can each of French Onion and Cream of Mushroom soup together and pouring over the roast in the slow cooker.  Cook on low for 6-7 hours - you can add your favorite vegies.  I bake Yukon and sweet potatoes 1-1 ratio and mix together and use the gravy from the roast - unbelievably easy and delicious!

Love it- I always come back to this one after trying others.

This is your traditional roast recipe. It reminds me of when I was a kid.

Great easy recipe- easily tweaked to various tastes as well.

Thanks!

This is good, but with the changes that I have made, it is really not an honest rating. Browning it for a few minutes is enough. The beef was well browned. It is not necessarily one of our favorites although it was very tender.
My family just prefers the usual slow cooker roast I make.
Like others suggested, I added beef broth and worcestershire sauce.  I also added a little more garlic and dash for more taste.
I do, however, thank you for posting this recipe.

I would recommend doubling the soup and adding 1/2 cup of water.  Also use low sodium soup or this can get very salty when it reduces in the slow cooker.

This was the very best roast recipe I have ever tried!!  The roast was so tender and tasty, and the gravy was delicious!  My husband insists that I make this again.  It was so good we couldn't bear to give even a scrap to our dog.  She's pouting!

I used cream of celery soup (it's what I had on hand) and omitted the parsley because we didn't have any. Still, this recipe was a winner. The meat just fell apart, and the gravy was delicious.

Great recipe!  Even better with a few splashes of worcestire before cooking.  I didn't saute the meat before putting it in the cooker and it still turned out tasty.

I have made this roast a few times, as is, plus as the suggestions, I totally think it depends on the meat you get. Quite bland, and I did all kinds of spices. My ribs and roast came from alberetsons on sale. Wonder if the meat is old because all the roasts and ribs have been terrible!!

This was the best roast I have made. I used a 3 lb. arm roast browned in a skillet then laid over a bed of diced onions and garlic that were soaking in 2.5 cups of beef broth. I made slits in the beef to insert garlic cloves, covered with roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup (yes, we love garlic) and cooked it on low for 7 hours. It was sooo tender and delicious. I did have to add some flour to make the gravy, probably due to the extra broth but it was delicious! Instead of adding carrots or potatoes I made a dutch potato recipe (found on this site) which is basically mashed potatoes with carrots. All of it was a hit with even my picky eaters!

Excellent! I made some minor adjustments, but this is a solid recipe. Pure comfort food. I added quartered red potatoes to the slow cooker, seasoned the roast with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper before searing, threw in more carrots, and I added about a cup of beef broth (whisked that and the soup together before pouring over the roast). The roast was perfectly cooked and everything was delicious. Thank you for the great recipe! :)

This was good, however it seemed pretty salty to me.  I used a 3 pound bottom round roast, and the meat turned out find aside from the salt.  i also used beef stock in place of water for more flavor, perhaps that is where the salty flavor came from.  Other than that, it was pretty good!  and easy in the slow cooker!

Followed Working Mom Gourmet and others suggestions about adding worceshire sauce and using celery soup to the roast; added potatoes and veggies.  Perfect dinner for a long day and a cold fall evening in Virginia.  Would make again! Thank you!

I made this recipe this past weekend and I'm truly up in the air about it.  I thought the vegetables tasted amazing however, I wasn't impressed with the meat.  The top of the roast was pretty dry but the bottom of the roast that had been cooking in the liquid all day was tender.  My husband enjoyed it, but I  still need to tinker with it a bit more to make it a dynamite recipe.

The meat had no flavor and was quite dry.
I had to thicken the tasteless liquid it was cooking in with a little cornstarch, add some more seasonings such as, onion and garlic powders more salt and pepper then turning it into a creamy gravy.
 I had also added whole mushrooms in the beginning. All was well when gravy was put on the meat and veggies.

My husband, Glen isn't much on cooking, but he surprised me with this one. It was great. He did add cubed potates, but we both thought it would be great with mashed potates. This is a keeper!

I haven't made this recipe, but it reminds me of the roasts my mom made years ago.  The only difference is it was incased in foil and baked in the oven.  She added small onions and she sprinkled an envelope of onion soup over the roast before sealing the foil.

This was excellent and juicy.  I didn't have parsley and don't generally cook with it anyway, so I used fresh rosemary and thyme instead.  Otherwise, this recipe was made as stated, with one more addition -- 1/2 package of onion soup mix.  Delicious!

This makes a great roast! My first time doing a slow cooker roast and it was indeed very tender. I think 7 hours would have been just about right, but we cooked it for 8. I added more herbs, like marjoram, bay leaves and Montreal Steak seasoning. The only reason this isn't a 5 star recipe is that my husband thought the mushroom soup flavor sort of took away from the beef, so he doesn't really want to do it again. I, however, loved it!

This was good, but I increased the carrots and it was too much. :-(  I also added celery & doubled the garlic & added just a bit of red wine & some other spices.  Next time, I'll use 2 cans of soup, for more gravy.

Really good with a few changes.  I season the roast with salt, pepper and Montreal Steak seasoning before browning, not after.  I also use Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup.

I didn't have the soup, so I just made a thick white sauce with butter, milk, and flour, which I then spiced with the parsley plus -- based on other reviews -- balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and my favorite seasoning mix.  I may have added a bit too much Worcestershire, but overall, the result was fantastic.  I also used potatoes instead of carrots (again, just what I had).  The gravy/sauce from this was just fabulous.  I served it with a loaf of crusty bread for dipping, and that was my favorite part!  So I think it is all a matter of what spices/flavors you like, and being sure to include those to make this recipe a bit better.

I love the gravy with this. I did change it a bit. I didn't put the carrots in and I diced the onion, and only used 2 cloves of garlic. I also added in Italian seasoning and some worcester sauce. The meat was really tender. Thanks.

I tried this for a change from the regular recipe that I use. It was ok, if a bit bland. We ate it, so it wasn't a failure, but I don't think I'll use this recipe again. I'm always looking for oohs and aahs, this needs majors adjustments for that to happen.

I have made this twice, both times using a larger cut of meat and added about a half cup of red wine.  I have also lowered the cooking time to about 7 hrs.  The carrots are yummy!  Not mushy.  The gravy is good too!  A must try for anyone "afraid" to cook a roast.

I added three big sweet potatoes, cut into biggish chunks. And one can didn't look like enough mushroom soup, so I took half of a powdered mushroom soup package, added some milk to it, and poured it over. It was really good, even the kids loved it.

This was a really great way to prepare a beef roast.  Thanks Erica for this submission.  I put this on a Saturday when we were in and out for a soccer tournment and when we were done this was just the perfect mean.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  I enjoyed the fast that it was easy and in the slow cooker so I can do other things while this cooked and it did not heat up the house like the oven would have.  Big thumbs up.  I would have added photos of my mean but before I could think to and get the camera it was all gone.

This was good, but not my favorite. I think I'll stick with my family favorite using french onion soup.

Awesome!  I didn't have carrots so instead used potatoes, they turned out great.  The meat was melt in your mouth delicious.

My husband loved this, especially the next day.  I did add potatoes, celery and extra carrots along with beef broth as suggested.  Kids seemed to like it as well.  Very easy to make which is a bonus.   I don't eat meat so can't add to their feedback.

I have tossed my other slow cooked roast recipe and will make this one from now on! The family loved it. The house smelled amazing when we walked through the door.  I added some quartered potatoes to the recipe, but that was the only change. Delicious!

This was excellent! The only thing different that I did was added potatoes instead of carrots, and I added 1 can of beef broth. I cooked it on low for 8 hours. It was soooooo tender and fell off the fork - exactly how I like it!

I'm giving this 3 stars as a "base" recipe, but as written, I think the result would be too bland for my taste. As recommended by others, I added a bay leaf, 1.5 Tbsp worcestershire, and a dash of red wine to the gravy mixture. I also added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup and quite a lot of beef broth to cover the meat. I added quartered mushrooms toward to the gravy toward the end of cooking, but elected to cook carrots and mashed potatoes separately. I cooked a 2 3/4 lb roast for about 7.5 hours on low and it was just a little dry. I might make this again with changes, but it doesn't go in the "favorite" meal category.

Really easy and tasted great, but could have used a little more flavor. I added in the worcestershire and sauteed garlic but will do a little more next time.

Made this for my husband and his father and uncle. Both men have home cooked meals on a limited basis so they are not hard to please. However, this recipe was magnificent and will be the only way I slow cook a roast from now on.

My husband really loved it--used to cook pot roast with tomato-based soup, but he likes this. Today will try adding the Worcestershire sauce as suggested by others. Will try the "stroganoff" suggestion next week. Thanks y'all.

The vegetables in the sauce turned out absolutely delicious! The meat however turned out very dry. I layered exactly as was directed. Probably won't be making this again.

Working a full time job and coming home to feed a family of six isn't easy.  I prepped this meal the night before, turned it on before I left for work and when I came home it was done!  With sides!  It was juicy and flavorful.

Pretty good!  I actually liked the garlic flavor!  I used mushroom with garlic soup and added a can of beef broth.  I didn't have potatoes, so it was just carrots and onions and garlic.  I also added 2 tablespoons of Worstershire sauce.  Awesome over egg noodles!

I have to rate this recipe a 5 star for several reasons but the most important one is that it is delicious and very easy to prepare. I did change it up a bit though but not that much. I hope this is helpful and it's sure worth a try. The first thing i did was give the meat a good dry rub (garlic, salt,pepper) added a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of dry white wine, a couple of shakes of worcestershire sauce, then added 1 can of campbells french onion soup and 2 cans of cream of mushroom as well. let it cook on low 8 hours and you wouldn't believe how good this was.Try this and i hope you all enjoy!!!

This is a very good recipe, simple and delicious.  My husband loved and I will definitely make this again.  I took the advice of others and added worcestershire sauce and I think it added to the flavor as well.  My roast was so tender that it fell apart when I removed it from the crock pot.  I also added potatoes to it when I served it.

I put this together before heading out the door to church, and we came home to a geat meal!!  Smelled fantastic walking
through the door!  I did use two cans of 
cream of mushroom soup for extra gravy, made with mashed potatoes, and green beans.  Great meal.  My "boys" enjoyed it. (and so did I).  Thanks!

This is a decent recipe...nothing earth shattering, but nonetheless, a good way to spruce up a plain old roast.  I seasoned my roast and added mushrooms and worcestershire sauce at the suggestion of others.

I thought this was quick and easy but it lacked some flavor. It needs to be doctored with some herbs/spices to give it some kick.

Loved it.  I will never make pot roast any other way again.  I added about half a pound of quartered fresh mushrooms and another half pound of trimmed green beans.  Fabulous! Even my picky little girl ate it.

Loved this Roast. I did add mushrooms, carrots, and celery. Afterwards, Even Made the gravy a little thicker with corn starch for my mashed potatos. It cooked for 6 hours on a high setting. Excellent tenderness. Would recommend all to try !!!!!!!

My family really liked this recipe, even my very picky young son.  We added a bit of flavor to this recipe by adding in some BBQ spices while cooking, otherwise it was a little bland.  Still, a fantastic recipe because you can add the right amount of flavor to suit your family.

I have to admit I was a bit surprised at how tender this roast turned out - and how tasty it was!  I usually like to cook my beef roasts on top the stove, but for the convenience, a slo-cooker comes in really handy.  This will truly be my favorite slo-cooker beef roast recipe from now on.  It is awesome!

This recipe came out great just as it is.  The meat came out so tender and it produced a lot of gravy which was great with the mashed potatoes we had on the side.  Will definitely make again.

Mmmmmm!  Very good!  I subbed milk for half half and I used 2 tbs if coffee creamer to make it creamier. I also subbed a tsp rice vinegar for the sherry. I also used red onions. I puréed the mixture a little too much but was still very good. The flavors balanced very well!

Awesome! My husband LOVED it! I followed the  recipe except I sprinkled Worcestershire sauce after I poured the cream of mushroom soup over the roast. I used a 2lb rib roast and it took 7 hours to cook. I made mashed potatoes which were delicious with the gravy. The gravy was even better the next day! My husband practically kicked the plate which is saying a lot because he is not a huge fan of leftovers!

Great recipe! I added about 3/4 cup of water as I was afraid that it would be too salty. Definitely not too salty. The gravy was a bit thin so I will cut back the water to 1/2 cup. The gravy was very tasty over noodles.

I did the recipe as stated except I used dried parsley. I was disapointed. It was good but not great and certainly not really moist. My husband felt that the gravy had a strange taste and didn't like it at all.

Delicious! finally the perfect pot roast! The only alteration I made was to add more seasoning to the meat and veggies ( steak seasoning ), since my tastes are more on the spicy side.. other than that it works great!

Thanks for this great recipe!  I had to change a couple of little things since I didn't have all the ingredients but overall it was perfect because the meat turned out very tender.  :)

This was ok, but I should have stuck with my orignal plan and roasted in the oven. I stuck to the recipe pretty much, but I think it definitely needs something else for additional flavor.

This is a really easy recipe and my family loves it!  I've had it in my rotation for awhile and it's always a treat when we have it.  Just throw it all the pot and it's ready at dinnertime.  I tend to be rather liberal with the garlic.  ;)  Thank you for sharing this!

I followed the basic recipe but added a few things of my own. I put carotts and  mushrooms on the bottom, onion soup mix on top of the roast and added 3/4 cup of water and tbsp. of worstershire sauce.  Cooked for 8 hrs on low and served with mashed potatoes. Very tender and the sauce was excellent.

Would certianly do this again. I did add 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce to 2 pounds of meat. I also cut up some potatoes and added them with two hours left to cook. I think next time I would add them sooner because they were still a little hard.

I gave four stars because I tweaked it.  I cut slits into the roast and put the garlic in the slits before browning.  I cooked it for nine hours so I added more liquid, I did a 1/4c of beef broth on the bottom of the slowcooker and then deglazed the browning pan with a 1/4 of beef broth and poured it on top of the roast.  I also added a bay leaf and worchestershire.  I might add cumin next time for a smokey flavor or possibly hot sauce.  It was sooo good though.  The soup definitely makes a difference and creates a great gravy!  Thanks!

Excellent. I had a big roast so I didn't put in any veggies with it except for a large quartered onion. After it was done cooking, I removed the meat, drained the juices and onion into my blender and pureed it. Poured the juices into a pot added a little shooken up flour with water to thicken it into a gravy. Fabulous! This is how I will be cooking a slow cooker roast from here on. Thank you!

Quite good.  Did everything as per recipe except I thickened the sauce/gravyright before serving by adding some cornstarch mixed with water.  My husband loved it!  I used 2 smallish beef arm roasts.

My husband and I loved this. We ate just about the whole roast (very little left overs). I used beef mushroom soup as some suggested, also a can of beef broth and cream of mushroom soup. Potatoes, celery, carrots, onion and garlic all went in the bottom with the chuck roast on top. I cooked it for 9-10 hrs and it fell apart as I took it out to cut.I added a little corn starch towards the end to thicken the gravy. A whole meal in one pot. Great for a quick meal or on a hot day. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe as written except for using garlic mushroom soup as that was what I had on hand.  Came out wonderful!  Meat was tender, moist and tasty.  Will make again for sure.

Not great, but pretty good.  The best thing about it obviously is the fact that within 15 minutes, everything is in the cooker.  I used a chuck roast and served it with Alton Brown's baked brown rice recipe.  The leftover gravy really pulled it all together.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it turned out pretty good.  While the beef was so tender, it fell apart during slicing, I think I expected to have more flavor.  I added a package of onion soup mix, per other reviews and some bite-sized yukon gold potatoes.  I seasoned the beef before browning, but it still tasted a little plain.  Next time, I may marinate it and pierce it first.  The gravy was delicious!

This is a great recipe! All I did differently was add a bit more cream of mushroom soup (for extra gravy) and skip the parsley and it was SO good. I was skeptical since it seemed too simple and I thought it might be bland, but not at all! I was weirded out by the can of soup at first too, thinking that maybe I should add water, but the recipe was right - nothing else needed! I got some multigrain bread to put on the side and it was a big hit. It's going to be my new favorite Fall meal.

We weren't impressed with this recipe.  My meat came out on the dry side, though I cooked it as written.  The carrots/onions were very tasty.  Probably wouldn't make again.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few changes. I used the Golden Mushroom Soup. I added more garlic, fresh ground pepper and some red cooking wine to the soup. Otherwise I followed it as posted. He said it was very tender and tasty. I am a vegetarian, so I can't vouch for it myself, but he loved it.

This was good, but somewhat bland, even though I added worcestershire sauce as others suggested and extra garlic. Could have used some spices or herbs (in addition to the parsely). Very easy to make.

I don't usually brown meat for my crock pot, but I did with this.  I was out of onion, so I added a small amount of dried minced onion.
It was absolutely delicious!!

The garlic in this was overwhelming.  Four cloves of garlic was way too much for a 2 pound roast, at least for us.  Will go back to making my usual pot roast.  Thanks anyway.

I have never had much luck cooking meat, so I purchased a slow cooker hoping to have better results.  I went online to find a good recipe and found this...well..my husband was quite impressed after 12 years of "trying to cook meat" and my children wanted more and more...WONDERFUL RECIPE..the sauce was so yummy and the meat so tender..Thank you!

This was very tasty, added 1 tbsp worchestershire and 1 heaping tsp. Beef better than bouillon, baked on low setting for 8 hours, then thickened the sauce with 1 tbsp cornstarchand water.  Next time will try and make stroganoff with it, adding cream cheese and sour cream.

I added approx 12 oz of beef broth and Better Than 
Bouillon.  That greatly improved the texture making  it moist.  Also GREATLY improved the flavor.  I suggest wrapping potatoes and carrots (wrap carrots in bacon and glaze with maple syrup) in the oven. Otherwise everything tastes the same.

I don't care for Cream of Mushroom soup so I used Cream of Chicken. I used a package of Lipton onion soup base. It turned out very well.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  Yes, the meat came out very tender, but it didn't have much taste.  Bland, definitely bland.

I substituted 12 oz of low-sodium beef broth in place of the cream soup and added a tsp of Italian herb seasoning. I used a blade roast and slow-cooked it on high for 2 hrs, then on low for 4 hrs, and it came out very moist and tender. Before serving, I removed the liquid and made a gravy using cornstarch and water, cooking for about 5 min until reduced.

I didn't sear the roast first and it turned out beautifully.  Tender and moist with lots of flavour.  Just added a little flour to the gravy at the end to thicken it.  Family loved it.

Came out pretty good!
Didn't have all the original recipe ingredients  and was tight on cash so made some adjustments along with recommendations from reviews...

I used a 2lb shoulder roast:
·1 white onion
·1/2 pack baby carrots
·4 celery
·1 can Campbell's Garlic Cream of Mushroom
·1 1/2 can beef broth
·1 tbs Worcestershire sauce

Chopped up veggies and placed in crockpot. Browned the roast both sides (salt & pepper), warmed up the condensed soup and broth on stove.
Placed roast in crockpot on top veggies and poured soup/broth mixture on top...turned on crockpot.

It was good, I put it in the crockpot on high for 5 hours. I also added a can of beef broth and a couple splashes of worteshire sauce. It was VERY liquidy, I think the liquid tripled. Everyone liked it though! Next time I might strain then thicken it for gravy.

Really delicious. I used 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup with 8 oz of beef broth and 2 tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce. Added parsnips and celery to the veggies. A 2.5 pound beef shoulder steak was very tender and flavorful after about 7 hours on low. I also just smashed the garlic cloves instead of mincing them.

Basic recipe all on its own is perfect as it is above. There have been times where I made my own cream of mushroom soup(this is what i typically do) or used the low sodium version Campbells makes and it tastes great. I never really like my mom's recipe using the onion soup packet but wanted something just as simple when I was short on time. This is now my go to slow cooker pot roast recipe. I have made it at least 10 times and always get compliments from my husband, friends, family and even a picky 5 year old!

This was delicious and SO easy. I had to improvise a little but mainly followed the recipe as is. Searing before putting in the crockpot gave it good flavor, kept it moist & kept it from falling apart, don't skip this step. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic salt, I used a can of golden mushroom soup & added quartered red potatoes for the last hour. It was fantastic, my 2 year old & 10 month old devoured it. I can't wait 2 make this for my hubby, I think I will add some mushrooms. Thanks for sharing

We really enjoyed this with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I made this using Campbell's Golden Mushroom and au Jus gravy.   Instead  of the cream of chicken, and water.  I used only 1/2 package of onion soup mix and added Worcestershire sauce   Delicious.

Just like mom's.  I added a package of dry onion soup and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup so that I would have gravy for another meal that I will make the next day.  It reminds me of my mom's, she did not use a slow cooker but the taste is as close to 99 is to 100 and the house smells amazing. I will never bother with the oven for this dish again. So easy, served with rice and the gravy was delicious.  Thank you Erica I am new to cooking and I typically avoid beef because I can't seem to get it right but this was excellent!

I have made a similar version for 20 + years.
One can of cream of mushroom soup with 1 can of 
french onion soup - along with potatoes, carrots, 
garlic, celery. I do brown the roast prior to cooking. I usually put the roast in the oven (with lid) rather than cook it in a slow cooker but either way is great!

there wasn't much flavor in this. I didn't sear the roast before I placed it in the crock pot, but it still came out nice and tender.  I had to add a splash of worsteshire sauce and a splach of soy sauce and that made the flavor so much better. easy recipe, but not the best.

The meat was cooked perfect but this recipe had no flavor... my family made fun of it all through dinner and then after... sorry but not a keeper for us!

The meat was dry and the gravy was bland.  My family will insist I never ever make this again.

I followed the recipe except for adding a cup of beef broth and some extra vegetables (mushrooms and potatoes).  I thought it was okay though I think I'll try a different roast recipe in the future.

I found this not such a great recipe; least in this family.... At the 5 hour point, roast was OVER done; it says you can use "any" roast, but this one was very tough; which is an unusual thing in slow cooking roasts...... It was NOT an inexpensive cut either. "gravy" was too thick; and too much still like the soup -my family prefers "real" gravies. And since meat was more than done, I shut it off; even using the "petite" baby carrots, and cutting the onion much smaller, it wasn't cooked through - they were less than tender crisp, even. I would not try this again.

Very good. I do not like carrots or onions so I used quartered redskin potatoes instead. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Turned out great.

Loved this!  I did make the following changes, based upon the suggestions of other reviewers: I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and added a can of beef broth, and a few halved Yukon Gold potatoes.  I also used a packet of Lipton onion soup instead of a fresh onion.  The gravy was rich and savory, and it made terrific leftovers, too!

We really liked this roast. We added extra flavour to the dry rub (garlic, paprika, italian seasoning) and a cup of beef stock to the slow cooker. Lots of flavour, made a gravy out of the left over juices, it was yummy!

This was a really easy and good recipe to use.  I did omit the carrots and added a little balsamic viniger and a sprinkle of worchestire to the mix for extra flavor and a couple bay leaves.  I also use 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of beefy mushroom soup.  I will do this again so yummy.

This is good!  We let it cook for 9 hours and the end result was great.  The meat was ok - we used london broil and it never really got tender.  BUT the star of the show was the carrots.  We all fought over who would get the last carrot!  The gravy was yummy and plentiful.  We'll be making this one again!

Delicious.  My family loves spices, so I doubled the garlic.  The gravy was thin, but had a wonderful flavor.  I will most assuredly make this recipe again.
