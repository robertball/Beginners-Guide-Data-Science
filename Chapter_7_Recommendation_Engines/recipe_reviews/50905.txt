This wings are the bomb!  I made them for the first two weeks of football and will make them again soon.  I didn't have enough wings the first week so I put the left over sauce in the fridge' 'till the following Sunday, they were even better with the week old sauce.  I think this week I will cook up the sauce a week in advance, on the stove.

GREAT!!! Fantastic recipe, If you don't like it to spicy hot, lay low on the red pepper. Very easy to cook. I used an indoor grill, so the hickory taste was missing, but everyone enjoyed the wings and licked their fingers clean. Have Fun Cooking!
PS A great alternative to fried wings.

Not as spicey as I was lead to believe they would turn out. The sauce had a good consistancy, but it didn't look too appetizing at the end.

Tasted really good - not as hot or spicy as I would have liked it to be.

All my football buddies love them! We cheated and used a gas grill, but next time we'll use charcoal and hickory chips. I froze the leftover sauce to use again.
