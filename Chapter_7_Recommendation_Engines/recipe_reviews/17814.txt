A good, quick recipe--even the kids liked it (and I've since given it to a few friends who enjoyed it).  I did, however, make a change: I used Jiffy cornbread mix over the top to make it a truly easy meal.  A keeper for use after a long day!

For a quick, easy "pantry meal," I thought this was great.  Gourmet?  Of course not; but quick, tasty & satisfying.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add garlic & more Worschstershire, which I would not recommend -- overpowered the sweetness of the creamed corn, which I think is really meant to complement the cornbread topping.

This dish was alright, but I can't say that I'd make it again. The combination just wasn't quite right to me and it seemed a little on the dry side.

Good stuff.  I used edamame instead of lima beans, tripled the worcestershire, doubled the onions, and added garlic

We liked this recipe but probably won't make it too often.
