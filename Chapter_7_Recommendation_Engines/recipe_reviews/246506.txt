Simple and perfect for an easy breakfast or any time of day treat. I was tempted to cook my eggs on the stove but went ahead and did them in the microwave and they turned out just fine.

I made this for lunch. I used white cheddar for the cheese. It was a good combination of flavors. I'll make again!
