This is a great drink!  I love grapefruits with salt on them (everyone laughs at me), so this drink is perfect for me.  I do cut back on the salt a bit, though...1/4 tsp. is a bit much.  Anyway, thanks!  (By the way, I hope I don't mess up the rating by giving it one star on the kid rating--they're not supposed to like it cuz their not supposed to try it!  LOL)

A good brunch drink. I was originally introduced to it as an alternative to the Bloody Mary. One thing though, the way I'm used to preparing it is with a the rim of the glass covered in coarse salt, a la a margarita and a cocktail straw. It lets the person drinking it control the amount of salt, in case they just want the fruit juice and liqour.

A salty dog has been a favorite. The way I have always had it was with vodka, and instead of putting the salt in the drink, you moisten the rim of the glass and dip it in salt. Refreshing!

I give this drink the full 5 stars plus!! My husband introduced me to this drink. I couldn't even taste the vodka, which came back to kick me in the butt. LOL.. I don't even like grapefruits, but this drink is awesome. I just have to take it a little slower from now on.

Simple yet so delicious. I had never had a salty dog with vodka. I used freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and I didn't measure the salt, just added enough to taste. I can't even taste the alcohol, dangerous.

Good, but I've been drinking salty dogs for a long time, and the salt needs to be on the rim of the glass...imo : )

Really good! I was kind of skeptical of the salt but it really compliments everything well. And others are right, you can't taste the vodka. Dangerous!

Move over Screwdriver; there's  a new sheriff in town.  Salty Dogs are a must have Sunday brunch cocktail. Sour , salty, and packs a punch. I  like to rim my glass with  kosher salt for the perfect salt-to-cocktail ratio.

This is delicious! I made a Bloody Mary first and then this to compare which I liked better- this one wins and I love Bloody Mary's....I made it with Ruby Red grapefruit juice so it is a bit sweeter than a white grapefruit juice would be- very refreshing on a hot summer day!

this came out pretty good.. i can see how this could sneak up on a person bc you really can't taste the vodka.. i'm glad i read the reviews and chose to salt (margarita salt) my rim instead of putting the salt into the drink directly.. it's always fun to try something new.. ty for the recipe

Yum.  This is my new summer cocktail.  Very refreshing!  I used ruby red grapefruit juice, added a splash of lime and agave and I salted the rim of my glass.  Drinking one right now!  Amazing.
