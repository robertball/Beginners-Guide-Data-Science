I'd give these more stars if I could!  I did the following to help ensure they turned out great:  used a slicer to get a consistently thin chip, lined my pans with foil, used someone else's suggestion to melt the butter in a bag and shake the slices to easily coat them and then with the oven at 400, I made sure to flip them all over after 10 minutes and carefully watched them for those last 10 minutes, pulling out some of the browner ones as needed.  When they came out of the oven, they crisped up so nicely as they continued to bake a little on the pans.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!

The trick is to cut them extremely thin like a potato chip. I also decreased my oven to 375 degrees.

These were really really good. I just used spray butter instead of melted. This is one of the best and easiest sweet potato recipes.

Yummy side dish, we all enjoyed. 4 stars for calling them "chips" when they really don't get crispy like chips. That being said, they had a great flavor and I will certainly make them again! NOTE: melt butter in a bowl, mix in sugar, salt & cinnamon - then toss the potato slices in the bowl, mixing well. ALSO, bake at 375 to keep them from burning...

Had some leftover uncooked sweet potatoes and wanted to try something new with them. Sliced them extra thin as other reviewers have suggested-- worked great! I would just make sure they're all evenly thin.

I didn't brush on the toppings, just sprinkled them over the top, and that worked fine.

So easy to make and smelled tantalicious while baking! Highly recommended:)

Eh- I'd say it's just ok. Chips ahd great flavor, but were soggy and quite  few burned before the other ones even began to crisp. 
Changes of note: instead of brushing the chips with the mixture, I put them all in a large Ziploc and shook 'em to save time (so very much easier). 
Next time I think I will put them on a broiler pan to help them crisp without burning. 
Suggestions?

Great healthy alternative to regular chips or good as a vegetable side with your summer BBQ's. Cut slices thinly and as uniform in size as possible for best results. I melted the butter in a bowl mixed in the topping ingredients and stirred in the potato slices instead of brushing it on.

Amazing! These were easy to make and healthier than regular potato chips. As stated before, the thinner you slice them, the better. I will definently be making these again!

I sliced these very thin and baked them at 350 as another reviewer suggested.  I set the timer for 20 minutes, and at just 15 they were all burned and had to be tossed!

We have been working to make the perfect sweet potato chips. Prior to getting a mandolin, we hand cut them, put them in a zip lock bag along with some olive oil and ground cinnamon, shook them up and baked at 375 for 35 minutes or so. We put a half apple on each end of the cookie sheet and as it baked, its juices helped sweeten the chips. 
Now with the mandolin we are trying to get the time and temp right. We don't mind the burnt ones, they are delicious.
After baking, I turn off the oven and leave them in there to crisp up. Wonderful!
If you cut the potatoes thicker, and using the method above, we ended up with "cookies", moist and chewy.
Good for the grandkids.

I thought these were fabulous!  I brushed on the butter mixture, but only baked for about 15 minutes.  They weren't completely uniform so a few were crunchy while others were chewy, but that wasn't a bad thing for me.  I liked the variety.  Will definitely make again.

I'm always looking for something different, and this is it! To lower fat and calories, I decided to omit the melted butter and spray the potatoes with butter cooking spray instead before sprinkling on the mixture of salt, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Because I needed so many pans at once, I used convection bake at 375 degrees. I used parchment paper on two of my pans and ran out, so I just sprayed the rest of the pans with cooking spray and laid the potatoes on the pan. Surprisingly, I discovered that the parchment paper did not produce a crispy chip, but the "naked" pans did. Nice discovery for next time! You do have to watch these very carefully to keep them from burning. I ran out of the cinnamon sugar mix and just salted the last few. Still very good.

First time trying these chips and while they are a little tedious to make they are soooo worth it! My Kitchen Aid Slicer Attachment did not slice these as thinly as they need to be. Instead, I used a Boerner v-slicer - thin slice - placed slices in bowl and poured canola oil, salt and small amount of cinnamon and tossed making sure each piece had oil on it.  Placed on a foil-lined baking pan and baked for about 12 minutes turned over and baked  about 12 more minutes.  The secret of these is to have them sliced thinly, arrange them on pan in a single layer, with none overlapping and watching them carefully. These get crispier as they cool. Thanks Chunker - loved your recipe!

Thanks for all your suggestions. It ended up working out super well with a few minor adjustments.

Some additional steps I ended up using include...
• Flipping them every 10 min at 350 (Depends on your oven some ovens heat more evenly then others)
• Soaking them for a few min, drying and then transferring them to the baking sheet. - This step seamed to help them cook more evenly.

This recipe was easy & tasty enough, but I can't give it more than 3 stars because the chips never got crispy.  I even used a food processor to slice them evenly, baked, then broiled them.

Found we prefer the same seasoning we like on baked sweet potatoes....Hot Hungarian Paprika with a little sea salt.  Used veggie peeler to get thin cuts then rubbed with olive oil instead of butter and sprinkled with spice.  There is about a 30 second window from perfect to burned and totally depends on how thin you get them cut, so you do really have to watch these.

These turned out okay.  I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes which worked out great.  I tried a lower oven temp (375) to prevent burning.  Some still burned, some were crispy, and some where soft.  Next time, I will try another baking method.  There's got to be another way to perfect them!

I made these today and while they had a good flavor, I wasn't crazy about the texture.... I would like them crisper.  It was a lot of work slicing the potatoes, then putting them individually on cookie sheet, then turning them over, etc.... next time I may try the recipe for Cinnamon Sweet Potato slices.  Thanks for submitting.... like I said, very nice flavor.

Overall not bad... I love sweet potatoes so it doesn't take a whole lot to please me... the thinner ones turned nicely into chips and the thicker cut ones I had stayed soft... both tasted good too... even the few taste ones I didn't put anything on tasted good... I guess it all depends what you are after if you want the alternative to potato chips be sure and slice thin... if you want sweet potato slices with cinnamon flavor leave them thicker... these taste good either way... I put the slices in a ziplock bag and added the butter mixture so much easier to coat that way.. thanks for submitting

Chips turned out soggy instead of crispy.  I used a mandoline slicer to cut the potatoes as thin and even as possible but they still didn't turn out well.

Burnt after 10 minutes.  Need to alter cooking temp or time or both!  Wish I could leave a review for the taste but they were to charred to tell.  Perhaps will try again and update review.

You really gotta cut these evenly and thinly, otherwise they take a lot longer to cook and are soft not crispy.

Awesome side dish, added a little vanilla extract and will probably use a little less salt next time.  I cut mine about 1/2" thick (not thinly sliced as others did) because I wanted them to be softer, not crispy, to be eaten as more of a side with dinner.  Healthier alternative to traditional sweet potato bake, my husband loved them!!!!

I used two large sweet potatoes and it made a ton - delicious, but fiddly.  I pretty much ate each batch as it came out of the oven, but to get them properly crisp I did need to bake at 350 for a bit longer (I think, I just watched the chips not the time and kept taking pans in and out of the oven) flipping them when they started to crisp and brown.  Even so, Dad still got a lot of charcoal chips.

These tasted fantastic, but I found it very difficult to cut them evenly enought to have them cook evenly.  A lot of work for a fairly small amount of food......but as I type I am starting to crave the flavor :)

They ARE a little hard to slice just right, maybe if I had a mandolin or something, but the flavor was great and what a healthy choice!  I'm trying to get my 21 month old to eat more veggies and this was a great way.  He had no clue!!

Recipe was amazing!  Found it was better to throw the chips into a gallon ziplock and add the mixture.  Then shake until covered with mix.  Also, found that they burn very easily, so need to pay close attention after about 10 minutes.  Family loves them.  They never last through a meal.

So good and the house smelled heavenly. I baked mine longer, turned, and they were still a wee bit moist, so I turned the oven off and cracked the oven door for another 6 or 8 minutes to let them crisp up. PERFECT.

Boil the sweet potatoes first to soften them so they're easier to slice. Makes the process easier and quicker! Would be great for feeding a crowd!

This is a great recipe. It's great for regular potato chips as well! Mine took longer than what this said, but my slices may have been a tad thick, but they worked out nicely.  These were a hit with everyone, my kids, husband, and other family that was over! Awesome!

Very delicious! Agree with other reviewer's note that the four stars is just because they're not crunchy like you'd expect a chip to be. But they are still very tasty, and I will make them again.

Yummy! I sliced my potatoes, sprayed a cookie sheet with olive oil and laid the potato slices in a single layer on the cookie sheet. Then I melted some butter and drizzled over the slices. I sprinkled the other items on each potato without measuring. I will make these on a weekly basis. They are VERY good.

These chips came out looking burnt and flimsy. I was tempted to toss them; but, my Hubby still wanted to "taste" them. He ended up eating them all. He said they were delicious...especially the really thin ones. A little chewy, a little crispy. I did use a bit more butter and coated both sides of the chips before baking them.

I sliced as thin as I could, brushed the topping on, and baked only at 350 - kept an eye on them, they were done in about 20 min, with a few of the smaller slices burned. I took them out and tasted them, sprinkled a little more salt and they tasted pretty good. Some were crispier than others, based on the thinness of the slice I guess. My first time making sweet potato "chips" but I am not sure if I would make them again. That's just me, I am sure others will like them.

I did like this recipe.  The first batch did have about 1/2 of the chips get burned but I found that was because of the various sizes.  It's important to stay with "same-size chips" or take smaller ones out first and leave bigger ones in the same length of time.  It's also important to keep them thin.  You can adjust your oven temp or cooking time for soft/crisp results.  I used organic sweet potatoes and other ingredients for an even healthier recipe!

Didn't work.  Half the chips came out burnt and half not cooked at all.  Plus, the flavor did not turn out at all as a expected.

Despite using a mandolin so all the slices would be identical thickness, some were nicely browned and others not at all. Taste was merely OK, not great. I'll keep looking, thanks.

We ate all of them as soon as they came out of the oven.
I smeared the butter on with my hands, then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on and some salt and pepper.  Yummmm.

Maybe it's because I peeled the sweet potatoes instead of slicing them, but most of them burned even though I took them out early and reduced the temperature to 375.  I wanted them thin like chips and was afraid if I sliced them they would be mushy.

I cut one jumbo-size sweet potato into chunks and then sliced the chunks with the thicker slicer on my mandoline (the thinnest slicer made them so paper thin I'd have needed five baking sheets to spread them out on). I had a cinnamon/brown sugar mixture left over from a previous dish, so I substituted 2 1/2 tsp. of it for the cinnamon and brown sugar called for in the recipes. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The "chips" were delicious but they did not crisp up at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The edges did curl up though. Both my husband and I enjoyed them nevertheless.

After 10 minutes the ones that were sliced very thin were burned and the thicker ones were chewy. Good flavor though.
