This is a good recipe with lots of missing pieces. The amount of water to cover the beets should be more defined as it makes the gravy. The sauce could be improved by blending some/all of the beets. The meat needs salt & pepper before the flour.  The amount of time on the roast is more than an hr. I will make this again with adjustments. Anna

Forget the oil, there's plenty in the pork already

I made it as an International dish for school children. It tastes wonderful and is tender. Those who tried it, REALLY liked it, but many couldn't get past the unique red color from the beets.
