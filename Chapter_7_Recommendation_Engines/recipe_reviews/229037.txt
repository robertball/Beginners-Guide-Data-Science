This is actually the first time I used a recipe from the site.  I had no idea what it would taste like, or look like.  Well it looks and tastes great!  So much fun to try something randomly.  I halved the recepie, just because I did not know what it would be like.   Also I did not use as much oil as it says above, but it does say as needed :)   Thanks!

I made this for my family (who are very picky) and everyone loved it! I wouldn't change a thing, but it is great as it is.

I loved this recipe! I have never fried chicken before and this came out wonderful. I did use a meat thermometer, but I was pretty much spot on for when it needed to be taken out. The recipe sounds really unorthodox and I was weary of it at first but it just follow along and you'll get a great result!

one star because the cooking time was off, you need about double the time to cook properly.

Needed more flavor. I probably will not make it again, if so will add some flavor.

All of the batter falls off in the fryer! Not only was the chicken not coated after frying, but my fryer had batter all over it!
