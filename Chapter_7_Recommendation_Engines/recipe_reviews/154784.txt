I came across this amazing recipe while looking for something to make w/leftover turkey from Xmas.  I boiled the turkey carcass and used the stock instead of water-but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  It was absolutley fantastic and my husband loved it too.  I actually made a double batch and we ate it for a week w/o getting sick of it.  Top it w/cheese or sourcream...Mmmmmm!

A busy day winner!  I made this in 10-15 minutes, put it in the crockpot on hi and served 2 hours later.  I have a smaller crockpot, so added only 1/2 the corn and skipped the tomato soup.  I intended to add some tomato paste if it was too thin, but it was not needed.  The cheese, sour cream and crushed tacos were perfect.  It was a hit with my family - everyone wanted seconds.

I am so glad I discovered this recipe when searching for a turkey soup recipe to use up the leftover Xmas turkey. It was awesome! Very simple to make and it was super tasty. We had some friends over for dinner and everyone loved it so much that we all had at least seconds! I followed the recipe pretty closely except I was out of cumin so I used cayenne pepper. I also used Italian diced tomatoes and fiesta tomato soup instead of plain diced tomatoes and tomato soup. I will definitely make this again especially when we have leftover turkey. It is much better than plain old turkey soup.

This was wonderful.  I used a smoked bone in turkey breast which added a whole dimension to the soup.  I didn't have corn so I added diced green pepper.  I also added 2 tsps of my homemade chili powder mix  and 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp oregano.  My hubby loved it as he had a cold and he could still taste this delicious soup.

This turned out okay although there was a lot leftover so I don't think it was a huge hit with the family.  I subbed chicken which was good in this dish.  I used a 14-1/2 oz. can of diced tomotoes and think the larger can would be far too much.  Pretty much followed as written otherwise.  I think it was very "tomatoey" which may have been why the kids didn't go for seconds.  Topping it with cheese and sour cream do help tone that down a bit.

Just okay. I used a double batch of Bill Echols taco seasoning (cutting way back on the salt and chili pepper)and instead of using water and bouillion cubes, I used low sodium chicken broth. I also added the cilantro to the soup about 15 minutes before serving and added a couple tbsp. of fresh lime juice. The condensed soup added a nice creamy flavor and thickened up the soup just enough. This was easily adapted for the crockpot and was a nice inviting smell after a long, cold day. Great with Amusement Park Cornbread and a nice cold Dos Equis. My only issue with this is my family didn't care for it. This makes quite a bit for one person to eat on her own, unless you freeze it in lunch sized portions. Be sure your family likes taco soup.

Very good.  It wasn't very spicy though, so I added a jalapeno pepper and some extra cumin.

Thanks to my daughter, Leanne, my husband and I got to try this very excellent soup.  It is also very nutritious. Would recommend it to everyone.  I'm sure this would be equally as good with chicken (in place of turkey).  I could eat it morning, noon and night.

This was great!  I kept it low fat and left out the cheese and cream and it was great.  I also got more servings the out of a batch then suggested.  It reminds me of one of the name brand's "southwestern" soup I eat a lot of.  I can't wait till the day after thanksgiving!

Looking for something a little different than typical Turkey Frame Soup with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I had to half it for the three of us, but now wish I had not.  Really good.  Since we all love beans of all kinds, I used a full can of black beans and didn't have any cilantro, so I skipped that and used close to a 1/2 cup of sour cream (because we love it) and it turned out absolutely perfect.  Ended up serving with homemade nachos.  There is not a drop left!  We will certainly do this again and again.  Since we don't have turkey all that often, next time will likely be chicken.  Just excellent!

Absolutely delicious! I've never been a big fan of any type of taco soup because I usually find them bland and ordinary, but this was definitely neither.   I made only a couple of minor changes from the original recipe. I used only 2 cups of shredded turkey, I used chicken broth instead of water, and I used 2 cans of black beans instead of 1. It was perfect! I think twice as much turkey would have been way too much.   I will definitely be making this recipe every year after the holidays with my leftover turkey.

I always buy a very large turkey now so that I can make sure I have enough leftover for this soup.  I don't use the salsa; I use Rotel instead. It adds however much spice you want depending on if you use mild, medium or hot. I also don't bother with the sour cream. I suppose it adds a little extra special something, but I don't need the calories. I think this is so good. It is basically a turkey tortilla soup. My husband and kids are not soup fans, but they LOVE this one.

To me tomato soup is too sweet and bouillon too salty.  I will use canned broth-low sodium & fat, then less water.  Also mexican style tomatoes or tomatoes & green chiles and maybne a can of mexican tomato sauce.  That may be a local product but it is spicy good!  Also for taco soup I cut corn tortillas is strips & bake instead od purchased tortilla chips-less fat & salt.

Sooooo yummy!  I substitute chicken stock for the water and bouillon cubes, and use 1 can Rotel in lieu of salsa... Delicious recipe, perfect for leftover turkey at Thanksgiving or anytime.  I love to make it year-round, but whole turkeys can be hard to find/expensive apart from the holidays... I have used turkey breast or filets during the off-season, but it's best using meat from a whole turkey.

Warm, comforting and loaded with flavor pretty much describes this soup.  My girlfriend made this and brought it to our house for dinner.  The first night we ate it, we had it with just crushed tortilla chips.  Hubby ate 2 large bowls.  For lunch the next day, I topped mine with tortilla chips and sour cream.  It was delicious both ways.  I think this is a soup that improves with flavor the longer it sits.  Thanks SSTRAWDER for sharing.

A definite keeper.  Only change we made was chicken broth instead of bullion cubes.  Also, we just added the cilantro at the table instead of during cooking.  Not too spicy, but that can be adjusted to personal taste.  Definitely a pleasant change from traditional turkey soup. We're usually so sick of turkey leftovers, that this soup at least felt like quite a change up from the typical turkey dinner flavours.  Thanks so much!!!

I actually found this recipe not initially on this site, but published in my local newspaper the other day (they did, of course, mention that the source was allrecipes.com).  I'm sure it is quite delicious as written, but I made a few changes due to the ingredients I had on hand and to use up another.  I did not use condensed tomato soup, but rather tomatoe juice as I did not have the soup on hand.  I also used dried rather than fresh cilantro.  I threw in about 1 1/2 c. of leftover cooked rice.  I found the soup needed a bit more seasoning so I increased the chili powder, oregano and cumin by one half. Served with the same toppings as listed, but again, with the dried cilantro.  Very good, hearty soup and a great way to use up that leftover turkey.

This was a decent recipe.  I used Neufchâtel cheese (2oz.) instead of sour cream.  And added some cayenne pepper and extra oregano. Needed extra spice.  Might add a jalapeño next time.  Note, without the toppings it's only about 220 cal per cup.

I made this soup 2 times now. It is wonderful with pepper smoked turkey (greenberg) from the holidays. I made it once in my dutch oven and once in the crock pot (i did saute the onions, garlic and herbs before adding it to the crockpot). It was perfect both times. I made 2 changes: I used chicken stock instead of water/bullion and I didnt add sour cream to it, we added it individuality along with cheese and green onions. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe!  I kept to the recipe pretty much to the tee except I didn't have black beans so I used fava beans.  So good!  I also added a garnish - sliced avocado.  Definitely a great and easy way to use leftover turkey! Thanks!

Salsa? In soup?  Yes!  Yes!  A thousand times yes!  At first glance, I doubted the idea and was averse to the very thought, but, becoming possessed of a strange inclination to ruin the soup and then grant it a single, measly star, I laughed in glee as I poured not one-half, but a whole cup of salsa into the steaming pot.  And yet, as I stirred the concoction, a delicious smell filled my nostrils.  "What a queer circumstance," I told myself.  "It is but a deception."  All the same, I had to taste it for myself.  And as I held the spoon up to my lips - oh, drat.  I just ran out of characters.

Since finding this recipe years ago, I have made it dozens of times.  This is always a hit!  I have made it for crowds of more than 100, made it for my family, canned it, frozen it, etc.  The depth of flavor is incredible and will fool your diner into believing it took you all day to develop the its layers.  You will have others asking for the recipe and begging for your secret!

Oh. My. Goodness! This is absolutely incredible! We made it after Thanksgiving, and my kids were devastated that I took it to work for lunch, instead of leaving it home while they were on break. The day after Christmas, they were asking me to make it again.  I did use my own canned tomatoes instead of canned diced, but that's the only change I made. Even my picky-eater sister liked this one. Absolutely EXCELLENT!!!!

I made a lot of variations to the recipe based on my Christmas dinner leftovers.  I used stock from my Christmas turkey and maintained the liquid-herbs/spices ratio.  Based on that I think its fair to say I followed closely enough to know this is a delicious change of pace from my usual turkey-wild rice soup.  And after 6 turkey meals I was desperate for a change of pace.  I will definitely make this again but omit the addition of sour cream (to the simmering soup).  Mine did not blend into the soup well, instead I got white blobs, miniscule but not attractive.  My sour cream was from a new container well within the use by dates--so I don't know what went wrong.

My family thought this was excellent, not to spicy but had some zest.  We wanted more vegetables so I used frozen mixed veggies instead of just corn, and did not add sour cream during cooking.  Perfect to use leftover turkey on a cold autumn day.

Did not care for this @ all. Very bland and lacking in the flavor I thought it would have.  We unfortunately ended up throwing the whole pot out because no one cared for it :(~ thanks anyway!

I made this with a few of my own changes (omitted the condensed soup, used a mexican seasoning blend instead of chili powder and added freshly roasted chili peppers). The recipe used as a base was VERY good!

Very good, a great way to use up leftover turkey, though this recipe would be good with chicken too. Giving this soup a Tex-Mex spin was brilliant, quite an improvement from another turkey sandwich.

In February, 2016, I tried a twist on this recipe that turned out really well. First, I didn't have any leftover turkey, so I used ground turkey, which was fine.

When I realized I didn't have any salsa in the house, I used a half cup of taco sauce, a half cup of  sweet chili sauce, and a couple of tablespoons of chili paste, the later two of which can be found in the Asian aisle at most super markets.  

These changes provided the soup with an interesting "sweet/heat" vibe that made it seem like a completely new recipe. SO good. My wife and son LOVED it, as did I.

I had made my own stock from the leftover turkey bones.  That was really the only thing I changed.  This had some really good flavor.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the water/chicken bouillan combo...I've used it before and I prefer a homemade stock.

This soup was great!  I used leftover turkey that I'd frozen from Christmas.  I cooked the recipe as stated and then threw it in the crock pot to keep it warm for a few hours.  It was great!  Great reheated too.

My family enjoyed this soup.  I left out the sour cream, because my husband does not like it.  We just added it to our bowl before we ate it.  I didn't have frozen corn, so I just used canned corn and it was fine.  Also did not have cilantro.

Easy, lasted for many meals, and tasted great!  I thought it was more of a stew than a soup, especially with the chips in at the end.  It was chili, tomato soup, and brunswick stew all in one.   We enjoyed it with grilled cheese.

Great idea and no "leftover" flavor. However, it was a bit bland for us as written. It was better when I heated up the leftovers and added an 1/8 t of Taco Seasoning I, also found on this site, to each 1 - 1 1/2 C serving.

Great way to use up turkey.  I added a can of diced green chilies to mine.  I also added the salsa at the very end so it would not become to spicy for my kids.

I made this soup almost exactly as per the directions (except I only used 1.5 tsp Chili powder and forgot to add the tomatoes) and my fiance and I still thought this was mildly spicy-- we made sure to have enough sour cream on the top to help tone down the spice a bit.  This would be too spicy for people who don't tolerate spiciness well (i.e. my mother :).  We had this as leftovers for a few days afterwards as well and it was even better-- great with extra cheese and scooped up with tortilla chips.  Thanks!

My husband just reminded me to rate this soup a five :) This is a great and extremely easy way to use leftover turkey. We substituted fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream but otherwise kept it the same. We like things spicy, so adding some cayenne pepper, hot green chiles, or jalapeno peppers might be nice in the future. Great soup!

This soup is absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as stated. My husband was very leary at the thought of turkey used in a mexican recipe, but he ate multiple helpings and even raved about it to some friends with whom I had shared some of the soup. Definitely a keeper recipe! thanks for sharing!

This was SOOOOO GOOD!!!! Had leftover turkey from a turkey breast we had on Thanksgiving. Im so glad my leftovers went towards something so yummy!! All I had for toppings was shredded cheese and sour cream, and it was still amazing. Also decided to freeze some that we couldnt fiinsh off. Cant wait to have again! Oh yeah, and my 2 year old LOVED it as well!

YUMMY!!! Just made this last night and my husband and I were highly impressed. I left out the onion and diced tomatoes and added a bit extra spice, and the end result was delish. Quick, easy, and a  much needed change of pace from the usual leftover turkey fare. Thanks for the post! I will definately be making this again.

Amazing!  You could very easily substitute shredded chicken.  I used about half of the turkey it calls for.  I seasoned to taste with garlic salt, salt, and onion powder.  The fresh green onions and cilantro send it out of this world.

wonderful!!  we were looking for a way to use up all the left over turkey from Thanksgiving and this caught our eyes.  We didn't have a can of diced tomatoes so we just omitted those and used tomato paste because we didn't have tomato soup.  the smell from the kitchen is awesome and we can't wait to dive in, however I've been sampling some bites here and there.  this is very good considering I hate soup!!  mmmm delicious!

This was delicious. My family loved it. I had leftover chicken broth from Thanksgiving so I used that instead of water and chicken cubes. I had tomato sauce and not tomato soup. And I prefer pinto beans instead of black beans. Those were the only changes I made. This was awesome!

This was very good.  I made it exactly as printed.  My family likes a little more heat, but that's an easy enough fix while tasting.  Will def make again with a few tweaks to adjust to our liking.

This is a belated review, so bear with me. I really liked this soup, it was easy to throw all my extra turkey in and have a different taste (ie, no turkey sandwiches). It was pretty spicy though. If you are sensitive to that, it might be a good idea to substitute some of the flavors, or turn it down. Either way, its a great recipe to try, especially with all that leftover thanksgiving turkey.

Used chicken, left out the parsley as I realized too late that I didn't have any. Left out all dairy due to dietary restrictions. Pretty simple. Good way to use left overs. Was a little too watery for me, so I kept simmering to desired thickness. Also used only one cup of corn based on personal preference.

I also made stock from the Thanksgiving carcass - and didn't have tomatoes so used all salsa.  This is delish!

This was amazing.  I admit to altering the recipe a bit due to ingredients.  Instead of the bouillon and water, I used 2 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken broth that I had leftover from thanksgiving.  I also added a can of white kidney beans to it and used canned corn instead of frozen.  I put everything in the crockpot for a few hours to simmer.  I didn't add the sour cream to the soup - I let everyone just add it as a topping if they wished.  This was a very welcome change from the typical turkey leftovers and sandwiches.  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks for the wonderful idea!

Great recipe!  Made a bunch, my family loved it and ate well, and I had leftovers for lunch for two days.  Crushed chips and sour cream on top are a must. I added a pureed chipotle pepper in adobo sauce for smoky spiciness.   I also happened to have a zucchini, so diced it up and added it towards the end.  I wouldn't recommend adding the turkey until the very end, as mine was already cooked and didn't want to overcook it.  But really this recipe is delicious as is and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again without my additions.

Used this with some leftover turkey. Husband isn't a huge soup fan, but he liked it for a soup. That's high praise coming from him.

What a yummy soup!  We all loved it.  I made a few changes:  used homemade chicken stock, no tomato soup & half the amount of tomatoes.  I also just put everything in the crock pot and it turned out great.  For leftovers, I combined the filling (strained out the liquid) with scrambled eggs  & made breakfast burritos.  They were super good too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this soup! A big hit with the family. I made a few changes to use what I had on hand. I used chicken broth for half the water and did not add the bouillon. I only used one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and one 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of soup. I added a small can of diced chiles to punch up the heat a little. I  did not add any sour cream because my kids are not fans but my husband and I used it as a topper. Alot of options with this recipe. I'm sure I will make it again and again!

Wow! I made this on my lunch hour! I did not put the can of diced tomatoes in because my husband hates tomatoes and I did not have any cumin so I used a bit of ceyenne pepper instead but Oh My Gosh! Soooo good! I Sauted the onions and garlic and then threw all ingredients in a crockpot on low setting and went back to work for 3 hours and it was delish when I got home!

This soup is a definite 5+. I made a few changes to suit personal preference...we are not big tomatoe fans so I skiped the tomatoe soup, instead of canned tomatoes I seeded two large organic tomatoes and cut in small bits, skipped salsa, used fresh parsley from my garden, skipped boullion and instead used 3 cups organic chicken broth and 3 cups water, 3 cups of organic black turtle beans that I boiled for 1 1/2 hours and drained in place of canned beans, 1 cup frozen corn, light sour cream, skipped cilantro because didn't have any, added additional spices and hot sauce. Cooked on high for about 4 hours in crock pot. Before serving I squeezed fresh lime over each bowl; offered choice of recommended topings.  As per advice of another reviewer I made my own tortilla chips and squeezed a bit of lime over them as well. Even my ever so picky significant other  took a bite and said "this is good"...he even had a small second bowl. Good job, guys, keep em' coming! Happy Holidays!

This was surprisingly good!!!  My 7 yr old had seconds, which is good cuz he doesn't usually care for soup. I put it all in the crock pot on high and it was ready in 2 hours. I left out the canned tomatoes, though, and added a little cheese. This, with the sweet dinner rolls on this web site, was yummy!!!

I thought this was 5 stars exactly as written. Definitely give this one a try. You can always tweak the seasonings to your taste if you want it spicy, but I thought it was an excellent soup as is.

We loved this soup.  Since I had turkey stock on hand, I used that instead of water and bouillon, but I otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I fried up strips of corn tortillas to put on top along with Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream.  It was delicious.

Deeeeeeee-licious. I followed it exactly and I'm glad I did. It made a nice big batch of super tasty soup. I didn't serve it with the suggested garnish but with Absolute Mexican Cornbread and it's a wonderful meal.

Very good! and low carb too! I didn't modify it very much, only to suit what I had on hand. Some home-made chicken broth and canned  broth to make up the liquid, I can of corn, didn't have any tomato soup so I added a couple of TBSP's of paste.

I had almost all the ingredients in my house the day after Thanksgiving so I tried this. (No parsley) I let the carcass boil in the broth for a while to get the rest of the turkey off. I accidentally put the whole jar of salsa in before I read 8oz so I just left out the can of chopped tomatoes. I'm not a huge fan of them anyway but it worked out perfectly.  You could spice it up by adding a hotter salsa or any hot peppers you like.

I didn't have any of the ingredients for the toppings but this still turned out really tasty. Even my picky 3 year old loved it. I will definitely be making this from now on with all of our turkey leftovers.

Excellent!  The entire family ate it--even my picky 14 year old!  Used fresh diced onion instead of minced and 28 oz can of Rotel Original instead of the diced tomatoes, otherewise went strictly by the recipe.  YUMMY!!!!!

Love this soup!  The only changes I made since I had to use what I had on hand was subbed out the tomato soup and boullion cubes for a 6oz can of tomato paste and the leftover turkey stock and gravy from when I roasted the turkey. Amazingly good!  I'm a fan of cilantro, so that was perfect added on top with the shredded cheese and sour cream. Oh, I didn't add the sour cream in the soup as I was making it either.  Just on top after it was done :)

I had to substitute some of the ingredients for what I had but I absolutely loved the results! I'm so glad to have come across this recipe tonight!
I thought I had thawed out turkey but because it wasn't labeled it ended up being pork. I didn't have tomato soup, so I watered down tomato sauce. I free poured the spices and probably used more onions and garlic than called for. I will use this one again. Loved the mix of the sour cream and cilantro, next time though, I will add some lime juice to the topping.

I loved this receipe.  I added a can of diced green chilies and used a drained can of corn instead of the frozen.  Other than that I followed the receipe.  My husband added hot sauce to his cause he likes his spicy, I added sour cream and shredded cheddar to mine and the kids cause we don't.  It is definately on our do over list.

My aunt sent me this recipe after we hosted Thanksgiving and had tons of turkey left over. I made a change to it the first time, but it was one of the best soups I've ever tasted. The change I made was to use salsa verde (the green salsa) instead of regular salsa, since we didn't have any on hand. The rest of the ingredients were already in our kitchen. The second time around, I used regular mild salsa, a large can of crushed tomatoes, and instead of chicken flavoring used a beef soup base dissolved in water, where I had used the chicken soup base before. It was a different flavor, but still very good. I also used browned ground turkey the second time, since the leftovers were long gone. It was great! You can probably use chicken or browned ground beef as well. I'm going to also try it with pork loin if I have leftovers. On the side this time, I melted a little cheddar cheese on top of a plate of tortila chips and sprinkle that with cumin and chili powder. We used those to dip into the soup. It was so good as something to add a little crunch. This recipe is staying in my recipe box and also getting printed out so I always have it. 

You can used kidney beans in it as well. I guess I made more changes than I thought! The cilantro I used was dried, so I just sprinkled it in without measuring. The important thing is that it's so versatile that as long as you stick with the basic seasonings and water proportions, you can't go wrong no matter what you add.

Great way to use the leftover turkey.  I made a few changes that made it a real winner. I added a cup more turkey and an additional can of black beans to make it heartier.  Also, I used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of the bullion and water.  I diced fresh tomatoes in the blender instead of using the canned tomato. Two tablespoons more of chili powder and a teaspoon more of cumin really spiced it up. A squeeze of fresh lime and twice the amount of garlic heightened the flavors.  I left out the sour cream to keep the calories down.

Amazing!  Would give it more stars if I could.  Made with turnkey leftovers and was the best soup ever!  Loved the kick too.  Froze some and enjoyed it later even more!  Much better than turkey sandwiches for the next week and I felt like a great cook!

I made this with some left over turkey. It was a bigger hit than the turkey dinner. I made it exactly as directed. This made enough food for dinner for 7 and plenty of leftovers.

Made a few substitutions. Doubled the onion, since I had a medium onion. Added 1 more clove garlic, and doubled the cumin and oregano. Instead of regular diced tomatoes, used fire roasted with green chiles. Used no salt added canned corn I had on hand. And finally, left out the sour cream and added a good glug of bottled lime juice instead. Served with shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and minced pickled jalapeños.

What a great surprise to have it turn out even better than I expected (despite it's 5 star rating!!)  AWESOME way to use up turkey leftovers - I may have to make turkey more often just to have them, LOL!  It could use a few more beans but the seasonings, etc were great as is.   Thank you!

Used 1 16oz can of tomato sauce instead of soup, 1 16 oz can of tomatoes (plenty) and red kidney beans because I didn't have black beans.  Added 1 can of green chiles to kick it up.  Unfortunately I  Didn't have cilantro.  Disguises the turkey but Not too bad.

Very tasty but I only gave 4 stars because I doubled the spices, corn, black beans and cilantro.  I think it would've been missing something without at least doubling the spices and cilantro.

This was really, really good! My husband almost ate 3 bowls. Had only half of the diced tomatoes so I used Rotel which worked fine. I think it's the addition of the sour cream that really makes it! Thanks!!

One of the yummiest soups I have ever had! 5 stars are an understatement. Highly recommend!
Update: The salsa that you use in this soup will determine whether this soup is awesome or just ok, so use your favourite salsa!

This was absolutely fantastic! I was skeptical when I saw the tomato soup and diced tomatoes since I am not fond of tomato soup. I didn't have the diced tomatoes anyway, so I used tomato sauce and it was fine. I had no cilantro, but decided to use some diced green chilies instead. This gave it a little more zip. And best of all...my husband raved over it! Thanks

Awesome!!!! One of the best Tex Mex soups I ever had. I did change a couple things. First I didnt add any salsa in it because I didnt know what kind so I added Pico de gallo (medium) to the toppings. As for the water I put 2 1/2 cups and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth. It was amazing, my wife, who doesnt like dark meat and doesnt care for soup, absolutly loved it. Thanks

This was a great soup to take up the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. Altered a little. The inside of the turkey was stuffed with celery and onions so chopped those up and put them in the stew, some frozen corn, a can of rotel and can of diced tomatoes, a can of ranch style beans, minced garlic, leftover chicken broth and some of the chicken bouillon mixed with water, oregano, cumin, and chili powder. I put it all in the crockpot on high for 5 hours and it came together beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic way to use the leftover carcass of your Thanksgiving turkey, and it makes for a better soup.  Boil down the carcass with a chopped onion, a bay leaf, salt, & a wedge of lime (the acid helps extract the calcium from the bones).  Put this through a strainer to get your 4 cups of broth, and substitute this broth for the 4 cups of water and 3 boullion cubes.  The boiled carcass is also a frugal source for your 4 cups of shredded turkey.  And I add a wedge of lime to the list of toppings... a little squirt of lime juice goes perfectly with these Tex-Mex flavors.

Simply wonderful!!  I used left over rotisserie chicken and some left over grilled chicken breasts in place of the turkey. I also subbed 1 can of Rotel for the salsa, 1 can of southwestern corn and used 3 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup water and 2 bouillon cubes.  Amazing. The cilantro is vital for that authentic Mexican flavor. Even better the next few days. This is going to be my new standby for using up the leftover rotisserie or roasted chicken!

Followed the recipe and it was still lacking something.  Added some taco seasoning and it helped tremendously.  This soup is FULL of turkey!  Interesting use of turkey, but I probably won't make it again.

Good soup - I didn't use cilantro, because I can't stand it, and waited to add sour cream as a garnish (and then mixed it in before eating).  I also used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon cubes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was tasty, but not really something that I'd write home about.

This soup is fantastic! What a great way to use leftover turkey. I subbed tomato sauce for the condensed soup, but other than that I made as written. If you want to cut down on the calories/fat, you can just leave out the toppings, the soup is great by itself.

I was a bit skeptical having turkey in what sounded like a version of chicken tortilla soup recipe, but WOW! This was really good! I played with the seasonings and used whatever I had on hand, left out the beans, and my family was licking their bowls! This is a keeper and definitely beats turkey sandwiches!!!!

This soup was awesome! I used turkey broth instead of bouillion and fire roasted tomatoes since that's what I had on hand. I also only used the sour cream as a garnish. I had some friends over and they couldn't stop raving about it, delicious!

Made this for our Friday night Happy Hour group  and it was a huge hit.  I omitted the condensed tomato soup and used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and boullion,and increased the spices.  I will make this again and again.

This soup was really delightful!  I made the following modifications...  Instead of using 4 cups of water, I used two cans of chicken broth, and then a little additional water swirled around in the empty Tomato Soup can to get all of the soup stuck to the sides of the can.  I used reduced fat sour cream.   The onion (then garlic separately) I minced in a mini food processor.   Instead of corn, I added a can of Hominy (much more authentic Mexican)… this produced a wonderful corn flavor in the soup, wow!  I also added about 1/2 cup diced roasted Hatch green chili’s (I happen to have several pounds in my freezer).  I didn’t use cilantro as a condiment, and added about 1 Tbls dry cilantro instead of the fresh, as I didn’t want to pay the outrageous prices for out of season fresh cilantro.   I didn’t use any green onion as a garnish, but thought that it would be good… and also thought some sliced radishes would be good for some garnish crunch in the soup.

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of water and bouillon I used turkey stock that I made from my Thanksgiving turkey. The soup was spicier than I thought it would be, but I love spicy foods. For anyone who can't eat spicy foods, I'm sure it could be made milder by cutting back on the chili powder and using mild salsa (I used medium). The recipe doesn't call for any added salt, and I found that it didn't need any; it was perfectly seasoned.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Really good.  Very hearty.  I had a ton of leftover turkey and couldn't eat anymore sandwiches.  This was perfect.  I didn't have cumin and it still turned out great.  I added a little cayanne for extra heat, and did increase the other spices like a lot of other reviewers.  A great way to not let the leftovers go to waste!

This was a delicious recipe! I boiled the turkey frame and used the broth instead of the 4 cups water and decreased the bouillon to 1 teaspoon. I also left out the tomato soup because I did not have a can and substitued the frozen corn for a frozen corn/mix that equaled about four cups. I added some Hatch green chili which gave it an extra kick.   My husband loved it!. I will make again for sure and probably try with chicken so I don't have to wait until next Thanksgiving to have it again. Thank you for the recipe!

Everybody in the family loved this.  I made just a few changes.  I added extra garlic, used four cans of chicken broth rather than the water, two cans of black beans and 1 jar of green salsa.  My husband is not a huge fan of turkey but absolutely loved this.  I'll make it again.

I took all the ingredients...even the sour cream and threw them in a crock pot for four hours.  tasted wonderful.  The only prep was cooking the onions and garlic... that way you get the carmelization and really release the flavors of them into the soup.

Awesome recipe!  I used a 16 oz container of chipotle salsa from Trader Joes and added about a cup of minute brown rice for a heartier dish.  FI loves it and I even snuck in some dark turkey meat that no one will eat.  Yes!

Good stuff! I did double up all of the spices except the garlic after reading other reviews that it was a little bland. Also used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water which gave the soup a really rich taste. The only problem I came across was that my sour cream didn't dissolve well when I stirred it into the soup- I think the soup may have been too hot. I would recommend stirring it in just before serving after it has had a while to cool down from the boil.

Definitely delicious, but it is WAY more than a 10 min prep time, more like 30-40 minutes when you include the shredding of the turkey.

This was great! I wish I could give it 6 stars. I didn't use cilantro as I don't care for it, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great. My husband, who isn't a big soup eater and my 15 year old son couldn't get enough.

I find excuses to make a turkey now just to have left over meat to make this.  So good and sure beats the drudgery of having to eat left over turkey for days on end.  I do not recommend freezing this as the sour cream separates and it does not taste as good as the day you made it.

THIS IS GREAT!!!  I just made it, I came across this recipe trying to find something to do with a turkey breast that I bought.  Rather than using leftovers, I boiled a 10lb breast for 3 hours until the meat fell off the bone. I used the stock and added the ingredients from there.  I did not use the tomato soup, rather, I used chopped and crushed tomatoes.  This soup is heavenly!!  Great job!  Thank you for sharing:-)

This is pretty tasty, but on the tomato-y side if you were expecting a "tortilla" soup. I added more chili powder and cumin, plus a couple of jalapeno peppers. I would make it again!

This was the BEST soup I've ever made. I Increased the cumin to 1 tsp and omitted the oregano and tomato soup. Instead of the salsa, I added a can of green enchilada sauce (medium hot) and I only used a 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes (used a can with Mexican spices added). Sprinkled crushed tortilla chips and cheese on top and it was DELCIOUS! Can't wait for lunchtime!

Yummy yummy.  Also a 5 star review from hubs.  Here are my substitutes.  Used hot sauce - a few shakes -- instead of chili powder.  Canned corn instead of frozen.  Also -- used shredded turkey cutlets slow-cooked the day before.  Coated them in Lipton onion dip in a zip lock bag, added enough water to cover bottom of crock pot...set to cook on low 5 hours.  Even my toddler loved this recipe!

This soup lacked a lot of flavor. I ended up adding several teaspoons of taco seasoning, which helped, but it was never great. Edible, but I would not make again.

Didn't have shredded turkey or fresh cilantro.  Used ground turkey, which I cooked in advance, and added extra parsley at the end in place of the cilantro, and it turned out great.  I also added extra salsa, for two reasons:  only had one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and because we like things spicy.  Worked out well.  It's a flexible, yet yummy recipe, which is perfect.  If you're watching your weight, you could leave out the sour cream and cheese and it would still be very good.  Glad to have this recipe in my book!  Thanks.

WOW! Wow! wow!  This was a hit with my family.  Great flavor and just enough spice to satisfy my "heat" lovers and those who aren't big fans of "hot and spicy".  Very good - will make it again... and again :)

I loved this soup! I was in the mood for something different and this was it! It had a little spicyness, but not too much-my 3 year old ate some! I will save this recipe for next year. It was easy to make too.

This was stupidly good! I played around with the seasonings a little, and added a touch more liquid as it was rather thick. Also used canned corn instead of frozen. Absolutely phenomenal - great contrast of flavors and textures. A great way to use of leftover turkey (beats pot pie any day of the week!). Thanks so much!

This is a great 'tortilla' soup...perfect for getting rid of turkey leftovers, but keeps a very tex-mex flavor.  Keeps well in a crock pot for potluck-get-togethers, too!

It was kind of bland. I was able to improve upon the leftovers by adding a fair bit more spice, including 1/2 a packet of taco seasonings. I would make it again with more spice, as it turned out quite well after I'd doctored it up a bit.

This soup was superb. I used homemade turkey stock instead of water and chicken bouillon, and I substituted frozen fire roasted corn from Trader Joe’s for the frozen corn. My husband thought it was the best soup I’ve ever made.   I will make it again and again.  Joan C.

Family loved it! I followed your recipe with 2 exceptions. I couldn't find the the jalapeño cream cheese so I used onion cream cheese and added a can of pinto beans (my family's preference). Leftovers were just as good, and I served it with warm corn tortillas. I will definitely make this again! I'm happy you shared it!

Such a great recipe for left over turkey. I did modify the recipe to a crock pot version where I threw everything into the pot and let it slow cook until dinner time because I’m a busy mom of 3 and like to utilize the crock pot’s ability to make dinner time quicker.  Added sour cream and cheese toppings to serve. Turned out soooo delicious will be making again for sure !

Really yummy.  First time making it I only put in 1/2 of the chili powder because I wanted my kids to eat it.  But it was not spicy at all!!  Next time I'm adding the full amount.

This is the best use of leftover turkey ever! I made this recipe as submitted except I had a small garnet yam on hand, so I diced it and added it to the soup. Simmered  for 15 minutes before adding the turkey, beans, and corn. Really excellent!

I forgot to say that instead of water and chicken bullion, I used the juices from the turkey (which was about half) and then veggie stock I had on hand. I am so impressed with this recipe!

Amazing! One of the best things I've made in a long time. Not overly spicy so you can kick it up to your preference with your own hot sauce.

Great comfort soup for a cold and rainy evening.  Instead of water I used broth made from leftover turkey carcass and celery sprigs.  Added turkey meat that fell off bones during cooking - result was a more flavorful soup.  Used minced dry onions instead of flakes and just a dash of chili powder.  With the toppings, it made for a great dinner.

I have made this soup a day or two after Thanksgiving dinner with the leftover turkey for several years now. My family loves it and looks forward to this meal almost as much as they do Thanksgiving every year. Enjoy!

This soup is delicious! I used the "Juicy Thanksgiving Turkey" recipe on here submitted by Kirsten (thanks Kirsten) and then decided to try this soup recipe with my turkey leftovers and it is wonderful--the only change I made was to dump everything in my crockpot and cook for 2 hours on high and added 1 cup of my turkey stock that was leftover from cooking my turkey  in lieu of 1 of the 4 cups of water for this recipe; add some cornbread and you have a great quick meal that is healthy and  comforting! I did rinse my turkey leftovers before shredding and putting in the crockpot as there was some of the rub left on them and I didn't want that to interfere with the flavor of the soup.  Thanks!

We loved it, but used what I had here at home so somethings were changed. One of can corn and the other was cream corn, and used rotel tomatoes instead of diced, also used chicken broth and added tablespoon of chicken broth base for added flavor. Yum Yum!!!!

So good. Used up aging canned corn and other ingredients. Only used half the salsa and it was still spicy for the kids. Next time I’m going to marinate the chicken pieces overnight because it was a bit bland in the center of chicken. Used veggie broth instead of water and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I couldn’t believe that the kids ate all the veggies up! Will definitely make again!

This soup is delicious. If you don't like Taco/Chili seasoning this might not be the soup for you. I do like it spicier so I added a little crushed red pepper. I will make this soup again.

I made this a few months ago.  It was Wonderful.  I did make a few adjustments.  I make bone broth from the turkey carcass (instead of water & bullion cubes).  I left out cilantro, family hates it.  I used low sodium tomato soup & mild salsa, low fat sour cream.  Family LOVED it!   I should have made more to eat later.  This recipe was a Big hit!

Thank you so much for this recipe. AMAZING. Followed exactly, with only one exception in using home made broth.  Hubs stated it was the best tex-mex soup he has ever had, and I would have to agree. I also like the addition of a touch of fresh squeezed lime juice at serving, which just brightened everything up. Total keeper. Make this now. Cheers

Yum!!! The only thing I changed was to use pinto instead of black beans because I didn’t have any. This is going into the regular rotation. For day to day I’d probably use chicken but I can’t see why it wouldn’t be just as yummy.

I love this dish. I make it with wild turkey legs in a slow cooker and it turns out fantastic. I suggest using hot salsa if you like it a little spicy!

Great easy soup and fantastic way to use Thanksgiving leftovers.  Hearty with just the right amount of seasoning.  Followed the recipe exactly except I substituted canned chicken broth for the boullion and water.   Also, no need for the sour cream or cheese on top if you are watching calories - soup was great without them.

I always freeze my left over turkey to avoid turkey overload. This year, it was getting crunch time before I had to pitch it!Then I came upon this recipe. I love nothing more than a quick and easy meal! We liked it so much, I specifically bought some turkey just to make it again!

Did as suggested and made turkey stock and used that instead of water. Wanted it more “diet” friendly so didn’t use sour cream and, while I tried it once with the cheese, later just omitted the cheese. Long story short, my husband who doesn’t like soup said he thought it was great and he’d eat it again. Oh and I used tomato basil soup as that’s what I had.

I made this in my new Pro Pressure cooker and it was crazy good.  I used dry black beans, no soaking and we didn't put any garnishes on top (trying to cut calories so no cheese).

This was fabulous!  I actually have most of these ingredients in my cabinet so easy to put together! The only thing I changed was using canned chilis (1 4oz can) and the same for the olives.  It just wasnt worth going to store!  It gave just the perfect amount of flavor and spice.   I also added a little more chicken stock because I like a little more broth.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I plan on making it again, again, and again!

We really liked this recipe.  I prepped everything the night before and assembled it after work, and ready to eat within 40 minutes.  I used  chicken broth instead of water, added a can of chopped green chiles, more chili powder, and garnished as recommended , plus some sliced black olives and a little hot sauce.   We like it spicy! Served with a salad, this was a very filling meal.  I'll be making it again.

Made it exactly as directed except I added a little minute rice to make it a bit heartier. After reading some of the reviews I also added a touch of taco seasoning. I used rotel instead of plain tomatoes (I didn't have any) and I think that gave it a nice kick which worked for us. Good as written but adjust spices to your preference

It’s delicious!  I skipped the bouillon cubes, substituted the water with chicken broth and used parsley and cilantro paste. A definite winner.

This has become a staple the week after Christmas Thanksgiving or Easter turkey. It is great as written but I usually sub out the canned tomato soup and replace with tomato sauce or watered down tomato paste. I also add a can of chopped green chilies which gives it just the right amount of kick- without that I find it a little bit bland. But overall a great hearty delicious soup that the whole family loves!

This was delicious.  8 of 9 kids came back for seconds, as did all the adults.  We'll definitely be making this one again!  I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and left out the tomato soup, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Made this last week using turkey stock, instead of water. The whole family, young and old thought it was great. Served with homemade focaccia bread. Will try it using chicken next time.
Thanks for a keeper recipe.

Delicious!  Used frozen cooked turkey carcasses to make broth and then shredded the dark meat for the soup.  Omitted the cilantro and added ground coriander.

Score! Looking for something to use up all this darn holiday turkey leftovers. Found this recipe quick snap. My husband and my one teenage son (my other one won't even look at a vegetable) gobbled this up. I doubled it and froze some. It re-heated wonderfully. So good. I don't think I made any changes to the recipe, which I often do. So Good. I'm making it tonight!

Made it and it was delicious. I did switch out the water for part beef broth and chicken broth.  Added fresh roma tomatoes because i only had a small can of crushed tomatoes. And added 1 jalapeño. The best ever. Will definitely make again!

I used no-salt chicken broth and drained the tomatoes.  Worried about an overly salty taste but the soup was very very good.  Also added a little hot sauce to make sure it was warm enough for our taste.  Really good.

Oh wow did I make it! I followed the directions except for a couple of things. I added the packaged Sazon seasoning (1 red packet), 3 huge table spoons of goya sofrito (store bought) and I made my own tortilla chips by deep frying tortilla shells. This was way better than the normal tortilla soup I buy. It was much cheaper and I loved the fact I was able to control the salt and seasonings. Oh yeah I didn't add the salsa because I don't like it very hot. My family including my niece was was a vegan (until she saw this cheesy gooey stooppppp). LOL!

Great soup!  I used tomato sauce rather than tomato soup because that is what I had.  Also added a can of rotel to spice it up.  Topped with FF Greek yogurt.  So tasty!

Wow!  As we were sick of leftover turkey sandwiches fromThanksgiving I was searching for something that didn't taste too much like turkey, and yet wanted to use up my leftovers. This really hit the spot. The flavor was very, very good. Mildly spiced, so you could kick it up if you prefer. My only change is that I left out the cilantro, only because I don't like the taste. It didn't taste as if something was missing. My husband loved it.

I wasn't sure I would like it because I usually don't like to cook with canned soup. So glad I made an exception, this is fantastic. I didn't have frozen corn so I used canned. Also had no bouillon so used chicken broth. Everything else was done as recipe called for. Do not forget the cheese on top. Will make this again and again.

This soup was a great change from regular turkey soup with leftover turkey! My only "changes" were doubling the cumin, chili, and oregano....and I added some ground coriander. It was really

What a great way to use up extra turkey! This is a really good, flavourful soup, the recipe is great as is.  I threw is some extra sliced mushrooms and peppers that I had in the fridge just because they were lying around, but that's it. Wouldn't change a thing!

My husband and I loved it. I made a few changes to the spices as I didn't have some of the ones called for in the recipe on hand. Would definitely make it again when we have left over turkey. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I had a lot of broth from our thanksgiving turkey so was looking for an alternative to the usual turkey soup.  I used turkey broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes...and it was EXCELLENT!

This recipe is incredible!  I now look forward to leftover turkey!  It's so flavorful, even my fussy hubby loved it and he's not usually a soup guy.  The only change I made was using homemade turkey and chicken stock instead of the water and bullion cubes.  As well, I had no black beans on hand so I used some chickpeas instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it's great!  Because my hubby doesn't like the texture of diced tomatoes, I threw all the ingredients for the second step into a blender and had a nice smooth creamy consistency.  For those worried about the salsa - don't, it works!! I also thought there would be too much corn and turkey but it's the perfect amount!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a tasty way to use up leftover turkey!!

This was an excellent soup although I did change it up a bit to use what I had on hand so didn't give it the full 5 stars.  I added 2 sliced carrots, 2 small stalks celery-diced, sliced red bell pepper (about 2/3 cup) and 4 mushrooms that I needed to use up.  Omitted the sour cream.  Used chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillan.  Served with shredded Mexican blend cheese and tortilla chips....very tasty, indeed.  Would make this again.

We kept out the onions, sour cream, and cilantro. I also made it in my crockpot instead of on the stove. It takes longer in the crock pot, but if you're not in a hurry to cook it's okay. Since we didn't do onions I just added the spices straight to the soup. Ours came out really spicy because my boyfriend decided to get the Hot Mexican Chili Powder and Spicy Salsa. I also added a tablespoon of garlic, but you couldn't really taste it. I also used cream corn on accident and it was really good. I think it calls for too much diced tomatoes so I would do a smaller can next time. We loved it though and we're going to try it again with different meats!

I made this exactly as stated except for one small change. I doubled the recipe and used 3 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes and one can of rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies. It was delicious as made, but a little too acidic for my stomach, so I added a teaspoon of sugar to cut down on the acid. Served this to my four men who just arrived back from a football game (Jets/Patriots. Meadowlands. Overtime. "Best game of the century"). They devoured it. I just put the cheese and crushed chips on top, didn't need the other stuff. used up all the leftover turkey I had on hand. This recipe is a definite keeper! Will replace my 'normal' turkey soup permanently.

This is the perfect base soup recipe! I have made at least half dozen times. Sometimes with turkey, other times with chicken. Just depends on what I have on hand. The spice level makes it a great family meal. The additional toppings can help to kick it up or mellow it out! It is definitely a keeper!

I definitely changed it up a bit since I am on a no carb diet, and didn't have left over turkey so used ground, and came out really well added a lot more veggies and cheese due to not adding the tortillas and definitely recommend it for someone on the same type of diet

Wonderful alternative to chili! Used regular organic tomato soup instead of condensed, garlic paste instead of cloves, fresh organic tomatoes instead of canned, and didn't include the sour cream. Topped with jalapeño tortilla strips for an extra kick.

This was really tasty! My husband and nine year old liked it too.  We used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I omitted the corn and sour cream and added black bean soup to make it more like chili.  It's a cross between chili and mexican tortilla soup.  Lots of ways to modify the recipe and garnish to taste.  Sure to please!

This recipe is amazing!  What a perfect way to use the left over turkey.  While cooking, the scent filling up the kitchen had my mouth watering.  I couldn't wait till it was done.  Since then, I've shared it with colleagues in my office...everyone loved it!  I've just shared this recipe w/colleagues.

Kept close to original recipe (for me), I only added can of tomatoes with green chilies (hot) instead of salsa, a second can of black beans, bag of frozen 3 color peppers/onion chopped, and doubled chili powder. I didn't use oil as I didn't cook onions first. Just threw it all in. Easy and so good, especially when turkey leftovers are getting boring. The peppers add a nice touch of color. Thanks for new recipe idea!

This recipe was a huge hit for my family! Absolutely delicious and will definitely make it again!! Only thing I did different was I used a 28 oz can of Rotel for the tomatoes. It gave the soup a little "kick"! So glad I found this recipe!

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was use 1 quart of Chicken Stock instead of the water and boullion cubes.

This was absolutely fantastic. I didn't change a thing. I think I'll use mild salsa next time and make it for my parents. Such a great use of left over turkey. Could use chicken or ground beef or turkey as easily.

Made exactly as stated.  Use fat free sour cream and all of the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Extra cilantro too.  Not spicy at all so the kidscould eat it.  They liked extra sour cream and shredded cheese on theirs.  This was very simple and quick- delicious!

This soup is a great way to use up left over turkey! The flavor is nice and mild, even my extremely picky 3 yr old ate it. I followed the recipe exactly as written, very good.

Wonderful recipe! We make it often and freeze leftovers. It freezes well.
We even use it during the  year with chicken. Works just as well. 5 stars in our book

What a great recipe to use all those turkey leftovers.  I did alter the seasonings a little, I used a seasoning salt mixture and omitted the bullion.  My whole family loved it including my fiancee who is not a fan usually of the taco soups.

Awesome soup! I made this for a Southwestern themed family gathering and received rave reviews and several requests for the recipe. I did make two small changes. I used an extra cup of salsa instead of the condensed soup and I used the broth produced from cooking the turkey instead of bullion cubes (bullion cubes and condensed soups have MSG which I try to avoid).

Excellent use of turkey! This is essentially tortilla soup and one of the best recipes I've come across. I like it hot so I add a bit more cumin and chili powder, plus hot sauce in the bowl. MUEY BUENO!

Very tasty.  I halved the recipe and made a few changes because of that and to make it healthier.  I used a few tablespoons of tomato paste instead of condensed soup, home made salsa, fresh parsley, and only 2 tablespoons of sour creme.  Also added some red pepper flakes, a dash of cayenne and paprika, and a dash of hot sauce.  Topped it with some crushed organic blue corn tortillas and some shredded cheddar.

Made this last night and it was wonderful! The only thing I did differently was use 4 cups of turkey stock that I had made with the leftover turkey carcass from Thanksgiving instead of the water. I left everything else alone.

My husband loved it. The cilantro added a great freshness to the taste. I will certainly make this again.

I didn't change anything, but the next time I make it I will.

I didn't notice any spice, so I will need yo kick it up. But not put in extra cilantro at the end. My husband was not to fond of it.

Used the leftover turkey from thanksgiving!  Made a stock from the carcass too!! I was sick of chili powder (already made a few chili powder recipes this fall) so I used taco spice.  Added a can of white beans & some chili peppers I had in the freezer. But otherwise followed the recipe pretty closly to the author's recommendations.  Like he said.... beats neverending turkey sandwiches! **Solid 4 stars**

This was very good.  I made it just like the recipe says but I boiled 3 turkey legs for my turkey meat.  So this can be made with out having to cook an entire turkey!! It has a very nice flavor.  I have a husband from Florida who like lots of flavor and kids who like none and I'm in the middle and we all liked it!

This was a great soup to make with left over Turkey Carcass (which I boiled, and then shredded the meat). I added a bit of siracha for extra heat. And did not add the cilantro, sour cream or cheese until right before I ate this. It was great - a nice change from regular turkey soup.

Good! I am not a cilantro lover so I omitted that and did half the amount of diced tomatoes as recommended by a previous reviewer. It is SO GOOD!

Made it exactly as written, wasn't too bad, could use a bit more flavour. Maybe more cumin next time. Great way to use up leftover turkey!!

Family and friends keep asking for this soup and the recipe. I make a turkey broth to use instead of water. As well always make a big batch of it for enjoyment during our long Canadian winter. Easy on the sodium. Thanks J. Berkhout

I used chicken stock instead of the water w/bullion and I used diced fire-roasted tomatoes for some kick and it was perfect.  I am considering making a batch for my work and my husband's.  Will definitely do this again next year - and, if I can't wait, I will use a pre-roasted chicken from my local grocery store.

I loved this recipe because it's just to easy. I had everything on hand except for black beans which I substituted with kidney beans. I did add more turkey just because I wanted to get ride of the left overs from Thanksgiving. Although I wish I didn't because it made it a little to thick for my liking and I'm not a huge fan of turkey to begin with. I also added extra garlic chili powder and cumin then called for. I actually didn't measure anything, just eyed it up. Turned out great! I didn't top it with anything and it was very tasty. Thank you for this recipe, a new way to get rid of Thanksgiving leftovers. I would make this again!

I made this soup for dinner last night - followed some recommendations and left out the tomato soup.  Added a squeeze of lime to each serving.  It was a great soup - I'm sure I'll make it again.  Everyone liked it last night and it was even better today.

I tried this recipe a year ago; it was amazing.  I am so glad I was able to find it again and this time, I am going to save it. I skipped the tortilla chips and the sour cream, it doesn't need it.

Love it.  I made it at Thanksgiving and used many fresh things from the garden - oregano, hot peppers, abd parsley - knowing that the days of having fresh food are numbered.  I also added a few fresh, chopped tomatoes.  Finally, I used turkey broth in place of the water and left out the boullion cubes.  The fresh hot peppers give it a real 'bite'.  I did not use the sour cream and certainly don't feel that it is necesary.  Other than that I followed the recipe and will use it again.

My husband loved this. I wasn't quite as impressed, but I think it was user error and not the fault of the recipe: I used defrosted leftover turkey in this soup, and I think it had just sat in the freezer too long and was past its prime. I want to try this again with fresh(er) turkey, because the flavor base was really, really nice. The cilantro and green salsa were a great combination.

THis soup is so delish, it is company worthy.   It has just the right amount of spiciness, and it is ver colorful!   I will look forward to having lots of turkey leftover so I can make it again.

This recipe was fantastic!  It was the perfect way to use some of the leftover turkey from thanksgiving.  It is really good (5 stars!) as is, but we have made some changes as well that we prefer.  We don't like whole onions, so we add 1/2 tsp onion powder with the other spices after browning the garlic with just a spray of olive oil.  We also used half garbonzo/half black beans and used 2 cans of corn rather than 2 cups of frozen.  I also added a little extra chili powder for a bit more spiciness and some chipotle seasoning. It's great as written, but even better with a couple of changes :)

This soup is such a great switch up from the usual post Thanksgiving fare! Of course, I didn't use bouillon, but instead boiled the turkey carcass with onion and celery and used the stock from that. And there was enough left over in a 12 pound turkey that I had to double the recipe. We loved it!

Delicious way to use leftover turkey.  I didn't use any of the toppings, but just made the soup as written, plus a little bit of pepper.

Loved this recipe.  My husband cut open an avacado that was not ready, so I added it to the soup near the end of cooking.  Great taste.

Excellent soup; great way to use up leftover turkey. Would be tasty with chicken as well.  I did not have cilantro or parsley on hand, and it was still yummy. We substituted fresh tomatoes for canned.  Delicious; I will definitely make it again!

This is the best kind of recipe, quick and easy and delicious.It was a great way to use leftover turkey, but I think it would be great as a vegetarian soup with extra beans.

Sooo good!! Wanted to use up some leftover turkey in freezer so cooked up a big pot of this.  I did sub tomato juice for the can of soup, and chicken broth for boullion, thinking sodium would be lower with both.  Hubs added a minced jalapeno, some carrot, and celery for more veggies.  Served over some tortilla chips and topped with shredded pepper jack cheese.  Yummy!!

A very delicious soup, full of flavour!  Instead of using the boullion cubes and 4 cups of water, I just used 4 cups of chicken broth.  This is my new favorite recipe for leftover turkey!

Made the recipe as is, it was pretty good.  My 2 and 3 year old liked it alot as did my husband.  Reheated for leftovers today and still felt like something was missing.  I added some Franks Red Hot Sauce and that was the missing ingredient!  Much nicer with a little heat!

Absolutely delicious. Made this several years ago for a progressive dinner & was a tremendous success. For extra spice I used Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles & medium salsa.

It wasn't too bad... I probably would make it again if I had a ton of turkey left over, but I wouldn't voluntarily make it otherwise.  I followed the direction almost exactly except I used turkey stock instead of water.  I am nursing, and my baby didn't handle it well at all.  She has been spitting up and super gassy ever since.  Was that too much info?  :)

Fabulous! I made a whole turkey breast and had a lot of meat leftover, so I decided to try this. I'm so glad I did! We are watching our salt intake, so instead of the boullion and water, I used 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth. Didn't have the salsa, so I chopped up 2 jalapenos and 1 hungarian wax pepper from my garden. Also from my garden, I used fresh oregano and parsely. Finally, to cut out the fat, I didn't use the sour cream, cheese, or chips. This soup was easy to make and tastes delicious! Thank you so much!

I did really like this soup; however, I'm not sure I'd give it a full five stars. It seemed a little lackluster and relied heavily on cilantro to carry the flavor.

Very good turkey soup.  I needed to use up leftover turkey and wasn't in the mood for traditional turkey soup.  This was a nice change of pace.  I doubled the black beans and felt that was perfect.  I would add more frozen corn next time.

I used turkey stock, boiled off the carcass with onion scraps, cumin, pepper and oregano leaves. I also used a 15 oz jar of corn and black bean salsa for the salsa portion. 14 oz can of diced tomatos and a jar of homemade tomatoes and jalepenos. I added a cup and a half of corn instead of 2 because of  the bb & c salsa, cup of mushrooms as well. I sauteed them with the onions, evoo, garlic and spices then added all the other ingredients adding the stock and turkey shreds last. Awesome!

This soup is AWESOME!!!!!!!!  I was a little skeptical at first, but had tons of leftover turkey to use up.  It takes a lot of turkey and all 6 members of my family LOVED it!  We didn't care for the sour cream on it though.  I also added half a pack of taco seasoning mix and doubled the chili powder.  I am definitely going to make this again!

Decided to do it all in the Crock Pot on low all day. Overall, it was good but somehow I still found it lacking a bit in flavour. I wonder if doing it the way the recipe states would have been more flavourful - I'll try it one day.

I cooked this tonight and typically dont measure things out exactly and tonight was not exception. Considering we love really hot food, I more than tripled the chili powder and threw in the remaining turkey that was left over from new yrs. Turned out to be one of the best dishes I have EVER cooked. My wife and I had two huge servings of it and on the second round I had a nice sweet winter ale that was the ultimate compliment. A very good recipe!   Has anyone tried this with different meat (usually only have turkey on the holidays)?

Very easy recipe. Made it just as written, but left out the corn only because my husband doesn't like corn. It had good flavor. Our soup was mild, but you could easily make it hotter by adding tabasco sauce or using med-hot salsa. Next time I will had the sour cream at the end of the cooking time. That is really the only thing I would do differently.If this soup gets to hot the sour cream will curdle. I will make this again. If I don't have turkey I will use chicken.

Awesome!  I used chicken instead of turkey, added rotini pasta and lots of extra spices.  Also added an entire jar of salsa (16oz) and left out the sour cream.  Terrific!

This soup was wonderful! I don't usually have any luck making soup, but this one was easy and tasted delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used less beans because my son doesn't really like beans. I did have to simmer it linger, closer to an hour, before it was hot enough to serve. I think next time I'll thaw the corn before adding it.

My husband kept on eating and eating with a few comments on  how good it was.  I was not able to make it with all the ingredients in this recipe but must of them I had.  I substituted the tomato soup for tomato sauce/paste and I added paprika.

This was easy and totally awesome.  We used five cubes and didn't add any broth and used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup.  Excellent!

I used both dark and white meat.  It just didn't seem to go with the Mexican seasonings.  I think possibly it was the use of the dark meat that made it non-compatible.

It really is a luscious soup.  But I highly recommend against adding the sour cream and cooking for 30 minutes.  It just curdles.  Add it at the end if you choose a more mellow flavor.

FABULOUS!  Best turkey soup.  I followed the recipe except I doubled the spices and used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes.  I also  served it with cornbread on top instead of the tortilla chips.  My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it at least once a month going forward.  Thanks to the person who originally submitted the recipe and to all the people who left ratings/reviews so I could judge whether I should try the recipe.  A definite keeper.

This was an awesome use of leftover turkey. I had it frozen and put it in the crockpot. I followed other's suggestions and used al chicken broth. I used Ranch Beans and added chopped green chilies. Definately a keeper!

I ate this soup for days afterward until it was completely gone. It was even better the second day too. I left out the cilantro though, we hate it in our house.

Super easy to make...and really easy to substitute ingredients.  I doubled the recipe and was out of some ingredients (and decided to spice it up a bit more!)...used Italian seasoning in lieu of oregano, a can of pureed tomato instead of one of the cans of tomato soup, used a can of Rotel rather than an additional cup of salsa, and garlic flavored diced tomatoes (so used no garlic).  I also added a teaspoon of pepper and sea salt, five dashes of Tobasco, a tablespoon of cayenne pepper (WOW!!!), an extra can of diced tomatoes and 50% more onions.  Topped it with suggested toppings, as well as sliced avacado.  I'm eating it now, and it's heavenly! Next time I'll use ground beef or chicken rather than turkey for a change...awesome recipe!

What a great way to use up leftover turkey.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon and I left out the sour cream and cilantro (didn't feel like making a trip to the store).  I served with with Tostitos Hint of Jalapeno chips, which complimented the soup perfectly.  Next time, I may use diced tomatoes with chilis to give the soup a little more heat.

This is absolutely fantasic! The changes I made was to increase the spices to 1 1/2 times the amounts called for, used chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon cubes, Rotel for the diced tomatoes, added a seeded and chopped jalapeno, and added an extra cup of the frozen corn. I also added avacado to my bowl upon serving. 4 cups of turkey is the perfect amount, and this would also be excellent made with a rotisserie chicken from the deli for a quick and hearty dish on a busy day.

This was amazing. The whole family loves it. I made a stock from the bones which added to flavor. Didn't have the tom soup but had V8 juice which worked fine (probably better.)! And didn't do beans cuz kids dont like them. Loaded up the turkey since I have so much leftover and it ate more like a stew than a soup. Oh and I thickened it a tiny bit with a quick wondra flour / water paste.  Tortilla strips were great!

This soup is yummy and filling. I used chicken broth instead of just plain water and I also added a large can of hominy for a little additional Southwestern flavor. A tasty way to use leftover turkey!

Great idea, but you will want to add more spices.  I doubled the spices, and used a small can of tomato paste instead of tomato soup and cut the water down to 3.5 cups.  I also used fire roasted diced tomatoes and fire roasted corn.  I added 1/4c of jalapenos for some heat.  Turned out perfectly.

WOW, you have to try this. I added one large jalapeno minced with seeds to add just a slight taste of heat to it. I also cubed the white meat and pulled the dark meat.

This was a great alternative to the traditional turkey carcass broth based soup after Thanksgiving.  I used mexican chili pepper, chili beans, didn't use the salsa, and mized the cilantro with the sour cream to top the soup.  This was soooo good!

Made this for the first time tonight and it was so good and easy! I followed the recipe and instructions pretty closely - the only changes were that I omitted beans b/c my family doesn't care for them and I put the soup in the crockpot on high for 2 hours before serving. Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe rocked. Even my six year old liked it. The blend of flavor was very good and there wasn't too much cilantro.

This was very tasty! I didn't have condensed tomato soup so in place of that and the 4 cups of water, I used 3 cups V-8 juice and 1 cup water. This is a keeper!

Made with leftover Thanksgiving turkey....I left out condensed tomato soup but did add a bit of leftover tomato sauce, reduced the water amount, and since DH can't eat dairy, left out sour cream.  We loved it!

Totally yummy! My two year old and my husband both raved over this dish. I did use homemade chicken broth I had in the freezer instead of water, and I used chicken since I had no turkey. Super delish!

One of the best soups I have ever made; I use turkey broth rather than bouillon cubes and leave out the tomato soup; otherwise, exactly as shown.  HOWEVER, I wanted to make it for my son who is allergic to poultry, so I made it with shredded PORK LOIN and veggie broth, and it was just as delicious.

This recipe is a great jumping off point. Based on other rewiews, I used less tomato soup and supplemented with chicken broth. The broth tasted great. But the thing that put it over the top was adding left over grilled turkey breast that had been seasoned with a jerk dry rub. It made the flavor so complex! No cilantro, but had a ripe avocado so cut that into chunks and enjoyed with cheese and tortilla chips. Delicious!!!

At first I was slightly worried that I wouldn't like the soup.  It obviously has a very strong tomato taste.  However, with all the toppings - it's truly excellent!  I didn't have any cilantro, so I just omitted it from the recipe.  Still good.  I also added in a dash of cayenne pepper and a sprinkle of hot sauce.  I still didn't think it had very much heat to it.  I'll have to add more next time.  This is definitely a keeper.

I loved this soup, but my husband thought it was too tomatoey and my kids did not like the cilantro.  I will make this again, but will use less tomatoes (maybe one small can instead of a large can) and leave the cilantro as an optional topping only.  I think it's a great way to use leftover turkey!

I thought this recipe was great.  I didnt add the tomato soup and added creamed corn instead of the regular corn the recipe had called for.  Because I added creamed corn I didn't need to add the sour cream to the soup, I only used it as a garnish.  I also added some hot sauce to give it a little extra kick and some taco seasoning for flavor.  Overall very good recipe and I will make this again!!

I tried this recipe last night...and followed the entire recipe to a "T".  It ended up tasting like a watered down turkey chili. So that's what I ended up turning it into...Just added a little more chili powder & cumin and thickened the broth a little. Nothing was wrong with the taste, I guess I expected it to taste more like a soup instead of a chili.

Normally, when I make something from All Recipes and after trying it for the first time I'm experiencing a tastebud explosion, I like to wait a few days before writing my review.  It's easy to make something that tastes great when it's right out of the oven, but making great leftovers is one of the lost arts of the kitchen.  This soup delivers both upfront and for the week afterwards.  I cut the measurements in half because it was just for myself, but now I'm wishing I would have gone with the supersized version.  It tastes better then any type of tortilla soup that I've had in a restaurant.    Every bit is plain delicious.  Other than scaling down the size of the recipe I made it exactly as it's listed.  Not sure about some of the other modification that people have made, but I think next time I'm going to include slice black olives.  Not sure why, but after eating a couple of bowls, I've been left craving this taste.  I won't say that it's better then turkey sandwiches because lets be honest, you can never have too many leftover turkey sandwiches, but it is a good way to repackage your leftovers into something quite remarkable.

Amazing Soup! Never again will I be at a loss on what to do with my left over turkey. You could make this with chicken, ground beef - anything. I loved the flavor. I made only a few minor changes. Left out tomato soup and added V8 juice instead. I also added taco seasoning - about a package. Adds wonderful flavor. Omited the chicken cubes and substituted chicken broth - just because that's all I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe. It's a definate keeper.

This was really good!  Not quite hot enough for our tastes.  Added 2 more tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Great way to use leftover turkey.  Will definitely make this again.

Outstanding recipe. Other than substituting Ancho powder for chili powder and fresh tomatoes for canned, I made it largely as written, but tasting it as it simmered, I felt it needed "more." Consequently, I used some additional ingredients and increased others. The changes exceeded what I have seen in written in any review. Consequently I submitted my version as "Tex-Mex Turkey Soup II" citing this recipe as the inspiration.

LOVED IT!  I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I didn't add cheese or sour cream at the end.  We just added a tbsp before serving.  I did increase the chili powder and cumin because we like it a little spicier.  I think it makes more like 8 servings.  With just me and my hubby eating we had it for 3 meals each with seconds for both of us!  It was very tasty.  I have some more turkey in the freezer that I will be using again for this recipe!

Excellent! I did what other reviewers have done and just dumped all the ingredients in the crockpot. I like my food spicy so used hot chili powder. I didn't have any corn, and am eating a lower carb diet, so I just left it out. I used a tetra pack of chicken broth, and one packet of chicken bouillion, but no water. I added the sour cream, cheese and cilantro to my bowl, but I like it just as much without so won't bother with the added things at the end next time. It turned out great - I'll definitely make again - I think it would be good with other leftover meat such as chicken too.

Great recipe - my husband and I enjoyed it with some leftover turkey plus some cooked chicken (didn't quite have enough turkey).  Very good on a cold winter day in Michigan.  We don't like spice so we left out the chili powder.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  We loved it but next time we'll make it for company because it makes A LOT!
