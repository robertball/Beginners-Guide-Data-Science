This is amazing!! I made a couple changes though, didn’t add the (mixed herbs) just added bacon and about 3 or 4 slices of velveeta cheese slices and then to top it off I added cayenne powder to make it nice and spicy. Definitely keeping this recipe. Only wish it made more only made enough for two people. I’ll double up next time.

I made it, doubled it, and used regular pasta for my boyfriend and cauliflower for me. Super easy to make extra for those not following your eating plan too!

After seeing a similar recipe on a web site that drove me crazy with ads and the irrelevant history of anyone who'd ever touched a spatula popping up, I thought I'd return to my favorite recipe website. I did use this recipe, with a few changes. I didn't have "mixed herbs", I added bacon, some Velveeta and used a crushed pork rind topping. (Hey, the Velveeta needed to go SOMEWHERE!) I'd eat a lot more veggies if they were prepared like this! :)

I didn't care for it. It was very soupy. I ended up pureeing it, adding some cooked crumbled bacon, and made it edible, but won't make again. Also, I thought it was a bit salty. I didn't even put in the amount called for in the recipe, but still salty.

Loved it. I added ground pork and it increased my protein and fat for the meal and made it even better.

Didn't even get close to being a mac & cheese but it wasn't bad. It was one of the dishes that i thought was not good at all the next day.

It was okay - I added some extra veggies and ground (soy) beef to make it more of a main dish. But I think it was the mix of flavors that wasn't really my thing. Maybe the nutmeg? Not sure but the spice mix was odd.

I enjoyed this quite a bit, but I'm docking it a star for how salty it was. Next time I'll cut the salt in half at least. But I'll definitely make it again.

Before putting it in the oven, I put cheese on top. My wife loved it, and one of our picky eaters also loved it. Will definitely make it again.

This was just ok to me.  An upped version of side of roasted cauliflower and cheese to me.  Tasty, but kinda plain as a main vegetarian dish.  Maybe if I was really craving Mac 'n' cheese I might be more excited about it.

This was ok. Was hoping for a creamier cheese sauce. This sauce was a bit oily with cheddar cheese, so I might try a different kind next time.

Wow! So yummy! It made enough for two of us, and I’d have happily eaten another whole bowl!
The only modification I did was to add a little velveeta to the sauce, and replace the herbs with cayenne. Deeeelish! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great way to eat cauliflower which I normally find boring. Did not use cream -just used some milk. Used butter instead of ghee.

This was very tasty. I did not have heavy cream so I substituted coconut milk and added about another cup of cheddar cheese along with a teaspoon of cornstarch.

I loved everything about this recipe! It was super easy with great flavor with the seasonings I chose.  Even my husband liked the flavor & he’s not one for trying new things.  The cheese sauce was so good that my husband wants me to make it for other dishes we have.  I will definitely be making the recipe & also the cheese sauce again!

I followed the recipe as directed without making any changes to the original recipe. It turned out well and tasted yummy. It was just "ok" as a recipe. I think I expected more based on other reviews. Everyone enjoyed it. I would likely make again in a few months.

Didn't have nutmeg, so didn't use that. But I used everything else and it was delicious.  I've never eaten cauliflower and could never stand the smell of it. This recipe is great!

Followed as written but used regular butter.  Texture was good, flavour also good.  Would definitely make again.

Great for the Keto diet! Even my kids liked it. I think next time I will try mixing cheddar with provolone.

It isn't quite MacNCheese, but it is good.  I made the recipe just as it is written and we all liked it a lot.  Not sure I'd call it a main dish, but it would  make a good, hearty side.

Used this as a base trying to knock off a delicious version I had at the Wild Sea Oyster Bar & Grille.



Used coconut milk and added quinoa as a thickening agent.

Not sure when I'll make it again, maybe way out, because with all the cheese it is a lot of calories.
