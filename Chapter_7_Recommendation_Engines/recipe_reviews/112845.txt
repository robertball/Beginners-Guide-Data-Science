Super good recipe and definitely worth your while.  I didn't have any craisins, so I coursely chopped a cup or so of fresh cranberries, added 2 - 3 TBS of white sugar and put in the microwave for 30 seconds, then added to the dry ingredients, and it worked just fine.  I was low on some other ingredients too, so I borrowed several ideas from the reviewers, used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, didn't have orange zest, so used 3/4 c orange juice and 1/4 milk, substituted butter for the shortening.  Also made the glaze from Ann's review, orange juice and powdered sugar, which was the perfect finishing touch for us.  One more thing was I reduced the amount of wheat germ to a 1/4 cup and added a 1/4 of ground flax seed and I couldn't tell the difference.  Will definitely make again and maybe try other berries and juice combinations like possibly blueberry and lemon.

I rarely give 5 stars.  When a recipe is pretty darned good and worth repeating, I'll give it 4 stars. This recipe I would give even more than 5 stars!  It is a simple recipe that yields really spectacular flavor and texture.  I did not have OJ, so I used more milk.  I didn't have orange zest, so I used 2 Tbs of orange extract, which was more than plenty.  I also used the orange-essence dried cranberries.  I did substitute wheat bran for the wheat germ, and opted for 1/2 white flour 1/2 whole wheat flour.  The texture was fantastic, flavor wonderful.  Delicious with honey butter.

absolutely delicious!!  i made this just this last week and took them to school everyday to have as a snack before lunch.  these scones really stick w/ you.  i made only slight modifications to the recipe.  i did use real butter instead of shortening (smart balance butter blend sticks also work well).  i also used fresh cranberries (chopped and tossed w/ some sugar).  they are great fresh out of the oven, and even better the next day.  i also tried a lemon blueberry version, which are outstanding!  i used 6oz fresh blueberries, 1/4 c lemon juice (in place of orange), 1-2 Tbsp lemon zest, and used cinnamon (about 1 or 1 1/2 tsp) instead of nutmeg.  this recipe is a definite keeper!

These are amazing. I substituted applesauce for the shortening and used whole wheat pastry flower. I have no gilt for indulging in my favorite treat. The 4tsp. of baking powder give it a true biscuit taste along with the Pastry flour being lighter then reg. whole wheat. A new staple. I am looking to expand with other ingredients.Skip the butter on top. They remain moist at least until the next day (if they last that long) and they are pretty much fat free. For a scone that is amazing in itself.

This recipe is fantastic and easy.  I exchanged the wheat germ for unprocessed bran and drizzled them with icing made from fresh squeezed orange juice and confectionary sugar.

A little on the dry side but of course you're going to expect it from the www/wheat germ. But these healthy scones has potential. All I need is a healthy spread or icing.

I did not think it was possible to have another scone recipe, but because we love cranberries so much just had to have this one.  Did make some changes (to suit my taste) - substituted 1/2 cup white flour for the wholewheat and used 1/2 butter rather than all shortening. Probably not as healthy but good anyway.

I followed almost exactly, Couple of days before I put zest in sugar thinking it would "candy", I think it just added a little more sugar to the mix. I ground my own flour (1st time) and because of this my dough was pretty sticky but I managed to cut and get them on the pan, mine seem more like a cookie than scone, I like how they turned out. Thank you for a great recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ and butter instead of shortening. Very grainy, healthy texture, and they aren't loaded with sugar. Just be careful not to overcook them--they may get dry.  Mine only took 6 minutes in the oven.

I made quite a few changes, but they were really yummy.  I thought using all whole wheat would be too heavy (although I should try it and see!) but I used 1 cup AP flour and the rest whole wheat. My wheat germ was bad so I used ground flax seed, and I subbed sour cream for most of the milk since I had a lot. I used half butter/half shortening and threw in a bit of coconut oil and also added some protein powder for good measure.  I made a glaze like some suggested with OJ and powdered sugar and they were super good... without the glaze I think they would need some butter or something.  I also didn't roll them out I just spooned them out like big cookies.   But I LOVE cranberry orange scones and this was a nice healthier take on them!

These are pretty good.  I didn't have a round muffin cutter, so I used a cookie cutter shaped like a big candy corn (a triangle really).  Next time I think I will shape by hand so they look more appealing.  Just a tad bitter from the orange zest.  Next time I think I will use just a little more orange juice and add a touch more brown sugar.  Good healthy recipe though!

This is the first time I ever purchased wheat germ, so I was hoping that I hadn't wasted my money.  My whole family ate these with out the usual fussing about "what is in this?".  I also tried it with orange flavored cranberries.  I didn't have orange juice at home, but just squeezed out the juice of 1/2 of a large orange as I needed to use an orange for the zest. I also added cinnamon.  Never can have too much cinnamon!

My husband and I loved the cranberry & orange flavor of these scones.  We're also trying to eat a little healthier. Having said that, we found these incredibly dry (probably due to the whole wheat flour and wheat germ).  Smothered in butter and jam these were just o.k. teatime treats.  My 20 month old however loved the scones and excitedly says, "muffins, muffins!" everytime he sees them :)  Would try again with maybe 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.

These scones are made for whole wheat flour and thus give a nice consistency and taste. They are crisper than many scone recipes, so some may want a lighter scone. We liked 'em.

I did half white flour, half whole wheat as others suggested.  Also added a glaze (powdered sugar with orange juice) which I think they needed for sweetness.  Delish!

I'll definitely make these again.  I used fresh cranberries so that made it a little bit tart so next time, I'll add a bit of white sugar with the fresh berries.  I used a food processor to mix the shortening to the dry ingredients & then used the processor to rough chop my cranberries.  As soon as I pulled them off the baking sheet I had to snag one, add butter and savor with a cup of tea.  Wonderful on a cold winter morning.

I replaced 1 cup of the wheat for unbleached all purpose flour and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  They were delicious!  I also patted the dough into circles and cut the scones into wedges.

These scones have so much potential! This was my first time trying this recipe. I really liked the flavor, but I want to work on a better texture, as they were a bit dry.**  **I changed from 4 stars to 2 because after a day these were like eating cardboard. Bummer.

I have made these 3 times according to the recipe given, and each time they were wonderful. I gave one batch away and got rave reviews. It helps that it is such a healthy recipe. I did use parchment paper in lieu of greasing the pan, but that was just my preference.

Less orange zest (too bitter) and I would add more orange juice, hint of cinnamon and hint of lemon extract.

Also a note...make 2 small circles to make smaller scones. One circle made the "triangles" too large, and  be sure to place far apart, they grow!

I found the dough way too sticky - had to add more flour, and that ended up making the scones bland and dry. The only nice thing was the combination of cranberry and orange flavours. Not making it again.

Perfect! I used half oat flour/half regular flour and omitted the nutmeg. These are better than the ones I love at Starbucks. Can't stop eating them is the only problem.
