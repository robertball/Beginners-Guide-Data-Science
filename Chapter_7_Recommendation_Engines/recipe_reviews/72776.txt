OH my heavens...this pie was wonderful!!!  Many times when I get half way through my piece of rhubarb pie it kinda tastes floury and i get tired of eating it.  But the sour cream just made it wonderful and kinda cheese-cakey!  My mom and sister said it was the best rhubarb pie they've ever tasted.  We've tried many different recipies and this is by far our favorite!

This was a delicious sweet and convenient pie. I was looking for a rhubarb pie recipe using lots of rhubarb to use up the one I was given, but didn't want it to be double-crusted... I came across this recipe and tried it without real hopes (it was not yet rated at that time)... but when I tasted it... Oh my!!! Everything makes it excellent: its look, its texture, its taste (excellent balance between tartness and sweetness). I think it's gonna be my standard rhubarb pie recipe. Thanks a lot for sharing.

Oh dear heavens.  This is wonderful.  I am sooo glad I found this recipe!  I took my frozen rhubarb out to thaw at lunchtime so I would be ready to go when I came home from work.  I added some strawberries since I didn't have enough rhubarb - also reduced the sugar to 1 cup as others suggested (thank you for that) - and added a touch of cinnamon both to the sour cream mixture and to the crumb topping.  Boy oh boy, if you love sweets made with rhubarb, you gotta try this!  Thank you so much for posting the recipe! It's a really pretty pie!

YUM! Easy to make. The only thing I did different, I put in 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/2, seemed sweet enough for us!
Also, I used a frozen deep dish crust, filled it w/the sliced rhubarb. It did not take 4 full cups. I ended up baking it about 15 minutes longer, seemed too wiggly at time. Family and guests ate it up!

Outstanding recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving with frozen rhubarb and it turned out great. Not a crumb left, and my family wanted more. I'd make this again in a heartbeat. Thank you!!

I have searched for an easy but tasty rhubarb pie for years.  Nothing ever compares with mom's rhubarb cream pie, but this pie is really delicious and is restaurant quality.  Very professional presentation.  I will make this again and again.  I did not make any ingredient changes.  Thank you so much for posting this great recipe.

Excellent blend of flavors!  I cut back the sugar and added some cinnamon, but otherwise, left the recipe as is.  I had rhubarb, filling and topping left over as well as some pie tops, so I made some turnovers with the reminaing ingredients.  Fantastic!

When i was a girl i had tried to make a rhubarb pie, and lets just say it did not turn out.  This pie was not only easy it turned out fantastic!! Becareful not to over fill the crust is my only suggestion.

I really dislike giving negative reviews but I truly did not care for this pie. When I saw the recipe (different from any kind of rhubarb pie I've ever made) and all the positive reviews, I was really anxious to try it. I thought the rhubarb got lost among all the other ingredients. In a rhubarb pie, I think the rhubarb should shine as the dominant ingredient. I'll stick with traditional rhubarb pie. Thank you for posting the recipe. Many other people on this site do enjoy it.

I made this pie using frozen rhubarb and I am very glad that I used all the sugar.  Fresh rhubarb is much sweeter and doesn't require as much.  Be sure to taste it and adjust the sugar.  Awesome recipe.  I don't like rhubarh and I loved this pie.  Yummy.  Will be making it again.

OH MY GOSH THIS IS SO GOOD!! So I have made this now about 4 times in less than 10 days b/c we keep going to BBQ's or parties and this is a hit everytime. It only lasts a few minutes. So I made a couple changes. I wanted this dish to be bigger, so I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it and made my own pie dough to place in the bottom of a 9x13 pan. then the only thing i changed was add one extra tablespoon of butter and 1/2 cup of instant oats. it ends up more like a cobbler but still just as good. My friends who don't even like rhbarb, love this recipe. thank you for sharing it with us!

I made this with 2 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries, then poured the sour cream mixture over it.  I also added some oats to the crumble topping for more texture.  It was delicious!!  All of the guests said it was the best rhubarb pie they had ever had!

This is great.  Different than your standard Rhubarb Pie.  This will be the only way that I make Rhubarb Pie now.  So easy to make this.  Update: 7/8/09- Went to make this a few weeks ago and discovered that I didn't quite have 1 cup of sour cream so I used 1/2 cup vanilla flavored yogurt and came out great.  For the topping, I only use 2T butter and use 1/2 flour + 1/2 oats.  There is no tweaking necessary but I feel better about eating a huge piece knowing that I made it a little less fattening...And yes, this is still the only way that I make anything with rhubarb.

Yum! This pie was so good. My only complaint is that I don't make my own pie crusts so I just went with a graham cracker crust (which was delish) but it wasn't deep enough, so I had leftover rhubarb. It was good when it was warm, but in my opinion, even better after being chilled.

This is heaven . You can serve this to anyone & I'm sure they will be asking for the recipe.  You do want to make sure that you cook it in a DEEP dish pie plate. Besides being delicious it is very quick & so easy to put together. It does take an hour to bake but that gives you time to get the rest of your meal together."Enjoy "

Excellent! It was just as described. I had to bake it 15 min. longer as I used frozen rhubarb. I covered the crust the last 15 minutes so the crust wouldn't get too brown. I'm looking forward to makeing this pie next year with fresh rhubarb! My coffee group loved it.
(even the guy who doesn't like rhubarb had 2 pieces.)

I think this might have been the best and most impressive pie I have ever made.  It comes together much more easily than it appears.  The only issue with this is that you really need more like 3 cups of rhubarb, not 4 (unless you use a deep dish pie--I used a regular 9in frozen pie crust, which worked great).  Be sure to bake this on a cookie sheet--mine overflowed just slightly.  

Either way, this got rave reviews.  So much better than plain old strawberry rhubarb!  YUM!!!!

Phenomenal recipe.  So tasty.  I did not have a pie crust available and so I used a graham crumb crust instead.  Worked just great.  But definitly will use regular crust next time.

I made this without the pie crust. I used plain Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream, added vanilla extract and reduced the white sugar to 1 cup. For the top, I subbed half the flour for oats and only used 2 tbps cold butter cut in to small pieces. Really great recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent.  I only had a storebought graham cracker crust on hand and it worked fine (and reminded me of a cheesecake), but keep in mind it adds an extra element of sweetness.  Next time I want to reduce the other sugars to compensate for this substitution.  The pie does puff up so expect some spillover if you're using a 9" pie plate.

Oh, my this was the yummiest pie ever!  The sour cream really smooothed out the bitterness!  The pic I took, is prior to baking, and it was even beautiful!

This is a good recipe for Rhubarb Pie.  My family always makes a custard type pie, but I was looking for something slightly different since one of my daughters doesn't care for the custard pie.  This was easy to make and tastes very good.  I enjoyed it most when it was chilled.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and didn't think it needed any changes.

Pretty amazing.  I added more rhubarb than it called for and it took a little more in the oven, but it was worth it.  My mother in law LOVED it.

This is a really good pie. However, it is extremely sweet. I think the next time I will add less sugar and maybe not use about 1/2 of the brown sugar topping.

I sure am happy that I froze 20 quarts of rhubarb this year because this pie , which was short lived in my house, will taste mighty good come those cold months up here in the North County..If you want to impress someone this is a pie that will fill the bill...I did lighten up on the sugar a bit...Other than that-----Excellent......

This is great.  I substituted splenda for the sugar and brown sugar splenda for the brown sugar.  It was fantastic - no one could tell it was made with splenda and everyone raved about it, even those who don't usually care for rhubarb

Excellent rhubarb pie recipe. I have made this several times and it doesn't last long.  I also agree with other reviewers that it is a great combination and there is no need for tweeking.

This is a wonderful pie.  My whole family loved it.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great.  We had a couple of pieces leftover.  I put them in the fridge. Hubby said it is even better after setting in the fridge all night.  This is definitely going in the recipe box as a keeper!

Wonderful pie!  I cut out 1/2 c of the sugar and am glad I did--it had the perfect amount of tart and sweet.  Bf loved the pie and said he'd eat some more.  ;o)  Very easy, and a nice variation on the strawberry rhubarb pie I had growing up.  I was out of strawberries so went searching in my recipe box and found this.  I'll probably make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Use less sugar double and put in 9x13 pan.  I also have added a cup or so of strawberries. Yummy, get lots of complements.

Based on previous reviews, I decided to make this recipe.  I do not like my rhubarb sweet , so I only added 1 cup of sugar.  The sweetness/tartness was perfect.  Since some reviews mentioned that there was over spill, I decided to add just a tsp of corn starch to the mixture and to place a cookie sheet underneath the pie pan.  There was no spillage.  I would make this recipe again.

This is a wonderful recipe, very delicious.  I noticed in other reviews that there were comments on how the pie was runny.  I made it once with flour and it was runny, then I made a pie for my son that can't have gluten, and added cornstarch instead.  The pie was much better with the same amount of cornstarch, not runny at all.

An all-time favorite at my house. I follow the recipe and it turns out perfect every time (which is about 5 times this summer). I do bake it about 10-15 minutes longer at 350 degrees. I'm so glad I found this recipe.

Based on the other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and liked the results, perfect amount of sweetness tartness in my opinion.  I've tried lots of rhubarb pie recipes and this one really stood out. My whole family raved about this pie. From now on this is the only rhubarb pie recipe I make. Next time I will try adding a little bit of lemon extract.

I have made this recipe oodles of times and it gets RAVE reviews.  It is RESTAURANT quality.  You can, with confidence, use Pillsbury Refrigerated Pie Crust (I do not recommend using any other prepared crust, from my own experience)  and you will be ALWAYS asked for your special crust recipe!  Follow this recipe exactly for RAVE reviews from your eating audience.  5 STARS, HOORAY!!!!

This was awesome.  I made two pies.  Followed the directions exactly.  They did turn out a little soupy but that could be due to the water content in the rhubarb.  We picked it and used it in the same day.

Excellent recipe!  Followed advice of other users and used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5, and also used light sour cream - still delicious!  Will be making this again very soon!

This was a decent pie, but I missed the sharp pungent taste of rhubarb.  The sour cream mellowed it out too much.  I think I'll stick with a straight up rhubarb pie.

This is a good custard rhubarb pie.  I've made it several times and it has always turned out great.  I prefer it without the crumb topping but it is tasty both ways.  When I remember I add a dash of cinnamon on top.

Phenomenal! Everyone I told that I was making rhubarb sour cream pie gave me a look of concern... but I proved all of the skeptics wrong. This pie was delicious. I will make it again with rhubarb and other fruits!

Many thanks for this recipe, I did use mascapone instead of sour cream but the same amount of sugar which was fine for me, but may be a bit too sweet for others so when using marscapone I will decrease the amount of sugar a little. The taste of the rhubarb permeates the filling but in turn rhubarb isn't drowned by the filling. Gorgeous pudding which I can't wait to make again.

Question: I have never made this pie before. I have however tasted it. It was a perrenial favourite @ the nursing home where I use to work. My son has requested Strawberry-rhubarb pie for Thanksgiving. Can I modify this recipe to use the strawberry-rhubarb mix?

Just had to throw another 5-star review since I had an old printed off copy of this recipe that I just came across today in my file and remembered how much my father-in-law loved it last time I made it... And today it's the featured recipe, so I had to comment :) but YES, we all ate this pie until we were stuffed sick. It's yummy and very rich.

This was good. I screwed up on the crust, but that certainly isn't the fault of this recipe. The sour cream custard was very nice and balanced the tartness of the rhubarb.

I'm personally not a rhubarb fan but this is my boyfriend's favorite dessert so I hunted out a recipe that I might like too. This one has just the right amount of creaminess to mask the rhubarb texture...delicous!

This pie was really, really good and refreshing. Plain rhubarb can sometimes be to much but the sour cream really rounds out the flavor. My dad devoured it and he hates sour cream. Of course I didn't tell him it was in there ;)

This is an excellent recipe that my mother and I used for years.  We usually make it with sliced strawberries, 1 cup sugar and cinnamon and two crusts.  Never have any left.  And the rhubarb is equally good.

I am always looking for a way to use rhubarb. So I made this pie with great hopes.  This pie was way too sweet. I really missed the tartness of the rhubard. Probably won't make it again.

This is great!  When I feel like a dessert I will make some, keep a portion and then take the rest to work.  I am considering keeping this pie for myself.   For the white sugar switched 1/2 to Splenda and 1/2 of the flour used whole wheat flour; and used light-fat sour cream.  No problems in puffing up.  Will make again and convert some of the sour cream to yogurt and drop some of the sugar to up the rhurbarb tang.

Excellent Recipe!

I have tested many variations at different times. 

Peach crisp:
Substitue rhubarb for peaches, 1.5C of white sugar for 1C of brown sugar.  Pie crust optional.

This is sooo delicous. I found measurements were a little off. I could not fit that much rhubarb in my pie crust and I had quite a lot of toppings left over. I used 1 cup strawberries and 1 cup rhubarb. it was lovely

We joined a farm produce co-op for the summer and I was searching for an easy rhubarb recipe.  This was the first one I tried and after tasting this my husband told me my search is over.  This is just as delicious warm with vanilla ice cream as it is cold.  Delicious as written.

This was delicious. I subbed Greek-style strained fat-free yogurt for the sour cream and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup as suggested by some reviewers...it was YUMMY! Also used No Fail Pie Crust III from this site.

My pie is actually still baking, but I used a deep dish pie crust and only 3 cups of rhubarb and my pie was overflowing! Hopefully it'll turn out ok anyway, becuase it sounds fantastic. I'll edit after I've tasted it.

EDIT: The pie was good, but maybe a bit too sweet. I would reduce the sugar next time.

This is a great recipe! The pie is really delicious!

We were a little short on ingredients, so we used a half cup of fat-free sour cream and a half cup of fat-free vanilla yogurt in place of the one cup sour cream.  We used only half the sugar because the yogurt was a little sweet on its own.  Because we like really full pies, we also added some strawberries in addition to the rhubarb.

We made a second pie without the crumb topping and it was awesome too!

This is an awesome pie recipe. I used it for rhubarb alone and then with rhubarb & peaches, then rhubarb & strawberries. Easy to make and produces a pretty pie. I used a little more flour for crumble topping and a little less sugar for fruit.

I didn't have a pie crust, and no time to make one, so I made this as a cobbler. It is fantastic.  Even a very sour rhubarb makes a tart but not sour pie.  Thanks

This was delicious. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of a cup and a half, and sprinkled a little cinnamon on the top for a little holiday flavor. I used 3 cups of frozen rhubarb (before thawing) and added some halved black cherries since I had them on hand and it turned out perfect. YUM!

Very good. I used a store bought crust and frozen rhubarb (thawed) and it still had a flaky crust and wasn't runny at all.

This turned out PERFECT! I sprinkled it with a bit of cinnamon and it was absolutely delicious. I used a little less white sugar because I LOVE the tartness of rhubarb, but I understand why others add it. Anyway, it’s an amazing pie perfect for any occasion.

This was delicious. 
The bottom was quite soggy however. I think  I will prebake the empty crust for 10 minutes before adding the rhubarb etc.
Also, the topping was a paste rather than crumbly. I will soften the butter but not melt it hereafter.

I made this for my mom who gets itchy if she eats Gluten, so I made it with a Gluten Free Ready Made Pie Crust in the Gluten Free Freezer Isle and bought Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour (used just like regular flour).  It was soooo delicious.  I used about 1/2 cup extra Rhubarb so it wouldn't be too sweet.  My husband cut up all the Rhubarb from my brother-in-laws garden.  He couldn't wait for his pie made as the recipe, except for extra rhubarb I added.  He also loved it.  This is the first time I ever baked a gluten free pie.

I did make some changes:   I use 3 tbsp minute tapioca instead of flour in filling; also use plain yogurt or vanilla yogurt in place of sour cream, and add 1 tsp vanilla.
Love the original recipe, but I always like to tweak recipes.

The pie was good but I wasn't a big fan of the topping.  It got very hard.  It'll be alright with some ice cream on top though, I think.

This is a good recipe.  I used less sugar because I love the tartness of rhubarb but next time I'd like to try adding some cream cheese to balance out the sourness and make it creamier.

I have made this pie at least 2 dozen times. It is my favorite rhubarb dessert. These adjustments work for my tastes:  I use 1 cup plus 2 tbsp. sugar instead of 1 1/2 cup. I add an additional 1 tbsp. flour to the 1/3 cup for the filling.  I add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the streusel topping. I bake a bit longer than stated (sorry I don't know exactly how long but at least an additional 5 minutes). The additional flour and additional bake time gives the interior a firmer, more cheesecake-like interior. I always cover it loosely with aluminum foil near the end to keep the top from getting too brown with the additional bake time.

I used only 1 cup sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. What a delicious combination of flavors, and the texture is very pleasing. I will definitely make this pie again!

This is absolutely amazing. There was too much filling for a 9" deep dish store bought crust. I did add zest from one orange and a tablespoon of the juice just because I like that rhubarb/orange flavor blend. Wow so tasty and easy. Next time I want to do what other reviewers suggest and double this with a graham crust in a 9x13 pan. Thank you for this awesome recipe.

This was excellent!  Hubby and friends have asked me to make it again.  I did cut the sugar back to 1 cup.  The volume of ingredients  was off a bit so I might adjust that next time but the taste was amazing.  I used a deep dish pie shell and only needed about 3 cups of rhubarb.  Also, the sour creme mixture over the 3 cups of rhubarb filled it right to be brim so that it spilled over while cooking.  That was ok because it made the crust chewy and yummy, but when I took it out of the oven there was a huge air bubble in the middle that collapsed when it cooled.  All of that was perfectly fine for my home pie, but if I was taking it somewhere I would use a little less filling to make a better presentation.  Will definitely make this lots!

Followed the recipe as posted. Our family found it to be too sweet for our taste. Will try this again but decrease the sugar content by half. Very nice texture, more like a rubarb crisp look when served. It did not hold the form of a piece of pie.
That is why we only gave it a 4 star.

Taste was fine but pie was runny not staying together very well even when refrigerated. Guess I am just a lover of the Rhubarb Custard pie instead

Had to do some tweaking, but it was delicious.  My pie plates were not deep enough so divided up the rhubarb between 2 pies.  Also substituted all sugar with raw brown sugar (also reduced the amount by 1/3.

I’m making it for the 3rd time in the last month. Today it is with fresh rhubarb (rather than frozen from last summer). I have followed the recipe exactly but now I reduce the sugar to 1 cup which is plenty. Also, I have added 2 cups of fresh strawberries without reducing the rhubarb. I think the addition of the strawberries makes it perfect! A definite 5.

This is so delicious!!  I love it cold with whipped cream on top!  I will stick with this recipe!  
My only complaint is that it overfilled my (store bought, frozen) pie crust. But a little foil underneath solves that problem!

YUMMY-YUMMY in the tummy! Even family who claimed to hate rhubarb LOVED this pie. I did add cinnamon & nutmeg to the filling and topping and that was the only change/addition I made. Try it...You'll love it!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I'm just glad that pie shells are sold in two's because there was enough filling and topping for two magnificent pies.  I added cinnamon to the custard mix and might add a bit of vanilla next time...and there WILL be a next time!

My family went bazerk over this! It tastes just like a more complicated pie my grandma used to make. Now the relatives are requesting it for every gathering! My ONLY tweak is that since it overflowed for me, I don't use ALL of the sour cream mix. I end up leaving about a quarter cup or less out. Thanks for the winner!!!

Made  this  pie exactly as written  and it turned out terrible .It had the consistantcy of paste.  Did not have much rhubarb taste. Pie went into the garbage. Could not eat. Obviously will not make again!

I think this is the best pie I've ever made!  I must free up some freezer space  and get busy to assure  availability of rhubarb all year around.  The only modification to the recipe I made was to add a bit more rhubarb  (I used about 6 cups instead of 4).

OMG! This pie is awesome. Mine looks less attractive, but is definitely one of the best pies I've ever done or had. I use Paula Deen's recipe for pie crust and just replaced sour cream with thick natural yoghurt. Fabulous.

I threw this to gather with fresh rhubarb and the taste was great but the pie crust got soggy from to much juice. Would make it again.

I made it according to recipe.  My only comment is that you better love the taste of sour cream because it really shines through.  It was a very easy recipe but since I do not care for sour cream, to me it was not that great.  I wish I could find a substitute for the sour cream because everything else about this pie was great.  So easy to make and a beautiful presentation.......but sour cream.......not so much.

I made some changes due to lack of ingredients (used just dark muscovado for anything requiring sugar, and wholewheat flour for the white flour).
Despite the shortcomings, the resulting pie was quite tasty.
I give it 5 stars as it seems to be a fool proof recipe ;) Trust me.

Excellent pie! My all-time favorite rhubarb pie is the rhubarb custard from the 1950's Betty Crocker cookbook. This one is different, but is much easier, and also tastes great!

I used closer to 5 cups of rhubarb (which fit nicely into a 10 inch pie plate), then followed the rest of the recipe as written. The recipe says to wait until it cools to cut and eat it, but of course warm pie is awesome, so we had a piece before it cooled completely. It was good, but the sour cream was the predominant flavor. Once it had cooled overnight, the sour cream flavor was much less evident, and the rhubarb flavor shone through.

The topping is a nice addition and is much lighter than some desserts. It was nice and crisp and delicious! I have 4 rhubarb plants and am always looking for good recipes. This one is definitely a keeper!

I deleted 1/2 cup of the white  sugar because we are not "sweet" eaters.  It was great, we both went back for seconds.  Making it again tonight

I followed the recipe exactly as written using thawed frozen rhubarb and the pie was absolutely delicious! My kids had never had rhubarb before and weren't sure what to expect, but loved it. And, it was really easy to make too. I will definitely make this again.

My husband loves rhubarb pie and so I was hesitant to try something other than the standard pie recipe, but I made this yesterday and he LOVED it.  I've been instructed to replace my old recipe with this one.  I only made one slight change and used about 1/4 less sugar.

Yum! Didn't read it all through and did top and bottom crusts already as I knew I was making a pie, so can't comment on crumb topping. Didn't have sour cream, so used 1 cup Greek yogurt instead. Cut the sugar down to 1 cup per other reviews. Very good slightly creamy pie. Served warm with ice cream and was a hit with our company. Will make again.

i love this pie and my husband who hates rhubarb really loved this. I added a little cinnamon to the sour cream mixture and cinnamon and a little nutmeg to the topping. To prevent spill over I use a 10 inch pie plate. I also substituted Splenda for the sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

I have never made a rhubarb pie before...mainly because I'm the only one that likes rhubarb in our house! This recipe changed everyone's minds...it was an instant hit! My husband does not care for rhubarb, and when he heard there weren't any strawberries in the pie, he almost didn't try any. After the first bite, he said it was the best pie he's had in a long time! I am excited to make this simple pie recipe again. I only used 1 cup of white sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups) and I added a little cinnamon, like another reviewer had posted. It tasted like a tart apple pie...delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I used a bit less sugar than they called for and it was still plenty sweet. Also, I cooked mine for 10 extra minutes because I used 5 cups of rhubarb instead of 4. Lastly, I added a tsp of vanilla to the egg/sugar/flour/sour cream mixture for a little more flavor. We all loved this pie!

DEE licious.  Except for reducing the sugar as others did, partly because my pie shell was a bit smaller than average and I had slightly less than the required rhubarb.  But wow is this pie great!!!
The only thing I will likely do next time is to prebake the crust a bit before adding the ingredients.

Yum! This creamy version of rhubarb pie kept the rhubarb nice and tart without the overpowering pucker power that can sometimes accompany rhubarb recipes. I used the fried pie crust recipe that has coconut in it and boy was that a nice twist for this pie! I highly recommend it and will be making another to take to work for sharing!

Fantastic pie!  I used a quiche pan and added more rhubarb and a bit more flour.  Using one egg is perfect as it is more creamy and less like a custard.

This is an excellent pie. I've gotten nothing but rave reviews after baking it. I only made minor changes - I see that most the reviews cut back on the sugar which I definitely understand - if you are a rhubarb liker/lover. I myself am not a rhubarb liker/lover! I find it too tart. So - I diced the rhubarb (only need about 3.5 cups) and used 1/8 cup of the sugar called for to toss with the rhubarb 30 minutes before cooking. I add more ingredients for the crumble topping as peole tell me it's to die for - this gives it a thicker top crust that people are crazy about. I usually have plenty of filling left over so I usually cut up some strawberries and make turnovers with the filling - people enjoy that as well. One quick word of caution - be careful you don't overfill!! I did it the first FOUR times I made this pie.. I couldn't help it - it was so good! Now I have more restraint, but those first 4 times the outer crust fell off and filling bubbled over the edge on to the baking sheet making it difficult to clean. Good luck and trust me - people will LOVE this pie!!

Wonderful use for rhubarb.  I'd echo what others said and do not overfill crust.  Will try cutting sugar next attempt and adding a pinch of cinnamon.  I also added some lemon zest to the sour cream fillling.  Kicks it up just a notch, which this recipe hardly needs.  Easy, yummy, crowd-pleasing.

LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  I think different varietes of rhubarb have different tartness so maybe that's why some foodies prefer less sugar.  But I don't think it's fair to change the recipe and then give it a poor review.

I made this for a "pie-baking contest" at work and won first prize! I did add fresh strawberries to the whole mixture just because I love a rhubarb/straberry combination of any kind. Will devinitely make over and over!

This was really good. I used frozen chopped rhubarb and it worked just fine, well maybe, the middle of the pie was soupy when I cut it and tried to serve. Next time I'll try cooking a little longer to see if this remedies this. I also used 1 cup sugar per other reviewers.

Absolutely delicious! Served it with fresh sour cream.  Nice change from my normal home-grown rhubarb desert which I make with ginger, maple syrup and fresh orange peel.

I made this last week. I didn't have  enough fresh rhubarb so I used some frozen that I had. I aslo didn't have the sour cream, so used plain yogurt. This pie was great.I will make this again.

I made this pie with the following exceptions: I used 1-1/4 cups sugar and used 1 cup of cut up strawberries and 3 cups of rhubarb. No one liked this pie. They said the crumb topping was too thick and the inside tasted too much like flour.

I am a big rhubarb fan and this pie is an amazing way to use up that rhubarb. The topping is wonderful, and the sour cream rhubarb filling make a wonderful balance of tartness, sweetness and creaminess! I didn't quite need 4 cups of rhubarb though. I just used 3. I will be making this pie all through rhubarb season and for many years to come!

Good taste, easy to make.  I can see how the texture though would be hard for some people to get past.  I enjoyed it.  Made the butter flaky pie crust from this site and added oats to the crisp topping.

Used 3 cups rhubarb and threw in some dark, sweet cherries. Used just 1 cup sugar. Not great...needed the extra half cup sugar suggested in the recipe. Pie looked beautiful but very so so tasting. Definitely wouldn't make again.

Great taste but the amounts did not work for me at all! I used less than 4 cups of my own frozen rhubarb, and the sour-cream filing was way too much for a 9-inch pie crust. So I ended up scooping off about 3/4 cup of it, and instead of topping it with the crumb mix, I just sprinkled some brown sugar on top. I still had to put another pie dish underneath it in the oven, because the pie pan was too full. Next time I will use a 10-inch pie pan, the same amount of sour cream filling, and again omit the crumb mix - it was good just like that and less rich.

This was good, but not as good as the reviews seemed to make it sound.  I really like a rhubarb custard pie and thought this would be a similar texture and taste, but I think I will stick with the custard.  Thanks for the recipe anyways

best rhubarb pie I've ever tasted! The creamy texture is a great way to avoid a runny pie and it combines perfectly with the tartness of the rhubarb. I've made this twice in the last 2 weeks (I have a lot of rhubarb!!)

I make this pie every year as soon as the rhubarb is ready.  I have 2 in the oven right now.  My recipe differs slightly - only 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup of sour cream and no egg.  This should eliminate the boil over problem.  A deep dish pie plate is always the best option as well.  So, 5* for my variation.  Our mouths are watering from the aroma...

This pie was delicious!! I added an extra tablespoon of flour to the sourcream mixture and the pie cut beautifully.  It wasn't runny at all.  I took the advice of others and added a little cinnamon to the crumb topping. While it was cooking I was a little worried that the top would get too crispy and dark. It worked out, but I think next time I'll lower the temperature a few minutes earlier.

I made this with a batch of fresh rhubarb and followed everything as written, no substitutions. It was too sweet, in my opinion. And as some reviewers noted, the filling ended up quite messy - I couldn't cut the pieces neatly at all. The crust baked well, even on the bottom, but I would have liked a firmer consistency to the custard. I think the butter/sugar topping was unnecessary and would leave it out next time. Or would season it with cinnamon/nutmeg for added flavor, as one person suggested. Overall it was OK but I probably won't make it again.

Outstanding! Mine came out a bit on the soupy side but the taste is so good it wins a 5 anyhow. Will add one teaspoon of cornstarch next time to the custard to thicken, but very nice meld of flavours and good ratio of sugar to rhubarb.

This recipe is excellent.  I may reduce the sugar next time, and only had 3/4 cup sour cream, so supplemented with 1/4 cup of half and half.  My husband and I both love it.. It is a beautiful flavor with the rhubarb.. Definitely a keeper!!

Really good recipe to have on hand. It turned out really good but I think next time I will alternate layers of strawberries and rhubarb for some more flavor. I did not reduce the sugar and would not reccomend doing so. It was just the right balance of sour and sweet. Thanks!

This was good.  I thought the crust was a little soggy.  In the future, I think I would use an egg wash on crust and bake that for a few minutes first.  I added the topping after the first higher baking tempurature.  I would suggest adding some cinnamon and/or nutmeg to the topping for some added flavor.  Overall, very good recipe.

This is a great rhubarb pie recipe. It is better once it has sat in the fridge, so chill this one completely. The only changes I made was to use Splenda for Baking & Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of the sugars.

Excellant Pie!  Will definitely make again.  The one thing I would suggest is to use a deep dish pie crust as the ingredients spilled over a regular sized pie crust.

Definitely a 5. I need to plant some rhubarb so I'll have plenty for this pie.

Taste was nice, especially the sugar topping at the end. Only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the appearance. It looked a bit like curdled milk. I used low fat sour cream ~perhaps that was the problem. Will make again for sure.
**Made it again and baked for about 10 minutes longer. No more curdled appearance. Now its a 5 star. My favourite rhubarb pie.
