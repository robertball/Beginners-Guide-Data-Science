These cookies are easy to through together and yummy!  After reading the reviews, I decided to try it with 2-1/2 cups of flour and add a 1/4 cup of additional peanut butter.  Our cookies were absolutely PERFECT.  I used a cookie scoop and slightly smooshed them with the back of a spoon - added an extra couple of minutes to cook since they're a bit larger using the scoop.  One thing I've noticed with peanut butter cookies - the pb taste is not that strong when they're warm and that they have more flavor the next day. Three days later these cookies are still soft in the middle, slight crunch around the center and have a delicious peanut butter taste - and you just got to love those chocolate chips - I used mini's!

Really great cookies. I followed others advice and used 2 1/2 cups flour  and 1 1/4 cups of peanut butter. The recipe does yield a lot of cookies so be prepared to be baking for a while. My husband liked them cooked 10 mins (chewy) I prefered 13 mins, a little crispy around the edges.

I feel like I should defend these cookies after some of the reviews.  I thought they were really good!  I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips.  I also mixed my dry ingredients together before adding them to the creamed mixture.  The dough wasn't stiff enough to roll into a ball, so I just used a cookie scoop and then used the back of a spoon to smoosh them down a little.  I had to cook mine a little longer, about 13 minutes was just right.  Thanks for the recipe!

this is the most wonderful recipe in the world. I love cookies and these are the best. I could taste the peanut butter and the chocolate chips. dont listen to the reviews that say they are to dry or i didnt like this or that. they are the ones who changed the recipe. If you are going to rate a recipe at least follow it before you do.

These cookies are inviting because they look absolutely beautiful. Once in your mouth, however, they're a letdown. The cornstarch makes them too tender and soft - I like my peanut butter cookies more substantial. They weren't sweet enough or peanut buttery enough. Too bad they don't taste as good as they look!

I would definitely agree with some of the other comments that say it's a bit dry/floury. I just made these following the exact measurements and they're not as moist as I would like. Next time I will try it with less flour and more peanut butter and sugar. But you should definitely try it this way first - it's good as it is!

Peanut butter cookies have never been my favorite but these are outstanding! Very nice texture; not too soft, not too crunchy. I guess corn starch really makes a difference.

The only change I made was using milk chocolate chips.  I thought they were pretty good, just thought that they could have used more chocolate chips.  That may be a preference thing too.  I would have given 4.5 if I could have.

These did not turn out well for me at all. I double-checked the recipe to make sure I followed it correctly and I did.  I did, however, use freshly ground peanut butter that was very dense in texture.  Perhaps that was a bad idea.  These turned out very heavy.  Not flakey.  Not moist/chewy.  Even the flavor was not the greatest.  Very disappointing.

Just finished baking these and I think they taste really good. The texture is not what I expected, more like a shortbread, but they  have good flavor.

Tender, sable texture, aided along with the addition of cornstarch. As a result, these are more delicate than classic peanut butter cookies, so know ahead of time that they break and crumble easily. This accounts for the 4 star rating. Since I firmly believe that you can't have too much of a good thing, I added Reese's Pieces and chopped up Snickers to the chocolate chips. There was just enough cookie to tie everything together. The caramel in the Snickers partially melted, then added a lot of chewiness when cool.  No way can you stop at one. Don't forget to flatten significantly before they go into the oven, because with this dough, what you see is what you get, i.e. no spreading whatsoever. These freeze very successfully, and, unfortunately, they were even wonderful directly from the freezer. Not good for weight management...

I made these exactly as written.  I was somewhat disappointed in them.  The texture is extremley soft and almost cake like ( probably due to the cornstarch), after all flour + cornstarch = cake flour. The flavor also was a bit of a letdown, not as peanut buttery as I'd imagined.  I may try them again with 1/4 c. of additional peanut butter. Also I think they need 2-3 mins more baking time; at least in my oven.  I will continue looking for a good recipe for this type of cookie.

These were pretty good.  I liked the dense texture.  I agree with many others, that something seemed to be missing in the flavor.  I think the corn syrup dulls the other flavors somehow.  I did add an extra 1/4 C peanut butter after reading other reviews.

I made a few modifications to this recipe and the result was fantastic!  I used cold, cubed unsalted butter (this keeps the cookies from spreading during baking and created a great, fluffy texture).  I also increased the amount of peanut butter to 1 1/4 cups and the amount of chocolate chips to 2 1/2 cups (1 whole 12oz. bag and about 1/4 of another).  Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop, I got 40 cookies out of the batch with the above modifications and baked the cookies for 14-16 minutes.  The cookies were absolutely delicious and I'll be adding this to my favorite cookie recipes.

Excellent!  Rave reviews from my family.
I made them with mini-chips and used my small cookie scoop - better than my standard recipe by far!!

I have been baking cookies for 45 years. I made these today with my youngest gradchild helping. They were easy and came out wonderful. I have tried many peanut butter chocolate chip recipes over the years that didn't cut it. I am so happy to have found this one finally! I can clearly taste the peanut butter anf the texture is perfect. For those of you who thought they were dry ...these are easy to overbake because they do not change color much in the oven. Check your oven temp and watch your time on these closely.

These are absolutely delicious! I ran out of creamy peanut butter so I ended up using crunchy peanut butter. My kids said this made them even better and we used chocolate chunks instead of chips. We followed the advice of others to up the peanut butter and down the flour and they were perfect.

I thought these were good but not great. They definitely need more peanut butter, as the flavor was not strong enough and got overpowered by the chocolate chips.

I didn't like the cookies AT ALL... the texture was more like cake than a cookie - I like cookies crips on the outside and soft on the inside.  The flavor wasn't worth writing home over either.  It seemed I could almost taste the baking soda or maybe it was the corn starch.  Ewwww, nasty!

Very cakey cookies.  Not a fan.  The only substitution I made in the recipe was using crunchy peanut butter.  Won't be making these again.

I have to say I was really excited to try this recipe but in my opinion is that they are very dry in texture and not very tasty and I even made mine with the reccomended adjustments. Not something I will make again.

amazing cookies, I only changed the type of PB to honeynut to add that little bit of spice and I use mini chocochips so I can portion smaller cookies.

Tried these cookies with high expectations.  They were dry!  I was very disappointed.  If I make them again, I'll try adding more oil...

Not bad. Note: if you use salted butter, omit the salt in the recipe (unless you like salty cookies). I also recommend adding another 1/2 to whole cup more chocolate chips. Original recipe only yielded about 3 chips per cookie.

Just made these last night - what a rich and yummy cookie! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 1/2 cups of flour, and 1 1/4 cups peanut butter - the texture turned out great.

I did not find these cookies to be good at all. I found them flavorless, and a tad bit salty. Not at all what I expected chocolate peanut butter cookies to taste like. I will keep looking for an amazing recipe.

AWESOME! I made a few changes after reading mixed reviews. I decided that there are way more people who love them than hate them, so isn't that a good enough reason to try them?? And use a bit of common sense while you are making them!! Different people say they are dry, then by all means, put half the  flour in and then test bake 1 cookie and if it goes flat, put about 1/4 cup more flour and continue testing. You can always put in more flour, but you cannot take it out! Simple! Here is what I did and it turned out great on the first test. I used only 1 cup whole wheat flour and no white flour, I then added 1 cup quick cooking oats instead of the other cup of flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar Splenda ( as per directions on bag) I used 1 1/4 cup Zimmermans all natural peanut butter which had been refrigerated and was quite hard. I am sure that you could use Smuckers all natural peanut butter which I actually like better!!!
 When making my first test cookie I used a cookie dropper and did not flatten it and it was very soft in the center. The next ones I flattened slightly with a flat bottom glass dipped in white sugar. I baked them for about 13 minutes. I wouldn't flatten them next time though, cuz the ones I flattened are a bit crumbly when cooled. I may add an extra egg the next time which should take care of it,or 1/4 cup more flour. Wonderful, and really pretty healthy w/ my changes. Don't give up on your first try.There is the utmost potential here for those w/ an imagination

These cookies were great! Make sure that you don't over cook them, (they will set a little as they cool). I whipped the eggs with a little bit of the creamy mixture. They were very soft and fluffy.

These cookies are delicious.  Anyone who only gave this recipe 1 or 2 stars either messed something up, or were just in a bad mood.  I took some contructive advice from other reviews, and increased the peanut butter to 1 & 1/2 cups.  I also reduced the flour a little to 2 & 1/4 cups.  Next time I might reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup, but only because my personal preference is that I don't like my cookies too sweet (the chocolate chips add enough lovely sweetness for me)!  In the end, these cookies were soft, chewy and delightful - I will definitely make them again....It's the next day, and I'm adding to my review.  these cookies are even better the next day (not too sweet after all).  They are the exact chewy, dense, rich peanutbuttery cookies I was looking for.  Almost forgot to add that I had to cook them a little longer (13-15 mins), but maybe it's my oven.  Thanks!

Okay, so for this recipe I noted a few things, that might help others.

When creaming the butter brown sugar do it only few a few seconds so its blended, then add in the eggs, peanut butter and vanilla and beat again but only for a few seconds, til mixed, you don't want it runny, that never makes for good cookies, add all your dry ingredients, fold into wet mixture, and then take off any rings, and use your hands to mix up the dough it works far better then any wooden spoon. After all is said and done, make your balls and place on baking sheet. I suggest not actually rolling them, as they crumble, instead squish between both hands to form ball shape. hope it helps~
but as for the actual recipe, I didn't like it, its to crumbley

My 9 and 7 year old daughters made these.  My 9 year old says, "These are definitely heavenly!!"  These are one of the few cookies I've had where the cookie tastes better than the raw dough.

I am trying this recipe today. The texture of the cookie look good.  The taste is very good.   My daughter loves peanut butter even though she is an adult, I still like baking cookies for her.  She really liked them very much.

These cookies were great, just like it says in the description! Very easy and quick to mix up the dough, and it uses items that I always have in my pantry. So no special trip to the store for these! It was pretty humid when I mixed up the dough so it was pretty sticky and the dough even looked kind of greasy, which made me a little nervous about how they would turn out. However, once they were baked the greasiness went away. Tasted really good - very peanut buttery. These will be made again in my house! Thanks for the recipe, Kathy!

These are  good peanut butter cookies, but not the best from this site.  I am not sure the purpose of the cornstarch in the recipe and probably won't make these again, just because we have had better.

I did not like these at all.  It a strange day in my house when cookies are not eaten.  I think it might be the absence of any white sugar.  They just don't taste very good.

These really are quite heavenly! I followed the recipe to exactness except I added some extra PB (about 1/4 cup) and a bit more salt because I use unsalted butter. Baked about 11 minutes to perfection, not to under or over baked! I thought the flour was right on but I live at 4500 elevation, at sea level I would decrease it a few tbsp! Also you can half the recipe fo a smaller batch!

Yummy.....I used 1 stick of butter and 1 of margarine.  The cookies turned out very good.  Also, I used the mini chips.  These will definitely be one of our favorites and tomorrow when our grandson comes over I am sure I won't have many left.  Easy and quick to make.

Yum! These cookies didn't last long. I added a little extra peanut butter according to other people's suggestion. My only criticism is that they didn't stay together vey well after they were cooked. I will definetely be making these again.

I substituted flax meal and a little water for the eggs and used vegan friendly margarine for baking. The dough was irresistable..so hard to stay out of! I checked them at 10 min. and they were not ready. Added 3 more minutes and they were still soft, but after cooling they firmed. Great peanut buttery taste!

Whew.....this recipe makes a lot! No big changes, just used a whole bag of semi sweet chocolate chips and a half bag of Reese's baking chips. (We like a lot of "stuff" in our cookies. These held up real well and didn't spread. My husband loves these, for me, it could use more peanut butter. I loved how they didn't spread. NOTE: Next time, I might use chunky peanut butter or add a half cup of chopped peanuts. I think that would be a good addition.

Very delicious. They were a bit dry at first, but after a day or two sitting out uncovered, they seemed to draw moisture from the atmosphere and were very good.  I know because they didn't last long.

Ohh NO! I forgot the peanut butter! Awesome cookies. We are a little high in elevation and always have flat choco-chip cookies. These turned out better than any we've made before and when we made them with the p.b., they were also great! Again, fluffy cookies even with our high altitude. Good name for the recipe!

Good, good, good, good , good. My sister exclaimed they were as addictive as a drug. Absolutely the best pb chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! Follow the recipe exactly. It's perfect, and to die for (which is why I guess they are from heaven!).

In my opinion alone this is a 4 star recipe, but because of my family I went with 5. All four kids loved these and my husband absolutely adored them. He is who I made the cookies for in the first place, peanut butter chocolate chip cookies are his favorite, so I guess it's fair to go with his rating and not mine. I did use less flour and more peanut butter, 2 1/2 flour and 1 1/4 peanut butter like the other reviewers suggested. I think the peanut butter taste was just right this way. The cookies are a bit dry, I think that's why I only rate them 4 stars. They are soft, though, not hard or crumbly. The dough is too yummy, much better then the cookie in my opinion. I had a hard time resisting the urge to gobble it up when rolling the cookies. All in all, it’s a great recipe that I will make again.

My wife, my brother, and I loved these! I made them just like the recipe except I used 1/4 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 cup less flour. They seem to stay the same shape as the they are put on the sheet, so I recommend smooshing them down with a fork and rounding the edges by hand before baking for the best look.

Definitely a good cookie. It really is better the next day though. Some of the other reviews mentioned that it was a really big recipe, which in my house is never really a problem, however, if your tired of baking them, the dough is to die for. Before my daughter knew what they were called she actually said "this dough is like heaven". We also followed the suggestion of less flour and more PB. :)

These were pretty delicious - would make again for sure.  Although Anna Olsen from the show Sugar has the BEST chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted and you can just add some PB to it.

I made the changes suggested by previous reviewers, but still wanted a more hearty (and healthy) cookie. I added 2 cups of multigrain hot cereal (could also use plain oatmeal) and they turned out great! Chewy, hearty, not too oily (a problem with peanut butter cookies in my opinion), and delicious!
Thanks for all the great recipes!

These were ok. Not heavensent but good.  I used 1 1/2 cup PB and 2 1/4 cups flour per previous reviewers. Had I used only 1 cup PB and the addtional flour they would definitley not have been peanut buttery enough.  I'm going to keep looking.

Very dry. Not much flavor. I was very dissapointed after reading all the positive reviews. Next time I will stick with the good old plain chocolate chip cookies. I will not make these again.

This recipe is a winner and it has earned it name. It does call for only 1 cup of chocolate chips, but since we all love chocolate I just put the whole bag in. They just melt in your mouth and so very good and just the right amount of peanut butter.

I found at first that this recipe didn't have enough peanut butter flavor for my taste, so I substituted 1/2 cup of the peanut butter with 3/4 cup extra crunchy.  Yummy!  It really gave them something extra.  I gave them as a gift, and they were a big hit!

Excellent recipe; just what I was looking for.  Easy-to-find ingredients and great cookie!  I used margarine instead of buttter and a whole bag of milk chocolate chips instead of just one cup of semi-sweet chips.  One cup of peanut butter was plenty, despite what other reviewers stated.  I just dropped the cookies onto the sheet without flattening and they turned out wonderfully!  I love this recipe and will be making them again and again, I'm sure.

made these cookies with my daughter and it was so easy. I just put all of the ingredients into a bowl and took my handheld beater using the dough hooks and blended it all with that. I also didn't flatten them either and they turned out just fine. No need to do all that extra mixing...Got compliments on these cookies at a family gathering last weekend...

I had to alter this a little bit because we didn't have enough brown sugar, or chocolate chips. So, instead, I used molasses, and I used semi-sweet baking chocolate. I think that doing this just made it a little bit sweeter, but that's it! :D My mom wanted peanut butter cookies, but I didn't, so she suggested peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. I think these truly *are* cookies from heaven! Thank for posting them! *thumbs up*

Delish! Used a whole bag of choc. chips, other than that followed recipe exactly. Mine were a little fluffier than I like but I think that's because I didn't flatten them enough.

I made these cookies after having a huge chocolate and peanut butter craving.  I found them to be delicious.  I made half of the batch without chocolate chips (my husband is not a huge fan of chocolate) and I decreased the amount of choc. chips to 1 cup.  With or without chocolate chips, these cookies are really good!!

These were just not very good.  Akin to what other said -- texture was off in that they were dense, cake-like, oily, dry, and definitely not chewy nor crispy.  The flavor was also sort of lacking, I thought.  I used Peter Pan peanut butter and followed the recipe exactly.  Wondered if I overmixed, but don't think so.  Maybe I should have made them smaller and flatter - but it already made way more than 24 cookies.

I admit, the title caught my attention. These were great cookies! I used shortening instead of butter, added the full quantity of flour, and added two TSBP of milk since the dough looked a little crumbly. (Being at high altitude, I usually add an extra 1/4 c. of flour and reduce leavening by 1/4 tsp. when baking.) They were perfect after 10 minutes-- golden on the tips and not too gooey in the middle.

these cookies were great! I was stupid and didnt realize we didnt have corn starch until i needed it so i subistuted it with a little less than1/4 cup of flour. it still tasted great, they are just a little flat. Also, i did what the other reviews said, which is to only use 1 1/2 cups of flour {but then again i added more later} and i used an extra fourth of a cup of peanut butter. they were amazing and i will be making these again soon for christmas

I just made these last night, they are GONE! :O they are/were soo good. They were nice and soft on the inside, a slight crunch on the outside. I followed other reviews and used less flour and more PB. I also used peanut butter chips vs choc chips. mmmmmm-delicious!

Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I also cut down the flour and upped the PB. I still didn't like them. I made another batch omitting the cornstarch completely and only used 2 cups of flour, they were better, but still not wonderful!  But w/o the cornstarch and flour lessened they didn't have a gritty consistency and they were slightly moister.

I just made the peanut butter chocolate chip "cookies from heaven".  There is not enough of a peanut butter flavor for my taste.

I am only giving this recipe two stars because even when I modified as others suggested; using less flour and more peanut butter they were still dry and tasteless. Sorry, hate to say anything negative but I was disappointed.

My family thought the taste of this cookie was really good.  However, the texture was too crumbly.  I feel like the cornstarch may have been the reason why.  I'm sure some people might like their cookies like this, but it was not to our family's preference.  Thanks for sharing!

These are great! I changed the quantity to 6 and used an egg and butter substitute because we don't eat dairy. I also used whole wheat pastry flour because we don't use AP flour. I scooped them with a tablespoon and didn't bother to flatten them. It's make 'em much softer this way. The flatter they are the harder/crunchier they can get. I love the amount of peanut butter in it, it's not too overwhelming. I'll make these again. Thanks! UPDATE: I used olive oil instead and rolled them into 2" balls and flattened them just a teeny bit. They were perfect! These are probably my favorite cookies to bake.

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday by request, and we really enjoyed them. I smuggled a bunch in my purse to the bar for his birthday night out, and I didn't get one complaint. The peanut butter flavor was nice and pronounced too. These cookies definitely have a lighter, more cake-like texture than the chewy/moist cookies we prefer. Among these thick types of cookies I've found the best ones come from a secret ingredient of dry pudding mix in the dough: the cornstarch made these a little too dry. We still really liked these though: the obligatory glass of milk was just that much more refreshing :) Thanks for sharing.

I tried these being a peanut butter fan and was disappointed with it.  I substituted Margerine for butter and that might have been a factor but I am wondering if it was the constarch that I was tasting or texture.  I found them very floury. I am going to try again with butter and leave out the cornstarch and see if they are better.

The "from heaven" claim is going a bit far. These are okay and only if you do them just right. Definitely only let them bake for 10 minutes! Any more and they are chalky and really not good. Even when the baking time is right, they are pretty dry - better have a lot of milk on hand.

These were so delicious. We all loved them over here. My husband said these were the best cookies ever, and they are his new favorite. My 1 year old really loved them too! I made mine bigger than the recipe called for so I got 18 big huge cookies. Thanks so much for this recipe. It's going to be in my family forever now.

Great cookies!! These hit the spot, no doubt about it. Very tender, not crumbly, not hard. Ten minutes was a perfect cooking time. I used skippy natural peanut butter and semi-sweet chips, I might try dark chocolate next time.

These turned out very crumbly when I baked them for the recommended time and doughy when I decreased it.  I even followed other reviewers' suggestions and adjusted the ingredients.  Not sure I will make these again.

FABULOUS recipe! I used chunky peanut butter and added more PB and less FLOUR as some of the reviewers had suggested.  Mine took 14 minutes to bake instead of 10 though.  They were just the right amount of crispy and chewy together...and like someone else had said MUCH more peanut buttery tasting once completely cooled and set.  AMAZING recipe! Highly recommended!

This recipe was easy to follow and the cookies came out very yummy.  I added a cup of peanut butter chips and I also used crunchy peanut butter. The recipe mentions to flatten them slightly, make sure you do this because they do not flatten at all while baking.

I wouldn't say these were for heaven.  Ohio maybe, but not heaven.  Texture is nice and kind of melts in your mouth but I can barely taste the PB.  I probably won't make these again.

These were just okay for me.  I feel bad because the other reviews were so good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I even cut down the cooking time on the last batch to make sure it's more moist rather than dry.  Probably will not bake these again.

I enjoyed these, though they are not my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe. my husband was not fond of them. However, they were something different. I guess I just like the old stand bye.

These cookies were good...good texture..they bake well. What I didn't like was that they tasted kind of bland and didn't taste peanut buttery enough for me.

With my husband a peanut butter cookie lover and my daughter a chocolate chip cookie lover, this recipe gave them the best of both worlds.  We used the mini morsels.  The cookies were moist and chewy.  The perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter.  We'll definitely be making these again.

These cookies were quite good.  I've made them both with white sugar and with brown sugar.  Personally, I prefer them with white sugar.  I found that making bigger cookies gave better results.  They turned out perfectly golden on the bottom while a batch of smaller ones got quite dark.   Plus, you can really appreciate the peanut and chocolate flavour with bigger cookies!  Yum!

I didn't like these cookies very much. I was swayed to try them because of the good reviews, but i should have passed. The recipe didn't tell you to combine flour and other dry ingredients separately before mixing together with creamed mixture. Anyhow, I don't like how oily it ended up being. My chocolate chips don't even want to stay in the cookie. Aside from that, it tasted too cake like. I like chewy cookies, and this wasn't the texture i got. blah. I'm mad that i wasted my chocolate chips, I could have used them for a way better cookie or brownies or something. Oh yeah, i followed the recipe exactly (aside from mixing my dry ingredients in a separate bowl before adding to the rest).

Good, simple to make cookies.  The peanut butter flavor is subtle, but very good.  I was especially impressed by how they looked.  I didn't bother to roll them, but instead spooned them on the cookie sheet and gently pressed down on the tops.  They looked just like the cookies in magazine pictures.  They taste even better the next day.  One word of warning, if, like me, you are a cookie dough junkie, don't even taste this dough or you will never get any cookies baked!!  It is as delicious (or maybe more delicious) than the cookies themselves!  Tastes like peanut butter fudge.

I just made this recipe and it is from heaven! I agree with other posters that most of the people who are unhappy with this recipe are the ones who tweaked it and I think it is terribly rude to pan a recipe that you have altered. This recipe should have a solid 5 star rating.

I don't know what recipe the bad reviews refer to, although I guess it's possible for anyone to mess up a perfectly good recipe. After all, that's why there are good cooks and bad cooks, eh? This is one of THE BEST peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipes around, hands down. I add a little extra peanut butter. My oldest son loved them so much, we made them for Santa Claus last Christmas, and this year we will do the same. Thanks, Kathy, for a great submission!

My husband and I found similar cookies in San Francisco.  I really liked them and wanted to duplicate them and although I mixed the soda measurements, they still tasted great, they were just a little flat.

I did not enjoy these cookies at all.  They were okay, but these cookies were too rich.  I tried a few other peanut butter chocolate chip cookies from this site and they weren't that good either.  My family and neighbors didn't really enjoy them either.  Just a few bites from this cookie made my tastebuds sick.  I'm definitely never, ever, going to make another peanut butter chocolate chip cookie again.  I'm sticking with normal chocolate chip cookies.

Made these this afternoon.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  I have pampered chef cookie scoops, and first pan I used the medium scoop.  I decided those were too big, so used the small scoop for the rest. I used a form to flatten slightly.  My son-in-law says they are perfect.

Absolutely love these cookies and my family and friends do too! I followed the recipe except I made the cookies a bit bigger than the instructions say to and ended up cooking them for 13 minutes instead of 10 because they were obviously undercooked after 10 minutes. Turned out great! I think next time I’ll even try them without the chocolate chips because the actual cookie was so good. Oh! And I didn’t have any vanilla but they were still excellent!

I have made these several times and after reading the wild range of reviews I decided to toss in how they work for me. I do add a bit more peanut butter and a tad less flour and I make sure not to over bake them. I think some of the reviews confuse you into thinking they need to cook longer and that dries them out. The brown sugar does the trick for mine and they come out soft every time.

The flavor was just OK, but the dough was very dry. I've never put cornstarch in a cookie recipe and I've made a lot of cookies over the years. I think the cornstarch is what dried out the dough.

The recipe called for way too much flour compared to peanut butter. I should have been the wiser to adjust the ratios. They are more filler than peanut butter tasting. The saving grace is the chocolate chips.

I made this recipe with a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of peanut butter chips. If I make again I would use 2 1/2 cups of flour and a 1/2 cup more peanut butter. The cookies had a flour taste. I would probably also use a little less chips than I used but you live and you learn.

I made these cookies and I thought they were great the only thing I did that was different was to add 1/4 cup more peanut butter only cuz I wanted a really peanut butter taste. I will definitely make this again.

Maybe it's just a matter of preference. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the reviewers' suggestion to increase the peanut butter a little and decrease the flour a little. I liked the soft texture, but it was still too floury for us. I will try this again, but will try increasing the peanut butter to 1.5 cups and decreasing the flour drastically to 2 cups or even 1.5 cups. (There are peanut butter cookie recipes that use no flour at all.) I will also double the chocolate chips. I think it has potential. Thank you for sharing the good idea of using corn starch to make a nice texture!

These cookies are great, I've never expected them to be so good.I added only wheat flour and white sugar because in my country brown sugar is kind of expensive but it makes no real difference and cookies are just delicious. At first moment, when I took them out of the oven, I was disappointed, they turned out too soft and they were falling apart`when I tried to move them from paper sheet but I left them on paper for a while and they started to be more firm.

I followed the recipe when I made these cookies and they are, were, delicious. The only exception I made was something I learned to do with peanut butter cookies: I roll them in granulated sugar before I flatten them. That way they have a nice sugary coating all over. I will definetly be making these again.

Really loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a tee.
No changes needed in my eyes.  They've been out of the oven for a few minutes and several have disappeared already. Nice flavour and texture, go ahead, give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

I was hoping for the best with these after reading the reviews, but a bit disappointed.  Not sweet enough, a bit floury, but quite peanut buttery.  Texture was okay, just needed a little umph, sugar perhaps?

This recipe is delicious!  I did cut the flour down to 2 1/2 cups and the cornstarch down to 3 tbl. Also I added 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter instead of 1 cup. Instead of rolling the batter into balls I used a table spoon and scooped the batter onto the pan pressing down on top of the cookie slightly with the table spoon. They came out amazing!  The only thing I think I would change in the future are the chips, the semi sweet were good but I think another flavor would be better.

I sometimes feel that peanut butter cookies have a strange texture to them.  These do not, I guess it is the cornstarch. So happy to have found this recipe.

These cookies are great! I had a huge jar of unopened peanut butter...the one from Costco and it was about to expire. I found this recipe followed it as is. I made about 5 batches of cookies within a week, I made a couple of small bags to hand out and I have been getting requests for more since than. Let's just say have to go out and buy more peanut butter.

These cookies are way too good! But I threw an extra half cup chocolate chips, and for the butter I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortining. Those cookies were so good and moist we couldent stop eating them!!!

Can I just say that these cookies were easy, pretty fool proof, and excellent?  I realized once i started mixing that i did not have any baking powder (oops) so I left it out and increased the soda to 11/2 tspns with no real damage done.  Great cookies!!

I followed the recipe as written, since I like to try them that way first, then the variations.  These cookies have a great flavor, are dense and chewy.  They didn't seem done after 10 minutes, so I baked them another 2-3 minutes.  My husband loved them.

This cookie is really yummy made them just as the recipe is written the are wonderful! I then made them going down 1/4 cup of flour and adding 1/4 peanut butter still delicious! What I like is these cookies are moist and not overly sweet. I did adjust baking time according to the size I rolled them. They make alot of cookies which is nice and they don't take an enormous amount of ingredients. The dough is yummmmmy!. I also did roll these and freeze them indivduallly then packaged them up after they were frozen in balls and put them in the freezer to have to make quickly. Thaw them for about 30 minutes and you are good to go!

I followed the directions very carefully.  The only change I made was to use 1 1/4 cup PB and 2 1/2 cups flour.  THese cookies are SO dry.  They're the worst cookies I've ever made.  I made them for friend, and now I need to start over with my regular recipe because I'm too embarassed to give these.

I had no problems with this recipe at all. The cookies were much crunchier the next day but not hard at all, and the flavor was amazing. Definitely the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've tried, with or without the chocolate. Red and green M&M's make this a good Christmas cookie too. This recipe made a lot of cookies and you might want to fiddle with the baking time a bit, depending on how big you make them. But this recipe does give you a delicious payoff for your work and I am definitely making these again!

I used the others suggestion of adding 1/4 cup more peanut butter and 1/4 cup less flour.  These are the best peanut butter chocolate chip cookies I have ever had.  Amazing.  I live at 7300ft elevation and these cookies held thier shape.  Thanks for the recipe Kathy!

My 12 year old son made these all by himself. They were absolutely delicious the only comment I have is that they needed more chocolate.

I did enjoy baking them, it was fast easy and not a hassel to clean-up. over-all i think the cookie was good but i didnt like that they were a little uncooked in the middle even thought i cooked it for the full time! but i'd bake them again only longer.. the cookies did taste AMAZING!!! =)

When I baked the cookies they were pretty decent except they had a burnt taste to them. They were kind of dry to. I wish they has a little more mousture so them. I loved the cookie dough though. I love almost any cookie dough lol. But I thought they were pretty good for the most part. We made them for a welcome back/ open house for our tech campus, so that we could serve them to the parents. I think most of the people that tried them, likes them.

Great cookie!, I prefer to not bake it all the way to golden brown because then it turns out nice and chewy when cooled, but thats just my preference. But overall this is a recipe you have to try! very yummy:)

Great recipe. I've never reviewed a recipe before but I felt this one warranted it. I replaced the butter with equal amount of unsweetened apple sauce and replaced 1 cup of white flour with 1 cup whole wheat. They came out soft and even "fluffy". I did add the whole bag of choclate chips too. My husband loved them. Loved them even more when he new they were slightly less calories. He could eat more that way!

One word..."Amazing!!!"  I love the idea of adding the cornstarch for a shortbread type cookie. I used left over chocolate form Easter and cut it into chunks, but followed the recipe exactly!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Crumbly, way too crumbly, I don't know but the cookies were just okay, they were very crumbly, and didn't have the texture of a regular peanutbutter cookie, even though I added a lil more peanut butter as suggested.  I wouldn't makes this again. I will look for a better peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe, I think less flour or omitting the cornstarch may make then more like soft chewy peanut butter cookies???

I live in China and it can be difficult to find recipes that actually work with the ingredients I have and the tiny toaster oven I use to bake with! Usually cookies flatten out too much into crunchy crackers and these stayed soft. I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar since good brown sugar is hard to find and expensive here. My Chinese friends love them!!! Thanks.

This is an awesome recipe.  I had a hankering for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies one day, but wanted to have one that included whole wheat flour.  This recipe came up and then I read all the reviews of it.  One review in particular, from Poppyseed, had some modifications that included whole wheat flour, oats, and splenda brown sugar blend.  It sounded good, so I tried it.  I am happy to report that I had great success on the first try, with my own modifications.  I used SmartBalance 50/50 Butter Blend instead of butter, and just like Poppyseed, I used 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of oats in place of the white flour.  I found that the cookies required slight flattening if I used a 1 tbsp. scoop, but no flattening required if I used a cookie dropper.  Since I use dark-coated cookie sheets and my cookies were a little smaller, I only baked them for 8 minutes at 350 degree. Great recipe if you want a whole-grain cookie that won't make you feel quite as guilty.  Thanks Kathy and Poppyseed.

Wow...these turned out great!  I  have another PB cookie recipe I LOVE that always turns out but these were fantastic.  I wonder what role the cornstarch plays in that.  I used Smart Balance 50/50 sticks instead of butter and only had one egg so used it + 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce.  I used Skippy "Natural" peanut butter but it has palm oil so that may have contributed to the cookie texture too - I usually use all-natural PB (i.e. just peanuts and salt:).  But, mmmmm....mmmmm....these made my workmates' mornings!

Great peanut butter flavor without being hockey pucks. Unfortunately, going with the majority, I added more peanut butter and less flour, which made tasty cookies that fell apart which touched. I added a bit more flour into the next half, and they held together. So add the peanut butter and keep the flour. Also, makes a ton, going to have to get rid of some...maybe the mushy ones would make a good crust.

This recipe turned out very well for me. Instead of using 1 cup of chocolate chips I used a 1/2 cup of M&M's and a 1/2 cup of chips.  I greased the first pan that I baked and the cookies got a little dark on the bottom.  I didn't grease the following pans and those cookies turned out much better.

They are too much like a piece of old bread and not enough like a cookie. They are not chewy, but have a good peanut butter/chocolate taste. I would not recommend this recipe for the chewy cookie lovers. These should be retitled "peanut butter chocolate shortbread cookies.

Well, I tried the recipe, no matter how long I baked them, from 9 to 13 min., they came out rather dry and cakey, really wanted soft and chewy, guess I have to keep searching. Taste was good though.

MMmm, these cookies are great!  I also increased PB and decreased flour.  Next time I will double the chocolate chips.  I waited to write the review because when I initially tried them (still warm from the oven) they tasted really salty!  Don't know what happened, but since they've cooled completely, they are delicious.

This cookies were great! Easy to make and delicious. Only thing to watch out for- it yields a few more cookies than what is stated in the recipe. Of course, no one is complaining...

I read the reviews and was skeptical based on some negative comments.  I did follow the advice to increase the amount of peanut butter and decrease the amount of flour.  I was plesantly surprised and thought the cookies were delicious!  My daughter's kindergarten class couldn't get enough of them.  Thank you!

These are good. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as another reviewer suggested, but they still weren't quite the consistency I was looking for.

This recipe is so simple and yummy! I flattened the cookies with the bottom of a glass (dipped in sugar) and they were not only delicious, but pretty too! I did use 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter, and the texture is perfect.

These cookies were pretty average.  I made them because of the name.  I think the peanut butter only adds texture and not much taste.  The review that says the cookies had a shortbread consistency was pretty accurate.  The cookies aren't bad, my kids like them.

My family and I loved this recipe. I prefer chewy cookies rather than crispy hard cookies and this was it.  The only thing my husband said he would change is more chocolate chips!  Thank YOU Kathy for sharing this recipe: )

This was rather disappointing. I was really looking forward to the "perfect recipe". I should have listened to the people who said that it wasn't very good. I followed the recipe EXACTLY (except that I had to cook it a little longer) and it was very bland. I looked at an awesome peanut butter cookie recipe that I have made many times, and found out that that recipe had twice the amount of peanut butter than this one. They were slightly better when they were cold (they had more flavor) but they still weren't very good. I think that this could be a good recipe if someone figured out a way to double the peanut butter while keeping the same consistency.

The first time I made them I was called evil. I accidently added 1/4c extra flour the second time and they liked them even better, it becomes a molded cookie recipe, I rolled them into logs and sliced em and they were amazing and pretty and I used mini-chips.  This recipe rocks both ways though.

Fantastic cookie recipe. Mine turned out soft, truffle like, and peanut buttery delicious! I stirred the flour around in the bag before measuring and used 2 2/3 cups of flour because of some previous reviews of saying that these cookies were too dry. They turned out great! The peanut butter flavour is definately there, and amplifies the chocolate flavour as well. I'm trying to watch my weight and was making these for Valentine's day, but just couldn't help myself. Be sure to lick the spoon, that's the best part!

Personally, I could hardly taste the peanut butter and didn't think these cookies were anything special.  However, I brought them to 2 different places and everyone else loved them.

These cookies are soooo good. My husband likes peanut butter and I like Chocolate chips so we have the best of both worlds in this cookie. Easy to make and I bet hard to mess up.At first I didn't think they were done becouse they don't get really brown so after 10 mins I looked at the bottom  and they were perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe. Elaine

These cookies are the best!  We liked the subtle peanut butter flavor, and we are a family of peanut butter lovers.  Any more peanut butter would be too much.  The cookies turned out nice and soft, and the amount of chocolate was perfect.  I will use this recipe over and over.
I even sent it to my mother and sister-in-law after they raved about the cookies.

Great recipe. I did increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, decreased the corn starch, and used nearly a bag of milk chocolate chips in place of the semi sweet chips. The cookies turned out great.

This recipe was not at all like I had anticipated. Like another reviewer, I too felt the recipe needed more peanut butter. You could barely taste the peanut butter in it. Maybe that's what the recipe author was going for, a subtle peanut butter taste, but we were expecting a bold, traditional peanut butter cookie flavor with the added bonus of chocolate chips. I added more chocolate chips than the recipe called for, as it looked like it needed more as I was getting ready to spoon the cookies out. I also questioned the cornstarch. My cookies were fairly dry and I think that may have had something to do with it. I will try this recipe again later, but with adjustments based on my first experience.

These cookies were just like the name - heaven.    I used milk chocolate chips and a touch less corn starch.  They are peanut buttery and moist.  I will definately add this recipe to my cookie repertoire.

These were the absolute best peanut butter chocolate chips cookies I've ever tasted. They were very light and scruptious. I added a few more chocolate chips and used crunchy peanut butter.

These are my husbands favorite cookie. I have been making them for a long while and they always come out perfectly. I usually make them with white chocolate chips instead of the chocolate chips because that is what my husband likes. They are thick, soft and peanut buttery delicious! Thanks Kathy!

I can bake 10 dozen of these to take to work, and they're gone before noon!
