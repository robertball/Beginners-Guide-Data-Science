This was good. I served this relish with hot dogs. It added nice variety to our cookout. The onions took much longer to soften than the directions indicated and were still chunky (not really spreadable) when finsihed.

This was very well received at a recent BBQ.  I added garlic and halved the amount of sugar.  Will make again!

So easy and so versatile! I use this on steaks, scrambled eggs, chicken, everything.  The only change I made was due to necessity in that I didn't have any Red Wine vinegar so I used Balsamic Vinegar instead.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! !

This is a must for onion lovers!  So simple to make and tastes great with burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, etc.  Make a batch, put it in a jar, and watch it disappear.

Good! I added a dash of garlic powder. I served this on top of a nice steak. Husband commented the onions were 'super tasty.' Praise indeed! Thanks, Ariana!

We enjoyed this.  I added more butter, less sugar, garlic powder, sliced mushrooms and kept warm until the meat was done, eating it warm on top of steak.
