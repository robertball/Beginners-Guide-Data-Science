This was an easy way to prepare turkey and gravy.  I kept wondering why all those wonderful flavors seemed a bit bland.  Then it struck me that there is no salt in this recipe.  I would definitely make this again, but before adding all the wonderful flavors I'd sprinkle some kosher salt on the bird.  Since we don't eat the skin, I'd also recommend putting at least half of the seasoning under the skin with the butter.  You want to leave the skin on because it helps keep the meat moist, and moist it definitely is!  Thanks for this recipe!  NOTE:  This was even better as leftovers!  The flavors had had a chance to permeate the moist meat!

We used this recipe for an 8 lb. turkey breast with the bone in.  We used actual garlic and onions instead of powders, and took the advice of prior reviewers and added salt--we used coarse sea salt.  Also, did not have dry white wine, so used white cooking wine, which was fine.  The outcome was a juicy turkey with plenty of juice to make a yummy gravy. We had put in lots of extra onion and celery to roast with the turkey which is now cooking on the stove with the carcass for soup.  We will definitely go back to this recipe, I saved it in my recipe box!

This called for a lot of spices that in the end didn’t amount to much in terms of flavor – neither did the wine.  The recipe, more importantly, should instruct you to salt the turkey breast, particularly in the cavity.  Rather than the onion and celery, I stuffed it with a bread stuffing.  As for the gravy, I preferred to use chicken broth rather than water and bouillon.  All and all, given all the spices and wine, the fact this was just average was disappointing.

Read the reviews, used some of the recommendations, and this turned out to be the best turkey breast ever!  I salted the cavity, added some salt to the spice blend, and also put some of the spices underneath the skin along with the pats of butter.  My 6 lb bird was done in 2-1/4 hours, perfectly moist, tender, and loaded with flavor.  That spice blend really works, and it made delicious gravy, as well.  This now is my go-to recipe for baking a turkey breast.  This is a 5-star recipe with the few tweaks that were made.

Wonderful, loved the flavor of this turkey and gravy.  Very easy and so delicious.  I used cooking wine.  Basting juices were great.

I made this for Thanksgiving at the cottage and didn't have the spices suggested for the rub. It didn't matter, it came out delicious, tender and moist. I was asked to do it again next weekend.

I added about a tablespoon of seasoning salt like lawrys and a tad more than a teaspoon of dried thyme to the rub mixture, which I also rubbed under the skin directly on the meat before putting in the tabs of butter.  I also tented the turkey with tinfoil, which I took off for the last 45mins or so to brown and crisp up the skin.  It was fantastic. My turkey breast was around 7.5lbs and cooked for 3hrs 15 minutes... It was perfectly cooked and juicy.

I made this today and it was delicious
Of course I changed a couple of things.
I brined the breast overnight.
I used Oat Flour instead of wheat for a gluten free diet.
I put the chicken bouillon in with the broth and white wine so it made the gravy more flavorable.
And lastly, I sliced small holes and put quartered garlic cloves directly into the breast instead of putting garlic into the rub.

Used foil the whole time, basted every 30 minutes, and used no salt except what was in the broth, used more broth in place of the wine, and used Pacific Low Sodium Chicken Broth. We appreciated how this recipe did not rely on salt to make the bird tasty.

Loved this recipe!  Turkey was moist & flavorful.  Gravy was awesome even though I didn’t use bouillon.   Would like more gravy too.

The recipe was very good and my turkey turned out so moist!  I took a reviewer's advice and brined my turkey for 24 hours first. BUT I made a couple of mistakes: I did not rinse off the brine AND I added salt to  my spice rub...consequently I had one salty turkey! So I recommend brining it first,  but  then not adding salt to the spice rub, as the brine really gets salt into the meat, so rinsing is probably not enough to remove it all.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I followed the recipe for a 5.5 lb turkey breast except I made one and a half time the seasoning rub.  It was delicious!  Leftovers will be used instead of lunch meat-a healthier alternative for our turkey club sandwiches.

I love this recipe!  I use it every year for a 6 pound Turkey Breast.  It works great as long as you brine your turkey overnight first.  If you don't brine it, you will definitely need to add some salt to the rub mixture.
