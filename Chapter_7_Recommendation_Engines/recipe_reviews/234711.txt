Swapped Johnsonville Breakfast Sausage Links for the hot Italian sausage. I cut the links in half, browned and set aside while I added the remainder of the ingredients. Added the browned links and proceeded with the recipe as written omitting the 1/2 cup cream. Very yummy! This is really your basic soup recipe using basic soup ingredients. A wonderful beginner cook recipe. Using Johnsonville Breakfast Sausage Links made it "every body" friendly and was super flavorful.

This is a very good recipe, easy and really tasty. I used finely shredded cabbage instead of coleslaw mix and saut√©ed the onions and garlic with the sausage but otherwise stuck to the recipe as shown. It was a big hit with my hubby.

I swapped the sausage links for a pound of ground pork and put half a cabbage head cut small instead of the coleslaw mix and I put four fresh tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes. I also added 1 teaspoon each of rosemary, parsley, basil and oregano. I put three teaspoons of sea salt instead of salt, four bay leaves and a whole onion (I fried the onion first with the ground pork once the pork was cooked for a few minutes), five garlic cloves, and some ready to eat noodles my kids love. The rest of the recipe I followed besides adding the cabbage, celery and onion first and boiled it for and extra thirty minutes before I added the remaining ingredients.

Made this for dinner tonight as written except that my sausage was sweet instead of hot and I used about 4 oz of shredded cabbage in place of the cole slaw mix. I also cut back the broth to one quart since we like our soup less watery.  My husband and I both loved it!

jammari...its headlined as a cabbage soup. How much cabbage do I use or is it headlined wrongly? It sounds delicious but I am looking for a cabbage soup today. : )

Sorry, I only rated it 1 star as it was why to spicy for me but my husband loved it.  I must admit it was probably due to the hot sausage I bought.  The woman did say it was very hot.  I will probably try again with a regular sausage and just add a few pepper flakes.

I used Cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper and added cayenne pepper to spice it up. I did not add any heavy cream and it was delicious.
