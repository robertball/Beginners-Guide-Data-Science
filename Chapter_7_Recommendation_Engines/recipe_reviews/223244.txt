This was great!  Reminded me of my grandma's cucumbers.  She made them often for Sunday dinners.  I added just a bit of sliced green onions as she would do.

This is a classic cuke recipe for me. I personally like to add a few dashes of red wine vinegar to balance the other ingredients. The dill really makes it special as well. THis also works well with English cucumbers I have found. Don't peel them. Draining the water from the standard cukes is paramount or they will be very soggy.

Cucumber salad is one of my favorite side dishes.  This one caught my eye because of its simple seasonings and because it didn't include sugar.  The only step I left out was to salt the cucumbers first to remove the liquid because I like my cucumber salad nice and juicy. Nor would I want to take the chance of the cucumbers ending up too salty, even after rinsing them.  The lemon juice instead of vinegar made for a very light, refreshing salad with just the right balance of tanginess and creaminess.

I make this frequently BUT I use plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream (less calories) and add chopped onion.  It's great served as a side dish with fish.

I've never squeezed liquid from the cucumber before so I didn't do that.  This was a nice way to have cucumbers. Will make again. Thanks veggie mommy, I forgot how good cukes and sour cream was!

Is it possible that only 2Â½ tablespoons of sour cream was used to make this?  I too added a little onion and loads of loads of pepper and had to add more sour cream.  All in all good taste but something seems off with the measurements.

I really liked that these werent loaded down with mayo or even sour cream. However, the amounts were so vague. I used 1 large peeled English cucumber. For the salt I tried 1/4 tsp. It yielded a scant 1/4 tsp of water. I thought they tasted to salty and briefly rinsed them. In either case make sure to dry them very well, as to not water down the sour cream. I only had dry dill and used a 1/2 tsp. That seemed like a fine amount. If I make again I will skip the salting part and just add salt to taste. It gave the cucumbers too much of a limp texture, unless fresh garden cucumbers work best with this method.

My mother was from Germany and this salad was a staple for us.  When tomatoes are in season I add them to the cucumbers for something a little different.  I also like to add onions.

Delish!  Much loved family favorite since Grandmom used to make it.  I don't usually use sugar, or even the dill,and we love it on top of  mashed potatoes. I've substituted plain Greek yogurt and it's just as tasty.

Lovely light flavor. Perfect way to use all those cucumbers from the summer garden. I usually prepare this just as written and everyone loves it. For my husband, I add very thinly sliced sweet onions, as he prefers it that way. Great recipe. Makes a tasty and attractive side dish for company.

used regular yogurt instead of sour cream and added some chopped parsley and finely chopped green onions- chives would also work great. Needed a bit more sugar to hit the right balance but also added more lemon juice - almost a whole lemon's worth to an entire cucumber.

Just like I grew up with.  I sometimes use a mixure of plain yogurt & mayo for the sour cream, lemon juice & sugar. Yummy!

I've made (and eaten) this since I was a kid. The only changes I make is to omit the sugar and substitute garlic salt for the regular salt. I absolutely love it...cool and refreshing!

Great recipe.  I put Balkan style yogurt together with sour cream and some apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Excellent.

Very simple and easy and tasty, I like that a "bunch" of dill is left up to the discretion of the cook.  I do not care much for dill, so only used a teaspoon and it was good for me, you may like more.  Even better the next day and still crunchy, not mushy.  I added a small amound of diced onion the second time making it, very good, thanks!!

Really nice, refreshing salad that can be thrown together very quickly. It was good on its own but I added a splash of red wine vinegar because imo it needs a little extra tanginess. Will definitely make again though!

I have made this Pan-Slavic salad for 30 
years.  It is not just a Polish recipe but one that is common to many if not most Slavic cultures and countries. This recipe is just wrong. You need a heck of a lot more sour cream and you need white or salad vinegar.  2 and a half table spoons doesn't even begin to cut it.  Start with a cup and go for 2!  The vinegar is essential.  I use 2-4 tablespoons depending on the number and size of cukes.

You have everything you need here to make a good version of this dish, but you really have to tweak and taste to get it tasting right. Following the recipe initially, the dressing tastes of nothing but sour cream. It needs a lot more acid, and a tad more sugar, then it is really on point. Just a warning to folks who tend to follow a recipe exactly and then throw up their hands when it doesn't taste how they want. Adjust.

Changed recipe slightly - a bit more sugar and used yogurt instead of sour cream.

7 18 17 ... Somehow this managed to still taste rich with that little amount of reduced fat sour cream.  Good trick!  :D  I added 1/4t dill for fresh; subbed red wine vinegar for the lemon & only 1/2t; maybe that's how the richness is evident.  'Liked didn't love.  If I have excess cucs, I may try again.   :) I'm also going to try Sassy's

This is my go to recipe for cucumber salad. It is just like a recipe my grandmother made. It is so easy and delicious. Be sure to dry the cucumbers well after salting, this keeps any leftover from getting too runny.

Mine looked like the featured picture.  Used three English cucumbers...salted with about 1 1/2 Tablespoons salt for 10 minutes.  Drained in a colander, but did not dry off.  Doubled the dressing and sliced about a 1/4 Vidalia onion very thin.  Dill is sold in supermarkets as a "bunch".  But I only used half the package, chopped fine.  I used full fat sour cream and about a tsp sugar.  The lemon juice, sour cream mixture coupled with the salty cucumbers is a delectable salad.  I can't wait to serve it to guests tomorrow.

Very light and refreshing cucumber salad. I made this as written and it was good--very much like a polish cucumber salad you would find at a polish restaurant. I think this could use a small onion, thinly sliced. And...remember folks the recipe says black pepper to taste. So, do add enough black pepper to suit your taste preference.

This is a very good recipe...very refreshing on a hot summer day. I made it according to the instructions and it's very close to my mother-in-law's recipe from eastern Europe.
Thank you for sharing.

Very good. My family did not care for it to much but I thought it was delicious. I am a huge dill fan.
