I'm no expert cook but I'm South African ! Wonderful dish, I substituted the raisins ( eeuuww ! ) for canned sliced peaches & used the sweet juices instead of adding sugar. I like the adding of vinegar, gives it a nice sour to balance the sweet. Also I used 3 eggs & more milk for the topping. It is delicious !!
