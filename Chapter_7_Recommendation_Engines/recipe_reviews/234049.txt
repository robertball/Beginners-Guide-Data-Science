I haven't made this yet but know it will be a delicious dinner.  Hubs smoked a turkey breast this weekend so I've been looking for different recipes to use it.   This will be wonderful prepped, frozen and cooked in the crock pot on a day when I'm too busy to cook.  I'll get a picture of it for you when I do, thanks for the recipe.
