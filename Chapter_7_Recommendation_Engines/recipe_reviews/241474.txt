We loved, Loved LOVED these wings!!! i chickened out on the full amt of chipotle powder and used only 1/2 tbsp. next time i'll do 1.5 tbsp!  i love the sweet heat this recipe has to offer. i cooked mine just a little longer as i like the skin to be fully cooked and not too soft. will definitely make again and again! Thank you Chef V for and excellent recipe!

The baking time on these wings is way too long, thus they were over cooked and dry.  I cut the chipotle in half and it was quite spicy.  Someone else mentioned about the maple syrup burning ... you need to watch it carefully.
If I made these again I think I would bake at 350 and cut the time to at the most 20 minutes per side.

Okay so I did use chili powder, but HOLY COW these are so good! The crunch from the cornstarch is unreal. I would tell everyone to make these. Very addicting! Sweet and heat! Yum!

I made these following the recipe for a Super Bowl party.  10 lbs. of wings and they were gone! I will say they were very hot so if I increase the recipe again I will reduce the chipotle powder a bit, although the heat didn't stop anyone!

My family enjoyed these wings, first time I ever made homemade wings! I made 4 lbs of wings and reduced chipotle powder to 2 tbsps, will use 1 1/2 tbsps next time as I am a heat wimp. Baked on parchment paper lined sheets which makes for easy clean up!My son loves this recipes so much I have started using it on chicken drumsticks and thighs.

I made these tonight and they were so good! I didn't have dried chipotle powder and instead used dried Thai chili power. Otherwise, I did everything else exactly as written. Wow - I about burned my lips off but so good!

I've baked wingettes using this recipe, a few times in the last 6 months. Added a different spin this past Saturday for my Memorial day weekend BBQ. Barbecue! Give the Chipotle and other seasonings, a nice char to the bite of wings.

Simple and tasty! Just enough heat but tamed by the sweet glaze of the maple syrup. An easy go to with stuff already in my pantry.
