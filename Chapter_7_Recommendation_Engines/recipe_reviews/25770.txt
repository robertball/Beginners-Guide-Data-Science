the solution to the overly moist dough is that it is not 1 cup of milk. It should be 3/4 cup of sour cream.

This recipe does not work. The flour mixture will not form a dough, it is too moist. Something is wrong in the ingredients but I'm not sure what it is.

I agree with the other reveiwers. This recipe just doesn't work. I added more flour (about 3cups) and because of the excess flour you couldn't taste the chocolate at all. I through them all away. What a waste.

This recipe was horrible.  The amount of flour needs to be increased by about 3 more cups.  The dough was extremely sticky if you follow the recipe.  When my husband tasted the finished product he said it tasted like a pancake with no syrup.  I would not recommend this at all.

after following the recipe to the letter, there was no poosible way that these cookies could be rolled out. After adding a great deal more flour, they still could not be rolled out. I question the amount of milk (1 Cup) in the cookie.

After reading the reviews I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup for the cookie base and added 1 additional tablespoon of cocoa.  Cookies rolled out just fine and tasted delicious.

Absolutely the worst recipe.  This isn't a cookie.  I ended up trying to make a brownie out of it.  Baked it and NO TASTE at all.   Really shouldn't even get 1 star

This recipe is no good. Even using the 3/4 cup sour cream instead of milk, the dough was very sticky, and could not be rolled out. I added more flour, and it was still very sticky, but I got it to work.  But, the cookies have no chocolate taste to them! They do taste pretty good, lightly sweetened, and have a nice touch of coconut, but was certainly not chocolatey. I won't be making these again.
