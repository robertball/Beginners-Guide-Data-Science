This is one of the best recipes I have made from this site.  It is decadent and impressive for company, though not that involved.  I have made a few changes though it still comes out incredibly rich.  They are:  1) I omit tossing the bread cubes with melted butter--this much additional fat is unnecessary.  Just toss the bread cubes with the powdered mixture and sprinkle what doesn't adhere evenly over the cubes in the baking dish.  Then I sprinkle chips over bread--I've used both choc and white choc, but not cinnamon.  2)  I substitute evaporated skim milk for the cream.  3) I've never made the drizzle--though I'm sure it makes it look nice it is unnecessary.  After I made this once I was lookin' for opporunities to "bring dessert".  We couldn't get enough of it.  It's even better with a scoop of ice cream or a ladle of creme anglaise.

This is an incredibly good recipe. I'd recommend going light on the cinnamon drizzle on top, but altogether, it's SO good! There are a lot of steps involved, but it's worth it! Delicious!

This is the best bread pudding recipe I have ever had. And I have tried a few.  I use whole milk in place of the cream, 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of kisses and whatever bread I have on hand (including very dense whole wheat).  Everyone I have served this to loves it.

I love this recipe. It's not at all hard to make, in fact I think it's very easy. As stated before it is VERY rich. This recipe is also very good made with Hershey's Butterscotch Chips or Peanut Butter Chips (even richer). The Cinnamon Chips are not available in all grocery stores and can be hard to find. This dessert is great right out of the oven and reheats well also. I highly reccomend this!

P.S. As with any baking..make sure your eggs haven't expired or this could turn out a little runny.

too many things have to come together perfectly in order to prepare correctly; experienced about a 20% failure rate

I love this recipe!  Have now made it twice and it has been a huge hit both times.  I wasn't able to to find the cinnamon chocolate chips, so I just added a little cinnamon to the semi sweet chocolate chips.  And used Dark Chocolate for the topping.  I also prepared it (without the topping) and refrigerated a day ahead.

OMG...this has to be the best thing I've ever made and that's saying ALOT. I bake AT LEAST 3 different dessert type things a week, and I usually try to make it something new every time UNLESS it's something EXTREMELY good that my family loves. THIS is top of the list. I followed recipe exactly and it was perfect.   I'll be making this for sure for Thanksgiving, I know my whole family is going to flip out over it! I use this site on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day for years and have reviewed maybe 1-2 things....yet another testament to my love for this recipe!
