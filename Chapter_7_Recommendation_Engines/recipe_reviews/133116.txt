This was so delicious! I have to agree with the other commenter - I think it was too much salt. I understand that ceviche has to be salty to keep bacteria from growing, but this was pucker-your-mouth salty. Maybe just use 1 1/2 tbsp. instead of 2 1/2? That being said, this was a fantastic ceviche, very tasty. The fish "cooked" up just fine, and it was so easy to make. We used tilapia since it was cheaper.

Great recipe!  Thank you:)  As stated in previous review the salt is out of proportion.  I used the reviewers recommend 1/8 -1/4 tsp sea salt and Old El Paso Guacamole Mix for more kick and found it to be absolutley divine!

I made the recipe exactly EXCEPT used only 1/2 teaspoon salt, doubled the chili paste to 1 teaspoon and halved the olive oil (2 Tablespoons). It was perfect over spring mix salad greens and makes four one-cup servings. Definitely a keeper with great flavor. Hopefully everyone knows not to put as much salt as the recipe calls for or that will ruin it.

Love it, but way too much salt.  Is it a typo?  Found I could use almost defrosted wild salmon so have ready in freezer all the time!

I've got a hunch that the first 2 ingredients got swapped, and should instead be 1/4 tsp salt and 2 1/2 tbsp sugar.  I did it this way, and it was fantastic!

I made this a second time and reversed the sugar and salt quantities. AWESOME. Definitely a new favorite. I did salt to taste a little at the End to really make the flavors pop. But this is a fantastic dish.

I only give this 4 stars because I don't think salmon is a good choice of fish to use in ceviche. It was just a bit heavy and meaty for my taste. I have used a very similar recipe with tilapia and pollock resulting in a more delicate dish. This recipe is very good and I wouldn't hesitate to use a lighter fish with it. Unlike others, I found the salt content perfectly acceptable.

Be very careful with this recipe.  I really think the uploader meant to put teaspoon instead of tablespoon, either way I cut the salt in half and it still was extremely salty.

I added mango, peach and bell pepper as that is what the ceviche's I've had in the past used and it helped to absorb the salt.  All in all it's a great combination of flavors but the salt is overbearing.

CHANGE salt measurement, please! I made the mistake of not reading reviews before making this. Though I cut back to 1 1/2 Tb. salt (on a hunch that 2 1/2 could not be right), it was still way, way too salty. Fixed it by diluting with more lemon & lime juice. Appropriate amount is probably more like 1/4-1/2 tsp as others note. So to prevent future mistakes, could Sarah Zeigler please edit the recipe? Otherwise, it's divine! Agree with other reviewers who recommend alternative fish, if desired. Also nice to add diced green/red peppers.

We really liked this recipe.  I followed another reviewer and used flash frozen wild caught salmon from Trader Joe's.   it worked great. I used only 1 tablespoon of salt.  I actually thought maybe folks were not using sea salt.  I did and it was a little on the salty side with a tablespoon.  Secondly I will chop up the salmon next time instead of slicing.  It was just weird eating it sliced.  I also needed to use 1/4 of lime juice plus two extra limes.  A quarter cup was just not enough to "cook" the amount of salmon.   The taste was spot on and we enjoyed it.  Would like to try it with a lot less olive oil to see what happens.   Thanks for sharing.

Hopefully you won't be like me and you'll have read the reviews. I made this with 2.5 tablespoons of salt and it did not come out that great.

While I love salt, even I couldn't eat too much before having to take a break.

great recipe excepting the salt. Only use 1/2 teaspoon. The 2.5 tablespoons salt is obviously a typo.

Freakish amount of salt, not needed,nor typical of ceviche. Try teaspoons instead of table spoons. Try marinating in lime juice,salt, sugar. THEN DRAIN. MX WITH REMAINING INGREDIENTS AFTER.     Allow to meld flavor 15-30 min.
Hey, in Baja, we know ceviche. Trust me.

I have never eaten ceviche before. I still have never really tasted it because following this recipe it was TOO salty to eat. I will try again with maybe a quarter of the sea salt because it does seem very yummy!

Flavor is good just needs only 1/2 tbs of salt. I tried the recipe with only 2 tbs instead of the 2 1/2 tbs it asks for and it was way too salty.

i was so disappointed with this recipe.. i reduced the salt like other viewers suggested.. i think the only thing i left out was the cilantro b/c i didn't have any.. so if that was the deal breaker then that's my fault
