This ended up being a soft set consistency (which is perfect spoon bread) and was good but needs tweaking as it was a bit bland.

Next time I will add a more strongly flavored cheese (pepper jack) and a can of green chiles for some extra spice.

The texture and the flavor was PERFECT (be sure not to overbake this).  If you use the Jiffy corn bread mix which already had sugar in it, don't add more sugar!  The creamed corn will add additional sweetness and if you add more sugar it will taste like a dessert bread instead of a savory one.

This was really good but I did make a few changes.  I added 1/4 cup sugar and mixed the cheese in the batter instead of on top for last 10-15 mins.  I also used a casserole blend cheese rather than swiss. I was very pleased with the results.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me.  Thanks!

I made this for my company potluck and it was a huge hit.  I'm not a huge fan of Swiss Cheese with cornbread, so I used a mild cheddar, and I baked it into the bread instead of topping it.  It was amazing.

Super yummy, just a quick note, one time when I went to make this I was out of sour cream (DREAD!!!) but substitued with cottage cheese and it still turned out fabulous!  Goes well with enchiladas, chili, etc!

This is a fun recipe but it needs two modifications. First, don't add the cheese until after the whole thing is done. If you bake it for ten minutes with the cheese on top, it turns into a nasty hard cheese crust. Second, add some sugar. It needs a little bit of sweetness. I don't know how much, though.

I doubled the recipe and added a package of taco seasoning and small can of sliced black olives to give it a mexican zing. It was very good! Made it tonight with my baked seasoned pork steak.

Easy recipe. Definately needs sugar and I'm not so crazy about the whole kernel corn. Okay recipe but I'll keep looking.

I made a custom version of this recipe. I halfed the recipe because I am single and eat alone. I added chopped green chilies and some browned ground meat to the batter; added the cheese to batter and put cheese on top after it was done. Great meal which only needed a green salad to complete the meal.

Everyone loved this dish, especially my youngest daughter, who ate two large servings of this and almost nothing else.  Reminded me of corn cake from a southern californian mexican restaurant.  Very easy too!

I really really loved this, it exceeded my expectations. Very moist and hearty. Of the corn bread mixes they had in the store the one without chemical additives was only 7oz. I didn't think this hurt the bread at all, though it was a little softer than it could have been. It's already been requested again, thanks very much for sharing.

What a yummy discovery.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.  I leave out the whole can of corn and cheese.  I used 1 1/2 boxes of the jiffy corn muffin mix to equal 12oz. of corn bread mix.  Added a 1/3 cup of sugar. It's definately a keeper!

Yummy! I added a small can of diced mild chilies and I used sharp cheddar cheese. We LOVED it. especially the little guys. Great way to use up the last couple boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix and a can of cream corn--who dosen't have a couple boxes/cans of that in the way back of their pantry?

I doubled this, used frozen corn instead of the canned sweet corn (but used the can of cream style corn), skipped the cheese, baked it for a lot less time in well oiled muffin tins, and it turned out beautifully. Rave reviews with the whole family... served it with my Christmas ham and had no leftovers despite the fact that it made 24 large "muffins."

This was just alright to me.  I used lower fat versions of the ingredients but all in all it was just ok.  I probably won't be making again.

Hey, this was delicious, thanks! Even with the rough start (as I was preparing I found out I had too much creamed corn and not enough cornbread) this turned out great. I don't know why people want more sugar in this, it was perfect. I did use cheddar instead of swiss though as I dislike the bitterness of Swiss cheese, so maybe that's what others problem was. I thought it was great. A new comfort food -- just what I needed last night.

loved this!  i've been looking for something that tastes like the little dab of corn that Chevy's restaurant serves and this is really close.  i used pepper jack and mixed it right into the batter before I baked it.  took about 48 minutes to set to the consistency i wanted.  yummy!

This was really good! My husband also loved it. I used a sweet cornbread mix b/c that's they kind i usually use and it was great. I did not add cheese b/c i didn't have any and after eating it I don't think i would add cheese. Otherwise it's perfect the way it is, use a sweet cornbread mix for a yummy side dish! We had this w/ ribs.

it was fine.  with all of the rich incredients I expected a bit more...something.  Couldn't even hint at a taste of cheese-i did mix it in before cooking as suggested-will try again with some modifications.   Thank you for sharing.

I've never tried the cheese on this recipe because we like it without.  My son didn't like the texture, so the last time I made this I halved the amount of butter and sour cream and added a tablespoon of sugar.  Poured the batter into muffin tins and baked them until good and set, then I browned them under the broiler.  Served them up with chili and there were no complaints.  I like this recipe because it's a good base for either sweet or savory corn bread and it can be easily modified to taste.  Great submission.

I was looking for a spoon bread recipe after I tried some at a local Mexican restaurant, which was a sweeter kind than this one. I only sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top, about 2 minutes before the bread was done and it melted perfectly. I'll definitely make this again, but I'll add more Splenda next time. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and said he'd eat the bread by itself for dinner. Somehow though the bread was even better the next day and I didn't even warm it up!

I loved this dish.  My boyfriend ate the entire pan in a day.  I took out the swiss cheese and added 1/3 cup of white sugar for a sweeter taste and it was amazing.  Great recipe.

This was WONDERFULLLLLLLLL ... only I didn't add the cheese.  Not that I don't absolutely LOVE cheese but I figured I didn't need the extra calories and it was delicious even without it !!!  Thanks for another wonderful recipe on this wonderful site !

This was really good. I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss and I mixed it right into the batter. I like the texture and the flavor and like another reviewer, maybe I will add a little Splenda next time.

This was a super hit at the in-laws' Thanksgiving, my husband's favorite.  I easily threw it together that morning, and I should've made more!  I love cheese, so I added lots into the mixture, not just on top.  I also put a litte Cavendar's seasoning in the mix... DELICIOUS!!  Can't wait to impress people with this recipe again.

This was a great recipe, I was looking for something a little different from this but my children and husband loved this one.  I used 1 1/2 cups cornmeal mix and added 1/3 cup of sugar and omitted the cheese like one of the other reviewers.

My sister made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner - it was GREAT!!!  Loved by all and is a definite add to our traditional dishes!
She used a chesse blend as well and mixed it into the batter instead of putting it on top and also used a sweet cornbread mix!  GREAT RECIPE!

I think other reviewers probably eat too much sugar. This recipe is fine as is -- with one exception. I use colby jack or some other kind of cheese. Mix some into the mix and put some on top during the last few minutes. As someone who lives in a higher altitude you need to check the doneness. It's not consistant in these mountains :)

Been making this stuff for years and it's always delicious.  I prefer to skip the cheese and cut the butter in half, then bake for only 40 minutes.  Comes out very moist, just the way we like it.  Also use no -
salt corn and butter, and low fat sour cream.

Wonderful Tina! I only used a quarter cup of butter (not missed and not needed), a sweet corn bread mix, like NYC, I skipped the extra can of corn and as Dylansmom did I put the cheese into the batter rather than on top. My daughter Ashley's boyfriend rated this 20*****! Went great with our whole roasted chicken dinner tonight. Thanks so much!

Thank you for the inspiration.  This is a cross between the corn pudding my mom made when I was young and a rich corn bread. I made this and will review as 3.5 stars as is.  it has a consistency that was a little softer than desirable for me and was bland.  The cheese didn't add anything imho (and I love cheese).  However, it had the right amount of richness and the presentation was beautiful when cooked in an oven safe, non-stick pan.  Using this recipe as inspiration, I plan to continue tweaking as I will be preparing again because it has so much potential.

Delicious. And definitely doesn't need any more sugar. I like savory things and since I make the corn bread mix myself, I think I'll omit all the sugar next time. Sweet corn gives it all the sweetness a side dish needs.
