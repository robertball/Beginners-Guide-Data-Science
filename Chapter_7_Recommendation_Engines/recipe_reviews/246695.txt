Made as written except that I only used 3 cups of rice due to personal preference. This was very good but I did feel it lacked a little something so I added some Sriracha and that did the trick. Great recipe!

I used the recipe out of the magazine which called for ground pork, Everything went together just fine, and made enough for 4 servings. Since there are only 2 of us, we got 2 meals out of it. Second time was every bit as good as the first. Good flavors both times throughout. Will do this again.

yummy base recipe! I did change it up a bit though. I added 1 clove of minced garlic to the onion. Then I added a tsp of soy sauce and tsp of gochujang just before I added the rice. I also lightly scrambled my eggs, but that just a texture preference.
