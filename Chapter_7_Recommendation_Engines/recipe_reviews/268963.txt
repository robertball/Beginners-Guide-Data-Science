I used 11 guajillo chilies and boiled then simmered them and the bay leaves in about 6 cups of beef broth.  I place all in the blender including the onion till smooth.  Cut a 5lbs pork shoulder into 1" pieces and trimmed a majority of fat away from the meat.  I baked in a Dutch Oven @ 300 degrees for 3 1/2 hours and served over rice.  The guajillo chilies have a heat rating of only 3, so it is a mild stew.  Truly one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  I could not believe how delicious this turned out to be.  I let it chill overnight and skimmed the addition fat from the top the next day.  If this recipe was 10 stars I would give it it's just due!  I saved the excess chili broth and placed about 1 tbl in my scrambled eggs the rest of the week.  WOW

This is a great base recipe. I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for about 7 hours, and added a LOT of salt and a couple packets of Sazon seasoning. Yum!
