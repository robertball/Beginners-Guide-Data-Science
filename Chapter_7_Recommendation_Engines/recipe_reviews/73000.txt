I grew up on chicken adobo and hoped that the jalapenos would add some zip.  Didn't reall.  Also, I always find chicken gets pretty dried out with the excessive cooking times required.  Need to find an adobo recipe that keeps the great flavor without drying out the chicken.

Very tastey sauce.I use it to marinade the wings overnight, and grill or smoke them, bating with additional sauce.I also roast my garlic heads.

The chicken was very dry and I even doubled the liquid so it would cover most of the chicken in the pot. I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that it did smell very good.

AWESOME!  I did mine in a crockpot and by the end the chicken was so moist it pretty much fell right off the bone!  I shredded the meat and added it to a tortilla with some Louisiana Jalapeno Pepper Hot sauce - perfect!!  I cooked the chicken on high in the crockpot for the first couple of hours to get the chicken cooked then I turned it on low for the rest of the day.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I really enjoyed the flavors and it made my kitchen smell delicious. I actually used the marinade on chicken breasts instead of wings and it was SO good! I am looking forward to making the wings soon.

I love the way Filipino Adobo meets Buffalo Wings!!! I got turkey wings and put them in the pressure cooker for 10mins then cooked them as directed. Superb!!!

I've made many chicken wings and I've made adobo but because I've never combined the two, I chose to make exactly as written. Boil the wings first? What would be the point of this? I went ahead and did it and I'm not exactly sure what goes on in that process but what I do know is that I will be doing it from now on when I make buffalo wings. The skin got SO crispy and delicious. These wings were really good and had excellent flavor. My only complaint is that they did get overdone. I think the cook time could be reduced and yet still get the full flavor of the recipe .
