I made this with a blend of white, brown, and wild rice that I had. I also used half golden raisins and half dried cranberries. I substituted in shallots for scallions because that is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

A very good flavor, nothing overpowering, subtle without being boring.  Followed recipe exactly as written, except I didn't add the salt.  I'm not a fan of curry, but it works well in here.   I'll make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  used the oven method and it turned out perfect.  I want to experiment with saffron, slivered toasted almonds and a few more veggies next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Great dish with lots of flavor! I love the combination of curry with golden raisins and the crunch of celery. I would like to say DO NOT add salt if you are using regular chicken broth. It comes out salty enough. Also I doubled the number of raisins to cut down on the saltiness.

I changed the recipe a little to make it more efficient and to use fewer dishes, but the flavors were good.

The rice was very good and slightly sweet from the raisins, the curry made the taste complex without it being "too curry". I made this dish to go with a maple/soy salmon. I made a few changes: I used coconut milk instead of water, although I still added a bit of powder chicken broth. I also used Basmati rice and  a sprinkling of sliced almonds to add crunchiness.

I am always on the lookout for interesting rice dishes, so, I thought I would give it a try.   We really enjoyed the flavor, but, I do think it was too much celery for our taste.  Next time I would only use half the amount of celery. I did cut the recipe in half since it makes a large batch.  This would be a great side dish with poultry or fish.   I did completely forget to add the raisins!  If you don't like raisins this would be great substituting dried cranberries instead.

Loved this rice dish!  I did add a bit more curry but other than that it was very good.  It makes alot so we  have lots of leftovers.  Will definitely will make again.

Great recipe as it is super flavorful and easy to put together!!
The only modification I made was to use orzo pasta and rice  half and half just for fun and add chopped zucchini to all the rest of the veggies.

Fantastic!! and thanks for sharing this one Rhapsody!  Chris  jazz cook Ho

I didn't have green onions, so I just used a whole regular onion instead of 1/2 of one.  I also didn't have fresh celery, so I used frozen mirepoix blend vegetables, which includes diced onions, celery, and carrots).  Thennnnn, I forgot to remove the vegetables from the skillet before adding the rice, so I just ended up cooking it all in the same pot.  I added a lot more curry powder to give it more of an Indian flavor and slivered almonds at the end.
