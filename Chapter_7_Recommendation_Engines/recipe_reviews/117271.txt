This recipe was easy to make and tasted great, but there are two problems you should know about before baking.  First, the stated bake time was a bit too long for me. I wouldn't go longer than 15 or 20 minutes per side; some of mine were burnt, and I even cut mine into larger pieces (8 wedges per potato) than the recipe recommends.  Second, this recipe can leave behind a hard-to-clean mess on your pan if you aren't careful. I greased my pan (which is already non-stick) but perhaps not enough; I still can't get some of the potato-wedge marks off my pan. Next time I think I'll use lightly oiled parchment paper to avoid this problem, although oiled foil as others have tried may work as well. (Don't use waxed paper; it will burn in the oven.)  Other than that, aside from cutting my wedges slightly larger (8 per potato, not 12), I added about 1/4 tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp onion powder for extra flavor. I also used olive oil instead of canola.  All things considered, this recipe is easy to make and tastes great--just be sure to watch the bake time and potential cleanup issues.

I love these oven fries. I only made a couple of small changes. I cut the potatoes into 8 wedges instead of 12 to make the oven fries a little more substantial. Instead of salt, I used Lawry's seasoned salt. Delicious served plain, with ketchup, or topped with turkey chili and jalapeno slices. For easy clean up, I covered my baking sheets with aluminum foil and sprayed the foil with cooking spray so they wouldn't stick.

Yum!  Used olive oil and seasoned salt instead of canola oil and regular salt, rest the same. 40 mins total plenty.

Note to self: Do not make these with Yukon Gold potatoes when baking potatoes are specifed in the recipe and expect them to turn out crispy.  They taste like a million bucks.  But they're not crispy.

These are fabulous - my husband and kids gobbled 'em up before dinner was even ready! No ketchup needed, they were yummy right off the baking sheet.  My oven must run hot though because I only needed 15 minutes on each side and they were perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

Very tasty and simple to prepare. The recipe can be altered to pair with any main dish with a simple seasoning/spice change or addition. I cut about 10 minutes from the suggested baking time. For a crispier potato finish in the broiler with a light sprinkle of parmesian cheese (1-2 minutes). For easy clean up definetely line baking sheet with foil.

The amount of seasoning was just right. I substituted olive oil for canola oil and added some paprika. I didn't have the pan that the recipe called for, so I used a metal pizza pan, covered it with foil, then coated it with non-stick cooking spray. My husband and I finished everything!

Very nice, but needed some additional flavourings for our family. I placed the potato wedges in a plastic bag, added 1 tsp of minced garlic, 1/2 tablespoon salt, 1/2 tblspn onion powder, 1/2 tblspn dried mixed italian herbs, 1/2 tsp mild paprika. The minced garlic provides enough liquid to coat all the potatos. I have also frozen some in a separate bag because the potatos I would make a handy snack.

I added more garlic powder and some onion powder as well.  Could have even used a bit more but was pleasantly surprised with flavor.  I turned the broiler on for the last few minutes to crisp them up a bit more as well.

Here's a GREAT tip - whenever I make these potatoes, I use Reynolds Wrap Non-Stick foil.  You don't need to grease or spray, and NOTHING sticks to it.

This recipe was awesome! Like some of the others, I used seasoning salt instead of regular, but kept everything else the same. I will continue to play around with the spices a bit. After cutting the wedges, I soaked them in cold water for about 15 min to remove some of the starchiness and keep them crispy. Worked like a charm! Just make sure to pat them dry before adding the oil & spices. I covered my pan with foil and sprayed with nonstick spray and had zero problem with them sticking. Will definitely be a staple recipe for my family from now on.

Fantastic! Used olive oil, added some Creole seasoning, paprika and jarred garlic with some of the juice. Threw into my nuwave flipped once. Probably cooked about 20 minutes total. Rubbed the oil mixture on a pre-cooked chicken breast and cooked with the fries. Great quick meal! I can see I will be doing this a lot!

I made this using one large russet potato for Hubs and me.  I cut my potato into eight wedges, added a little paprika to the other seasonings, and baked these in a cast iron skillet.  I baked these at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes, flipping them half way through.  We both liked these!

I was only making for two people so I just used a couple of russet potatoes that I scrubbed and cut into wedges. This was easy to prepare. I seasoned as instructed, baked at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, flipped it over and baked another 25 minutes. The wedges were seasoned just right. Not crispy enough even thou I baked it according to directions. They were already turning dark brown on the edges when I flipped it over to cook on the other side so I took it out right before it reached 26 minutes. It had a subtle slight crunch on the outside and inside was soft. Tasted good and my family liked it.

These smelled amazing while cooking and were very easy to prepare. Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the potatoes into 8 wedges, which was a good size. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and increased the amount and still think I could have added more. I baked at 400 degrees because I was also baking salmon and checked them after 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes, and finally 10 more minutes. This was perfect. I will definitely make these again, but I think I will be a little more adventurous with the spices.

Made these tonight for family.  Came out great!  We used smaller potatoes and cut them into 12 wedges.  Cooked for 15 minutes on each side.  Smaller wedges were crispy and bigger ones were so soft in middle.  We dipped them in honey mustard instead of same ole' same ole' ketchup.  Wonderful!

WOW!! I made these last night (I used olive oil as I didn't have canola) and my whole family LOVED them! So simple! I made a pork roast & wanted something different for the side (instead of mashed potatoes). I lined my pans with aluminum foil & sprayed the heck out of it with cooking spray. The wedges came off super easy. I made 2 pans, I had 10 wedges left over. I reheated them, in the oven, today and they are even more awesome the next day! I felt guilty having them with a pork roast, but they turned out better than my roast. I ALWAYS follow the recipe to a tee the first time (except for the oil this time). Then if I want to alter it, I will the next time. I won't have to with this one! I was told to add it to my weekly supper rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely crispy and tasty, and gone within minutes!  Twenty minutes on each side was perfect for beautiful, golden-brown fries.  Will make again and again!

Just to clarify things for those who get frustrated over all the proposed changes in the reviews: I made NO changes to this recipe and they were GREAT. 
When making these you should definitely cover the pan in tin foil to make your life easier.

These wedges taste delicious and just like what you would get in a restaurant.  The only problem is that they take a very long time to get crispy, sometimes more than an hour.  Worth the wait, but sometimes it makes it difficult to time things right with a meal.

Mine were more "sticks" than "wedges"...and they tasted great!  I'm sure that using just garlic powder, s&p would yield tasty results, too but I did add paprika and adobo seasoning for some extra tastiness.

Simple and straightforward.  They cooked "peel-side down" thus alleviating any need to flip them.  They browned very nicely.  A great base recipe--add seasonings to taste.

I've been making oven fries for years and who knew I needed a recipe? Seriously, how hard can they be? BUT this recipe proved me wrong. The proportions are perfect. I will always  make my oven fries with this recipe now. Thanks for passing this along!

These were really good oven fries.  They came out nice and crispy.  I didn't miss frying them a bit.  I will be making these again I think next time I will add a little more seasoning though.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Pretty good! As other reviewers said, I think it would be fun to experiment with adding more flavor to these with whatever happens to be in the kitchen, but they were pretty tasty as is. Instead of tossing all the ingredients in a bowl, I drizzled the oil on each side and then added the salt, pepper, and garlic powder before baking on either side. Smothered in ketchup, these were great! So they will definitely show up on our table again.

Delicious... my entire family hoovered them up, without leaving a scrap behind.  I admit that I didn't measure anything -- just drizzled the oil on the potatoes (I used olive oil), and generously dusted with garlic powder and salt, then ground black pepper over the whole shebang.  I'll make these again and again and again.  Thanks!

Made as stated in recipe except cut potatoes into 8 slices each and baked 20 minutes on each side.  Really easy to make.   Next time I might cut back on the pepper and add some other seasonings like rosemary or paprika etc.  Easy to make with whatever you're feeling at the time.  I used a non stick pan and had no big mess, the pan was very easy to clean up.  Next time will follow some reviews that broiled a few minutes at the end.

Added a little paprika to the oil mixture to give some color.  Baked for nearly 35 minutes to get them crispy.

This was great to go with hamburgers we had tonight, but the only thing I would change is how much pepper was added, due to the fact that I'm not allowed to have spicy things.

I made these with the baking potatoes as suggested and thought they were okay, a little dry.  Later in the week I made them again using regular table potatoes and liked the texture much better.  I only cut into 8s and cooked for 10 min per side.

Try adding a little cayenne pepper powder if you like a little heat. I have been making baked potato wedges for years and try something new all the time and my husband and I love spicy food.

I served this with AR's "Smoky Chipotle Meatloaf" and they were a good combo together (or so I hear). I also roasted some baby carrots right on the same pan with these potatoes, sharing the spice mixture, and that worked out deliciously. This is a mildly-flavored "fry", suitable for dipping in ketchup or other sauces, with very little fat. Be sure and flip them halfway through, and if there are any dry spots, spray them with cooking spray to encourage crisping & browning. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my gosh! These wedges were so good! Crispy as promised on the outside but so soft and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. I couldn't stop eating them. I did broil my fries for the last few minutes because I wanted them a bit extra crispy. I will be making these very often! Thanks so much for sharing!

Truly simple but ever so tasty. Followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. I personally may cut back a bit on the garlic next time, but it wasn't overpowering. Thanks for a really great recipe for oven fries.

I liked these, my husband really liked them. They could use more spices. We're both doing Weight Watchers, and this made a nice side for our turkey burgers.

Simple and tasty :) A great recipe. I didn't have a non-sticking spray on hand, so, I put one more tbsp of olive oil and baked the potatoes.

These were great taters! I ended up making far too many of them so I just put them into a container and stored them in the fridge uncooked. For some reason the potatoes didn't even discolor! Great recipe.

Love the flavour!  These have turned out great every time I've made them.  I've tried doubling the garlic, adding seasoning salt, and microwaving them for a 2-3 minutes to speed up the baking time in the oven.

First time making these I stuck to the written recipe. Second time around I used olive oil, added paprika, rosemary and a dusting of cayenne pepper once they were in the pan. I think the cayenne gave this dish some zing that was lacking in the original recipe. I usually substitute sea salt for regular table salt as I think it imparts a better flavor and I did with this dish, as well. As others have noted, this recipe is very versatile and can  be changed as per individual tastes or occasions. A winner in my view!

Heck yes!  But make it even better:  Add more garlic, perhaps other herbs and then some bread crumbs mixed with a little parm cheese for the tossing routine.  Roast as indicated.  Why don't I make these more often?  I can always afford the 45-50 mon mecessary to roast them.  Shame on me and they are a lot tastier than plain bolied potatoes.

This was easy to prepare and it was delicious. Some are suggesting not to use Yukon Gold because the potatoes will end up mushy; that was all I had on hand and wound up letting them drain onto paper towels. By the time dinner came around, they were crisp on our plates.

Great recipe! I baked at 400 degrees and added dried rosemary. I also used olive oil instead of canola. Definitely line your cookie sheet with foil. I added a little olive oil cooking spray to the pan to prevent from sticking. Yummy!

Great recipe.  I cut my potatoes into 8 wedges and was glad I did.  We liked the larger ones better.  They crisped up very nice.  I also added a little cajun seasoning.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These tasted great, much better than the frozen ones you can get. Per others suggestions, I made sure to use aluminum foil to avoid a mess and I watched the time closely. Mine were crisp and ready to eat in about 30 minutes. I also used olive oil in place of canola oil.

Seriously yum!! My family loved these. I cut each potato into eight pieces, used seasoned salt instead of regular, and added paprika to the spice mixture. I served with broiled chicken and broccoli and they were a hit.

I made thes tonight and they were delicious.  I added a little chile powder when I tossed them in the spices. Before I put them in the oven it tossed them with a little canola oil.  I cooked them in a pan with aluminum foil on it-- greased the foil.  15 minutes per side is the best.  They really are delicious!

Like some other reviewers, I cut my potatoes into 8 wedges.  I also used olive oil instead of canola oil, but I kept the other ingredients the same.  I baked on each side for 20 minutes and it wasn't super crispy, which was perfect for what I was looking for.  You might want to go longer if you're looking for a really crispy wedge.  I topped with Mexican cheese, bacon bits (from actual bacon, not from a bag) and diced jalapenos.  So good!!!

Very good potato fries! I also cut them into 8 instead of 12 to prevent burning, but I think 12 would probably have made them more "fries"-like. I was very liberal with the seasoning, and added paprika and onion powder as well. About 15 minutes on each side is good, and the last 5 minutes I did turn on the broiler because I was also cooking steaks. It's hard to mess these up--just keep checking to avoid blackening!

Mediocre.  I'll probably cut the wedges thinner next time.  And I cooked them for much longer than the forty to forty five minutes and didn't feel they were very crispy.

very good and easy.  I used olive oil and added all kinds of spices.  Don't limit yourself to just salt, pepper and garlic powder.  And start early since these take almost an hour to bake.  Cover your pan with aluminum foil AND spray the foil with cooking spray.

My soldier sons chow down on these! I add 1/4 cup of the following mix: corn meal, dried Italian herb blend, garlic salt and grated Parmesan cheese for the seasoned coating. There always seems to be an extra "battle buddy" or two at the table whenever these are on mom's menu.

Loved these. They were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I didn't measure out the seasonings, just sprinkled in until everything was well covered. Yummy will make these again. Way better than frozen wedges.

these were very easy and healthy. i agree w/ the other reviewers who baked 15 mins each side then broiled for a few mins to crisp up. i added onion powder. they needed more salt. next time i will try adding cajun seasoning. served these w/ bierocks(german meat turnovers) and a sour cream/mayo/ horsey dipping sauce. these will be made regularly.

Yum, these were great. Will definitely make again.  Now I don't have to spend $4 a bag for fries, I will buy my potatoes on sale and make them at home.

Great! My fiance is very picky about fries, but he loved these. I put them on broil for about 4 minutes to make them crispy. Delicious!

O. My gawwd. I did it again. I put potatoes under wax paper to save on clean up on my pans. DON'T DO IT!!!!! Luckily they still turned out well. The directions about cutting the potatoes were very vague..12 slices?!? Mine ended up all different lenghs and thicknesses..I'll have to work on that. My baking time was also got srewed up. My dad was supposed to get home I thought at 3:30-45, but got home at 3:10. So I panicked and broiled them. Ahh well; again, they were a hit. ~~Also added paprika for color an hotness. THANKS!!! Look forward to perfecting my skills to those you see in restaurants/grocery stores [[jojos]].

Fantastic! These were SO GOOD. I used a bit more garlic powder and had to adjust the cooking time, but obviously the size and thickness of your wedges make a difference. Great flavor, super crispy on the outside, perfectly fluffy on the inside, and super easy to throw together. Thank you for the great recipe! :)

These were very good...I should've taken them out of the oven a bit sooner though.  Next time I'll keep an eye on them better so they don't burn.

These are a hit with my family.  I cut the potato length-wise into wedges, 8-12 per potato.  Also added Janes Krazy Mixed-up Salt and a dash of cayenne Pepper.  Put the potatoes in a plastic bag, added seasonings and oil, gave it a good shake and then onto the cooky sheet.  I will use this recipe again.

Did exactly as the recipe called for and the boyfriend and I were thrilled with the results!  A much healthier alternative to deep frying french fries, the wedges can be baked to be as crispy on the outside as you want really.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These were excellent. I am not usually a fan of potato wedges but these were so crispy and tasty. I used seasoning salt.

Wanted an alternative to baked, twice baked or tater tots for steak dinner...this was so good and easy to prepare! Following hints from others, I used olive oil, seasoned salt and then for my family's tastes, added garlic powder & onion powder. I put parchment paper on my pan, then sprayed with non-stick so clean up was easy!

I strongly recommend using medium-size baking potatoes and spicing up the seasoning with a little red pepper. We loved these with battered pan fried shrimp!

Very nice recipe - I used olive oil and some Cajun seasoning.  Plus parchment paper for anything baked, for no stick and even browning.  Something that is always on my shelf.  Good recipe, a keeper.

We LOVE these potatoes! My husband requests these now instead of baked potatoes because they taste great without all the added sour cream and butter. We've seriously made these five or six times since we discovered them a few weeks ago. They're really good as is if you like spicy, but if I make them for the kids I only use half the pepper called for.

These were so good!  I baked them on a cookie sheet covered with foil and they came out perfect.  The time was shorter like other reviewers noted.  I baked some extra wedges in a 13x9 glass pan, and they didn't crisp up as nice and seemed to take longer. I will make this recipe again and again.

I thought this was a good recipe.  These turned out better than any potato wedges I've made before.  I reduced the time by 10 minutes after turning them, b/c they were getting overdone.

I cut some into 8 pieces and some into 12. I baked them on my Pampered Chef stone and they came out beautifully! No sticking or scraping.

The recipe was average, there was nothing special about the wedges. It would have been better if I had combined other spices along with the garlic powder. I'm not sure if I would try this again but next time I'd definitely bake them longer so they would be crispy. I baked mines at 400 degrees F for 40 minutes while rotating them so they would cook evenly. It wasn't long enough for me.

Both my boyfriend and I thought it was just average and there definitely could be room for improvement.

This technique is good. Be careful not to over-season! The recipe calls for very little seasoning and it doesn't look like enough. IT IS!! Also, I think the final cooking time is a little long. My potatoes started to burn after about 15 minutes on the second side. 
I served them with a mixture of sour cream and Lawry's seasoning as a dip and everyone LOVED them!

I have been making these for years..for everyday family meals and for special guests...everyone loves them. Sometimes I top them with cheddar or monterey jack cheese and broil for 3-4 min.  This is great for a grill night too.

I use olive oil, a generous sprinkling of paprika,and a dusting with Italian blended seasoning.  Definitely spray the pan or the potatoes will stick.  These are sooo much better than store-bought fries.

Delicious, but I didn't really follow the recipe, just used it for a basic idea.  I cut my potatoes into 12 wedges, used olive oil, and then I used the spice mixture from "Spicy Chicken Breasts" from this site plus a little extra cumin.  They didn't exactly turn out crispy but they are so ridiculously good.

Awesome flavor and texture!  I followed recipe exactly, adding Simple Ranchy Breaded Fish Fillets (from this website) to the pan for the last 20 minutes of baking.  Easy, healthy and tasty meal.  Thanks.

Try Seasoned Pepper to give it a fantastic flavor.  McCormick makes a pepper blend of red and black pepper.  Only takes a little pinch.

I made it for two so I used 2 potatoes. I didn't measure the ingredients, just sprinkled them on each potatoes. I also added onion powder and rosemary. No need to turn them because they are standing on their skin side.

Excellent! I left out the pepper and added some paprika for color. I was also short on time so I cut them and halfway cooked them in the microwave before tossing them in the oil and cooking them in the oven which took about 15 minutes.

So easy and so yummy.  I only really followed this recipe for the oven temperature, as I made a few changes.  I cut the potatoes into quarters and then sliced from there, so I got a large number of wedges out of each potato.  I put my silicone baking sheets on two of my pans, placed the potatoes in one layer, brushed with olive oil, then sprinkled one pan with cajun seasonings and the other pan with salt and pepper.  I baked for about 25 minutes, then flipped the potatoes, brushed on olive oil and sprinkled with the same seasonings and cooked another 20 minutes or so.  Some of the thinner pieces were almost like potato chips as they got nice and crispy.  Very good and so simple.

Unless I did something majorly wrong, no one liked the taste of these.  Maybe if I used a different kind of potato, but these fries had a big "potato" taste to them and we didn't like it.

These were amazing after I made a few small changes.  First, I made fries instead of wedges, which allowed more flavor on each piece.  Next, I used EVOO instead of canola oil and I used a little more than the recipe called for.  Also, I added oregano and onion powder.  Finally, make sure you turn these over halfway through the bake time (like the recipe calls for).  I neglected to do so and I browned the bottoms significantly more than the tops.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

These are very good for not being fried or soaked in grease.  I tossed the potato wedges with olive oil, Mrs. Dash's, garlic powder, salt, pepper.  Lined the pan with aluminum foil and sprayed it with Pam.  I used our convection oven setting, which made the cooking go faster--a total of 30 minutes.

These were very good!  I was a little reluctant to try this recipe because the last time I tried to make wedges they were so bland and not crispy.  After reading the reviews I decided to give these a shot.  MUCH better than last time!

Pretty good.  Not overly flavorful, but still tasty (I'd suggest adding more Krazy Janes salt and italian seasonings).  If you want to be able to bake them at 350 degrees with other food, boil the wedges first for 5-10 minutes in salt water, then toss them with the oil and seasonings and spread on foil-lined cookie sheet.  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  (I also switched it to the broiler for 3 minutes after baking to make them crispier).  Whole family enjoyed them served with ketchup and sour cream for dipping.

AWESOME!  I cut them up into more fries size and just sprinkled all the seasoning on, didn't measure it.  I didn't have canola oil, so I used olive oil.  But, the seasonings together and the bake time was perfect!  I'll make these again for sure!

Wow very delicious.  My family wanted more!   Few changes I made: I chopped then boiled the potatoes before I seasoned them so after they are baked, theyre super soft inside.  I added salt and pepper as well as cayenne pepper, a bit of flour and very finely chopped garlic because I didn't have garlic powder.   And for the dip: ketchup + a few drops of worcestershire sauce. VERY good.

I modified this recipe to suit my taste buds.  I used red potatoes instead of the baking potatoes.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper and on the second batch I was little heavy handed with it. 3 tablespoons of oil. I used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder *heaping* and baked at 425 for 35 minutes.  Came out great! It kind of stuck a little bit to the pan, but the boyfriend and I both loved it a lot.  Thanks for recipe!

Great -- more like oven fries than wedges because of the small size-- I think size is the key to crispiness though and these are nice and crispy! I did use peanut oil. Thanks for a great recipe!

this recipe was very good.  i did use olive oil and cut the potato in smaller wedges.  i seasoned it more with seasoning salt and added parsley for color.  i turned it a few times so it wouldn't stick.  it turned out brown and crispy - and very yummy!!!!!!

These potatoes are very good!  I did add some seasoning salt and used olive oil instead.  It was tasty and would definitely make it again.

A big hit in our house.  My kids loved them.  I used seasoned salt as suggested by others.

These were very good potatoes, but I thought they were a little bland.I'll probably try a different mix of seasonings. My fiance thought they were delicious, and in the end thats all that matters.

I made these potatoes and a chicken wing recipe I found here for a Sunday game get togrther. Shoulda made more!! Of both. I used "spicy" season salt since the wings were not. Nice little addition. Also try greek or cajun seasoning.

This was excellent! I made this to go along with our first try at turkey burgers...we didn't like the turkey burgers, but we went nuts over the potato wedges! It's so easy and quick to prep! I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. We'll make this again!

These were really good. I also used olive oil as we do not have canola oil. My french fry eating 5 year old liked them too!

Mine stuck to the pan very badly.  Maybe I have a bad oven but these did not turn out great at all.  They were mushy and falling apart.

These were so good!  My only regret was that I didn't make more.  I used the seasonings as stated but used olive oil instead of canola oil.  I shortened the cooking time by about 10 mins, and I baked on a pizza stone.  I will definitely make these again.

I did not enjoy this recipe. When following the recipe exactly, there was too much oil, not enough taste, and the heat was too high. I tried it a second time and it would still burn.  I tried it a third time with the tin foil idea and the potatoes stuck to the foil. I ended up just throwing all three batches away.

Very crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I used seasoned salt and my girls gobbled them up!

These were really good, a big hit with the family, especially the kids,  I added some sliced carrots with the potatoes, and served them with my meatloaf.
