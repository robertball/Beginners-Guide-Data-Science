These were great- a really good way to use up bananas.  I slit the bananas length wise otherwise all the glaze just ran off and sat in the bottom of the pan.  Anything that is left in the pan would be great over vanilla icecream!

I cut this down to 1 serving and the same cooking time worked fine. Used unsalted macadamias, and their flavor went well with the bananas. I don't like the slight tang that's either added by the sherry or the orange juice, though. Brown sugar Splenda (1/2 of the amount called for in the recipe) worked fine. This looks beautiful and elegant - worth a try!

I used flaked coconut instead of nuts, which was good.  I would suggest using about half of the other ingredients, just because there was so much extra liquid leftover.  Overall, very good...I will definitely make again.

I love this recipe and so does everyone else I have made it for so far.  This is a recipe with bragging rights because it is tasty and healthy!  I like to use pinapple juice on mine and add a little bit of coconut butter on top of the bananas before I pour the brown sugar mixture over mine.  They are an exciting treat everytime!

This was okay and different. Following the recipe exactly makes a-lot of sauce that would be great on top of ice cream or a bread pudding. The banana's don't need as much sauce. Overall this was a good rich dish that my party guests liked okay.

Very fun and fast.  Next time I may even try plantains and make this a side dish.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made some changes to this. I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg, to give it more of a sweet flavor. Follow the recipe just like it says, just sprinkle cinnamon instead. Also, instead of nuts, I crumbled up a pumpkin flax granola bar. Obviously, you don't have to brown the granola, just melt the butter, stir in the pumpkin flax granola, and spoon over the banana before baking. It was wonderful!!! The different flavors really came together well to give a wide bouquet of tastes. My dinner guest were uber impressed, and my better have suggested serving it with vanilla or caramel ice cream, but as I am Lactose intolerant, Ill pass :)

Very sweet and the nuts are a very good compliment.
