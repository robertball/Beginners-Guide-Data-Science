One glance at the simplicity of these ingredients and I knew it was going to be a winner.  We used flank steak which I marinated for, oh, a good 5 or 6 hours.  Gave it a quick sear, a nice rest, and then sliced on the bias.  We served with avocado, grilled onions, and Pico de Gallo with refried beans and Mexican Rice on the side.  Simple, filling and absolutely delicious!  Thank you so much for recipe.  UPDATE:  I just had to pop in to reiterate how much we love this marinade!  We make it at least once every couple of weeks.  Thanks again!

This recipe has  an excellent marinade for the beef. It turned out full of flavor. The only thing I added were big onion slices and red pepper when I was cooking the meat. Omitted the salsa and cheese because the meat and veggies had so much flavor I didn't think this fajitas needed anything else.

Good basic lime fajita marinade. If you don't a like lime, garlic, and cilantro combination then you shouldn't make it. 

Instead go spend a buck on a fajita marinade packet at the grocery store that will taste like taco seasoning! 

The only reason I took a star away from the recipe is that if your going to use a good cut of beef such as New York Steak, marinate the steak before slicing, grill the steak to your personal preference, and then slice thinly on the bias and against the grain.

I made this exactly as instructed, it was just delicious! Served with sauteed strips of red and green bell pepper and onions. I just couldn't have been better.  I think it will be in the weekly rotation of meals.

I made these with tender sizzler steaks cut by our butcher and they turned out great.  The only change I made is omitted he pepper and added chipotle chili powder.  The flavor was great.

This was so delicious, just the flavor profile I was looking for.  I used two N.Y. strip steaks sliced thinly, marinated in mixture as per recipe, but used only 1 t of cumin - that was the only change in the marinade.  After marinating steak in fridge for about 6 hours I sauteed the meat in the same pan in which I'd sauteed a sliced red onion and a yellow bell pepper.  Added fresh cilantro before serving in flour tortillas with shredded jack cheese and sour cream.  Omitted the salsa.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I used skirt steak, marinated it overnight then grilled it & sliced it. These were the best tasting fajitas I have ever had! Our dinner guests were beside themselves. This is the only way to make fajitas!

This is, quite simply, one of the best meals we've ever had in our house!  I didn't have onion so omitted that, and didn't look in time so only marinated it for about 15 minutes.  Amazing!! Thank you!!

It turned out really good. I added half an Anaheim chili and half a bell pepper to the mix along with some chipotle seasoning to add some more kick.

Made this tonight. Tasty but a bit too limey... although we didn't marinate it overnight. Good flavor but might be really good on fish too. Going to try half the amount of lime juice next time.

I made this exactly how the recipe stated, I was a little concerned that the meat would be too tough, but it was good tenderness, I just bought pre packaged fajita meat.   Pretty good flavor, not sure if I would make this again. I didn't want it for leftovers the next day, but it was alright. I was really trying to copy Chili's restaurant's fajitas, it was pretty close, but I feel like it needed some different flavors.

Really good.  Used ribeye instead of strip steak and wished it would have been more tender.  Marinade was excellent.  Cooked with onion, red and yellow peppers.  Will make again.

This recipe is great only because of the marinade...which is the most important part.  Prepared exactly as indicated, and my steak strips turned out delicious!  I had low quality steaks that I did not like, so I tried this & so glad I did, the meat was actually moist & flavorful.  I cooked the meat with red & green bell peppers, and red onion.  My fixings included:  Shredded lettuce, fresh tomato, shredded cheese, sour cream.  I recommend using corn tortillas instead of flour.

I added 2 tablespoons chili powder to my marinade. I didn't have a fresh lime so I used two tablespoons of bottled lime juice. Use sirloin steaks and broiled them in the oven with an onion cut in wedges and separated in strips, and green and red peppers cut in strips.  I moved the pan close to the flame the last few minutes to char everything a little.  Marinating overnight made the meat so tender. Very good!

This was very quick and easy to make. I will never use a packaged dry fajita mix again. There was not one bite left in the pan.This is a permanent family recipe from now on. It would just as well with chicken I would think. We put it on rice, not totillas.

This is a terrific recipe! I used stew meat, just what I had on hand, and added a sliced onion and red pepper to the meat after it had cooked for 3 minutes. Served with sour cream,  avocado and shredded cheese...tortilla chips on the side. Delicious!

I made two changes. I used garlic-onion salt. And I used sharp cheddar cheese. I used my food saver to marinate the meat a couple of hrs.  I will be making this again.

I made this with leftover steak, so no marinade, just heat and eat and we both loved it. I did cook frozen peppers and onions with it.

I lived in Houston, TX for 13 years and I had my fair 
 Share of Tex Mex food..  These Fajitas  are as flavorful as it can be ! My beef was little bit tough and it might have been because  of using Sirloin steak instead of New York Strip,  or because I only marinated the slices  for couple of hours ? The lime didn't have enough time to tenderize the meat.. I like my fajitas with slices of onions and peppers,  so I sauteed some in the skillet and set aside till the beef was cooked , then I put them back in. Served in tortillas, with homemade guacamole,  sour cream and Mexican cheese.

This was a good marinade.  I think if I would have used it on a different type of meat (used tenderized round steak) I would have liked it better.

Have been making this recipe for over a year now and everyone loves it. We don't like cilantro in our house and that's the only ingredient I skip from the marinade. And we do our own toppings once it's cooked such as avocado, grilled veggies, etc and no salsa. Don't skip the onion, or the lime, it is all really good together.

I made this with a beef tip roast and let it marinade over night. It was very tender. I made no changes and would definitely make this again.

I made this as it was written and it was phenomenal!!!    I took the meat out of the pan as soon as the pink was gone and added all of my peppers and onions to sear, then threw the meat back in.  It was fabulous!

I used this recipe for some leftover ribeye steak. I made a small amount of the marinade, sautéed some onions and peppers and added the marinade, some chopped cilantro and the leftover steak sliced thin to the sauté pan. Sautéed long enough to warm the steak and served as recommended along with pico de gallo recipe from AR and Spanish quinoa in stuffed peppers found on AR. Loved by all.

Hands down the best fajitas we've ever made, wonderful.  Added a package of "fajita mix" peppers, onions to the beef after cooking it for 3 or 4 minutes and the veggies had wonderful flavor as well.  Used the filling for fajita quesadillas tonight, but would make it for ANY reason

Superb flavor!  I used fresh Italian parsley instead of cilantro, flat iron steak and flour tortillas.  Next time I will add some sliced avocado and chopped tomatoes.

No where near the more traditional flavor of true Tex-Mex cooking.  Missing something, but I don't know what.  Did spice it up a bit with a few Habanero peppers

This was fantastic! It was easy to make and very flavorful. I added some lemon juice and some chili powder to the meat.  My kids all loved the taste.

Great recipe!  Simple and tasty. The only thing I did differently was use a flank steak and marinated it for about 24 hours.  I will make this again.

I used sirloin instead of New York strip. Wife doesn't care for garlic and not so much onion, but it turned out real good. I would make it again. I partially char-broiled the sirloin before cutting the strips. That seemed to work well. I would rate it 4.5 stars.

the fajitas where excellent I used rib eyes which I marinated all day. The only difference was that I used dried minced onion instead of fresh and it turned out well

5+ stars. I marinaded the meat as directed and it was delicious.  I had 5 hours to marinade the meat and when it was time to prepare supper I cooked the meat in a frying pan until it was almost cooked. I set the meat aside and added sliced red peppers and purple onions to the pan and cooked them until they were almost cooked and added mushrooms and cooked until they were soft. I threw the meat back in along with that yummy marinade and cooked until everything was warmed and the liquid was absorbed. We dropped a spoonful of this in a small fajita shell and topped it with sour cream and shredded cheese and wrapped them up to eat. Wow this is the best fajita recipe I've ever had. I made the changes of adding veggies because thats the way we like our fajitas but if you prefer them without it would be excellent that way too. It's the marinade that makes this delicious. Thanks so much for sharing this.
