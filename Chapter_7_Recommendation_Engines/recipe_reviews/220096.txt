This pie was a great success, everyone loved it.

I substituted Tilapia for the Mahi Mahi and a bag of frozen mixed veggies for the can.

I made many substitutions, thanks to this great base recipe, to make it dairy and wheat-free.  Instead of canned soup I used 1.5 cups homemade almond milk, thickened with one tablespoon sweet potato powder and one tablespoon spelt flour.  I added one tablespoon miso to the milk, and 1/4 cup nutritional yeast flakes..  The taste was exceptional.  Instead of canned veggies, I added one potato boiled and cut into small pieces, and 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas and kale).  I baked it in a bought spelt pie shell.  Everyone loved this!

Simple, but good! I ended up making my own crust but the rest of the recipe I followed.  My dad asked for thirds, and if my dad likes it, it's a keeper.

Fabulous! I used a can of progresso clam chowder instead of cream of potato. I added the milk plus flour to thicken. Added frozen corn. I also added a tsp of clam bouillon (better than bouillon) is the brand.
