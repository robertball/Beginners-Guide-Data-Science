We love this salad! Sometimes if I'm feeling lazy, Ill just use bottled italian dressing or even mix up a batch of Good Seasons. If I have green pepper on hand, I'll usually chop that up and throw it in there too. I've also done this with frozen cheese tortellini and tri-colored tortellini with great results. This is a simple, great tasting salad and just a little different from regular pasta salad...Always a hit! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was VERY good, but a tad dry...not sure if I added too many ingredients, but next time I will double the sauce.  My kids who are 4 and 3 love it as well.

Big hit at our house!  Took some reviewers advice and used a variety of olives, marinated artichokes, and marinated mozzarella balls from the "Mediterranean Bar" (next to the salad bar) at the grocery store.  Added slivered red & green peppers, halved cherry tomatoes, and hard salami.  Used tri-colored cheese tortellini - and after cooking, tossed it in a little bit of the marinade from the container of olives, artichokes, and mozzarella so it wouldn't stick together before I added in all the other ingredients.  When finished, to help with marinating - I put the whole salad in a gallon size ziploc bag and laid it flat in the fridge.  Every so often, I flipped it over to mix it up a little bit.  Great space saver, too!  Needed to make several salads at the same time and marinated them this way, stacked on top of each other!

Excellent! I actually doubled this recipe the first time I made it and it was ALL GONE before the end of the night. The only thing I did different was added extra green onions and instead of marinated artichoke hearts, I used the plain artichoke hearts and let them marinate in Italian dressing for about a half hour before adding them in. I also skipped the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and white vinegar and just used more of the Italian dressing (Wishbone) with some added Italian herb seasoning added to it. Made it simpler and I believe just as yummy! makign it again for another party this month!

This salad was just so-so for me.  (And though I usually get rave reviews for my recipes at family parties, I only got one compliment on this one.)  I loved the ingredients in it-- pretty much all things I like.  But somehow the final product was kind of bland.  It must have been the dressing.  I think I will make this again because I really like the parts, but I will use kalamata olives for more flavor, maybe throw in some parmesan for depth, and I might use a bottled Greek or Italian dressing rather than just the oil/vinegar/Italian herbs.  I think this salad has potential, but it needs some tweaking to be up to my standards.

It was not bad at all, tastes delicious but I had to make various adjustments which is why I gave it 4 stars. First I added green and red bell peppers as well as cherry tomatoes to add color and variety. I also added more Italian seasoning (more like 2.5 teaspoons or so) as well as some red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. Real easy recipe, I liked it a lot and the combination of taste was great - but not really out of this world.

This was really good. I used cider vingear and salami (instead of pepperoni) because that's what I had. I also added cherry tomatoes, quartered, because I like the combination of mozzarella and tomatoes. I would do this again because it really tasted great and it added moisture to the salad. It was even better the next day.

I personally thought this was just ok, but my guests thought this was incredible. I invited about 30 people over and almost all of them complemented me on this salad.  So I am giving this a 5 star.  I added more ingredients to make more salad.  I included asparagus(Cooked in boiling water for 1 min the in  icebath) fresh cut cherry tomatoes, parmasan cheese and a green pepper.  Used the same amount of dressing and it worked fine.  I do not think you need to add more dressing unless you plan on eating this the next day when the noodles soak up the sauce.  I suggest other reviewers to wait to add the sauce until right before you serve it.  This was good but I also think it depends on what kind of tortellini you buy.  Some are better than others...Thanks for the recipe.

Swapped spinach-filled ravioli for tortellini and left out the olives. Loved it.

Wow, this was so good and so different from the usual pasta salad.  I took this to a family reunion and it was all gone in no time at all....everyone compared it to Italian antipasto platters.  Wouldn't change a single thing, and I would definitely make it again.

This is a great salad.  But what makes it really different is the balsamic vinegar in the dressing.  Bottled dressing might be easier but it lacks the class that the balsamic vinegar gives the salad.  As is it is great.  If you desire a "saucier" salad, double the given recipe.

This is my fiancee's new favorite salad. Very flavorful and love the chewy bite of tortellini with the tasty dressing. Just gets better if it sits in the fridge for a couple days. Love it.

This recipe is really great - I make it often and everyone always loves it!
After reading reviews, I tried it with Italian dressing instead of the dressing suggested - I've made it at least twice both ways, and I have to say the Italian dressing is yummier. I didn't have artichoke hearts, but for some "deep flavor" I add dun dried tomatoes; both dried and marinated in olive oil taste great.  Salami works great too if you don't have pepperoni.

Great!! I used turkey pepperoni and didn't add any extra salt because the pepperoni was salty. 
My package of tortellini was not as large as this recipe calls for but I kept the quantities the same for the dressing and the "toppings" and it was perfect amount. Next time I make it with the right quantity of tortellini I will increase the amount of dressing I make. I used shredded mozzarella cheese and next time I will make sure to get a block of cheese and dice it like the recipe instructed to do.

I liked the combination of tortellini and artichokes.  I used bottled Italian dressing, but will try the olive oil and vinegar the next time I make it.  I didn't have pepperoni, so substituted ham.  Very refreshing, and the leftovers were delicious heated up!

This is a good recipe. I added some pepperochini to mine. I agree that doubling the dressing is probably a good idea, did seem very dry to me.

Prepared as written except for adding some bottled lite Italian dressing along with the dressing in the recipe. Great salad - took to company lunch and didn't have any left overs.

I love this recipe. I've made it for two gatherings, one at work and the other a BBQ. It disappeared quickly at both events. My significant other asks me to make it often as well. I've used a mixture of plain cheese tortellini and spinich, or cheese and garlic tortellini and it all tastes wonderful. I will be making this again and again.

I have made this recipe several times now for parties and everyone loves it.  I did omit the green onions and artichoke hearts and increased the amount of Italian seasoning to 1 Tbsp. and it still came out great! I will continue to make this recipe!

I cut the black olives and artichoke hearts, added grape tomatoes and cucumbers instead.  I also used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Excellent!

Great salad to take to the beach!  Simple, yummy, and makes great leftovers if you don't get too much sand in it.  :)

Loved that it was so good and super easy to throw together. I did double to cheese, omit the olives (hate them) & onions (the store was out of green onions...seriously...) and add in some garlic powder to the dressing. It was a hit at the BBQ I took it to, thank you for sharing!  :)

I doubled the recipe and after refrigerating it for a few hours it did get somewhat dry. Next time will add more sauce. Other than that it was a huge hit at a pot luck with fried chicken as the main dish. It's so filling!! Didn't change a thing from the recipe above.

I made this tonight for my husband and me. We both loved it! I made it almost exactly as written but I made additional sauce and added fresh Parmesan cheese. I think you have to start with great tortellini which I got at Sam's Club. I also  used garlic and herb Lipton soup mix (about half an envelope) instead of the Italian seasoning because we were out of it. Still came out so yummy. We will definitely be making this often.

My husband, who is picky (at best) said this was the best pasta salad he's ever had. And prompty confiscated a big bowl of what was supposed to be destined for a work potluck. Honestly, I have to agree! 

following the advice of others, I used bottled dressing instead of the vinegar/oil/italian seasoning (I used Ken's Lite Northern Italian). Also used turkey pepperoni and part skim mozzerella to lighten it up a bit. Love it! My new go to summer dish!

i just made this for my husband and he loved it! I'm not a big meat eater, so I didn't use the pepperoni. I went with white wine vinegar instead of balsamic and them used goat cheese instead of mozzarella mmmm....

I made this tonight for my husband and I for dinner and it is gone!  I did make a few changes - I used Good Season's Cheesy Garlic dressing mix in place of the salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  I also forgot to get marinated artichoke hearts, so I used canned artichoke hearts.  The salad was wonderful.  My husband heated his up and said is was very good hot.  We both decided that next time I make it, I need to add pepperocini's - for more zing.  A wonderful pasta salad that is definately being added to my favorites!  Thank you for sharing.

Delicious! I just made it tonight, and we'll be having it again. It will be great to make ahead for RV trips, take to potlucks, and just have for a nice summer dinner.  I left out the green onions since we're not fond of them, and used cider vinegar instead of white, but did everything else as written.  For a variation, I might try shaved parmesan in place of the mozzarella sometime.

This versatile salad can be customized to your family's taste; however, it is fabulous just as it is written.  Doubled everything for a large barbecue and it was almost gone!  I stored a little container in the fridge for the next day and it was even better.  I think I will make this the night before next time.

I was expecting this casserole to be outstanding but I found it uninspiring. I followed the directions exactly. I wanted more intense flavours but it was actually fairly bland. It also needs colour. If I made it again I would certainly add chopped sweet red pepper, and halved cherry tomatoes.

Nice combination - I used tortellini with sweet sausage and cheese, so I left out the pepperoni - also I don't care for olives so left them out.  Wish I had thought to add peas to add some color without the other ingredients.  Next time I'll also grab some fresh herbs from the garden.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This salad goes so great with a juicy steak! The only changes I made was to use Parmesan cheese instead of Mozzarella (had it on hand) and added 1/4 cup of mayo. Yummm!

Outstanding!!!  This is one of the best cold pasta recipes I've ever made.  Only because I didn't  have pepperoni on hand, that I changed olivegrowers recipe.   I substituted beef summer sausage for pepperoni.    I also added red & yellow bell peppers as well as brocolli to get in more veggies.

A good salad, but a little too much dressing for me. I had a few of my guests ask for the recipe, so that tells you a lot.  I will make again, just take it easy on the dressing part.

Delicious!  Used a tri-colored tortellini, salami instead of pepperoni, and added roasted red peppers.  Otherwise followed exactly.

Disclaimer:  Did not make the sauce as directed, instead used the same amount of Italian dressing, (1/3 c + 3 T).

What a great recipe!  I took advice of several other posters and used Italian dressing instead of making the olive oil/vinegar/seasoning blend and it turned out so delicious!  I omitted the artichoke and instead did cherry tomatoes.  I also cut back the cheese to about 4 oz. and did a mix of mozzarella and sharp cheddar.  Topped it off with some fresh chopped Italian parsley.  It was a smashing hit at our family party.  Thanks!

Such a great recipe with tortellini. We've tweaked it a little from time to time but that's the beauty of such a versatile recipe! We enjoy it with bottom mushrooms and trying different cheeses.

Absolutely delicious! My four teen boys also loved it.

Changes: I used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of white vinegar. Instead of Italian seasoning (didn't have), I used 1/2 tsp. each basil & oregano. I used Kalamata olives.

I will double the recipe next time, because it didn't make nearly enough for our family.

I used cheese and prosciutto tortellini and be sure to not overcook the tortellini. I got lazy and used bottles Italian salad dressing and cedar cheese curds along with the mozzarella cheese.  Wife liked it ... that's what counts.

So good!  I've made it twice, once with just italian dressing and it was amazing and the second time, I made it with the  olive oil and balsamic vinegarette and both times it was great!   I used pepperoni the first time and the second diced a smoked mild sausage.  Now a family favorite!

I made a few adjustments, making the recipe a little spicier. I added  garbanzo beans because I'm like that. I changed the ratio between the balsamic vinegar and the white distilled vinegar.  More balsamic. I shared it with a group of women  at a potluck. The next day I heated some leftovers in an alfredo sauce. It was so delicious!

This wasn't very popular at my party, but I think kids might like it better then adults.  I also tried it by putting the ingredients on skewers  at a picnic party.  They went over okay, but not as I had expected.

Excellent salad.  I made this for get together and everyone liked it.  I used a dried sausage instead of pepperoni, a fresh mozzarella, and halved black olives.  I would make it according to recipe next time.  Dressing was just right.

Thank you for the inspiration.  I didn't have any artichokes   but I used heart of palm, and added chopped red pepper, celery and zucchini along with store bought Greek dressing and it was a big hit.  Thank You again.

For the sauce/seasoning I used a bottle of Italian dressing, was running short on time, and let it set for 5 hours.  Was great and the leftovers the next day were even better.

Made as is this recipe is fantastic. What makes it even better is that it is adaptable to your personal tastes (or mistakes).  I always take home an empty bowl when I bring this to a party.

Really good! I made mine with leftover spinach-ricotta tortellini. It's Lent, so I'm going to add the meat as I have it (added salami today), in case it happens to be a Friday. The artichokes were a delicious addition, as well as the Italian seasoning. In a pinch, bottled Italian dressing would work here, as mentioned by the top reviewer. This would be a good lunch to take to the beach when the weather gets warmer. Nice recipe!

Great recipe as is. I have also added sliced carrots (for color) and celery for crunch. I sometimes substitute lemon juice for the balsamic vinegar. I typically add 1/2 teasp. salt and 1/2 teasp. sugar to the dressing ingredients.  I have also made it with canned artichokes, which works well since the dressing marinates them anyway. Enjoy.

I would make this again in a heart beat!
My girlfriend and I substituted salami for the pepperoni  and used tri color tortellini instead of white. 

We brought it over for dinner at her parents house and everyone raved about it afterwards. 
I will definitely make this again. Probably  sooner than later,  as my future father in-law says to me "You messed up -  now you've got to bring some more next time you come over".  Haha! 

Delicious and filling.  I highly recommend making this.  Incredibly easy to make.

Loved it. I added some additional veggies and fruits like  pineapple and zucchini and lets their juice be a part of the salad. I also got sausage tortellini that added significantly to the salad. Will def be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the fact that I used bottled italian dressing to save time,  and I was happy with the reaction from my guests at our 4th of July party. My nephew asked if he could take the rest home with him...which is a compliment since he is rather picky. Will definitely be making this one again.

Made this today. It's a great base recipe for sure. I tried not to make too many changes, this is what I did. First off I doubled the recipe. I used pepperoni and salami. Instead of mozzarella I used shredded Parm. For the dressing I used two dry Zesty Italian packets with a good quality Balsamic and Olive oil. I ended up omitting the olives as some folks don't like them (personally I love them).

Fantastic!  Made it a little healthier.  I left out the cheese and added one can drained cannelloni beans (white beans).  Also added a red and orange pepper and a little bottled Italian dressing. Everyone loved it!

This salad was excellent.  The only changes I made was I added cherry tomatoes and double the amount of dressing.  I added half the dressing when I made the salad and then the remaining dressing just before I served it.

This was perfect!  I had herb marinated mozzarella balls from Trader Joe's in my refrigerator and that's what I used. I just spooned about 4 tablespoons of the herbs and the oil from the container of mozzarella balls onto the pasta salad and omitted the herbs and oil the recipe calls for.  Also used Trader Joe's roasted marinated artichokes.  Making it again this week.

This is an excellent salad.  I cheated and used Wishbone Italian and not the dressing suggested.  I added thin sliced corned beef snipped with kitchen shears for a bit more flavor.  Even better the second day!

I've made this salad probably a dozen times since seeing this recipe last summer. I sub out the olives and artichokes and add drained banana pepper rings. Everyone always loves it, even small kids!

My dad couldn't stop eating it...my mom though said that she preferred salami in place of the pepperoni. All in all, a great light dish.

I made this with Kirkland Signature 5 Cheese Tortellini (my favourite). I am not a fan of black olives and would omit them in the future. Overall, a good recipe. I especially enjoyed the artichoke hearts!

It was a little dry and bland...I'll try it  again with a little more seasoning and maybe some mayo or something to make it a little creamier.  It was REALLY dry after sitting in the fridge for a couple days

My husband was skeptical at first, but quickly changed his tune. We ate it throughout the week, and it only got better with time. Simple and delicious.

What a yummy recipe!  My only changes were to use 4 oz. of Goat Cheese (as I was out of Mozzarella), and use about 1/8th cup of Dried Minced Onion (I cheat with this often as I hate working with fresh onions.)  I also added slivered red and green peppers to punch up the color and veggie content.  It's marinating in the fridge as I type and Hubby's already trying to smuggle some out -- I think we have a winner!  ;p

Great Salad.  I did make a few changes.....I used red onion instead of green and I double up the sauce, it was to dry.   Otherwise this salad was a great hit!

This was just okay.  The artichokes seemed to taste a little too strong and the salad dried up a lot  . . . had to add extra oil to the leftovers.  I also added some parmesan cheese to help with the flavor.  Would probably not make this again.

A complete win over at my company picinic. Very simple to make and knowing your 'eaters' you can totally adjust pepperoni with ham or salami. Personally the balsamic vinegar to recipe was much so I added almost twice Italian Seasoning. Today I have to make more for my co-workers because they want it for lunch on Monday!
