Made this for Christmas dessert; It was fantastic!  Next time though, I'll double the spices.  I made a cream cheese, whipped topping and confectioners sugar icing that was a perfect compliment.

Each time I have made this cake I have received compliments.  Everyone asks me for the recipe.  I just wish I could claim it as mine :)  It's SO easy to make and very light.  A great cake to eat after a BIG meal ...

In today's world where products are downsized and the prices are not I had to do some scratch my head math. This is what I came up with (1) 16 oz box of angel food cake mix and 7 oz BY WEIGHT pumpkin puree. For just a bit more spices I added 3/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and baked in an angel food tube pan. Being that I'm not a baker - yes I can read the side of the box - and nothing turns out right this was the most moist, light and fluffy angel food cake I've ever tasted hands down. Even ones that I didn't make being that I'm not a baker. The pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice were spot on.

It was a good cake & was really moist. I didn't make it in a tube pan, I just poured the mix in a rectangular glass thing. I'll probably make it again, but what I didn't like was the after taste it left in your mouth. Be prepared for funky pumpkin breath.

Very tasty and VERY easy to make!  A light pumpkin pie/vanilla flavor with the texture of the angel food cake. I served it at a housewarming party; several people asked for the recipe and were surprised how simple it was to make.

I frosted it with whipped cream mixed with the remaining pumpkin puree from a 19oz(?) can, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It was even better the second day -probably because the whipped cream had moistened the cake overnight in the fridge.  Next time however I think I will try a cream cheese frosting -it would probably complement the pumpkin spice flavor better than the whipped cream.

I think this recipe could be really good . . . but something went terribly wrong.  I could not get it to cook through.  When I finally took it out after an extra 15 minutes of baking the edges were charred and the center was mush.  I will try again, like I said, it could be good.
