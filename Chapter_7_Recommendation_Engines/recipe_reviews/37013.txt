This is one of those recipes that I'll never delete from my file.  I added two more slices of cubed bread just to ensure that it wouldn't be a bit soggy.  The only changes I made were to add chopped parsley for a little color.  And about 5 minutes before I took it out, I sprinkled Cheddar and Monterrey Jack on top to make it cheesier.  This one dish pleases EVERYONE.  I usually make it on a Friday night and pop it in the over on Saturday - a wonderful brunch idea.

WOW!  I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was GREAT!  I did the ham instead of pork sausage (my husband doesn't like sausage) and, to avoid not having enough flavor as mentioned by some raters, I also added about a half pound of bacon.  I chopped and cooked the bacon, and once the bacon was cooked, I added the ham and cooked it with the bacon flavoring for a while.  I drained it all very good and *WOW* it had great flavor.  The only other thing I did different was to sprinkle chopped green onion on top which enhanced all aspects of the casserole:  it smlled great while it was cooking, it looked pretty when it came out, and it tasted awesome.  I just ate the leftovers which was very good... I don't know why someone said it doesn't reheat well... I micro'd it for a couple of minutes and it was fine!  All in all, a great recipe, super easy, and definitely a KEEPER!

This is a really popular casserole and has been around for a long time. After eyeing it for several months, I decided to give it a try.  Hubby thought it was just so-so, but I thought it was pretty good.  Next time I may add some bacon along with the sausage and maybe some onions or mushrooms.  Make sure you use sharp cheddar as it has a distinct flavor that goes well with sausage!!  I had some company show up after lunch and they enjoyed the leftovers.  Great for breakfast or brunch.

this was a really easy and delicious dish! it tastes just like a quiche filling. i made it for dinner -- so i only chilled it for about 6 hours. i used a smaller casserole dish -- used only used 4 eggs (but i easily could have added the 6 called for), about 5 slices of bread, and adjusted the milk and cheese as needed. i will definitely be making this again. it is delicious!

A gorgeous and delicious brunch casserole.  I used cubed cooked Linguica sausage, and it was a nice zesty touch.  I also layered it twice--bread, sausage, cheese, and then again--to vary the textures throughout, and then pressed the layers down gently after pouring the egg mixture over to make sure everything was coated.  EASY!

Very good standard breakfast casserole.  Using French bread or like instead of plain white sandwich bread greatly improves the texture making it very light and fluffy.

Very good. Simple and tasty. The first time I made it the dish seemed a little too moist.  I'm one who doesn't like runny eggs, so the second time I cut the milk in half.  Just for kicks I doubled the Whorechestershire and added a touch more dry mustard.  I think I'll make these changes permanent!  We'll definitely be having this one again.

SO Easy to make and delicious!  Even the small children loved them at our Christmas brunch.  However, IF you are doubling this recipe in one huge casserole dish to feed a large crowd, the cooking time will need to be increased around twice as long.

I have made over 25 recipies from this site (check my other reviews)so comparatively speaking I can't give this a 5 star. None of my four kids would eat it.  It was ok, but not unbelievable or even great. I didn't change the recipe and thought it was spicy as it was.  I cut back the milk like the other reviews so it wasn't watery.

I've used this recipe for years with only one change. Instead of the sliced bread, I line the bottom of my casserole dish with caesar-style croutons. The croutons give it a little more flavor.

Great recipe-used hot sausage and mixed some of Emeril's Essence spice mix in the egg batter before pouring it over the sausage for a little extra kick.

Made this casserole for my parents while they were visiting from out of town.  It was a big hit.  I added two more eggs and a little more milk.  My mom has already asked for the recipe!

I wondered about all the cubed bread - but it really does work!  The egg mixture soaks it right up and bakes beautifully.  I used "hot" mustard by mistake and it was just fine.  A real keeper.

I have used this recipes on countless occasions and I'm always pleased with the compliments I receive.  It's hearty and filling and you can make variations galore.  The mustard and Worcestershire sauce are must-have ingredients, but you can change almost anything else in the recipe to suit your mood.  Flavored sausage, different types of bread, buttermilk, hot peppers, anything works.  It's perfect for women's brunches and special occasion breakfasts.

I brought this to a women's brunch at church and received a number of requests for the recipe.  The worchestershire sauce and mustard really make it stand out from other breakfast casseroles.

Excellent and so easy to make.  Baked it for Christmas breakfast and we ate the left overs for dinner tonight, heated up in the microwave.  It was almost better tonight!  Thanks so much for the recipe Southern Living!

I didn't think this was great.  It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't as good as other egg casseroles I've had - for me not worth making again.

This recipe was easy, but it had too much bread in it.  It was also slightly bland.  I used one extra egg than it called for.  If I make it again I will add some onion and less bread.

This was just like my mom's recipe - other than the addition of the worcestershire.  My husband thought it made it too strong for the a.m. but every one else loved it.

I made this recipe ahead of time to serve my family Christmas morning.  All I had to do was pop it in the oven.  Everyone liked it, including my husband who is a very picky eater.  Don't be afraid of all the bread!  It cooks well and people just think it's egg!

I made this for dinner rather than breakfast, but it would certainly make a great brunch dish, too.  It was a little bland.  Next time some tabasco or cayenne will be in order!

We thought this was pretty bland and way too much bread for us.  I use this recipe as a base and use three homemade day old biscuits, crumbled, cut down on the milk, add a little garlic pepper and some green chili peppers.  It is better when altered this way.

This was so good.  I made a double batch, cooked it and froze it.  It was great re-heated too.  I didn't find it soggy (make sure you let it "rest" for 8 hours), and it smelled great.  I can't say enough.  It was a great way to serve a crowd, and everyone liked it.

I have made this recipe for years.  I prepare it on Christmas Eve for Christmas morning - that way it is baking while we open gifts.  I have found that using half and half instead of milk makes it firmer!  I do add sliced mushrooms and diced green peppers and onions.  My family loves it.

Overall a good recipe.  Was a little soupy; had to cook it longer and children did not like the seasoning (worc & mustard).  Will not use them next time.  Good standard recipe & you can change it up with ham or bacon, too.

I made this for Xmas breakfast for me and my boyfriend. He's hispanic so I used chorizo instead of regular sausage. I was concerned about the amount of bread it called for but it turned out wonderful. It was so easy and re-heated very well.

VERY YUMMY! I had this for Fathers Day brunch & 4 of us ate 3/4 of it & I ate the rest of it for lunch 2 days in a row. Easy to prepare & a cinch to pop in the oven the next morning - all you have to do is prepare whatever else you are having while it cooks. I served it with fruit salad & english muffins. My stepmom wanted the recipie because my dad loved it so much.

I made this reciped for my sister's bridal shower brunch and it was a hit! Lots of people asked me for the recipe!  (If you want to make it a bit more decadent for a special occasion, replace one of the cups of milk with half and half cream.) Not only is this breakfast casserole delicious, but it's easy to make and all the preparation is done the day before. THIS RECIPE IS A WINNER!

The only thing I do different is I chop 1/2 onion, a red and green pepper and slice some mushrooms.  Saute those and add on top of the sausage.

I served this dish the morning of Thanksgiving.  It was a hit and so easy to make!  Everyone loved it...even my mother-in-law who doesn't really care for sausage.  The only suggestion I have is add a little picante sauce on the top.  I will definately serve this again on Christmas morning!

This is a great breakfast casserole. I have made it many times using different meats.  Always a favorite.  I do not let it sit out 30 min before baking.  I put right in the oven.

This recipe is quite possibly foolproof.  I have made it several times with different thicknesses of "loaf bread" - thin, sandwich slices, etc.  And it always comes out great.  I have made it without letting it sit overnight, and it still comes out good (but overnight is preferred).  I made it for my son's Christening brunch last week, and I made it ahead in stages:  I measured the dry ingredients and put them in a "baggie" in my spice cabinet about 2 weeks ahead.  I cubed the bread and put in freezer about 1 week prior.  I also cooked up the sausage and froze that 1 week ahead.  Then, the day I was going to make it (the day before the brunch), I let everything thaw.  That night, all I had to do was dump the bread cubes, crumbled sausage, and a bag of pre-shredded cheese into the pan.  Then I just mixed the wet ingredients (dumped the pre-measured seasonings in), poured into pan, and placed in the fridge.  The next morning, I left it on the counter with a copy of the recipe for my party helper to bake.  Everyone raved...especially our Northern visitors.  They wanted the recipe for my "quiche."  You really cannot tell that the base is bread!

I'm late reviewing this, but I have served this the last 2 Xmas mornings, and it is something our family looks foward too (maybe even more than the pressies) Excellent for brunch, I love to add hot sauce for some zip!

Not only delicious but easy! We tried both the ground pork option and ham option. Preferred the ham -- seemed oddly lighter and a little faster without having to cook the pork. With ham we added sliced green onions on top which gave it a lovely sing of flavor! Great recipe for preparing the night before and not having the work in the morning.

Pretty good, but not great.  I don't think I cared for the italian sausage so much.  I served this at a church brunch and this was one of the last of the egg dishes to go.

With all the good reviews, I thought this would make a great casserole for a brunch at work, but I just wasn't that impressed. I used sourdough bread, sharp cheddar, sage sausage, and a tsp of Emeril Essence (in addition to other ingredients, minus the salt), but it was still bland. The guys at work liked it (they said there's no way to screw up bread, sausage, egg, and cheese), and there wasn't much left, but I didn't have much desire to eat the leftovers. If I were to try this again, I would definitely add at least two more eggs and mix crumbled bacon with the bread, then use ham or  bacon on top. My sausage also dried out a little on top, even though I added some cheese in the last ten minutes of baking.

I made this casserole today and it was very good the only changes I made was I added crushed red pepper and garlic powder to the sausage while it was cooking and I added some extra cheddar cheese to the top of the casserole in the last 10 minutes of baking and I used french bread instead of plain loaf bread. This is a great recipe!!My picky husband even loved it!!!!

THANKS!!! :)

This was as easy as it was yummy!  It sure made breakfast for holiday company alot easier.  I followed one of the other reviews and added crumbled bacon to my 2 cups of ham, then sauted my ham in the bacon grease for flavor (drain well afterwards).  I used extra cheese and removed the edges from the bread.  Finally, I topped it with sour cream when serving.  It was a hit with all!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I made this casserole for a brunch after church.  I substituted cooked ham (cubed) for the sausage and added green pepper, green onion, and mushroom.  I also used hearty canadian bread.  I cooked per the instructions, but then left it in my oven on 170 degrees for 2 hours while we were at church.  All of the men loved it.  I'll definitely make it again for Christmas morning.  Next time I might add 2 more eggs as another reviewer tried.

This is a good breakfast casserole, if breakfast casseroles are your thing (their not really mine).  I was looking for a recipe to take to a local preschool association meeting next month and I wanted to use my family as a guinea pig and it turned out good.  Also just wanted to let you know I prepared the casserole and popped it into the oven without waiting for 8 hours and it turned out just fine.  I think next time I make it I might add some onions and mushrooms I think it would add a little bit more complex flavors and make it even better.  This is a hearty filling dish and I think it will feed more than 8 people, more like 12.  I will make again and tweak a little next time.

This is quite yummy. I used a blend of soudough and pumpernickel breads, with gave it a nice look. I used less cheese, and it was still plenty rich. I added chopped bell peppers (red) and red onion and turkey kielbasa and cilantro (because I had it, but fresh basil would be nicer).

In my family's opinion, this is by far the best variation of this type of breakfast casserole.  The texture is just right... not too dry, not too soggy, and it is not at all fussy.

This is a great breakfast/brunch recipe.  Although I would not add salt.  The breakfast sausage is salty enough, adding salt is over the top.

Good basic recipe.  If you are feeding picky eaters, this is plain without green peppers, sour cream, etc.  If you don't have to be safe, adding a few ingredients would give this a little zing.  I made this with ham, next time would try the sausage.

Used focaccia (this site) & also evaporated milk (1/2 n 1/2). Added more cheese; used the W sauce, & the focaccia had all the spices, salt and herbs. Mixed all the ingredients together (after the halal topside mince was browned with chopped onions and the heat from this worked well with the cubes of bread broken up) and spread patted them into the pan and sprinkled more cheese on top. Worried about no rest time (immediately baked), amount of bread (used 3/4 focaccia) or watery, but it turned up tasty, firm yet moist. Thanks for the tips, helped a lot. 4 stars because it is an adaptable recipe.

I followed this recipe to the t- Except I used Ham and Buttermilk bread (as suggested by others). I was not crazy about it. Served it for Brunch and no-one had seconds. I felt like there was an aftertaste. I don't know what happened, it got such great reviews. :(

Very easy to make and very tasty. Best if consumed entirely, left overs (if any) do not reheat well.

I have made this recipe several times.  My family loves it.  I take the crust off the bread slices and add 2 extra pieces of bread to account for that.  I have never had this turn out soupy.  I have used varieties of cheese blends or just regular mild cheddar cheese.  Either way turns out great!  I fix it with ham rather than sausage.  Even the kids love it.  I like to use buttermilk bread when making this dish.  I fixed it Christmas day for brunch and everyone loved it.

I tried this for our Christmas breakfast and was not disappointed!  I didn't have any white bread, so I used hot dog buns and it came out great!  Next time I think I'll add more sausage and cheese.

This one's a keeper.  I made it exactly like the recipe said and it turned out perfect.  For those who have had trouble with soggy breakfast casseroles, try using a heartier bread.

I have used this recipe for years.I first found it in the Southern Living recipe book.  It by far is the easiest, best & most forgiving recipe. You can make it as is or play with it by adding other ingredients. It is always very good.

Made this for Easter brunch. I had to cook it about 20 min. longer than the recipe states. I'm not a huge fan of eggs and they have to be cooked  very hard for me to eat them. I thought this was still kind of slimy but my husband really liked it! He warmed up some leftovers in the afternoon while waiting for dinner to get done. He said I should try it with ham next time. Maybe add green peppers and onions too. I guess that means I'll be making it again for him. It gets 4 stars for his reviews. I'll just have toast. :-)

I halved the recipe, used prosciutto squares instead of sausage and wheat bread instead of white.

This was good! I was really surprised at how the bread became just a binder and made the eggs fluffy but have substance. Even my picky fiance (first asked if there was anything green in it, lol) thought it was good AND had leftover the next day. I will definitely make this again because it was easy and could be made the night before.

Made this the night before, baked for Sunday morning breakfast. Husband liked it, kids and I thought it was too salty and too much sausage. Will try again but will leave out the added salt and try with ham instead.

Easy and delicious, this is definitely a winner!  For extra flavor, I substituted seasoned salt for the plain salt, and increased the Worcestershire to 1/2 teaspoon.  I promptly baked the casserole after assembly, and it turned out just fine.  It made a nice weeknight supper dish for my husband and myself.  And there were leftovers for breakfasts!

We enjoyed this. I added a bit of chopped red and green peppers for a festive look. I left out the salt: with the sausage and cheese, additional salt would have been too much. I will make it again, on occasion.

This recipe was very good.  I added sauted onions, green pepper and used 1/2 sausage and 1/2 cubed ham.  It turned out like a baked western omlet!  Very delicious -- definitely a keeper.

THIS IS SO GOOD!  I made this for my in-laws and it was a huge hit!!  Don't bother with any other breakfast casserole--try this one!  You'll love it!  The only change I made was to use Egg Beaters instead of real eggs.

I made this without letting it rest overnight.  I added 1-4oz can of green chiles, used a mixed of cheeses including pepper jack & 1 tbsp dried onion flakes.  They kids (3-college students) loved it!  It was voted a keeper in regular rotation!!!!  Works for me ;)

This is so easy to make! It's very convenient, too, because I can make it the night before and just pop it into the oven in the morning. I use spicy sausage which gives it even more flavor. This is a hit!

Terrific - My Christmas brunch guests just loved this and asked me for the recipe.  Can also substitue mixed cheeses or types of sausage - I made more than one variety this way and folks loved them all - but the regular pork sausage was best.

I did not have Worch. sauce so I just left it out.  Very good basic breakfast casserole.  A little bland for my taste - I would add pepper, sharp cheddar cheese and zesty sausage.  My husbank loved it as is with out the extra spiciness.  I prefer the cheese on top, and next time will layer it that way.  Overall very good.

I hosted a brunch and this casserole got rave reviews. It's great that you can get all the work out of the way the night before and just pop it in the oven the next morning. Just don't mess with the recipe -- I made it again with slightly more worcestershire sauce and less cheese and it was terrible.

It was okay, too much bread though.  I substituted chicken apple sausage instead of bulk pork.

Great recipe.  Next time I'd like to try it with some chopped ham and onion.
