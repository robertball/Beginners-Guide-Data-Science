This was easy to prepare, but be aware of time needed to marinate. I did not have the Sambal Oelek on hand when I did the marinate, so had to add latter (this may have made that flavour more dominant)
Very good taste, very tender
Served with rice pilouef.
Left overs were just as good reheated the next day

Made as written and this was impressive. The leftovers were even better.
