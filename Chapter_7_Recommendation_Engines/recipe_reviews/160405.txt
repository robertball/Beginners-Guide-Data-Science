Very good marinade for a tasy cut of beef. For those sayin the flat iron is too tough you must be cutting it incorrectly. Try cutting in 1/4" strips ACROSS the grain. This makes a world of difference. Use fresh roasted and smashed garlic instead of garlic powder.

Thanks Recipe Exchange ladies for this recipe! I had bought a flat iron steak at the store and had no idea what I was going to do with it. I posted a request on the recipe exchange and this recipe was suggested. It turned out great. I loved it.

Yes, this marinade is much sweeter than most.  But I liked it.  Instead of grilling the steak, I cut the marinated (overnight) meat in strips and pan fried in the marinade.  Served with rice and a simple salad of baby greens and grape tomatoes for a very delicious meal.  (There were a few steak strips left over from the first meal and I sauteed red bell pepper and onions, added some oregano, and the meat for very tasty fajitas.)

It was the first time I tried this recipe. It was delicious however I thought there was too much of a honey taste, so I'll reduce it a bit the next time.

I love the marinade.  I went exactly by the recipe.  I let it marinate for three days in the baggie in a refrigerator.  What I don't enjoy so much is this particular cut of meat.  I think it was grilled properly (it was pink in the middle), but it's just a tough cut of meat.  I will absolutely use the marinade again on a different cut of steak.

Excellent Marinade! I've made this a few times exactly as the recipe states and it's fabulous, my family loves it! I typically mix the marinade and get the steaks soaking first thing in the morning then by the time I get home from work they've been soaking for hours and the flavor is just perfect. I imagine if they soaked over night they'd be even better but I never remember to do it the night before.

Delicious!  I marinate for a good 24 hours. I think th ehoney and balsamic giv eit great flavor. I've even used this for a giant chuck steak and threw everything along with some potatoes, carrots, onion and stock into a crock pot and made a kind of pot roast out of it.

I modified this a little...to make it easier and adapt to our tastes:  delicious!!  Mixed the liquid ingredients as instructed, but instead of adding the dried herbs, I just coated my steak with a healthy dose of Montreal Steak seasoning.  Poured the marinade on, sealed the ziplock bag, and refrigerated about 10 hours before cooking on the grill.  Take the steak out of the marinade and let the steak come to room temp if you can before grilling.  Delicious!  So tender and juicy!  Everyone enjoyed this.  Thanks for sharing!

Marinade was excellent!  I marinated for over 24 hours and the taste was amazing.  It is a little sweet but a good change from the norm.  Also, the meat turned out very tender.  I will be making this again.

Not bad but not great. Before cooking, the marinade seemed good, but it was a little too much overall.

Great marinade that hits all 4 taste centers in your mouth (sweet, sour, salt, bitter)! The Flat Iron steak cooked Medium Rare is hard to beat for flavor and tenderness. I prefer to tenderize it even more with a Jaccard 3-row meat tenderizer. Use the marinade recipe above, throw it and the meat in a 9X9" pyrex baking dish and then use the tenderizer to infuse the marinade deep into the meat and help cut through the connective tissues. Cook 4 minutes on the first side, 6 minutes on the flip side and then remove from the grill and wrap with tin-foil for 5 to 10 minutes to let the juices reabsorb. Do not overcook this cut of beef, the thicker end will come out Medium Rare while the thinner end comes out Medium.  Cut across the grain in 1/8" to 1/4" strips and watch the meat disappear. This same method works well for Flank Steak but pound for pound dollar-wise, nothing beats the Flat Iron for taste and tenderness.  Thanks for the great marinade!

Worked fine with reducing the honey to 2 Tbs.  Substitued black for white pepper and used minced fresh garlic instead of powder.  Also marinated overnight for dinner next day, so the meat was tender and tasty.

We loved this recipe.  We made a salad and put the steak on top with some Rasberry Venagerette dressing, crumbled Blue Cheese, Red Onion  and croutons and it was a meal in itself.

Yes, a tad on the sweet side, as many reviewers pointed out. I liked it exactly per the recipe. Others can certainly either reduce the amount of honey or simply not marinade as long.
What I find odd is the number of you who think this is a tough cut of steak. The Flat Iron cut is a relatively "recent discovery" as far as offerings in the way meat is cut. I agree with those who claim it is extremely tender. Be SURE to cut against the grain. Makes a world of difference.
ALLEZ CUISINE!!

This is a very nice marinade with a subtle sweetness.  I marinated it overnight for the optimum flavor.

this was very good, but for some reason i was a little weirded out with the rosemary and beef.  the flat iron steak was very tender.  due to unforeseen circumstances, this marinated for 24 hours before grilling.  i might use again.  thanks for the post mrs lash!

I didn't have the time to let this marinate for as long as recommended. I wish I had. It was a good steak, but next time I will be sure to marinate first thing in the morning. :)

I didn't like this at all. I like balsamic vinegar, but the addition in this recipe just wasn't to my taste. Neither was the sweetness of the honey a welcome flavor.

Flat Iron steak has become very popular and is no longer an inexpensive meat where I am at (Denver).  You are lucky to find it on sale for the price top sirloin steak.  Good marinade recipe, I tried it on 3/4" thick boneless chuck steak, and it turned out very well.  I used twice the amount of fresh tarragon and fresh rosemary, and added some chopped basil, and used 2 cloves of garlic, minced instead of dried.

I happened to cook 2 flat iron steaks at the same time b/c they were on sale.  The marinade recipe was adequate to flavor both of them however.  I put the full 3 Tbsp. of honey in even though some reviewers thought it made it too sweet.  I feel the balsamic vinegar and worcestershire were strong enough to counterbalance the sweetness of the honey so I do not plan to reduce the honey amount in the future.  Ratio is good as is.  Flavor was very good as well.

This was an awesome recipe. Didn't change a thing, as far as ingredients go. It was tender and perfectly cooked, seasoned and the entire family loved it. I did however marinate it for 5 days by accident. I had a family emergency and didn't get to cook it when originally planned so it stayed in the fridge marinating. It was fantastic. Thank you!

This was my first attempt ever at grilling a steak.  Chose the flat iron cut because I could afford it.  Came out absolutely perfect!  Although reviews say it's best as medium rare, we like ours without any pink.  Grilled it about 6 minutes each side, with another few minutes on the rack above - nice and charcoaly outside, moist inside.  Used recipe as is though had to leave out rosemary because we didn't have any.  Added a little salt when served.  Will not change anything!

Turned out great but I was worried about it being too sweet - cut the honey down to 2 tbs, added 1-2 tbs of soy and 1-2 tbs of chopped onions. Was short on time so only marinated the steak for about 1 hour then reduced the marinade and used it as a basting sauce. Will make again!

I had no honey so used molasses instead. Also used fresh minced garlic instead of powder, and white balsamic vinegar instead of regular. My olive oil was a dipping oil with wild mushrooms and sage.  Ok, so I guess I made a lot of changes and just used the recipe for proportions. Delicious.

This is a GREAT marinade recipe!! I marinaded it overnight in a  plastic bag then seared on a hot cast iron griddle on my gas grill. Once it was seared, I finished it in a 400 degree oven to 130 degrees. This is the same way I make any cut of steak. I know the best steak houses make steak this way, so I highly recommend it.

I only had time to marinate for an hour and it was still fantastic. My husband loved it and even my 7 yr old liked it. The second time I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and it was still great.

Excellent marinade. Doubled the recipe for 2.25 lb's of steak. Also used fresh garlic instead of powder. Will be adding this to our top 10 steak dishes. Thanks.

We marinated and grilled a bison flatiron steak.  The marinade was delicious.  Followed some other reviews and cut down the honey by a third.  Used garlic EVOO instead of garlic powder.  The results came out sweet and tasty, but not as strong as I had expected, although I marinated it in the refrigerator for about 28 hours. We're going to make it into steak sandwiches tonight.

Loved this recipe.  I read all the reviews and, yes the honey amount is too much, but just cut it down by one tablespoon and it's better.
Thanks to " Mark in Omaha"  review,  I went right online and bought a Jaccard Meat Tenderizer.  How come I've been cooking for so long and didn't know about this ?? Thanks!'and can't wait to try it.
      In any case, I followed the recipe exactly, the meat was very tasty and tender, used my digital meat thermometer to register rare/medium rare, took meat off heat and let it sit for 5 minutes, sliced it across the grain, it was delicious !
     Hubby, who isn't interested in cooking process-just the result , said it tasted like Filet. Yum, and thank you.

Marinade is pretty good. We substituted the recipe spices for our own Montreal steak seasonings and other herbs. Could def use more honey than recipe lists as well.

It was only ok. My family ate it without saying anything so I assume they liked it but as for me, I thought it was a bit bland. It was just missing something, salt? a spice? extra ingredient? I'm not quite sure what but SOMETHING. I'm not much of a beef eater but I just felt like it needed more flavor.

I used the marinate as it was written in the recipe except I used rice wine vinegar and left out the rosemary. I left it in the frig overnight. I grilled it on both sides for 5 min. It looked and smelled wonderful.  I let it rest for 15 min and then tried to cut it. None of my knives would cut the meat and I had to resort to my electric knife. The steak had so much of a white membrane running through it that even the electric knife wouldn't cut it. I would think that all flat iron steaks would be basically the same. This one was tough even after slicing it very thin.

Taste was complex, and each flavor stood out. But the recipe yields a bit too much marinade (for me, at least) for the amount of meat. I cut down all of the 3 tblsp to 2 tblsp instead.

Fabulous recipe!  Followed the suggestion of less honey (2 T) and family doesn't like rosemary so substituted with Italian Seasoning.  Turned out tender and flavorful.  Picky eater son even had seconds!  Definately a keeper.
