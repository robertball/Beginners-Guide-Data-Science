These are amazing. But I did make two changes. I only used half a bag (5 oz) of white chocolate chips. And I doubled the rice krispy cereal (1 1/2 cup). And this recipe will only fill a 9x9 pan, not a 13x9.  Helpful hint: Warm up the peanut butter for about 20 seconds to soften and make it easier to stir.

Yes I will make it again, my co workers loved it.  Next time I would double the rice crispy part.

I used a double boiler rather than the microwave, except for the semi-sweet chocolate and it was great!

This reminds me of the top of a scotcheroo, rather than fudge. It was tasty enough, but I think if people are looking for this to be a "fudge" recipe, they might be disappointed. More of a candy bar really.  I used an 8" square pan, to achieve a thicker end result.  I'd call this tiger butter, not fudge.

This is SO good and so easy to make!  Even my pickiest eater loved it.  When I make it again, I may add a little bit more rice krispies but that is really a personal preference.
