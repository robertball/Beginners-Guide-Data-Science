Loved, Loved, Loved this!!!   Definately skip the salt, you won't miss it.  Also, I added more veggies, zucchini, carrotts.  I doubled the tomatoe sauce and doubled the recipe and doubled the seasonings.  Absolutely 2 thumbs up.

I originally submitted this recipe using ground turkey and turkey sausage.  Brown in 1 T olive oil, with 1 T garlic, basil and oregano, you really have to season the meat while cooking. Also, I do not use any salt in my recipe, I don't feel it's needed.

I made this for dinner tonight and this was a hit!  Fantastic blend of flavors and very moist, loved the combination of pie crust, spinach and meat.  
I doubled the recipe and used 2 pie crusts in a 9x13 glass dish.  Served to 6 adults at a casual weekend dinner and not a morsel was left over.
I will definately add this to my regular rotation.
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Delicious!  (so say husband, kids, and adult friend)  I doubled the recipe.  No mushrooms or olives (I'm the only one who likes them) and no peppers (I hate them) but substituted zucchini in with the meat and tomato sauce.  Pretty much followed everything else.  It was good--but I'll probably stick with regular lasagna.  Fun to make a change though!

We loved this hearty recipe. It reminded us of a meatlovers deep dish pizza.

More garlic, triple the tomato paste, and way more seasonings in general. Besides that, though, this is really, really good and one of my husband's favorite recipes. I always forget to thaw the frozen spinach I use BEFORE cooking the meat, which would save time for me.

Sorry, but I thought this was VERY bland.  And a lot of work to go through for this pie.  Made it exactly (except for mushrooms)the way it was written.  I could not fit all the spinach mixture nor all the beef mixture in the pie either.

The blend of flavors is wonderful.  I made my own crust so I'm not sure it is worth all that effort, but it is good.  I absolutely will use this combination of meat,sauce, cheese and spinach the next time I make calzones.  Thank you Office Prisoner!

I made this and my hubby and adult daughter LOVED it!  I omitted the water and used 1/2 cup red cooking wine!  I used a large can of crushed tomatoes and 6oz can of tomato paste.  The sauce was thick and delish. To the white mixture I added 1/2 cup shredded parmesan and chopped Fresh spinach.   I also used a bay leaf when cooking the sauce.  Loved the fresh tomatoes on top!  Had enough to make two, glad I did.

The cheese mixture and topping were good, but the meat sauce wasn't as zesty as we would have liked. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough to justify how long it took to make. If I was making it again, I'd skip the ground beef and only use Italian sausage (maybe 1/2-3/4 pound). I'd also replace the tomato paste with tomato sauce or marinara sauce.
Update: I made this with the modifications above, and it was so much better! It's a keeper recipe this way. I didn't add extra salt, and the spices I did add (basil and oregano) were put in while browning the meat. I wish I'd reduced the water when I used less meat, but it worked by letting it boil a few minutes after the 10-minute simmer, then scooping into the pie with a finely slotted spoon.

I have made this twice now and both times ended up with only 1 serving for leftovers.  I rarely have ricotta in the house so used Greek yogurt instead.  I have also made it once with fresh spinach and once with frozen.  If using fresh then chop it very finely and double the quantity called for and it will cook down to the same amount.  I also made a mistake the last time and opened a can of plum tomatoes before realizing I was supposed to use tomato paste instead.  So I blended the tomatoes up with my hand blender, added the spices as directed and then added 2 Tbs of Bulgar wheat to the meat and tomato sauce, cooked an additional 15 min and it came out great.   Rave reviews from all in the house including the picky 5 yr old.

Will be adding this to my regular monthly rotation.

Love this pie.   The recipe is use for something like this does not go soggy (I use the same for quiche) so do not have to bake blind. It is called pate brisse.
