I made these with 2 ounces of onion and chive cream cheese. I thought that the small amount of cream cheese would be disappointing but it really was the perfect amount. When I cut the dough triangles in half there wasn't enough dough to fold to the center so I put the tsp of meat on the thick end and rolled them to the skinny end.  They cooked up just perfectly.

Simple, quick, & easy. If you cut the dough right, it works.  Also, I kept two of the regular triangles together, pressed the seams together, and then cut the large rectangle into four equal triangles. This worked MUCH better!   A bit plain, but, several love it that way.  Brush the top with a bit of melted butter then sprinkle with salt or light seasoning!  Really perks them up!

Good and simple recipe.  I served it at a ladies book club meeting.  It was good and I liked it, but nothing to rave about.  Seemed kinda blah - I'm not an expert in cooking or altering recipes.  I'm sure someone could add an ingredient or two and it would be great!

I made them for the holiday. I added spices, garlic, onion and a tiny bit of salt to enhance the flavors. They were great. People heard  homemade and they went quickly. Nice and simple to make. Next time I might add a dipping sauce.
