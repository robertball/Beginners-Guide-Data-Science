Good, but ordinary--nothing unique. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil, and more dill than called for as well.  I also added chunks of avocado for added interest. This is good for an idea when you're stumped for some kind of salad to make. Update, 2/09: This time I eliminated the sugar and the vinegar.  Used olive oil and a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice instead. Now this I loved! Instead of tangy and sweet it was light and refreshing.  A definite do-over!

Used 1/2 apple cider vinegar and 1/2 balsamic vinegar.  Used dried dill weed and doubled both it and the pepper.  Used only 1/2 the amount of required oil, and used olive.  Halved the cucumber lengthwise, peeled and seeded it before slicing it.  Subbed homegrown cubed kohlrabi for 1/2 of the cucumber.  Increased the onion slightly and decreased the tomato a bit.  When all done, I tasted it and added a touch more balsamic vinegar and some cubed avocado pieces.  Refrigerated it several hours before serving.  This was THE BEST cucumber-type salad I have ever made, and I am sure that it would be excellent as written.  However, I would stick with my combo of vinegars.  DO try this!!!

I have made this several times now and it is always a hit.  It is so light and refreshing...great on a hot summer day.  I cut the unpeeled cucumbers in half lenghwise, then scoop out the seeds.  Then I slice the cucumbers about a quarter inch thick.  This makes a more interesting shape than regular slicing and removes the seeds.  I also use about half of the olive oil.  Thanks for a great recipie.

Very refreshing and very good!  I used a little more sugar, a little more dill and olive oil instead of veg. oil.  You can easily adjust this vinaigrette to your tastes. I used one cucumber that I sliced very thin and next time I'd use an English cucumber.  I used half the amount of red onion and sliced that thin as well. I let it set for an hour before serving.

Actually we would give this a 4.5 rating. It is very tasty and easy. A pleasant side dish and a nice alternative to a lettuce or spinach salad. It is also one that can be made ahead of time. I followed others suggestions of: 1) marinated the cucumber and onion for many hours and added the tomatoes a few hours before serving. 2) Used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar 3) Used half the oil and used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. 4) Cut the cucumber in half legthwise, scooped out the seeds and then sliced in about 1/4 inch slices. A real keeper!!!

This recipe is great.  The first time I made it, the onion I had was really strong.  So now I just check the strength of the onion and maybe use less if it is too hot or strong.  This is so tasty, it is one of my family's favorites!

Being from South NJ, the summer for me always includes jersey tomates, and if you have a garden or know someone with a garden, they are always around.  The recipe is easy and everyone in my family loves it.  The dill is a nice change of pace and is not too much.  Using the apple cider vinegar also makes it not as strong as using white vinegar.

I love this recipe! I have made it three times in the past two weeks; it's a great way to use up the abundance of produce in my garden. I add about half the amount of onion (it's still very oniony) and a little more dill. Try letting it sit at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for about an hour before serving.

Nice flavor to the dressing. I marinated the cucumber and red onion overnight and added the tomatoes a few hours before serving.  Next time I am going to try an English cucumber and perhaps olives.  Fresh dill is a must.

I mince the onion and fresh dill and always use olive oil. I've made this with cider vinegar, rice vinegar, and white balsamic vinegar. It's all good. I think it tastes much better when it sits over night, one hour isn't enough to me. Can't count how many times I made this recipe.

Wow. Very, very good. I used EVOO and sprinkled fresh lemon juice over the salad. I ended up taking about a half cup of this salad and tossing it with a bit of grilled BLSL chicken breasts and wrapping it up in bibb lettuce. Filling and satisfying.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty, and a great way to use up cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden.  I recommend reducing the onion by 1/2 unless you are an onion fanatic--1/2 C was plenty for us.  Make sure you use fresh dill, dried just doesn't come close in taste.  We'll be making this often!

Simple summer recipe passed down from generation to generation.  The beauty of this salad is it's ability to be customized to one's own family's taste buds.  I have added avocados, thinly sliced mushrooms and even a sliced jalapeno for an extra kick.  Very nice indeed!  Thank you Michelle O'Sullivan for the submission.

A good recipe, but not as tangy or flavorful as I would have liked.  It turned out a little bland.  Overall, a tasty dish that could use a little tweaking.

Very good, I definetly recommend making the cucumber onion and dressing the night before. I used rice vinegar (its not as pungent as the apple cider) Then adding halved cherry tomatos about 3 hours before serving. Oh! Also make sure you seed the cucumbers.  Just slice longways and use a spoon to scrape out the seeds. Only takes a second plus it  Keeps your salad from getting slimy.

Very simple and delicious.  Everyone at my party asked for the recipe.  It is 5 stars w/ the following changes:  add 1 sliced read onion, use 1/8 c. balsamic and 1/8 c. apple cider vinegar, double the dill, cut the oil and half, refrigerate overnite for best results.

Love this recipe and make it often.  I brought it to a company picnic and it was gone quickly, with folks coming back for seconds and thirds.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, usually use white onions instead of red, and sub Splenda for the sugar.  I've also never used fresh dill - but, I buy a quality dried.

Just what I was looking for! Had 4 tomatoes, red onion, & 1/2 cucumber on hand. Added a jar of marinated artichoke heart (drained), a handful of pimento-stuffed green olives, and a clove of garlic (minced). Delicious!

Delicious salad.  I used apple cider instead of vinegar and also put sliced green, red and yellow peppers in it.  Gave it a wonderful flavor and color. Definitely will make again.

This was a wonderful easy dish to make.  The only change I would recommend is to maybe cut back on some of the oil (maybe try olive).  I had a lot of extra 'sauce' left over.  Very tasty!

The tartness of the vinegar and the sweetness of the sugar contrasted nicely with the fresh vegetables. Just delicious! My family kept sneaking tastes while it was sitting on the counter. I was afraid that I wasn't going to have any left for dinner!

Delicious!  I made this exactly as directed except I used salad vinegar instead of cider vinegar because I was out.  The preportions are perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My hubby said he could eat an entire bowl by himself. I did a few substitutions based on what I had in the house but it was still delish. I used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar; olive oil instead of vegetable oil; shallots instead of onion, and dried basil instead of dill. Great refreshing salad for summer meals.

This is my favorite salad. I make it almost every day in the summer. However,I never use sugar for it and I always add feta cheese on top when serving. For best results use sweet onion and seedless cucumbers. Be careful with the amount of vinegar you use; general rule is that a salad with tomatoes does not need a lot of vinegar. If you want quick, light meal for the summer add chopped ham, cubed cheese(your choice) mushrooms from a jar, and feta of course. Serve with a loaf of bread and voila-you have a healthy lunch, or dinner.

This is great. I have made it with cider vinegar and red wine vinegar, and I like the red wine vinegar much better because it has a bit more bite to it. I use olive oil instead of vegetable, and agree with marinating the cucumber and onion overnight before adding tomato. But any leftovers are fine in the fridge and seem to get better for a few days.

I followed the recipe as written the first time I made it and thought it was good.  The dill adds a nice flavor to the salad and provides a twist on the traditional oil and vinegar based cucumber salad.  The second time I made it, I used a white balsamic vinegar that I got from Trader Joe's, substituted zucchini for one of the cucumbers, and added a bit more dill and about 4 chopped basil leaves.  This salad can be altered by the simple addition of a different herb or a combination of herbs, and it is great served with grilled chicken or BBq ribs.

A good, noncreamy sald to add to a meal. Someone ate some of the cucumber that I planned to use, so I added red and green pepper to make up the difference. This makes a lot of dressing for the amount of salad, so you may want to drain it before serving. Thanks!

This is SO FABULOUS.  I have a ton of cucumbers right now, and this "salad" is an amazing way to use them!  I have bought this salad at the store ($3.99/lb!!), but this recipe is WAY better!!  Luckily, my husband doesn't like onions, so he doesn't even want to try it--but my 5 yr old daughter and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!  It's VERY yummy with mozzarella chunks in it.  I just took some of the string cheese sticks and sliced them in chunks to add to it.  Also, I prefer to eat this when it's closer to room temperature rather than when it's cold.  I think the amazing flavors come through much better!  I also just tried adding some red bell peppers to it and it was really good too!   THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for posting this recipe!!

Wonderful. Not to tangy or sweet.  I used half the amount of dried dill and used yellow and red cherry tomatoes.  I also threw in some feta cheese.

Even all the kids loved this!!!  I didn't have red onion, so substituted 1/4 cup heirloom white onion.  Also used brown sugar rather than white, and one zucchini for one of the cucumbers.  Didn't have fresh dill, so sprinkled with dried dill.  DELICIOUS only 10 minutes after making!  Imagine that if it had lasted a day it would have tasted even better tomorrow.  :)

Have made this delicious recipe twice this week: 1x for a dinner party of 14 women and 2 days later at my husbands request. I used Splenda and Apple Cider vinegar. Added extra dill the 2nd time. A wonderful, refreshing, pretty, easy and tasty salad.  It's a winner and I'll make it often. Thanks so much.

This was one of the best salads I have ever made. I made it for five guests and everyone commented on it. How often does that happen with a salad? It was simple to make and had a lot of wonderful flavor. I would make at least double the recipe for a family.

This is a good, basic salad. I only put in half the onion; I thought 1 cup would overpower it.  I used half olive oil and would use all olive oil next time because I think it added to the flavor.  I used to just use white vinegar, water, salt and pepper, so this was a good change from that.

Good.  I like a light salad but I think perhaps there was too much cider vinegar for me... I would like to maybe half with balsamic next time.  Still nice, just not perfected with recipe as is.

A good  recipe if you want to use up some of those garden veggies but I don't think there was anything spectacular about it... tasted good but nothing special... next time I will use olive oil instead of veggie oil so it actually adds flavor I am not sure what the purpose of the veggie oil is... I may cut back on the amount to to make it healthier... also add more dill and black pepper... marinating longer than 15 minutes did help too it allowed the flavors to really develop.. but overall not bad.. good combination of veggies

This is great when made with fresh from the garden ingredients in the summer. A dish is only as good as the sum of it's parts :o) I probably wouldn't make this in the winter since the tomatoes need to be prime. I doubled the ground pepper and dill weed and used olive oil as many other reviewers did. I also used green onion but this would be great with vidalia or red onion as well. After letting it sit 15 minutes as the recipe describes, I tasted it and decided to add garlic salt. We really enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

Cool and refreshing, this is an excellent summer salad.  I take it to every BBQ I go to now and people always rave.  As other's have said, I use olive oil instead of vegetable (MUCH healthier).  I also didn't have apple cider vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar.  I would probably cut down a little on it next time as it is a little "puckery."

I made this today for a Labor Day picnic. It was yummy! I made according to the recipe besides using dried dill. I give a 4 following the recipe. I decided to add a big scoop of mayo and make it a creamy salad and it is delicious like that! It is definitely a 5 star recipe that way.

Very good....the only changes I made were that I added more dill,  reduced the onion to 1/2 cup and used canola oil.  One cup of onion seemed like waaay to much. Will make again!

Delicious!  Made this with fresh veggies from our garden.  We cut the onion back to 1/2 cup and used canola oil.  This was easy to prepare and just the right salad to go with our pasta dinner.  Next time we will try olive oil and some crushed red pepper to spice it up.

This is a great summer salad.  I added an extra teaspoon of sugar to it which made it just a little sweeter.  I also used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I have been making this weekly and eating it with lunch everyday.

I made this for myself for lunch today.  I added garbanzo beans for more of a meal.  Next time I think I will add feta cheese.  Very good!

A perfect side dish on this VERY HOT evening. Refreshing and fast. We have a ton of cucumbers in the garden and this recipe will be used again. I left out the red onion (personal taste) and added a small shallot. Thanks for sharing!

LOVED IT!  I have made a similar recipe before with just the cucumbers and with white onions.  But I love that this one has tomatoes and red onion.  It was a nice twist and more healthy and delicious!

I scaled this down to 2 servings, as I was experimenting w/a variety of cuke salad recipes (I've never made it before and there are a TON of recipes out there...this was one of the 4 I selected).   I omitted the pepper, per personal preference, and used Vidalia onion & grape tomatoes, as those were what I had on hand, and subbed EVOO for veggie oil (just because).   This is a nice salad; I may make this again.  TY for a nice recipe!

Okay but not great.  I like all of the ingredients seperately but somehow this didn't do much for me.  If I decide to make it again, I may use red wine vinegar instead.

Too tart and lacked flavor.  I scaled recipe back to 3 servings, used fresh picked tomatoes and a large cucumber.  Subbed vidalia onion for the red onion.  Let marinate overnight but didn't help enhance the flavor.  Think I would rather just slice the tomato and cucumber and serve!

Husband really raved about this dish, even took leftovers with him to work the next day!  Followed the suggestions of earlier reviewers and used apple cider vinegar and olive oil.  We grilled some lemon pepper chicken, made some sweet corn on the cob and had a nice, healthy summery dinner.  Would recommend, like other reviewers, to marinate it for several hours or even overnight before serving--husband and I both thought it tasted even better the next day.  Definitely will be making this dish again.

I thought this salad was wonderful - very light and refreshing.  My company and family enjoyed it as well.  I made it two nights in a row and used 3 colors of tomatoes, then arranged it neatly on a serving tray.  The first time I made the dressing, in my haste I may have used regular white vinegar instead of cider vinegar, I discovered this possible error the 2nd time I made it.  I think it would taste great using either.

This is a great summer salad.  Instead of regular tomatoes, I used a pint of cherry tomatoes, sliced in half.  Great, light flavor, and a colorful salad.  Would be good with bell peppers, olives and/or feta cheese added.

This was so wonderful!  My husband, who would rather starve than eat vegetables, requested it again.  My 4 year old, who is a vegetable fanatic like her mother, didn't really like it much, but she isn't fond of vinegar.  Definately a keeper.

Easy and quick to make.  I used only about a quarter cup of finely diced red onion, and increased the dill to about a teaspoon.  I omitted the salt (low sodium diet) and didn't miss it!  Great recipe, thanks!

Loved it! Mixed all but cukes to marinate early, adding tomatoes last half hour. I also used less onion for the kids' sakes.

Actually I'd give this a 4.5.  I made it for my husband's family reunion and it was a big hit.  I followed suggestions for using English cucumbers, scraping out the seeds and cutting into chunks.  I also cut the tomatoes into chunks rather than leaving in wedges.  I substituted red wine vinegar and olive oil.  The fresh dill makes it so good.  I've already made it a second time and several people asked me for the recipe.  This will be part of my summer salad repertoire.

This recipe was fantastic! I've made a few minor changes since making it the first time. I omit the sugar and vinegar (saves on calories & sugar intake). Cut the oil in half (use olive instead of vegetable) and use fresh squeezed lemon (like one reviewer suggested). Also, I found it's easier to use cherry tomatoes instead of slicing large ones. Very light and refreshing... thanks for the recipe!

This is so good! I didn't give it five stars because I think the onion is a bit overpowering, so I cut back on that. Otherwise, it's delicious.  I always get a lot of compliments on this one.

This was easy, light, summery and healthy! Similar to a side dish mom made when I was a kid -- just reminds me of garden goodies.  Proves you don't need a dozen ingredients and exotic foods to create a flavorful, healthful dish.  Simple dishes have their place.

I drained it before serving, also. One guest raved about it, and the rest were complimentary. I cut back on the red onion because the one I bought was very strong.

This salad was pretty good, but I felt that it was rather watery, with not quite enough flavor. I used a regular onion instead of red, because that is all I had. I also used dried dill and cut the amount in half because it has a stronger flavor. Altogether, I liked the combinations of flavor/texture, but if I make it again, I will definitely do something to make it more flavorful.

Delicious! I used a large English cuke and left the skin on, olive oil instead of veg oil and reduced the sugar to 1/2 tsp. Very cool and refreshing, I also added more dill, fresh is key here. Dont skimp. Will make again. Thanks!

Yummy, Yum, Yum, Yum.  I hate vegetables and I LOVED this salad-even my picky, junkfood loving boyfriend loved it.  I've been trying to eat better lately and I love dishes with lots of flavor and this one had it.  I've noticed that most of the people giving this dish a low rating made changes to it.  I believe that is why they didn't like it as much.  Make the recipe as stated first, then you can see if there is something you'd like to change (I bet there won't be).

I thought it had a good fresh and crisp flavor, my husband thought it was ok, however he is not a big fan of dill. I did make minor changes, I used olive oil and 1/2 of what the recipe called. Also I did not have cider vinegar so I substituted for 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 white vinegar. I would make it again.

I really liked this recipe & found it refreshing, but I changed a few things.  First, I followed others' advice & used only 1/2 of the oil recommended & I used canola oil b/c of its milder flavor.  I also peeled & seeded the cucumbers.  For the tomatoes, I used Cherub tomatoes (they are small like cherry tomatoes but with a much better flavor) & I cut them in half lengthwise.  And I, too, like other reviewers, let the salad marinate much longer...in fact, it was even better the next day.  Enjoy!

I don't even really like tomatoes and I loved this light healthy salad! I will definitely make this again, although next time I might just use some onion powder instead of actual onions...I felt that the onion taste kind of overpowered everything, then again I am not a huge fan of onions either!

This is good.  I've been eating cucumbers and tomatoes in cider vinegar for years, but I never thought to add all this yummy extra stuff!  I only used 1/4 tsp of salt and still thought it was too salty.  Next time I'll leave that out completely.  Also I only used 1 cucumber and 1 1/2 tomatoes.  No onions because I didn't have any on hand.  Used olive oil instead of veg oil.  I only had dried dill, so I used 1/4 tsp but couldn't really taste it.  I'll double that next time.  Thanks for a yummy, easy, healthy recipe!

After very successfully growing my own fresh herbs for the first time this year, I searched allrecipes for a dill recipe and found this delicious one. I really wanted that fresh dill taste so I added more to taste, which ended up being triple what this recipe calls for.  If you like dill, don't hesitate to add a lot more.

Simple, refreshing and delicious!  I added more salt, more black pepper and more fresh dill.

Great recipe!  Definitely let the veggies marinate in the dressing for an hour or two before serving -- the taste is much more intense and delicious after sitting for a while.  Don't forget to stir while marinating so that the vegetables don't soften...

I used just a pinch of sugar as I am not fond of sweet veggies. Simple good side dish.

This is a great salad but should be eaten within one or two days of making it. Also, I would recommend less onion as the red onions are very strong.

This is an AWESOME recipe!!! I have also found the "ROMA" tomatoes work much better as they have very little seed pods and liquid and can be cut much quicker and easier!!!!  I just quarter them!!!

Pretty tasty.  A great light summertime salad or snack.  

I used 2 tbsp of cider vinegar and 2 tbsp of regular because I like the bit of extra bite it gives.  I also used splenda instead of sugar and extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil...will cut this down to 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil next time.  Used dried dill but it would have bees so much better with fresh!

This was a huge hit and very easy.  I used olive oil and can dill as I could not find fresh and it was excellent.  Have made about 3 times total.  Nice sub for a traditional salad.

Pretty good - I cut the oil down to 1 tablespoon to cut calories and that still was plenty.  The flavor was good.  I'd cut the cucumbers into smaller bite size pieces and use firm tomatoes otherwise they get mushy.  But a good recipe - thanks!!

I've always liked these types of salads... and the dressing here is the best.  I used olive oil, a little less onion, and the result was terrific.

I thought this recipe was okay, my husband liked it a bit more.  I think the amount of dressing was too much for the vegetables so the next time I made this I used less dressing.  Other than that I only altered it by using a sugar substitute.

This recipe was "okay" but I probably won't make it again. The flavors were good and it's a good way to use up extra garden vegetables, but it didn't knock my or my company's socks off.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I made a full batch and by the time my boyfriend was done with it there were just two bites left!  Unfortunately due to the oil it's not the healiest, but it sure is a tasty way to use up excess tomatoes and cucumbers.  I didn't have fresh dill so I used dried and it turned out just fine.

This is my go to recipe for a great and easy salad. I make this at least once a month. A small change I have made is that I use parisian cucumbers and grape tomatoes . I like bite size  instead of large pieces.  Other than that, there is nothing else that can make this recipe more perfect.

I could have given this 5 stars, because it was delicious, but I tend to save a five star rating for something that absolutely knocks my socks off.  Having said that: Yum!  I used english cucumber based on someone else's recommendation, and trimmed out the seeds to keep the salad from getting too watery.  I also had cherry tomatoes that I sliced lentghwise and used, which looked great.  The only other change was that I didn't have the right vinegar, so used rice vinegar.  It was perfect and going forward I'll just stick with the rice vinegar. If you are looking for a refreshing summer salad to accompany your main meal, try this one!

Too much vinegar for my tastes.  I added some olive oil to cut it but probably should have put more in.

This is a great salad and can be made according to your taste. My favorite variety so far is using rice and red wine vinegar and a lot of dill weed. In this version the sweetness comes from the vinegar and I don't add any sugar like the recipe calls for. It's also better if it sits a little before eating it.

So yummy! I made a few changes, just to use what I had and to make it a little healthier. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used a sweet Vidalia onion. I let the cucumber and onion marinate overnight, then added the chopped tomatoes, which I had taken the seeds out of, about an hour before I served.  Hubby could not get enough of it!

I thought it was pretty concentrated, so I added about 1/4 C more Canola Oil.   I wanted more of the dill flavor, so I doubled the amount.

I didn't like cucumber before I made this recipe. Now I make this salad at least once a month but it is best in summer when the veggies are in season. I love, love, LOVE this recipe and I make it EXACTLY as stated. Why mess with something that is already perfect?

Made this to go with dinner tonight.  Halved the recipe.  Used half the amount of dried dill (because that's what I had), and less salt.  Tasted and squeezed in a little fresh lemon juice and just a sprinkle more sugar.  I liked it and my husband *really* enjoyed it.  ~~Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, my family really enjoyed it!  I used really large english cucumbers so I doubled the rest of the recipe.  It made a bit much and we were concerned it would not get eaten, however we discovered that it tasted very good on sandwiches and it is sure to become a favorite sandwich fixin in this household.

Pretty good. This was a quick and easy way to use up some of the extra cukes from our garden.  Simple and refreshing as a side dish, and tasted even better the next day.  My husband used leftovers as a sandwich spread the next day (with turkey and swiss cheese) and raved about it.

This is good but nothing extraordinary.  I used half balsamic and half red wine vinegar, and olive oil instead of vegetable.  Its a refreshing low calorie healthy snack or side dish that I will make again.

this recipe needs to be altered to read, chill overnight.  i tried it after 2-3 hours, still bitter. yet, the next day delish... and still delish the day after. i primarily make this for myself to snack on, or be a small lunch. with a one and a half year old to run around after, it's tasty and fast.

This is amazing!!! So light and good- the first time I made it- I ate the whole bowl and didn't touch anything else I made for dinner! Make sure to seed the tomatoes and the cucumbers and it'll keep for another day without getting too soggy. Add another tomato too! So tasty- thank you for the wonderful recipe!

A good, solid variation on a common theme. I cut the oil to 2 tsp, and increased the dill to 1 tbsp, and it tasted great. I'll definitely be making this again.

Four stars as is, but I'm a fiend for avocado, so add in one of those and I'd switch it to five stars.  Easy to make and great for summer.

I used WAY more dill than called for; probably a tablespoon, maybe more, but then I really like fresh dill.  Also I added a couple cloves of pressed garlic.  Instead of sugar, I used Splenda and olive oil instead of plain old vegetable oil.  I thought the onion was just right.  A nice, refreshing salad.  Thanks, Michele!

My mom who is from Germany has made this salad all my life. She slices the cucumber very thin then puts them in a colander with salt to drain for a while this draws some of the bitter taste away.  The only other thing she does different is adding  just a little sugar to the mixture.

Absolutely fabulous! It is a little watery at the bottom, but that is all the flavor.  Made it exactly as written except for olive oil instead.  So so good!

I've been on a cucumber kick lately and these were VERY GOOD!  A little to sour for hubby and little one...but I thought they were perfect...great recipe!  I also recommend marinating for a couple hours before serving.

Lovely.  It isn't summer, but the weather here (in MN) is squeaking of spring - fresh "tastes" in the air.  Although my cucs and tomatoes weren't fresh out of the garden, the flavors blended delightfully for the near-spring time of year.  (Can't wait until summer!!)  I even forgot the onion - which I bought specifically for this salad(!) - and it came out great.  I did change one thing: used evoo instead of vegetable oil.  Felt it would give a more "full bodied" flavor to the entire.  Kids loved it, hubby loved it, I loved it.  Most important for me: it goes well with almost any type of main dish.

Super quick and super tasty. I will be making this one again soon. It will also stay good in the fridge for a while and not get soggy as a salad with lettuce would. This one is going in the recipe book!

Wonderful summertime dish that is a great way to use seasonal veggies and always gets compliments whenever I make it.  I use half the onions and only one large cucumber, though.  Yum!

I would give this a 4.5 if that was an option. It was really good, but not "knock-your-socks off" good. It was a super way to use my cucumbers and tomatoes from my garden though.  I didn't use much onion as the red onion seemed very strong when I was cutting it. I also used 1/2 apple cider and 1/2 balsamic vinaigrette.

This was pretty tasty. I used cucumbers and tomatoes from the farmer's market. Added some cubed mozzarella. It could use a little more kick...just not sure what.

light and refreshing! i scooped out the seeds from the cucumber and squeezed the juice from the tomatoes to reduce excess liquid from forming. left it to marinade in the fridge for 2 hrs before dinner and it was perfect.

This is awesome!  I've been craving the cucumber salad from Wyatt's Cafeteria (went there often as a child) and this truly hit the spot!  Thankfully, I just bought apple cider vinegar!  Wyatt's version didn't have the dill, but it's a welcome addition!

My family loved it. I'm not sure exactly how much onion I used as I did not measure it.  It was a medium sized red onion and I used the whole onion. I also cut the tomato into smaller pieces and cut the cucumber in half and scraped out the seeds. It was still good two days later. I will definitly make it again.

I finally found a cucumber recipe my husband loves.  He likes a tart dressing and with only 1 tsp. sugar, this is it!   I made full amount of dressing but only used 1 cucumber, 1 tomato and 1/2 cup onion and felt it was just the right amount of dressing.  I also let it marinade a little longer.
This was more than enough for the two of us.

Very tasty, colorful, and simple to make.  I used balsamic vinegar, simply because we enjoy the taste.  Good recipe!

We enjoyed this salad very much, though I had to make a few modifications just because of what I had on hand.  I used "salad vinegar" instead of cider, because that is what I had.  Also, didn't have fresh dill so I used dried but doubled the amount and also didn't ahve a red onion, so I used a Vidalia (sweet white) one instead.  I wish I'd had the red onion, but it was good this way as well.

This recipe really wasn't anything special - I made it exactly as listed, but there was something missing (oh, and I did use fresh dill).  Perhaps the flavors together were too simple for me, but others may enjoy!!!

Way to much vineger. I expected a milder flavor. It stunk up my frig even with the plastic wrapping.

This was pretty good! I used white wine vinegar instead due to what I had in the pantry. Also I skipped the onion, not a huge fan of it. Everyone who ate it thought it was really good. Not what they were used to so it was a nice change. Thanks I will make this again.

Very good! I cut down on the onions and used less oil... found that it tastes better if it sits a little longer before serving, it was even good the next day! I would say this makes a great side salad!

Good and light.  Didn't like the cucumbers as thin as I cut them, though...regular slices would be fine (I used a mandolin).

Wow!  These were so good I could not stop eating them.  I had a bunch of cucumbers and tomatos so I looked for a recipe to make with them and I'm so glad I found this.  The first batch is gone and I'm making another for the holiday weekend to take to a BBQ.

This salad turned out great. It's a good way to use cucumbers and tomatoes. I used balsamic vinegar and olive oil plus I doubled the dill. I didn't add any red onions or sugar.

This salad was good but not great.  It was not very flavorful - seasoning wise.  The onion was a little overwhelming.  My husband liked it but suggested more salt.

A very nice way to use up end-of-the-summer tomatoes and cukes. I served this with corn-on-the-cob, sliced ham, homemade bread, and cheese for a great lunch.

Great salad.  I added a little garlic since we are garlic lovers around here.  We also prefer Roma tomatoes.  Next time, we will try fresh basil instead of dill.
