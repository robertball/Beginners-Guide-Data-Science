This can be an excellent dish if a few things are changed. I've also submitted a photo which should be up once it's approved. I use a buffet 1/2 tray.. 2 boxes of potatoes but only one of the cheese mix packets. Discard the other one. Use about 3 cups of milk... I use about 1/4 of the package of the coctail weiners.. just layer them once on top of the potatoes.. don't use as much ham either. I add a little garlic, too. I also use 2 cans of the french fried onions.. add extra cheese.. Bake a little longer since you are using 2 boxes of potatoes.. Be sure and taste your potatoe to make sure it is cooked all the way. I've made this dish about a dozen times and it's always the first to go on a buffet line. Well worth the FAT! :)

I decided to try this, as I liked all of the ingredients, and it had recieved mostly good reviews,however I was very disappointed. It LOOKED & SMELLED really good, but it was extremely salty (and I like salty).

I served this on a buffet line next to 5 other dishes. I got so many compliments on this dish and it was the first to go although I did not follow the recipe exactly. First, it doesn't state weather you use the cheese that comes in the box of potatoes. I used 2 boxes of potatoes and one package of the cheese which I mixed with one can of cream of mushroom, 2 cups of milk, 1/4 cup butter. I then only used 8oz of the coctail franks. I followed the rest of the recipe. I used a buffet half tray to bake it in. Delicious.

I followed the directions exactly. It was an OK
casserole. It needed more flavor. My husband took it to his company buffet table, people thought it 
was alright, but nothing to write home about.

I had to try this recipe because some said it was good and some say it wasn't.  To me this was average.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my boyfriend with a few tweaks. The boxes of potatos I had were smaller sized, so I pretty much doubled up the recipie, but i only had one can of cream of mushroom so used some cheddar cheese soup. It was so creamy and cheesy! I left out the mushroom as he doesn't like them and he suggested adding in another veggie next time like green beans.

My family loved this receipe.  I found it a little too rich for my taste though.  Next time I make it I will not add the cream cheese or the fried onions.
