This recipe is essentially a reworked version of a Thai classic, 'Green Mango Salad'.  If you replace the mangoes in this recipe with green (unripened mangoes), the flavor is more intense, and texturally superior.  Replace the 4 mangoes with green mangoes (peeled, separated from pith, and cut into matchsticks - not chunks). Using essentially the same ingredients, except nix the olive oil (totally unnecessary fats), add 2-3 tablespoons (varies with size of mangoes) fish sauce and 1 tablespoon sugar PER mango used, when dressing with lime, cilantro, etc. Replace shallots with red onions for a milder flavor.  Allow to marinate some 10-15 minutes and top with chopped toasted peanuts or cashews before serving.

I used thinly sliced red onion instead of shallots. Instead of red pepper flakes, I used thin slivers of sweet red peppers. The tastes complemented one another beautifully and it was a very pretty salad also!

WOW, I LOVE THIS!!!  We normally stay away from recipes with no reviews, but took a chance.  I only gave it 5 stars because there is not a 50 star button.

This was an interesting compliment to BBQ meat. 
Found the pepper flakes to be a bit strong, so I suggest using less. A good sweet mango is a stand alone flavor, & I felt the spices masked its sweetness and didn't really enhance it.

This is really good and really refreshing. I'd say don't use over ripe mangoes or it will get soupy.

ALSO- a really nice variation to try: replace Cilantro with Basil if you like basil more.

I have made this twice & we love it; however, the 1T red pepper flakes is unbelievable.  I sifted it with a strainer to keep the seeds out & used only a tiny amount of red pepper, but it was still overpowering.  Next time I will try Peggy's suggestion to use red onion & red bell pepper.

This recipe is superb! I made it as a side dish with a grilled ginger chicken and it was great. I might try it with fish next time. This one is definately a keeper!

A tad too spicy for me, but overall very summery and interesting. Will probably make again with half the pepper.

This is similar to a mango 'salsa' I make - using the Thai sweet chili sauce (sweet & spicy) instead of the red pepper flakes.  Great served with tortilla chips!

This is oddly wonderful. The olive oil is sooo not necessary; and any more liquid would be a bad thing. Also, I used only about half a Tablespoon red pepper flakes and I'm glad I held back - it still had a real kick to it! The mangos are best if they're just ripe and still somewhat hard (of course, it's hard to tell where they are exactly in the ripening process); with very soft mango, the dish gets a little mushy and unattractive. But use a slotted spoon to serve and you're fine - even with leftovers!

I make this recipe just like the directions call for it, and it is always a crowd-pleaser.  It's mangpo season right now in Florida, so it's an inexpensive salad to pair with Pancit or Shrimp Quinoa.

I made this, tonight, with what I had on hand.  I didn't have enough mango, so I used equal parts of mango, fresh pineapple and avocado and left the dressing ingredients intact.  There was enough fruit for 4 servings, so I cut down on the dressing accordingly.  The cilantro and green onions I eyeballed.  And just threw in enough red pepper flakes to complement and color without overpowering.  Maybe 1 tsp.  Fabulous!  My husband doesn't like mango, but told me to write this one down; it's a winner!

Wonderful salad!  Very refreshing, not too overpowering with the red pepper flakes, and the lime juice really goes well with the mango.  I didn't realize I liked mango so much until this salad.

I was searching for side dishes to accompany last night's dinner of General Tao Tofu and rice.  This salad was exactly what my meal needed.  I did cut down on the pepper flakes, but only because I wanted a less spicy side dish to cool the heat of my main dish.  This was so simple, yet sooooo good!  I do love the combination of sweet, salty, tart and spicy all together, which this recipe definitely has.

This mango salad recipe is absolutely amazing and delicious.  It is really easy to put together, but the flavors are complex and have such great variety.  This is going to be a recipe that we make many times over in the future.

I had no shallots or cilantro, but I added in almonds, red & green pepper thinly sliced and red onions. I also only added in about a 1 tsp of evoo. This was a pretty good mango salad, I have never actually followed a recipe for a mango salad (I usually just improvise) the only thing different about this recipe from what I usually do is the red pepper flakes which was a nice twist. A great addition to an Asian inspired meal, I served this with the "wicked garlic tofu saute" from this site and rice.

This is an awesome recipe to have fun with.  After making it many times, I don't use olive oil, scallions or red pepper.  Instead, put coarsely diced mango in large bowl.  Add 4-6 sliced green onions. Dice the avocados and drizzle with juice from half a lime to prevent browning.  Add to mango.  Put remaining lime juice in a small bowl along with 3 tbsp sweet chili sauce. Add cilantro and 1...or 2! deseeded, finely diced jalapeños. Whisk to combine and then pour over mango, gently folding everything together. Cover and put in fridge for 20-30 minutes. Mix once to blend flavors. Thanks to MIRELLE67 for the original recipe!

Loved this!!  So simple and tasty.  Next time I'll use red onion as shallots are a bit overpowering.  Chopped up little that was left over and put over grilled salmon - Yummy!!

Have made this several times & really easy to make.  We like spicy, but are still trying to find the right amount of red pepper flakes for us.  We're down to trying 1/4 tsp  for a serving of 3.  Love those mangos.

In my country (Jamaica) this is called pepperpot. But here's how we do it: almost ripe mangoes, salt to taste, scotch bonnet (or any other HOT pepper), vinegar (optional). We don't even chill it.

As a child I used to just sit under the mango tree with my bowl of "turn" mangoes, knife, salt, and pepper. AMAZING!!!

Hubby loved it. I thought it was too hot and the mango was a pain in the butt to prepare.  Next time I'll cut back some on the heat and I'll buy already prepared mango. This really tried my patience making it.  Again 4 stars because hubby loved it.

This is quite good, but unless you have a palette for VERY spicy foods, I would cut the pepper flakes WAY back! Also, if you are trying to save on calories, you can omit the oil or reduce it significantly, in my opinion.

Great recipe. To add a bit more substance to this, I added crushed cashews and broccoli slaw. Watch the red pepper, if you don't like heat.

This was my first time trying mango salad and I didn't really know what to expect. I found this recipe and it sounded interesting so I tried it and I think it turned out great ! Thanks will definitely be making it again.

So delicious! It sounds weird, but I like to add a little bit of chili sauce and some peanuts to the recipe. It's nice if you like things a little bit more spicy.

The changes I made were based on availability in my kitchen. I used red onion vs shallots, 1 smaller Thai green chilli (it makes it extra spicy hot) and a full lime regardless of size.    I got a rave review on my adapted version and have made it continually all summer.  Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome!! Made it without the red pepper flakes first, since the friends we were making it for don’t do spicy. Still delicious. Added the red pepper the next day. Yummy!! Everyone loved it. So easy and delicious.

Easy to make.  A novel Thanksgiving side dish.  ;)    Yum.  Heat and Sweet!  However we do not like it with  olive oil.  Another splash of juice or vinegar improves drastically.

I used only half of the pepper flakes called for in the recipe. It was still yummy and good for friends who are not so fond of really spicy foods.

The hardest part is chopping the mangoes...and it is equivalent to our local Thai restaurant.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I would just suggest 1/2 of the red pepper flakes. It gets spicier as it sits in your refrigerator. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars

This was great!  I served it with grilled shrimp and it was wonderful to take a bite of the mango salad and the shrimp, too.  I added a about 2 Tbs. brown sugar to the dressing before pouring it over the mangoes.
