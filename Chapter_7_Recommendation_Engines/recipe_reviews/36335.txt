This recipe was AWSOME and so easy.  I also added yellow squash and cherry tomatoes.  I cut the vegetables up and split them up between 2 large zipper bags and put 1 T. of oil in each bag and 1 T. of seasoning in each bag (instead of only 1T. for the whole recipe).  I also added a little more seasoning once on the plate.  We had never grilled vegetables before and they turned out perfect will make many more times.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I made it with whole mushrooms, quartered red onion, yellow squash and zucchini.  Put it on a cookie sheet covered with foil that I sprayed with olive oil spray.  I broiled it in the oven 4" from the heat.  It was great.  Not one piece was left over.  Will make this again very soon.  Thanks McCormick

This recipe was very good. I wished that the vegetables were more flavorful-I will probably be more liberal with the seasoning next time. I made a mixture of summer squash, zuchini, red, yellow and green bell peppers, white onion, garlic, green beans, brocoli, and snow peas and grilled them in my grill basket.  They were very very good and the only thing I'll do differently next time is add more seasonings.

These vegetables were so good!  For color, I used one summer squash and one zuchinni, and I also one red pepper and one green pepper.  I made 1 1/2 times the oil and seasoning mix and grilled the veggies on a large piece of aluminum foil for about 15 minutes.  My family loved them!

Very good. I did make a few changes, I prepared the marinade with the recipe on the back of the packet. I placed the marinade in a large ziploc bag and added Zucchinni, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and plum tomatoes. I filled the bag with the veggies and let marinate in the ziploc bag for about a half an hour (turning the bag frequently). I then lined the grill with foil and placed them on the grill for about 20 minutes. Very great recipe!! I served this with the Cajun Chicken recipe from this website.

Quick and very easy.  As several people said in earlier reviews, increase the oil and seasonings by 1.5 times at least.  The first batch came out a little bland.  I used different colored peppers and squash to give this great colors.

I marinated the vegetables overnight for vegie kabobs the next day.  The guests liked it.  Good flavor.  Next time I may sprinkle a bit more on the vegies right before they are grilled for more flavor.

I may also try Shilling's seasoning next because there's alot of similarity between the two and I still have a whole container of that left.

Good recipe... I've roasted them in the oven as well as on the grill and they're easy either way! Great way to use up spare veggies.

Tasty!  We just got a grill wok/pan, and I'm in love with grilled veggies!  I used regular montreal steak seasoning and mixed in some jarred roasted garlic.

Use whatever veggies you like.  We tried portobello mushrooms, zuchini, aparagas and red peppers and spanish onions.  Used a grilling basket with a lid that keeps them all in place.  Very salty, don't go overboard with the seasoning.  Really good. I don't measure anything just toss with oil and sprinkle all over but not completely covering the veggies.
