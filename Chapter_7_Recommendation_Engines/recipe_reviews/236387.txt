There was way too much sauce between what was inside and then the sauce on the top before baking. I used scallops and shrimp and the flavors were good although a little to bland. I would leave out the mayo ( don't see the point) add a little more fresh lemon and reduce the sauce holding the shrimp by about half. Some fresh parsley or better yet, tarragon, would have set it off nicely.

We loved this recipe!  Crepes turned out perfectly and filling was exceptional.  I made as written with the exception of substituting scallops for lobster meat and saut√©ing 4 mushrooms with the filling mixture.  A huge favourite.  Thanks for sharing!

Didn't do the sauce, just used what was left from the filling but very yummy.

Added baby bella mushrooms, chopped and seasoned with thyme and salt, good amount of chopped scallions, thinned the sauce with white wine.  Topped the stuffed crepes (about 5 shrimp per) with remaining sauce that cooked the shrimp and a sprinkle of parm.  Delicious!
