If you are going to make it easy then, saute chicken on one side until it starts to turn golden around the edges then flip over ann your chicken stock, wine and lemon SLICES, not juice and simmer until it is done. Plate the chicken and swirl in whole butter, that will give the sauce a nice sheen and a thickener, nape the sauce over the chicken and then garnish with parsley..SEE one pan, easy!

This was a big hit. Yummy Yummy. I did have to change a few things around. I also ready from the person who originally wrote it that there was a type so pay attention to that. I had 2 very big boneless breasts that I cut thru the middle to make 4 thin pieces of chix. I don't really know the weight for the chicken I used. I did juice from one good size lemon and used only 1 1/2 cups of chix broth. When I made my cornstarch mixture...it was a good 4 teaspoons mixed with 4-5 teaspoons of water. I didn't bake anything. I just made the sauce. Seared the chicken. Than added sauce to chick pan and put on low with cover on until done. OH SO YUMMY!!!!

Great recipes.  I cut all of my chicken into strips and cooked all the way through.  I then added the heated sauce and let them simmer for 10 minutes.  There is no reason to turn the oven on.  I would make this again.   :)

Excellent !! I made a few modifications.  I added 1 chopped shallot, plenty of chopped garlic, and a ton of freshly cracked black pepper to the butter after i cooked the chicken and before I added the broth/wine.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of wine, as I prefer a stronger taste. I then put the chicken & sauce in a pan and threw it in the oven (just to make sure the chicken is cooked completly) The chicken came out SUPER juicy!  This was EXACTLY what I was looking for !! 

I also used the extra flour to thickin the sauce.

mmmmmmmm !!

The clumpy white comes from not adding the cornstarch to water before adding it to the hot liquid. Im glad most of you enjoyed this.

If I could rate it 4 3/4 stars, I would!  I was worried about the backwards dredging, but it came out great. I used two chicken breasts and only two eggs.  I also used re-hydrated parsley flakes. I think the sauce could have been a little thicker.  I mallet-hammered my chicken and made medallions.  Hubby said "I'd give it a 5" and it was gone in a blink.  The chicken was OUTRAGEOUSLY tender.  I did use cooking sherry instead of white wine because it's hard to buy wine where I live and I was out.  I will definitely try it again with all the exact ingredients and maybe a smidge more cornstarch. This chicken REQUIRES bread to soak up all the delicious sauce. Thanks for a yummy meal!

This is the same basic recipe I've been using for years. Actually, I never had a recipe. One day I just decided to wing it based on what I had tasted in restuarants and I thought it was terrific. The only thing I do is add a little garlic powder and dried parsley flakes, along with A LOT more lemon juice to the sauce. I have my daughter taste test for the right amount of lemon as we go along as this is her all time favorite meal. Thanks Elaina for reassuring me that I've been doing it right all along!

Let me start by saying I'm arguably the worst cook in the world.  Therefore, it took me about an hour and a half to make this dish, but it was worth it. My boyfriend and I loved it!  My only complaint is that the sauce wouldn't thicken, but it was really good anyway.  Also, you should definitely use thin cutlets of chicken. The ones I used were a little too thick and therefore took forever to cook.  Served over linguini w/ fresh italian bread - one of the best meals I've had in a long time!

I loved this dish.  I only changed one thing about this recipe.  I added a bit of garlic powder to the flour mixture and a little bit to the sauce.  Everything else I followed exactly.  This came out wonderfully and had TONS of flavor.  I can't wait to make this one again.  Thanks for the post.

chicken francese is one of the most frequent dishes I order out, Its a favorite! I decided to try to make it at home. I variated this recipe just a little to what I had on hand and I used thin sliced chicken breasts, I salted & peppered them. I dredged in flour,(no egg.. forgot it!) and sauteed & browned nicely in vegetable oil in large skillet, probably 5 mins or so set chicken aside on a plate, to the skillet I added  about 1 & 1/2 cups broth, 1/2 cup or so Arbor Mist white zinfandel (all I had)  1 fresh lemon squeezed dry on a hand juicer, couple big chunks of butter, salt/pepper/garlic powder & parsley. I let that cook down just a bit, I didnt have corn starch so i used flour to thicken a bit, added my browned chicken to the sauce, covered & simmered for another 5-7 minutes or so.. last thing i did was stir in another pat of butter & served over hot pasta...my husband said, we dont need to go out to eat anymore if i can get meals like this at home! It really was delicious, so much so that I plan on making it for company.

Wonderful! I made a few changes: Added some garlic powder to the sauce. Made sure I mixed the cornstarch with water before adding and then brought the sauce to a boil to thicken. Also, dredged the chicken in Bisquick instead of the eggs and flour. My family loved it! I will definitely make it again! So easy!

We think this is a terrific restaurant quality recipe! I've found that 2 lemons usually give me about a 1/4 cup of lemon juice. That's good for me to remember just in case I don't have fresh lemons on hand and have to use bottled lemon juice instead. Thanks for sharing!

this recipe was sooo good! my husband and sister were very impressed. I served this with angel hair pasta, and just used the sauce from the chicken. 

The only changes I made were using 1 clove fresh cut garlic, and when I found my sauce a little too thick, I used some heavy cream to thin it out a bit.
Cheers! 5*s for sure!!!

The sauce was delicious but didn't have the right consistency, I would use a little more cornstarch and you only need one egg beaten with a little milk.

This recipe made my mouth water when I read it. Then, it took longer to make than it said it would, the coating on the chicken was like scrambled eggs, the sauce did not thicken according to the directions, the chicken was tough and the taste was bland. I have already tossed the recipe and will not even try to modify it. There is just too much wrong with it. The 4 star rating is very deceiving.

This is a great recipe as long as you dissolve the cornstarch in water then add it to the sauce.  I add a little more lemon juice and it comes out perfect.  I like to make this for company because you can brown the chicken ahead of time then just do the last part when company arrives.  I also add a little more lemon.  Leave the chicken in the oven until the sauce bubbles.....this guarantees chicken that will fall apart!  It's one of our favorite dishes!

I think this was really good and definitely really easy, but I gave it 4 stars because the sauce is too thin and you definitely don't need to turn the oven on at all. I would also watch now big the lemons are - I had 2 huge ones and the lemon flavor was overpowering so I had to cut it with more ckn broth. Next time I will either use flour instead of corn starch or use more cornstarch because it was too thin. I made the ckn as written and made the sauce as written, but then just added the ckn to the sauce and called it a day... no need to put in oven at all. Overall, it was pretty darn good.

This recipe is insane. The whole family went nuts over it. Even my picky 5 and 2 years old went nuts with a little Parm cheese on top, yum. I've never eaten this dish out anywhere let alone make it. I was not at all disappointed. I did make few adjustments as other users suggested. I used 1 egg and beat it with 1 Tbsp milk for the coating and there was plenty to do 4 skinless boneless thin chicken cutlets. It cut down on the egg taste, but still cooked and browned beautifully. I don't keep lemons on hand so I substituted 4 Tbsp lemon juice. I did end up using about 5 tsp cornstarch mixed with 5 tsp water to get the sauce to thicken right, but remember as the sauce cools it does slightly thicken. I added garlic to the sauce as well. I did not bake this dish I opted to dirty several dishes on the stove top instead. I sauted the chicken with 1 Tbsp olive oil and just kept turning it. When it was almost cooked I turned the heat down. It came out very moist this way. I made my sauce in a separate pan. I also used other suggestions to serve with angel hair pasta and broccoli. I placed the pasta on each plate and dotted with butter, encircled the pasta with the broccoli, placed the chicken on top and then spooned sauce over the top of each one. It looked great and tasted even better. This recipe is a new family favorite!!

This was very good.  I made a mistake and started making it before i checked on the wine situation in my house.  Instead of the white wine i used a tiny bit of white wine vinegar and worchestershire sauce.  It turned out fine.  My husband liked it and asked for it to be put on the regular rotation.  It was so very easy.  I cut the chicken breasts in half vertically and horizontally, then pounded them flat.  Cooked up super fast!

Adding milk to the egg would make the chicken cook better when in the frying pan and take away the egg taste

the sauce to this was good but thin.  i too used more corn starch.  my problem with this is i used thin sliced cutlets and just about cooked them through, but when i took them out of the oven they were not done all the way.  i covered the dish with foil and cranked the heat to 375 and cooked it 15 min. more.  by that time i wasn't in the mood to eat it and my bf took the whole thing home.  he loved it though and i served it to him over bow ties.  i might try this again i don't know.

This was very good! My husband isnt a fan of lemon so I only used one (wish I would have used the other, I love lemon).I thought it was a great light sauce, he said it was just ok, he likes bold flavors, but he said as long as I dont mind him adding stuff to it, he would eat it again. I surved it with linguini and garlic bread!  I will be making again!

excellent recipie - fast and easy
Just a note, those who are getting clumps are probably not used to using cornstarch.  Dissolve the cornstarch in a little COLD water first to get a very thin paste, then gradually whisk it into the sauce

This was a wonderful recipe that produced what I've only been accustomed to eating in restaurants.  I pounded each chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch and then cut them in half.  Also, I ended up adding more cornstarch to get a slightly thicker sauce.  The overall flavor was delicious!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is really good - I'll just make a couple changes next time around. The biggest change is use a little less lemon juice. My lemons were quite large, so that could be part of it, but it was a bit over-powering.  I also did not put this in the oven - because my oven died in the morning.  I cooked the chicken in my cast-iron skillet, then removed it to a plate while I made the sauce. Once the sauce had thickened I added the chicken back into the skillet and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  Good stuff!!

I made this last night. It was awesome. The leftovers were great the next day. The only thing that I will do next is not add salt to the sauce, when I prepare it. It was very close to the same dish that I have had at "Provinos," an Italian restaurant that I love a lot. I served it over noodles. I will make this over again and again.

I hardly ever cook...but am trying to do more now than I have a 3 year old. This was easy and delicious and my son ate it up! I did cut the broth in half and added more wine and tons of lemon...as that's my taste. Thanks for this one! I love eating Chicken Francese when dining out, so it's nice to find an easy one to make in!

This was delicious.  Next time I may thicken the sauce a little more just because that is how I'd like it.

This was excellent. My husband wanted me to give it 19 stars out of 5, he loved it so much. I did use about 4 tsps of corn starch mixed with 4-5 tsps of cold water to thicken the sauce as suggested in another review, which was perfect. I also put salt and pepper in with the dredging flour. Other than that I followed the recipe. I love that I could saute the chicken and make the sauce and then when my husband was on his way home, I put the sauce over the chicken and put it in the oven to heat it though so it was freshly cooked and ready at the perfect time. I served it over angel hair pasta with fresh steamed broccoli (the sauce was excellent over the broccoli, too, and there was plenty of it). Was as delicious and pretty as anything you'd find in a fancy restaurant. I highly recommend this recipe.

This sauce is a gem in my recipe box...not only can it be used for chicken but also fried fish. I added "old bay seafood seasonings to it just a dash and it was terrific.

This was a good recipe but too much chicken broth and I did the whole recipe on the stove, no need to bake it...but it was good...also only used one lemon.

Although delicious, I had a problem with the thickness of the sauce. Basically, it never thickened! I tried to use some cornstarch but that didn't seem to the trick. Hmm. Other than that, it was rather delicious and easy to make!

Made exactly as is, served with angel hair pasta and some garlic roasted broccoli- perfect.  Huge hit at dinner, and made enough sauce to pour over the pasta, delicious!

I was not a fan of this...the others who ate it said they liked it. It seemed rather lemony and I only used half of the lemon that was called for. My standards may be too high because I love Maggiano's Chicken Francese and this didn't taste at all like that. Overall, I likely wouldn't make this again unless someone begged me to.

My sauce didn't sauce, I didn't like the flavor, and the coating came of the chicken in slimy pieces after being baked in the sauce.  I gave it 2 stars because the chicken was really moist. I will not make this again, but if I did, I think I would make a roux as the base of the sauce and add a reduced amount  of liquid from there.

This was excellent and very tasty!  I did change a few things as others had suggested (added garlic poweder and finishing up the cooking right in the pan with the sauce).  I served over whole grain rice that was flavored with a bit of stock.  Even my boys loved it!  Thank you!

This was really delicious as well as very easy.  I think next time I will cut the lemon juice a little (maybe use smaller lemons).  I had to use dried parsley, but it worked out OK. Served over linguini with asparagus on the side, crusty bread and the rest of the bottle of pinot grigio.

This was my first attempt at chicken francese.  I made it for a big family dinner and everyone loved it!  I added a little extra cornstarch as a few others had suggested to help thicken the sauce.  And I combined the sauce over the chicken on the stove without ever using the oven.  After I took the chicken francese off the stove, I let it sit for a bit so the sauce could thicken.  I served it with egg noodles and it was delicious.  And very easy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was great!  I had to add a little more cornstarch because it wasn't thickening like I wanted it to.  I also poured the juices from the pan over the chicken to add more of the flavor it's supposed to have.  Saute mushrooms using some leftover juices. It's great!

This recipe was pretty good.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  The only trouble I had was the cornstarch.  I used cold water and boiled but it never would thicken.  My husband loved the chicken but said he could do without the pasta.  My 15 year old son didn't care for it at all but I thought it was pretty good.  I will probably make it again but will add more cornstarch next time.  I thought dredging the chicken in the flour first and then the egg was weird but I loved how it turned out.  Will do it like that from now on when frying chicken.  Really had a great presentation!

This is definitely a keeper!  Tasted just like it does at restaurants.  I used thin cut chicken cutlets and they cooked up beautifully.  I was making 6 pieces of chicken so I increased the sauce by 50%, but I had a lot more sauce than I needed, which is fine because it give me an excuse to make this again tomorrow!  Elaina, Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This was good but it is really hard to have the perfect amount of lemon without measuring, I juiced 2 lemons and had alot of juice and mine turned out with way to much lemon...and I LOVE lemon but it was over powering. I also used alot more cornstarch since I wanted alot thicker sauce..

A great recipe for the sauce, but I'm not sure about the breading part. I did half the chicken the way the recipe wants and the other ones with flour, then egg, then bread crumbs (my usual way). Both were good, but I prefer the second.

This was a delicious and simple recipe but I'm rating this based on my modifications which were: (as suggested by another) I cooked in a pan until golden around edges, flipped over and added the sauce ingredients EXCEPT the butter - allow to simmer until cooked. NOTE: I mixed the sauce ingredients together first and I doubled the cornstarch I also added sliced lemon to the pan.  After the chicken is cooked through, I removed the chicken, add the butter and let that melt with the sauce, before pouring over the chicken on the plates.  As also suggested, I added garlic powder to the flour.   I didn't need to use all 4 eggs - 2 would have been good.  I served with canned sliced potatoes baked in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes with melted butter, salt, pepper, paprika and parsley.  Quick, easy and delicious!

Made it as described, but added a bit of garlic and some fresh lemon slices (simmered in broth) as suggested from previous reviewers. I served it over fettuccine w/a salad. Very yummy and all plates were completely clean by end of meal! Thx for a great recipe for my family and friends.

I made a few adjustments to the original recipe and it was great!  I only used 3 eggs which was enough for 7 thin cutlets and dipped them in egg, flour then egg again, and I added garlic powder to the egg.  I used 1 cup of white wine and only one lemon, plus added a pinch of tarragon at the end which finished it off nicely. I served it over rice with corn everyone had seconds!

This was delicious!  Only thing I did a little differently, was I pounded the chicken until is was very large and thin.  Make sure to dip chicken in flour first then egg! Pan fry in about a tbsp oil until lightly golden each side.  I found the sauce a little runny, so I think next time I would use a little less chicken stock and a little more cornstarch.  Make sure to mix cornstarch in a little bit of water before adding to liquid, otherwise it will clump.  Everyone loved the flavour of this recipe.  Thanks

This recipe is fabulous.  The sauce was delicious and everyone enjoyed it.  I took the others advice and cooked it all on the stove top, but a lot of my sauce boiled away.  Next time, I'm going to cook my chicken all the way through then add the sauce for only a minute or two.

I've experimented with a lot of chicken/ lemon recipes and this is my favorite. I didn't have to change it at all! Well, I did have to multiply the recipe because I served it at a dinner party for 25 people. Yummy noises throughout- great recipe!

I love this recipe. It is so delicious. I use thinly sliced chiken cutlets, add mushrooms and also do the whole recipe in a skillet. I serve the extra sauce over thin spaghetti. Everyone raves about this!!

This recipe was great. the chicken coating was super tasting. I first sauteed minced garlic before making the sauce and used more flour to thicken sauce. This is a keeper.

Fabulous! I pounded the chicken breasts just a little thinner and used flour to thicken the sauce - it required more than 1 tablespoon - I just eyed it until it was thick enough. I also added garlic and onion powder to the sauce. The flavors mixed perfectly, and it was delicious over fettucine florentine!

The proportions in this recipe didn't work for me.  Too many eggs, too much chicken broth and way to much lemon juice.  (Two lemons makes a whole lot of juice) Also my sauce didn't thicken at all and it was very bland.  I tried my best to make this recipe work and it didn't.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I can't wait to make it again.  I cut a few calories by omitting the butter and it still tasted great!

This was delicious!!! I had to make a few changes to adjust to what I had on hand. I didn't have any white wine so I used a whole can of chicken broth. I had jared lemon juice instead of fresh. I also had dried parsley instead of fresh. It still came out delicious! I served it over rice and even my 2 1/2 and 5 year olds loved it. Next time I will make sure I have the proper ingredients on hand and I'm sure it will come out even better. Thanks for the recipe!

OK recipe, but not at all like the Chicken Francaise recipe I loved from a restaurant that's no longer in business.  If I make it again, I'll cut way down on the chicken broth, and add more lemon & butter.  I would pan saute the filets and make the sauce right in the same pan.  I'll skip the baking step.  Also, next time I'll buy chicken tenderloins instead of full boneless breasts.

The picky boyfriend said "This smells awesome" then "This tastes awesome.  We're keeping this one."  He also suggested that this be served with string beans and mashed potatoes.  I really enjoyed it too--it was a piece of cake to make too.  I halved the recipe (since there's only 2 of us), but I added more cornstarch since I thought the gravy was a bit thin.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks Elaina!!

Bearing in mind that recipes are just guidelines.
for instance the cornstarch should be mixed with cold water before stirring it in or it will have lumps. and the amount of wine and chicken broth should be adjusted according to what is needed when preparing this dish. I did this, and got rave reviews.  will repeat it next week.  John

Very tasty but the flour/egg mixture stuck to the pan while trying to saute and the cornstarch should be mixed w/ a little cold water before adding to the sauce so it won't form clumps.

This is the first recipe I have tried from this site.  It was awsome.  My husband loved it, and he's a very picky eater.  We like to have left overs, so I doubled the recipe, added a bit more lemon, and butter.  The other thing I did was strain the sauce over the Chicken.  My husband hates parsley, so I got the flavor without him seeing it.  The added benefit was straining out any of the cornstarch that was gloppy.  I served it over pasta and fresh steamed broccoli, and it was fantastic.

It is an easy and elegant dish. This is the kind of dish you can make if you are not a veteran cook and you want to impress. Serve the chicken over some linguini, garnish...What a delight!

Chicken Francese has always been my favorite dish.  I eould have never thought that it could be so easy to make, and so delicious at the same time.  The sauce is also really tasty and lite to have with pasta.

This was a pretty easy recipe to make. Like other reviewers, the sauce is a bit thin and I’d recommend adding more cornstarch when creating the sauce. To compensate for that, after putting it in the oven, I ended up pouring the sauce into a saucepan, adding more cornstarch, and cooking it down, then pouring it over the chicken again. Variations: Instead of chicken breasts, I used boneless thighs (I prefer dark meat). I seasoned the thighs prior to dredging to add more flavor (garlic powder, onion powder, coriander,seasoned salt, Italian seasoning). I also sautéed thighs in 3/4 coconut oil and 1/4 olive oil. Other than that followed recipe with cooking in stove first then putting in oven. Much better than other recipes I’ve tried.

Very simple and delicious recipe. I grew up on this meal and it taste just like my moms! Its a great meal to make ahead of time as well. There is more sauce that chicken so I usually make it over pasta or potatoes to drain up this amazing sauce.

Yum! This was easy and delicious and it made my house smell amazing. The next time I make this, I'll serve it with rice to soak up all of the delicious sauce.

I made this 25# of chicken (118 pieces) using this recipe for our Italian Lodge feeding 74 people and serving over angle hair. I made extra of the liquid so I had plenty for the pasta. I sliced lemons put on each piece before I cooked the chicken. The meal was well received and what little was left was purchased for take home.

This was super yummy!!!  My husband said he hasn't tasted chicken francese this good in years.  I had to add a bit more cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it.  Next time, I will also use reduced sodium chicken broth, as I do not usually cook with a lot of salt.  Will definitely make this again!  I'm already getting requests for this chicken for next week!

This is good - not too heavy since there's no cream. I like the lemon butter sauce with the pasta.  No need for so much butter though! Also don't forget the salt!

I wasn't able to get this recipe to work out.   I admit I am not a great cook but I have been trying and finding lots of recipes on this great website to improve my cooking skills.  The chicken was too thick, even after I pounded it.   The sauce smelled good, however there was too much chicken broth, I think.  My sauce also didn't thicken even with adding a little extra cornstarch.  When I put it in the oven to finish cooking (the breasts were thick) I had to add a few minutes because they were still pink inside.  By being in the oven, the sauce turned very thin/oily and lost its consistently.  I would try this again with thin chicken breasts and just add the sauce to the pan for the final cooking.    I thought the sauce smelled great when I first put it together so I'll make another attempt at this and hope the second time is a charm.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I liked this recipe but I did a few things differently. I cooked it all on the stovetop and added garlic and thyme. I also adjusted used about 12 oz of chicken broth not 16. I added more cornstarch but it still wasn't as thick as I wanted. Anyway it did come out great after I changed it a bit to my taste. Definitley a keeper my husband loved it.

Oh yeah! This was so yummy. I didn't even bother with baking it, just did everything in a pan. I skipped the egg wash because I like my batter very thin so I just dredged the chicken breast in seasoned flour and browned it in veg oil. Took that out and kept warm, added butter, chicken broth, white wine(use a nice dry Pinot Grigio)and lemon juice and reduced for about 10 minutes. Careful with the salt, it intensifies as the sauce reduces so season at the end. Right before putting the chicken back in the pan I added some cornstarch dissolved in water and fresh chopped parsely. The sauce became like a glaze that stuck to the chicken. Came out soft and juicy from pounding the chicken before dredging in flour. Served with buttered egg noodles with parm cheese and sauteed green beans. Next time I might add a clove of minced garlic just to give it a kick. This is delicious..you must try it!!

This was really nice, a hit at my house.  I didn't use eggs when dredging the chicken in flour.  The sauce does need more cornstarch (mixed it with wine then added it in).  I used fresh lemon juice, which I think is essential; also added thyme; served it with quick brown rice and fresh green beans.  This made enough sauce for two meals.  The first one was with chicken, then I froze the rest and reheated it a few days later with fresh trout, white rice and baby peas.  A good idea from another reviewer is to try it with mushrooms which I'll do next time.  Thanks for the recipe--this is a keeper!

I added some thyme and extra wine to the sauce, used about a 1/3 cup bottled lemon juice, two boullion cubes with water instead of regular broth, flour instead of cornstarch and ignored the backward dredging 'cuz I thought it was a typo. It came out awesome and I don't think the baking after frying is really neccesary.  Served it with asparagus and wild rice. YUM, keeper!

I just made this for dinner.  I was looking for something easy and good and this was IT!.  I had all the ingredients and put it all together fast.  I did add some garlic powder like other reviewers did.  I also added an extra tsp of cornstarch to make it a bit thicker.  I made mashed potatoes as a side dish.  The sauce over the potatoes was awesome.
Thanks.

I give it 5 stars for flavor, but I changed the recipe a bit.  I used 4 eggs, but really only 2 were needed.  I had too much egg left over.  Threw them out.  I did not need the oven, as the chicken cooked though in the pan.  I used chicken bouillion as I had no chicken broth.

I thought the recipe was a bit confusing to read and follow.
I'll make again with my own "tweeks".

Quite enjoyed this recipe. Nice change with a light sauce for the chicken. Added some garlic salt to the chicken for flavor. Next time will probably reduce the amount of stock a bit. Did use an extra tsp. of cornstarch to thicken though. Overall a moist chicken result with a delicate sauce.

I didn't care for the taste of this chicken dish, although my husband liked it.  Amounts off - too much eggs and broth, and I never did get the sauce to thicken no matter how much cornstarch I used.  Chicken was moist though.

This was just OK. As others have said, the amounts seem to be off (too many eggs, too much broth, not enough cornstarch), and neither my husband or I liked the coating (he scraped every bit of it off). The chicken was moist and the sauce was good, but it's too much work for something that we didn't like that much, so I won't be making it again.

was ok but amounts are off. too many eggs, too much broth. must add cold water to cornstarch first to avoid lumps. also, up temperature to 350 and bake for longer. as written it's ok but will be much better next time when I make adjustments.

I made this X6 and got rave reviews. I was going to put in my 2 cents and read the reviews, up to Elaina's, first. I agree with everyone else, except those who didn't like it - needs less broth and wine, flour and egg (I could have used half for my quantity) and more cornstarch (in water), which by the way will not thicken unless it comes to a boil. I also would have salted the flour. thanks, Elaina!

Very, very good. I added sliced garlic and thickened it a bit more with extra cornstarch. It was a huge hit at my house... even with the kids.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I even mixed the cornstarch with water before I added it in like others suggested!  I added extra lemon juice too, but for some reason it didn't come out quite like I thought it would.  The sauce never thickened (I even tried adding more cornstarch but it didn't work) and there just wasn't enough lemon even though I doubled the amount.  I have no idea what happened.  I'm so disappointed because I love this dish in restaurants and was hoping I could make it at home.  :(

What did I do wrong??  I followed the directions exactly but the "sauce" comes out extremely watery and the dish is tasteless (this is coming from a person who likes bland food).  I'm very disappointed with the recipe and the reviews.

This was very good, I followed the reviews and added more lemon juice.  I also tried to thicken the sauce but was not successful...I didn't get any complaints, my father even liked it!

This was a good and easy recipe.  The only problem I had was that I could not thicken the sauce...I still haven't figured out what I did wrong but that stuff just wouldn't thicken up! It was still good though.

I personally did not care for the dish, but I think that is due to personal prefernces.  The three friends that ate with me enjoyed the dish.  I was unable to get the broth mixture to thicken.

This has to be one of my favorites.  I made quite
a mess making it plus I doubled it.  It was just 
great tasty and the sauce was out of this world.
I did add extra lemon, I love lemon.  The whole
family enjoyed it.

WOW~  is all i can say was this was so wonderful.  Everyone raved about this dish.  I used a bit more lemon and for presentation i sliced up thin slices of the leftover lemon and served it on the plate.  This was so terrific that i will be sure to serve this again and again.

This was pretty good but it didn't have as much flavor as I expected.  It was a little bit bland and needed to add extra flavoring.

I no longer buy this dish out when we go Italian.
It is such a sin to pay top $$$ for this dish knowing that I can now make it myself!
Thanks Elaina-

I hate to disagree with everyone, but I thought this recipe was disgusting, and my fiance had to choke it down because he was trying to make me feel better.  The whole dish is a pasty white, with no color variety.  The cornstarch clumped into gooey globs, and because I added a little more lemon juice (the other reviews told me to)it was like sucking on an actual gloppy lemon.  I recommend against this recipe for flavor, texture, and appearance.

not happy with the measurements, way to much eggs and flour they both can be cut in half, the sauce also is a over kill. THE cooking instructions also are sketchy. I coated my pan with oil before cooking cutlets, the cornstarch should be mixed with water before adding to hot liquid. Lots of waste but the end result was tasty.

I coated in flour, then egg then flour again, pan fried in oil until browned, then added lemon juice and chicken broth and simmered until done. Before serving I did add a pat of butter. I didn’t feel like adding wine because I personally prefer this dish without it and don’t think it’s needed. I then topped with fresh parsley, and served over fettuccine noodles. The directions as written do not make sense, this way is much easier prep.

Absolutely delicious!   Only made one change.  Used 2 eggs instead of 3.  I make this all the time.  My husband loves it and when we have people over for dinner, they love it too!  Thanks Elaina for the wonderful recipe!

The taste was excellent but I was disappointed with the “sauce.”  It was hardly a sauce at all. More like a broth.  I even doubled the corn starch to thicken it.

I have this recipe bookmarked on my phone. I made this recipe once a week all throughout my pregnancy, and I'm still making it now. I find that I only need to use one egg and about 2 Tbsp. flour. I never use any less lemon than is called for. The tanginess is great. I specifically use dry Sherry for the white wine. This is great over the microwavable orange colored package of brown rice/ quinoa blend with garlic flavor that you can find at most grocery stores and Costco these days. I also make creamed spinach on the side. The sauce of this recipe is very soupy, which I like, but it is best to leave the creamed spinach or whatever veggie side we have in a separate dish.

It was way too lemony.  So, next time I will use only one lemon.  I did use 3 tbsp cornstarch to thicken it better.  I think it would be great over rice.

VERY GOOD. WE LIKE A LOT OF LEMON SO I ALWAYS BY A BAG OF LEMONS. WE ADD ABOUT 6 LEMONS TO THE BROTH AND USE THE LEFT OVER LEMONS FOR SQUEEZING ON TOP OF YOUR PLATE. WE JUST LIKE IT LEMONY......ME AND MY GIRLS MAKE THIS TOGETHER. THEY LOVE IT, SO WE MAKE ALOT.

Definitely used my “Italian” style for cooking, which means I don’t quite measure everything exactly and go by taste, but I’m so excited how this turned out! it taste just like the Italian restaurant/pizza place are you still work at as a teenager where the owner was street from southern Italy!

Really liked this recipe. The only change I made was I sliced the lemon and left it in the sauce rather than just juicing it, in order to make it appear like the photo. The sauce really makes the chicken juicy

The basic recipe is OK,  but there is a major ingredient missing here from what I'm used to in NY. Some places here add white wine, and some don't, so wine is not important. But the 2 ingredients they all have in common, is plenty of lemon and either grated Parmesan or Romano cheese. The cheese is part of the dredging process. The lack of cheese in this recipe and a few others online left me puzzled, because here it is a big part of the dish's flavor and character.

The  chicken was tender and delicious, but the sauce was a bit too runny.  I have never added cornstarch in it's dry state directly to a sauce, always mix it with a little bit of water first.  Will try that next time to see if I can make this a little thicker.  Served it with rice pilaf.

Well, this certainly wasn't restaurant quality but then again I didn't use the best ingredients since I don't always have the best ingredients.  I did use lemon juice instead of fresh lemon and I think I added too much.   I've also never made it before but I am pretty good at following directions.   Something was just off on this, but I know it wasn't the actual recipe, it was me.   I also didn't bake it in the oven, I just added all the liquid ingredients to the pan I cooked the chicken in   I will def. make this again tho and use real lemons or a lot less lemon juice.  Maybe I'll just use lemon pepper seasoning instead.

This was pretty good, although I had to add about two tablespoons of cornstarch versus 1 tsp in order to get it to thicken.  I had never made this before, so I was a little confused by the flour THEN egg dredging, but it turned out okay.  Turned out very moist, not overly lemony...not bad, but heavy on fat between frying and the sauce.  Good for a change, but wouldn't make it frequently.

I sautéed about 1/2 pound of Mushrooms then added them at the end.  I am quite a good cook but have never attempted this recipe before.  I used skinless and boneless chicken thighs.  So moist and delicious. My wife had seconds and loved the lemon sauce.  A bit tip is to add cold water to cornstarch before adding to lemon and chicken stock.  This will prevent lumps in the sauce.   I rate this a 15 out of 10.  We will use this for our Easter dinner.

This recipe is great bc I always struggled with having enough sauce. Making the sauce separately means it didn't get all used up sautéing the chicken. Also love that doing it separately means I can make this ahead of time for entertaining and just combine and bake when my guests arrive. Bonus: use a gluten-free "flour" to make this dish gluten free!!

Most of the family liked it. I used 4 chicken breasts and cut them in half long ways. Still should have pounded them a little flatter. Should sauté on low heat to ensure chicken cooked through. Needed to add more cornstarch to thicken more. Ate with linguine. Should season the noodles a little in addition to the chicken and sauce.

This chicken came out "pretty good". I did pound the chicken breasts thin and made medallions/smaller pieces. Overall, I felt it tasted too "floury" (which could have been due to my larger number of smaller pieces), and too lemony. I had decided to try it because I was hoping it would be "easier" (faster?) than my "old" recipe for chicken francaise, but it ended up taking just as long but not coming out as good. The chicken was tender, the dish had a nice appearance, and the sauce did have a nice consistency. Overall, a decent recipe but I won't be making this version again.

Easy to prepare. Didn't have any corn starch to thicken the sauce, so I used flour instead, which did the trick just fine. My 3 sons and husband were impressed on aTuesday night. Really!

Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe! 
The only thing I did differently was to combine the cornstarch with a bit of broth (in a small Tupperware) and shake before adding to the pan. This ensures no clumps. This little trick can also be used with flour, which I substitute quite often for the cornstarch in this dish.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of adding a bit of garlic powder. The trick was using Meyer Lemons from Florida. They are highly flavorful and if you really like the taste of lemon, these lemons are wonderful and ultra juicy. I also took some of the heated sauce from the saucepan and placed in a plastic container and shook it with the cornstarch really well to avoid lumps before adding the cornstarch to the heated sauce. Everyone, including my husband, who is not an adventurous one with food, enjoyed this dish.

Everybody loved this recipe! I made a couple of changes: omitted wine but increased chic broth and added a little extra lemon.  Very easy, especially using thin cut chip breasts.  Recipe made lots of sauce and I thought we could freeze it for net time, but it was so yummy, nothing was left!  Thank you, Elaina!

Was very happy with the result, but I'm wondering, if the cornstarch is being neutralized by the lemon juice or wine, since it was close to water consistency. I added twice !
Will certainly  make it again, but next time, I'll just use regular flour  for a thickening agent.

I used 11/2 cups broth and 2/3 cup wine and about 1 tbsp of cornstarch and  the sauce is still thin and soupy . Next time I will not put as much broth. I used progreso bread crumbs and added garlic powder to the dry ingredients nd it made the chicken much tastier. The chicken  did not soak the flavor of the wine. So I'm thinking to use 1 cu of wine next time. Will try again for the third time.

This was the fist recipe I ever tried on allrecipes. And, it's another one that I make nearly weekly (Parmesan Pork Tenderloin is the other). This is a tried and true winner in my family. We were spending $$$$ at Italian restaurants on this dish and now we can enjoy it at home for a fraction of the cost! I've made it both with and without the wine. Both version were superb, I just added a bit more lemon juice to replace the missing moisture from the absence of the wine.

Good... I cooked the chicken fully on the stove then added the cooked sauce and let it cook in that for about 5 minutes.  I also used Champagne instead of white wine cause I had some left over.  Came out great.   I also added fresh garlic, because I'm Italian.

This was OK. I halved the chicken broth as I thought it was way too much, and added more cornstarch to thicken. I also seasoned the eggs.

i loved the process on the chicken! it left a very nice coating! i cut the chicken up into chunks. would have preferred serving the sauce on the side as the coating went soft in the baking process. the sauce although tasty was terribly thin. i also prefer a flour thickening. this was very tasty!

Instead of baking I made this dish all in one skillet pan. It was definitely tasty, but the sauce was a little runny as commented by others. The husband loved it so I will definitely make it again.

My husband and I both loved this dish. I used 2 tsp of cornstarch (mixed with cold water) to thicken and bottled lemon juice plus sea salt and plenty of ground black pepper in the flour and egg mixtures. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I loved the coating and the sauce was very lemony and delicious over rice. I'll add this one to my list of quick easy dinners!

Awesome! Served over angel hair pasta with grated parmesan cheese added and it was a real hit! Per other's suggestion, I added garlic salt and increased the corn starch to 1 TBP -- otherwise followed exactly and it is a real keeper!

i have to say, i've never had this dish in a restaurant, so it may just be a personal preference, but i didn't care for it all that much.  my husband thought it was just ok.  the chicken smelled like french toast from the eggs.  the sauce was pretty bland, even though i did double the amount of lemon juice.  not bad, but i won't be making it again.

The flavor of the recipe is very good, however I think I just need to work with it more to make it even better.  I added garlic powder to the sauce, and didn't have any white wine so I just substituted stock for the wine and put extra lemon juice in.   I also liberally seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder after they were finished sauteeing. The only problem I had was that there was a lot of sauce, and when you poured it over the chicken and baked it the coating fell off of the bottom half of the chicken.  It's not a creamy sauce, so I think next time I'll reserve half the sauce to put over steamed veggies (it was great with broccoli!)  The family liked it, and it's good to have a different chicken recipe to turn to when you're bored with the same old thing.  Thanks Elaina!

This is a great recipe for chicken french but after making it so many times you learn from experience. If you dont start with thin chicken breasts, you need to pound them so they cook swiftly. I always salt and pepper my chicken before battering and also sprinkle some into the flour mixture with garlic powder. I also used lemon juice instead of fresh squeeze which works just fine. Dont bother with the oven, if you have the thin chicken, stovetop should cook it throughly. Mix the cornstarch into cold water before adding to sauce mix so it doesnt clump. Pour sauce on top of chicken and serve!

Very good and easy.  Good moist chicken, however you need to add more starch or flour to thicken the sauce.

Made this for my mom for mother's day as she always orders it at restaurants.  It was watery but francese can be good either watery or creamy depending on your preference.  Needless to say, she had some at a restaurant the next day and said mine was much better!
