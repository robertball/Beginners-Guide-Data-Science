Made this for **RECIPE GROUP** and all I can say is WOW!  We loved it!  I went to two major grocery stores and neither had plum jam so I settled for seedless blackberry jam as another reviewer.  I used fresh pineapple along with red and orange bell pepper and I did add some mushrooms to my skewers.  I wanted to add onion, but I ran out of room on my 6” skewers (LOL!).  I made the full amount of sauce for just two servings and didn’t thicken it with cornstarch – mine seemed to have a nice consistency without it.  I divided the sauce into thirds – one part to marinate the chicken (I didn’t marinate the pineapple/veggies), one part to baste on while grilling, and one to drizzle on when plating.  I skewered the chicken separately to assure that it wouldn’t dry out.  Grilled these rather than broiling.  And served over hot cooked rice for a delicious dinner!  It was sweet, but that might have been due to the blackberry jam vs. plum, and my fresh pineapple was really sweet as well.  I remembered after I’d bought the blackberry jam, that I’ve seen plum sauce in the Asian foods isle and wondered if that would work?  We’ll be making this one again and I may try the plum sauce, but I also think any flavor of jam would work for this.

Wonderful recipe with tons of flavor.  I did use sherry and resorted to can pineapple rings (which didn't turn out pretty but tasted good).  I also misread the amount of cornstarch but it was thick and tasted great.  Another keeper!

These were so good.  I couldn't find plum jam but used beach plum jelly and I grilled the kabobs.

We finally had a warm and sunny spring day here in the Pacific Northwest, and it inspired me to cook something with a tropical twist for dinner.  These were perfect!  Here's how I improvised this recipe with what I had on hand.  Instead of plum jam, I used a cup of apricot jam and added a couple of tablespoons of apple jalapeno jelly for a slight hint of heat.  Also, in order to make more sauce, I added 3/4 cups of water and pineapple juice drippings to an additional teaspoon of cornstarch.  I served the kabobs over a bed of quinoa and had plenty of sauce to pour over all.  It was gobbled up quickly!

Made for Recipe Group. I used plum jam. $5 for 10 oz jar. Cost alone would prohibit me from making this in the future. While the kabobs held a hint of the sweetness from the jam, I can't say they were anything special. I did grill them instead of broiling, too labor intensive continually opening the oven to baste. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group:  11, June '11.  Oh my goodness are these WONDERFUL!  We grilled rather than broiled.  I could not find plum jam so I used plum sauce and added a little hoisin sauce.  I did not use the cornstarch.  I put the meat on skewers without the veggies/fruit as the meat needed to grill longer.  I basted the meat and fruit/veggies as they were grilling with some of the leftover marinade.  Served this dish over white sticky rice.  I did use fresh pineapple rather than canned.   DH and DS went wild over this dinner.  They think it is one of the best meals I've made from this site.    DS was so glad that there were leftovers for his lunch tomorrow.  I love making kabobs as you can really stretch a meal with all the additional fruits/veggies.  This MOST definitely will go in the summer rotation of meals.  Nancy thank you for your recipe and I'm glad RG chose it for this weeks recipe.

These were good. I think 20 oz of pineapple chunks is too many, personally, I'd put half in the marinade and save half for just-in-case next time. I used mixed berry preserves, because I had a jar open. I think I'd increase the soy and garlic a bit next time, but that's personal preference, the recipe is excellent just as written. Thanks for sharing your recipe! P.S. I did all my meat & veg on the same skewers because I don't mind the veg getting a little bit charred. If you cut your meat small, they cook at more or less the same time, too, which makes a pretty presentation (if you mind about that sort of thing!)

This was good! I did make a couple changes...I sauteed in a pan rather than broiling, and after the chicken was almost cooked I added the sauce, brought it up to a boil, and added the pineapple. I left out the green pepper due to personal preference. It was very good served over onion rice. Thanks for sharing!

I prepared this for AR recipe group week of 6/6/11.  This was a very good, super easy, weeknight grilling recipe.  I followed the recipe to a "t", just added a little more sherry to the marinade (love the stuff).  I marinated my chicken about 6 hours, and skewered with fresh pineapple and green belle pepper.  Served over jasmine rice.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I didn't use this as kabobs but instead just sauteed the chicken then served with the plum sauce over rice. I added some purple onion and 2 garlic cloves (rather then the garlic powder) which I sauted in butter before adding the Jam. I also added a some crushed red pepper for a litle kick.  it was fantastic! We'll be making it again.

These were a big hit. I, too, used seedless blackberry, as I could not find plum jam and the kabobs were delicious. For 4 people I increased the receipe to 6 servings and had only 1 serving left over, so if your crowd tends to eat big, you might want to kick up the serving count accordingly. I used my BBQ grill instead of the broiler (hey, I'm a guy!) - excellent!

Also, the recipe should be edited to include the number of skewers in the ingredients list. That way, the number of skewers would be scaled as the number of servings is changed. In the meantime, if you scale this recipe, remember to up the skewer count as well.

This makes good chicken. I selected this recipe to use up a jar of plum jam someone gave us at Christmas a couple of years ago. I put the chicken in the marinade Sunday evening thinking I would make the kabobs Monday night. Then our plans changed and the chicken marinated all week - until Friday evening. I thought the marinade might have overpowered the chicken after five days. Not so - the chicken was great. I served the kabobs on a bed of Near East Original Rice Pilaf. I would definitely make this again.

I think it's a little short on sauce if you're going to be putting it on rice, but other than that it is wonderful!
