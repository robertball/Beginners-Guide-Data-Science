I made this for a baby shower and put it on croissants.  It was very good!

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband and kids loved it.  I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and the pineapple juice, but followed the recipe besides that.  Thanks for a new family favorite!

This is pretty good.  I cut back on the salt and used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and 1/4 cup of light mayo.  I love the combination of sweet and crunchy but I prefer my favorite chicken salad recipe with almonds, celery, scallion, fresh chopped mango and mango chutney.
