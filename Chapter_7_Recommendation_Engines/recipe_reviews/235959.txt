Exactly what I wanted--a sweeter French Toast recipe. Loved it! Didn't even need syrup but delicious with it too

to halve the recipe use all the same ingredints and just use 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of sugar. works well with wholegrain toast. overall great snack.

Made just like the recipe.  Served with fruit and link sausage.  Next time I will try it without the syrup because I do not believe it would need it.
