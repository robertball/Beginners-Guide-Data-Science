I remember having Maizcena (correct spelling) when I was a kid at my grandmother's but I don't remember the taste or if I liked it. Having said that, I liked this pudding. It was easy to make and it came together a lot quicker than the specified times.

Easy and delicious! My family loves this recipe and I love that they get so much calcium from it. It does set very firm, but we like pudding like that (much better than not setting and being loose).
