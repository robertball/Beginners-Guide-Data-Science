Delicious fudge recipe and the first time I ever used cream cheese in a fudge. I was pleasantly surprised. The cookie dough were nice little gems to bite into - cause truly, I am not a fan of plain chocolate fudge. The fudge itself though has just the right amount of sweetness and doesn't taste like chocolate frosting (big plus.) I had no problem with the amount of flour to make the cookie dough. It turned out just fine. Good recipe, thanks for sharing.

Such a good and unique recipe.  If you like really rich chocolate I would suggest adding some cocoa powder and reducing the powdered sugar to 1.5 cups.  I also made a melted dark chocolate sauce to drizzle on the top, which improved the taste and the presentation!  Great recipe :)

Although this tasted delicious, I don't know that I would call it fudge. It kind of tasted like chocolate frosting. Like another reviewer, I also needed way more flour to make the cookie dough, at least a cup, maybe a little more. Turned out very yummy, just not very fudge like.

This recipe is rich but delicious. I did have to use a lot more flour than called for in the cookie dough in order to form it. Also, next time I make this I will grease the pan or use wax paper instead of aluminum foil because it was hard to separate from the fudge.

Decadent and delicious. After reading others comments I made slight mods to this recipe: added slightly less brown sugar and slightly more flour to cookie dough part & exchanged about half the semi-sweet chocolate chips for dark chocolate for the fudge part. It was really, really, really good. I will be making this every holiday from now on.

The fudge is way too gooey, and the recipe makes way too much cookie dough for the recipe. Taste was good, but will not make again.

Will need to alter it next time the fudge just wont set even after being in the freezer for more than 24 hrs. Kids still loved it though so taste wise its a win.

The 3 changes I would make in this recipe is to add butter instead of margarine.  In addition to semi sweet chocolate, add butterscotch candy chips and marshmallow cream
Maybe a small amount heavy cream.  Will have a rich creamy flavor and texture.
