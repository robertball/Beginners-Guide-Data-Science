Really good muffins! I was worried they'd taste of mostly banana (due to using 2 large ones) but it really is nicely balanced with the blueberries, bananas, and cinnamon. I used less sugar than called for (4 tbsps white sugar, and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar), used almond milk in place of lactose free milk, substituted 1 cup all purpose flour for 1 cup whole wheat flour, and only baked these for about 23 minutes at 375. I got 12 muffins and had a lot of batter left over, so I put it into a 9x5 loaf pan and made a really nice muffin bread (it baked for about 33 minutes) in addition to the regular muffins! Thanks for the recipe!
