We really liked this salsa..I liked the ease of not having to roast the tomatoes and peppers. I only had jalapenos and habinaros so that is what I used for the peppers. We like ours more finely chopped so I made it in the food processor. It was perfectly flavored.

Excellent!  Full of flavor!  Love that this recipe includes all fresh produce, most of which I already have on hand and can mix up quickly.  My husband took some of this to his work and his coworkers raved about it and couldn't believe it was homemade.  I like my salsas milder, so this one fit the bill.  We doubled the recipe and got 64 ounces (fitting nicely into four 16 oz. canning jars).  It is very limey...so make sure you like that flavor before using a whole lime.  Thanks for the tasty alternative to store bought!!

My husband liked it, but it wasn't exactly what he was looking for.

Was very easy to make but was missing the acidity of the tomatoes.  After removing all the seeds for both kinds of peppers I found it not a mild salsa.  I had to add a can of tomato sauce to help with the acidity it was missing and I also used a food processor since I like my salsa pureed more.  If I make this again I will cut down on the serrano peppers and add a can of roasted tomatoes.
