Hey Jejpu, what a backdoor way to to belittle someone's receipe. If you don't like it don't read it,
make it, or heaven forbid EAT it. Here is a receipe for you. 1 cup courtesy, and a generous portion of
nice! Next time save your review for something you approve of. I feel sorry for your kids if you have any!  Ouch!  I respect the 3 stars you rated this receipe, just not the comments. Have a great day.

This is a fun, kid friendly salad! when I make it I add 8 ounces of softened cream cheese to pudding & cool whip mixture. Some times we use pistachio pudding. Thanks for sharing~

I loved this recipe and changed it up a little to cut some of the calories out.  I switched to sugar-free pudding and a lite whipped topping.  I'm not a banana fan so I omitted that.  My husband "SNARFED" it down and wanted more.  Great recipe!  And to Jejpu...shame on you...make your reviews constructive.  There's enough nastiness in the world today.

I like to substitute sliced carrots and tomatoes for the candy bars.  I also substitute low-fat salad dressing for the pudding and green leaf lettuce for the whipped topping.

This is not something I would make on a regular basis, so serve a small portion and enjoy! The recipe has bananas and apples and candy - yummy.

I think jegpu was just being sarcastic because it's not a healthy dish.  It's fun for a special occasion, although it does sound more like a dessert than a salad.

The grandchildren thought this was wonderful and the adults were happy too! A nice change from traditional salads, especially for a special occasion.

When I give tea parties, I love to make several items and give small tastes. I chose to make this recipe as one of my desserts. It was deliciously different.

Made this with my daughter to welcome October and everything yummy fall brings! We substituted the pudding with one package of softened cream cheese and a cup of powdered sugar, and used an extra green apple since we didn't have bananas. Needless to say it was a huge hit!
