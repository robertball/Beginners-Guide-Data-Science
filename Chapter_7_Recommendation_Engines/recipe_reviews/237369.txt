Update:  My paleo friend didn't care for these, either. Well, it is what it says - not sweet.  They are cute. I made the recipe with unsweetened coconut flakes and almond butter.  Since these are little tasty bite snacks, I was wanting something a little sweeter.  So, I added 1 scoop (4 Tbsp.) of chocolate whey isolate powder.  Still needed more sweetening.  So I added 1 tsp agave syrup.  It's easy and fun and with your own personal tweaks is a useful, healthy recipe. It just wasn't satisfying my sweet tooth.
