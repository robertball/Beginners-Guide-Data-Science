My family has been eating this for years! We hadn't used beef or the boulion before though. It makes a great dish even better. My grandaddy was in Korea in communications on the line and had this on leaves. He liked it so much that we started having it at home once a week. He use to say it was the only good thing about the war! Thanks for making this favorite even better!

What really sets this one apart is the maple flavored sausage. Don't recall the line cooks in the service having that lol but I could be wrong. Add some cracked black pepper and salt to your taste. The extra lean beef means that there is less shrinkage yet I used 1 1/4 or so of 80/20 and did not drain it. Yum

My hubby still raves about the SOS he had while in the military so I had to try this one just for him. I did not have maple flavored sausage so I used regular breakfast sausage and it worked out great. (My husband did not think that the military used a flavored sausage either) Simple and a real stick to your ribs kind of meal. Thanks for sharing.

It is a good easy SOS recipe. I cooked some onions in pan first. I used regular sasuage. It taste so good that I hesitate to order it it when I go out. I ate this for 23 years and it still taste good. I went to a retiree breakfast once where they had 13 different crockpots full of their favorite SOS.

My wife had never tried S.O.S. which I thought was a shame. I made this one for her and it turned out much better than the stuff I'd eaten as a kid. It's obviously not a gourmet dish but it's tasty and it makes a lot.

I did have to kick it up a notch but a great basic recipe. I did add a little Worchester sauce and some beef base plus salt and pepper. Nice easy meal.
