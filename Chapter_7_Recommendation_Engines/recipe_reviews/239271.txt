It was really tasty! It was great bread that reminded me of fall. I could only handle a couple of slices though, because it was so sugary. Would recommend.

This was very well liked at a potluck today.  The pumpkin gives it a nice color and it's a moist bread full of flavor.   I was asked for the recipe 3 times, so it was def a hit.  
Why four stars instead of five?  I thought there was too much chocolate, but I think I was in the minority on this opinion.

It was pretty gooey. More like a thick brownie. My family liked it but it was not what I had hoped.

very good and moist bread. I cut both sugars in half, and in the future I will have the number of chocolate chips it was little too much chocolate for me. But very delicious. I'm just not a big sweet eater. It very moist and and just easy to put together and cook. has a very good flavor.

Awesome bread. Surprised my kids with it last night and they loved it. Got enough to make it again next weekend to share with neighbors and family. Love it!

Great, easy recipe. I didn't have self rising flour so a quick search online gave me the measurements of how much salt and baking powder to add. Love the amount of chocolate chips!! I will be making this again.

Delicious, I will definitely make it again. I used Fiori di Sicilia instead of vanilla, which gave it a hint of orange flavor.

This was so easy to throw together, and delicious too! The only change I made was to make (3) 7" x 3" loaves and baked them for exactly 45 minutes. So good, slathered with a bit of butter and eaten while still warm. These are not going to last long in our house.
