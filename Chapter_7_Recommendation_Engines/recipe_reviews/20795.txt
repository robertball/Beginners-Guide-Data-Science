A delicious and moist cake. I added in half a cup of toasted pecans, a can of canned apricots, and tablespoon of almond extract. The almond taste was a little overpowering; I would reduce it to one or two tsp next time. I'm giving the cake four stars because the icing didn't work at all for me. The melted butter separated from the water and liqueur (I didn't have apricot brandy so I used apricot liqueur) and turned into a disgusting curdled slop. I finally had to throw it out and start over. I mixed powdered sugar with orange and almond extracts and added in milk until it was the right consistency.

This cake was really moist and yummy. I used a reduced sugar yellow cake mixed, but it was still sweet.

Made it exactly per recipe. Didn't taste the apricot at all. We still devoured it. Nice texture - not too dense.
