I made this today with veggie pot pie and it was wonderful!  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time because this was very yummy) I would maybe add a touch of herbs like basil or parsley (dried) to the dough and maybe some finely shreeded cheese (this works out great if you haven't tried it, add about 1 cup and mix as usual) If you try this recipe you won't be dissapointed!  Thanks!

All I tasted was shortening when I ate this.  I plan to try "healthy pie crust" and "healthier pie crust" from allrecipes.

Does the job when in a pinch, but it rolls out much better if allowed to rest.

This recipe is very easy to prepare.  I used 7 tablespoons of water and the dough was easy to roll out.  This is an excellent, plain, flaky crust for pot pies but for fruit pies I would use my favorite French Pastry Pie Crust from this site.

Light, flaky goodness.  Easy to throw together and goes well with every type of pot pie I've made; veggie, beef or chicken.  A huge hit. Thanks!

I've used this same recipe for forty years, as did my mother (who would be in her nineties now), and it's excellent. (Do let it rest for 30 minutes before use, however.) However, we used this for two crusts--maybe if you're making thick crusts you'd have to double, or for a 10-inch, but one crust? Not in my experience and we have decades of experience with it.

If all you taste is shortening, or you wind up with a gooey mess, or a leathery crust you did something wrong--it's not the recipe. Measuring ingredients accurately is important, as is chilling the water, properly incorporating the shortening into the flour until crumbly, and then mixing enough to moisten and gather together--don't stir like a cake or cookie batter. Use a fork.

And, you can safely add a couple tablespoons of sugar for a fruit pie without compromising the integrity of this recipe.

I didn't have the "correct" ingredients on hand. I followed the measurements but used self-rising flour and butter and just omitted the salt. The crust was so wonderful and I think would make an excellent biscuit recipe as well. As mentioned in previous reviews, letting the dough set does make for easier rolling.

i made this recipe last night, and it turned out very well. next time, i would probably bake it for less time before filling it, because it got a bit tough.  i would also have pricked the bottom crust with a fork before baking it, because it puffed up in a few places when i baked it. otherwise, it was delicious.

In all the years I've baked & cooked this was the first time I've made a pie crust, and now I'm wondering what I was so afraid of! This was so easy to make, and the result was a very delicious & flaky crust. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion & added some shredded cheese & dried parsley. I used it for a turkey pot pie and it was perfect! The only thing is the dough was a little bit sticky, but I just rolled it between wax paper and it was fine. Also I used a 9' pie plate and it was barely enough, but I made it work. Next time I think I will increase the recipe by half.

Really flaky and good!! I might have used too much flour to roll it out. I also didn't get enough dough to fit the 11X7 dish, but it still did the job. Next time I will use more flour and some spices to jazz it up.

I really liked this crust.  I think shortening makes much better crusts than butter.  I made it using about a pound of leftover pot roast with the potatoes and carrots in a 9x9 pan.  I also brushed a mix of egg and water on the top for a golden crust.  My husband loved it and said I could make this whenever I want.  I will definitely use this crust in the future.

Easy, simple.  Came out flaky, just like I wanted.  I did prick the bottom with a fork and throw it in the oven for 5 min (425) by itself before loading with pot pie.  I can't say how much it helped, but the bottom wasn't the least bit soggy.  (Once I filled it, I brought the heat down to 400 and cooked for 30 min with foil on the edges, 30 min without).  THANKS!  I will use this instead of buying for sure.
EDIT: I've used this a second time, prebaking the bottom, and then just putting the top on without foil for 30 min, watching until it browned up.  Fantastic!

This was a good tasting crust but went through a few batches before I decided to add more water. It was coming out to dry and was unworkable. At least needs a tablespoon or two more.

A wonderful pie crust! I have used this with both butter and shortening and it turned out great both times. A truly wonderful addition to any pot pie! I'll never buy a crust again.

Perfect pie crust! Easy to make and very delicious. I would make 1.5x the recipe for the veggie pot pie. That way the crust can be a little thicker.

I had a specific taste in mind that I hoped this recipe would mimic when I used this crust in my chicken potpie recipe. I was hoping this recipe would produce that taste and it did!  I am not a fan of pre-packaged pie crusts and can't stand them in fruity pies so I didn't want to try one in my potpie like most of the recipes on this site call for.  I am SO happy I took the time to make this crust.  It is the BEST!  Instead of shortening, I did use the Smart Balance "butter" sticks I had on hand (2/3 cup as called for).  This was SO delicious!!

I am shocked at how easy this recipe is and how amazing the resulting crust taste.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and coconut oil in place of the white flour and shortening.  I also let the dough rest a while in the fridge.  I used half of the dough to top a veggie pot pie and the other half to top a peach pie.  It was so easy to roll out and handle!  Great recipe.  Definitly a keeper!

This is a great recipe - WONDERFUL with the Veggie Pot Pie recipe.  I used whole wheat pastry flour rather than white flour and it turned out great.  I omitted the bottom crust when I made the Veggie Pot Pie - just made a thick top crust.  It was easier and we didn't miss the bottom crust at all.  GREAT RECIPE!!

This is a fine crust recipe.  I made it with the veggie pot pie recipe on this site.  The recipe is a little small though, I had to make a little bit more to make a whole crust.

I increased this recipe from 8 to 12 servings and used it for my ex-large (9 X 13") chicken pot pie. To make it fit right, divide the dough 2/3 X 1/3, and roll it out thin. It bakes up light and flaky, and is just all-around perfect in thickness, texture and taste. It's way better than store bought, and it only takes an extra 5 minutes. It really makes your pot pie exceptional.

I thought this was easy in everyday. I used this recipe to make pie crust strips for a soup. I made a few changes but I think it would be good the original way. Here is what I did...1 C whole wheat flour. 1 C White, 2/3 C butter, 7T water, 1T white vinegar, mixed in my stand mixer, rolled out, cut into 4 inch by 1/2 inch strips (approx), sprinkled w/salt, baked at 450 
 Degrees 6 to 8 mins.

This is the second time trying for me and I must say, it worked like magic! I used less than 2/3 cup of canola oil instead of shortening. Perfect! The crust was beautiful!

I have made this recipe twice now.  The second attempt is baking as I type.  All I remembered from the first time is how well this crust went with the Portobello Pot Pie (John Dailey) it surrounded.  This time, I am reminded how easy this crust is to roll out and fit in my dish (rectangular and glass) without stretching oddly or tearing!  Thank you, PATTECAKE!
12.11.14: Used butter instead of shortening, forgot to set butter out to soften first, and used too much water by mistake.  AND IT WAS STILL GREAT!  I think I even prefer the flavor with butter.

I don't have a pastry blender (a tool with wires or vertical strips of metal arranged in parallel and attached to a handle, which forms the straight portion of its "D" shape; PATTECAKE is not referring to an electronic device), so I used a potato masher.  It was not a problem.

Easy as pie! ;)

I use this recipe all the time for my pot pies, be they veggie, chicken or beef. Sometimes I substitute butter for shortening, as it has more flavour that way.

My individual chicken pot pies came out great using this pie crust recipe.  I did line my glass pyrex bowls with part of the crust and baked them for 15  minutes at 400 degrees before I added the filling and the top crust.  Then baked for another 40 minutes at 400 degrees.

This is a GREAT recipe! It worked so well. I made it to the letter the first time, but we like more crust on our pot pies. The second time, I added 1/2 to everything, but instead of 1/3 more shortening, I used butter. The crust was flakey and tasted GREAT. I brushed the crust with cream the second time around and it browned nicely also. A keeper!

Very good! Tastes like it should and has the texture as it should!  Made exactly as is.  The only downfall is that I had to take out the mixer which is a chore..then clean it just to make this one crust...would prefer to do by hand...less to clean and less hassle.

I made personal pot pie pastries. I made circles with an upsidedown bowl and rolled the meat and rice like a tortilla wrap. This dough was perfect. It came out a little dry so next time I will make a salt water and butter glaze for the top and add gravy to the inside. The dough however kept its shape and tasted great! Thank you!

I made chicken pot pie IX and usually use a frozen crust but was halfway through preparing it when I realized I didn't have one in the freezer after all.  I used this as a substitute and will not be buying them frozen for pot pie any more...it made all the difference.  I rolled it into a bottom crust and used a pizza cutter to make strips to weave across the top.

My sister in law called to see if I had a recipe for crust. She was making chicken pot pie for her mom and dad, but store bought biscuits for the crust. I have never made my own crust before. I made enough for 2 pies, and they were awesome. Very simple to make, and no mess. I rolled it out on wax paper with no effort at all, and it took very little time. The crust was very flaky and light. Definatly a keeper. And now, thanks to this recipe I will be the designated pie crust maker in the family. But, at least I get a pie or 2 out of the deal.

This crust tasted wonderful with my vegetable chicken pot pie. I made them in individual sized pot pie pies (foil containers) and cooked them for the time allowed. And froze them. All we have to do is reheat them in the oven. The crust is very tasty. Thanks much pam

It had a good flavor, but it was difficult to keep from falling apart.  The bottom crust also got a bit soggy.  Bottom line: I've had better.

This is the first pie crust I've made and it turned out really well - loved the taste and texture.  I did find it hard to move the pastry once I'd rolled it out - it kept falling apart, but it did stick back to itself OK by rolling it again - it just took a few goes to get it right.  But from what I've seen from reading other reviews of pie pastry this is a common problem.

This crust was perfect with the Chicken Pot Pie recipe. Could test out some savory spices with it, add garlic powder, onion powder, and dill.

Very good. Kids loved it. I refrigerated before rolling while I made my pot pie filling. Rolled out perfectly; easier than the one I had been making before. Will be using this one again!

This turned out to be a great crust for my vegetable pot pie. As another reviewer suggested, I added some dry oregano, but I imagine it would taste good just as is, and interesting to experiment with other herbs/seasonings. I also used Spectrum vegan organic shortening, which had a nice texture when mixing with the flour. I haven't had a pot-pie for at least 20 yrs (haven't eaten meat since then). Periodically, I check the Swanson Pot Pies at the grocery store, hoping they came up with a veggie pie (Amy's Vegan Pot Pies are too expensive for my liking), so I'm really excited to have found this great crust that's almost just how I remember it, but much healthier! Only part I miss is the skin-like dough along the bottom and sides, whereas this one is more crusty and browned. But I can't deduct stars for that; afterall, this is a Crust recipe! Next time, I'll try baking it for less time.

I made this for a chicken pot pie, and the crust was PERFECT.  Crispy on the top side, soft where it touches the filling.  Scrumpcious.

This was great. I used it as crust for pot pie and my guy RAVED about how buttery and flakey it was. A few days later after inhaling his leftovers he was still in the mood for pot pie and purchased a Trader Joe's version. "No comparison. Remind me that your version is the best," was the response. Kudos for making me look good!

This is a quick and easy pie crust that results in a very flaky crust.  While my husband enjoyed the flavor, I was sensitive to the shortening taste.  I prefer the taste of a butter crust, but it's difficult to give up the flakiness that shortening imparts.  I will be looking for a recipe that incorporates both ingredients but will keep this one in mind.  It worked well with my chicken pot pie and that shortening taste is my own personal pickiness and has nothing to do with the quality of this recipe.

I never made a crust before this crust. I was making the crust for a turkey pot pie to make use of all of the extra turkey that we had from Christmas. This was so much easier than I ever imagined. The ingredients were something that I would always have on hand. Thanks for the great recipe! This one is a keeper!

I made this for leftover Thanksgiving turkey potatoes pie. I used whole wheat flower and added lemon pepper seasoning. It’s an easy, quick go to recipe I’ll use in the future. It is a very basic pie crust but can be flavored.

I followed the recipe exactly and used it for a vegetable pot pie, it was delicious! Light and flaky and complimented the filling, will definitely use again.  I ended up needing all 8 tablespoons of water but I’m sure that can vary based on location, altitude, etc.

I used lard instead of shortening.  Lard is, supposedly, the queen of fats for pie crusts.  I googled a conversion chart so I could convert 2/3 cup of lard to weight in ounces, since I had a 1 lb block of lard and didn't want to go mashing  it into a measuring cup.  2/3 cups of lard, or butter, or shortening for that matter, converts to 4.82 ounces, which is easy to weigh out using a small scale like a Weight Watchers scale or a Post Office scale.  Anyway, that was the only change I made.  The crust was flaky, but kind of tough, maybe because I over handled the dough before rolling it out, or maybe because I used too much flour on the counter to roll it out, or maybe because I rolled it out too thick.  I will attribute the slight toughness to operator error.  I will use this recipe again.

I made this crust to top the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe from this site. It was a nice flaky crust, Everything you would want in a savory dish. Thank you for a great recipe!

My boyfriend and I decided to make our own chicken pot pies tonight ... We tried this recipe and it came out PERFECT! We were a bit thrown off due to the measurements/servings since we had two small ceramic dishes for the pies but the 8 servings portion actually worked well. The crust was flaky, thick and just so so good!

I found I didn't have enough shortening so I used half butter . I also added some pepper, salt and rosemary. Just my preference. Need to make sure you refrigerate dough before rolling out. Great base recipe. Came out flaky and flavorful!

Used this recipe for a vegan "chicken" pot pie and it was delicious! I used organic cake/pie flour and Earth Balance vegan shortening.

This pie crust tasted very good! I used butter instead of shortening, and it came out just fine. My only complaint is the black spots on the crust. 

Thank you for sharing this recipe! God bless!

It was very flaky and went good with turkey pot pie recipe.  I needed to add one more cup of flour to the recipe because it was to sticky to work with but it turned out all right in the end.

Never would have believed I could make a crust like that.  It was so good.  I think I am going to use it for more than just potpies.  I think it would be good for chocolate pies too.  No changes, I loved it.

I used this for turkey pot pie from this site and both recipes turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for making my life easier.  I was wondering which of the 43 pie crust recipes I was going to use until I found this one.  Absolutely perfect in every way.
