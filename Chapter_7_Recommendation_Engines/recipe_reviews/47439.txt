I have no need to eat restaurant curry ever again as this recipe is fantastic IF you make some modifications! Before starting to cook, I marinated the cut chicken in a mixture of plain yogurt, tumeric, and pepper to give the chicken a great flavor and prevention against drying out. Once you start the actual dish, add extra onion and a lot of extra garlic (I used 6 cloves) and saute taking care not to burn the garlic.  I added a bit more canned tomato than the recipe called for and supplemented with fresh chopped plum tomatoes.  Add more curry than the recipe suggests - perhaps 1 Tbsp or more to suit your taste.  I was a bit heavy-handed on the salt and it was perfect.  The end result will be too bland if you're not.  Tasting as you go is your best bet.  Prior to adding the coconut I was sure to add a healthy dash of cayenne pepper to give the recipe a kick.  I only added 1/2 of the can of coconut milk as any more would have made the dish too soupy.  During this stage I also added about 1 Tbsp of light brown sugar and juiced only 1/2 of a large lemon.  

This dish will amaze YOU as well as your friends and family if modified to your liking. Don't be shy with experimenting with flavors.  The next modification will be to add vegetables to the saute.

I thought this tasted really good. It was very silky and creamy. It was not very spicy, which I thought was perfect, but if you like hot curry, you would need to add heat. Since there has been so much discussion on the curry, I looked up a traditional recipe for African curry and used that. Here is the African Curry powder recipe:
    1 tablespoon ground cumin 
    1 tablespoon ground coriander 
    1 tablespoon ground turmeric 
    1½ teaspoons ground ginger 
    1½ teaspoons ground allspice 
    1½ teaspoons garlic powder 
    ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper 
    ½ teaspoon chili powder

This is a very good basic recipe, but I felt it lacked something, so I experimented a bit with it. Finally, I discovered that adding about tablespoon of brown sugar drastically improves the taste and helps balance the taste of coconut milk with tartness of tomatoes and curry.

this was beyond delicious, but that could be bacause I am a beyond amazing cook.. hmm... :j My family says this tasted like something out of a resturant and they beg me to make it again and again! I did make some changes though which I will reveal in order to make your dish of curry as good as mine. Let's see.. first make sure you use bonless chicken cause it is a b***h pulling the bones out of that sucker. On to the next step.. I used garlic flavored olive oil instead of regular, but that isn't nescesary at all. My next change was to make absolutely certain the tomatoes were as drained as possible, and to dice them as well. Next, I used probably a total of 2 or more tablespoons of curry powder, most of which I added during the coconut milk stage. Just be sure to tast it frequently and add the curry powder to meet your own personal preference. Next, I added around 
1-2tbsp of dark brown sugar and about a tsp of new mexico chili powder, THIS STEP IS A MUST!!!! Next, I added only about 3/4 can of coconut milk which I thought was perfect, but I was told the whole can could of been used. Again, it depends on personal preference so taste frequently. Last, I ended up only using about 1/2 the amount of lemon juice, which everyone thought was lemony enough. Last last, be sure to serve over rice, it's delicious that way! I hope I could help!

I think the problem people had with this recipe turning out bland may have been due to the curry they used.  I tried a 'regular' curry from a grocery store and got bland results.  I bought curry from an Indian foods store and it is much stronger.  (I've been told that there are many different varieties of curry.)  I'll make this recipe with the Indian curry next time.  Oh, and I used lowfat coconut milk and it tasted great!

growing up eating curry and rice dishes, I find this recipe to be a good basic sauce that you can add ingredients. I personally love curry and made this recipe for my dinner guests,adding 1/8 tsp cumin,1/2 c sliced carrots, 1/2 c sliced green bell peppers, 1/2 c sliced mushrooms, and 1/2 c shrimp. saute the veggies until slightly tender add shrimp cook till pink tender.course you may want to add more coconut milk and a bit more curry depending on your taste and consistency of the sauce.Serve over rice. Over-all this is a great recipe for anyone to try! I myself tend to want veggies in my sauce. hmmm wonder how this sauce would be over asparaguss omitting the tomatoes of course! Job well done..Vickie! My guests loved the dish!

I served this dish last night at a dinner party for some friends who are foodies. They LOVED it and one asked for the recipe to take back to France with her! I read through the suggestions and added some brown sugar and doubled the curry. I think the chicken tastes much better if marinated a short while ahead of time. I mixed some plain yoghurt with turmeric in a bowl and then put the chicken in (whole), covered it and stuck it in the fridge. Then I started chopping the onion and getting out the other ingredients. It can marinate anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. While the onion cooks I take out the chicken and cube it. It tastes especially tender and delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again!

A real hit, whether I use chicken or shellfish.  Be sure to use regular coconut milk, not light milk, as the dish relies on the creaminess to counter the curry's fire. Also, if you have a variety of curries available, use one containing tumeric, cumin, and coriander instead of one emphasizing spices like cinnamon and cardamon.  And use the curry generously!  My guests tend to add curry to this dish if I've followed the recipe exactly.

My favorite recipe to date. This is saying a lot because I usually fix a gourmet meal each night. I could not get enough of this curry dish. I used 5 garlic cloves instead of 2. I also used 2 tbsp of curry and a dash of chili powder. This made the curry a little spicy but not too hot. I also used 2 fresh tomatoes and a large can of the peeled tomoatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was delicious. Serve over rice. Double the recipe if you want to have leftovers. It serves about 4 people.

Most incredibly delicious! I would, however, recommend using Curry paste from an ethnic foods store (Indian curry is nice) rather than that flavorless powdered stuff you buy at the local grocery store.  And be generous with it.  :)

Another keeper and I used some reviewers suggestions by doubling the curry powder (and I use Madras curry powder which is strong) and added the brown sugar as another reviewer suggested.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into mouth sized chunks and used two cans of diced tomaotes and an extra onion, can of mushrooms, and frozen peas at the end which gave it a lot of sauce.  I was making the serving for 4 for just 2 of us hoping there would be enough left over for a quick mid-week leftover meal. There was, and it was even better left over.  I'm going to indicate in my notes that this is a great dish to prepare a day or two ahead!

I agree with the people who said this turned out great because they are great cooks. You do need to customize the recipe to your taste.

I used about 2 teaspoons from a jar of minced garlic. After sauteing the onion & garlic until the onion was tender, I added the tomato and sauteed garlic, onion, tomato together for about 10 minutes on low.  I used the canned whole peeled tomatoes, but I diced them myself. Instead of throwing out the juice, I reserved it. While cooking the chicken I slowly added the reserved tomato juice and reduced it.

My grocery store only had sweetened coconut milk. If you can only get the sweetened coconut milk, don't add a whole can. Add a little, stir, simmer, and taste. I added about 1/3 of the can and it was perfect.

I wanted my chicken to be fall apart tender, so I cooked it on low heat.  I used about 1lb of chicken. After I added the coconut milk, I added about a pound of cooked shrimp, 3 more diced peeled tomatoes (I used 1 14.5 ounce can, plus 3 out of another can), 1 tablespoon of butter, then covered and simmered for about an hour.

I was very heavy handed with the garlic salt and the curry. I used hot vindaloo curry paste and some tumeric based curry powder.  I also added some cayenne (we love spicy food).

The butter added some richness to the sauce, and the extra tomato juice helped give me a nice rich sauce as well.  If I had not only been able to get sweetened coconut milk I may not have needed the butter or the extra tomatoes.

This is great! I'm eating it as I write! I did make quite a few changes though: I sauteed the onion, garlic (I used five cloves), and bay leaf (I only had crushed bay leaves in a shaker so I used 1/2 tsp.) in chicken broth instead of oil to cut down on the fat. Along with it I also chopped up an individual size snack pack (65g.) of mini carrots. I used 3 tsp. green curry paste instead of the powder (next time I'll use more), I only had diced tomatoes on hand so I used those,  I threw in a dash of red pepper flakes and a tablesppon of brown sugar along with the coconut and a few squirts of bottled lemon juice. I'm happy with the results!

This dish is absolutely fabulous!  The second time I made it I used half a can of "Lite" coconut milk to cut a few calories and it was still delicious.  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones, and I used a little more curry than called for.  Huge hit with the entire family!

Holy smoke.  This is some amazing curry that is SUPER simple to make!  My family (and I) went nuts for this when I made it!
It really IS comparable to a restaurant dish.  
I used chicken breast but other than that made this exactly as directed... And I will be making this dish again!  Thanks for an excellent recipe Valleriekooka!

I decided to try this recipe because my sister in law  who is from Nigeria made something similar a few weeks ago but she had no real exact measurements to tell she just goes by taste... so i used this recipe as a guide and we made  the following alterations used 10 drum sticks less the skin used 2 cans of coconut milk added 2 small potatoes and 2 medium carrots we used 2 medium onions, one fresh tomato, one bell pepper and 4 cloves of garlic we also added at least 1.5 table spoons of hot curry powder and some ground cayenne pepper also a knorr cube...
it came out awesome and very flavorful

I've made this twice once with shrimp and with the chicken i thought it was very good, i enjoy the curry and coconut milk flavors. The only negative comment i have is boiling a whole chicken then deboneing it next time i'll use chicken breast i couldn't see how going to that much work improved the wonderful flavor of this receipe

As written I found it to be too bland.  I also do not understand the need to take 10 minutes to pour in a can of coconut milk.  After I added curry paste and salt and we enjoyed it more.

Excellent template curry dish.  You will probably have to make it a few times to get the right flavor and spiciness for you but when you find the perfect mix, you will keep coming back for more.  I have made a few adjustments that I would like to share.  First, I cooked the chicken separately and set aside for adding later.  Also, I personally like vegetables in my curry dishes so I added a halved then sliced small zucchini and a halved then sliced green pepper (will add more next time.)  I am a tomato lover and added a 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes instead of the 14.5 oz can.  I also went nuts with the garlic and curry.  6 cloves of garlic and 2+ tsps of spicy curry powder and 1+ tblsps of red curry paste.  To top it off, I added a generous amount of crushed habenero flakes.  Most will not tolerate this but I do recommend adding some sort of heat to this dish.  I also added a tbsp of cornstarch to the coconut milk to thicken it up.  In the end, an excellent restaurant style curry dish.

This is a great 'base' curry recipe! Based on other reviews, I added potatoes as the onions and garlic sauteed. I increased the curry powder to 2T, added extra garlic, a dash of paprika, a sprinkling of cayenne and chili powder. I used 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken. The last change I made was chopping a fresh tomato and adding it in toward the end. It turned out spicy (made my eyelids sweat) and pretty much delicious. Next time I'll try adding some carrots as well. Yummy.

great recipe, I tried this one becasue it didn't use any strange ingredients, I had everything in my pantry already. I added tons more curry, but I understand the regular grocery store variety is not the best to use. It tasted great! I only used half the coconut milk, becasue it got really soupy, not sure if that was my mistake or not.

Really easy to make and I was really impressed with how it turned out.  I had less chicken (just some chicken breast I had in the freezer) so it would have been better with more but the curry itself is nice.  A bit heavy on the lemon so I might add some sugar before eating the other half I have left.  I will certainly use this recipe again, possibly adding more curry and garlic and maybe adding some ginger.  I loved the coconut flavour, and the creaminess.  I may even get the larger can of coconut cream next time.  Another thing I might try is adding some chili or dicing the tomatoes before cooking.

I served this curry with naan bread and will have the leftover with rice.

The flavours were really delicious and blended nicely, but it tended to be too rich to eat as a main dish.

Very good.
I did saute bell pepper with the onion.  Also I used chicken bullion and about 1/3 c. water instead of salt (this also made it a little less coconut-y).  I added some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick and served it over rice.  Very tasty.  Thanks!

My family is very diverse in its likes and dislikes but they all loved this curry including a visitor we had with us that evening from Africa.  I made this dish again and doubled the amount of curry powder and garlic, added some sliced almonds on top, and served in bowls over rice.  My son was late to the table and his friends ate it all before he could sit down - some friends!  Thanks for the quick and easy curry fix.

Wow, good base recipe. This was delicious and I'll be making it regularly, but I made many changes for the sake of adding flavor and a bit of heat:   I used much more curry, only a half can of coconut milk, a teaspoon brown sugar, no bay leaf, a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid, much more salt (coarse salt), pepper, cayenne, pepper flakes, and sliced boneless-skinless chicken thighs- the dark meat has more flavor and stays more tender (plus it's cheaper).  I sauteed the onion about 5 minutes, added the chicken (which I seasoned), then the garlic after about 5 minutes. Once the chicken was cooked, I added the tomatoes and rest of the spices and brown sugar. Then, I let that simmer for 5 minutes, slowly added half a can of unsweetened coconut milk, let it come to a simmer, then served over brown rice.  This was the first time I made curry, but I'm no cooking novice so I knew better than to follow the recipe verbatim- you can tell it would turn out bland that way.

I marinated chicken breasts in plain yogurt and tumeric. , and added extra garlic, curry, and some hot chilis.  1/2 a lemon was enough.  The result was SO SO GOOD!

This was really good, but maybe a bit heavy on the lemon, and there's not nearly enough curry. I made this with a pound of shrimp, basmati rice, and diced (not whole) tomatoes. I omitted the bay leaf because I did not have one. I upped the garlic to 4 cloves and upped the curry to 1 tbsp, but I think it could have used even more. I liked it, but it was also better the next day.

I enjoyed this recipe but paid attention to the other reviews and spiced it up a little.   I added a teaspoon of chili paste along with the curry powder (purchased from an Indian market) which added some sparkle.   I used pork tenderloin cut into 1/2 inch cubes instead of chicken which worked well.   I was in a bit of a rush and did not have time to simmer for the full time but it still tasted GREAT.  Try it over sticky Asian rice which soaks up the sauce...

The recipe was great, but I changed it a little to get the results I wanted.  For the tomatos, i bought tiny grape tomatos and quartered them.  Additionally, I did not think that there was enough curry in the recipe.  I probably used about twice as much as what is called for.  I also used cubed chicken breast instead of a whole chicken and there was no problem at all.  For the best results, go to an asian market and buy curry there.  Curry fromt he supermarkets tend to be bland.  Anyway, if you can't read the lable, it's probably a good curry.  The last thing I did different was that I added some cayene pepper to the recipe to give it a kick.  All in all, i thought it was great and I will cook it again.  My guests loved it.

This is a very good recipe and easy to make. If you like to taste the curry like we do :-) we might want to add more than what the recipe reccomends. Other than that it turned out great!

I really like this recipe.  It is a great substitute for chili on cold dreary days.  I didn't add the lemon juice, used 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts and I served it with brown rice.  Very easy to fix.  My family gobbles it up!

Pretty good stuff... the flavors combined well and the lemon juice at the end really gave it some zip. We served this with the Coconut Rice recipe found on allrecipes.com too and it worked out great!!! Thanks so much Valeriekooka...YUMMY DISH!!!!

I added extra curry and brown sugar. I also marinated the chicken in yogurt and tumeric. I forgot about the lemon juice and ate it without and really liked the flavor.  Next time I heated it up I added lemon juice and I didn't like it as much so next time, I'll just skip this step.  I also added green beans and sweet potato to the mix while cooking.  I'll definitely make it again, without lemon juice.

Really liked this and the aroma is amazing. Followed the advice of several reviewers by tripling the garlic and more than doubling the curry. Used lite Thai coconut milk to save fat and calories and a can of garlic seasoned petite diced tomatoes as substitutes. Also added a Tbsp of light brown sugar to the coconut milk stage. Served over brown rice. Not spicy at all but that's easy to adjust. My family enjoyed, husband said "great restaurant quality". Will definitely make again.

This was quite good! I added more onion and garlic, also some coarsely chopped bell pepper, carrots cut into large matchstick pieces, and chopped celery.Used a spicy curry powder, but I also added a bit of cayenne for extra kick. Thanks for this keeper, Valerie!

This is great! Followed other user's suggestions and marinated the chicken first in plain yogurt mixed with some turmeric for about 30 mins, and added in a tablespoon of brown sugar when I added the tomatoes. ******* READ THIS *****IN A FLASH OF GENIUS, I HAD THE IDEA TO ADD SOME LEFTOVER PUMPKIN I HAD IN THE PANTRY (IT IS NOVEMBER). I ADDED ABOUT 1/2 CUP IN WITH THE COCONUT MILK AND LET IT SIMMER TOGETHER UNTIL REDUCED. THE PUMPKIN MADE IT EVEN CREAMIER AND HEARTIER. GAVE IT A LITTLE SOMETHIN SOMETHIN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING THIS!!!!!!

The end result i got from this curry was delicious, but i ended up needing to make many adaptions.  1. I use diced chicken breast instead of a whole chicken 2. I used the 2 tbsp of sugar like everyone reccomends 3. I used 2 tbsp of mild curry paste instead of curry powder 4. And i added a chopped red bell pepper.  Very tasty with my adaptions i think

We thought this was good although I did triple the garlic and curry and I also added 2 Serrano peppers and a heavy shake of cayenne. We like it a bit spicy. Served over Jasmine rice.

All the presentation and colors turned out lovely.  The only issue is it is a very basic recipe and does not have much flavor.  No matter how much extra seasoning my husband & I added, it did little to enhance the flavor.  It tasted fine though.  We added some hot chili sauce to spice it up and ate the rest.

This recipe is AMAZING!  It's the first curry dish I've made and am so pleased with it.  It's just as good as the restaurants I've been to here in Japan.  This will DEFINITELY be a staple recipe in my home.  My family loved it and my friend loved the leftovers.  :)

this was good but definately needed some improvement. i agree with the previous cooks who said that the addition of extra garlic, brown sugar and cayenne or some other heat source are necessary. and that one can of coconut milk is too much. i used half a can and about 2T of yogurt to add thickness. whats more, i used 2 fresh tomatoes instead of canned and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon for extra aroma. i also think that the sauce can be prepared ahead of time and stored in fridge til needed, adding sauted chicken (or shrimp, which i used and really liked)when serving.

I gave this 5 stars because it was just so darn easy to make, especially after a long day of work! It was delicious and creamy...I will add a bit of spice and garlic to kick it up a bit but it's definitely delish!

I was really stressed out today because i wanted to make a chicken curry but none of the recipies on this site got consistent reviews. In the end I improvised, basically making this recipie with fresh ginger. It turned out fantastic -- but I agree with the other reviewer who said hers was good because she was a good cook. The trick is you can't work with this particular recipie like a robot -- think of it more like friendly advice than engineering specifications. If it doesn't taste good it means you aren't done yet!!! For me the key was getting the salt right and adding lots and lots of extra garlic (I had garlic powder but fresh would have been better). The only thing I'd do differently is that next time I'd throw in some potatoes. And start cooking earlier than I did today.

Perfect curry dish.  I am squeamish about handling raw chicken, so I just used an already roasted chicken from the supermarket.  I have mild curry powder, so I doubled up on that.  I figure if I wanted to kick up the heat, I have enough cayenne and chili powder to do the job, but decided I didn't need it.  I've always shunned curry dishes with tomatoes, it just didn't feel right.  So this is my first dish, and it tastes wonderful!  The brightness of the tomatoes work very well with the sweetness of the coconut milk.

Loved it! My suggestion is to add 1 TBSP of sugar to the finished curry...it makes it taste more like the curries served in our favorite resturant.

The best recipe yet! I used 4 heaping teaspoons of curry instead of 2.  I chopped a red bell and green bell pepper and added that to the mix at the same time I added the chicken(threw in garlic powder, salt, and pepper at that time too)Instead of whole tomatoes, I got a can of diced tomatoes that had basil, garlic, & oregano in it, and didn't drain them. I also used 3 bay leaves, and waited until the coconut milk was added to put them in.  Then I let it simmer, covered, on low heat for about two hours. Also didn't use the lemon juice.  We ate it with basmati rice.  I will definitely make this again. Superb!

My son made this as his first almost uniaded cooking adventure, (he's 11) he served it with "Mombasa Pumpkin Dessert" and "Spicy African Yam Soup".

This was amazing!!! The whole meal has been added to our family favorites.  We love Indian and Thai foods, so this was right up our alley, though it had a distinctive flavor that let the African theme shine through.  I can't say enough good about this dish.
The one cunfusing part is the call for Curry, since Curry is a spice blend, there are so many different kinds I was not sure if it called for the red, yellow or green variaties which all have very distinct hotnesses and flavors.  I told my son to do a half and half with yellow tumeric based curry and half Pataks vindaloo curry paste. It was so good we did not have leftovers.  It was served over basmati rice. A+++++

This recipe could be  just so-so.  But we've found it outstanding when using a genuine Patak hot indian curry paste and adding cauliflower and peas.  Also coconut milk is a big plus but a caloric nuclear bomb.  We compromise here by using a lite version of that ingredient.

Great recipe! I just moved and had very little in my pantry but this recipe saved the day! I browned the onions until they were very dark brown and I did not add the coconut milk (i didn't have any but will try with the coconut milk again another time. Everyone loved it and it was very simple I served it with rice and french bread.

Tried this recipe last evening.  Awesome!!  All the flavors our family really like.  Easy to prepare and very tasty.  I was out of Basmati rice, so served it with long-grain white rice with curry.  Used all chicken breasts cut in bite-size pieces about 1.5 lbs total weight, which was plenty.  I doubled amount of onions, garlic, and curry but only because we (personally) like spicier food.  This is a real keeper, and I will it make again and again. 
Any suggestions of what to serve with this recipe would be greatly appreciated.

I'm not sure I can give a fair evaluation of this one.  I think I used the wrong coconut milk in it (I think mine was sweetened, though my hubby swore that's all the store had...)  If the coconut milk lists sugar as an ingredient, it will be waaaaaaaaayyyy too sugary.  BUT, if I just used the wrong coconut milk, then I think it would be excellent.  I'll definitely look for a different coconut milk and try it again.  It smelled awesome!!  And my family DID eat it.  I just couldn't get past the sweetness.

I've had better and simpler curries.  The flavors aren't very intense I'm sorry to say but the coconut milk is a distinctive addition.  If only it were more highly concentrated or better absorbed by the chicken.

My husband is from Australia and really loves a good curry.  He thought this was just average.  I have to agree.  I thought it was bland.  I tried it with the Coconut Rice recipe someone else recommended and I really liked that!

This recipe was delicious! I doubled the recipe using two pounds of turkey cutlets cut into chunks (turkey was about half the price of  chicken breasts, and buying a whole chicken was too much effort) but only used one can of coconut milk.  That was plenty - lots of coconutty sauce.  Like everyone else, I doubled the curry and even added a pinch of red pepper.  It was great served with couscous - everyone loved it!

I took other reviewer's advice and doubled the curry.  Good idea!  It turned out marvelous!  And, just like any good curry with coconut milk, it tastes MUCH better the next day as leftovers.  Thanks!

Super good! A nice, versatile stew. I made some changes for what I was in the mood for. I added sweet peppers, whole habanero with holes poked in it, curry powder, chicken instead of garbanzo beans (dietary issue otherwise I would have kept the garbanzos), and added some brown sugar and coconut. Kept all other ingredients and seasoning the same. This will stay in regular rotation due to ease, taste, versatility, and healthiness.

even with a supermarket bought curry powder, the dish is great. i added in mushrooms and broccoli to make it more filling and also added brown sugar (as others recommended) and my personal favorite, siracha sauce! it adds a perfect amount of heat and gives it a small taste of garlic. also, as advice i would increase the amount of curry powder by A LOT and add in more salt and brown sugar if your curry powder is like mine and is suited for people that cant handle the flavor of real curry. next time i will purchase curry from an ethnic foods store. :) :) :)

I have a VERY large family and there is no way to make a recipe like this (even doubled) without them coming to make sandwiches 30  minutes later. SO....I used this as my base recipe and just after the onions had browned, I added peeled, washed and chopped carrots, potatoes and sweet potatoes and allowed them to cook for about 10 minutes before adding the curry, etc. Because of how much room it took in the pan, I transferred these ingredients to a crockpot and then browned the chicken in olive oil with the remnants of the earlier mixture still in the pan. Once slightly browned I added the chicken to the vegetable and curry mixture already in the crock pot, added a little hot water and then covered and cooked on high for 4 hours. All I had to do following my errands was make rice to serve with it. 
(Half the family ate it with Basmati rice and the other half ate it with long grain brown rice!) 
EVERYONE was licking their plates clean. TOTALLY making this again! The chicken doesn't make or break it. We have Hindu guests coming for dinner and I'm making it the same way....only without the chicken. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GREAT RECIPE!

I closely followed the recipe but also used some of the suggestions. It was one of the best things I have ever cooked and I'm a pretty good cook. I used Trader Joes chickens curry cutlets and I think that made a significant difference. I can't wait to make this again.  Served with basmati brown rice and sautéed spinach. AWESOME!

It's been quite some time since I had a curry dish and I decided to give this one a try, mainly due to the fact that it looked easy and only had 10 ingredients. It was delicious and I will definitely have this again soon! I did take the advice in the CCOTTINO review below of marinating chicken in yogurt and turmeric, extra onion and garlic, more curry, 1/2 of the coconut milk and 1/2 lemon juiced.

This recipe is worth every star, it's fast, easy and delicious.  It's not as hot as other curries but it's easy enough to adjust if you want it hotter.  I usually make it with a pound of shrimp.  I added 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric and 1/4 tsp cumin.  I also cut the coconut milk to half a can to get a thicker sauce and to cut back on the fat intake.  I followed the cooking directions as written.  Thanks Valerie for the great curry recipe.

This was just okay. The coconut milk was nice idea in theory, but a whole can is terribly fattening and if you eat this the same day you make it all you taste is coconut milk.  It was, however, much better leftover the next day but I wouldn't make this again when there are so many better curry recipes out there.

This was absolutely delicious!  Instead of a whole chicken, I used 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast cut into chunks.  Then I served it over brown rice and shredded cabbage.

To tenderize the chicken I marinated it in fat free plain yogurt with tumeric and garlic stirred in for a couple hours, then I browned it before adding to the onion mix.
I was out of curry, so I mixed my own African curry powder: 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons dried garlic 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground turmeric 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1/2 teaspoon hot chili powder.
I doubled the recipe and only used 1 can of coconut, kicked the curry to at least double, added a bit more cayenne pepper and cumin. YUM!
*I added thin sliced red potato, red pepper and green peas to the onion at the end, too. Forget about the lemon, you don't need it!

I used cut up whole chicken. It was good but more runny than I'd like. I thought about thickening it a little. I upped the salt a little and used fresh roma tomatoes and sauted that down a good while. I still thought it should be thicker.

I loved this, and of course, tweaked it just a bit.  I added 2 big tablespoons of a very spicy Vindaloo curry paste (you can find it in your local grocery store w the Indian foods, usually), cooked cubed potatoes, and peas.  
I also lightly sauteed some shrimp until barely done, and added in the last 5 minutes of the simmering time near the end.  
Used the whole can of coconut milk, no problems with the sauce being runny at all.  
Really good, restaurant quality dish.  Now I can have curry whenever I want!

I loved this.  I used skinned chicken thighs with bone left in and added 1/2 cup of fresh peas from the farmer's market.  I kept it mild and sweet and completely forgot about the lemon juice at the end.  It didn't need it.

I first tried this recipe as is (except for using boneless, skinless chicken breasts chopped into pieces) and found it to be too bland.  I added seassoned salt(McCormick only!), garlic and onion powders, red (cayenne) and black peppers, and probably 1.5-2x more curry powder and it came out great.  When I am  in the mood for really spicy, I add in chopped serrano peppers.

I gave this five stars because I substituted several ingredients/made alterations and it still came out fantastic. When I went to add the coconut milk, I found that it had gone out of date. The closest substitute I had on hand was cream of coconut. I used all I had left in the bottle (about 8 oz) and added regular milk to make 14 ounces. I used some leftover roasted pork loin as the meat, added two potatoes cut into cubes, an extra tablespoon of curry, 1/4 tsp cayenne and a couple of fresh Roma tomatoes in addition to the canned. I thought for sure it would come out terrible due to substituting the coconut milk, but like I said, still fantastic. I'll definitely make it again.

Ok, I'm not a knowledgeable curry cook so maybe that is why I had trouble? It seemed that many people had great success with a few modifications, but mine turned out to be very watery. I think I need a step-by-step guide on curry.

Abso-flippin-lutely fantastic. My girlfriend and I love this recipe. We follow it to the letter, put it over rice, and serve in a bowl. The only thing we do different is use boneless/skinless chicken cut into cubes and brown them before adding them to the mixture.

I did alter the recipe a bit because of some of the other reviews.  Here is what I did.  I added some hot chili powder to spice it up, curry paste instead of powder, and I had cooked the rice in coconut milk so I added cream instead of the coconut milk to the chicken. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  This was fabulous!!  Just a bit of a kick.  MMMM  Can't wait to make this again.

Really good! Both me and my boyfriend love it! I used boneless thighs, more than double the curry and garlic and salt. I also added golden raisins which really added to the dish. Forgot the lemon juice but will add it next time. This is a great recipe, can't wait to make again!

This was very delectable. I followed the exact recipe without the onions (because my husband hates onions)but added onion powder. It was very good but I think next time I will tweak it and add some cayenne pepper or other things to give it a little bit more spicyness and flavor. Mine came out a little runny as well. I'm still trying to think of a way to make it a little thicker but it was delicious! This is definitly going to be kept in my special recipe folder! The family really liked it!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I added more salt and curry to our taste.  I also threw in some red pepper flakes and some cayenne for some more heat.  I didn't have any coconut milk so I used 3 tbsps of yoghurt instead and added a bit of lime juice instead of lemon.

It was tasy, I added more cumin and coriander. I did not have any unsweetened coconut milk so I used Goya's creame of coconut(sweetened), I used only half of cup. My family loved it.

I made this dish tonight, I think it was a good base, but for me it seemed to be missing something.  I added some cayenne as others had recommended, I think this definitely helped.  I also used 3 1/2 tsp of curry.  I felt it could have been a tad sweeter, I think another poster recommended 1 Tbsp of sugar, I think I'll give that a try next time. Overall, a start to something good, just need to get the adjustments figured out.

My whole family loved this! Tasted justlike the curry we get here in Kenya...yummy! The reason I only gave it a 4 star was because I thought it was rather bland without the cayenne pepper. But adding some cayenne pepper (a half of teaspoon I think) made it just perfect for us. I also added extra garlic and I forgot to add the lemon, I'll have to do that next time. This is a favorite! Thanks Valeriekooka!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit! This is a very easy recipe - the only change I made was that I added an extra teaspoon of curry. I personally found it to be a little tiny bit bland, but everyone else thought it was perfect - I had no leftovers. One hint: the quality of your curry powder really matters in this recipe; make sure your spices are fresh. 
This is a standard recipe for me now!

This recipes is awesome!  I added green pepper for more texture and content, and also a little sugar to neutralize the acidity of the tomatoes.  We absolutely loved it!

I added 1/2 more onion (red for sweetness), a bell pepper, and 2 double amount of curry (using Spicy Masala).

Add double the spices, unless you want it real dull and bland, which seems more like gruel to me, than curry.

After visiting a Thai restaurant and experiencing a delicious coconut curry dish, I immediately searched for a recipe that would duplicate it.  To my surprise I found this wonderful recipe that was right on!!!  I did add some cooked cubed pototoes, carrots and some frozen peas.  It is sort of stew-like.  I served it with rice.  Thank you for this yummy new recipe that I will keep and make again and again.

Although this recipe wasn’t difficult to prepare, it required a lot of time watching the pan on the stove.  It smelled delicious while I was preparing it, but the result was rather disappointing.  The curry was on the bland side.  This dish could be improved if vegetables are added.  At present, the dish is only chicken in a bland curry.  It lacks taste and texture.  I served the chicken and curry over rice, which soaked up the sauce and added texture, but did not alter its essential blandness.  It wasn’t terrible, but it needed something extra.

If you love bland food you'll love this recipe.  I didn't trust the other negative reviews because I thought the ingredients sound okay.  I was very wrong.  I doubled the garlic and curry and added cayenne and a bunch of salt, still no luck.  If you really want a great coconut milk / curry dish try the VIETNAMESE STYLE VEGETARIAN CURRY SOUP (I'm sure you can add meat if you'd like).

Recently married, and still learning to cook :) My husband loved this one! I also added more curry and used a bit less coconut. I used some of the coconut milk for my rice. It went really well together. I'm learning...

Thanks!

BLAND. very disappointing, considering the rave reviews. from the ingredients, it sounds like it would make a tasty dish. perhaps the amount of coconut milk drowns out the other flavors? i would not make this again.

This is a great recipe. It's got a little bit of tanginess to it, because of the lemon juice. Really, really good, though not spicy at all.

I have used this recipe several times and I really liked it.  It serves as a good base for light experimentation.  I prefer a little bit less coconut milk than the directions ask for, but either way it tastes delicious.

Absolutely Delicious!  I couldn't believe how easy this was to make and how good it tasted.  I enjoyed it over brown rice.  I agree with the other reviews, that it tastes even better the next day, if that is possible.  I will be making this again.

This instantly became one of my favorites.  The temptation is to cook it too often and thus get tired of it.  Changes I made:  I used diced tomatoes.  Also, a lot more curry powder. I used a TB for 2 servings, so 2-3 TB for a full recipe.  Also, 1 TB brown sugar (2-3 for full recipe) and 1/2 tsp. ground chili pepper (again, 1/2-3/4 for full recipe).  Also used extra coconut milk.  This recipe is fast to make and heaven to eat!

I really enjoyed this dish! I followed other's suggestions & added cayenne pepper & brown sugar because I like my curry spicy & a bit sweet. Next time I will make this with scallops or shrimp because the chicken didn't absorb the sauce as well as I hoped. Can't wait to try it again!

I mistakenly bought sweetened coconut cream, I just put 3T of that with whipping cream to make up for the unsweetened coconut milk- tasted great. I added extra curry and red pepper to perk it up a bit. Very yummy.

Not having ever tasted African Curry before, I assumed (perhaps wrongly) that there would be a bit more zing to this recipe.  I found it to be awfully bland.  After sitting in the frig over night, it definitely tastes better as the chicken was allowed to marinate in the curry sauce, but still a so-so recipe.

I really liked this dish.  It's a good one for people who aren't too sure about curry, because it wasn't too spicy (I think in the future I'll make it a little spicier).  The coconut milk adds a little sweetness that is pleasant.  I'll return to this recipe often, I'm sure!

I changed the recipe a little -- I used vegetarian chicken pieces, vindaloo seasoning instead of curry, and added tomatillos. I thought it was good, but not nearly as spicy as I expected since the vindaloo seasoning is quite hot without coconut milk. I added more salt than indicated as well, and,as others suggested, added brown sugar. Overall, a good dish. I will make it again.

I thought this was a very simple and tasty recipe.  I added a bit more curry that it called for, as well as extra salt.  Next time I use this recipe I plan to try using even more curry and an additional clove of garlic for extra zing.  This will definitely be a recipe I visit again in the future.

Great for the 2 of us with conflicting palates - I love exotic foods, my hubby prefers traditional American. I didn't have enough chicken so I used a couple whole skin-on bone-in chicken parts and hot Italian turkey sausage, browning before adding the onions, rmeoving and re-adding. Also added a touch of collards and okra.

This was an interesting and flavorful dish! Instead of using a whole chicken i just used boneless, skinless chicken breast. I also omited the bay leaf. My husband commented that maybe next time i should add something to make it a little spicy, and i agree. Will make again!

I just LOVE curry but have never made it myself before, and I have to say, this was simple and hit the spot!  I made some slight alterations by using beef (what I had on hand), 5 teaspoons Garam Masala for my curry powder, a can of petite diced tomatoes with olive oil and garlic (again, what I had on hand), 1/2 a lemon and 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 5 cloves of garlic, and 1/2 a can of coconut milk.  I am not sure if my curry powder was the wrong kind or if it was old, but it wasn't nearly spicy enough for us with only 2 teaspoons.  However, we LOVE our food really spicy, so it's just a personal preference.  My only suggestion is to add  the lemon juice in a little at a time, making sure it doesn't get too tart for you.  But do NOT leave out the lemon juice, it is the KEY to making this recipe shine! My hubby and I loved it and the teenager went back for 2nds!!

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for my husband, and brother-in-law, (who are from Africa), and they both loved it.  My brother-in-law said it reminded him of home!

This was fantastic!  As per some previous reviews I added a sliced red bell pepper, bamboo shoots and I sliced some petite mushrooms into the mix.  Add the pepper in shortly after the onions, the mushrooms with about 10 min left on the chicken and the bamboo shoots (drained) with about 5 min left on the chicken.  Delicious!

My family liked this recipe.  I couldn't get chicken at my local supermarket that day, so I used spiced chicken rissoles that I would normally put on the barbecue, and it tasted great.  We used light coconut milk (Trying to watch the waistline!)My husband is a picky eater and does not like curries, but he ate this one no worries and my 18 month old daughter had no problems with the curry either.

Pretty good, but i didn't have curry powder so i  substituted a 1/2 tsp of cayenne, tumeric, coriander, cumin, and cloves. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. Also, I'm not a huge fan of coconut curries but not to shabs nonetheless.

I didn't add the lemon juice and the recipe seemed ok.  This recipe definitely needs more kick though!  I'll have to try cayenne or red pepper flakes next time like others have suggested.

This was okay.  I was expecting it to have more kick than it did.  Next time I will add half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes & maybe use a hotter curry.

My husband isn't big on curry but went nuts over this!!  I added an extra 6 cloves of garlic and extra onion also only used 1/2 the coconut milk.  I also used 2 cans (instead of 1) of diced tomoatoes!  So awesome!  Will add some more salt next time.

This turned out excellant.  I am a new curry eater, so I was glad to hear that a few people thought this recipe wasn't spicy enough. I did add just a bit more curry (about 3 teaspoons total).  I also used diced tomatoes and did not drain them before adding them to the pot. This might have made the dish a bit soupy, but I just added a little bit of flour to thicken it back up (well worth it if you want a little more tomato flavor) I made the dish for myself and some friends, and we all loved it. I will definetly make this again.

This recipe was very easy, but the end result was quite bland.  I added more salt and some fresh basil in my leftovers, which added a bit more zing.  I will try this recipe again, but I will propbaly marinate my chicken, add more curry and salt, and try other spices as well.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe! It smells so good cooking that all my neighbors asked me what I was cooking. My toddler loves it too. I don't have access to different curries here the only one  I could find was very mild. I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. 
Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted terrible. I love things with curry in it but I've never eatten "curry" itself. Maybe it was because my curry power was pretty old? Not sure but probably won't attempt it again.

This was not a bad curry, but it definitely did not have the rich and full taste that I was expecting from a coconut-based curry. In general, disappointing.

HUGE hit with the people that I cooked this one for. As far as modifications I did a lot of the things others did, used brown sugar, put in some mushrooms, used light coconut milk, I used boneless skinless breasts cut into bit sized pieces. Since my batch of this was going to be transported to somewhere that was outdoors in the evening I did it in a slowcooker and at the last hour I tossed in brown rice so everyone could just dish in strait to a plate or bowl and everything was perfect! I will make this one again and again my thanks to Valariekooka for sharing and for all of the other raters suggestions for making this a smash hit!

This was okay but not something i would rush to make again. I love to cook with coconut milk as well as curry but i found this to be lacking and pretty bland. Generally i am not hard to please, nor is my family but all of us left the table kinda disappointed.

After reading other reviews, I used 2 teaspoons medium curry powder and 1/4 tsp chilli flakes in this and it came out exactly as I thought it would. Mmmmm, very tasty.

This is an excellent recipe that is now a family favourite. I changed it slightly to use 2 onions and a green bell pepper. The pepper adds to the colour and enriches the flavour.

Very good curry recipe.. I did not use the cocnut milk (I am allergic) and still tasted great!  I definitely will make it again and maybe try it with shrimp.. Thanks!

I couldn't believe how simple and delicious this recipe was. I did add more curry and carrots, brown sugar and then I added also added chick peas. My kids and husband just loved it and just couldn't believe how delicious it was. I served with basmati rice and it's a definite keeper.

I made this recipe for company and it went over very well.  I added red pepper sauce, since we like our food spicy.  It was very "saucy" so I added rice noodles to the pan at the very end.  I cooked and additional 5 minutes on a low temp.  Turned into a very nice one-dish meal.  Will be making again

Absolutely incredible - and easy to make (I'm a novice cook, looking for new things to try). I think it'd be good even without the coconut milk, for those who are trying to cut a few calories.

This was FANTASTIC!!  I doubled the curry, used a 20oz. package of bonesless, skinless chicken breast, and added about a cup of raisins right before I started adding the coconut milk.  The leftovers the next day were even better as the flavor had time to develop.  So easy, yet SO yummy!!!

Next time the chicken gets fully cooked before adding the tomatoes so I can see if the chicken is getting fully done.  The sauce does not look yellow, it's orange.  I used yellow curry powder.  When do you take out the bay leaf?  It was too much for the skillet and I had to transfer it to a larger/Dutch oven.

Delicious. I followed Carrie H's traditional spice recommendation and highly advise that. This would be awesome with shrimp over rice. Will make again! ...I just made this for the third time - this time  I added cauliflower and some spinach and it was great! I also used tomato sauce in place of the diced tomatoes.

My family loved it and I'll definitely be making it again!! I followed one of the reviewers advice and added additional garlic, a little brown sugar, only half the can of coconut milk, and some Anaheim chili powder to give it a little kick. In addition, I blended the sauce so it was nice and smooth. Instead of chicken I used tilapia filets from Costco.

I added a lot more curry, and seasoned the chicken with cumin and turmeric powder before cooking. I also added a cooked potato, no skin, because we love potatoes. It still needed a little something but this is a great base recipe and i will be experimenting more with it. Will probably add more spice next time!

This was quite good. I felt it needed a little something more, so I took the advice of another cook and added about a 1/4 t of cumin. That really brought out the flavors. I think the dark meat works best so next time will use 5-6 boneless, skinless thighs. I also like veggies in it so added a couple of sliced carrots and about a 1/2 c of frozen peas. 

I will definitely be making this again!

I used rotisserie chicken, and added  broccoli, green beans, and mushrooms.  I only had diced canned tomatoes (with jalapeno) on hand and used in place of canned whole tomatoes.

Next time, I would cut the lemon juice in half... a little tart.

Really good. Couple tips:

1. Slightly bland without chilli.
2. Make sure to use a heavy coconut milk (not the light stuff).
3. Jalapeños will add a nice kick.

We love all varieties of cooking, I've never used curry much in my cooking, but I've always loved the flavor and scent of curry and this receipt is really good, I loved it the first time I made it and I make it atleast once a month or so, the only change I made was just a bit more curry powder (1 more tsp so instead of 2 tsp I use 3 tsp) it's a wonderful receipt and I will continue to cook this dish.

Even though the taste is pretty good, I am puzzled by the lack of sauce.  I served it with rice and there was hardly any sauce.  Maybe I used too much chicken. I used 2 cups of cooked breast meat and halved the rest since the entire recipe called for an entire chicken.   I really needed the entire sauce amount for the 2 cups of chopped chicken.   The picture seems to show a lot more sauce.

I made this as is and it was alright. My children liked it, it just didn't satisfy the curry craving I was having. If I make this again I will make some of the adjustments others have suggested.

This was so delicious, I used a stalk of lemon grass instead of lemon juice, 3 garlic cloves, one tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp curry and cooked chicken breasts. Had a girlfriend over for our curry fix and she loved it.
 Thanks for this recipe, I've tagged it shared it and will make it again and again.
Here’s the review I followed...
Note:
This recipe is awesome! The only recommendation I would make (my mother was raised in India, so she taught me): the difference between a good curry & a great curry is what my aunt called the broth. The broth is what is made with the spices & the onion. The curry powder (paste is even better) should be cooked in the oil until it is ready - usually about 5 minutes. Then add the onion & spice - cook until the onion is translucent. This will take about 10 minutes, but it makes all the difference in the world. Add more oil as the onion is cooking, if necessary. Then add the tomato (fresh is even better - strained) and cook it for a little while. NOW you're ready to make the curry. This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family!

I like it but 1 lemon was way too much. Half a lemon would be better and I think I will add some cayenne pepper next time to spice it up. Good base recipe though.

Liked it a lot. My picky child even ate it! Made with carrots, bell peppers and potatoes because I wanted a meat free dish. 1 T garlic, 1 T cumin, 1T brown sugar as suggested in other posts.

I upped the curry powder to about a tablespoon and added a few dashes of cayenne, and the seasoning was pretty spot on. I kind of wish I'd left out the lemon juice at the end though - it tasted better before I added it.

This was delicious! I did add a little bit of sugar, as suggested by a previous review. I would like to add some cayenne pepper, but my kids are sensitive to spice. But on the bright side, they are devouring it as a type! I also made garlic naan bread to dip in it. Yummy!

This was great! I have made this twice. The first time I made this as written and the second time using fresh tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. Both times resulted in very tasty curry. The second time I added a little more garlic about 2-3 cloves more, adjusted seasoning to taste (curry powder, salt, pepper), and served with extra lemon wedges.

I loved this dish.  Could easily be made with chicken tenders or breast. I didn't bone the thighs, legs or wings and cut up the breast into chunks.  Following some of the other comments, I marinaded the skinned chicken in yogurt, turmeric and pepper.  I used canned tomatoes, 6 cloves of garlic and 1 purple onion and 1 white onion since I had both types.  I made my own curry powder using the recipe another reviewer had posted. My Dad grew up in India and he told us they always made fresh curry powder.  I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1 teas so my son would eat it.  This amount gave no kick.    I served it with Mediterranean Quinoa, (allrecipe.com) instead of rice as I try to stay with low glycemic foods. The two dishes blended very well.  The following day, I mixed the leftovers together and added fresh chopped plum tomatoes, more of the fresh curry powder and more cayenne pepper so that it had some kick.  Was even better the 2nd time around.

OK - I'm giving this one 4 stars provided that you first check out the the excellent suggestions in the reviews. I made the African curry that one of the reviewers provided since I didn't have curry powder (& didn't feel like running to the store :).   I also marinated cut up chicken breasts in yogurt mixed with turmeric and black pepper as suggested by another reviewer (but I wiped off most of it before adding to the skillet). I also added 2 T butter to the sauce along with some brown sugar before adding light unsweetened coconut milk (all I had on hand).  I think it needed the regular coconut milk as the sauce seemed a bit thin.  I didn't care for the fresh lemon juice and am glad I only added a small amount.  I had to add a bit of fine sea salt at the end too. So, this is a good recipe with some additions and I'll make it again. I'm amazed at all the reviews!

Yummy! I did make a few changes per other reviews - double curry and garlic. I used 2 chicken breasts and 1 package 21-25 count jumbo shrimp. Excellent combination!

Very, very good.  Will definitely make again.  The only comment I have is that it was much more mild than I expected.  I will probably add a little more spice the next time I make it.

Wonderful recipe! I changed the recipe by adding 6 cloves of garlic, 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 can of coconut milk, 1/2 of the juice from a lemon, and 1/8 ginger.  I served it over rice.  We then put shredded coconut, oranges, bananas, and raisins on top. I need to still play with it, but it was very close to the curry that the cooks would make for us in bordering school in Nigeria, West Africa.

My husband and I thought this recipe was terrific!  Although I did forget to add the lemon at the end- Possibly because after tasting it in the pan we just couldn’t wait to get it on our plates! 

I did make one changes only because I did not have a can of whole tomatoes on hand I used a can of “Ro*tel” (tomatoes and green chilies) instead. I wasn’t sure about doing it since it had the added green chili but I had no other choice.  I am sure this added to the spiciness.  

I also want to mention that I use Red Curry spice from McCormicks (I do love to cook but don’t consider myself all that experienced/knowledgeable so maybe someone else can clarify- is red curry spicier than traditional yellow curry spice?) I have used regular curry spice before and don’t remember it being so spicy.  I doubt the can of rotel alone would increase the heat of this dish this much on its own.  We love spicy food so I was delighted with the flavor these changes provided. Especially after I read reviews stating that the dish was bland.  

No blandness here-  My nose was running, my tongue was burning  and my body temp was rising as I finished my second helping!   This will go into the regular rotation at our house!

It was great.  I added some other spices because all I had was Jamaican curry.  I added about 1/2 tsp chili power, extra curry, 1 tbsp paprika, and a few shakes of dried cilantro.  It was great.  OH!  I also added red peppers and let the   coconut milk reduce a bit before serving.  You can do pretty much anything with this and make it great.

This was a good curry.  I chopped the tomatos up, and added the liquid (I didn't see the "drained" on the recipe).  I also only added 1 tsp of lemon juice (and I couldn't taste it.)  I used 3 chicken breasts, it is easier than deboning and skinning a chicken.  I liked the amount of curry that was in the recipe, that way you could taste the coconut milk.  Cayenne pepper might be a good addition, but it was still good without. Don't forget to serve over rice.

This was super-easy to make, though it tasted like it took more time and energy than it did.  I added more curry and red pepper since we like the spice, and we made it with crab; it turned out great.  This will surely become a regular of mine.  Thnx.

This was okay.  My boyfriend thought it was good and he is a chef so it must have been fine.  I added bamboo shoots and baby corn to this and used pork loin cut up rather than chicken.  I also used 3 tsp of curry as others said to.  I also added a little sugar to it because I like it a little more sweeter.  Added mango chutney as well.

This was an absolute winner! My guests and myself loved it. I did however change some of the ingredients because I didn't have coconut milk. I add the suace recipe which I used. This is also a very nice starter with raw vegetables.
Minted Pea And Yoghurt Dip
1 x 200 ml tub of yoghurt
1-2 handfuls of fresh mint, leaves picked
2 handfuls of fresh potted peas
a handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese

I was looking for something a little different, and discovered this delicious dish.  I would never have thought to put coconut milk in a curry chicken recipe!  Fabulous!!!

This was a very good recipe.  I liked how simple and quick it was.  I liked the fact that the ingredients are things I usually always have on hand, and I liked that it was a more flavourful curry recipe than those I've made in the past.  I wished it had been a been on the spicy side (which I will experiment with the next time I make it).

This is yummy! 4 stars for the flavour from a very simple and fast dish to create. It's always been a hit, even among those who aren't into ethnic foods much.

This was thee best curry dish I have ever had.
I tried it with chicken and every time I cook it I have no left overs.
Just a wonderful wonderful flavor.
The only thing I would add is there are several types of curry which do you use.I find I had to add More curry 
I also added potatoes and cayenne pepper for a little kick.

This recipe is WOW!  The only thing I added to it was bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and extra curry.  I served it over jasmine rice and now it is a family favorite.  Thanks for this recipe!

Fantastic! But I did add some diced tomatoes with green chili peppers and that added the right amount of spice to the soup. Also it is important is use Madras Curry. I also added about 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms.My soup group could not stop talking about it. I'll diffently make it again.

Very good.  I agree with the others that it needs more curry spice, but it's an easy enough adaptation.

I didn't have any idea how this would taste but it turned out to be exactly what I wanted. I just needed a recipe to use up some coconut milk and was pleased to find one that didn't involve too many exotic ingredients. We ate it with seasoned rice. Thanks to the submitter!
