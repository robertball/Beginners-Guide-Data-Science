The family loved it.  Used only 1 can of tomatoes and 1 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  Will be on the meal rotation.

My husband and I happened to catch a special on this competition, and he decided then that he wanted to try it. Since then, it has become the dish that he requests the most, and is the most willing to take leftovers of to work for lunch.  Since then I have served it for a variety of family members (all of whom were delighted by it), and given out multiple copies of the recipe. 
I always remind the people to make sure the corn muffin mix is the 'complete' kind. My dumplings did not turn out as well one time, and it turned out I had used a box that required eggs, oil, etc.

Very nice Mexican-type dish.  Great for a quick meal as there is not much prep...i.e., chopping, measuring, etc.  Make sure you use a very large skillet.

This was not a winner in my household. It smelled so good and looked quite yummy but it just didn't do the trick. We ended up throwing it all away and going out to grab a bite to eat. I was really disappointed but that's all part of trying new recipes, I suppose.
