I used a little more of everything to make a larger batch and used 2 cans of Ro*Tel. This looks and tastes amazing.

We made this and came to the conclusion it is very similar to "trash can" chili which we love.

This was super easy to make & very good. I added fresh garlic.  Next time I will make it with no salt added tomatoes & corn & rinse the beans as I feel it’s salty enough with the taco seasoning & ranch dressing mix

After cooking a chicken breast (sous vide), I cut it up and replaced the ground beef in the recipe. Everyone loved the soup. I thought it was good, but I think beef would be better.

Great recipe! Use your imagination to make it more your taste or add/delete flavor! I added sour cream topping with fresh cilantro and cooked and shredded my own chicken breasts instead of hamburger!  Only missing avacado!  Thanks for the great base!

What a hearty filling soup. Thought it would have more kick but pretty good anyway.

Tasty but Sodium level was too excessive. I made it using *Low Sodium Beans, No Sodium stock or broth, omitted the olives (which don’t sound appealing in soup anyhow) and only used about 1/2 to 3/4 of Taco seasoning package (to taste). Big improvement in the salt content! Cilantro was added just before serving.  Served with fresh Lime wedges, hot sauce on the side. Garnished with dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of grated tangy cheese. Avocado is also great! It was so tasty we had seconds and I ate the rest for breakfast next day! Yum.

This is a favorite of mine. I am not a big olive fan, so I don’t know about those, but I have a batch of this in the frig right now. I found pork stew meat half price so I used that. I used a can of hominy instead of the pinto beans. 

I’ve made this many times over the years. The combination of seasoning packets and Rotel make the flavor great and you can switch up the meats and veggies depending on what you have. It’s always good, especially with Fritos.

I omitted the olives but followed everything else exactly. Came out a little watery for our taste so I simmered longer to thicken it up. Next time will add more ranch as we didn’t really detect it.

I added more taco and ranch seasoning. Topped it off with light sour cream and cheese.  One bowl hit the spot and my kids loved it.

When I made this soup, I realized that it tasted exactly like Wendy's chili, which I was not going for or expecting, but everyone loved it. I browned the meat separately before adding the onion and jalapeno,  because I like to get it nice and brown without the onion releasing juices and making the meat steam. I also did not see the need for the olives, instead added some corn, served it with sour cream, shredded cheddar, and tortilla chips. A nice, tasty recipe.

I added less water & it was perfect. Did not include the black olives except as a garnish.
