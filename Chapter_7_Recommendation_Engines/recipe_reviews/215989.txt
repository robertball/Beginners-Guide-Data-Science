Wow - nice twist on regular 'ol hard shell tacos! This is kinda like traditional Mexican meets old school Italian. It tastes like a meatball hoagie fused with a hard shell taco. So, if you like both of those you're bound to like this. Plus, it was quick and easy to put together for a weeknight meal. I seasoned the ground beef and sausage with a little minced garlic as well as Italian seasoning. I topped the "tacos" with a combination of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Overall, simply delicious!

These were good for a quick, easy economical dinner.  I did not add the sugar to the marinara sauce-jarred sauce is already loaded with sugars.  I also used soft shell tortillas.  My husband liked these.
