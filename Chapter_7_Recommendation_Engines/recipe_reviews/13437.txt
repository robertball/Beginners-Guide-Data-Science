This is a wonderful recipe for crab soup.  I am from MD and can get this in restaurants but have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  I do add some extra things, like chopped cabbage, potatoes, and birds eye frozen mixed vegs.  I don't like lima beans so I leave them out.  The extra veggies make the soup take longer to cook but it is really DELICIOUS! **Try not to use pasteurized or canned crab meat or it will give the soup a "fishy" taste.  Fresh crab meat works the best (if you can find it in your area).

I am also from Maryland and although I made a number of adjustments, this is a very good basic recipe.  Here is what changed:  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed (28 oz can), used Birdseye frozen veggies, which has green beans, corn and peas (2 small bags), 1 1/2 cups cubed potatoes, 1/2 cup chopped savoy cabbage, 2 cans (not cups) of beef broth (low sodium), 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 T. Worcheshire sauce.   3 Tablespoons of Old Bay was perfect for me, but for someone who isn't from the area, it might be a little too spicy.  I cooked it much longer on low (about 2 hours), but I don't serve it until the next day so all of the flavors can develop.

I have been cooking Maryland Crab Soup for years. It is my all time favorite. This recipe is fabulous. I added more onion, potatoes and substituted in some crushed tomatoes. The crushed tomatoes give the soup a heartier, more robust texture.

Very good!  My husband grew up in Baltimore and thought that the idea of lima beans was a bit strange so I omitted those.  I did add celery, low sodium beef broth, a cubed potato and extra Old Bay seasoning.  Fantastic!

This is almost identical to the recipe my family has used for years.  One of the main differences is that I add 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. of Worchestire sauce.  It may sound strange but it really gives it a "richer" flavor!

This was absolutely the best Maryland Crab Soup recipe I have ever made.  The taste was truly authentic.  I did, however, follow the advise of one other reviewer and added potatoes to the recipe.  Awesome!

I have been looking for a Maryland crab soup recipe for so long. This is IT!!!! It tasted almost exactly like the soup from Philips Crab House in Maryland and also available in the frozen dept. of the market. I used lump crab instead of blue and left out the claws. The only thing I would change is to add the cubed potatoes it seems to be missing. It was wonderful!!!!!

I grew up near the Chesapeake Bay and I think this soup didn't taste anything like Maryland crab soup. The broth was bland and had no depth whatsoever. Really good crab soup includes some shredded cabbage too.

This is the best and easiest tomato-based crab soup I've ever made or eaten.  I've made it several times already as we do a lot of crabbing in the summer.  I find it much easier to just use a bag of frozen mixed veggies.

Good stuff.  I added more Old Bay & used frozen soup veggies, a little black pepper & a clove of garlic.  It was awesome & will no doubt be even better tomorrow.

This is a great basic crab soup recipe.  I use a variety of veggies (onions, celery, corn, green beans, zucchini)to pack the soup full of good-for-you stuff.  I also use leftover steamed crabs and place the claws in the soup with the meat.  It gives it a little extra flavor (from the Old Bay seasoning).  A true Maryland Crab Soup recipe.  Thanks Cindy!

This is my recipe, somehow the cubed potatoes went missing from the ingredients. Sorry.  If you are from Maryland you should increase the Old Bay, Others may not have the palate for that much spice/seasoning.  When time permits, I start with homemade beef stock.  It is all the better.  Don't forget, it is even better the next day!

This soup is an AMAZING treat for anyone who loves seafood soups. I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, and a bag of classic mixed frozen veggies (corn, green beans, lima beans, carrots, and peas) instead of the other vegetables (adds up to about 3 cups). Though the crab is expensive, this soup is an impressive treat!

Love this dish!! I did a few modifications though, I substituted the 3 cups of water down to one and instead added a bottle of bloody mary mix. Went with diced potatos instead of the beans and added 3 teaspoons of Old Bay. The dish came out fantastic, the bloody mary mix gave it a very nice subtle kick to it. I'm thinking of renaming this to "Mary's Bloody Crab Soup"..Whaddya think?..:-)

This is a real deal for good crab soup and that is coming from someone in Baltimore who has made crab soup from scratch!
I did crush and cook the tomatoes, Old Bay and onions separately for 15 mins before adding the vegetables and then the crab meat. Cooking for another 15.
Next time, think I'll add a bay leaf and 1-2 tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce to add some more depth to the broth.
If you want to "bump up" the crab taste you can throw the uncooked crab claws into the soup to cook as opposed to cooking them separately. That's how cooks do it in Maryland when cooking crab soup from scratch.

THANKS sooo much for sharing this recipe!!  I added 2 potatoes and cubed them, and I also added 2 stalks of celery!  It is THAT good!!!

I made this for Super Bowl and it was a big success. I added 1 cup cubed potato, 2 stalks diced celery, 1 clove chopped garlic and subsituted the vegetables with a bag of frozen corn, carrots, lima bean and green bean mix. Since I could not find fresh blue crabmeat this time of the year, I used canned lump crabmeat.  Delicious; will make this again and again

I give it the max stars because it is unusual to get a crab soup recipe that is true to the Baltimore tradition.  I agree with others, add cubed potatoes, some crushed tomatoes and even some chopped cabbage to thicken it up.  Use low sodium broth if you put the full amount or more of Old Bay.  Great thanks!

I did the photo for this soup.  I used green beans and petite and regular diced tomatoes instead of the lima beans and stewed tomatoes.  Watch the salt level with beef broth (I used cubes and it was a bit salty) and season to taste with Old Bay.  Simmer longer for better flavor.  This is very similar to the Old Bay recipe listed as well.  Being from Maryland and now living elsewhere, this brought me back to home!

Delish! Tastes just like a Chesapeake Bay restaurant crab soup. Other recipes I tried have tomato soup as a base and it just didn't cut it. I added a large potato in small diced pieces, a bay leaf, bagged frozed mixed veggies and extra Old Bay seasoning. LOVE IT! THANKS!

This recipe is spot on.  Make sure you use real (non canned) crab meat.  I hate lima beans so I left them out and it is perfect (for me) without them.  Don't be tempted to use any salt, the Old Bay has plenty of salt in it already.  My supermarket has claw meat for sale so I didn't have to cook the claws beforehand.  If I ate this at a restaurant, I would rave about it.  It is one of the easiest to make recipes I've ever come across.  It took about ten minutes to set up.  If you were planning a party, you could make this a half hour before the guests arrived if you cooked the claws ahead of time.

We live in MD and I have been searching for a good crab soup recipe.  This is fantastic and best of all, easy to prepare.  I omitted the lima beans and added celery instead.  I also added more Old Bay and a dash of crushed red pepper to give it some extra zing.  I'll definitely be making this one for friends and family!

This is over the edge. GRrrrrreat.

I used to own property in Ocean City,Md and on every trip there I would get a bowl of this soup and savor it.
Now that I live in Myrtle Beach,SC (where one would think you could get this soup) I have been craving it. Now with this recipe I can get my "fix" whenever I need to. The only changes I made was to up the Old Bay and use more vegetables. Five stars indeed!!!!

Thanks Jen.

I just made this yesterday, my first time making crab soup. Also from Maryland so I wanted it to be good! Boy was it ever!!  I followed the recipe mostly, using suggestions from other reviewers to tweak it a bit. I omitted the crab claws, added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed. Upped the Old Bay to 3 tablespoons and just used two bags of Birds Eye mixed veggies. It was even better today. Next time I'm doubling the recipe.

this was excellent and VERY EASY!!!  we doubled the old bay since we like a little more spice.  we also let the veggies simmer and soften up a bit before adding the crab.  awesome recipe for a cold day!

Other than using a bag of mixed frozen veggies instead of a cup each of the lima beans, corn and carrots, and leaving out the claws, I followed this pretty closely. I live in MD and every restaurant around here has this soup on the menu. This version is as good as or better than any I've tasted. The key is in using a good quality, fresh crabmeat. I used a lb. of backfin. Delish!

Awesome awesome recipe.  I was looking for a recipe to use because I lost track of measurements for my old recipe and this one is a keeper! I live on the Chesapeake Bay and trust me when I say people will let you know if this soup is not right! Just remember to use lump crab meat, okra and LOTS of old bay!!!! :-) The old bay is the key to happiness with this recipe!

I'm more of a cream of crab kind of girl so I wasn't jumping up and down over this one.  My husband liked it.  I would probably add potatoes next time.

Love this dish! Fast, easy, and healthy. To make it really great, changes the two TBs onion to one half small onion, diced. Add one half cup of celery, diced thin. Sautée onion and celery with a Tablespoon of  butter until soft. Do this as the first step in the recipe, using the same pot you will be making the soup in.  Frozen veggies are fine. I prefer diced tomatoes.  The recipe is light on the Old Bay, I use 4 TBs.  Add a two shots of of Franks Red Hot Sauce (flavor but not bitter like Tobasco). Enjoy.

Great MD crab soup. I use basically the same ingredients. Instead of so much water try using half V8 or tomato juice. Makes for a heartier broth. We use the same basic recipe to make a seafood chowder also. Just add some cut up steamed shrimp, clams, muscles etc.

This was my first time making any kind of soup.  I made some adjustments, but it tasted JUST like what you would get at a seafood restaurant in Maryland!  Gave some to my sister and she and her husband loved it as did my 5 year old nephew!  I added 3 medium red potatoes, half of a small head of cabbage, frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, green beans), half a bag of lima beans, and a 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce. I also used a big can of stewed tomatoes and a big can of crushed tomatoes and the entire box of broth.  I needed more broth since I was adding more vegetables. Thanks!!!!

Delicious!   I followed the advice of another poster and added 1/3 a cup of brown sugar and about tripled the amount of Old Bay and it made a HUGE difference in the taste..gives it a richer flavor. Also, adding actual pieces of steamed crab is a great addition, and really adds to the soups flavor.  The soup will taste better the day after you make it, so you may want to refrigerate it immediatly and then have it for a meal the next day.

Wow!!  This soup is fabulous.  I made a few changes based on what other reviewers suggested:  added celery, sauteed onion, celery and carrots in some olive oil prior to adding other ingredients, also added potatos.  My husband went to school in Annapolis, MD so he has had his share of MD Crab Soup - this rivals the best of them and he can't stop raving.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe...I live in Maryland and crab soup is our specialty.  This was fantastic and I added some leftover crab claws that were already covered in old bay.

I omitted the corn and limas and added peas and green beans...one reviewer said to add potatoes but I added egg noodles(cooked first and added the last few minutes of simmer) It turned out great!!!

Pretty good.  We subbed diced tomatoes for the stewed and zucchini for the limas (no one likes them, I cringe even thinking about them...) anyway, we also liked it better after it simmered a little longer (30+ mins) before adding the crabmeat.  It was kinda salty for me, maybe the make a low sodium Old Bay?  My boyfriend's grampa had two bowls and everyone complimented while they ate it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fine. My husband and I are from Southern Maryland where this soup comes from. We both agree that this isn't the best we've had. I think it needs something else to be to our liking. Maybe crushed tomatoes and definitley more Old Bay. I probably used 3 tbsp - but we love the seasoning. It also tasted much better the next day. The first day it just tasted like veggie soup. I'll try this again sometime after tasting some crab soups in our area to see what I might change.

Great recipe.  I added a few more veggies.  I thought it looked a little slim.  I'm glad I did, it definately would have been to much crab meat per bite if I hadn't.  What a great soup.  We are from the Eastern Shore and everyone agreed this was the best crab soup they ever had.  Thank you.

A quick and easy recipe to make.  It only took 30 minutes to prepare and yummy, yummy!  Taste like the best I've had in restaurants.  I did change some of the ingredients though.  I eliminated the lima beans (don't care for them) and used the carrots and corn to make up the difference.  I also used 24 ounces of crab meat instead and WOW!,  was it good.  This recipe will be added to my favorite soups list!!

Absolutely loved it!

I fell in love with Maryland Crab Soup when I moved to Baltimore seven years ago. I had some frozen crab meat and claws from this summer, so thought I'd try making it myself. 

I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and added a potato, some A1 sauce, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Next time I would reduce the sugar just a bit. 

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Cindy! I will definitely be making it again! : )

Great recipe, everybody liked it.    I made it a few times.  The second time I changed a few things and it came out the best.   I omitted the Lima beans (both me and the wife didn't think they went with this soup.  I added cube potatoes, 2 tbs of brown sugar, a dash of Worcestershire  sauce, two stalks of celery diced up and one bay leaf and 3 tablespoons of old bay (we like everything spicy).  I also only used beef stock and no water, crush tomatoes instead of  stewed tomatoes and 1 tea spoon of tomato paste (if you don't have no biggie).     At the end of cooking I added two  tablespoons of sherry, again if you don't have no biggie but it does go really well with this soup.   Just a hint, if you use celery in anything use you peeler on it first, it helps to keep it from not to getting stringy.

Gives a good base so you can make it your own. So as a native of Southern Maryland I had to change it up a bit. I cut the water in half (or you wouldn't be able to find the crab meat). Added 2 cans of tomato soup, 3 diced white potatoes, 1/2 tsp sugar, salt and pepper, ground cayenne pepper, about a tbsp of Franks's hot sauce and more old bay (we like spicy). BTW next time I will go with the diced tomatoes since I cut the stewed in cubes.

I saulted the onions and substituted lima beans for green beans.  I used all the beef broth and just added a few more vegtables then specified to thicken the soup a little.  I used fresh carrots and onion and frozen green beans and corn.  I didn't measure anything.  My husband said it was the best thing I've made EVER!  I was shocked how well it turned out myself!  It only took 30 minutes to cook and tasted as good as a restraunt!!!  This recipe is a keeper:0)

Great recipe.  I took the advice of another reviewer and saute celery and onions in the bottom of the soup pot prior to adding the other ingredients.  I used frozen veggie mix that did not include lima beans.  I'm from MD and loved this recipe.

PERFECT!! Very authentic! Like other reviewers, I swapped the lima beans for cubed potatoes. Other than that, it's wonderful as-is. I look forward to making the soup again VERY soon!

Very delicious!  I used a carton of beef broth and decreased water to 2 1/2 C.  I added a potato and celery and used frozen vegetables for soup.  I put it in the crock pot for a few hours.  I decided to use the 2 Tbs of Old Bay so that way everyone could decide if they wanted more.

Pretty good. I let it cook in the crockpot for a long time (36 hours) to give it a less watery taste.

I really did not like this recipe at all.  It had very little flavor and I had to add so much more seasonings.  I will not make this again.

Wow, eating this soup made me feel like I was home again!  It was so good.  Just needed abit more old bay to spice it up, and I let it cook longer.  ok, so it's not quite what mom used to make but it was pretty close. I'll be making it again.

Easy and delicious.  This recipe makes restaurant quality Maryland Crab Soup.  I added green beans, potatoes, celery, and extra Old Bay because we like it chunky and spicy.

Very good recipe. As being raised on the Patuxent River, I thought it could of used a little more crab meat.  The taste was very good.

This recipe tastes similar to MD crab soup but was lacking a tad.  As other reviewers I added diced potatoes, zucchini, cut green beans and frozen peas to the existing veggies.  I also added more onion and old bay to help.

This is an excellent recipe.  I sauteed onion and green pepper in a little butter/magarine first then added the other ingredients.  I also used more seasonings for the flavor (garlic, oregano, bay leaves, creole seasoning, salt, pepper, and old bay).  About a tablespoon of worchester sauce and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar.  Yum Yum!

An outstanding recipe.  I added about a cup frozen, sliced okra in place of one of the small bags of frozen, mixed vegetables and used a container of fresh, pasturized lump crab meat from the fish counter. My husband is from Baltimore and very particular about his Maryland Crab Soup -- he proclaimed it "absolutely delicious!" Thank you for sharing the recipe!

As a Maryland native, I have to say this is the genuine article. Simple and easy to make, always a crowd favorite. I add just a few drops of hot sauce to kick it up a bit. GREAT RECIPE THANKS FOR SHARING.

I am also from Baltimore and this didn't cut it for me.  It was a good start. After I added 2 bay leaves, 1 more T of Old Bay, a little garlic, some red and black pepper, 1 T worchestershire, 1-2 T brown sugar, and a ton more veggies (potatoes, green beans, and peas), did it taste authentic to me.

I hate people who change recipes and then review, but I did make many changes based on other reviews. I used 2 cans of low-sodium beef broth as the base (and no water at all), added some shredded cabbage, 2 medium red potatoes (diced), celery, used only one can of stewed tomatoes and mashed them slightly, and one (14.5oz) can of crushed tomatoes. I added Worcestershire and brown sugar to taste. I used a small can of corn, small can of peas, and regular sized can of green beans (all drained - and low-sodium where I could find them). I REALLY wanted to try the soup, even though crabs are out of season. I used 8oz of Phillips claw meat and 8oz of Phillips 'special.' The soup was SUPERB and we'll be eating leftovers tonight. *****And yes, I live in Maryland.*****

Good, quick low calorie supper.  Would try adding a potato next time as suggested by others to make it a bit more filling.

My husband prefers this with a bit more liquid in it, so instead of 3 cups of water, we toss in the full gallon of water.  Sub in peas for lima beans and use 1.5 to 2 cups of each vegetable to bulk things up a little.  Other ingredients are multiplied by roughly a factor of 2, and we use the cheapest crab we can find (honestly, it doesn't make much difference in the soup, so why not go cheap?).  Wonderful soup, and easy enough that my husband can make it all by himself!

This is better than what many restaurants serve, and no worse than what a good restaurant serves. 

I ended up using a bag of frozen soup vegetables and that was fine. Left in the fresh onion, though, and put half the tomato in the blender before adding. 

What sealed the deal for me: my boyfriend loved it so much that he launched into a stream of expletives.

As a note, I am indeed in the Baltimore area; this is my first year here.

I just made this tonight and it was FANTASTIC!  I have been pining away for this soup for years, ever since I moved away from Delaware.  It's rarely featured on inland menus.  This was so easy and delicious, I can't believe I have never tried to make it before.  I made some variations and will post my version.

I've never had Maryland Crab Soup before, cripe i've haven't even been to Maryland. I did really like this soup and will make it again in the summer when I sub in some fresh sweet corn and some fresh pacific dungeness crab. I will likely cut a little Old Bay, and add additional beef broth as the broth was delish and a little heat for personal taste. I used canned crab (1.5 lbs and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly) as it was given to me. The whole pot consisting of 14 servings cost me only $ 2.66 to make, frugal indeed, as were the calories. Thanks for the post.

I'm from Maryland, and I like to think I have a pretty high standard for crab soup. This was the first time I've ever made crab soup on my own, and this recipe gave me the basics, and I made my own adjustments. The result was an amazing soup. My adjustments were: 1. In addition to the 1 lb crab meat I also used a container of claw meat 2. I used frozen soup veggies to cut down on time 3. I used 3 plus tablespoons of old bay PLUS crushed red peppers for extra spicy soup  I'll definitely use this recipe again, but with my adjustments.

Lots of flavor in this one. I was not sure about this recipe once I read the ingredients, then as I was putting it in the pot I thought "this is gonna taste nasty" but being a cajun we'll eat just about anything. Surprise! It was very very good. Loaded with flavor.

Absolutly delicious. Used lots of crab and old bay seasoning for an extra kick. Frozen veggies also worked great. Easy to make and tastes great!!

This just didn't have enough flavor. I should have tasted it before serving so I could have added more spices.

I'm part of a Notre Dame club and our trip this past year was to see them play Navy at Baltimore, MD.  I made this recipe for our tailgate party and it was the hit of the day. I changed the amount cooking for to 30 servings and instead of 3 lbs of crab I used 4 lbs.  Almost everyobdy that tried it said that it was the best MD crab soup they've have.  We're from near the Philly area so most people have tried this type of recipe.  I think it will be made for our superbowl party...

This was my first attempt at making soup and it was winner!  I used the frozen veggies instead and it worked out perfect, and it was much easier. I also used crabs that I picked, including the seasoning & 'mustard'.  I left the Old Bay on the claws too.  I made cheddar garlic biscuits from this site, oh and it was even better the second day!  I even froze some for when I need a fix later in the season :)

Wow!  Super good.  I've made versions of this in the past, but this was the best.  I added some haddock and potatos in addition to the regular recipe, becuase we like a meal-like soup.  We ate the whole pot in one day! mmmm.

This is a great recipe.   The only changes I made were to add green beans to the list of veggies. I used a bag of Bird's Eye frozen veggies.  I added crab meat from our leftover steamed crabs (I live 5 min from Maryland).   Since I had claws from our crabs that were already coated in seasoning, I threw those in to the soup while it was simmering.  I simmered the soup for 2 hours, pulled out the claws and extracted the meat and tossed that into the soup.  Delicious!   Will be even better tomorrow.

This is a very good and authentic recipe, as is for sure. I tend to adjust things to personal taste, and like to use as many on-hand ingredients as possible, so I used more Old Bay seasoning and flageolet beans instead of the limas (flageolet beans are also light green, but shaped more like cannellini, have characteristics of both lima and cannellini about them). I also used organic bone broth (chicken) instead of water, for more protein and a little added flavor. It was great.

I think adding crabs in shell to the process (as suggested as optional) would add a good dimension to the soup, but didn't have the full crab (I used 1 lb of lump crab meat from Costco).

I’m also from Maryland had love this soup! I simply wasn’t getting enough of this soup in restaurants to satisfy my craving. So I found this terrific basic recipe that with a few adjustments coming from others who have made this it is fantastic! My adjustment are sautéing 1 garlic clove and 1/2 a small onion in butter using the same pot I cook the soup in as well as adding 4 tbsp brown sugar and 1 extra tbsp Old Bay (total of 3). I wait 1 day or overnight before eating because the flavors really develop. I make this weekly and I still want more!!

I made a few changes such as using frozen veggies instead of canned (just because I had them already) and adding the Worcestershire sauce  (because that sounded yummy) and by mistake I only used diced tomatoes.  At first I did find it too salty so I added another potato and two cups of water and that took care of it.  Next time I will look for a lower sodium broth and start with 1 tbsp of  Old Bay and increase it accordingly.  Everyone loved it!  I can't wait to make it this summer with fresh caught crab.

I'm not from Maryland but my in-laws are and they loved this soup.  I thought the spices were spot on myself.  Next time I will probably add a bit more veggies and possibly potatoes to make it a bit thicker but it is very good just the way it is.

After reading the recipe this is not Maryland Crab Soup.  Just because you put crab into a glorified vegetable soup does not make it so.  You need to develop depth of flavor.  I use ham shanks, bacon, shredded cabbage and some barley along with the old bay and other veggies.  Takes about 3 hours for it to come together.  Sorry, this isn't Maryland Crab Soup.

I grew up on the Chesapeake Bay ( (Kent Island). I moved to Florida and have been  and have been yearning for crabs for 18 months. I decided to make crab soup. I know how to make it, and have read many of these recipes out of curiosity.  They are close, but quite correct. Here is my  home town ( Kent Island), surrounded by the Chesapeak Bay, and Kent Narrows. We get crabs fresh off the boat. I've adapted this recipe, due to living in Florida. However, when I make this it brings me home.

I’ve used this recipe many different ways.  I prefer using a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and using a frozen veg blend (corn, carrots, Lima’s, green beans)  added toward the end.   Also,taste your broth and adjust seasonings as needed.  Although crazy for a true Marylander, I found a bit of brown sugar balanced the acidity of the tomatoes.

Lifelong Marylander, first time making Maryland crab soup.  This recipe is excellent!  First time I followed exactly, except I did not use the optional claws.  Second time I increased the Old Bay by 50 percent to give it a little more kick.  I may add some green beans, potatoes, peas and/or celery in the future, but this is a great representation of true Maryland crab soup, and its one of the easiest recipes I've ever used.  Thanks!

This is a great basic crab soup recipe.  We made a few changes.  We had no crab claws, so used only the crabmeat.  We also had no lima beans, so we subbed green beans and peas.  We added some thinly sliced celery, two bay leaves, and a half teaspoon of crushed thyme leaves.  The heat level provided by the 1 T of Old Bay was fine for us, but some might like a little more.  This soup was even better the next day.

A simple and delicious recipe.  Can be made with mostly packaged ingredients (i.e. frozen Birdseye veggies and etc.).  Takes very little effort to yield a pleasing and authentic Maryland crab soup.

Instead of the beef broth, I was fortunate to have a dozen or so left over crabs whom I lazily cleaned, and threw the rest in pots and simmered it for many hours. Then I followed your recipe, included potatoes, frozen limas, 2 ears of fresh corn (it is summertime), and crushed tomatoes (hubby doesn't like tomato chunks.) I live in Ocean City, MD and served it at a pool party, everyone said it is the best crab soup they have ever had. Thank you.

Followed DebbieSD and added potato, worcestershire and brown sugar. Excellent. Will top with sherry.
In Maryland one of my husband's favorite ways to eat this is half cream of crab, half MD crab. Am making the other now!

Used caned crab claw meat, beef stock, pink sea salt, pepper, and no water. I also used to bags of frozen soup mix (carrots, green beans, peas, and corn). The old bay really adds great flavor. So easy quick, and low calorie.

The only thing I did to alter the taste was to add cayenne pepper. (But we like spicy) I also added celery, and next time we will replace Lima beans with peas. Don't be afraid to add veggies! This recipe is SO easy and SO delicious!!! Highly recommend!!!

TRY  IT SLOW COOKED, I have an older model Cuisinart slow cooker with a "simmer setting" (in between low and warm). Mixed all ingredients in and set to simmer for 12 hrs. Extremely well blended and delicious! I am guessing similar results with a low setting for shorter amount of time.

Added about a cup of cabbage and another tablespoon of old bay (3 total).  Also used Birds Eye mixed vegetables with no Linda beans.  It tasted great and I am from PA.  Authentic and delicious.  Used pasteurized crab meat, mix of claws and body meat and it was great.

I made this yesterday and added celery, potatoes, more onions and more Old Bay.  I let it simmer for a couple hours to soften the carrots and celery and 10 minutes before dinner I dumped in the crab. Yummy.

Tried it for the first time last night. Made my own modifications. Used the suggestions from others- used 1tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar- although I think it would've been fine with 2tbsp (mine came out a little too sweet), added cubed red potatoes, 1teaspoon of sriracha, and celery. Next day tasted much better.  Forgot the bay leaf next time I'll use that and crushed tomatoes instead.

This is a great base recipe. I did what others suggested by adding 1 tbsp of worchestire sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3 tbsp of old bay. However, I ranked it as 4 stars because it seems like it's lacking something and I can't figure out. Very tasty nonetheless!! Will make again.

I was not impressed by this at all. I followed the recipe and I thought it was bland. I added a splash of cayenne pepper and that helped a little. I feel this was a waste of crab meat. Perhaps with some experimenting it could work.

I too am from Maryland, and had leftover crabs to make soup with.  I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies, 3 c of beef broth -- and the leftover claws from yesterday's steamed crabs.  Fantastic!

I thought this was okay... I did use canned crab (Phillips), so I am sure it would have tasted better with fresh.  It was a bit fishy and a little blah... I added a little cayenne after I tasted it, as I thought it needed a kick.

This recipe is close but needs a little help.  I cubed up some beef to add to the soup and instead of adding the vegetables recomended I used frozen soup mix of vegetables.  That gives you the okra, corn, green beans which are more traditional of maryland crab soup.

This was just okay.  I want something with a stronger tomato base.  This is more like vegetable soup with crab.

Very tasty soup. I'm from Maryland and wanted a taste of home and this really was delicious. I added some green beans and pepper and didn't have any blue crab available to me but the crab i used still came out tasty.

I made this after coming back from a long weekend in Ocean City where we ate crab soup every day.  It was delicious!  I added some mushrooms and black olives for grins.  This one would be great for our next crab feast.

This is a very good healthy soup.
I added 1 bottle of chili sauce for extra kick along with the old bay. 
I think you can add any veggies you have on hand. Thanks!

This soup was so good that this is my first time rating ANY recipe. It was the best. I took some of everyones advice...I added small diced potatos, canned diced tomatos, some zuchinni, and frozen veg's. Lots of old bay, used low sodium beef broth, and it was the easiest, greatest md crab soup. You can just throw in what ever you have handy around the house. Good Eatings!

I am from Maryland and I have to say this is a great recipe. I omitted the crab claws and added diced potatoes as suggested by other reviewers. I also chopped up the stewed tomatoes to get them more dispersed throughout the soup. Sometimes I substitute green beans for the lima beans, depending on the crowd. The overall flavor was excellent- use more or less Old Bay to taste.

Having never had "the real thing" before, I can't judge whether the flavor of the soup was authentic.  It was a bit too spicy for my taste (that was my first time using "Old Bay").  It was quite easy to make (I didn't do the crab claws)and I like the fact that it included lots of veggies.
