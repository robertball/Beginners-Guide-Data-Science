Very good. Used "lite" soy sauce. Chicken stock in place of water and slightly less sugar which made it sweet enough.Everything else followed exact. Use 1/3 CAN of tomato soup and divide the rest into two labeled ziplock bags and freeze for the next time...no point in wasting it and all you'll have to do the next time is throw the frozen "chunk" of soup in when it's time. Will definitely make this again.

My family and I enjoyed this a lot. Thankfully, I read the reviews before I made it, so I was able to make the modifications that I felt were appropriate. I added 2 tbsps. of ginger to the marinade. I also used equal parts sugar and vinegar, and added all the juice from a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks. (I only used half the can of pineapples, though. The rest are sitting in the fridge for a healthy midnight snack later.) I completely omitted the tomato soup and carrots as my family is not a fan of either ingredient. Next time I make it (and there will DFEINITELY be a next time) I am going to dredge the chicken pieces, and add the bell pepper with the chicken and pineapples. I love when the recipes I find here actually work!!

I didn't try it because I'm vegetarian haha but my family and guests gave it rave reviews!! I used fresh pineapple and the juice from 1/2 a large orange instead of pineapple juice.

I have made this 4 times before, 3 time with chicken thighs bl/sl
and once with pork it turn out great each time. I must admit that I subbed 1/3 Ketchup in place of tomato soup and cut back on the to a 1/4 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup of 0 calorie sweetner. I will keep on making this Dish!! Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I'm so sorry, but we didn't enjoy this recipe at all. I think it was the tomato soup that killed it.

It didn't taste like restaurant quality, but it was a good dinner.

I never have tomato soup so substituted that for tomato sauce (ketchup), and when I make this again (which I definitely will) I wont marinate the chicken in the soy sauce.  It tasted like fish to me, which was odd, and unnerving.  Lol.  Other than that it was a fab recipe and the whole family wolfed it down.  Even my semi-fussy 5 & 6 year olds.  It's a perfect serving size for 4 adults.

I used leftover pork roast, and did not marinate at all. I just added soy sauce to taste in the pan after all ingredients were together.  No carrots, but did add some leftover stir-fry veggies, mushrooms, and  the pepper.  I did not add any tomato anything (didn't have on hand.) I would have used less sugar next time. I really liked this recipe a lot, and will definitely make it (sort of, as I do) again.

cooked the chicken with sesame oil instead of canola & used flour instead of cornstarch (didn't have any).  Yum!

I used a gourmet pomegranate flavored vinegar.  It turned it a dark color but it was delicious!

I liked this one but it was way too sweet. I made it as the recipe call for but next time I think I will but half the sugar.

This recipe was fine.  It wasn't outstanding, it wasn't bad, it was pretty...fine.
