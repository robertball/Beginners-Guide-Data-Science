I'm sure this is good, it should be. Let's see...9 inch pan, 8 servings; 1 piece, (that is pretty small) and a whopping 600 calories and 30 grams of fat!!  No thanks. I am so glad Allrecipes supplies the Nutritional Information.

Very Good. Used apples from our tree. Only change I made was adding a 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Served warm with whipped cream. Will make again.

Very good.  Really sweet.  Due to high sugar/fat content I recommend using low fat condensed milk and margarine instead of butter.  But I made it as it and it was really good.  Just heat the left overs up in the microwave for a fresh baked feel.  My husband even liked this and he doesn't like anything 'mushy'

I made this in 8" round pans and it turned out great. It was a hit at work and was pretty simple to put together (once I got all those apples peeled!) I also made this recipe with a tad more dry ingredients as a birthday cake for a friend which turned out perfect in a cheesecake tin

This sounds excellent and easy!  The fat can easily be reduced by using a low fat butter spread (i.e. Smart Balance).

I didn't have biscuit baking mix. For the topping, I just used plain flour. In the apple mixture I used 1 cup flour + 1 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp salt. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg in the apple mixture (I really like nutmeg) and for used pecans for the nuts in the topping. I suspect the topping tasted better with the plain flour than it would have with the mix.
