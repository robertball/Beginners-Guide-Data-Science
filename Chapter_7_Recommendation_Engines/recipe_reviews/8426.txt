This was really good cake! I added an extra square of chocolate just because I really like chocolate. And I used Unsweetened instead of Semi Sweet just beauce it's all I had. It turned out really wll though because I prefer a bittersweet dark chocolate cake to an overly sweet one. I also added some vnilla. Great recipe I will be making it again!

Made this for my son's birthday - was pretty dry. I followed the the recipe pretty closely it didn't have quite enough chocolate flavor. I've made other better chocolate cakes...
