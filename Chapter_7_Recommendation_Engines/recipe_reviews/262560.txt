This is a great, easy, Indian dish. The spices make it full of flavor and it only took 10 minutes for my instant Pot to naturally release the pressure, so doesnâ€™t take too long. We served it over veggie rice to reduce the carbs. Even the kids gave it a thumbs up.

My Favourite at the moment. The cooking times seem a bit long, but creates a great curry, to go with rice and some plain yogurt. quick and simple but authentic tastes!
