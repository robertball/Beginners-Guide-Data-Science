A good recipe, but, while I like cranberries, I prefer them as a background flavor instead of being the star in a rice dish. The caramelized onions were a great addition to the rice! I will make this recipe again, but use 1/2 cup or less of cranberries instead. Also, I used no salt other than what was in the butter and the rice still tasted great-a nice healthy recipe!

Very good! Everything ties together quite well. Next time I will definitely use less butter. Otherwise it's a great dish.

This was a great recipe! A very nice combination of sweet and tart that I enjoyed eating for days afterward.

I love this recipe.  I did all wild rice - instead of halving it - and I chopped my one onion - not 3 as stated.  I also skipped the orange zest.  I might cut back on the butter in the rice next time - the package said to cook it with a T of butter....but I thought it was a little too buttery.  But otherwise delish...and I think I will cut my onions bigger next time as stated in this recipe because they do get pretty small.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I now officially love wild rice!

This was an all right dish.  I don't think I will make it again though.

Very good recipe.  I used a beef bouillon cube instead of the chicken broth and it turned out excellent.  We ate this with fried fish and plantains.

Very good dish. Much enjoyed for Thanksgiving by all and will be a returning Holiday dish for years to come.  I quadrupled the recipe for 15 people and used four large yellow onions.  I also added a touch of salt since I used lower sodium broth.  The wild rice for four recipes was about $10, but well worth it.

I made this dish this morning for a ladies lunch.  I needed a quick side and had all ingredients on hand.  I followed the directions exactly, but wasn't too pleased with the results.  I actually didn't even serve it and I threw it out.  I think the onions were just overwhelming or something.  The ingredients didn't really complement each other.  Not a success for me, though other reviewers seemed to have liked it.

We didn't have brown rice so I used white rice . The cranberries were frozen not dried and I used shallots insread of onoins and orange juice instead of orange zest . It was a disaster and turned out as mush . The duck (mallard) was fanatastic .

We enjoyed this quite a bit this morning.  I served it with fish and think it would go much better with poultry.  Might add some pine nuts next time.

I have made this several times and my wife really likes it. I typicallly serve with a glazed salmon - tonight it is Blueberry glazed salmon. Substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth and lemon zest for orange zest. Also use a wild rice mix from bulk bins at the market. Can't miss recipe.
