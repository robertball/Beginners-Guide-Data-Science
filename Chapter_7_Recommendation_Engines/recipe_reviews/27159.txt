There is one ingredient missing on this recipe. Add 1 stick of cinnamon to the water when cooking the plantains (remove the stick before mashing them). Do the same with the black beans. This is the original Guatemalan recipe.  Some people also like to add a square of "cinnamon chocolate" which you can get at Mexican or Central American stores.

I grew up on platanos (plantains) and they are great! For a simpler treat, peel, slice up, and fry them in a bit of oil. The trick is to first let them ripen until the SKINS's all black and getting moldy. Yes, it sounds gross, but this lets the starches break down & makes the plaintains extra sweet! They're perfect with just some black beans and sour cream, but throw in some fried eggs and it's the best breakfast ever!

My mother-in-law made these for me when she was visiting from Guatemala and I have made them a few times. I omit the salt. My family loves them.

I love this recipe!  I taught a Spanish class this summer and for our last class we all brought food, the only rule was that it had to be Latin.  So I went on a search for something out of the ordinary and found this.  Everyone loved it!  I was surprised at how easy it was to work with the mashed plantain, I thought it would be too sticky but it wasn't.  I didn't have any refried black beans so I used a can of black beans, drained most of the liquid and mashed them.  Instead of sour cream I used "media crema" (table cream) that you can find in the Mexican aisle of most major grocery stores.  I used platanos maduros and didn't try the cinnamon as another reviewer suggested but I might next time.  I will definitely make this again.  Â¡Gracias por compartir esta receta tan buena!

For this recipe you MUST use ripened plantains, with green plantains it will taste completely different. It won't necessarily be bad but it is a totally different dish altogether because plantains change in texture and flavor when they ripen.

If you use green, these will be more like a potato dumpling filled with beans and will favor a savory taste.

If you use ripe plantains these will be softer and have a sweet taste, similar to a sweet potato fritter (slightly sweeter depending on the ripeness level of the plantains). 

I am using the potato/sweet potato analogy to give you an idea of the sweetness, not because the taste is the same.

I gave it 5 stars because it's sure to taste good.  But what's missing from the recipe is whether one should use platanos maduros or platanos verdes.

I am Guatemalan born in the US and I've always had these. This is as close as you're going to get to the ones in El mercado central! couple of suggestions: Boil the plantains with a stick of cinnamon and use very rippened plantains. Greasy black peel almost moldy works best. It's easier to work with and is way sweeter.

I tried this recipe for an Xmas party. It went over great for those who weren't afraid to try it. I served it as an appetizer and it was yummy and not at all sweet. Use an electric mixer for mashing the bannanas and that will speed things up a bit in the preparation time.

I made this and they were so good. I took some to a friend of mine at work and she wants to make them too. This was the first time I cooked plantains but it won't be the last. The recipe was very easy to do. Thanks! It's a Keeper!

To add to authentic taste: As the previous reviewer suggested, add a stick or two of cinnamon when boiling the plantains. For a sweeter taste (or to make it more likely that ninos will eat them), when you mash the plantains, add a bit of sugar. I also make salted cinnamon fudge to put inside. If you want it purely as dessert, you can even use cinnamon fudge in place of the beans; but to keep it authentic keep the beans, too.

These were okay.  I really thought that they needed something more.  I think next time I'll add a little salt to the plantains.  Also, I used powdered sugar but I think they would really be better with sour cream as suggested.  They might benefit from being fried in coconut oil as well.  Thanks!

I liked these fine though they were a little difficult to handle. Not sure I'd make them again. Boyfriend didn't like
