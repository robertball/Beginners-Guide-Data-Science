This may be common canning knowledge...but I didn't know this: Be sure to pack the asparagus tightly in the jars. If you don't, you run the risk of the asparagus overcooking during the 10-minute processing time.

I added a crushed garlic clove to the bottom of each jar. Otherwise, no changes to the recipe. The pickling juice had a great flavor!

Mom wanted some pickled asparagus. I could not find what she wanted at the store, but the asparagus was on sale.  Never canned a thing in my life but these turned out GREAT.  Mom loved them.
My Mom turned 92 this year and if she wants something I try to get it for her.
The whole family loved them. Very easy to do.

I've been making these for years, ever since we had them as a garnish in a Bloody Mary drink in Hawaii.  Do pick smallest diameter spears you can find.  I also put several crushed cloves of garlic and more red pepper flakes in the bottom of the jars.  Makes a wonderful item to tuck into a gift basket, or to give away at the holidays, long after asparagus season is gone.

I barely followed this recipe at all as I wanted spicy spears for bloody mary's and I know that the sugar takes the bite out of the vinegar.  I will say that the asparagus prep directions were spot on.  I also added smashed garlic cloves to each jar and a sliced red jalapeno and omitted the mustard and dill seed.  I doubled the fresh dill.  So, after a lot of adjustments I loved it.

Didn't use dill seed and accidentally added crushed red peppers to the boiling liquid and not to each jar.  These had a very nice mix of sweet and tart.  Next time I'll use larger jars, add more onion, a couple slivers of garlic and I think red bell pepper would be a nice addition.

After reading everyone's reviews, I rolled up my sleeves and gave it a shot.  i did not use any sugar. I wanted that vinegary, spicy bite without being too hot. It was my first time canning and they turned out beautifully.  I put two sprigs of dill in each jar along with a clove of minced garlic, the mustard seed and red pepper flakes.  I sterilized the jars in the dishwasher and  pulled the jars out while they were still warm to fill them with the speers and brine to reduce chance of breakage. Every two bunches of asparagus makes 3 jars. The most exciting part is when the jars begn to seal as they cool off. Success!

This is good, although next time i will add less sugar.  I was going more of a "bloody mary" type asparagus that is a little hotter, and less sweet.

turned out great. I had 5 lbs of asparagus from the farmer's market and no idea what to do with any of it. I pickled half (the skinnier ones) using this recipe. I used fresh dill from teh garden in place of dill seed and I also doubled the recipe. So good! Especially in out bloody mary's.

This was my first time pickling and it was kind of a scary experience! The asparagus turned out a lot better than ibthought they would, bubthe picle was sweet, which I don't care for. Will be looking for dill only pickles. Dilly beans are next on my list!

Canning cautions: 1)Adjust processing time according to altitude, higher altitude needs more time. 2)Do not touch the dimple on the lid. If it does not vaccuum down on its own, then it did not seal correctly. You can re-process; first remove the lid, clean the lip of the jar and use a new clean lid.

Do not make the mistake I did. Multiply all ingredients by 10 and do your thing. I cut back on the sugar to 1/3 cup per batch. Got tired of making this 4 times !!!! Next year will start ot with 15 - 20 lbs of asparagus to start !

I like the flavor of these but they are too sweet.   I didn't can these and attempted to use a ziploc bag, and serve 24 hours later. It didn't work. Would've if I blanched them first. Lack of the water bath didn't allow them to soften. After making both this recipe and Pickled Asparagus II, I like the pickled Asparagus II better. Not as sweet as this one. I like the onion though

Very delicious and simple! I didn't use the mustard seed or dill seed being I did not have any here at home. Instead, I used dried dill and fresh garlic. I also packed the onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, and dill at the bottom of the jar before I packed in the asparagus. It turned out great! Thanks for sharing the steps on how to make this, I will be making it again!

Very versatile recipe! I followed directions except for the sugar, which I cut in half and didn't really taste in the final product. I had just a bunch of skinny asparagus and found that the asparagus and half an onion, sliced, fit into a quart jar snugly. The liquid was barely enough. I poured the boiling vinegar over the drained asparagus in the jar and, after cooling it, stuck it into the refrigerator. A few hours later it was delicious and VERY crisp...suitable for drink garnish or (as we used it) a combo with pickled eggs as an appetizer.

It's best to cut your asparagus to the length of your jars.  Also, I halved the sugar and made extra brine; the recipe doesn't make quite enough brine to fill all the jars unless you make another cup.

I strained the onions out of the brine and them pressure canned them--there is about 2 cups.  Very tasty condiment.

I followed this recipe exactly but my asparagus ended up wrinkled and much smaller than when I put them in the jars. They're still cooling so don't know about taste, but very disappointed.  What happened?

If I make this again I will definitely use less sugar. I wasn't a fan of how sweet they turned out. The spice level is still really good.

I modified for quart jars and added jalapeno slices.   Also cut the sugar in half.    I did not process in water bath and refrigerated instead.   Fantastic.   Will make again.

This is the BEST recipe ever!!!
I can't wait until asparagus is affordable again.  I will buy 2 cases next time to pickle.
We eat a couple of these every night on our tomato and avocado plate.
We love them!!!
Tastes more like a bread and butter pickle than your traditional brine.

I made these this evening.  I thought it was a sharing project, but time was running out for the fresh asparagus, so here I am.  I used to pickle a lot in the late summer in days gone by.  I knew I wanted a little white onion in each little jar, and mustard seed and both dill weed and seed be cause fresh are out of season.  I put the spices in the individual jars.  I didn't use sugar.  I don't remember the pickling liquid to be straight white vinegar, but so it is.One of the jars did not seal and I was too tired to reprocess KT.  Three days later we tried it and it is perfect!??

Great recipe and super easy!  I accidentally used extra strength vinegar and though I didn't love it my extended family did!  Next time I'm going to try a batch with regular vinegar and add some sliced garlic.

LOVED this recipe! I made it how they called for the first time and decided to make a few tweaks. I thought the originally was too sweet and not spicy enough, and I wasn't crazy about the pickled onion in there. So I cut the sugar in half, doubled the chili flakes, and left out the onion, but put in some garlic cloves instead - and it was OUTSTANDING! I made and gifted a bunch of these for xmas last year and they were a huge hit!! I have friends that regularly ask me to make these for them! I will sit down and eat an entire jar in 1 sitting!!

Second time I've used this recipe. I use farm fresh asparagus but both times the stocks shriveled in the jar, almost like they are over cooked. Next time I try this I'm going to cut the processing time in half and see what that does. Looks aside,  I love the taste of these asparagus.

I loved the flavor!  I will have to play with the recipe a little more next time.  I noticed (after the fact) that one reviewer said to pack the asparagus tightly, which I did not, and it was a bit limp.  I will try it again for sure.

I cut the sugar in half because it was too sweet for me and added a bit more crushed red pepper. But this is a great recipe! I originally made them for a garnish but now I make them semi-frequents and eat them by the jar! So good!

Followed the recipe with 2 changes. I added 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar and cut back on the sugar a bit. Turned out great!

I love these. If you are unsure about the amount of an ingrediient such as the sugar use a less amount, taste your brine and add more if needed before you pour it over your veggies.

I cut them longer and used a tall mason jar so I wouldn't waste as much or the asparagus. Works but remember to double the pickling liquid.  We will see how tasty this fall.

I don't know if it was me, or the recipe instructions, but I ran out of liquid bout the first  jar.  They are good to taste and pretty to eat.

I tried this recipe today.  It was so easy to follow and I enjoyed canning the asparagus.  I can't wait to get more asparagus so I can get more jars filled up.  Thanks for the recipe.
