This is traditionally a family favorite at our house. Even though I have never seen a recipe in print call for it, I was raised to always put one teaspoon of cinnamon into the flour mixture before blending. That is was gives it that Tex/Mex zing.

With last minute plans for a total of 7 coming to dinner, I had about 90 minutes to make a dessert large enough (and good enough) for all.  Made this cake, but didn't have a jelly roll pan or any sour cream. SO...I used a large glass baking pan (approx. 10x15x2) and susbstituted 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt plus one egg yolk for the sour cream. I also used butter instead of margarine. Cooked it for about 25 to 30 minutes, until toothpick in the center came out clean. I was afraid to spread the frosting on the hot cake but it was very easy and didn't rip the cake.  This was BEYOND a hit with 4 teenagers, and the adults raved about how the icing "melting" into the top of the cake made it incredibly moist. Definitely a keeper for my chocolate craving dessert nights!

This is so similar to my grandmother’s recipe I remember as a kid in Texas.  She kept it in the refrigerator and it is wonderful in the summer. The family loved it!

I added extra cocoa as others did as I too like more chocolate.  Only issue was when pouring the glaze over the cake; it ran off the edges.  The pan I used was 1/2" deep.  Recommend a deeper pan so you can have a thicker layer of frosting.  In the future, would also include chopped nuts in the batter before baking.

I added 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon to cake with dry ingredients and  1 cup chopped nuts to icing before spreading over cake.  Adding these ingredients made it more like the cake I use to make and it is always a big hit .  I line my jellyroll pan with parchment paper which makes clean up easier and I cut with a pizza cutter .  Very moist.

Made this for my wife to take to work , as nurses they sometimes need that little extra boost. Once a week there is a meal brought in from each nurse in her dept. So I made this and it was a hit, along with another request from her co-workers.

Very good. I was worried because the batter was so watery and the cook time needed to be doubled. But in the end, it was delicious. I did not make the frosting but instead sprinkled powdered sugar on top.

Used this cake for a Halloween themed cake.  It was a nice dense chocolate cake.  Family liked it especially with the decorations “borrowed” by the dirt cake recipe.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten!

I followed the recipe exactly with only  the following adaptations:
1.  Used a 9 X !3 glass pan instead of a jelly roll pan (I wanted a thicker cake)
2. Used butter instead of margarine for both the cake and the frosting
3. Used Hershey's 100% Cacao "Special Dark" cocoa
4.  Added 1/4 tsp. dry instant  espresso to cake with cocoa, and 1/8 tsp. dry espresso to frosting with cocoa.

Baked until toothpick came out clean, about 25 minutes at 375 degrees F.

This is a great recipe my family has made this cake for years for every event birthday holiday imaginable. I have lost my recipe so I was so happy to find this one. I followed the recipe exactly except when I got to the part to add the powdered sugar I searched frantically and did not have any so I substituted with brown sugar. I was so upset I thought for sure this would not turn out but it came out OK not my best and no fault of this recipe I’m sure it would’ve been perfect but I had the correct sugar:

I liked this cake, but didn't love it. This cake was fairly crumbly (but still really yummy). Maybe it also has to do with the fact that I live in a high-altitude area? I don't know, but unfortunately this recipe isn't a keeper for me. Sorry about that

This was delicious and so easy!  It's very moist and full of chocolaty goodness!  The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
