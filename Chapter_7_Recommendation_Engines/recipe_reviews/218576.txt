I made this when it was first shared and have made it several times since.  I have found that for us, I use all whole wheat pastry flour and skip the AP, so I add an additional 1/4 cup of plain FF yogurt.  I have no idea how well this keeps because it disappears as soon as I serve it.  Oh, the last time I made it I had peaches left over so I diced them and spread them over the batter before I added the topping.  Thanks Anne, this is a winner!

Made Avon's recipe before AR published it. I used what I had in the house, Aunt Jemima Lite Syrup and Light Fat Free Peach Yogurt. The steel cut oatmeal soaked for 30 minutes by the time I got myself organized. Great recipe Avon, glad it finally got published.

made this yesterday, had company for supper so I wowed them-somthing new was needed. No pressure put on Avon at all. I whipped this together, the smell as it baked was heavenly. I had the windows open and everyone entered the house asking "what smells soooo good?" The peach cake was fabulous, served it with ice cream. So good! Great texture and with the steal cut oats and WW flour, it felt healthy to me:) Great recipe, Avon. Original review, August 2010

Avon, this is a wonderful way to start a day! It isn't a Sunday, but Friday worked for us! I made it according to the recipe except I had to use slivered almonds because I ran out of pecans. I was a little worried because my fruit could have been a little riper, but it turned out just delicious! Thank you, sweet Avon!

AVON! THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS DIVINE  DISH!  Please forgive me.:):)  I would give it 10 stars but alas, I made some changes. That's the Only reason I knocked off 1 star. I was out of brown sugar so I used Piloncillo cones, raw sugar, instead. ( This is found in the Mexican markets and looks like brown cones, hence the name) I added a squirt of maple syrup. I chopped up about 1 tbs of crystallized ginger. There was  apples and nectarines in the fridge, chopped and tossed those in too. I had no yogurt so I mixed some apple cider vinegar and milk to make buttermilk. This created a nice tang to the cake. I was taking this to school so no nuts, you never know. Baked it in a bunt pan and brushed the whole thing with Grand Marne. I mixed up some SF vanilla pudding to top the cake, a few sprinkles and the Lunch ladies didn't stand a chance!  Nice and spicy. Perfect way to start off the school year! This ROCKS ANNIE! Thanks again:):)

Avon, this recipe is perfection. Light, flavorful, moist, and has lots of added nutrition (I love the interest and light crunch the steel cut oats add). I'm impressed. I only just found your recipe today and it's right up my alley, so I wasted no time in getting into the kitchen with it. I remembered too late that I didn't have my small baking pan, so made it into muffins instead. It filled 13 cups perfectly, and I baked them at the suggested temperature for 25 minutes. I thought I had better halve the crumb topping for the muffins, but it's so good, I will be sure to make it a cake next time to enjoy fully that wonderful topping. Thanks so much for developing and sharing this recipe. Just be sure and let me know about the next one, please!

Excellent recipe. I made muffins instead of a cake and it only took 35 minutes at the same temp.  I didn't have quite enough melted butter so I added canola oil to make up the rest of the 1/4 cup called for.  I added an additional ripe banana and also substituted store bought vanilla whipped frosting since it was in my cupboard.  A slice of fresh peach on each one made it even more delicious!

I made this just as the recipe said and my husband and I found it a bit dry, and very heavy. It lacked peach flavour, but we did like the idea of the steel cut oats in the cake. I won't make this again.

This recipe was amazing! I used molasses instead of syrup and went with the muffins! The smell and taste was incredible! The recipe was easy to follow and easy to make. I also used instant oatmeal and let it sit for a few minutes to soak up. Thank you for this recipe!! Yum!

Recipe Group Selection:  06, September 2014 ~ I made this as listed, although I realized when it was in the oven I forgot the pecans.  I baked it in a 10" deep dish pie pan rather than a 9x9 pan.  I like the looks for serving triangle pieces rather than square pieces.  I really enjoyed it, and DH & DS liked it, but thought it was a little heavy.  This was my first time for using steel cut oats, and I liked them.  Thanks, Avon for creating this recipe.

What a wonderful cake! So wonderfully moist and fluffy. I used ground almonds instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand. So I used a little almond extract in the cake as well, delish! And I added an extra peach. After three days, it was still wonderfully moist and fluffy, and even tasted better the next day! I think if anyone's cake turned out dry they must have over baked it.

For Recipe Group: I used vanilla non fat Greek yogurt, because I had some that desperately needed used up! I also used white whole wheat in place of the all purpose and whole wheat flours. Love the crumb topping - and may double it next time, putting half in the middle of the cake. Thank you, Avon!

These were delicious.  I did make one major mistake though, which I caution others against: Don't use canned peaches.  My grocery store didn't have any fresh ones that were ripe, so I used the canned peaches.  The result was that these never cooked properly.  They were still great, though.  I'll make them again in peach season.

Delicious! My peaches were not at their peak, so I was concerned how this recipe might come out.  It wasn't a problem.  I made it into cupcakes, and they turned out great...tender and flavorful.  We will make this recipe again.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Loved this and like others would’ve given 5 stars but I added a couple things.   Made as recipe but added about 1/4 chopped strawberries to make the one cup of peaches, which were thawed from frozen slices, I was a little short the whole cup and thought the strawberries would add a little more sweetness since my peaches didn’t seem overly sweet.  I also added about a t. Vanilla and a couple splashes of buttermilk because I had some wanted to help make sure it wouldn’t be dry.  I made the banana mixture and let it sit closer to 40 minutes to make sure oats were soft.  I also only used the whole wheat flour in the initial batter for the topping I used AP.

I REALLY wanted  to like this.  What could be better than fresh peaches in a bread moistened by syrup, yogurt, and banana?  Sadly, it didn’t taste very “peachy” at all (could’ve told my kids it was apple and they would have believed it), and the preponderance of whole wheat flour made it taste very....whole wheatish.  Would prefer something more peachy, less “healthful”.  Can’t say it was dry, but can’t say that it was overly tasty either.

Highly rate this cake - I used ground flax, almonds and pistachios in the crumb topping just to get some extra goodness in !!

I made this exactly per the recipe.  They were okay right out of the oven, but became very dry and heavy soon after.  I won't make them again.
