I followed the recipe exactly.  This bread makes wonderful toast. I looked twice at the recipe with no sugar, eggs, or oil ( with the exception for the pan and the top after baking).  I am going to try it with blueberries and other dried fruits.

Good bread I personally did a brown sugar toasted pecan's and used chopped walnuts as well. Then finished it off with a slight brown sugar glaze on the top.

Awesome flavor, easy, and very forgiving process. I accidentally mixed in the starter to begin with, and I had to let it rise overnight in the fridge, but it turned out fantastic. Next time I think I'll try it with whole wheat instead of AP flour for extra hearty flavor and texture.

It had good flavor, but I think I should have let it raise longer the second time, or maybe shape it different. My bread did turn purple.

Every thing about this bread was awesome except the time it takes to rise(reason for just 4 stars). I like the taste of the pecans through out the bread but, the pecans were far more noticeable in the top crust, yum. The texture was about half way between a bagel & sandwich bread. The cranberries & pecans incorperated through out the dough & I was nervous that they wouldn't. I did opt for a loaf pan cause I needed to store in fridge overnight before baking. I allowed for extra rising time & baked the same way. I did use a 9 5/8" x 5 1/2" x 2 3/4" pan cause the smaller common loaf pan wouldn't have been large enough.

I added a bit more water as it needed it and it turned out great.  Great flavor.  Next time I might supplement the starter with  some yeast so that it rises faster.

Used dried cherries with the roasted pecans.  Bread flour and whole wheat instead of all-purpose.  Delicious!   Lightly toasted is perfect!
