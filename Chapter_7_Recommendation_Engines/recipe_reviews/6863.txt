Two things, after adding the egg whites it seems very moist, but it's all good.  As Angie mentioned it is a GINORMOUS loaf.  I have a Welbilt bread machine and it was to the top w/1 hr of baking yet to do.  FYI.   (btw..1 (.25) pkg of yeast is 1 tablespoon...yeah, I had to look it up;)

We just baked this bread yesterday and it was huge. We have a cuisinart convection breadmaker and the loaf went up over the bread pan. The size was 7 1/2 x 7 x 5. Very soft and better than store bought. High rating. Simple to bake.

Since I don't use margarine I substituted unsalted butter. I also added 1.25 teaspoons of salt to make up for the missing salt in the margarine. The bread came out perfect.

Very nice bread.  I don't use a bread machine so I mixed it with my KitchenAid and let it rise until doubled.  I then shaped it into a round loaf, slit the top and let it rise again.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Will make again.  thanks for posting the recipe

Very simple and good, I put it in the bread machine to mix but then divided into 2 loafs and baked in the oven.

I made the dough in my machine and then baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 25 min. Followed the recipe exactly. I am at a high altitude.  Tasted delicious texture was perfect.  Soft white bread. I may never buy store bought bread again.
