If there is anything I am a sucker for, it's potatoes and eggs. I really liked this recipe. The Italian sausage was a nice touch to this skillet breakfast. I kept the eggs in the broiler a little bit longer than normal since I am still getting used to runny eggs, but still even with doing that, the eggs were still pretty soft. Overall, very great dish. Will make this again for a bigger crowd during breakfast.

Made as written except I chose to slice my potatoes so that they would be easier to eat and also so that they would get nice and brown on all sides. This was super simple, quick, and bursting with flavor! I made this for dinner but it would be great for breakfast too. Serve it up in individual cast iron skillets for a fun presentation.

I usually shy away from cooking breakfast recipes with potatoes because I never get them right, but this recipe turned out great! I added half a diced red and green peppers just because. The texture of the tops of the eggs felt very hard and rubbery after broiling, I may have over cooked since I wanted the yolks cooked through but it still tasted good and didnâ€™t notice the egg texture when eating with all of the other good stuff in there!

My all-time-favorite-breakfast has always been corned beef hash, but this could steal the spot in my heart.  I loved KGora's suggestion of making her own turkey sausage; I may try it with venison sausage next time.  Worth making, and a perfect "breakfast-for-dinner" type recipe.

Delicious! I lightened it up a tad by making my own turkey italian sausage and it was great (adapted a recipe from this site). I cooked this in a cast iron skillet and the eggs, although cooked perfect on the top, ended up a little harder and a little difficult to cut on the bottom of the dish. Cast iron does hold heat more than regular skillets which may be why I had this issue. I loved the yolks running onto the potatoes and sausage. So good!

Delicious.  Easy to make.  I just substituted canadian bacon for the sausage.

I used what I had... 3 russet potatoes, 6oz italian sausage, 1/4 onion, 1/2 green and 1/2 orange bell pepper, fresh rosemary, canola oil, 5 eggs, salt and pepper. I followed the directions accordingly using these ingredients and it came out perfectly! It took longet than 30 minutes because the potatoes took longer to brown. I will defintely be following this recipe again in the future!

Used red skinned potatoes since that's what we had and skipped the rosemary.  Very nice presentation!

Loved this recipe and it worked well with a scrambled eggs topping too and a few dashes of hot sauce.  This will definitely go in our campfire/cast iron cooking rotation too.
