This was very good, and easy.  I added some chopped red and green bell pepper as well as chopped onion.  Also added a little half-and-half to the eggs and poured them over the sausage, potatoes and peppers in the 9x13 baking dish, then baked the whole thing for about 30 minutes.  Kicked it up a notch with a little cayenne pepper too.  My men loved it.  :-)

Really, REALLY yummy. I used my cast iron skillet so I could get a great crust on my potatoes and I added a couple tablespoons of butter along with the EVOO. I added a little Frank's Hot Sauce in with the eggs when I beat them. My sons and I ate pretty much this whole thing--my littlest especially enjoyed it. I think this would make a GREAT breakfast burrito, too. This was very filling and quick to make. I'm going to make this again this weekend and add some fresh vegetables, like chopped red pepper, onion, garlic and mushrooms and maybe a little cheese.

I made this for supper tonight & it was excelent! Of course I modified it...I melted some butter & sautee'd some chopped onion & fresh minced garlic. I mixed the butter, garlic & onion with the potatoes, & when I was done browning the sausage, I mixed some milk with the eggs, made the scrambled eggs & mixed them right into the potato mixture & put it on the bottom of the pan, & topped it with sausage. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350ยบ I just used a regular smoked sausage ring. My hubby added cheese to his potatoes, but I didn't think they needed it! Delish!

I used tater tots instead of potatoes. I cooked (fried?) them in a skillet while the sausage was browning. I added some heavy whipping cream to the beaten eggs and like a previous reviewer, I poured the eggs over the tots and sausage and then topped it with mozzarella AND cheddar cheese, since I also didnt have the cheesy sausages, only smoked sausage. I baked it for 30 minutes. 

Anyways, everyone LOVED this meal. I was VERY impressed at how versatile this recipe is, because I am one of those people that has to read te directions step by step for mac and cheese still!!!!! LOL... 

Thanks OP!

This recipe is FABULOUS. The potatoes, the sausage, the egg - it's the ultimate breakfast. I made as-is, except for omitting the paprika and adding Tony's, but that was personal preference. I also didn't have a cheesy smoked sausage, but I just sprinkled a handful of cheddar cheese over the kielbasa in the pan, and that worked out well. One thing I did do was pour the raw eggs over the sausage/potato mix and then cook it like that. Which was great and saved a pan, but I think cooking the potatoes in the oven might give them more of a roasted flavor. The eggs also stuck a bit to the pan, cooked like that. You NEED to try this. Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this into a one pot dinner, adding the raw eggs (with a little milk) to the saucepan and putting it into the oven for 20 minutes.  Really easy and tasty, this will be one of my go-to recipes for smoked sausage.

I would have given this a 3 - however, I used Idaho potatoes and that could have made this much drier than the recipe actually is.  Basic meat and potatoes without any real flavor.  I added whipping cream to the eggs and poured them in before baking and baked 30 min.  Maybe I didn't use enough cream - mine also stuck to the bottom of the pan.  The guys agreed it was a 2-3 star (the way I made it).  I had to add sour cream and salsa for my taste

5 star review with reviewers' suggestions of pouring beaten eggs over sausage/potato mixture and cooking as a casserole.  I used 10 eggs and would've been disappointed if I had used less.

My children really liked this, I thought it was pretty good. I think if I had followed the recipe as it was then I'd have loved it.

I used mild ground sausage because that's what I had. I also used different potatoes, they were small reds not regular ones. I also added cheese on top to make up for not having cheesy sausage.

Since the kids really liked it I will make it again, but use the sausage ring but I'll also try some hot sauce or peppers (on half, because God forbid the kids find a pepper in their food!).

Thanks for the recipe!

I used 3 1/2 C. frozen diced potatoes, sprinkled with fresh green pepper, onion, and a cup of medium cheddar then layered the smoked sausage (uncooked) on top of it all in the 9x13. Scrambled 8 eggs to just cover the sausage and sprinkled with an additional 1 C. medium cheddar. Baked at 375 for 50 or so minutes. There were no leftovers with this one. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I used just one pan on my stove because I despise dishes - used 2T butter to fry up the diced potatoes with peppers and green onions and seasonings while I cut the sausage, then put those in the 9x13 while I quickly browned the chopped sausage, then I dumped the sausage on top of the potatoes while I scrambled the eggs. Spead the scrambled eggs over the sausage, topped with cheese, and popped in the over for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, just to melt the cheese.  Took me about 35 mintues start to finish this way.  As promised, my man liked it, and so did I!

Simple to prepare, a delight to devour. A perfect example of the old saying, "If you can read, you can cook". I added shredded mild cheddar/monterey jack cheese on top of it after mixing in the eggs. Then I popped it back in the oven uncovered for 5 minutes. You can also warm-up some tortillas and use this for some impromptu breakfast tacos. Leftovers? What leftovers...............

This was pretty good! We had it for dinner last night...seemed a bit like overkill for potatoes and sausage when they probably would have been just as good in the skillet (than in the oven).  I added onions and garlic, which according to hubby he's not very fond of with eggs and potato...which was news to me :-)  But even with my additions,  he ate most of it and heated the leftovers up for breakfast! I topped mine with salsa and cheese and ate with tortillas, hubby topped his with Three Chili Dry Roasted Salsa (recipe on this site) and ate with tortillas.

My husband and I loved this hearty dish!  We had it for dinner one evening with slow cooked grits.
I did use sausage links (left over from breakfast) that worked just as well!  We will definitely cook this again.

This was a hit! I was looking for an alternative to the "Breakfast Casserole".  I did add cheese to the eggs. I also cut up the potatoes into bite size peices, the sausage 1 inch peices instead of 2 inches.  This was so good I dont think I will be making the breakfast casserole again!

All four of my boys, to include my husband, love this recipe! I like to leave recipes on here as is as much as I can. So, the only thing that we do different is to lessen the spices. We cut the spices almost in half. What I do is make the full spice recommendation and put the other half in a jar for easy prep next time as we do this often!

Per other reviews, I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top at the end. I also omitted the paprika as I didnt have any on hand. This was delicious. Everyone enjoyed it!

This wasn't bad at all, even though we were out of onion powder. We served it with salsa on the side at the dinner table and it was outstanding until I ran out of salsa. We will try it again adding bell peppers and chopped onions in place of onion powder.

Everyone in the house enjoyed this dish. I did make one small change and that was in the way I cooked it. I had to leave before it was done so I followed everything until it came to cooking the eggs. I just barely cooked them in the pan with the juices then poured them over the potatoes and sausage and put them back into the oven to let them finish. It worked out great. The eggs were light and fluffy. The whole dish was very tasty and quite filling.
Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This has a great flavor, but we thought it was pretty dry. Next time I might make a cheddar ruox sauce to pour over it, or serve with grits.
