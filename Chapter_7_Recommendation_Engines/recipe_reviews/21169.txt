I wasn't able to find the round pretzels either - as I saw some other reviewers note.  I used the square 'waffle' kind instead and still ended up with a tasty result.  Do be sure to note the fact that the kisses keep their shape when melted so don't wait for them to 'puddle' onto the pretzel.  When they are shiney take them out of the oven and press the M&M into the kiss to mold it to the pretzel.  I'm sure the round pretzel would be cuter, but the chocolate adhered fine to the square pretzels and tasted just as good!

Let me put it this way:  I made a batch, tasted one while still warm, then immediately knew I'd need to make another batch.  By the time the second batch was done, the first batch was almost half gone!  These are awesome and addictive!!  I heated the kisses for 2 minutes on top of waffle pretzels, and they smooshed perfectly.  It's also neat that you can easily scale this to however many treats you want to make.

Very easy.  Great for kids to help.  You can find round pretzels online.  I put pretzels on parchment paper otherwise they stick to pan (learned the hard way!).  I bake for 2 min at 275 degrees.  Take out of oven and gently wiggle pan to help chocolate "stick" to pretzel and flatten out.  I add M&M then refrigerate for about 30 minutes to harden.  Remove from pan and keep refrigerated (helps keep chocolate from turning white on top).

I was pleasantly surprised at the way these turned out. I read all the reviews before I made them and everything went smoothly. We tried several different flavors of Kisses and the ones that looked the best were the Peanut Butter Kiss and the Hugs. The only other suggestion I have is to use a wide straw to press the M&M into the Kiss. It keeps your fingers out of the chocolate and helps to give them all a neat and uniform look.

I made these with rolos and put pecan halves on them like someone suggested and they were excellent. I ended up making over 100 of them because they were gone in a day. So easy and they will be at every party I have from now on. Thanks for the great ideas.

This recipe really takes care of a chocolate fix quickly and simply.My six year old niece helped out and was thrilled with her results. Following the same directions,another fun treat is to place a Rollo on each pretzel rather than a candy kiss. When removed from the oven, press a pecan half into the warm Rollo. Yummy and looks like you worked all day on them.

On my first batch I left them in too because I'm a dope and I thought 1-2 minutes can't be long enough.  Well, they burnt.  I got it right the second time and they are wonderful.  I used Reese's pieces for the top.  Very easy...my daughter loved to help with this.  Thank you for sharing.  :)

I did exactly what the recipe said to do...I don't know what went wrong, but after 6 minutes the kisses had never melted, only shrunken and turned a bit softer.  I waited another minute or two, but then the chocolate started to burn.  Sigh...

This recipe was really easy and quick.  I used unsalted knotted pretzels.  I used Hershey's Hugs instead of kisses, and they looked beautiful.  Since I made these for holiday gifts, I also used the holiday red and green M&M's.  They turned out beautifully and everyone loved them.  Very yummy!

YUM and so easy ... these were a huge hit with my husband's work.  I used dark chocolate kisses & tried pecans as well as M&M's.  I also followed the same recipes with Rolo's and pecans ~ so good!  Definitely a keeper.

These are REALLY good and very easy to make. We had a get together last night and everyone loved them. Nice change from the traditional chocolate covered pretzel and much easier to do. I used the knotted pretzels (three holes) and an oven temperature of about 250 to ensure that the chocolate didn't burn. At 250 the chocolate was ready in about 4 minutes. After taking out of the oven, I used two M&M's on top of each pretzel because I just love the taste of chocolate. Also I drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate chips over each to create an even better treat. To make the drizzle, just melt 1/2 cup chocolate chips with about 1 - 2 tsp butter flavored crisco in small saucepan on very low heat.

These are the best! I have been making them for years. We call them "Bellybuttons". My favorite combos are kisses with peanut m&m's, and rolos with pecan halves. Almond m&m's are good too. I always use Snaps, the square pretzels. I think the temp is too high for this. I do a couple minutes at 250 degrees and that works well. Wait a minute or two before squishing on the tops to give the inside a chance to get soft. If the outsides crack, you are heating them for too long. As you squish the candy down, the chocolate should go into the pretzel some. It takes a batch or two to get the hang of this so they look pretty. Either way, these are never around long!

We make these every year at christmas time. We use Mini pretzel twists and rolos instead of kisses, and cook at 350 for 2 minutes. We position the rolo on the bottom circle so that it looks like a reindeer with two pretel loop ears, rolo nose, and we use red m&ms for "rudolph nose" If you liked these with kisses, try the rolo, they are even better! These are a big hit!

Hershey kisses do not soften because they changed their chocolate ingredients.  I used the Hershey creams and it worked much better. Also, if you are lucky, you can find butter pretzels that are in the shape of trees.

I've been making these for years so wanted to add my tips. First of all, I bake for 3 minutes at 250 degrees which is perfect. (Don't go over 4 minutes though - it will burn.) Secondly, the small twist pretzels work the best in my experience.  The problem with the round pretzels is that even if you're very careful about pressing the M&M down well enough to make the chocolate from the Kiss spread, it doesn't always spread enough-especially if younger children are the ones doing it. You then end up with some pretzels seperateing from the chocolate center quite easily. At least with the small twists or the waffle shapes, the chocolate has enough pretzel to attach to with no effort at all. My third tip is to make sure you line your baking sheet with either aluminum foil or parchment paper. These are easy and a great way to get your holiday sweet 'n salty fix.  It's a perfect activity for children too. My kids have been helping me since they were in preschool.  They do all the unwrapping, and placement of the pretzels and candies, and I do all the oven work.

This recipe is one of my favorites for finger food desserts.   ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW:  the kisses and hugs don't actually melt all the way and get gooey.  They just get soft and stick to the pretzel.  By adding the little M&M, you press it down to stay better.  But after it's cooled, it looks like a pretzel with a kiss on top, but the kiss won't fall off when you pick it up to eat it!  Hope that helps all those who wait for the kiss to "melt".

I make these every Christmas. I think the 350* oven is a bit high.  I preheat to 275* and put them in for about 2 minutes.  I also use a Brach's "star" chocolate candy instead of unwrapping all of the kisses.  Simple, good, and everyone loves these sweet and salty delights!!

Very easy, but has anyone else had problems w/ the chocolate "blooming"??  I keep getting white spots on the chocolates. They make wonderful gifts, but every batch I make keeps getting spots on them. I've tried letting them cool to room temp, then placing in fridge. Or placing them in the fridge after 15 mins after the over. But those darn spots keep coming back!! Please help!!

Quick, easy and NO MESS. I just made a little less than 400 of these and you would NOT know to look at my kitchen.  They look beautiful and taste even better. I consider this recipe my present from Allrecipes this year.

I have used this recipe quite a few times.  For those who expect the kisses to melt down, they often do not.  They do soften, and the act of pushing the candy in the middle pushes them down. At halloween time I put candy corn or the holiday colored m&m candies.  I have put gum drops, jelly beans, nuts etc. depending on the time of year I made them.  They are always a hit.  And by the way, I make them on the small pretzel twists and they are delicious.  Salted is better tasting than non salted because you get that great sweet/salty taste.  This is so easy!

So Easy!  My 9 year old took these to his class Christmast pary at school.  None came back home.  Use pastel colors for a spring party too.  They keep well in the refrigerator if you need to store them, but the chocolate does begin to turn white.

These are so easy and so tasty.  Only bake for about 1 to 2 minutes or else the chocolate will burn.  I made this mistake because the kisses did not appear to be melting, but they were!  Oooops!

Quick and easy!  The HUGS seem to melt faster than the other types of kisses, so may wish to put those in for 1 minute only.  The rest of the kisses did well at 90 seconds.

Great recipe and fun to make with my 4 year old!

We used an entire bag of round pretzels, which was 2 full cookie sheets worth.  That took a little over a bag and a half (13 ounce bags) of Kisses or Hugs.  We used both and next time I will only use the Hugs-- they looked much cuter and they melted better in the oven (even though I generally prefer Kisses based on taste alone).

My kids and I made this together. We made two different kinds--one with little Reese's and peanut butter M&M's and one with Rolo candies and milk chocolate M&M's. These were inexpensive to make and huge fun for the kids and I, nevermind really freaking tasty. We just had a blast making these. I can already see this making an appearance on our cookie trays this Christmas season.

For some reason the chocolate does not melt sometimes. Any ideas why? I had 1 batch that did & the next from the same bag of candy not melt at all and just crumble when I put the m&m on. This si the second time this happened??? When they come out right, they are great.

Yum! and so simple to make! I made close to 200 to put in tins as a holiday treat (with shortbread cookies and loose kisses and M&M's) for friends/neighbors and family I used milk, dark and hugs, though next time I will only use hugs or dark kisses, the milk chocolate doesn't melt quite as nice as those two.

Very cute, easy, turned out great.  Thanks to the other person who suggested using a straw to push on the m&m's.  Do not use caramel kisses.  When you push down the m&m the caramel squirts out and makes them look all messy.  The reg. kisses worked fine.

Second year I've made these, always a hit with the combo of salty and sweet. Being in Chicagoland I've found a local brand makes the rings (Jay's), and I've also found the holiday mint kisses melt better. I top them with the holiday mint M&M's for even more mint (I LOVE mint). I find giving a twist to the pretzel ring after I smoosh the M&M into the kiss helps the chocolate adhere. Also, the chocolate will bloom (get cloudy) after a few days so if you are making them for a party don't make them too far in advance.

They tasted really good, but I had a huge problem getting the chocolate to stick to the pretzel.  Even though it melted into the holes in the pretzel they fell off when they were dry.  They were festive though, and tastey.

These were so easy and fun for my 6 year old to help with!  Much easier and less messy than regular chocolate covered pretzels.  I'm glad I read the reviews about the kiss not melting - perhaps someone should change the wording in the actual recipe to make that clearer.

I used the waffle pretzels and Easter m&m's and they turned out adorable! They looked like little nests.

I'll be using this recipe again and again.

These were okay. Yes, like other members stated, the kisses retain their shape. I used the round waffle pretzels and regular chocolate Kisses and the striped Hugs with red and green M&M'S. The hugs looked nicer. My problem with this recipe is that I would prefer a better ratio of chocolate-to-pretzel. My husband and I agree that it's a good idea but if I made them again I'd not use M&M'S and maybe just take another pretzel and make a sandwich.  They look cute, but taste-
wise I'd modify the recipe. I made small twist pretzels dipped and drizzled in different chocolates and some were sprinkled with Christmas sprinkles. I made these right after this recipe and I'd rather take the effort to make the twists. If I had children I'd make this recipe again as-is, though.  Thanks You for it, though.  I'm newly married and trying to improve my cooking skills.  Practice makes me... better!

I used Peanut Butter Kisses on square pretzels.  After reading the reviews I was not expecting the Kisses to actually melt (everyone was saying they retain their shape).  Well, I put them in the oven on 350, for 1.5 minutes, and they definitely melted down!  Perhaps my oven is a bit hotter than most (it's new), or maybe it's b/c they're PB Kisses.  Just keep in mind that it is possible for them to melt down in certain circumstances.  I actually preferred this, though, as the kiss covered most of the pretzels and adhered nicely to them.  I only had to drop the M&M on, didn't have to smush at all.  Just make sure to use parchment paper on the cookie sheet as the chocolate WILL seep through if they do melt down.  I set mine in the freezer and that part took a lot less time.  

Absolutely delicious!  I am giving them as gifts this Christmas but I wish I could eat them all myself!  Don't make these while you're hungry!

My youngest son loves these.  I didn't like the round pretzels (the chocolate fell through when cooled), so I use the small twisted pretzels (three holes).  I place the Hershey's on top of the twist and then put MINT M&M's on top.  That way the pretzel and chocolate becomes "one".  These are sooooo easy and he loves to smoosh the chocolate down with the M&M!

Very easy and delicious.  Be careful to not try to make too many more at one time, the kisses will cool before you can get to them all and make it more difficult to press in the M&M.  Better to do 2 smaller batches.

I actually prefer these with the vanilla melting wafers (from the craft store).  Very easy and delicious but I did learn the hard way, don't use the butter pretzels (not a good flavor combo)!

I made these for a United Way bake sale at work. They went quickly and everyone loved them. The first batch were in the oven for 1:30mins and they were too soft and the second batch was in for 1mins and were much firmer. I'm making them again for a party tonight and I'm going to try 1:15mins. I can't wait!

I made this last night. It's very easy, but being in the South, I had too many size and shape pretzels to choose from.  Both big and mini round: thick & thin, waffle, stick.  I wasn't sure which was the best to use. I chose the larger, medium thickness. The kiss melted in the center, but I prefer chocolate on more of the pretzel.  I did do as previous reviewers suggested and pushed down the kiss with the M&M. They are tasty and look cute, but I'm not real pleased with a "glob" of chocolate all in the center. JMO.... Addie

For Different Kisses - if you're mixing it up and using both traditional chocolate kisses and vanilla/swirl kisses, watch the timing - vanilla kisses cook quicker so take a minute off the cooking time. A wonderful versatile recipe.  Yummy, easy, pretty and well received - great to give as little thank you gifts to teachers, friends & neighbors.

SO good and easy!  Instead of putting an m&m on top of the kiss, I gently place a second pretzel over the kiss and carefully press down to lightly smoosh the kiss between the two pretzels.  The end result => a kiss and pretzel sandwich.  No one believes me that something this tasty is just that easy.

easy to whip up, great presentation to add to a holiday tray, and the possibilities are endless with combinations of chocolates and garnish.  I used rolo candies and topped with a holiday peanut M&M.  350 oven was fine, no muss no fuss.  Rule of thumb is that you'll know when they are soft enough when the top of the chocolate becomes shiny.  It will still be holding its shape and look unmelted but as long as the tops are shiny, they're ready to take out.

We followed the recipe using milk chocolate Kisses and these were not edible.  The chocolate burned before it ever got soft enough to press in the M&Ms.  350 is much too high a temperature.  I hope that the original poster considers updating this recipe.  Looks like this temp might work for hugs, but not for milk chocolate kisses.

I've made these lots of times.  This halloween I thought I'd try a candy corn on top.  Check out my picture.

Easy.  Tasty.  I used "Snaps" hugs, kisses, and Rollo's.  I baked 2.5-3 minutes at 250.  I found that if they sit for a minute they melt just enough, but move fast or they'll cool before you're done, especially the Rollo's.

Good and easy. I think it would be better with rolos instead of kisses though.

Super tasty and embarrassingly easy! I made half with chocolate and m&m's and half with Milk Duds and M&M's. The Milk Duds were zomg awesome! But, I strongly suggest you use parchment to keep removal and clean up easy.

Couldn't find circular pretzels so I used square ones. I heated these up at 300 for 2 minutes and it was perfect, for me. Kids can be a big help in making these. They're so easy and quite good, too!

These were so Easy and yummy.  We used milk chocolate kisses and topped the with Reeces Pieces. Salty Pretzles, chocolate, and peanutbutter... what more can you ask for. I cooked for 3 minutes at 250 degrees.

I wonder if anybody else had the problem I had.  My Hershey kisses wouldn't melt properly and when I tried to put the m&m into it, it cracked rather than collapse smoothly.  They were tasty, but not as pretty as I hoped.

So easy - and fun with the specialty m&m's in various colors! (Check a local party store or their m&m's web site.) Think pink or blue for a baby shower, green for St Pat's Day, your collegiate colors for a tail gate, red/white/blue for the 4th and of course black & orange for Halloween!!!

I just ran across this recipe - I have been making this snack treat at Christmas for years.  However, I use Mint M&M's on top of Hugs Kisses.  These are really good!  I have made with regular Kisses and M&M's as well, but Hugs melt really well in the oven.  I have nicknamed these "paw prints" because if you use regular bite size pretzels, they leave "paw prints" when you take them off of the cookie sheets.

Very easy and suprisingly tasty.  I was a ble to find doung pretzels, they are by Rold Gold and called Checkers.  I use Brach's stars instead of the kisses.  I don't think that I would have had to press the m&m hard into the star to make it stick to the pretzel like I did which squished it.  next time I will just place it on there and it will look nicer.  Next time is tomorrow because I have eaten way, way too many!  I baked at 250 for about 4-5 minutes.

This is a favorite at my house!  And every time I give them as gifts, people rave about them.  My 3 year old will sit & unwrap all the chocolate kisses for me (usually without eating too many)!  The secret is not to bake more than 2 minutes.  The Kisses don't really melt or lose shape in the oven, they just become soft so that they collapse when you put the M&M on top.  I use the square waffle pretzels, because I can't find the round ones.  Also, I tried using the caramel Kisses and they were so fabulous (although slightly messier)!  You can use the peanut M&M with the caramel Kisses to make a chocolate "turtle" pretzel!  But, my family prefers the basic recipe so I usually stick to that!

Very Good, easy to make.
If you are a first timer (as I was) the chocolate kisses hold their shape even when melted.  So 2 minutes is really all you need even though they don't look melted, they are.  Use the candies to push the chocolate down.  I also used mini twists as I couldn't find circular pretzles.  Worked great!

These are a new family favorite, but we are using the Hershey's "HUGS" kisses, which are the striped white and milk chocolate.  They look really neat, and you get the taste of both chocolates in the pretzel!

My Hugs absolutely would not melt.  I tried all different temperatures, broiling, microwaving, and nothing would melt these.  They would melt on the inside but the outsides would just burn.  I know it can be done because I had these at a school picnic. I'll try again one day ... Tried again with success!  Another reviewer noted that the hug keeps it's shape even though it IS melted.  VERY CUTE!!

Kisses are softened when they come out of the oven but hold their shape. Pressing the M&Ms into the center is what makes them look "melted". I used the waffle type and peanut M&Ms. They are so easy, delicious and look nice with the colors.

My daughters and I make these every year and love them. Despite our best intentions, they rarely survive long enough to become gifts, because we eat them all. We like to make a batch with kisses, a batch with Rolos and a batch with mini peanut butter cups. We top them with M&Ms or various kinds of nuts. Every variation is awesome. To the reviewer who said her kisses never melted, sometimes they do appear un-melted but if you go ahead and press the almond or M&M or whatever into the top, they will turn out to be plenty soft after all.

Another holiday treat to make with your kids. Super fun and super easy. Be careful on the time in the oven as one batch of mine I didn't watch closely enough got super hard. However. I'll be making these every year. This was fun and tasty and the kids really enjoyed having them.

Well, I was excited but it didn't work out.  Not sure what went wrong, but finally gave up.  The chocolate kisses would not melt, instead got hard, so the candies wouldn't go in.  Instead the chocolate broke as I pushed it in.  How disappointing.

I was skeptical of a recipe involving hard, dry salty pretzels with smooth, sweet chocolate, but I decided to try this one anyway because they looked interesting in the picture.  My, those little M&M's on top are as cute as a button - providing you can get your chocolate kisses to melt before they burn and before the pretzels turn even harder.  In the end, I can't decide which was worse - the burning, fuming chocolates, or the underlying, overbaked  pretzels. I'm certain  that the oven temperature recommended in this recipe is WAY  off. My oven smoked up so badly I could no longer see them through the door, and when I opened it, the smoke that billowed out set off the smoke alarm, alerting the neighbors. What an embarrassing debacle (not to mention waste of money).  I should have trusted my initial instinct and made something else.

This recipe is great but I only gave it a four because I found that for me, after several experiments, cooking these in a 275 degree oven for 3 minutes worked best. Also, as others said, wouldn't use butter pretzels and tried the rolo's too. They worked great. Too also reiterate, don't wait for the kisses to melt, push them down - don't be shy, with the m-n-m, into the pretzel. If the temp and time is just right, they will adhere to the pretzel. Hope that helps. P.S Mine didn't come out quite as pretty as those in the picture but still tasted great and believe me..nobody complained!

The temp on this is WAY too hot. You will end up with burnt chocolate. I turned the oven down to 180 degrees, baked for 4 - 6 min.

Make these every Christmas, and they always turn out delicious! They look amazing when you use Hugs and the Christmas colored M&Ms :)

Perfect!  I made it as an activity with my toddler son - we unwrapped the kisses and color sorted the M&Ms together (fine motor skills and colors - educational, right?).  I baked for 1 1/2 minutes (like previous reviewer said - they're good to go when shiny).  I actually found the later ones were easier to smoosh b/c the heat from the pan melted them a little better by the end so I went and pushed the ones in further.  I just used regular twist pretzels - small ones.

These are awesome and super easy and quick to make.  The longest part is unwrapping the kisses!!  I like dark chocolate and those melted really well.  I use just small pretzel twists and don't bother searching for the round ones and they work out well for me.  I used a straw to push my M & M's in the middle then pop them in the fridge to set up for a bit.  My family and everyone at the office love these.   It's a great snack for those who like a salty/sweet mix.  I'll make a batch of these a month and keep them in the fridge to grab two or three as a snack!!

awesome recipe!  I used square waffles, hugs instead of kisses, and red and green mm's.  Brought these to my Christmas party, and they were gone.  Thanks for the simple, yummy recipe!

Very cute. My 3 year old had lots of fun making these for Christmas. I used dark chocolate and milk chocolate kisses. The dark chocolate melted perfectly at 2 minutes. The milk chocolate kisses didn't melt very well in my oven. Next time I'll have to add an additional 30 seconds - 1 minute if I use milk chocolate.

I opted to make these for my son's school holiday party because I figured they would be easier and less time consuming than baking cookies.  But I think I should have stuck to cookies.  I, like many others was disappointed to find no round pretzels in store after store (did not have time to order online).  I was delighted to finally find round butter waffle ones at last.  I started out with a  mixed batch of milk and dark.  The dark turned out beautifully but the milk seemed to not be soft enough so I put them back in and, like other reviewers, burnt them.  I tried another batch of milk by themselves but no matter how long I left them in the end result was ugly (compared to the dark).  The end result was a pretty big mess in my kitchen (something I was hoping I would avoid with this seemingly quick and easy recipe) and some pretty and yummy dark chocolate buttons.  To do it again I would order the round pretzels online and only use dark chocolate kisses.

I looooove this idea. You can knock out a huge amount of these in a very short time and they make great gifts. I don't like too much chocolate though so instead of m&ms I pressed another pretzel on top. I used the snaps. Next time I will purchase a better quality chocolate instead of hersheys.

I've been making these for years and they're always a huge hit. I like using the "snap" square pretzels, they travel better in containers and look great. I've also used rolo carmel candies for variety. (use 2 colors for kisses & 2 other colors for rolos so people know which is which).

These taste just like any other chocolate and pretzel snack but they look cute.  I think they would be better with peanut butter m & m's than regular chocolate.  Also, not good for a party or travel, they melt again as if fresh out the oven.  Only good straight out the fridge for the little ones.

This was extremely easy but I changed it up a little. I added 2 or 3 mini marshmallows alone with no chocolate but the M&M and instead of kisses I took hershey bars seperated and then cut each square in 1/2. It cut down on the sweetness and placed them in the over for about 1 or 2 min keeping eye on marshmallows then i added a M&M on top. They was perfect. I placed in refridge for about 5 min for the hershey bar to set back up and will be using this for the wedding reception on pretty plates for the guests to snack on!

Outstanding recipe to make with kids. Super easy, fun prep (get them to do the unwrapping) and you can do it for as long as they have the attention (15 min to 2 hrs. depending on how many ingredients you have!)  We did Hershey HUGS, which melted quicker than the ROLOs and the KISSES.  Put Xmas M & Ms in the Hugs and Kisses and Pecans in the Rolos. Look superb and taste great!  Clean-up was a breeze as well (parchment paper on the baking sheets).  Will do for every holiday!

I made these for a potluck, and then since I had so many, gave a bunch to my parents for their poker night. Not a single pretzel came back from either source. I used Rollos and Hugs (the milk chocolate/white chocolate variety), all topped with M&Ms (too many people allergic to nuts). I kept the Rollos in the oven for 3 minutes, and the Hugs for 2 minutes. I thought the Hugs were the prettiest, because the stripes gave a nice presentation. Both were tasty, although the caramel in the Rollos was a bit chewy (caramel Hugs or Kisses might work out better, if I can find some next time). That's the nature of the candy, though. Very easy and inexpensive to make. Oh, I also used Snyder's square waffle (buttery and salted) pretzels. I kept eating the 'naked' pretzels while I was prepping the other pretzels to be coated. I actually wished I had some kids so they could help out with this. It seems like a great activity for them.

Made these twice over the Christmas season. Big hit. Made them with both Kisses and Hugs (I think the Hugs taste better) but the Hugs melt quicker than the kisses.  Used regular sized M&Ms and waffle pretzels.

These are excellent, a huge hit when I make them.  I like to play around with different types of kisses (caramel, dark chocolate, hugs, etc.)  The caramel are always a big hit, but a word of caution, when you press them m&m in if the chocolate is too soft the caramel will explode out and make a bit of a mess, still tasty though!  Also, the time you need to leave them in the oven will vary slightly depending on the chocolate (white chocolate melts faster, dark chocolate take a little longer).  I was so glad to find this recipe!!!

I finally had time to try out this recipe for my family. I didn't have M&M's or anything that might work to add to the top of each melted chocolate. So...I added another "waffle" pretzel to the top of each melted chocolate to make chocolate pretzel sandwiches! They were a big hit with everyone who tried them! I made half with Rolo's and half with milk chocolate Hershey's Kisses.

Huge hit @ Xmas! Used square pretzels because that's what I could find. Turned out super cute! I used 1/2 kisses and 1/2 hugs.

While these are good, try using rolos  (caramels in milk chocolate) instead of the kisses.  They are so much better that way.

These are great treats!! My only finding when making these is that the white chocolate hug kisses don't hold up to the heat, even when baked for only 90 seconds at 350.  They collapsed as soon as I put the M&M on it.  Otherwise these were a hit wherever I took them and everyone was amazed at how easy.  Can be made any time of year for a quick treat.

I used dark chocolate kisses and also peppermint kisses. Both were good: the perfect mix of sweet and salty. This is not your usual chocolate-covered pretzel because the pretzel is not covered in chocolate, (therefore, not as a chocolatey as I like), but it sure looks cute!

Absolutely addictive! Thank goodness they're quick and easy because at my house they disappeared very fast. Next I'll try some of the suggestions in the other reviews - they all sound delicious.

Wow, this really did take just 2 mins in the oven!  I was looking for a simple treat  to make for my office -- I went with mini-pretzels, Ghirardelli semisweet morsels (like mini-Kisses, but cheaper), and mini-m&m's I had around -- perfect V-day treats (the chocolate covers the middle, so it looks like a heart with a chocolate center).  Great, quick treat!!

This is great! I tested about 4 pretzels to start with using the Hersheys Hugs @ 275 degrees for 1-2 minutes, dropped the M&Ms (letter side down).

At first, I had figured out picking them up to put on a plate or wax paper to chill was not going to work; too messy! I had used parchment paper to do them so just placed the entire cookie sheet straight in on my upper shelf of the fridge to chill about 20 minutes. Once chilled, threw in a container and put in the freezer while I had another going in on the shelf and so on.

Now I just did my first tester for the rolos. To melt those takes longer..first time was about 20 minutes for that then topped with a chopped walnut in center. Those are really tasty too, hubby loves those! Thing is, it just takes longer but we'll see..Im doing my first real full tray as I type this. Im excited with this easy and tasty recipe. I took a couple digital pics of mine and sent to a couple friends and already have gotton 3 emails back on what is it and how to do them. :-) I just wish I had more shelves empty in my fridge for doing two batches (trays) at a time. 

Btw, the hardest part of this whole thing is just unwrapping the kisses or rolos! haha

PS** ------ Just finished my first full tray of the Rolos! Tasty yes! But HELP!!! I chilled them but for not as long as the hersheys hugs. Maybe becuase I immediately tested them from the fridge they were a bit hard (the carmel part) setting..so maybe I need to set them out at room temp for a little bit

Unfortunately, I couldn't find round pretzels. I used Tiny Twists, which worked fine, but weren't nearly as cute as the round ones would have been. I used milk chocolate kisses, peanut butter filled kisses, and white chocolate hugs. The hugs looked the prettiest, but the peanut butter ones tasted awesome. I lowered the oven temp to 250 for the white chocolate and PB ones because they melt quite a bit more quickly than the solid milk chocolate ones. Great idea, they look so cute on my cookie trays!

Don't leave these in the oven too long, or you'll waste a perfectly good bag of Chocolate Kisses! :(  I learned the hard way!!  Round Pretzels are available from Ballreich's Chips.

So simple, quick and cute!  I've made these several times since I first found the recipe in November.  Guests, both young and old, can't get enough of these.  No matter how many you make, it won't be enough!!!!!  Personally, I prefer to use the milk chocolate disks (Merkens brand sold in bulk)rather than the Hershey's kisses.  I think the chocolate taste of the Kiss overpowers the pretzel.  Plus, you don't have to unwrap anything!!!!!  Just plop a chocolate disk on top of the pretzel (I prefer the waffle-shaped Snaps) and voila!  I bake each batch for 2 minutes at 275 and have found that if you leave them on the baking sheet for about 30 sec or so before pressing the M&Ms in, it works perfectly. I place each tray in the fridge just until the next batch comes out.  With using the chocolate disks, I've had no problems whatsoever with the chocolate setting up.  As soon as they come out of the fridge, I put them in tins. Great gift idea for teachers and such!

On the easy chart, this is certainly a 5. I do agree with another post that the chocolate can look a bit wrinkled/cracked. I put less in the oven at a time so I could attend to each on more quickly to prevent this.

I also tried using the Kisses with caramel and found the caramel was too goopy and lost the cute shape. However, I did try adding a large walnut or pecan half to these rather then an M&M and it didn't seem to be as crucial that the shape was not so perfect.

Some were concerned about the cookies sticking, and I will say my best baking friend is Parchment paper. It works so well and can go back in the oven on a cookie sheet repeatedly. Try it!

My 3 1/2 year old loved helping with this recipe.

This dessert is phenomenal! I've been making these for years but instead of the kisses I use rolos! The carmel makes them even better. They are addicting, and they freeze well too!

A good recipe to make with my son, and what a success!!  My son and husband devoured them!!!  I had to make 3 batches in all!!  They just kept eating  them.  They would be good to make and put in snack bags for Valentine's Day for my little one to take to CCD.  Definately will make these again!

So easy and delicious.  I tried these recently at a bake sale and they were made with the little green and red chocolate discs.  Although pretty to look at, they don't have enough chocolate flavor like the candy kisses.  I would stick with those unless you know someone who makes an awesome melting chocolate disc.  I have yet to find one myself.  I topped them with green and red M & M's.  (Try to put the printed M down).  I found that 2 bags of Kisses covered nearly 1 bag of pretzels and about 3/4 of a bag of plain M & M's.  Great gift to give to friends in little tins.  HINT:  If you are making as many as I did, get some to help, it seems to take forever to get the foil off the Kisses!

LOVED THEM!  Easy to make, easy to triple or quadruple, and easy to store when cooled.  I'm not a fan of chocolate or pretzels, but I send them to my husbands work and they're fought over.  Thanks!

Not reading the reviews, I too was perplexed by the fact that the Kisses didnt melt the way the recipe indicated. Strangly enough, I couldnt find the round pretzels and used the Waffle ones instead and smashed the Kiss with the M&M. They tasted great but did not look good enough to use as a gift. Next time I'll try the microwave as suggested.... AND from now on I'll read the reviews of the smartest cooks in the world... my fellow www.allrecipes.com subscribers!

Pretty good.  The taste is awesome, but the oven version is messy and the end result is not pretty. After reading the reviews I went ahead and melted the chocolate in the microwave for about a minute as someone suggested and it worked much better. You can use any shape pretzel at that point because you are just dipping. I then placed them on a tray covered with wax paper, regrigerated them a few minutes then I boxed them. Great gifts! I made these for the people in my office!

a fun cookie, but the kisses dont really "melt" they keep their shape, just like when you make peanut butter cookies.  Take them from the oven and press the candy into them.  yum.

I have made these often, and have shared the frustration of some of  your reviewers.  Some days the kisses just don't melt, even though they have been excellent before.  Chocolate is a very temperamental ingredient.  If they have ever been stored in the cold, a refrigerator, or frozen, you will have difficulty.  These treats have funded many a school activity in the past, and now they are a popular treat at Maison Française at UW-Madison.  Of course only the red m&m's are used for the Badger fans.

The trick to these is not to bake them too long! A minute was perfect for mine. If you overbake, the kisses will sieze up and be ruined. Remember that the kisses will maintain their shape, so don't look for them to melt down. You'll smush them down with the m&m's as soon as they come out of the oven. I mass produced these last year to put in Christmas baggies for my daughter's classroom - what a hit!

Quick and delicious! A simple treat when in a hurry. When I make them I bake them at 250 to prevent the kisses from burning.

I have made these many times. However I use chocolate disks that you buy to melt for candy. I put the pretzels on a glass plate, put the candy disk on top and put it in my microwave oven for two minutes on half power. Take them out and press the candy into it.

I think Hershey's has changed their 'Kisses" recipe.  I made these years ago,  and never had any problems.  The last two times I've tried making them, the Kisses don't seem to melt.  When I try to push the M&Ms into them, they are hard, cracked and a chalky ooking mess.  

This is a great recipe , but I'm going to have to find a different brand of chocolate.

It took me a few tries even though it seems like the easiest thing but I tried it at 350 for 2 minutes, then 4 min and so on and it just kept crumbling. I then read other reviews and decided to try it at 250 for 2 minutes and that was perfect!  I also tried using the white chocolate kisses and that seemed to work better. It was worth it in the end though!

Threw out the entire batch--waste of time and money. Wish I would've read all the reviews before making these.  The kisses don't melt, and started sweating in the oven almost immediately. I kept checking them and even pushed a couple down w/the back of a spoon to check the softness....and the chocolate crumbled.  Maybe using plain chocolate chips or discs would work better.  I have had way better luck w/caramels instead of the chocolate. I'll stick with that.

I've been making these for years and in the beginning couldn't understand why the kisses crumbled instead of melted. I thought leaving them in longer would make it easier to press the M&M's in, because that tedious action become a hassle. I was wrong. Just put them in for 2 minutes always keeping an eye on then. When they're shiny immediately take them out. Good luck!

I put the chocolate and pretzels in the oven at 200 degrees for 12 minutes and they melted perfectly! Round pretzels are impossible to find, so I balanced the kisses in the middle of the regular pretzels.

These are the easiest holiday treat! I don't recommend using caramel kisses though...they didn't melt very well and it was difficult to push the M&Ms into them. I also used peppermint kisses and those worked great.

This recipe is a quick and easy recipe for parties and pot lucks. I needed to bring a snack to a Halloween party. I used all fall colored M&M's on a tray of milk chocolate Hershey's kisses and a tray of cookies and cream Hershey's kisses. They were a big hit with adults and children. Such a great idea, thank you!

Favorite easy-to-make snack food for a crowd. It always disappears within 5 minutes though. I love making this with nuts so it tastes like a turtle. also, a great way to use up m&ms before they expire :)

I thought that 1-2 minutes wasn't long enough so I put it in for 5-6 minutes and... it burned. I did get to finish it by starting a new batch and microwaving it for 40 seconds. 1 minute is way too long. It turned out great. Salty and sweet. So easy to make!!!

Hershey's MINI kisses are a good option - they are not wrapped and are smaller so you have more pretzel taste. I followed the 3 minutes at 250 degrees and that worked great for the minis - so fun! Used red/green M&Ms for Christmas!

Great simply EASY recipe for my kids to help!  Super tasty.  Making these for treat bags for the holidays for my daughter's class.  Just remember the chocolate will melt after 1-2 minutes (it's still hold its shape).  I made the mistake the first time thinking I need to wait for it to "melt" over the pretzel.

This is a very good concept- it combines sweet and salty wonderfully. The reason I am only giving this 4 stars is because of the heat it said. 350* would have been WAY too hot. I used another reviewer's suggestion and put the heat at 275*. I baked them for 2 minutes a batch. This combination of heat and time was perfect- the chocolate was gooey enough for the candy coated chocolate to sink in, but not too gooey that it made a mess. For the people that say the chocolate kisses never melted, they aren't supposed to fully. The purpose of baking them is to make them softer, not completely melted. I put them in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes and they set nicely. All and all these were very delicious and I recommend them highly if the heat is changed.

Excellent, always a hit when I take it somewhere. I always get asked for the recipe.  For those of you that are having trouble finding the square pretzels, check out your local bulk food store (In Canada we have Bulk Barn).  You can also pick out a variety of different types of kisses, like white chocolate and cookies and cream for a variation.  They all work well. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are super easy and cute. I made them for my 3 year old's party and the parents raved about them. Many of them asked me how I made them. They are super fast to make too. One tip, you'll be tempted to make a huge batch of them at once, but do them in batches of 20-24 at a time because the chocolate will cool and start to crack when you push the M&M down. If you want them looking as perfect as possible, do them in small batches so you can take your time and make them really nice.

My 2 1/2 yr. old grandson and I made these for Christmas and he had a ball. I not sure if he had more FUN unwrapping the Hershey Kisses or eating the M&M's. I also put a Rolo on the pretzel and melted those --top it with a Reese's Pieces. This is a
nice addition to a cookie tray.

I love to make these! They're so easy for parties and gatherings. I usually make them with the window pane pretzels and let them go almost 3 minutes in the oven to get a smoother look.

Tip: put the pretzels salt-side down--they taste better!  :d
UPDATE, 4 years later:  Definitely salt-down!  Gives a salty-sweet, chocolate-covered-pretzel taste that can't be beat!  We prefer dark Kisses, and for a twist, try Reese's Pieces instead of M&M's.  Your family will think you are a treat-making genius.  x:]

My husband and I made these last night. They turned out perfectly and so delicious. I used milk chocolate kisses and peanut butter M&M's, other than that followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make these over and over again!

this is better than the circle pretzels, it's less messy and a little more pretzel.

We used square pretzels, Hugs, and red/green m&m's. Two minutes was the perfect amount of time. Based on other reviews we put only a few in for the first batch to test. Other types of kisses may melt differently. The Hugs did not appear melted when we took them out. But, when we pushed the m&m down gently with our finger or the end of a straw the Hug did flatten out. I made these with a nine and thirteen year old. Very easy and very tasty!

Supe easy and super fun:) My eight year old can do all the prep, all I needed to do was put them in the oven. Just be careful not to leave the kisses in the oven too long they will burn! I will absolutely make these again!

I make these but with Rolo's on top of the square pretzel and then a whole pecan on top. It is a crowd pleaser for sure!

I always use the square waffle style pretzels, as they allow the chocolate to stay placed more securely on them and they are available all year.  The round pretzels are only available in store around Christmas.  The round ones let the chocolate get more lopsided on them.  I also substitute Rolos in place of the kisses; they are denser, hold their shape, and add that caramel that everyone likes! Plus, the M&Ms fit right into those indents on top of the Rolos.

Easy and very addicting because they are delicious! I use the waffle pretzels, I think this gives a good balance of salt/sweet as there is a bit more pretzel with these vs. the circular. They are great to package up in little baggies/wrap to give as gifts. We will be making these with the preschoolers at my school for our preschool Christmas program to serve.

4 stars because chocolate and salt always go well together but these were a pain in the butt to get right.  Following the directions as written the hershey's kisses would detach from the pretzel as soon as they cooled so where we made them was where we had to serve them.  We heated them an extra minute or so but then they weren't as pretty as pictured and didn't look great on a plate at a party.  Next time I think I'll preheat the pretzels to give the kisses a jump start once I put them in the oven.

I think it works better if you warm the kisses on parchment paper by themselves, them press the pretzel down over the top and stick on the M&M.  They are crazy delicious!

These were great! I couldnt find pretzel rings so i used the waffle shaped ones. I made 1 batch using the milk chocolate kisses and 1 batch of candy cane kisses. I prefered the candy cane ones. I also used holiday colored m&m's. everyone loved these. I will be making these again.

These are wonderful!  I used the Candy Cane Kisses and the Caramel Kisses this year.  I like to set the oven on 275 and the timer at 2 minutes.  Then watch closely if you need a little more time.  Also, if you are using a variety of Kisses, make each kind on its own.  They all melt at a little different rate.  They go very quickly at a party!

These are good.  If you are planning on using Hershey's Hugs instead of kisses, only heat for a minute.  They melt quicker and and get too gooey if you leave them in as long as you normally do for the kisses.

I did hershey kisses and hugs. Apparently, I left them in the oven too long. I think I did 5 minutes at 350. I wound up throwing them away and just putting the new batch in the microwave on 50 percent power for 1 minute. They were perfect! The hugs come out really cute with the stripes on them!

We make these with regular pretzels and put red m & m's on.  The pretzel looks like ears of a reindeer and the red nose of Ruldolph.  We call them reindeer cookies!  Easy for kids to make!

I learned to do these from my cousin a few years back and have made them dozens of times since.  They are WONDERFUL!  Everytime I'm invited to a gathering where there'll be food, people ask me to bring these.  They're SUPER easy to make and the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  My little brother and sister used to love helping me make these...they're a great kid's recipe.

These were a lot of fun, but the chocolate kisses were too tempermental to work with.  We used rolos and hugs.  The hugs were SO cute, but I did have to put them in the fridge to get them hard enought to put in a jar.  I also used square pretzels and they were still cute.

This was quick and easy.  I did 3 minutes at 275.  Chocolate...perfect.  Hugs, too long.  Take out sooner. If you want them to look picture perfect, will  need tweezers to place the m&m. Forget tongs. 

Perfect for football games. Also perfect to make in the morning to bring to the game party in the afternoon. Takes just minutes and refrigerate.

These were a hit!  I used white chocolate hugs and regular milk chocolate  kisses.  My milk choc. never melted!  I don't understand? I am still giving it 5 stars because they were great and everyone loved them, (the huggs, I threw away the milk chocolate they were burnt!)   maybe it was just my oven or something or a bad bag of kisses but I would love to know why they did not melt!

Tasty and soooooo easy to make. As others have said, don't wait for the kisses to melt, just until they're shiny. When you take them out of then oven they will melt down.

Such a fun and festive treat and a great for gift giving.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the kisses looked "chalky" once they cooled.  But the sweet and salty combination tastes great!

I've made a similar recipe for years.  I use the waffle, square pretzels, melt a Rolo on top and then press a walnet or pecan in the top.  We call them "Turtle Pretzels."

I made these last year for a Christmas Party and they didn't last one day.  I did, however, have leftovers of everything else!  Needless to say, I will be making up several batches for my Christmas Parties this year and for my holiday trays I give to the neighbors.

So simple and yummy! The only complaint I have could be a direct result of my impatience. I cooked 'em up, popped them in the fridge until they cooled, and tested them on my fiancé. I found that even though the dark chocolate kisses had cooled, they were still mushy. I'd love to put these in tins or jars to give as gifts, but I don't see how that's possible if the chocolate stays soft. Does the chocolate harden if left in the fridge (or freezer) overnight? **UPDATE!** New year, new discoveries! I pile everything together before putting them in the oven, then as other suggested I push the whole thing down with a spoon. And I actually prefer making these with Rolo chocolates and pecans and if you freeze them, you can pack them in a tin easily. The set really well. Just don't forget to defrost!

The kids love these and love to help make them. They make great gifts. It is easier to use the candy melts you can buy, (usually in the cake decorating isle at the craft store) and it is really pretty to use vanilla flavored candy melts instead of the chocolate ones. And they come in a variety of colors!

I cannot BELIEVE how easy these are to make, and how amazing they look when they're done!  The hardest part about these chocolate pretzels is peeling open the kisses!  I think these would look great with an almond or nut on top too, I think.

Super quick and kids love them.  Kids can help too.  My version and now a huge favorite ("turtles")--caramel-filled kisses with pecan halves not M&Ms.  These will ooze so be sure to use the waffle pretzels. Tried candy cane kisses too (looked very festive) but mint not great with the salt.

These are delicious.  I am planning on giving them out as holiday gifts.  I know that my family will love these.  It is true what another reviewer stated...don't eat these when you are hungry.  I could have eaten half of these myself.  Thanks for the post.

Easy, tasty and wonderful. I used the new peanut butter kisses and WOW... really good. Am going to try the cherry cordial kisses next. Great easy treat that you can make in large masses. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

These looked cute, and would be a nice addition to a party tray, but the taste was just OK.  Used Hugs, and 2 minutes is a little too long ... M&M's wanted to slide off the first few I tried, until the chocolate had cooled a little.  (Tried a second time with the peanut butter filled kisses and they were much better ... almost like a Take 5 candy bar!)

These are wonderful party favors. I have found that the chocolate discs, found in most craft stores, work even better than the kisses.  (Plus they come in different colors). Reeces Pieces are great for fall, also.

These are very good and easy.  I couldn't find the round pretzels so I used the tiny twists, placed the kiss on top and heated in the oven.  Then I pressed a M&M into each hole of the pretzel, making 3 M&M's per pretzel.  They looked really cute.  I used plain Hershey kisses, and hugs.  The hugs melted a lot faster than the kisses, but they were both great.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

I got this recipe from a magazine for xmas and I tried it out just for fun. I loved it... my husband loved it (so did his co-workers) His boss asked for the recipe so that her son could make it because it tastes amazing and tastes like it takes awhile to make. For added effect I use (red, white, blue... or red and green) for the holidays. I also make sure that the logo is facing down. Try this with Hersheys Hugs.... it tastes even better!!!

What an easy recipe to make.  And quite tasty, too, I might add.  I used the round mini pretels, and A Rolo to make it a true "carmel turtle pretzel".  A final push into the melted Rolo with a pecan half.....it doesn't get much better than this!

These are a real treat, thank you for sharing it!  I found this method works best for me:  after pulling the pretzels out of the oven, I use the back of a spoon to flatten / smear the chocolate around a bit inside the ring, then I place the m&m in the center.  This way, the chocolate is sure to melt onto the pretzel and it does not drop out when cool. When I tried to use the M&M to spread the chocolate, it was a little messy.  Thanks again.

the recipe just did not work for me. the chocolate never melted - it just burned.  soooo, i used the microwave instead of the oven and that really did it.  i used waffle shaped pretzels and put the chocolate in the middle and set the microwave for 1 minute.  i used another pretzel on top to make a sandwich and cooled them in the fridge.  these were great.

I read all the reviews on how the chocolate kiss wouldn't melt. So instead of using them, I used chocolate chips and melted them in a microwave oven. I then spooned them into the pretzels and put the M&M on top. It was pretty easy. Some of the pretzels had more chocolate in them than others, and I did drip some....but I took them to my family Christmas Eve party and got rave reviews!! :)

Living in the Northeast I have yet to find "round pretzels".  My friend in Chicago is able to get round pretzels and she makes these all the time.  Instead of kisses she puts an M&M in each and uses white chocolate that she colors with food coloring for different holidays. These are always a hit at our office!  Good little treats!

I tried these wonderful pretzels last year at Christmas time and they were a hit with all my friends and guests.  I had a lot of requests for the recipe.  When you need that little bit of color on a cookie tray, these do the trick!

I can't give this any stars because the chocolate just burned up - it didn't melt.  Perhaps I need a more specific type of chocolate - kisses don't melt in my oven.  I was a bit bummed because it sounds delicious.

I’ve used this recipe for years as it was great for my young children to help make. This year I could only find butter flavored waffle pretzels. The butter flavor added an amazing wow factor! I will use them from now on! Also, based on another review, I decided to use Rollos topped with pecans. They received rave reviews and flew off the plate! Lastly, since I had only peanut m&m’s, I decided they may be good with peanut butter cups. I used a small peanut butter cup cut in half then added the peanut m&m on top. They were definitely yummy. The younger kids especially liked them!

Simple to make and everyone loves them!  Here's my tips . . . make sure you line the baking sheet with parchment paper.  If you don't, the melted chocolate sticks and you have to pry the pretzels off.  White chocolate melts quicker/gets softer than regular chocolate so it's best not to bake both kinds at the same time - do all white chocolate on one sheet and leave them in the oven maybe just one minute vs. the two minutes the regular chocolate needs.  I put almonds on top instead of M & M's.  And I want to try using Rollos instead of Kisses.

I used square pretzels too. I substituted a piece of Rolos candy for the chocolate kiss. Then instead of using M&Ms for the topping, I substituted a pecan half. It becomes a Turtle candy! Much tastier!

I did not add the M&M's so only used the chocolate kiss and pretzel.  Instead, I added another pretzel on top of the slightly melted chocolate.  I liked it better, but my husband said it killed some of the chocolate taste!!  Great, easy recipe for a quick dessert!

These were so quick and easy to make! When they were done, I put them in the freezer to set, and they were ready in 5 minutes. I used Utz wheels round pretzels, and I topped them with several combinations: Hershey's peppermint kisses with an M&M chocolate candy, Hershey's milk chocolate kisses with a candied cherry, and Rolos chocolate covered caramel candies with a pecan half. I put each one in a mini muffin wrapper before putting them on a tray. These were pretty and delicious!

I used to make this every Christmas. Hersey's kisses chocolate would melt in 3 minutes. Now, it just crumbles. Did some research and Hersey changed their recipe. If you want to make these you'll need to try a different type of chocolate. I don't think I want to eat chocolate that won't melt. I had them in the oven for 12 minutes...still didn't melt. Gross.

I used the Holiday Candy Cane Mint kisses and the holiday mint m&M.   
I also used the dark chocolate kisses with mint m&m.  Different melting times so use separate trays.  This is the perfect recipe for  kids in the kitchen.

Two minutes at 350F was plenty of time for the white "hugs" but the classic milk chocolate kisses took a little bit longer to soften to a point that they were squishy.  YUM!

I used small twisted pretzels with excellent results. My family gathers in the kitchen when I'm making these. Yes they are that good! I recommend that you moisten a paper towel on the counter next to you to rub your finger tips over to remove the remove the chocolate that accumulates each time you place an m&m on top.

Easy an tasty.  Made them with Vikings M&M's for a game day.  Will follow a suggestion and make them with Hershey's hugs and red and green M&M's for the holidays.  Will make a great, easy addition to a buffet!

Made with waffle pretzels, rolos, and pastel colored peanut M&Ms for an Easter potluck.  These are a fun candy snack.  Do note not to microwave these, as the chocolate will melt down through the pretzel.  It took about 3 to 4 minutes in the oven, and note that they get glossy. This tells you they are melted enough to place the candy.

When the outside of the kiss appears to melt and you try to add the candy the interior is still hard so the candy won't press into place. Or it just smears the kiss all over the pretzel and over the sides. Don't know how they achieved the perfection shown in the photograph.

I couldn't help but laugh reading "These are unlike any chocolate pretzel I have ever had before!" since the melted kiss/m&m pretzel has been a standard holiday treat for decades. I came here to see how hot and how long to soften but not puddle the chocolate and 2 mins at 350 was fine for both kisses and Dove.

For the low star ratings complaining about chocolate not melting, it did melt, it just didn't puddle under its own weight because it is heavily processed and there is a coating involved to keep it from sticking to the wrapper.

Kids loved making these!! We think using white chocolate striped kisses worked better for melting, adding the m&m on top and sticking to the pretzels. With these kisses they melted in about 1 1/2 minutes at 350 degrees. We made them in batches of 25 so when u take them out of the oven you have plenty of time to add the m&m before chocolate kiss starts to harden. Chilled in fridge for about 1 hour and they were ready.  Next year we will make them again but only use white striped kisses.

Round pretzels only seem to be in the stores during the Christmas holidays.   Other times of the year you can use the waffle pretzel.  The Hugs kisses melt after 2 minutes at 175 degrees.  The chocolate kisses do not lose their shape, and 2 minutes at 350 degrees seems to melt them enough to push the M&M into them.

I have made this many times.  I use the square pretzels, I get the chocolate baking discs, and I use the mint m&m's.  They are awesome.  Everyone loves them.  just don't leave the chocolate in the oven too long or it will dry out and crack.

I also used the square pretzels and had good results! I also found that using a mini Reese's peanut butter cup instead of the chocolate kiss was a good combination, too!

Super easy recipe that makes great Christmas gifts!

My favorite go-to when I need a large amount quickly ( non-messy is a plus!) I use the salted waffle looking pretzels. The only thing I do different is the oven temp and time. I think my electric stove isn't as powerful as other ovens. So I did 355 and left it in there for 2 minutes. I didn't see a time for the fridge, but I guess leaving it in there wouldn't be a big issue. I had one in there for 30 mins and it set nicely.
 Oh and for placing the m&m's, I placed the "m" face down so that it looks neater.

Me and my younger sister made these for Thanksgiving, and it's fantastic for an afternoon, and they came out just right. WE have a big family, and I know they will love it! cooking them for 2 minutes was just right. The Kisses might LOOK like they haven't cooked, but pressing the m&ms/other candy-coated-chocolates proved them not to be! WE placed the pretzels 8 across and 5 down, (40 total) and the was a perfect amount! 5 stars for sure!

I've made these many times with square pretzels, rollo candies and pecan halves.  Salty, sweet, chewy,  nutty covered in chocolate.

Tasty with sweet and salty.  Big hit with kids!  These were made for a birthday party and were quite time consuming to make.  I used square pretzels, chocolate Hershey kisses, and large peanut butter M&M's.  Very tasty and when cooled (as I put them in the fridge before packaging them up so that the chocolate gets a bit hard and not sloppy) very good.  You don't need to completely melt the kiss, only to make it soft enough so that the top of the kiss folds a bit.  You can then mush the kiss down a bit with the candy and then place in the fridge to hold in place and to be able to package.

I couldn't find small round pretzels, so I used small square ones.  I am a lover of dark chocolate, so I used dark chocolate kisses and dark chocolate M&Ms.  These went into a collection of candies for a sale at church and got rave reviews.  The only problem we encountered as we made these was that once you "sample" one, you don't want to stop!

This is a great little recipe to satisfy the salty/sweet craving. It's great to bring to a party or cookout when you don't know what else to bring. I like using the square pretzels (Snyder's Snaps) because there's more pretzel for the kiss to melt onto. Careful not to overheat the chocolate.  They are really easy, although don't get cocky- they can be a little time consuming because you have to put together each pretzel by hand, especially if you're making a large quantity.  Allow enough time to put together and chill!!!  The chilling is important!

These are pretty good and easily made in a toaster oven.  I used a setting of 175-200 degrees for about 2-3 mins.  As others have suggested, if you revise the recipe to use square pretzels, mini rolos and peanut butter m&ms, you have a 10 star combination.  Took these to a family reunion in both combinations and the revised version disappeared immediately.  The others eventually were all eaten.  You can't really beat chocolate and pretzels so have fun with combinations.  These are fast to pull together and look great on a serving tray.  Thanks for sharing!

I used regulate pretzel shaped pretzels and because my family are all peanut butter junkies I used the peanut butter M&M's. Turned out perfect.

I've been making these for years! I use mini rolo's instead of kisses because the caramel sets these little babies on cloud nine!  I always use the square pretzels as pictured...otherwise, the chocolate may melt thru to the pan. You can use peanut M&Ms as well for another flavor additive. Perfect for tailgating!

A student of mine gave me  this recipe many years ago. I still make them and have passed the recipe on to my nieces.  One niece makes them with Hershey Hugs and Reese Pieces.  Delicious!  We all use the Rold Gold square butter pretzels instead of round ones.

This is a super easy activity/recipe. The 350 temp and 2 minutes is perfect for setting the kiss and the M&M's. I had another recipe where it was a lower temp and longer bake time which is completely unnecessary. This is the perfect combo of salty/sweet!! Great for the holidays, too!

I saw this recipe in a couple of places with different oven temperatures and baking times. I could not get them to come out right until I saw the hint from  EAHUGHES who said she used 275 degrees for 2 minutes, Now they are perfect and I need to go buy more kisses! One suggestion - do not out them in the frig to cool because then the choco9late gets than funny whit color on them. Let them cool on the counter.

The oven temp on this recipe is way off.
Try a much cooler oven for melting the kisses.
This recipe was a big disappointment and a waste of several dollars worth of baking supplies

My wife and I made these the other night. Man am I going to gain weight! These are so simple and so good. Can't wait to try some of the variations that others have posted. Not sure what problems other people had, maybe they don't understand how chocolate holds its shape when it melts and over cooked it? We took the suggestion of one person and turned the oven down to 250 and baked them on parchment paper for 5 minutes. The waffle shaped pretzel snaps held the chocolate after it set perfect. AWESOME!!! We made an entire bag of pretzel in an hour. Yes, they are all gone!

Oh –these are easy – fast – fun and yummy. I used dark Hershey kisses – noticed someone used candy corn and I had peppermint candy corn, which was great using around Christmas. I ate . . . way too many.

These are great.  The temperature and timing is perfect.  It is a bit tedious and time consuming to have to unwrap all the kisses and also to press all the little smarties when you take them out of the oven.  But the sweet and salty mixture of the taste was worth it!

Of all the items I made for the holidays, this was everyone's favorite - kids, co-workers, neighbors.  It packages up and keeps beautifully!  I would advise storing in Tupperware or ziplock and not putting in the fridge as is discolored the chocolate kiss part.  Tried with peanut butter M&M's and separately with peppermint kisses, neither were as good as the original and my teens thought the peppermint ones were yucky.  This will be by #1 item from here on.

I could not find the square pretzels but the mini ones worked just fine. I used the white and chocolate kisses with the holiday M&M's. Thanks for this quick and delicious recipe..Yummy!

I live in NJ and we have UTZ Pretzels -- they make the round waffle pretzels (found in most any supermarket) They are perfect for this.  I use Hershey Hugs (black and white or the Peppermint Hugs (red and white). Yummy and looks pretty on the cookie tray!

These were fun to make... however, sit down before making these & take all the foils off the kisses.  That's what takes the longest... Eating is the quickest!!!  make more than you think you need, because you will need more

Oh my god, these are so good. I love that they are so easy to make and are a cute quick snack. I have already made them twice! Next time I will try using Rolo's, like another review had suggested.

I've made these the last couple of Christmases with the help of my 7 & 4 yr old. They love to help unwrap the kisses & place the m&ms. I've found that even though 2 min seems like a short time, don't put the milk chocolate kisses any longer or risk it being too melted or the pretzel burned. The white chocolate hugs are yummy too but require even less time (1 1/2 min), especially if the oven has been on for a while. Line the baking sheet with wax paper for easier clean up.

Looks like this recipe hasn't been reviewed for a long, long time.  Y'all are missing out on a fantastic chocolate/salty snack.   I used both regular and also peanut butter M&M's.  I pushed the M&M's into the chocolate with a straw as suggested by another reviewer.  And, like another reviewer, I also have to make another batch because we 'sampled' most of the first.  Awesome and so easy.  5 stars!  Thanks for sharing.

so easy and fun to make! my 4 year old son helped me with these and had lots of fun helping me. on my first try, i tried to smoosh down the m&m's as fast as i could after i took them out of the oven, but found that the first dozen or so, the candy didn't go down all the way. it was still a little hard. but by the time i got to the second dozen, the candy was going down more and they looked great. so on my second batch, i waited a couple minutes after taking them out of the oven before smooshing the candy in the center and they were all perfect. i took this to a family party and people were surprised that the recipe was so simple and easy. will probably be making these every christmas or anytime we need a quick easy chocolatey snack! i'll prob be trying different hershey kisses and candy next!

My mom has made these for years, but with a twist: We use Hershey Hugs instead of kisses. That way, it's not too milk chocolate-ly (if such a thing even exists!) with the M&M's. We call them Reindeer Eyes, and they're always a festive hit around the holidays. Tip: Place the cookie sheet outside if it’s chilly enough after you have placed the M&M's on the softened hugs. We always struggle to find enough room in our fridge. Plus, it will make the chocolate harden faster making it MUCH easier to take the candies off the cookie sheet. Such an addictive treat!

TIP: I make these a little different - melt chocolate almond bark in the microwave, pour it in a squeeze (like a clear ketchup type bottle).  Place the pretzles on waxed paper and squeeze the melted chocolate into the pretzles.  you can stop as you go to drop in the m&m's.  Works like a charm!

Got rave reviews from my co-workers!  This was amazingly simple. I made two batches, one with dark chocolate kisses that came out beautiful and one with caramel kisses which were messy but yummy.  The caramel kisses need to heat longers and the presentation isn't great but the taste is :)

Love this recipe but think the oven temp is too hot.  When I put the M&M's on to my pretzels( I used waffle ones), the candied shells would crack from the heat.  Also, I didn't use Hershey's Kisses - too much work to unwrap.  Save yourself some time and use the chocolate wafers.  Wegman's has them in the bulk section so I bought as much as I wanted.

I found small pretzels in the bulk section of the grocery store. I heated it 2 mins, another reviewer mentioned that candy kisses get shiny when they're ready to come out of the oven, but even then the kisses still weren't as melty as the picture. After a few candy coated chocos went on, they began to turn out better from the heat of the pan. After a while, it got a bit too melty - next time I will transfer them to a plate sooner. So easy to make and they taste great!! I will definitely make these again.

Outstanding & oh so addictive! I get rave reviews & requests for these all the time. I changed one thing. I use Reese Pieces. We love the hint of peanut butter. We have tried it with the M&Ms but prefer the Reese Pieces. Getting ready to make an enormous batch today for Christmas...mmmmmmm!

Well it doesn't get much easier than this!  My son and I enjoyed putting these together.  I used square pretzels and put them in the oven for 2 minutes at 300.  They taste great right out of the oven when the chocolate is all soft, but they are even better chilled.  I lined my baking sheet with foil for very easy clean-up.

So, I needed a quick treat to make for a next-day get together, and this looked great! (and it tastes great).   But somehow, I messed this up.   Yup!  Place. Heat. Squish. Sounds easy... Except the squish never worked!!  I found with the 350 temp, by the time the middles were warm, the outside was burned, and no longer worked for the adding the M&M part. But they still taste great :) I was able to fix this problem by using the microwave instead.   Now I need to go bake something challenging to make myself feel better for messing up this recipe...

We make these every Christmas! My daughter (now 5) has been helping me do these the last few years.  Kids can unwrap the kisses, put the pretzels on the cookie sheet, and put the kisses on the pretzels!  We started topping ours with pecan halves instead of the candy though, because we don't eat any artificial coloring, but now it's our family's preferred way anyway!

This was a huge hit at work! Everyone loved them! It was a little tedious putting the kisses on the pretzels and pressing the M&Ms on them, but it was worth it.

I thought these would be so easy and quick, they were easy to put together to put into the oven and nice because you can make as many or as little as you want but messy when puttinhg the candy ontop after they are out of the oven. my kids and me put peanut butter m&ms on top they tasted so so yummy but we got chocolate all over our fingers...We will make them again though cause there's no way to mess them up if you put them in the oven for the two minutes and take them right out!

wonderful and quick to make. I use dark chocolate kisses and they are perfect. I also used mini peanut butter cups because we had a lot from easter and they turned out even better. The only problem is that i cant stop eating them.

Very easy to make and tasted pretty good.  I made them for a St. Patty's Day party and used green M&M's.  I did find that when I went to take them off the cookie sheet after they had cooled that some of the kisses came off the pretzels.

I have been making this recipe for forever! It's a great one for the kids to help, but I suggest 4+ due to the speed needed once the pretzels & kisses come outta the oven.  I always get my round pretzels at WalMart, but they are a local brand...and the kisses fit almost perfectly.  You can also sprinkle on colored sugar while still warm.  I cover my trays with alum foil & after the m&m is added I put the trays right in the freezer!  With all the new kisses out there now (especially around holidays) there are a wide variety of options! I have even used the peanut butter kisses and put half a roasted peanut in the center instead of m&ms. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND as a great activity for the kids!

I used the square pretzels, peanut butter kisses and Easter colored M&Ms. Put them on parchment paper on the cookie sheet in a 250 degree oven for just 2 minutes. Chilled them for half hour in frig. They were all gone within 20 minutes, I made them for the kids but the adults ended up eating most of them. Great recipe and easy for the kids to help with. 6-25-2010 made them today but could not find the peanut butter kisses in the stores so used the plain chocolate, prefer the peanut butter but they still are great.

What better than double chocolate? Chocolate and peanut butter! I couldn't find seems not many people can, so like others I used square pretzels and I topped with a peanut butter M&M. 1 minute is perfect I left mine in 2 and the peaks of the kiss hardened a .bit forcing me to pull them off and eat them so I could push the M&M in..oh darn =). Everyone love these and the hardest part was unwrapping the kisses.

Had these a couple years ago and never knew how to make them.  I couldn't get over how easy they were to make.  So simple, yet so delicious!  I used Rolo candies in place of the Hershey Kiss only because I love chocolate and caramel.  I used salted mini-pretzels and loved the sweet and salty combination.  Family and neighbors thought they were bought from a candy shop!

Excellent!  I used normal twist pretzels - after reading how hard it is to find the round ones, I didn't even bother.  They worked just fine!  I also used the candy cane and mint truffle Hershey kisses - YUM!  Great coloring with the candy cane ones.  So easy to make and perfect for a snack.  Would definitely recommend!

I make these treats every year for the holidays.  A great variation are the Hershey Hugs.  I use Snyder Butter Snaps instead of a regular pretzel to give more of a smooth flavor.  My son loves to help me unrap each chocolate and we have a race to see who can get the most rows done!

one word:  ADDICTIVE!  i used the waffle pretzels with hugs and the kisses with the caramel in the middle.  i accidentally grabbed the peanut M&Ms but it turned out so yummy with that peanut crunch.  i took it to my son's 1st grade Christmas party and the kids chowed down.  will definately make these over and over again.

What a great "kid-friendly" recipe!  My 6 year old had a great time helping me make these.  We also tried the Rolo's with pecans and they were to die for (thanks for the suggestion)!!!  These were super easy to make.  YUM!!!  I will be making these again and again!

As a mom of five, this is a great, quick, easy recipe that the kids can practically do all by themselves!  I always use Snyder's Snaps for the pretzels as I have never found round ones. We love to make these during the holidays using the green and red M&M's. Since we are peanut butter lovers  we have also used Peanut M&M's and Peanut Butter M&M's (the Peanut Butter ones are  my favorite!!)

I have been making these for years. I am not a big M&M fan, so I make them with the waffle pretzels, then I use carmel filled kisses.  I use a butter knife, spray it with cooking spray and smoosh down the kiss after it has been heated.  It is a pretzel with chocolate and carmel.  Perfection!

Super easy.  Mindless cooking for the holidays!  I gave these as holidays gifts for coworkers and everyone loved them.  I made them with caramel kisses and special dark kissess.  The dark chocolate takes a little longer in the oven-- more like 3 minutes.  I liked the pretzel sandwiches the best.

These are a great Christmas treat. They are super fast and the kids can help out with them. I made them with Hugs and an M&M on top and Rolos with a pecan on top. They both turned out yummy!

I live in the South and went to five different grocery stores and could not find the round pretzels.  I was disappointed, but, I must say, the pretzels are just as cute and just as tasty when you use the grid (or "snap") shapes.  To experiment with another variation, I tried "candy cane" flavored kisses with an m&m on top--delicious!  They are definitely addicting!

You have got to try these!  These treats are so fun to make and the easiest thing ever.  I love the sweet and salty mix.  I used peanut butter M&M's and mixed with hugs and regular kisses.  You can't possibly mess this up!

Like some of the other reviewers, I couldn't find the circle pretzels.  I used the square "waffle" kind.  They turned out very cute and the kids loved to help.  I am sure I will make these a couple times a year, they are really cute with holiday color m&ms.  Right now was perfect for halloween mix m&ms, yum!

Very easy and well received by a bunch of teens.  used waffle shaped pretzels and Dove milk chocolate squares. Topped with a peanut butter M&M.  Put my son to work unwrapping the chocolates...

12/12/09  I just made these again using the new Doves Peanut Butter chocolates.  Took a little experimenting to avoid total meltdown!  The Doves peanut butter chocolates melt super easy.  I wound up only putting in the oven for 50 seconds at 250 degrees.  Had a couple batches that totally melted until I figured it out.

I just made this recipe with yellow m&ms for a Saints game (the black and gold) party.  It took about 3 batches to get the chocolate melted just right.  They sure are cute.

note: when using white chocolate kisses they melt faster than either regular or carmel kisses.  I had regular and white chocolate kisses on the same pan, and the white ones were almost liquid, while the regulars were not quite melty enough.  thanx i love this recipe, i have made it 4 times in the past week and it is always a hit! :)

I've made this recipe for years and everybody always loves them. My favorite way to make them is with Resse's peanut butter cups in the middle and then the m&m on top. I've also used Rolos and kisses too. They're so easy to make and you can match the colors of m&m's that you use to whatever kind of event you're celebrating.

These are great as is 'for the chidren'. When I make them for the adults, I use dark chocolate kisses and cashews. Sweet and salty!  I put them in the toaster oven on a foil lined baking sheet at 250 degrees for about 4 minutes.  When they come out I put the cashew on and gently push it down a little. I let them cool completely before removing from the foil, so I transfer the foil to a cooling rack and then make another batch. They get snapped up off the cookie tray quickly.

I am a huge fan. These are great little snackers! My husband, however, doesn't care for them. Good thing is, I found one thing to make that I can enjoy that I know he won't get his hands into. :)

Ladies, you have posted some beautiful pictures. I can't wait to make this recipe for our annual Christmas cookie bake sale.  I made a similar recipe last year with Rolos and pecans, but the beauty of these pretzels blows mine away.  I especially like the Hershey's Hugs photos. Thanks for the inspiration!

Another idea.  I used mini snickers cut in half - placed them on waffle pretzels, warmed in the oven same as this recipe till soft. When I removed them from the oven - I placed a pecan half on top. They disappeared fast.  These may stick if placed on parchment paper - I put them right on the cookie sheet.

These were the best! I wish I had made more though. Next time I want to try some of the different flavored kisses and M&M's, like maybe mint chocolate. I used square pretzels because I couldn't find the round type. Thanks!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  My 2 little guys (4 & 6 yrs) helped me make these for their Valentine's Day parties at school.  They had so much fun and are SO proud that they made the treats themselves!!!!!  Thank you for the recipe.
FYI - We used Valentine M&M's in red,pink and white with square waffle pretzels.  Perfect & Yummy!!

I made these for a cookie swap party. Now my family makes me make them once a week. This week though I used caramel filled kisses and used a roasted peanut instead of the M&M. They are always a hit.

I didn't have M&M to top it off, instead I halved Marischino cherries, and placed on top. Adds a special flavor.

YUMMY!! I raised my oven rack up to the highest shelf. This kept them from burning on the bottom. Also, I have had good luck finding the round pretzels at Walmart. They are the Seyfert's brand and are called Beer Pretzel-O's.

EASY and yummy!! Leave in the oven only a couple of minutes and then use the M&M to push down the top of the kiss. Then pop in the freezer for 10 or so minutes to harden. Perfect for a quick gift and a totally addictive snack!!

Fantastic.  I did some with rolos some with kisses.  All were yummy!  There are SO many flavors of kisses now.  I have to try again with different types.

Great idea!  I found mini pretzels worked just fine. I used hot cocoa filled kisses and dark chocolate kisses.  Both worked well and melted perfectly.  Quick, easy, and festive!

This was a very quick and easy treat to make. The only problem I had was when I attempted to push the M&M down into the Hershey Kiss or Hug. Instead of the chocolate being smooth around the M&M it was cracked. After reading the other reviews I may try using Rollos or some other type of flat melting chocolate. Overall very good taste!

I love this fun recipe. I've never done it with hugs or any other flavored kisses, I bet that would be good. The only annoying thing is unwrapping each kiss, but it's worth it. I love this mix of sweet and salty.

My boyfriend and I were looking for something fun to do, and we came across this tasty little recipe! It was SO easy to make, and we had a great time together. Our families enjoyed snacking on them all day the next day, plus we had a lot of left-over M&Ms to eat. Adorable, tasty, and simple.

The kids really liked this. They used the toaster oven to make them and then when they felt like a few more they just popped them in the toaster oven. A good quick snack. Thanks.

I made some of these a few years ago and they have since become a Christmas must have.  I usually make them with Hugs instead of Kisses and square pretzels.

I made these and gave them away as little Christmas treats! I used semicircle chocolates that you can get in bulk and got the ones with sprinkles on top! This made for a more decorative look and only placed some with red and green M&M's and some with peacons on top. I also use square pretzles.

I made these with hugs and holiday M&M's.  I found Jay's circle pretzels at the grocery store and used them.  The only problem I had was taking the cooled treats from the cookie sheets without breaking the pretzels.  I tried spraying the pan with cooking spray but the chocolates were tough to get off.  All in all, tasty and easy.  Cook them a little longer than you think.

Very easy, cute, and tasty!  No mess, which is what I like.  I used Hugs with small (~1/4") segments of candy cane on top, and Caramel Kisses with pecan halves on top.

I was inspired by the photo and used Hershey's Hugs.  What a beautiful result! My only other tip is to make sure you place the candy with the M&M print down so it looks prettier.  My kids LOVED these.  I have to make another batch because they were gone the same day.  This one is definitely a keeper.  It's a really easy and beautiful addition to a holiday cookie tray.  Try it!!!

These are great.  I used holiday shaped pretzels (trees and stars only, the bells holes were too big). I used hugs, peanut butter, chocolate, and caramel kisses, and drizzled white chocolate over all but the hugs.  They were excellent!

This recipe is quick and painless.  The results are an addicting treat that taste great.  I have made these for years and often give them as hostess gifts when visiting around the holidays.  Store them in glass jars and tie a bow around for a last minute present!

My daughter loves chocolate pretzels...so I made her up a batch of these, using square waffle pretzels. To be honest, I wasn't too happy w/ the texture of these. I think next time, I may try  placing a few chocolate chips on them instead of the kiss. Thansk Mel!

I think this recipe is great! I do have one suggestion though, instead of using regular kisses, try hugs (white and milk chocolate). They seem to justthat something special.

Quick, easy and a huge hit at a recent potluck!  My Halloween themed chocolate covered pretzels disappeared long before any of the store bought cookies and snacks.  I used waffle pretzels and a black and an orange M&M on each pretzel.  YUM!

I was discouraged because I thought the kisses would melt.  My son had seen these before and said they look different.  Could you use different chocolate?

I also like to make these with hugs instead of kisses.  The blend of the white chocolate and milk chocolate is nice.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I make dozens of these and give them as Christmas presents in tins.
