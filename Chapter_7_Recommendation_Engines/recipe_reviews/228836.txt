This was easy and tasty. Plus you can add some mushrooms, chicken, sausage or little meatballs to make it even better. I like the fact you can make it ahead of time and heat it up when you want it.

good recipe we'll make it sunday and have it ready in the fridge for a weeknight meal.  I've always had trouble finding the specific cooking creme the recipe calls for so this last time i dumped a small container of flavored cream cheese in and added some extra tomato sauce to think it out.  Not sure if you all have this problem too but i can only find frozen cheese tortellini in 19oz and not 16oz (like the recipe calls for) so i just use the whole 19oz bag (don't want to waste) and add a little bit more sauce.  I usually have extra sauce because i can't find 8oz pasta sauce so it works out just fine.  And last i don't bother buying the kraft 4 cheese blend i just use the store brand mozz.  It's cheaper, has more use for the other cheese you don't use & tastes just fine to me.  Overall very happy with the recipe and it's in our rotation

Good recipe.  I assembled the casserole day before so all I had to do was bake on the night I had company.  A great time saver.
