Here's what you need to do to make these more authentic.... In step one, omit the lettuce, as it will only get soggy anyway. Instead of adding your dill pickle slices at the end of the recipe, chop them up along with the onion and tomatoes and add them here. After you let it sit and marinate in the fridge for an hour or so, you get this super delicious relish type of spread for your subs. Its the perfect match for the real Italian cold cuts! Don't skimp on the quality of the meat here either. Its well worth the extra money to buy the good stuff. I brought these to a party and they were quickly devoured. I'm originally from Boston where you can always get a great Italian sub at any one of the many "Mom & Pop" delis. However, I now live in the mid-west and you cannot find a decent Italian sub here! Some places actually use ham and bologna, and call it Italian!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU and THANKS AGAIN for this recipe! For me its like a little taste of "home"!!!

This is almost exactly how my mom used to make these when I was growing up!  The only difference was that she would marinate the lettuce, tomato, onion mixture overnight, and she would put the subs under the broiler to melt the cheese before she put the salad mixture onto the subs.  Try it - you'll LOVE them hot!

This was awesome.  The salad mix rocks.  I tweaked the sandwich a bit but left the dressing and salad mix the same.  I like to buy a loaf of french bread cut it open, spread butter/margerine and garlic salt on both halves put the cheese on the bottom then throw it under the broiler until the cheese is melted.  I also used mozzarella cheese slices.  Then I constructed the sandwich with ham, turkey, genoa salami, and sandwich size pepperonis, then put the salad mix on top, Closed it up, sliced it to meet our family needs and served with baked chips and a cookie.  It rocked.  The salad mix does make the sandwich. Thank you.

OH MY GOD!!! My husband is from Boston and when I told him I was making Italians at home he wasn't too jazzed. Man, did he change his tune! We live in FL now, so it's not as easy to get a quality sandwich here as it is back home. 
I left out the lettuce for fear it would get soggy, and added it at the end. I used ham, capicola, and salami. Totally awesome.....thanks a million!
BTW: this dressing (minus the lettuce) makes an awesome topping for bruchetta

This is a five star recipe because it is so easy to tailor to your own tastes. I made a few changes; when making the "salad" portion, I decreased the garlic, left the lettuce out until the final prep, and I also did not feel it needed to be refrigerated. I also only let it sit for 15 min. while I prepped the remaining ingredients. I also added salt and pepper to the dressing. Instead of Proscuitto, I chose Mortadella. Like other reviewers, I like to heat the broiler and give the sandwich just a minute to melt the cheese. I also like the bread to have either mayo or butter on it. I left out the Dills and serve it with Pepperocinis. In any case, this recipe has everything to recreate your favorite Italian Deli Sub.

Don't let the salad sit for more than the recommended hour--it turns a solid, pasty, inedible mess.  I guess the oil congeals or something.  Once I redid it and watched the time, we thought these were pretty good!

Wow - these definitely are "Restaruant" quality Italian subs! I mean why order out when you can make these yourself at home with fantastic results. The only thing I did differently was to use crisp iceberg lettuce vs. red leaf lettuce but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. These are a great way to beat the summer heat on nights when it's just too hot to make anything else!

YUM! I opted to toast my sandwich before putting on the 'salad' mixture and pickles. The salad is fantastic, and if you're thinking of skipping the pickles...DON'T, they add such a wonderful flavor to this. I did use shredded iceberg lettuce and vidalia onion because that's what I had. We were very happy with dinner tonight. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe! Great sandwich! I made enough for 10 people. My guests literally inhaled the subs. However I did substitute the Prosciutto with Italian grilled ham. It is similar in appearance to Prosciutto but not nearly as dry; itâ€™s more kid friendly.

I did enjoy this. I was starving and in a rush to eat this so I didn't marinate the salad. I used sandwich thins for the bread, brushed it with the dressing added the meats and cheese and then toasted it. Then I added the tomatoes and more dressing, I forgot the pickles and purposely left off the the lettuce. I really enjoyed the meats and cheese, feel like the dressing needed a little more flavor. I will make it again and add more season to the dressing, and the pickle.

I have made these twice now and my husband and I LOVED them both times. I bought sub buns from the bakery the first time. Last night I made them again and bought a loaf of French bread. I spread butter on the top and bottom of bread and sprinkle with garlic powder and toast under broiler until brown. Then I put in ham, hard salami, and sandwich pepperoni and put cheese on top. Then I place under broiler again with just the bottom half with the meat to melt the   cheese. I chop the lettuce with a knife, and add my cupped tomatoes and chopped red onion and mix together with the dressing as stated.   I don't add any pickles to my sandwich. Sometimes I will let the   dressing sit with the lettuce mix for an hour or just eat right away. I   have never had a problem with my lettuce getting soggy as other   people have stated. I even save it and we eat it the next day for   more subs.  I do add banana peppers to my sandwich too. These   were very yummy!!!

I just knew I would love this recipe. However, it was just ok to me. I followed the recipe pretty close as it's written. The only thing I did differently was add the lettuce at the end instead of mixing it in with the dressing. I also added more oregeno, that was just a personal choice because I love it. I didn't really care for the meat except the genoa salami which I love. We also heated the sandwich with the meats and cheese in the broiler before adding the other ingredients. Not a bad sandwich it just didn't blow me away. I won't be making this again.

Very good!  I had troublw with sogginess on the bottom of the bread, so next time I will toast it a little before assembling the sandwich.  We didn't have all the correct meats at the store so I just used genoa salami, pepperoni and ham.  turned out great.  Thanks!

I made a couple changes because of what was available, ham and peperoni instead of sausage and prosciutto, banana peppers instead of pickles and i did not soak my lettuce in the sauce. i also toasted my sandwich. what i ended up with is one less reason to eat out. this is as good or better then anything i've gotten out, i can't wait to try it with the right kinds of meat. thanks for the recipe!

D E L I C I O U S ! ! !  I left the mix overnight in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, to make my sandwiches in the morning, worked just fine! Make sure your bread surface is large enough for all the meats and toppings or they'll fall out!!!

Great sub to take on picnics but hold the dressing until you are ready to serve. I agree with the post who changed the sliced pickles for sliced pickled banana peppers. They compliment the sub nicely.

This was pretty good - not exactly authentic but a nice taste of Italian when far away from the northeast. Skip the lettuce and use dill relish.

This sub was DELICIOUS! I did exactly as the recipe called and loved it that way. The dressing that we made to put on top of the lettuce/tomato/onion mixture was amazing, it might be my new homemade dressing for our everyday tossed salad!! THANKS FOR THIS AMAZING RECIPE!

It was great! I think I used a little too much lettuce but it was still delicious. I heated mine under the broiler for just a minute as well.

This is really good.  I have never had a "true" Italian sandwich before.  Being from the mid-west.  But, these are fabulous.  My husband who only ate the meats, cheese and lettuce with dressing loved it.  Of course it was even better with all of the toppings for my sandwich.  We didn't have every ingredient couldn't get the sausage in the local store, but was still a sandwich my picky husband was very happy to eat.

This is a great recipe.  Our only change was to leave out the pickles and use mild banana peppers instead as our family loves them.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for posting.

Broil the rolls with cheese first and no need to add the lettuce into the spread until placing on the sandwich itself. This is a keeper.

Delicious. I used shredded ice berg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sliced white onion (all I had), and sliced banana peppers. I skipped the second olive oil and vinegar because I was using Southwest Dipping Sauce from this site. I used big slices of pepperoni and salami and deli sliced ham. Toasted just long enough for the cheese to melt. Yummy Yummy!!

This is one Awesome Sub! I couldn't find some of the meats, so I used a combination of genoa salami, pepperoni, and ham. I also used Creamy Italian Dressing, which my kids prefer. Next time I'll make some of the subs, using the dressing listed in the recipe.I also toasted the subs. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I made this with two types of vegetarian deli "meat" (Yves Salami and Tofurky Italian style). Added a bit of Parmesan, mayo, and black pepper and it was perfect. :D

Great Italian sandwich!  I used all the ingredients except the dill pickle and put it on AR recipe:  Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls.  I split and toasted the buns a little, added the rest of ingredients and toasted in the toaster oven.  The results were a great tasting and very filling sandwich.  This was wonderful paired with a simple salad and a glass of wine.  Thanks John for sharing.

Couldn't find capacola, so used regular ham instead. The onions seemed a little strong to me. Overall, a pretty good sub.

Really really good! Followed directions exactly and we were pleasantly surprised on how good these were. Used a full baguette loaf split in half.  Even 2 days later after wrapping tightly in plastic wrap, I enjoyed the rest of mine for lunch.  Thanks for posting this because hubby and I are sandwich lovers and this has now become a fav!

The sub sauce recipe rocks! I make it in a jar and let it set in the fridge. I use all ingredients listed but put shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and sliced onion on roll first, then pour sauce on, add meat and top with cheese..Excellent!..If you let them sit wrapped in plastic in fridge for a few hours...even better! Hubby makes me add mayo to his, but not necessary

Great Recipe!  I did not mix the lettuce in with the tomatoes and onion because I didn't want it to get soggy in the relish like mix.  I put it on last and it was a nice and crisp addition.  Also, we used pita's because they were easier to make at our picnic.  They were really good!  (Also, i cut up WICKLES and tossed them in with the red onion and tomato mix.  If you haven't heard of them they are delicious pickles-ask for them in your grocery store)

Pretty good! Made these for a quick dinner last Fri. eve. My fiance usually plays softball on Fri. Last week's game was sch. to begin at 9:15 PM, so I was planning to have dinner at home 1st b4  we left for the game. B/c my fiance doesn't like to play on a "full" stomach, he asked that I prepare something light. Unfortunately, it rained all day, so his game was cxl. I had already bought all of the stuff to make subs, so we had them anyways. I pretty much followed John's direct. to the ltr., except for a few changes. First, I subbed mortadela - (w/o pistachios - yuck!) - for prosciutto since it was WAAAY cheaper to do so (prosciutto at my local Italian market was $6.99/lb; mortadella was only $2.99!). I also lightly brushed my sub rolls w/ a mix. of melted butter & garlic powder, broiled for a min. or so to toast, topped w/ meats/cheese & then broiled just until the cheese was melted. We also topped our subs w/ a little mayo and TONS of the YUMMY salad (it's the best part IMHO). To prevent my lettuce from wilting, I mix. all dressing ingredients, onion & tomato about an hr. b4 serving & then added the lettuce during the last 1/2 hr. Perfect! Served w/ kettle chips, Nabisco soft oatmeal raisin cookies & old fashioned cream sodas to wash it all down. Thanks for sharing your idea, John :) This is definitely cheaper than any of the sandwich chains in my area (and a dead on copy to boot!!!)!

This was really good. So much better than Subway's sandwiches. I used a loaf of French bread, added pepperoni, and marinaded the tomato and onion in the olive oil mix. My husband prefers his sandwiches dry so he didn't care for the dressing but liked the sandwich, my son thought the olive oil was too strong. What a filling and tasty meal all in one. Thanks!

Oh My!!!  These were fabulous! I had eaten a half of one before even getting to the table to eat.  For the tomato, onion mixture, I followed one reviewers advice to "make it more authentic" (don't know if it was or not) to add the pickles chopped up.  I did marinade the tomato mixture for a few hours.  I did not add the lettuce until 1 hour before serving so that it wouldn't get too soggy.  After assembling subs I did throw the bottom half under the broiler quickly to melt the cheese.  We are still talking about it the next day.  So yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT!  If you like true italian tasting sub sandwiches, this recipe is it.  I used all the meats called for in this recipe for authentic italian taste.  My only change was romaine lettuce chopped instead of the red leaf as that is what I had on hand.  I also broiled the sandwich slightly with the cheese before adding the dressing/lettuce.  The dressing was very tasty!  My kids dont care for the capacola so the 2nd time I made them I left it off of theirs and they like it better that way.  This is a keeper!

Really great recipe. I doubled the dressing and really didn't need to at all.  Let the onion and tomato marinate for 5 hours before dinner.  Added the lettuce at the last minute to keep it crispy.  My family loved it.

This is quite delicious. I made a few changes to suit the tastes of the people I was feeding (and myself). I used red wine vinegar instead of white, and it worked just fine. Italian seasoning replaced the other herbs in the recipe (I didn't have all of them so I just went with Italian - also worked just fine). Like others, I added the chopped lettuce to the mixture when it came out of the fridge as opposed to when it went in. The biggest change I made was to microwave butter and chopped garlic for a nice creamy garlic butter and then spread this all over the bottom half of the sliced French bread. I then covered this in provolone cheese and broiled until it was melted. As a finishing touch, I added a helping of homemade roasted red peppers to the sandwich and served with pepperoncinis. Delicious!

Never heard of dill pickle slices on an Italian sub, I know people ask for it from time to time but I have never seen it on a list of Ingredients from any sub shop. Without that this is a perfect Italian sandwich.

This sandwich is absolutely as good as any served in a restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly and thought the marinade was outstanding. You must definitely use the Italian meats listed. The only thing that I recommend is to not put the lettuce in with the tomato and onion. I used fresh tomatoes, Italian parsley, and basil from my garden which made it better. This is a sandwich I will definitely make again.

All my husband kept saying while eating this was..."Oh, my heavens - that's a good sandwich!"  I made the relish exactly as stated.  I didn't have a problem with the lettuce wilting and it was really good. I did only use 1/2 a head of red lettuce instead of the full head.   I used genoa salami, large pepperoni slices, & ham instead of the listed meats because that is what my husband prefers.  Next time though - I will use the three meats the recipe calls for.  It was REALLY good and I will definitely be making this again.

Really excellent recipe!! Made them for my boyfriends road trip on whole wheat baguettes- fantastic. The dressing is the best part, I think you could use any type of meat and i would taste great. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

The tomato relish, I will call it is awesome.  I'd prefer different meats perhaps but the dressing and veggies are so good!  Thanks for this recipe, the whole family loved it.

Really good! I added mortadella & peppercini's.  Shredded the lettuce and added at the end. These are perfect for parties! If you don't have time to make the dressing, use Beano's brand submarine dressing. It's really good!

Made these a few weeks back for a Seahawks game watching party and everybody loved them! Right before leaving the house, I assembled the sandwiches, wrapped them in foil, then slice them at the party.  They were great, thanks so much for the recipe.

Yum!  I made as recipe states.  I usually make this same sandwich, but with mayo/mustard - this is a classy & delicious step up!  My husband liked it pretty well too (minus the onion & tomato).  Next time I am thinking I will also add olives to the veggie mixture.  Thanks for the submission!

Yummy. This was so good. I love the lettuce mixture. I used ham, mortabella, and pepperoni for my meats. I also skipped the pickles and used bannana peppers. I will be making again. Thanks for posting.

We liked these a lot. I followed the recipe exactly but put the sandwiches under the boiler to melt the cheese before putting on the salad mixture & didn't use a tomato. We didn't use all the salad mixture, there was too much, next time I'll make half of it. These sanwhiches were huge, I would recommed halving the recipe but keeping the number of sandwhiches the same. Thanks John.

I only made the dressing part of this recipe, and it was delicious.  Our subs had basically the same ingredients, but we varied them for individual tastes.  We did as the recipe said, and added the salad to the dressing before we put it on the sandwiches instead of adding the dressing directly to the sandwich.  Yum.  thanks for sharing!

Made these for lunch today and they are delicious! I can't wait to make these again! I like slicing the red onion into very thin rings. Used garlic from the jar.  I did not pour the dressing mixture over the vegetables for one hour, just right on the veggies on the sandwich right before eating. Thank you.

A favorite at our household - we sometimes switch out the meat and we like to toast ours under the broiler before adding the veggies and dressing.

I've made this for a few super bowl parties and it's always a big hit. The topping is quite strong so you may want to tame down the garlic a little if you're a little wimpy. :)

Great recipe.  The salad is great but I am going to try the user's suggestion of replacing the lettuce with chopped pickle.  The meats are perfect.  If you normally like hot peppers in your sub, I'd put a little more red pepper flakes or add some red hots on top of the salad.  Make sure you use fresh hoagie rolls, the bread can make or break the sub.

This was very god, though I wan't a fan of the overly wet lettuce/tomato/onion combo. Next time, I might be inclined to just mix the olive oil and other stuff, and drizzle it over the lettuce and some sliced onions and tomato.   Also, the ingredients are rather expensive, so much so that you can almost get a restaurant sub for close to this price.   Next time, I'm going to experiment with different mixes of meats, including mortadella, sporessata and pepperoni.  But, all told, it's a good eat.

These subs are SO good!  The yummy dressing is what gives this recipe its great flavor.  I've made these subs many times, sometimes leaving out the onion if I don't have it, using various types of lettuce, and sometimes substituting ham for capacola, but the results have always been delicious.  Thanks, John, for sharing this recipe!

Subs were great, my husband devoured them and said "you can make these anytime". The dressing was fantastic, and I didn't change anything. Laurie

This recipe was great! My family loved it! I used the shredded taco lettuce, it works really well with the dressing..

This is THE recipe for Italian Subs. The dressing is superb. I definitely think the white wine vinegar was important. I subbed it out the first time I made this and didn't love it as much. I find it best to slice the onions and tomatoes as thin as possible. I used mild banana peppers and did not soak the lettuce in the dressing. Wrapping them securely in first wax paper then foil helped keep them together. The flavors melded beautifully making the leftovers just as amazing!

Premium recipe. Didnâ€™t really change a thing, except offered Grey Poupon and mayonnaise for my guests. Used assorted cold cuts and cheese. (cheaper at Costco)

Amazing recipe!! This is one of my favorite sandwiches to order at restaurants and this one rivals them all!! I made a few changes: 1. Added salt, pepper, and sliced pepperoncini to the salad marinade and used iceberg lettuce instead of red lettuce. Only marinated for 45 minutes. 2. Used fresh mozzarella cheese rather than provolone cheese. And used premade Italian meat sampler and whole wheat hoagies. 3. Broiled the sandwiches prior to adding the salad marinade. We will definitely be making this for guests and dinners in the future!!

I'm from Philadelphia and it's hard to find the proper sub rolls on the West Coast, it seems. The method for assembling is good, however. The overall quality seems to depend on the quality of the meats.

The marinade along with the red leaf lettuce, red onion and tomatoes was fabulous. When I make it again, I will cut back on the quantity of tomatoes (one would be fine) and red onion. There was way too much of these and I ended up throwing a lot of it away.

I would also appreciate knowing the size of the submarine rolls.

This sandwich is a real keeper!

Great sandwich! My husband and I love this. I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table (short on time), so the veggies did not get to marinade but about 15 minutes. From reading other reviews, I did not add the lettuce to the veggies because I did not want wilted lettuce. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will make it again and maybe add some sliced black olives to the veggie mix as well. As others wrote it is worth going with the better quality meats.

Made these versatile subs for a Daytona 500 Party. I used spinach for the lettuce. Definitely worth making again.

My wife said, "This is better than [insert well-known casual restaurant]!" Yes, the meats are expensive and somewhat difficult to find depending on where one lives, but per unit each sandwich will still cost less than purchasing a similar sandwich at a restaurant, and they are absolutely delicious. It is easy to tailor to taste, too.

I substituted mortadella and sandwich pepperoni for the capicola and prosciutto. I went with diced banana peppers instead of pickles. I really loved this recipe. So easy and exactly like I was expecting. Thank you.

I marinated the tomatoes and onions slices only in the herb dressing, my tomatoes were so juicy I was afraid to chop them up or they'd turn to soup. Don't really like Capacola, but fine deli ham tasted fine. The dressing was very tasty and reminded me of the hoagies we got in Philly when my mom took us there. I never liked the soggy lettuce on them back then and so I knew to add it last. Great easy summer night meal...just add some chips.

Thank you for an awesome recipe John! My son is eating a lot later than us so I did not add the lettuce to the onion and tomato mixture so it will not get soggy. We just put the lettuce leaves on the sandwiches. We also toasted the buns and cheese. My husband who is from the east coast loved it and it will definitely be in our rotation of meals. Quick, easy and delicious!
