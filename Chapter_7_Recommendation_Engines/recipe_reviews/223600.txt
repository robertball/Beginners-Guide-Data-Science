This coffee cake was AwEsOmE! Moist, creamy and just enough sweet. I used plastic sandwich bags across my fingers when working with the dough to spread it up the sides and again I used one to hold the jam, snipped an end off and piped the jam onto the cream cheese filling. Baked up pretty and I was proud enough to bring it into work to share. This cake was very well received! Kinda like the famous one by "E" but so much better because it's fresh. I used lower fat cream cheese and sour cream with no problems. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

UPDATE: I have made this several times now and wanted to share a tip for working with the sticky dough. Spoon the dough out of the processor placing clumps around in the greased springpan. Lay a piece of plastic wrap, big enough to cover the the pan and more, on the counter and spray generously with Pam. Place wrap over pan, Pam sprayed side against dough, and work the dough out flat and up the sides. The wrap will pull right off with no mess and the dough will be nicely shaped! Also, put the preserves in a baggie and warm gently in warm water. Snip a corner and squeeze the jam onto the dough in circles. Makes it easier to spread out. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bellepepper made this for Recipe Group and recommended it to me. All I can say is, "Wow!", this was really wonderful. I made it the day before, wrapped and stored in the frig. I took it out about an hour before serving, put an almond drizzle over it (confectioner's sugar, a bit of milk and  few drops of almond flavoring) and garnished with fresh raspberries around the top and and plate. I haven't, and wouldn't change a thing, other than to try different jams. This is a keeper! Thank you!!

This is a terrific coffee cake. It's moist and flavorful. Love the almond extract. It took longer than an hour for mine to bake in the center when the outer crust was getting dark. It turned out fine. I used Blueberry Sauce, a recipe from AR, instead of the raspberry jam. Drizzled white icing on it made with confectioners sugar and milk. Great Cake!

Made this for Recipe Group...LOVED IT! The biggest pain for me was trying to 'spread' the batter in the pan, but I just kept spraying my hand w/ cooking spray and that helped. Also, as far as trying to spread the filling over the cheese layer, I just spooned small dollops all over the top (I may have used a bit more preserves than called for b/c I didn't measure it), and that worked out great. This was not too sweet, but just right, perfect amount of cheese, raspberry and dough, IMO. This was wonderful w/ the raspberry preserves, but I can't wait to try it w/ other fruit flavors. This is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a keeper. Whole family enjoyed it. It's a little time consuming. I used a can of raspberry Solo filling found in the baking isle. I used an angled spreader to smear out the dough, then cc filling, then raspberry filling, worked great. I had to count the carbs for our family so from my guesstimating it was roughly 400 carbs for the entire dish.

This was a great coffee cake that my boyfriend called "outstanding" and said I could sell it:). I noticed that some reviewers must have thought they had to cook this until there was absolutely no jiggle in the filling, and they ended up with dry overbrowned cake.  DO NOT OVERBAKE. The filling will finish setting as it cools, like all cream cheese fillings-just bake until the cake is done.  I actually cooked mine for 48 minutes (my springform has a glass bottom so I can make sure it is totally done and a nice golden brown). It was cooked perfectly.  (By the way- I printed this recipe out in 2011 and it did not have "bake until set" in it--thankfully).  I preferred it at room temperature by far. When serving, the chilled dough layer was a bit too dense for me (It worked well to chill it slightly at the beginning, then to bring it out well before I wanted to serve it).I had reduced the almond extract, but everyone loved the almond flavor so I think I will put the full amount in next time (also, in 2011, the amount of almond extract was 1 1/2 teaspoons). Next time may try to change  the bottom layer just a little, perhaps adding an agg to make it less dense like bread and fluffier like a cake. I added some vanilla bean paste to the cream cheese layer and it was great to see and taste those little flecks. I also added a simple powdered sugar glaze to some of the cut pieces, but like it better without-it's sweet enough!I will definitely make this one again. Thanks!

Well, its in the oven as I write this. This was a tricky recipe for me. I found spreading the dough was a sticky mess, even oiling my fingers and using the wrapper from the butter. I wound up wetting a serving spoon and that finally worked for me. I sure hope it doesn't affect the rising of the cake with the extra moisture/water. Also, I was tempted to put preserves on the batter and then pour the cream cheese mixture over. But I followed the recipe instead, and it was such a mess trying to spread 1/2 cup preserves over. I am sure the preserve layer won't be as pretty, because it mixed too much with the cream cheese layer when spreading.

Outstanding! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. My boss brought this in for us this morning and I must say it's the best coffee cake I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe with us - and thank you Angie for making it!

Recipe Group Selection:  11, August 2012 Yum, Yum, Yum. This coffee cake is wonderful! I made as written using my new springform pan for the first time. But.....my oven was a mess when it finished baking. I didn't know the bottom of a springform pan had a top and a bottom. I just washed the pan and popped the bottom in.  Mine was in upside down and butter leaked out all over the oven. Luckily it didn't affect the outcome of the coffeecake. It was moist, looked great and cut very nicely. My family and parents loved this recipe and I will be making it again. Only next time, I will have the pan put together correctly. Thanks springfield70 for sharing this recipe.

This was amazing. So moist and just the right amount of sweet. The hardest part was waiting the hour for it to cool. Thanks for a great recipe!

Just what I was looking for! I loved the almond extract with the raspberry jam. Changes made: used 3/4 cup of jam, 1/2 tsp. salt & 2 eggs so that it would be more cakey instead of bread-like. Lovely!

Very nice.  very easy, too, and a good little breakfast thing that I brought into work.  Everyone really seemed to love it, and ate it within a couple of days (I have a small unit and my coworkers like to nibble).  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe many times.  The cake isn't too sweet, which makes the cake.  I have changed the types of fruit preserves and still have wonderful results.  Working with the batter is probably the  most difficult part of the recipe.  A rubber spatula is my preferred tool for this.  This cake is requested regularly at work or social gatherings.  Give it a try.

Delicious!  I can't get enough of the filling - I double the cream cheese filling in the recipe.  I have used pie filling in place of the raspberry preserves, which works well too.

I made this recipe this morning with the intention of having it for dessert.  Well... I got home from picking up my son from school and I couldn't resist the amazing smell this left in my house and couldn't wait til dessert.  My son and I each had a piece and the reviews are in... this cake is amazing, 5 stars no doubt! The flavor of the almond extract paired with the raspberries along with the almond crumb topping that adds this slight crunch with ever bite you take was superb!  I didn't have any trouble with the batter being too difficult to spread like other reviewers had stated.  I used a spatula to spread it in my spring foam pan but I give credit to my amazing food processor for making the batter the perfect consistency!  Thanks Springfield70 for sharing this great recipe, it's a keeper!

This cake was a total flop for me.   The batter is too thick to spread (time consuming).  The almond flavoring overpowers the taste of the cake, I  cut the cream cheese in 1/2 and was still too creamy for our liking and I also ended up baking it for another 20 minutes and the centre didn't set up nicely. 
I have quite a few clients that I bake for and my hubby is my tester of all new recipes that I try.  His comment was " you can't serve this to anybody"....enough said.

I used whole wheat flour, so maybe that's why I had trouble. But the filling ran to the middle and the cake parts was way too thick.

Recipe group selection of 8/11/12.   We enjoyed this, especially since I love anything raspberry.  I would have liked it better if it had used ricotta instead of cream cheese because I found the cream cheese a bit heavy.  I heated my preserves before adding them so spreading them was a bit easier.  The next time I make this I may really emulate that commercial baker and add a touch of coconut shreds and some drizzles of white icing.  Thanks, springfield 70 this is a keeper.

I made this for Recipe Group.  I made it yesterday and took it to a neighbor who has family in town, so I didn’t get to taste it.  But they called this morning and said, “You’re coffee cake was AWESOME!  Everyone loved it!”  I guess that makes this recipe 5 stars!  I had difficulty spreading the batter 2” up the sides of the pan, just couldn’t figure out a good way to do it.  I ended up using an offset spatula, which seemed to work.  I’d like to make this one again, so I can actually taste it!

I love love this recipe! I'm a baker by trade at a local coffee shop and make this nearly every weekend. I've made it with raspberries,  strawberries, blueberries,  apples, etc. I don't use a spring form pan anymore, as I've increased to a double batch. I use a deep half sheet cake pan and it turns out great every time! 375° For 45 minutes. Every .  Time .  I adjust the extract flavoring to match the fruit I use and add cinnamon to the apple or strawberry.  I also have given up on using preserves and use fresh or frozen fruit (just toss in a little flour and sugar and dump on). Seriously worth a try for anyone with a sweet tooth in the morning!  Awesome awesome recipe!  One of my ABSOLUTE favorites ??

I love this coffee cake!  I don't like super sweet desserts so it was perfect for me, and my husband loved it as well.  It grew very nicely in the oven.  I have a ton of left over jam and would try it with other flavor jams too.  I didn't have almond extract or almonds so I just subbed vanilla and lemon rind in the dough and cinnamon in the crumbs.  I didn't quite understand why others said it was hard to spread.  I just poured it out in the pan evenly so the entire surface was covered.  Did the same with the cream cheese mixture, jam and crumbs.  Delicious!

These were okay and time consuming.  The cake part were dried out the next morning.  I would eat them within the same day.

I'd suggest just 1 tsp of almond extract, it was a bit overpowering.  And mine definitely needed more time to bake.  Looks and tastes great.

I made this with apricot preserves this morning for my adult class. I thought it turned out great, and they seemed to enjoy it as well.

I eschewed the nuts  because and substituted vanilla flavoring for almond (because I didn't have almonds or almond extract). I also, as many of the other reviewers have done, added a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze. It adds something for flavor and a lot for presentation. 

I will almost certainly make this again, and I think next time I will make an orange juice based glaze and toss some orange zest into the cream cheese. I'm a citrus fanatic. 

One other thing - it's really MUCH better at room temperature.

My sister had a piece of this left over that I stole. HAD to make it a week later. It is FANTASTIC. The flavor mellows out really well if you can manage to let it sit overnight.

Fabulous!!! I brought a slice to work for myself and everyone wondered where their slice was. I now have one in the oven to bring to work tomorrow. It is so delicious!!! The flavor combination tastes wonderful, you may need to use a bit more preserves then what is called for. I used Trader Joe's fresh raspberry preserves.

Looks beautiful coming out of the oven. I made it exactly as stated, and figured the combination of flavors would make it a winner, but the bottom layer was too dense and hard.  I felt it was a waste of ingredients because no one ate it after trying a bite.

Excellent recipe - also very versatile. The first time,  I made as per the posted recipe except added 1 tsp. lemon zest to cream cheese mixture. I assembled the night before and baked the next morning. I used a rubber spatula to build the sides up (not two inches but still good). Took about 53 minutes baking time allowing for the cooler batter. Per another reviewer, take out when the cake is done (the middle will still jiggle a little just like a cheesecake) and the cream cheese filling will finish setting as the cake cools. My cake was not at all dry. Any filling will work. Next time I will experiment with almond paste and a cherry filling.

I loved this cake, the only thing I found was the sides were a bit dry the day after, so next time I might make sure to press less batter along the sides of the pan.

I made this for my girlfriend's office. I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of using preserves. I didn't have any on-hand, but I did have a 6 oz. container of fresh raspberries. I smashed them with a fork, added two cups of sugar, brought it to a boil for five minutes until it started to become gelatinous, then let it cool. I used the entire pan of homemade preserves instead of the 1/2 c of preserves the recipe called for. I left it in the spring form pan and let it cool, then covered it tightly in foil and refrigerated it overnight. The next morning it easily came out of the pan. I drizzled it with a confectioner sugar glaze and topped with fresh raspberries. I cooked it for 45 minutes. It looked gorgeous but since I had never made it before and didn't want to cut it to sample it (I know, bad cook) I went on the reviews here and on faith knowing I followed the recipe exactly that it would be edible. I asked my girlfriend if she heard any feedback from the office staff and she told me the entire cake was gone within minutes so I am going to assume that it was a hit. I will definitely make this again and be sure to have some myself!

This was pretty good, however I had too bake mine much longer than the recommended time of 45 to 55 min in order for the filling to be set and the top to be a deep golden brown as suggested.  In doing so, the bottom cake layer was a tad bit dry and nearly burnt.  Otherwise, the flavor was very nice.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, springfield70!

This was just okay for me. Not what I was thinking it would be. Also I am my worst critic when it comes to baking, but even the majority of people at the party agreed it was just so so. If I make again I may try some pie filling in the middle. And some cinnamon. Personal preference . But I did make exactly as stated, needs more filling for sure.

Cake turned out wonderful! I did not make the cheese part this time and I used fresh blackberry sauce that I made from blackberries in the garden. To spread the dough mixture, I sprayed a rubber spatula and just slowly spread the dough over the pan and up the sides. The sides of the cake were delicious. I baked for 40 minutes, until golden brown. Turned out wonderful! My family loves it and we'll make it again. Thanks!

This was awesome...Followed suggestion of other reviewers and added an extra egg to the dough.  Almost wished I hadn't since the dough was thinner and had to go up the sides of the pan.  Poured dough in ..leveled bottom with a small offset spatula and pushed batter up around the edges with a rubber spatula to make a pool for the cream cheese filling.  Warmed jam and piped over using small baggie, mine baked for only 31 MINUTES.  This rose beautifully, perfect round edges, Edges seemed dark and a bit hard.  Made an almond glaze with heavy cream confectioners sugar and almond extract..Painted on edges with pastry brush, which solved my concern about the edges being too hard.  Chilled and drizzled same almond glaze over top.  Looked like a bakery confection, was very moist and delicious.  It sounds like its difficult but it isn't just a first time learning curve

Really good. I accidentally only used 1/2 cup butter rather than the 3/4 c the recipe called for, and I only had light sour cream on hand. With those two factors, I was concerned it would be dry, but it was fine. I baked for 45 minutes. The cream cheese was still a little jiggly, but I assumed it would set as it cooled. I probably should have baked a few minutes longer, but it was still very good. I also liked the pretty presentation, which made it nice for a Christmas get-together with friends.

Outstanding! I used strawberry preserves instead. Turned out perfect. I’m not a baker but this was excellent. Glad I read the comment about not cooking it til it was fully set bc I was wondering about that and it confirmed it for me! Definitely give it a try!!

This was very good but I made some changes based on what I had so can't give it 5 stars.  First off I didn't have raspberry preserves but I did have frozen raspberries, just over two cups.  I thawed them, drained them and added about 1/4 cup sugar and 2 Tbs of quick tapioca to the berries.  I also didn't have enough sour cream so I used plain yogurt.  I was expecting the first batter to be thick based on some reviews but my batter was a bit on the thin side.  For the cream cheese filling, I used low fat cream cheese and it also was on the thin side maybe should have used regular cream cheese.  I baked it for about one hour and it came out looking pretty good.  My husband likes it but says it could use some sort of icing.  I may try other extract next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I brought this to a breakfast pot luck at work.  Everyone LOVED it!  I used salted butter (that's what I had on hand), and cut the called for salt in half.  I probably used more than 1/2 cup of jam; I didn't measure it.  Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  I made it the night before, and I did not refrigerate as suggested.  It was delicious and I think would adapt easily to other fruit toppings.

Am an experienced baker and couldn't wait to make this. It was lovely going in & out of the oven. Baked a bit longer (10 mins) since the streusel topping wasn't browning. The cake was coming away from the sides of the pan so I removed it from the oven but after cooling. I was dismayed to see the middle was "wet", appearing to be unbaked. It tasted ok, but not the best for all of the work. ( I didn't serve it). What went wrong?  Would blind baking the first layer turn this recipe into a keeper?

Wonderful dessert... my girlfriends raved about how moist it was.  Didn't have almonds so I used chopped pecans which worked great.  It's important that the first layer crust be as even and thin as possible, I could have done this a bit better.  It's a repeater keeper in my book:))

I followed the recipe, but mine turned out very dry, but still underdone in the center. Might try it again and see if it was operator error.

I tried this and did not like it at all. When I mixed the 1st part it was like a ball of dough and knew it wasn't right. Then when I did the 2nd and 3rd step it felt like a brick. I followed all the steps except left the almonds off in the end. Was not happy at all. Also the cooking times were not right it took 1 hour and did not get golden brown.

I didn't have any raspberries or preserves, so I topped this with some orange jello and rum mixture. I know, sounds crazy, but it was really delicious! Next time, I want to make this with apples in the cake part. This recipe freezes and thaws well.

This  recipe turned out very well.  I do not understand the need for a spring form pan though and in the future shall make it in a rectangular one.

Here are my easy making tips: plop all of the batter in the spring form pan.  get the biggest piece of saran wrap you can and use it to press the batter against the bottom and up the sides without pulling the saran wrap off.  then place the pan plus saran wrap in the freezer.  leave it there while you make the cream cheese filling.  when that is ready, pull the pan out of the freezer.  the saran wrap should just pull off without a lot of sticking.  As for the jam, simply plop a bunch in a small pyrex dish or a pyrex measuring cup, place it in the microwave, and heat until it flows. be careful, it gets hot fast.  then you can simply pour it on the cream cheese and spread it with a spatula. no need to hassle with a bag. good luck!

It was so amazing.  It was the first time I made it and brought it  as a birthday/brunch dessert to my friends "guinea pigs" and we all loved.  They all wanted to know when I was going to make it again!!

We liked this very much!  Made it in a 9x9 square pan and used strawberry preserves rather than raspberry because that is what I had on hand.  Yum!

I really liked this. For ease, I just baked it in a 9" pan. I lined with foil and sprayed it with Bakers Joy and that worked fine. It still presented well without using a spring form pan. My only changes were using peach preserves because that is what I had, 2% plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and doing 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla extract for the full amount called for of the almond extract. Don't worry about how thin the base may look when spreading it. It does rise very well in the oven. I really liked the combination of cake, cream cheese layer, and preserves. Thank you

Definitely will make again! I used whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream (I forgot it on my grocery list) and it turned out beautifully and delicious!! I also cooked down some cherries instead of jam and it was tasty.

I found the  'cake portion of this to be very hard and dry...more similar to a shortbread crust.  *IF* I were to make it again, I would spread the batter evenly across the bottom of the pan.  Same with the cream cheese filling and raspberry .   Use solo raspberry filling.  Jelly or Jam will be too anemic for the  almond flavoring.

All said & done, a delicious coffee cake. And gorgeous - just a stunning presentation.  But a bit tough to make - this is not a throw it together kind of recipe. This recipe is made to impress. And to bake it for your perfectionist mother's birthday brunch and have it be enjoyed says it's worth the effort ;). Other reviews were really helpful, so thanks reviewers! Spreading the cake is more like working with bread dough...tacky, sticky. Best tip is to wet a spatula to get the dough without any holes and somewhat up the sides of the springform pan. As an experiment, I left oneside rough on the sides and another more to perfection, and both baked just fine. 

I did end up using more like 7oz of raspberry preserves and could have used all 9. Any fruit would work. I would definitely make again!

Baked for 50 (55?) minutes, High Altitude (Denver), no adjustments except for more raspberry preserves. Oh and I used Vanilla extract instead of the almond. Enjoy!

This was delicious! Note to self:  used all 12 oz. of Solo raspberry cake and pastry filling; swirled in - much easier than spreading.  Baked about 47 - 53 minutes in my oven.  Cooled not chilled.  Didn't glaze top as this scrumptious cake is so sweet and rich, it didn't need anything additional added to it.  Absolutely delicious when still warm!  Don't overbake as sides darken quickly.  Making for Thanksgiving with blueberry filling.  Originally  made 11/21/15

Just made this today for a dinner party.  Mostly followed the recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the cream cheese layer.  Followed another reviewer's advice and used Solo raspberry filling.  YUM!!!  Definitely like the boxed fruit Danish, only MUCH better!

It's worked amazing for me, my daughter made it all her self and she is 13 and we love it!! Love how the raspberries bring the sweet tick to it if that makes any sense!! Highly suggest this of I don't just want a plain cheesecake!
