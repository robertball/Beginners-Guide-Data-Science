I used this recipe as I lost mine.  I deleted the ginger, and used 3 cups of sugar for a double recipe.  I also deleted the pickle crisp as I like these pickles a little soft.  Some times that stuff makes the pickles rubbery.  I will use this recipe again with the adjustments.

This is great with zucchini instead of cucumbers. I used 2, each the length of my forearm, to make 8 pints. Delicious!

I love these pickles and have made them for years. I also add a couple of things but they are great as is in the recipe here. I add 2-3 cut open thai chili peppers to each jar and I love the onions. Sometimes, I just can the onions and no cukes in the jar at all as the onions are fantastic when used on hot dogs and burgers and stuff.
