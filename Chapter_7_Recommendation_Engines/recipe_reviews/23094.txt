This recipe is great and you can modify it to make a filling breakfast. I skip the honey and add about an 1/8 cup of rolled oats. Its so good and fills me up right through lunch!

This is even better if you cut the banana in chunks and freeze it before using.  Also even better to use 1 cup milk and put in in the freezer for about 45 min or intil it is slushy before making the smoothie.

I have been experimenting with smoothies lately and my 8 yr old proclaimed this "The best ever" and said we should make it every day. My one year old really enjoyed it too (I thinnned hers down with extra milk).  I doubled the recipe, froze the bananas to add some coolness and just blended the honey in with everything instead of drizzling it on at the end.  I think I will cut the honey down next time as I though it was a tad sweet.

I changed the drink to make it more of an after dinner snack or dessert.  I suggest adding a tablespoon (or more) of nutella as well as a cup of vanilla ice cream.  This made it a cold, frothy and slightly chocolately tasting goodie.

Having been recently diagnosed with a yeast condition in which I must stay away from sugar, I've been looking for recipes without added sugar.  This tasted really more food-like and not so sugary.  I used old-fashioned peanut butter and 2 small ripe bananas with 2% milk.  It was yummy and satisfying without making you feel bloated from lots of sugar like other smoothies!  Thank you Diane.

Fantastic! I loved the texture of the crunchy peanut butter in with this oh so smooth smoothie. I used frozen banana and a little simple syrup instead of honey to sweeten (abt a teaspoon), and about double the milk to bring the smoothie to the right thickness. It was smooth, thick, creamy, and delicious. Definitely one of my favorites.

Awesome! Can't believe I didn't think of it myself. It seems so simple, and is really, really good. Add 3 ice cubes to the blender to make it cool. I don't use the honey, as I find that too sweet.

This is a surprisingly filling mid-morning meal.  I've made this dozens of times and here are some tips:  - Using a ripe frozen banana, you don't really need any added sweetener so I usually skip the honey and it still tastes great.    - I use almond milk (unsweetened vanilla) instead of soy which has better, richer taste to it.  - Add 1/4 cup of old-fashioned oats, it really thickens the smoothie and makes the drink more filling too.    - Experiment with different nut butters.  I've also made this with almond, cashew and hazelnut butter, all are great but each has its own unique flavor to it.     - If you're looking to watch the calories, you can use a peanut powder instead of peanut butter (just make sure that peanuts are first in the ingredients list).

Very yummy!!  But next time I will freeze the banana first as the entire drink was somewhat warm.

Tasty and delicious!  I thought it was a little bit too sweet...I added ice cubes to make it colder and I used Nutella instead of peanut butter which might be why it was too sweet.  I doubled the recipe and that made enough for two people.  Nutella is great with bananna.

Oh, I love peanut butter and bananas mixed together and this smoothie was delicious. Instead of milk, I used vanilla yogurt and threw in some quick cooking oats to add more texture. I know oatmeal in smoothies is unheard of but you must try it next time. Just throw everything in a blender and add a few tablespoons of oats at a time. The longer the smoothie sits, the thicker it will get so start off with only about 1/8 of a cup. It's a great way to get fiber into your morning diet. Even my kids like this. Thanks for your recipe Diane, this is one of my favorite smoothie recipes.

When putting the ingredients in the blender, add the milk first, then the banana, then peanut butter then honey.  I made the mistake of putting the PB and honey in first, and they sort of glommed up on the bottom and were hard to get to mix in.  I added a TBSP wheat germ, which went unnoticed by my 9 year old son.  Ice cubes make it nice and frosty and add a little more texture.  I also used 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup milk rather than using 1/2 cup milk only.

This was yummy, and had lots of protein, so it kept me feeling full for along time.  I changed the recipe somewhat, using regular milk and yogurt instead of soy milk, and using a bit of vanilla for extra flavor.  I also put in a spoonful of cocoa powder, which adds a nice optional chocolatey flavor.

I'm so excited to find this fabulous smoothie!!! I've been looking for something quick/healthy and filling to make for breakfast. And something I felt good about letting my 2 year old son have. We used frozen bananas, organic (no sugar added) peanut butter, rice milk (my son has a dairy sensitivity), a drizzle of honey, a few slices of apple and a spoonful of flaxseed. SOOOOOOO YUMMY!!! I will definitely be making this for breakfast until I get sick of it. I'm also really excited to try adding some oats to it. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!!!

This looked like a great combination as some people eat peanut butter and banana sandwiches, but this was disgusting. It was to thick and tasted like way too much peanut butter straight from the can!

Very Good. Will keep you satisfied until lunch, no problem. Added 2 tsp.  flaxseed and 1/4 C. light silken tofu  after trying the original recipe on its own. For me these additions compliment the nutrtional value without altering the taste.

This is delicious! I froze the banana, added 2 ice cubes (the small kind from icemaker), used non-fat milk and blended the honey with other ingredients. It was very creamy, cold and satifying, except that it was so good, even though I felt full, I could have drank another one. Definately a KEEPER!

Not too much of anything, was the perfect balance! I added a few ice cubes to make it colder and was out of soy milk so I used regular 2% and it turned out just great. Next time maybe I will use frozen bananas. Thanks for this. I had jaw surgery and am on liquids only diet for a few weeks and nothing seems to sound good, but I drank the whole thing. Will definitely use this to get some protein in me!

My husband and I thought it was great. We prefer it cold so to add some ice cubes before blending and a touch less honey would be perfect for us.

loved this recipe, however I followed someone else's review and added the oatmeal to make it more filling.  I also froze the banana first to make it cooler (note to self, peel banana before freezing it!)  With the oatmeal I give it 5 stars.  So lite and delish!!

I usually double this and use regular milk, but I like adding ice to chill it out.

If you chop up the bananas and freeze them, it really helps with the thickness of the smoothy.

I usually try to cut back on the sugar by adding two spendas in place of the honey for my double batch.

Excellent smoothie!! I used skim milk and only 1 tablespoon honey (blended in). Next time I will try a frozen banana (it's a bit warm) and maybe omit the honey all together. If I had it, I would have also added wheat germ or ground flax seed. Thanks :)

I don't like peanut butter so this rating is based off what my daughters thought of it. The younger one also does not like peanut butter (she, sniff, takes after her old man) and the older one loves it, and they both could not get enough of this smoothie. Going to try it again and again. Used regular milk (one percent) instead of soy because that's all I had, but came out fine.

5 Stars only after my personal modifications....I don't do soy anything so I used regualr milk, some crushed ice, and no honey.  The banana and peanut butter were sweet enough.  I also tried it with vanilla yogurt and it was fantastic!  Next I am going to try with the suggestion of the rolled oats.  Peanut Butter and Bananas are my favorite, so this smoothie couldn't go wrong for me :)

Freeze your banans or use crushed ice or frozen yogurt or all 3 to get a super thick smoothie. :-)  Sub chocolate syrup for the honey. Yeah, now that's what i call a smoothie.

This is my son's favorite in the morning now.  I cut and froze  the bananas so it makes the drink cold and acts as a thickener.  I sometimes use Vanilla Silk for a change and sometimes add a small handful of oats to blend with bananas before adding liquid.  Agave is another idea instead of honey.  Yummy - just as is also.

the proportions are great, just enough sweetness, thickness. I used roasted unsalted shelled peanuts ground up and coconut milk instead. Then added a bunch of ice to create volume. Kid and hubby taste tested, mommy approved ;)

This was soooo yummy!! I didn't add the honey based on some of the other reviews and I'm glad I didn't. I think it would have been too sweet for my taste. Will be making this regularly for breakfast and for snacks.

I quadrupled this recipe, used frozen chunked bananas, Trader Joe's organic peanut butter, nonfat milk and homemade sugar free maple syrup (I'm out of honey at the moment....whoops). The kids thought this was GREAT, my husband did not. That's alright, the kids had NO problem drinking Daddy's.

Sorry, we did not like this smoothie. It was way too thick. I even added more milk to thin it out but just couldn't handle the thickness of the peanut butter.

My daughter is not much of a breakfast person so I made this for her today. Very nice! I used frozen banana, regular milk, and no honey. 1/8 cup = 2 tablespoons which is much easier to measure with peanut butter. Will add some ground flax next time.

Now that was good!  
I used one frozen banana, 3/4 cups skim milk, 2 heaping tablespoons peanut butter, and a packet of splenda.  
Next time I will add oats to it.  Loved the flavor!!  I think peanut butter is one of the best foods on the planet!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

5 stars after my changes. I froze the banana, used 2 ice cubes, 1/2 cup 2% milk, 1/4 cup peanut butter, only a small drizzle of honey and 1 tablespoon of rolled oats. 
Everybody has personal taste preferences, which accounts for some people changing things and others not. Great recipe!

Very tasty, and a great jumping off point for modifications. I mixed soy and 2% milk to balance the flavors, and instead of honey I added honey flavored Cheerios to give the drink extra sweetness, bulk, and texture. Next time I'll try adding chocolate milk mix to harness the choco-banano style goodness!

Absolutely delicious and very filling, only change I made was using regular milk instead of soy because it was all I had in the fridge. The smoothie is easy to put together and gave me plenty of energy to get through a busy day.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been making something like this for years (w/ 1% milk), especially when I was pregnant. I boost the protein by adding some non-fat drry milk powder, and I think it makes it sweeter,too.(I never put in sugar or honey.) But the REAL SECRET is to use a FROZEN banana. Makes it thicker and frontier. Whenever I have bananas that have gotten overripe, I peel them, wrap 'em individually in wax paper, and store in a freezer ziplock.

I thought it was okay, but nothing spectacular.  I tasted it after it was mixed and it was way too warm, so I added 2 ice cubes and blended them in.  Maybe using a frozen banana would help with the temperature.

As is, this is a bit gooey because of the banana.  I think it would have been better if you chunked up the banana first and froze it.  Plus I had to add twice the milk just to get rid of the sliminess of this.  Next time I will freeze the banana, use twice the milk, and use natural dark chocolate peanut butter for more flavor.

Doesn't make much, so double the recipe

Toss the honey and instead add 2 cups of ice cream and you have a great milkshake.

This felt so good on my sore throat today.  The recipe was just perfect.  I agree you should use a frozen banana, to keep the drink cold.  And if it is too thick for you, you can throw in a couple of ice cubes, like I did, to thin it down.

Great recipe!

WOW! That was amazing. Its a great base recipe. I added some oats, flax seed, and put about half the amount of honey in. Its really sweet enough without honey at all.Anyone that likes peanut butter will love this.

I really like this smoothie, but I recreated it with my son, and substituted pickles for the peanut butter. Also used normal milk instead of soy, and used no honey. It's my sons new favorite drink, I think it's okay, more for a kids taste buds though.

This is a good smoothie as-is, but I used almond butter instead of PB and almond milk instead of soy milk. I also added a tablespoon of nutella and it was delish! Perfect as a pre-workout meal.

Made this today with un-sweet almond milk and a frozen banana. Overall, it had a good flavor but it was just honestly waay to sweet with the 2 Tablespoons of honey. Being as it is also near 5oo calories, I added more almond milk and some ice to stretch it into 2 servings. ty

I make a similar smoothie, but use almond milk and put the honey in the smoothie before blending. I also add ice cubes to make it colder & thicker. Sometimes I add cinnamon & flax seed as well.

This smoothie was really delicious. I love the combination of PB and banana. (: 
I don't measure the peanute butter and instead stick a butter knife in the jar and put in a big glob. Also, I added the honey while blending. 
One thing that is a MUST with this recipe is that you have to either freeze the banana or add about 5-6 ice cubes to make it cold. It's really bad when it's room temp.

I doubled this recipe and used skim milk instead of soy. I added two heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter instead of measuring it out. I added a drizzle of honey at the end and stirred it in for a subtle sweetness. Very yummy and creamy! The only problem I had was that after I froze the bananas, as suggested by other reviewers, it was difficult to remove the peels for some reason. The bananas may have been a bit too ripe.

If you don't have time to freeze bananas and want it quickly, you can just add ice to the blender. It's a slushier smoothie. My kids and I love it! Always a good flavor combo.

I had a bit of coconut milk leftover from last night's dinner, so I used that in place of the soy, and it came out delicious! I also added two ice cubes, but next time I'll just freeze the banana. Excellent breakfast.

This was so delicious and tasted like a dessert. I used slightly more peanut butter and slightly less honey and next time I will try the nutella as one other user suggested. THAT would be awesome tasting.

I made this and it is definitely not the 4 1/2-star rating it was given.  I love peanut butter and bananas and it was disappointing.  It was not as thick as praised for so, I added an extra banana.  It was a decent shake that I won't make again.

Doubled recipe so we could all try it, but all 4 of us were disappointed. It's very thick and has too much peanut butter. Hard to drink. May try again but will have to at least change the amount of peanut butter. (Ages that tried this recipe and did not like it: 2, 4, 26 and 46)

The verdict from my 7 year old son: the best smoothie EVER! I used a frozen banana over the suggested alternative to make it a little frosty and more creamy, and cow's milk. I myself found it very sweet, but that probably depends on the ripeness of the banana you use. I left off the honey drizzle. This makes a filling and nutritious snack or breakfast. Thanks for the recipe.

this is a delicious breakfast smoothie!  I have to admit, i didn't follow the recipe exactly because when I'm making smoothies I always eyeball the ingredients,  i never measure anything out.  Plus,  i did not have soy milk so i substituted with buttermilk (i substituted this as well - milk w/lemon juice) and i added oatmeal as another reviewer suggested to make it more filling.  i also blended the honey in with it instead of drizzling on top.  Normally i try to follow the recipe exactly and base my rating on that but I  think my changes did not differ to much from the original recipe

Mmm...very delish! I first put the peanut butter in the blender, then the honey. Then I put it in the banana. After that I pour some soy milk in there. After that, I modified it by adding at least 1-cup ice. Blend well and it's absolutely delicious!!!! Will definitely keep making this recipe!

Good smoothie. I worked at a gym where we made protein shakes/smoothies. The secret is adding a few ice cubes to the mix before blending. As others suggested, it's also better to freeze your bananas. 

If you want a richer texture, add a little yogurt and cut down on the milk.

I used chocolate soy milk and cut the honey down to one table spoon although you could probably take it out altogether with the sweetness from the chocolate. Like others suggested, I froze the banana. Tasted amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this for Mother's Day breakfast for my mom and it was EXCELLENT! There was a couple changes I made from what reviewers suggested, though. I used a lot less honey: about one teaspoon per a serving. Also, I froze the banana the night before. I added a couple ice cubes to make it a bit colder, too. Since I didn't have soy milk, I used regular milk. This smoothie turned out absolutly great!

Tasty.  I made a few changes.  I froze my bananas first, use vanilla soy milk, and also added dry instant oatmeal (brown sugar maple), and skipped on the honey. Very filling breakfast on the go kinda meal.  Yum!

This is delicious!  i HATE bananas, but now i've found a way to enjoy them.  :)
  I used skim milk and added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground up oatmeal (I don't like that by itself either).  Thanks for helping me be a little more healthy!  
In the future, for added decadence, I would add chocolate syrup as well.

I usually use 1 cup chocolate soy milk and honey peanut butter.  Definately freeze the banana before making the smoothie.

This is soooooo good.  As a kid I had peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwiches, so I guess this one is right up my alley.  I will continue to make this one.

This is super delicious. It is really thick & creamy. I've made this a few times now and I think I prefer it with half the peanut butter and adding several ice cubes and unsweetened vanilla almond milk. Also, I added a T of milled flax seed. Although all the ingredients are all super healthy - this is actually pretty high in calories - so just be aware if you are counting calories . Them again all nut butters are high in calories so that probably goes without saying. Either way, it's really delicious and super filling if made as is! :)

Really like this but it is super sweet.  I froze the bananas, used almond milk (what I had on hand), mixed half the honey in the blender instead of on top, and added a dash of cinnamon.  Almost wish it were a bit thicker. Would add seeds (ex: chia) for breakfast smoothie.

I admit that I tweaked this a little bit, but kept the concept the same. I used a frozen banana, and 2 Tbsp of organic peanut butter powder. I subbed organic coconut oil for the honey and used raw goat milk in place of the soy. SO GOOD!

I loved this!!! I am not normally a fan of the banana and peanut butter combination, but the honey added just the right taste. The only change I made was the addition of ice, but besides that, it was amazing.

Very tasty.  I think a frozen banana would be nice or freeze the soy milk a bit.  But it is nice the way it is.  No honey necessary.

This was so yummy and refreshing. I doubled it, using frozen bananas, used half the amount of honey, and skim milk instead of soy (don't have soy). Also threw in a smattering of oats, per another reviewer. De-lish!  And my 4 year old daughter devoured it!  Thanks for the recipe.

I added oats which I blended alone first. Then I added the other ingredients (using 2% milk instead of soy). I used frozen bananas. Very yummy! I think next time I may cut back on the honey a little to make it healthier. I think it would still be sweet enough.

It's alright. It's warm, so consider adding crushed ice or freezing the banana prior. It also doesn't make a whole lot, even for one serving. I doubled the directions. Too thick for my liking, but I could imagine it being a great desert drink with chocolate or Baileys.

I added a little more PB and used agave instead of honey and used organic milk.  This became a very heart healthy drink!  Can't wait to try it with the 7 year old picky one...

I'm not a big fan of banana, but I was able to drink this smoothie just fine. I used sunflower butter instead of peanut butter, and almond milk instead of soy. I think I will try a frozen banana next time, smoothie like drinks taste weird at room temp.

Really nice peanut butter banana smoothie recipe. Strong flavour, but smooth. I had to eyeball the measurement of the peanut butter. I used natural peanut butter, and it was quite solid. I switched the milk to 1%, and it tasted fine. A great and quick breakfast!

Very thick and yummy! I went ahead and blended the honey along with the other ingredients. I also added some ice cubes to make it cold. I will be making this again! :)

This was really smooth and I loved it. It was also very filling.  I would not change a thing except I did add my protein mix and this really helped it go down easier. Thanks

I did not have soy milk, so used half and half.  Added a little bit of crushed ice.  A tablespoon or so of peanut butter.  I left off the honey and used Peter Pan peanut butter.

Delicious! I didn't have honey so used a table spoon of Maple Syrup. Freezing bananas helps so you get a really cold refreshing drink. I highly recommend this smoothie!!

INCREDIBLE! I choose this over a dessert now! Its a really tasty option instead of a candy bar! I dont need the honey but when i have used it, a little goes a long way people. You should definately freeze your banana beforehand also, because it makes the drink much colder. YUM

This was delicious~!  My son has been spending $7 EVERY SINGLE DAY buying the Jamba Juice peanut butter smoothie.  He just moved home from college, and Jamba Juice is no longer walking distance for him.  On a whim, I looked for a peanut butter banana smoothie recipe since I always have both on hand (I buy bananas at Costco, and when they start getting too ripe, I unpeel and freeze them in ziplock baggies.  A frozen banana worked perfectly for this smoothie, making it nice and cool to drink...not sure if it would have been chill enough with just the soy milk to make it cold.  With my daughter's lactose intolerance, we always have soy milk (I'll bet this would be delish with the very vanilla soy milk, too) and since I buy the 3/pack organic honey from Costco, too, I think my son will be able to save that $7 and buy his momma her Starbucks, instead!!  Give this recipe a whirl, and enjoy.

Yummy!  I used a frozen banana and it was still a little thinner than I like, but still wonderful.  I will try using some ice as well next time.  It was great for breakfast, very satisfying.

This is a great basic recipe for a PBB smoothie. I used vanilla kefir instead of soy milk, and added 1/4 cup of oats. Then I put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to chill. If I would have thought ahead and froze the bananas, it would have been better!

I didn't want to waste the one very ripe banana I had left over after making banana muffins, so I thought I'd try this recipe. Although she declared this "the deliciousest smoothie [she] ever heard of," my preschooler only drank a couple of sips. I prefer my bananas nearly green, so I was surprised that I liked this even though I used a very ripe one. I used skim milk and omitted the honey. Update: I make myself this smoothie all the time now. When served cold (either with ice or a frozen banana as recommended by other reviewers) this is delicious, especially with the addition of chocolate milk syrup. Today, I used a room temperature banana and added a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream. I bet chocolate ice cream would be even better.

This was delicious!  Although I'm giving it 4 stars because I did make a number of minor changes.  I used regular milk (it's what I had), used a frozen banana for better consistancy, omitted the honey (too sweet for me) and I added 1/4c. oatmeal for some extra nutrition.  For a special evening treat, some chocolate syrup would also be a fun twist!

This recipe turned out really well but is also tasted really good with a few changes. The changes I made are: Doubling the recipe, adding two teaspoons of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 6 cubes of ice, and substituted plain low fat yogurt for the milk. This was dubbed perfect at my house!

Surprizingly tasty. Great alternative for protein shakes or quick morning breakfast. Had mine after dinner when I was craving something sweet.  I did add some oatmeal as someone else suggested it added a nice texture.  Im thinking for next time instead of the honey I might try some jelly or preserves, and maybe some chunky peanut butter it only seems right. Though the boyfriend said he liked it with the honey. Either way its a super easy recipe with many yummy ways to change it up.

very simple recipe, smoothies are something personally suited for taste. Fruits make up for vitamins etc. milk calcium, also ice cream is something you can add with or without the milk. I personally make this recipe first cutting fresh bananas into a blender then add peanut butter and milk, also a vanilla preferably soy protein (picked up at your local target or wal-mart), and then some tasty ice cream. Great if you're into to body building and are tired of either boring shakes or spending 3 bucks at planet smoothie. Furthermore I like to mix the fruits up a bit, good avocado, mango, strawberries, kiwi, raspberries. But I like to stick the peanut butter with bananas, another good addition to this smoothie especially for kids with a sugar tooth and need that extra boost in the morning is putting chocolate syrup or cocoa powder aswell. If you're making the smoothie for taste purposes only I would def recommend ice-cream, and even picking up Ben and jerrys ice cream and adding it to this, their cookie dough makes perfect for this pBNB smoothie.

This is a great smoothie - made many times, but I made several changes.  I use sugar free honey, skim milk, and add 1/2 cup ice. I sometimes use baby food fruits to replace fresh in smoothies. Makes mixing easier too.

This is awesome.  I use real milk though, add a scoop of flax powder (which doesn't alter the flavor), and throw in 5-6 ice cubes.

This was a fantastic smoothie, although I did change mine up just a little bit.  I used fat free chocolate milk, light PB, frozen banana, and about a 1/4c of quick oats.  Sounds like the oats would be chewy or gross in a smoothie, but after reading that suggestion in another smootie recipe I had to try it and I was pleasantly surprised.  The smoothie was tasty and filling as a meal for breakfast! The f/f choc. milk added just enough sweetness and the frozen banana made it perfectly chilled.  I'm sure the orignal recipe is great just as is even w/o any changes!

I love this recipe! Most days I have peanut butter on toast for breakfast so this is perfect for me! In stead of soy milk I used regular milk. I also added a hand full of ice to cool it down a bit.

Instead of adding sugar to bananas which are already very sweet to me, I used a spalsh of vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnamon to play up the sweetness. Instead of the yellow bananas, I used 3 small red ones, and also added a few cubes of ice to make this drink cool and refreshing. Just make sure to do most of the blending before the ice is added or the peanut butter will freeze into chunks. I used all-natural (just peanuts) peanut butter in this, turned out great! Thanks!

I really loved this!  I made it just as written, except that I blended the honey in with the rest of the drink instead of putting it around the rim of the glass.  I tasted it before I put the honey in and it just didn't taste right without the honey mixed in.

I used almond butter instead of peanut butter, as well as ice and flax seed meal, and it was delicious. I like having the extra protein in my breakfast smoothie.

Best smoothie ever!  My alterations were skim milk instead of soy, 2 ice cubes, and I added a vanilla flavored protein powder, which made it taste like a milkshake.  I'll be surprised if I don't drink one of these daily!

I have changed this up a bit.  I change the soy milk to light chocolate soy and make it 1 cup.  I also will freeze the banana (after broken in chunks).  This creates a smoother, thicker smoothie.  If you decide not to freeze the banana, drop it in whole and add about 2 cups of ice.  This will create the frappicino texture.

I like using a frozen banana, half the peanut butter and honey called for, low-fat milk (we never have soy milk on hand) and - this is key for me - adding a scoop of flax to kick up the nutrition.  So easy to make with a hand blender and large cup. Very filling.

This was very easy and very delicious!  I doubled the recipe to get 2 full glasses.  I used vanilla soy milk and added a little extra for easier blending.  The frozen bananas slowed the blender way down.  To be honest, I forgot the honey, but it was excellent anyway.  I feel it didnt really need it.  This one will go in my permanent file.  I'm thinking it would also be good with chocolate soy milk...hmmmm

This was pretty good. I had to guess on how much peanut butter I was using and I think I put too much, which maybe why my smoothie was too thick. I would have used 1 cup of milk next time.

I also omitted the honey since I'm not a fan of that.

Good, but not as cold as I like my smoothies. I usually use frozen fruits, but I hadn't froze the bananas yet. I would recommend using frozen bananas. I added wheat germ. Edited to add: I tried this again with some oatmeal and chocolate syrup (omitted the honey) and wow was that yummy.

It was a very nice smoothie! A nice summer time drink. The only changes I made was I added two ice cubes and reduced the honey to 1 and a half tablespoons. Overall a nice recipe!

Very nice and creamy. I cut the amount of honey in half and it was still sweet enough. I would make two servings next time for one smoothie.

Great recipe! Wow!
I used one banana, chopped it into chunks, and set it in the freezer for about 30 minutes before putting it in the blender. I used 1/2 cup skim milk, somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 cup honey peanut butter (Peter Pan brand), 1 ice cube, and about 1 teaspoon of honey. The smoothie was cool, sweet (but not too sweet), and thick. Very nice! I will definitely make this again, especially in the summer!
*You will need to double or even triple this recipe if you want to serve multiple people. As it is now, it makes a little over a cup, nearly two.

I made this into a smoothie bowl, so I didn't use ice or freeze the bananas. Because it was a smoothie bowl, my smoothie came out browner than the one in the picture. And call me weird, but I liked it better without the honey.

Delicious! I had to add a little more milk to thin it out a bit and to get the blender moving. I also added a scoop of vanilla protein powder, skipped the honey because it was sweet enough for me, and added a little Nutella.  Yummy smoothie! UPDATE:  Made for the second time this week, but this time I used a protein nut (almond/cashew) milk -- it turned out excellent!

This was a GREAT smoothie! Absolutely delicious. I usually dislike peanut butter but this was thick, creamy, and filled me up until lunch time! It has become my knew thing, I eat it for breakfast every morning. I didn't do the honey (too sweet) and instead I added an 1/8 cup oats and it was delicious!

I liked it. I put Nutella and left out the honey but it was still sweet but with more milk it was nice.  Next time I will not put Nutella and instead put 2 packets of Truvia and just the peanut butter, milk and banana.

I found it tasted too much like banana so I added another tbsp of peanut butter. It was nowhere near cold enough and far too runny so I blended in ice cubes to remedy this. I will give this one more shot and will take others' advice and freeze the banana slices first before blending.

This recipe was great! I added about a 1/4 cup of peanut butter because I wanted more of that taste rather than banana, and it turned out good. This is a great base recipe that one could add almost anything, and it would work. I will definitely make this again - and often! Thank you for the recipe, Diane!

I have been really into smoothies lately and tried making this because I was craving a sweeter milk based drink. I was not a fan. My bananas were super ripe so just put in 1 not 2 honey, I also put in some ice to make it colder. The texture is very runny and this is not a thick smoothie. I still found it was too sweet. Its a bit of an odd taste. Wouldn't make it again.

I really enjoyed this smoothie! It's simple to make, and it's filling. Personally, I like my smoothies cold so I would recommend either adding 1/4 cup of crushed ice, or freezing the banana before you use it. I also like vanilla so I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

It was good. I made mine in a Vitamix blender and added 4 ice cubes. It was very thick even with the ice cubes.  I may add more ice next time or more milk to thin it down but the taste was great.

Just tried this out, it turned out pretty well! :) I used about a cup of milk instead of 1/2 a cup of milk. I had it mix for about 15 seconds, it could have been mixed about 5 more seconds. Other than that the recipe was great!

This was very tasty and filling. I added 1/2c vanilla yogurt instead of both teaspoons of honey, I just used one and it was just as sweet. Will make again for my husband.

This is a lot of clean up for a small yield - so double or triple the recipe and enjoy!  I put the extras in the freezer to grab & go on the run.  I'm just getting into Smoothies and this is a keeper.

The only thing I did was use almond milk instead of soy milk. I left out the honey as well. It is delish and refreshing! Def will be making this again. I think the calorie count is a bit off. Mine ended up being 335 calories.

I was looking for a smoothie recipe that used banana's & pb and ran across this. He just made it and I tasted it and it is very good. He also added some chocolate drink mix to make it chocolate. I think I would like it better a bit on the frozen side. Might try it with some crushed ice next time. My blender can't handle frozen fruit but it can handle already crushed ice from my freezer.

It came out pretty good. I was hoping for a little bit more of a peanut butter taste. I'll probably add more PB next time. It is a quick and easy smoothie for a fast meal.

I absolutely loved this smoothie. I made enough for 2 servings. I had one and my  six year old daughter had the other. She loved it, had my husband try and he even liked. This smoothie is delicious and I will definitely make this again! :-)

I'm not a huge fan of the sweetness. I may add protein powder and definitely skip the honey next time. Otherwise, this was a very filling smoothie. I will probably tweak it a bit and use it as a pre-workout snack. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect for breakfast! Not too sweet and easy to make! But I do suggest a little more milk to thin it down.

I thought it was great. It doesn't need the honey at all. I also used almond milk instead of the soy. The proportions make the perfect consistency. Perfect for the peanut butter lover!

I'm drinking it as I write this review, LOVED IT!!! So simple and yet so easy, however I made some adjustments. I used 1 cup skimmed non fat milk instead of soy, added 2 tbsp peanut butter and because I had to use them up and they were very small, I used 3 baby banana's. Did not bother with the honey as it's just as yummy without.

OMG! I am not a big fan of peanut butter, but my husband is. This smootie is delicious!!! I love how creamy and smooth it is. We could drink this all day, every day. If you're on the fence, make the leap and try it. It's that good.

My DD just had her tonsils out yesterday and is already tired of ice cream and popsicles, so I made her this smoothie.  She loved it, even asked me to be sure and save the recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole milk and added a Tbs of vanilla yogurt!  SCORE 1 for Mom!

Loved it!  I used a frozen banana because I like my smoothies cold.  Great flavor and texture - my 2 year old loved this, and I feel great giving him a drink that has less sugar and more protein (and I didn't have to buy any special ingredients - all things that I normally have in the house). Yum!

I love peanut butter on almost anything, so when I found this recipe, I thought that I was dreaming. I didn't think that it would turn out good and it didn't....It turned out great!!!! I use the frozen bananas, as others have mentioned, as well as some strawberry protein powder. Not only am I getting my peanut butter fix, but I'm getting some much needed protein to go with it =-D

I used 1 % milk and added some plain yoghurt, plus a tbsp of ground flaxseed.  I omitted the honey and just guessed on peanut butter-- I probably used less.  A tasty, thick smoothie, I'll be sure to make this again.

I thought it tasted kind of weird. But I used lactose free 2% milk, natural peanut butter, and didn't have any honey. And my banana was pretty ripe.

Quick and easy!  Used 1% milk.  After reading others notes I decided to throw a couple of ice cubes in and then refrigerate for 10 minutes before enjoying to give it an extra chill.  YUM!  Didn't know if I would like the peanut butter/banana mixture, made it more for my girls.. turns out I liked it better than they did =)

After reading the reviews on this, I just had to try this (especially since I love PB and banana sandwiches). It's very different, but very good. However, I did make some changes based on what others said. First, I froze my banana overnight. I also added 2 ice cubes and a cup of milk (regular 2%). I added a little more PB (1/4 c.), and also threw in a packet of maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal (which I can't even really taste). After only a few sips, I'm betting this will be a very filling breakfast. My only complaint is I think there's a tiny bit too much PB, so next time I'll probably just stick with the amount the recipe calls for. Great recipe!

I used regular milk (all I had)and used 1 cup to 1 banana ratio (not insanely crazy about ALL banana flavor). Used 3 T of peanut butter and mixed the honey into the smoothie versus drizzling it on top. YUM

Really very good. Added a couple of ice cubes with it to cool it down. We prefer the peanut butter and jelly smoothie from this site so I probably will not make again anytime soon but a good sub if i run out of jelly.

Amazing!!! This smoothie needs no embellishments, these 4 ingredients make the most decadent-tasting treat.  Using a frozen banana makes it frosty and ice cream-like.

Very good smoothie.  It definitely tastes like a peanut butter and banana sandwich.  Like other reviewers, I also omitted the honey and used chocolate milk instead.  My only complaint - I would have preferred it a little sweeter - maybe the honey would have helped.

If you need a filling breakfast option (or even a healthy dessert), this smoothie is excellent! I omitted the honey completely and used vanilla soymilk, all natural organic peanut butter, and a frozen banana. It was so delicious!! Thanks for posting!

Very good and very filling. I didn't add the honey and didn't miss it. I think I'll make this often for a healthy, quick lunch! Add a few ice cubes if your banana isn't frozen.

Delicious!  I froze my banana and I don't think I'll do that again.  Just adding 2 ice cubes is enough for me.  I only used 1 Tbsp of honey and regular milk instead of soy.  You can't go wrong with this one!

Yummy... this is one of my favorite snacks in smoothie form.  Next time I will freeze the banana as I am sure it will be even more delicious that way.  I used 1/2 c. skim milk, 2 generous tablespoons of peanut butter, and 1 Tbsp of agave instead of honey.  Thanks for the recipe!

this is actually pretty good, i read through the reviews and because alot of people had frozen their bananas i decided it needed the same, but because i made it littereally 2 minutes after reading, i used 4 crushed ice cubes instead.  and because i didnt have soy milk, i used the only milk on hand, 3 1/2%, i think if i used skim or soy it wouldve turned out better, but its still pretty good!!!

I used chocolate soy milk. I froze the banana. This was plenty sweet so I didn't bother with the honey. I was worried about the banana being a little strong so I only used half. It came out a little thin and not as thick as I would've wanted but the kids loved it anyways. Next time, I will add ice to thicken it up.

Fantastic recipe! It's just like eating a peanut butter-honey-and-banana sandwich, except I'm completely satisfied after drinking this smoothie.
I didn't use any honey in mine, because it was sweet enough already. Instead of using soymilk, I used skim milk.

Yum, though! It was thick, but a great starter for my day. Thank you SO much!

This is perfect for a quick morning breakfast. Like others I suggest freezing the banana first. This would make it the perfect temperature. I used fat free milk and did not use honey and found the flavor to be just right.

I love every ingredient in this smoothie and was excited to try it. However, I wasn't very impressed. My one year old only drank half a glass and declared he was "all done" Normally, he would be begging for more. I think it is a little too sweet with the peanut butter and honey. If I try it again, I will omit the honey. I also used frozen bananas, they are a must!

This recipe is great. I used agave nectar in place of honey to make it 100% animal free. It makes a wonderful "meal" smoothie. It is also *insanely* delicious!!!
