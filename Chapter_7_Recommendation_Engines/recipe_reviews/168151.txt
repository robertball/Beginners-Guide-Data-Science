A pretty decent starting point. I had to halve the recipe because it makes a whole lot (it still made a lot, even halved) and used canned tomatoes instead of diced fresh. The end result was hot but not as flavorful as I'd like. I tried to tweak the spices to suit my taste a little more, but something seems missing... the idea of a banana curry recipe is good, but I'm not quite sure this is the one.

Very good!  I replaced the yogurt with coconut milk, used tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes, added broccoli and shrimp, and halved most of the spices (1/2 cup of curry powder plus 4 teaspoon of turmeric would have been way too much.)  It ended up being a great, creamy sauce that went wonderfully on red rice.  I also took the advice of another review and halved the whole recipe (2 servings instead of 4,) which was spot on.

Half a cup of curry powder is excessive, I think its a mistake in the receipe. I used 1 tablespoon instead. I added chicken and used only half the curry paste and it was still spicy. It was a little bitter because of the ammount of cumin. So I would also recommend half of the ammount in the receipe. Its a very good idea of a receipe.

This is absolutely delicious, but it lacks texture.  I like my curries over rice, so I did the same thing as another reviewer and added a can of coconut milk and served it over some rice.  Even then, it still needs a little something.  Next time, I am going to try adding some tofu or chicken for a little more textural interest.

Rich and flavorful. Made verbatim. Mild to Medium spice level depending on your personal heat tolerance. I wouldn't sit down and eat a platter of it like a 5-star dish, but as a member of a medley, family-style dinner, it is very good. We originally garnished per the illustration - a banana slice with some coconut. On the second serving, we garnished more liberally with bananas (three angled slices per serving)and it made a positive impact. Food for thought...

Halved the recipe per guidance in the comments. Also didn't add any salt, but the spice amounts in this recipe were already a little too much, so we went easy on those too. I forgot that I was out of turmeric, so that was lame, but this still turned out to be delicious. I would definitely do a half-batch unless you have a lot of mouths to feed.

This is phenomenal! I tried it out because of how weird it sounded, and am so glad I did. I tasted the sauce pre-banana and was a bit worried, but the banana balances everything out beautifully. Also, my boyfriend can't have onions, but the omission of those did not adversely affect anything. Great recipe!

I halved the recipe and it still made about 6 servings (I served over rice). I subbed coconut oil for sunflower and coconut milk for yogurt. I think this recipe has a lot of potential to be a 5 star recipe, it just needs a few tweaks. Next time, I will try using coconut milk and yogurt like a couple of the other reviewers did... and possibly less curry paste and some garam masala in its place.
