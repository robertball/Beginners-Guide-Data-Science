Made enough for 8 people and it was ALL GONE!  Used olive oil vs. vegetable oil and the beef was mega tender.  Overall a basic good tasting Beef stew.

Very good base recipe. I made a couple changes to suit our families taste. I used 2lb meat, added 1/2 onion, diced, when I browned the meat. Also added 3 cloves of garlic, chopped, when I added the broth and 1 1/2 cup chopped celery when I added the carrots. I didn't add potatoes to the pan but served the stew over mashed potatoes instead. Big hit with the Hubby & kids!

Makes a great basic stew.  I threw in a handful of frozen peas a minute before serving and even my picky four year old gobbled it all up.  I'll make it again!

I LOVE this recipe!  Changed it up a bit too cuz I wanted to use up some ingredients in the refrig. I browned stew beef in olive oil as someone else suggested.  I used Golden Mushroom Soup and 1 pkg. of onion soup mix.  I added a bottle of Blue Moon Beer--nobody likes it in my house (!), 1 c. of H2O, 1 heaping Tbsp. of blackstrap molasses, 3 good shakes of Worchesthire, 1 turnip, 3/4 can of diced tomatoes, LOTs of minced garliic, basil, oregano, LOTs of ground pepper and also the celery, carrots and potatoes.  Then, still in the clean out the refrig. mode, I added 1/2 can of sauerkraut.  It's been cooking in the slowcooker for a few hrs. & already my whole family has been circling around the kitchen asking when we are eating...  The broth is thick, the meat smells heavenly...and the carrots and potato pieces I've sampled are really, really good!  Try this one!

FANTASTIC basic recipe!! I had never made beef stew before, and now I make it once a week! However, the last time I made it I threw in an extra half pound of meat because I felt that there wasnt enough and it was AMAZING. I highly recommend this recipe.

An excellent basic recipe!  I used this as a guideline and added an onion, some peas, rosemary, and omitted the thyme.  Also added cornstarch to thicken the broth and served it with buttermilk cornbread.

Made mine with a couple of modifications. I used 3 cans of Campbells Golden Mushroom Soup instead of broth and added peas. Also used marjoram instead of thyme.

Yum! I used beef bouillon, beef broth, yuengling beer, fingerling potatoes, and a dash of Rosemary and this was delicious! The flavors were almost too powerful so I will use much less of or eliminate the rosemary next time. Also added celery.  I served this with Beer bread also from this site and it was perfect!

One of my kiddos requested beef stew for Christmas dinner, and this was the recipe we chose. Because we were eating this over mashed potatoes (Baked Mashed Potatoes by Nancy F, very good!), I left out the potatoes in the stew and added some celery - probably 5 big stalks for my doubled batch of stew. This was very tasty, but it was much thinner than I'd anticipated; I always use much more flour to dredge meat because I hate getting almost done and having to wash goo off my hands to haul out all the ingredients again ...but even though I added probably twice the flour to the pot at the very beginning, it was still more soup than stew; just FYI based on your preference. Great flavor (my additions: about 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 chopped onion lightly browned in the pan after the beef, plus salt, onion powder, paprika & garlic powder to the flour) and pretty simple to assemble. I bet this would be a good slow cooker recipe once you have the meat & onions browned; I'll try that next. We'll have this a few more times this winter, I'm sure!

Made this in the slow cooker today and added sweet potatoes, celery & onion soup mix. Delish :0) Even my husband who doesn't particularly care for stew had seconds and my picky 7yr old actually ate it up. Served it with warm home made bread, ultimate combination, thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I loved the recipe. We altered it because my broth boiled out. We added beer to replace the broth. No complaints from the picky eater.

I made this tonight and it was terrific! I love that it is so basic and most of the time I will have all the ingredients on hand. After reading reveiws, I also modified...I made beef broth from 2 boullion cubes and added 1 envelope of onion soup mix, then added about 7 shakes of worsteshire sauce....It was sooooo delicious...it had just enough flavor with out leaning to far on any one flavor. I also skipped thyme and bay leaves. 
Thanks for this recipe!

oh, in addition, I made it in the slow cooker. Floured meat and browned, added to slow cooker. pour beef broth, onion soup mix & worescester sauce over meat and added veg.....cooked on high for 4 hours and 2 on low....it was great!

This is a pretty easy stew to make, especially since it was the first time I made one!  Hubby and I both LOVED it!  I did add Onion soup mix and some Worchestershire sauce, used 2 cans broth and added a bit more water to cover veggies.  Cook time was a bit longer since you have to brown the meat first.  This is something I will definitely make again!

This was a wonderful basic recipe for easy beef stew. Looking back, however, I would have doubled the recipe because we only got 4 servings out of it. I might also have added some green peas.

This a good basic beef stew recipe that is easily adapted to suit your family's taste. Loved the thyme seasoning in the stew. We've changed it up a bit to suit our family a little better (garlic, onion, etc.) but this is something that we'll be having often.

This is a very good basic recipe, although I think the beef needs to cook longer before the potatos and carrots are added, as it wasn't as tender as we would have liked. I used chicken instead of beef broth but added a beef bullion cube, and it turned out great - very easy and not very expensive to make.

Edited to add: I have made this several more times in the slow cooker, and we love it that way. I do brown the stew meat dredged in flour, then add it to the crockpot. I've been using about 16 oz chicken broth (enough to cover the meat and veggies) and adding about 1/2 chopped onion. We cook about 8 hours on slow, and it's perfect - the meat comes out very tender.

This is a good base recipe. After making it as written the very first time I made it, I've learned to add more veggies, and I play around with the seasonings every time I make it. You do have to add some cornstarch or flour mixed in a bit of water to thicken it. Great for winter.

This is a great starer recipe, it gives room to play with ingredients and flavors in order to really make it your own. I use this recipe whenever I make my winter stew!

So good!  I've made beef stews for 20+ years but this is the best!  I added can of cream of mushroom soup, small can of mushrooms, half a packet of onion mushroom dry Lipton soup mix.  i added about 1 1/2 cups of water (total).  I did not use thyme or bay leaf.

Yes, I tried this recipe, and it was the bomb (meaning very good). I followed the recipe to the tee and didn't change a thing. 
Thank  you for a beef stew recipe that will go into my recipe box on my counter!

I prepared this as written except I used all broth (no water).  Added a cup of frozen green beans for the last 10 minutes.  So very yummy and such an easy recipe to follow!  This was my first attempt at beef stew w/o a slow cooker and it is now my "go to" recipe!

Tasty and simple! I made a couple changes: I skipped the thyme, and would recommend skipping the bay leaf too. Also, I don't eat beef (vegetarian except for chicken & turkey) so instead I chopped up a can of Worthington Choplets, which is a meatless substitute. I didn't fry them in flour but rather just added them by themselves (they already have their own salty flavor). It turned out great, and I served it to my boyfriend who loved it also. He suggested that next time it would be good as a pot pie filling! So  I might try that next... Definitely going into my recipe book!
