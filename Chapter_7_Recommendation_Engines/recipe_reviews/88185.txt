I have been making this dessert for awhile now and it is honestly the best dessert in the world!  Every single time I make it everyone asks for the recipe. The only thing I do differently is I mix the melted butter, cinnamon and sugar before pouring on top of the dessert. It make a nice glaze. You should 100% make this. You won't be disappointed!

This recipe is awesome. I too wondered if it was too much butter, and because I was so freaked out, I reserved about 2 T of it (why bother at that point!). So I ended up using about 6T melted butter and all of the sugar/cinn mix (that seemed like a lot too) and it came out awesome. I didn't have any issues spreading the cream cheese when I beat it really well like others suggested. I am a big fan of cream cheese, and I wouldn't suggest doubling the filling. As long as you really whip it up, it's more than enough. Also, flour your rolling pin before you roll the dough out. Yum yum!

Simple and delicious.  Defiantly worth making.  I even used light cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls and it was perfect.

Excellent recipe!  Everyone loved it...No need to double the filling unless you WANT to...If you whip the cream cheese and sugar long enough, you will have plenty of filling to to spread and it spreads easily also.

This is a family favorite and is expected at Thanksgiving and Christmas on the table.  At Thanksgiving I give it a twist by using 2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, add 1/2 cup additional sugar, 1 can pureed pumpkin and 1 beaten egg to the filling.  It turns out great every time.  At Christmas, I add 1 cup eggnog, I also use 2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, and 1 teaspoon rum extract.  Instead of the cinnamon added to the sugar, I use nutmeg.  The rest of the year, I just make the good ole original one but I always use 2 packages cream cheese and use 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 1 as called for in the recipe filling.  Really most times I use Splenda and no one knows the difference.

very good! I would add just a little more butter though because it does crisp up a bit on top. Just want to add that this is not a dessert to try to make diet friendly, just enjoy every calorie! I use real butter also. I am making this for a co-workers birthday as requested again!

This was easy and delicious. I flattened out crescent rolls on a cutting board and flipped it over the 9x 13 to put in place easily. Also, I added the cinnamon and sugar to the butter. That way I could evenly pour over the whole thing.

Instead of a cake version, I used the individual crescent rolls to creat a triangular pocket, piped the filling(which we added strawberries to) and sealed it, then upon taking it out, brushed butter on, sprinkled powdered sugar and served with a strawberry dipping sauce

Definitely a keeper! Very simple to make. I let the cream cheese get nice and softened (sitting out) and then whipped it up with my stand mixer. Absolutely no problems spreading it out, and had plenty to cover the entire bottom. I didn't roll out the crescent rolls (pure laziness), but just kind of pressed them into the bottom, and it worked great. I used 1/2 the amount of butter on top (again, just what was convenient for me), and it's perfect. Next time, I'll probably cut down a little on the sugar on top. The sugar in the filling is PERFECT! This is wonderful and there probably won't be any left to take anywhere!

This was really easy and turned out awesome!  I double the cream cheese mixture and drizzled honey on top, it was great!!  I would suggest using 3 cans of dough rather than 2, it was pretty tough to spread to cover the extra filling.

I double the cream cheese. I also pour the melted butter on the top crust and then sprinkle with the sugar and cinnamon for a crisp crust.

Oh, my goodness, now I understand...this dessert is fabulous!  Deliciously rich, the temptation is to eat more than one serving!  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  I must admit, I wondered what it would be like to add some apple pie filling before the top layer, but I will experiment another time.  Great recipe!  Thanks for the idea!

Can't argue with 6 thrilled guests at a dinner party.  This was a hit.  I used 3/4 C white and 1/4 C brown sugar in the cream cheese mixture.  No need to fuss too much about smoothing out the perforations in the dough - they actually made it easier to cut evenly for serving.  I would cut the butter and sugar topping in half next time - that is plenty.  Also, feel free to make this ahead of time and serve it cold.  It was really tasty the  day after, too.

This is one of my family's favourite desserts, we make it all the time. However, there is just way too much sugar in the original recipe, I usually cut it in half, at least. Makes a perfect, fast, creamy dessert. It's also great if you have surprise company and need a quick dessert, as it bakes up really quickly, and is great when warm. Any leftovers (a rarity) are perfect as a breakfast pastry the next morning.

So yummy.  Since I was lazy I didn't want to do any rolling out, I altered that part of the recipe.  I opened the rolls and separated the dough into four large rectangles (four triangles connected.)  Just filled the center, folded them over, and pinched the sides.  I think my cook time was about 18 min.  The rest of the recipe is the same.  They puffed up nicely.  Don't worry about overfilling because they do puff up.  Oh, I did use low fat cream cheese and low fat crescents, no sacrifice in flavor at all.

Incredibly good and easy! I made this for a potluck and it got rave reviews. Don't be shocked at the amount of butter that sits on top initially....the sugar and cinnamon absorb it and it makes a nice crispy topping as it cooks. You can dress it up with a warm blueberry compote also!

All of the prior reviews were right - what a hit !!!  I also took this to a Cinco De Mayo potluck at work.  I had many requests for the recipe.  I was kind of embarrassed to let everyone know how simple it was.  A keeper for sure.

I made this for our Mexican themed movie night and everyone really enjoyed it! I only melted two tablespoons of butter and used MAYBE one one of them. (I used a silicone basting brush.) I had to bake this for closer to 45 minutes. When I pulled it out at 30, it was still really doughy.  Delicious, though and even the leftovers were a big hit! I'll definitely be making it again.

This is currently in the oven but looks/smells divine. One word of advice is DO NOT double the filling!!!! I did so after reading the reviews and it's a gross amount of filling. If you just want just enough filling to sufficiently coat the crescent bottom layer, simply keep the recipe as is. I also didn't use 1/2 cup butter on the top layer. I think you could even get away with a half a stick of melted butter on top. It's definitely a diet buster but it looks amazing :-)

As I make this yet again I thought I would throw out the lazy person tip that I never roll out the dough.  I just unroll it from the can and piece it together in the pan...can't tell the difference!

This recipe was called "bites of Heaven" by one of my co-workers.  I made it exactly as described.  You need to beat the cream cheese for quite a while (I will time it next time I make it)) until it is fluffy, almost like whipped cream.  I baked my 30 minutes in a metal pan and it was perfect.  It was fantastic warm but it did stay crispy on top while in the fridge the next day.

I made this today (I have made before as directed), but decided to try a new twist on it.  The only thing I did differently this time was to add a tsp of ALMOND flavoring.  I sprinkled almonds on top also.  It was a delightful change...just a hint of almond flavor and wow...so good!  I normally do the vanilla but opted for Almond flavor today.  Love it either way though!

Delicious! I made this recipe, except in a 8x8 pan, with only one can of crescent rolls (half the can on bottom, half on top). I like my cream cheese filling a little tart, so I added 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. Next time I might add a whole tsp. I used a wee bit less sugar and butter on top and everything came out delicious! If I ever need a 9x13 pan of this, I'll double the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

This is terrific. Everyone loved it and it was the easiest thing in the world to assemble. The only thing I'd do differently next time is reduce the sugar topping a bit. Otherwise, absolutely perfect balance of gentle flavours! Will make again and again!

SO DELICIOUS! I just made this for dessert and it was very easy to make and one of my favorite desserts now.  I whipped the cream cheese filling for a while so that it whipped up very nicely and made a lot of filling.  I melted the butter and poured it over the top layer and then sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.  Baked for 40 minutes in the oven.  So easy, yet so very delicious.  My husband even said that it was amazing and he'd be surprised if I don't eat it all tonight and leave him without any more. :)  We gave a bite to our 1 year old and she also loved it.

I am not a fan of crescent roll recipes by any stretch of the imagination.  This recipe, however, is not to be believed.  It gets 5 stars for preparation (it is so easy) and then 5 stars for taste.  Brought it to work.  It was a huge hit, and everyone asked for the recipe.  Even my non-baking co-workers went home and made this.

I thought this was fabulous! It was so so easy and my husband said it was the best dessert he has ever tasted! I just can't get over how simple it was. I plan on making it on Sunday mornings in place of cinnamon rolls :)

This has been a hit every time - I've made it for guests and for the office and I always get requests for the recipe.  I love it because it is so easy and quick to make.

I have been making this for a few years now and it is truly my favorite dessert. This recipe is exactly like mine except I have always used TWO packages of cream cheese. Trust me, it makes it that much better:)

Made this for the first time for a dinner party. Everyone really liked it. I used less butter over the top than the recipe called for and added just a bit of sweetened cocoa powder (in addition to sugar and cinnamon). We also served it with a small amt. of vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Dear god I can feel my arteries clogging as I type!! I made this tonight and it really is great. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written. The dessert tastes and smells delightful but oh man is it sweet. Next time I make it I will half the butter and sugar for the topping and follow the recommendations of others and mix it together to make a glaze then pour on top. This is a keeper just needs to be a little less sweet for us.

Yum, yum yum!! My husband thought this is the best dessert I've ever made. I didn't tell him how simple and easy it is. Kids loved it too. The whole pan was gone in only a couple of day. Next time, I'll have to make it for guests so we don't eat too much of it!

this turned out better than I expected. I went the butter+sugar+cinnamon for the glaze. I used the sheet of dough and pretty much just laid it in a 8x11 pan so I didn't have to even roll it out. Made it really easy. lost a star simply because it doesn't keep/reheat as lovely, but that probably can't be helped.

Oh lord have mercy!!! This was amazingly good. It taste a little like churros but better. The only change I made was half the butter/sugar/cinnamon toppings. As other reviewers had suggested, mix those last 3 ingredients together but make sure mix cinnamon & sugar together before adding it to the butter (I like the butter to be half melted).

This was great!  Didn't change anything.  I wasn't sure if I was suppose to use the whole 1/2 c. butter when brushing in on...so I did..ended up just pouring it all over the top, then putting the cinnamon and sugar on top of that.  Delicious!

What a hit!  I will say that I did not even COME CLOSE to using 1/2 cup melted butter or 1/2 cup white sugar for the top....I just brushed the top with "enough" butter and sprinkled "enough" cinnamon & sugar to evenly cover.  This went over HUGE for dessert and equally as HUGE when I took the leftovers to work.  A DEFINITE keeper!!

My family and I had a mexican night and I'm a huge cheesecake fan so I thought this was a great idea and it was so amazing!!!! I was worried they would be too small but they were the perfect size and it was so easy to make. We used less than half the butter and cinnamon/sugar mix because it was a huge amount but that was fine by me, a good way to cut the calories :)

Holy yum! I added the zest and juice of one lime to give it a kick, only used 3/4 c of sugar, and melted the butter with the cinnamon and sugar. A little too much butter though, I think I'll lower it to 1/4 c next time.

This is so ridiculously delicious! I doubled the filling and it was heavenly.  Tasted like a warm doughnut with filling when it came out of the oven.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar for the entire filling. Yum

I have to admit, I was really skeptical of this, right up until it came out of the oven.  It's pretty good, but also pretty rich, so just take a small piece.  You'll thank yourself.

This was a most excellent recipe!  It's really good right out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream!!   I think next time I'll use less sugar in the cream cheese mixture, though....it will be every bit as good, I'm sure.

OMG!!!! FABULOUSS!!! I doubled this batch, because hubby brought home 4 guys from his unit for lunch. So I used a jelly roll pan, it didn't fit the way I wanted, soo I patched in the cresent roll dough, 2 rolls on the bottom. Then I put the cream cheese mixture on top of that, I thought I had to much as left out about 1/2 cup--next time, I'll put it all in. Then I looked at the recipe and doubled the butter----and then didn't needed it all of it, 1/2 cup of melted butter is well plenty, I used a 1/2 cup of sugar with 1 tbsp of cinnamon, and mmmmmm!!!!!! I poured it all on top of the brushed on butter and baked it...I can't tell you how wonderful and crispy the top of this dessert was, it was soo creamy in the middle. There was only 1 piece left when that group of Army guys left my house....And they had 2nds!!!!! Amazing an A+!!!!

Question for weehotpie. Why would you give a recipe one star that you have not even tried just because you don't like one of the ingredients? I realize you are asking a question but you are also unfairly bringing down the rating for the recipe. You could have made this recipe and left out the 1 tsp. of cinnamon and I'm sure it still would have been very good. My family found this recipe (as written) to be delicious!!

This is fabulous and always a hit. I use turbinate sugar on top to give it a little "crunch" and love it that way. I hardly ever add honey, since it's already so sweet. Yummy!

This is a no brainer and super, super easy. If your family is crazy for cinammon, then turn to this one every time. I use my stand up mixer to whip the sugar and cream cheese. i also added lemon extract once instead of vanilla and it gave it a zesty flavor.

This is delicious and can be halved for a smaller crowd.  It is a great brunch recipe.

I had to tweak it to my liking but didn't do much changes. Just added another 8oz package of cream cheese and only used 1/2 stick of butter. other than that, it was perfect

This was definately very easy to make, but not what I expected.  I only used half of the butter that the recipe called for in the topping which was more than enough.  It was more like a square and was definately not light and fluffy like a pastery which is how I thought it was going turn out.  It is also very rich.

Wonderful and so easy to make - even a novice will do well with this one.  I like to use the vanilla bean paste in place of the extract - gives you some nice fine "bean" appearance  to your filling.  I wonder if anyone has ever added a fruit (apple) filling on top of the cream cheese layer to make it seem like an apple cheesecake recipe? If so, how did it turn out and did you bake a little longer to account for the filling?

I have made this twice now and everyone LOVES it. The only change I made was less butter. You don't need nearly the amount of butter that the recipe calls for. I believe I used less than 1/4 cup.

Absolutely delish!  Today was my first time making this and it's to die for!  I followed some other suggestions of reducing the sugar and the butter.  I reduced the sugar in the cream cheese to 3/4 cup.  I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup but will reduce it even further the next time I make it.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon for the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Thanks SAINTWIC for this wonderful recipe.

I made this for a 50th fiesta birthday party along with several other desserts and this was by far the favorite! The best part is that it was so simple and took no time at all to make. The only thing I changed about the recipe is the amount of sugar that was called to go on as the topping.

My spousal unit allowed as how he might like it, but he'd have to have another taste, just to be sure.  Four times.  If I were to chance anything, I'd maybe fold some blueberries into the cheese mixture, or spread some preserves (strawberry, blackberry?) on top of the cheese mixture before putting the top crust on.

My 14 year old son made this for us for dinner and it was PRACTICAL JOKE good, which in our house means it was so good that it had to be a practical joke cuz nothing could really be that good.  He was very proud of his accomplishment and we relished the opportunity to genuinely shower him with accolaids!

This is very good.  I made it as directed.  The next time though I will buy the crescent dough that is recipe ready.  Rolling out that dough was hard to do and get those seams merged together. It is better the day you make it.  It gets a bit soggy the next day but it still tastes good.

This is so good!  No need to double filling as others have suggested.  Whipping the filling until it is creamy is all you need to do.  I worked with the dough in "halves", rolling half of it out, using the rolling pin to pick it up and unroll it in to the pan.  I also mixed the butter with the sugar and cinnamon, as other reviewers had suggested.  This is a very easy, very rich dessert.  I'll make it again!

This is a new favorite in my house.  I think one package of cream cheese is too little filling.  We  love cheesecake so I used 2 pkg. cream cheese and about 1 1/2c. sugar.  Good warm or  cold.  Excellent! I will make this for the coming holidays!

Okay, so the 5* rating is for how easy it is, and how delicious it is!  This is a great recipe, but DEFINITELY not one for everyday!  The ladies at the potluck all raved about it, but I couldn't help but laugh whenever someone asked what was in it.  I did mix the melted butter with the sugar and cinnamon as suggested by one poster and it glazed it nicely.  I also drizzled a bit of honey on it when it came out of the oven (from the Sopapilla Cheesecake Pie recipe on this site).  Probably won't do that again, as it's not really necessary.  The description for this recipe is right on.  It'll go into my "it's crunch time and I need an easy recipe quick" file.

in one word: HEAVEN! This is the most fantastic dessert I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Amazing. Easy. Fool proof. Crowd pleasing every single time!! Adding another package of cream cheese will thicken up the filling if so desired. Really delicious. two thumbs WAY UP!!!

This recipe is very easy to make and easy to multiply if you have a big crowd to feed. It was a big hit with everyone who tried it-- a perfect complement to a mexican meal.

I love cinnamon, this was a hit with myself and friends as well. It reminds me of a cheese danish. My preference is to eat this chilled. Does this recipe require refidgeration? It's a keeper!!

This desert is so good and sooo easy!  I made it for Cinco de Mayo dinner with my husband and kids and everyone loved it!  Even my super picky kids!  I made a few changes in that I used 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese and added an egg to the filling.  Wonderful and very rich.  Will be making again!!

This was SO GOOD!! As others suggested, I doubled the filling and didn't use all of the recommended amount of sugar. It was sweet enough. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream...a definite keeper!!

I made this exactly as recipe said with one addition , before spreading cream cheese mixture on crescent roll dough I spread I generous layer of black raspberry jelly or whatever jam or jelly I have in stock. This adds a nice flavor to an already excellent recipe.

I added 1 extra block of cream cheese but don't double the sugar, I also add some cinnamon to cream cheese. Also, I use non stick spray on the top instead of butter then sprinkle cinnamon so it sticks. My co workers are always asking me to make this for them.

I can't add much to the wonderful reviews of this delicious dessert, except to say that I substituted 3/4 cup of Splenda for the sugar in the filling and it was still wonderful.  I used granulated sugar for the topping.  I also put a bit of cinnamon in the filling. My husband liked it so much, he posted compliments on Facebook.

This recipe was fantastic, don't get me wrong; however - it is SOOOOO sugar filled and RICH that I just don't think I can handle it again.  I doubled the cream cheese, although next time I will not double the sugar in the filling.  Also, 1/2 c butter is way too much.  I was extremely pleased in the way the filling mixed with the croissant dough to create a cobbler-like center; it made me think of all the meal-style menus I could use it for in a hot pocket style fashion.  This is a great dessert if you aren't super sensitive to extreme sweets.  If you are, I strongly suggest tailoring it down to meet your needs!

If you only put half the sugar in all of it,  I think it would taste better.  If I make this again that is what I will do.  Also just made half the receipe because there was only two of us and it taste best fresh out of the oven.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it is always a crowd pleaser!  Most recently I brought it to a large picnic that included my extended family.  Two women gave me their email addresses so that I could send them the recipe, and my family was upset that they haven't had it before, and want it to be a staple added to holiday menus. 
As for variations;
I tried it with up to 3 packages of cream cheese in the filling, but I think it's best with 2.  It's also very good with a quarter cup of honey drizzled on top after baking.  Next time I will experiment with adding a layer of fruit pie filling before the top layer of dough.

This is quite possibly the most delicious dessert in existence!  So easy to make and everyone loves it!  No changes needed to the recipe, except sometimes I used reduced fat crescent rolls and cream cheese (tastes exactly the same and then I can eat more)!

This is an easy to make version of cheesecake, but it tastes great. I gave it four stars instead of five, because it didn't need all that butter and sugar on the top. Next time I will reduce those two items considerably. We all loved it, especially after it had sat in the fridge. In fact, we liked it so much, I will be making 3 pans of it for our son's wedding rehearsal dinner!

I filled pouches of crescent rolls with filling instead of just putting crescent rolls on the bottom of the pan and on top of the filling.  They turned out great!  I thought that there was too much sugar in the filling, but my husband thought that they were amazing!  Next time I might make these with a little less sugar or maybe even using powdered sugar instead so it blends in better.

One of our favorite recipes!  It is always a hit when we take it to a pot luck.  We will double the recipe and cut down on the sugar by half.

I took this in for a Cinco de Mayo party at work. It got rave reviews-- even from people who didn't know what a sopapilla is! I'm not sure if there is any difference between Mexican vanilla extract and regular vanilla extract, but all I had was regular and that's what I used. Still turned out great!

This was a fantastic dish to make--and easy!  Everyone was in heaven eating this dessert.  Definitely a keeper--I'm even thinking I may use this as one of my Christmas "cookies".

This is a simple and simply amazing dessert that can be tossed together in snap when having company.  Put it in the oven just as dinner finishes up and it's perfectly ready for dessert.  Definately add fresh fruit (sweetened with a little sugar) over the top of this.

Ok i made this and it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but overall, a pretty simple and fast dessert. i'm all about low maintenence. next time, i'll cut back on the sugar about a quarter cup. oh yeah, i also put about a teaspoon of lemon juice in it. Balanced out the richness a bit. MMMMMmmmm.....

My husband's remark was this could become habit forming!  YUMMMMMM! I had trouble getting the crescent rolls in the right shape. Going to try the sheet kind if I can find them, next time, and yes there will be a next time and a next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent dessert.  Try using Mexican vanilla for a different taste.  It's much less expensive than vanilla extract and gives it a truly unique flavor.

This is absolutely AMAZING. A++++! I also found the one package of cream cheese, after whipping, to be plenty, but I added cinnamon to the filling too, because I love it. I'll admit that it was a little challenging to roll out the crescent roll dough and transfer it to the pan in once piece (I also rolled them out in powdered sugar and not flour), but I think it's that the "generic"/store brand crescent rolls I used aren't as good as brand name (Pillsbury doesn't separate as much when using it for baking purposes, I've found). It was SO good, I sent leftovers to husband's work and relatives, as a whole pan is quite dangerous for two :) This would be a good easy cinnamon roll substitute for brunches and other morning events too! YUM!

A to "die for" dessert!! It just may too with all the goodies in it!! I did double the filling as some had mentioned but didn't use it all. I just didn't want to come up short. I probably had about 3/4c filling left over. The crescent rolls were easy to work with. Once I had them rolled out on my bread board I "pinched" the seams so that they wouldn't separate when being rolled out  I dusted my pin and started rolling. Check often as they don't have to be rolled that far! Just and inch or so will be enough, at least with my glass pan. I also followed the advice about mixing the sugar and cinnamon in the melted butter. Be sure to mix the cinnamon into the sugar BEFORE you add the sugar to the butter or you'll have a hard time getting the cinnamon "lumps" out of the mix. Don't ask me how I know!! ;-) Took them to a pot luck tonight and they were the best! There was 9 people for dinner and of the 9x13 pan only about 6 or 7 pieces came home. I was hoping they all would get eaten, by others that is!! These aren't health food by any means!!LOL!

Like it says, so easy AND so good! I have never bothered to write a review before, but I felt the need after last night when the family agreed this was heavenly-still warm from the oven. One change was: 1/2 cup of melted better seemed like alot to me -so I only used about 2 Tbs. then sprinkled the cinnamon & sugar.

This is my new "go to" recipe if I need an easy but fabulous dessert!  I assembled this in about 5 mins and enjoyed the aroma that filled my house.  My husband and kids could not wait for it to cool.  It was great - it didn't last long at all!  I followed the recipe to the "T". I may try adding a strawberry or raspberry jelly and serve as a bruch pastry.

I have to admit, this was a strange recipe to prepare.  It seemed like cheating using a canned pastry & was too simple to seem special enough for a Christmas dinner party.  I bought a "back up" dessert - just in case.  What was I worried about?  After slicing into squares, I tasted what was left on the knife...uh, yummy!  That carmelized cinnamon crust was delicious and who doesn't love cheescake?  I had doubled the recipe but wished it was quadrupled.  Everyone at the party went back for seconds or thirds.  My husband bagged a couple & put them in the 'frige so he'd have leftovers the next day.  My family asked for the recipe & chouldn't wait to make them after I admited how easy they were.

This is the best dessert you could possibly ask for. Our Bible study group requests it at least twice each month!  It is absolutely wonderful (even if it doesn't contain chocolate!).  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe...you have made several people VERY happy.

Really yummy!  I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 pan.  I used fat free cream cheese and couldn't tell the difference.

Very yummy, I can't stop eating it.  I bought extra cream cheese and crescent rolls because they were on sale...will be making this again very soon.  I did double the filling as others recommended.  Try this, you will be glad you did!!

This is SO easy AND delicious! I made it for a taco night with friends, and it disappeared quickly, with requests for more! I've made it several times since, and it's always a hit! The only change I make is that I only use about 1/8 of a cup of melted butter on top. 1/2 cup is WAY too much!

The perfect compliment to any mexican or spanish dinner. To make it easy on myself, I microwaved the cream cheese for 30 seconds before whipping it with the vanilla and sugar - that made it go way easier and there was more than enough to cover the crust. This is a fool-proof, sure to please recipe - I highly recommend it!

This is the best - not low cal but definately worth it!  The recipe as written is perfect, easy to make, and a nice change up from traditional cheesecakes.  Of course, you can alter ingredients to taste or dietary needs as with any recipe, however, no changes are necessary.  As a preference, I drizzled a little honey over the top after removing from the oven.  This is great warm, reheated, or cold, but do refrigerate left overs (if there are any)!

This is an absoloutely GREAT recipe. It's effortless. There's no way someone could mess this up! It was easy to make, tasted great and was enjoyed by all at our family gathering! I added just a little more cinnamon and sugar on the top, but besides that followed the recipe as written.

This was excellent and easy.  It tastes more like cheesecake than I would have expected based on the ingredients.  We used reduced fat crescents and it was still plenty rich.

I doubled the recipe and used my homemade vanilla bean extract and it was ahhhmazing!  This was the dessert course of our Christmas dinner and complimented our Slow Cooker Tortilla Soup perfectly and my family couldn’t get enough of it!  I bake all the time and my husband even said it was the best thing I had ever made! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Oh my word, this was so good!!! I cut the recipe in half, and used the ingredients I had available. I used only one can of crescent dough and a smaller jelly roll mold. Cut dough in half and I followed the suggestions and mixed the cream cheese and sugar until it was totally spreadable, melted butter and mixed with sugar and cinnamon for glaze.
My husband was not able to wait until dinner was served and ate dessert first!

i agree with other reviewers -- 1 cup of sugar is enough, a little more cinnamon and vanilla and less butter for the top. Make sure you check the center to make sure it is done, and you will love it!

My family loves these cream cheese squares, as we call them. They were life saver for me few times when I wasn't in a mood for baking or cooking, but  needed to take a dish to a potluck ..
And many people requested the recipe !
But the recipe as is, is too sweet. I cut down the sugar by half, both in the filling and the topping. Also all that butter is not needed. I only use 2 tablespoons.

It needed more cream cheese and less butter and sugar.  I doubled the cream cheese and added 1 tsp vanilla bean paste. I used 1\3 less sugar on top and only  1\4 of the butter called for. I drizzled honey on top as well. It turned out good with the modifications.

Really yummy! I was hesitant because it seemed like too much butter, but the dough absorbed nicely. I lucked out.. Stater Bros carries crescent rolls in dough form! Just open and unroll! Anyway, I decided to kick it up a bit and added some orange liqueur to the cream cheese mixture and topped with homemade cinnamon whipped cream. The ideas are endless with this.. Delish!

I made exactly as recipe states and it was pretty dang good! But a little too sweet for my taste, and I love sweets! I would half the amount of sugar in the topping next time and I think it will be just right! I will definitely make again, with this alteration!

I love this! I made it originally with almond flavoring instead of  vanilla because I love almond flavoring. It was so amazing!! I did not change anything else about the recipe and I never will. I would never double the cream cheese because it would be too much. It is perfect how it is written. I also did not roll out the croissants the first time but I did the second and it made it easier to spread the cream cheese on it because it did not move around, but it was good either way. This is so easy to make and really is amazing.

Excellent desert! Perfect ending to any meal but especially Tex-Mex night!  I do drizzle honey over the top for a more authentic sopapilla flair! Also, some sliced almonds on top are delish!

Delicious! You can add coco to it to give it a chocolate favour, or chocolate chips.  Add jam or anything to it to change it up and it's still delicious!

My family LOVES this recipe! So simple and easy. It is made even easier if you use the crescent roll sheets (have only found them at a smaller family owned grocery store) -  no sealing the seams. I usually make this in two 8x8 pans - one for us and one to give to family.

I made this recipe for a potluck dinner. It was a huge hit and the club printed it in the monthly newsletter for all of the members. The only thing different was, I put sliced almonds on top before baking, giving it a crunch and added flavor. The almonds look pretty also.

I have made this recipe many times and a few variations also. It has never failed to please, or stay around for very long. Get your camera out quick if you want pictures!   I love the cinnamon and sugar, definitely my favorite. Runner up was a version I made with red and blackberries. I used lemon juice, and sugar for the top as a glaze.  Really tasty, but who turns down cheesecake?

I personally thought it was 4 stars. However, when I came home half was missing. That person said she could not stop eating it and her BF did as well. Friends and family tried it and they all loved it and raved about how great it was. Some asked for the recipe. I was surprised and knowing that so many ppl loved it made me love it too.

Very good. I did however add an egg separated and omitted the butter. I added the yolk to the cream-cheese mixture and brushed the egg white on top of the second crescent top. I then sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on top and baked it.

I have made this 3 times so far. The 1st time I followed the recipe exactly except that I mixed the final 3 ingredients as per reviewers suggestions. I loved it but it was a little too sweet. The 2nd time I used less sugar & there wasn't enough filling & the top was funky! So the last time I used the full amount of sugar but added more cream cheese. I also sprinkled the sugar & cinnamon on the top. It was awesome!!! Next time I plan to add a can of blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese...

It is SO delicious and incredibly easy!  Being a cinnamon lover, I sprinkled a little of the cinnamon sugar on top of the cream cheese mixture before I put on the top layer of crescent rolls.  YUM!

Added a can of peach pie filling (dice up the peaches in a small dice and add before topping with the 2nd can of crescent rolls) Turned out wonderful! Any pie filling could be used.

This is so good.  The  sugar was too much for us, even a half of cup was too much.  I actual used some lemon juice to cut even a half of cup of sugar down.  I will make this again and use even less sugar.  Thanks & so easy!

Huge hit!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Had a bit of a hard time rolling out the dough and getting it into the baking dish.  Use flour when rolling it out.

Awesome stuff. I decreased the filling and butter still came out great. Did I mention that I hated cream cheeze before I made this?

O-M-G!!! I am a big big big choco-holic, and even though this cheesecake doesn't contain any, this is one of my top favorite dessertS! So easy to make, and damage proof. Only thing I had trouble with was rolling out the dough since it sticks and it kept shrinking. Other than that, AMAZING! Try serving warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!

Maybe it's that I'm used to homemade cinnamon rolls, but I thought these were just okay.  I won't be making them again.

If I could give this recipe any more stars I would. This is simply the best recipe ever!  I made this recipe for my co-workers with one particular co-worker in mind and now my department requests this on a weekly basis. One coworker asked me for the reicipe and made it for another department at the hospital that I work at and they loved and have since passed the recipe on.  this is truely a great recipe. thank you.

I made this exactly as the recipe instructs, and brought this cheesecake to a recent potluck where I received many compliments!  While I only had a bite, my husband enjoyed two pieces and said I could make this for him anytime.  Thanks for this great recipe!

SO easy and so good.  My guests were making comments about wanting to lick the empty plate!  Tip:  Sprinkle top with cinn/sugar and then dot with refrigerated butter pats.  I tried doing it per the recipe with room temp butter and it was a mess.  Make extra of these.  You'll need them

My review is for taste - I haven't actually made this.  My friend brought it to a cookout and I had to get on here to find the recipe!  Awesome!

This recipe was really easy... and really delicious. I added an egg and some extra honey into the cream cheese mixture and it was perfect. I didn't know how it would be the next day but it was even better than before!!!

This was pretty easy to make and my family seemed to really like it. We had it slightly warm with vanilla ice cream.
