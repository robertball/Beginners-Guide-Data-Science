This was good, but I tweaked it quite a bit. I didn't use tomato juice or yogurt; instead, I blended two very large beefsteak tomatoes (for a total of 3). I omitted the onion, and I added raw corn cut from the cob for some texture and a little sweetness. I also chopped a third avocado and stirred it in. I blended in about 1/3 cup of cilantro, added 1 tsp of sea salt, and added a sprinkle of cumin to each bowl. I may add garlic next time. A note about the flavor: With 32 oz of tomato juice, this is not going to taste like avocado. The avocado is used only to add a creamy texture. This soup has a nice flavor, but if you're looking for an avocado-flavored soup, this isn't it.

An excellent cold soup.  I doubled the recipe, used very large avocados, added 1/2 cup more tomato juice, and served 11 people nicely.

This was good and very refreshing.  The soup is definitely more tomato than avocado.  Would be delicious with real sour cream (of course).  I also wonder if it would be better with lime juice instead of lemon juice.

You could not taste the avocado at all and the green pepper was very overpowering.

Gives a new twist to gazpacho and a very tasty, good recipe.  I let everyone add their own cayenne as I do not like spicy foods.

I made this just as written except that I only used 6 oz of yogurt.  It turned out great, although visually it was very unappealing, as another reviewer mentioned.  I really enjoyed the flavor, however.

I thought this soup was very tasty, and my family enjoyed it as well!  It was a great idea for lunch on a hot day (we had mexican blt sandwiches as well).  I did saute the onion and the bell pepper just a tad before adding them to the soup because my family would not have enjoyed it as much if those ingredients were too overpowering.  I also seasoned it with a little black pepper (in addition to the cayenne), and I only used 2.5 cups (20 oz) of vegetable juice instead of a quart of tomato juice.  I really wanted to taste the avocado because I was using some nice ripe ones.  I processed it in a food processor and then put it in a blender to make it smoother, and I really don't think it looked unappealing at all.  It has a similar texture and color to many bisque-like soups.  Once it was garnished, it actually looked quite pleasant, and it turned out to be tasty as well.  This recipe may not fit everyone's personal taste, but it is certainly worth a try!  I will definitely make it again!  :)  Thanks for submitting it!

I just made this soup, and everybody liked it except for my 3 year old nephew. My niece (who is two) loved it though, she is currently completely covered in it. I also did not have any onions, so I added two spring onions, and I added less than what the recipe called for in tomato juice (I think about half), and instead of mincing the tomatoes, I chopped them, and added them. I made steamed asparagus, minted corn and goat cheese baguette, and shrimp in a parsley and garlic sauce  with it(I had to feed a whole lot of people), and it was all OK, except maybe for the asparagus (it just doesn't really fit). Everything has been eaten. It really is a bit intense for a main dish, I think it would be fantastic as a starter.

I really disliked this soup; the taste of onion and tomato juice totally overpowered the avocado.  Tasted like acidic salsa.

Yummy!  I doubled this for our family of big eaters.  I cut the tomato juice by 2 cups (in a doubled recipe) and used half lemon half lime juice as I was out of lemon juice. Delicious!

I really wanted this soup to be good but it was pretty awful.  I feel kind of upset that I wasted a really good avocados.  the soup is too acidic and the onion was overpowering and i only used half. also, the color of soup was not appealing what so ever.  the green from the avocado and the red tomato do not make a pretty soup.

Hm...you must like mild guacamole, because I doubled the lemon juice, added more cayenne, some cumin and chili powder.  I used low sodium V8 juice for the tomato juice.  And did not peel the tomato.  Overall, very good.  I love the silky texture of the avocado and the yogurt.  I think it would be good topped with crumbled feta or cojita cheese.  It's a keeper!

Made this recipe using half the amount of onion and green pepper the recipe called for (as per other comments).  I really hoped to like this since it is so healthy, but found it just "okay".  It seemed to acidic for both my husband and me --  I was just a little disappointed.
