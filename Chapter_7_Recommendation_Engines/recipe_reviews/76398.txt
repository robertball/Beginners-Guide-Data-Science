I have tried this recipe twice in the same day.  I would not recommend using the honey.  It had a horrible aftertaste.  Second I would not replace the oil with applesauce.  It made it way too Dry.  I would recommend changing the honey ingredients to sugar and more orange juice.  Secondly, I think the time/temp is incorrect.  It was raw inside in 40 minutes.  I have not given up hope on this yet but I would be cautious in making this.
I did not put the pecans in.

The dough was delicious, although I would add more flour to the recipe. And I found that the honey was the best part.

I cut this recipe in half (except for the egg and butter) and only used 1/2 cup nuts.  I also used lemon peel instead of orange zest and increased the orange juice a little bit, due to other reviewers' suggestions.  This was very flavorful and a great recipe that doesn't have sugar in it.  I couldn't even tell it didn't have sugar.  Even after cutting it in half, I got one large loaf out of it.

This was wonderful!  We like that it's not too sweet.  We baked it in four mini-loaf pans and gave as gifts with homemade apple butter.  Makes the house smell great as it's cooking!  This is a keeper!

Overall, this bread is just ok for me. It's a nice bread, but the orange flavor is more of an after thought. It could use more zest and juice in it, I think. I also thought that the dough mixture was almost too dry; and could definitely benefit from some extra orange juice. It also formed a thick crust that I just wasn't too fond of (I'm thinking it's due to using honey instead of sugar?). I would make it again with some changes, and maybe add in some blueberries or cranberries for extra flavor.
