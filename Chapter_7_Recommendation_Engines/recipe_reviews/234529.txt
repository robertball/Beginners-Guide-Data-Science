This dinner was just ok for us.  It was quick to make, especially since I had the taco meat already made ahead in the freezer.  I used spicy chili-lime corn chips that added extra heat.  I omitted the olives as we are not fans, but kept everything the same.  My chili beans and salsa were "hot" in flavor to give the dish a little extra punch.  I served this with sour cream, additional salsa and fresh jalapeño slices.

Turned out really good! Only changed a few things. Didn't add the chips into the bake, we waited and added after to have more crunchy chips. I didn't add olives. And we added a spoonful of sour cream to the side to dip in. Definitely a meal I'll be making again!

I didn't like the texture of the cooked fritos. Next time, i'll pour the ingredients over fresh fritos.

This was an expensive flop. Too dry. And who puts black olives in a Tex-Mex dish!? This was a yankee dish that’s only OK if you’re starving. Had to personalize this to make it edible. Thank God I didn’t make this for a party or something. My GF and son will get me a cheaper coffin because of this dish :/

This is great for a quick, easy weeknight meal. I omitted the olives, used thawed frozen corn and used regular fritos and it came out great!

Great recipe.  I made it per specs with only one slight change.  I added some beer to the meat mixture.  Probably a half cup or so.  Only thing I would change is to either add some tomatoes or add more salsa.  But that could just be my tastes.  I would definitely make this again.

I agree with the reviewers who described this dish as “okay.”  It was definitely missing some flavor. It’s an easy dish to make and could be a great go-to for a last-minute meal. If I make this again I will definitely up the flavor factor with chili powder, cumin, and red pepper.

I didn't have any chili beans so I used ranch style beans which we sometimes put in our chili.  I served it with a salad and the entire meal was delicious.  Excellent recipe.  Will definitely make it again.

I have been  looking for a good Frito pie recipe. Still looking after this one. How can a recipe be too spicy and blah at the same time? Not sure, but this one manages it. Sorry
