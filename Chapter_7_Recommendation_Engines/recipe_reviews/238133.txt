Superb!!  Absolutely superb!  The wonderful aroma from this dish still lingered through the kitchen and dining room on into the next morning.  The dish itself was fantastic.  Even my wife, who doesn't like "spicey" raved about it. The flavors were simply outstanding.  Another "TEN" star from Chef John.  Didn't change a thing -- Okay!! just one thing.  Used just bone-in/skin-on thighs instead of the whole chicken.  So, shoot me.

MY OH MY!!! This was absolutely delicious. I used yellow and red bell peppers because that is all I had. Other than that made as directed and it was perfect. I am still puzzled by the review that described this as "too sweet". Between the briny flavor of olives and capers, this dish was FAR from sweet. Easy, hearty, budget meal to feed a family. Thanks for sharing Chef John!

Absolutely loved it!  I did tweak it slightly though (sorry Chef!) - used a mix of white and brown rice and topped with a cut up rotisserie chicken.  I don't have an oven proof pot so I placed the rice mixture in a 13x9 pan, arranged the chicken pieces on top, covered tightly with foil and baked for just under an hour.  (Brown rice takes a lot longer to cook than white.)  Smelled so good while it was baking, we couldn't wait to dig in.  We loved the wonderful blend of flavors in this chicken and rice dish!

I made this single dish meal tonight for my family of six ranging in age from 6 - 43.  It was a hit.  I used black olives instead of green as that's what I had on hand, an did not include the capers as I was out.  I also used 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of two due to the overwhelming media coverage on reducing sugar intake as of late (sigh).   Overall, easy and tasty.  The 6 year old found it a bit spicy, but she is catching on to our table flavors nicely and did manage to eat at least the chicken bits.  The presentation is lovely; when you remove the lid at the table, all of the chicken is nicely presented on top of the rice combination and smells just wonderful.  Thanks Chef John!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. Not as spicy as I expected with the cayenne pepper. Next time I will add more since we like spicy food. The green olives and capers give it an interesting, slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt. Cumin was the predominant flavor. If you don't like cumin, cut back on it but I wouldn't eliminate it altogether. The chicken was done through but not overcooked. If you watch Chef John's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion. Some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for. And he does not include the back pieces of the chicken. I did because I like those bony parts. All-in-all, a good recipe and worth repeating. We are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of us and it makes a lot.

Excellent! Easy to make but prep be sure to prep veggies while chicken is browning - just a suggestion. Picky husband pronounced it a keeper. I agree.

Came out great! Did everything exactly per recipe. I've been to Puerto Rico twice, and it does remind me of the aromatic and flavorful food of the island. Just missing the Medalla cerveza!

This recipe has replaced my 50 year old chili recipe handed down from my grandfather on football sunday.  It's that good. Everyone LOVES THIS.  I only made one addition...added some additional capers. SO SO good.

This is stunning.  The flavours form a magical combination that will overwhelm your guests, and it really isn't difficult to make. I'd also add that the recipe is very clear, which is nice. I had to make two minor substitutions, based on what was available (the chicken was boneless and skinless; I had a pile of sweet peppers I needed to use, so they stepped in for the bell peppers) -- I doubt they made a significant difference, but I'll go for skin-on next time, as I prefer it. And there will definitely be a next time!!

Loved it but the rice was far from done when the chicken hit 135 edge at about 28 min. This is not far from same thing others found. So I just kept cooking until the rice was done. Took about 55 min with chicken hitting 200 deg. That was not a problem for the chicken as it came out perfect.  The onions, olives were over cooked however so there is something heeded to improve this dish - but not spices as that was excellent.

Followed directions exactly but added 15 mins to oven time. When i checked after the stated 3o mins the rice was not cooked and the chicken was cooked but not through to the bone. Instant read thermometer only hit 145. Flavor was overpowered by the smoked paprika. After 45 mins rice was still not completely cooked.

Wow, I rarely comment on dishes but this is a most impressive exception.  The flavor is amazing and the smell while cooking was wonderful.  The only change I made was adding some mushrooms (just because I like them).  Don't shy away from this one, make it and enjoy.  Chef John didn't disappoint --again!

Great recipe! I used brown rice (personal preference) and cooked it in the oven for 50-60 minutes, then took it out and let it sit covered for 10 minutes to let the rice soak up all the flavor.   Loved the aroma that this meal gives off. My girlfriend loved it too so I'll be making this again.

Very good.  Followed one reviewer's suggestion to get everything prepped before browning chicken and it really  helped since there are so many ingredients. My son pronounced it a keeper!

I made this and followed the recipe almost exactly (used bone in breasts and thighs instead of a whole chicken) and it was phenomenal! Reminded me of some delish paella I had in Spain. Try it, you'll love it!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except used all red bell peppers instead of green.  My chicken pieces took so much longer than the 30 minutes to cook that the rice ended up being so overcooked it was mushy.  The flavor was good, but my family wood not eat the rice at all.

This was a great recipe even with my omissions and substitutions. My husband is a very picky eater so I had to make some changes. I left out the capers and olives and used only breasts. The flavors were amazing. I can only imagine how good the original recipe is. Thank you for yet another great meal!

I only had left over deboned chicken (2 cups chopped) and wasn't sure it'd work but it's 'gotta have seconds' delicious!  I am not much of a cook but this will fool 'em ;)

hey chef john!  I made this tonight for the second time. my husband does not like capers or olives but he DIED over the his dish!!! I lived in South America when I was younger, and my Panamanian step mom taught me how to make this dish from scratch.  The ONLY difference is we add threads of saffron and use yellow rice and toss in some pigeon peas towards the end. I made your dish exactly as written with the addition of a pinch of saffron threads. ferikkennominal!!!! ya I just made that word up.  I love YOU your videos and most of all YOUR FOOD!!!! Thank you so much!!!!

Made this last night, and everyone loved it! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Used about 12 chicken thighs since we had them. Used more garlic since I LOVE garlic. And added more green olives to finish the jar. Also added more chicken stock to help cover the chicken due to large amount. Should have added more rice, but it was still fine. This is easy and very delicious. There were 4 hungry adults for dinner, and we have enough left overs for another meal tonight. Will definitely make again. A great meal for people avoiding dairy and gluten. Delicious, thanks, Chef John for another outstanding dish.

This was very good and was better the second and third day as the complex flavors seemed to intensify. I'd add a bit more cayenne next time,  but I like hot.  Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious.  I halved the recipe using 4 bone in, skin on chicken thighs and it was perfect.  I baked it about 10 minutes longer, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I am an olive lover, so I used the garlic olives from my local gourmet olive bar.  Never cooked with olives before, the piquant flavor is incredible.  Yummy!

This is now a family favourite.  Even my picky eaters love it, and it's even better the next day for lunch.  I wouldn't add the salt since there is quite a bit in the capers and olives I used.  Fragrant and delicious, you have to try this.

Chef John has a way with making everyday favorites a little more special. I was going to make regular chicken and rice with cream of chicken soup but I was glad I saw this. 

The pros: 
It uses ingredients you probably already have around the house.
Easy and quick prep.
Very flavorful.

Cons:
Maybe a little spicy for some, but this might be due to the fact I used a jalapeno because I didn't have bell peppers.

I try to stick as closely to whatever recipe I'm making as possible the first time around, and then I almost always find reasons to tweak them the next time. NOT SO WITH THIS RECIPE! I always love Chef John's creations, but this is one of my favorites. It's really very great just the way it is. For the amount of flavor it packs, it's not really that time-consuming, either. Definitely a keeper! Thanks, Chef John!

Made exactly as written, and it was fabulous.  The chicken and rice were both done after 30 minutes in the oven.  The finished product is attractive, and I will be making this when I have friends for dinner.  You simply can't go wrong with Chef John's recipes.  TY

As is my custom, I followed the recipe closely the first time out and was very happy with the results!  Next time, I will start a little earlier and let the dish rest a bit for the flavors to meld.  Right out of the oven was good, but an hour later was better.

Also, I added a few boneless chicken breasts for one member of the family.  BORING.  This recipe really enhances juicy dark meat.  My thigh pieces were delicious.

This is a fabulous dish I make regularly with many variations on the theme.  Yes, this is Chef John's variation of the Latin American staple Arroz con Pollo, that you may create your own successful variations of and thoroughly enjoy.  Feel free to add sliced mushrooms, celery, or carrots. Add Sofrito or Recaito or both to the water seasoned with a teaspoon of Better Than Bullion chicken base. You may use chicken breast, trimmed chicken thighs or both,  cut into bite sized chunks, seasoned with Adobo or as you like and sauteed separately with diced onions in butter and served on the side or mixed in with the finished rice.  However you may choose, it adds tremendous flavor and great nutrition to an otherwise boring plate of white rice.  My wonderful wife is from Latin America and she taught me well! lol

This is very good except it is way too hot.  I like spicy food and usually enjoy middle eastern spicy foods. I think that the smoky paprika you have in the US must be a lot milder than what I buy here in Israel.  I will make it again but reduce the smoky paprika by at least 1/2.

This is a great recipe.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, black olives, and replaced a half cup of broth with white wine, which makes a great dish even better, in  my opinion.  This is a family favorite.

Oh lordy.....drool worthy!!!!!! This is so freaking good. I will add this to my regular repertoire. Only change I made was using chicken breasts instead of bone in chicken due to family preference. Followed recipes to T. I already want it again

I made this tonight using boneless chicken breasts and brown rice. I increased the olive oil because of the chicken breasts.  Using brown rice the baking time needs to be increased to at least 75-90 minutes and at 375 degrees.  With those adjustments,  it turned out delicious.

I made this just as directed and it was great. My family loved it fresh and also as leftovers the next day. Ike some others, I found it needed additional  oven time for the rice to absorb the liquid. I think that's just a simple matter tweaking the amount of liquids used. Otherwise it came out with the desired texture and fantastic taste.

I'm all about one pot cooking. Browned the chicken in a Dutch oven, removed it to a platter and poured the water over the meat. Cooked all other ingredients exactly as instructed in the Dutch oven, returned chicken & juices to the pot, and then into the oven.. Very, very good! Another great recipe Chef John!

The only change I made was to use black olives instead of green (kids' preferences). The flavor was absolutely lovely. The only change I'd make for next time is to change the ratio of chicken to rice. Our family of four polished off all the chicken on the first night but had lots of rice left over. Next time, cut the rice in half or double the chicken (and given how popular it was, doubling chicken would make more sense!).

I used boneless chicken and left out the bell peppers.  I cut the smoked paprika from 2 tablespoons to 1 because that just seemed an enormous amount of paprika, and it was still so overwhelmingly spicy that no other flavors came through.  The flavor of the  green olives and capers got lost.

Basic recipe idea is great and we have had many versions ... but this was too "sweet" for our taste... and not too exciting... basic procedure was good... and most spices worked... but will look for a better spice combo for this dish..loved the garlic/cumin/cayenne/paprika.. just was missing something!

sorry!

Simple. Terrific and Tasty! This dish was cooked completed on the stove top. Since I only had brown rice, I cooked the rice (in chicken broth) separately for 30 of the 45 minutes the package called for. I then added the rice to the pan added the chicken back in covered and cooked low on stove top. I repeat-Simple, Terrific & Tasty!

Chef John you knocked this out of the park :-)  It was wonderful.  The change was very small, I used 1/2 smoked paprika and 1/2 Hungarian paprika. Halved the salt.  Then for color and I needed to use, I added green beans just prior to putting in the oven.  I was glad I did! It might have violated the integrity of the recipe but I liked the texture it added.  I would definitely make again especially for company.  I liked using the whole chicken but a little harder to eat with company and the bones

So, so good!  The flavors are just right and even delicious as leftovers.  I used four thighs and four drumsticks since I couldn't find a cut up fryer in my small town, but they worked out perfectly.  MMmmm....

Followed recipe using 3.5 lbs of boneless skinless  chicken thighs.  Left out tomato paste cuz family member has allergy to tomatoes.  Didn't miss it.  I made it night before for  next day dinner.  Next day got phone call at work from granddaughter and her friends to tell me it was delicious and they wanted to let me know  they loved it!  Yep, it's a keeper!!

This was amazing!  I was craving my old saffron based chicken and rice, but decided to give this a go since I didn't have saffron on hand.  It had depth thanks to the smoked paprika and touch of cayenne!  I had to keep myself from a third helping :0)

I really love this recipe. I’ve made it a few times now, it always comes out awesome and makes a ton of food. The only deviations I make from the recipe are using boneless skinless chicken thighs, no oil (the fat from the thighs provides plenty), I omit the water and instead of using all chicken broth I do a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of beer and chicken broth to make it taste like Cuban pollo borracho, and lastly I add peas. Super tasty!

I added turmeric and Goya Sazon, because my family loves the packaged yellow rice. I didn’t add olives, because my family believes they’re poisonous. I used chicken thighs and was looking for a good braising recipe. My family loved it.

We loved it as written.  Had rice left over and combined it with cooked shrimp, last of the chicken shredded and cut up cooked sausage and made amazing jambalaya.

Wonderful flavors. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I may try some diced tomato in it next time. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thanks so much.

I have made this recipe several times. At first sticking to the recipe but over time, I've added slightly more olives because that's what we like. I sometimes substitute chicken drumsticks instead of chicken thighs.

Every once in awhile, I check on the dish and add a bit more water if I think things will end up burning before the cook time is over.

Homerun!!  Takes a good bit of prep time, for a home cook, but 100% worth it. Made a couple of minor revisions, mostly to save a little work or add a titch more of a favored ingredient. Used an Olive Muffalata mix instead of cutting up green olives. Also, added an extra tablespoon of capers. Otherwise, as written. Truly a great dish. Will make again and again!!  Thanks Chef John

My husband, who is Hispanic, thought the cumin was too overwhelming. The chicken was good, cooked for 45 minutes and it was perfect and so was the rice . I will make again but I will definitely cut back if not eliminate the cumin.

I'm usually a great fan of Chef John's recipes but we didn't like this at all. Hubby and I agreed it was not something I should make again.  I can't quite put my finger on what it was that I didn't care for but there was definitely something that didn't seem right to me and I followed the recipe except I used Hungarian paprika instead of smoked since I didn't have any. Still a Chef John fan just not this time.

Fantastic recipe! I always try to follow it as written, with the exception of using the same pot to brown chicken then transfer the chicken to a plate while I cook the rest of the ingredients in the same pot. I add the 1/2 cup of water to the rice before putting into oven. I have used it with boneless skinless chicken breast and it works well. I have made it with tomato sauce once  since I was out of paste and that worked just fine too! I have made this dish so many times and it's always devoured by my 4 children (5-13 years old) and husband. Never any complaints! Thanks again, Chef John!

Just love Chef John and making his recipes.  This was no exception....  our daughter in law is from Puerto Rico and I made this for our Sunday get together with the family.  It was a winner.  Even my husband who is a "regular meat and potatoes" guy loved it. Made it as written except for using just the chicken thighs. The rice and veggies were just perfect! Thank you Chef John for yet another.....

Very different flavors. Smoky & salty! I actually  used rotisserie chicken browned up then added the rest to a skillet & simmered the rice for 20 minutes covered. I'm sure it would have been even better with fresh chicken.

I made this tonight for my family and it was a hit! The aroma from the meal cooking in the oven kept bringing my husband into the kitchen, eagerly waiting for the finished product! I followed the recipe exactly except for a few changes. I made half the recipe. I seasoned chicken with seasoning salt and freshly cracked black pepper and browned chicken in my cast iron skillet. I sub'd cooking cherry for deglazing the pan after browning chiken, transferred to a plate, and then sauteed veggies and rice in the same pan. I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth to 1 cup of rice, cooked in the oven for about 43 mins and the texture was perfect! Everyone raved about this meal and kept going back for seconds and thirds! Even my 14 month old couldn't get enough! It reminded me of the paella dish we had at Tappas Papas Fritas. Thanks Chef John, you are amazing at what you do and we love you!!

I don't know if this was the problem or not.  I probably should have cut the whole recipe in half.  When I defrosted my chicken, is what thin sliced breasts, and I used half the rice (Minute Rice).  I was afraid it would be too much liquid so I used about half the broth and didn't add the extra water from the pan I cooked the chicken in.  Cutting back on the liquid worked out, as far as the consistency of the dish, but maybe the olives and capers weren't diluted out enough and their flavor overpowered it.

Dish came out delicious , however browning the chicken makes a mess with the oil spattering. Wondering how it would turn out using scallops & shrimp in place of chicken. Any suggestions?

this was great.  My housemate who has been a sous chef in 5 star restaurants said that it was that level of aroma and the flavor of the rice was amazing.  (I overcooked the chicken a bit)  I will cook it again.

I made this today - my husband really does not like rice because he says it doesn't taste like anything, but he actually went back for seconds of this rice! I used a few marinated chicken leg quarters from the Hispanic meat market up the street. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Very good! Next time, I may add some diced jalapeños or a little more cayenne just for a bit more heat.  This was really good, will make great leftovers for the week, and will be made again in my house!

I like the flavor of this dish and it was pretty easy to make. I needed an extra 30 min to prepare the ingredients. I omitted the olives and capers (not my favorite flavors) and instead of a green bell pepper I added a poblano pepper and anaheim pepper. I blackened both in the oven at a high broil and let it steam for 10 min ad took the skin off before chopping and adding to the mixture. I also usedboneless chicken thighs. Overall very good!

It was really good but I would let it sit for about 10 min before eating so the rice would soak up some more of the liquid

Didn't change anything and it turned out great. Cooking times were spot on. My husband and sons all liked it. Personally, I think I would have preferred regular paprika to smoked and I will change it for the next time but that is just a matter of taste preference.

This worked out very well. Made it just as it was outlined and it turned out great. It's a lot of food and it tastes great even as a leftover. Definitely not something I would have thought of. The olives are an intrical part of this recipe so don't leave them out.

Absolutely A+! I prepared everything short of the adding the broth in advance,  and when my guests arrived I added the broth and the chicken and put it in the oven. I will definitely be making this again.
*I wonder if this could be adapted to the crockpot?

Excellent.  Just cut the salt in half.  The olives and capers were enough for us.  Other then that cooked in the over for 35 minutes and it came out perfect.  As others said maybe a little bit more cayenne pepper next time.

This was a very savory change from our normal chicken and rice. The family gobbled it up. I did notice in the pic that it looks like black and pimento olives were used. I used just the green olives but next time will try perhaps a variety of olives.

Delicious! Never would've thought I'd like the green olives & capers combo but it was awesome. Followed directions exactly. Used a Dutch oven. Chicken & rice cooked perfectly in exact time.

The flavors were good but it was nowhere near cooked after 30 minutes. After 45, the rice was still crunchy. Could be a good recipe if I figure out timing/temperature and liquid quantity.

My husband loved this recipe, I thought it was OK, so I'll compromise with a 4-star rating.  If I make this again, I would at least double, and maybe triple the spices, garlic, and capers.  It had good flavor, but not the flavor impact of a typical Chef John recipe.  The only change I made was to use boneless, skinless chicken breast.  I know this changes the flavor (and fat content), but it's  the seasonings that need adjusting for my taste.

The flavor of this dish was really good! Only change I made was to use 1/2 white rice, 1/2 brown rice. Per other reviewers, I originally cooked for 1 hour. Took it out, and rice was not done! Bumped the temperature up to 400 and put back in for another 30 minutes. Rice was better, but still not done! Another 15 minutes, and it was edible, but still could have cooked for longer...That said, I don't think I recommend using brown rice, as it takes FOREVER...But, as I mentioned, the flavor was really good. Will make again either using all white rice, or by pre-cooking it.

These flavors are wonderful!  Love the brine of the olives and capers, just enough heat from the spices.  For low carb people, use grated cauliflower instead of rice (cut back on the liquid) and omit the sugar.  I used all thighs and per the recipe, they were perfect after 30 minutes.

5 star for flavor....4 for execution. A few things. ..add 1 cup water....put 1/2 over chicken as directed and another 1/2 cup over the rice mixture in addition to broth.....if not then as others mentioned,the rice will remain uncooked....also up the cooking time to at least 45 minutes....I omitted the capers...and substituted a little Chipotle chili pepper in place of cayenne  and used regular paprika....delish

Delicious, especially the rice mix, and will make again. Will brown chicken more next time. I used less paprika since I find it a bit overpowering. Marked down a star since needed to cook chicken 20 minutes more than recipe listed.

Do not use 4 cups of broth.....3 would be best for rice.  Mine was gummy at the bottom of the pan but the flavor so are very good together. I added kalamata olives to the recipe and they fit nicely with the green olives.

This was flavorful and very good. I did not have any green olives so I used sliced black olives (which I do not recommend as they did not blend well with other flavors). I also forgot the sugar and did not miss it. I used Uncle Ben's brown rice and it cooked up fine. I found that browning the chicken in oil over high heat was too hot, the chicken started turning too dark after a few minutes and then my smoke alarm went off. I think cooking over medium til browned would work fine. Enjoyed the flavors!

I cooked this last night. It is a keeper. Great depth of flavor. I used all bone in thighs which for me is my favourite part of the chicken. I also went a little heavier on the cayenne. I like a little heat. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use a little more salt. GREAT!

Followed the recipe exactly except used red and yellow peppers...which were on hand.  It turned out perfect!  So delicious and aromatic. Not too spicy...just the right amount of spice.  I used Jasmine rice and it cooked perfectly.  I will make this again.

My rice was really mushy. It did have really good flavor though. I would make it again but not put the rice in right away.

Incredibly flavorful!  I made as directed using boneless chicken thighs and cooking the peppers with the onions (I like mine a little softer).  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This. Look. Awesome! And I always love your recipes, but I want to use brown rice. Do we partially cook it first? Completely cook it and lower the liquid? Please help me out here.

This was very good.  My husband loved it!  I did make a few small changes.  I used a combination of chicken tenders and boneless, skinless chicken thighs in place of a whole chicken, I chopped the green olives because there's no way my picky family would have eaten them if they knew they were in there, and I added about 1/2 pound of thinly sliced smoked sausage with the peppers.  I needed to bake the dish for 45 minutes before the rice was done and all the liquid was absorbed.  It was a little soft for me (I prefer firmer rice), so I will either decrease the broth by 1/4 cup or bump up the rice a bit next time I make this.  Thank you, Chef John.

This dish rocks! I didn't make it exactly as the recipe called for only bc i didn't have all the exact ingredients. So instead of a whole chicken, I only had thighs. And I had no green peppers so just added red and yellow.  Also I only had one cup white rice so I mixed in some brown rice and I guess it just requires longer to cook. But what a tasty delicious recipe! I will be definitely making this again!

But I don't like capers so I just threw in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. ALSO a few dashes of Sarachi sauce made it just the right temperature!

For some reason, neither of us loved this dish. It was OK, but more like something I'd throw together just to get food on the table. I generally like anything with green olives and capers, and I'm a big fan of Chef John, but I'll pass on this in the future.  It looks like I'm in the minority, so go ahead and give it a try.

Rice was lovely. A bit spicy but we liked it. Didn't cook the chicken part. Only change was to add cooked chicken mince to rice mixture and cooked in rice cooker. The flavour really was nice. Didn't add capers or olives, but added diced celery instead. Thanks for a great recipe.

Tasty, hearty and definitely delicious, but the prep took me way more than 15 minutes. I only had boneless chicken tenders in the freezer (not a whole chicken), so I used those - followed the directions pretty much exactly except that I only left the "large pot" in the oven for 20 minutes, not 30, assuming that boneless chicken would cook more quickly.

OMG!!  I used skinless/boneless chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken.  Followed the recipe as written with the exception of the capers - I didn't have any.  The rice was very tasty with wonderful color and aroma.  The chicken was a flavorful and moist.  This is going to be my new chicken & rice recipe from now on!

This was WONDERFUL!  Never tasted such delicious rice -  I followed the recipe virtually verbatum - a tad less smoked paprika cause I had never used it before and 2 tablespoons seemed so much - Lots of prep work but I find it's best to measure everything out before you start - especially with so many ingredients.  I bought little bowls for spice portions  just for this purpose.  I bought a cut up fryer and then cut the breast pieces each in half using kitchen shears and removing part of the ribs cage.  That is what it looked like he'd done  in the video. I did this to increase the pieces of white meat but mainly  I was concerned about what what member said about her chicken not being done at the 30 min mark.  So I browned as directed, added the water and set it aside and then made the rest, as Chef John did. Made sure my oven was fully preheated and brought my final mixture up to a full simmer before putting it in the oven.  First time using my new porcelain glazed cast iron dutch oven (looks like the video )  I tested the chicken at 30 mins and it was over 165 - closer to 180.....I left the lid off for 5 more mins to brown a little more - but that probably dried my breast pieces a bit..... should have not done that.  None the less - my husband and I  had 2 large helpings and will definitely make this often.

This sounds wonderful with good reviews but how long should I cook for with either brown or white/wild rice mix?  I would have to leave out olives (ick!) and capers are iffy with hubby.  I don't believe I would need to make other changes though.  Thanks for any advice.

This was a hit! I used legs and thighs only and cooked them all the way through before adding them to the rice mixture, then cooked for 45 minutes.  We loved it!  Next time, I'll probably add some peas and a little more cayenne.  One of my favorites so far.  Thanks Chef John!

Great recipe:  made a couple of shortcuts and it turned out really well.  Bought rotisserie chicken: deboned it; put the carcass in stockpot with water, carrots, celery, whole peppercorns, bay leaves and a little kosher salt, to make homemade chicken broth.  Let simmer an hour.  Strained it and set broth aside in separate container.  Then sautéed onions in olive oil for a few minutes in stock pot until almost caramelized and added peppers, olives, capers, spices, tomato paste etc..  Added rice, then when totally coated deglazed with 1/2 C white wine.  Then added the homemade stock and the chicken pieces and it simmered on the stove for 15 minutes, until rice was done.  Wonderful!

Excellent recipe. So good and such a cozy dish for a chilly night!! I didn't have green olives & I omitted the sugar. I added celery & carrot, to the veggie saute, just to add more vegetables. I used chicken thighs, as I thought it would help in having the chicken cook evenly, to have all the chicken pieces roughly the same size. Seasoning is right on, I wouldn't change it at all. I live in the Northwest, and in our grocery stores, the smoked paprika is in the bulk spice section, and is called Spanish paprika. Took slightly longer to cook than stated, but, was very close. Ours needed an extra 12-15 minutes for the rice to be really done. Thank you for an excellent recipe!!

A great combination of flavors. I used chicken breasts, so they were a bit dry. Next time, I will add them to the pot part way through the cooking time, so they stay moist.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe - using 3 thighs - otherwise followed as directed.  The ratios held up and cook time was just a bit shorter. Next time I might try adding more bell pepper to up the veggie content but really it was perfect as is. Thanks for another keeper Chef John!

I didn't make any changes. I will make this again, it was a little fatty maybe think about how to reduce this. Also cut the garlic up a little smaller, this wasn't the recipe's fault!

Will make it again for sure. I didn't have the capers and red pepper...but the dish was loved anyway, so I'm sure would even be better. Perfect lazy Saturday dinner meal for my clan, one pot dish.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I had removed the sugar, and we hadn't noticed a difference... but you may not want to do that if acidity is something you are worried about in a dish. :) Unfortunately, and totally not the fault of this recipe, my husband does not like baked rice, of almost any kind, because he does not like the sticky texture. Oh boy! So, to make this recipe (which is one of my personal favorites!) I am going to try something totally crazy... like unhulled (not pearled) barely, which should keep its shape... or something like it... I may even try quinoa since its cooking time is roughly the same as white rice (but might still be tricky because it technically has a different liquid ratio) Oh well, again not the fault of this recipe, purely the preferences in texture of my hubby!

I just made this and thought it came out pretty darn good considering I'm a terrible cool and forgot the olives and capers....but my question is, once you bring the flame to a simmer, do you keep it on the stovetop while the rice cooks and then put it into the oven or do you place it in the oven right away and let the rice cool in the oven? I did the latter, not being sure, and had to cook if for almost triple the time. It still tastes great but would like to know for future reference.

We really liked this dish but it needed just a bit more kick.  I used drumsticks and added homemade, sun dried, yellow tomatoes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I served this with jalapeno collard greens and we ended up mixing it with the rice on our plates.  Yum! I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks Chef John!
