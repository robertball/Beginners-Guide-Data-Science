I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter is thicker than a regular brownie batter, but I had no problem spreading it in the pan.  I baked it for 35 min and turned out great.  I melted choc chips on top.  I like that it uses whole wheat flour - a little less carbs.  My husband and I thought they were good, chewy, but not quite enough PB flavour.  I think I would like to add PB chips to it next time.  If you don't like a really sweet brownie, these are for you.

I use a stick of margarine (1/2 C), 1/3  C white sugar, 1 C brown sugar, flour the same, but add approx 1/3 C combined of ground flax and wheat meal - to sneak in some more nutrients & make up for the extra buttery flavor! I like to experiment with recipes - this one has great "bones" and lends well to it!

Better than a PB&J! I always use butter, and natural PB. The batter is thick, but they bake up moist and chewy. I loved that they weren't too sweet- a great alternative to a chocolate brownie, and one that the kids can eat more than one of without bouncing off the walls!

I used crunchy natural peanut butter, white whole wheat flour, and flipped the sugars to use more brown sugar.  I added a good dose of vanilla and threw in chocolate and peanut butter chips and baked in a 10 x 10 pan.  They were eaten within a couple of days and more have been requested.  Next time, I'll add a bit more PB and use all whole wheat flour and more peanut butter chips.   *update* Made again and used all white whole wheat flour, 6 TBS butter, 1 TBSP vanilla, omitted the water, added an additional 1/4 c PB, and added chopped Snickers.  Oh my!  They are delicious!!!

I made these on Mother's Day & they were incredible, even my husband really liked them & he never likes sweet stuff like this. I made just a few tiny changes however. I made it a 1/2 cup of butter instead of the margarine, I made it a 1/2 cup of white sugar & a 1/2 cup of brown sugar & just white flour since that is what I had on hand. I frosted them as well but I think they would have been just as yummy without any. They were very chewy, sweet & moist ( like a brownie should be)...this is my first reveiw, I just had to say how great these were! (:

Good - not terribly sweet.  I added chocolate chips, and feel this was essential - brownies wouldn't have been sweet at all without them.  Nice, dense texture. I substituted almond extract for the vanilla, and wouldn't recommend this.  The almond overpowered the natural peanut butter I used.

these were ok. My brothers liked them but I don't think these had enough flavor. They also had this weird slide down your throat texture. I probably won't make these again.

I make the chewy peanut butter brownie recipe from this site all the time, and decided to try this one today.  I actually like it more than the other. I think the wheat flour actually enhances the flavor. I was going to drizzle them with melted chocolate, and then my son asked it he could just dunk his in the chocolate, so we ended up dunking them instead of drizzling.  Huge hit!

I like these brownies but they aren't very sweet or rich. I added chocolate chips to the batter and cooked them for at least 45 mins but I had an 8x8 pan. Pretty yummy:)

Great recipe! I love sneaking whole wheat in when ever I can and it works wonderfully in these blondies. I used crunchy peanut butter and there was plenty of peanut flavor. I also mixed in about a half cup of chocolate chips because in my opinion, peanut butter is good but it's always better with chocolate. I had to substitute almond extract because I was out of vanilla and that worked great too. It's always exciting to try a new recipe and have it turn out so delicious!

These were AMAZING! I used organic honey roasted peanut butter and I really could taste the extra sweetness without the extra bad stuff! They were moist for days and were a big hit with kids! Super easy, great recipe!

Mine took longer to cook -- about 40 minutes. I added white chocolate chips and they're delicious. However, they are VERY oily. If I make again, I'll reduce the amount of PB.

They're chewy, they're peanut buttery and whole wheat flour has stumped me again... I used Earth Balance, swapped white and brown sugar measurements, added about 1/4 cup more PB (used both creamy and crunchy), 1 tablespoon vanilla and threw in 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Mine baked MUCH longer than 35 minutes because I only had an 8x8; I would not recommend this. They're good - I don't know if I'll make them again, but they're good.

I didn't enjoy these at all. They were very bland; maybe more peanut butter would help, but it just seemed like a waste of ingredients to me.

Mine came out dry and crumbly. I added chopped nuts, 1 cup brown sugar, crunchy peanut butter, cocoa nibs, and used spelt whole wheat flour. It cooked too quickly in 20 min and the edges were burnt. I can see cookies working better. The batter was pretty dense.

I baked these for 30 minutes and they came out dry.  I'll give them another try and check them at 25 minutes.  I added some diced milk chocolate bar and that was definitely needed.  The flavor is very mild.

These brownies were okay, they were lacking in flavour as other commenters said. They were really easy though, so I will probably make them again and tweak them.

Here's a tip for spreading thick batter in cake pans.  I dip my (clean hands) in water and shake off excess then lightly spread batter where I want it.  The water never soaks in or causes any change to the end results.  Do it right before putting brownies/cakes, etc. into oven, the minute amount of water simply evaporates!  Oh, and by the way, this recipe is yummy!

YUM! I made these with all whole wheat flour, a little extra water because of the extra whole wheat, and added some honey and oats to the recipe. WOW. These were absolutely delicious! They came out to the perfect moist & chewy consistency for brownies. Yum!

Followed the brownie recipe exact, only sprinkling a cup of dark chocolate chips over it right as it came out of the oven, then spreading the soft chips like icing over the brownies. I then sprinkled chopped dry roasted peanuts over that. Mine came out dry, I have to say that it might be my oven. Nice basic peanut butter blondie. She's right, you can't tell it's made with WW flour.

Just finished making these.I was worried they might be a bit greasy &  i was right.Not so bad you cant eat them but just a tad.Next time i will cut back the butter(i used smart balance).Just a bit to sweet for my taste but that isnt the recipe that was me today i added a bit more by mistake,lol.I used chunky PB, added semi-sweet chocolate chips & PB chip's, i need to use up.I also used egg beater's in place of the egg's & all whole wheat pastry flour.Moist yet wee bit chewy.,YUMMY!I think i might throw in some oat's next time too. I will be making these again as my Daughter & Dad love anything with PB in them and this is a wee bit better for them than regular brownies & i can send them to school for snack & feel pretty good about it ;)Thank you!

I really liked this recipe! I used regular all-purpose flour. I also needed to use 1/8 cup of almond butter since I ran out of peanut butter. This was an EXCELLENT recipe!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! If you like peanut butter and brownies, then this is great! It's very quick and easy to make and my whole family just loved them! I put chocolate icing on top and that just put them over the top!!
