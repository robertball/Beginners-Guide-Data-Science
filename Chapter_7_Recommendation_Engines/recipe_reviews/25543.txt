This recipe is so easy to make. I ended up rolling the bread with a rolling pin to make it flatter and then spread the cream cheese mixture. What wonderful fast and tasty appetizers!

To help keep the shape during refrigeration, I roll them up into wax paper and secure them by twisting the ends.  Another variation is to make some with wheat bread, pimento-stuffed green olives, or black olives.  You can also use Cheeze Whiz instead of the spread mentioned in this recipe to add a splash of color to your plate.

Instead of bread try ham, I know it's a little different than what the recipe calls for but it is delicous.

I mashed my bread down quite a bit. It cracks if you don't & it stays togther much better, once rolled, if you do. I added fresh minced garlic as well as several twists of pepper. Also, be sure the seam side is down when you slice it...if not the bread sticks a bit to the knife & it tries to unroll. I was taking this to a b-day party at a park on a very hot day so I popped them in the freezer an hour before I left. It worked perfectly to keep them cool.

I made this for a baby shower(pickles and ice cream) and it was a hit.  Such an unusual recipe but it presents very well.  I rolled the white bread with a rolling pin before proceeding to the next step.

It has been a while since I made this, but they are great. If you have pickle lovers around they will quickly disappear. You can also use dill spears and tortillas instead of bread.

Yum yum YUM, I'm making these again for thanksgiving!  My aunt found me onion juice in a bottle which I thought was neat as I squeezed the onion by hand the first time I made these.  The onion juice will make it a cinch!

After reading the reviews I thought I would try this for an appetizer table last night.  They just sat on the table all night long.  Anyone that did try them had a perplexed look on their face like "what is in here?"  They weren't horrible, but they just didn't tempt the guests at all. My daughter did like them though.  Don't think I would try this one again.
Thanks for the recipe though.  I like to try new things.

I haven't made this recipe, but my favorite snack since I was a kid is having a slice of ham, with cream cheese (I like herb and garlic flavor) spread on top and roll a pickle in it and cut into 1 inch pieces held together with toothpicks. So good. The tortilla might help to keep all together I suppose.

I really liked them but they were not a party hit. I have made these wrapped with bread like this or wrapped with ham or turkey slices if you are going low carb.

These are tasty. I hate that the bread cracks as you try to roll them, but a little mashing fixes that. I like anything with a bit of grated onion in it, so I enjoyed these. Am curious to see how well they are recieved at my next party.

Was a bit scared to make these, but glad I did.  They were a huge hit!  Made a double batch and not one was left.  Gave the recipe out to 4 people that same night.

Tasted like pickels in cream cheese and that's all. Wasn't a bad tasted, but prefer a little more "wow" to the flavors of my foods.  Won't make again.

Love this. Usually just roll in ham slices, but have made them with thin sliced marble rye sliced thin from the bakery. Also, serve a mustard dipping sauce. Adjust seasonings in the cream cheese for different types of pickle. I always add garlic powder, though.

My hubby hated them, my son loved them, my brother in law gobbled them up and I thought they were OK. I flattened the bread out some by rolling a glass on it, I used onion and chive flavored spreadable cream cheese and i cut regular size dill pickles lengthwise. I skewered them with toothpicks to hold them together and put an olive on every other one for appearance and served them whole instead of cutting them into 1 inch pieces.

I made these for work and for a 4th of July party.  Everyone loved them and gobbled them up.  Easy and delicious.  Something about the soft bread and the crunchy pickle appears to everyone.

Doable for a casual affair such as hamberger hotdog night. With a little tweeking I presented them with minced raosted red pepper, cracked pepper on top and a dusting of feta on top for fancier affair. As I was limited on funds and all the ingredience where in the pantry -except feta- this reciepe IDEA worked for me . Thank you!

My husband absolutely loved these.  But no-one else seem overly impressed.  He even spread the left over cream cheese mixture on his sandwiches.  And he's already asked me to make them again for New Years.

My husband just loved these.  Trying to figure out the best way to cut them to have them stay together for a nice presentation.
