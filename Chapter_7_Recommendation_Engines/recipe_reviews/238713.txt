Really good!  I added broccoli and cauliflower (because I had it on hand), but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Oh my!  This oneâ€™s a keeper, thanks!

I followed this recipe as written and it was really great. I like chicken italian sausage and usually prepare it with tomatoes and pasta but wanted something different. This made a delicious and healthy meal with a side salad. And it was easy too.

I really like this simple, healthy recipe. I used spicy chicken sausage and used about a half a cup of olive oil with fresh parsley and rosemary and a tbsp of truffle oil.  I used about double the amount of vegetables. and added butternut squash. and shredded a little cheese over the top. It came out very tasty, and could be served over pasta and i love that it was not loaded with cream/cheese. Thanks!

My 9 year old daughter said this was so good she almost cried.... with that, I made a few adjustments. I used a sweet yellow onion instead of red and bell peppers in place of the roasted peppers. I also used Italian seasoning instead of rosemary. Next time I will take the foul off 15 minutes early instead of 10 because it wasn't as browned as I would have liked.

I made this with what I had and added some extra herbs. It was a huge hit. Can't wait to make it again. Definitely a family favorite that I will add to our monthly menu.

I love this recipe! Very filling and tasty. The only thing that I did not like about it is that I found it slightly flavourless. Next time I make it I might try it with more rosemary added. Other than that it was fantastic!

Sounds good, but I found this in the vegan section lol I don't think sausage counts as vegan. I love sausage but I'm starting to gain a lot of excess weight so I'm trying the vegan diet. One day I'll try this recipe though
