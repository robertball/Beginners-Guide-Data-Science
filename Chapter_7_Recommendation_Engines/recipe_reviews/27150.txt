Soooooooo easy, sooooooooo yummy.  I love the cinnamon flavor with the chocolate.  I've always related cooked pudding to the ones my aunt used to make with the skin and grossness and I never liked them.  But this comes out so rich and flavorful, and strangely enough, no skin, really.  Make the effort and don't leave out the toasted coconut, it's worth it for the taste it adds.

This pudding was so rich my kids only had a few bites. Also, it got this gross film on the top.  Otherwise it was ok, but i wont make it again.

We made this for my niece's Cinco de Mayo party at school.  She needed a dessert and we needed a quick recipe.  This was precisely what we needed because it was quick & delicious. We'll definitely make it again.  The cinnamon is a flavorful additive that everyone liked. The toasted almond was a great topper.

Made this recipe for our Mexican them dinner.  It was a hit.  The cinnamon seemed to be a bit odd at first but it was delicious.  Will definately make again.  I even used fat free evaporated milk and it was yummy.

So quick and easy to make! Smooth pudding taste is a good followup to spicy Mexican dinner. Use fatfree evap milk to save on calories/fat.

This pudding was delicious. I even made it with non-fat Evaporated Milk and my friends loved it.

Rich and creamy (slightly more grainy than my old Betty Crocker recipe, but so fast and easy it's worth it.)

My daughter made this for an assignment she had for Spanish class.  Our whole family liked it, but not as much as regular chocolate pudding.  You really have to like cinnamon.

This was a fabulous dessert and so easy to make. My guests suggested that they were tempted to lick their dishes clean. I plan to make it again this weekend.
