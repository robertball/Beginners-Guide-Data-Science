I've been making vinegar slaw for years, so this one isn't new to me, but I do like it.  The colorful veggies really make a very nice presentation, and the apples give you a little pop of sweetness.  I didn't think there was enough dressing, so I did double it and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Nice side dish to start the new year when many of us are focusing on eating lighter.

We loved it--the simple dressing combined with the sweetness of the apples was delicious.  I forgot to buy a green pepper, so I used red and yellow, and added some extra color with some chopped chives.  This is fantastic with barbecue!

This was very tasty! It tasted better a bit later, after all the flavors had a chance to work together. I doubled the sauce, but next time will cut the sugar in half & probably add some chopped jalapeno! :)

Although this slaw is packed with nutrients it lacked in dressing. I had to double the dressing with a little less sugar. If you want to impress company this colorful slaw will work.

This is a tough recipe for me to rate objectively.  While I don't LOVE IT, as 5 stars would indicate, I DO love how nutrient dense it is for a low calorie return.  Add to that the fact Mr. LTH said he "liked the slaw" and he HATES vinegar and it'll definately get repeat action at the LTH house.  I did double the vinegar, but leave the sugar the same, as I wasn't sure 2T would coat.  I messed up and bought broccoli slaw mix instead of the bagged cabbage and it worked out well.  I think next time I'll sub a Granny Smith for the Golden Delicious.  THANKS for such a good for us recipe, sandra!

We loved this recipe!  It made a huge bowl but the two of us made it through most of the bowl with brats as a main dish.  I have very few leftovers.  I used store shredded slaw and used 4 T cider and 3 T sugar since the mixture needed more liquid.   This is a keeper!  Thanks so much for sharing!  It looks so good too!

Simple, light and crisp. A refreshingly easy way to dress up a salad. Love it.

Loved this!  Used a bag of pre shredded cole slaw, one red pepper, one orange pepper,  one golden delicious apple and one gala apple.   Tripled the dressing but probably could have just doubled, as there was juice in the bottom of the bowl after the salad sat in the fridge for a while.  Served this as a side dish for smoky grilled pork chops from this site along with some baked beans and corn.  Wonderful meal!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Very delicious. I added 1 extra tblspn of the vinegar for a bit more kick.  It went perfect with Asian pork.

After reading the reviews, I doubled the dressing and it was great.  Next time I will try a sugar substitute to decrease the calories a bit.  Also, I used 1/2 head of red cabbage.  I loved the colorful presentation.  I will be bringing this to all my summer barbecue parties!

Excellent! Recommend using apple cider vinegar for a bit more apple flavor.
