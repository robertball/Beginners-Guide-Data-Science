This is tasty and filling, and I'll make it again. The pastry shells were much smaller than I expected (first time I've used them), but since I was feeding only two of us, that wasn't a problem. I thought the sauce was a tad thick so I may thin it next time. But it's a good dish, and lends itself to customizing. Next time I will almost certainly crumble bacon on the top, and maybe throw in some mushrooms.
