Very flavorful, even with just 3/4 teaspoon of the chile paste. (Leftover paste was nice in scrambled eggs another day. Spicy huevos!) The halal grocery store was closed the day I went to get my lamb, so I ended up making it with pork from the freezer instead. I served it over black rice, for a full-on Indian-Asian-American mashup.

I reduced the amount of water and cayenne, and also had to replace the lamb with pork because it wasn't available this time of year. It came out absolutely delicious! No leftovers!

Lime juice instead of vinigar.  Very good, so tender they fall off the bone.
