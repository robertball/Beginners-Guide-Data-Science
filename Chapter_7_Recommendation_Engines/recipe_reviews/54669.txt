This was one of the best homemade chilli recipes my husband and I have ever eaten. It was very easy to make! The only thing I added was some cayenne pepper sauce to make hotter the way my husband likes it!

This to me did not taste like chili.  If I were to make again, I would omit the baked beans because they literally melted completely into the chili and became the predominant flavor.  No matter what I tried, I could not tame the baked bean flavor and it tasted a little odd with all of the other ingredients.  Not bad, in my husband's words "different"

This chili was absolutely delicious! I followed the recepie to a "T" - and only added spices to suit my  taste.  I will admit the baked beans threw me off - but once I tasted the final product - WOW!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Made this chili with 2 lbs of ground turkey; added 2 green peppers and a can of jalapenos; used light and dark kidney beans, as well as black beans. Added lots of chili powder and green tabasco to make it even spicier; omitted mushrooms. Guests loved it and after making in a large pot, placed in crockpot for 4 hrs on high. Best chili in a long time. Served with homemade spanish rice and great cornbreads.

This was absolutely wonderful!  We celebrated with it for July 4th...delicious and easy to prepare.  I used ground chuck and more turkey and mushrooms than called for, and amended the spices to paprika instead of chili powder.  We are still enjoying the leftovers.  Thank you!

Very Good!  I only had Turkey so I just used turkey. I also added a can of corn and I probably quadrupled the seasonings. Next time I will add some heat to it-maybe a jalepeno!  Awesome recipe!

Nice chili recipe that has a sweet flavor to it. It is reminiscent of a recipe that a dear old friend used to make, and he was pleasantly surprised when I made this for him. I might spice it up a little more next time, but that is a personal preference.

I used 2lbs of ground turkey&no beef,30 oz of kidney and baked beans since its only 2 of us. Also added cayenne pepper,bell pepper&onion but kept the spices the same. Cinnamon was a great flavor. I normally make chili using McCormick or other chili mixes but after simmering for 2 hrs this was waaaay better.

I really liked this chili. There were a few things I changed for personal preference. I only added two cans of baked beans, and then two kidney and two pinto. I added about 1/3 cup brown sugar, cumin, and some red pepper for kick. It ended up tasting very good, and is a huge hit with my husband. Thanks for the ideas!
ps Don't worry about adding liquids when you're making this. It was really thick at first, but after it had simmered covered for an hour it was the perfect chili consistency.

I think the thing about chili is the variety of recipes.  There are so many kinds, some simple and some very complex.  This is definitely a simpler recipe.  I am suffering from a pretty painful injury, so when I saw this recipe I thought it looked funky, fun and (most importantly) easy to try out.  I did have to do a little improvising based on what I had.  I used pork and beans instead of baked beans, so I added a small amount of brown sugar and ketchup.  I couldn't find my cinnamon, so I substituted a sprinkling of gram masala.  I used all ground beef, no turkey.  Added crushed red pepper instead of cayenne and a large can of diced tomatoes rather than the stewed ones.  I cooked it in my instant pot on the chili setting to meld the flavors.  It was pretty good.  We dollopped sour cream and tried a mango hot sauce the first night and had leftovers the next day.  I thought the mushrooms would be kind of weird and they were, a little. So this was a sweet and spicy chili with an interesting mix of bean textures.

I completed the recipe as directed, but was unhappy with the result. The result was a very sweet chili, overpowered by the cinnamon and baked bean base. My kids did not eat it. My wife said the first bite "shocked" her. Will not make again

Full disclosure.... I haven't even served this yet and I am rating it because I am standing at the stove with a spoon eating from the pot (don't tell the kids). This has to be the most unique, flavorful chili that I have ever had. I love the vague hint of cinnamon that will keep people guessing. The only think that I would change next time is I would add another can os stewed tomatoes. Can't wait till dinner time.

I halved the recipe using only Ground turkey knowing well that beef provides more flavour but trying to keep bad cholesterol levels down. I also added a small can of chick peas and chopped mushrooms and a little cumin for added flavour. Very tasty.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe, but had a bunch of leftover baked beans to use up, so I thought I would give it a try.  My family really liked it!  The sweetness of the baked beans mixed well with the spice, and the cinnamon added an unusual, exotic flavor.  Will make again!!

Great recipe with a few slight alterations. First, I used all ground beef and left out the cinnamon. Also only used 1tble spoon of chili powder to cut down on the spicy. Also added 1/ cup of ketchup and 1/3 cup of ortega taco sauce.

it had a weird maple taste I think from the pork/beans....  I think it could have been good with regular beans...

I enjoyed this dish well enough. The flavor is plentiful and good, the recipe easy to make.
