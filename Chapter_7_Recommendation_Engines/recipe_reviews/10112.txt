I reviewed this earlier but wanted to update because I've made them several times since then.
I figured out something; don't put the peppermint extract in the chocolate until it is fully melted. If you put the peppermint extract in the chocolate and then melt it in the microwave the extract burns the chocolate and makes it crumbly and hard, hence those reviewers having to use oil to make it smooth again.
Once the chocolate is fully melted stir well and then put your extract in!
For the holidays I used white chocolate chips too. Also crushed some peppermints and added green and/or red sprinkles.

So easy!  What a great idea...that I kind of changed.  Instead of Ritz crackers, I used Nabisco Famous chocolate wafers and melted Andes mints.  I am not even kidding how great these were!  Thin, crispy and chocolaty!  I am thinking about making sandwiches with the wafers with marshmellow cream in the middle and then dunking them in the melted Andes mints.  Oh the possibilities!  Try these, you won't be sorry!

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: Be sure to use a napkin (or your finger if they're just for you) to wipe up the extra chocolate that spreads around the cookie after you've dipped it, so you don't have a sloppy finish when the chocolate hardens.  Another idea is to spread the ritz w/ a little peanut butter & then dip in chocolate!  However, be ready to do them fast and put them in the freezer for 5 min. so the pb doesn't melt! UPDATE: So I originally made this and loved the recipe because my kids could make them and it took 5 minutes.  Problem is, we would take them to parties, & people easily knew it was a Ritz, and that's kinda embarrassing.  Not to mention the salt! So, after trying several cookies, I tried a nilla wafer AND PERFECTION!! They don't break in half easily like ritz, so you can manage them easier and they taste JUST like girl scout cookies and no one can tell it's a nilla wafer inside! On paula dean, they took 2 sugar cookies and baked it w/a mint in the middle so another idea on how to use those mints.  I use 1 fork, and give it 2 lifts up and down so the excess chocolate can drip off then place on baking sheet line with foil or wax paper, and it's usually enough to catch all the excess chocolate & I find andes mints taste a LOT better than using the peppermint extract.  So, I buy a whole case of andes baking chips when they come out around holidays!

This is the BEST! It tastes just like 
the Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies but it
is so easy & much more affordable!
I make it every year for Christmas but
after the chocolate is set I melt red
& green candy melt (in separate bowls)
& then drizzle each color in different
directions across the top of the cookie.
I get many requests for this cookie. 
My kids love it. They have helped dip 
the crackers but it gets alittle messy.
I found that putting them on a cookie
sheet lined with wax paper & then 
putting the cookie sheet in the 
freezer really makes things go much 
quicker.

Could NOT be easier! Kids can make this in a snap. Heck, monkeys could make this! I bought the Andes baking chips from my grocery store, melted a couple handfuls in the microwave in a creme brulee cup for about 30 seconds, then mixed it with a fork to be sure it was all melted through. I just dropped my reduced-fat Ritz crackers into the creme brulee cup with melted chocolate (perfect size cup for a Ritz) and used two forks to turn and coat the cracker. Set on paper plates (out of wax paper) and put the plates in the freezer for about two minutes. THAT'S IT FOLKS!! Clean up is a snap! My husband was AMAZED at these. He kept saying "How did you do that?" and looking around the kitchen like there must have been more pans or ingredients; like it was magic. :) In all fairness, there is a teeny tiny, very faint salt taste from the crackers if you really examine them -- but not enough to detract from the taste in any way. I will keep my eyes peeled for plain chocolate wafer cookies. Or, if you really wanted to go for broke, you could buy a bag of oreos and twist apart each cookie to use the two chocolate wafers; you'd have yourself a true thin mint then. This would work well to make mint chocolate dipped oreos, or to dip the ends of a biscotti ... the possibilities are endless. People look so stunned and confused when after biting into the cookie I hearing me say, "It's a Ritz cracker!" Really a fun recipe. :)

These are awesome!  I didn't use bittersweet chocolate however.  I always buy little chocolate "buttons" at our local candy supply store so had some semi-sweet/dark chocolate left over from Christmas.  Kept adding the peppermint extract until it tasted right.  People at work freaked out - thought I'd somehow gotten my cookie order early!!!!  I might add that you should not use plain MINT extract.  Every time I've used that in ANY candy, it tastes like toothpaste, so be sure and use peppermint!  Also, the cold cookie sheet is a must.  I've been making candy for years and always had the little "pool" around the chocolate dipped items.  This certainly takes care of that problem - looked professional.  Also, I used a little Wilton candy dipping tool - plastic with the end looking like a tiny "waffle spatula".  Dropped the Ritz in the chocolate, picked it up with the dipping tool and FLIPPED it over onto the cold cookie sheet - perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I'll be making it again - so much cheaper than the girl scout cookies and frankly, I think a little better.  Might try it again with the chocolate wafer cookies someone had mentioned but I still don't see how it could be better than the Ritz.

So good - but I have a couple of suggestions.  Taste your chocolate after adding your peppermint.  I didn't taste my chocolate until I was working on my second cookie sheet, and I didn't have enough peppermint flavor, added more and the second sheet tastes just like Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies.  First sheet is good, but much better with more peppermint flavor.  After dipping crackers, pick cracker up with a fork, tap handle of fork on edge of bowl/double boiler to remove some excess chocolate.  Put waxed paper covered cookie sheets in freezer before starting, helps cool these quickly.  I am sure I'll have to make more of these in the next 2 days, can't keep hubby out of them.  Thanks for recipe, delish!!

Like a previous reviewer I used Andes mints (thank goodness for after Christmas sales). These are like the real deal!!! By the way, I didn't bother with the double boiler, I just melted the Andes in the microwave :) Thanks for the post.

EXCELLENT!!! This was soooo easy to make. I melted a little Gulf Wax with a bag of Andes Mint baking pieces,Used a fork to flip the Ritz crackers in the melted mixture then from the pan to 2 wax paper lined cookie sheets. Five minutes in the fridge and you HAVE real Thin Mints just like Girl Scouts. I only got 58 cookies out of this recipe(not 80 like stated) but I can't complain...These are Wonderful and HIGHLY recommended. GREAT RECIPE! :D

This is such a good cookie!  Very intersting how a cracker can turn into something so delicious.  Also used 2 bags of Andes mints.  Kept the chocolate melted in my chocolate dipping pot.  Used tongs to flip the crackers.  My 5 year old daughter made almost the whole batch after showing her how to do it so really not complicated.

...I seriously don't even know where to begin. These...are...sooooo...freakin' AWESOME!!! I'm shocked to discover that I actually prefer these to GS Thin Mints. I used regular Ritz crackers. I like the very, very slight salt taste combined with the mint chocolate. I could, quite literally, eat these until I'm sick! I used the 10 oz. bag of Andes Creme de Mint Baking Chips (Walmart $2.50), melted in a bowl over a pot of simmering water. As my mint chocolate was melting, I lined a cookie sheet with wax paper and put it in the freezer. I used the suggestion of breaking the two inside prongs of a plastic fork. This worked fabulously for turning the crackers in the chocolate and lifting these delicious "cookies" onto the baking sheet. I made 52 cookies from the one bag of Andes. I should've made a double batch! There's always a next time though :) As another reviewer stated, these are so much cheaper than buying Thin Mints. The last time I bought a box was a few years ago and they were $10. Others have stated this is a messy recipe but I didn't have that problem at all. Even if I did, I would still make these. They're THAT good! You have my  lifelong gratitude for this brilliant recipe Kim!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

These are great!  For those of you out there, like me, who only have mint extract (not peppermint extract) on hand, simply use half mint half vanilla extract.  It tastes great.  Also, if you'd like to make this recipe a world easier to make do the following.  Melt your chocolate and add the extracts.  Crush all your Ritz crackers into the melted chocolate and mix well.  Then, you can either drop them on the wax paper like drop cookies and pop them in the freezer for 5 minutes, and your done.  OR Put one layer of wax paper on a cookie sheet and dump the cracker/chocolate mixture onto the sheet.  Put another layer of wax paper on top and smooth it out.  Pop in the freezer for 5 minutes.  Pull out and use cookie cutters to cut out shapes.  This is much simpler, tastes the same and cuts down on clean up tremendously!

The only thing better than a delicious recipe is an easy one, and this is the best of both worlds!  I melted my chocolate in the microwave so I didn't have to fuss with a double boiler.  I also used vanilla wafers instead of crackers.  The easiest way for me to dip them was to drop a wafer into the chocolate, coat it, then fish it out with a fork and gently shake the extra chocolate off before slipping it onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  I popped the sheet of cookies into the freezer for approximately 3 minutes and they were completely set.  I got so many compliments on these treats that I was embarrassed to reveal how easy they were to make!

These were good, but I made some changes.  After reading a ton of reviews on all different sites, I decided to experiment using ritz crackers, Vanilla wafers and Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers.  I melted andes mints instead of melting chocolate and then adding peppermint extract.  The andes mints were perfect.  I melted them slowly in the microwave, stirring frequently.  Our family conducted a taste test on the 3 different varieties, and the chocolate wafers were by far the best! Plus, they are almost black inside, just like a girl scout thin mint.  It was odd biting into the rits and Nilla wafer and seeing a white color.  I had never heard of these wafers but read about them in another review.  I found them at Wal Mart in a long skinny yellow box with clear cellophane on top so you can see the cookies.  There is only a single row of them with about 45-50 in the box.  Make sure they are not broken.

They really do taste just like Girl Scout cookies.  My daughter thought they were.  She asked me where I got Girl Scout this time of the year (and with sprinkles, too!)  Thank you.

Definitely a keeper, this recipe is destined to become a holday 'must'. I took the advice of other cooks and used the Nabisco chocolate wafers and melted Andes chips in a double boiler. Simple, easy, and fun! And the best part? They DO taste just like Girl Scout cookies! I had leftover chocolate after the wafers were done so I used Ritz crackers. They were good, but just didn't compare to the wafers. I would highly recommend this (revised) recipe to anyone. Thank you, Kim!

Awesome! I used semisweet chocolate, as that's all I had on hand. I tinted some white chocolate a pale (mint) green color and drizzled that on top for a pretty presentation. Thanks! :)

These crackers are SUPERB!!  I took the advice of others and just used the Andes Creme de Menthe chips.  I melted one, 10 oz. bag and it made 70 crackers.  I found snowflake shaped Ritz crackers and used them.  I drizzled the tops with some melted white chocolate chips and sprinkled crushed candy canes on that.  I just laid a piece of waxed paper on the counter top and placed the chocolate dipped crackers on that to set up.  It worked perfectly and they came right off of the paper.  THANKS for a great, EASY recipe!!

I froze a sheet tray and then placed the dipped crackers back in the freezer.  When they were hardened, they would not come off the sheet pan except in tiny little shreds of chocolate covered crackers.  The bittersweet chocolate was off-putting to me.  Needless to say, I won't be making these again.

Very Good!!!! And fun to make. NEXT TIME, I will put a half a bar of candy wax to the pound of chocolate so that they don't melt in your hand when you go to eat them.  And I suggest for everyone else to do the same. :)

Oh my goodness, these are so good! I read the recipe wrong and bought dark chocolate (mini bars because I couldn't find chips). I think the dark chocolate & mint made a perfect combination. Ran out of dark and used semisweet - still good. Can't go wrong with this one. Used other suggestions and used Toll House crackers instead of Ritz. YUM! Thanks for the sweet addiction in my life.

I enjoyed these. I was craving the mint and chocolate combo so this was quick fix. I just bit into them and let the chocolate, cracker and mint taste melt away in my mouth. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and peppermint oil because that is what I had on hand and also added a bit of butter to the melting chocolate and it got this lovely glossy look to it. Since I used peppermint oil I slowly added it in drop by drop so it would not be overpowering. Now to dip these, this may sound funny - I took a plastic fork and broke off the middle two "sprongs" and it was a perfect handler for holding the cracker and turning it in the chocolate, lifting it out and putting it on the sheet. Quick and easy and the mint taste just lingers in your mouth afterward. I like it, thanks!

OMG These are soooooo simple and good. My husband, who doesn't like anything new thought that they were great. I used a 10oz bag of Andy's Mints and got 54 cookies.

I thought these were great! I used regular Ritz, and I thought maybe next time I would use low sodium ritz because you could taste that salt, but it actually tasted terrific, sweet and salty, even if it wasn't exactly like a thin mint

I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I used semi sweet morsels. It was a little thicker than I wanted but, wow, the taste is there. These are sooooo good! I'm gonna do these again and again! Thanks for the post!!

I've made these a few times. The first batch I used Andes Mint Baking Chips and melted them slowly in the micro and I topped with crushed candy canes. The second batch I made with Nestles Limited Mint Choco & Dark Chips and did the micro melt again. These took a little longer to melt and the mixture was a little thicker on the ritz, but they def taste more like the GS cookie! Both ways are fantastic! But I think now I'm partial to the mint choco! Thanks for such an easy recipe! Everyone loved them!!

I thought I had reviewed this when I first made this two years ago. Huh. I make two different kinds of this Girl Scout cookie fake-out. I do one batch with the Ritz crackers and one batch with chocolate cookie wafers. Both are hot ticket items on my cookie platter. I would suggest that you don't use a cheap cracker, you'll pay for it later. And splurge if you can for a good chocolate and peppermint extract. Watkins is pretty good. NOTE: You can find chocolate wafer cookies on your grocery store's cookie isle, usually on the top shelf. Want to make this easy to get in and out of the chocolate? Use a fork with thin tines that will help a little of the chocolate drip off before setting to cool on parchment paper.

YUMMY!!! These are just like Girl Scout cookies! I made mine with Andes mint chips, I took a 1/2 cup and microwaved it until melted. Then I dipped the Ritz
Crackers. A half a cup makes 20 cookies!I Put them on wax paper on a cookie sheet. And then you can put them in the frezzer for 2 min. But you can also prepare them ahead of time and it won't hurt them!! Yummmy!

We all loved these. When i went to the baking section to buy the bitter sweet chocolate I discovered a package of Andes baking chips. I melted these slowly in the microwave and dipped the crackers in that. Talk about easy.

Though one of my pet peeves is reviewers who change a recipe completely then post about it, I had to tell what I did with this recipe idea. I tried it using the chocolate "Famous Wafers" to dip because I had a box in the cupboard I needed to get rid of. They were awesome and exactly like the GS cookies. I'll be interested to try it with crackers to see the difference. I've made a delicious candy using two Wheat Thin crackers with peanut butter in the middle dipped in chocolate, so I KNOW crackers work well for these kind of treats.

I'm giving this 5 stars for ingenuity, texure & flavor! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I used the suggestion of some others & simply melted Andes mints then spread it onto Ritz crackers & sprinkled crushed peppermint candy on top. I'm sure they would be even better with the thin chocolate wafer cookies but where in the world does one find them anymore? The seecondbatch I coursely choppd some York Peppermint Patty bits & sprinkled these ontop of te chocolaate - took it over the top in wonderful chocolately minty flavor! The crackers are an excellent alternative!

yum yum yum. my husband loves the girl scout thin mints so i had him try these with his eyes closed and i didnt tell him what they were. I wanted to see what he would say when he tasted them. And he thought they were the real thin mints, he loved them and so did my kids. Super easy.

Wow these are labor intensive! But they were very well received so I suppose if they'requested next year, I'll make them again!  I may have put the coating on too thick, because 1 lb of chocolate only covered about 65 crackers.

Perfection! I think they're better than the Girl Scouts' Thin Mints. I did, however, make one modification that made it SO much easier and just as tasty...tasty perfection: I used Toll House dark chocolate and mint chips. I melted two bags over a double boiler, dipped the Ritz, one at a time using tongs. I was able to make just over 60 from those two bags. Excellent!

Made these using previous reviewers suggestions - Vanilla wafer cookies dipped in melted andes baking chips.  Turned out sooooo good!  Also dipped a few ritz crackers and did a taste test with the kids and hubby.  Consensus is that while both taste good, the one made with a vanilla wafer holds up better, i.e. doesn't crumble as easily.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe.

These have been added to my Christmas cookie list!!! So delicious and unbelievably SIMPLE!!! I sprinkled them with colored sprinkles for a festive touch. Definitely follow the advice regarding melting the chocolate completely before adding the peppermint extract. I did and it turned out perfect. One more note...PEPPERMINT EXTRACT IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE!!!! A tiny bit dribbled over my pan and caught on fire. The flames licked right up over the edge into the pan! The flames blew out easily and had no effect on the flavor, but please be careful!

I was making peanut butter pretzel truffles this morning and I had some left over dipping chocolate and tons of Ritz crackers. The only thing I did different was I used Nestle mint & semi sweet chips mixed together. I just tasted one, and I cant believe how good they are. Great way to use up left over melted chocolate!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  These are SO GOOD!!!  I made them with the Andes Creme De Mint Baking Chips and they melted within two minutes in a double boiler!  I used both the Ritz Crackers and the Famous Chocolate Wafers and we like them both equally!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!!

Made these a while back, but never got around to reviewing ('til now!) Here's my one tip for these: Stick a needle or a toothpick (if it fits w/o breaking) through one of the holes in the Ritz cracker, then dip into the chocolate. It is easier and less messy!

Wow! These are awesome! I thought this sounded like a really strange combination of ingredients, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try anyway. Very glad I did!  I will definately be making them whenever I get an off-season craving for girl scout cookies.

EXCELLENT!!! These have become a must-have in my home. The only minor adjustment I made was to use semisweet chocolate (either bars or chips) to make it more sweet. I have always loved the famous Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies, but hated having to pay so much for them! This tastes EXACTLY like those. It takes a minute to heat the chocolate, a minute to cover the crackers, and a minute to cool. So easy for such a great recipe. THANK YOU!!!

I loved this recipe and so did everyone at the cookout I brought it to. I used one pound of almond bark dipping chocolate instead of chocolate chips. I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and I used tongs to dip crackers and then cooled them on the waxed paper. EXCELLENT! Everyone said they tasted like girl scout cookies and begged for the recipe.

This is a wonderful and very addicting cookie.  It doesn't get much easier.  I use Andes mints instead of the chocolate and flavoring.  Some stores sell a bag of broken pieces in the baking section.  If I can't find them, I just unwrap a box of the mints.  People just can't belive that they are chocolate covered crackers.

This was great! Such a nice treat to enjoy while relaxing. I did the double boiler method and still burned the chocolate, so I had to slowly heat it up in the microwave. The semi-sweet chocolate is a little bitter (for those that love regular chocolate as opposed to dark chocolate), so for those that like milk chocolate, go with milk chocolate instead.

Not bad! While not as good as Girl Scout cookies, these are a decent (and cheap!) knockoff for sure! If only I could get my cookies to look as pretty as the boxed ones (and if I could find those darn chocolate wafers everyone is talking about), I'd be able to fool a LOT of people lol! NOTE: You MUST let these sit overnight to taste anything like the "real" deal, IMHO. I ate several of these right after setting up in the freezer and wasn't impressed at all. This is definitely something you want to prepare in advance. All in all, these were super yummy and the perfect snack to serve with my St. Paddy's Day corned beef sandwiches (the green sugar crystals I decorated mine with were a nice touch). If I were to give these  as gifts or display on a holiday cookie tray, my technique is in need of some SERIOUS improvement, but other than this minor mishap, I have no complaints. Thanks for sharing, Kim! :-)

This has quickly become our new favorite holiday goodie.  Has gotten rave reviews from recipients, as well!  We sprinkled the tops of our with crushed Andes mints and/or green mint chips.

I seen this on the reviews today saying that tasted just like a Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookie, so I had to try it out of curiosity. I used the calculate button to change it to 5 servings or 10 crackers just to test it. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and just put it in the microwave for about 1 minute stirring every 30 seconds. 1 oz is about 3 Tblsp. of chocolate. I thought the chocolate coating was very similar to the coating on thin mints. I plan to save it to dip shortbread or another favorite cookie in for Christmas. However, the center didn't taste like a cracker, but not really a thin mint cookie either. They are good though. Just make sure to put them on something like parchment. The ones I made stuck to the glass plate I put them on.

These work great with any store brand, low sodium or sodium free butter cracker.  Once you dip them in chocolate, give them 24 hours to set up.  Not in the fridge, place the tray on the kitchen table or counter and let them set up.  I've found that during the summer, it takes longer for the chocolate to set up.   During the winter, it takes only an hour. And that's without refrigeration.  Forgot to say, they are great.  Taste awesome....

These do taste just like Thin Mints! I make them with a few easy changes. I use dark chocolate mint melting chips from the craft store. I melt them in the microwave and then dip Maria cookies. I sprinkle chopped Andes candies on top. Delicious!

Wow!!  I used Chocolate Wafer Cookies and dipped them in melted Bittersweet Chocolate and I added  one teaspoon of peppermint extract.  I used the cold cookie sheet lined with waxed paper.  Refrigerate! These are delicious and  better than GS Thin Mint Cookies.

Used the Nabisco cookies and thin mints - and was FABULOUS!!  Drizzle with a glaze made of 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 drops of mint extract, 3 1/2 tsp water and a little green food coloring.

These really did taste just like girl scout cookies!!  I took other reveiwers' suggestions and used Nilla wafers (looks nicer and doesn't have any salt).  I couldn't find the Andes baking chips other people were talking about so I actually just used the Andes candy and melted those.  Everything came out perfectly and it ended up being much easier than the original recipe.

These are great!  I used chocolate-flavored almond bark instead of expensive chocolate. It is so much easier to work with--no double boiler required, won't seize up...  Unless you're a super-taster, you won't care and it is a lot cheaper, too.

My husband and I enjoyed these immensely -- and experimented a bit too. We liked the taste of Keebler Club Crackers (multi-grain is what I had in the pantry) as well as the Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafer for the "cookie" base. The buttery flavor of the Club cracker with the mint was surprisingly good, and the texture great! For the chocolate, we tried melted Andes baking chips first as well as melted chocolate CHUNKS w/ extract. Both had good mint taste, but we felt the Andes tasted more like an original Thin Mint and were easier to work with. Excellent!

These are a pretty accurate replica of the Girl Scouts cookies, but I'm not sure it's worth all the time and mess. I had the same problem as a few others; I microwaved the chocolate to a perfect dipping consistency but as soon as the extract went in, it started to seize and get lumpy. Since it was so thick I had to dip the crackers and then scrape the extra chocolate off so that there was a nice thin, uniform chocolate coating. They set up really nicely in the freezer but then after I took them out the chocolate started to melt again. Huge mess and a hassle! They were a huge messy hassle and they LOOKED that way too. 3 stars for taste, but that's all...Maybe I'll try the Andes mints like others suggested, but this recipe just did not work for me!

I used Famous chocolate wafers and Andes chocolate mints.  The mints melted so easily over a double boiler to make a smooth chocolate sauce.  I used two forks to dip each chocolate wafer which made it easier for the chocolate to drain off.  They came out perfectly!  Yum!

You cannot go wrong with these.  Very easy and inexpensive.  If you choose to microwave the chocolate, cook for 30 second intervals.  Stir after each 30 seconds.  Add the pepppermint extract after the chocolate is melted.  YUM

Incredibly easy and tasty...I used melted Andes candies baking chips and no peppermint extract and they were phenomenal.  My husband thought it really was a Girl Scout Cookie.  The only negative was that by the next day you could taste the salt of the cracker.  But otherwise, super easy and just as good as a Thin Mint.

While this recipe was delicious it was extremely messy and still difficult to handle even when using a fork. This will probably be a one-two time a year recipe. I used milk chocolate chips and top off with sugar crystal sprinkles.

How crazy is this recipe?!? I can't believe I can make Thin Mints! With Ritz! LOL! 
I did as others suggested, using Andes creme de menthe baking chips. But, I do like my chocolate a little darker so I added 1/2 cup semi-sweet mini chips as well.  I also made mine in small batches by melting about a half cup of chocolate in a custard cup in the microwave for 30 seconds. Because the small amount of melted chocolate stayed warm as I dipped my crackers, each cookie came out looking like a perfectly smooth thin mint. Thank you for this recipe!

Oh yum!!!!  These are delicious!!!  I could eat the whole batch!  :)   Definitely a keeper.  I used 1 lb of the Ghirandelli Chocolate (Candy Making & Dipping Bar) with the peppermint extract and did it in the double boiler.  I lined the cookie sheets with wax paper.  I didn't even have to refrig, they set right away.  Perfect!!!  I have a feeling I'm going to be making these a lot.  No mess whatsoever.  I think someone else mentioned that.  I was even able to make them all up while cradling a phone on my shoulder and chatting.  Oh, was a little worried these might take awhile to make, as I'm really busy today, but the whole process went really fast.  Excellent recipe.  Give it a try!

These were terrific.  My only problem was that once they cooled off on the cookie sheet in the fridge I couldn't get them off of the cookie sheet in one piece. The next batch I made I used waxed paper that I had sprayed very lightly with Pam and they came off perfectly.

I used the Andes pieces as suggested by others.  My son is a "Thin Mint" lover. I made these and asked him to try one without telling him what it was.  "Wow!" he said "these taste like Thin Mints - how did you do that?"  He took over making them.  He uses:
Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers and the Andes Creme de Menthe baking chips.
Thanks for sharing!!!

This is not my usual "style" of cooking (I prefer more involved recipes, with more natural ingredients), but they were surprisingly good -- they definitely are very, very similar to Girl Scout cookies! I used chocolate graham crackers instead of a Ritz crackers and used the Andes mint chips like other raters suggested. They are square, of course, but I thought it sounded strange to use a salty cracker. I took them to a retreat for church and everyone raved about them. They couldn't believe they were "homemade." I have never had so many women ask for a recipe from me!

I only use recipes with great ratings on this website and have they have never failed until today.  These were really gross. I followed the recipe to a "t"... Luckily I only made 1/2 a batch, I didn't feel so bad not eating them. Not at all like girlscouts- will not try again!!!

ok.... i feel kinda of special after reading about how easy these were to make, saying that ive had trouble.. :)BUT i had trouble.. i dont know if maybe i overcooked the chocolate, but the chocolate was fine, smooth and a nice manageable consistency until i added the mint, then it went to this thick mass of chocolate that wouldnt stick to the crackers (it did taste good though :D) thanks UPDATE: You have to use an oil based mint  flavor.. So mint oil instead of just plain extract.. (extract will kill your chocolate) Once i figured this out the cookies ROCK! My family asks me to make them constantly. Thanks for the recipe!

What a cool recipe.  The reviews are true - they really taste just like the Girl Scout variety.  I froze mine initially and put into a cookie container the following day.  They seemed to hold their shape better that way; otherwise they become very melty in your hands very quickly.  I used the 2-fork method as other cooks did.

WOW!  I was very cautious about getting my hope up for "GIRL SCOUT-LIKE" Thin Mints, but it's true -- these are just as good! And, they're made out of crackers.  Based on other reviews, I made a few changes: I used a pound of milk chocolate almond bark. Heated it in the micro and was ready to go in about 1 min.  Very easy.  I tossed the cracker in the chocolate, flipped with a fork, and then lifted out with a fork, and slid it onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  The chocolate is thick enough so the fork doesn't leave any marks.  Once the cookie sheet was full, I put it in the freezer to set.  Only took a few minutes until they were ready to be stored.  The bottoms came out perfect.  Also, there was only enough chocolate for 64 crackers.

just made these for the first time.  Oh my gosh are they wonderful.   A must have for the cookie recipe box.  I used 12 oz of semi sweet choco chips, and 4 oz of the special dark choco chips.  I was only able to get about 55 cookies from that amount of chocolate mixture.

Something this easy should have just a so-so taste but these cookies are fabulous!  My daughter requests them for her cookie exchange every year.  I use white almond bark and 2 cups of chocolate chips (semi-sweet) for the chocolate with very good results.  For the holidays, the kids can cover these with red or green sprinkles to make them more festive. A must have at Christmas!

This was pretty good but I think it would be better with a semi-sweet chocolate as the bittersweet was pretty dark tasting.  Still people seemed to like them and they were easy to make

I loved these! I followed the reviews of others who suggested using Andes Mints. They worked perfectly. When microwaving, just check every 30 seconds or so and stir until completely melted. After dipping, I topped them with Christmas holiday colored sprinkles. You could do sprinkles for the various holidays, but I think these will hold up better in the cooler weather. Great recipe! Thanks Kim!

I love reading reviews on AllRecipes, because they provide so many helpful tips!  I made these by melting Andes Mints in the double boiler. I dipped some Ritz Crackers and some Nabisco Famous Wafers.  The Ritz were more popular in my house.   

Don't fret if you can't find Famous Wafers!  I drove to five different stores to find them.  When I finally did they were a bit pricey and the package was over half broken.  The cookies that did survive intact were so thin they broke in the dipping process.  Next time, even though it is more time consuming, I am going to split Oreos and remove the creme from the chocolate wafers.  They will hold up better and match the Girl Scout cookies in size.  (Hey, a whole Oreo would be pretty good too, come to think of it.)

Even though my cookies were broken, they still tasted great!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Add some vegetable shortening to chocolate and don't add mint until it's already melted.  Freeze the pan before making them.  Start with a small amount of mint...you can always add more and it's potent.

These were so gross because of the bittersweet chocolate (which was EXPENSIVE)! I've had these before and they were so good, but they must have used regular milk chocolate. I want to try again with "good tasting" chocolate. Mad I wasted money on the bittersweet! :(

Awesome recipe.  Totally easy and quick to make and taste great.  I followed the recipe exactly except I think I added more peppermint extract than called for.  And I melted the chips in the microwave instead of over hot water.  Will make these again and again.

yum!  Just like thin  mints except for a little too much salt, maybe.  I just used melted andes and ritz. Also tried nilla wafers, but we liked ritz the best for the texture like a girl scout cookie.

SO JUST LIKE GIRLSCOUT cookies!!  My family adores them, including my little girl who hates mint.  She eats more than the rest of us.  HUGE HIT!!!  I was thinking of maybe twisting it up and changing the mint to orange and raspberry.  YUMMY!

UPDATE 12/16: The stores were sold out of Andes baking chips and I opted for Hershey's Mint chocolate chips. I quickly found out that the melted chocolate chips did not have the same consistency as the Andes - too thick and did not set as easily. Ultimately I ended up adding Gulf Wax to the melted chocolate and things went better. They tasted pretty good, but not like the Andes. Next year, I'll be sure to stock up on the Andes baking chips!

Following the advice of others, I used the Andes chips instead of the chocolate and peppermint extract. It is amazing how much they taste like Thin Mints! They were a huge hit and SO simple! These will become a definite go-to recipe for gatherings!

I'm not a great cook, and I have NEVER been the one to bring a dish that everyone raved about... until now! I couldn't believe how much everyone loved these cookies, and they were so easy to make! Someone actually called them "Minty Heaven"! I saw the recipe one day and I happened to have recently purchased a bag of mint-chocolate Hershey's Kisses, so I unwrapped and melted those instead of using the peppermint extract. Make sure to freeze the cookie sheet or else the chocolate will run. They were amazing!

I accidentally bought whole grain crackers.  I thought they were going to be gross.  They were great!  I can't belive they turned out so well. I wish there was an easy way to make the chocolate coating thinner.

Wow, they do taste like Thin Mints, my favorite GS cookie. Now I can enjoy them all year!  Definitely grease your cookie sheet. I did just as the instructions said and my cookies were GLUED on it. I had to drop it on the ground to get the cookies off (and only a few broke thankfully). Also, I don't bother with a double boiler to melt the chocolate, I just microwaved for a minute or 2 on 50% power, stopping every 30-45 seconds to stir stir stir. This was a great recipe to make with my 10 year old niece, easy enough for her to do, and she loved decorating them with sugars and sprinkles.

I'm chowing down on some my coworker brought it and they are amazing. She uses the confectioner coating instead of chocolate to get a nice hard coating without tempering the chocolate: I plan to do either-or, depending on what's on sale. I can't detect any saltiness from the Ritz. These really do taste like (not exactly like, but quite close) a Thin Mint and they really are so simple: Thanks for sharing :)

I am amazed at how easy and delicious!  I used Andes Thin Mints baking chips and mixed them with some milk chocolate chips to melt.  Delicious! I also tried a layer of peanut butter on the cracker then milk chocolate. ALso delicious. I think the slight salt taste compliments well.  Topped the minkt with a bit of crushed candy cane and peanut butter with a few peanut butter chips. Looked and tasted great. THese are a new easy favorite! I'm going to put them in my christmas goodie bags :)

I made these with light cocoa candy melts (melted in microwave) and Ritz Hint of Salt crackers and they were great.  I've used both peppermint and just "mint" extract (I didn't realize there was more than one type until I got the second bottle home).  Both were good, but not sure which is closer to actual Thin Mints.

I think Girl Scouts have changed their think mint recipe and these DELICIOS crackers taste just like thin mints USED to.  these are wonderful. I didn't have extract so I used andes peppermint chips that I bought on close out somewhere after I had melted bittersweet chocolate in double broiler.  I used both crackers and nilla wafers.  I personally much preferred the ritz.

These are not just like the Girl Scout cookies as Kim suggests. These are FAR better!! They have a crisp to them that you can't get in the GirlScout kind. I make these every year with my grandkids. Excellent recipe. I also do not add the peppermint extract until after the chocolate has melted. Otherwise these are hard to mess up.

These are just like the Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies! My 3 y.o. daughter helped me make these.  We used Ande's Chocolate Mint Candies - which she unwrapped and placed into the bowl.  I melted the candy in the microwave - she dropped the crackers into the melted chocolate - I coated them and placed them on wax paper - she sprinkled the decorations on the cookies.  Daddy helped eat them all up!   Great project for little ones to help with!

This is sooo yummy!!  I used the Andes baking chips and the snowflake Ritz crackers.  They are not salty as I expected.  My husband loves them!  I brought some to work today and they were a HIT!!  I used a toothpick in the center to dip them and they dropped right off onto the cookie sheet!  The cookie sheet with wax paper in the freezer beforeheand helped tremendously.  Didn't have to put them in the freezer to set.  By the time I finished one cookie sheet, they were setting great!  Will definitely make this over and over again!

Gee...this tasted like a mint-chocolate covered cracker to me.  Maybe with a chocolate cookie base it would be like a thin mint, but not as-is, in my opinion.  But maybe I'm just picky.

These cookies are awesome!!  And they taste just like the girl scout cookies.  I took the easy route though.  I bought Andes baking chips and since i didnt hava double boiler I just melted the chocolate on low in a saucepan and dipped the low sodium ritz in the chocolate with tongs.  awesome and so easy!! My boyfriend and I even ate them for breakfast today :)

I made these for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit! Instead of using the bittersweet chocolate I used the Andes Mint Baking chips. I dipped them in the chocolate and then laid them out on a waxed lined cookie sheet and stuck them in the freezer for about 10 mins.

I took the simplier route...I bought the Andi's Candies (3 boxes) and melted them in the microwave.  I also bought the new Ritz Cracker/Pretzel combo to dip in the chocolate.  These were a HUGE hit at a graduation party I made them for...there was so much food there I didn't expect this simple receipe to be the one everyone kept commenting on.  Everyone thought they tasted like the Girl Scout cookies!  Now I've been told they have to be put on my Christmas cookie list. Great Recipe!! Thanks!

Delicious.  I surprised my sister with these since she loves Thin Mint cookies - and she loved these too.  I used the Baker's Dipping Chocolate in the microwavable container, added the mint extract after it was melted. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are pretty good, but definitely don't taste just like thin mints. Don't use dark chocolate chips with these unless you love dark chocolate. Use the Andes mint chips if you can find them. I tried them both ways...and the mint extract was just too strong.

Well they are refreshingly minty and good but hubby says they are not as good as the thin mints. An easy snack for kids to make. I used the microwave to melt the chocolate. I used the townhouse crackers since that is what I had in my cupboard. Oh and I stored them in a tightly covered container in the fridge since for some reason the chocolate wanted to soften at room temp.

I used semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkled with crushed candy canes for cookie exchange.  I used a small slotted spoon to shake of excess chocolate and that seemed to work the best.  Very tasty!

This recipe was a total hit with the family during the holidays. Everybody decorated their own -- and, per other reviews, these cookies are ringers for the famous Girl Scout thin mint cookies. We got so into it that we melted down our Christmas chocolate candy and kept on dippin'!

If your chocolate is too thick, add a small amount of vegetable oil or Crisco.  And don't even try to make these if you don't have wax paper... I did and it was a mess.  A delicious mess, but a mess nonetheless.

Wow!  I made these with my residents (I'm an Activity Director for Assisted Living) and I had to make two batches!  No one could believe that you made these with crackers and how incredibly easy they were!  Those "other" thin mint cookies are a great fund raiser, but these are way better and cheaper!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are fantastic for what they are!  I was really worried about them being too salty so I brushed them off a bit before dipping.  The mini Safeway next to my place had no bittersweet chocolate so I used semisweet chips.  The BF said he was very impressed!  They didnt take that long either, eeze a pan while you microwave the chocolate for three minutes stirring half way through and youre good to go!

These are so good!  I only made a few to test it out (using low sodium ritz and melted Andes baking pieces), and I will definitely be making more.  We gobbled them up in a matter of minutes.

Our family loved these super easy cookies! I found a similar recipe that called for 1 1/2 pounds chocolate (almondbark melted in the microwave per package directions)and 1/4 tsp peppermint oil and 72 ritz crackers. The results were messy but delicious. Next time I will try our fondue pot to keep chocolate from getting hard.

These were easy to make and taste great.  I didn't have the right chocolate on hand, but really want them for my son's birthday party tomorrow.  I used a milk chocolate candy kit I had on hand, and they still came out great. The kit had white chocolate in it too, so I melted some and drizzled it over the top of half of them for a decorative touch.  Then I added peppermint to the leftover white chocolate and dipped some more crackers.  (I love white peppermint chocolate this time of year :) ) I cannot wait to hear what my guests have to say when they taste these!

I am rating this 5 stars due to the change from Ritz crackers to chocolate graham crackers.  Of course they didn't look as pretty as the round Ritz, but the crunch and taste really was like the Girl Scout cookies.  I just wish there was round chocolate wafers that I could use.  I couldn't find any in the cookie isle.  I made these as an extra cookie for Thanksgiving and they were a hit.

I made these, thinking my family would enjoy them. Little did I realize my husband had a potluck lunch at work the next day! Oh, well... He said they disappeared in less than an hour. I used a bag of dark chocolate melts (12 ounces), a couple teaspoons of peppermint extract (I think it was getting old, it seemed weak to me!), and only 40 crackers. The chocolate was a little thick, and the extract DID make it harden a bit, so I added some Crisco shortening which helped thin it out too! He said they were super-minty the next day - my bad! - but that they were awesome. Next time, I will add some shortening to the chocolate from the start to help thin it out, and I'll use the suggested amount of extract. :) Or some peppermint chips as I forgot I had some! Thanks for sharing, Kim!

These cookies are to die for!!!  I love them and they taste just like Girl Scout Thin Mints and they are sooooooo easy.  It doesn't get better than this.  I also let my 2 year old put sprinkles on top.  He loved it and we gave them out as gifts on Christmas.

Gosh, I hate to give a bad review, but I am so disappointed in this recipe. I did everything exact and I too encountered my chocolate curdling once I put in the peppermint extract. I added some shortning to help thin it back out, but it never got rid of the mini lumps completely. Trying to dip, keep your chocolate warm enough, tap the chocolate off, stir til smooth ~pulling hair out~ I just gave up. I MAY try this again using peppermint oil as one other reviewer suggested, but for now, I am grumbling about just wasting a batch of good chocolate and how to fancy the ones I already did so that they don't appear like lumpy chocolate things. I suppose I'll melt some white chocolate and ribbon it on the cookies.(sigh)

These cookies were very popular with the little ones.  I liked a thick coating of chocolate, but if you want to get 80 cookies like the recipe says (I got a little over 50 or so) you will need to scrape off the excess chocolate on the side of the bowl.  

I used peppermint extract and it worked perfectly.  

You can crush up candy cane (particularly pretty with the red and green ones) and sprinkle it on top for a festive look.  Or after they cool they can be drizzled with white chocolate and they sprinkled with red or green baking sugar.  YUM!

I give this 5 stars for taste and 2 or 3 for mess. So an average of 4. They are very easy and taste great but the chocolate is soft and messy. I added shortening to help it set up but no luck. I will make again but I will have to buy paraffin to add to it.  No way could I wrap and give these as gifts. I guess I will have to eat all myself. Poor me.

This is a great recipe.. I make it each year...However.. I reccomend using peppermint oil instead of extract.
Extracts contain water that can ruin chocolate. The oil can be bought at cooking stores and some specialty food stores. It can be a little pricey but the result will be a much better chocolate

The choc. goes a lot further if when you dip the cracker you pinch it with tongs in one hand and use other hand to scrape off excess choc. with a chopstick. I kept the choc. hot over a double broiler the entire time I was dipping which also gave a thinner coat on each cracker.

Wow!  Such a no brainer- I can't believe I haven't thought of this before.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and didn't measure a thing.  Just poured some in a bowl and microwaved until melted.  Then I added peppermint extract to my liking.  I dipped chocolate grahm crackers because I couldn't find chocolate wafers, put them on a paper plate as another reviewer suggested, and stuck them in the freezer for 10 minutes.  My husband said If they didn't look weird he would've never known the difference between this and the real thin mint cookies.  I noticed... but only slightly.  They certainly do the trick when the real ones aren't around.  I'll still support my local girl scouts but this recipe is darn good and easy- thanks!!!

Definitely go with the low sodium Ritz.  I wouldn't say these are just like thin mints because the texture of the chocolate is different and mine always come out sweeter than the girl scout variety.  With that said, these are still very good and very easy to make.

I used Oreo 100 cal packs (I had a bunch on hand) so much for low in cal but mmm mmm good. And they were so cute mini. I put a little choc in the middle of 2 and then dipped them to make it a sandwich. They were a hit!

I made these this morning. I used the Andes mint chips, and a small package of Pepperidge Farms Chessmen. They tasted exactly like GS Thin Mints. I melted the chips in the microwave, dipped the Chessmen in the melted chips, put on a paperplate, then into the freezer for about 10 mins. Delicious! A quick and easy snack.

GREAT and oh so easy.  

I would stick with the bittersweet (which is not really bitter).  If you use milk chocolate, they are to soft to hold unless you keep them in the refrigerator.

Also, like someone else said, there is a faint salt taste.  FIXED:  I now make these with LOW SODIUM Ritz and there's no after taste.

You can also buy the chocolate wafers that another writer uses.  

All in all a great, great time saver.

I don't know if I would say they taste just like the girl scout cookies, but close...and much cheaper!  My son loved them but my daughter took one bite and wouldn't touch it again. A bit time consuming but still very easy!

This is a simple recipe...but the dipping isn't as easy!  I ended up only being able to make 64, probably due to the chocolate holding on to the cracker and me not willing to hold it, shake it, etc. to get the excess to fall off!  They need to be in the refrigerator for quite a while before they will come off of the pan.  I loved the idea of using a pan with a design on the bottom and that came out great!  But next time, I'm going to use parchment paper and a quarter to a half pound more chocolate!  And there will definitely be a next time.  They are delicious and addicting!!!

I used the thin chocolate wafers and the Andes Candies baking chips. When set, I drizzled some red and green designs on them. Unfortunately, when you use the thin chocolate cookies, so many break as you take them out of the package, so I had a lot of “half cookies”. Actually, when decorated and on the plate with the whole cookies, they looked great!
I have not tried the Ritz crackers, so I gave this review 5 stars so to not negatively affect the original post. Thanks for a great idea!

Seemed like a great idea, but these tasted nothing like a Thin Mint, sadly. They tasted like Ritz crackers dipped in almond bark, with a hint of mint.

Great idea!!!!  I also tried these with vanilla wafers and my family LOVES them!  They were easy and fast to make.  We got creative with candy toppings with them as well.  Thank you! ;)

Wonderful and easy to do. I used Andes mints to dip the Ritz crackers as a basic minty good cookie.  I then used graham crackers (breaking each square in half) and topped each section with three small marshmallows and broiled them until just slightly brown. Top each section with another graham cracker and dip in chocolate mixture. Similar to S'Mores around the campfire. I also experimented with peanut butter. In between graham crackers and they were a big hit with the kids.

I made this with graham crackers instead. I think the chocolate was a little more bitter than if I would have used semi-sweet. Next time I know. 1 bag of chocolate chips to 1/4 tablespoon of extract worked fine for ratios.

These were easy but a miss with my family (which doesn't happen often with sweets).  They were much too bitter.  I drizzled white chocolate on them to help but the kids and my husband still weren't impressed.  If I try these again, I'll use a less bitter chocolate or the Andes mints and nilla wafers that others suggested.  I think those would be a bigger hit for my clan.

I have made these for many years. I use equal amounts of dark and milk chocolate for mine with peppermint oil. Definitely don't add peppermint until chocolate is melted. Also, we found that an Easter egg wire dipper works great when dipping the crackers into the chocolate. We have used the snowflake Ritz crackers and they work just as well. We have used blue and white snowflakes on top for a winter theme, too.

Easy, beautiful, and delicious! As suggested by other reviewers, I used Andes baking chips instead of mixing the chocolate and peppermint extract. I also used the snowflake shaped Ritz crackers that I happened to spot at the grocery store. I put some red/green/white sprinkles on to dress them up a bit. They turned out fabulous!

OMG!  These are amazing!  They are easy to make, taste just like the GS Thin Mints cookies and I can have them All year round.  Made some exactly as recipe states, and another batch using Andes mint chips and Maria's cookies. Both batches came out amazing.  New favorite in our house - for me because they are so darn easy to make, and for the rest of the family/friends because they just taste AWESOME!  thanks OP for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was yummy. I didn't use a double boiler method- I just melted the chips over very low heat in a saucepan. I had to add just a little milk to smooth it out, which makes the chocolate take longer to set, but after putting the cookies in the fridge, it was fine. Very easy- very pretty!

Thin Mints have always held a special place in my heart so when I came across this recipe, I had serious doubt that something so simple could produce my beloved cookie.  Much to my surprise, this is a mighty fine copy of my favorite Girl Scout cookie!!  I made some with sprinkles, some with crushed candy cane, and some I left plain.  I actually preferred them plain but all versions were yummy.  Made it just as written using Ghiredelli bitterweet choco chips.  Using Andes chips as others have mentioned would cut down on an ingredient but we're only talking 3 ingredients.  Mmmmmmm.

I'm giving it four stars just because the idea was there. Like other viewers I used the Andes Baking chips with Ritz crackers. Easy & cheap, only two ingredients. I tried first to used the actual Andes thin mint candies and it just didn't work. Definately plan to use th Andes baking chips - its well worth an extra trip to the store! My kids stand by the counter drooling all ver my floor when I make these so have a mop ready!

The fact that this recipe is as simple as it is just blows my mind I love it. In fact the reviewer who said "monkeys could make this" is probably right. I can't say that these are my favorite cookies but they were a huge hit with my Mom and Dad.

I first made these cookies from a Nabisco cookbook. The party crowd loved them. So easy! The original recipe suggested adding crushed candy cane on top before the cool. Adds a nice festive decoration. I plan on making them again for both a cookie exchange party and our holiday gathering. You should try them.

I made these just like the recipe says except I melted the chips in the microwave and they are great!! I went a little heavy on the chocolate and they came out very rich, so next time, I will make sure there is a thin layer of chocolate coating. I topped with crushed candy canes and my daughters loved them even more. They set in the freezer in just about 15 minutes or so.  Will make a nice treat to give out at Christmas!

this is a great recipe, but there are a few things to change around that are very easy and helpful...
i changed from rits or butter crackers to stick pretzles, for easy access for guests and less of a hastle for my 5 joyful children.
i also tryed it with peppermint extract and chocolate, and andes mints both ways are fine but andes mints are more fool proof, if you have a concern with the chocolate melting in the micro, just at a 3/4 tbl spoon -1 tbl spoon of shortning (crisco, butter flavored is what i use) and this will stop the issue, also moving your temp on your micro to 70% will also limit this issue.
I also tryed chocolate nilla wafers, oreos, and a few others with a chocolate base these are great especially with some ice cream and frozen in plastic wrap... if you want more info contact me...Thanks enjoy

Oh my GOSH!  I cannot BELIEVE how close these come to "The Real Thing"!  Now I don't have to wait for the girls in their green and brown uniforms to come around selling their boxes of cookies (although I WILL continue to support them when they DO sell them).  My dad thought my mom had been hiding a box of Thin Mints from him!  Of course, once he really looked at it, he realized the inside was light colored and not a chocolate cookie.  He couldn't believe they were made with Ritz crackers.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These were the easiest to make. My family loves them. I will share the recipe with all my friends.
I melted my chocolate in the microwave and it goes so much faster. I will be making these all year long. Not just at Christmas.

Very simple, but good. I did not have any peppermint extract so I used 5 drops of peppermint oil and they are fantastic.

These "cookies" are soooo good! I spent a LOT of time actually making the Thin Mints from scratch and it was such a hassle and a mess. This recipe is much quicker, easier, and tastier!

ok, so i cheated a bit - i discarded the filling (broke my heart) of oreo cookies and coated them with melted andes mint cream chocolates (my grocery store was out of mint extract). i sprinkled some candy sprinkles on top and put in the freezer for a couple minutes and they are PERFECT. cant believe they were so easy to make (even if i did go the chocolate chips and mint extract route). i just had one now, ima go grab another one.

Absolutely Yummy! These were very easy and loved by everyone. I used the Andes Mint chips and the "toothpick" method mentioned in an earlier review to dip the cracker. I really think the cold cookie sheet helped the cracker to set smoothly, so don't skip that step. Divine!

Like other reviewers, used andes mints.  I melted them in a glass bowl with a hairdryer on low.  Put my cookies sheets in the freezer before hand and then just put it back in the freezer to set.  Next time will use low-sodium ritz crackers.  Made them again but now I didn't have andes mints available and melted half milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips and added peppermint oil (about 5 drops per pound of chocolate).  The chocolate was very thick but worked well.  Andes mint was better.

I cheated and used the Andes Mint pieces from the baking aisle at the grocery store. Perfect for when you just want a quick treat - pour some Andes pieces in a bowl, melt them in the microwave, dip a few crackers and pop them in the fridge for five minutes. Yum!

One word: FABULOUS!  I think instead of buying thin mints every year I am just going to make sure I always have the supplies on hand to make my own!  I used Club crackers broken in half and melted Andes mints baking chips.  Super easy and delicious!  My 3 year old kept sneaking in the fridge to get more!  Thank you for this easy recipe!  **Also wanted to note that I put my cookies on wax paper and put them in the freezer.  This hurried the process up and the cleanup was super fast too.**

So good and super easy.  I love that I can keep these supplies on hand to be able to make them at any time.  I like to use low salt Ritz crackers so that there's no hint of salt at all.  My four-year-old loved doing this with me (although we kept the ones she dipped just for our family - not quite as pretty).

I made these over the Christmas holidays and everyone that tried them loved them and couldn't believe how they tasted exactly like a Girl Scout thin mint!  They were delicious, and I never would have guessed they were made with Ritz crackers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are good, but I expected a little more out of them after reading the reviews.  I don't like them as much as Girl Scout Thin Mints - but in fairness, I LOVE those!  I used the new flavor of Ritz cracker, honey butter, so there was no salt issue to worry about.  I think these would be better with slightly sweeter chocolate.

Taste just like the Girl Scout Cookies.  My friend actually told me about this recipe before I found it on this site, and she used crushed up candy cane on top to decorate.  They are yummy!

Fabulous cookies! I used Nabisco Famous chocolate wafers and melted Andes mints, too (great suggestions!) and they taste just like girl scout cookies.  I tried a few ritz crackers, and they were so not as good as as the chocoate wafers.  So easy to make - I'll make them all the time now!

they were wonderful tasted just like thin mints. i dipped half of the cookie in the chocolate and then put red sprinkles on it for some festive colors.

This was ok.  

I followed the advice of another review on here and microwaved the chocolate - BIG MISTAKE!  Chocolate is too delicate for intense heat, hence the double boiler method.  It turned out melted in a huge blob.  So follow the recipe!

When melted correctly (2nd batch!) I found it hard to dip the crackers and get the chocolate to stick.

Instead I used the peppermint flavour chocolate, added crushed candycanes, and made a fabulous chocolate bark.

These are so good and are very easy to make!! It’s hard to believe they are made with Ritz crackers. Like other reviewers, I used Andes Crème de Menthe baking chips and reduced sodium crackers. I also cooled them on wax paper and they came right up once the chocolate hardened.  Everyone who ate my cookies gave rave reviews. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Superb!  I made these for my annual cookie exchange party and they were a hit.  This is incredibly easy.  I've been searching for chocolate wafers with no luck but several people said they liked the buttery taste of the Ritz cracker with the mint chocolate.  This is a keeper!

These were very easy and tasted like thin mints.  I made a small first batch with semi sweet chips and extract to make sure the extract wouldn't seize the chocolate.  When it worked, I made a bigger batch and melted a little paraffin wax in the chips.  The wax made all the difference in the dipping.  The second batch was smooth and presentation worthy.  I added some red/green sprinkles, etc for Christmas.  Easy cookie to add to holiday baking.

For the few ingredients-- these are awesome! I used low sodium ritz crackers with andes mints melted-- SO easy! I popped the baking sheets in the freezer for 10 minutes, then lined them with wax paper, light spray of pam, microwaved mints, 2 forks, and they were done, absolutely no mess at all. Next time will try with the chocolate wafers but these are pretty  good =)

I don't like thin mints, but my husband does and he said these came out great!!  Dipping the cracker was a tad tricky, but I used 2 forks and it worked well.

Great taste, quick to make.  But I got around 30 cookies, no where close to 80.

These suprising taste so much like Thin Mints.  My husband LOVED them!! I was only dissappointed in that the chocolate didn't cover anywhere close to 80 crackers...only about 20.  Other than that they were great!

These were great!  And sooooo easy!
I had to use a little bit of milk in the mixture however because the chocolate I used would become rather thick not long after it had initially melted.  Kind of like it was burning. The milk remedied that. I used about twice the called for amount of peppermint extract. I also sprinkled some coconut on top of a few.  They were great. :)

I love the taste, but I had some trouble dipping them into the chocolate. This was probably because it was my first attempt at dipping something in chocolate. I also made the mistake of leaving them on the cookie sheet in my fridge overnight. They seem to have stuck to the pan.... Since I only did half the recipe, I'll try again and use wax paper on the cookie sheet, and maybe not leave them in there overnight. If possible, I'll report any future success/failure with this theory! :)

Per my boys, awesome.  They said they tasted similar to TM cookies but not exactly.  Could be because I used my semi-sweet I had on hand.  I will try the Andes suggestion below next time.

Loved this recipe! It was so easy to throw together without any measuring and everyone loved them. One problem though, I had no idea how flammable peppermint extract was! I went to pour in my teaspoon and a drop hit the flame on my stove and poof the whole bottle along with my hand caught on fire! Even with the painful burns the cookies were amazingly delicious, Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't overjoyed with this. Personal tastes I'm sure.  I tried Ritz crackers and the chocolate wafers and actually like it with the crackers better, but again...personal tastes.  The recipe was easy enough - I used the Andes chips and Nestles Mint Chocolate Chips and a little bit of Crisco

When I saw "Girl Scout Cookies", I couldn't resist trying this recipe out! I did things a bit quicker though- Substituting the chocolate with Andes Baking Chips. Just popped them in a bowl in the microwave, and drudged Chocolate Graham Cracker Sticks through the melted mint bliss! Layed them out on foil and let'em set in the fridge for about 15 mins. LOVED THEM. I'll be sure to keep these ingredients on hand to subdue my sweet tooth. Very simple. I'll have to rate it a 4 though since i just went by the basic idea. Thanks!!!

Oh - these are so good!  I will never buy girl scout thin mints again (sorry girl scouts!).

Instead of melting chocolate in a double-boiler, I used 1/2 a package of chocolate almond bark (on the baking isle).  That's what I use for all my chocolate needs.  It melts in the microwave in 90 seconds - so easy.  I added the pepperment extract, and the chocolate got a little weird.  So per the package - I added a tiny bit of shortening, and the chocolate was perfect for dipping.  I used a big bowl, throw in a few crackers and mix around with a spoon.  Then I fish out the crackers with the spoon, and lay them on a lined baking sheet.  I don't put mine in the freezer to set - they get all sweaty when you take them out.  Instead, I delay my pleasure for about 20 minutes - and let them set on the countertop until they are ready.  It's worth the wait!

These were simple to make and extremely good. I don't have to wait for my annual fix of GS thin mints- I can enjoy these at anytime. I reduced the recipe and yielded 15 vs. 20. All in all, very pleased and will definitely make these again!

These were awesome.  I made them for our Mother's Day lunch on Sunday.  I have to hide these from the family.  I let them try one and their begging for more.  Thanks for the easy, tasty recipe.

This cookie was so easy to make and was such a hit with everyone who tried them. Some people didn't believe they were homemade. Definetly freeze the cookie sheets and cover them with wax paper for easy freezing. I put the freshly-dipped cookies in the freezer to cool quickly. Excellent cookie!
