This salad is fantastic!! I always use spring mix as the bitter lettuce goes well with the orange essence dried cranberries I add as well.  You have to be sure to toast the walnuts as it really enhances the flavor. I usually only use ~1/3 cup.  Usually I leave the skin on the apple and always put the chopped pieces in a bowl with diluted lemon juice to keep from turning brown.  Be sure to dry off apples before adding to salad.  Newman's Own Light Raspberry Walnut Vinagrette is a must!!

Great salad.  However, there was too much cheese and apples for the amount of lettuce.  Next time I will either double the amount of lettuce - or cut the cheese and apple amounts in half.

Great salad. I would not reccommend adding dressing until last minute as it made my greens kind of limp. Wonderful flavor and presentation. Will make again!!

This was a very deliscious salad!  I made it for a friend for lunch and she was so delighted!  She said she usually orders a salad like this at her favorite restaurant!  She said it is good with pears and chicken, too.  I will try that next time.

I love this salad.  I first had it at an upscale restraunt that I love.  I have since made it myself and it is wonderful.  I tend to make it a little different each time.  I have used gorgonzola and blue cheese before.  I have also changed the fruit by using halved grapes or sliced strawberries.  DELISH!!!!

This was a big disappointment.  I think the cheese was the problem.  Too strong and overpowered the salad.  I tried it on dinner guests and I could tell they didn't like it.  Won't make this one again.

This is a wonderful and easy dish.  I was out of walnuts so substituted pecans, which I toasted, and used feta cheese rather than gorgonzola.  I tossed it with Ken's Steakhouse Lite Raspberry Walnut Vineagrette.  Fabulous!!  I will be using this for a gathering at my home this weekend.

This was a good salad and it was easy to make.  Some of my guests weren't a fan of the dressing.  I think it would be just as good with a ranch or other type of dressing.  It's also good the next day.

This is a great salad.  I usually use a balsamic vinaigrette dressing because I like the tart contrast with the fruit.  With Gorgonzola cheese I use pears and with apples I use crumbled goat cheese.  The salad is such a great base that you can throw in whatever you want - I've tried chopped dried figs, blackberries, dried cranberries, 'craisins' - depending on the season.

This is an excellent salad.  I brought it to our potluck and the nurses at my hospital loved it!  I mixed spinach with baby greens, used 1/2 C Walnuts (toasted), only 4 oz. of the gorgonzola and soaked the apples in dilute lemon sauce as suggested (thank you).  I used Newmans Own Raspberry Walnut Vinagrette and it was delish.  I should have made more... it disappeared so fast.

Yummy salad. I toasted the walnuts because I like that flavor better than just walnuts out of the bag. Very simple and quick salad.

Excellent and easy salad.  I soaked the apple chunks in a diluted lemon juice to keep them from browning.  My husband loved this and he usually will not eat salads!

Wow Candice! What a great salad! I have made this several times according to the recipe. However, on a recent trip to Nordstroms I found a Dark Cherry Balsamic Vinaigrette. Coupled with finely chopped cooked bacon pieces, this salad became even more outstanding. A keeper at this house! Thanks so much.

I have yet to try this salad, but it sounds like a salad that Panera serves, which I order everytime I am at the resturant! I would suggest using manadrin oranges for the apples if you would like a different taste!

Excellent!! I added dried cranberries for more of a holiday feel and brought this salad to Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it and I receive nothing but complements. The only downfall is that it is slightly expensive to make.

Absolutely delish! The tartness of the apples balance the cheese perfectly and the raspberry dressing is like the cherry on top. I've served this for two dinner parties now, with rave reviews.

I had a very similar salad at a good Italian restaurant and have been making it for myself ever since--I make it to take to work for lunch in a 1.5 quart container thusly:  a bunch of greens, 2 T gorgonzola cheese, 1T chopped walnuts, 1 T chopped dried cranberries, 3 oz. grilled or roasted chicken, 1/2 chopped Granny Smith apple and 1 oz. Newman's low-fat cranberry-walnut salad dressing, added just before eating and shaken well in the container--Delicious, nutritous, filling and less than 300 calories--Can't beat it!!

We liked the way the tartness of the apple balanced the sharp flavor of the cheese.

I loved this salad, I replaced the cheese with feta (because I love feta) and it was great.  My boyfriend and I were fighting over the last bit of it.  I didn't know he'd fight for veggies.

OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!  This is my new "fave".  I eat this a few nights a week.  I like to use Gorganzola Piccante and a low-cal, raspberry-walnut viniagrette.  It's so easy to throw together.  A "must try"!  Thanks!

All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!! This went over great with a baby shower guests this last spring. Instead of raspberry vinaigrette I used some Lighthouse Huckleberry vinaigrette and it was simply blissful! My guests couldn't get enough of it. I loved the way all the flavors blended together. This recipe is proof that simple can be sophisticated - and delicious too!

Wow!! This is good and very quick to fix salad. The only suggestion I have is that I am going to make the Candied Pecans/Walnuts recipe on this site.  I've made these last year, but, just for snacking and they were soo good. I'm betting that candying the nuts will add that little extra oomph.
Make it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks Candice.

This salad was very easy to make.  I will make it again.  I used red apples since I didn't have green (plus red adds some color).  It would also be good if mandarin oranges were used in place of apples.  Unless you expect the salad to be eaten in one sitting, I would recommend serving the dressing on the side--otherwise, the greens will get soggy.

This is a wonderful salad, sometimes I use craisins and honey roasted sliced almonds /(almond accents) instead of the apples and walnuts.  An elegant favorite every time!

This salad was incredible and caused me to write my first review on this site.  I always read all the reviews prior to trying a recipe and then use my common sense and taste buds to adjust the quantity of ingredients as needed.  I knew that Gargonzola cheese would not work for me so I used Feta and just cut down the amount a little.  I'm taking it to a spiritual retreat this weekend and am thrilled with the results.  Added some golden raisins as suggested and used half apple and half pear with candied walnuts.  Thank you for such a taste treat.

Absolutely wonderful.  Next time I would buy the crumbled cheese from the grocery store because I had a hard time getting the block cheese to crumble nicely for me at home.

Very good salad. Be careful when adding the dressing.  I went a little overboard and it was saturated too much.  I didn't add the gorgonzola cheese because I'm not a fan of it but I added dried cranberries. Good recipe!

I make this almost daily, generally using fresh orange instead of apple because it goes so well with Gorgonzola, and I use dried cranberries, toasted
sesame seeds, and a variety of nuts.  Newman's raspberry vinaigrette is
wonderful on this, and it's a pretty salad with oranges and cranberries.

Overall this was a great salad.  I used candied walnuts to help balance out the stinky cheese--which, incidentally, did not "crumble" as easily as I might have hoped.

I was really excited to make this salad. It was ok ,however it was not great..This is a good salad for dinner, good with  creamy soup and crusty bread. I would make this again. This would be fine for small gatherings but not a formal dinner party.

What a yummy salad!  The vinegarette dressing combined with Gorganzola is a hit with the fruitiness of apple.   I toasted the walnuts a bit prior to adding to the salad and would reduce the amt of apples and walnuts next time.

Per other reviewers, I used Feta cheese, Granny Smith apples and romaine/spinach.  I tossed the apples in lemon juice prior to leaving for the party this salad was to be served at.  Much to my surprise, most of the salad was eaten but I didn't hear rave reviews some of the other posters did.  Though we enjoyed it for a change, I won't be making this very often, it's just not an every-day sort of salad for us.

I thought this was really a nice salad.  I used the Newman's light raspberry vinagrette, as recommended, and also tossed in some raisins.  As for the amounts of everything...I just put in what I wanted instead of following the directions.  That way it was just as I wanted.  I almost gave this a five star rec.  But, it just didn't quite get there.  I really wanted more color in the salad.  Sounds silly, but it wasn't as pretty as I like :>.

Pretty good, but I thought it had too much of just about everything for the amount of greens -  too many nuts & apples as well as too much cheese & dressing.  The flavors were good, so I will try this again with the same amount of greens & half (or less) of the other ingredients.

omg is this salad delicious!! i followed the suggestions from other readers, toasted the walnuts & added a handful of golden raisins. as far as dressing, olde cape cod's lite raspberry vinaigrette worked very well. i never had such rave reviews over a salad (even from two finicky men). thank you candice for this fabulous recipe!

I have a very similar recipe that uses spinach, I added mixed greens and spinach together and used Feta cheese, because it's my favorite, (in some reveiws I noticed $ was mentioned, using 1/2 spinach and 1/2 greens keeps the cost down)  Absolutely great my 3 year old loves it!!!1

This was fantastic!  I toasted the walnuts and added dried cranberries.  To the reviewer who complained about too much red onion...it doesn't even call for red onion!  Its important to read a recipe carefully before you make it and then rate it!  Anyway it was supurb!  Thanks

With the dressing being so good, the greens so good, the toasted walnuts sooo good, I thought the red onion overpowered the taste of everything.   Will try it again without the red onions.  Roasted onions carmelized were devine!!!!

I took this to a block party and everyone raved about it.  I would probably change the dressing to a balsamic vinaigrette and maybe add bleu cheese instead.  But everyone else at the party would probably just keep it the same!

This salad was delicious; we took it on our 4th of July picnic and loved it. I can't wait to make it again and try different flavor combinations - red onion or dried cherries would be nice additions.

This was a wonderful salad. I followed the directions except that I used the Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing from AllRecipes instead of purchased dressing. I also tossed the chopped apples in lemon juice to keep them from turning brown. Next time I'll try some of the other suggestions such as adding dried cranberries.

I loved this recipe as did my guests. It requires a more sophisticated palate due to the strong flavor of the gorgonzola cheese, so if you are not a fan of "smelly cheeses" you might not care for this. My twelve-year-old did love this salad, but he's been brought up on smelly cheeses! Great recipe.

Good salad with a good flavor profile. My changes included using a cranberry, walnut, and Gorgonzola dressing from Trader Joes because it mixes with the Gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts I used. I would also use less cheese next time. 1/2 pound of Gorgonzola cheese was a bit excessive. The cheese somewhat overpowered the other flavors.

I was looking for a different salad to take to a family gathering.  This one sounded pretty easy to make (I love recipes with not a lot of ingredients!) and it was really easy.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks Candice!

Tasty salad! I have made this for birthday dinners and family occasions. I always use the raspberry dressing from Trader Joe's and it turns out great. If I am seving to those who might be health conscious, I omit the cheese and still turns out ok.

Mmmmmm. I didn't have everything on hand, but it inspired me. I used toasted almonds and sundried tomato dressing. It was a huge hit and looked so elegant. I'm going to experiment with various cheese, nut, fruit combinations.

Salads aren't usually "stand out" in a meal, but this one is!!!  Made this for a large group of in-laws and friends.  It was definitely well received.

This salad was wonderful. My husband and son ate it right up. We didn't have Raspberry dressing so we used Pomegranate dressing. We also used red delicious apples since that is what we had. I really liked the mix of flavors.

I make this salad, but I use Candied Walnuts, Pears and Feta Cheese with grapes on the side. Great flavors combine for a great autumn salad!
