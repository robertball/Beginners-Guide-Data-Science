My whole immediate family went camping this weekend and combined we have quite a few kids. This was a great and fun idea for snacking. I bought all kinds of fruits, nuts, seeds, cereal and candies, gave each child a ziploc bag and let them choose what they wanted in their bags. They loved it and even the adults made some bags too! :)

This was the perfect trail mix while hanging out at the campsite.  I changed it a little. I added plain M&M's, and chocolate covered raisins.  I also used a tropical berry fruit mix, and it was just plain yummy! Everyone who tried it, loved it!  Good combination of energy, that's for sure.

Loved how you can vary this to whatever you like. We did add the plain M&Ms as well as cashews and almonds.

We are trying to eat healthier and this is a snack that we are reaching for instead of chips, etc. I admit that I do add my M&M's and Reese's Pieces though ;-) This is a great recipe, thank you.

I find this recipe to be perfect in any combination and quantity of the listed ingredients so feel free to adjust it to suit your taste, needs, or to what you have on hand.   Also, note that if the weather is on the warmer side, any candy type addition, even M & M's will melt from the moisture released from the dried fruit. Everyone in the family really enjoyed this Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

This was easy, and left a lot of room for adapting for personal preferences. I love this recipe, and it saved me a lot of money making this myself. I love the sunflower seeds in it.
I used mixed nuts, and also added m&ms.

I used a package of mixed dried fruit: apricots, pears, apples and prunes. I did dried cranberries, sunflower seeds and honey roasted peanuts for the rest. It tastes pretty good, my daughter loves the dried fruits!

great balance of tastes and textures - not too sweet, not too sticky or crunchy, and my kids loved helping me mix it up.  Made a big batch before our road trip and it was a great on-the-go snack.

excellent mix. It gave me a great starting spot. I like a lot of variation so I added raisins and dried cranberries, and peanuts and walnuts. It was an instant hit.

Great recipe for hiking. Exact amounts are not important. I also added dried blueberries later.

How can you go wrong with trail mix?
I added some toffee chips and pecans.  Yummy!  
Good to eat at all those softball games.

This is a great recipe as you can make to your taste.  The sunflower seeds & unsalted peanuts are the staple then add whatever dried fruit, added nuts, etc. you like.  Thanks for an addictive snack mix!

I love this recipe, as it is a great starting spot to customize to your own preferences.  There is always something I don't like, or something I wish there was more of in commercial trail mix....thanks for sharing!!

This is a good base for a very good snack. I would say that the flavor will definitely depend on the fruit combo and how sweet they are. In terms of the nuts you choose also this will alter the final product's flavor. I used roasted sweet peanuts and honestly did not have enough apricots but made up the rest with more of the dried cranberries, raisins, and dried cherries. I could not find unsalted sunflower seeds, but the outcome after mixing everything was EXCELLENT! Will make it again and vary it with several other small dried fruits.
