These are quite tasty.  I made them as directed except I made half the recipe for a first try because I wasn't sure how they would turn out.  I have never made roasted walnuts before, but these came out more tender than crunchy.  Not that it is a bad thing, it is just not what I had expected.  They are good by themselves, I can't wait to put them in a salad or on top of vanilla ice cream... yum!

Just made a batch of these using pecans instead of walnuts.  Not sure if was the kind of nuts I used or if my oven bakes hot but they only took 1 hour at 200.  They may be the best thing I've ever tasted - even better than the ones we had at Disney World.  I also used parchment paper & they didn't stick at all, although I did stir them after the first 30 minutes.  If they last long enough they may be really good in salads.

Fantastic! I can't stop snacking! I made these to bring with me to the gym for an after-workout treat and they turned out great. Plus baking them made the kitchen smell delicious. About halfway through baking I'd recommend flipping them with a spatula or gently shaking the pan so they don't stick as much.

After trying several recipes for cinnamon walnuts, I can honestly say this one is the easiest and it succeeds every time.  For a little extra flavor, I added a small pinch of cloves and nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Packaged in cellophane treat bags, these cinnamon walnuts were a hit with my co-workers. They are best made with granulated white sugar. When I tried coconut sugar for one batch, they were less crunchy and slightly sticky, though still delicious.

Fantastic recipe! I’ve used it three times this season and they cam e out wonderful each time. It’s best to turn over the nuts midway through cooking.

Really tasty and very easy.  I decreased the cinnamon just a bit and also stirred half way through the baking.  Made a great addition to my Christmas goodie gift boxes.
