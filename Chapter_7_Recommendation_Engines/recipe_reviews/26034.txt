This is not meant to be baked in a 9x9 pan, a 9x13 is more like it! Very good flavor!

This brings back wonderful memoryies of baking with my grandma when I was young. I don't have her recipe but this is exactly like the one she made right down to the frosting, we must have doubled ther recipe as we always made a 9x13, It is easy, moist,dense and flavorful. Thanks for sharing,
I can't wait to make it for my family.

This is an old fashioned cake.  When I was growing up we called it "Lazy Dazy Cake".  I always double the broiled on frosting ingredients.  I'm glad to have found the recipe for this sentimental favorite!

My family has been making this cake for years.  After icing put cake under broiler to brown coconut.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I recommend broiling the topping however and have even omitted the nuts on occasion when I didn't have them on hand.  My recipe calls for 1 1/4c boiling water to 1c oatmeal and letting it sit for 20 minutes.  The topping is 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c brown sugar, 4TBS milk, 1c coconut.

A good cake recipe, but the topping on mine all went to the sides of the pan!  When I took it out the sides of the cake had a jelly-ish coating from the icing mixture.  It tasted nice, but it wasn't what I was expecting.

good, but not a big seller at my house because of the pecans in the icing.  The cake was moist and stayed that way for a long time.  Very spicy and good.  Great fall cake.  11/2007

I have the postcard that my aunt mailed the recipe to my Mother on in 1964.  It is really delicious.  We always added a small can of crushed pineapple and my mother use to add some drained fruit cocktail instead of the pineapple but the pineapple is my favorite.

Needs to be made in a larger pan so the topping doesn't spill over into the oven - wouldn't want to waste any of that gooey deliciousness!

I left off the pecans for my husband, but we all liked the cake.  It is an excellent spice cake, but the topping was a little chewy.

Fantastic cake!  Moist and dense and delicious.  I omitted the egg in the icing and broiled it for a couple of minutes.  Rave reviews from guests.

We thought this was very good.  The icing was NOT like German Choc. cake icing, but it did add a lot of moisture to the cake and had a good flavor.

It was good but not great!  The icing did not turn out as expected.  Some reviewers said it was just like German Choc. cake icing.  I probably won't make it again.  Kids didn't get too excited about it even though we did end up eating it all.

This is what we call "The Reunion Cake" as Great Great Gram always brought it...several of them in fact.  We, too, placed it under the broiler, after frosting, "to bubble".  Mmmmmmmm, so good and great memories.

This is an excellent cake recipe! I did bake it in a 9x13 pan and it was perfect.

I did not make the broiled icing however, I was in the mood for caramel icing so I made that instead. Wow! Deliciousness!!!

Try this recipe & you won't be sorry if you like spicy spice cakes. (Make sure your spices are fresh.) It reminds me very much of gingerbread (cake).

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!!!
