Pretty tasty, but I would boil the sprouts for a bit longer because they came out pretty crunchy even after cooking for the maximum time specified in the recipe. I prefer them a bit softer. I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and it still turned out tasty.

Woo these were yummy!! I boiled these for a bit longer.  I didn't add the onion or fresh garlic but I did add garlic powder. These are a keeper.

A good, classic brussell sprouts recipe. I also put about a tablespoon of brown sugar on when I added the seasonings, and this works fine with yellow onion, too, if you happen to be out of red...

My husband and I really liked this recipe! We love brussels and normally just roast them. I made these for Valentine's Day, and we ate every bite! I browned the butter, then added the onions and brussels in to the same pan. I hate using more pans than necessary. They turned out great!

I followed the recipe - the Brussels sprouts came out half done and half burned. I'll try again.

6 26 17  While these tasted "fine," they weren't anything special & not worth the time & dishes.

Excellent!  Made as written except with half the oil and half the butter and it was outstanding. Will definitely make again.

I was a little bit nervous to try this but happy I did! My hubby and I have a new favorite side dish.I used butter flavored Crisco instead of oil and added some fresh mushrooms that I had in the fridge. Yummy!

I wasn't a brussel sprout fan...until now. I needed a quick and easy recipe that was different from the other vegetables that I normally cook.  I tried it, I loved it and my family loved it! Delicious!

I had company over for Easter dinner and boy these brussel sprouts were the first thing to go.  I should have made more.  Followed the recipe as called for and I tell you I will make these again and again...thanks for the great recipe.  I tried Chef John's recipe also and we liked these better. Not sure if it was the cold water bath that did the trick because I always cooked them in a steamer and they always came out a little soggy.

This recipe got my husband to eat and love brussels sprouts! Thank you for helping me to find a way to incorporate this as a weekly vegetable with our meals.
