This was okay, I'd rather have a real pizza. I used some sliced serrano peppers on mine, instead of green pepper. I probably won't make again, but thanks for letting me try this out.

Ellen, this is a delightful appetizer!   So easy to make and wonderful to taste.  The only change I made was to use Sundried Tomato Basil tortillas.  I would recommend using the olives, green peppers and tomatos!  Don't leave them out because they make the recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing.

I enjoyed this:o) You can certainly alter the ingredients to your taste but I like it as written. My DH wanted me to use pepperoni instead of turkey. I told him if you want a pizza, order one.
Tasty, quick, & most importantly, I didn't have to heat up my kitchen. In August. THANK YOU:o)

This is not bad.  I wouldn't make this expecting to have a pizza; perhaps that's why some reviewers didn't like this.  It's easy and quick, and I had most of the ingredients to make this for lunch today.  I did do a few things differently bc I'm not a fan of cooking in the microwave--just a quirk of mine.  I put on the toppings, (minus the top layer of cheese) then broiled in the oven for a minute or two, then added some Italian seasoning and the cheese topping, broiled a few more minutes, then topped with the second tortilla and broiled again until it start to brown (which takes less than a minute).  If you broil, definitely keep an eye on it, as it can burn quickly!  Then I put it on a plate and cut into wedges from there.  I made two different kinds--one with mushrooms, one with olives bc bf doesn't like olives and I don't like mushrooms.  I think next time I might try frying it on the stovetop like a quesadilla--the bottom got a little soggy, but nothing we couldn't handle.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made for a great yet quick lunch for me.  I left out the olives but added jalapenos instead.  Thanks, Nurse Ellen!

YUm.. made these for work lunches this week. Only change was to add some sauteed broccoli slaw to them to bulk them up. Popped them in freezer and then took to work and nuked
