These are delish, with a bacony bite to the taste. I am a big fan of the old fashioned deviled eggs, but this for a summer picnic or cook out is a great alternative to the origianl!...good job!

ps. if you use real from the farm eggs you will get a more deeper yellow/orange yolk...but if you use store bought as i did when i first made these, I added a touch of red or yellow food coloring to deeping the texture a bit on the filling. Also, be sure and use older eggs, not too fresh of eggs do to the fact that fresh eggs can tear off the white in chunks when peeled, and you will think you did not cook them long enough. Hope this helps!

I made these once for a party and now everyone wants me to bring them everytime! The most interesting part - many times people that swear they don't like deviled eggs will take 2-3 of these! I also add a little sour cream to make it smoother. 

And, for decorating purposes, I put the yolk mixture into a bag, cut the corner off and pipe it into the eggs! I sprinkle it all with slices of green onion!

Very good after I made a couple adjustments.  I added a little bit of finely choppedd white onion and I used bacon bits b/c it was a lot easier.  My family really liked them!! They said it was a nice change to the typical deviled eggs.  I also used light mayo ot lighten it up a little and reduced fat cheese.

Original review Oct 12, 2008:I don't normally love deviled eggs. Like, at all. But these were killer!Half sour cream, half mayo? Even better.
I also added a little chopped chives and
green onion and dusted the tops with paprika.
EDITED: I've made this deviled egg recipe many times now and every single time it turns out fantastic. This is also just as good with turkey bacon or pre-packaged bacon bits and I've found that this is wonderful with just about any cheese, especially white cheddar cheese or pepperjack. I like to add a little hot sauce to the filling as I'm mixing it, too. For easy piping, I used a ziploc bag that I spooned the filling into, then cut a corner out of the side of the bag. I just squeezed the egg filling carefully into the egg. When I'm finished, I just throw out the bag. 

Nom. My husband and I fought over the last one. These are definetly making an 
appearance for my next holiday dinner.

I pretty much followed the recipe except due to time constraints I used premade bacon that you can cook in the microwave by Oscar Meyer. It worked REALLY well and crumbled better than the regular bacon, with less mess! (You may ahve to use more than 4 though as they are much smaller.) I also crushed an extra bacon slice into a fine pulp and sprinkled in on top of the eggs. For a decorative twist I put the yolk in a pastry bag and used a wide tip to put the filling in the whites instead of spooning them in like usual. I also used light mayo, lowfat cheddar and I didn't know if I was supposed to use powedered mustard or yellow mustard, I used the yellow mustard and it worked great and added color.

I LOVE eggs -- especially when they are "deviled" -- so I used this recipe as the base for a chopped egg salad hors d'ouerve I made for a group luncheon. My personal tweakings: a tad more mayonnaise, a squirt of ketchup, 1/8 tsp. horseradish and 2 shakes of tabasco sauce. I used 18 eggs (1-1/2 dozen) to present to 8 women and, when spread rather generously on 36 toasted triangles (9 slices of bread) and topped with a tiny slice of cherry tomato, they simply disappeared! :) I, personally, attribute my "pretty platter presentation" with the success of this recipe, but, more than likely, the BACON (and 2 T. of bacon drippings which I added to the mixture) may have had something to do with it, too :). I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I'm one of the pickiest eaters in my family, so I was glad to see a recipe that didn't call for celery or onions.

The recipe tastes great, and you can even make the meal a little healthier by substituting light mayonnaise (or light Miracle Whip) and turkey bacon.  I made the recipe with those ingredients plus a little paprike sprinkled on top and it tasted FANTASTIC!

This was a good way to change up deviled eggs.  The bacon added a great flavor.  I couldn't really taste the cheese though, and I used 3 Tbsp.  I added a little salt and pepper and also paprika.
Made this again and used 4 Tbsp of cheese and added a splash of Worchestershire Sauce and another splash of Siracha.  So fantastic!  Moved it up to 5 stars!

I've made this recipe several times for different functions and they all request it over & over. These eggs are truly eggs-trodinary! Totally different from your normal deviled eggs!
Also a nice treat for those on low card diets!

I LIKED THE ADDITION OF BACON. I USED MEXICAN STYLE CHEESE BUT I REALLY COULD NOT TASTE IT. NEXT TIME I WILL USE SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE.

These were surprisingly tasty. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because...well, it's pretty much a basic deviled egg recipe but with bacon, and adding bacon to anything is basically cheating. I've made these twice now, once with the cheese and once without. Unless you're using sharp cheddar, the cheese really doesn't add much to these. The second time around I also added a smidge of cayenne, which was a nice layer of flavor near the end. All in all, it's a good recipe.

I made these for my mother-in-law's suprise 60th birthday party and they were a huge hit! Very easy to make. To make it even simpler - I used ready-cooked bacon and just heated them in the mircowave for 45 seconds to cook them a little more. I chopped them up really fine. I added all the egg mixture to a gallon size ziplock bag and snipped off one corner. I then piped it into the cooked eggs and threw away the bag at the end for easy cleanup.

Even though I LOVE bacon and cheese I actually prefer the basic ones better.  I'm thinking the texture of the bacon threw it for me.

I mixed these up without measuring ingredients - just used what looked right to me.  I used Dijon for the mustard and added fresh minced chives.

These were a huge hit...I followed the recipe except for putting the bacon in the egg mixture I sprinkled it on top.  I made about 32 halves and needed to make way more.  Everybody kept saying is that bacon on top, I have never had bacon on deviled eggs, but why not bacon and eggs go together always.  Love it!!!

Wow best deviled eggs ever! Of course I did add more bacon and cheese than the recipe called for but I do that in all recipes. I also used real bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon to simplify. I could eat them forever :o)

I give it 4 out of 5 because I thought it could have more taste to it, BUT I'm pregnant and tend to get picky. I made a double batch(24 eggs) 8 slices of bacon, a cup of mayonnaise, then here's where I changed it up a bit...Instead of 4 tablespoons of finely shredded cheddar cheese, I mixed in 5-6 tablespoons of finely cubed mild cheddar cheese, And I mean my little cubes were tiny, besides I didn't have shredded cheddar and wasn't going to waste money buying some since I already had cheese. And lastly I added 4-6 tablespoons of mustard. It was a hit, where I took It and got many compliments.

These were really good, and a nice change from the traditional deviled egg filling. I took the advice of other reviewers and used more bacon (bacon makes everything better). I also added sour cream, this was suggested to make it smoother, so it would be easier to pipe into the eggs, but it also added a nice little bit of tartness to balance the heaviness of the rest of the ingredients.

Decided to make these for something different. I made half the way I've always made them and half this way and took these to a family reunion. Both were gobbled up. I'm sure I'll make these again at times. I think I still like my original deviled eggs a little better though.

I made these for a 2015 NYE ' S get together with friends.  Everyone loved them! I think the added bacon and cheese on top took the deviled eggs to a whole new level. I incorporated the tips of others....1/4 cup of miracle whip, 1/4 cup of sour cream, and 1 tablespoon of whipped cream cheese. Cost effective, minimum prep time, and delicious.

These are delicious!! I have made them quite a few times!  I follow the recipe exactly except I add green onions on the top.  This puts them over the edge!  My family likes them better than the traditional deviled eggs :)

I made these last week to take to a family dinner and they didn't last 10 minutes.  My niece requested them again this weekend at her baby shower, and I think they went even faster then before.  Definitely a hit.

Just made these today for my family, and they were all gone in an instant!  I used bacon bits instead of real bacon slices.  They were still just as good.  Make sure to sprinkle extra bacon on top! It gives a crunchy feel to the perfect taste.

Eggcellent! I used shredded parmesan instead of the cheddar and added a generous dollop of Cholula and a bit more mayo. Really delicious, will make again.

I've always wanted to try making these. They were a huge hit. My family loves them, even my husband whom I've never seen eat an egg unless it was scrambled or sunny side up! I left the cheese out because the dish that we were having for dinner had plenty cheese in it. Love these eggs. Very simple recipe.  :  )

I absolutely love deviled eggs and when I stumbled upon this recipe I knew it would be delicious. I followed everything to the T and it turned out great. The only thing I did differently was double the batch. The bacon makes it taste perfect.

I made these for Christmas.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream.  I made extra bacon and broke into pieces and put a piece on top with a sprinkle of cheese.  I made deviled eggs a lot and I have to say these were the best I have ever made.  I cooked the bacon in the oven on a rack to get just the right kind of crisp.  So Good!!!!

I normally use my own recipe but I decided to give this a try.  Instead of cooking the bacon on the stove top I bake it in the oven on 325F that way the bacon isn't sitting in the grease and I can save it as well.  After it's done cooking, let it sit to cool down it will be easy to crumble up.  Also I used a cheddar monterey jack cheese and Dukes mayo brand.  Turns out just perfect and everyone LOVES them]

I make ones similar to these. I get my bacon really crispy in the microwave only, let it sit for a bit then crumble with my fingers. I mix the yokes, mayo, salt, pepper, a Tbsp of Dijon mustard, 3 Tbsp of lemon juice, then I add very finely sliced green onions and some of the crumbled bacon. I then fill the egg halves and then to make them pretty, I nicely sprinkle the tops with a tiny bit of the bacon and little bit of chives. I don't put cheese in mine! These are always requested at get togethers and always a HUGE hit! I can't even get through the door and get them uncovered, I have people grabbing them out of my hands. If you try this, I hope you enjoy them as much as we always do!

This was good. I never thought of  adding bacon to devil eggs. The cheese was also a nice touch. The only thing I did differently was I added paprika on top.

I like deviled eggs, but after this I can say I love them! I made some changes though, the yolk mixture I did half mayo, 1/4 sour cream and 1/4 whipped cream cheese. Added salt and pepper to taste, used stone ground mustard. For the topping I added paprika,chives  and used jalapeño crumbled bacon. I made this for thanksgiving this year, a "warm up" before dinner and they were gone within minutes. Saved to my box . Thanks for a great recipe.

First of all I have to say that I don't cook. so whenever we have a gathering at my house my first thought is what can I thaw out or where would be the best place to get take out. I decided to try these since it looked easy enough and all I have to say is, thanks alot. Now everytime we have a gathering or go camping, I get nominated to bring the deviled eggs. They just can't get enough!

Made the recipe as is with the only modification being that I make my hard boiled eggs a bit different but that certainly doesn't change the taste.  I liked them a lot but unfortunately nobody really noticed the cheese so I may add more next time.

I made these for a family lunch and they've become my signature dish. They are requested every time we get together now. I used the Hormel real bacon pieces and chopped them up finely. I put all of the filling in a freezer bag and piped it into the eggs. Yum!

Very good, nice and savory! I tweaked it a bit by adding some dill pickles, small diced, and salt and pepper TT. That's would bring it up to 4.5 stars, I just don't know what's missing for that last .5

My husband demands we make deviled eggs via this recipe from now on. I agree! We just add a dash of Spanish smoked paprika on top before we eat ours.

I made these for a family gathering.  I loved them.  I switched up the recipe a bit, Used mirclewhip and 1 tsp of vinegar and and 1 tsp only of mustard and 1tsp of sugar.  They were gone quick and everyone wanted the recipe!  It was a nice change to the regular style deviled eggs.

I halved this recipe, just to make a snack.  Different than traditional deviled eggs, because you don't get the sour vinegar taste, but good in their own right.  The crunchy salt bacon makes them very tasty.  Next time I would put more cheddar, didn't taste the cheese.

These were pretty good, but we didnt like the texture of bacon in them. We like the smooth fillimg. If I make these again I will just sprinkle bacon on top or leave it off.

These were good, but I'm not sure they're worth the hassle of adding the bacon.  And I really couldn't taste the cheddar.  I'll most likely go back to making my regular deviled eggs.

I made these one year for easter, and they were such a hit! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really delicious. I have made it with both pre-made bacon and real bacon and the real deal is definitely the way to go, adds the good smoky flavor to each egg. Also my family likes things a little spicy so sprinkling a little cayenne pepper on top of each egg gives it an extra kick. All in all, a great recipe for holidays/parties/ or just a good snack.

I had been wanting to make deviled eggs for a while now. I tried this recipe, which was very easy to make but so tasty! My boyfriend was scared to try them & he ended up eating almost all of them & left me a couple only =) The bacon was a great addition! Thanks for the recipe, ill be making these again!!!

I made these with Easter eggs and was a little skeptical about how they might taste. The overall taste was a little bland, but that can be easily fixed with a little paprika and salt and pepper. I wil make this recipe again.

Made as the recipe called for, the egg filling was good. But to me, it lacked a little bit of sweetness. So, I added 1 tbsp of sweet green relish. Wow! They were delicious! I think with that small adjustment, this recipe is now a keeper!

I would maybe add a bit more cheddar next time, but other than that these were a wonderful change of pace. Didn't knock our socks off or anything, but we all agreed they were great for a change.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made these for Thanksgiving because I make deviled eggs every Thanksgiving. Unfortunately I only got to eat one of them (one half).  You see, I sacrificed dinner with my family to go early black Friday shopping.  I will have to make these again and maybe even next thanksgiving... Two words. Bacon.  Cheese.

i made these and I LOVED THEM!!!! I used 24 eggs instead of 12 and had more than enough filling for all of them. I added more cheddar, because... HELLO!!! Who DOESN'T love more cheese now a days, haha. When i cooked the bacon i made them crispy. i don't do the whole bacon in microwave thing. its a good thing they came out delicious because i spent a good amount of time making them. They were also going to be fed to my co-works at Lowe's and it's safe to say they LOVED them too! 
   OH! and this was the first time i ever made deviled eggs :)

My husband described these as heavenly and heavenly they were! I think these might be the best deviled eggs I've ever had! I added green onions and sprinkled a little paprika on the top of them. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I am a huge deviled egg fan, and these were very different - I did need to doctor them up quite a bit. I used some salt, minced white onion, tabasco, and sprinkled in some dry parsley. The cheese flavor was not very strong, so I changed things up a little more by adding sharp cheddar cheese (about 1/4 cup) using a box grater and folded it into the mixture. The mixture is a bit stiff & chunky, so I used a teaspoon sized scoop, that I normally use for cookie dough, to fill the egg whites. I let them chill in the fridge for a couple of hours and dusted the eggs with smoked paprika before serving.

guess it comes down to whether you are using a bacon you love and a cheese you love. made this exactly as written using medium cheddar tillamook shredded and the bacon from costco that comes already cooked and crumbled. everyone was polite about these.. said um, yes, they were okay but no one really ate them tho :(  two days later I chopped it all up, added some green onion, relish, chopped olives, s&p and made a sandwich filling.. which was inhaled.. lol . ... so.. there you go. It is true and a good tip that if you use eggs that you have bought a few days ahead to boil, they are SO much easier to peel.

That's no way to boil an egg.  Boil you eggs at least 5 minutes then cool in cold water.  They peel much easier.

I followed this recipe perfectly and it turned out fantastic. There were 3 choices of deviled eggs to choose from at a christmas party and these eggs went first.  I agree with the other reviews...the cheese(used mild cheddar) didn't seem to add a lot of flavor so I may skip it next time or try sharp.

Five star recipe!  Made exactly as indicated, except I also mixed in a tsp or two of the warm bacon grease to the yolk mixture for added flavor.  Hey, if you're going to eat egg yolks, you might as well go all the way right? Also used full-fat, regular Hellman's mayo and full-fat cheese.  Major hit at the party.

These were good.  Definitely a nice break from  the traditional method.  We liked them, don't get me wrong, but they didn't blow us away.  Even our guests reactions were a bit blah.  Even discussed at the party.  For me, the reviews on here gave me higher expectations.  For my guests, they heard the ingredients and just expected to like it more.  I don't know...I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm going to try it again another time and see if I can adjust it a little. Thank you for sharing.

I have made these three times already. They are tasty as heck. I love the crunchy bits of bacon so much. I don't even want to make regular deviled eggs anymore! Just to make the filling a little looser, I added a little splash of white vinegar.

So yummy.  I made them for Easter brunch.  They were a HUGE hit and I find myself craving them now.  I made them exactly how the recipe suggested except I bought the Oscar Myer real back pieces instead of cooking my own to save time.  It worked well.  I will try it in the future with bacon I cook when I have a little more time.

This was excellent as-is, and fabulous with a few touches.  I added 1 tsp onion powder (would have been better with finely chopped green onion, alas, had none!) 1 tsp cooled bacon grease, two spoonfuls hot sauce and extra cheddar.  I sprinkled chili powder over the top for color and a tiny bit more zip.  Took this to the picky in-laws for Easter and they loved it!  PS. Any extra filling is extremely tasty on crackers.

These were really tasty!  We used dijon mustard, and added green onion for a bit of color and added flavor.  Our guests were thrilled!

The best deviled eggs I've ever had. My only advice is to throw a little paprika on top.

I give this recipe a 4 and the ones I made a 3. Living in Japan our bacon is different and doesn't crisp up so I used bacon bits like another reviewer suggested. Everyone loved them. The guy who doesn't like deviled eggs even said they were tolerable. hah. If you use bacon bits and you plan to pipe them I suggest you crush up the bacon bits as fine as possible

These are fantastic! I don't like deviled eggs myself, but made these thinking my boyfriend would love the cheese and bacon in them. I was right! He, and everyone else loves these, I make them any time we have a get together.  After cooking the bacon, I put them in a food processor so that the pieces are pretty small. I also add more cheese than the recipe calls for. I just throw in a handful or 2. Then I use a piping bag to put the mix in the eggs, and sprinkle with paprika!

Excellent.  I brought these to an Easter dinner, and loved them! Didn't know whether "mustard" meant prepared mustard or mustard powder, so I used yellow mustard, and they turned out perfect. Since the crumbled bacon gives the filling a few lumps, I wouldn't bother piping it into the eggs with a pastry bag and a fancy tip (which would create the pretty swirls you see in the picture).  I used a 1-gallon Ziploc bag and cut off the corner.

I love these eggs, but only give 4 stars, because I did make some changes.  First, I used pre-cooked bacon crumbles (NOT BACOS, but real bacon).  I think this helped with the crunch factor that turned off some other reviewers, plus it saved on time.  Second, I added about 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder and a little more mustard than called for.  These were a hit with my moms group!

To make it easier, I used bacon bits in place of the bacon.  I also made half of the recipe w/o bacon to make it more vegetarian friendly.   I made these for a holiday party, and they were a hit!

I've made these twice in two weeks....everyone devoured them!  As other reviewers suggested, I added a couple drops of tobasco sauce for taste, and a spoonful of sour cream for smoothness.  They were prefect.  My only problem was that like the picture, I like to use my cake decorator and pipe the egg mixture in, but the bacon has to be TINY to fit through without clogging.  So make sure you crumble your bacon as much as possible.

I really enjoyed this recipe :)  I added more cheese (freshly grated & ground in food processor), minced fresh chives, a few teaspoons of horseradish (it was bland without it) and a few teaspoons of sour cream (to make filling more creamy).  Whipped up beautifully in the mixer.  Best served to foodies.  People who insist that their mom's deviled eggs are THE BEST IN THE WORLD will likely not be won over by these.... at least that was my experience.  LOL.

My son made these once for a party and now everyone wants him to bring them every time! The most interesting part - many times people that swear they don't like deviled eggs will take 2-3 of these! He also add a little sour cream to make it smoother. And, for decorating purposes, He put the yolk mixture into a bag, cut the corner off and pipe it into the eggs! than sprinkle it all with slices of green onion! Not bad at all. He bend call a Semi-Experienced "Sous Chef" We fought over the last one. These are definetly making an appearance for my next holiday dinner. I've too made this deviled egg recipe many times now and every single time it turns out fantastic. This is also just as good with turkey bacon or prepackaged bacon bits and I've found that this is wonderful with just about any cheese, especially white cheddar cheese or pepper jack. I like to add a little hot sauce to the filling as I'm mixing it, too. I didn't know if I was supposed to use power mustard or yellow mustard, I used the yellow mustard and it worked great and added color.

This is the greatest.  What a zip to ordinary Deviled eggs.  I used it again to make egg salad exactly the same way, just using the whole egg chopped up.  What a sandwich with a little slice of avocado on it.

I have made this many times and I always get asked to make them again.  Follow the recipe to a T except I think I throw in a lil extra bacon and cheese.  I then sprinkle the tops with Slap Yo Mama (cajun seasoning). Big hit.

My husband and I love these deviled eggs! I've made them for Super Bowl parties and birthday parties. Never have any leftovers to have to take home. One trick I have is to always have a package of cooked bacon in my freezer. Just microwave the amount of pieces you need to really crisp them up for recipes like this one. Saves a lot of time in the kitchen. Just followed the direction on the bacon package. Will make again and again!!

Nice twist for a deviled egg. Glad they didn't add pickle relish like some, kills the taste of the egg. I usually sprinkle top w/ a little paprika for color. & like Dijon mustard w/horseradish.

This is a great recipe. However, your video showing how to make these is odd. If you mash the egg yolks with the fork BEFORE you add the rest of the ingredients, it would be much, much easier. Also why use a spoon to get the yolk out of the white? Just give it a gentle squeeze and it will pop right out. Just saying.

These were pretty good, a nice change from the norm. My family liked them, but said they prefer the basic deviled eggs. If I make them again I may try shredded pepper jack cheese instead to spice it up a little.

These are by far the most incredible deviled eggs I've EVER made ! I did use more bacon than called for and I didn't have cheddar cheese (used Pepperjack) but they tasted so good I will make them again...and again...and again !!

Made exactly as written.  They were a hit.  Perhaps a 'tad' salty b/c of the bacon and chedder (so be sure not to add salt).

These deviled eggs are the best I've ever made! Everyone loved them. The only thing I changed was the bacon. I used Bacon Bits instead of cooking pieces of bacon. It was easier and it tasted great. Awesome recipe, will definitely make them again!

I used about 6 strips of bacon and a fair handful of shredded cheese.  I added a bit of extra mayo and I used honey mustard instead of regular mustard.  These were good.  Even my husband who isn't a big fan of deviled eggs ate 3 or 4 of them.  Thank you for sharing!

Made these for Easter and they were delicious!  My family loved them.  I did add chives on top, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday.  The ingredients sounded good together but for me it lacked the zing of typical deviled eggs. I really wanted to like it but I really didn't.  However others like it; hence the 3 stars.  Thanks USERMILEY3260.

Made exactly per recipe.  They were good.  Not as exceptional as the spinach-bacon and the balsalmic-bacon ones from this site though, so 4 stars for good.

Delicious! Will get low sodium bacon next time because it was a little salty. Refrigerating for an hour made a huge difference for texture and taste. Will make this recipe regularly

Fantastic.  First time I made deviled eggs.  Everyone loved them.  But there has to be an easier way to remove the shells...

Second time I added a Tablespoon of horseradish.  WOW!

These eggs are awesome! I don't add the mustard, simply because I don't like it in my eggs but without it they are crazy good.

Very good! I've made this recipe several times, and get rave reviews each time that I make them. I make them exactly as the recipe states, except for the bacon - instead of cooking bacon, I use the store bought Real Bacon crumbles. Delish!

These were so easy to make! The recipe was modified as turkey bacon, fat-free cheddar and light mayonnaise were all used. I could hardly taste the cheddar cheese so next time I am going to double the amount. They tasted yummy with the bits of bacon in the filling!

What a tasty Thanksgiving treat! I prepared this without the cheddar -- and used applewood smoked bacon. Yumm! My only bad move was adding a dash of salt...not necessary due to the bacon. Quick and easy to prepare. Also, if you're going to pipe this with a pastry bag, be sure to use a wide tip that can accommodate those little bacon nuggets!

I typically don't care for deviled eggs, but I really like this recipe. I love that it called for bacon! I added some extra cheese and some salt and pepper. I also used dry mustard instead because I didn't have prepared mustard.

This recipe is really easy to make, doesn't require a lot of ingredients, and the end result is delicious!!  I literally just finished making them and I ate 3 before even taking them to the party!  I used dijon mustard and added a tablespoon of the bacon fat to my mixture.  Perfect.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I didn't think a little cheese and bacon would make that big of a difference but it did.  I LOVE plain old deviled eggs but these really were an improvement.

I was looking for a deviled egg with more of a breakfast twist for a brunch and decided to try this one.  It was a big hit! I think next time I may try one more slice of bacon and a little more cheese, but even as is, the recipe is delicious!  I will certainly make this again.

Egg-mazing!  I never tasted or made deviled egg before but wanted to add something traditional to our Easter dinner.  I couldn't have made a better selection.   I used turkey bacon (some guests didn't eat pork).  This has made us deviled egg fans!  Most complained that I didn't make enough.

I use recipes from this site all the time and really should pay tribute. These were very tasty! I made them for Easter and everyone loved them especially my boy's (husband 36 and teenager 16). They love bacon so that is what originally attracted me to this. I have never made deviled eggs before, found out the hardest part was peeling the eggs. I've made hard boiled eggs before, so I'm not sure why these were the most difficult eggs to peel and some were not included due to appearance. If I can overcome the peeling, I will make again.

I tweaked this a bit,but I boiled the eggs like you normally would,and I used the same ingredients,but I put seven slices of bacon,instead of four,and I bought pre cooked bacon and microwaved it for two minutes,and I added 3/4 a cup of cheese,and because that made it too thick,I added mayo and mustard until it was thr right consistency.If you use the amount of bacon and vheese the recipe says to do,you can hardly taste it.I made them today for easter,and everyone loved them.

My husband said he didn't know deviled eggs could get any better, till he tried these.  Easy to make!  I added some pepper and sprinkled with smokey paprika when all done.

I made this recipe for my husband and his office this week for their potluck. Everyone loved them and said they were outstanding! I made them just like the recipe said, but next time I think I will add some green onions. I think it's the only thing that could possibly make them better. Thank you allrecipes!

I made this last week for brunch after an Easter Egg Hunt! Wonderful! Made exactly as is, and got rave reviews. One of the dads came up to me and said, "Did you put bacon in the deviled eggs, I LOVE YOU!"

This is a 5 star recipe for me! I mixed it up exactly as directed but also added chopped green onion and lots of pepper. To further extend it I chopped up one of the egg whites really fine. This way my husband has his devilled eggs and I have my egg salad filling for a sandwich. My husband thought this was the best devilled eggs he's ever had.

I will not go back to my old way of making deviled eggs again!  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, and used Real bacon bits crushed finer like in one of the reviews mentioned.  I couldn't believe how fast they went, and the compliments that I received.  I can't wait to try this receipe again with some of the other ingredients that were mentioned from other reviews.  Great receipe-Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Pretty basic and easy to prepare.  The addition of the bacon made it awesome but then again bacon has that affect.  Next time I am going to try low fat mayo and cheese to see if it makes a difference.

These lil' devils were amazing!  I brought them to a baby shower and they were gone instantly.  Someone even complained because I only made a dozen!  Next time, I will double the recipe :) - oh and I did add a little bit of sour cream to smooth the texture and added a tiny bit of minced onion...YUM!!!

Best Deviled eggs ever! I added lots of extra bacon and put in some of the "adds" that others reviewers did and put the mixture into a large Zip lock bag. Squeezed all the air out and then cut a pencil sized whole in the corner and used it to "pipe" the mixture into the egg halves. And just like a kid, just squeezed the left  over in the bag into my mouth!! So tasty! This will be my go to recipe for now on if I'm not in a time squeeze.***UPDATE 5/28/11***Made these again for a Roller Derby Tail-gate party. I used real bacon bits that come in the jar. I liked the texture of these better than the thick sliced that I keep on hand. I did cook up 4-5 slices of bacon though. I used about 2 teaspoons of drippings with the little "cracklins" that was left behind for a wonderful bacon taste. Also, I left out the cheese until I had the mixture in the egg halves. I then put a "pinch" of grated cheese on top of each egg (looked like a "haystack") with a sliver of the pan cooked bacon stuck in the egg mixture. Looked rather fancy to look at! Tasted better than last time! Only regret.... Can't give it anymore STARS!!

I added a bit of relish to the receipe and it was perfect. A wonderful balance btwn the sweetness of the relish and saltiness of the bacon.

A+ I made these for Easter and absolutely everyone loved them, including my 4 year old who never eats deviled eggs. My only complaint is that you can't really taste the cheese at all, and I even put more in than the recipe called for. Other than that, they were terrific and I will definitely be making these again. Thanks much!

These are AWESOME eggs. I 1/2 the recipe and now regret doing so! Even our 5 yr old and 19 year old who dont like anything liked them and I had to give our 5 yr. old one of my eggs. Like I said I 1/2 the recipe but used the 4 slices of bacon cuz well we love bacon. I also put 1/8 c. of ground onion. It was a perfect combo like I thought it would be. These are even better then our family traditional eggs I am always requested to make. Thanks soooooooo much for this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!! A new member of our family.

Only 4 because I changed the recipe.  Used about a teaspoon of dry mustard, no mustard and a dash of celery salt and white pepper.  They were gone in minutes and everyone wanted the recipe.  5 stars

I added an extra 2 slices of bacon, a little more mayo, and doubled the cheese.  I garnished with extra cheddar and chopped green onions.  Very good.  Certainly a keeper.

Nice variation from my usual deviled eggs. My husband almost spit it out thinking the crunchy bacon was egg shell so make sure you tell people ahead of time.

I made these for Thanksgiving for my family. They were HANDS DOWN the best deviled eggs me and my family have ever had!! My mother took the recipe and is planning on making hers this way from now on!! What a hit!! I modified the recipe a bit - 8 slices of bacon, 1.5 tbsp mustard and probably about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. They were AWESOME!! =)

I've used this recipe almost 10 times in the past year and everyone has loved it.  Bacon makes EVERYTHING better.

My husband has declared these "the best deviled eggs ever" I could probably serve these for dinner w/ nothing else and he would be happy. I followed the directions exactly.

These are soooooo good!  I normally use honey mustard instead of regular mustard.

Great. We throw about 10 parties a year and this is one of the best moving snacks, and if we dont make them I always get asked "where are the deviled eggs?". UMMMM, is there anything bacon can't do? Hold the phone, two words, horseradish mustard. holy  you can make them taste even better,wow, try it I think you will enjoy.

Made these for a get-together this past weekend and they were gobbled up in 2 minutes flat!  I used bacon bits instead of frying up the bacon myself to save time and effort and no one noticed the difference. I'll definitely be making these again.

Eggs and bacon together, then add cheese, you can't miss!! I made these for Easter last year and my kids raved about them. A little trick is to add just a little sour cream to the mayo if you want a little extra creamy flavor. And for a festive look sprinkle with paprika or chili powder.   I will  make my deviled eggs this way from now on. They're great!

I made four types of deviled eggs. Everyone thought they were okay, my daughter really loved them. Other people could not get used to the bacon crunch in their eggs.

These are fabulous deviled eggs! My one complaint is that I couldn't use a star tip to fill these all prettily as the bacon & cheese clogged it up. Oh well, taste before beauty. LOL Thansk UserEmily3260!

What a delicious twist! I used an overflowing 1/4 cup of reduced fat mayo, added in onion powder and white pepper. I used the pre-cooked bacon pieces from the pouch for ease and sprinkled with paprika for garnish. Thanks!

These were really good...it's the bacon that really adds flavor to these eggs. Feel free to omit cheese if it's not on hand because as many other reviewers noted...you can't really taste it.

This is a great recipe. My husband loved it too. I think maybe a few drops of tobasco or something might give it just a little kick that I thought it was missing. Very nice idea mixing the bacon in. I really couldn't taste the cheese with the rest of the flavors, but still loved the recipe! Thanks!

when I make these I up the bacon to 6 slices (I usually use pre-cooked bacon because it is easier),I leave out the mustard and use sharp cheddar cheese instead so it still has a zing to it. I am requested to bring these to every party I go to.

This recipe was pretty good as is. I've made it twice, now. The first time, I used ground mustard because I love the kick. I found the lack of vinegar to be a little underwhelming, so the second time I used regular prepared mustard, half sour cream and half mayonnaise, and threw in some green onion for more color. I then dusted the top with some chives, a little extra bacon, and paprika... AMAZING! I'll definitely make this one again.

Okay as written, but I like it better with these measurements: 1.5 teaspoons of vinegar, adding 1/2 cup of cheddar, 3/4 cup mayo, 3 tablespoons of mustard, 2 tablespoons sour cream (it makes it smoother;) and only topping them with the bacon, not putting it in with the mixture. I do not pipe them into the eggs as it really is an unnecessary step.. spooning it in works just fine! Next time I think I might at some cayenne as well :)

I've made this recipe several times because it's always requested! I use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sourcream, as it makes it a bit smoother along with a little brown spicy mustard. I also top with a sprinkle of paprika. Very delicious!

I love deviled eggs usually - although I've had a few at family gatherings that I wish I'd passed on.  Anyway, I had an abundance of eggs and decided to give these a try.  I don't go for low fat mayo or cheese so I used the "real" stuff.  I reduced the recipe to serve 6. I thought it needed a bit more zing so I added about another half teaspoon of yellow mustard plus a pinch of salt.  I mixed the mustard, eggs, and cheese with my hand mixer so it was nice and smooth before adding in the finely crumbled bacon. I topped them off with a sprinkle of smoked paprika.  These are pretty good, but I will admit that the bacon adds a texture to them that just feels a little wrong to me.  But they taste great.

Yummy!  I increased the amount of cheddar and mustard.  I also use MorningStar bacon strips (soy) to keep it vegetarian and to avoid buying an entire package of bacon that I'll never finish using.  The flavors do need to meld in the refrigerator for a little while, but make sure to take them out for a bit before serving; they are more flavorful when they warm up a bit.

This is probably the best deviled egg recipe I've tried and I would rate it higher but I thought the eggs could be a little creamier some how.  If I could have the same flavor but a creamier texture it would get 5 stars from me.  It doesn't give me the option but I would give it 4.5 stars as written.

I made these and original/reg deviled eggs for Easter and everyone eat the reg ones first. I would say they were ok and I don't think I would make them again. Easy and simple to make. Follow the recipe.

I thought these were okay. I decided to test a few eggs, because I had some leftover bacon. I can't see me making bacon just for deviled eggs. I am a purist when it comes to the deviled egg. The bacon was a little chewy and I couldn't taste the cheese. I ended up adding a little more mayo, as it was kind of thick, and some salt and pepper. I am certain, though, they will all eaten. ty

Husband loved this! I knew he would love it since it has cheese and bacon in it. I enjoyed it as well but I still prefer my deviled eggs to have relish in them. I could easily add it to this recipe next time and see but I did not have any on hand this time. This was a great recipe to use all the eggs we had dyed for Easter! Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious. Deviled eggs are usually too sweet with all of the mayo, the bacon not only added an awesome texture.. But also an incredible flavor. I technically used 6 slices of bacon, spicy mustard, added minced garlic, and added a small dash of both Texas Pete and worcestershire sauce. Great recipe!

Perfectly simple, perfectly delicious. This from a someone who isn't a fan of the typical deviled egg. These are far from typical. Top with a few slices of the green part of the scallion for color and a little extra flavor.

I made this (without the cheese since I didn't have any) and tried it and thought "no, not good at all".  After filling all the eggs and refrigerating for a couple of hours I tried another one - WOW, what a difference.  They were delicious after chilling and allowing the flavors to meddle.  I did use a tablespoon of sour cream in with the mayo.  I will make these again, Thanks.

very tasty. I did add about 1 tablespoon of sour cream for a tad creamier mixture, then put in a zip lock baggy, cut off corner and piped in the mixture onto the egg.  very good, definitely a keeper.

Just made this recipe for Sunday football for the boys! I followed the recipe exactly except I added a dalop of sour cream and I substituted the bacon for real bacon bits (the soft chewy kind.) Also, I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to each egg afterwards and they turned out delicious! My boyfriend ate the left over filling and ate all the eggs in minutes. Definitely going to make these again!

These were very yummy. I didn't measure the mayo as I put in to taste. I also added mustard as mustard is a key ingredient in my other deviled eggs. All in all, I will make again :-)

Delicious! Tried this recipe for the first time for a family function and it was great.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used Real Bacon Bits (instead of cooked bacon) and It was a little on the salty side.  Next time I will use less bacon bits but otherwise this was tasty!

Yes, I did!  I made it over the Easter Weekend and sorry to say I kept licking my fingers in between filling the egg whites.  Of course, I rinsed after each finger licking.  I will be making them again tomorrow for a baby shower for my manager on Monday. They refrigerate well, up to three days. Thx SmilieAnnie

I brought this to have as an appetizer at Thanksgiving and they were gone in minutes.  Since deviled eggs are hard to transport without a tray designed for eggs, I cut the eggs in half, made the egg mixture and placed it in a pastry bag.  When I got to the dinner, I simply piped the mixture into the egg white half shells and it worked great!  Thank you for the recipe!!!!

The first time I made these, they were a huge hit!  The only downside is that you will be asked to make them time and time again.  They are delicious!

I made this for a "bacon mania" potluck today and all 24 bacon cheddar deviled eggs were gone in seconds!  I followed the recipe exactly the way was directed, even ran the eggs in cold water for faster cooling.  The time consuming part for me was peeling he shells off the eggs.  I will definitely be making these more often for potlucks :)

wow, I have to say that I prepared this recipe for my daughters birthday party and everyone is now asking me to make them for their activity, this was easy to prepared and soooo good, and to add I do not like mustard, but you can't even taste the mustard in there, sooo is great I love it, and this is a keeper for sure :)

A great twist on the traditional deviled egg.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and also used dry mustard and not the condiment mustard.  I chopped up some chives for garnish as well.  These were a huge hit.  These will be the go to recipe from now on.

Just made these tonight. They were amazing! I didn't measure the Mayo or mustard "exactly" and I'm pretty sure I put more Mayo than it called for. Still this is a great recipe. Oh I also added lots of fresh ground black pepper.

Delicious! I've made these several times and the key to taking them from great to outstanding, is: 1. double the bacon and 2. use Horseradish Cheddar.  Keep everything else the same.  HUGE hit every easter. I, unfortunately, never have any leftovers.

Absolutely delicious!!! I always add bacon & cheddar to my deviled eggs now. I get rave reviews everytime I bring them to a function. I sprinkle a bit of scallions on top for a little added flavor, color & texture.

My very first time ever making deviled eggs. Brought them in to the office so they could be my guinea pigs, and everyone liked them a lot! They all wanted more, despite the fact that the ones I made were not very pretty due to my inexperience, but everyone was won over by the taste. Delicious!

I made and took to a party.  It was gone in few minutes.  I used low fat mayonnaise low fat cheddar cheese, but tasted very sour.  Maybe I should have used regular ones.

Yum! These turned out great and everyone loved them. I used jumbo eggs so I added a little more of the other ingredients. Piping was challenging because of the bacon.

Amazing. Made this recipe as directed but without the cheese for my daughters birthday party and they were gone before I ever even got one. The bacon gives deviled eggs something they have always been missing...

OK.  I prefer something with a little sweet to it.  I've never had a deviled egg and thought it tasted like breakfast, but this tastes like a bite of scrambled eggs, and scrambled eggs are less time consuming to make.

I'm always amazed at how quickly these deviled eggs disappear -- and I double the recipe! Anything with bacon is sure to be a hit. Deviled eggs are not my favorite thing to make, but people keep requesting them, so it looks like it's "my thing to bring" now. I don't add mustard, because my husband doesn't like it, I sprinkle paprika on top.  I have used maple bacon a couple times and someone said it was like eating a McMuffin in a single bite.

After making these, I was told that I am no longer allowed to make any other deviled egg recipe.  My husband and daughter think that bacon should be its own food group, so they thought they were in heaven after eating these.  Even my son, who normally won't eat bacon when I make it, but loves deviled eggs, ate 4 of these.

I thought this was delicious! I actually added 6 slices of bacon to give it a very distinctive bacon-y flavor. Then I added a small amount of finely shredded onion and a little bit of white wine vinegar. Absolutely yummy! I made them for my daughters second birthday party, and all of the adults AND kids devoured them. Next time I think I'm going to sprinkle the tops with finely chopped tomato and serve the each egg half in a leaf of endive for a twist on a BLT. Mmmmmm....

These were awesome! Everybody loved them! We used Miracle Whip instead of mayonaise and a freezer bag with a hole in the corner to allocate the mixture, as we don't have a piping bag. If you have any spare mixture left over, it would taste great on a sandwich with lettuce! Will definitely make these again.

My husband used to rave about his stepmom's deviled eggs until I made this for Easter. The whole family loved it. I personally like the crunch of bacon and the subtle cheesy taste. This recipe is definitely a keeper and my husband will now think about me instead of his stepmom when someone mentions deviled eggs!

Definitely prefer the traditional deviled eggs.  I think sometimes when you add bacon to something it takes on too much of the bacon flavor and that's what happened with these.

My girlfriend
 and I were assigned to bring deviled eggs to an annual Easter picnic.  We ran into a few issues with the eggs while making them...the shells and yolks did not want to part company very easily from the egg whites, so we were a bit concerned as to how they would taste.  To our surprise, everyone, including the family matriarch who has always brought them in the past, was completely WOWED by this kicked up version of deviled eggs!!  We are now permanently assigned to bring this dish to future picnics!

I thought these sounded so good and a nice twist on deviled eggs. Made for Easter but my family did not like them at all. I ended throwing them away. The cheese did not do it for us. They didn't like the bacon either. I will go back to traditional plain deviled eggs.

I kinda liked them, but nobody in my family really cared for them. I am glad I tried the recipe before making them for company. We are used to having deviled eggs with the liver/mayo/mustard and spices filling and we found this recipe does not come anywhere close to the yummy taste of our regular recipe. The bacon/cheddar version tasted a bit too heavy/fatty and the bacon taste was too strong... We like them lighter and a bit more flavor adjusted -- But I guess it's a matter of taste... so... I'll just stick to my own recipe for now.

These were a real different twist to my traditional deviled eggs, but I did enjoy them quite a bit!  Of course I had to add a bit more Bacon, and grated cheese.  Try it you'll enjoy it!

Absolutely the best deviled eggs I have EVER had. I added a few dashes of Tabasco to it and it was superb. If you use a bag to fill the eggs, I would recommend putting the crumbled bacon and cheese on top of the egg mixture AFTER you fill the eggs, otherwise, it clogs the opening.

I loved this recipe, but couldn't help myself from augmenting it.  I added a heaping tablespoon of my homemade red pepper jelly, and minced the bacond and shredded cheddar cheese VERY finely.  The egg mix went through a large star tip just fine, and I had to hide the eggs from my husband (I was making them for a baby shower).

So good! Just the right amount of bacon flavor. I did add just a pinch of onion powder based on another review.

Fantastic!  Received lots of compliments.  I Used 8 eggs but kept the rest of the measurements the same.  Couldn't really taste the cheese and I used extra sharp.  I don't think it was really necessary.  The bacon is what makes these so good.

These were wonderful! Definately a new favorite for our family. The mustard ratio was perfect; may try a hot and spicy mustard to give it a kick. We did add extra cheese and bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

yum these were some good and definitely not ordinary deviled eggs.  My hubby, who hates deviled eggs, loved these!  I do have to say I added more bacon and cheese.  Next time to give it more zip I may add miracle whip instead of mayo.  Thanks for the recipe, Im sure I will make again!

I personally did not care for these, but they were a hit with my guests. Added cheese, but like other reviewers, could not taste it. I'll probably make these again -- I just won't eat them. I guess I prefer the plain old deviled eggs. Regardless, thanks for the recipe!

Made this for the first time this past New Year's Eve and everyone loved it!! I still put some paprika on the top to make it look pretty! Also, I put the mixture inside a small ziploc baggy and got the air out before I closed it and then cut one of the bottom corners out so that i could easily squeeze it right into the eggs! Works great! :)   Also, if you really want it to taste more like bacon cheddar then you need to add more cheese and bacon.  So easy to make and so yummy!!

Thanks, Emily, for this recipe. The eggs are delicious...and I hope to keep them around long enough to take them to the New Year's Eve party tonight! They seem to be a little shy on the cheddar flavor (perhaps using a sharp cheddar might be just the extra zing that's needed), but still outstanding.

These were a nice change from the standard deviled egg recipe and were very well received.  I took the advice of another reviewer and also added some sour cream.  Also used a piping bag for neater presentation.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are absolutely Delicious!!! A must for all those Deviled Egg/ Bacon lovers, what a perfect combo. Perfect with ingredients listed, however if you prefer to add a little something more here and there it should be fabulous as well.

I just made these for a Christmas party using real bacon bacon bits and shredded Mexican cheese and I think they are the best deviled eggs Ive ever made. My husband ate two befor I could get them wrapped up, then I had one. This is a great recipe!!

These were WONDERFUL!  I was rather skeptical at first, simply because the "ingredients" were pretty different from how my grandmother made deviled eggs, BUT they were SUCH a hit!  I received so many compliments and will definitely be making these again.  I used Bacos instead of real bacon to save time, and they were great!  Also, added a little more mustard and mayo to taste.  LOVED THESE!

best deviled eggs I have tasted in a long while. I've tried different recipes, but my family complained about how salty they always were. They believed it to be either because there were too much cheese or too much bacon, both which contributed to the salty taste. This recipe balances the taste, perhaps because there's a little more mayo...? *shrugs* I don't really care because it tastes GREAT. Thanks for the recipe!

I have never liked deviled eggs, but these were fantastic!  I doubled the first batch, which gave me an abundance of filling and the mustard was a bit overwhelming. If you're using a decorating tip, get the bacon pieces very small or it will clog the tip, even a large one.  The second time I made a single batch and used heaping Tablespoons of cheese to try and find the cheddar flavor - not a very cheesy taste if that's what you're hoping for and didn't worry about getting a full Tablespoon of mustard.  I added a Tbsp of sour cream and the texture was great. Recipe is easily adjusted to your taste.

This really was a great basis for a recipe.  The things I changed based on other reviews were this: I used Hormel finely shredded real bacon bits - I added frozen and thawed finley chopped white onions (frozen then thawed is softer versus the crispy fresh cut onions)- couple pours of hot sauce - finely shredded mexican blend cheese - spoonful of sour cream.  OMG... I can't stop licking the bowl.  My only regret is I didn't double the recipe.

These are awsome, I make a few changes myself and instead of mayonaise I use miracle whip which gives it a better flavor and instead of regular mustard the honey mustard tastes better with the bacon.

These are a very nice spin on the traditional deviled egg.  I really enjoyed them.  I couldn't eat more than a couple at a time because they were pretty rich.  I plan to take these to family functions.

I must say I never give a recipe less than 3 stars because I think if it is edible....it deserves three stars. This was edible, BUT not tasty at all. Just my opinion but I like my original recipe better.

My husband has really never had homemade deviled eggs and i wanted to make it for him and i saw this recipe with bacon...and i have to admit we love bacon. So i tried it and it was great, it was just a little to salty for my taste because of the bacon but my husband loved them.

These were great! I took the advise of others and used bacon bits instead of bacaon and also used pre shredded cheese that I already had.  My hussband loves devield eggs and he loved these.

WOW!  I made these for my niece's wedding reception and they were the first food item to disappear!  I overheard people asking others if they had tried the deviled eggs and that they were a must!  Several comments about never thinking about adding bacon and how much flavor it added!  I also put a bit of fresh chopped chives & a dash of pakrika in the mix.

I made these according to directions and it was interesting -- the people who didn't like traditional deviled eggs loved them, and those of us who love the original thought this new version was okay, but weren't that crazy about it. I think the deviled egg purists were thrown by the texture -- chunkier, rather than smooth, and the fact that the flavor was more bacony than eggy. This recipe would definitely be worth trying-- the flavor is good, and it's an interesting twist -- but I probably won't make it for my family again.

Simply delicious!!  Fyi, I've prepared this dish as an appetizer for supper on at least 5 occasions and it's an absolute winner. I've made a few alterations including replacing greasy bacon with crumbled bacon.  Further, after tasting this wonderful recipe for the first time, I haven't included mustard since as part of the mixture and rest assured, the eggs taste much better.  I'll definitely make this recipe for house parties!!

Almost perfect recipe, except...!!  Add hickory smoke flavoring (liquid smoke, found in seasonings isle) and a couple dashes of tabasco and you have deviled eggs that no one will EVER forget.  The hickory smoke flavor is KEY.  Add it to this recipe and you will not go wrong!

Very easy to make.  I will reduce the mustard next time to 1/2 tsp. as I believe it had too much of a "mustardy" taste.  I used turkey bacon, as suggested by another post, but will use regular bacon next time.  I piped it through a hole in a baggie, which made it easy.

I'm a complete amateur to cooking.  Honestly, I'm hopeless preparing any foods that require heat and or fire.  Deviled eggs have always been a favorite of mine, and until now I assumed that their preparation required the "magics".  That in mind, this recipe was wonderfully simple to follow, and the results left my roommates wanting more.  Never had deviled eggs with bacon before, and now I don't think I can ever have it without.  I also used a dijon mustard instead of regular mustard, which really gave another nice kick.  It wasn't only until much after that I realized I had forgotten the cheddar cheese altogether, which I will include the next time, along with a bit of paprika.  Can't wait to make these again!

Did not care for this one. It isnt that it was bad, it just wasnt for me.
It was kind of greasy (even tho I used the precooked bacon) and very salty! No one else seemed to be over the top about them, I ended up throwing away about 1/3.

These are awesome! My brother and I normally NEVER eat deviled eggs, but these smelled so good when I was making them that I tried one, then convinced him to try one too. For some reason, my husband and parents (who eat traditional eggs) didn't like them as much, but I'll just chalk that up to craziness.  I plan on making these wonderful deviled eggs again and again.

These are absolutely awesome!  They disappear every time.  I like to add a dash or hot sauce or horseradish if "heat" lovers will be in the crowd.  I've never had leftovers when I've made these.

These  were  absolutely delicious and were gobbled up so fast that I will have to make them again.  My hubby called them tasty little morsels and my son who normally hates deviled eggs was eating them.  The only modification I made to the recipe was instead of 1/2 c mayo, I did 1/4 c mayo and 1/4 c sour cream.

I'm a first-time deviled egg maker. I boiled the eggs the day before I made this and left them in the fridge. Big mistake. They were impossible to peel as I didn't understand about the skin drying out, etc. Next time I will boil the eggs right before I use them. It's important to keep a little distance between the shell and the skin, I learned. As I needed to cook new eggs, I followed another method of adding the eggs to boiling water (instead of putting them on the stove in cold water), then turning the boil down until gentle bubbles only flow up (no roil) and let simmer for 13 minutes. Then I  scooped them into an ice bath for 5 minutes. They peeled so easily. I left the waiting, unpeeled eggs in the cold water as I peeled. Next, after reading a review of someone who was not a fan of the bacon texture, I threw the bacon bits into the Vitamix so that they literally became crumbs and helped keep the filling smoother.  I chopped the shredded cheddar some more with a knife as well. After filling the eggs, I felt like I should've added the full amount of mustard. I was afraid to overwhelm the other flavors with the mustard. So I sprinkled ground mustard over the finished eggs along with some bacon crumbs. The taste of these eggs is so pleasing that I used the same ingredients to make egg salad with my ruined eggs. I'll make this again. I learned a lot!

Great recipe. I used Miracle Whip and it made the flavor a little sweeter. My family really enjoyed it.

I love deviled eggs but never tried to make them before.  So when I came across this simple recipe I thought I'd give it a shot.  I used Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard instead of regular mustard for an extra kick.  Also I added about a TSP of salt.  The spicy mustard really brought out the flavor IMHO.  One thing I would do different next time would be to cook the bacon on the stove.  Bacon cooked in the microwave is a little chewy.  Crispy bacon bits would make these deviled eggs even better.

This recipe is the best I've ever had, and I'm not really a fan of deviled eggs. I'll eat them, but they aren't..... "special" to me.  On this recipe, I have made it with the original ingredients YUMMY, and I have also tried it with shredded Romano cheese (I had some left over) instead of cheddar cheese.  The cheddar is better, but the Romano will do in a pinch, just a different flavor.

Made these for a pot luck and everyone commented on how good they were. I added chopped green onions to the yolk mix and sprinkled the eggs with paprika.

What a great recipe!!  Lol, been feeding it to my son's varsity football team as an after practice snack - which results in begging for more. Staple selection as a carry over for dinner. Never fails to get praise or requests for the how to. Thanks!!!

Love devilled eggs, thought I would try these as like bacon and cheese, unfortunately I found them too salty,  family didn't really care for them either, just personal taste for foods, will stick to traditional devilled eggs

I've made these several times and they've always been a hit. I do use light mayo, and season the yolk mixture with a bit of salt and pepper. I also sprinkle the tops with finely chopped chives. Definitely a nice change from basic deviled eggs!

This recipe is awesome!  I was a little unsure how I'd like it, since I love the traditional deviled eggs so much, but this was worth the risk!  I did however add one extra piece of bacon... cauase... well why the hell not?   Very very good.  I don't think I'll make traditional deviled eggs ever again now!

These were awesome. The only thing I would do differently next time is make a double batch. They were the first thing gone at the pot luck.

My daughter has to follow a strict diet and I was looking for egg recipes for our Christmas gathering. These were a hit. I especially liked the way they are cooked. I always just guessed how long to boil the eggs and sometimes the shells would crack. These turned out perfect!

I made this and everyone LOVED it! However, I put 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream. Added even more mustard to taste (as they were a little bland without) and added extra cheese. For Christmas I dyed the eggs and yolks as well. Also, I put the yolk mixture into a plastic zip-lock bag and snipped off a corner in order to pipe the mixture into the eggs. Whoever gave that tip, thank you! It was a huge help!

I actually like this recipe better than original devilled eggs.  Not that I hate those but these were so flavorful.  I did add minced onion, chives, minced pickled jalepenos (about 5 slices), seasoned with Tastefully Simple's Fiesta Party Dry Mix and I used bacon bits, and everything included in the recipe above as well as sprinkled the tops ever so lightly with cayenne pepper.  I think it will be a recipe that people love if they are not hard core regular devilled egg lovers (and no other will do).  It has texture and crunch and I suppose you could puree it if you wanted to avoid that but yum!  I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe and for inspiring me to make my own version of it.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now, but just getting around to rating it.  I must say that this is absolutely the best way to make deviled eggs that I've ever tried.  Since making them initally, I am now asked to make them for literally every get-together that I attend, and they are a regular hit in our home, as well.  If you are in a pinch for time, good quality bacon bits (chewy, not crispy) work well in lieu of the real bacon.

Made the recipe as written, and it was much too bland. I added some plain yogurt for tartness and smoothness, some vinegar, and some hot sauce. I used an immersion blender to smooth it a little, and I put more crumbled bacon on top. Next time will use extra sharp aged cheddar cheese

The recipe itself is great.  The only problem I had was that I like to pipe my filling into the eggs so that it looks pretty and this was extremely difficult to do that with.  The bacon and cheese kept clogging my tool that I use to pipe the mixture with!  Next time I won't use that tool.

These weren't as good as I had hoped.  I think partly because I had no mustard to put into them.  I also add cider vinegar to my  regular deviled eggs.  I may try that next time.

So fast and easy, and so many layers to the flavor of the filling!  I added a little pickle juice for a bit more salt.  Divine!  Be careful not to add too much juice, though, or it will get soupy fast.  LOVE THE BACON!

I made these for the first time last Christmas. They are the best deviled eggs I've had and usually I'm not a huge fan. I couldn't stop snacking on them! I'll be using this recipe from now on.

These are great for parties. I made them the same but I put a tablespoon of pickle juice in the mixture along with a teaspoon extra of mustard. And on top I added a little extra bacon and cheese to make them look pretty. Everyone loved them!

Took these to a cook out and they were a big hit!  I probably added more bacon and cheese ( I didn't measure) and used ground mustard instead.  Topped the eggs with a bit of bacon.  They looked good and tasted even better.

Great recipe!  Microwave turkey bacon and these turned out great!  Used yellow mustard and added a tiny bit of onion powder.  Used double amount of cheese.  Was a huge hit! All added pepper for taste.

These are made for every single family party!  Our family loves them.  My husband makes the recipe different every time and they turn out awesome.  The key is to get the bacon as crispy as you can (even a little burnt tastes good) and then vary on the cheese (we used cheddar shredded but also cut up) we also add a little brown sugar and sweet relish, the possibilities to vary this are endless!!!

Very tasty. I usually add some chives as well and a little sour cream on top. My dog enjoyed them for Easter without our knowledge, but they are good for humans too.

At every special occasion, I always offer to bring these deviled eggs. They are sooo good! I do add extra bacon but that's the only change I make. I just made these for Thanksgiving and my grandfather who doesn't eat enough to keep a bird alive, ate 5 before dinner was even served. My whole family loves these!

These were o.k. not great. All were eaten, but my family said not again. Oh well it was worth the try. I followed the recipe without any changes and there was no reason to add the cheese because you can't taste it. All the other flavors over power it.Did feel like something was missing in the flavor!

These were okay, but it didn't floor me.  I liked the addition of bacon.  The cheese was ultimatley lost though.  I didn't taste it at all, even with sharp cheddar.  One drawback is that when piping the filling into the eggs even with a huge star tip, the bacon bits get stuck inside and can't use the piping bag.  I made these twice and the second time, I added some minced chives and I liked it better.

Now I know what to make every time a family or friendly gather comes along! Once these deviled eggs are on the table expect no leftovers! They fly right off the plate and into the mouths of your now gleefully happy guests. The only changes I made was reducing the mayonnaise;used turkey bacon, Dijon mustard and added cracked black pepper. Heavenly!

Didn't care so much for these. I think I'd prefer the traditional deviled egg over this one. I love bacon but didn't care for the consistency of the filling and the look of the eggs.

Very good idea, but the recipe is definitely too bland.  I more than doubled the bacon and the cheddar and it improved quite a bit.

I fixed these for Christmas Eve dinner and will never fix them again. Personally I like my plain old smooth deviled eggs with mayo, mustard, salt.  The bacon crumbles & cheese were a turnoff.

These are fantastic.  I used honey mustard instead of regular prepared mustard and some finely chopped green onions.  I used microwave ready bacon which was the perfect texture. Everyone loved them.  And, not a single egg was left.

These deviled eggs are absolute heaven. I do add more bacon than what is calls for but we all love bacon. A couple of friends came over for a BBQ and one of them almost ate the entire tray.

Super delicious and super easy. Great spin on your run-of-the-mill deviled eggs recipe and a crowd pleaser. I used microwavable bacon and it was easy and wonderful. Using it for a party next weekend so thanks!

I thought these were pretty tasty.  I've made them a couple of times now, along with my mom's usual recipe for deviled eggs.  I think they're a nice change and provide some variety.  It's good to have options, and I liked this as a variation on a favorite food.

Everyone liked these very much.  I thought the mustard flavor was a little overpowering (so I may reduce that next time), and I couldn't really taste the cheese (I may increase that next time...).  I sprinkled them with freshly ground black pepper and paprika.  A nice change from standard deviled eggs.  Thanks!

When i read a recipe on this awesome site i always read through the first 2 pages of reviews. I really had a hard time with the crunch of bacon in my own mind and a few had menioned the same.  So instead of adding bacon i added honey ham, cold sharp cheddar cheese and instead of regular mustard i used dijon. Then i decorated with finely chopped green onion and a sprinkle of paprika. I made these for a pot luck at work and by the time i got around the table there was only 1 egg left - 3 people asked for the recipe and both my kids ate them (my harshest critics). Hopefully at some point i am game enough to try the bacon!

I just boiled my eggs like normal hard boiled eggs. I did use the filling for this recipe and it came out delicious the only thing I would change next time is I will probably use a honey  mustard  instead of regular mustard. I also dashed some paprika on top and cutted down on the mustard a little for this recipe.

Made these for a company picnic & they disappeared immediately!!  I got so many compliments.  My co-workers were surprised by the taste since it wasn't the traditional deviled egg, but enjoyed the flavor very much.

I took these to a backyard BBQ.  Set them on the table and went back in the house to get ice to keep them cold.  By the time I got back, they were all gone!  Absolutely fabulous.  Can't really taste the cheese (used mild cheddar) but it was yummy anyway.  Used good bacon, not bacon bits.

I took these to a family dinner and they were a huge hit!  I didn't modify the ingredients at all and they were perfect. I'm taking off a star because the recipe WILL NOT WORK as written, the eggs will be severely undercooked.  It should say 22-24 minutes, not 10-12.  Luckily I already knew how to hard-boil eggs, and otherwise the recipe is a keeper!

I was so happy to find this recipe after trying something similar at a local restaurant.  I screwed up the first time on boiling the eggs.  Didn't want to waste the sauce and discovered it is great on salmon worthy of a weekly dinner.  I added dried onions and hot sauce for an extra bite.  My mom's advise on boiling the eggs is to boil them, remove them from the burner and leave them alone as long as possible.  The second time, I succeeded on both the eggs and the result.  This time I added hot sauce and horseradish for an extra kick.  I'm glad to have this recipe since I'm eating low carb.

This is my family's favorite deviled egg recipe! I like using horseradish mustard in this, as it gives it just a bit more tang. I have also made a lighter version using turkey bacon, reduced fat mayo, and reduced fat cheese, which is equally good...it didn't taste different to me at all. I have made this many times and will continue to do so!

This recipe has excellent flavor.  I thought that the added bacon would be a hit, but the texture seemed odd.  Despite that, this is my permanent recipe for deviled eggs, with the bacon omitted.  The Miracle Whip that some reviewers used is too sweet for me, so I added a little sugar instead, just to tone down the tang of the mustard.  Thanks - I love it!!

Bacon and cheese are a nice addition. Instead of 1/2 cup of mayo, I use 2-3 TBSP Hellman's real mayo and 3 oz pkg of softened cream cheese, the flavor is great, my family loves it.

I made these for a church function.  They were gone in a flash.... I didn't even get one. :o) Thanks so much for a great recipe.  My only change was to add some garlic powder and some onion salt.  I will make them often.  Thanks again.

I made these over the weekend and they are the best deviled eggs I've ever had and made. I added extra bacon and cheese just because I love both. It was like a eating contest in our house to see who got the last one. Definately a keeper.

WoW!!! Great recipe! I've made deviled eggs plenty of times and didn't really think they could get any better, but they have. The bacon makes them that much better! The batch I made were gone in a blink, I will definitely be making these again and again. I followed the recipe exactly and added a little yellow food coloring for presentation per another reviewers suggestion. I also added more mustard than instructed because I am a mustard lover, but they would be just as fabulous without this change. Thanks for sharing!

magnificent! The bacon gives the age-old recipe a run for its money. I added chopped chives for presentation which tasted delicious with the bacon and cheddar.

Double the cheese and add some sour cream to make it a bit more creamy. Don't forget the mustard, add paprika on top. Yum, Yum, Yummy!

These were great for my husband's company Easter party.  I added some sour cream (2 dallops), cayenne (1/8 teaspoon), and extra cheese.  Gives it that little kick it was missing.  Otherwise this is the first time my husband has ever liked a deviled egg.

reviewer:  Yum, yum, yummy - made these and they're perfect. I like a lot of mustard, so I was tempted to add more then called for - Glad I didn't, as it would have taken away from the flavor of the bacon. At first bite, we wanted to add a dash of salt but again, glad I didn't b/c when you taste the bacon you have more then enough salty flavor. Can't wait to make for the holidays!

The bacon is a good idea, but next time I think I'll stick to my way of preparing deviled eggs. These were a bit plain. Good with some soy sauce though, lol.

I had a couple friends over and decided to make these. I made the mistake of using fresh eggs and they were not easy to peel. So needless to say my presentation was not very good, but the filling was great. I added red pepper to spice it up. I will make these again.

Excellent!  Getting the bacon crispy without burning was tricky though.  I fried the bacon to get rid of most of the greece.  Then I transferred it to the microwave and cooked it for 2 x 30 secs to get the fat and meat crispy.

Very good and different.  A twist for deviled eggs!  I like this better than the traditional deviled eggs.  I added a little black pepper, seasoning salt, extra mayo and used turkey bacon fried hard.  It was a hit!

Eggcellent!  Traditionally, my wife has made the holiday meals.  However, since I'm retired and she hasn't yet, I did it all this year.  Almost everyone pulled me aside and said that this is the "BEST" ever.  Not a single one left for the next day.  Darn it!  Looks like I'll be making these again and again.  Thanks Emily.

These are very tasty. I used real bacon bits to cut down on prep time and reduce the mess! A also added about salt and pepper, and a teaspoon of pickle juice, as I always do to my deviled eggs. It adds an extra kick that's oh-so-good. The bacon and cheddar were a nice change to the usual deviled eggs.

These were okay. It's a lot of work for deviled eggs; I much rather prefer just eating the bacon on the side. While you can taste it, the work just doesn't seem worth it. Like others here, I added in a ton of sharp cheddar but couldn't taste it. What a waste of cheese and calories. Better to have regular deviled eggs, leave the cheese out of it, and have some bacon on the side.

This is similar to the fabulous deviled eggs we make. A couple of adjustments to consider: add two teaspoons of vinegar for a little punch; use half mayo and half sour cream; if you're in a hurry the jarred bacon bits will do. Sometimes I use a mixer just to make the egg mixture really smooth. For a little "fancier" look, sprinkle a little paprika over the eggs.

What a treat to find this recipe on here!!  I've been making my deviled eggs like this for years and am amazed that more people don't do so because it is SO GOOD!  I use good quality extra sharp cheddar because I love the taste it gives.  It's also fun to add either a little juice from the dill pickle jar or even just a bit of dill pickle relish.  Mmmmm.

MMM!  Excellent recipe.  Nice change from ordinary deviled eggs.  Did add about 1/4 c. more mayo and a tbsp. more sharp cheddar cheese.  Also added about 1/2 tsp. white distilled vinegar for a tad bit more flavor.  Will definitely make again.  I used my pampered chef food chopper to chop up the bacon- I used about 5 slices of bacon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for a Memorial Day cookout and everyone loved them. I adjusted the recipe for 18 servings and it was so easy to whip these together. I did use Hormel 30% Less Fat Real Bacon Bits, and it was fantasic. People were surprised at teh combination, but really enjoyed them. Thanks for the recipe!

I dont know what whoever wrote this recipe was thinking as far as the instructions on boiling the eggs. I follwed them exactly and the eggs were not cooked at all...runny and ruined. They take MUCH longer to boil! Otherwise the recipe is pretty good.

I made these at Thanksgiving, and everyone loved them! I do think you should use fresh bacon (not bits) because the grease adds to the flavor - let it sit for awhile before you pipe it in to really let the flavors blend! YUM! YUM! YUM!!!

Took these as an appetizer to my mom's Thanksgiving party. Ten minutes later there wasn't a single one left on the plate and everyone kept asking where they went. Will definitely make these again and I won't change a thing.

I made 3 different different types of deviled eggs for Thanksgiving, this year.  This was by far the favorite.

I have an allergy to vinegar so I was looking for a deviled egg recipe without it and stumbled upon this one. I made a dozen eggs for a 6 person dinner party and they were gone within 20 minutes of serving them. It's like a cheese and bacon omlet in a finger food. Delicious. I used turkey bacon, 2% shredded cheese and light mayo and it was still great.

These came out great and everyone at the party was making comments about how good they were.  The bacon addition (plus I drizzled in a bit of the bacon grease) makes these stand out from other deviled eggs.

Everyone loved these, even those who weren't big deviled egg fans. I did add a few dashes of tabasco and also used my homemade Jack Daniels Mustard which is on the spicy side. Garnished with Hungarian paprika. Delicious!

Very good idea to add bacon and cheese!  I just made these for a cookout tonight, and I have already eaten 2.  I am sure they will go over well tonight!  I didn't really measure, I just added the ingredients until it "looked right" and also added a splash of vinegar and garnished with paprika.

Simply loved these! I am a hughe bacon fan and it just seems so elementary to add it to deviled eggs. I used honey mustard and it came out great. Made these for Easter and everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks!

My friends can't get enough of these!  I've made them three times in two weeks.  I am getting tired of peeling eggs... I did add a few things - a little horseradish, some onion and garlic powder... paprika sprinkled on top... they were a hit.

This was a great change from my usual spinach and bacon deviled eggs. Everyone really enjoyed them! I mixed the dijon mustard with the yolks like the recipe called for, but couldn't really taste it. I added a little color and a lot of flavor by putting a dollop of mustard on top of each egg half. Not only were they delish, but they looked great too!

Great for a change in an old favorite! The kids couldn't get enough of them. I added a bit of sour cream, and used a dijon mustard. I also added a pit of paprika for the adults (kids just don't like the look of paprika). Great recipe!

I thought these were awesome, although a good friend of mine wasn't too happy when she ate one and found bacon inside.  She likes bacon, but she was pretty firm that she didn't like bacon in her deviled eggs and didn't eat anymore.  Either way, I thought they were outstanding and thought the bacon was a perfect compliment to the eggs.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing.

These were delicious.  I did sprinkle cayenne pepper on top at the end.  I tried it both ways, and in my opinion it is much better with the cayenne pepper.  This gives it a great added zing.  I also used pre-cooked bacon that you heat in the microwave.  This was much easier and still tasted great.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.  I will never again make deviled eggs any other way!

This recipe was a big hit! I used a little extra mayo (for my brother-in-law's taste) and added 2 tsp of horseradish.  I will definately be making these again.  Everyone has requested them!

As a newly wed I am forever being challenged by my husband's picky taste buds and his desire for all things "Mom." I tried these deviled eggs on a whim, and his response was, "AMAZING!" I changed it up just a tad because of what I had around, and it was great. Instead of bacon I used some Bacon-Ranch Jack cheese and added a pinch of cayenne pepper. Really excellent!

An excellent and easy switch out for any occasion!  Our Mother's Day gathering had several 'low-carb' dieters in attendance and it was a definately a hit with all of them... I think though that my son was a little sneaky and ate a good portion of them!

Interesting but a good combination for deviled eggs.  I would reccommend using a little more mayo though so it's not so rough in texture.  Also a couple people thought it could do without the bacon.

I do not eat deviled eggs, but I'm giving it five stars based on my guest's reaction (and repeat request). I thought bacon and cheese would not be enough to make an impact, but these were gone alost as fast as they hit the table.

Made these for Easter and they didn't last long, even picky kids were eating more than their fair share.  I did add a touch more mustard, for a tad more *zing* and about a tablespoon more cheese.  But they were a hit and don't think I'll make them any other way again!

These were the first of all my appetizers to disappear at a Game Night party! The only changes I made were to used crumbled turkey bacon and sprinkle paprika over the top of the eggs. The mixture was creamy and easy to work with, unlike other deviled egg recipes I've tried in the past. This is a definite keeper!

These were just ok. I added pickled jalapeño because the were missing that acidic lunch for me. The household agreed, we prefer traditional deviled eggs to these.

Delicious!! Made these for a family get together and they were a huge hit! My hard to please step mother even loved them.  Love that this is so simple! I used avocado oil mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and blended with in immersion blender. The texture was perfect. Then stirred in the  crumbled bacon. Spooned the filling into the egg whites and sprinkled with Smoked Paprika, best deviled eggs ever!!

I’ve made a few deviled eggs on here, never felt the need to write a review on them but to my shock, people are right, this WAS the hit of the party… I had Salmon, Shrimp you name it, but out of all I had, most comments were made on these and were gone fast!  I did make it pretty much as directed EXCEPT I did add a little hot sauce my friend “Frank” told me about… (other hot sauces wont so the same)… just a few drops to enhance the flavor is all you need.

I tried with all the nozzles for the squeeze bag that I had, but I guess the bacon wasn't chopped enough to go through... I also added dill relish which made it that much better. Delicious recipe.

I make my hard boiled eggs in the instant pot, and this recipe is great. Please note that I try to make things easy and use Costco real bacon bits, I always add extra cheese, and add seasoning salt and pepper :)

I didn't make any changes to the recipe. It was perfect. I take it to potluck dinners all the time. My friends keep requesting it over and over.

These were awesome.
I cooked the eggs in our Instant Pot.

Made the recipe with no changes and they were great.
Only thing I would note...we wanted to use a piping bag and tip and pipe in the filling, but the bacon prevented this.  Next time I'll leave the bacon out of the filling and sprinkle it on top.

I followed the recipe exactly except I minced some shredded Mexican blend cheese (since it was such a small amount and we keep that shredded cheese on hand) and finely chopped the bacon. I think the textural difference will help. I've only tasted a little of the yolk mix (celebration is later today) but it was delicious! I'm not a fan of normal deviled eggs, made these for my keto-dieting son, but I would take these any day!

Delicious! I used a quart size freezer bag to mash the 9 egg yolks (a sandwich bag is too weak and broke the last time); then I added finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 4 slices of turkey bacon bits (equal to approximately 1/4 cup); I added the mustard to the light Duke's mayo then add to the yolk/cheese/bacon mixture. I sprinkled extra bacon bits on top. I have made it without the cheese and was asked to never omit it again. This is definitely a favorite! I have found Oscar Meyer turkey bacon and light Duke's mayo taste the best together.

I added the bacon grease to the mixture which gave it more of a bacon flavor also helped keep the mixture smooth and not so chunky and I also added more cheese then the recipe calls for. All in all now a family favorite!

These bacon cheddar deviled eggs were great. I also substituted bacon bits for real bacon because it saved time. I added a lil salt, a 1/2 tsp sugar, relish and sprinkled with smoked paprika. They are the ????!

Based on a couple of comments, we omitted the cheese. The wasabi paste we used wasn't all that spicy but lent a subtle piquancy to the eggs. A dusting of smoked paprika provided the perfect finish. Delish!

Fantastic simple recipe. I chose to simplify even more since I was short on time and left out the cheese and bacon. I just added a little salt and sprinkled both pepper and paprika on top. Perfect! I'm sure the cheese and bacon will be even better. I needed to use boiled eggs that I'd pre-purchased before they expired. I just sliced in half and popped out the yolks and 10 minutes later, they were done!

Great recipe!  Have made it several times.  One time I realized I had no cheddar cheese so I left it out and did not notice a difference.  I have left it out ever since.  I always sprinkle the final product with salt, pepper, and cayenne.

These are good. I didn't really taste the cheese; I'd maybe add a little more next time.  You could jazz them up with some onion, salt, pepper, hot sauce. But they are perfectly fine as is.

Bacon balances flavors well.  Used spicy mustard to give it a broader flavor.

This is one of my deviled egg go to recipes. I use Dijon mustard and didn’t make any variations.  It’s a hit.

When I make these again, I won't add the bacon to the filling until right before I am ready to serve.  The bacon was not crispy when I filled these the day before.  I saved some to crumble over the top as well.

I've been making this recipe for at least 6 years...especially at Easter.  The combination of cheese and bacon is nothing short of AMAZING.  My slight alterations to this recipe is I use 1/2 tablespoon of mustard and I use Dijon.  DON'T use spicy mustard...really leaves a nasty taste.  And I use 2/3 cup of HELLMANNS mayo......not imitation.  Also, chop the cheese and bacon with a palm chopper really well.  If you pipe your filling like I do, the finer the cheese and bacon, the easier it will be to fit through the tip.

Nothing says Easter like Deviled eggs!!  These things are the bomb.  They needed a touch of extra mayo to moisten up the filling a tad.  Get after it.  You won’t regret it!

Wow!  This recipe was simply delicious.   Everyone really enjoyed this dish.  I am so sorry that I did not double the original recipe.  This recipe will most definitely be in the family’s meal rotation.  I cannot wait until  make this dish again!!!

The  deviled eggs were delicious!  I had never made deviled eggs before.  These were very easy to make and everyone loved them. I put the yolk mixture in a zip lock bag and cut a corner off of it and used it to squeeze the mixture into the egg white halves.

Awesome!!! One tip I learned, after the water starts to boil it works better to leave the pot on the burner with it turned off instead of letting it sit off the burner for the 10-12 minutes. My first try they didn’t cook all the way through. But the finished product turned out great!

The texture is a bit off considering the bacon in the mix, however the taste is spectacular. 
Dont let kids eat these.  They will never  ever make the traditional deviled eggs when they get older.
Tip - Bathe eggs in cold water and ice for 15 minutes after they are removed for easier peeling. ;)  Have a cupcake decorating bag on hand to get that finished look.

Made according to directions except added a few tsp of salt. Loved this variation on a traditional classic!
I took the advice of another cook and cooked the bacon to a medium crispiness. Gave the eggs a nice bacon flavor without being crunchy.

I can't eat eggs (food sensitivity), but I made them for my husband. He loved them! He probably would have eaten the whole lot of them if I didn't pry them out of his hands :)
Thanks for the recipe!

One of our favorite sides is deviled eggs.  I made these  exactly as the recipe instructed.  The cheddar cheese and mustard took deviled eggs to a new level of tastiness.  They were above and beyond the best we've ever made.

So great! I probably could’ve done with half the mustard. I added a little green onion to the egg mixture and then sprinkled with paprika to finish.  Everyone loved them.

I gave this recipe a 4 star because the flavor was lacking until I added some celery seed.  I would recommend this recipe but definitely add some celery seed or other spice to give it some flavor.  I put all ingredients except the bacon in my food processor to mix it smoothly.  I then added pieces of bacon bits and garnish with bacon bits and fresh basil from my garden. They were delicious!

Excellent. A nice change of pace from the  regular deviled eggs, of which I am NOT a fan.   Nice summer treat or appetizer.  Didn't change a thing.  Would absolutely make again!

These were eggselent! I kid not. After reading a ton of reviews, I went 1/2 and 1/2 on sour cream and mayo and microwaved the bacon to crumble. Topped with some chives. These were a big hit to some pretty picky deviled egg eaters!

Have been making this recipe EXACTLY how it is written for over 8yr now. Hands down the most requested side dish for any get together or party. Others try the original and get their feelings hurt taking theirs home while mine are devoured almost immediately, everytime. DON'T alter it, just make it as written.....doesn't need any alterations.

Best deviled eggs ever!  I made 6 dozen for a big family party and since it took a bit for the food to be ready, everyone snacked on these little scrumptious bites.  I didn't have a single one to take home.  Many asked for the recipe.  Like some others I did add some finely chopped onion.  I also added a few shakes of the Cholula hot sauce, because that **** tastes good on everything.

My family really like it.  I thought it was more ok, but I'm not huge on eggs and the bacon made it kind of salty (to me).  It was a nice change from the typical deviled eggs, though.

Just made today for a work party tomorrow.  Can't wait to serve them.  Nice change up to deviled eggs. I added extra mayo and mustard because it seemed dry.  I used extra sharp cheddar too

These were wonderful! I did add a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and about a teaspoon of dill pickle juice and cut up two baby dill pickles and threw them in the mix. I sprinkled paprika on each and a slice of black olive on each for garnish!!! Yum yum!!!

Made these per the recipe for a party.  I'd rate them as OK. They were eaten up but no more 'wow' than regular deviled eggs. Flavor sorta reminded me of bacon and eggs with mustard.

I doubled the cheese and used sharp cheddar.  These were AWESOME!!  My new favorite way to make deviled eggs!!  Everyone loved them, even those that don't usually like deviled eggs.

These were really good, my husband really loved them. You really can't taste the cheese much so take it or leave it. The bacon really added a nice flavor to it! These were very easy to make and tasted really good!

Excellent! I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe. Best deviled eggs I've ever had. Next time, I may garnish it with a sprig of dill just to see what that is like.

Was very good. I followed the recipe exactly. But next time, do half mayo and half sour cream. And maybe a little less dressing total. It was a little too much. Loved the mustard taste. I added a little garlic granules and that was good. Also, I think a little more cheese would be better. The bacon was a good amount. Maybe add some pepper. To be continued!!

these are amazingly wonderful! I have made these as directed and once with modifications,this recipe is perfect as is, if you sub out 1\2 of the mayo for plain Greek yogurt it becomes very rich. the whole family loved these. these are going to become a family tradition, I also suggest these to friends for parties. very good.

I found the filling to be too dry and it tasted only of egg yolks. I added a couple tablespoons of mayo and some sweet mustard to balance the salt from the bacon and cheese. I won't make these again though.

Every time I look at a recipe people always say "This was great!" but then add "But I used this this and this" which irritates me to no end. Make your own recipe on the website at that point. 

This recipe is great. My family always hogged the deviled eggs to the point they were always gone within the first round. Adding bacon and cheese to them just makes them like poultry meth. Great idea!

They were gone in minutes!  I barely managed to get them to Thanksgiving dinner because my husband and 4 year old kept eating them. I was very proud hearing everyone say, "Did you try the deviled eggs?   You better hurry and grab one before they are gone.  They are awesome!"  My only changes were using Miracle Whip and adding some dill pickle juice. (not a Mayo family).  Thank you for the recipe!  I'm making them again for my daughter's birthday party. (Her request!)

This was an incredibly easy recipe. I made it exactly how the recipe called. They were the first dish that was completely devoured. This is definitely a "make again" recipe.

Used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 miracle whip vs. all mayonnaise. Also saw the reviews so I used about the Oscar Myers fully cooked bacon and about 1 Tbs.  Worcestershire sauce and about 1 tsp. sirachi sauce to the mix. OMG, great!  The first thing to go at the football party!

Excellent recipe when you want to take your deviled eggs up a notch. Didn't change a thing and the gang loved them! I do have one hint for cooling the eggs though - when they are done cooking, place them into a large bowl (using a large slotted spoon) that is half filled with water and lots of ice. They will cool very quickly and easily this way. Enjoy!

So good I didn't change a think, except I didn't fill them till right before the event cause I was afraid of them rolling during travel. Well I sampled the filling right after making it and  before adding it to the eggs and OMG the bacon was so amazing after letting it sit over night.  I think letting the flavors meld then filling made a huge difference.

i took these to a brunch - everyone, and I mean everyone that had one, raved about them and they were gone instantly.  My hubby loves devilled eggs and was skeptical but after trying them he said it's definitely a winner and better than the normal devilled eggs.  I made them exactly as is but added some extra sharp cheese.  The bacon is what everyone seemed to rave about

I usually don't comment on stuff but I just HAD TO let you & everybody else know just how AMAZING these are.  I did added a touch of mozzarella in addition to the cheddar cheese, instead of chopping strips of bacon, I used a tiny bit of Plumrose bacon pieces, & 2 finely chopped pieces of GV smoked ham. Once again,  OMG, SO GOOD!!!

I made but substituted the mayo for Sour cream.  Also I made the bacon crumbles very fine.  I also didn't cook the bacon too a crispy hard crunch. I added a bit of the bacon grease in the mix.   I added salt and pepper and a little onion powder.    They came out delicious and everyone got seconds and thirds.

I made this for the first time to take to Easter dinner. I replaced about 1/4 of the mayo with sour cream and added some paprika. I then topped with more cheese, more bacon, and some green onions (mostly for the visual appeal). They were gone in no time!!

I had never made deviled eggs before but made these and took them to a brunch and they were gone. Someone else brought regular deviled eggs and over half of theirs were left. I was stopped multiple times and told how amazing they were. I doubled the amount of cheese, added a tablespoon of pickle juice, a bit more mayo for creaminess, and topped them with a little slice of avocado and a few pieces of diced tomato.

These turned out great. I cooked two extra strips of bacon to break up and place on top of each egg half because I was worried about sneaking bacon into unsuspecting nonbacon eaters. Everyone loved them!

These eggs are great. I used cheddar cheese the first time. We really could not taste the cheese, so the next time I used Gouda cheese. Wow everyone loved them. My family now ask that I fix only these deviled eggs. I can double the eggs and maybe have leftovers the next day. Thank you for this new version it is just fantastic.

Really good!  We accidentally burnt the bacon but it crumbled much easier than the less cooked nest and actually tasted awesome.  Added some paprika to cover my many mishaps trting to spoon this in cleanly.  Will definitely be on my party list.

Very tasty.  Some mods:  Use a bit less Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  And use 1/2 Trader Joe's Greek Yogurt (whole) for a sour-creamy smooth taste.   TIPS: Deshell eggs under water for a -much- easier peel.  I also fully cook my turkey bacon so it's crispy, not raw/greasy like the video. ;)
Bacon and eggs, what a wonderful new concept!

Best deviled eggs I've ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly and just added a piece of bacon and green onions on top for decoration.  This is now a fan favorite for Christmas and Thanksgiving.

I haven't made deviled eggs in years, so this recipe was perfect for my family function.  I used bacon pieces (NOT Bacon Bits) because we always have a bag in the fridge.  I added the same amount as the cheese.  I couldn't get my own kids to try them because I made the mistake of telling them it has mustard in it, but other kids tried and like them.  Nobody seemed to notice they were any different than originals until I pointed it out to them.   I agree with several family members who said they could taste the bacon, but not the cheddar cheese.  Not that that's bad, just an observation.  Maybe if I would have used freshly cooked bacon they would've popped more.  Those of us who love deviled eggs devoured them, I made 48 halves and they were gone fairly quickly.  I picked this recipe because everything tastes better with cheese and bacon, and I will continue to use it because they definitely weren't bland like some variations I've tried.

Instead of bacon I used prosciutto because I had it in the house which I crisped up in a sauté pan, I doubled the mustard using a sweet and spicy version and plenty of black pepper. Definitely will make again. Thank you!!

Awesome! I made these for a "Secret Santa" party one year, and now I have to make them for every special occasion. What a drag...lol. This recipe is a nice simple twist on you ordinary devil eggs. The only thing missing was the paprika topping that I was used to growing up, so I used Smoked paprika for an extra twist. I would also recommend using center cut bacon to cut down on the grease. You can't go wrong with this recipe! A+++++

I have made these several times and they disappear before everyone knows they are on the table.  Even the pickiest eater has loved them.  The only thing I do differently is add  1 tablespoon of Kraft Parmesan-Romano-Asiago mix.

After getting tired of the usual plain deviled eggs, I decided to try this recipe.  I only used half a dozen eggs just in case I ended up not liking them.  They were soooo good! I followed the recipe as is and used turkey bacon.  I will definitely be making more of these real soon.

Before this recipe, I didn't like deviled eggs.  These, I love and crave, and love making for my husband (who's always liked other kinds of deviled eggs that others have made - I never made them before either).  These are so good, I lick the spoon every time I make them.  Can't go wrong with bacon and cheddar!

Time to use the Easter eggs! I followed the recipe as written and then topped mine with smoked paprika. They were awesome! My hubby and son REALLY liked them, but they like bacon in just about anything, lol! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Love these!!! Used up the Easter eggs after the kids were done hunting. I also added some chipotle mayo as I had more than a dozen eggs and diced a couple slices of hardwood smoked gouda instead of the cheddar. They were awesome! Thanks :)

I'm just now taking a more serious interest in cooking, and I decided to make these for Easter.  They were very easy, and VERY tasty!  The whole family loved them.  I added a little paprika on top but followed the recipe aside from that.  Will definitely be making them again!

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe since I was doing some extra eggs.  I followed the advice in other reviews and added extra bacon since I had it and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt (sour cream) and sprinkled paprika on the top.  They were a hit with our guests and my husband and I loved them.  A great way to use up Easter Eggs!

The recipe came out fine.  Although cheddar and bacon are generally the ultimate combination, it just didn't seem to work for the deviled eggs.  I think I'll stick to the traditional eggs in the future.

Cheddar, bacon, eggs... where could you go wrong! Used a bit of cumin to enhance the flavors, but otherwise followed the recipe to the tee. I think I'll try with miracle whip to see the how the recipe holds up with that change, but it is great as it stands. THANKS SO MUCH for this one!

Cooking method is my tried and true way to get perfect results every time (though, I usually let mine sit a few minutes longer in the water once it boils.) Perfect ratio of mayo/mustard to egg yolks. I forgot to add the cheese til after Grandpa had piped the filling in so we just sprinkled the tops with bacon (we did just the tops in case anyone wanted the standard, bacon-free version). A crowd pleaser at our holiday dinner table!

11 yr old grandson watched me assemble this, and of course he wanted to sample. His words "Grandpa these are the best ever". We had left overs that he was going to take care of the next day. He ate one, and asked me if I had tried them. He was right they were so much better the next day. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

little heavy on the mayo, and mustard, but the bacon adds crunch and good texture. i enjoyed the taste but my thanksgiving guests had mixed feelings.

The flavor is not much different than your everyday deviled eggs recipe, for the extra effort needed to make the bacon and spend the extra few bucks for cheese, overall not worth it. Not to say that this recipe is not good but it's all "extra pizzaz".

Best deviled eggs I've ever had. They're especially great for those people that don't like relish, pickles or paprika.  Followed the recipe to a tee and they were absolutely delicious! I've never been able to make deviled eggs that could even compare to my mother-in--law's (according to my husband) - until now!!!!  He absolutely loves these.  Thank-you, Emily, for this fantastic recipe.

This was ok. My hustband and I enjoyed this although I am used to using dry mustard rather then prepared mustard. I think I prefer the dry mustard.

I will never make deviled eggs the "old fashioned" way again!  These were THE BEST deviled eggs I have ever tasted.  I didn't follow the measurements to a "T", but I did put all of the ingredients listed (substituting Miracle Whip for Mayo).  And I used the Fat Free versions of cheese and Miracle Whip.  Yummy!!  Thanks for posting.

I was a little cautious to try this recipe, since I enjoy the traditional deviled eggs.  However, since my husband loves bacon and cheese, I thought I would try it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't think I'll ever make the traditional deviled eggs again.  These were wonderful!

I didn't like the bacon and the inside was creamier than I like. However, everyone else thought they were good, so it may be that the bacon threw me off. Still I didn't think it was great so tha'ts where the 2 stars came from.

Served these at a bridal shower -- they were a hit! I used light mayo (Duke's, of course!) and needed to add a little extra to keep the texture creamy, but I think that was just a personal preference. Yummy!

The idea sounded great - bacon with deviled eggs - but I served these on New Years Eve, and I don't thinkg anyone had more than 1.  The 'crunch' in the deviled egg made most think there was egg-shells in the filling.  The cheese was a great addition - but not the bacon in my opinion (or my guests).  PS - to sweeten up the filling, add a couple tablespoons of sugar!

Great! I've made these many times since finding this recipe because my husband now insists that a deviled egg without bacon is just not acceptable! I put the bacon in my mini food processor to make it as small as possible and that really helps with the textue. I reserve a little bit of bacon to sprinkle on the tops before serving too. Yum! Thanks :)

Awesome!!  These were a hit at a Christmas brunch I went to.  I put extra bacon bits in these for more texture and bacon flavor and used a spicy brown mustard in place of the regular mustard.

Made a sample batch and the bacon flavor went over very well.  For more flavor will add an extra amount of cheese and mustard next time.

These were amazing!!  The crunch of the bacon added a great new texture to the egg.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I agree with another user that I used sharp cheddar to make it more apparent and I also used a little more bacon for more crunch.  We also tried topping with dill and added another great taste!

The cheddar adds more to the texture than to the flavor. These are definitely better than your standard deviled eggs.

I liked these, but the only thing i didnt care for was the cruchy-ness of the bacon. I could not get it chunched down to small enough size. It was a little weird for me, however, the flavor was awesome.

This were different for a change.  I don't eat them but Husband said to go back to the regular deviled eggs.  No comments from guests so I am guessing they weren't anything special.

I was very excited to make this version of deviled eggs, but, surprisingly they did not go over well.  With so many people giving it great reviews, I think two things are the culprit.   1.  I either messed up the recipe or 2.  My southern guests were expecting traditional deviled eggs and were bummed by the change in flavor.  My husband said it was edible but found the flavor odd.  Sorry!

I personally did not care for these, but they were a hit with my guests. Added cheese, but like other reviewers, could not taste it. I'll probably make these again -- I just won't eat them. I guess I prefer the plain old deviled eggs. Regardless, thanks for the recipe!

Really great!  Make them all the less because my kids love them to death.  Only thing I do differently is omit the mustard.  No one in the family is a fan of mustard.

These were ok. I just don't find it right to have a crunch in a deviled egg. I will just stick with the basic recipe. Thanks, anyway.

No salt - no pepper - no taste. I tried to doctor them up to no avail. Followed another reviewer's advice and used Bacos that could have been the big mistake. I never met a deviled egg I didn't like until I made these. Thanks for the recipe, but I will be removing it from my collection.

This was ok, it tasted good but I would rather have a smooth texture for deviled eggs.  I didn't like the texture of the crumbled bacon.  The addition of the shredded cheese was fine though and I would add the cheese again but not bacon.

VERY good.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved them.  I am picky about my deviled eggs, because I don't like mustard (so you can see why I don't normally like deviled eggs).  This had just the right amount of mustard.  Super easy to make.

The best darn deviled eggs I've ever eaten!  I wish I had found this recipe sooner.  I will be making this for all of my spring/summer get togethers.  Everyone loved them and I wouldn't do anything different with this recipe.

I just made these for Easter Dinner and they were awesome. Many family members with different tastes loved them. I will never make the previous deviled egg recipe with so many ingredients again. I added a little more mayo,too dry and I whipped it with my kitchen aide mixer.Very creamy.

I like to add some diced avocado (right before serving).  I have a similar recipe that I use for egg salad...just throw it all in a bowl, mix it up, toss it on some toasted squaw bread and add sliced avocado.  Delish!

I was really impressed with this recipe. I did add slightly more cheese, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The coloring was slightly different than a "typical" deviled egg, so at first people thought something was off about them. Once I told them what was in them, they were more than happy to try them out!

Really good.  I did add a little extra of all the ingredients to the yolks and sprinkled with paprika, as I've normally seen them served. Will make again, esp. for pic-nics.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use a lot of mayo because son won't eat anything that contains it.  This fit the bill nicely especially since he is a bacon freak!

I wanted to try something different then my own usual deviled egg recipe.  My hubby enjoyed this, but told me not to switch over from my own recipe.  Thanks anyway!

I had never tried deviled eggs before but I had made too big of a batch of hard boiled eggs so I'd thought I'd try this out. As soon as I saw bacon I knew this was the recipe for me and I ultimately didn't add the bacon cuz I was being lazy but these were great anyways. I can't wait to try them with bacon.

These were delicious! Such a nice change of pace from the traditional deviled egg. I used about 4 Tablespoons of shredded sharp cheddar because I read that many reviewers couldn't taste the cheddar. I definitely did! I made three different types of deviled eggs for a Superbowl party and they were all eaten! Men just love eggs and football.

These eggs were alright. I made them as an appetizer for Christmas this year along with another type of deviled egg with relish. They were really good but the ones with relish were better.

These turned out great.  I think I ended up putting more cheese in than the recipe called for - I just added some in until it looked about right.  I brought them to a potluck, and everyone said they liked them.  Nice change from the standard deviled eggs.

My kids liked these better than I did.  They weren't bad but given the reviews, I was expecting more.  They did have a different taste than your run-of-the-mill deviled eggs, they just weren't anything to blow your socks off.  I did have to add additional mayo to make it more creamy (it was very thick as written).  Wasn't bad but I won't be making this again.

This is a good recipe, but definitely could use more spices in addition to the other great flavors. I added more paprika, salt, and pepper on the top and in the filling. Because of mixed company I actually made these without the bacon, but veggie and carnivore alike loved them. Next time, with bacon...

These were different and good. I used a hot honey mustard and they still seemed a bit bland to me, so I used spicy brown mustard too.  I took them to a family function and they all disappeared, so they must have liked them too.

I modified the recipe slightly by adding about a teaspoon of spicy horseradish and a few shakes of hot sauces.  These were fantastic and even better the next day, the flavors blend beautifully!

I thought this was really good - I used the pre-made bacon, but other than that, I didn't change it.  The only thing I would advise is if you decide to make this for a party, definitely make sure people know it isn't your "regular" deviled egg.  There were a couple of people at our picnic who didn't hear me say that, and when they bit into it, they were a bit surprised!

My wife said that they were best deviled eggs she had ever eaten. I only cooked 3 XL eggs. I followed the reduced amout recipe except adding a little sour cream to the mix and sprinkling a few pieces of cut green onions on top.

I tried this recipe for Christmas 2007 and absolutely LOVED it! The bacon really makes this recipe. I end up using turkey bacon since it's a healthier option and it tastes great. I've made it a few times since then and I always have a little extra filling mix, so I end up really filling my eggs up a lot. People eat these up quick and really enjoy them! I'd recommend trying the recipe. Enjoy!

These were the best deviled eggs I have ever eaten! I've been making deviled eggs for years but never thought to put cheese and bacon in it! Genius! This was a great way to use the tons of leftover Easter eggs.

I reviewed these earlier, saying they were delicious.  I brought them to another family picnic, and was surrounded by people as I brought them to the house.  They were gone in no time flat.

Easy recipe. Good deviled eggs but thought the mixture missed something. Tasted somewhat bland. Used ready cooked bacon maybe next time I'll grill bacon and serve fresh.

Pretty good.  I had to add more mayo and mustard so the mixture wasn't so thick.  Couldn't taste the cheese so you could probably completly leave that out.  The bacon added an interesting texture.  Next time I'll use Hormel bacon bits so they are softer than home made.

Very excellent recipe! The bacon and cheese really added a nice flavour. I used dijon mustard (for a mild kick), and also added a bit of sour cream. I might try these with Philadelphia Cream Cheese next time. Thank you for the recipe, I'll be making these again!

Loved these!!  Adjusted recipe for 7 dozen eggs-came out great.  Used bacon crumbles from a bag.  Even chopped some of the eggs to make a different egg salad.

I don't care for deviled eggs, so when i was picked for them at Easter I was the least bit excited. Until I found this recipe. So good! Everyone loved them and requested I bring them next year also, regardless who will be picked next year for them.

I absolutely love this recipe. I use a little more mustard, bacon, and cheese than the recipe calls for because I like those tastes better than mayonnaise. I always have trouble if I make them ahead of time for a meal and put them in the fridge because my family won't stop eating them! Make extras!

I love deviled eggs and I LOVE this recipe, just when I thought deviled eggs couldn't get any better. I used bacon bits as mentioned by one of the other reviewers, it added a nice salty flavor and a bit of a crunch.

I love the addition of the bacon!  I did however also add 1 TB minced onion and 2 TBS sweet pickle relish.  This seemed to make it more flavorful and less dry.  While the taste of the cheese is very subtle, I believe it adds to it.  Personally, I would have liked to add some horseradish sauce to give it a little heat, but my children wouldn't have liked!  This is a great way to use up all those easter eggs!

This is a great recipe but i found that if you use store bought eggs you may want to add paprika to give it a richer color/texture. other than that this is a great recipe.

I really didn't like how thick the centers turned out.  If you want your eggs to taste like a blt, then you will like this.

To save time i used prepared real bacon bits. The filling was a little dry, maybe needed a little more mustard then called for. Still came out very yummy.

For some reason, very dry and not much flavor, kept adding mayo/bacon/cheddar but didn't help flavor.  Thanks anyway.

I made this for a Thanksgiving Dinner and every one LOVED them!!  It takes a little longer than regular deviled eggs but it is well worth it.  I added some extra cheese too.  I will only make these deviled eggs for now on.

I tried this recipe out for Thanksgiving dinner. I liked the eggs but my adult kids did not like them very much. They said the change was "ok" but liked the "traditional" deviled eggs better. Hmmmm? Don't know if I will make them again based on their comments.

Very good. Not too different for those who love the old standard, but a very tasty variation. I want to experiment with a little more cheese next time. I think I will also try using this recipe to make egg salad sandwiches. Maybe for a sandwich I will need a tad more mayo and mustard.

What a great idea!!
I added more cheese and bacon becuase I love both.  These were a huge hit at my party and I will definitely be making these again!!

UPDATE: 
I was using store bought bacon pieces for awhile and it worked fine.  I now use bits of turkey bacon and it's great.  I've made these at countless parties and events...they disappear so incredibly fast.  I've also used this as a base as an 'egg salad' type dish to spread on crackers and whatnot.  Also a success. Cant go wrong with this one!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It turned out pretty good. Overall, it was my first time making deviled eggs and I was impressed by how easy it was. I had my husband and neices test them and they both liked it.

My three sons cooked for me this Thanksgiving to give me a break...and this was one of the recipes they picked...boy were these a hit...they were gone before they hit the table!

We made more the next day...because everyone kept talking about them!

This one's a keeper!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Great change from your normal Deviled egg recipe.  I used sharp cheddar to give it an extra zip and it turn out great.

GREAT recipe! I made these for myself right after I delivered my son. It was perfect food to have in the fridge for post-delivery nurishment. When I was completely out of it, tired, or too busy to cook, it was really nice to be able to reach in and grab some protein. I now make these for all my friends when they have babies! One thing I do to make assembly a little easier...I cut up the bacon before I fry it. It makes it easier to cook and crumble afterwards.

It's the kind of recipe I wonder why I never created it myself. It's yummy. And easy. For large parties I tend to make several kinds of Deviled Eggs and these rank among the top.

Great recipe - thanks a million.  Took these to work and they were fighting over the last few.  Gone in a flash.  I did not have cheese so I left it out - still wonderful!  I eyeballed the mayo & mustard since I know my measurements by look, when it’s creamy enough, and a taste. Try this recipe- its finger lick’ in good!

These were very good and tasty.  I added a little bit more bacon, so I think that it made it a bit more salty than I would have liked.  But everyone seemed to enjoy them and I will make them again.

These were a hit with my family & friends! I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic. Will definitely be making these again! I love trying new twists on old classics!

These turned out great! The only thing I changed was substituting sour cream for mayo. My party guests ate these so quickly I only wish I had made more.

Loved the bacon but they were a little too salty for me. Possible too much mustard.

These are delicious and simple to make.  I made these for tailgating and they were snatched up as quickly as I could put them on a tray.

These were a hit. We had friends over for dinner and I overheard one of them say that these were the best deviled eggs he put in his mouth. My husband actually ate them.

My Easter company and I thought these were delish!  The only change I made was using a little less mustard (1 1/2 tsps.)  What a yummy way to get rid of the 75 Easter eggs my kids colored.  I will make this recipe every year!

I was not real impressed. I guess I just prefer plain regular deviled eggs. I think there was too much mustard. It may be better with less.
