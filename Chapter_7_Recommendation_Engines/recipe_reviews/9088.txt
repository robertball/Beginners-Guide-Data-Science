These are to die for! I make these sweet potatoes every holiday we get! :)

Make sure you boil the sweet potatoes until just a tad bit under done. That way when you cook them in the butter and brown sugar, they'll cook the rest of the way there and not break up and turn to mush.

edited to add...you need to add another 3/4 cup brown sugar to make the sauce not runny. I also cut the orange juice a tad too.

These were yummy!  I used 3 large sweet potatoes and instead of baking for boiling them, I microwaved them until finished and then peeled the skin off and cubed them.  I also added a cinnamon spice mix to give it some flavor while cooking...I think that made them even better!  My husband loved them!  I had it as a side dish to "awesome honey pecan prok chops".  SO YUMMY!  O

I liked the potatoes, and do agree that they are not overly sweet, but I thought it was difficult to get the potatoes to the right consistency. My advice: leave them slightly firm before adding them to the sauce. After cooking for 20 more minutes, mine were too soft and mushy.

YUM!  These turned out great!  (Even better than my mom's.)  I used canned sweet potatoes/yams.  I turned the heat to high the last few minutes to carmelize them.  I also added a tad more brown sugar to thicken.  They were wonderful and I will make them every year for the holidays!

These candied sweet potatoes turned out pretty good!  It wasn't the easiest recipe because it did not specify how "large" the sweet potatoes had to be, so I eye-balled it since I bought JUMBO sweet potatoes.  RESERVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME for this recipe....the sweet potatoes have to boil (or cook depending on which way you do this recipe), the butter, brown sugar, and O.J. have to mix thoroughly.  And then the "Candied" process begins...which takes around 20-25 minutes of attention, sturring, and a careful eye.  All in all, I like this recipe, I wouldn't give it 5 stars for preparation, probably 4.  But 5 out of 5 stars for taste.  My family enjoyed it!  Happy Holidays!

This is a great and easy recipe.  There are a lot of inconsistencies with these reviews for a few reasons.  Two large yams are aprox 2 lbs., so a large yam may be small to one and considered 'large' to another.  The orange juice potency makes a difference too.  I've made them twice and had a different outcome with the same measurements.  The purer the OJ, the stronger the taste.  I prefer the 'concentrate'.  Not overbearing.  Overall, it is an idiot proof dish.  It is a bit mushier than it states - but who cares? It tastes great!

This recipe was easy to make and was very good but, I thought it had a bit of an overbearing OJ taste to it.  Still a delicious recipe though.....

I had bought fresh sweet potatoes and was searching for a recipe that I could use for them.  When I found this one I thought it sounded very easy and tasty but I didn't have any OJ!  I looked around my kitchen for a substitute and decided to use Diet Root Beer instead.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I also added some cinnamon and when they were cooked and plated, I threw on a dollop of marshmallow fluff (it melts over the hot potatoes) and YUM!  I only gave 4 stars because of the changes I made--but these were delicious!!  My boyfriend ate just about the entire pot!

As someone who likes my sweet potatoes sweet, these were excellent.  I used apple juice because it's what I had. The brown sugar got nice and syrupy, and they reheated well.  Great recipe, and I can't wait to try it with maple cream.

Fantastic way to prepare sweet potatoes!  I've finally found the ticket to getting my picky little one to scarf down an orange vegetable!  It took much longer than 20 minutes for me to get the sauce to caramelize, but it was well worth the wait!  Thanks!

Fantastic way to prepare sweet potatoes!  I've finally found the ticket to getting my picky little one to scarf down an orange vegetable!  It took much longer than 20 minutes for me to get the sauce to caramelize, but it was well worth the wait!  Thanks!

These were a big hit, even my 6 month old son loved them!  I didn't use the OJ for our Thanksgiving meal, (wasn't sure that it would come out good and didn't want to disappoint everyone) next time I make these I will definitely use the OJ but even without it they were fabulous!

Great recipe. Kids loved this. I used a can of sweet potatoes and just mixed in the other ingredients. Very quick and easy.

This was really good, but a little orange-y for my taste.  Next time, I will use 1/2 water and 1/2 orange juice.  

I used a 2.5 lb can of "yams," mixed up the liquid ingredients (adding a teaspoon of cornstarch in a little cold water), heated it a to melt the butter, then added the canned yams.  Simmered for 15 minutes, the sauce was the perfect amount and consistency.  I like this recipe.

Very good tasting. My only complaint was that the sauce was too "watery" next time I will add some cornstarch to it to thicken it up better.

I should have thickened the sauce with more brown sugar as recommended, and next time I will broil the potatoes just a bit right before serving to see if that helps create a bit of candy "crunch."

Easy, great tasting, will be using this again. Definitely watch the sweet potatoes, though, when on the stove -- mine turned to mush, so presentation wasn't great, but if you closed your eyes, all you noticed was the taste!

It took too long to cook over the stove; I ended up putting the yams and sauce into a casserole dish and baking them, with minimal supervision.  I occasionally basted the yams with the sauce, so they wouldn't get dried out.  They turned out fine; my hubby really liked them. For that classic look, I dropped some marshmallows over the top after I turned off the oven.

I've only used fresh sweet potatoes once before for a project in high school. Very easy recipe for someone with no experiance and very tasty for my very picky dad. Probably will use more OJ next time I make them.

These sweet potatoes were really yummy but the sauce never thickened up. I added more brown sugar as suggested and removed the skillet from the heat after but the sauce was still really runny. While they tasted good I think I will keep looking for another sweet potatoe recipe.

This is the way I remember my grandmother making candied sweet potatoes every Thanksgiving! My husband never had them this way before, and he loved the recipe. This is a definite keeper!

We just finished Christmas Dinner 2005 which included your wonderful recipe.  My husband loved them and although I don't eat them, I thought the sauce had a delightful blend of flavors.  Thank you for a recipe made from scratch, not can.
