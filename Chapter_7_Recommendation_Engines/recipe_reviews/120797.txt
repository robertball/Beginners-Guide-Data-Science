Wow these are really good. I wanted something different to make for breakfast today and since it was going to be cold in the morning these sounded perfect. For the dough I only had a 12 oz can of evaporated milk so I used that minus 4 T of the milk. And it was not tough at all for me. Also instead of splitting the dough in half and rolling it out twice I just rolled it out into one long piece. I used frozen blueberries in this recipe and was skeptical of the footnote saying not to thaw them, but it worked great. To cut them I used floss. This makes it very easy to slice without squishing everything out of the rolls. I did not get 24 out of this recipe but I cut my rolls a lot bigger. I got 12 good sized rolls out of it though. Which I prefer the bigger ones. I made these the night before so after I cut them and put them in the pan I covered with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge. In the morning I pulled them out when I started preheating the oven. It works perfectly. I did change the frosting. I used a cream cheese frosting instead and it was really good. I used 4 oz cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, and 1 t vanilla and a little milk until it was the right consistency that I wanted. The sauce that is in the bottom of the pan when it is done baking is really good to spoon over the rolls. Don't let it go to waste! Will make this again.

FANTASTIC!   I just loved the bread dough.   I followed the recipe exactly.   (HINT:  10oz of milk equals 1-1/4 c.)   The dough has a wonderful texture and is super easy to work with.  I did have a difficult time rolling them, but that was because I used fresh blueberries.   I really believe frozen would work best since they are soft and mushy.  Just make sure you thaw them first because bread dough has to be warm in order to rise.   If you use fresh, go with small blueberries that are less than 1/4” round.  I used fresh blueberries that were large.  Most were 1/2” in diameter.  It was difficult to get a tight roll around them and the berries kept falling out when placing in the pan.  The blueberries also cooked down during baking and left large gaps between the layers.   No harm to the quality of the roll, just frustrating for me.

These were really good!  I used 12oz evaporated milk minus 4T, bread flour, orange zest, frozen blueberries and a cream cheese frosting.  I made these as directed, but after cutting (with dental floss), I put them into glass baking dishes and stored them in the fridge overnight.  The next morning, I pulled them out of the fridge as I was preheating the oven and baked at 375 for 23 minutes.  They were a great alternative to cinnamon rolls and will be a Christmas morning tradition in our house from now on!

What a beautiful and delicious pinwheel!  The dough was so easy, smooth and soft to deal with that I may give it a try for a regular cinnamon bun.  The lemon and cinnamon pairs perfectly with the blueberries.  The only difference I did was to use milk instead of water in the icing.  Next time I may even give a cream cheese frosting a try.  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe that is a definite keeper!

This was a great recipe. I rubbed grape jam as a layer on the dough before putting the sugar mixture on it. I also added some brown sugar instead of just white sugar. It turned out delicious! Thanks.

I am surprised these little bits of goodness don't have more reviews. I did make a couple of changes after reading all the reviews and by what I had on hand. First I used 8 oz 2% milk instead of evaporated milk(DS is allergic to all canned and powdered milk), used 1/2 bread flour, 1/2 Ap flour, and added a tsp almond extract. I doubled the filling(and am sure glad I did) and used frozen blueberries. the dough was light and very easy to work with. even though I used frozen berries they still fell out as I was cutting, and I didn't get to roll the dough tight enough. no worries any berries that fell out I just placed on top of the rolls gave an extra sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. added 3 oz cream cheese to the glaze. these little babies are great. I say little because if you cut them into 24 they are little and didn't require 20-25 mine were done 15-18 min. next time I will cut bigger. this recipe is as if a cinnamon roll and blueberry pie had babies!kids are already asking if I can make them to take camping.

I love this recipe..they turned out perfect! I can not figure out why a couple of the reviews were not a 5 star.  This recipe is very good just follow it. I will make this over and over again, my family loves these. They were tired of my cinn. rolls.

First of all my final product was great.  However, when I looked at the time it took from start to finish I was wondering how in the world it was going to take 50 minutes total for an yeast dough to rise in say 30 minutes. It should have said 3 hours total (prep, rise, bake).  I did not have any berries but on the advise of another review I made plain and they totally awesome.  If you are confused with the 2-5oz cans, then ONLY USE 1 REG CAN OF EVAPORATED MILK and measure the amount you need in glass measure cup. I used a reg kitchen themometer to measure the milk and butter then allowed the yeast to sit for 5 minutes to proof.  Thanks for the recipe will definatly use it again.

I am surprised that more people haven't tried this recipe yet.  I didn't use the recipe for the dough because I have my own tried and true sweet dough recipe.  But I used the filling and it turned out wonderful.  I used frozen blueberries and didn't have any trouble having them staying in the dough as I rolled.  I did as one past reviewer did and put these in the fridge overnight.  I pulled them out in the morning and let them sit for about 30 minutes before baking.  I put the vanilla glaze on them (also from this site), and the whole pan was gone during breakfast!

I really hate giving bad reviews, they can be hurtful. But I have to say, these weren't my favorite. I found that the blueberries didn't stay in the dough, so when I was slicing, they would pop out so that when I when to put them on the pan they were a bit of a mess. I ended up pressing most of the blueberries back into the pinwheels before I could bake them. Also I wasen't very fond of the bread dough part, I found that it was pretty tough, but that could have been a mistake on my part, maybe I kneaded too much. My Father and grandmother liked them though! Thanks anyway for the recipe!

I tried this recipe today
1. Prep time is for mixing only, does not include rising time, add 3 hrs
2. 10 oz is 1 1/4 cups
3. Use brown sugar in filling as it is nicer. 
I also have a warming option in my oven so I used that to raise the dough, blind sight quicker then waiting hour and half. I did same thing on 2nd rise as well, but don't do what I did, I forgot to put a wet towel on them and the tops went a bit dry, but didn't really effect the finished product. 
I did get 24, but think will make them a bit larger next time and either do 18 or 12.  Someone said to thaw the frozen berries before putting them in as it won't rise.....not so...mine rose fine with frozen berries an they didn't bleed all over, or fall out of the dough either. It made the dough easier to cut actually as they were not mushy.
This is a nice alternative to cinnamon rolls, but think next time will double the filling....my personal choice.

This was excellent. It was easy to make and everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was added a little brown sugar to the filling. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious.

Very nice.  I admit to wanting a little more blueberry taste, but it makes sense there isn't an infusion of blueberries; the blueberries, after all, take the place of where raisins would normally be.  This is rather easy, and makes a lot.  I halved it so we wouldn't have a huge number of rolls that I didn't know what to do with.  I kept the amount of sauce the same since bf is obsessed with "gooey" rolls, but it wasn't quite enough for him.  I'll have to try a gooey-er sauce or something if I make them again.  the dough was a tad sticky but easy enough to work with, and the rolls rose within 30 mins in a warm oven.  thanks for the recipe!

I was a little disappointed.  It might as well have been made out of biscuit mix and not with yeast.

I'm showing 5 stars so I don't decrease the overall rating but I haven't tried these.  I have a question before I start.  I see some have made the rolls and put them in the the fridge overnight to bake the next morning.  When you do that do you allow the rolls to rise until doubled before covering and putting in the fridge or do you put them in the fridge directly after cutting and placing in the pan?  I really want to try these but I'd hate to go to all the work and ruin them before I even bake them and since I'm no early bird it would work out best if I could make them them night before.  I'd love to hear your response!

Don't know what I did wrong.  My dough didn't rise at all.  They just came out dense, not soft and puffy.  They look so good though.

These are a nice simple roll to make.  They have a light lemon flavor.  Next time I'll make a thicker glaze though.

I made these minus the blueberries (I just wanted to make a standard sweet roll).  They turned out really well.  My dad polished off a pan of 12 in a day!  I had extra butter so I brushed it on top of the rolls before their second rise.  The yeast didn't proof for me, so I started again and it still didn't proof like normal but I decided to try anways and they did end up rising (lesson learned: don't waste a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and almost a stick of butter)!

These are quite good. I had a few raspberries in the freezer so I threw those in as well. I also only had a 12oz can of milk so I took the suggestion of Rae and took out 4tbs. I did use the glaze as per the recipe but next time think I will use Raes that she listed her for the creme cheese frosting. All in all a good solid recipe that tastes great as well as making the house smell great!!

I made the dough in my bread machine (so much easier!).  I used fresh blueberries and pressed them into the dough before rolling it up and had no issues with the blueberries falling out.  I loved the lemon in this.  I think next time I would increase the cinnamon filling, as it was barely noticeable.  Thanks for sharing this recipe (that is now on TOH website), Betsy Stoner!

Excellent dough.  Would have given it a five star rating if blueberries had a stronger taste.

I would not recommend putting these in the fridge over night to bake in the morning, with frozen blueberries, my first attempt resulted in a soggy mess of thawed blueberry juice on the bottom (A waste of Ingredients).  My second attempt I used fresh blueberries, and they turned out perfect!

These were delicious! I made up a glaze using sour cream, milk, butter and powdered sugar. I like these better than cinnamon rolls. They are even delicious warmed up the next day. I will definitely be making these again.
