This was a five star recipe for sure for a number of reasons.  This review will be a little long but it is simply my observations since I made it exactly as called for.  First I highly recommend you watch a video on how to cut the chicken, it is easy, do not be intimidated by this.  The reduced cook time make the small effort so worth it!!!  Second, you can use metal skewers to keep the shape,  cross them diagonally through the breast meat and then into the thigh meat. I looked for a smaller bird but 4.5 lbs is the smallest I could find and it only to 1hr and 10 min to cook!  I used a digital Thermometer and it was simple.  The last bit is that I used all the veggies called for, but only half fit in the bottom of the broiler pan so I put the rest on a sheet pan and roasted them.  The veggies from the sheet pan were so nice and crisp, the veggies from the broiler pan were so moist from the chicken juices.  I love veggies, so both ways worked for me!  I served it with Wild Rice as well which was a nice add.  Thanks so much for the terrific recipe!

Excellent!! This was hands down the best roasted chicken I've eaten! The chicken was juicy and evenly cooked. Every piece was delicious and the skin was crispy!! The vegetables were mouthwatering, those on the edges were crispy while the ones under the chicken were softer both soaking up all the flavor & juices of the chicken. As Howard stated in his review I would recommend watching Chef John how to on how to cut the chicken. I did to familiarize myself. My chicken was 8 pounds and cooked in about an hour and a half. I'm definitely making this recipe again and I'm going to season the chicken with thyme, garlic & rosemary. Thank you Diane for such a great recipe.

Oh, myyyyyy....this was so satisfying!, and so easy!  Of course, it does take at least an hour to roast a chicken, so it's probably not going to make the nightly rotation, but the WEEKEND is another story!  The chicken was so tasty and tender, with a crispy skin, as promised.  Be sure to test with a meat thermometer.  Mine needed additional cooking time, even after bringing the bird to room temp.  I loved the roasted potatoes that were on the bottom of the dish, because they caramelized deeply, and I was very stingy with them, lol!  DH went back for seconds on the veggies, and I must admit, so did I.  I served it tonight with a garden salad and some hot, crusty bread, and I know I will serve it again!  My only changes to the recipe were to add some salt and pepper to the veggies, and I used Papa's Seasoning Salt, an AR recipe, on the chicken.  Thank you, Diana!

Tweaks I first marinated the chicken in buttermilk and garlic because I usually do. Didn’t have  yams or sweet potatoes so I used carrots  and they were so yummy. Actually the whole dinner was great. The chicken skin as others have mentioned was sinfully crispy and too good to resist. The chicken was very moist and I’ll definitely make this again.

Very easy and fun way to make dinner -- and, best of all, it's all cooked in basically one large flat baking pan. Kind of a one-pot meal made in the oven. Super juicy and delicious!!!

I am not a chef but this recipe made me look like one! Instead of Olive Oil I used Grape seed oil which is flavorful, healthy and good for cooking at high temperatures. I also added brussel sprouts and cut them in half. I used a grinder with salt-pepper-garlic and no sodium Mrs. Dash. I also added about 1/4 cup of Vegetable broth at the bottom before the vegetables to help add flavor and to baste the chicken as it was roasting. Yummy! This was so good and tasty. The vegetables were great, soft but not mushy because I sliced them thick. This recipe is a winner in my house!

The sweet potatoes thinly sliced and roasted at 400 for one hour under a layer of thinly sliced potatoes and onions turned into bland mush.  If I decide to make this again it will be without sweet potatoes.  And the chicken was bland.  Oil, salt and pepper are simply not enough for me.  I was raised in a predominantly Italian neighborhood so I'm used to savory flavors.  The recipe has potential though and this was the first time I did the 'spatchcock' thing and I'm always glad to try something new so...

I wanted to try something new and different with chicken so it was fun to do a spatchcocked chicken which I haven't done before.  The meal turned out as advertised and really did come out juicy and the vege's crisp and done to perfection (small potatoes and brussel sprouts in my case).  My only criticism is that I want to minimize the amount of fat consumed and the veges really soaked up the drippings.  Of course this makes the meal quite sumptuous, but it added more fat than I wished.  I prefer some alternatives such as roasting the veges separately at the same time.  Or, my favorite method of chicken being a Dutch Oven, or a Beer Can method.  These methods cook in about the same time as the spatchcock (approx 45 min to an hour).  Many people clearly enjoy the recipe, but if you are watching the amount of fat, then be forewarned that the yumminess of this recipe comes from a dose of the drippings.

FABULOUS!  I can't say enough about this chicken.  I had never spatchcocked a chicken before, but, it was so easy to do! The chicken cooked evenly and had crispy skin with unbelievably moist chicken.  I don't think I will ever make a traditional roasted chicken again.  This method is foolproof.  I could see making a turkey this way also.  My sweet potatoes did get a little mushy, but, I think I just sliced them too thin.  Next time I will slice them a little thicker.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, and versatile... I added my own spices and herbs to this as desired in the moment, and used fingerling potatoes halved lengthwise. I also used butter instead of olive oil, and I didn't trust my broiler to cook the chicken evenly without burning it, so I instead placed it in an uncovered roasting pan in a 500 degree oven for 20 minutes (or until brown), then basted it with pan juices, stirred potatoes, covered it, and lowered the temp to 325, for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then I removed the potatoes which were pretty well done by then but still holding together, after stirring them in the juices again, and placed them on a broiling pan. I put them under the broiler for as long as it took to give them a nice crispy browned top, as we like in this house. It was about 10 minutes, but everyone's broiler is different. I did this while the chicken rested and it was perfect. My bf raved over and over about the potatoes (and said the chicken was good too). So sorry this turned into another recipe, sorta. But I hope it helped somebody!

After getting over the spatchcock-intimidation (and watching video on all recipes site), we made as directed (substituted carrots for sweet potatoes and served with mashed yukon golds) and we all determined it was the best chicken we had ever eaten.  DELICIOUS (and the method of spatchcocking definitely gave a more evenly cooked, deliciously moist result)  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very easy method and loved the simple salt and pepper seasoning that allowed the chicken flavor to shine. I placed a cookie cooling rack over a foil lined jelly roll pan as a make-shift broiler pan and it worked perfectly. I sliced my white potatoes on the thick side so they wouldn't be overcooked by the time the chicken was done and used baby carrots since I did not have sweet potatoes. My chicken was a little over 5 lbs so it took longer and the skin was so golden and crispy you didn't dare toss it aside, eating it is a must! .The potatoes were cooked to perfection and so tasty from the chicken drippings!

My first time for spatchcooking, I looked at many different recipes and found many different cooking times. Should have followed the directions, because I slightly undercooked it. The area by the wing was a bit red but it was a tiny spot. I also added baby carrots to the mixture. It came out pretty good. I cut the sweet potatoes a bit thicker like in some of the other reviews, there was a few mushy but were still good. And some of the skin was not crispy but that was my fault. Oh and don’t let someone who can’t cut a chicken attempt to cut it. Mine was demolished, I will cut it before tacking to a pot luck.

A little bland for my taste, but that can be easily remedied. I've been butterflying  chicken for several years now, though I never cook a hard-to-find 3-lb chicken a full hour.  To add flavor I mix together a tbsp or two of  butter and some deli-style mustard, thyme, pasted garlic, salt, and maybe another herb or two. I then loosen the skin and spoon the butter mixture under it. With my fingers I massage the butter from outside the skin until spreads evenly over the breasts (where moisture is needed) as well as the leg-and-thigh quarters.  Then I either spray cooking oil on the skin or I use olive oil. (The oil helps the skin get crisp.)  A butterflied chicken cooks much more evenly, leaving the breast still moist when the legs and thighs are done, and a chicken prepared this way also cooks more quickly.

I  have now made this twice in the past month...and it was scrumptious each time. "Spatchcocking" is now firmly in my repitoire!  Made several little tweaks based on other's suggestions. First, after removing the backbone from the chicken, I salted both sides and let it sit for 30 minutes to draw moisture out.  Then I dried the chicken with paper towels before re-salting and pepper...and also added dried rosemary and thyme to each side.  Cut potatoes and sweet potatoes a bit thicker than I did the 1st time, but the sweet potatoes still turned to mush...but it is still yummy nonetheless.   Lined bottom of broiler pan with foil and sprayed with olive oil before placing salted and peppered potatoes and sliced onions in....chicken on slotted broiler pan on top.  My 5-1/2 pound chicken was done in 70 minutes at 400 degrees (instant read thermometer at 165 in meaty part of thigh.)  A 10-star worthy recipe!!!!

It was absolutely delicious. I don’t have a broiler pan, so I used a cooling racking top of a rectangular baking pan. The skin was incredible, the meat was juicy and the veggies were juicy and soft. Highly recommendable.

I substituted white potatoes for brussel sprouts due to my diet plan. I also used more seasoning than salt and pepper on the chicken just because I usually do. I didn't use any oil either. The chicken was so juicy, which is hard to accomplish with breasts parts. I'll definitely make this again.

This was a delicious recipe!  The only changes I made was to add thyme, rosemary and garlic powder as another reviewer suggested.  The house smelled incredible as it cooked!  I also removed the skin, purely for health reasons.  The meat was tender and juicy, and the potatoes and onions were cooked to perfection.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe just upped my chicken game. It was a great way to roast a whole chicken. A great way to save some money as whole chickens go for 52¢ a pound on sale. Spachcocking the chicken made it super fast and super easy and very moist. The only change I made in preparation was to separate  the skin under the breasts, thighs, and legs and pack it with fresh minced garlic and olive oil, mixed with salt pepper and basil (I used dry but fresh would be even better). Used a roasting pan and more veggies can be used. I used two large yams and four russet potatoes then seasoned with ground salt and pepper- they were amazing.
