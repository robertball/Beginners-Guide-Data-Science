Wow this is truly a comfort food recipe for the fall and winter moths!  I left out the corn and tomato soup but the rest was awesome!

A very tomato-ey stew.   I thought it was pretty good, but it didn't thicken up, so I did have to add a cornstarch/water mixture to give it a little more of a gravy consistency.  I did add in some extra beef bouillon, because I didn't feel that it had a meaty enough flavor.   I liked the method in this recipe.
