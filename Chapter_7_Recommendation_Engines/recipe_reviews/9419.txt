Here's the secret.... forget the fresh/frozen cranberries.  Use CRAISINS (dried cranberries) and add 1 cup of chopped pecans if you like.  Ta da!  PERFECT consistency FIRST TIME....!

This recipe is delicious, and on the third try, I got it to set beautifully.  It takes longer than 5-7 minutes to boil the cranberry/corn syrup mixture down to the right consistency, which should be jam-like.  It took me more like 10-15 minutes.  If too much liquid is left in the mixture, the fudge will be runny and if you boil it too much, the cranberries will dry out and get crunchy and the fudge will be very hard.  

To set the fudge you should also let it sit for 12-24 hours in the fridge. If it's too tart for your tastes, mix some condense milk in with your evaporated milk to sweeten it up.

mmmm!

Yummy, but I couldn't get it to set. No problem - I froze it, rolled it into balls, dipped it in chocolate and made the most wonderful truffles. Melt 1/8 lb parafin with 1 lg. bag chocolate if you'd like to do the same.

I used 1 1/4 cups cranberries instead of the whole bag. I boiled for 7 minutes and my fudge set with no problem. I did mix the vanilla, sugar and milk together before hand I don't know if that makes any difference and I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I really liked the mix of sweet and tart, however I used generic semi-sweet chocolate and I think it showed in the quality. Next time I will user higher quality chocolate but I will definitly be making this again.

The fudge is very good but it didn't set up for me.  Any suggestions on what I might have done wrong?  Would make it again if it would get firmer.

tastes great, doesn't set.  Could anybody find out what to do to make it set?  I too would make it again if it would set.

The reason why ur fudges did not set is coz' of TOO MUCH of CRANBERRIES.  The original recipe calls only for 1 1/4 (1.25) cups of cranberries & not a 12-oz package which is like 2 cups/more of em'.  You'll get a fabulous fudge that sets in a few hours.  I also added a few drops of orange extract since orange flavor works well with cranberries & a handful of finely chopped walnuts.  AND BOY!! WAS THE FUDGE YUMMY !!

This is very good but it did not set for me. I rolled it up in nuts instead and it was really good.

turned out great!  I used a new product called Berry Bits (sweetened cranberry).   It gives it a little less tart but still a great taste

I live in Alaska and pick all my own wild cranberries.  This is an excellent recipe
for your leftover berries and if you aren't a huge chocolate fan but like a bit of 
'tart' in your sweets.  I took it to work for Christmas goodies and it was a huge hit!  
Next time I will make it in the disposable tin pans (this was my first attempt at 
fudge).  It  was tricky trying to get the fudge out of the pan.  
A highly recommended recipe!

I boiled the mixture for almost a half hour- the result looked like jam- but it wasn't 3tbs worth- more like a cup's worth of cranberry jam.  I tasted it as I was pouring it into the pan- so bitter!!!  It definately needs more sweetness- it is very tart.  So far it seems to be setting up quite nicely in the fridge- but it is not sweet at all. Maybe using milk chocolate chips would help?  Definately plan on boiling it for at least 20 minutes instead of the 5-7 the recipe states.

Nope, won't set.  I made truffles as another reviewer had suggested.  They've been in the FREEZER for 2 days and they are now at a normal truffle consistency.  Better off using your fav. fudge recipe and adding craisins.  I also added a couple T of cocoa and 1/2 t. of almond flavoring to nullify the chocolate chip taste.

I made this with dried cherries plumped with raspberry juice as I do not like the tartness of cranberries. It got rave reviews at work! Excellent!

Great taste but it didn't set for me. I made exact to the recipe and will freeze it and roll in nuts or powdered sugar. It did take longer than 5-7 minutes to cook. I will make this again with some adjustments and hope it will turn out. Even though it doesn't look great it had a wonderful taste.

The fudge didn't set up for me, but I froze and shaped into balls which I coated with chocolate. It was so delicious which is why I am giving it 5 stars despite not setting up. I will definitely make again with fresh cranberries.

tried this cranberry recipe with white chocolate...was trying to replicate a cranberry fudge I liked from Mackinac Island.  Fudge did not ever firm up the way it should have....stayed too soft...will try again letting cranberries cook down even more...perhaps no liquid required or more white chocolate would achieve desired results.  Tried the craisins too but they do not achieve the desired tartness I am looking for.
