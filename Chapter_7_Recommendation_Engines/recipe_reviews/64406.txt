This idea still appeals to me. However, made with that much canned meat for the egg, the egg just disappears and I have stuffed my eggs with deviled ham. The proportions are way off. I'm going to try it again with the smaller can of deviled ham.

We did not care for the deviled ham in this recipe.  I guess we are just too hung up on 'regular' deviled eggs.

These eggs are SO good.  They add nice new twist to ordinary eggs.  I added a touch of mustard to the yolk mixture to give it a little zip.  This recipe is definately a keeper!!  Thanks!!

Ham and eggs; what could be better? However, because I don't like processed stuff, I used real ham which I ran thru my food processor. Couldn't help but add a bit of mustard. Very good and thanks for something a bit unique!

this is one of the better recipes i have tried, i also added a touch of white vineger, a small amount of onion powder, a little garlic powder, and a little bit of cajun seasoning, but its still great without adding anything, thanks.

This is a great base recipe that can built on or served as is. I prefer Dijon mustard and spice brown which I divide in half. To keep the smooth consistency I strain the relish, I also add a few dashes of Tabasco and a few dashes of worsteshire sauce for a little more flavor. You can also add a small amount of vinegar

I've been making deviled eggs this way for years, minus the pickles and olives. Usually add a bit of minced onion. Every time my house church has a picnic, this is everyone's first request.
