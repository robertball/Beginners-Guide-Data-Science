This was wonderful, and SO easy.  I made just a couple of changes.  I used probably 7 TB of butter instead of the 8 called for.  I also substituted all-purpose flour plus 1.5 tsp baking powder plus 0.5 tsp salt since I didn't have self-rising flour.  I also added some cinnamon and vanilla to the batter.  It was excellent, with a perfect texture and just the right sweetness.  It took right about 1 hour in my oven, though I never got a "clean" toothpick out of the center since it was always covered with blueberry juice.  Perfect!  Thanks so much.

This was pretty good but as other reviewers have said it has too much butter! If I make this again I would probably cut the butter in half.

Okay ...I said that I would let you know.  Tons of butter ... BUT ... this is something that is eaten on rare occasions (at least I would) ... but I must say ... this is a w o n d e r f u l recipe ... and I give it five stars ... but only for guests or on occasion.  As I stated previously, I used blueberries, one apple and a couple handfuls of raisins (soaked in rum) ... I didn't have enough blueberries ... it turned out SO FAB I CAN'T TELL YOU.  Next time I will try peaches or apricots or whatever is handy and in season at the time ... juicy fruits are better.  Yum recipe to be used over and over and over again because of its easiness and its versatility and it's yummyness.  I totally recommend trying this recipe as stated with a changeover in fruits if you like.  I won't cut down on the butter ... but I won't make it often with this amount of butter.  I used a soufflet type dish ... one of those round white sizeable ones.  GO FOR IT!!!

I make this all the time with various fruits, and in a 9 x 13 pan.  I usually cut down on the sugar a bit though.  It's such an easy recipe to remember and I love that.  One stick, one cup, one cup, one cup....  If you use the 9 x 13 pan only bake it for 35-40 minutes.

After reading reviews I decided to make it a little different. First I was using fresh picked blueberries from here in Alaska. So I added about 4 tsp more sugar because some were a little unripe. I also added 2 tsp of flour so help absorb any excess liquids. I didn't have self rising flour so I followed the 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt directions someone else suggested. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon and .5 tsp nutmeg. I baked it convection as well. However it still took me 60 min to bake it. I think it was due to the excess moisture from the fresh berries and washing them. I feel like it could have used more sugar, but otherwise it was pretty good.

So easy with a few changes that I made! So simple! I used half the amount of butter, added 1.5 tsp of baking powder and .5 tsp salt with all purpose flour, and added a 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. Came out PERFECT... I also didn't have all the blueberries so I just used the one full cup that I had and it was still wonderful! I served it hot with chocolate ice cream.

As previously stated, around 6 Tbl spoons of butter is plenty. I also took the advise of others and added cinnamon and vanilla. It was great! My mother always added pecans to her cobblers, I think I might try that next time, it adds a nice crunch.  I also want to try it with peaches. Even my super picky husband loved it. He was still talking about it the next day.

This recipe is just okay. I've been looking for an old fashioned cobbler recipe and tried this one. I would consider myself a moderately good baker, and this really leaves something to be desired. First of all, it uses WAY too much butter, and I love butter. I cut the butter amount to 5 TB, and that was still plenty, if not too much. It definately needed vanilla, so I added some of that. The texture was just off, not like a cobbler. It was overly sticky and greasy, which I think affected the overall texture. I really can't put my finger on it. It wasn't bad, just not what I was going for. Overall, I may need to keep searching for a good cobbler recipe! This just wasn't it for me.

I used all purpose flour instead of self rising flour and the batter did not rise. This would have been a good recipe if i had not made that mistake.

Amazing. I used wild Maine blueberries (frozen) and took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut the butter quantity in half and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter. My teenage son took one bite (paired together with vanilla ice cream) set his bowl down and came and gave me a hug. I guess that means he likes it, haha. And it really does taste amazing. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Whoa, butter overload!  1/2 cup of butter was too much, for me.  And the layering is weird for me too.  Needs tweaked.

Horrifically bad and ended up down the disposal.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was swimming in butter with a thick, sticky dough that never became cake-like no matter how long I baked it.  A waste of good ingredients, I'm sorry to say.

Make your own self- rising flour by mixing flour, 1 1/2 t baking powder and 1/2 t salt. First time I made as directed, just added extra blueberries. It was truly amazing. Second time I lightened it by using 5 T butter and 1/2 c sugar. Again extra fruit. I've also made it with peaches (mixed with cinnamon). All is great!

I just added a little vanilla extract and a bit of cinnamon sugar to the flour mixture and it came out awesome! Just a tad paranoid about the amount of butter, but I plan to use less and substitute the blueberries for blackberries next time. Taste just like my grandma used to make as a kid.

I was looking for a recipe to replicate one that won a 'picnic' throwdown, and she said it was her grandmother's recipe, with simple ingredients, flour, milk, sugar, baking powder, and blueberries. This was the closest recipe I could find to that description. Her edges were carmelized, and when asked about that, she said she sprinkled some sugar on top. I did read many reviews, which said to reduce the butter, but I love butter, and thought that might be key to the caramelization of the batter portion, so I went with the full stick. She also said that no matter what kind of fruit you use, it will turn out great, so I used fruit I had on hand, blueberries, cherries, apricots, and mangoes. I definitely got the caramelization, but I had to bake it an hour and a half. Hers had showing on top 50/50 fruit and chewy dough, mine mostly fruit, so next time I will pour in batter, some fruit, and some batter on top. I can see where someone said the 1/2 cup butter made it goopy, which it did at the one hour mark, hence adding 10 minutes 3 times to total 90 minutes to get past goopy. I got what I wanted though, slightly chewy caramely edges and to die for fruity cobbler.

I loved it and it's super easy to make. The first time I made it with blueberries as instructed. It came out syrupy and good! My husband loved it. I caught him up in the middle of the night snacking on it. Lol The second one I realized I was out of a few ingredients  when it was too late. I decided to use strawberries this time since I had some that needed to be used.  I was out of self rising flour so used regular flour and added salt and baking powder. Out of white sugar so substituted with equal measure of brown sugar. I'm thinking ok good I have everything else...until I opened the fridge to take the milk out and its empty. So, I throw in a half teaspoon of vanilla, an egg & half a can of sweetened condensed milk. Then a half a cup of water to thin out the canned milk and followed the rest of the recipe. It came out fantastic. You can literally change up everything and it's still delicious!

It was really easy, and I didn't think too much butter HOWEVER, I found I didn't have milk on-hand so used Almond Milk (unflavored, unsweetened).  I found the edges a bit chewy - not sure if it was the almond milk or if my oven cooked hotter than it should have, but overall was very pleasing.

It was really easy and simple. I followed it exactly, except, I used mix berries instead of blue berries.

The best thing about it were my blueberries. I don't know. I'm not sure what happened. I doubled the recipe because I love blueberries. I used a glass 9x13 baking dish because I doubled it. I added a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla & almond extracts. (the only changes I made other than doubling it.) I measured the ingredients, followed the instructions & it came out rubbery. Yuck.

Ok I never had or made a cobbler before. Is it supposed to be so gooey?  I followed recipe exactly. I am not a fan of gooey things( I hate pie but according to hubby, I rock at making them).  I used fresh picked berries from today.

It was delicious!
I never had cobbler before  and honestly didn't know what to expect. I used Splenda instead of sugar. 
I expected a “pie-like”.
My Girlfriend accurately describes it as “like a muffin, but way better”... 
It really was scrumptious , I plan to try different fruit next time.

2nd time making this. I used less butter (1/3c) it’s still a little bit much. I’ll try 1/4 next time. I used salted butter and 3/4c sugar instead of my usual full sugar amount and a pinch of salt. Sweetness is just right! I used buttermilk left over from making banana bread and 1/4c more four. Also added cinnamon and a tiny bit of vanilla. It’s VERY GOOD!!! I took the pic after I cut it though. Boo. Happy baking!

I REALLY wanted to like this. I even made it twice to be fair. The first time was a flop. Since I don't keep self-rising flour at home, I added 1 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp salt as recommended by a Google search. Besides that I followed the recipe as written. Turned out very spongy, rubbery, and flat with WAY too many blueberries. I then read all the reviews and found that those who liked it used 1.5 tsp of flour and 1/2 tsp of salt if they didn't have self-rising flour and used less butter and added vanilla and cinnamon. Soooo, the second time I decreased the butter to 5 Tbls, upped my baking soda and salt, and put in less blueberries. As it was baking it looked SO much better and was rising nicely. But when it was done, it had fallen and, even though it was a little better as far as cake to fruit ratio, it was still spongy and rubbery. I gave it two stars because it wasn't so awful my co-workers didn't eat it, but it certainly isn't worth making again, unless you like flat spongy cake. Then it's just OK. Sorry. This one needs to go back to the drawing board.

I did what another reviewer wrote - 1/2 stick of butter, 1/2 t. of cinnamon, 1 t. of vanilla. I used the 8" square pan and did use the self-rising flour and I used almond milk because I never have whole milk in the house anymore unless I'm buying it for a specific reason. I thought it was delicious! I can't imagine using all the butter as the original recipe states. The next time I will cut sugar just a bit not because the dish was too sweet, just to not use so much sugar.

I don't know if I can rate this fairly because I made some changes and some mistakes.  Thought I'd fill you in on mine so you don't make them too.  

First of all I only had all purpose flour.  I guess you absolutely need self rising.  I didn't notice that before filling or I would have added baking powder or soda (which ever helps as a leavening ingredient) My dough just stuck to the bottom of the pan all gooey.  My fault.

I used almond milk since I can't have dairy and vegan butter.  I know the almond milk would have been fine but not so sure about the butter.  That was a lot of butter for an 8" dessert!  So I don't know if the butter messed up the pastry or if it was the all purpose flour. 

The berries tasted delicious but again very buttery.  Maybe because of the dough but I am not too sure that is just too much butter.  

Takes a lot of berries so it is a bit expensive. We will scoop out the berries and use them on ice cream so they are not wasted.

I rarely review recipes however this was so bad that I don't want anyone else to waste time on this recipe. Too much butter, the cooking time is off, it lacks sweetness even with that much sugar, it is just gross. Literally put it down the disposal. I reread the recipe to see if I missed something, but I didn't. In fact I did everything as written. Horrible.

I decided to skip making this the long version and go with this 'easy' recipe.  The crust is chewy and a huge waste of blueberries.  One star because no stars is not an option.  Don't chince out and make find a longer version that might actually be good.

I used 1/2 cup sugar and a mix of fresh and frozen blueberries. I also added 2 tbsp of vanilla protein powder, 2 tbsp flax seed, 2 tbsp of chopped dates. Next time I will try cutting the butter in half, too. It baked for a full 55 minutes and came out the perfect color and was delicious with a little vanilla, caramel ice cream.

I'm not a chef, but I have no problem falling a recipe and never have a problem. Until this mess. I followed the amounts and directions to the letter. It was awful. Went straight into the trash.  What a waste of good fresh blueberries.

I make this all the time! I just cut the butter down to 4 tbls. And sprinkle sugar on top before I put in the oven. Also just use 2 and half cups of blue berries. My family loves it!

This is good, but there is not enough crust to cover the cobbler in an 8 X 8 inch dish if you follow the recipe. The next time I make it, I will make 50% more crust than the recipe calls for.

Super easy. Really good. Put in extra fruit, all fresh. Used blueberries and raspberries. 

Only suggestion......... use less sugar. It is a bit sweet.

Super tasty and easy.  Also, I would double the recipe, I think
that if you do not, it would be extremely small.

I am making my 2nd one now. I may use 1 less tablespoon of butter. Just for calorie sake!!!

This was a very easy, quick recipe. Blueberries are in season and I wanted to make something  for a summer dessert. I did as others suggested and cut down on the butter. I served it with whipped cream and it was very good.

I also reduced the butter to 6-7 tablespoons, added 1.5 teaspoons baking powder, cinnamon and vanilla to taste,  and 0.5 teaspoon salt. I should have reduced cooking time by 15-20 minutes - 50 minutes was much too long.

I followed directions exactly as stated with the exception of adding some of my homemade vanilla extract and cooking for 50 minutes.  Maybe it would have been fine with a little more cooking, but we couldn't wait!!!

I made this last night for a group and had several compliments. I did it just as written except using all purpose flour with baking powder and salt. I also made a gluten free version with white rice flour for myself, and I was quite pleased with it. I will definitely use this recipe again, and I plan to use other fruits also, especially peaches.

This turned out amazing! We had frozen blueberries available, and the standard substitution for the self-rising flour. 

I know alterations can sometimes mess with a review on a recipe, but this one turned out perfect (even with our limited stock of ingredients!)

This recipe is identical to the one my wife learned from her Grandmother. It's so easy, QUICK and so delicious, it's like desert magic! Use fresh fruit in season, frozen, canned pie filling...what ever fruit you've got. Works great.
I agree with most reviewers who cut back the butter a couple of TBSP, but do you own thing. I make it now but only use about 6 TBSP of butter. WONDERFUL!

This is the best most delicious cake ever!! and so easy to make! However...do use less butter, next time I'll use less that 1/2 a cup its a bit buttery. But otherwise it is absolutely delicious and a no brainer to bake!!! Loved it! will make it many times again for sure. I made it with frozen blueberries and it was awesome! The other thing I will try next time  will be melting the butter in the microwave and covering the baking dish with baking paper so it doesn't stick. You won't be disappointed!

This was easy to make,as you can see I like lots and lots of Blueberrys and I had some Strawberries and threw the in.  I had to double the batter receipt to accommodate my 11 by 9 inch baking pan.  I took it to the Church Cookout. Went fast maybe they were hungry or it was delicious, by the time I got to it, it was gone.  I will make it again.

I made this cobbler for my book club and it was a big hit. The only changes I made were to add 2 tsp. of Mexican vanilla, and bake it in a 9" deep-dish pie plate. I live in Denver (altitude 5280 ft. above sea level) so baked recipes tend to rise a little higher. No need to adjust this recipe for altitude. We all agreed this is a winner; so easy to make, and they all took home the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I was not too sure at first when I saw the consistency prior to going in the oven to bake but it turned out perfect. I did the recipe exactly as written here. Thank you! An incredible dessert to bring to moms for supper going forward .

Super easy and quick. Takes no time and very yummy.  I think I cut back on the butter a bit...just to make myself feel better
