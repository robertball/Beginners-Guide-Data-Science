I loved the fact that this dish utilizes fresh tomatoes.  I added salt, pepper,crushd red pepper, more garlic than called for and used olive oil instead of butter.  It is very healthy and next time I make it, I will include other veggies such as mushrooms and peppers.

I will never buy buy spaghetti sauce again. This was SO good and easy and fast. I did substitute white wine as there was no vermouth in the house and added a small amount of tomato paste to thicken. Great recipe!

I found this recipe to be okay. After reading other reviews, I, too, decided to use olive oil instead of butter. It was very bland, but after I added a tablespoon of sugar, and garlic powder and a touch of oregano, the flavor was a little better. It was very light, and fresh, but needs more flavor for my taste.

This sauce was a big hit at a dinner party that we threw.  We served it over linguine as a complement to the main course, Chicken Marsala.  Everyone kept coming back for more!  Very flavorful and fresh.  note: We substituted olive oil for 1/2 the butter that was called for in the recipe.

It's just to easy to be this good! If you think pasta sauce has to simmer for hours forget it. I served this at a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe. Sometimes I add a tea. of mixed Italian seasonings if no fresh are availible. The Vermouth is the kicker!

This recipe was a train wreck for me, perhaps because I did not use fresh tomatoes?  I had home-made linguine I had to use(I could manage the pasta but not the sauce, go figure) and ended up putting the fresh basil over the warm pasta with olive oil and parm.  That was brilliant.  Except for the tomatoes, I followed the recipe to a T.  I am not sure what went wrong, but it was inedible.  Since I am in the minority, I must assume it was my error, however, I really think the vermouth and tomato are a bad match.  Perhaps a sweeter vermouth vs. extra dry (which I used)?

This was a pretty good sauce - very fresh tasting.  I used campari tomatoes and added a couple of sliced kalamata olives, which really went well.  The pasta absorbed quite a bit of the sauce, which was fine, but if I wanted it a little saucier I would have added a little plain tomato sauce.

Very tasty. Made a few alterations, but that's being a veggie.  First, I sauted some onions with the garlic.  Also, I used veggie stock instead of chicken, and I skipped the dry vermouth.  Very nice flavor, and fresh basil is always such a pleasure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very simple, fast (it helps to have a food chopper/processor for the tomatos) and really tasty.  Now I have a use for that bottle of vermouth that's been around for awhile!

Nice fresh flavor but it was pretty watery.  I even let it cook down for about an hour and reduce by 1/2.

This wasn't thick enough to be called "sauce." It was more like "soup." Plus, the flavor wasn't anything extraordinary.

i consider this a gourmet sauce -- would have never thought to add vermouth, and my tasting while cooking, before adding the vermouth, then after adding vermouth, was a huge and pleasant surprise ... i sliced the romas lengthwise, 4 slices to the tomato, as i like chunky ... next time i will saut√© onions with the garlic, probably a lot, as i like onions in my sauce ... using FRESH basil as the only spice was perfect!!

quick, easy, and so good.  My kids love the "homemade" sauce I work soo hard to make, not knowing that the Best Spaghetti Sauce in the world only takes 10-20 mins for prep/simmers for 40.  Kudos to Mickey for making me a kitchen star!

I found it to be bland and runny. Maybe I did something wrong, but my husband re-read the recipe and I did everything it said to do. I won't make it again. Also, it feeds more than 4!

I added hamburger meat because were big fans of it in our spaghetti. The taste was great after I added a little salt. My only complaint is the sauce is thin, but that could be operator error. Otherwise, I love the vermouth and chicken broth addition!

delicious!  I could add mushrooms or chilis or wine to change it up a little---but it is great just as it is!
