Great flavor in this very easy to follow simple potato soup. I love the dill mixed with the basil. Very light taste. I  did not add the butter, did not think it was necessary, and I added a bit more celery because I love celery - leaves and all. Very tasty for a chilly day meal!

I am calling this magic soup.  It uses simple and inexpensive ingredients and is very filling but is low in fat.  The real magic in this soup is how such simple ingredients create such full flavors. It tastes like it took loads of ingredients and hours of work to prepare. I made it exactly as the recipe was written and I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good! I too use chicken broth instead of water. Before serving I use a stick blender to break up some of the potatoes, makes the soup a bit thicker. As another reviewer does, I save the bacon to  top the individual bowls, along with chives and grated cheddar cheese to garnish.

This was really good, inexpensive, easy, and quick to make. Very good recipe to have in your arsenal. I made a couple of alterations though. I don't really measure so I think I used more carrots and celery than called for. I made a roux instead of adding the milk and butter straight to the soup. I did not used dill, but chives. Just a personal preference. My four year old loved it. Great recipe!!

This soup is simple to make, cheap and good! What more could you ask for? The only changes I made were adding some dried parsley (because I'm trying to use it up!) and thickening it a little with a flour slurry. I just really wish I had some crackers on hand! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe but it was just not my cup of tea.  You do have to be very careful of how much water you put. Best to put little and gradually add than pouring out and losing vegetables.

very good, I like the dill taste.  Also mashed up the potato slightly to give it more of a creamed texture
