Perfection... After reading several recipes and reviews I decided to try this one because it was the first recipe I'd ever seen that uses brown sugar. I was skeptical so I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar to be safe. I was out of butter so I used margarine instead.  I also added two tablespoons of Dutch Cocoa and a splash of cold coffee for an extra kick. I was leary about the temp so I used 350 degrees and baked for 30 mins using a 9 by 11 in. pan.  I discovered this is the identical recipe as Baker's and Hershey's (on the unsweetened chocolate box) with the exception of the brown sugar. For the first time in my life I had perfect brownies! I will never use a mix again. These took some time but they were worth it, absolutely perfect! Gooey inside and crispy outside just the way a perfect brownie should be. One day I will try the recipe in it's orginal form.  I can't wait for my kids to try these. I am topping them with homemade chocolate frosting and m&m's at their request!

Turned out great (gooey and fudgy) with a few modifications. First, I didn't have choc squares so I had to use the cocoa powder/butter ratio on the back of the Hershey's box (I picked this recipe because several reviewers mentioned success with this). Second, I couldn't help myself, I added a dash of clove.  Third, I used roasted walnuts, and a small handful of semisweet chocolate chips.  Fourth, I cooked it for 60 mins at 250, then turned the temp up to 300 for another 20 mins, and they were perfect.  I think it is important to have a glass pan.  Glass and metal cook very differently!

Followed recipe to an art except that I changed the baking temp to 350 and baking time to 30 minutes.  I also used a glass baking dish.  EXCELLENT!  VERY SOFT!

I cooked these as directed @ 250F and they were starting to burn on the edge and were still batter in the middle.  I tried again putting them in at 350F and less time and they turned out perfect.

Great recipe, but the temp. must be wrong because they weren't done that early, had to change the temp. to 350 degrees and cook for 45-50 min. Other than that it's a great recipe.

We were not too impressed with these.  Baking them at 250 did not work, the edges were super crispy and the center was still uncooked.  The flavor was mild and a little too sweet...not even close to chocolatey enough.  I will not be making these again. Sorry!

This is hands down the best brownie recipe I have ever tried.  It's easy to make, and the brownies are deliciously fudgy.  I have to cook them a smidgen more, but if you use a cake tester and keep cooking until it comes out clean, you'll have better luck.  Also, I use a Pampered Chef square baking dish, which I really think makes a difference - I had worse results when I used a plain metal baking pan.  Otherwise, these brownies are wonderful and get rave reviews from everyone I make them for.

Very good brownies, but they weren't very sweet. I will add more sugar next time. Other than that, excellent texture and even better after refrigerating if you like chewy brownies because the butter hardens within the brownies and they are chewier than when at room temp. Oh, and I raised the oven temp to 350 degrees and baked in a metal pan for about 45-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted came out clean.

Definitely did not work for us :(  Temp seemed way too low and wasn't cooking.  Even though we sprayed the pan we practically had to use a sledgehammer and chisel to get them out!!  When you bite into them, some parts were so overcooked and crunchy that I thought I would break a tooth.  Sorry - I see that lots of people had great success with these, but not the case for us.

Wrong temperature.  250 is not enough- must be a mistake.  This only results in chocolate goo.  I see now reading other reviews that it isn't me- the oven temp must be higher.  I have some in the oven and will add 20 minutes more at 350.

I followed this recipe exactly except for cutting the ingredients in half and using an 8 x 8 in pan.  I cooked them for about 25 minutes and they tasted great!

These are good the day you make them, but excellent after being stored in an airtight container overnight. I bake them for about 40 minutes at 350. Try it with a cup or so of finely shredded coconut (mixed in right before the flour).

This is a great recipe!  I did not use the walnuts and took the advice of others and raised the temp to 350.  50 min on the dot was perfect!  No overcooked edges or undercooked middle.  It has a cake texture and we prefer more of a gooey.  Still has wonderful flavor and I will make again!

After they sat overnight they weren't very good.  I don't plan to make them again unless we are having company and there will be no leftovers.

This made a pretty good brownie.  When baked at 350 it turned out just right, though I did follow others' suggestions and drizzle chocolate syrup over the top for that wow factor.  Interesting, though, that after a thorough online search, I found almost exactly the same recipe on the back of the Bakers chocolate that I used!  (They call them one-bowl brownies, and the directions were clearer with less fuss.) I just clipped that out and will use it from now on.

At 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes: delicious!  I substituted a few semi-sweet squares for a few unsweetened ones. A keeper.

I didn't like the recipe at all. I used a glass 8x8 pan at 350 and needed to bake it for 55 min(the last 20 w/foil). I used semi-sweet bars, it was all I had on hand, maybe that was the problem. I used 4.5 oz just to use up my remaining .5 oz. I also added a bag of mint chocolate chips. They were the only thing that saved this brownie. It was really oily and that could've been from the chips, I did not add in the walnuts. For as much chocolate that went into this recipe, this was a really bland brownie. The edges do get crunchy and the middle is soft with a nice shiny crust on top, it turns out pretty.   If you like chocolate and can tell the difference between regular dark chocolate and 60-70% cacao dark chocolate, keep looking, this brownie is not for you. I wasn't wanting something super chocolate-y but I do want to taste chocolate if I've put it in.

The recipe itself is GREAT.  350 for 35 to 45 min depending on pan type (glass or metal) is perfect.  Awesome taste.  Chewy inside, crispy outside- love the texture.  I followed thoughts of another reviewer and used half white and half brown sugar, but left everything else except temp the same.  Brownie nirvana, lol!  I don't think they would be quite as good without the chocolate squares.  My experience in substituting the powdered chocolate/w/butter and water is that it works and tastes good, but is not as rich, so for less experienced cooks, stick with the recipe, but correct the temp.

Really happy with this recipe.  I didn't have any butter (my bad) so I substituted vanilla yogurt.  Worked great!  Will be making these again real soon!

I followed this recipe to a T. After cooking them for over an hour.. I think they tasted like molasses and it had to be the Brown Sugar was Tooo much.. I would like to try again with 1/2 white sugar and see if it would help. The texture was perfect, they were fudgey but flakey and moist, It was the flavor that was bad !!

Gooey, messy, but good, agree with other reviewers, would probably not make it again, would look for a "normal" recipe for brownies before doing this one again, not a big fan of mushy food.  I did follow the recipe exactly.

These brownies were fabulous!  I made them exactly as directed, (because can you rate something fairly if you changed ingredients or temperature?), and they came out fudgy and delicious!  I used a silicone pan and the edges were just crispy chewy, centers melt-in-your-mouth perfect.  You go, Granny!

The texture is great - gooey in the middle and crispy on top.  But they are too sweet - not chocolaty enough!  I would try them again this time using 1.5 times the chocolate.  Maybe even 2x  the chocolate.  You can see from the picture that the brownies are a light caramel color - and they should be a dark chocolaty brown~!  I used a glass pan instead of metal.  Too bad there is so much confusion with the time and temperature....  I just sort of winged it.  I like my brownies really gooey and not cake-like so the undercooked-ness of them was okay for me.

The oven temp on these must be wrong. I cooked for 85 minutes and they still aren't done except for right around the edges. The edges are tasty though. Could use more chocolate taste.

With no leavening agent (baking powder, baking soda), this is not a  cakey brownie.They're chewy along the edges, fudgy in the middle - so long as they're not overbaked. Just at the the point when you think they're done but you're not sure (toothpick in center comes out ALMOST clean) remove them from the oven.  Mmmmmm.

These were good brownies. Very chewy, and people said they sort of tasted like hot chocolate. However, I used sweet chocolate instead of unsweetended, and they turned out very rich.

Turned out great! Very moist, everyone liked them. I cooked them at 350 rather than 250 for 40 minutes. Would make them again.

Delicious brownies! I did take the recommendations of other reviewers and cook them at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes in a glass dish. They came out lovely and moist, but could definitely use some chocolate chips (I LOVE chocolate)

I have made these brownies before and love them!! The only thing I change is the temperature. I cook them at 200 degrees for the first hour and then 350 until done. They never burn or dry out and stay moist. The cooking time is longer but it yields a really moist brownie.

This was the perfect consistency--just what I was looking for in a brownie.  Since I didn't have unsweetened chocolate baking squares, I used the recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa can for the eqivalent of baking squares.  That probably was the stem of the lingering bitter cocoa taste, so next time (if I don't have those squares available), I will use less cocoa.  I also used milk chocolate chunks to add a bit of flavor in lieu of the walnuts.  I served it with vanilla ice cream for afters at a dinner I just hosted, and they were a hit.  Thanks for this recipe--just great!

I followed the recipe exact, only switching out pecans for the walnuts. I did bake these in my Perfect Brownie Pan at 350* for a little over 30 minutes. These are absolutely perfect. One of the best brownies I have ever made. The whole family has fallen in love with them.......they're half gone!

I'm sorry but I can only give this 2 stars because there was definitely something wrong with the temperature or baking time or something. My first mistake was to forego reading the reviews and I would have found out it was an issue. I will make again using reviewer suggestions and re-rate if the result is better.

These have a great thick chocolatey flavor but mine didn't realy ever get solid.  As per other poster's suggestions I cooked them at 300 for 45 min and the outside started to get crispy and almost burned, the toothpick came out clean from one end to the other but when i cut them they were still goopy.  I put them in the fridge which helped them solidify a bit.  Great flavor, just not great baking directions.

These are fantastic!  I questioned the oven temp and time but always use the recipe exactly as written the first time.  Next time I will try 300 as 250 did not cook in a hour.  I read all the reviews and it is difficult to understand how these could be horrible, dry or cakey!  These are, though, definitely only for those that like rich, fudgey, very chocolate brownies!

These were delicious, but I'd say they were about half-way between a cake & a brownie. I'm still in search of the perfect chewy brownie recipe, since my food intolerances eliminate all packaged brands.

My son had a skin lesion biopsied (Came back negative), and I was looking for the perfect treat. I followed the advice of others and used half brown sugar and half regular sugar, and I also baked at 350 for 30 minutes. DELICIOUS!!! My son said they were the best he'd ever had! I'll never make brownies from a box again!

I thought two cups of brown sugar would be a bit heavy for this recipe so I used half brown/half white sugar.  The brownies backed for an hour and a half and were still runny in the center while the outer bits were done to perfection.  Next time I'll bake in a bit larger pan and move the temp up to 375 degrees.

Good recipe.  Want to really serve a special and different brownie, though?  Take your favorite recipe (I swear by the "Silver Pallette" version), but substitute Mexican chocolate for regular chocolate, and chopped toasted hazlenuts for the normal nuts.  The Mexican chocolate has a touch of cinnamon in it, and is less sweet, so you might up the sugar in the recipe if you like your brownies sugary. I moved into a house where previous housemates had left these ingredients in the pantry, and made these brownies from a frugal "what the heck" place.  Friends still talk about them.  Try it.

decent home-made brownies...i only made them because I didn't have a box mix, but they were almost as good. based on some of the other reviews I cooked them at 350 for 45 minutes and covered the edges for the last 15 minutes. I also cooked them in a round pan, which helps keep the corners from being over-cooked. I also didn't have chocolate cubes so I mixed 1/2 cup butter with 4 tablespoons coco powder. Also someone said that it wasn't sweet or chocolaty enough so I added a nice sized squirt of chocolate syrup. They came out tasty and soft, except the edges were still slightly over-done.

I loved these brownies. they were great instead of unsweetened chocolate I used Kaser pure chocolate (aka: Hersey milk chocolate). I used two bars and melted it over the stove so i didn't burn the chocolate in the microwave. It was great!!! It tasted like home which helps when you live abroad!!! trust me.

I couldn't get these to cook quite right. Because of the other comments, and the picture, I added another oz.of chocolate which I believe helped quite a bit. My family prefers fudgier, chocolatier brownies I think. Thanks a lot!

DO NOT USE AN 8X8 PAN!! Of course it'll take hours to bake at that size... I followed Linda's mods:  Half granulated / half brown sugars, added 2 tbs cocoa, a splash of coffee.  I baked 'em at 325 (was roasting a chicken at that temp, as well) and the edges... Oh the edges were charred by the time the middle was "Set".  Now, the middle was good - fudgey and delicious, but my whole brownie experience lies within the 'edge' pieces for the texture contrast.  I didn't get it from this one.

These brownies are everything a brownie should be.  The only thing I changed was to bake them for 60 minutes at 250 and another 15 minutes at 325.  I will definetly make this my favorite brownie recipe!

I made this recipe according to the original recipe, less 1/8 cup butter, as others said it was too greasy. The batter still tasted bland, so I tried adding more chocolate and some peanut butter. 

If I made this again I would try more nuts, more chocolate, less sugar, still add peanut butter, and add more four.

Overall, not a very good recipe

These were great! I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes, then 325 for 20. I also added butterscotch and chocolate chips. These came out lightly flaky on top and fudgier on the bottom.

I just baked this evening. Followed suggestions of others reviewers (increasing temperature and adding 2 tbs of cocoa). This is just ok for me. The surface cracked too much and it's a bit dry. Maybe it's a fault of my oven (i used convection) and not the recipe. May try it next time and decrease amount of flour and baking time.

I quite like these brownies.
Stuff I changed.
1.sugar reduced to 1cup.
2.two tablespoons of cocoa added to the flour.

they turned out fine.but they are rather greasy so I'll reduce the amount of butter the next time.it's kinda cakey but not too light.but it doesn't have the dense kind of texture I want to get in my brownie.

These brownies were good with the adjusted time and oven temperature. Unfortunately, I did not think they were "great". I was looking for a more dense texture in lieu of the cake-like texture that resulted from this recipe.

This was a nice gooey brownie that was halfway between cake and fudge.  It had that nice crusty brownie topping, too.  I made it with my boyfriend and his roommates were drooling over them.  We baked it at about 325° for 45 minutes.  Delicious!

although the texture is amazingly chewy, this is not a good brownie recipe: the brown sugar is definitely overpowering and makes it a sickening dessert. besides, it took me 1 1/2 hour to bake it even after i raised the temperature of my oven.
thumbs down.

These brownies are SOOOOOO incredibly delicious!  I decided to try some "real" brownies instead of the boxed kind I always buy.  When my husband tasted them he said, "wow, so THIS is what real brownies taste like!"  They are best eaten within 1 day of baking, though as they dry out very quickly.  A KEEPER RECIPE!

This is a superb brownie recipe.  They're very moist and fudgy.  They're fast and easy to make.  Melting the chocolate takes the longest, only a few minutes!  It does take awhile to bake, about 1 hour and 20 minutes, but well worth the wait!

The best brownies we have ever had!  I made a few modifications: used 1.5 C of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of organic sugar, added a splash of peppermint extract and baked for 45 minutes at 250 and then 20 minutes at 325.  They were so moist and delicious!  I will definitely make again.

A very yummy brownie!  I made these for a family get-together so I doubled the recipie, baked at 350 degrees for 30 -35 minutes in a 9x12 dish, and added fudge icing (combine 1-1/4 cup sugar and 1 cup heavy cream in saucepan over medium heat about 3 minutes; then heat on low for 7 min. without stirring. Remove from heat and stir in 4 oz baking chocolate and 1/2 cup butter; add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, stir until smooth. Chill in regrigerator about 30 min., stirring every few minutes.) Everyone loved these!

This is a pretty balanced brownie recipe. I think the brown sugar adds a lot of flavor. I made these for my spanish class and they all loved them, though I did over bake them a bit( I baked them at 350 ) but that is fixable. I also added some chocolate frosting too!! Yummy!!

I followed the recipe and the only change was that I left them in the oven about 70 minutes. I loved them!! They were VERY rich and chocolatey. These weren't meant to be cakey brownies.

Unbelievably delicious!  So fudgy and chewy.  The slow bake prevents them from burning or getting cakey.  The brown sugar added a completely new dimension - I used light brown sugar.  I brought these to a Super Bowl party and they were gone in 5 minutes (much to my husband's dismay).  Wonderful recipe!

Just made these and they taste great! Since many reviewers said the cooking instructions were a problem I tried 350 and ended up cooking them for about 45 minutes. At first I tried the cooking time from the one bowl recipe on this site; since this recipe is indentical except that it call for white sugar instead of brown. I checked it at 30 minutes and it was still wet in the middle. In the end I should have taken these out 5-10 minutes sooner. 250 would not have worked, this must be a mistake.   I'll definitely try this recipe again.

As another reviewer pointed out, this is the Baker's One Bowl Brownie recipe - except for the sugar being brown.  That bugs me; but maybe it's been passed on not knowing it was Baker's recipe - or could it be it was a family recipe that Baker's uses?!?  Hmmmm?!?  Mmmmm?!?  ... Okay, I'll stop - & you're welcome!  ;D  ... I like cake like cake & brownies not like cake so I only used two eggs.  Glass dish, 350, upper third of oven, 35 minutes.    'Not all that attractive, but taste is good.  Slightly crispy edges, soft interior; surprisingly, not too sweet.  'Would've liked them thicker though; maybe a 9x11.  This pan won't take long to "empty"!  :)

This is a bit of a weird recipe. I made to directions, using cocoa powder/oil because I didn't have squares on hand. Beat the batter slightly and it was nice & fluffy. Baked at 350 for 30 mins in a 9x9 ceramic pan. The center was soft but edges just done. I had left to cool on counter and turned off oven. When I cut into them about 20 minutes later the center was still like batter. I popped back in the oven, now off and slightly cooled. The result an hour later was gooey center brownies and cake-like (but still good) outside ones. It wasn't too sweet and it was so chocolatey! Family devoured them. Next time I will try the slow/low cook method.

Awesome. I didn't need to change anything. I love the story and I should have taken your advice about keeping them under lock and key ;-; 

Thanks for the recipe :3 
I'll make it again someday~
