We really like this recipe.  I actually used a graham cracker crust instead, but then I had a lot of leftover filling.  But that was good to eat on its own later!  I couldn't find raspberry juice, so I used cran-raspberry, and I'm sure it didn't make much of a difference.

Very lovely!  So easy to make and the options are endless if you play around with different types of juice and fruit.  I don't put as much sugar as it asks, and people enjoy it because it's a nice, light dessert.

This was yummy and light, I used light cool whip and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Next time I will omit the raspberries from the filling and put fresh raspberries on top as a garnish instead.  The raspberries in the filling were super hard and not easy or enjoyable to eat!  I will definitely make this again, it is super easy and the family really liked it.  They did like the peanut butter version on this site better, but this was my fav.

YUM! And so easy! Used the strawberries instead, just make sure to chop up, slicing the berries wasnt enough.  As I'm finishing up my second slice, it occurred to me this filling would make delish popsicle too!!!

I have been making this recipe for years to rave reviews from friends and family. Super fast and easy....TIP: Raspberry juice is laden with sugar and difficult to find so I use about 1 and 1/2 cups of raspberries and a cup of water, blend it until smooth and then strain out the seeds. I use this in place of the required juice. It's much tastier and it takes minutes to do.Also I use OREO chocolate cookie crumbs for the crust.  I have made this recipe with a variety of different fruits....strawberry, blueberry (yummy), mango.......Also I use low fat cream cheese and low fat Cool-whip.......it's great ....and a very welcome treat in the summer (although I make it year round).
Also I decorate the top with raspberries and shaved chocolate...VOILA

Very yummy - great Summer dessert! I used crushed Oreos as my crust, which was a great combo with the raspberries.  I will say, I wasn't paying attention, and if you add this to a "shopping list" it will tell you to get two 8oz packages of cream cheese (but you only need one, an 8oz package is 226g) and two Cool whip - but you only need one...so just be careful and pay attention to the recipe. Yum!

This was so easy to make! I pureed my raspberries to avoid frozen chunks. Turned our great and very tasty however this is not a cheesecake. It's more of a erm...pie.

I made this for the first time yesterday, it was so yummy.  The kids loved it and asked for more, I'll be making it again.  But next time I'll probably make more base.

I used strawberries when I made this last night. I also used a pre-made shortbread pie crust.

I've always had baked cheesecakes but I wanted to make this for a summer treat.   I used Saskatoons instead of raspberries.  I also heated a cup of Saskatoons in water with a little sugar and added a bit of cornstarch, immersion blended it and cooled and used this in place of the raspberry juice.  I also used whipped cream.  It turned out fantastic!

Absolutely fantastic!  I usually do everything from scratch, but I cheated on this one.  I use the shortbread pre made pie crust. It's so good!
