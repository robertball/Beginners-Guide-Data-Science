This is really tasty, and really easy.  Cut way back on the sugar (to about a tablespoon for a halved recipe) and didn't miss it.  It was great even without marinating time!  Added a couple of Thai red chilis also, and garnished with chopped cilantro.  Grilled without the plank.  This one is a must-try.  After making this a few times:  zipping up the ginger and garlic in a mini food processor makes it even easier.  Toasted sesame oil is delicious in place of the olive oil, and 1/8 teaspoon  is nice if you like some heat.

delicious!! i used half the brown sugar. i only had time to marinate my hoco fillet salmon for 30 mins. 30 min soaking time  with my cedar plank too. worked out fine. being a thinner piece of salmon it took longer to grill than i thought it would.  i use a charcoal grill. it took about 30 mins to cook. next time i'll soak the plank longer. slow cook the salmon. so worth the wait!!

We absolutely loved this recipe!! As with most, we made a few modifications.  We did not have the dark brown sugar or molasses, soe we used regular brown sugar and syrup.  I love garlic and was very liberal with it.  Because of our busy schedules, we had to postpone the meal an extra day (so it marinaded for two whole days).  Oh my goodness!!! If there is any way you can soak it for two days, Make it so!!  We also soaked the cedar planks for two days in water.  This really kept them from catching fire.  Using fresh minced ginger is the only way to go (used extra ginger too).

This recipe has far far too much sugar as written.  What a way to ruin a beautiful piece of salmon. As one other reviewer wrote, cut the sugar way back to a tbsp or two max and the soy sauce back to about half (use low sodium!) and let the flavor of the fish come through.

This is a great recipe. A great variation is to switch the muscovado for 2 tbsp og honey and a few drops of sesame oil..... deeeeeelicious!!

This was an excellent salmon recipe! My new "go to" marinade. Used maple planks. Followed the recipe exactly.

oh yummy!  DH went on and on.  Even the teenager ate some.  I didnt have a way to light my grill, so I fixed it in the oven.  I went ahead and used the cedar plank, although I am not sure it did anything in the oven.  But still, this was delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe except I grilled them without the cedar plank. They turned out great. We had one with a salad and with a lettuce wrap the next day. A keeper!

I made this while camping, my family loved it so much I had to make it again two weeks later for Father's Day. My parents brag to everyone how good it is and now my Aunt is going to make this week. simple and easy and it's always all gone, no leftovers. the longer it marinates the better it is, I use low sodium soy sauce, and no one seemed to mind a bit!

Made this last night for dinner and it  was very tasty and so easy to do. I am a ginger lover so this was another wonderful way to use it. We do not have a grill right now so i just baked it in the oven. I will be making this again.
