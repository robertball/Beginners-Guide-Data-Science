Daughter and her friend loved them!  I think I will add the bacon half way through the baking time or 15 min prior to finishing because my bacon turned black :( but it's still good. Maybe my bacon wasn't thick enough? Hmm we'll see next time.  I didnt add the wheat chex mix (not a fan), instead, i used all the regular chex mix....I'm sure you can use whatever mix you like.  Also, I used a large non-stick roasting pan & lightly sprayed it with Pam.  I've never made caramel popcorn with foil before.

Everyone loved it! Only problem is sticking to the paper towels when draining bacon.

Addicting snack - my husband loved the surprise  flavor of bacon with this sweet/salty snack. Defiantly needs to bake for the time instructed, I tried to pull it out early and found the snack was not so crunchy once it cooled, but still  very tasty. 
Also, watch that you are careful about keeping unpopped kernels out of mix (very painful on the teeth, when not expecting it).
