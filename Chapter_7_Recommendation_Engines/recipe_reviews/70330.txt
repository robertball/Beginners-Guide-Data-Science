Run, don't walk, to buy the ingredients to make this!  This is the BEST soup I've found on this site!  I used sweet potato, instead of butternut squash and used a whole can of LITE coconut milk, which reduced the calorie count substantially.  As a result, I also upped the amount of water by adding another 1 to 1 1/2 cups and adjusted the amounts of tomato paste, curry, black pepper, and cayenne. Oh, and lastly, since I needed to use them up, I sauteed some portabello mushrooms and threw them in as the soup cooked.  WOW! So glad I did, since they were a great addition - I'll add them to the ingredient list when I make this again, and I will definitely make this again.  (Did I mention I LOVE this soup?!)  I didn't quite understand the reviewer who claimed they had to halve the cayenne pepper amount and it was still too hot.  Huh?  It only called for a pinch.  Anyway, THANKS a MILLION for this recipe!

I'd give this recipe a 3 as written and a 5 with my changes. I used 3 cups of chicken stock in place of the 2 cups of water, as I found it to be too thickonce cooked. I also used about 3/4 can of coconut milk, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp of cayenne and 1/8 cup of fish sauce in addition to the other ingredients. I didn't have any squash on hand, so I used sweet potatoe instead, which I prefer anyway.  In the end this turned out perfectly. My 8 yo dd asked for seconds and dh requested that we serve it at our next dinner party. I'd call it a hit!!

I generally do not rate a recipe I do not follow completely.  I'm reviewing because this recipe seems so versatile.  If you do not have everything in your pantry, make this soup anyway!  This has a wonderful flavor and I was very apprehensive as I did not have coconut milk.  I substituted Soy Milk and Vegetable broth instead of water.  I also omited fenugreek seasoning as I'm not familiar with this spice.  The soup had a great flavor without any salt.  I added mushrooms as other reviewers suggested and I think the squash adds a lot to this dish.  Will use this recipe often.  Thanks for the post!

This is absolutely my favorite soup EVER! So amazing, I cannot even describe it in words. I agree with the review who said RUN (don't walk) to get the ingredients to make this incredible soup! I made a few changes, but nothing too drastic. I used potatoes instead of squash, fennel seed instead of fenugreek, green lentils instead of red (what I had on hand), and pureed about half the soup at the end for more body. Because of this, I ended up adding about 2 more cups of veg broth, and it was the perfect consistency. I also only used a couple tablespoons of coconut milk because I didn't have low-fat (couldn't justify using so much full-fat!), and it was still very creamy. Absolutely AMAZING lentil soup!! I don't know if I can ever try another because I fear they will all pale in comparison to this. It's top-notch restaurant quality--and SO easy!

Excellent. I was looking to recreate a  red lentil soup I tried recently, and had no idea where to begin, but this recipe seemed to have the flavors I was looking for. I skipped the fenugreek because I didn't have any, added shredded carrots, yellow potatoes, celery, lime juice, and extra curry, and garnished it with cilantro, toasted coconut, and lime zest. We had it with cubed chicken tonight, but I would definitely consider serving it vegan as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. When I first saw the list of ingredients I knew the soup would taste different from most, but thought it might be good in an exotic sort of way.  It isn't. The combination of ingredients make for a very strange tasting concoction. It didn't even smell good while it was cooking.

This is delicious!  I did add three celery stalks and a carrot, gave it great texture.  Instead of coconut milk (I was out, oops) I sub-ed in coconut milk with coconut oil.  Worked.  The only thing, took about 45 minutes longer to cook than listed (and needed about a cup more water as it simmered down)!  Worth the wait though!

Very good - very forgiving/flexible, too.  I subbed cubed potatoes for squash - delicious.  Used garam masala/cilantro powder/cumin powder, and some turmeric powder.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

This is great!  It's sweet and feels like Thanksgiving.  I doubled the squash since I couldn't find a smaller squash.  It worked out great.  I did have to cook it for probably 1 hour 15 minutes and add more water.  I also added a little cinnamon at the end.

This recipe is fantastic!  I actually doubled the recipe so I can have left-overs for the entire week .  I made the recipe exactly as it was written, but left a few ingredients out mainly due to the fact that I didn't have them on hand.  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of peanut oil since my son has a nut allergy, and also left out the Fenugreek because my local farmers market did not have it in stock at the time of my visit, and also left out the Cayenne pepper since i had to make the recipe kid-friendly for my 2 young boys.  I misread the recipe as 1TB of Curry as opposed to 1 tsp and was worried that the curry would be to overpowering but it was actually the right amount!  My husband who is not a fan of curry (AT ALL) really enjoyed this soup.  I never revealed to him that the soup had Curry in it otherwise he wouldn't have been as open to eat it!  Keep in mind,  the soup thickens up as you cook it, so i found myself having to add more water, and each time having to add a little more salt and tomato paste to get the flavors and color back to where it was.  I may just follow what some other reviewers tried,which was to add chicken broth instead. The Cilantro really brightens up this dish and really pulls the whole soup together! It reminds me of something I've eaten at a very high end Thai restaurant in the SF Bay Area.  I can't say enough about this dish!  I highly recommend!!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I had garam masala on hand (most of the spices are already contained in the spice mix), so I used that.  I followed the recommendation of the additional liquid.  Next time, I will use more butternut squash (and, perhaps, puree the soup with a hand blender).  The consistency needs tweaking-I've been been pleased with mixing in cooked rice (once brown rice, once basmati).  I made a double batch and froze some servings.  I am not sure how it will fare with reheating, but I imagine it would be fine.

UPDATE: The verdict is in: great for freezing.

I don't usually rate things, but I have made this soup countless times, so it definitely merits a rating. Not only has it become a staple food for me, but every time I make it for people, the recipe gets spread because IT'S SO GOOD. I originally made it for my friend on his birthday, and he doesn't like squash, so I used potatoes, and now I just do it out of habit. Also I leave out the fenugreek because I'm not a huge fan. Vegans and Veggies, prepare yourselves for a revelation. Or a revolution. Whichever you prefer.

Followed previous suggestions and used a whole can of light coconut milk, 2 cups vegetable broth and one cup water.  Plus added some shitake mushrooms.  Didn't have peanut oil, so I used canola.  Great dish, but still a bit thick with the extra liquid.  Great fall food!

Great recipe. I didn't have the fenugreek seasoning, next time I will try it with the missing ingredient. I liked the added richness of the coconut milk and squash, however I used pureed pumpkin instead. This is now my favourite lentil soup recipe.

This recipe is absolutely DIVINE! I followed someone else's advice and added 1 whole can of lite coconut milk (instead of half a can of regular) and upped the water to 3 cups total. I also added shiitake mushrooms, red baby potatoes and carrots. I would recommend just quartering the red potatoes and not chopping the carrots too small as mine got a little bit too mushy (still very good though!) Also did not have nor could I find fenugreek so I left that out.

I really enjoy this soup and have made this several times since I discovered it. I have changed it in some ways. First of all, I use olive oil instead of peanut oil mostly because it's what I stock in my house. I still have yet to know what fenugreek is and where to find it, so I leave it out all together. I use frozen pureed butternut squash to save time. And lastly, I don't like coconot milk, so I put vegatable buillon cubes and extra water in it instead. Love it!!

I LOVE this soup!!  The first time I followed the recipe, using sweet potato instead of squash and using a whole can of lite coconut milk and the whole can of tomato paste  - and it was amazing.  Tonight I chopped up a carrot  and a red pepper and tossed it in with the onions and garlic and some ground ginger (no fresh on hand).  I also tossed in about six stalks of asparagus chopped into half-inch pieces just before putting in the sweet potato.  Sauteed for a few minutes then added the rest of the ingredients.  Oh yeah, and I didn't have tomato paste on hand either, so I took another reviewer's advice and used some leftover marinara sauce - about 3/4 cup.  It is DELICIOUS.  Very forgiving recipe and very yummy!

Excellent. I used sesame oil because I didn't have any peanut, sauteed cubed chicken thigh fillet before adding the rest, added extra ginger, tumeric and a potato. I also added 2 cups of chicken stock. 30 min was plenty of time, even with potato. I think you could add sweet potato, carrot, spinach, peas, anything really, will try something new next time!

This is a fabulous recipe hands down.  I follow the recipe to the tee aside from substituting vegetable broth for the water and using an extra cup so it isn't so thick.  A wonderfully flavorful recipe if you love indian spices like my family does.  It has been a regular in our rotation of winter soups for over a year!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicious! My first time to make a curry dish.  I used fennel seed for the fenugreek seeds.  I also used chicken stock instead of water.  I think water might have been better.  Will try it that way next time.

My family loves this, although I would call it more a stew than a soup.  Instead of all the different spices, I add Madras curry powder to taste (probably at least a tablespoon, but I always double the recipe for my large brood!)  I didn't have tomato paste on hand, so I added one can of diced tomatoes with chilis (liquid included) instead which turned out great!  I also sub lite coconut milk to save on calories/fat. The butternut squash gives it a sweetness that balances the spiciness a bit.  This is a great warming dish, and the fact that it's vegan makes it even better!

Absolutely fantastic taste!  It's a bit like Thai coconut soup, with a pleasant added surprise of lentils and squash.  My husband called it "restaurant quality."  Lucky me - I found this recipe while searching for creative ways to cook butternut squash.  I did add mushrooms, as suggested by another reviewer.  And because I couldn't find fenugreek seeds at the grocery store, I don't know what I missed by not including them.  It tasted perfect, though, and I can't wait to make it again (probably with lite coconut milk).

Delicious!  And always received with rave reviews by friends and family. If I don't have butternut squash, I'll use sweet potato instead.  And I've never had fenugreek, but I do use ground cumin.  You can also use the entire can of coconut milk, although this will obviously up the fat content of the dish somewhat.  But it's delicious that way!

Great recipe, I've made it twice now, the first as a thick soup, the second served over rice. The flavors are right on and it tastes very rich. I also used a whole can of coconut milk each time. Oh and if your having a hard time finding fenugreek, check out indian food stores.

I'm not into the vegan or even the vegetarian thing, but I liked this recipe.  No fuss recipe.  Cooks really quickly once you get everything chopped and cut.  Served it to a couple of guy friends and they liked it.  Smells wonderful while it's cooking too.

Great flavors and easy to make.  I added a generous squeeze of lime to each serving, which gave a nice balance to  the richness of the coconut milk.

This soup is absolutely delicious! Mmmm.... soooo good : ) I used sweet potato instead, incresed most of the spices, added carrots and celery and used a whole can of coconut milk. I will definitely be making this again! I can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow, i'm sure it'll be even better!

I cook a lot of Indian food and this is great.  Very adaptable.  I followed it except :I used ghee instead of peanut oil,  sweet potatoes instead of squash,  skipped the curry powder and added turmeric. Love!

Very tasty dish. I added 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon garam masala, and added a whole quart of vegetable broth instead of two cups water per the instruction (per other comments saying it got too thick). Turned out great. I also added some soyrizo (vegetarian chorizo). Great stuff!!!! Thanks

Very good recipe - I followed it as written, but did add an additional cup of water toward the end as it was becoming more stew than soup.  It definitely is a keeper of a recipe.  I was just given a bottle of ginger juice, and the next time I make this recipe I will sub the juice for the minced ginger. I think it will make the soup smoother in texture and yet keep the taste of the ginger.  Thank you Labelchef !

Fantastic recipe!! I couldn't find fenugreek seeds, so I did a little research and used yellow mustard seed instead. What a WONDERFUL medley of flavors! I made this recipe exactly as-is (with exception of the seeds) and it's really perfect. A big hit with the family- so it's definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe almost exactly, used cilantro from the spice rack rather than fresh. Outstanding soup, kind of thick after it reduces so served it over brown rice and it was very tasty. Very easy to make too, thanks for the recipe...

Delish. Ok, I modified it to fit our family, but this is one of the top 5 soups I have eaten in my life. I substituted ground coriander for the fenugreek seeds, sweet potato for the squash, curry paste for curry powder and parsley for the cilantro. I also doubled the liquid as I had 2 cups of sweet potato. I have enough to freeze for another day, and everyone cleaned their bowls, including my 2 year old. I served with naan bread.

Very yummy!  I was looking for something to use up my half can of coconut milk and when I found this soup, I knew this was it!  I had to sub some cubed sweet potatoes for the butternut squash as I had just used up my squash a couple days prior.  Used veggie broth instead of water and had to add a bit more during cooking.  Left out the fenugreek as I didn't have any (nor have I ever bought them!).  Loved this :)

This is a great recipe! I doubled it, quadrupled the water (should have gone 1 cup shy though), tripled the curry powder, left out the tomato paste (didn't have any), added a bit of cinnamon. Also added some chopped kale at the end. Tastes just like indian dal.

Just ok. Based on the list of ingredients, I was expecting a very flavorful, exotic soup, but the end result was bland in my opinion. I followed the recipes, no substitutions, except to add about 1 extra cup of water as the amount given didn't seem enough for all these lentils. I found that adding the cilantro at the beginning of the recipe made it lose all its flavor by the end. The soup is tasty enough, I will eat it, but I probably won't make it again.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I am confounded by reviews stating that there is a lack of flavor; flavor is what this soup is all about.  I followed the recipe almost exactly using butternut squash, but I did use 1 whole can of low fat coconut milk and organic vegetable broth instead of water.  I used some fennel seeds as I could not find fenugreek seeds.  And I did add a bit more broth to the soup than the recipe calls for.  I would say the coconut milk and red lentils are musts.  Thank you for sharing!

I made some changes to the recipe due to not having everything on hand. I did not fenugreek seeds. I used red curry pasted instead of curry powder, and add cumin as some other reviewers suggested. The smell was wonderful, and this recipe was quick to make.

I followed the recipes exactly, including fenugreek seeds.   It was pretty good, but I prefer other lentil soups better.    I might make it again for a party or something, in that is is good and is unique.

Really enjoyed this dish. I changed it a little bit because I did not have fenugreek or cilantro. I added lemon juice. I also added chicken and chicken broth instead of the water which I realize goes against the whole vegan thing but I'm not so it's ok. I accidentally used an acorn squash as well which is just what I had and is what is in season around here. Thanks for the great recipe, hope I didn't butcher it too much for the next person.

I thought this was amazing! Thank you for sharing.  These were my tweeks only because i didn't have on hand a few of the items: I used Olive instead of Peanut oil, I had no Fenugreek seeds, I used some sun dried tomatoes instead of paste.  I will be using this soup recipe often, I'm sure.

With a little extra water I loved the consistancy of this soup, creamy and smooth, but it really lacked flavor. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and didn't care for it. I doubled the curry powder and added a little more cayenne and some salt and pepper and then it was very tastey. I would recommend making it the day before as it was better the next day.

I made this exactly per the recipe except I used sweet potatoes instead of squash (not a huge butternut squash fan), and added a little chopped carrot just to use up what was in the fridge. Delicious!!! We're not even vegan at my house, we just like to try making tasty-sounding things, and this was definitely tasty. The combination of sweet, spicy, toasty, and creamy is just delightful. My local chain grocer was out of fenugreek seeds, but I found them at a little middle eastern grocery store down the street for a GREAT price. My husband was raving about the smell the whole time this was simmering. I had to simmer it about 15 minutes longer than called for, but it turned out great. I sauteed the carrots with the onions and the consistency was perfect at the end. I wish I hadn't lost my immersion blender years ago in a move, because I imagine this would be good blended up a little, but I wasn't about to go through the trouble of dragging out my regular blender. It was perfect as-is anyway!

If you like curry, make this dish immediately! It is delicious and so versatile. You can put just about any vegetable in there and it will be wonderful. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, but next time I'll add more vegetables. It has a wonderful flavor. I topped it with plain low fat yogurt, which gave it a nice zest. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I love this soup!  Tweak it according to your preferences like add carrots, sweet potato, anything.  It's wonderful.  Bought some fenugreek powder but I think adding the garam marsala was even better for this dish.  The coconut milk, fresh ginger, and fresh cilantro were what set this dish apart from the other lentil soups I have made.  I sort of doubled it without really measuring.  Used 32 oz of veggie stock and maybe the same amount of water to about 2 cups lentils.  Just eyeballed it and kept tasting.  It did seem too thin initially so I let it cook down until it was how we liked it.  Used 1/2 bag of baby carrots, 1 stick of celery and 1/2 a large onion all sauteed in the beginning.  Used 4 small garnet sweet potatoes instead of squash.  Left out tomato paste out of preference.  Served over hot rice.

I just finished a bowl of this and it surpassed my expectations!  I agree with Chari in her praise.  Anyone who appreciates Indian/Asian flavors, should give this a try.  I was out of peanut oil, so I used canola; had left-over roasted squash, so scooped some out of the shell and used that.  I used a whole can of coconut milk plus maybe 1+ cup of extra water.  I think the squash, which was about the consistency of lumpy mashed potatoes, probably contributed to extra thichness, and needed even more liquid.  I added an extra big pinch of both the cayenne and nutmeg, was generous with the curry and I would have added more ginger, if I'd had it, because I'm an Indian spice-head.  The whole house is perfumed with the fragrance of coconut, curry and cilantro.  This is also easy and will go to the top of my list!

This is such a delicious and hearty soup/stew!  I added a little more squash and a full can of light coconut milk,  mashed the squash a little, and added all the cilantro at the very end. I love it!

Fabulous! I used Imagine No-Chicken broth in place of water and could only locate ground fenugreek seeds. If you are skipping out on the fenugreek because you are not familiar, I strongly encourage you to have an open mind and try it. It adds a fabulous flavor to this dish and is that signature flavor that shows up in Indian and Thai golden curries. The only thing I would change is the name - this is not really a soup but a stew, a fabulous tasty stew.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I've made the committment to only eat organic and locally produced meats, but intend to do so without drastically increasing my food budget. So I've been on the lookout for good vegetarian dishes that I can use to stretch my budget and help me stay healthy.    This recipe is incredible!  I did make a few changes: 1. subbed sweet potatoes for the squash (was what I had) and doubled the amount. 2. I found this needed a lot more liquid while simmering... perhaps the size of my pan was the problem. I used 2 cups of concentrated veggie stock (homemade) and then 4 cups of water. 3. Used 3/4 can of coconut milk. 4. To up the nutritional punch and give the dish some color variation, I added a small bunch of loosely torn kale. 5. Instead of using cilantro leaves in the cooking, I threw in a tied bunch of cilantro stems.  This imparted the flavor without the leaves getting all wilty in the soup. I then garnished with fresh cilantro and lime juice. The curry taste is very mild, and I may use more spices in the future. But the flavors of this dish are really divine, and this makes for a lovely meal year-round.

This is an awesome basic recipe.  Whenever I do vegan or vegetarian however, the dish always cries for chick peas.  So I added about a cup of them.  I interchange butternut squash and sweet potato depending what I have.  I use the whole can of light coconut milk, and instead of water, I use my homemade veggie broth.  I make it thicker, like a stew and serve it over soba noodles.   mmmmmm

I don't know what I made. I'm sure there's a name for it but it definitely wasn't lentil soup! The end result was a fantastically delicious thick lentil sauce that I used as a side with steamed chicken and brown rice. After reading people's comments about this recipe being  flexible and 'using what you had on hand', I thought I was set to go. I used brown lentils which I think was the beginning of my culinary demise. I'm not a pro with lentils, maybe the brown ones are more bitter? My other mistakes were to substitute the tomato paste with 1 cup of crushed tomatoes, forgo the water and onion, replace the squash with a leftover cooked potato, and the fenugreek seeds with cardamon. Following everything else, this dish was atrociously bitter. I doctored it by increasing the coconut milk to a full can (1 cup), 1/2 cup of water, 1 tbs of brown sugar, 1 cup of frozen peas, and the kicker -which really brought the whole dish together- 1 tbs of garam masala (cinnamon, cumin, coriander, clove, bay leaf, and pepper). Besides the lentils taking forever to cook, this dish was amazing and definitely 5 stars! Next time I'll try making the soup.

I loved loved loved this.  The ginger makes it fabulous.  The only slight changes I did make were to use light coconut milk, garam masala instead of curry, and fingerling potatoes instead of squash.  Served it over rice.  I will be making this again(when I can find red lentils)!

Great ingredients!  I ended up blending the soup for more consistency.  My dear husband hates lentils, squash and cocunut milk, but asked for seconds on this recipe!

Very good.  The other reviewer was dead on with the suggestion of using marinara sauce in lieu of tomato paste.  I also added two chicken bouillon cubes and some dried ginger after tasting it (in addition to the fresh ginger I had).  My lentils turned to mush after the squash was completely cooked; next time I'll either add more lentils and add them later or add more squash but puree it prior to its addition.

I've made this three times now in the past 2 months. This recipe is very flexible, everytime I add something new and tweak the spices. I use a full can of Coconut milk. Tomato juice also works in place of tomato paste.

Great recipe!  I used 1/2 can lite coconut milk and I think it did need the whole can.  I used sweet potato diced small in place of the squash.  That was good but I think next time I would puree it or maybe used canned pumpkin as I wanted it to have a slightly sweeter taste.  Also added chopped carrots and celery per somebody's suggestion, that was good too.  I also agree with others that the recipe needs to be doubled though, and I also enjoyed it even more a bit thicker over rice.

Fantastic.  My wife and I both enjoyed this very much.  We are just discovering lentils and this one is a keeper.

I left the lid off for most of the simmer, and it got pretty thick.  I added 1/4 cup of water and put the lid on partway during the last 10 mins.  Probably could just watch it and stop before it gets totally dry.

sorry to have to say this but I tried this receipe twice (thinking I'd done something wrong the first time) but both times I came up with a thick dry consistency nothing like soup...even after adding plenty of additional water to lighten it up I didn't find it very tasty :(

i love this, and i REALLY love that it's so easy - once you've chopped the squash your work is basically done. i've made it several times and tend to add more of all the spices. also, unless you're making it as a side dish, you're probably going to want to double it if you want 4 true servings; i find that the recipe as is really only feeds 2-3 (then again, maybe it's just so good that we overstuff ourselves).

This has become our favorite recipe for nights when we forgot to plan ahead and need something quick. It cooks up in no time and we always have the ingredients on hand, except the squash which we substitute with carrots.  Everyone likes it served over rice.  Leftovers are even better.

This was very nice. It has a pleasant balance of textures and flavors, and the coconut milk gives it some umph which is sometimes missing from vegan recipes.  I was out of fresh ginger and substituted dry, but it still tasted yummy. My family doesn't care for winter squash, but they liked it in this dish. I diced it pretty small to hide it, and it worked!

I doubled the recipe and used olive oil (instead of peanut), lite coconut milk and sweet potatoes (instead of butternut squash). I would not add extra water if you like lentils thick (and we do). I also added a green pepper and some cut up spinach (for more green). I served this over steamed basmati rice and have a lot leftover for lunches this week. It's fantastic, healthy and filling...great recipe!

Fantastic!  I also used more squash b/c I had it there.  Next time I may try to mash the squash first to give the soup and thicker sweeter taste.without the chunks.  The soup pot is small, I will also double next time.  Thanks!

This is an easy, delicious recipe, which can serve as a base for root vegetables in addition to butternut squash. I have tried variations with combinations of parsnips, carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes, etc and they are all good. The red lentils take so little time to cook that I add them at the end, and that way the soup is not as mushy. I think the name of the soup is a misnomer as the squash, not the red lentils, dominates. I call this soup Butternut/Red Lentil soup.

This soup is delicious. My entire family enjoyed it. I did not use cilantro or fenugreek as I didn't have any on hand. I used my whole butternut squash, which was more like 2 cups (maybe more) added extra lentils and used the entire can of coconut milk (it's the kind of leftover I will not use in time).  That said, I added a little extra water...and what really made this dish for me was adding a two big spoonfuls of apple preserves from a local farm- its chunky like chutney and it adds the best mix of flavor to the curry and ginger, with a sweet hint of apple. Yum! Blended it all in the blender to make creamy.

I make this recipe (with a few modifications) all the time! It's a favorite and is always met with rave reviews. Here's what I do differently: (1) Once the onion mixture is clear stir in the lentils and continue stirring for a minute or so. This will reduce the cooking time. (2) I use garam masala instead of the curry powder and nutmeg. I add this in with the lentils and stir for another minute before I add the liquid. (3) I use an entire 4 cup container of chicken broth. I add this to the ingredients I've already mentioned and allow the onion/lentil/spice mixture to simmer in it for about an hour while I cook the squash separately. (4) I roast the squash in the oven and scrape it into the soup, adding the tomato paste and coconut milk at the same time. (5) I add small pieces of fresh ginger directly to the soup shortly before serving. The bites of ginger add a wonderful surprise to the soup. It sounds weird, but TRUST ME. I have made this soup this way more than 30 times and often for company. Everyone LOVES it! Don't forget fresh cilantro to garnish!

At the end I added a little bit more spice and some sugar to make it more sweet and spicy, but it's a perfect base recipe that you can take and make it to your own taste.

Loved this soup!  And so did my family (including the 1 and 3 year olds)  But we had to make a few adjustments.  I pre-roasted the squash (since I was also making baby food that day).  The lentils needed a much longer cooking time, and had to keep adding water along the way.  Since cilantro is such a delicate herb, I added that after the cooking process (as I do when I make Tikka Masala).  I also had some fresh mint around, so I added that... yum!  It still needed a little something after all was completed according to the recipe - acid.  So I juiced one lime and added that in, too (I had doubled the recipe for leftovers... which were even better than the fresh, of course!).  Perfect.  I will be making this again.  There are lots of ways to augment the recipe.  I love that it's vegan.  Thanks!

Amazing! Will make again.  I used sweet potato instead of squash, I also added a bouillon cube.  Very good!

This was a big hit with the kiddos.  I was out of peanut oil so I used coconut oil and a little sesame oil instead. Sub'd fennel for fenugreek and sweet potato for squash since I didn't have them on hand and squash is out of season right now. I had low fat coconut milk so I used the entire can.  I still needed 2 cups of water though even with the increase in coconut milk.  Delicious!!!

Great recipe! I used vegetable broth instead of water, and added carrots and fresh tomatoes.

This is by far my favorite soup.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more liquid.  The soup is packed with flavor and so easy to prepare.  I have many requests for the recipe.

Sorry, but this soup just wasn't for me. I was going to rate 3 stars but since my husband said it was ok I'm giving 4 stars. I used organic chicken broth instead of water, other than that I followed the recipe exactly as is. I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

This soup is delicious! I did a couple of variations according to reviewers and had to improvise with what I had on hand. First off, I used a whole can of light coconut milk but did not increase the water, but decreased it to about 1 1/2 cups. I used acorn squash as I didn't have butternut. Another reviewer mentioned using fennel as I also did not have fenugreek. I tried fennel but will probably leave that out next time. Also, instead of tomato paste I used a can of diced tomatoes, added gharam masala and cumin in addition to the spices listed in the recipe. I love the spice and coconut flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This soup was a big hit with my family! I made a couple of small changes.  I replaced the water with vegetable broth and doubled the amount. I added the entire can of tomato paste. I left out the fenugreek seeds.  I put the soup in the blender after I cooked it and it came out velvety smooth.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks!

I LOVE this soup.  No one else in my family was very crazy about it UNTIL I made it a little thicker and served it over rice.  Now they all love it!  Excellent Thai flavours.  It is one of the foods I crave, late at night...when everyone is asleep!  :-)

As per the recipe, I found it a bit lacking in spice flavor, so I added another Tbl of curry powder while cooking.  Result was very good, though more of a stew than soup.  Thoroughly enjoyed the result, though and will be making this again.

I did not have fenugreek seeds so I left them out and I used a sweet potato in place of the squash. This was delicious with a very unique flavour. I would highly recommend it.  It was also very easy to make. Thank you for posting the recipe.

What a great combination of spicy and sweet.  I did take another reviewer's advice by adding spinach.  I also used vegetable stock instead of water and a whole can of coconut milk.  Delicious!

Wonderful recipe.  I've prepared it twice and will undoubtedly prepare in again and again.  I deviated from the recipe slightly each time.  The first time I used lite coconut milk, chicken stock (instead of water) and forgot the nutmeg.  The second time I used regular coconut milk, added some mushrooms and cauliflower and remembered the nutmeg.  Both times I used olive oil and green lentils, because that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious both ways.  In my opinion, the added mushrooms and cauliflower did not improve the recipe, but did not harm it either.  I thought it was equally good with lite coconut milk, so in the future, I'll regularly use the lite rather than whole coconut milk.  Also, using chicken stock instead of water may have marginally improved the taste, but of course it is no longer a vegan recipe.  In the future I will make it with red lentils, as the recipe calls for, but expect that would merely change the texture more than the taste.

Fabulous! The coconut milk adds that extra 'something'. I had been making a red lentil soup before, but this trumps it! I did use a sweet potato instead of carrot, and seasoned with cumin, curry powder, ground ginger and cayenne. Omitted the fenugreek because I had none. Added about 4 cups of water.

Yummy! I played with the amounts- and I agree with the reviewer who called this recipe versatile. I used more garlic, onion & ginger than the recipe called for- but that's how we like it! And it smelled wonderful while cooking- mmmmm- the curry powder is absolutely necessary.

Very yummy!  I only gave it 4 stars b/c I added some things after tasting.  I added cumin and black mustard seeds for seasoning,  and frozen spinach.  I also added chicken bouillon (I'm obviously not vegan, lol) and would use stock (veggie or chicken) next time.  I then mashed the soup with a potato masher to give it a slightly thicker consistency (and to hide evidence of the squash, which my hubby hates, lol).  It was a hit!

This soup is one of the best soups I've ever made.  If you like Indian food, you should make this soup.  My boyfriend usually hates soups but he loved this one.  I didn't have curry powder so I used the paste instead and I was not familiar with fenugreek seeds so I did not use it but I thought it was still fantastic!  I'll try to find it and use it next time.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was ok, followed others suggestion about the sweet potatos, that was probably the best part. Definitly better the next day, and be sure to use good curry powder!

This soup is so good! I used chicken broth instead of water. The lentil did absorb all the liquid and I ended up putting in about 4 cups of broth. Next time I will cook the lentils separately and then add to the soup. This is a keeper.

This soup was AWESOME!!!! One of the best soups i have ever had. I love to try new foods and this i have already made twice. 1. because it was so good and 2. because the recipe calls for almost half of each ingredient. I loved it. it was perfect too since it is dairy free. as a nursing mom i am always looking for dairy free receipes since my little once is allergic. If you are at all hesitant...try it! it is worth the time. i had to simmer for more like an hour and added a cup extra liquid. i used chicken stock to add extra flavor but it would be perfect w/ water since there is so many other flavors going on. i also used my immersion blender at the end to blend it up i would recommend that. Enjoy.

This  was really really tasty with an an added splash of hot sauce.   It turned out really thick more like a porrage then soup.  We served it over Quinoa.

I added the whole can of coconut milk, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Great vegan meal with lots of taste! I will for sure make this again.  I may try sweet potato or another kind of squash next time.

I thought this was good, but not as spectacular as some of the reviewers made it out to be.  This makes a very thick soup and has a unique flavor. If you like squash and cilantro you will probably like it. It tastes better fresh and isn't nearly as good as leftovers. I made this mostly according to recipe except without fenugreek seeds which I couldn't  find. Also I used a whole can of lite coconut milk. My roommate thought this was good but not substantial enough for a meal.

This recipe takes soup to a whole new level for me.  The use of coconut milk instead of cream is brilliant, and its fragrance perfectly compliments the squash and lentils.  I halved the coconut milk, added more water with vegetable broth powder (2 cups) because I like a thinner soup, and the rest stayed the same.  I grate my ginger (the thicker slice side of the grater) for nice crunchy ginger.

A solid and easy to make recipe ...and very tasty!  A good summer soup with a Thai flair.  And probably pretty flexible.  Defintely use fresh ingredients because I don't think this would be the same with powdered ginger.    Next time I'm going to try a few changes... maybe throw in some potatoes to make it a little hardier.  I may also try adding some fresh chillies rather than using cayenne powder.

10 stars, the best soup ever, my whole family agrees, even the picky kids! Just awesome! I do not add as much coconut milk just so it's not so fattening for me, but I add more to the kids soups as I serve it to them.

this is a good, simple, and quick recipe. i didnt have all the spices but added in some thai red curry paste, and it turned out well. 

i think the ginger is important, but i ended up using dried (probably more than 1 tb). also, i added 2 additional cloves of garlic, a bit more squash, and more like 1/2+ cup of cilantro. i ended up adding an additional cup of broth. 

as someone has already said, this recipe serves as a great base for all sorts of variations. i think the coconut milk makes it esp. tasty. Also, this recipe is a great size; there are only 2 of us and though we have leftovers, its not a crazy amount to deal with, which is another plus.

Wow--this has to be my most favorite soup ever (and I'm not even a vegetarian)!  I did use the entire can of coconut milk and the entire can of tomato paste, no onion, and chicken broth instead of water.

I used a whole can of coconut milk, doubled the tomato paste, added a veggie bouillon cube and cinnamon, and it was absolutely delicious! It has the taste of a koorma sauce, which I've really craved since becoming a vegetarian. We ate it as a soup, but I could imagine it with rice... but be careful, all the lentils make it VERY filling!

The flavor of this soup increased as I ate it; pretty good.  It took a lot longer for the lentils to soften than the recipe said.

I'll admit, I didn't make the recipe as vegan, but it's delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of water and substituted garam masala instead of curry, because I don't like curry.  I cooked this in a slow cooker for several hours, and it's wonderful.

Very good, I halved the amount of cayenne and it was still very spicy.  Like other reviewers, I added more liquid, but I found that it did not need to cook that long (I do not like my lentils to turn into mush).

We make this at least once a month in the winter, SO DELICIOUS!!!! I always double it, add a can of drained diced tomatoes and a bunch of kale chopped small. I also use chicken broth instead of water. I've used sweet potatoes and butternut squash and both are good. Do yourself a favor and MAKE THIS NOW!!!1

I made this soup yesterday.  I tried to follow this recipe as closely as possible in the ingredients.  I did have to substitute asafetida for garlic (due to my garlic allergy) and ground ginger for whole (what I had).  I ommitted the cayenne (my husband doesn't tolerate too spicy hot) and regular pepper (I don't use that in my cooking).  I steamed the squash first and mashed it before adding the lentils.  I had to use half the amount of coconut milk because that is what I had.  As others mentioned, I had to add more water till the lentils were done.  Anyways, my modifications were slight.  I was so proud of myself for making something that finally tasted like true ethnic Indian-like cuisine.  My husband loved it and told me to make it again.  I would like to try making it again omitting the "pinch of" this and that just to save on pulling out ingredients.  But I love how subtle all the flavors are and how well they go together to make a delicate, slightly sweet whole.  We served it with buttered quinoa.  Thanks so much for sharing this one.  I will be checking out your other recipes.

I had to try this recipe. I was disappointed. All the strong spices practically cover the real delicious taste of lentils; would be quite enough to use 1-2 spices and more veggies. Too hot and spicy for me and not suitable for my weak stomach.

Wow!  I absolutely loved this soup.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I served it topped with toasted coconut, some cilantro and chopped green onion.  It was so creamy and hearty!  I'm already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

We made this soup for a church fundraiser and it went so fast! People loved it. I couldn't find the fenugreek seeds, so I left them out, and I don't think it suffered much. It still came out extremely tasty. People asked for the recipe.

For the most part, this is a great recipe. I made no changes initially but was forced to during the cooking. I made it as written but found that it needed more liquid to be added and I used the other half can of coconut milk. The curry powder i used is a red curry powder made by mccormicks. I didn't have any fenugreek so I added a tsp of Greek seasoning instead. I cut my squash fairly small. About 3/4 inch cubes and I had to cook it15minuts longer than the recipe called for. I also felt like needed a bit more of something so I added two tsp of "better than bullion" vegetable base. The vegetable broth really made the dish. I like my lentil soups to have a little lemon so I added a tbsp of lemon juice. Overall this was really good. Thick and filling. Great for my winter meatless Mondays.  I will make this again. Be aware if you like your lentils to still be whole, this long simmer turns them into mush. Personally I like this but if you don't you should maybe partially cook the squash for 15 minutes or so before adding the lentils

Exquisite! I always make large quantities of soup so I quadrupled most/all ingredients in this recipe. Only changes I made were substituting acorn squash for butternut, and vegetable broth for water, cause it all looked just about right as written!
 Oh, and I didn't have fenugreek so I added a little maple syrup, which I read resembles fenugreek in taste and fragrance. 
I let it thicken and served it over rice; the whole family loved it . What a great recipe!

Absolutely amazing! Great winter dish for a small gathering! The only thing I did not add was the fenugreek seeds. Could not find them. Also, add a lot of salt to bring the taste out more. Other than that I 100% recommend.

Was really good but did up the curry powder for our liking.  Came together so easy and happened to have everything on hand.  Added about a handful of fresh spinach chopped and about 3 mushrooms. Would definitely make again.

We have a local Bistro that serves Australian Lentil Soup, I have been searching for a recipe for several years by that name!  When I came upon this recipe, I made it the following day, substituting sweet potatoe for the squash, I also added more broth.  It was delicious, and everything I was looking for in a recipe.  The flavour is wonderful!!

I love this recipe - it is one of the few on this site that I make repeatedly.  I have made it with squash and sweet potatoes, and both turned out great.  This most recent time I added about half a bag of frozen leaf spinach and I added extra ginger, and it was great - I will do that again!  We are not vegetarian or vegan, but this is a super hearty vegetarian dish to try if you would like to try doing "meatless Monday" or just eating vegetarian once in a while.  It is a thick consistency, but I like that.  I serve it over brown rice instead of as a soup.  It is also fairly flexible - I have messed up and added too much coconut milk once, and once was out of tomato paste and used some jarred marinera sauce instead, and it still turned out delicious.

Totally delicious, with room for modification.  I added mushrooms as other members suggested and they are a welcome addition.  I will be making this again and again.

I made this exactly the way the recipe was written.  For me, this didn't have enough liquid.  So, I had to add water and vegan no chicken broth to it so the lentils and squash would cook.  I nuked the squash beforehand to make it faster.  It became so thick I was afraid the lentils wouldn't cook.  In the end, it was delicious and such a vibrant color you knew it just had to be good for you.

This is excellent. I did it in a pressure cooker at less than half the time and it came out great. I used a whole can of coconut milk because of that. I have recommended it to everyone. Healthy too! Also go easy on the paprika if you're using hot curry.

This soup is AWESOME!!  I will make this again and again.  I used fresh young coconut meat and its water in a blender to make the coconut milk. I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used fresh mint and parsley instead.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

What an delicious soup! I didn't add fenugreek or tomato paste- didn't have them. I also upped the curry spice and served it with a dollop of chili garlic paste on top. Perfect for a cold winter day. Will definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe, very versatile.  We used approx 1 cup of strained tomato instead of tomato paste.  Also, we used a full can of coconut milk instead of a half can.  This is great as a soup, or remove some liquid and make it a coconut lentil curry served with basmati rice.

I made this tonight and it was delish. I didn't have fenugreek seeds, tomato paste, or curry powder and don't like the taste of nutmeg in soups, so omitted those items both otherwise made it as written and enjoyed it over cooked brown rice. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow so I can eat some more. Thanks for sharing!

Very GOOD lentil soup. I was impressed that it came out so well and it's an internet recipe. I really expected it to taste bland and awful but it was the best homemade soup I have ever made or tasted. I substituted with potatoes instead of squash and had to add a lot of extra water as the soup was thick. I didnt have any cilantro so I omitted it and I used powdered ginger instead of fresh. My husband went CRAZY over this soup.

This recipe is excellent and has beautiful flavor.  My only word of caution is to half the lentils unless you want to have to keep adding liquid and thus, spices to compensate.  Like other reviewers, I substituted sweet potato for the butternut squash since I already had it on hand, and substituted one cup of vegetable stock for one of the cups of water for some extra flavor.  Delicious!

Awesome recipe, the squash tastes amazing with the coconut milk.  Took some of the other reviewers advice and used two cups of chicken stock instead of 2 cups of water (of course, it wasn't vegan).  Also, I didn't have fenugreek so used fennel seed and it was delicious!  I should have used more.  I want to try fresh fennel next time, too.    Also, I added the cilantro in at the very end instead of cooking it the whole 30 minutes.  Gives it a nice fresh flavor.

Just a question of personal taste.  I was looking for a homier version.  I was not crazy about the ginger.

Fantastic recipe with lots of flavor.  Had to go out of my way a bit to get the proper ingredients, but it was fairly inexpensive and definitely very flavorful.  I followed the advice of others on here and added portabella mushrooms, which were very good, but I wouldn't say are essential.  I couldn't seem to find fenugreek seeds at my local grocery store, but I found fennel seeds and bought those instead, thinking that they sounded sort of the same so maybe they were the same.  Regardless, the soup turned out great and I highly recommend it.

I didn't have coconut milk but a can of coconut water, which I used and added a sweet potato for thickening.  Wonderful soup, next time I'll make sure I have the correct ingredients.  I'm not a vegan so I added some grated cheese to the bowls. Thank you.

I followed this recipe exactly except for subbing yam for squash, and adding sauteed mushrooms as other reviewers suggested.  It was quite good, though not as tasty as I thought it would be.  Definitely needs more liquid added to it as the lentils soaked up a lot of it and it had the consistency of a stew rather than a soup.

Sooo good!  Even my toddlers liked it. My husband doesn't like onion, so after sauteeing, I cooked the sauteed ingred along with the water and squash, then pureed this portion and added the rest of the ingred.  He loved it.  What a thick and delicious soup!  Thanks for this recipe.

Like other readers have posted, this is an awesome versitile recipe. I pretty much followed this with a couple teen exceptions. I put in a Tbls of curry... ooops! But it was DELISH! Glad I did! I also had a bag of spinach I needed to use up so I shredded it and tossed it in. I used a bag of frozen organic squash and made this recipe in my crock-pot. I cooked it all down on low about 5 hours, then used my immersion blender to semi-puree it.

This was amazing! I wanted to use the lentils I had in the cabinet, so I typed that up and landed on this recipe! I was amazed at how different this was for me to cook. I did not have coconut milk but had sweet condensed milk, no fenugreek seeds but I had sesame seed oil, and I used tarragon and parsley because I had no cilantro. I like to substitute where I can and with this on it made no difference. I used another reviewers addition with coconut oil, and in the first step when i was browning the onion, garlic, ginger, I added cocnut flakes and some green pepper. Again this was amazing and I will make it again for sure, my picky girlfriend liked it as well! I served it over rice, with a little cheddar on top, sliced avocado, and Naan Bread. Perfect meal!

I just have one piece of advice....add extra water (or broth) if you want this to be a soup, otherwise it will be more like a lentil stew.

I made this for a dinner party that I hosted.  It smelled great, tasted great, and there wasn't any left by the end of the night.  I prepared it according to the directions, although I added a little extra red pepper. Put it in the crock pot on warm and served it over rice. It was fabulous!!

Delicious and easy! Ingredients are usually in the pantry. I've made this 3 times in a month and passed it on to several people. Added fennel and cumin seeds (along with fenugreek) for more aromatics.

I also used a full can of coconut milk, and I didn't have tomato paste so I substituted half a cup of leftover marinara sauce. The soup turned out DELICIOUS and I will definitely be making it again!

I loved this recipe!  
I made about 36 servings (since it was for a large number of people) and it still turned out wonderful.  I didn't add any cilantro (personal preference) or fenugreek seeds, but I did add a bit more garlic, ginger, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, and cumin...also, I used green lentils instead of red.  It had a great flavor and I'll definitely be making this again in the future.

Really good. But I didn't know what fenugreek seeds were so I substituted cumin seeds - b/c that is used a lot in curry style cooking - I liked that the soup and just the right amount of spice - not too much and not too little - I think if you don't have butternut squash you could easily just used cubed potatoes as well. Although, I used the squash and I really liked the color. Also, I had to use a full can of coconut milk b/c it simmered up all the liquids very fast so I just pour the whole can in. Thanks for the recipe - I may make again :-)

This is a wonderful soup. Like others who have posted, I did have to add extra water. At the end of cooking, I took a cup of the soup and blended it and then returned the blend to the soup pot to make the soup creamier. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This was very delicious and got better after it sat in the fridge for a day. I used a combination of lentils (red and green) and a sweet potato instead of squash because it's what I had on hand. In addition, I added about a teaspoon of coconut sugar (honey or sugar would work, too) - just thought the sweetness would add some dimension to the soup.

I did have to add more water and more coconut milk. Possibly I had the heat too high. It still was very good. I might add a pinch more of red pepper next time. I will definitely make it again. It is an easy recipe to pull together and tastes good.

I tweaked to what I had on hand, and it was a richly flavorful, creamy and hearty lentil dish.  I used 2 cups prepackaged cubed butternut squash, 1 13.5-oz can coconut milk, 1 small can tomato paste, ground ginger, lots of fresh chopped cilantro, 3 cloves garlic, 1 1/2 tsp or a bit more curry powder, 1 large yellow onion, 2 cups broth instead of water, and coconut oil instead of peanut oil.  Skipped nutmeg as had run out.  The result was an amazing creamy fusion of flavor. My family loved it. This dish will become a staple in our house.

Amazingly flavorful, easy, all-around delicious soup! I have made this several times, for vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and it always gets rave reviews. I’m not familiar with fenugreek, so I leave it out, and I’ve used canola and olive oils instead of peanut, with great results. You can’t go wrong with this one, enjoy!

I have to say I was lucky I had nearly all of the ingredients this recipe called for. I made it with vegetable broth and some water instead of just the 2 cups of water with a little extra liquid. I did not have butternut squash so I used sweet potatoes instead.  This soup made me smile with every bite!  I will definitely be sharing this recipe with friends and family and making it again!

This is a full flavored and very satisfying soup, I am on a detox and came across this.   I will definitely be making this again, even if I am not dieting, this soup is that good.   I didn't have fenugreek so I doubled my curry powder.  A couple years ago I had a surplus of winter squash that I canned in chunks in quart jars, so I used it instead of the fresh squash.   I also love the flavor of fresh cilantro so I added it after the soup was done and stirred it in.

This recipe is great! Very flavorful and nutritious. If you like spicy add more cayenne but it’s perfect with the small amount. Mine came out thick so we had it with rice and it was great. My other eats meat so he made some have in his bowl and he said that was great too. I will try it with double the squash as it on

This soup has a lot of flavor. I roasted orange pepper and the squash before adding it to the soup. I also sautéed a few carrots along with the onion, garlic, ginger mixture. I as well didn't have coconut milk on hand so I used almond milk.

Amazing every time!  This is a staple dish in my family.  I think the fenugreek and fresh cilantro are what set this recipe apart from other curried lentil soups.  I usually swap out the squash for sweet potatoes (mostly because they are easier to peel), but you can add any type of accent veggie in there and it will be delicious.

I will absolutely make this again...soon.  Boyfriend is vegetarian, I am not and we both loved it.  Minimal changes due to what I had on hand.  I used one can pumpkin in place of squash.  That was a big timesaver and I loved the creamy consistency.  I doubled the water and added a vegetable bouillon cube.
I have made this several more times and while the original recipe is perfectly delicious, i adhere to a low carb diet and the lentils are not desirable for that reason.  I replaced the lentils with cauliflower and found it to be equally delicious (so did my non-cauliflower-loving boyfriend).

This was similar to a soup I do but I love the coconut milk in this one.  I also did vegetable broth instead of water, and used tomato sauce instead of paste since I didnt have any.  I also didnt have butternut squash so used a sweet potato, and added an apple.  The soup came out thick and wonderful.    I am not sure how the soup could not have smelled good as one reviewer noted; just the smell of the garlic and onion were awesome!!!  Will definitely make again.

Wow, this recipe is delicious!  I used the low calorie coconut milk recommended by another viewer.  Simple wonderful.  I love all the different flavors that you taste with each spoonful. I like my soups soupy not too thick so I add some broth to it at the very end of cooking.   If you think it is bland tasting, which some rated as...spice it up to your liking.  This is definitely a good base soup to work with if you want to jazz it up a bit.  Have fun!

This would probably been 5 stars if I followed exactly.  I was very happy with my changes though.  I replaced the coconut milk and water with vegetable broth as I did not have coco nut milk.  I sauted the veg in vegetable broth as well to cut down on the fat.  Also added celery, grated carrot and mushrooms.  At the end I added a couple of spoonfulls of cashew cream (2 c raw cashews blended with 1 c water) which made it nicely creamy!

I loved this soup because of the additions I made. I added brussel sprouts, carrots, and lime which brought out the coconut/curry flavors. Definitely livened the soup up quite a bit.

Agree with other reviewers, excellent soup particularly with modifications (no fenugreek seeds, broth instead of water, sweet potato instead of squash).  I used evaporated coconut milk which was excellent and much lower in both fat and sugar.  Delicious soup that even my kids liked...!

I was disappointed in this soup. Even though it had an ok taste, it was extremely thick, like a paste, so I'd call it more of a stew. I was hoping it would be more liquid. Plus, I think it could use more vegetables. It's not terrible, but I will not make it again.

I made this soup after coming in from shoveling snow. What a wonderful treat on such a cold, raw day. It's more of a stew consistency, but no complaints here. This is a delicious and easy recipe! I'll be coming back again and again to this recipe.

I used yam instead of squash,  and a jar of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I also added a little more cocoanut milk than what was called for in the recipe.  I didn't have any cilantro so I used parsley instead.

I followed the recipee except I didn't have fenugreek seeds or nutmeg. I added a little extra curry powder to make up for that. Overall, it was delicious and my whole family got seconds. Next time I would probably buy butternut squash that is already cut and peeled because the preparation is a pain. Five star soup. It was so creamy and flavorful!

Loved this recipe, so creamy and the texture is fabulous.

I did alter the recipe like some others....i used both butternut squash and a large sweet potato. Instead of cilantro I also substituted basil.

Love this soup. I added red bell pepper and zucchini in stead of butternut, because that is what was in the veggie drawer. Love the flavor and the veggies are irrelevant.

This was a tasty and easy way to use up my dried lentils!  For years I've been bored with every recipe I've come across containing this mundane legume.  I did end up using avocado oil instead of peanut and a whole can of coconut milk, then adding extra butternut squash and lentils.  I will definitely make this again!

This soup had a great savory flavor. The cilantro and coconut milk kept it fresh-tasting. My only complaint was that this ended up being more of a stew than a soup, as most of the liquids cooked out by the time the lentils were soft. I will make this again, but add more liquids (I would sub chicken or vegetable broth for water).

This is one of my family's favorite! I make it regularly and there are never leftovers! It's like dessert for dinner! I do make a few changes. I cook the lentils and squash with the other veggies in the broth (2.5 cups) until tender, then add the coconut milk and tomato sauce at the end.  Delicious!

So I doubled the recipe and used vegetable broth instead of water. I also had some potatoes that I used instead of squash. This was amazing!!! Definitely will be one of my go to recipes moving forward.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. I did change it up a bit by using vegetable broth as the base, sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash, and I added bok choy, carrots and green onions and doubled the cayenne pepper. It was a huge hit. Will definitely make this again and again.

I omitted the fenugreek seeds, subbed sweet potato for squash, & used dried cilantro, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was bland.  I added some Better Than Bouillon chicken base to it and that helped a little.  I won't make it again.

We absolutely loved the taste of this soup!!! My husband and I are  starting to eat healthier and this soup will be one I make pretty much every week! The only change from the original recipe was I had no curry or fenugreek seasoning in the house. Next time I make it I will make sure I have those 2 spices. But soup was still incredible!

I used sunflower oil instead of peanut oil, left out the fenugreek, tomato paste, and cayenne pepper, substituted about 2 tsp of dried cilantro for the fresh cilantro, and used one full can of light coconut milk.  The resulting soup was absolutely delicious!

I took stock in some of the suggestions made by other users by utilizing chicken stock instead of water (4 cups of it), increasing the tomato paste to 5 Tablespoons, Squash to 1 3/4 cups, using one whole can of coconut milk and finally adding 1 teaspoon of Red Chili paste to boost the heat a little bit. This is definitely one of the best soups I have ever made and will do so again and again!!

Sooooo good!!!! And love that it's vegan! 

I subbed the squash with sweet potatoes like others mentioned. I also added some fresh collard greens to the cooking process... More nutrition and texture! 
Lastly, the whole can of coconut milk won't hurt ;)

I substuted split peas for the red lentils and I didn't put in fenugreek seeds because I have no idea what they are.  Next time I'll be sure to use lentils. The split peas didn't work too well.

I made this soup but made a few changes for my family.  We like things a little more complex and spicier.  I upped the spices, I substituted this pumpkin for the butternut squash because I had so many from my garden (it is similar tasting).  Then I added 1/2 cup of peanut sauce and a large pinch of saffron.  I blended all in the pot with an immersion blender.  Everyone loved it and insists I make this again.

Best vegan soup recipe I've eaten so far. I used Kabocha squash instead and the final product still was a hit. I served it with some bread and it was quite perfect. Excellent and unique taste. You can even serve with some hot sauce for a little bite. Great stuff!

Yum. I added potato along with butternut squash. Also, added vegetarian chicken/apple Torfuky sausage to the  oil when cooking onions, this added some substance. Added a handful of the tiny pasta for more substance, not that it doesn't have enough, I just wanted it hearty. Loved this and so did my husband who doesn't know it is a vegetarian soup.

Subbed 5.5 oz of tomato juice for the tomato paste, which I didn't have in the house, and used veg. stock instead of water.  Lentils and squash were soft in 30 min.  Had an excellent flavor, was a hit with the whole family including my picky two-year-old.

Loved this soup! I had most of the ingredients so started to follow the recipie. Even with the fenugreek. Then I eliminated the last 5 ingredients, except for salt and pepper, substituted thai green curry paste. Added portaabellas chopped, last 15 min. and last 5 min. some baby spinich leaves. YUM!!

I don't typically like soup, or lentils!  I made this at my vegan-husband's request, and was surprised that it was so good.  Like another reviewer, I replaced the water with veggie broth and added an extra cup of water. I thought it needed salt and heat—so added 1 t. salt, 1 t. ancho chili powder and a dash of hot chili oil. It's thick—I poured it over a baked potato; my husband and kid ate it like soup. BTW: Red lentils were found in the "bin" food and are actually orange—if you are trying to hunt them down!

OK - I changed it up quite a bit to work with what we had here in our home and it turned out amazing.  Try this instead -1 cup of fingerling potatoes instead of squash, juice of 1/2 lime, dried cilantro instead of fresh, no fenugreek seeds, ground ginger instead of the root,  and double  the water (I may have even tripled the water - I just kept adding more as it thickened).  I used my immersion blender to pulverize the potatos when they were cooked through.  Soup has a wonderful texture and flavor.  I would monitor the consistency of the soup as it cooks - it can become very thick - I would err on the side of adding more water to get it to the write consistency - you don't want it to be like paste.

I've made this recipe twice with minimal changes: olive oil instead of peanut, adding mushrooms and increased amount of curry.  It was a hit both times.

Great soup, all the flavors come together nicely. Might increase the fenugreek seeds next time to bring out more flavor or use the powder. A nice soup to experiment with, as others have mentioned, but also delicious just as written. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was good.  I added TWO pinches of cayenne and it was way too hot for me. I had to cut it with some yogurt which actually tasted yummy!

I used frozen butternut squash chunks.  I didn't care for the texture. Next time I will try sweet potato in place of the squash.

The flavor of the broth is wonderful.

Yep! 5 star all the way. But WOW it's THICK! Like paste, so be SURE to add more liquid...the reviewers that talk about the thickness have added more coconut milk or veggie broth or water. And it takes longer than 30 minutes (low simmer) to get those lentils for break. I pre-cooked the butternut squash, so added it after the lentils had been in for ~30 minutes.

Zowie this is so good!

Wow!  This is such a great soup!  I made two modifications: no ginger (my hubby hates ginger), and two fresh tomatoes instead of the paste.

Excellent!  I made this last night and all three family members loved it.  So healthy and so delicious - how could you not love it?  I followed the recipe exactly except I had no Feenugreek seeds - so had to omit that.  I also mashed the butternut squash a bit with a handheld masher before serving and sprinkled more fresh cilantro on it when I served it.  Awesome recipe - a real keeper - thanks for posting it!

This recipe was excellent!  I am not a vegetarian, so used chicken broth instead of water.  Also used Trader Joe's light coconut milk (the brand does matter).  I think those were the only changes that I made.

This soup is delicious! I did not use cilantro, fenugreek seeds, cayenne paper as I did not have them in my kitchen. Instead of coconut milk I used coconut flakes and hot water mixed in blender. I turned out great! I think it is one of the best soups i have tried! Make it!

I am not a vegetarian, so I skipped the ginger and fenugreek and used chicken broth instead of water. I also added 2 chopped chorizos.  So good.

My whole family loved this recipe. It was so yummy. I may be bias though because I love curry powder. I am by no means vegan, but trying to incorporate "meatless" meals to my family a few nights a week. I think it's important to present my family with different options that are delicious. This one is a winner!!!

I would give my adapted version 5 stars. Use veggie stock instead of water. Add more veggies, celery, mushrooms, carrot and red pepper. Use WAY more curry powder, I use a Tbsp of Garam Marsala and Siracha.

Really good, I puree a little with the hand blender before serving to make it creamier, but not all the way.  I've made this a few times, and I use coconut oil instead of peanut.  Perfect for this dish and healthy too.  I sub sweet potatoes and use more ginger and less curry for my taste.  I've never used fenugreek except for lactation tea, so I skip it in the recipe!

So delicious! I made it with sweet potatoes instead of butternut, let it thicken, and then served over jasmine rice. Would also be great as a soupier soup.

I love this soup!!! Even better the next day.  I mash mine a bit with a potato masher at the end. I've made it with both butternut squash and sweet potato and didn't notice much difference in the end result.  I always use stock instead of water too. I also add carrots and celery with the onion when I sautee.  Everyone loves it! I've made it 4 times in the past month!

This makes a very rich hearty soup. Made this  as written but added some chopped baby bella mushrooms as it cooked ( had these on hand). I used a light touch on the seasonings and will add more next time. I will use light coconut milk next time to reduce calories. Sauteed the onions in a little avocado oil.This is delicious and vegan, a real keeper. I love it.

This soup is fantastic. We made it exactly as is, served it to a group of 20 people and got nothing but rave reviews. Huge hit!! Next time I will add some kale or spinach and up the curry and cayenne a bit, but it's wonderful as is.

I really was excited when I saw this recipe. This was ok but bland to me.  I had to add a ton of salt to bring out the flavor.  So much for a healthy recipe.  I have no idea how a recipe could have so many spices and still taste like nothing without salt.

AMAZING!  I agree that it's worth going to the store, right now, to get the ingredients for this!  I took other reviewers advice and used a whole can of light coconut milk, some extra broth and then used the immersion blender to smooth it out a little.  This is definitely a keeper and going into my list of favorite soups!

This is absolutely my go to stew recipe.  My friend's mother found it and shared it with her son who shared it with me!  I make mashed potatoes (unfortunately they are not vegan) and serve this over top.  It makes it so much more wonderful.  I use maharajah curry powder which  has saffron in it and it is AMAZING!  This is our New Year's Day Dinner!

Excellent recipe - made exactly as written, but skipped the fenugreek.  It's a very thick soup as is.  Would be good pureed too.

Absolutely delicious flavors! I don't care for most soups as I have an aversion to liquidy textures, so I omitted the water from this recipe to make it more of a stew (I cooked the squash and lentils before hand). Served it over rice and was AMAZING! Even better the next day when the spices have been marinating the rice overnight.

Really good.  I added carrots and celery and used leftover roasted butternut squash.  Definately use 1 Tbs of curry, not 1 tsp. Kept it thick and stew-like and served over rice.

This was pretty good. I did find it to be a little boring and added some extra curry powder and a big spoonful of natural peanut butter which seemed to bring the flavors together better. With those changes I loved it.

This was really pretty good. I tasted it when it was done and liked it. But it seemed like it needed a little something, so I added a can of chickpeas and a squeeze of lime juice, and it was even better.

Delicious!! Tastes like mom's lentil curry (and I'm Indian!). I followed the recipe pretty exact, I did use extra tomato paste because I like the flavor.

This is a great soup, easy, hearty, tasty and fast to prepare. After a few trials I have adjusted it to my taste adding chicken cutting back on the curry and adding other seasons, like garlic salt, chicken bouillon and chicken broth.

This soup is really nice!   I substituted the water for chicken brother and added about a tablespoon of cumin and curry powder (I like it spicy).  I also added a bit of chili sauce and the juice of two limes.

i didn't make this vegan (because my boyfriend has to have meat at every meal), but it was really good. I used chicken stock in stead of veggie stock, and i grilled a pork tenderloin with sweet curry powder before cutting it up and putting it in the soup. It was delicious!

I just made this soup for a church supper, and even people who are not vegetarian gave me compliments about it. I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions. Instead of acorn squash, I used carrots and potatoes. I used the LITE coconut milk, and used vegetable broth, not water. Next time I will make sure I have limes on hand for a fresh squeeze before eating. I will definiteing make this soup again. It feels really good to have made a soup that so many people enjoyed.

This is really more like a dahl. I didn't have enough red lentils, so I added some green, which meant it had to simmer longer. As a result, I had to add extra liquid and then bump up the spices a bit. I also added some garam masala at the end for a bit more flavor. I didn't think the squash added much flavor, but this was a great way to use up the extra I had.

This was different.  I think if I cooked it more, I could grow to love it.  It's simple, hearty and adjustable.  This was my first time cooking lentils, so I didn't know what to expect.  My husband LOVES this soup.  I did use sweet potatoes and doubled the recipe for my family.  I also added extra veggie broth and water to get a somewhat thinner soup.

Delicious.  Too thick though, I added quite a bit of milk.  Added about a tablespoon of cumin ( I used 3 c. of squash and a sweet potato).  Used the whole can of coconut milk and a whole can of tomato paste.  This recipe is so flexible thatI think you can substitute  ingredients and spices, and make  many variations.

This recipe was pretty good. I made it twice, the second time all I had was Tom Kha Gai soup in a can (instead of a can of coconut milk) which is a Thai coconut milk based soup with a hint of lemongrass. I got the can of soup from Whole Food and I've got to say, it made this recipe TO DIE FOR. It's great with or without the butternut squash too. Thanks for posting it.

We loved this soup -- none of us are vegan, just vegetarian.  I added some cardamom and cloves for more flavor.  It thickened up the next day and was wonderful served over jasmine rice.  Easy and delicious.

this soup was rich and i could only eat half a bowl. i'm not sure if it was to my liking. my boyfriend said it was good though. i didn't add the fenugreek seeds or cayenne pepper. maybe those are the ingredients that make the soup? i don't think i'd try it again. thanks for the recipe though.

Great recipe. I made it with buttermilk instead of coconut mild (okay, not vegan now), for a less sweet, more tangy flavor. Also added carrots and substituted acorn squash for butternut. This all worked out fine.
