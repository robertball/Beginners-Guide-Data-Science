Making this cake for the 2nd time tonight. My nephew, who loves Boston Cream Pie, loves this cake. Tomorrow is his birthday and he requested that I make it. Easy and delicious! Did not change a thing.

There's nothing here not to like! I made the boxed cake mix just like it is written for the brand I bought (just less oil). I poured the pudding over and let that sit overnight. The next morning I poured the chocolate over the cake and let that sit for several hours. Everyone loved it and it was simple to make!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe. However, I agree with another reviewer that the 2 boxes of pudding produces way too much. I made both boxes and could not put it all on the cake without it overflowing. I don't know if I could have fit more if I'd poked more holes in the cake. Don't make the mistake that I made and start making the pudding too early. Wait until the cake is cooled before mixing the pudding as it thickens quickly. The chocolate topping was really quite simple to make and delicious. However, I found it took at least 10 min. on med-low heat for bubbles to appear, not the 3 min. written in the recipe. After spreading the pudding on the cake, make sure to refrigerate for an hour before spreading on the chocolate. As suggested, after spreading on the chocolate, let it harden in the fridge overnight as suggested for best results. Keep in fridge until serving as the chocolate gets more gooey (and harder to cut), as it warms up to room temperature. I had many positive comments about this cake from family! It made 16 good-sized pieces.

I didn 't  like this cake me ( neither did my Son in Law, famous for eating Everthing) used 1 box of pudding and still the cake was a gooey mess. Probably the box mix which always taste to me  as an artificial case like  creation. I always try these recipes hoping for a miracle that the box cake will taste better or at least not bad. BTW  I always use Angel food box cakes, because 1. I don't like Angle Food cake so I won't be eating it 2. No way am I using a dozen eggs for something I am not eating.
