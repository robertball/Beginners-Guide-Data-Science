This had an interesting taste I kept going back for (I couldn't decide if I loved, or hated, the basil), but the consistency is a bit gluey and it's not visually appealing.  You may have a hard time convincing picky eaters to give this one a try.  It was super simple to throw together, though I do NOT recommend my tweaks (which I'll share to save others:  I increased the salt to TWO tsps....way too much and I subbed 1/2 tsp white pepper and 1/4ish+ tsp crushed red for the black because I hate black pepper...a bit too much heat)...fear not, my review is NOT based on my tweaks.  It's definitely worth giving a try for a quick weeknight dinner on a chilly fall day.  THANKS for the recipe!

I don't normally have frozen onion on hand, so I chopped up a fresh onion.  Simple and tasty

This is such an easy and tasty soup. With no fake condensed soup starter. The only thing I changed was to use dill weed instead of oregano. But that's just my personal preference. It was delicious!
