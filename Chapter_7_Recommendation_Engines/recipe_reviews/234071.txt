I was planning on salt, pepper and searing the tuna I bought, but I decided to look for a recipe here instead. This was a great one. The tuna turned out great -- very tasty and savory. This is a keeper1

Perfect as is.  Marinated two pounds of thick ahi steaks for three hours and they were delicious after grilling. Not too sweet or too salty. Nice balance of flavors.

I love grilled tuna and this was a very flavorful way to make it. I did cut back on the sesame oil because a little goes a long way-and on the honey. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Since I grilled it, I also just sprinkled black sesame seeds over as garnish. With leftovers, I made salad nicoise the next day. Both lovely. I will certainly make this again.

I made this last time I was in the Philippines. There I can buy whole fresh tuna for about $5! I couldn't find the Japanese rice wine but had everything else. It was amazing! Cooked for about 2 minutes on each side in this case as the fillets were quite thick. I'll be doing this one again!

This was delicious and easy to do! I followed the recipe,  marinated the tuna steaks during the day, about 4-5 hrs, then coated and seared as directed. My fiance loved it! Will definitely make again!

This recipe sounded so good.  I followed it as written, and marinated for about four hours then pan seared them.  my son took one bite and ate his broccoli instead, while my husband and I just ate it so $10 wouldn't be wasted.  It just didn't have any taste beyond the vinegar and onions.  I won't be making this again.

So good!  This Asian  marinade/sauce is delicious! I made  a second batch to use as a dipping sauce for frozen packaged  dumplings I served with the tuna. I will  definitely be making this again YUM!
