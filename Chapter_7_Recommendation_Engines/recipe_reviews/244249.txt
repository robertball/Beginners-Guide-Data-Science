Great recipe! I used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese and  skipped the bacon. I only had buttermilk on hand, so I  used a quarter cup buttermilk and a quarter cup water. Turned out very well! Will definitely make this again.

this came out awesome! i changed a few things. im a vegetarian so no bacon, added chopped onion and garlic, mixed Swiss cheese with cheddar and used 1/4C heavy cream instead of milk. also make sure to cover crust edges with foil so it doesn't brown too much. great recipe amd great idea for the cream cheese!!

Delicious! Nearly doubled the kale and it was no problem. I did take another reviewerâ€™s suggestion and steamed it quickly (in the microwave) before placing it in the crust- then mixed and added the other ingredients on top. Big hit!

Loved this!  I added 1/2 a diced onions and sauted them with the chopped kale first in olive oil, then I put that mixture through my food processor.  I also used a few different types of cheeses (Swiss and Mexican Blend).  We all loved this recipe.

I had a taste for a quick and easy quiche.  I kale, as I am not a spinach fan, and decided to give it a try.  I didn't have any cream cheese, so  I substituted it with 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  Added some finely chopped onion and bacon pieces. A little personal seasonal I like and put it all together.  Waalah, it came out fantastic.  May even try a phyllo dough crust.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The only thing I did differently was Saute the kale until it wilted. I was worried it would all fit, there was a lot of kale. It came out amazing!! We all loved it. Great use for my home grown kale. Thank you!

This was really good! Only changes I made was I omitted the bacon and added 1 chopped Leek. My husband and kids really loved it and it was super easy to make.
