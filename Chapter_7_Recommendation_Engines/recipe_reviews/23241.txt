This one is pretty good, however you can't be afraid to play with the ingredients depending on your tastes. To thick? Add as much water as you need to to thin it out to your liking. That goes for the next day as well. I used mild sausage and only one small pkg of pepperoni slices that I cut in half. I found out a long time ago that noodles sitting in soup makes mush. Cook the noodles first and keep them seperate from the soup until you dish it up. That way the soup won't thicken too much and the noodles stay firm. Hope this helps.

This is great. My oldest child loved it, saying it was better than pizza. I put in an extra cup of water and it still came out pefect. Had it with garlic bread sticks and a salad. Will be making this from now on. I don't even like peppers (I pick them off my pizza) but I sure ate them in this. I used someone elses' idea and used 3 different colored peppers to give it different colors. :)

Made exactly as written except that I only used 1 pound of sausage. This was indeed spicy as stated and it had a wonderful flavor. The only reason I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because as written you end up with a pizza bake type thing and not a soup. This definitely requires more water than called for if you want soup. I was afraid I would lose a lot of flavor by adding more water but it really didn't. I added some olives for topping. Very flavorful soup and one I will make again.

This was a hit! It made alot so we invited our neighbors to share it with us, they loved every bite! I added more spice and garlic, used Italian meatballs instead of sausage and used 1 red, yellow and orange pepper instead of 3 green. It was delicious, we will make it again for sure!

I played with this recipe a bit to make it healthier and full of flavor without adding a ton of sugar or fat. I used ground turkey in place of italian sausage and I only added just a few slices of chopped turkey pepperoni just for the flavor. I did use red and yellow bell peppers as I don't care for green peppers, a ton of fresh minced garlic and two cans fire roasted tomatoes.  I did cut back on the water a bit and used one can condensed beef broth and I took the suggestion from the recipe's description to add just a little chopped black olives. To make this more pizza-like, I added my own pizza seasoning blend which also helps make the ground turkey seem like sausage and adds more flavor instead of fat. I did not add the pasta only because I'm watching my carb intake. I browned the meat and sauteed the vegetables and just threw everything in the crockpot to cook all day. Already an hour and a half in and it smells incredible. This will feed me all week, two meals a day, it'll be incredibly filling and really low in calories not to mention.....it was cheap to make!

This is new favorite in our house. I use one pound of hot italian chicken sausage and about a half a pack of turkey pepperoni. I also use tortellini instead of the elbow macaroni to make it a little more filling. Everyone just raves when I make this!

We loved this.  I added 2 extra cups of water and found that it took 30 minutes for the macaroni to cook.  Even better the second day.   Much like a goulash on day 2.

We really liked this recipe.  Based on other reviews of soup being too thick I only used one can of tomato sauce.  I also used Jimmy Dean Italian sausage (no casings) and it tasted terrific!  I also used another reviewer suggestion and did not add pasta to the soup at all.  I just poured the soup over the pasta until the pasta was swimming in it.  Pasta stayed firm and was delicious.  Made great leftovers too!

So good!  It did need a little extra water, but that was an easy fix.  I didn't have Italian sausage, so I used the andouie we had in the house.  So Spicy and tasty.  I did add a little cayenne pepper just to up the spicyness.  My husband gobbled it up, and we even had enough for lunches the next day.  Thanks Tammie!!

Tasted too much like spaghetti sauce and not enough like I thought pizza soup would taste. My husband said he would not want it again and he'll eat about anything without complaint. Like others said, macaroni should be added to each serving seperately and not left in the pot.  I used the leftovers as a pasta sauce the second day.

Great unique soup!  We found it a little greasy even though we cut the quantity of pepperoni in half and tried to skim off the grease (didn't work).  We really liked it, but next time we'll try using turkey pepperoni.  I bet it is great with bread sticks.

I had high hopes but was disappointed by this recipe.  I didn't have hot italian sausage but am thankful I didn't, as the massive amount of pepperoni was more than enough for my family and me.  Even without the extra pound and a half of meat and with an extra cup and a half of water, my finished "soup" was more of a liquidy pepperoni-mushroom-pepper blob than actual soup.  I will not make this "soup" again.

I used only 2 green peppers, 1 onion, and less pepperoni then the recipe called for a felt this was still an extremely hardy soup.  A good soup, just a little heavy on the meat for my taste!  I think I might try using ground sausage next time.

Good soup. I used turkey sausage and turkey pepperoni and only used a 1.5 pounds of meat total. I also added more of the veggies to make up for using less meat.  After reading the reviews about it being too thin, I added an extra cup of water (which was good because it was a perfect soupy texture at the end). I tasted it about halfway through simmering and found it needed some flavour so I added granulated garlic and some pizza spice. I served it with breadsticks for dipping. It turned out really well - both my husband and brother liked it a lot. Plus there's lots of leftovers for lunches :)

My family enjoyed this soup. I used ground beef instead of italian sausage and a bag of mini pepperonis, only one green pepper and one onion, a can of sliced mushrooms and half a can of sliced black olives, and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. I added a lot of italian seasoning and parsley. I cooked the pasta seperate because I wanted to save some plain for my kids. I felt like it was missing something, not quite sure what though.

This did not work out as well as I had hoped. As I was putting it together, I realized that there were no herbs in it. Only the spices from the sausage and pepperoni. So I added oregano, basil,parsley,marjoram and a tablespoon of sugar. This helped. Everybody ate it but it didn't get the kind of appreciation I thought it would get. The cheese was a big plus as far as I was concerned. I'm not sure I'll bother to make it again.

Yum! While I prefer Keni's pizza soupreme (you can find this recipe on Group Recipes), this is a close second. You end up with pretty much the same soup in the end anyways (IMHO). As is, I felt this called for WAY too much meat, so I only used 1 lb. of sausage and a single (8 oz.) package of pepperoni (which I chopped). I added two bell peppers to my soup and saved the remaining one as garnish. Because my hubs and I HATE mushrooms, I left them out altogether. I used Italian seasoned tomato sauce, subbed chicken broth for the water called for and added a couple cloves of (minced) garlic and 1 t Italian herbs / 1/2 t crushed red pepper flakes. I mistakenly requested that my husband pick up GROUND sausage, so that's what I had to work with. :) My final change was to brown my sausage and veggies FIRST, and then add the remaining ingredients / spices and simmer as directed. With these changes, our soup was PERFECT! Topping each bowl with Italian-blend cheese, sliced black olives (for our dinner guest - we also HATE olives!), chopped green pepper and red onion really hit the spot. Garlic breadsticks rounded out our meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tammie! :-)

This makes a TON of soup! I agree with the other's that said that this needs more water. I added 3 additional cups. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning to taste and a can of diced tomatoes. This recipe freezes and reheats very well.  Mmm, very good soup, thanks for the recipe:)

This is one amazing soup!  I was a little skeptical that it would actually be a good soup, even with the good reviews.  I thought it might be a little bland or boring.  But, boy was I wrong.  The flavors are perfect.  I did add about 3 cups of extra water because I wanted more of a soup consistency than a stew and cooked the pasta separately.  I skipped the sausage because we're not big fans, but I know it would be just as good with the it.  I garnished it with mozzarella, parmesan and some chopped olives.  The perfect Fall soup, or anytime meal.  Thanks for the awesome recipe that will be used many times!

I enjoyed this soup.  After reading the reviews, I cut everything in half except the crushed tomatoes, the tomato sauce, and the water (I used half water and half beef broth).  The consistency was perfect.  I also sauteed the sausage and vegetables in olive oil before adding the other ingredients, to add that caramelization, and to reduce cooking time.  I also added garlic and plenty of dried oregano and basil, plus just a pinch of sugar, and about a half cup of red wine.  Oh, and for the pepperoni, I found these adorable little mini pepperonis, I think from Hormel.  They are about the size of an aspirin.  Perfect size for this.  Easier than the minestrone that I usually make, and just as tasty.  I'll make it again.  Gave it 4 stars bc my husband thought it was just OK.

MMMMM good.  Tried using turkey pepperoni instead of regular.  Still good, but I think next time I'll use the regular kind.  Tastes like the inside of a calzone...yummy!

Loved it.....family was impressed....I did used lean turkey sausage and turkey pepperoni t cut the fat. I also used chicken broth instead of water....I did also add an aadditional 2c of water to this as I thought it was kinda thick because of the paste. Also added 1/2 a red pepper to all the veggies and 3 cloves of garlic minced. I cooked the elbows seperately and added to each persons bowl and then ladeled the hot soup over the cooked pasta. This was such a tasty pizza-y meal....it really tasted just like pizza w/o the crust. Will make again....thanks!

I put mine in the slow cooker to see how it would turn out, well it came out very good.  I browned the sausage, then added the green peppers and onions until slightly soft.  I put the liquid ingredients in the slow cooker with garlic and italian seasoning, then added the meat mixture to it.  Cooked on high for about 2 hours, then added the uncooked macaroni and turned the temp to low and left it there for probably 2 hours.  I topped each serving with sliced olives  and sprinkled with mozzarella cheese.  This was thick enough to serve on a plate, which is the way my husband prefers his soup.  I served this with garlic bread.  Good recipe!

I used this as a guide and made it into a casserole. Sauteed up the veggies and sauces (what I had on hand, to desired whatever) and cooked noodles separately and then mixed them together, put into a casserole dish, added cheese on top, cooked for a bit, added olives and more cheese, cooked a bi more, and it was good.

Overall not very good.  I had high hopes for this soup, but found that it was just a thinned out spaghetti sauce. I would suggest finding a good tomato soup base and then adding the necessary "pizza" ingredients.  Unfortunately, what you make from tomato sauce will always taste like tomato sauce, not tomato soup.  Good idea though, and a better blend of ingredients than most other pizza soup recipes I've looked at.

I thought this soup was very tasty.  I lightened it up by omitting the sausage, and using turkey pepperoni.  I also used the frozen 3 pepper blend with onion to speed things along.  I threw in some mushrooms I had and wished I had some black olives. I used the diced tomatoes seasoned with oregano, garlic and basil.  I think this soup could have used a bit more garlic.  My son and I both loved it!

I doubled the recipe for my Thursday soup group and they all thought it was very tasty.
It is easy to put together which I like alot.
I used mild Italian sausage so then it used some crushed red pepper flakes. I'll be making it again.

Great flavor.  Don't add too much pasta or it will become very thick.  Will definitely do again.

This recipe sounds great, but I'm a little confused with your recipe. The ingredients list "Crushed" tomatoes, yet in the procedure it lists "Diced" tomatoes. Also you state to add the macaroni during the last 15 minutes. Is the pasta cooked or raw when added

Loved this soup.  As others advised, I added more liquid.  First of all I used a light chicken broth (from Better than Bullion).  Then I ended up adding an additional 2 cups of Vegetable broth at the end. I did cook the macaroni separately and added at the end, and also topped with sliced black olives along with the cheese. I halved the recipe since there are just two of us, and ended up using 6 cups total of broth.  Other than that, followed as written.  My hubby and I both loved the flavor and texture of this soup.  Served with store-bought garlic breadsticks.

Mine turned out more like a pasta dish rather then a soup dish. To many noodles in mine maybe. I use half a jar of pizza sauce to give it more of a pizza flavor. I used less bell peppers and onions. Tweeked just the way we like it.  I'll be making again.

Instead of using the sausages, I browned lean hamburger. After it was simmered and noodles were done, I added heated pepperoni (soaked up the grease first). Then topped it with mozzarella and black olives. Using the hamburger saved on boiling and simmering time. Thought it turned out pretty good!!

I loved it. Cooked the sausage before making soup & added all the drippings from the pan. I also added a few whole garlic cloves for the garlic lover in me. Just like another review I read , I like to keep the macaroni seperate. Great recipe for the pizza lover.

Delicious soup!  I only gave it four stars because I had to put quite a bit of liquid in so it was actually soupy.  It was a personal choice to leave out the elbow pasta and used trottole pasta instead.  I cooked it separately and poured the soup over it.  I also used mini pepperonis because it was easier.  The husband loved it as well so I will make it again.

This is my husband's favorite! I make it exactly as written although it is still comes out fine if you cut the simmer time down. I cannot believe how flavorful this dish is when you add no seasonings. I serve with garlic bread.

It's amazing how flavorful this is without any added spices/seasonings. My family enjoyed it a lot so I will make it again. It's really reminiscent of sausages and peppers and it is very thick. I did not add additional water as others did so it was really a stew, not a soup. But I like stew. Very, very easy.

This is one of my family's favorite soups. Even my father likes it and he is not a soup fan. Plus you can add ingredients to make it your own or remove something if your family doesn't like it.

Delicious soup!  Reduced the amount of onions and bell peppers because of personal preferences.  Added in some chopped fresh basil for extra flavor. Also added some beef broth to thin out the soup.  Soup was delicious and even my picky son ate an entire bowl and asked to have the leftovers the next night.

This was very tasty...yet I think that it should be called Spicy Pizza Stew.  I followed the directions exactly except I put about 4 more cups of water in it.  Still this was more like a glorified goulash.  My family loved it so you can't really go wrong. Just don't expect a soup consistency.

In our opinions, this is a good but not fantastic recipe. I didn't include sausage because I don't like it. (It's the texture. I just hate coarse-ground sausage...) I used regular canned tomatoes with freshly-pressed garlic. It was way too thick so I just added more water. Quick and tasty, but not outstanding.

This was very tasty. My kids liked it a lot. I cut the recipe in half but still used 4 cups of water.  I might cook this in the crockpot next time.
