This chicken was absolutely fantastic.  I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about, as it had so much flavor it was incredible.  I couldn't find Boursin cheese at my grocery store, so I substituted honey nut cream cheese for it, and it was absolutely scrumptious.

You could not have better chicken with only 4 ingredients.  This is very simple and very tasty.  I prepared as is, but when I went to put the honey on the chicken, the bacon was not cooked much, so I added the honey and turned the oven up to 400 degrees, baked 10 more minutes & it came out perfect.  Will definitely make again. Only gave 4 stars, because it wasn't the best chicken ever, but it is excellent & easy.

I read the reviews and made a couple of minor changes that I think made all the difference for the success of the dish. We half-way-cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken. Also, once the chicken was wrapped in bacon and placed in the baking dish, we sprinkled the bundles with dried thyme and misted them with olive oil. Our chicken pieces were large, so they needed about 35 minutes to cook, but that was not a problem. We enjoyed the recipe and will use it again in the future.

This recipe has some possibility...as is it has almost no flavor.  The parts of the chicken with just honey on it is too bland...adding some spices or breading and cutting the honey might help.

This was tasty, but as the other review's have said you can not taste much of the honey and I but way more of it on the chicken than called for. The bacon was taking longer to cook so I turned the oven up to 400 degrees for the last 10 minutes of baking like someone else stated to do in one of the previous reviews and the bacon then turned out perfect. All in all like this recipe and will be using again, but will try and spice it up a little more next time.

I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I both ate it up and wanted more.  I only gave it 4 stars because the bacon didnt cook very well and I cooked it a lot longer than suggested.  I think I may slightly precook the bacon next time to see how it comes out.  This will definatly be made every few weeks at my house.

Excellent!  Even my very picky 11-yr old like it!  I read other reviews about bacon issues.  I used the pre-cooked bacon (usually meant for the microwave) and it turned out perfect!!  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night for the first time girlfriend. I still have 2 pieces left over which we are going to eat today. 

I didn't really get a strong honey flavor. But that didn't take away from the great taste.

Used goat cheese instead (couldn't find the one in the recipie), also added a 1.5 oz of dark spiced rum to the honey for flavor. Great, and juicy.

I used 3 slices of bacon on each breast and used Gouda cheese, breaded them with crushed potato chips and drizzled peanut oil over them, then lightly salted after they came out of the oven, also i cooked them @400 degrees for ten additional min. they came out great and the bacon was perfectly cooked.

This was incredibly simple to prepare!  I chose to add some garlic chees croutons into the boursin cheese, and then seasoned the chicken w/ some black pepper, granulated garlic, and italian seasoning.  I only used one slice of bacon - but wow, this was really good!

This recipe sounds delicious but unless you add salt before eating it, it's surprisingly bland. I think that if I added more honey just before I ate it, that may have made a difference, but I was quite surprised that with all those tasty ingredients that the final product tasted like something was missing. I would make it again but will probably make a few changes to the ingredients next time.

In all fairness, I really can't give this recipe an honest review b/c I substituted velveeta for boursin cheese.  I always have velveeta on hand so I thought I would give it a try.  It was terrible!!!  However, this really maybe a great-tasting recipe with the boursin cheese.  Also, it took me a while to prepare because I had lots of trouble cutting a pocket in each breast. If I make this again, I will definitely hunt down some boursin cheese.

I loved this recipe.  Simple and yet full of flavor (not sure why people thought this lacked in flavor).  I didn't add any salt but used regular bacon (which has plenty enough sodium in it) and the boursin cheese was delish!  Husband and I agree that this should be in the normal dinner rotation.

I totally forgot the honey drizzle, but I still thought it tasted delicious.  I will try the drizzle next time and see what it adds.

Edit:  I have since tried the honey drizzle and it is still excellent.  It adds just that little something else and has a salty, and slightly sweet flavor to it.  Yum, yum!  My husband and I agree that the honey just adds something more to it.  But if you're not a fan of honey, you can still make it without and it'll just be delicious.  I did cook the bacon for a little while beforehand to get a slight crisp to it when it cooked with the chicken.  While I was cutting the pocket and filling it with cheese, I had the bacon in the oven (so almost 10 min. at 350).  This is the only change that I made to the recipe.

I have been making this recipe for years and my kids and husband love it! As most have I did alter the recipe a tad.  I seasoned the chicken (not heavily since it is wrapped in bacon) with granulated garlic, a little adobo seasoning (or Italian seasoning if I have it)and brown it in a pan to seal in the spices (2 -5 minutes on each side). I stuff the chicken with the Boursin cheese and chopped spinach and yum...always leaves them asking for more!!!

I used prosciutto instead of bacon as other reviews said the bacon was too thick. The chicken was nice but not out of this world. I don't think the honey added anything to the dish as you couldn't really taste it.

Pretty darn good. Pretty easy. Microwave bacon for about 3 minutes before wrapping it around the chicken. Seasoned with mojito lime chicken seasoning.

Note: I did not include bacon.  I thought the stuffed aspect was nice, and the brush of honey helped, but the chicken itself was pretty flavorless.

Very good, but I had trouble getting it to bake all the way through.  Next time I'll use thinner bacon and wrap it a bit more loosely perhaps.
