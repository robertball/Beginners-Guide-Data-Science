Delicious!  I used laughing cow lite swiss cheese instead of cream cheese.

This was so delicious.  I am now making this for the third time.  I made it for my family for breakfast and they said it was PERFECT and they absolutely loved it.  Since I don't eat red meat I left out the ham.  I also have added mushrooms to the eggs and I have found that to be good.  I added grated mozzarella cheese on the top and it was truly one of the best omelets I had ever tasted.

This was awsome! Everybody loved it! Some of us also added some spinach, which also made for a good change (Not too much or it overpowers the omelet)

This was great! I used onion powder, canadian bacon, regular eggs, and neufchatel cheese. Thanks Michelle for the great idea.

This was a nice change from the typical omelet.  I didn't use onion, but I'll try them next time.  I used regular eggs and this came out great.  My hubby commented how good it was.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

My omelet fell apart when flipping it over, so the presentation wasn't too nice, but the taste was! I used regular eggs and regular cream cheese, and added some sliced mushrooms for more substance. Very good brunch!

I changed an already good recipe... I used real eggs, and I didnt have cream cheese so I just put in slices of colby-jack cheese. They were by far the best omeletes I have ever had!!!

Made this for my parents and boyfriend, they loved it so much, my mom made me email her the recipe. I used only egg whites to cut the fat, I added spinach and mushrooms, and I used sliced honey ham (which I cut into strips). It didn't look very pretty because it was my first omelet.

Yummy.  I did substitute some based on what had available.  Used some cooked sweet italian sausage leftover from pizza earlier in week rather than ham.  Cleaning out the pantry and fridge! Also used 4 eggs rather than egg substitute.  Jazzed up with a bit of Aizona Dreaming from Penzeys Spices.  Yum.

I used whole eggs instead of egg substitute and didnt add the onion. I used a shaved ham since its easier for me to eat. I had dental surgery and this was good and filling and easy on my gums. I like the cream cheese in it. Also I was able to perfectly fold this omelet and thats a first. Thank you.

I love how creamy this is. I will definitely make this again experimenting with different meats and spices.

I just now made this. It is on my kids plate for dinner (why not) waiting to cool down a bit. I used whatever deli meat I had in the fridge (sliced turkey) and diced it. I used regular egg with skim milk and added the seasonings in the egg mixture before pouring it in the skillet. I also used sliced swiss cheese. I added dried mushroom too. THis is a keeper. Tastes so good.
