I love this recipe.  I just use a bag of cranberries (12 oz), one orange, one granny smith apple, and anywhere from 1-2 cups of sugar.  I like it sweet cause I don't put it directly on my turkey.  Everyone always asks me to make this relish over regular cranberry sauce, year after year.

I love a good fresh cranberry relish!!  I have been making my own version of this for several years, and it is DEMANDED!! not requested  :)  every year for Thanksgiving.  One note:  I add chopped pecans and some allspice to mine.  And it is best to make at least one day ahead to let the flavors blend together.  Just an idea to try for your own.  Happy Turkey day!

I am not a fan of uncooked relishes, so I modified this recipe a little.  I boiled 1.5 cups of water with sugar to dissolve it, then added the rest of the ingredient.  I let it simmer until the apples are soft and then cooled and stored it in the fridge.  Very good on turkey and cornbread.

Aside from making a huge mess with my food processor, everyone LOVED this recipe.  I added crushed pineapple, pecans and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Be sure to strain for couple minutes before adding sugar and refridgerating.

This is a Thanksgiving must!  I use half the sugar and it's fine for us, especially if the apples are very sweet.

I'm not a big cranberry fan and this was so good I took a bowl of it to work for lunch.  Everybody including all the grandkids who won't touch the "sauce" at least tasted it and said it was good.

This is just like the recipe my aunt used to make.  Thank you for posting.  Although it freezes well, this makes a lot of relish.  I made half a recipe, which was enough for a large Thanksgiving dinner and (kept in the freezer) a small Christmas meal.  I also used only half of the recommended sugar.  I prefer relish on the tart side rather than sweet.

Being a diabetic I used sucralose in place of sugar for this recipe.  No one knew the difference. It's great with ham or turkey plus it makes a  wonderful dessert for me mixed with cottage cheese or sugar free gelatin.

This is the BEST cranberry dish I have ever eaten.  Easy, fresh, great texture, tangy, sweet, healthy ... IT'S PERFECT!

I added crushed pineapple and pecans to mine.  Yummy, can't wait to make it again.

This has been a family favorite, passed down through the generations. It is best if made the night before and chilled for 24 hours. We also add nuts, walnuts or pecans. I cut down on the sugar and still love it. Besides tasting great, it adds a nice color to the meal.

This is "THE" family tradition in our home for Thanksgiving.   As a child we took turns grinding the cranberries, apples and oranges but the recipe was doubled and we made it a couple days before Thanksgiving.  The longer it sets the better it is. Now I still make it with the old hand grinder but with my granddaughter.  I want her to keep it in the family!!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  Normally I love cranberry relish, but I felt like this was missing something.  It was also a little too runny for my liking.  I might add it again but put some of my own finishes on it (chopped celery is always nice, as is a handful of toasted walnuts or toasted pecans).

This is quick and delicious! I only had a 12 oz bag of cranberries so I halved the recipe.One orange, one apple and one cup of sugar. I put the whole orange in, rind, pith and all. It's very, very tasty. The amount of sugar is a matter of personal choice; next time, I will use 1/2 to 2/3 cup of sugar as I prefer it a litle less sweet.  My husband's aunt used to make something very similar to this every Thanksgiving. She used honey as a sweetner and always added some chopped walnuts.

This recipe is very easy and a great compliment to Thanksgiving dinners! I do not add the orange peel to mine and add a dash or two of cinnamon. Perfect! I always make it the night before so that all the flavors have time to mix together.

We've made this every year for years now.  It's fabulous.  I usually make it a day or two beforehand.  The texture is best if you let it drain in a strainer for an hour or so.  If it gets too dry, just add a little of the drained liquid back in.

I've used this recipe for a few years and my family loves it.  I've tried this as a cold relish and have cooked it as well.  My family prefers it cooked, so that's how I usually prepare it.  I also put it in pint jars, process it in a water bath caner and give it out as a thanksgiving gift.  We often eat it after thanksgiving on leftover rolls and sometimes over ice cream.

i was a little confused about what part of the peel to use.  at first it was too bitter from the skin but i added no skin to the next batch along with finely chopped walnuts and that did the trick.  i would make it again with a little tweaking of the recipe.

Excellent!  I halved this recipe for my family this Thanksgiving and didn't use quite as much sugar.  It was a hit!  The little bit left over disappeared quickly on sandwiches.  GREAT recipe.

Super easy and very showy! Makes the house smell like the holidays. Not as sweet as some relishes, which makes it perfect for the dinner table.

My mother in law taught me a similar recipe years ago. We don’t use quite as much sugar, and we do add chopped pecans, but there is nothing better with turkey! Thanks for putting this recipe out there for those who don’t know about this terrific Thanksgiving side. I should have done it myself!

I love this recipe. My family asks for this every Thanksgiving. I would be in trouble of I didn't make. But I cut it in half because it makes a ton of relish.

I cut back a little on the sugar and I think next time I'll add another 12oz bag of cranberries so it will be a little redder :)  ...  but it tastes wonderful as is!!

Delicious and popular. I love this fresh alternative to cranberry sauce. I used the juice of 3 of the oranges and a cup and a half of sugar. I made it the day of, but it would also work if made the day before.
