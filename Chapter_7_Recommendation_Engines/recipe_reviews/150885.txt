I served this over the weekend at my senoritas and margaritas oscar party. They were a huge hit! The girls all love it. They said it reminded them of a'top shelf bartenders' margarita'. I save time, I squeezed the lime juice ahead of time and mixed up a big batch of these when everyone was ready for a refill.
