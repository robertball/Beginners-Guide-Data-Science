Beets were great. I've made them several times. The only change I made was to add some sliced red onion.

Needs more spices.  I added cinnamon, ground the cloves and added them both to the hot brine.  I also added sliced onions to the  beets in the jars.

This is an excellent recipe - However....1. the recipe doesn't specify jar size.  This is important because the larger the jar, the longer the required processing.  2. The recipe says to cook the beets about 15 minutes: it's more like 30 - 45 minutes.
3.  Almost all sources today will say to process pickled beets 30 minutes, rather than the 10 in this recipe.  Lastly, to those who would peel the beets before cooking - I would encourage you NOT to do so.  Cooking them whole reduces the "bleeding" but they're so easy and quick to peel after cooking, and less waste.
It may seem that given my comments above that 4 stars is overrating the recipe but I do like the simple nature of Sharon Howard's farmer's wife's recipe and will continue to use it in future whenever I can beets with the changes I've noted

There is way too much cloves in this recipe. You can hardly taste the beet, and it made my tongue numb.

This recipe is just fine - no cinnamon or other spices - they are not spiced pickled beets, just pickled beets. Some people like to add onion, but not me or Juanita ever add onion.

I got creative using some modern flair:  I used both red & yellow beets. It's very attractive in the jar! And they both have such distinct flavors that when they pickled you can taste the difference!  When cooking the beets, I added a few whole cloves & peppercorns, a cinnamon stick, orange and onion slices which flavored the juice that will be used for brining. It's not spicy just complex.  Then when I made the brine, I used apple cider vinegar and unrefined cane sugar.  Then I used quart jars and placed a single clove, a slice of orange and peppercorns in the bottom.  So far, so good!

This recipe is similar to mine but a lot more work than mine, with sterilizing, etc. I simply buy a bunch of beets (usually 3 with the leaves). I peel them with potato peeler, cut them into bite size pieces, cover with water in pot, add 1/2 cup each sugar and vinegar, 1/2 to 1 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp salt and cook over medium heat for half hour. Then I just put them in any container and store in refrigerator for up to 6 months. They are always great. I make them frequently so I don't have to can them. I then use the beet leaves chopped up in any ham soup (discarding stems). The leaves are delicious in soups and very little waste.

This recipe is not bad but the acid is way too high, so adding equal parts water and vinegar will be perfect. Also, I added 1 tsp of allspice, 1 tsp of cinnamon and then 1/2 cup pickling spices tied in a cheese cloth to the pot. I bake the small beets in their skins in the oven at 400 f for 1 hour and once cooked, plunge them in cold water and the skins simply slip off. Trust me this is way better than peeling them, which is so tedious, and the flavour.....  It doesn't matter the size you choose to cut them, the flavour is wonderful. My husband hated beets until I made them this way, now, he eats them at every meal.

I made these back in September and they turned out really well. I've been eating them for the past few months.  I do have to say that the cloves were a bit much.  I only added a few cloves per jar and it was quite strong.  Still a good recipe though.  Very easy for my first time making pickled beets!

I LOVE this recipe, My grandmother ,Dagmar, came to Canada during WW2 from Estonia and when they immigrated here the family got jobs on a beet farm just outside of Lethbridge, Alberta.  Her specialty was Sugar Beets she called them and this is the recipe!!! I am so grateful to have found it on this website.  I made two 2L jars and it brought back such a wonderful memory Thank You So Much!  Lori Brinkworth, Thunder Bay. On Canada

Used this recipe last fall to can pickled beets.  It is very similar to the recipe I use to make pickled eggs and beets.  I usually just canned beets plain, but decided to try pickling them this year.  The only change I made was to use cider vinegar.  The beets turned out to be great.  Plan on planting more beets this year now that I have a great recipe to use in canning them.

Super easy...even for this canning newbie.  I never have 10 pounds of beets at at time, so I pared down the recipe.  I also peeled and sliced the beets before cooking.  They are very yummy.

when you first boil your beets leave about 2 inches of stem on them... This will prevent them bleeding out so bad

Ahhhhh LOVE it!!! This is exactly the same as my grandma's recipe!!  I got some beets and came hunting for a recipe because I don't have Grandma's anymore.  I"m sure this is exactly it.  I have made them before but lost the recipe.  I will NOT forget this time that 1/4 cup of whole cloves means spread out through all the jars and not 1/4 cup IN EACH JAR....lol.  I've learned a lot since then!

We loved these!  A little on the sweet side for my liking so next time will add less sugar.  Skipped the cloves all together and added  a 1/2 tsp. of whole peppercorn to the bottom of each jar.  10lbs of beets filled 7 - 1 quart jars packed loosely, but I did have to make extra brine for the last 3 jars. 
These will be a welcoming treat come the holidays.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This got me to eating beets.. I've made a few adjustments... add a cinnamon stick for each jar and also increase the cloves. I'm not canning them so I just put the whole peeled beets in hot water and then slice after they get soft. I usually am doing about a 26 oz. jar at a time.. tonight I'm making 2 as my produce co-op brought me beets 2 weeks in a row. Been great on a salad w/ goat cheese, pecans and mixed greens and a raspberry vinagrette - yummy!

Cook beets, cool until you are able to handle them.  The skin will come off easily in your hands (no need for a vegetable peeler).  Do not cut beets prior to cooking to ensure full flavour, colour and nutrients.  Proceed with recipe after skinning the beets.

Thanks for the recipe, Sharon! Absolutely stellar! I use my husband Jim as a litmus test on any pickeling recipes. According to Jim, no one cans quite like Mother Irene & Mother Mae. This one passed with flying colors! The recipe was simple to make and ready to eat the next day! I must say that this recipe made me look pretty doggone good! Thanks again...

Took advice of others re the cloves, however still found the cloves were a little overbearing.  Next year I will put 2 cloves in each bottle (1 litre canning jars).

Made this recipe for the first time this year.  My husband loves them so much, I just finished my third (or was it fourth?) batch a few minutes ago.  Thanks so much for a recipe that is sure to become a family staple!

My beets didn't grow very big this year but they were perfect size for pickling.  Tried several recipes but this one beet them all.  Made 4 quarts in July and they are all gone.  I even sliced them thin and put them on a sandwich, yummy yummy.

Wow! I'm not a huge beet fan but we planted a crop and had a ton of beets to use up. I canned a bunch today with this recipe (minus the cloves, I was all out) and it is phenomenal! I will definitely be doing this again!

Love the 'pickle' flavor of these, but way too much cloves...Beautiful color!! I will still be putting them out for Thanksgiving because they can be eaten with other things to cut down on the "spice" factor. Thanks!!

You shouldn't cut all of the stem or bottom off of the beets when you cook them because it will bleed all of the color out of the beets.  This doesn't look appealing.  Leave about 2 inches of stems on the beets and leave the tail, root, on while cooking.  Then, drop the cooked beets in cold water and the skin will slip right off.  They're easier to cut up and put in the jars after they're cooked too.

I've been looking for a good pickled beet recipe and this one is PERFECT.  The only thing I do differntly is I peel the beets before I cook them.  You never seem to get all the dirt off them.  Then I slice them on a mandolin made by Pampered Chef.  FAST AND EASY!!!!

I use a similar recipe but use just a couple of cloves and add a stick of cinnamon to the brine while it's heating.  My mother in law (many years ago) put in a sprig of fresh dill in one jar and we never make it without the dill anymore.  It's awesome!

I love this revipe. I don't can them I freeze them. Fully cooked sliced and brine poured over left to sit overnight in refrigerator and then packed in zip lock bags. I use left over brine to pickle eggs. So good and super easy. Thank you for sharing.

Easy, straight forward recipe.  Taste just like the ones my grandma used to make.  The only change I made was adding half a cinnamon stick to each jar.

Perfect! Simple ingredients and excellent flavour. thanks for sharing! Just remember to wash and peel the beets first so you can use the water in the brine. I don't remember if the instructions specified this but I don't think it did! :) Will be going in my annual rotation for sure. Thanks for sharing.

I used demarara sugar instead of white sugar and red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. 10 lbs. of beets made 12 pint jars. I only used 1 Tbsp. of whole cloves because I prefer to keep the spices light. That way I can use the pickled beets in a variety of recipes without the cloves taking over. I had to make more brine to cover the last two jar's beets. I used 1/4 c. red wine vinegar, 2 Tbsp. demarara sugar, 2 Tbsp. water and 1/4 tsp. salt. With the modifications, the recipe tastes fantastic.

absolutely perfect! I made it as stated and didn't change a thing. Best pickled beets I've ever eaten. I used the direction "Add several whole cloves to each jar". I didn't measure out 1/4 cloves and split that equally between 10 pint jars. Maybe the reviewer who said there was way too much cloves did that???

Oh dear... Last night.we made 12 - 1 liter jars and just read other recipes that say we should have peeled the beets. This recipe didn't mention that so we didn't peel them!!! Are they going to be ok???

Excellent! I made these for the first time using beets that my husband grew in our garden. They turned out wonderful. I've never had pickled beets before but decided to make them because my husband is so fond of them. (And, what's better than fresh veggies...) The 3 year old would have eaten the whole jar if we let her, and she's a picky eater. I took the advice of other reviewers and peeled the beets before cooking them. I sliced them because I thought it would be easier for the 3 year old to eat. And, I added only 3 cloves to each jar. They don't seem to be overpowering but add just enough of the flavor. We let them sit 2-3 weeks before making another batch to give the flavors time to meld. I will make more as soon as our second round of beets is ready. Thanks for the recipe. We'll use this one again & again.

I love this recipe but i never have time to put up 10lbs at a time.  I make this recipe by using 1/8th of all ingredients..

1 1/4 lbs of beets
1/4 Cup of Sugar
1/2 Cup of Vinegar 
1/4 scant tsp. Salt

I peel the Beets and then boil for about 15 to 20 minutes depending on how big you cut them.

Put the Beets in a quart jar and then pour the Beets juice ,with the other ingredients mixed in, over the Beets. Let cool down then seal with a plastic Mason Jar lid and store in the frig.

I’ve made this twice, second time dialed back the cloves added bay leaf, cinnamon, allspice, mustard seed and coriander. I would suggest doubling the brine so you don’t come up short.

Outstanding. I used small quartered fresh beets and was successful with the ice-bath-cooling method immediately after cooking so skins weren't too much of a hassle. Rubber gloves are a beet peeler's best friend. Added a hint of cinnamon to brine. Use of a tied-off cheesecloth ball or a large tea infusion ball for boiling spices in the brine can work very well for these small batches. .  Added red onion to each pint jar but not to boiling brine. Tip: Gma's canning wisdom for judging amount of fruit or veggies for recipes involving canning jars: 'a pint is a pound, all way around'. So, one pound of beets roughly equals one pint. An excellent excellent recipe! Many thanks for the present day submission to the world of tech, and kudos to the wisdom of salt of the earth farmers and their families.

Yummy!  My husband always turned his nose up at beets (I love them!) but he really likes them pickled using this recipe. I made enough to can 3 quart jars so we’re enjoying them into the fall. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Very good recipe but I found the amount of sugar overwhelming as the beets themselves were very sweet. I also don't like cloves, so I made it with half the sugar - still too sweet but it is a preservative - and they turned out well. I'd make it again the same way

2nd year I've made this recipe. It is very good. I do add a few tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar, otherwise I follow the recipe. Pretty easy after prepping the beets!

You know I really love beets. However, I have found that they can be expensive when purchasing them from the store. I found them on sale and decided to can them. I used this recipe and boy did I hit the jackpot. I bought 15 bunches, each bunch had 3 medium to large beets. I would have preferred smaller beets; but, a sale is a sale at a $1.00 a bunch.
I follow this recipe with a few differences. I followed the suggestions of others and found that it was the right decision. I used two whole cloves, one slice of onion, one half stick of cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp of whole peppercorns per (16 ounce) pint jars. The amount of beets I had filled 12 pints and 2 quart jars. That is 2 1/2 beets per pint size jar. I had enough beet juice left over to make one quart of pickled eggs. (I had the same spices to make my pickled eggs. It really turned out fantastic.) The cloves were not over powering nor was the 1/2 stick of cinnamon. I did, however, cooked the beets for 30 minutes to 45 minutes (for the larger beets.) I removed them from a boiling pot into a pot filled with cold water. I used a knife to scrape the outer skin off the beets. I had a mandolin slicer and sliced the beets instead of cutting them into chunks or slicing them by hand. Once you cut them they will bled so I used new latex gloves to prevent any staining on my hands or cloths. As long as the beet juice is wet it will wash off except your cloths. I placed the lids on the jars and placed them in a hot water bath for 10 minutes

I grew beets in my garden for the first time this year, specifically for making pickled beets.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and adjusted the vinegar to water using equal amounts.  I wish I hadn't. Too bland.  Next time I will follow the recipe with the exception of the cloves.  I put about 5-6 in each pint jar and that was plenty.

This recipe turned out great.  I put the the beets and brine into jars and then put them in the microwave for five minutes on high.  I then put on canning lids (that I had heated in water) and rings on the jars. Every one of them sealed. It's a great way to can without all the hassle of using a canner, and we have enjoyed these beets all winter.

WAY too much cloves!!  I only had about 1/8 cup & it was still overpowering. Left my tongue numb. My girlfriend won't eat them & don't know if I will either. Maybe the clove taste will lessen over time but I'm not holding out much hope. What a waste of time & 5 quarts of beets from my garden. I should have read the reviews

This recipes was easy to follow, however it took a lot longer than 50 minutes.  It took 30 minutes for the beets to get nice and tender.  It took a total of about an hour and a half to two hours total prep time.

Very tasty....made it two years in a row.....only thing I would say is that it takes my 35 to 45 minutes to get my beets soft!    Not 10 minutes!

I only had 4 lbs of Cilindra Beets. I made the brine as directed for 10 lbs but only had 1 pint of brine extra. I used a mix of whole cloves & whole allspice putting 4 of each in each jar. I also put a stick of cinnamon in the brine when it cooked. I added the red onion in each jar also. I got 6 pints jars. Hope it comes out tasty. If so I will comment again.

As I only saw one other comment about how there is too much vinegar in the brine, I went ahead with it. Safety first as I wasn't going to process it. Just made it today and tasted the brine. I agree that there is too much vinegar.  For my personal taste, anyways. Found several recipes online with different proportions. Have brine leftover so will add a bit more water to that when I cook up some more beets tomorrow. One note : if you have an IP, they are awesome for cooking beets

I am a vendor at a farmers market in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  I made these to sell at my stand using another vendor's beets.  I did switch out the sugar for honey, and I can"t keep them on my shelves.  People love them!  Great Recipe!

We are on a keto diet. I substituted splenda for sugar and halved the amount. I also quartered the entire recipe as that is way too much for me. I peeled and boiled my beets and chopped them into matchsticks for use in salad. I didn't do the whole canning thing, just put them in a jar with pickling juice, placed in the fridge. Yummy!

Lots of beets this year and this is a great recipe.  The ratio of beets to liquid was spot on.  The only change I made was add a dozen whole cloves to the spice mix and I used a spice bag instead of  putting them in loose.  I also put 2 cinnamon sticks in the pot right from the start. and left them until tthey were in the road for bottling.

I made these last night, searching for the perfect pickled beet recipe. I'm sorry, these are the worst beets I've ever eaten. The clove was so overwhelming that you could have just been eating dirt and cloves.

I just finished making these! Never made pickled beets before! I have to say it was very easy to follow! However I ran out of the brine so I have to make more for the 7 pints I was able to make! I have not tried them yet, so we will see how they taste!

Firstly- 10 pounds means cooked and peeled, OR 11-12 # raw beets, secondly - I cut recipe in half making 5# (cooked and peeled- 6 # raw beets) and I got 7 pints  out of the recipe. And if you are making 1/2 a batch like I did make 3/4  of vinegar/sugar mixture. And one last item, pour the beet water through a coffee filter before use!

Okay - so this was the first time I pickled anything - but pickled beets are my favourite so I decided to give it a go. The recipe is very user friendly - and a lot of fun to make. I will say that "several whole cloves" in each jar is up for a bit of interpretation. I put three whole cloves in each jar and the cloves are very overpowering. I would suggest going with 1 clove in each jar... MAYBE two - but definitely not three.

This was great! I only added 3 cloves to each 16 oz jar, but I had to double the brine to cover the beets. I did some sliced, and I did some quartered, and the quartered beets looked prettier. Wonderful recipe as it is written, thank you!!

Changed the white vinegar to cider vinegar and they will taste much better.  Add 1 TSP mustard seeds as well as 3 slides onions.  Changed to 1 TSP allspice, cloves and a cinnamon stick.    
I've only got ground spices so I put ground allspice, cloves and mustard seeds into the cloth bag and boiled them with the cider vinegar, sugar and onions.

I will agree with another review when I say to please specify the jar size. I used 500ml wide mouth jars and processed for 20 minutes. I would also recommend cooking your really large beets in a separate pot to avoid cutting them. I lost some of the rich colour in boiling them cut. 

That being said; this is a wonderful, simple recipe for canning beets. Since I don't have a pressure canner, I have to pickle them. It's on my to-buy list for sure.

I liked this because it only has 14.1 total carbs. and I can have that.  It was not really sweet and that was even better.  I think the spices were just fine.

Only change I make is adding some sliced onions. This is third year I've used this recipe and beets are delicious! And, they last on shelf at least a year. Just opened a jar from last summer and just as good!

This is a great recipe, except the amount of cloves, I put about 6 cloves per pint jar and it turned out perfect! Just like my Great Aunt made. This is the first time I have made Pickled Beets.

This is a bit different than the recipe my mother gave me and even then, the ingredients were the same, but the proportions differed just a little bit, not enough to make a difference.  What caught my eye though was the important thing the contributor said " just keep repeating the brine until you use up your quantity of vegetable",  this is so important because you ALWAYS want your jar full of brine.......... let no vegetable be uncovered!

I make this every fall.  I think that user laceyw probably boiled the cloves with the vinegar.  Read the recipe, people.  You had a couple of cloves to each jar.  This is a great recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I just put 1-2 cloves in the jar, but the mix of vinegar: sugar worked quite well.  The flavor of the beets was not overwhelmed by the pickling.

These are amazing! I added cinnamon to the brine because my mom always did, and I cut back on the cloves as other reviewers suggested. After putting only two or three cloves in each jar, next time it will be only one.  So glad I found this recipe even though I tweaked it a bit. A keeper for next years crop.

This is my first time making it it kinda is a little confusing with the clove I just put two cloves in the canning jar. It said to use several really means  2 or 3 I will get back to you leader.

Instead of boiling beats I roasted then peeled, sliced and followed remainder of recipe. Pickled beats have a firmer texture plus all nutrients are retained.

Replaced the 2 c sugar with 1.5 c honey.

Peel beets before boiling them, put them in jars while hot to save time.

Put 2 - 3 cloves in each jar.  Could use a little more clove flavor, next time I will go for 3 - 4 cloves per jar.

Loved the flavor.

Made some last week, cracked one open this morning to try! Great simple recipe, and I had no issues with the processing time, everything sealed perfectly, and as it's all hot and sterilized it should be perfect! This will be my go-to for kitchen gifts from now on :)

I tried this recipe for the first time last fall after receiving a bunch of beets from my uncle's garden.  I was really nervous, since I'd never done any canning before, but it seemed easy enough.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to add one whole clove per jar.  I was thrilled when the result was a pickled beet that tasted just like my mom's!  And despite just one per jar, the clove is very noticeable, but not overpowering.  I planted beets myself this year and am canning my third batch.  This recipe is a keeper!

Everyone who receives these beets raves about how good they are. My sister and I have spent several afternoons together happily putting up beets to this recipe. I sometimes add a peeled hard-boiled egg in the jar, yummy!
The brine is simple to make and adapts readily to other fruits (watermelon rind) and veggies (carrots).

Second year making this and we love them. I cut the sugar in half though.

This recipe is almost identical to mine except that I add 2 cups of strained beat juice to the brine. I also use THREE DROPS of clove oil to the brine instead of cloves.  Love these beets.

I tried this recipe recently and left the cloves out entirely.  My family prefers pickled beets without spice of any kind.  The recipe is definitely a keeper.

I agree with folks who suggest decreasing the cloves.  I put just 2 each in quart jars.  We love it!
