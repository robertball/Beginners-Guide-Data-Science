Very tasty. I actually used used dried basil instead of fresh, so I used about half what the recipe called for. I also used coarse sea salt, and a little more than it called for since my husband likes the extra kick.

I didn't have any salad dressing, but it still tasted great even without that major ingredient. Wonderful on Ritz crackers.
