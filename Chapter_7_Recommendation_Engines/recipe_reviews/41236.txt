Made the first time to recipe and they were pretty good. But with adjustments they were fantastic!
I wanted a truffle that had the really "melt in your mouth" center with the harder chocolate thick coating.

I used 1 package of cream cheese, 2 cups  of milk chocolate chips, 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 1/2 tsp almond extract. prepared as directed, but after rolling into balls, I put in the fridge for 1/2 hour to harden a bit more. I then melted 3 large squares of "almond bark" chocolate (dipping chocolate found in the chocolate chip part of the grocery store) and 3 large squares of "almond bark" vanilla. I melted them for 60 seconds in the microwave, stirred, 20 seconds more. Then dipped the balls in with a fork so chocolate could drip off and placed on wax paper to cool. 
These held up in tupperware for days. Everyone loved them.

These turned out amazing! I made two batches total. My first batch was devoted to a raspberry truffle. I used 1 ½ teaspoons of raspberry extract instead of vanilla. For the other batch I made it just as the recipe said. I scooped the truffles with a melon ball scoop to make them uniform but still rolled by hand. After I rolled the truffles I put them on a cookie sheet on wax paper and put them in the freezer. While they were in the freezer I melted milk chocolate. I took out about a dozen truffles at a time and I dipped them. I put them on wax paper laid on my counter to set and continued to dip the remainder. I let them all set and my taste tester, my husband, told me that I needed to dip them again to get the nice thick coat of chocolate like Harry and Davids. I dipped them again after they had set the first time. For the raspberry ones I melted red dipping chocolate and drizzled over the top to distinguish them from the others. I was bringing them to a party so on some of the other chocolate ones for the kids I put on sprinkles and crushed candy canes while the chocolate was still a little tacky. The only problem I found was the candy cane toped ones didn’t store longer than a couple of days. The rest of the chocolate ones I drizzled some with white chocolate and some with dark chocolate. Next year I am going to take half of the chocolate batch and when I roll the truffle put a hazelnut in the middle. Thanks Jenny for the recipe it will be a new Christmas tradition!

With a few changes, some recommended by others, these live up to their name of being easy and decadent.  I reduced the confectioner's sugar and chocolate chips to 2 cups each, added 2 oz. of Baker's Reserve 225th Aniv. 70& Cocoa Dark Bittersweet chocolate and 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.  I got 62 truffles. I used the large size of a melon baller as I was putting the finished truffle into paper bon-bon cups.  My biggest recommendation is shaping.  Even the melon baller would not work if the mixture was out of the refrigerator more than 10 minutes.  So I drop dollops of mixture on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, refrigerated for another 30 minutes and then rolled into balls.  This produced a nicely shaped truffle.  I refrigerated again for another 10 mintues before rolling in selected coatings. I processed the nuts into a  meal using a food processor, doing the same for the coconut.  Both looked awesome as did the cocoa powder coating.  I also dipped some into melted Baker's White Chocolate and Baker's German Sweet chocolate.  I used Ghiradelli chcolate chips.  All these top of the line ingredients produced a creamy, yummy truffle that were gobbled down by the recipients. Once shaped and coated, they do not need to be refriegerated to hold shape.  A keeper recipe

These truffles are amazing!  I made a million of these for my Christmas party at work and here are some of the combinations I came up with: almond extract and roll in crushed almonds, peppermint extract and roll in crushed candycanes, rum extract and roll in toffee bits, hide a white chocolate chip in the middle and drizzle with melted white chocolate, hide a peanut butter chip in the middle and drizzle with melted peanut butter chips, add 1 tsp instant coffee granules and roll in cappucino powder.

Absolutely divine!  I read some other reviews and found that some had trouble rolling.  I, by accident, found a combination of chocolate that makes it easier to roll and, less time to sit in the fridge:  Keep the powdered sugar and cream cheese and vanilla the same but for the chocolate, melt 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips and 6 oz brick form dipping chocolate.  The dipping chocolate is much more firm than chocolate chips and it hardens quicker.  Just adding those 6 oz allows for the mixture to be ready to roll after only 20 minutes in the fridge.  The chocolate is sticky enough to hold crushed nuts or whatever you like to roll it in.  Thank you for a very easy and delicious recipe!

One word - EASY! I made 2 batches of these during the holidays. The first I followed to the letter and they were insanely easy to make. However, I found them too sweet and a little too hard as opposed to melt-in-your-mouth tender. The 2nd batch, I only used 2c of icing sugar and 2c of choco chips. I added 2 oz of bittersweet chocolate and 2 TBS of 15% cream (heavier cream is good too). This kept it sweet enough but more chocolatey. It was still easy to handle and form ie. was not runny, into a perfect little truffle ball but once you pop it into your mouth, it just melts and you wonder what you did to deserve this. I also divided the recipe in 2 and used 2-3TBS of brandy to one half and 2-3TBS of rum to the other. You only feel/taste the alcohol if you have stored it at least overnight.

Great recipe. I'm only giving it 4 out  of 5 because I had so much trouble keeping it from melting in my hands while rolling despite the length of time I refrigerated. Granted, I've never rolled truffles before so this could be totally normal. They were just a little difficult to work with. BUT DEFINITELY WORTH IT! They are yummy! I added mint oil to the truffle mix and then dipped in green melting chocolate (with more mint oil added) and sprinkled with crushed candy canes. They are gorgeous and delicious! The flavor rivals Andes after dinner mints and my husband who was sick of eating all the chocolate I made at Christmas this year actually felt refreshed after putting this final piece of candy in his mouth. I'll be adding these truffles to my holiday gift bags for years to come. I also made a 2nd batch with peanut butter. They rolled a lot easier for some reason. After rolling, I dipped them in dark chocolate. Creamy inside with the shell outside. Delicious!

So delicious yet so easy. I brought this to a party and everybody was impressed! I did a variety of flavors and coatings. I divvied them into three batches and added 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 Tbsp. coffee liqeuor or 1 Tbsp. peanut butter (yep, gotta have PB). Than I rolled them in cocoa powder, confectioner's sugar, chopped hazelnuts or pistachio. And (yes, there's more), I also melted some semisweet chocolate chips and dipped some uncoated truffles before letting the chocolate coating solidify in the fridge. Simply, this recipe is very versatile and you can adjust it according to your whims ;) P.S. Although the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar (wow!), I only used 1.5 cups and it turned out perfect: not too sweet, but sweet enough!

These came out wonderfully! only used 2 cups of powdered sugar. I also added in 1/2 cup cream.  In half of it, I used raspberry extract and ended up tripling it to get it the right taste.  I rolled them in cocoa.  The other half I put in 2 tsp of instant coffee and rolled in some mocha mix.  I believe we have a winner!

UPDATED review:
After letting these truffles sit for awhile, they changed to a better consistency (started out as goo).  The outside hardened up a bit (very nice!) but the inside was still creamy and not too hard.  I took these to my family Christmas party and everyone loved them.  I think everyone asked for this recipe!  They are really, really rich, so you don't need a ton of them to satisfy your sweet-tooth. 

Old review read: 
You could eat these with a spoon.  I reduced the sugar and the chips to 2 cups each, as suggested by other reviewers.  I divided the batch in half and I mixed in some toffee bits and vanilla in one batch (rolled them in the toffee bits) and I mixed almond extract with the second half and "rolled" them in candied almonds I ground to a powder.  The batch with toffee and vanilla didn't taste good at all... I had a hard time coating them, didn't work to "roll" them... I had to smash the topping into them.  Then I tried to dip one of the "truffles" in melted chocolate, and it all just turned to goo  Maybe it would work better with more sugar and choclate chips as the recipe suggested?  By the way, I used milk chocolate chips.  They were very creamy, but my husband likened the "truffles" to pudding... I will not use this recipe again.  Sorry to give such a bad review :(

Wow... SO easy and SO decadent. I made around 18 dozen of them... all different kinds. Each batch (1 brick cream cheese, 2 cups icing sugar, 2 cups *dry measure* melted chocolate chips) yeilded almost 4 dozen 1 1/2 tsp-sized balls. I flavored them with coconut, orange, peppermint, and almond extracts, one batch I used 2 tsp instant coffee, and I rolled them in vanilla sugar, coconut, crushed candycanes, icing sugar, crushed almonds, and sliced almonds... some I dipped in melted chocolate chips and topped with candied fruit, I got some really neat teeny tiny cups from the dollar store, and some metal tins as well. Each tin held 12-16 truffles, so they were perfect! This recipe is gluten free, so it was great to make for my mother-in law, I made a batch with white chocolate for my husband (can't have caffeine) it was perfect for everyone! The coffee ones rolled in vanilla sugar were the biggest hit. I will DEFINATELY be making these again. Here are some tips.

1) Make sure your mix is COLD before you try to roll it. I found mine needed to be in the fridge overnight if I didn't want to keep sticking it in the fridge every 12 balls.

2) Use a melon-baller or round metal measuring spoon (1tsp) to make the balls uniform

3) FREEZE the balls you want to dip in melted chocolate and use a toothpick to dip them, then twist the toothpick out when you put them on parchment paper.

4) Use a tiny bit of shortening (1/2 tsp per 2 cups) in your melted chocolate chips to avoid a "hazy" chocol

If you follow the reviews and reduce the sugar and/or chocolate to 2 cups, plan to dip them in melted chocolate when they're done so that it hardens around them--reducing the sugar & chocolate makes them too soft to roll in crumbly toppings. Refrigerate 20 minutes before rolling into balls, and roll 1/3 batch at a time. For truffles NOT dipped in additional chocolate, set up on counter as follows: chilled "batter," plate of crumbly topping, wax paper lined container. Roll ball, roll in topping, put in container, repeat. Put in fridge. For those dipped in chocolate, roll chilled batter into balls, freeze 1 hr, melt chocolate. Set up melted chocolate, plate of topping, then wax paper lined container. Do a dozen at a time: use one hand or spoon to dip frozen balls in chocolate and put in container, use clean hand to sprinkle topping on. Sprinkle topping on balls individually right after each is dipped so that it will stick before the choc hardens. You'll get the hang of it. I divided batches into 3rds and made these flavors: (1) 1 tsp instant coffee granules dissolved w/ 1 tablespoon boiling water. Dipped in choc, topped w/ crushed hard caramel candy.  (2) 1 1/2 T baileys, dipped in melted mint chocolate  (3) Vanilla extract, dipped in choc and topped with sprinkles.(4) 1 1/2 T frangelico (hazelnut liquor), rolled in ground graham cracker. (5) 1 T peanut butter, rolled in crushed Oreo. (6) 1 1/2 T coconut rum, rolled in toasted coconut.

Depending on the chocolate type, the consistency changes.

Dark - Thick, and if left to cool overnight will be crumbly until rewarmed
Milk - Runny (Many people complain about this), cooling over night will get the consistency right, long enough to dip in tempered chocolate
White - Tacky. Chilled over night makes it very nice to work with, still melts onto your hands but not as bad as milk chocolate.

For those of you adding flavoring, do not use any that contain propylene glycol. It will polymerize your chocolate and it will not be usable. (I lost my milk chocolate batch to this and had to remake it).  Use only alcohol based flavorings. You can add those to either the chocolate before you add it to the cream cheese, or the cream cheese. (I prefer the chocolate, so you can taste it). I also used 2 teaspoons of flavoring instead of 1.5, because I was expecting a chocolate coating that was not flavored.

Also for dipping in chocolate, remember to let the centers warm, the mixture expands as it warms. The coating will harden, then as the center expands, the shell will "pop", usually on the bottom, which isn't a problem, but sometimes it will force it's way out on the side, or crack the whole shell.

These are extremely easy to make, but that’s about the only good thing I can say. They are WAAAAY to sweet for most adults. That’s coming from someone with a huge sweet tooth! Even on the kid test only half of them liked these truffles. They melt in the hand, never mind making it to your mouth. If you do decide you have to try these dip them in some other type of chocolate for a candy coating.  Plus it’s a huge recipe, I ended up throwing away half of them. Oh yeah, by the time you’ve made them and dipped them AND decorated all the truffles half your day is gone. Definitely not worth it.

These were insanely delicious!  I took these to my son's hockey tournament this afternoon as a THanksgiving treat for the parents.  They all loved them and could not believe that they were homemade!  I divided the recipe in thirds before adding the extract.  I made one batch with mint extract, one batch with vanilla and one batch with bailieys.  I also dipped each batch in melted chocolate.  Some in white some in semi sweet and some in milk.  Splurge and use good quality chocolate in the recipe it's worth it for the extra dollar or two it will cost.  To dip the balls in melted chocolate I inserted a tootpick just slightly into each ball before dipping.  This made for a smooth finish and if gentle, produced a perfect truffle!  I also suggest adding a tsp. of shortening to the melted chocolate.  It makes the chocolate "shine" after they cool.  This recipe is fussy but well worth the end result!!!!!!

I made these last night.  followed the recipe as written for the most part.  after rolling I dipped in almond bark in order to have the hard outer shell like a Lindt.  I divided the batch into 3- used vanilla in one, orange liquer in 2nd and peppermint extract in 3rd.  would use more of the flavoring next time (used 1 tsp of peppermint and almost 2 tsp. of the orange) neither of those were very minty or orangy. It was messy to roll but no more than I expected. The truffle mix was in fridge about an hour and I did put them back a couple times as it warmed up.  I froze them after rolling for an hour or so before dipping.  My husband who's highest accolade to me with anything I cook or bake is "it's good"  asked me if I could make them by the carload as they were the most awesome thing he had ever had.  High praise indeed from him!!

I did the 2 cups each of choc. chips and sugar, and 2 ounces of dark chocolate as others recommended. I divided the mixture into 2 and used 3 1/2 tablespoons of  Kahlua and Maraschino cherry liquor in each.  You can't really taste the liquor, but I got glowing reports, which included me quitting my job to be a chocolatier...great recipe! I recommend rolling the final product in shavings of good chocolate (real milk/white chocolate) rather than the candied sprinkles, this makes a HUGE difference in the taste of the truffles.  The white chocolate shavings were especially pretty in contrast with the colour of the truffle.

I have been making these at Christmas time for the past 3 years.  In the coming weekend I will be making them again for this year.
This is the easiest recipe for Truffles.  They are so delicious.
I had to triple the batch last year, and will again this year.
I divide the mix and add make several flavours: mint, Bailey's, Coffee (using very finely ground coffee beans), orange, plain, cherry, amaretto, and whatever else I can think of.
After rolling I dip each one into dipping chocolate to get a nice coating on the outside and decorate each flavour differently.
These are a huge hit and people don't usually believe that they were homemade.
Simply wonderful.

I made loads of these as Christmas presents for family and friends. They are easy, delicious and very versatile. The possibilities are endless (sub any flavor chip and extract that you want)! Whatever flavor i'm going to use i always use 2c sugar and 2c chips. I use a melon baler and stick them in the freezer once they are rolled. Once they are nice and cold i double dip them in candy coating to get a hard chocolate shell. SOOOO good. Some of our favorite combination's have been
-peanut butter chips, vanilla extract dipped in semisweet chocolate
-White chocolate chips with Raspberry extract dipped in white chocolate and drizzled with milk chocolate
-Dark chocolate chips with orange extract dipped in dark chocolate drizzled with white chocolate.
-Cherry flavored chips with 1/2 almond and cherry extract dipped in semi or dark chocolate.
-Butterscotch chips with rum extract dipped in white chocolate and rolled in finely crushed toffee bits. 

My fav is white chocolate raspberry and the hubby loves the dark chocolate orange ones! Everyone thought they were professionally made! Thanks a million!

I just finished making these and they turned out great!  I used 2c each of the chocolate chips and powdered sugar with almond extract in place of vanilla.  I read in the other reviews that people had a hard time rolling them out.  Instead of rolling them out by hand, I used 2 spoons to make the basic shape of them, and finished rolling them in cocoa powder, nuts, or powdered sugar.  This made it alot easier for me.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'm sure these will be a big hit for my work party!

My mates couldn’t believe I made these, they kept on asking “How?”. It also took me less than 40 mins. I wrapped the mixture in clingfilm, flattened it and placed in the freezer for about 10 minutes, then it was very easy to cut it into roughly equally sized pieces and roll, I then returned the truffles to freezer for 5 mins and coated them in almonds (very good crunchy contrast), coconut, icing sugar and cocoa. I also took smbs advice and used only 2C chocolate and icing sugar each + ab 50g good 75% chocolate and 2Tbsp cream. Very good!

This went into my Christmas collection.  Great recipe and terrific results.  I made several variations including orange (with zest) rolled in cocoa powder, white chocolate peppermint rolled in crushed candy canes, white chocolate Peanut butter and banana chip rolled in crushed peanuts and banana chips and Dark chocolate mint rolled in crushed mint candies.  I just couldn't stop coming up with combinations.  The tangy and smooth cream cheese is what really sets these apart from other truffle recipes.

A versatile recipe that's easy to modify. You can substitute vanilla for other extracts/liqeurs and vary the outer coating to match the flavor. These truffles are easy to make and the mixture holds up well so long as you keep it covered in the refrigerator until you're ready to make the balls. I used a small cookie dough scoop to keep the size consistent. I rolled them in nuts, coconut, cocoa powder, mint cocoa milk powder (from Trader Joe's in the coffee/tea/cocoa section), and of course, I dipped them in cocolate.

This recipe was very impressive. I separated and mixed with different liqueors, just a little to have a variety of flavors. I tried Grand Marnier and blackberry brandy. Then rolled some in melted chocolate some in cocoa, chopped nuts, coconut and sprinkles. It is an easy recipe to experiment with and they came out great. Will definately make again.

I made these with Amaretto coated with ground almonds, Grand Marnier dusted with powdered sugar, Frangelico coated with chocolate non-pariels, and Chambord dusted with Ghiradelli Cocoa.  They were all delicious and looked beautiful!

I've been playing with truffle recipes and found that this one is very different...but most flexible!!  It's almost perfect!  I've made them with Amaretto, Frangelica, Kahlua and even White Chips and dried apricots with an apricot Fondant dipping!!  Thank you Jenny for a whole new world.

Tried a very small test batch of these last night and they turned out surprisingly good. I followed the recipe proportions exactly but used white chocolate chips and fat free cream cheese, as that was what I already had, and I did not want to invest a lot into ingredients before giving it a trial run. The "batter" was pretty stiff as I was mixing it up, and after chilling for an hour was the perfect consistency for rolling into balls. I think the issues with them being too gooey, as some reviewers stated, is from not using enough powdered sugar. The amount seems like a lot, but is necessary to get the proper consistency. They ARE extremely sweet, but I think that's great. You can eat one or maybe two, and it kills your sugar craving. I experimented with rolling them in a couple of different things that I had: crushed nuts, colored sugars, and hot chocolate mix (suggested by another reviewer - turned out AWESOME.) I am planning to buy peanut butter chips and Andes peppermint chips in addition to chocolate to make different flavors to give away. These looked beautiful even with the random coatings I used on them.

LOVE this recipe.  I omitted the vanilla and divided the "dough" in half.  One I flavored with raspberry extract and rolled some in chocolate sprinkles and some in powdered sugar.  The other half I flavored with peppermint extract and rolled in peppermint sugar crystals.  Both I started out with 1 tsp of the extract but ended up adding more to taste because I wanted a stronger flavor.  Both kept very well in the fridge for over 3 weeks.  I would advise rolling them all out within the first few days because I saved some in a bag to roll out later and it got crumbly.  This is soo easy and kid friendly.

Tasty even without any vanilla!(Although will make with vanilla next time if dont use liqueur) Made these for brother's 21st birthday. Really wasn't sure about using 1 Tablespoon of liqueur for each third of the batch, But I think now, that was probably right. I tried 1-2 teaspoons, and while the truffles were delicious all on their own, I couldn't really taste any of the flavors. Once we determined that we couldn't taste the flavor I rolled some in cinnamon, some in finely chopped almonds, and drizzled some with melted butterscotch to make them unique. Also, I froze them for about 2-3 hrs which was way to long. I had to let the chocolate soften in my hands before it could be rolled into a smooth ball. 1 hour or even less would probably be about right. You are looking for the mixture to feel semi hard to the touch but not rock hard.  Tips for rolling: -cold hands work best -don't try on roll with one hand on a cutting board or parchment paper. Roll between two hands and be patient. You want it to be smooth. -If you find that your truffle has cracks, just keep rolling it. It will soften up and smooth out  Storing advice: -These store well for a good while in airtight tubberware but after about a week, begins to taste more like a ball of cream cheese than a ball of chocolate -If you store on a counter to keep them semi soft, keep them in a cool place so they don't spoil -If you store in the fridge, but don't like how hard they get, let them thaw in an OPEN container on counter.

This was the second time I've made these truffles, and this time I had fun with the fillings-
Irishcream, Kahlua, Buttercream, Almond, and Coffee. I covered each type in a different coating, Milk and white chocolate shavings, cocoa powder, icing sugar, finely chopped almonds and melted milk chocolate for a varied look and taste.
I found the candy boxes and cups at a local bulk store, it was a great look for a great tasting Christmas treat. I'm already on the lookout for just the right giftbox for next year.

Excellent! These really are insanely easy. I did several types: coconut extract then rolled in coconut, raspberry extract then dipped in chocolate and drizzled with red tinted chocolate, vanilla extract then rolled in either ground walnuts, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, or colored non-pariels. I used 2 cups semisweet chips, 2 squares of chocolate almond bark, and 2 cups of powdered sugar. Delightfully sweet, but not overpowering. I will make these again and again. They really didn't take any time at all and are well worth the ingredients. Thanks!!!

These are wonderful, and versatile as you can change/add ingredients to taste. However, one caveat for those who leave them out at room temp for days: They DO contain cream cheese, which is very perishable, and should be kept refrigerated. Just take out the amount needed to serve about a half hour before serving, leaving the remainder refrigerated. Don't take chances by leaving them at room temp for days on end. Of course, they will go quickly if you have many guests, but do be careful. You don't want to give your guests food poisoning.

I was so surprised at how well this recipe turned out! When I saw how simple it was, I didn't think the results would be so great, everyone was so impressed! I scaled the recipe to 20 but still got a couple more out of it. A suggestion, if rolling them into balls is too frustrating, I rolled it into a log and flattened the sides and cut it into rectangles/squares. If you are rolling them in sugar or nuts, I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate, but you should shape and then chill them before dipping them in chocolate. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed this recipe ALMOST to a tee. The only thing I did, at the suggestion of many other reviewers, was cut out one cup of powdered sugar. I'm glad I did, otherwise I do think it would have been too sweet. Other than that, these turned out creamy, rich, and delicious! I did read some reviews that said the mixture got sticky and hard to make into a ball after a while, so I stirred in about 2 tbsp. of shortening to the mixture before I refrigerated it and that did the trick! My truffle mixture never got sticky while making the balls. This is definitely a keeper recipe that I can't wait to try playing around with again :)

These are amazing.  I made them for a party and everybody loved them.  I used good quality chocolate.  I did the recipe as written but did divide in 3 and used 3 types of extract:
rum 3/4 t, peppermint 1 tsp, vanilla 3/4 t then put them in 3 bowls in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  Then I brought them out, rolled em and put them back in the fridge in a covered container.  The next day, I dipped and rolled them.  They were gorgeous and delicious!  I dipped in powdered sugar, chocolate, mint chocolate, white chocolate (the best) and melted toblerone (had some to use).  Kept cool until served.  used small cupcake papers and they looked wonderful and professional!

I made these as written. I have one tip, More confectioners' sugar means firmer truffles. After I measured out each cup I tapped it on the counter top and added more. (the sugar drops down a lot when tapped) If your truffles are too soft you did not add enough powdered sugar!

These are amazing!  I've been making truffles as part of my holiday goodies for over six years, using Martha Stewart's recipe.  While they are excellent, they are also VERY time consuming!  Now, with soon to be three children ages four and under I really needed something quick that I could do start to finish at nap time - and this recipe was it!  I honestly can't even taste the difference between these and Martha's and neither could my husband!  And they were ready in a quarter of the time!  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe and plan to use it every year from this point on!

This title of this recipe really says it all!  I made these today for a Super Bowl party tomorrow.  They taste and look awesome.  I did cut back the confectioner's sugar to 2 cups like other reviews said.  I used a package of Baker's Semi-Sweet Chocolate that I had on hand and added about half a cup more of chocolate chips.  I think this recipe is pretty forgiving which is great for me because I don't tend to measure things!  

Your cream cheese definitely needs to be very soft.  I started with it still pretty cold and it didn't mix up well.  I stuck it in the microwave for about 15 seconds at half power and it was perfect.  I pulled out about a third of the recipe and added about two tablespoons of peanut butter for variety.  I think the peanut version is a little creamier and smoother.  

I, along with my three year old daughter, rolled the balls in a variety of toppings including finely crushed graham crackers, red decorating sugar, cocoa powder, hot chocolate mix, and chocolate sprinkles.  We laid them on wax paper lined cookie sheets when we were done and ultimately put them in the fridge in a sealed container in layers on the wax paper.  Rolling them was a little messy, but they weren't too bad to deal with.  We ended up with about 70 in all, including the ones we nibbled along the way!

only 4 stars because they were too rich!!! (as mentioned before)  I only let them chill for 30 mins before shaping them.  While i was shaping them however i rolled a couple into balls and they looked extremly unappeitizing so instead i took a cookie scooper and just scopped them on wax paper.  The cookie scooper made them perfect size and shape! (flat on the bottem and rounded at the top)  im making another batch to give away as gifts

This is a 10* recipe. My first time making truffles, they are gorgeous. I split the recipe in 4 bowls,  1 bowl with orange flavouring,1 with coffee flavour, one with almond, and then left one plain. I only left them in the fridge about 15-20 mins any longer I think they would have been too hard. I then rolled some of them in chopped nuts, some in cocoa/icing sugar combo, and melted chocolate and flaked chocolate. Hub took some to work, THEY LOVED THEM....(but again cops eat anything lol)
This recipe is defintely something I will use year round not just christmas

These are excellent!  We have made these as our new traditional Christmas gifts to our neighbors.  We used Ande's mint chips in some recipes (along with milk chocolate chips) and they made a wonderful minty flavored truffle.

I expect truffles to have a soft center and a hard coating. These were not like that. They were good, but more like fudge. Also, after chilling one hour it was hard as a rock! Not sure I would do again. I will try a traditional truffle recipe next time. Thanks anyway.

I divided the mixture of cream cheese and chocolate chips, into three dishes. I added vanilla to one, mint to one, and almond extract to the last. Then I rolled them in different coatings, as suggested. Coconut on the almond was my husbands favorite. I love chopped nuts on the almond and vanilla. Did the mint flavored just in confectioners sugar. All were good. Will make again!!

If you dip the finished truffles in dark chocolate candy melt and you use semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips in the recipe, you'll have the best truffles you've ever had!  I topped the dipped truffles with chunky gold sprinkles and they looked like a million dollars!

I just made these last night, and they turned out really well! I was a bit hesitant because I'm not much of a baker, but they were easy enough! I followed the recipe but changed it to 2 cups of confectioners' sugar and 2 cups of chocolate chips. I found that after putting them in the fridge for an hour, only the mixture in the top half of the bowl hardened enough to roll into balls, so I ended up rolling whatever I could and put the rest in the fridge for another half hour. I rolled the balls in grounded up walnuts, rainbow sprinkles, coconut, and rolled some balls to drizzle melted white chocolate over them. They all turned out good. I'm glad that I rolled them into small balls because these are VERY rich in flavor. I made them for my mom to take to her work party, and she was really excited because they look really elegant. I also put them in miniature tin foil cups. Seriously, make these. I am generally not good at baking and ended up pulling these off very well! :-)

Very tasty (4 stars), extremely easy to make, and beautiful (5 stars) when dipped in chocolate or "almond bark" coating.  I was able to start shaping the truffles right away, without requiring them to be refrigerated first. I measured a level teaspoon for each truffle, yielding 120 truffles. Once shaped, I refrigerated them for one hour before dipping them in almond bark chocolate flavored and vanilla flavored coatings. They turned out beautiful! (See photos posted by members.) ***FLAVOR IDEAS in place of vanilla *** ROSE: use white chocolate chips instead of semisweet chocolate, add rose water extract/essence, dip in vanilla almond bark, decorate with small piece of rose leaf. ORANGE: flavor the truffle filling and the almond bark coating with orange extract, insert small candied orange peel in center of each truffle, then drizzle the dipped truffle with orange colored almond bark.

Yum Yum Yum! I wanted to make mint truffles, and cheated :P  Instead of using mint flavorings, I bought the mint and chocolate chip baking bits, and used that in place of the amount of chocolate chips.  Turned out perfect!  Super quick and easy, super yummy!!

This is more of a cake frosting than a truffle.  They came out much too sweet, and I usually like sweet things.  The cream cheese seems like a good idea, but what you you end up with is a ball of chocolate flavored cream cheese frosting.  I could barely taste the chocolate over the sugar.  Disgusting.  Will not make again.

I tried out a number of truffle recipes to use as favors for my sister's wedding, and this was the best by far.  They held their shape well and didn't melt at room temperature, like the other recipes I sampled.  We decided on two flavors, dark chocolate cappuccino and raspberry lemon.  They were a hit with her wedding guests!

Time consuming, messy, but very easy. And the taste is wonderful! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers, and decreased both the sugar and chocolate chips to 2 cups each. I also added 2 TBS of heavy cream. I used ghiradelli chocolate chips. I made white chocolate raspberry (1 1/2 tsp of raspberry extract) rolled in crushed walnuts, milk chocoloate (made with 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi sweet chips) dipped in chocolate (bakers melted squares) drizzled with white chocolate, and dark chocolate/mocha (2 tsp of coffee) rolled in a cocoa/hot cocoa mix.  Everyone was very impressed! I made these a couple of months ago, and the compliments are still flowing!

I just made these tonight and they are sooo yummy!  I did follow the suggestions of the others and used 2 cups of sugar and chocolate.  It needed to be chilled longer than an hour so it was easier to handle.  My son who is 8 had a blast helping me roll them in sprinkles and nuts, so I would definitely recommend making them with your kids! They are so pretty, Im considering making more to give away as Christmas gifts.

I found this recipe to be incredibly easy and delicious.  I did not chill before rolling, instead I rolled them into balls at room temperature.  To save time with coating, I put icing sugar in a ziploc bag and did a dozen or more at one time.

Ok if I could give this more stars I would. It was so easy and awesome! I melted the chocalote chips in the microwave to make super easy. I made half rolled in powered sugar and half in cocoa powder. The day I made them the ones in powdered sugar tasted better, but they did not look better. The cocoa ones tasted better the next day and looked prettier. I can't wait to make again and experiment. Make sure you do not make too big becuase they are rich. I was even thinking about dipping some in white almond bark. Thank you so much Jenny for the recipe, love it!!

Tried this out today. Definitely cut down the sugar and chocolate like everyone else says. They're still rich even when you do. I like the end result. Notes: White chocolate is easier to work with than milk and semi-sweet. Also, dipping these can be rough, because they start melting quickly. I found it better to just drizzle them instead. It's a good recipe.

Made these plain, PB, strawberry+cardamom, key lime (rolled in graham crumbles), and salted.  Impressed even my catering friends (and I'm in the industry!) so that's a LOT of people!  Had a foodie friend make snootier ones and my husband and I threw them out they just didn't compare!  Really forgiving, flexible and easy to experiment with, great base recipe from which to launch your truffle empire!!  These kept, sealed in the fridge, for WEEKS (like 8-12!).

Easy, rich and delicious.  The problem is, they really dont taste like truffles, they taste like fudge.  They are a great chocolate fix though. My family loved them, but I was hoping for truffles.  Save yourself alot of work..spread them in a pan and cut into squares.

These were outstanding!  They were very messy to make, but the end product was delicious.  I rolled half in cocoa powder and half in crushed walnuts and put each in an individual mini cupcake cup.  They were a HUGE hit!  One of the girls told me I should make them and sell them for Christmas!

the recipe is wayyy to sweet that the sweetness covers any aroma and flavor of the chocolate.  the cream cheese also makes it too rich.  i prefer the simple heavy cream with melted chocolate truffle recipe.
EDIT: actually to be brutally honest, this recipe was the worst i tried on this site.

Awesome!  I made these truffles for a drinks and desserts party and they were a total hit.  They take a while to make but are worth every minute.  I followed the suggestions from several reviews and reduced the chocolate and powdered sugar to both two cups.  Instead of just using semisweet chips I used 1 cup of the semisweet chips and 1 cup 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar.  This also helped control the sweetness.  I also divided the batch into four groups and only kept the group that I was working with out of the freezer.

Did a test run on these prior to making them on a upcoming wedding dessert bar.  Everyone loved them.  I dipped half in white and half in choc coating (wilton brand) and drizzed a design on top.  Made exactly as written and they were melt in your mouth in the middle.  I would recommend using quality chocolate chips.  They seem to provide much better taste and texture.

I made these today & OMG, these came out AMAZING! I didn't cut the recipe's ingredients for the amount of sugar, I used the EXACT amount for everything & I believe that using the sifted conf. sugar slowly was key... after that was done, I slowly added my chocolate (melted semi-sweet & milk chocolate combo in a double boiler)... again, this was done slowly. INSTEAD of the VANILLA, I replaced it with "real" Bailey's Irish Cream & OMG...yum! I took the mixture & placed it in the fridge overnight. The next day I used my hands & rolled the balls but used different toppings, coated them with chocolate jimmies, white/red jimmies (V-Day), Confec. Sugar & my personal favorite...COCONUT! After rolling them all, placed them on a platter & in the fridge they went. Tasted them an hour later & again, PERFECT! This was an easy recipe, but it took a lot of little steps, patience & was messy, but it was a ton of fun. I can't wait for my husband to taste them tomorrow on V-Day (the reason I wanted to make them). I would make them again & plan on doing it in the near future.

These came out amazing!! i followed the altered recipe, using only 2 cups powered suger and 2 cups chocolate chips, i also found that although you can work with mixture after 1 hr its easyier to work with if refigerated over night, i rolled mine in powdered suger, cocoa powder, cononut, and crushed walnuts, im looking forward to experimenting with other flavorings :) definitly a keeper!!

This was a great recipe. I'd never made truffles before, and was leery of them being complicated and not turning out right. But I made them pretty much exactly as written (I was a little sloppy with the melting and mixing steps). I let the mixture sit in the fridge for 90 minutes instead of 60, since I thought it was too soft for rolling after only an hour. I decorated the truffles 3 ways: with finely chopped almonds, with unsweetened cocoa powder, and with confectioner's sugar. Plus I got to use those little paper cups for the first time ever. I took these to a meeting, and got rave reviews from maybe 6 people - they were a hit. I must say that these are a little different from the usual truffle. I usually think of milk chocolate truffles. With these, the semi-sweet chocolate flavor was a little bit surprising - very tasty, of course, but it caught me off guard. And of course the cream cheese is kind of a surprising ingredient. It all makes for mighty tasty truffles. I highly recommend this recipe and just might make them again soon.

These turned out amazing!  I made them recently for a wedding and had soooo many compliments! I made a few different flavours, I did amaretto and dipped them in dk chocolate and drizzled in milk chocolate, mint dipped in green chocolate and drizzled with dark chocolate, rum dipped in milk chocolate and rolled in skor chips, and I also did one with vanilla and then put a few chocolate vanilla swirl chippits in the middle and then dipped in white chocolate (takes 2 coats of the white to cover nicely) and then drizzled in dark. I made the recipe with the chocolate chips but dipped them with the different chocolate wafers. Super easy recipe but the rolling is very tedious! Will make these again for sure!

Awesome.  The name says it all...so easy to make, so rich!  And so many possibilities!  Besides experimenting with different liquors or extracts for the "inside" flavor, you can use so many different things for the covering! We rolled them in crushed pecans, cocoa, powdered sugar, and much more.  Plus they're so simple I could let my kids help!  It was so fun and wonderful! People love these!

This is the first time I'm writing a review so do pardon my kitchen lingo.

I was quite excited to try this recipe because it looked so incredibly easy and the raves it got? Needless to say I was reading well past the 5th page of reviews and followed the instructions of using only 2 cups of sugar & chocolate chips. 

Turned out quite blissful indeed! Since different people had different outcomes with the consistency of the mixture after popping it into the fridge for an hour, methinks it's the quality &/or consistency of your cream cheese & chocolate. My cream cheese was REALLY soft but the chocolate was semi-hard (microwaved the chips) and it became this gooey, soft, custard-like thing.

An hour in the fridge didn't do it any good because it melted right into my hands after a few rolls. Tried it after though, and it was absolutely lovely! The remaining batch is still hardening in my fridge and I'll continue doing it tomorrow.

For those looking for alternatives - try lychee extract! Half a teaspoon of it into half the batch should do the trick. It smells and tastes amazing.

Rolled the vanilla batch in cocoa powder (looked real professional, like those you'd find at Godiva ;D) and hid a hazelnut in them.

I'm rolling the the lychee batch in caster sugar, but it gets really splotchy after awhile. Gotta smooth out the texture a bit.

I suppose different people will have different outcomes but it's so easy, it's def worth a try. Have fun & good luck!

Two things:  DO NOT use fat free or even light cream cheese. That will make them gooey.  You need the fat in the cheese to make these set properly.  If you are making these, chances are you are not really caring about the calories and fat content anyway! ;)
Also, crush a pkg of Oreos and add to the cheese mixture, then dip them.  That will help absorb some of the 'goo' too.
DELISH!

These are easy and very rich, but I've never made truffles before and I would have liked more instruction about coatings.  Wasn't quite sure what to do there.

I had never made candy before & was very nervous. This was the first candy recipe I tried & now the only Trufffle recipe I use. The cream cheese is so much easier for me to work with than heavy cream. Each time I make it, I get a little more bold & use the suggestions in the Footnotes. I've even dipped them in candy coatings and melted chocolate. I ADORE this recipe! It's perfect for beginners & those of us who are not confident in the kitchen. Now every holiday, my family asks if I am making these truffles.

LOVED these and they were so easy to make! Everyone I have given them to have had seconds..and thirds.. and sometimes more haha. I only used 2 cups confectioners sugar and 2 cups of MILK chocolate instead of semisweet. I let them sit in the fridge for about 40 minutes then rolled them and coated them in confectioners sugar. GREAT RECIPIE! :)

I made 3 batches, dark chocolate raspberry, coffee toffee, and mint Oreo. I put the mixing bowl and cookie sheet in the freezer beforehand.  after mixing the ingredients, I inadvertently put the bowl in the freezer instead of the refrigerator for an hour. This turned out to be a good mistake. I had no problems with rolling at all. I recommend doing it this way instead. This is a great alternative to buying fancy chocolates to give for a gift and the kids loved helping make them.

This recipe was pretty good.  I did change it up like the others where I cut down the powdered sugar and chocolate chips.  Instead of putting vanilla in I put in 1 1/2 tsp almond extract and that was WAY too much.  If you are going to put almond in I reccommend cutting it down by half.  They were extremely sweet.  but I still brought them to Christmas and everyone still ate them, however I did get a lot of comments about how sweet they were.  Good base recipe though! Thanks!

I was really looking forward to making these but to be honest, it was ALOT of work! I took the day off to do baking and I ended up spending my entire day on these. I suppose much of that was my choice to dip all of them in almond bark for that nice coating. My favorite flavor was the easiest, adding a lg spoonful of peanut butter and then drizzling melted peanut butter over the top. If I make again, it would be that flavor only.

This is a wonderful recipe! My daughter and myself made these for Christmas this year. She made several variations my favorite was using half cherry chips instead of all chocolate and using almond flavoring instead of vanilla. She refrigerated them and then dipped them in melted white chocolate chips then sprinkled with colored sugar! YUMMY and Pretty too!This is a must have in our annual goodie trays!

These were delicious!! A huge hit at the party I brought them to tonight. I actually let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight, right up until the following afternoon...and they rolled SO much easier. I tried to make them after 1 hr in the fridge, and they just melted all over my hands. So glad I decided not to give up on these. They were a lot of fun to make. Everyone loved them. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!!

I LOVE this recipe! I didn't have enough chocolate chips (I had about 1 1/4 cups) so I added a heaping spoonful of unsweetened cocoa (prob about 1/4 cup) to the melted chocolate chips. I didn't add any extra sugar. I think I like this way almost a little better than the original recipe. I've found that 60 mins in the fridge is too long, so I just pop it in for maybe 20 minutes before shaping. I've done all sorts of variations with flavors and coatings, and my personal favorites are coating in more unsweetened cocoa and adding raspberry jam to the truffle mix. Also, these freeze great! I can make a batch, eat my fill, and throw the rest in the freezer to enjoy one or two at a time on another day!

This must be absolutely the easiest recipe (not to mention fastest) to follow, but yielding the most impressive results!  I reduced the choc (normal cooking chocolate which was the only thing I had at home) and sugar to 2 cups each as many reviewers suggested, and split them into 3 batches, one plain, one with a big teaspoon of penaut butter and final one with about 2 1/2 teaspoon of Grand Marnier orange liquer.  It was amazingly easy  - I put the mix into the freezer (covered) for abt 15-20 minutes.  Used a small spoon to scoop out lumps which I then roll by hand.  Heat from my hands melt the chocolate a little, which helps the rolling and create a sticky surface for the sprinkles to adhere to.  Used chocolate drink mix (ovaltine) coz I ran out of cocoa, crushed almonds, as well as sugar sprinkles.  I put each of these into small plastic bags which I then dump the little truffle balls into and shake - voila!  Pretty paper cups add the finishing touch :-)  p.s. to those who had problems rolling the chocolates, you might want to try to change the type of chocolates used coz some may be softer, creamier, harder etc, hence may give you some problems with the texture

Delicious with beautiful texture~ :) I have to say they were a little too rich, even for the extreme sweet tooth like me... you can only take small bites at a time. You must let them sit overnight in the fridge to let the flavor come out. Tasting it upon mixing gives you this very cream cheesy flavor and mushy texture, both of which I did not care much for. The next day they had delicious chocolate flavor and brilliant texture with a hardened outer coating. I cut down to 2.5 cups of chocolate and 2 cups of powdered sugar. Never try to deviate too much from the equal amount of these two ingredients, because it is their even proportions that make the brilliant truffle texture. My truffles were actually extremely easy to roll... Refrigerate for 1 hour, spoon equal messy balls onto parchment paper, store that for 1/2 hour, and take out six at a time to roll. Roll at first with hard pressure and then gradually lighten to compress the chocolate and make it into a nice sphere. The warmth of your hands will make them a little sticky for the coating. A faster way to roll the chocolate into coating is fill a shallow pan with your coating, drop in however many rolled truffles fit, and push the pan back and forth on the counter, making the chocolates roll into the coatings themselves. Rerolling after coating shakes of excess coating and allows you to reshape any imperfections. If you are taking these out and want to keep them cool, freeze a ziploc bag or water bottle full of water and ke

Like other users, I used 2c. of confectioner's sugar and 2c. of regular semi sweet chocolate chips. To make them a little firmer, I added 4 oz of baking chocolate. 
To dip them, freezing the truffles for ten minutes after rolling them was extremely helpful. If possible, I would recommend dipping them twice to have a harder shell.
Some recommendations for flavorings: for peanut butter - use peanut butter/chocolate swirl chocolate chips for filling and dip in German chocolate, or for exotic, add Kahlua to filling and do not dip in chocolate when finished, roll in coconut. Hazelnut is also very good - taste like Nutella!
These are delicious! and I would definitely make these again!

Refrigerate often, work fast, and don't worry if they aren't perfectly round. No one will care. No matter what you do to them, people will eat and love them, but I found the ones dipped in white chocolate and rolled in macadamia nuts to be the biggest hit.

Use 2 cups of sugar and chips and 1/2t of vanilla. The more fillings and toppings you use, the more complicated it gets. I'd recommend sticking to either one filling or one topping and switching out the other one.

I piped leftover choc over the tops of mine. It looks pretty, but falls off easily. Ones coated in cocoa powder are really messy for people to eat so they gravitate toward other ones.

OMG, four ingredients, and so many great reviews.  This was immediately whipped up and added to my recipe box.

I followed recipe as written but I omitted the vanilla.  I split into three bowls to create different flavors -  Amaretto Di Sarano & Almond extract,  Kahlua and Frangelico.  I ground almonds for the Amaretto truffles, coarsely chopped hazelnuts to cover the Frangelico flavored truffles, and a combination of cinnamon, semi-sweet chocolate chips and Cinnabon ground coffee that I ground/blended together and covered the Kahlua truffles.  After rolling and covering I had to chill them again so they would hold their shape.
I imagine those that reduce the chocolate and confectioners sugar end up with truffles of a softer consistency and more cream cheese flavor.  
These definitely need to be served closer to room temperature to taste all the flavor of each variety.

Overall I must say this recipe is as easy (or difficult) as you choose to make it.  Great gift idea.
Yum!

AWESOME!! I made these for my husband for Valentine's Day. I took the advice from other reviews and only used 2 cups of sugar and 2 cups of chocolate chips. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips with one square of unsweetened chocolate and 2 tablespoons of shortening for the dipping chocolate. I halfed the batch and made one half as directed and the other half I added 1 1/4 teaspoons of raspberry extract. One thing I found really convenient was to use a toothpick to dip in the chocolate, that way you can let the excess chocolate drip off and you get a nice, even coating without having to touch it. I also dipped some in white chocolate. I transferred them to wax paper and into the freezer to harden. Then I decorated them with white chocolate, red candy melts (to distinguish the raspberry flavor) and dark chocolate. Drizzling the chocolate with the toothpick method didn't work for me. It was messy and didn't look very nice. I poured the candy melts and melted chocolates into plastic baggies, squeezed out the air and zipped them. I cut the very tip of one corner of the bag off, small enough to make thin lines. This worked wonderfully! They look professional, and taste amazing! Even though they took me almost 3 hours, it was well worth the effort!!

Absolutely decadent. I, too, reduced the confectioner's sugar and chocolate chips to 2 c. each with great success. I've had it with vanilla, orange, raspberry, and lemon flavorings and each one turned out great.

Fabulous!  I did, however, (sorry!) decrease to 2 c. confectioners and did everything else the same.  I dipped mine in chocolate and did four different kinds from one batch: mint, hazelnut, oreo and mocha.  Yum!

these taste delicious, with the adjustments others suggested (2c. confectioner's sugar, 2c. semi-sweets).  mint was everyone's favorite.  i used the dark chocolate mint candy melts from Michael's and splattered green tinted white chocolate on top. i also double-dipped to give a nice thick shell on them.  a few things that helped me tremendously with dipping:  1. if they're lumpy/puffer-fish like after rolling, put them in the freezer for a while and give a quick roll prior to dipping. 2. use a floral block/foam to stick the tooth-picked truffles in to set between and after dipping.  toothpick comes out clean after they have cooled completely.
3. add paraffin to the dipping chocolate.  i added 1/3 block to 2lbs of dark chocolate.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I had never made truffles before and wow-ed and amazed all my friends.  The recipe was very simple and easy to follow.  The only thing I did not do was sift the entire 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.  My hand got tired after sifting about a cup.  I did, however, roll some in melted white chocolate, which was a big hit as well as ground walnuts.  I  tried unsweetened cocoa mix, but everyone didn't seem to like those truffles as much.  I had no problem with them being sticky and made sure to refrigerate them in a metal bowl for about 45 minutes before rolling them.  Great recipe, I'll definitely use again in the future!

Great recipe! I made it according to instructions and found it too sweet, but when I tweaked it a bit the second time around, it came out perfect and chocolatey! I reduced the sugar to 2 cups like others suggested and added about 3 tablespoons of pure cocoa powder while mixing. Don't worry if the mixture isn't completely smooth at this point because once you let it sit out to harden a bit (refridgeration hardens it too much, unless you're trying to speed up the process), use a melon baller to scoop the amount of chocolate you want to form into a ball. Mash this chocolate quickly to make it very smooth then form into a ball immediately. Roll the truffle in chopped nuts, coconut flakes, etc. (you might have to press in the nuts or whatever you use to make it adhere better to the truffle) while the outside of the truffle is still somewhat melty/wet or nothing will stick onto it once it hardens/dries again. Doing this might make the truffle less round so reshape it quickly after rolling in nuts, etc. if you want a nice round truffle. Set on cookies sheets lined with parchment paper to harden. The best flavor combinations that I found were spiced rum rolled in crushed Heath bars and malibu coconut rum rolled in coconut flakes! These are to die for flavors! I did try a very expensive orange liquor in the truffles and rolled with crushed roasted walnuts, but that just doesn't taste good to me.

Yumm Yumm Yummm  these are better than what you buy in the mall etc....  I did ajdust the recipe as others suggested and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the sugar mixture and vanilla to the egg mixture.  One thing to remember is if you have extra sugar that did not stick to your almonds...do not let extra sugar bake with the almonds because it causes them to have a burnt taste.  
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

these were really good! I made two batches, one with semi-sweet chocolate and the other with milk chocolate. Both were really good. I dipped them in melted almond bark so they were hard on the outside and soft in the middle like a truffle you would buy at the store.

I took these to a Chocolate Party last night and they were a huge hit!  I used my electric mixer to speed things up.  Then I did six varieties: Mint Extract, with 1/2 coated in dark chocolate and 1/2 in cocoa powder; vanilla extract with half coated in powdered suger and half in chocolate sprinkles; then coconut extract with half rolled in flaked sweetened coconut and half in ground toasted almonds.  Yum!  TIP: I placed each piece in a mini muffin paper liner as I completed it, to keep all the toppings apart. This will go in my permanent collection!

I changed the amounts like a few other users suggested. I used Philadelphia brand cream cheese. The store brand never seems to work for me in recipes. I used 2C confectioners sugar and a 16 oz bag Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips plus 3 squares of chocolate almond bark melted in with the chips (melted in microwave, 50% power for a couple minutes). I used 1 tsp vanilla and added 2 tbs heavy whipping cream. I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes, then I scooped out 1 inch spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment. I popped them back in the fridge. Meanwhile, I got all my topping ingredients ready. I made up some really tasty combo's such as cinnamon walnut and mocha espresso. This was a fun recipe to make. After my toppings were prepped I washed my hands with cold water, dried them well and rolled the scoops of chocolate very quickly into perfect balls. I then dipped and sprinkled them. I tried to place them on a rack over a cookie sheet but they were very difficult to remove because the bottom melts around the rack as they harden and then they break. Its easiest to just dunk them and then remove with a spoon. I will make these again, thanks!

these are so good and easy! It is very easy to customize too. Add some instant coffee and kalhua for a mocha truffle. Or peanutbutter! or white chocolate and peppermint extract.

These are fabulous and very easy to do. I followed the suggestions of 2 c. powdered sugar and 2 c. chips. They were easy to roll after an hour in the fridge or even overnight (did a couple of batches; vanilla, raspberry & orange). Used a toothpick to dip them in Almond Bark (both chocolate and vanilla). Put squiggles of melted vanilla almond bark and paste food coloring on the tops so people could tell what flavor they were getting. I also did a batch with white chips, maple flavoring and vanilla almond bark. Amazingly good.

I don't know why people felt the need to alter the recipe. I followed it exactly as it was written and they turned out perfect. I also had no trouble rolling it into balls. It was easy to handle after only a half hour in the fridge. Great recipe and super easy!

Ok here goes. I'm going to give this recipe a 5 because in the end they are so pretty and good. I think the problem was ME. I've never made them so I don't know. I let them set overnight because people kept saying an hour wasn't enough. When I took the stuff out of the fridge it was rock hard and it crumbled really badly. I let him warm up some and the warmer it got the easier it was. I didn't do a very good job of making them into balls....they look more like rocks...lol BUT all in all they are yummy and they are truffles....so I'm sure it was just user error!

These are so yummy and so rich.  I made these following suggestions of other people.  1 pk cream cheese and 2 cups chocolate, 2 cups confectioners sugar and 1 1/2 vanilla.  I let them chill and then dipped them in chocolate so it would have that hard shell outer and melt in your mouth center.  Definetely going to make these again and again! thanks

I made these truffles exactly as directed, dividing the mixture into three parts. I didn't use liqueur for flavoring, but would like to in the future (my extended family does not like alchohol in food). It was a bit tricky getting the exact proportion of extract flavorings (orange or almond or vanilla) right for each part. An even 1/2 tsp of extract did not flavor each mixture well enough, so after starting with 1/2 tsp each, I had to carefully adjust upwards until I got the flavor right. Each flavor was different in the proportion of extract. I would have given these a 5-star rating, because the taste is amazing, but I found the truffles too stiff to roll into balls after sitting in the fridge for an hour. The mixtures had to sit on the counter overnight to make them even slightly pliable. It also would have been nice to have instructions on how to make a dipped coating, as this recipe only makes the "inside" of the truffle. Hopefully, they will hold the different suggested coverings after I finish rolling them. The mixture is very stiff, and may not hold ground nuts or jimmies easily. However, the recipe is easy, and very decadent as written. I will make these again, but will try to roll and coat the candies with the described coverings with little or no refrigeration, and then refrigerate them after they are completely assembled. Yummy!

this recipe is so simple! I did reduce the sugar and choc. as others suggested. I also added 1 teaspoon of instant espresso to bring out the flavor of the chocolate, and WOW! I took an all day chocolate class at a local college, where we made truffles, fudge etc. and this recipes is far superior. I will use this recipe for any truffles i make in the future!

These were very good! I reduced the amount of sugar and chocolate to 2 cups each as others suggested. They would have been way too sweet for me with 3 cups of sugar. I rolled and dipped them in tempered milk chocolate and gave them as gifts. Everyone loved them.

I cannot stop eating these. Very easy to make. The only change I made was that I cut the recipe in half to see if I like it first and used raspberry extract instead of vanilla. I ended up making the other half of the recipe that same night. I would not leave in the fridge for more than an hour as it does get hard and crumbly. I also tried dipping some of them in chocolate, but I prefered it without. Next time I make these I will probably try orange and cherry extract.

This is a great easy base truffle recipe - it works great with almost any variation of liquor or flavoring and I found that they are very easy to roll as long as they are not too cold and not too close to room temperature.  I checked with Pillsbury and they said that they do not have to be refrigerated after making, but I think they taste better chilled.  I had a massive assembly line and made 3 whole batches in 3 different flavors/ toppings to give out as Christmas presents, and it saved me TONS of money, and they looked great!  (I did one with Bailey's topped with powdered sugar and a Bailey's glaze drizzle (3T per), one with Orange schnapps, powdered sugar and an orange tinted schnapps glaze, and the last with mint schnapps rolled in green sugar.

I was really excited about this recipe, and I was actually disappointed with these. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but the truffles ended up really hard when I went to chill them...like, crumbly hard. I had to wait until they thawed out--in fact, I nuked them in the microwave for 20 seconds just to make them pliable to make into truffles.  The only way that these taste ok is if these are NOT refridgerated....they need to be served at room temperature at least. Also, these just tasted more like fudge than truffles. In fact, out of all of the truffles I made, people referred to these as the "fudge truffles". So, if you like fudge and don't mind having these at room temperature, go for it. I personally won't be using this recipe again.

I followed the suggestions of other users and used almond bark chocolate to coat the truffles. I also put the truffles in the freezer to harden them faster and make them a little easier to roll into balls. I made three different types: vanilla with white chocolate and walnuts, orange with coconut, and raspberry with almonds. So far I've only tried the orange with coconut and it was delicious. I made them way too big though because they are VERY rich.

Amazing truffles!  I added mint extract for a mint truffle and covered them with chopped walnuts!  So good!

this recipe was very easy. I did as others recommended and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar (sifted) and 2 cups of choc. chips. I left it in the freezer for half an hour.. was pretty easy to mold into ball. it will get all over your palms. i used nuts for some, cocoa, coconut and chocolate. my husband loved it and so did his coworkers. will make again!

Delicious, and very easy to make! After reading the other reviews, I cut down the confectioners sugar and semisweet chocolate chips from 3 cups to 2 cups. After mixing, I chilled it in the fridge for a little less than an hour. I used a melon scoop and dropped the truffle mixture/dough onto a baking sheet. I refrigerated it for about 20 minutes, rolled them into balls, and put them in the fridge again for another 20 minutes. I dipped them in melted chocolate. Yummy! Next time, I'm going to make the truffles a bit smaller. They are very rich!

I printed this recipe out a few months ago. I decided maybe after the reading a lot of the reviews that I would not enjoy rolling the truffles. But I did decide to make them anyway. I got sleepy and just left them in the fridge. The next morning I was concerned maybe I let them sit to long. However, the rolling was easy. So I recommend leaving them overnight, if your concerned with the rolling. They were beautiful to look at. Amazing to eat & easy. My aunt who makes candy told me they were amazing. I highly recommend this recipe. I followed the recipe as written. I went to the pictures and looked at what I thought were the prettiest truffles. Then went with there recipe. It came out  perfectly!

Good base recipe with excellent flavor but...the filling never completely firms up.  I read two other reviews on this, one said to substitute some chocolate coating which has a higher wax content.  Another just suggested just dipping the centers in chocolate coating after forming the balls and before applying the coating.  Both would solve the problem with the balls not firming up.   We devoured them even though they were soft and messy.  Used four different coatings - Oreo crumbs, cinnamon and powdered sugar, powdered sugar, and hot chocolate mix.

Rated a 4 of 5 only because the ones that I tried rolling in confectioner sugar or cocoa powder were a bit too strong for my taste. However, these were very quick and easy to make, and the ones that I rolled in pecans are fabulous!

I made 180 of these delectable treats!  They are extremely rich and make an attractive presentation.  I doubled the recipe and formed slightly smaller truffles.  I rolled them in chopped walnuts, colorful sprinkles, coconut, and crush candy canes, since I made them for Christmas.  Everyone was wowed and enjoyed them thoroughly.  People commented that the truffles were similar to fudge.  The decorated truffles were beautiful when arranged on a large platter and they made adorable presents when placed in a clear box and tied with ribbon.  A hand-cut snowflake completed the presentation.  TIP: roll the chocolates in your desired coatings soon after they are formed, otherwise, the outside of the chocolate will harden and things won't stick properly - if this happens, just re-roll them to regain their stickiness.  These keep well covered in the refrigerator.  They can stay out of the fridge for a day, but since they include cream cheese, they should be kept cool.

I have now made these truffles several times for special occasions, and they are fast becoming my signature treat! Everyone raves about them. I specifically love using white chocolate chips, but I make both white and milk chocolate ones.  I also always divide the plain mixture and make these flavors: raspberry, almond, orange, rum, peanut butter, peach (using liquer), and of course plain. The final thing I do is dip them (using a toothpick) into quality dipping chocolate for a smooth, hard coating. This gives the hard-on-the-outside, melt-in-your-mouth-inside wonderfulness. After I dip them, I put something on the top to denote which flavors they are: orange zest on top of the orange, red chocolate drizzle on the raspberry, toffee bits on the peanut butter, etc. They always look perfect and beautiful, and taste SO decadent!

This recipe is soooo easy (and it makes a TON of truffles.)  My favorite way to make these: follow directions given and chill for at least an hour.  Use a melon scoop to get a perfect shape (a lot cleaner and they don't melt all over your hands) and lay them out on a plate. Freeze them for about half an hour, then roll them in melted chocolate with a fork.  Place them on wax paper and decorate them while the chocolate "coating" is still wet.  Crumbled Andes peppermint baking pieces are great!  Or, if you go for the liquor, I recommend Bailey's or Disaronno.  Add crushed nuts (almond slices work great.. put them in a sealed plastic baggie then pound on it until you get small pieces).  Dark or white chocolate designs are fun too.  Melt either type of chocolate and spoon into a plastic baggie.  Push the chocolate down to one end, snip just a small part off the corner and "pipe" a design on the truffle.

These truffles were easy but not so decadent. They were good but they just tasted like thick chocolate frosting or at the very best, fudge.  I will try a different recipe for truffles next time.

I'm actually wanting to rate this recipe 4 1/2. This was an easy to follow recipe, we added coconut to half the truffle mixture.  We rolled the chocolate half in cocoa powder, and the coconut half in chopped almonds.  The reason I did not give it a 5, and I can't believe I'm saying this (I'm a chocoholic), but it was a bit too chocolatey.  We tried dipping a few, but preferred the truffles coated with the cocoa and coconut.  We're trying mint flavoring and raspberry with a hazelnut inside next.

TO DIE FOR! I made these for work and they were gone in 20 minutes. I made half with the vanilla and half with almond extract. I also covered each with almond bark and then drizzled white chocolate over the top and coated with nuts. I will definitely be putting these is the Christmas goodie bags this year!

Some people said this tasted like frosting but I disagree. When coated in white or dark chocolate it tasted like one great truffle! I made them for a party and everyone went on and on about them! I did a mixture--some were coated in coconut flakes, some in white chocolate, some in dark chocolate and some in caramel! I also added some toffee chips to the tops of some. I've made this recipe twice already! I love it!

I love these! They're a huge hit at my house. My family just raves about them! I add 1-2 Tbsp. cream (towards the end of mixing the cream cheese) per half batch. It gives them a wonderful taste and melt-in-your-mouth kind of texture, but it does seem to make them less firm and harder to work with. I've also tried them with semi-sweet chocolate chips (as the recipes states), with the 2 C milk chocolate chips & 2 C sugar that other reviewers' have suggested, and with 2 C milk chocolate chips and the same amount of sugar that the recipe calls for. Even though I usually don't like semisweet chocolate, I preferred the recipe as stated because it tastes more like a "true", rich truffle and it firmed up better. My dad preferred the milk chocolate/same sugar mix, and my sister the milk chocolate/less sugar mix. Go figure! I roll them in almond bark like another reviewer suggested, and this way they keep their shape. It makes them taste a little more like a candy and less like a truffle, but it is still so good that I don't care. I'm going to try it with regular melted chocolate topping next. Overall, definitely a keeper!

Super easy and delicious.  Not as creamy as some truffles I've made, but the confection was very easy to handle. I used a small scoop and then rolled the balls in my hands to form more uniformly shaped truffles - with most recipes I've tried before, I would have had chocolate smeared everywhere if I tried this method.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and I dipped the truffles in Ghiradelli dipping chocolate.  I will definitely make these again - maybe trying a different flavoring or liqueur. 
Note: If you are concerned that people won't like these because of the cream cheese, or are looking for a cheese cake flavor, you can't taste the cream cheese in this recipe.

Perfect! I split up the truffle mix 3 ways and added about a shot of Chambord, Frangelico and Bailey's Irish Cream and rolled them in graham crackers, brown sugar and dark chocolate shavings! Brought them to work for someone's birthday and everybody loved them!

This recipe was in a cooking magazine that I get through the mail. Made these with my cookie trays last Xmas (posted pic). They were really good, really, really rich, but I got lots of compliments on them. Very easy, if a little messy, to do.

As for being easy, this was great.  I love to make candies and this fit the bill for fast and easy.  However, don't do what I did, as I ruined the texture of the truffles by adding the melted chocolate to the cream cheese without letting the chocolate cool down.  Thus, the cream cheese decided to curdle a bit and the texture was lost!  But, doing a quick roll in nuts is the cure.  Very rich recipe, so make the truffles small for better enjoyment!

I still cannot get over how easy this recipe is and how professionally made the truffles look and taste!  I've now made it a handful of times, each time mixing up what I roll the truffles in (cocoa powder, coconut, sprinkles, chopped almonds, etc.)  My only advice is to be careful to chill the dough in the refrigerator just a few minutes before you roll (so it's less sticky) but don't chill more than 15 minutes or you end up with a solid brick of chocolate you can't work with.  I agree with other reviewers that adding just a bit of cream to the recipe is better than pure cream cheese.  I recommend making these the day you'll be serving them (they are quick and easy) b/c they aren't quite as good if they've been in the refrigerator serveral days (and you don't dare leave them out with all that dairy.)

After some experimenting I made three different flavors for Valentines Day.  Using 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate for the base.  I made Almond truffles - with almond extract dipped in milk chocolate and rolled in walnuts, mint truffles (made with mint and vanilla extract) rolled in powdered sugar, and peanut butter truffles dipped in milk chocolate.  I put them in heart shaped baggies with a ribbon tied around the top.  I have been giving them out to friends and family and my favorite customers (I own an antique store), and have gotten rave reviews so far, and it's not even Valentines Day yet!

made these for my girlfirends birthday party.  Made one 1/2 as recipe is written and the other 1/2 I mixed in crunchy peanut butter, melted peanut butter and drizzled on top of those to distinguise.  Very easy to make and tasty.  I will be making these for future parties.

Oh my gosh!!!I have tried so many truffle recipes and I have finally found this one and it will go in recipe book for future uses. I just made these and the only thing I added was about 7 crushed oreos to the mix. They sat in the frig. overnight and they were just the right consistancy to roll. While I melted my chocolate and paraffin I put the truffles in the refrig. They were alittle gooey when I dipped them, but not a big deal. They turned out great. Will be making these again shortly for Valentine's Day. Thanks so much for this great recipe.

I have been on a truffle making mission this Christmas, these were great.  It is nice to find a truffle that tasted different from all the others (regardless of adding different flavourings).  These were so good & like the title says 'decadent'.  Thanks for sharing your recipe

These are exactly what they say they are, easy and decadent.  I made them for a bridal shower I threw, and everyone was amazed that they were homeade.  Even after making over 100, I would still say that they were so easy.  Just time-consuming to roll them all, I recruited help.

This recipe was so easy!  Though, I did have a hard time getting my coconut, pecans, and walnuts to stick.  During the first batch, my boyfriend said that they were really rich, which is fine, so I added the coconut and the nuts in the individual truffles to cut down on the richness, then coated them.  Whoever I gave these to loved it.  But one hour is way too long in the fridge, I'd say to let the chocolate chill for about 20-30 minutes.  Good stuff, I'm definitely making these again very soon!

These are delicious.  I'm giving it 4 stars for 2 reasons...they will be difficult to give as gifts because they don't last long and the second reason was the type of chocolate. (I think I will try a creamier chocolate such as a Lindt or Cadbury)  They truly are a piece of cake and look like they took hours.  I found that after rolling them into balls, placing them into the refrigerator again before rolling in the coating made them easier to work with as they tend to melt a bit from the heat in your hands and start to lose shape.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I can't figure out where I went wrong-- my truffles don't survice outside the fridge for very long.  This is ok for a party at my house, but not sure they make great gifts due to need for refrigeration.  If other reviewers had different experiences, please let people know.  I may have done something wrong but I followed recipe exactly.  They are good fudgy bits though.

Pretty good.  I had a little difficulty rolling them into nice balls though.  If I didn't roll each one for what seemed forever, they developed cracks.  I will definately try this recipe again though.  I like the fact that it is a versatile recipe that I can play around with.  Thanks!

I gave this recipe 5 stars for the ease of making the truffle mixture and for the taste, but, these took me all afternoon to roll into little balls!  That's likely because I made four different flavours and did it alone.  I made Bailey's, Amaretto, Rum and Kahula flavours.  I rolled the Bailey's and Kahula in cocoa and the Amaretto in icing sugar and the rum in walnuts.  This recipe makes a ton!  I gave some as a gift and the rest were for family. They were a big hit at Thanksgiving and a few asked me for the recipe.  When I need to make something decadent and impressive, I'll use this recipe again.  Thanks!

I love this recipe. It's so easy and yummy. For anyone who has a problem rolling them, if you had watched their video you would see that they tell you to use a small ice cream scoop or melon baller so that you are not rolling them by hand. Makes them simple and quick.

The recipe was simple, which I loved since I tend to mess up recipes.  I halved the recipes and made 30, which was more than plenty.  The chocolates were sweet. I used crushed up graham crackers, crushed up peanut butter chocolate chips, and melted white chocolate as my toppings. Overall, everyone liked them, I would make them again.  

And my only complaint is that it does NOT take 1 hour to make these.  The time given on the recipe is very misleading.  They have you start off with melted chocolate, which is something you have to prepare right before (even if it doesn't take too long).  You have to wait for the cream cheese to soften.  Including ingredient preparations, I would say I spent about 20 minutes prior to putting the dough in the fridge for an hour.  Then the rolling process took much longer than expected.  The dough was crumbly and wasn't sticking together at first, so you have to roll it and soften the dough in your hand in order to get a nice looking solid ball.  It took about 1-2 minutes per truffle to do this, times 30 truffles is 30-60 minutes additional.  And if you plan on doing toppings, you should take time to account for that as well.

It's still a good recipe, and I would definitely recommend you give it a try.  But don't think you're going to finish the entire recipe with toppings in an hour.  I would allot at least 3 hours if you're doing it on your own.

I really thought truffles HAD to be dipped to be good.  Not as written.  Just rolled them in unsweetened cocoa, and unsweetened cocoa with fine ground coffee.  Now, if you add liquid flavoring (rum, Grand Manier, Kahlua, etc), the truffle doesn't get as firm, and just soaks up powder coating.  I used 2 tbls per 1/3 recipe and can barely taste (omit vanilla if other flavoring).  On those, I did melt bittersweet chocolate with a dab of shortening, and dipped.  The "shell" protects the soft middle.  Word of advice, unless you like coma sweet, cut the sugar in half.  I cut it down a third, and it's still a bit sweet.  Will probably use 1/3 bittersweet chocolate next time.  People talk about the time, but it's just easy.  Having to wait an hour or so for them to harden enough to roll was the most time consuming.

I followed the advice from some of the reviewers to reduce the confectioner sugar to 2 cups + 2 cups of chocolate chips and dipped them with 72% dark chocolate and got great results, good recipe albeit it is time consuming with all the hard work like chilling before rolling, melting chocolate, dipping, re-chilling and then drizzling with another coat of chocolate.  

to make it as home made Christmas gifts for loved ones. Got raves from everyone!

So good and so easy! I halved the recipe and divided by 3. One part I did almonds and 1 tbsp amaretto, one I did mints and 1 tbsp mint liquor, the last I did 1 tbsp dark rum and rolled in powdered chocolate. For those reading this, know that flavors change in time. The rum flavor gets stronger day 2, then disappears slightly. All the liquors mellow with time. For the adult flavors I will probably double the liquor and make a couple of days in advance next time. Otherwise, it was a great recipe. Thank you!

This recipe turned out great. Based on other reviews, I cut the confectioners sugar down to 2 cups. I also used 2 1/2 cups of chocolate instead of 3 and used a mixture of semisweet and milk chocolate chips. Otherwise, I followed the directions. The truffles were a good consistency for rolling after about an hour in the fridge. I rolled them in an assortment of coatings, including powdered sugar, finely chopped almonds, chopped coconut flakes, and sprinkles. They look beautiful and taste great. The recipe was really easy, too.

Got Milk?  These truffles are so creamy and yummy!  I followed the original recipe, since it was my first time making them, but I used milk chocolate.  It's strange how the dough was kinda chalky and hard when I pulled it out of the fridge, but once they're rolled into balls when you bite in they are very creamy.  They taste familiar to me, like I've gotten them from a candy shop before, but couldn't quite put my finger on where.  The only tip I could really give is to put it on parchment paper to refrigerate it, cause I put it in there just in the bowl I mixed it in and it stuck pretty good.  I rolled them in crushed candy cane, ground almonds and red and green sugar (the almond went first) and everyone complimented them.  Big Hit!

I just made these this afternoon and this also is my first review and they were great. Super easy (and I've never made truffles before) and they yeild a very nice truffle. So tasty and they look nice enough to give as a Holiday gift. I didn't change a thing in this recipe and will be making again. To the people that were having trouble working with the mixture what I did was after I mixed my cream cheese and confectioners sugar together I set it aside in the fridge while I was melting my 3 cups of chocolate chips. Once the chips were melted I took the cream cheese and sugar mixture out, added the chocolate and then put it all back in for a hour to set. I added rum extract instead of vanilla and they tasted wonderful.

Maybe we're not truffle people because this recipe has such good reviews but we weren't impressed. We all thought they tasted like fudge. I added raspberry extract to half and orange extract to the other half. These just aren't for us.

Very tasty!  I split the dough in half and make half almond flavored, dipped in melted chocolate and sprinkled with almonds and the other half with vanilla and dipped in peppermint chocolate.  Awesome!

I have altered this recipe many times.  I have used white chocolate with strawberry extract, white chocolate with pumpkin and cinnamon, dark chocolate and mint extract, dark chocolate and cayenne, chocolate and bourbon.  The options are totally endless.  Love this recipe!

Sooooo easy and delicious! I'm going to make these annually for Christmas. Great the next day. I divided the batch into 1/3rds and tried rum, orange and vanilla flavorings.

My friend gave me a tip and said to use 1/2 dark chocolate chips and 1/2 semisweet. We're going to try white chocolate with the semisweet next time

These are more like fudge, and not really a truffle. A truffle (to me at least) should have an outer shell and an inside filling... these are just basically fudgy balls. But if you like fudge and that's what you're looking to make, then you'll like these.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing.  I had no trouble rolling them.  I just used sprinkles to cover them, as this was just a test run.  I'll be making them again this weekend for wedding shower favors.

this is my first review but this recipe has compelled me to write it! it's so easy and delicious. I followed the one reviewers recommendations of 2 cups powdered sugar and 2 cups chips and they turned out even better (the original is still good too!). even tried this recipe with reeses peanut butter chips and they were awesome! for the dipping, used merckens milk, dark, and white chocolate buttons since they don't need tempering and you can melt them in the microwave. so fun to make with others, too!

I rate this a 4star only because they are SO rich--really good though. Made the for valentines day and tried rolling them in dyed coconut--didnt work. Confectionary sugar was perfect though. A tip on melting chocolate chips--put thum in a bowl in the microave for 20 secondes, inspect and stir, put back in for 20 seconds. Repeat until melted.

These were not my favorite truffle recipe... They were a little like fudge, which was okay. Not the truffle i expected though. I did love them with a walnut or pecan in the middle and the chocolate rolled in crushed walnuts or pecans. I shaped them into a log and they were delicious! Favorite among friends and family.

Fantastic, though I decided I wanted a crispy chocolate shell. I dipped each ball in melted chocolate chips, set it on wax paper, then topped with sprinkles. It was still really easy but rolling and dipping that many truffles took a lot longer than I expected. Time consuming but simple and a big hit; will make again!

I don't know what I did wrong but from the beginning I didn't understand the directions or footnotes and should not have attempted to make these. The consistency was similar to frosting, even after I let them sit for over an hour. I spooned them into melted chocolate and other goodies and made nothing but a mess. in the end it was all a waste of time and money, the whole batch came out terrible. This morning I hoped they would have gotten more solid but they didn't. I was real dissapointed and it was the only dessert I had for my Valentine :(    next time I will experiment when there are no events planned!

I made these for Christmas treats for my neighbors. Everyone loved the way they looked. They tasted good, but I think with some experimentation (like other reviewers have stated) they can be made amazing.

Very easy. I dipped half the batch in melted Belgium chocolate from trader joe's and the other half in giradelli white chocolate. Then I would drizzle white chocolate on the belgium dipped ones, and vice versa. I ordered boxes from papermart.com and gave them out as Christmas gifts this year and everybody loved them!

These truffles are amazing! At first, I was a bit worried that the cream cheese would give the chocolate too much "tang," but the truffles tasted so chocolately. The inside almost has the consistency of cream cheese, which is the perfect "melt in your mouth" texture. To my second batch, I cut the chocolate in hald and added peanut butter in its place. Heaven! I dipped the frozen truffles (I put them in the freezer to keep them from melting when dipping) in both white and dark chocolate almond bark. They were so good! Two thumbs up!

Dipping these guys in chocolate after took us FOREVER but they were amazing! If you have issues rolling them, put them in the freezer prior and roll with flour on your hands.

ummm - not sure...I used the version of the recipe where 1 pack cream cheese, 2 cups chocolate chips, and 2 cups confectioners sugar.  I split things up a little to try different flavours.  First attempt was using dark chocolate chips, and tried flavouring with a tsp of rum extract in half and a tsp of vanilla extract in the other half.  I would have added another tsp of each extract in each as the cream cheese flavour came out too much in each.  Second attempt I used half a pack of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips, and probably about 1 1/2 icing sugar with a shot of espresso.  I could still really taste the cream cheese, so I added probably another shot of espresso.  I added in more icing sugar to thicken things up a little.  These are more liquidy and will take more to set it looks like.  Attempt three was a full batch with milk chocolate and peppermint extract.  I kept adding until I was sure that I could taste peppermint and not so much cream cheese.  I still have to dip in moulding chocolate, but it looks like these are all going to set up nicely for that.  After figuring out the flavouring a little, I'd do these again, but would also use less cream cheese and more chocolate and extracts in each recipe.

Super easy to make. I did a double batch for holiday gifts. Divided the batch into 1/4 for four different flavors. Used 3 tbs each of Pomegranate Schnapps, Kahlua, Peppermint Schnapps, and Grand Marnier to flavor them. Rolled afterward in (in same order of flavors) coconut powder, crushed almonds, crushed candy canes mixed with powdered sugar, and coco powder mixed with hot coco mix. They turned out very lovely and super tasty. I did however cut the confectioners sugar in half. Three cups per batch is WAY too much. I also added 12 oz total of milk chocolate baking chocolate (brick form, crushed up). I plan on making these again in 6 weeks for my baby shower.

Easy to make, and the cream cheese adds just the perfect creaminess and tang to these little treats.  We used these on our treat trays for our neighbors.  We rolled in crushed peppermint, holiday sprinkles, walnuts, and my favorite, coconut.  Loved by all - will be a permanent addition to our holidays - thanks!

Easy to make and very delicious!  The mixture was a bit hard to work with, but maybe this is normal.  I have never made truffles before so I am not sure.  I just stuck the mixture back into the freezer when it got too soft.  I added some dutch processed cocoa powder to the mixture to add more depth of flavor, and rolled in that as well.  Scrumptious!  Will be experimenting with different flavor combinations for Christmas time!  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  I made according to directions.  After rolling I rolled them again in three different toppings...coconut, coco, and crushed walnts.  They are delicious.  Made them on the smaller size, bite size, so the recipe yielded 100 truffles.  Not bad for a couple of ingredients and a little bit of time.

Easy and quick to make, shape and decorate, but they are waaay too sweet and they do not taste like truffles. They do taste good (although you definitely need to decrease the amount of sugar in the original recipe) and they have a great presentation, but I would not call them truffles...

This recipe worked great. I made no changes and had none of the problems that some of the other reviewers have had. Follow the recipe, it is very simple, you don't need to reduce anything to two cups. These are wonderful and easy to work with. When I showed them on a plate to my fam, the first thing that they said was "Wow, you could sell these!" and they liked the taste as well. Will make this one again, thanks for posting it :)

Easy is right! If you want truffles this is the easiest way to do it. Yes, I think you sacrifice something not making them the traditional way but they are easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. I like the bite from rolling them in cocoa powder but most people have preferred the ones dipped in chocolate and ground almonds. They are extremely sweet, which isn't really a problem considering that they're candy but I might try them with dark chocolate to make them less sugary.

Made these tonight and so far they are great- the consistency was good for working with and I made 3 flavors just from a 1/2 recipe of the base truffle.  I made part of the batch as just plain chocolate with chocolate coating (melted semi-sweet chocolate chips), part of the batch had peppermint extract and the same chocolate coating, and then with the rest I used some bourbon (needed extra powdered sugar to firm it up- also used a bit of almond meal for taste and texture to help with the firming from adding the liquid) and I coated those by rolling them generously in crushed almonds.  We tried some before they were really ready and they were good.  If something is really different in a day or two as far as flavor or texture, I might need to update my rating but so far they seem to be good!  This was the first time I have made truffles such as these- a lot of work getting the chocolate coating on but the basic truffle part was easy!

This recipe was great... so easy!  
My husband's favorite version of this recipe (and likely mine as well) started with a maraschino cherry in the middle, coated with almond flavoured truffle mix, then coated in melted milk chocolate... YUM!

This is an excellent recipe that I make every year at Christmas time.  I can't say enough for the ease of this recipe.  THere may be better recipes out there somewhere, but I can guarantee you that there aren't any that are this easy and taste this fabulous.  I don't even have any changes or additions to the recipe.  I make it as written 100%.

I adore this recipe and make them every chance I get.  They are SO good and always get tons of compliments.  I like to dip them in different kinds of chocolate and then sprinkle with toppings (nuts, coconut, sugar, etc).  YUM!

Wow!Yum! If anyone is looking for a recipe for chocolate truffles, look no further!These are perfect! The texture is really good. They are rich, but the sweetness is perfect if you use DARK chocolate. I dipped them in chocolate flakes, dessicated coconut and different ground nuts. I think they taste better with a hard or crunchy outer coating to get a variety of textures when u bite into them. One tip when making the shapes is to keep half the mixture in the fridge as it can melt and get messy!

These were so simple to make! Very rich and sweet they were a hit at our dinner party! The recipe makes so many that we had left overs, which is great because they freeze well - they're ready fo whenever we need them again! Although, everytime I look in the box there are less each time; these truffles actually taste amazing when you eat them right out of the freezer! Give it a try! Thanks for the recipe! :D

This was incredibly easy to make, although it was a bit time consuming making it. You learn shortcuts on the way, and it shouldn't take me more than two hours next time to make them all. I used raspberry, vanilla and mint extract (I used one teaspoon for each, rather than half to increase the intensity of the flavor).
Make sure you use bark chocolate for your outer shell, if you plan on doing that route. I only had baker's chocolate, and it melts very easily when being handled.
Was very popular among my peers, only have half left and it's the same day I made them!

AMAZING!

very easy too, just a bit time consuming.
I also reduced the chocolate chips and sugar to 2 cups each. 

I split the chocolate base into 4 and made the following truffles:

1. Raspberry flavored dipped in semi sweet chocolate w/ white chocolate stripes (the most beautiful, and very tasty)

2. Orange flavored rolled in an orange peel-cinnamon-sugar-orange sprinkle topping (a bit bitter but interesting)

3. Kahlua flavored rolled in cocoa powder (My favorite, but a bit softer than the other truffles)

4. Vanilla extract rolled in hazelnuts (still yum but a bit boring compared to the others)

Easy and decadent, just as promised. I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings and ended up with about 15 gumball-sized truffles. I dipped some of them in melted chocolate for extra oomph but actually prefer the soft version.  It's much less messy and not quite as insanely rich :)  Ground walnuts are the perfect coating, in my opinion.

Very good! I also coated mine in a nice chocolate shell. I made orange flavor with minced orange peel/cinnamon coating (dark chocolate shell), rum with coconut, mint with crushed candy canes. I also tried this recipe with white chocolate chips, 1 1/2 tsp rum and 1/2 tsp nutmeg (dark chocolate shell) -- an eggnog truffle!  These are rather rich so don't make them too large. Perfect Christmas delicacy! Merry Christmas!

Unlike some other reviewers I did find this recipe easy! I choose to coat mine with chocolate. I did this because I was bringing them to a party and knew they would be sitting out for a couple of hours and I didn't want them to loose their shape. I also took the advice of other reviewers and only used 2 cups each of sugar and chocolate. I am glad I did because they are rich, but truffles are supposed to be rich. I made three flavors: coffee (by flavoring with instant coffee), coconut (with Malibu Rum), and peppermint (with peppermint schnapps). Once coated I topped each with a different topping so guests could tell the difference of each flavor. I used coffee grinds for the coffee (very small amount), flaked coconut for the coconut, and red sprinkles for the peppermint. I did put them in the fridge before shaping into balls and again for another hour before coating them in chocolate. I also made sure to use a higher quality chocolate to ensure that it melted smoothly. Some lower-end chocolates can melt a little gritty. They turned out great and were gone before I knew it! Guess I didn't need to worry about them loosing their shape!

Excellent truffle base. So many options. If you're going to coat with chocolate on the outside of this as a center, make them small. I used almond bark as an outter coating and it was thick enough with one layer. Very good. So easy to dress up. I didn't have a melon baller as some others had used, so I used a measuring teaspoon and that was a great size.

I loved this recipe!  Some reviews that said these were too sweet and too rich almost kept me from trying.  I don't like too sweet either, but these were wonderfully decadent! I reduced the sugar and chocolate to 2 cups as suggested; they were still rich, but I wouldn't say "too sweet".  I split mine into 3 batches - peppermint, coconut rum, and Baileys.  By far the peppermint was the best.  I dipped them in melted white chips and they tasted just like Fannie Mae's Mint Meltaways.  (next time I'll color the melted white chips green for the same appearance)  For the coconut rum, I had on hand coconut extract and rum extract.  These were EXTREMELY good, but the flavor seemed to dissipate quickly.  Next time I'll add more.  Same with the Baileys.  By the end of the day I could barely tell the difference between the Baileys and the coconut rum.  I'll definitely be making these again!

First time making truffles, turned out fabulous. Reduced the icing sugar to 1 1/4 cups sifted. Also used 1 good quality 50% semi-sweet chocolate bar (3.5 oz) and 1 cup dark 50% cocoa chocolate chips. I split the batch in 2 and added 1 tbsp baileys to one half and 1 tbsp almond extract to the other half. I rolled them in cocoa, unsweetend coconut and ground almonds. To die for!!!

These are wonderful! I recommend making them nice and small because they are very rich.  I used the suggestion of many and put in only two cups of chocolate chips and powdered sugar each.  (be sure to use good chocolate)  I made three flavors: mint ones with mint liquer and rolled them in a mixture of 1/2 powdered altoids and 1/2 hot cocoa mix; amaretto liquer rolled in crushed almonds; and coconut rum ones rolled in of course, coconut!  The liquer flavor is hardly noticeable and really needed the outside coating to bring out the flavor.  Will be making these every holiday, thank you!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were such a hit that I decided to make them for the holidays for teacher's gifts and   potluck holiday parties at work.  Don't worry if they are a little crumbly after they come out of the refrigerator.  When you roll them, the warmth of your hand will make them pliable.  They are also a great activity to do with your kids.  My 7 year-old daughter loves to roll the truffles in different coatings.

These taste good, but really are tiresome to work with.  You have to keep putting them in the fridge.  I think it is imperitive that you either cover them in a coating, or cocoa.  That is the only way they will hold at room temp.

This was super easy and super yummy.  I took others' advice and used 2c sugar and 2c chocolate chips.  It was still very sweet...need milk or coffee for each truffle...just the way I like it.

This was so easy, and I made them as part of a "Chocolate Fest" Christmas present (where I just make a lot of chocolately things and wrap them up) for one of my friends.  I'm making them again today for my piano teacher, and a cookie swap I'm hosting tomorrow!

Another thing I though would make them even better was putting little bits of dried fruit and nuts INSIDE the chocolates!

Although the original recipe was very good, I found it hard to have the mixture to a right consistency to roll them. If they were refrigerated to long it was to hard hard, but not long enough to soft.  I also tried making the different flavors to no avail, they all tasted the same... I must have done something wrong.

Just like the title--very easy and VERY DECADENT! =) Everyone was so impressed with the way they looked and thought I spent a lot of money online ordering them. haha Do cut down on the sugar like other suggested, and don't chill it for too long or it will be very hard. I made cranberry ones with dried cranberries stuffed in the center and dipped in chocolate with a cranberry on top!

I made this following the recipe exactly, and I thought it tasted like chocolate cream cheese.  I didn't really care for it, but my husband did, and he isn't a chocolate fan.  I rolled the truffles in either cocoa or icing sugar, and put them in foil cups.  They look really pretty though.

Yummy - nice a nice simple truffle. Be warned - I added the vanilla to the melted chocolate and the choc just started setting in the pan! After panicing I managed to warm it slightly, added a little of the cream cheese mixture and beat the life out of it to get it smooth and runny again - phew!

This was a fabulous recipe!  I divided the mixture into fourths and added coconut extract, peppermint extract, orange extract and vanilla, and rolled them in coconut, confectioners' sugar, walnuts, and cocoa powder (respectively).  I refrigerated for 45 minutes, which was plenty of time.  Will make again and again!!!!  Thanks Jenny!

I LOVED this recipe.  Easy like crazy and oh so delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly but instead of vanilla, I divided the chocolate and added 1 tea of Frangelica in one half and Coffee liquor in the other. I left them in the frige for 1/2 hour as a full hour made them harder to roll.  I then rolled them in chopped nuts, coconut, sprinkles, and chopped choco chips.  I've made these for holiday desserts and for dinner gifts.  They look wonderful on a nice serving plate.  Next time I want to dip them in melted chocolate.  The only thing I'm not sure of is the refrigeration.  I left a small amount of them out of the fridge about two days or so and they were ok.  Still tasted great.  Not sure about refrigeration.  Thanks Jenny for a WONDERFUL recipe.  It is very appropriately named.  They are great with wine too!!!!  Everyone loved them.

I made these for a production meeting. Since I bought 12 oz of cream cheese, I used the remaining 4 oz with a proportionate amount of confectioner's sugar. I then added melted peanut butter chips and 1T creamy peanut butter.  I wrapped these in the chocolate filling and dipped in melted chocolate with a tiny bit of parafin (it looks shinier and becomes a more solid coating).

Very delicious.  My friends thought they were amazing.  I used Kahlua, Amaretto, Kirsch, and Rum to flavor my truffles, with Dark Chocolate, almonds, powdered sugar, and white chocolate (respectively) to coat the truffles.

this recipe was sooooo easy and really turned out well.  they were the perfect taste, not bitter or too sweet!  I used kahlua, baileys and a few more, and rolled them in all sorts of stuff.  I am using them as little gifts and i know that these will go over well!  One tip though, is to add more alcohol than recomended, since the taste wasn't strong enough.

First, this is super easy to make. All together it took me slightly under 2 hours. I tweaked the recipe after I read a bunch of reviews and they turned out great. I used vegan cream cheese (from a container not a block so it was really easy to beat) I used 2 cups of Ghirardelli semi sweet chips, 2 cups of the sugar. After I mixed everything I chilled it in the fridge for an hour. While I was waiting I finely chopped some nuts. I made three kinds of truffles. Pecans on one, almonds and pink salt on one, and the third were hazelnut and espresso powder. I also got Ghirardelli melting wafers to dip the truffles in before I sprinkled them generously with the nuts. For the espresso ones I finely ground espresso beans to a powder and rolled the truffles in them before I covered them with the chocolate shell and then added the hazelnuts. The only negative I had was after you take the mixture out of the fridge and start rolling them in balls it starts to stick to your hands and then you can't get them to look smooth. So after every 4 or 5 balls I washed and dried my hands with just water and kept going. It was kind of a pain but it worked. I made them the size of a Lindt truffle and I got about 40 out of it. All in all I liked this recipe because it's easy and so customizable. Totally worth two hours of work.

Ridiculously easy! But very time consuming!! I made one batch and split into different variations. My favorite was white chocolate chips with orange extract dipped in dark chocolate. I tried to make as written, but was too messy and time consuming. So after a few, I stuck the bowl back in the fridge and refrigerated for 20 minutes then I dropped spoonfuls onto waxed paper and froze for an hour. Then rolled into balls. So much easier!!

This is a lovely recipe, but the finished truffle does not melt in the mouth especially. Still it tastes good, though very sweet. My son (chocoholic) loved them and my friends liked them as well. Sprinkles on the outside worked the best for the round balls. I used cookie stamps to turn them into medallions and coated them with cocoa which looked elegant for gifts.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was so easy and delicious.  I only used 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and instead of the semisweet chips, I used one and a half 8 oz semi-sweet baking bars.  I think the baking bars were the reason I had no problems getting this to harden.  I rolled them out and drizzled with white chocolate.  Everyone loved them and could not believe I made them.

These really are very good. Although, in my opinion, very time consuming if presentation is important-I'm picky about what things look like. I seem to have a hard time getting the coating chocolate to come out nice and smooth. I use a toothpick to dip the truffles in chocolate, but it seems like the truffles are too heavy and will fall or tear once dipped in chocolate. So it just took me a little (ok, a lot) of time. People get really excited when I bring them around.
If anyone has any tips on how to dip balls (no laughing) let me know. I have the same issue when I make cake balls. There's got to be a better, easier, and quicker way. If we can put a man on the moon...

I was amazed at how rich these were! I halved this recipe and my family was asking for more! They may give you a sugar headache but the experience is worth it! I coated these in dark chocolate but I might skip that next time- no more chocolate is needed. So good!

I used this recipe but cut the icing sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Next time I would substitute half the chocolate chips with unsweetened chocolate or bittersweet chocolate. I divided the mixture in to thirds and made a peanut butter one by adding 2 tablespoons peanut butter and rolling the resulting balls in ground salted peanuts. Very good.

Wow! Definitely not Godiva Truffles but they are still fantastic! I accidently put these in the freezer but they defrosted just fine. Great way to use up extra chocolate chips and bark.

These tasted delicious but were very difficult to work with. I had a hard time forming them into truffles, so I ended up only making a few and eating the rest of the "dough" =)

Just made these and they ARE super easy to make, and fantastic!  I did the same as many others, 2 cups chocolate chips and 2 cups icing sugar, and I still ended up with 60... they are great... definitely making these again.

This recipe is so simple yet the finished product tastes like you've been slaving away in the kitchen for some time. I used 2 cups each for the confectioners sugar and semisweet chocolate like suggested by others. I didn't even have a sifter when i first tried this recipe and the truffles still tasted great. I dipped the truffles in Wilton's Candy melts and skies the limit on the outer decor. I found these truffles fun to make and will be a permanent go to dessert recipe for potlucks and just any occasion.

These were good, but not my favorites in the world. The raspberry infused ones were the my favorites. In one batch I added 1/2 peanut butter chips and they were really good. I dipped them all in a chocolate shell.

Simple to make so you can focus on the presentation! I used cocoa, powdered sugar and crushed walnuts for toppings.  They were devoured!  Very rich, a little seems to go along ways!

This recipe is amazing!!  The best part is that you don't have to wait overnight for your truffles to be ready.  Just Chill for one hour and roll!  Instead of using chocolate chips I used all dipping wafers, and had no trouble rolling - in fact they were the perfect texture and taste.    This is a great recipe for the holidays.

Not overly impressed.  These were a huge mess, I'm not a novice when it comes to truffles so I'm surprised I had such a hard time with these.  I made some with caramel cream liquor, 3.5 TBS, and rolled some in chocolate sprinkles and some in caramel flavored hot chocolate(the dry packet, before you mix with milk or water)  I also tried peppermint extract for another 1/2 batch.  I used 1.5 tsp extract and rolled in crushed candy canes.  These were ok, but probably will not repeat.

I absolutely loved these! I did cut the powdered sugar back to 2 cups like the previous reviews said and they were melt in your mouth good! I used kahlua as a base flavor and added coconut extract in one ( I divided it into three amounts. One mistake I made was when I seperated it into three equal parts i used one Tblsp of peppermint extract and it was waaaaaaay too much . Just use 1 tsp or even a 1/2 tsp. I will be making these every year now.

I divided the recipe up in thirds and added orange to one and coated it with a cocoa and sugar powder. Then the other with almond and coated it with milk chocoate shaving and crushed sugar cookie. Verrrrry yummy.

This is very simple and tasty! I split into 3 batches and did one with  a tablespoon of vanilla extract, rolled and after they chilled I melted white choc chips to drizzle over the top.  The second portion I flavored with a tablespoon of coconut extract and coated with coconut after rolling.  These were my favorite!!  The third batch I used a tblspn of almond extract and they were horrible! Waaayy too much almond.  I haven't tried again with less almond, so I'm not sure what amount to recommend, but probably cut by at least half.  Other than my screw up these were delicious and very simple!

The texture was great... but I'm not a fan of cheese cake. The cream cheese made it taste like cheese cake to me. They were okay... but like I said, I'm not a fan of cheese cake. If you like a smooth texture and a little cheese cake flavor, this is for you!

Delicious! I added half semisweet chips and half milk chocolate. I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because I wish they would have stayed a little softer. I covered them in Wilton Chocolate Melts and they turned out beautiful.

OMGOODNESS!!!! I used raspberry, almond, and maple extract instead of vanilla and they came out DELICIOUS!!! *Of course I split the chocolate into thirds and used one extract per thirds-didn't combine them. I am so pleased! I will definitely do raspberry next time too, but am thinking I will try orange and strawberry extracts instead of maple and almond. Very pleased! The white chocolate did muck up a little b/c of the chocolate balls, so I did as suggested in a previous review, I used 2 spoons and rolled the chocolate balls. I think I will use white chocolate in the filling instead of milk choc and use orange food coloring for the or. extract and red for the strawberry, but red in the milk choc for the raspberry ones. Mmmm! Def making agian!

Very tasty! My first ever attempt at truffles was a success. I made these on a cool evening and had no issues when rolling into balls. I learned that I should have covered the bowl while it refridgerated (the exposed surface hardened a bit, but I was able to work it back into a useable texture with some hand warmth). I used three different coatings: powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar and chocolate coated (using Belgian milk chocolate).  I had my colleagues taste test them, and all had good reviews. These will be made again!

Made these for a bridal shower and the women ate them up!! I used the candy melts from the bulk section... I made coconut with white chocolate and coconut flavoring and then rolled them in coconut. Raspberry flavor with dark chocolate and dipped them in dark chocolate. Cherry flavor with milk chocolate dipped in milk chocolate. Orange flavoring with milk chocolate dipped in milk chocolate. I'm making these for Easter!!  It's fun trying different flavors.

This year almost everyone on my Christmas list received little ornament shaped tins of truffles from me. I included 3 flavours, including these Decadent Truffles. They were by far the easiest to work with (solid enough to stand being dipped in melted chocolate without becoming melty themselves or needing a quick sit in the freezer), however they weren't my favourite in terms of taste. I preferred the peanut butter truffles and Oreo truffles (from this site) much more. They looked beautiful dipped in chocolate and dusted with sprinkles or big coconut flakes, or rolledi n crushed almonds, though.

These were great. I dun normally feel so good about a recipe. The whole process took some time but went smoothly, didn't have any trouble melting the chocolate nor rolling the truffles. They came out looking really nice just like the ones in the stores and tasted really good too. Kept popping them into my mouth. Next time I might try cream and dip the rolled truffles in melted chocolate for an added pop. For coatings, I used jimmies, confec sugar, cocoa powder, crushed almonds, and royal icing. Reminds me to try white chocolate for drizzling next time. Overall very impressive recipe.

These turned out great! I coated them with another layer of chocolate though. This recipe makes more of a delicious center in my opinion. Also, I tried dividing the recipe into thirds to make different flavors. In one third, I used "Reeses" peanut butter chocolate chips (in place of the semisweet chocolate), and the result was basically a buckeye. It was great! I also used milk chocolate in another third, and I preferred these better actually.

Made truffles EXACTLY as written the 1st time and found them to be sickening sweet, and this is coming from a sugar fan!  They did however, look beautiful and rolled nicely without refrigerating. The 2nd time I made them I used 2C sugar, and 2C chocolate chips as another reviewer suggested.  These tasted much better, but they look horrible.  They are difficult to roll even after leaving in the fridge for an hour. I am still giving these as Christmas gifts this year, but you can be sure that I won't be making these again- EVER!

These were a nice change.  Very rich.  I liked the addition of the flavoring to some of the truffles.  I was not successful with the white chocolate covering.

Made these last night!  Great basic recipe, the possiblities are endless.  I added  instant coffee and rolled some in conf sugar, some in crushed up vanilla wafers and some in cocoa. YUM.  I'm ready to make more!  Update: Made these again last nite and my 9 yr old daughter helped.  We had a blast!  As before, DELICIOUS!  Uploaded a pic this time!

These are delicious and easy.  I rolled some in cocoa, crushed holiday-spiced almonds, pretzels and powdered sugar.  Roll them bite-sized because they're super rich.

Very fudge-like taste to these....not great for my waistline!  Easy and quick to make, few ingredients needed, lots of versitility = a great product.  Will be making different flavored ones next time and without a doubt they will be just as wondeful.  Can't wait to give them out as gifts!  Thanks!

Wow so easy and they look amazing!!! The first time i made them i made exactly as the recipe said and the second time i made them i followed most of the reviews and only made it with 2 cups chocolate and 2 cups icing sugar. Much less messy if you follow the actual recipe as they are firmer. Really didn't notice too much taste difference just a little creamer when you only use two cups of chips and 2 cups of icing sugar. Everyone loved these both ways! Would make awesome gifts

So easy! My husband did the melting, and I did the mixing and rolling. :o) These are so good, and the take very little time to make. I used peppermint extract (my husband loved these) and almond extract (I'm partial to these). They are superb!

I thought this recipe was great and super easy to make.  We rolled ours in nuts, unsweetened chocolate powder and sprinkles.  They turned out wonderfully and our guests enjoyed them!

These were so easy and a huge hit - I brought them to two different parties and got rave reviews at each. I rolled half of them in cocoa powder and the remaining half in powdered sugar. Delicious!!

MONEY MAKER!! I was looking for ideas for a holiday show last year. I made this recipie and it made tons for a cheap price. Not only that, but you can change the vanillia to any flavoring you want and garnish with the coordinating ingrediant. I put rasberry flavoring in it and garnished with a rasberry. Possibilities are endless, mix match, even add flavor liquer to make a great acholic treat. Just don't let the kid's have them.

This was a great recipe. To melt the chocolate chips I had a pot with water on the stove on a medium-high heat and used a small metal bowl to melt the chips in. It came out extremely smooth and creamy. Add the melted chocolate to the cream cheese mix. I made four different batches in different flavoring. My nephews and niece really loved them, that is a great sign. :)

Very Easy to make. I changed up the recipe a bit. I love peanut butter and chocolate so I decided to add a few tablespoons of peanut butter. As I started getting the ingredients out I realized I did not have enough semi-sweet chips. So I did 1 1/2 cups of semisweet and 1 1/2 cups of white chocotale chips. I rolled them in crushed graham crackers and I loved them! Awesome Recipe :)

Really great recipe - a huge hit for everyone who tried them! I followed the directions in the footnotes and added Kahlua to half the batch and Bailey's Irish Cream to the other - both were delicious. I also melted some semisweet chocolate to dip the truffles in - kind of a pain but really great presentation and taste.

ZOMG ! How on earth have I gone my entire life without making these until now LOL!?! The possibilities of this recipe are endless! I added Boca Java Chocolate Hazelnut Heaven coffee to flavor mine. I rolled some in powdered sugar, some in cocoa and the rest I dipped in melted chocolate. I used Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate. I plan to experiment further next time. I will let ya know what I come up with!

These had a wonderful texture. I am only giving four stars because it would have been way too sweet as written. I halved the sugar and used low fat cream cheese. Dipped in semi-sweet chocolate. Delicious!

These tasted amazing! The only problem I had was that the mixture was really crumbly after I refrigerated it for an hour.  To make the balls though, I pressed the crumbs in my hands to heat them up enough to stick together.  After that, they were perfect.  Next time, I will only refrigerate for a few minutes before shaping them. Also, I halved the recipe to make 30 truffles, but it still made about 50 one-inch balls.

What a treat! The changes were: 2 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 cups of chocolate chips. Used 1 package of cream cheese and rolled them into tiny balls using a 1/2 t measuring spoon. I did put them in the freezer for about 1/2 an hour before and another 1/2 hour after rolling. The colder the better. Dipped in all kinds of melted chocolate. My favorite was melted Andi's mints... SO GOOD!!  Everyone loved them and they look really fancy too!

I make these truffles every Christmas.  This recipe is great because it makes so many in one shot.  I always coat them in melted chocolate after I make them.  This year, I made four varieties (1) classic - dipped in chocolate and decorated with chocolate sprinkles (2) almond - I rolled the truffles in ground almonds then coated with chocolate (3) toffee - I rolled the truffles in Heath toffee pieces then coated in chocolate, and (4) white - coated in white chocolate.  These are great for Christmas gifts.  Make them small as they are very, very rich!

These were a bit of a disaster. I followed the reviews and used 2c choc chips and 2 c sugar instead, but they were still insanely sweet. 1 c would have been fun. And they were such a pain to make; don't attempt unless you have a full afternoon to dedicate. I follwed the review to dump like 1/2 tsppons into wax paper and then freexe, and then roll into balls, but they were still hard to roll...melted all over your hards. That's the biggest problem: these melt so easy! I took them to give them throughout the day, and they kept melting throughout the day! They can barely stay solid 30 min. And this was my fault, but these definitely need a box to give in...something hard. I tried to give in little gift bags but they smooshed completely. And after all that work...honestly, they just tasted like sweeter, teensy bit creamier chocoloate. So then I went crazy with toppings. Crushed peppermint(def. go with the soft peppermint candies), crushed walnuts, crushed cashews, cocoa , and confectioners sugar. That made them look nicer...but the flavor, unless you're a diehard chocoholoc, is still unexciting.These taste the best after sitting in the freezer for a few days...so tehy're not the best to give as gifts. I guess the flavor extracts are CRUCIAL. Didn't feel like spending my money...wish I had.

I just made this recipe for the second time, and it is still amazing! The first time I just followed the recipe and rolled them in nuts and topped off a few of them with white chocolate and they were a hit with everyone I gave them to. This time, I divided the cream cheese/powdered sugar mixture into thirds  and made one batch with dark chocolate, one with regular semi-sweet chocolate chips, and one with the semi-sweet chocolate chips but with raspberry extract instead of vanilla. All of them turned out fantastic! I got a lot of recipe requests and everyone LOVED them. Definitely a keeper. :)

This is the best chocolate thing i've ever made. I made dark, milk, white and semi-sweet truffles. All of which were candy coated in dark, milk, white or semi-sweet chocolates. I covered some in nuts, cappucino sugar blend, coconut and added mint flavoring to a batch. Everything tasted amazing. And everyone loved them. The consistancy is perfect when. USE 2 CUPS POWDERED SUGAR, AND 2 CUPS CHOCOLATE. That worked perfectly.

This recipe, as written, is WAY to sweet.  I think I almost went into a sugar coma the first one I ate.  My instinct was to cut back on the sugar, but I followed the recipe and really wish I hadn't.  The only person in the family who will eat them is the 6 year old.  Now, I do think these would be a 5 star if you cut the sugar in half.  I don't like reviews that completely change the recipe and then rate it, usually at a hirer rating than it deserves.  So I am rating these as a 2 because I would never make them again as written.  Next time I make them, I will use half the sugar.

These are fantastic and so easy!
I followed what some other reviewers said and only used 2 to 2 1/2 cups of icing sugar instead of 3, and only used just over 2 cups of chocolate chips
I used milk chocolate chips for the truffle to give it a lighter taste and flavoured it with 3 tsps of rapsberry flavouring.
I found that it was much easier to roll the truffles if I washed my hands with cold water (to cool them down so the truffle mixture doesn't melt) and then gently patted the water off so my hands were still slightly damp - the water on my hands helped to keep the truffle mixture from sticking to my hands and helped to roll them out into smooth balls.
I refrigerated the balls, then spooned melted dark chocolate over them (I had a hard time trying to dip them) and then topped them with a pretty sprinkle of regular white sugar that I had dyed pink with a couple drops of red food colouring
They were to die for! Rich but delicious!
I'm also going to try other variations like white chocolate centre rolled in oreo cookie crumbs or mint centre rolled in crushed peppermint candies!

These were sooo delicious!! I was in the mood to make something last minute & decided to try these. They were soo easy & quick to make!! Who knew making such a nice & somewhat fancy treat would be this easy?! My hubby & I had a hard time giving some up!! I brought some over to my parents, because I knew my brother was a huge chocolate fan & even my little sister was like wow, these are sooo good I could eat one every day!!! Definatley a hit & I will be making these as holiday gifts for family & friends! I made the recipe exactly as given except afterwards I dipped them in melted peanutbutter chips. mmmm mmmm good thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Amazing! I made as directed and rolled half in confectioners sugar and then with the other half I added some raspberry flavoring and rolled in cocoa mixed with confectioners sugar becuase the cocoa was unsweetened.  Will make over and over again.

I followed the instruction to devide the batter into 3 and add 1 Tbsp flavoring. I added rhum and tequila, but the taste didn't show up at all.
Overall it tastes good but not over the top good. just okay good.

These taste good, but when I think of a truffle, these don't taste like one.  These taste more like eating a small bite of chocolate cream cheese frosting.  Don't get me wrong, though.  These taste good, and are extremely easy to make.  I rolled these in shredded coconut and they looked and tasted really good.

These are good.  I used milk chocolate chips and M&M that is what I had.  this made them kid friendly.  Very good.  I can not wait to try with other flavors, like peanut butter or some carmal.

Good but I followed suggestions from others.  2 cups of milk chocolate chips and only 2 cups of powdered sugar.  The milk chocolate chips make it rich enough, I can't imagine what semi-sweet would taste like!

These were amazing! 
You must coat the truffles with chocolate! I made three batches.
1. Inside - substitute white chocolate, Outside - melted mini-kisses & semi-sweet chips
2. Inside - used original recipe, Outside - peanut-butter chips, and semi-sweet
3. Inside - used original recipe, substituted mint extract for vanilla, Outside - Andes choc.mint chipts & semi-sweet
NOTE: the consistency for dipping chocolate may become thick when mixing other types of chocolate with the semi-sweet, gradually add more semi-sweet to the mixture to obtain desired consistency for dipping.

These were excellent.  I made them just for the family for Valentine's Day.  I probably should have made  half a batch because I can't stop eating them!  I used the suggestion of another reviewer to make them softer by using only 2 cups of sugar and chips.  Then I melted white candy coating and dipped them.  I also divided the batch into 2 and added raspberry flavoring to one and butterscotch to the other.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I don't think there was a single person that had one that didn't ask for the recipe! They were a HUGE hit and so easy to make! I have only made them this one time (and will surely make more in the future!) and I just used the vanilla flavoring. Next time I will play around with other flavors. Some I rolled in nuts, powdered sugar, cocoa, some I melted semisweet chips with shortening and coated, some with vanilla chips and some with milk chocolate chips melted with the shortening. I used sprinkles on a few, hot chocolate powdered mix.....basically whatever I had laying around! These were a lot of fun to make!

RICH! But absolutely amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the flavoring. I split the batter into thirds and put 2tsp of vanilla, raspberry, or cherry extracts in each third. I then rolled them in either pecan pieces, chocolate sprinkles, coconut, confectioners sugar, or powdered cocoa. Very rich and sweet, but I absolutely love them. They really are decadent. I'll definitely be making these again.

I made these as directed and dipped in 2 1/2-cups melted chocolate chips with 1 T. of crisco added. They tasted like fudge truffles (definitely good for a chocolate fix!)Next time I'll try dipping in other flavored chips like Peanut butter, White chocolate or raspberry.

Easy, delicious, and a huge hit! I made two batches, one with peppermint extract and one with raspberry. I rolled them in melted almond-bark chocolate so they'd have a crunchy chocolate shell on the outside, and then I put a dot of colored icing to indicate which was which. I can't wait to try this again next year and try orange extract! Also, I made a vegan batch for my vegan stepsister using vegan cream cheese substitute - went over quite well, and easy to work with.

I reduced the powdered sugar to 2 cups and used 1 bag (2 cups) milk chocolate chips.  The taste was awesome but the rolling process was challenging.  By the time I rolled 4-5 they were sticky so I had to put back in the freezer, wait, then roll 4-5 more....

I separated the batter into 4 bowls and used a different extract for each: orange, butter-vanilla, rum, almond. I rolled the orange-flavored truffles in cocoa powder (they were by far the best). I put a whole hazlenut in the middle of each almond-flavored truffle and rolled them in crushed hazlenuts. I rolled the rum-flavored truffles in shredded coconut. I split the butter-vanilla truffles and did 1/2 in crushed peppermint candy canes and the other half I double-dipped in melted chocolate. My colleagues really liked them. They were easier to make than I thought truffles would be, but a little time consuming if you make all the different kinds. Next year I'll probably make the whole batch the orange-chocolate rolled in cocoa kind.

I made these for coworkers for the holidays.  The 3 cups of sugar sounded too much to me, so I halved it and only used 1 1/2 cups.  I figured that these were supposed to be slightly bitter anyway because they're dark chocolate.  They were pretty easy to make, albeit a pain in the butt to roll each ball by hand, but it was worth it.  I finished them by double dipping them in a chocolate/parrafin wax mixture, which made them look nice and shiny, and also helps to lock  in their moisture and keeps them fresh longer.  My coworkers RAVED about them, and one said that these were better than anything you could buy in a store!

These were good...not exceptional. An easy recipe! We made three versions: orange flavored-rolled in cocoa, mint flavored-rolled in powdered sugar, vanilla butternut flavor-rolled in chopped walnuts. I refrigerated them after making...they taste better if you let them come to room temperature again before eating (meltier, rather than dry).

This was super easy to make. I followed some other suggestions, as I am not a HUGE chocolate fan... I reduced to two cups each of the chips & the sugar... I did half semi-sweet chips and half milk chocolate. 

I actually did a double batch and did half with vanilla and half with almond extract. I then covered them in cocoa, powdered sugar, coconut, chopped walnuts & chopped almonds. All I can say is that the Vanilla w/ almond is awesome. 

Great recipe!

The flavor is good, but they were too hard after sitting in the fridge, then too soft after sitting out a while.  We like the Eagle Brand Chocolate Truffles much better.

These were just OK. I had to leave them in the fridge for well over an hour before they were firm enough to shape. I used swirled white and semi sweet chocolate chips and added some almond extract. I took them out, rolled them in nuts and left them to set some more. Then I dipped them all in milk chocolate. They were very pretty, but much too sweet even though I reduced the sugar by half.

Tastes like fudge and was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving.  We used powdered sugar, and colored sprinkles to decorate.  Very easy to make and delicious!  :)

Wow, these are almost TOO rich.  One is enough to keep me in a happy chocolate mood all day and SO easy!  I think it would be yummy to try with some flavorings like cherry, strawberry or maybe mint.

Excellent results, but only after I followed the directions of some other reviewers.

I only used two cups of chocolate chips and two cups of confectioners sugar. 

Also, the melon-baller method was a no go. Had to roll by hand. Which was fine by me.

Also, I was making this recipe for a high-end tequila tasting party... so I replaced the vanilla with a very nice anejo tequila. It turned out perfectly.

Everyone at the party LOVED them. I got compliments all night long.

I made these a couple days ago for a party that I had today. No one really ate them but I like them. Warning, they are really rich and do make them as small as you can! I made exactly as the recipe says except I put in rum extract instead of vanilla. I can only eat one a day and I made about 30 of them, not too small either! OH well :) they are good anyways! I didn't use as much sugar though.

Good base recipe - Very simple.  I dipped the balls in melted chocolate and sprinkled some with crushed nuts with chocolate crunchies, others with choc. mint crunchies and chocolate coconut crunchies.  I drizzled others with white chocolate.  I highly recommend using good quality chocolate.  They were a big hit especially the ones made with good quality dark chocolate.

These were great!  The truffles were really easy to make and not too messy!  I made three types.  One with vanilla extract, rolled in a combination of powdered sugar and cocoa.  Another one I made with mint extract, rolled in cocoa drizzled with dark chocolate.  And finally, the last batch I made with Rum extract, rolled in coconuts.  To make the truffles, I used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate.  Great recipe - Thanks!!

YUM!  I got about 4 dozen good sized truffles per batch.  I followed the instructions as indicated but used 1 1/2 c. milk choc and 1 1/2 c. semi sweet choc chips.  I also made a batch using Grand Marnier & semi-sweet choc chips, Kahlua & semi-sweet choc chips, Reeses PB chips (1 bag plus milk choc chips to equal 3 c.), and Andes mint chunks (1 bag plus milk choc chips to equal 3 c.). I omitted the vanilla in those.   I dipped some in melted chocolate bark and some in melted milk chocolate, and then drizzled with colored candy melts to decorate.   Others I rolled in nuts or coconut after dippping in chocolate.  My favorites were Grand Marnier and peanut butter, but they were all good!

I made these for Valentines. They turned out pretty well. It was a bit too sweet for me when I used the amount of sugar that was instructed. Especially when I used white chocolate, it came out way too sweet. I used liqueur and vanilla extract for my semi-sweet batch, and those turned out delicious. My white chocolate ones really were way too sweet. So sweet that I didn't bother adding extra flavoring. Afterwards, I rolled them in either walnuts, coconut, or I dipped them in white/semisweet chocolate. Semi-sweet was really great, just not the white chocolate, which is why I gave a 4.

I have one word..MESSY!!!  I thought this recipe sounded easy enough, and it was...but what a mess.  After refridgerating for one hour I attempted to roll into balls. They were VERY gooey and extremely STICKY.  I made 1/3 with almond flavor and coated with hot cocoa mix, walnuts, and white chocolate drizzle. I think the final product looked OK(see photo), and tasted delicious...because of the mess I am only giving this recipe 4 stars.  Maybe using a melonballer, as others suggested, would have made things "neater".  I'll have to try that next time. Thanks for this recipe.

Very quick, rich recipe to satisfy your sweet tooth! Also very versatile! I divided into 3 batches, rasberry, mocha and mint! I rolled each in a mix of semi, milk, and white chocolate after being refrigerated first. No melting, no problem with consistancy ( I used 3 cups sugar ) A definite keeper!

A mixed review from my house- my husband likes these better than the other recipe I tried, but I preferred the other one!  These are a bit sweeter than my taste, a bit less creamy (in my opinion).  One the other hand, these are MUCH easier to handle and shape, actually formed balls instead of the lumps i ended up with from the other recipe...

This recipe worked more or less perfectly for me. I did everything as described. I found that while rolling, the balls softened, so I just stuck them back in the fridge when I was done. I coated some in coconut and some more in crushed walnut. Oh, and I added a bit of rum. But I think I needed to add more. It was about 2 teaspoons worth, and except for the first bite, you really don't notice the rum.

awesome! I am only 11 and I made this recipe and it turned out great! I made it when we had company coming over and everyone loved them. but I had to freeze them overnight and the rolling turned out to be a little more difficult but they still worked awesome, especially when I rolled them in some confections sugar and coconut.

These taste amazing.  They are very simple to make, although rolling them into balls is a little bit time consuming.  I was hoping to get 60 out of the batch, but only ended up with about 45.  I followed the advice of others and used 2 c. powdered sugar and 2 c. chocolate chips.  I also used milk chocolate chips as I prefer the milk chocolate.  I split it into 3 and did mint flavoring, rolled in powdered sugar, almond flavoring rolled in chopped almonds, and coconut flavoring rolled in coconut.  I can't decide which is my favorite!  I did have to leave it in the frige for an hour (I probably would have let it stay in there longer if I had the time.)

These were really easy and tasted really good.  When I rolled them up and put different toppings on they looked great.  I put the mixture in the fridge to harden up as directed, but then it got really hard and crumbly, so I had to mash the balls together.  Next time I will skip the fridge step.

These were very simple to make and tasted great!  I gave them only 4 stars because they were extremely messy and hard to work with, and nothing except cocoa, powdered sugar, and sprinkles stuck to them.  I really wanted to roll some in coconut and walnuts, but it wouldn't stick.  They had a very luxurious taste though.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy truffle recipe. I also cut the sugar and chocolate down to two cups each, and they came out great. I used vanilla, brandy, orange, and almond extracts and put them in bon bon cups to go with my Christmas cookies.

Holy cow.....these are amazing.  I have yet to coat the truffles in chocolate, but from the taste of the filling, they are qute good.  I used Mint extract, raspberry liquor, and Kalua.  I also used imported dark swiss chocolate, removed 1 c of powdered sugar, and added ~1/2 of heavy cream.  I can't wait to see what people at work think.....

These Truffles are so rich and creamy and very easy to make. Only difficult thing is rolling them into balls a bit messy but worth it. The only change I made to this recipe was I put in some extra Cream Cheese about two table spoons. For the flavors I made them with Kahula, Rum and vanilla.Did not get much of the Liquor taste did not want to make them too soft. Left them in the refrig. too long and they got to hard. Had to micro them for 15 to 20 seconds to soften them up. Rolled them in chopped pecans, walnuts ,coconut and coco. Will definetly make them again.Next time will spread mixture on plastic wrap and shape it into a square then when cooled cut into squares to size wanted then roll into balls.This might make it easier and get more uniform sized balls.These are sooooo Good. Thank you JENNY

These truffles ended up looking really professional and tasting scrumptious! The only problem that I came across was that the mixture went lumpy when I added the chocolate to the cream cheese in some of my batches. I solved this by microwaving the mixture again after the addition of the chocolate until it was smooth again.

Fabulous recipe and MUCH easier than the truffle recipes I had used in the past. I replaced mint extract in one of my batches and used white chocolate chips in another. Makes a great Christmas gift! Only thing-- mine only needed about 30 minutes of refrigeration.

I would make these again. Easy enough for my first truffles. I included some of the recommended modifications in other reviews. I only used 2 cups of sugar and dipped in candy coating to have the two textures. The mixture was very hard to work with after refrigerating, but I muscled through. They were a huge hit. I dipped them in a variety of toppings put them in mini cupcake liners and gave them away in boxes for Christmas.

I made 5 batches pod these for Christmas gifts and they were amazing, didn't try the recipe as it's written- I took the advice of other reviewers and used 8 oz cream cheese 2 cups confections sugar and 2 tblsp heavy cream. I also didn't measure my chocolate- I just used a whole bag. 
I used orange extract on on everything batch and stuffed them with marmalade. The second batch I stuffed with raspberry jam, the 3rd I stuffed a Hershey's candy cane Kiss I need the middle and the rest were chocolate. 
I let my cheat cheeseburger come to room temp and mixed everything in my food processor, then freezing. Once rolled and stuffed, I froze them again while melting chocolate for the coating. 
They were all excellent but the orange and Hershey's candy cane ones were everyone's favorite'

made as directed, taste is pretty impressive for what it is. DEFINITELY a day waster as another review said. highly recommend using mellon baller or teaspoon since it gets sticky fast and gets difficult to shape. refrigerate & work with small batches at a time.  these do need a top hard coat to help give a true truffle experience of textures & flavor. next time i will plan flavors ahead and add to MELTED chocolate chips before mixing with the sugar & cheese-trying to add flavor after mixed is nearly impossible. TIP - i added about 1/3 part Nutella to 2/3 truffle which hugely improved ability to hand shape and added wonderful flavor, but needs to be somewhat room temp to then roll in coarse coating like nuts etc.

These truffles are absolutely a must try recipe! Alone without any decoration they taste DELICIOUS! In my case I decided to dip them in Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site. There are no words to describe how delicious they are with ganache. Will definitely make them again and for sure it will become a staple of your repertoire.

These were amazing and so easy! I used an electric blender to help make everything combined. I also put in lemon juice instead of vanilla and topped it with lemon zest. Note- make the truffles a lot smaller than you think they should be, because they are VERY rich!

This really was a simple recipe and it was a big hit at the Christmas party! Personally I dislike the way truffles are normally so overly sweet so I altered the recipe slightly and the end result was simply divine! I used 1 3/4 cup confectioners sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Then, I rolled them into 4 different toppings. I used a 1 to 1 ratio of baking cocoa and confectioners sugar, red sugar sprinkles, green sugar sprinkles, and for the seasonal hit I went with a combo of red, green, and white sprinkles. Everyone who ate one raved that they were the perfect amount of sweet and came  back for seconds and even thirds.

Followed the recipe, but had to lessen the confectioner's sugar, only placed 2 cups.Very good. My hubby loved it and brought in a get together and I got good reviews. Loved that it was so easy to do.

Wow these are so good! Ingredients are easy to come by, the only annoying part is having to roll them all out. I only make about a quarter of a batch at a time so the rolling and decorating part doesn't take so long.

I did make some adjustments to taste, but this is such a fantastic base recipe for truffles! It helps if you keep most of the batch in the fridge and make a few at a time as it began to melt in my hands after a few minutes. Rolled them in sprinkles, they were a huge hit and gone within an hour!

I used two cups of sugar, one bag of white chocolate chips, pumpkin flavored cream cheese, and a shot of Bailey's.  I'm having trouble shaping them, but this is my first truffle attempt.  The mixture is very pretty and tastes just like a truffle should.

Very smooth and decadent. I ran out of semisweet and had to use half white morsels. Still a nice brown color. Firmed it up in the freezer. Rolled mine in cappuccino Carmel powder.

This recipe was super simple and very easy to modify to whatever flavors you are in the mood for. I have subbed the vanilla extract for orange, raspberry, and coconut all to good effect. I have also used different kinds of chocolate chips (dark chocolate, white chocolate, etc). My favorite so far has been dark chocolate chips with coconut extract, dipped in chocolate almond bark (the leftmost truffles in this picture). I would definitely recommend this recipe.

These were great, but I made a few changes to the recipe, since other reviewers said it was too sweet:
I used 2 cups of confectioners' sugar instead of 3
I used Neufchatel cheese (it was all I had at the time) instead of cream cheese
I used 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips instead of 3

I separated the recipe (excluded the extract) into 4 different tupperware containers, and added 1 tsp of different extracts to each container to make different flavors (don't forget to label which one is which!). I put it in the fridge for 2 hours to harden. The chocolate melts in your hands easily while you're balling it up, so you have to really work quickly. The combinations I came up with were: 
Vanilla extract rolled in sprinkles
Peppermint extract rolled in crushed candy canes (one of my faves)
Almond extract rolled in crushed almonds
Coconut extract rolled in shredded coconut (my other favorite)
Melted peanut butter added to the chocolate mixture with peanut butter drizzle
I put each truffle in a mini baking cup for easy serving/less mess, put it in tupperware and kept it in the fridge for 24 hours before serving and they tasted delicious!
The taste was perfect and I got many compliments on them! I feel the recipe as written would have been too sweet for my liking, but the idea is fantastic!

I think I like these better than using heavy cream.  The slight tang cream cheese with the sweet of the sugar and chocolate is rich.  I only used 2C of the powdered sugar and I added 2T of Amaretto.  They are divine!

These were great! I used vanilla extract as the recipe called for, coconut extract, and orange extract. I rolled the orange and vanilla in confectioners sugar and I rolled the coconut in flaked coconut. The coconut truffles were delicious! Everyone loved them! The vanilla was good but not as good as coconut and orange were not very good though my 6 and 8 year old brothers loved the orange. Overall great recipe and was really easy. I had no problem rolling them as other comments said they did. I will definitely make these again and they are perfect for a gift if you put them in mini cupcake liners. 5 stars!

Loved this recipe.  Made it for Christmas but only used 2 cups of the confectioners sugar.  Also, I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave instead.  Split the recipe into two and used mint and vanilla extract.  My colleagues loved them at work!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I rolled each one in granulated sugar for a sparkly affect.  I took them to work and everyone loved them.  I had requests for the recipe.  Thank you!

I halved the recipe because in our house there's only myself and my wife.  Half the dough was flavoured with vanilla and the other half with almond extract.  I over chilled the dough too long, so shaping the truffles was difficult.  The almond truffles were rolled in powdered sugar and the vanilla truffles were rolled in cocoa powder.  The results were *very* tasty, so thanks for sharing!

I used to make these for the holidays, then somehow lost the recipe when I moved.  I am so very happy to have find it here as my family still asks when I will make them again.   So they will have them for a special surprise this year.  A simple way instead of dipping, use candy molds that you have precoated with chocolate, put the truffle into a piping bag or even a plastic bag and cut a nice size corner for an opening.  Pipe into the mold, put in ice box to set a bit then cover with more melted chocolate coating, running a spatula to remove excess from the mold.  Refrigerate until set and pop out of the mold, perfect every time.  These can also be brushed with a bit more melted chocolate if you want and then sprinkled with nuts or other candy type sprinkles.  I've even used white chocolate coating that marries well with the semi-sweet chocolate truffle filling.  Be warned though, these are especially rich and decadent!

Just finished this recipe,I cut the recipe in half and still got 50 1/2 inch rolled balls. It starts to set up sooner than it says. I found it easier to work with by not leaving in the fridge as long. Rolled them up and they are amazing. So creamy and delicous. Rolled them in shaved chocolate, crushed candy canes. Even mixed together 2tbls spoons of ground coffee with cocoa powder and rolled them in it as well. (If you like coffee, and I do)Will keep this recipe for sure and use again.

I LOVE the simplicity of these! I also tried this with regular chocolate chips instead of semisweet. Both turned out really well. Then I took the advice of rolling some in some coconut, and some in crushed walnuts and almonds- they were all very good. Makes a great, easy treat to give out in small gift bags on holidays or special occasions or even for a dessert platter at a potluck. Thanks for sharing!

Love making these truffles (aka chocolate balls).  I usually roll or mix in things (i.e. coconut, chili/cayenne, cinnamon).  Really good for hosting parties

I thought this would be a good recipe for a book club meeting since we all adore chocolate.  It was so incredibly rich it was almost sickening.  I reduced the amount of icing sugar on my next attempt and still they were inedible.  The recipe is simple but there are numerous other great truffle recipes.  If 18 chocolate lovers couldn't manage to finish one truffle each.  .  .

this is first time i ever made Truffle and it's very easy and so good as everyone said!! I did use about 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1 cup of bar and it does make it easy to form. I only put it in 10-15 mins and was able to make them in ball. Yes the hard part is dipping in chocolate. it took me a while to get a hang of it.

I split the mixture and replaced the vanilla with different types of alcohol or mint extract.  Directions say to refrigerate for an hour and then roll into balls.  I refrigerated for about 10 minutes and they were ready.   They were super easy to make, and I got rave reviews!

These have always been a hit!  We've been making this recipe as gifts for family for the past few years and people are always raving about how delicious they are.  This year is no exception!  We like to go bare bones with just powdered sugar and peanuts.

SUPER easy and delicious! I made a double recipe then split it up into different flavors. I added coffee and instant coffee mix to one, peanut butter to another, and kept the last plain old chocolate!

Easy and SO good! I kept my truffle mixture in the referigerator then shaped and rolled the truffles in different coatings (ground heath bar, chopped nuts and confectioner sugar) the next day. Gave them out as favors and they were a HUGE hit. Definitely a keeper!

I have made these every christmas and valentines day. Every time I make them people go on and on about how amazing they are. I switched out the vanilla extract with raspberry extract and I dipped them in ghiradelli baking chocolate. This recipie has been added to the family cookbook, if you want an amazing truffle recipie go no farther, you can easily change this recipie to fit your personal taste

I love this recipe and yes it is easy (even for me)!  I made it exactly as the recipe said and everyone loved them.  They actually did not believe me that they were hand made.  I have read what others have suggested and will be trying some of them; especially dipping in chocolate.  I did add some peanut butter to the middle of some which was excellent and rolled the others in cocoa, coconut and chocolate sprinkles.  Thank you for this great recipe.

These are a great option for an EASY, BEAUTIFUL treat. I have made these to give as gifts several times. I roll them in ground pecans/walnuts, coconut or leave them plain. A little too chocolatey for my tastes, but everyone else seems to love them! I would like to try to put peanut butter in one of them sometime. =)

These are always a hit during the holidays!  They come out beautifully when done with multiple toppings such as coco, sugar crystals, coconut, cinnamon etc.)  It makes a lot, so leave a lot of time to roll and coat in toppings.  Also, don't refrigerate too long or it will be very hard to work with.  Again, these look beautiful and are always a hit.  Thank you so much for the wow-ing recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as-is, except I used Valhrona 71% chocolate instead of chocolate chips. I cut the recipe in half, using: 1/2 (4 ounces) cream cheese, 1.5 confectioners' sugar, 1.3 cups (three bars) of chocolate, and 3/4 tsp of vanilla. These turned out wonderful. I got 15 large truffles out of it. I recommend not putting it in the freezer to firm, since I tried that and it got too hard so I had to microwave it in order to scoop. Keep checking it while it's in the fridge is probably a better idea. Using better chocolate with a higher cocoa percentage probably balanced out using the full amount of sugar, and it wasn't too sweet at all, but was perfect. Shaping the truffles is difficult. I think rolling them in crushed nuts works the best to hide imperfections, and it sticks wonderfully.

I gave this only 4 stars because as it is written, this recipe is not that exciting, but when you let them harden in the freezer, then dip in melted almond bark (chocolate candy coating) and roll in chopped almonds, they become worthy of 5 stars!

These are great, impressive and taste awesome. I made them for my husband for Valentines Day and he loved them.  Only refrigerated for 30-40 minutes and it was perfect working consistency.

I made these for valentine's day.  I normally don't make sweet treats.  These were SO easy and they tasted DELICIOUS!  I don't even like sweets very much and these are about as sweet as it can get, and I have eaten more of these than my fiance who I made them for who loves candy!

Followed the recipe exactly and found that these truffles are just okay.  I much prefer a truffle made from a traditional ganache recipe (made with a good quality dark chocolate and heavy cream).

Very easy to make! I rolled them into balls really quickly because they would start to soften in my hands but the cocoa powder coated on perfectly. Mine tended to be softer though so I'm keeping it in the fridge!

I don't know if I've done something wrong, but these truffles came out very hard. I put it in the frig to cool, and within a half hour the mix was hard as a brick. I had to remelt and then hurry and ball them up. I didn't really care for the taste, but my husband is the chocolate freak, he didn't care for them either, and we both can't understand why none of the truffle recipes include a coating of hard chocolate on the outsides. Thats truly a truffle! Overall, at least it was a good learning experience, and I ended up remelting the batch with heavy cream this time, and then let set up for about 20 min., then dipped them into choc. coating bark, and then they were great. I was happy that I could at least salvage them.

Excellent Truffles. I don't like to change recipes the first time I try them, but for this I used Milk Chocolate chips instead of Semi-sweet. VERY melt in your mouth truffles. They are wonderful..  Also, don't refrigerate them too long, they will become hard to roll. I set mine in the fridge and then got busy and left them there for 5 hours.. I had to use the 'soften' function on the microwave to get them so soften up enough to roll them in to balls.

These were good. Used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and almond extract instead of vanilla. Chilled the mixture, rolled them into balls, then popped them in the freezer until they hardened. Then I dipped them in melted chocolate almond bark. They weren't pretty, but they were good.

These were one of my favorite new additions to my Christmas tray this year!  Rolled mine smaller, maybe marble sized, and dipped in melted white chocolate.  Drizzled with melted chocolate.  Very decadent indeed!

SO good! I made this exactly as it said however i refrigerated it overnight due to time schedules. still turned out great! I coated in vanilla and chocolate almond bark covering and put coconut (which i ground through the food processor) on the white ones and finely chopped pecans on the brown ones. VERY RICH. you eat one and you're done but they taste great! (i dipped them twice using toothpicks to hold the refrigerated inside and set on wax paper.)  also i only used 2 cups confectioners sugar and chocolate chips. made a very creamy truffle like inside more would've been too much!

Made these today - halving the recipe as it seemed like so many.  Just put them in the fridge.. Added strawberry essence to make them flavored but not too sure if this had an effect on the chocolate as it seems to have gone lumpy in them.  Is this normal?  Seemed to taste ok (of course I had to taste before putting them into cool).  Any tips on this would be gratefully received.  Guess I will reserve judgement on them until they are rolled.  They also seem very sticky.

These are very tasty; however, very rich!  Strongly suggest rolling in salted nuts to offset the richness.

This recipe really needs the changes suggested by other reviewers.  Unfortunately, I followed it as directed. Tastes great and the first part is easy, but as directed the "dough" comes out too dry and crumbles when you make it into balls.  After working it awhile it will make a nice ball, but nothing sticks to it as it is too dry.  I will have to add more cream cheese or less sugar next time, not sure... good start, though.

These were richly wonderful. I took others advice and only used 2cups sugar and chocolate chips.  They were a little hard to roll because it was so sticky, but I rolled them all, then dipped them in dipping chocolate. I used mint extract instead of vanilla on one batch.  It was good, but not great.  Next time I'll just do chocolate.  They made great Christmas presents.  No one could stop raving about them.

Wow how yummy!  When I made these I used a tiny (ice cream scoop) about 3/4 inch size and I "scooped" them right away onto sheets of foil then I put in freezer...about 20-30 minutesand then rolled to make them round and pretty.  I made some with white chips and added coconut flavoring (I used 2 cups of powder sugar and 2 cups melted white chips) dipped them into white almond bark then rolled into sweetened coconut (which I wizzed through the food processor just to make it a little finer) were oh so yummy.  I'll post pictures soon.  Very good!

Soooooo good! I made half a batch as a practice run for Christmas. I thought they were going to be dry because when I took the mix out of the fridge it was very hard and crumbled when I broke into it. It just took a little patience and I was able to make perfectly round balls. Like other reviewers I dipped them in melted chocolate, both hersheys milk and hersheys cookies and cream. I rolled them in several different toppings, but the winner hands down was crushed up Score bar. My husband, who isn't into fudge or the likes, couldn't stop eating them!! I'm definitely making them for Christmas!!

These are delicious. I love them and so do my boyfriend and 3 other friends who have tried them so far. I followed the recipe exactly but, as suggested by others, added 2 Tablespoons of heavy whipping cream. The recipe yielded 70 balls just under 1 inch wide before dipped in milk chocolate. I used hershey chocolate chips, semi-sweet for filling, and milk chocolate for dipping, as requested by my sister whom I made them for. On each truffle I sprinkled either chopped walnuts, coconut, or shaved 60% Ghirardelli chocolate. I also made (am making) myself a second batch to take to Thanksgiving, but separated about 1/4 of the filling before flavoring, to which I added 1/2 tsp of orange extract for a delicious orange flavored chocolate. I can't wait till Christmas so I can experiment with more flavors!

These were easy to make, however as far as the flavor goes, I didn't find them very decadent as is.  The truffle was very chocolate-chippy in flavor and almost seemed like fudge.   I did rescue the batch by dividing it in half and mixing orange extract in half and almond extract in the other half then rolling in powdered cocoa, or powdered sugar.  The orange ones I actually dipped in melted Andes candies and that dip became hard -those were very good in texture and flavor.   Overall I give the recipe a 4 for how easy but really only a 2 in taste as is, therefore 3 stars overall.

Milk chocolate doesn't really suit this well, I think. Also, the consistency isn't like any truffles I've ever had. Interesting as a dessert option, but not totally truffle-like...

Creamy, rich, and easy. I used low fat cream cheese and only 2 c of chocolate chips - I only had 1 bag in the house. Used a cookie scooper and didn't roll or coat them in anything. This recipe seriously took like 10-15 minutes from start to licking the bowl.

Excellent!  We loved them.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe.  The mixture was quite dry after chilling in the fridge while covered.  I was afraid it wouldn't form into balls.  It softened enough in my hands to form easily.  No problems with this recipe.

Very creamy. These taste much better than the truffles that are made with heavy cream. Better texture too. This recipe was a bit too sweet for me. I used 2 cups sugar and 2 cups chocolate. Next time I'd like to cut more sugar out and see if it works. It was incredibly fun to make. Use your imagination!  These were yummy but not the best. It was worth makeing and has potential. I think it can be perfected. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were so easy to make and very yummy.  I took them everywhere incuding to the office.  One of my friends said that they are even better than Lindor truffles!

Great recipe - even I could follow it!!Made these on Christmas for my husband who kept eating them! My only problem was rolling them (didn't realize I had to work with them so hard - reminded me of Aggravation Cookies in preparation....) but got the hang of it. This time, though, I think I'll go with the majority of reviewers and cut the sugar and chips, then use milk chocolate instead. They're even better when you dip them in dark chocolate and put a surprise in the middle (nuts, marshmallows, cherries, etc.)

Really disappointed. My husband made these, used 2 flavors & 2 coatings so we could get a good idea for an overall opinion. I don't know, but if we try again there will be some changes. These were ok, but we've had alot better so that is why they only got a 3 rating from us.

These truffles were not only simple to make, but tasted wonderful! I split the recipe into 3 parts before putting in the chocolate and flavorings. I used maple flavoring instead of vanilla for one batch, and rolled these in ground nuts. Another batch was flavored with orange extract and rolled in cocoa, and the last one, I made as the recipe stated. I rolled these in Christmas sprinkles. They all looked beautiful and tasted great! Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

This recipe was great and so easy.  I followed it just as it is written and had no problems.  I varied the flavoring and the chips. I made 3 batches today.  One batch was made with peanut butter chips and dipped in melted chocolate. The next batch was made with white chocolate chips and rolled in crushed oreos. The last batch was made with milk chocolate chips, peppermint oil for flavoring, and rolled in crushed candy canes.  They all tasted great!  I made them for a goodie exchange at work, and I can't wait to give them away. Great recipe! This will become one of my holiday standbys.

I love this recipe (and so do my friends/family)! Rolling them into balls can be quite a mess, but it is worth it if you have the time! My 2 favorite additions are raspberry extract and peppermint oil (not together of course!). I also like to dip them in melted Hershey's dark chocolate after they have been chilled.

Really good. I made three different kinds of truffle with the one recipe. I made vanilla truffles dipped into melted chocolate and then covered with walnuts. I made almond flavoured truffles dipped into melted chocolate then covered with almonds, and then I made rum truffles rolled in powdered cocoa. My brother s liked the vanilla/walnut ones the best.

I did find the truffle mix a bit dry though, it wouldn't stay together unless I heated it up a bit, it didn't stick to my hands much even when heated up a bit.

I will make these again, but they do take patience with all the dipping and covering with various things, it can get very fiddily.

These are super easy and heavenly creamy. I used milk chocolate to coat and the chocolate was chewy. I'll use semi-sweet chocolate next time to have a crunchy shell. Simply delicious.

These are really fantastic and worth the time that they take.  I have make them for bridal showers and baby showers that I have thrown, and they always work beautifully.  One thing that I have tried over time is substituting the semi-sweet chocolate with milk chocolate, and white chocolate.  Also I have used flavoring syrups in place of the vanilla, such as Irish cream, or raspberry.  Kind of a fun recipe to experiment with!

fantastic and wonderfully easy to make, these are perfect as desserts or gifts. I highly suggest using raspberry extract (or other raspberry flavoring) in place of vanilla, it adds wonderful uniqueness to the recipe!

Using semi-sweet provides a more firm truffle, but way rich.  If you are looking for something easier to go around, use milk chocolate.  It firms plenty enough to shape, you just may have to return them to the fridge after rolling.

Definitely spring for a good chocolate for a truly gourmet result.  I used generic chips and got a generic result; nothing to write home about (but it WAS cream cheese and sugar so I couldn't really go too wrong!)  These do offer opportunity for creativity and the result is pleasing to the eye: I rolled mine in cocoa powder, powdered sugar, almonds and hazelnuts.

These were great! But, how safe is it for the truffles to sit out for several days or longer (like a week or more) since there is cream cheese in them? I had mine out a while but didn't get sick.

Easy, delish and beautiful.  THe perfect thing for a cocktail party.  I even forgot to put in the vanilla and they were still fabulous.  I split the recipe and used 1 cp. semi sweet chips and 1/2 cp. cinnamon chips in one batch and for the other batch i used 1 cp semi and 1/2 cp dark chocolate chips.  WONDERFUL!

I made these for my husband for Valentines' day and he couldn't believe that they were homemade. I followed some peoples suggestion of just using 2 cups of the sugar and 2 cups of the chocolate, but next time I will use 3 cups of chocolate as I didn't think they were chocolaty enough. I covered half in milk chocolate with a white chocolate drizzle and did the opposite for the other half. Next time I might also add a bit of Nutella in with the mixture to see how that turns out. These are really good and really easy-great for gifts!

i could not wait to make these. the recipes seems so simple, and delicious, and it is!

  i got all the ingredients last night, and started abotu half hour ago. i reduced the sugar, and chocolate like many said. but i used 1 cup milk chocolate chips, and 1 cup white chocolate chips. and the fillings i split into 3. one is vanilla, one is almond, and one is rum. the fillings taste wonderful themselves, but i stuck the into the fridge for about a half hour before i shape them..then back into the fridge so i can cover with chocolate. im going to cover all in milk chocolate, then drizzle the vanilla with pink/red, the almond ill make it white..and the rum ill do a very dark orange. cant wait to finish them an eat!

  although i wondered if i didnt use the 3 cups sugar and chocolate, would it have any effect on the mixture, almost me too soft like someone said it turned into fudge?! lol..so im hoping it will set nicely in the fridge.

I just made these last night, and could not wait to write a review! I must say these are WONDERFUL!!! I surely will be making these again. I did spend quite a bit of time decorating mine, but you really wouldn't have to. These look and taste like something from a regular chocolate shop! Thank you for such a great recipe!

I rolled half in confectioner's sugar and then I melted 1/2 bag of semi-sweet choclate chips and 1/2 package white candy coating in the crock pot and dipped the rest.  I drizzled more melted white candy coating on top using a baggy with the corner snipped off.

Delicious! I rolled half the finished truffles in chopped peppermint candy cane, and the other half in chopped hazelnuts. They were a hit at the family meal.

I cut the recipe in half, I also covered it with molding chocolate, so that I get a hard chocolate outside and soft inside.

Very good! I made one batch with belgian milk chocolate. I used peppermint oil and rolled in crushed candy canes for one half and for the other half, I added vanilla extract and rolled in chopped almonds. So easy and so good! I'll definitely be making these again. So many different possibilities with this recipe!

I made these for my Christmas goody give aways this year and everyone "loves" them. I made them exactly as suggested. I then made a sugar free batch for the diabetics in my life using splenda (followed the instructions on the splenda site to use like icing sugar) and sugar free chocolate and they turned out great too!!

I didn't actually taste any of the ones I made as I'm 'trying to be good'.  Still, I made 4 different flavours.  One with almond essence covered in almond meal, one with tia maria covered in cocoa, one with vanilla covered in coconut and one with peppermint covered in dark chocolate.  

All in all, I made about 80 of them and everyone at work snapped them up... so I guess they were good!!

I use the same recipe but my family's favorite is when I use white chocolate chips or butterscotch chips.  The texture of these alternatives stays creamier for longer - but no matter what I use these disappear fast.

This is the third year I have used this recipe for truffles.  My whole family (and friends and neighbors) are in love with these.  I have rolled them in powdered sugar, coconut, ground pecans, and sprinkles.  I have also dipped them in milk chocolate and white chocolate - my husband's favorite is the white chocolate dipped.  This is a very simple recipe and versatile, because it can be changed according to your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was so rediculously tedious and I did not find it to be "easy". I made them really small and had a tummy ache after eating just 2 because they were so rich. I will not be trying this again.

My god these are rich! Usually I love rich/dark chocolate but even I can only eat a couple in one sitting. That being said, they're very good! Based on other reviews, I used 2. sugar and 2 c. chocolate in the filling. I rolled some in white chocolate and drizzled with dark, and I rolled some in dark chocolate and drizzled in white.

These are great when you are craving chocolate. I cut back on sugar like others suggested. I also used half peanut butter chips. I coated them in milk chocolate. Thanks for the recipe, its so easy!

This recipe was pretty good-there were only 2 things that I wasn't crazy about. 
1-They start to melt after being out of the frige for 10 minutes
2-They are VERY sweet (even after following others suggestions of 2 c. chocolate, 2 c. sugar instead of 3)
I made coconut ones and to keep them from melting I dipped them in almond bark candy. I froze them before dipping them in the melted candy so they wouldn'd melt while I was doing it. Next time I want to try adding at least 1/2 tsp. salt, and I might even add a whole tsp.

Very easy to make, and a great project for the kids.  I didn't use any extract, and I used the swirled chocolate chips: raspberry/dark chocolate, caramel/milk chocolate, and peanut butter/milk chocolate.  I rolled them in cocoa, confectioners sugar and coconut.  If the coconut doesn't stick well, just put a handful of coconut in your palm and mash it into the truffle.  Then you can reshape it.  Also, if the ganache is too hard to shape after being in the fridge, just leave it out a bit.  It will soften up.  This is a easy, inexpensive truffle recipe that yields a very acceptable result.  Definitely worth a try.

Oh, these we to die for.  I took them to a baby shower and the guest of honor said she couldn't stop eating them.  The only trouble I had was not dividing the batch equally (my fault) and one of them was too sticky.  It made a mess, but it still tasted great!  I made mint, almond and peanut butter (using peanut butter chips as some another reviewer had suggested).

An excellent recipe!  I bought candy melts from Michael's and used them to dip the truffles in or drip on top.  The recipe yields a lot of truffles, which makes it perfect for gift-giving.

I made these as directed with a hand mixer and didn't have one issue.  They came out perfect! I rolled mine in colored non-parels, coconut, and green sugar.  I think the coconut was the best (and stuck the best too).

It was my first time making truffles, and I decided to take a chance with this recipe since so many people liked it.  My end result was a pretty good one!  The taste is pretty good, though the cream cheese makes it kinda cheesecakey flavored.  I made plain (with just vanilla), mint, and peanut butter truffles and rolled some in a cocoa mix, red sugar, and peanuts.  The rest I dipped with milk chocolate and white chocolate.  This recipe is fairly easy, and I will probably do it again if my friends like the truffles.

My family told me that I should open up my own candy shop when they tasted these! I rolled mine in chopped chocolate! My husband had too many for me to count! :) Thanks!

I seem to have had the opposite problem of most people... mine came out crumbly and dry.  When I tried to roll them, they just crumbled.  Toppings would not stick to them.  They had a good flavor, but were very ugly.  I am still looking for the right truffle recipe.

Delicious - rich - kids can help make them, they are so easy! Kids didn't like them rolled in cocoa, too bitter. Maybe try hot chocolate mix? Loved them rolled in non-pareil type sprinkles - very festive.

4 stars...they are a little sugary..cream cheesy... VERY GOOD!! but I'd prefer more chocolate flavor... I followed it...except I forgot the vanilla. I also rolled them into balls before refrigerating. I don't think I could have after refrigeration. 
I will experiment more with this recipe. I will add it to my Christmas candy/fudge/cookie plate tho!! I can't wait to roll it in shaved chocolate.. Or Dip it and let it harden.. I think it will be awesome like that!! :) 
ENJOY!!

This was a great and easy way to make chocolates.  The only problem is that everyone keeps asking me to make more!  
I increased the vanilla which I liked.  I also found that if you can not serve them warm, put them in the microwave for about 20 seconds.  They will literally melt in your mouth.

As a bit of a "purist" I was skeptical of a truffle with "all these" ingredients, but gave i a try - and they're great! Light and creamy filling. I made them withe 2/3 milk 1/3 dark chocolate, and dipped them in dark chocolate to rave reviews from friends. I did have some trouble flavoring them and plan to seek more guidance about that  (the amaretto flavoring was inconsistent - some were flavored, most tasted "plain").

I tried this with banana shnapps..awesome.. just a slight hint of banana but these were awesome.  I only left them in the fridge for about 15 minutes the second time and they were very easy to roll into balls.  I think dipping them in chocolate is the best outside covering.  yummy!!!!!!!!

WOW! I don't know if I have ever had anything this good in my mouth before. My dear husband and I decided to "make" each other's Valentine's gifts this year, so I'm making a couple different kinds of candy.  I decided to scale this recipe down to 20 from 60, and I still got 50.  I did make them smaller, though (nickle size) because I knew they would be rich.  I used several tablespoons of Razzmatazz (I'm not much of a measurer), Ghiradelli chocolate, and an extra ounce of cream cheese.  I was in a big hurry because my husband was due home in an hour and I wanted it to be a surprise, so I chilled the mixture in the freezer for 15 min.  They were a little sticky when I rolled out the balls, but not too bad.  Then I stuck them back in the freezer for 5-10 minutes.  Finally, I used toothpicks to dip them in melted Ghiradelli bittersweet chips and a little paraffin and put them out on wax paper.  So easy, and sooooo good!  Very pretty, too (don't forget the paraffin).

These were good, and everyone ate them, but not as creamy as I expected.  I may try again with a little less chocolate or perhaps add some whipping cream.

Rolling the truffles did make me consider going postal after 30 or so, it gets very tedious.  So enlist some help.

Easy, that's for sure. Decadent, that's another for sure.  I made these for Christmas gifts for my neighbors and they LOVED them.  I'm getting requests for the recipe.  The only thing I changed was cutting the chocolate to 2 cups. I kept everything else the same.  I put in the fridge for about an hour (I did cover them like someone suggested).  They were very easy to roll into balls.  I then rolled the balls in sanding sugar.  They were so beautiful.  I put 3 per paper muffin cup and then put two muffin cups (total of 6 truffles) in a Christmas bag and added some white chocolate coated pretzels that were wrapped in Christmas cellophane.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will make it again and again!

This was a great recipe and the first time I've ever made a truffle! I read everyone's review (thanks!) and cut down on the sugar and the chocolates. The combination I used was melted white chocolate sprinkled w/ toffee, melted chocolate w/ toffee and for the mint truffles, I used melted mix of andes mints & melted semi-sweet chocolate for the base & dipped them in melted semi-sweet chocolate (andes mints don't melt very well) and sprinkled with crushed peppermint candy. When dipping the truffles in melted chocolate, you have to be quick b/c the chocolate truffle will melt into the dipping melted chocolate. I gave these as gifts & I put 2 truffles (of each kind) in a cupcake cover and placed them in a wedding favor mesh bag & voila!

These were delicious, I put them in a pretty tin and gave for Christmas presents. It looks nice if you put 3 in each muffin paper. I used milk chocolate also and used less confec. sugar and it was creamier. I rolled mine in crushed peanuts, coconut, cocoa, sprinkles and confec. sugar. Mmmm...

Very easy to make, time consuming to roll.  I used 2 cups sugar and only chilled for 30 min.  I added more alcohol (2tbsp.+) after dividing into thirds.  I made mint extract rolled in cocoa, Bailey's rolled in vanilla sugar and Grand Marnier rolled in icing sugar.  I will definetly make them again.

I don't know if I was expecting something else, but these were not very good at all.  I followed the recipe without any alterations and rolled some in cocoa and some in powdered sugar.  (Actually I shook them in a plastic bag.)  The cocoa ones were almost inedible, they were so bitter.  I had to try to coat them in sugar afterwards.  I had made these to take to work for holiday presents to coworkers, but they did not go over well.  These were easy, but time consuming.  I will not make them again.

Easy, versitile recipe that got rave reviews!  Could not have been easier to make - a microwave, a mixer and a few mixing bowls is all you need.  I added walnut extract and chopped walnuts to 1/2, and creme de menthe to the other half, rolled them in nuts and crushed candy canes, respectively.  However, like other reviewers, I didn't chill for the full hour before rolling -- 1/2 hour was fine.

Very easy recipe. Elegant tasting and looking truffles. It was fun to add different flavors and outside coatings. Chambord tasted best to me. Wonderful holiday recipe.

I agree that this recipe is easy.  the truffle dough was easy to work with, especially with a melon baller.  I found the taste and texture very ordinary though.  They tasted like chocolate chips, and lacked that nice creamy richness that I espected from truffles.  I thought that the cream cheese might do it, but it didn't

These are very good.  I did half with vanilla (rolled in powdered sugar) and half with coffee liqueur (rolled in cocoa) and both are excellant.  I agree that they are just a bit dry and next time I wouldn't add quite as much sugar.  So, so, so easy--it's almost embarassing.

Very very easy and pretty tasty.  My family loved them, but I felt like they were missing something.  Next time I will try adding Kahlua or Irish cream.  Maybe rolling in a crushed candy like Butterfingers would be good

I used 2 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 3 cups and it still tastes great!  It hardened faster than I expected though, so I would probably chill it for less than an hour next time.

Hello,

I tried this recipe and I am giving it 4 stars "only" because it was way too sweet for my taste.  Tonight I am going to make some more and try 1 less cup of conf. sugar.  Other than that, these were such a success!  If you can beleive this, I could not find a melon baller anywhere, at anystore so I used a measuring spoon and rolled them with my hands.  The next time, before I do the second dip into the chocolate I am going to put the balls into the fridge so that they are a little harder.  The soft balls has holes from my dipping fork.  Plus the ones that I refrigerated seemed to take the chocolate coating better.  I used orange oil to give these a flavor that I enjoy.  I just want to say, "MMM..,mmm...!"

This Recipe Is perfect for any Christmas Basket or a Delectable dessert for a Romantic Night for 2. Truffles with Wine or Champagne. I dipped my Truffles in Melted chocolate instead of rolling them in Sprinkles or nuts.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it is probably the only candy recipe that turned out exactly as it claimed for me. It made exactly 60 truffles, they were easy, and the taste was like something from a gourmet candy shop. The only thing is that the longer they sit, they do tend to dry out as any candy, but still very impressive! I used the vanilla to flavor them and they were great. I rolled half of them in ground walnuts and half in a mixture of ground almonds and Christmas sprinkles. Everyone loved them and they were pleasing to the eye as well.

These were very simple and delish.  The only change:  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Note:  in previous review, I thought by using icing sugar instead of confectioner's sugar was the wrong thing to do.  It turns out they are one and the same!

This recipe was very easy and turned out great looking and tasting truffels.  I added a bit more of the liquor flavoring than the recipe required and they did not need the 1 hour of refrigeration (only about 30 mins).  These made for great gifts and looked very elegant.  I liked the ones rolled in walnuts best (both look and taste wise).

Made these for my husband and older kids for V-day. Good feedback and fun to make. 
I kind of used the kitchen sink recipe: I had about 2.5-3 cups of chocolate (I used semi-sweet, dark and milk combined) 6 ounces of cream cheese so I winged it. (I used 1.5 c. of powdered sugar to match the other reduced amounts) 
They came out awesome. Great recipe and easy to decorate for impressive results. I'll make these again for shizz.

I loved this recipe and the chocolate just melted in my mouth. I rolled them in cocoa powder, icing sugar, and coconut flakes. I followed other people’s instructions and cut the recipe in half. Definitely making these for Christmas!

I coated them in chocolate. They are almost too sweet to eat.
I'll make them again, minus the chocolate coating.

I do agree that they are very sweet, but it balances out nicely if you just coat them in a decent layer of cocoa powder :) delicious recipe!!! Will make again.

These were really tasty and and impressive for guests! I made one batch with Kahlua and preferred that taste over the ones without. I had one caution however: this recipe has uncooked cream cheese it, and so I stored my truffles in the refrigerator and only removed them for a bit before serving to soften. I would NOT store these at room temperature. Enjoy!

Read a review about dipping them in almond bark chocolate, I'll have to try that! I did a trial batch, cutting the recipe in a quarter, and cut the sugar to 1/3 of a cup, and oh yes this is a winner!!!

Worst AllRecipes recipe I've ever made. The consistency was awful! Don't even think about using a melon baller or ice cream scoop! Even after refrigerating, the batter was dry and didn't hold together without really REALLY rolling the balls around in my palms. None of the toppings (finely ground walnuts, turbinado sugar/kosher salt, cocoa) would stick easily. Toppings had to forcefully be pressed into the balls. When I dipped a few into melted white candy coating, the balls just crumbled. VERY FRUSTRATING recipe. The last straw was when my husband ate one and made no comment. His look of confused disgust said it all. I'm considering just dumping these in the trash. Waste of time and money!

I followed the recipe exactly.  However, I still had to remake this recipe for 3 reasons.  First when the chocolate was fully melted in my double boiler I added the vanilla, WRONG!!  The chocolate seized immediately, I had to add 1/4 stick of melted butter to get it unseized.  Second, my hand mixer broke halfway thru mixing the chocolate in so I finished by hand.  My arm paid the price! Third I refrigerated it overnight, making it impossible to mold into anything but chocolate shavings.  

So, first of all have a stand mixer.  I finally broke down and got a kitchen aid.  Make sure to sift your powdered sugar. Next, DO NOT ADD YOUR VANILLA TO YOUR MELTED CHOCOLATE, add it to your cream cheese/sugar mixture before you add the chocolate.  Last of all, do not refrigerate more than 1 hour.

I decided to put each ball in a mini cupcake holder and instead of completely coating with dark or semi sweet or milk chocolate then decorating, I simply spooned some over the top of the truffle and decorated in the cups.

They turned out perfectly melt away truffles!

Happy candy making!

Very thick- hard to stir the chocolate in. Better add flavoring to the cream cheese and powdered sugar mix or it won’t blend well.

This is a revision to my first review.  First ones I made were by the recipe exactly, no changes, my husband gave them a 5 but to me they were a little on the bitter side even with rolling them in coconut and sprinkles. I decided to make more with milk chocolate chips. I was going to do exactly half milk chocolate chips and half semi sweet but I was a little short, I had enough to use 1-1/3 cup semi sweet and 1-2/3 cup milk chocolate. I dipped some in chocolate candiquick and some in vanilla almond bark, these are really good and have a better melt in your mouth quality, they are sweeter but not too sweet. My husband tried one and wanted more and said he likes the second ones much better than the first. I am very glad I found this recipe it is a good base for me to start with for experimenting and personalizing for my families taste. I have made fudge and other candies for years but had never tried Truffles and really had no idea where to begin. Thank you for the recipe.

I made the change of splitting the main part of the recipe in half before adding in the vanilla. I put only one teaspoon of vanilla in one half, and one teaspoon of orange extract in the other half before I refrigerated both halves. The truffles did indeed come out tasting decadent still, and even after coating both in dark chocolate shells, they still had the flavor of the extracts. I'll definitely make these again!

FANTASTIC!! I dipped these in Bakers dipping chocolate, decorated with nuts, icing, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and icing writing, and they made a nice gift. I also made them at Christmas and included in my cookie tins to family members. My husband and teenage daughter can’t get enough of them! They are so easy, nice for a display, and really, really good.

I made it exactly as written. But after mixing it, I divided the mixture between two bowls. I left one bowl as is and the second bowl I added 1/4 cup of instant coffee granules. Both were great.

A batch made me 40 nice size truffles, I used a cookie dough scoop to make an even size. I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 C and used half milk chocolate and half semi sweet. I added 2 tbsp cream to help even out the mixture. Make sure mixture is well chilled before rolling and freeze truffles before you dip them in anything. Easier than I thought it would be! I made 2 batches for Mother's Day gifts and every one gave fantastic reviews.

I used 8 oz cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, 3 cups of baking chips, and 1 1/2 tsp flavoring. We liked them! I dipped them in Candi-quik dipping chocolate after freezing them.

The truffles are amazing and I think they will be a hit at my Christmas Eve party. I recommend sea salt as a topping. The sea salt balances the sweetness of the chocolate. Another good idea is to tuck a couple of pieces of sea salt in the centre of the truffle.

My family loved these!!!!   They were quite sweet though.   I stuck with the recipe for the most part.  I separated the batter and added some peppermint to some and rolled each one in crushed candy canes.  These tasted good, but didn’t hold up so well because the crushed candy cane got gooey.  I also added rum flavor to some and rolled in coconut.  Yum!!!!

After I divided and flavored, stored in fridge till I could decorate, etc. Flavor was terrific. Easy to work with, dipped some, so would recommend shaping, then put back into refrigerator, to stiffen BEFORE dipping into warm chocolate.

I made these exactly as stated.  They were too sweet and tasted a lot like soft chocolate chips.  Despite being so easy, which regular truffles are anyway, I was hugely disappointed.  A ganache-like truffle is easy and delicious.  I'll stick to the tried-and-true next time.  A brigadeiro is excellent, too, for a more fudgy ball.

Made these twice.  Hubby has named them "dope balls", because he says they are as addicting as dope.  (No, he does not do dope .....lol). 

They are easy to make, keep fresh for a long time and taste delicious.  A big, big hit.

I followed the suggestions by the others to reduce the amount of confectioners sugar and chocolate chips to 2 cups each. The only issue I had was coating them with items other than powder - nothing else really seemed to want to stick. I also found I had to let the batch sit a bit before being able to roll into balls as it was too hard. But other than that very happy.

AMAZING recipe! The only change I made was to add both vanilla & almond extracts. What a great flavor!  I used dark chocolate for the coating, rolled them in ground peanuts and yum! The next batch is going to be with semi-sweet chocolate, and the batch after that will be with  white chocolate coating rolled in coconut. I am excited to try those out!

The only good thing about this recipe was that it was easy. I bought high quality ingredients, followed the recipe exactly and ended up with overly sweet, crumbly balls that looked unappetizing and were way too sweet to eat. I threw them all away and ended up buying truffles at Whole Foods. Waste of time and money. If you make this recipe, read all the reviews and DEFINITELY do not use all the sugar that they call for. I would recommend finding another recipe, even if it is a bit more work.

I rarely write a negative review, but these are inedible as written. I love truffles and rich decadent desserts. These things, however, are so sugary that it's like biting into a ball of powdered sugar. Even my kids wouldn't eat more than one, and that's saying a lot. The texture isn't like a truffle at all either. I ended up just throwing them away. I kept looking for a good recipe, and found one by Ina Garten that is a ganache - primarily chocolate and heavy cream with some added flavors. SO MUCH BETTER, and more of a melt in your mouth truffle like Lindt.

Really easy and yummy! Changed by reducing the sugar to 2 cups, adding 1/2 cup whipping cream, eliminating the vanilla, and then dividing it in 3 parts for flavorings. I used 2 Tbsp of each liqueur in each: 
- Gran Marnier (rolled in Mochaccino mix)
- Raspberry Rum (rolled in desicated coconut)
- Chocolate Almond  (rolled in crushed almonds)
Will definitely make these again!

I made just a half recipe, and added cashew butter.  I crushed up some crackers, added a dab of cinnamon and cayenne pepper  to them, and rolled the truffles in that mixture. I thought they tasted great! I did store them in the fridge (because of the cream cheese) and took them out  15 minutes before eating to let them warm up a bit.

I had no problem with the candy being too soft to roll into balls. Very easy to make and fun to try different flavors. Coconut and rolled in the coconut surprised me with how good they were. Mint, dipped in chocolate and coffee with a surprise  chocolate covered coffee bean and rolled in mocha drink mix were my choices. So pretty and so good! This is a keeper!

Very easy, and it hardens perfectly for rolling into truffles. I thought the semi sweet chocolate chips made it a touch too sweet (kinda came out Hershey chocolate bar sweet). Next batch I will use half bittersweet chocolate and see if it comes out better. Very easy truffles though, love them and going to make them again.

I made the recipe for the first time exactly as it was written.  We found the balls to be dry and not easy to handle when making the balls.  Will look for a different recipe in the future.

I read several reviews and debated changing the recipe like others to 2 cups of powdered sugar. But, I decided to stick with the recipe. These are rich, yummy little morsels! I refrigerated the batter for a few hours. Melted milk and semisweet chocolate, used a toothpick, twirled these little gems in the melted chocolate, then sprinkle with multiple colored sugars and sprinkles. So many options, it's endless

I love these! They're a huge hit at my house. My family just raves about them! I add 1-2 Tbsp. cream (towards the end of mixing the cream cheese) per half batch. It gives them a wonderful taste and melt-in-your-mouth kind of texture, but it does seem to make them less firm and harder to work with. I've also tried them with semi-sweet chocolate chips (as the recipes states), with the 2 C milk chocolate chips & 2 C sugar that other reviewers' have suggested, and with 2 C milk chocolate chips and the same amount of sugar that the recipe calls for. Even though I usually don't like semisweet chocolate, I preferred the recipe as stated because it tastes more like a "true", rich truffle and it firmed up better. My dad preferred the milk chocolate/same sugar mix, and my sister the milk chocolate/less sugar mix. Go figure! I roll them in almond bark like another reviewer suggested, and this way they keep their shape. It makes them taste a little more like a candy and less like a truffle, but it is still so good that I don't care. I'm going to try it with regular melted chocolate topping next. Overall, definitely a keeper!

This is definitely a 5 for ease and would be a fantastic project for kids to make edible gifts. But I find the end result too sweet. The recipe makes an immense quantity of basic truffle material. This is what I did with mine:
(1) Flavor with Grand Marnier and roll in demarara sugar moistened with more Grand Marnier
(2) Flavor with rum and mix in coconut, roll in coconut moistened with more rum
(3) Flavor with whiskey, roll in a mixture of crisp crumbled bacon and sea salt.

its hard to dip in chocolate and not easy to prepare after cream cheese is mixed.  Constant back and forth into fridge and cooling the mixture, very hard to keep up when you are trying to make a batch and be done.

They are great! They are so rich though so I can only have one at a time. I've seen at my local store truffles and they've had another coating which was cocoa powder. So to compensate for the sweetness I roll each truffle/ball in unsweetened cocoa powder. And it looks fancy too! So easy to make, thank you!

We've made these quite a few times over the years. We have added liquors to the mix . I.e. Kahlua, Chambord, etc. We enjoyed rolling the Kahlua ones with a filbert nut in the center. We've also changed out the chocolate -shout out to my then 9 year old-for Ande's mints and made scrumptious mint ones. These have become a favorite of many family and friends.

This was my first time making truffles, and I was happy with how they turned out. I did the recipe in thirds - one third I used vanilla extract, one with peppermint, and one with orange. The orange was my personal favorite, but all were delicious. This recipe is very versatile, I can think of almost endless possibilities for flavors and coatings. I will definitely be experimenting with this in the future!

This recipe is great! My sister made truffles one year and I decided to kick off my winter baking by making a batch of them myself this year. I was so happy with how this recipe turned out. It was super easy to make and the truffles are delicious! I don't like semi-sweet truffles all that much, so I did use milk chocolate chips instead, and then coated them in cocoa and confectioners sugar. They are delicious! I will definitely be making these again!

My family and I always make the same Christmas candy every year.  This year I found a few new ones to try out.  This one is a KEEPER!  So yummy.  I even rolled a few in tiny heath pieces.

So easy! I used 2 cups each of the confectioners sugar and melted chocolate, per other reviews. Turned out awesome! I dipped mine in chocolate, white chocolate, coconut, powdered sugar, and cocoa powder. My yield was less than 60, so I must have made mine too big. Totally recommend this recipe!

these are so good! for people who can't stand a bunch of sugar these are not for you unless you make them small and roll them in cocoa powder. they are even better if you leave them in the fridge all day but still good even melted, which unfortunately is very easy to do.

Thank-you so much for sharing this delicious, simple and quick truffle recipe. I promised my 7yr old we would make truffles today and I was dreading it all morning, I was delighted to find an all recipes video based on this recipe. We decided to take the advice from numerous others and re-dipped the truffles in the extra melted chocolate which was left over after we measured three cups. I do have some advice, my truffles were very large and way too rich for what I enjoy but, my daughter made small ones formed with her tiny hands and they were the perfect portion size for the extreme sweet

It is a very simple, easy, last minute recipe that Is rich and wonderful. It is very very chocolate and rich. I added 2.5 cups of confectioners sugar and it made it less sweet and more enjoyable. Overall I think this is a wonderfull recipe idea.

Super easy and very tasty.  I tried rolling them in powered sugar, cocoa powder and a mix of both, but it is all a matter of taste.  They do get a little sticky if they warm up too much.

These were a massive hit.  Flavored them with a variety of flavors - orange, coffee, mint, and vanilla and then coated them in chocolate.  They were great.  Personally, they were too rich for me and so for the second batch I replaced some of the semi-sweet chocolate with milk chocolate and cut a bit back on the sugar.  But anyone who likes dark chocolate will probably love as is, the dark chocolate fans in my family loved them.

For the Super Bowl, I shape the truffles into little footballs, use the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe and pipe on details.  Set them in coconut colored with food coloring!  They're always a big hit!

I followed recomendations of previous reviewers and used 2 cups sugar and 2 cups chocolate. I used lindt 63% chocolate and they were very rich and decadent. I double dipped some in sweet German chocolate, rolled some in pistachio meal that I buzzed up in the food processor, and the rest in a combination of dutch cocoa powder combined with a bit of espresso powder. My favourite was the cocoa/espresso. But these were easy to make and a smash with my guests. Next time I'm going to try rolling around dried cherries and toasted hazelnuts.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I made three versions: rum/black jimmies, bailey's/chopped Andes candies, & amaretto/small pieces of pecans. My husband is the taste tester and ALL he could say is yummy :) these will be a part of the Christmas presents to give to our friends along with other baked goods.

Amazing recipe!! This is my new Christmas tradition. My first batch I did by the recipe without alcohol. I used chocolate wafers (the kind you use for chocolate making), and a double boiler to melt them. They came out so good I made 3 more batches, and this time I used alcohol. One batch I used about 4 oz. Irish Cream (I used St. Brendan's), I had to add about 1 cup more confectioner's sugar to get it to the right consistency. The second batch I used 4 oz. Raspberry Liqueur (I used Di Amore), and again had to add about 1 cup extra confectioner's sugar. The last batch I used 2 oz. of Cointreau which is a orange flavored liqueur, and used about 1/2 cup extra confectioner's sugar. Most of the truffles I dipped in chocolate. I froze the truffles (after I made them into balls)for a couple hours (or overnight), then dipped in melted chocolate. Yum!!

They were good and easy but, the dough itself is very much like a chocolate frosting.  Does not need the recommended time to sit in the refrigerator, if you leave it in that long it will become rock hard. My guests liked these but they like the oreo truffles so much better.

This recipe was delicious, but very, very sweet. Next time I will cut the sugar. Also, after refrigerating, it was very clumpy, so I put it back in the mixer for a few seconds to smooth it out-made a huge difference. I rolled my truffles in a mixture of coffee and cocoa-the bitterness with the sweetness was very good.

I followed this recipe step by step and. It was perfect I don't usually write reviews especially when there are so many already. The only thing I didn't know, as I have never made a pie or tart before, (I made tarts) is how to know when they were done and how full to fill the tart shells :s I made them tooooo full ??thank you for this recipe it is honestly the perfect pecan filling I have ever tasted!!

I scaled down the recipe and found that the chocolate was really thick and upon refrigeration, went very hard.  I just microwaved it for a few seconds and come to find out, it being hard made it easier to work with.  I added peppermint extract and rolled the balls in red, green and silver crunchy sugar.  They were delicious and I'd like to experiment with different extract flavors and toppings.

I made this recipe exactly as is and a second batch substituting peppermint extract instead of the vanilla.  I rolled the vanilla batch in crushed almonds and sea salt and the peppermint batch in crushed candy canes.  I used a melon ball scoop to get out the chocolate and then rolled them by hand.  I left in them covered in the fridge for 2 days before delivering them as Christmas goodies to my co-workers.  I got a TON of compliments on them at work (even from a colleague that used to run her own catering business).  I would definitely make these again (especially with so many tempting combinations to try out!)

Great recipe. Based on other cooks' recommendations, I reduced sugar to 2 cups, and for chocolate used 2 cups of chips + 2 oz. of dark chocolate. Refrigerated mixture overnight. Made two batches, each yielding about 4 dozen gumball-sized truffles (any smaller seemed skimpy): one batch had vanilla, the other real peppermint extract. For "regular" batch, rolled them in powdered sugar, cocoa, or  shredded sweetened coconut. For mint batch, rolled in festive peppermint sugar or drizzled with melted white chocolate. Five versions in all...perfect in mini cupcake papers nestled in holiday tins for a lovely homemade gift!

This is a great recipe! I didn't change a thing and they came out amazing. They are so super easy to make. I think just about anyone can make these truffles if they have the ingredients on hand. I made half the batch and I regret it because while I was making these my brother and sister kept coming by, sneakingly picking some up, stuffing them in their mouth and walking away like nothing happened. Needless to say I was unable to give these out to anyone as food gifts because they finished fast so now I have to run to the store to go get more chocolate so I can make a second batch. Great recipe!

Made these today but had to make a couple of changes.  First, I didnt have chocolate chips, but I did have a HUGE bag of Vanilla chips, so I used those.  Split into 3 even batches.  Batch 1, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract.  Batch 2 I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa.  Batch 3 I added 2 tablespoons cocoa and 1 teaspoon Peppermint extract.
I coated all three batches in Confectioners Sugar, then had my Husband and Mother-in-law (Who had never had truffles) sample them.  My Mother-in-law enjoyed them (though she did complain that they were too rich), and my husband said he'd rather have these truffles then the ones that I pay $3-$5 a piece for.  As for me, I LOVED these truffles.  
Also, all together the recipe made 3 dozen truffles, though I made them with about 1 tablespoon of mix, making each ball about 1 1/2 inches circumference.

These are a HUGE hit with my family and friends. The recipe is easy and the end product is a very good quality. I did increase the amount of flavoring to get a stronger effect, but other than that, I left it alone.

I loved these - followed the recipe to the T and they turned out wonderfully. I had no problems with the consistency - once I rolled them in sprinkles, sugar, or cocoa and let them set on a wire rack, they were perfect - moist on the inside but firm on the outside so as not to make a mess. Everyone who tried them loved them, they are so rich and really just the perfect dessert.

These really do melt in your mouth... super rich and delicious... I did learn some valuable lessons from making these though... first do not use nestle chocolate chips for anything that involves melting they just clump up on you... I had to add milk to get it to a smooth consistency... this may have thinned it down and part of the reason the "batter" didn't firm up the greatest in the fridge.... also if you plan to dip them in melted chocolate be sure to shape into balls and freeze for an hour or so before dipping... great recipe would have been so much easier if I didn't have the problems with the chocolate chips... thanks for submitting

Very easy to make and adaptable.  Smooth, and rich flavor.  I flavored the truffles with ice wine, and later dipped the formed and chilled truffles in a good quality dark chocolate.  The results?  Move over Godiva!

Super easy! I use chocolate and white chocolate almond bark instead of the chocolate chips and it works out wonderfully! I make them all the time for weddings, valentine's day and other events!! I have even used rum extract (for adults) and they were amazing as well. Also freeze great too!!

I made this with the modification of one reviewer.I used two cups sugar and two cups semi sweet chocolate chips. I melted almond chocolate brick and dipped them in it, after they hardened up. They are good but defiantly more like fudge. I wonder if whipping some heavy cream and adding it to the mix would make them a little more lighter? They just seemed really dense to me.

This recipe lives up to it's name! I delivered these as Christmas gifts and before I got home people were calling asking for the recipe.  They are easy and delicious.  I used kaluah, toasted cocount and toasted pecans.

So easy to make, and the results are amazing!  I made dozens of these during the Christmas season and gave them to my children's teacher's, school staff, the mailman and so on.  (All the people you would like to recognize during Christmas, but can't quite afford to shop for)  Everyone raved that I should open a business :)  They really did turn out quite amazing, but I think it's all because I had a GREAT recipe to work from :)

Definitely follow other reviewers and reduce the confectioners sugar and semisweet chocolate to two cups each. It does turn out very smooth and yummy, but it is such a hassle to shape (is both crumbly and sticky at the same time?!)... and dip the truffles nicely that I'm quite doubtful I'll make them again. I spent half the day making half the recipe! I suppose if you have lots of time it'll be a fun activity...

I made the mistake of coating all of mine with a layer of chocolate so they would have the hard shell look. They turned out gorgeous but added to the time it took to make them. I made vanilla white chocolate, bailey's, mint and amaretto truffles and they were all a hit

I made these for our annual cookie exchange at work. The girls (and hubbies) just loved them and everyone asked for the recipe.  There are endless combinations of flavors and toppings --  be creative and have fun with this great recipe.

These were very good. the whole family enjoyed them and my daughter and I had fun rolling them. I made the recipe exact and we had absolutely no problems rolling them. They did not even stick to our hands.  I don't understand why people had such a hard time with them. Maybe because they altered the original recipe. They are very rich so you can only eat one or two...Will definitely make agin and next time will try to flavor them.

My family loved these and I think the cream cheese was an awesome addition to them. We topped ours with white chocolate, crushed pecans, powdered sugar, toasted cocnut and crushed up Butterfinger bars (those were AMAZING!) The only complaint I have is how long it takes to roll them all but it is so worth it when you see how many gorgeous truffles you have made. Thanks for sharing and this one stays in the box for sure!

Turned out great!  Added about a tsp of orange zest to add more flavor and rolled in cocoa powder, hazelnuts and powdered sugar.  Would also be good with some instant coffee added or grand marnier!  Can't wait to give them to my neighbors!

My supervisor made these in the past and I tried it for the first time this year. I substituted liquid Hazel Nut Creamer for the vanilla and rolled in a combination of sugar and powedered Hazel Nut Creamer. My boyfriend just loved them. Hint on rolling...I used disposable latex gloves and it helped keep them from sticking to my hands as much.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if I was rating it just on the flavor. However, as easy as it was to mix up the sugar, chocolate, and cream cheese, separating the chocolate mixture to add the flavors was a pain.  The dough was a good consistency but after adding the liqueurs or vanilla, it became very gritty and mushy.  I put it in the fridge overnight and then rolled them into balls the following day.  It took almost an hour for the mixture to soften up, and even then it was too hard to roll, so I ended up putting it in the microwave for 8-10 seconds- at that point, it was much more manageable.  After I finally rolled them, I put them back in the fridge overnight to harden them until I could dip them in chocolate the next day.  I ended up rolling some in nuts, and the others just drizzled white chocolate over.    The truffles turned out nice in the end, but getting there took a long, messy time.

These were so much fun to make that I don't even care if they're delicious or not (which they are). My friend came over and we had such a good time experimenting with flavors and "coverings" that we probably ate as many as we saved. We used a tablespoon of flavoring for each and my favorite was the Chambord liquor. I'm looking forward to serving them at an upcoming Christmas party.

I am a very new cook :) I tried this, firstly I had to put the mix in the freezer for a little only then it hardened and I was able to roll it. I used chocolate chunks to melt, but I could not get the consistency correct, it was not dripping so when i tried dipping the truffles it did not come out smooth, the chocolate just gunk up.

These Truffles live up to there name. I felt one hour in the refrigerator was too long, made them hard to roll. I had no problem rolling them as soon as I finished putting the ingrediants together but had trouble getting anything but powdered sugar to stick to them.

I really liked this recipe.  I made some with peanut butter chip and some with chocolate chips.  Coated each one in either crushed almonds, coconut, cocoa, or powdered sugar.  Tasted AWESOME!

I was pumped to make these but wasn't amazed. The taste is just ok (made exactly as written) and it's more work than I was expecting. I had a little chocolate leftover so I dipped a few truffles...it was such a mess and not very attractive. Kudos to those who made all the pretty truffles! Looks I'll be buying mine in the future.

these did not meet my expectation..it's probably because i used white chocolate thinking that because of the cream cheese in the recipe it could kind of like cheesecake truffles or something like that.i still give it 4 stars since i really did not stick to the recipe and i'll be trying to make it again with choco chips........bdw,using the white chocolate was pretty good after i added lemon extract to it.

Go to your local craft store and buy the new Wilton brownie toppings. These are already ground and are the right size for rolling the truffles. I used turtle crunch and baby blue dusting powder for my grandson's first birthday. They have many flavors and if you catch them on sale, they are about 3 bucks for a large jar.

YUMMY!  i must say that these taste much better after sitting in the refrigerator over night.  otherwise, they taste more like fudge because the consistency is too soft.  truly delightful.

These are super good with the advice of the other reviewers' suggestions.  I cut the chocolate chips and confectioner's sugar to 2c.  I also dipped the truffles in dark and milk chocolate and drizzled more chocolate over them for decoration.  These are a chocoholic's delight!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and these truffles were a huge success. I was shocked at how easy they were to make.  I rolled them in cinnamon, powdered sugar, and dipped some in dark chocolate and they all were wonderful!

I can't believe how easy these were! I made a variety of flavors: vanilla, rum, raspberry, orange, peppermint, and almond. I also put the rolled balls into melted Almond Bark which really made them wonderfully decadent. I mixed in some crushed almonds into some of them and put a halved almond on top of some. I also drizzled the vanilla flavored Almond Bark onto the raspberry ones and they were really good. I'm still amazed that they were so easy and look so beautiful when done. I gave them out as Christmas gifts and everyone thought they came from a specialty store. Great recipe!

WOW!!!  These are delicious!  I made two batches - one with melted white chocolate and one with melted semi-sweet chocolate and split each batch into thirds.  With the white chocolate I made lemon, cherry, and strawberry truffles (dipped in more white chocolate of course) and with the semi-sweet chocolate I made mint, coconut, and orange (also dipped in additional semi-sweet chocolate).  They look gorgeous and taste even better!  These will be a hit at my family's Christmases on Saturday and again on Sunday.  My husband voted to keep all of them for ourselves, but I don't feel like weighing 200 pounds by the end of the weekend!  Thank you for sharing!

Very yummy!  I had unsweetened chocolate squares and used them instead of semi-sweet and they were very good.  Probably not as sweet but still very yummy.  I dipped them all in different types of chocolate as well.  White, dark, dark with mint extract and milk chocolate.  Once again, very yummy!  My kids call them chocolate bombs!

These are super good and hit the spot when you just need a little blast of sweetness on Christmas Eve. I made them and they were such a hit! But if you freeze them for about an hour and then cover them in chocolate and maybe roll them in almonds or sugar, they are absolutely delicious and great to look at.

This recipe was delicious, and the actual preparation and mixing was fast and easy, but we found them hard to roll. Next time we'll put them in the fridge more often, and again between rolling and coating. Other than that, very yummy!

I love these truffles. I've been making them for a while now. 

I use milk chocolate chips as they are much creamier in the mixture.

My family regularly asks me to make truffles. I've made so many different kinds now, I'm always looking for new and fun ways to make them.

Very rich and delicious! This recipe makes a lot. I found that chilling it for about 30 min before rolling them made the mixture easier to work with. I made them for Valentine's day and Easter. My husband always asks for them.

This recipe WINS. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I've never made other truffles and can't compare. I had never made candy, but my girlfriend and I were able to do this easily. Then this week I used the recipe again and was able to pull it off decently myself. (I recommend having help, though). So far I've made plain ones, rum-flavored, and mint. Whenever I give these to people and tell them that I made them, they're AMAZED.

So yummy! Rich, delicious, and so hard to mess up! My truffle dough kept getting dry and hard, so I had to nuke it a few times, but they still turned out scrumptious.

I made this recipe as specified and they turned out wonderful. I also played around with them a bit making orange chocolate truffles, white chocolate cherry truffles, peanut butter truffles, banana truffles, cinnamon truffles. I dipped some in coconut, some in cocoa, some in melted milk chocolate, some in melted white chocolate, some topped with pecans, almonds, sprinkles, and colored sugar. Everyone who tried them LOVED them! I had to make 2 batches because everyone wanted some to take home. These are VERY rich and very decadent and I will make them for gifts next Christmas. They were much better than some I'd gotten from the store as a gift this year. This recipe was wonderful!

These were really yummy - I doubled the recipe and made all sorts of flavors.
Hazelnut, chocolate liquer, white chocolate, coffee, etc.  The only thing I did not like about this recipe was rolling 120 truffles !

This is my 1st ever review and these are absolutely greatt!! Though I onli used 2 cups of sugar (3 cups seems too much). My boyfriend loves them! So does his family and friends! They cant get enuff of it. I dipped them all in chocolate, then topped with 3 different toppings; powdered sugar, chopped almonds and crushed oreo cookies. Sooo simple...Would make it again!

These were very good for being so easy. I used the suggestions of another reviewer and added some heavy whipping cream and several ounces of bittersweet baker's chocolate. We divided into thirds, keeping one plain, mixing brewed espresso into another, and using raspberries (bought frozen, then microwaved and crushed) into the third. All were delicious, but the two with add-ins (though they had the perfect blend of tastes) were very gloppy. Dipped in ganache and frozen they were still a bit messy, but usable. No one seemed to mind at all- rave reviews!

So good!  Thanks for the additional ideas on the reviews--I did 2 cups chips and 2 cups sugar as well.  It must depend on the temperature in the kitchen, but mine were setting up after being in the fridge for just 10 minutes, and I used my cookie scoop to shape them which worked great.  I rolled some in crushed Heath bar which we loved.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!!

Will make again and try adding rum flavoring and maybe almond and orange.

Good recipe as is.  I may try some of the tweaks others have suggested.  These were easy to make, quite good (just looking for something slightly more creamy and smooth), and fun to roll out. The kids would have fun rolling them in garnishes. Thanks.

I have made these several times and everyone LOVES them. I also roll them in at least 6 differnet things when I make them so there is a variety for people to chose from. I usually do Walnuts, some form of sprinkles, confections sugar, coco powder, coconut, and some otehr kind of nut, depending on what we have in the house at the time.

I followed rec exactly and it worked out great. Used toothpick for covering with chocolate.  Pretty good. Next time I will use different types of liquers instead of vanilla to boost the flavor.

These are really easy! My electric mixer was broken so I had to mix it by hand. In my 'trial' of the recipe- it was for a gift- I added all of the chocolate at once and it became lumpy. So from then on I added the chocolate in about 3 lots. After reading the reviews about how sweet people thought it was I decided to cut the sugar to 2 cups, and even though I am a chocolate addict and eat waaaaaay too much sugar- it was still very sweet for me. I think if you use a milk or white chocolate (like I did) you hardly need any- only enough to help soften the cheese. I used coconut, pepermint and a Bailey's flavour, and found that the longer before it was eaten the more the flavours intensified, so you might want to keep that in mind.

I loved these!! They came out beautifully and they tasted amazing!!They were messy to roll into balls but they were worth it. then I dipped them in confectioned powder. They are great for the holidays!! I do not like cream cheese but they turned out amazing. I made half of them dark choc and half vanilla i liked both. they even smelled like cream cheese if you do not like crem cheese do not stop when it starts smelling like them keep on going! they barley leave a trace of cream cheese! These are a absolute you have to make these!

These were pretty good, I split mine into 4 different kinds; raspberry, orange, coffe, & just chocolate. For the raspberry I cut the recipe in half, and used Raspberry chocolate chips, no flavoring required! Orange I used orange extract, Coffee I used some pretty strong instant coffee. YUM!! I'm still searching for the perfect truffle recipe tho....

I just made these for my christmas cookie boxes I make every year.  I always choose 6 different types of cookies/chocolate and this was one of my choices.

Very easy to make, very simple ingredients and very good.

I doubled the recipe and dipped half in icing sugar and the other half in cocoa.

These are so good, but very rich.  I thought the texture seemed more like fudge.  They were very easy to make, and a huge hit with my family.

It was like eating a glob of chocolate frosting.  Also, it was hard to work with b/c it softened quickly.

This was a big hit at my friends wedding....I did three varieties.  The way the recipe was written and then an orange version and a raspberry version.  Everyone loved them.

I used this recipe to make truffles for the first time. They turned out really good, they were all gone within 2 days! I did find the balls very hard to roll after letting cool in the fridge 1 hr, maybe I will try 30 min next time. Also the coconut I was using to roll them in wouldn't stick very well. I made half of them with the vanilla extract and the other half with rum extract. Both very good but I preferred the rum extract. Will make again.

This was okay.  It just tasted like regular chocolate.  It didn't have that rich, smooth flavor I was hoping cream cheese would do.

Wonderful!  I made these for Valentines Day and everyone loved them.  I also reduced the powdered sugar and chocolate chips to 2 cups each.  I made 3 batches and they disappeared quickly!  Will definitely make again!

these were good. definetely decadent. looking at other reviews i reduced the cc to 2 1/2 cups. it wasn't as creamy as i expected to be, and it was much more cheese flavored than i wanted it to be. it was WAY too sweet and i already reduced the sugar. i mixed in praline i made with hazelnuts and covered with a coat of 50% cocoa dark chocolate. turned out too sweet, but still good when eaten in little amounts.

These were way rich and one dimensional in flavor to me. They are very creamy. I made them to give to some friends for Valentines day and I didn't hear any complaints but out of about 15 people only 3 admitted to liking them.

These were so much fun!  After beginning with the three main ingredients, I took other's advice and made 6 different kinds of truffles.  Vanilla, almont, mint, peanut butter, irish cream, coconut & rum..you can keep going!  And picking what to roll the truffles in is such a treat.

They tasted a bit fudge-y (not that I'm complaining) the first go-around.  I doubled the recipe and used 5 cups of sugar (as opposed to 6), I think next time I'll use 4.  Also, I used one package of real cream cheese and one non-fat.  I suppose they balance one another out and still taste great.

This was my first try at Truffles and I have to say that they were super easy and wow what flavor!! I did two types, I did orange and regular and rolled them in coco powder, red and pink sprinkles, heath toffe bits and them I also dipped a bunch. The ones that are dipped have a hard shell but once inside its creamy goodness!!! Thanks for sharing!!

They were pretty good, but I have had better homemade truffles before. I recomend putting some lavender blossoms inside them. Maybe a tad unorthodox, but tasty.

This is a great recipe.  Everyone loved it!  I did exactly what the recipe said but used 2 cups of melted chocolate chips and 1 cup of melted white chocolate chips.  I also added 1 tablespoon of raspberry extract and 2 tablespoons of Kailua.  It was hard rolling them but since its snowing in Michigan I ended up covering the dish and leaving it outside for 20 minutes.  It was allot easier to roll.  After rolling them, I put it back in the fridge and after 1/2 hour I melted white chocolate and splattered over.  It turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

These taste delicious! Absolutely no problems with the taste.  However, they only get four stars because they were difficult to shape and kept breaking.  I only refrigerated them for about 20 minutes, maybe that has something to do with it?

These were just OK.  Tastes more like fudge to me than truffles.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and only 2 cups sugar (after reading other reviews).  I spread the mix in a baking pan to help it chill faster then cut into squares, then rolled into balls.  The ones rolled in ground nuts came out best.

In order to get the perfect roundness I used a mellon baller and then coated each in butterscotch.
Thanks for the excellent recipe!

OMG!!! A SWEET-TOOTH'S DREAM!!! 
This my 1st attempt at truffles, and wow, I picked a winner! These are fantastic! I did like the others suggested, and cut down to 2 cups of sugar & choc. chips. What I did was put on surgical-type gloves and rolled into little balls and place on wax paper. Then I melted a brick of almond bark w/parrifin wax. Then I spooned it over top the balls. (Dipping them will leave brown streaks in the white chocolate.) Then I sprinkled colored sugar crystals over them while still wet. They turned out great! I can't wait to show them off!

These are great and there are so many options for decorating them.  I dipped some ot the truffles in dark chocolate, and put some holiday sprinkles around some.

I haven't rolled the truffle batter into balls yet, but judging from the way my 2-year old daughter is tasting the mix, it's going to be a hit. :) I did a half batch (only had 4 ounces of cream cheese), and I ran out of chocolate chips.. So I used half semi-sweet and half white chocolate chips, melted and mixed together. I decided to put a little rum in the mix instead of vanilla, but you can't taste it. All I taste is yummy cheese and chocolate! I plan to roll the balls in icing sugar and/or finely chopped walnuts. It's an absolutely awesome recipe!!

Yummy! I made the recipe as written. I had no problems what so ever. I made mine using a tablespoons worth of "dough". No way could I get 60 balls. Rolled them in regular white sugar, graham cracker crumbs, coconut, melted chocolate and confectioners sugar. I wouldn't use the 10X sugar again. They didn't look very pretty compared to the other ones.  I left one out at room tempature for 1/2 an hour and the consistency was still fine. A keeper!

FANTASTIC recipe!  So smooth and delicious, and so rich!  One suggestion from those who loved them, put nuts or something else in the actual mix to temper the richness of the chocolate a bit.  But that was just because they wanted to eat a lot more of them!

This recipe was awesome, a big hit with the family. I covered the balls in melted semi-sweet and some in white chocolate. I think I'll be making more of these even after the holidays.

This is was extremely easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and separted itno two types (1) milk choc centres coated in grated white choc (2) white choc centres coated in grated milk choc - they look and taste wondeful.  I am packaging them in cello and labelling them 'Chocolate Cheesecake Truffles' which works well with the cream cheese in the recipe.  Very sticky little buggers to roll, but alot of fun :)

I made these last year and plan to make them again this year. They were so easy to make and tasted so good. I halved it and added orange extract to one batch.

When making this recipe I read the reviews and altered it to the way the userpersron adle made their truffles. It was really yummy, however this recipe makes too many truffles.
