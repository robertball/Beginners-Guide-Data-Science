Loved it.  I pureed my plums and then put them through a sieve really only straining out the skins.  I used chipotle powder.  I'm not a canner so I'm going to freeze my leftovers.

Yummy!  I made this recipe and it ended up filling 8 small freezer/canning containers.  Used some as a BBQ sauce on baked chicken - excellent!  I did substitute 1T pure chipotle powder from Penzey's for the seasoning mix.   Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome.  I too used chipotle in adobo sauce and had some jalapeno's canned in vinegar, so just used the vinegar from the jar in place of the jalapeno and vinegar (already hot)!  I originally misread the directions and left this on this stove for about 1/2 a day or so and it ended up really thick.  Excellent for BBQ sauce.  We BBQ'd prawns and my son-in-law from Hawaii dipped his prawns and then ate the rest with his fingers!  He couldn't get enough.  My plums are starting to get ripe again this year and I already have requests for jars of this sauce!  It is great!  I too did not make enough because I definitely did not end up with any left over for me.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I have two Italian Plum trees that produce overwhelming amounts of fruit each year, so I'm always on the look out for things to do with them.  This complex sauce is sweet, tangy, smokey and rich.  The only thing I'll do differently next time I make it is put less sugar in, though even with the amount of sugar it calls for it's delicious.  Everyone who has tasted it has asked for either the recipe or a jar.

This was amazing.  A different version of an HP Sauce.  I stewed the plums for 5-10 minutes and them put them through my juicing sieve squeezing out the juice and pulp and leaving the skin and seeds behind.  No need to use the liquid smoke,  the chipotle pepper is enough.  Before placing the sauce in jars I used 1/4 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch.  Mix this well to disolve the cornstarch then add to the heated sauce to thicken. YUM!

I had a gallon, or 4 quarts, of right Italian prune plums. The smaller, egg shape plums. I can imagine the task of pressing each of those raw through a colander to get juice. I also wanted to make as many jars as possible to can for Christmas gifts. I had to do some math for the conversions that I hope will be helpful to someone else. There are 6 to 8 regular size plums in 1 pound. For my Italian plums, there are 11 to 12. That means 44 plums to 1 quart. For this recipe, that would be 220 small plums. I simply cut them in half to remove the pit and then put them in my food processor. I buzzed 10 at a time and got them as smooth as possible. I repeated this until I had used all the plums and in total, I got 25 cups of. Fruit. You would get 33 cups if you had the 5 quarts the recipe calls for. I increased the vinegar and added a quarter cup of pectin just to make sure that this would can and keep well. I also read reviews about it being a too sweet and knew the vinegar would both help at preserve it and tone down the sweetness. I processed half pints in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and got 32 jars! Already served it with roast pork and then tacos and everyone loved it. I will share pictures and the full ingredients are used: 25 cups puréed plums. 1/4 cup pectin. 4 cups apple cider vinegar. 6 cups sugar. 6 cloves garlic. 2 1/2 Tbs salt. 1 large onion. 1 jalapeño. 1/4 cup chipotle peppers in adobo. Cooked everything down for an hour and a half at a simmer before canning.

This is amazing!  We have a plum tree and this made a fabulous treat.  We served it spooned over pork chops.  My stepson is in culinary school and shared a jar of it with his instructor, who raved about our efforts!  Truly delicious.

So delicious! I sort of winged it with the ingredients because my household likes both spice and garlic, so I went a little crazier with the chipotle. Like another reviewer, I didn't have any chipotle seasoning, so I used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and that gave it a HUGE kick. My only complaint is that there isn't more, because I was planning on giving some away, but now I want to keep it all to myself!!

Just had enough plums to make one cup of juice, so I adjusted the recipe and simmered some pork chops in it. It was delicious! I would love to try jarring a large amount someday.

Wow, I was skeptical with the interesting ingredient list, but this is AMAZING!  The only thing I did differently was I juiced the plums via boiling in a small amount of water.  I find it to be a more effective method to extract the juice.  It also left me with lots of extra juice for jelly - or maybe to make another batch of sauce.  Yum!

Absolutely fantastic sauce!  We bbq'd chicken breasts and used the sauce to baste the chicken.  My whole family loved it.

This recipe worked really well fresh over baked pork chops.  I reduced the ammount to 2 servings per pork chop and replaced the chipotle seasoning and jalapeno with oven roasted jalapenos in equal proportion to the plums.  Thanks for the recipe!

as written it was too sweet for us and not quite spicy wnough since I used vey few of the seeds. it was also too liquidy for me after the allotted cooking time. This is why I gave it 4 stars. So I added anothrr jalapeno and added extra vinegar. I cooked it for at least twice as long because it was too liquidy.  it was still liquidy but it jelled to jam thickness as it sat. I made it again with 1/2 cup less sugar and an extra 1/2 jalapeno and cooking it longer.   
It was perfect, I'd give it 10 stars this way!
I put up 5 quarts this year.

Absolutely love this bbq sauce.  This is my second year making it.  It is a bit difficult to get any juice out of the plums just by squeezing them by hand.  I ended up using a juicer, and my food processor.  I like it a bit chunkier than the recipe is.  And I do recommend using Penzeys chipotle seasoning.  I used about 1/2 of the amount, and it was perfect.  Oh, and skipped the jalepeno as well.  I didnt think it needed it.

First off -- I am not a fan of plums, but this is SOOO good. 

Instead of hand squeezing the plums, I put them in the steam juicer and used the juice for the recipe.

We canned it in smaller containers and when I put a pork roast in the crock pot I dump one of these babies in and oh-so-good! Picking the rest of the plums off the tree today to make as much as I can to last the winter!

Ths is the second year I have made this; it became a staple for us over the winter. It is kind of a barbecue sauce. It is spicy, sweet, and had a nice heat to it. I use it to perk up baked chicken and pork chops. I have poured it over roasts. It is just yummy.

Made as recipe directed, except i pureed plums in food processor. My husband loves it, and ate it over eggs  and sausage for breakfast. It's definately a multipurpose sauce. I will make a batch with my jalepenos seeded next time as it was too hot for my taste, but hubby liked as is. Just a note, i had 1 1/2 cups less of plums then recipe called for, and still managed to can 9 1/2 jelly jars!

This was delicious! I boiled it a little too long and it came out like tar but nevertheless, it was very yummy. I will definitely make this again next year with my plums but just turn the burner down. I should also note everyone in the family liked this as well.

I used three smoked Hatch peppers instead of jalapeños and reduced the sugar to 4 cups. I used Weber Bold 'N Spicy Chipotle Seasoning. I put the plums and the peppers into the Vitamix instead of squeezing the plums through a colander. The entire house smelled of sweet smokey deliciousness as the sauce simmered.

This has a good flavor. The texture reminded me of apple butter and that didn't appeal to me for some reason. I would try it again.
