This was really good and the best GF wraps I've tried so far.  I substituted brown rice flour for coconut flour and it was fine.  The consistency was quite thin though (followed all directions).  So thin that there were holes in the tortilla so I added more flour, to a pancake consistency, which helped.  They were nice and pliable for fajitas but still thin. 

I left some of the batter to finish after dinner and they made the thickest, best tortillas.  I think having it sit for 30 mins or so, not just the 5, might really help.  As a plus, I stored the extras in the fridge with paper towels around them in a zipper bag and they've kept really well for a week.  This is my tortilla recipe thus far.  Thanks! (3 photos show straight recipe, then added more flour, then had batter sit - best)

It was way too runny - I don't think I needed 6 eggs and all that milk, but I was following the recipe exactly, and it made way too much, and then it was so thin it was like a crepe. So I added more coconut flour to thicken it and it worked but it doesn't taste like a wrap. I will use the huge amount it made to make pancakes instead. I would not recommend this recipe unless you can get the consistency better.
