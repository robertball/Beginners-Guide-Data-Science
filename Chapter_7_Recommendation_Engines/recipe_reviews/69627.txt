Very, very good. I used instant oats and they turned into nice crunchy granola! Next time I'll use even more plain yogurt - more tangy, less sweet. Easy, quick and healthy dessert!

I really liked this recipe. I live alone so I made the four glasses and then put them in the fridge. They are the perfect amount for a healthy snack. The honey oats came out good and crunchy.

Loved this recipe!  I made this for my kid's for breakfast and they sat down (very quietly!) and ate almost their entire cup.  I used vanilla yogurt and only 1 very large banana.  I will probably add more oatmeal next time just for personal preference.  I need bigger glasses to serve this to adults, I used custard cups and they just weren't big enough to hold many bananas for my husband and I, but made in smaller portions, were perfect for the kids.  Thanks a lot for a yummy and very easy recipe!

Deeeee-lish and super easy to make. I'm doing p90x, so I made a few adjustments. I didn't use any pudding, instead I mixed a scoop of vanilla protein powder in with plain nonfat yogurt. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and did half crushed bran flakes cereal and half oats for more texture and crunch.

I gave this 5 stars as my 5 year old, my husband and I loved it.  We had it for dessert and wished we had more for a late night snack!  This is great for breakfast too!  I used 2/3 cup oatmeal and then 1/3 cup of Granola Cereal we had to give it a little more texture.  Very good this way.

Everyone inhaled these! I used french vanilla yogurt instead of plain, otherwise followed the recipe - this is really versatile and can be used with any kind of fruit and pudding - will be making these again soon!! Thanks for a great recipe!

OK, so I'm back to eatting healthy again, and instead of ice cream at night I'm making this instead. It's very good and satisfying. I do buy Fat Free Yogurt and buy the pkg of FF/SF Vanilla Pudding and just add the powder to the yogurt. It's more solid/thick this way, but it's just a preference of what you like. AND, the BF has no idea it's a diet dessert/snack !!!!

This was a refreshing twist on desert. Sometimes you want something sweet after dinner but not too rich. This fits the bill! I added 1 tblsp of brown sugar to the oats and honey to make it more of a crumble type topping.

Easy, but just didn't care for the bananas like this. I'll try with strawberry, blueberry or peaches in it & change the yogurt to match. If that doesn't work I'll probably toss the recipe. I like banana cream pie, but that is always made from scratch, not boxed pudding so maybe that is what I didn't like - brand name used.

I made this as a dessert, and it came out very good. I did it in tall parfait-style glasses. I made a few modifications.   I used fiber one (original) instead of the toasted oats. There was probably about 1/4th of a cup in each glass. Omitted the honey. I thought about using splenda but decided it was sweet enough as is. Used one sugar free vanilla pudding snack (pre-made), and cool whip free. Also only used 1 small banana. I blended the bananas in with the pudding and cool whip- came out great.  I topped it with a few blackberries- presentation on this was great.

I served this for breakfast one morning and it came out too sweet for my taste. Will definatly add a little more plain non-fat yogurt to the mix. The bananas weren't much of a hit either with my kids, will probably replace with berries or grilled apple cinnamon slices instead. Otherwise nice healthy snack or meal. I will be working on this recipe to become a regular.

This was good. I made a sugar-free version for my father since he's diabetic. I used sugar-free pudding and yogurt and doubled the amounts. I also added granola cereal to add some more crunch. I also added Splenda to the custard to make it sweeter.

We loved this.  It was a nice, light dessert.  My husband loves banana desserts really enjoyed it.  I put a bit too much of the oats on the bottom of his, i think light layers are key. But overall it was fabulous.  Thank you for the recipe!

What a wonderful treat.  These were great, a bit of work to put together because of dieting folks but, the end product was worth every bit of it.  I will double the oat mix next time, just for personal taste.  I only had French Vanilla yogurt on hand but, will definitely try the original recipe next go around too.  Thanks for the treat.

Loved this recipe.  I used lemon pudding i/o vanilla and it was delicious!  Made it as a snack but would work well as a healthy dessert.

I liked it with double the oats to give it more crunch.  Next time I will make it with less pudding and more yogurt to make it less sweet.  Overall it was great!
