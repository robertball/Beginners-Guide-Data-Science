Great recipe!  It does make a lot so if you do not have a large family or are not making it for a holiday, I would half it.  I'm always looking for new side dishes. Good addition to boring old rice. This is a keeper.  Thanks

Meh.  This was a box of Uncle Ben's rice with some vegetables.  Not very interesting.  (but also not bad)

I made this one Thanksgiving for my friend who is Phillipino.  He jokes that there is never rice at our holiday dinners!  So I made this and everyone just loved it.  It is nice to have a choice other than stuffing.

This is a quick and easy recipe. Different from the normal white rice. The red peppers not only added a little color, but also more flavor. Mine came out a little gummy, but next time I'll reduce the amount of water because once cooked, the onions add their own water. I paired this with the salmon and broccoli. Overall, I like it and now the real test is my family...crossing fingers.

Very easy and the slight additions (red pepper, onions, and green onions, liven  up a relatively bland dish.  Excellent as a side dish with seafood.
