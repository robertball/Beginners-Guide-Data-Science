Hello Chef John, I tried this the first time with a pre-school class. The kids loved doing this activity. Here is a hint to make it much easier. Throw a clean marble in the jar. When you have a lot of anxious kids ready to shake the jar it goes by pretty fast. When it turned to butter, they used plastic butter knives to spread their own on warmed homemade banana bread. They really enjoyed learning about dairy products and how to make their own butter, almost more than learning to make ice cream in a coffee can.

This is a good recipe. I've been making butter this way on and off for over 40 years. It is very easy. I would add the following tips though to this recipe to make it extra easy-
1. Make sure your milk or heavy cream is room tempeture. The butter will break (separate faster if you do this)
2. Use a plastic jar and lid instead of glass. I have a magic bullet so I use those, before that any food-safe plastic jar was fine. The plastic will allow the heat of your hand to help "break" the butter.
2a. Shake vigorously until you hear a audible pop-this is the butter separating from the milk. Think " ice cold martini" when you shake. you want the majority of the milk out in the first shake up. You can't bruise it so don't be gentle, shake it hard and fast....
3. Put a cheese cloth over the top of the jar and pour off the liquid. Do not handle the butter in the cheese cloth. The cheese cloth can make the butter heat to liquid and you will lose some if you try to press the remaining liquid out.
4. Place your butter in a room tempeture dish and use a butter knife to whip the butter rapidly. This will remove the remaining liquid and place air in the butter giving it a lighter, creamier flavor and texture.
5. Place in a butter keep and refrigerate immediately. This will keep it from developing strange flavors.

When I was a kid, which is 70 yrs ago, my grandma used to sit us on the floor and give us each a quart mason jar to shake til we made butter. We  (5 of us) thought this was great fun.

My son and I have been wanting to make our own butter for a while now. Thank you. Also, I found the answer you asked for,  about the cold water...

Now you need to "rinse" the butter. It is important to remove as much buttermilk as possible to keep the butter from going rancid. Put the butter back in your mixing bowl and cover with clean, cold water.
With the back of your wide spoon, begin pressing the butter into the side of the bowl. The water will get cloudy as the buttermilk is "cleaned" out of the butter. Pour the water off and add more cold water.
Repeat this process 4-5 times or until the water stays clear. Done!

If you desire to make a larger amount, be sure to work some cold water through your butter to prevent an "off" flavor during storage.  As you are making a small amount with this recipe, I am sure it will be used quickly rather than stored.

Worked perfectly!  I followed another reviewers advice and added a cleaned glass marble to the jar to aid with mixing.  I also added a little salt to the cream.  Great activity for the kids!

Used a quart jar and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream. My kidlets did the first 10 minutes but got distracted with a memory card game. Finished processing in food processor. Tasted great!

Worked wonderfully. I ran out of butter and didn’t want to drive to the store. Used heavy whipping cream. My 9 year old did most of the work. Tried one with no marble and one with a marble. The marble cut down the time quite a bit!

My mom would put a marble in the jar when she gave me my "little butter" jar to shake when she would make the butter in big handle spun churn.

I've never made homemade butter before, but loved the idea of using leftover heavy cream. We went the old school route for fun and just took turns shaking the jar. Delicious butter! Will make more, but using the food processor instead.

I made mine using a Ninja food processor, took all of about 5 minutes. Dont forget to add the salt! I then tasted it against an Amish butter and an Irish butter that I always use and it was absolutely amazing. Very silky, creamy was the best of the 3 in overall taste. This will be my butter from now on! A lot of fun to make too.

Didn't have a mason jar.  I used a regular electric mixer.  Takes about 10 minutes on high speed before the cream separates.   If you like your butter salted you only need a pinch, that even may be too much.  After it curdled and was firm I drained out  the liquid (this is a sign you at the complete state when the cream separates) shaped the curds into a butterball then place it into water twice so that the rinse water was clear.  Great taste.   Saved the liquid aka buttermilk to use in a chocolate cake receipe.

Wow, first off I only wanted to leave a comment as a help for a question Chef John asked, but it probably took me 15 minutes of hoop jumping to get here, not great system.

Anyway, you asked if anyone knew why some recipes say to rinse w/ cold water, and Katie from Wellness Mama said in her butter recipe that it is to make sure that all of the butter milk is squeezed and rinsed out so that the butter won't mold.  I'm no expert, but I've made butter lots of times like you suggest, just did last night, and I don't know if I've ever rinsed it.  Sometimes I add salt, sometimes not.  Thanks.

It came out as more of a whipped cream :/ Really good but not butter. I look forward to eating it though!
