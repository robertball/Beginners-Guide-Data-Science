I added wedges of red onion and tomato. I left out the cilantro. I wanted it to taste like the thai curry soup at noodles and company. I think I succeeded.

This was pretty good but not spectacular. I added more goodies, some snap peas and red peppers. I think next time I'll skip the lime juice and soy, a good curry paste has enough salt and sour in it so it might be better balance without.
For those who skipped the lemon grass, in Thailand they never hack up the lemon grass. Hit it with the handle of your knife or a meat cleaver, then tie it into a knot. Throw it in the pot and let it simmer then simply remove the whole piece before serving :-)

I make this soup almost every week!  I make it veggie by using veggie broth and mushrooms or tofu for the shrimp.  I've never added the lemon grass and often leave out the cilantro and/or green onions and it doesn't seem to suffer.  also, I use full fat coconut milk.  Also, since the soup never lasts more than a day i add the noodles straight to it.  3/4 or so of the spinach seems like plenty to me.  All in all a great a forgiving recipe, thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly and this soup was excellent!  the only thing I would change would be to add more mushrooms.

This is very good with firm tofu. I used 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tablespoon of grated ginger, 3 oz shiitake mushrooms, and about 6 oz spinach. Since I wasn't able to find yellow curry paste, I used curry powder and tweaked the spices until it tasted right. Also good with rice instead of noodles (both are good). This is a new favorite of ours. Thanks!!

I thought the green onions were not necessary, rather I used fresh cilantro and a lime wedge and mung bean sprouts to garnish.
I also left out the mushrooms and spinach as they didn't make sense to me. I substituted carrots.
It's a great base for your own version.
I found the lemon grass to be like eating wood, I was confused when the recipe called for minced lemon grass, normally I just split my lemon grass 3/4 of the way down the stalk to I can remove it after the dish is cooked much like a bay leaf.

I also LOVE the Thai Curry Soup from Noodles & Company.  The base of the soup is a good start, I added Sriracha chile sauce to give it a little more heat, a little yellow curry powder in addition to the red, and a little extra sugar.  The end result was as good or better than Noodles version.

Very yummy!  I omitted mushrooms, and instead put red bell pepper strips in it.  Also less curry paste - it was still hot!

This is probably the best soup I have ever made. I used tofu instead of shrimp and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It was restaurant quality, delicious.

This was very good!  It came together easily.  It's all about the lemon grass which I was generous with. I was also generous with the red curry paste, using closer to a tablespoon full and I used about 1 1/2 c. mushrooms and substituted vegetable stock for chicken stock.  I used shrimp, but I don't think it added much in the way of flavor; next time I will use tofu instead.  I will definitely make this again.

This was such a hit with us, restaurant quality. My only negative is that it is somewhat expensive to buy all the ingredients. Will definitely make again!

I mean absolutely no flavor at all.  Something serious is missing from this recipe, I read all the reviews first so I was prepared for this not being spicy enough but this soup has NO flavor at all.  I am terribly disappointed.

This was an incredible recipe, I've used it for more than one occasion and it always Kills it! The only little suggestion I have that I find makes it just a little more tasty is to Cook your Thai noodles al dente then let them simmer in the sauce for just a little while, but again my hats off to the chef!

I don't know much about Thai food, but I made this and it was really good.  Definitely going to make it again.

I've never cooked with lemongrass before.  I looked up a video on how to chop it, but in the end it was a little tough for my taste.  Not sure if sauteing it for longer would be the proper approach or not...?

I used a full package of sliced mushrooms because I could probably eat a pile of mushrooms and be happy, and I tripled the garlic because I love garlic.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was mildly spicy. Next time I might add a little more red curry paste or maybe toss in some cayenne or something, just to elevate it to the next level.

Ultimately, really good.  Don't know how authentic it is, but when it tastes this good I don't know if it really matters.

My 14 year old daughter wrote a report on Thailand, and took this soup to school today. She followed the recipe exact except to double it. She not only got an A, but several of her teachers asked for the recipe.

I am seriously impressed with this recipe. I stopped by my local Thai grocery after work this evening without a plan, grabbed some things I knew I could find a recipe for, hurried home and searched the internet for "curry, mushrooms, lemongrass" and this recipe is one of the first that popped up.     I thought that using lime juice instead of kaffir lime would compromise the flavor, but it was just as fragrant! I omitted the spinach just because I didn't have any, and I replaced the green onions with a leek/shallot mixture, again because I did not have green onions. I also used bean string noodles instead of rice noodles, which you have to make sure you prepare according to the package and not follow the directions on this recipe as they are totally different noodles.    Even with all the substitutions and omissions it was delicious! I've had plenty of authentic Thai lemongrass soups and this comes seriously close to authentic-tasting. I will definitely be making this again.

This is delicious, even with a few modifications I had to make.  I used chicken instead of shrimp, frozen spinach instead of fresh, garlic powder instead of cloves, and left out the lemon grass.  Even with all of these shortcuts, it was still delicious and reminded me of Noodles and Co.'s dish

My favorite meal out there.  I add both shrimp and chicken.  This is my kind of recipe and is good all year round.  Putting this over rice noodles makes it a done deal.

My husband really enjoyed this "Thai Curry Soup" and asked me to make it again (5 stars). I am still looking for a Thai soup that tastes like the ones served in Thai restaurants. Thank you Kaeli for sharing your recipe.

I loved following this recipe! It was super easy and very good with my additions. I made the soup just like the directions suggest however added cherry tomato halves, yellow curry sauce and fish sauce (to amp up flavor), and lots of red pepper because we love spice!! I gave four stars because I do feel if I had not made my additions, the soup may have been a bit bland like some of the others have said (bland for my taste anyway having lived in Asia). All in all, it was great!

Love, love, love this soup! Added a cup of shrimp, fresh ginger, little more mushrooms and a little less spinach( which I thinly sliced).  My husband said it was restaurant quality! Absolutely fabulous recipe easily changed up for personal preferences!

Of all the ethnic recipes I have tried on this site, this one was truly outstanding! My hubby loved it! Like we all do, I tweaked a little. I served it as a main dish so I doubled the shrimp. And because we love it spicy, I added a teaspoon of curry powder and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. This one goes on my repeat frequently list!

I had to improvise a bit since I didn't have red curry paste (used curry powder) or lemongrass, but the end result was amazing. My dad tried it and said it tasted like something from a restaurant. I wanted a coconut curry soup and feel like I found exactly what I needed to be creative again in the future, as this is a great base!

My fiance and I love this. We have made it four times in the last 2 weeks. WE're all about the soup part of it so we added 2 cans of coconut milk. We also like it spicy so we kept adding the red curry paste until it got there. You can use this with shrimp or tofu. Delicious soup!

AWESOME! Just like Noodles and Company! I left out lemon grass and cilantro and added tomato and red onion like other review. I cooked the onion during the 20 minute simmer and add the tomato at the end so it was cold.

I absolutely loved this soup! I could not find Lemongrass, so I had to do without.  I also could not find Curry paste, so I used about half a cup of a curry cooking sauce.  It still worked out pretty well, but I think next time I will find an Asian market to get curry paste, I have the feeling it will really make the soup ten times better.  It was super easy for anyone that wants to try cooking Thai and is a little hesitant.  I am going to have the leftovers for dinner tonight too :)

Not bad. I used Thai Red Curry Paste (added more than listed), changed spinach for bok choi, palm sugar instead of white, used shitake mushrooms and added more lime juice than listed. I also used fresh ginger rather than powder and finely chopped lemon grass rather than minced.   It tasted better the day after (as with most curry based recipes), though I may add the shrimp the day after next time to keep it less rubbery.

Amazing - incredible - delicious - wow.  This is my favorite recipe on this site so far, both for the fact that I followed it almost exactly and that it turned out incredibly like the 'authentic' versions I've had before.  I can see this becoming a regular part of my routine.  The best part is the fluidity with the veggies and meat.  You can really change it up, but I would recommend keeping the base consistent. Thank you Kaeli!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  I was out of lime so I had to omit it.  It would have added to the depth of flavors so next time, I'll make sure I have it on hand.  There definitely was a kick to the soup, but it was a nice heat, and leftovers reheated nicely for lunch the next day.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this soup many times.  One thing I do to take it up a notch.  I take the shrimp shells and sauté them with spices and add some chicken broth and simmer for 20 minutes and make what I call the golden broth.  Really adds a lot of rich flavor.  I also add an andouille sausage to spice it up.

Very tasty. I did do a few thing different. It makes a great base soup to add so many different ingredients. I made the broth up to the paste then added chicken strips. Also added the juice of 1/2 lime. Simmered for 30 minutes. Added the coconut milk as well as 2 tablespoons of basil. Let simmer for about 10 minutes to let the flavors blend. This was the basis for lunch time soup for the week. I would divide up into containers and freeze. When ready, I would thaw, heat up and add stir fry vegs and or shrimp. The flavor of the base was as good as you get in a really good Thai restaurant. Thanks for a new favorite.

This was really good!  I didn't have any lemongrass so that was left out. I did 1/2 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger instead of the dried, increased the garlic to 2 cloves, increased the red curry paste to 1 Tbsp (we like it spicy), used 2 chicken breasts instead of shrimp (cut into strips and boiled in the soup),  and only used 2.5 oz of spinach (it was all I had).  I didn't have cilantro and green onions, so they were left out; I don't think they were needed.

I'm sure had I had everything on hand and made it as written, it would have been great!  I will probably decrease the chicken broth by half next time, for a thicker consistency.  My kids wanted more mushrooms, so I will increase that next time as well.  My husband said he would prefer it over rice, but we all enjoyed the noodles.  

I look forward to leftovers!

This recipe as it stands now is bland and lacks core Thai ingredients. I've read reviewers say it is missing something key in flavor but they aren't sure what it is. This recipe MUST have fish sauce instead of soy. Soy isn't a authentic Thai ingredient, fish sauce is. You also need to use real coconut milk and not the nasty reduced fat stuff. The real stuff will give you a nice natural milky coconut flavor if you use it.

Way too heavy on the chicken broth and it therefore canceled out the coconut milk.  Not spicy enough, but that's a personal taste.

Made as-is this recipe was bland. The only ingredient I was missing is the lemongrass, which I couldn't find. I ended up tripling the amount of the red curry, adding onion powder and red pepper flakes to get this to a better flavor. The end result was pretty good.

I made only a few minor adjustments to the recipe, which I'm sure didn't alter the final results much.  I used chicken instead of shrimp.  I cut the chicken in thin strips, cooked it a bit in the oil, removed, then continued with the recipe, adding the chicken back in towards the end.  I also used lemon grass powder (about 1/2 tsp.) instead of fresh lemon grass, left out the soy sauce and added a couple of squirts of fish sauce.  Also used brown sugar instead of the white.  It was fantastic!  Very similar to "The Best Thai Coconut Soup" recipe, also on this site, which is another favorite of ours.  I did enjoy the addition of the spinach in this recipe though.  Hubs said it's a "do again"!  Thanks for sharing!

Great Soup! Serve over rice, and much less cilantro- especially if using fresh cilantro. Add curry powder if you like more of the curry flavor (or sprinkle the powder on after like I did).

I did not add shrimp, spinach or mushrooms... tasted great without them. Add more garlic for sure! I also used leeks instead of the onions.

This was good, better the next day. I agree with the poster who said the shrimp really do not add anything to the dish tho.. would be just as good without. Next time will make it meatless, or maybe try chicken.

Overall, the soup is very tasty. However, I really had to tweak the recipie as it was not perfect as is. First, the amount of fresh baby spinach is way too much (for my family). I used a 5 oz. plastic package of baby spinach leaves and we were all still overwhelmed (even after they cooked down). Next time I will just use 2 oz or a couple handfuls. 

Second, I added way more red curry paste, otherwise it was not at all spicy and the coconut was overwhelming. I bought Thai Kitchen red curry paste (all I could find in my rural area), and ended up using tablespoons instead of teaspoons - and it was still on the milder side. The red curry paste really gives it a comfortable feeling reminiscent of a creamy tomato soup - but it is still so unfamiliar you keep going back for another spoonful.  

I added a cup of sliced mushrooms, and a cup of shrimp - so good. And put in a sliced tomato at the end just before serving. I thought the green onions on top gave it a real restaurant feel/quality. My husband loved that added touch. 
 
Excellent and thank you!!!

Very good addition with the spinach.

This recipe was a great base!  I used chicken thighs instead of shrimp and subbed red pepper for the mushrooms.  I also used the other Thai Curry Soup recipe on this site as a guide for adding fish sauce & brown sugar instead of the soy sauce and white sugar.  We loved it - definitely will make again!

Delicious! Next time I'd leave out the spinach, gave a slightly bitter taste.  And add more mushrooms.

An outstanding recipe, Kaeli!  I loved this spicy, flavorful, comforting soup.  Absolutely delicious.  I prepared as written, with a couple of small exceptions.  I added a 1/2 tablespoon more red curry, and added about a cup extra chicken broth, and cheated by adding super fine rice noodles directly into the pot at the end of cooking.  Only change I will make to this next time is to use a 6 oz bag of spinach instead of a 10, love the stuff but want to taste more of that delicious broth!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, this is exceptional.

Very tasty! I added some sriracha and hoisin sauce. Next time I would make more noodles. The amount of spinach called for was quite overwhelming, next time I'm going to leave it out.

Awesome! Better than I even hoped for.  Only thing was I found 1/2 cup of mushrooms to be no where near enough! I added 1 1/2 cups, and it could have used 2!

Just made this tonight on a whim.  I had the basic ingredients and thankfully the red curry paste.  Did not have shrimp, but used leftover bbq grilled chicken.  I improvised with the ingredients I had on hand.  Used garlic from a tube (Gourmet Garden) and ginger in a tube from the asian mkt.  I used full fat coconut milk, skipped the spinach and cilantro (did not have).  I used 2 True Lime packets for the fresh lime juice.  The flavors were spot on.  Even my 6-yr-old loved it.  She asked for seconds!

This has been the Thai curry soup i have been looking for so long! i followed this recipe and it came out perfectly. I would recommend doubling this recipe as it is SO DELICIOUS you will want more. I also would add some fish sauce to it and more lime. I used shitake mushrooms and instead of rice noodles, i did the fat wide rice noodles (that i use for Pho). My boyfriend could not stop eating this soup! My new favorite soup!!!!!! oh and fresh ginger is always a must too :-)

I love love love this soup! I really hate cilantro though, so I never add it. I also use full fat coconut milk for richness. I make this a few times a month.  You can just throw the noodles into some just boiled water and let them sit for a few minutes until they're soft instead of boiling them on the stove. Make sure you keep those noodles separate from the rest of the soup until you're going to eat it, otherwise they develop a very weird texture. So, store the broth and noodles separate in the fridge. I also de-stem the spinach before adding to the soup. This is definitely my favourite soup. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is perfect- and my 2010 crowd pleaser. I have made this recipe on 4 occasions the past 6 weeks. First time exactly as the recipe was written. Second time I used green curry paste- equally as delicious. Third time I made it with chicken- again great. Tonight I am experimenting with yellow curry paste and strips of turkey. I cannot wait!!! It always looks amazing in the bowl- my guests have no idea how simple it is to make and always comment on all my effort- if only they knew! Thanks for sharing!

I was hoping the people who said these was bland were wrong and those who said it was like Noodles & Co were right.   Unfortunately, this was disappointingly bland, and just tasted like liquid with a hint of lime.  The good thing about that is my 4 yr old won't complain it's spicy.  I'll be adding a lot of sriracha to it so it tastes like something.

This recipe was fantastic!  I've cooked it twice, the first time was really tasty just following the recipe exactly and the second time I slightly altered it to our taste.  We prefer things pretty spicy so I like doubling the curry paste (could be that I have a milder brand), I increase the mushrooms, add green onions in the beginning as well as the end, and add a bullion cube.  Definitely a keeper that you can modify to fit your individual taste!

Love the soup! I changed things up a bit I didn't have lemon grass and green onions.  I added an onion, increased mush to 8 oz fresh and added more garlic.  Used full fat coconut milk.  I cut up the noodles.  would make again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I TOTALLY agree with Dranoel...if you like heat, this recipe is in need of some siracha chili sauce. But I didn't add it to the recipe, because it's just as easy to add to the soup at serving...a lot of people don't like super spicy. I made a few changes...I used 2 small diced shallots along with the garlic. I couldn't find fresh lemon grass at my local grocer, so I used a combination of pureed lemon grass out of the squeeze tube (which I sauteed with the garlic and shallot) and dried lemon grass, which I added as well with the broth. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms on hand, so I used a 1oz bag of dried porchini mushrooms. While the soup was simmering, I added shredded carrots, green beans, 1 chopped red bell pepper and 1 1/2 cup of shelled edamame beans. I used Light Coconut Milk. Instead of adding shrimp, I opted to keep this recipe vegetarian, and finished off with the fresh spinach and green onion. This one is a versatile soup - a KEEPER!

Not even close to spicy. I think I tripled the curry paste to get a good thai "heat" out of the dish. Only used a can of chicken broth. Had both bok choy and spinach so I used both for that. Doubled the shrimp. Added a can of bamboo shoots instead of mushrooms. Left out the lemon grass since it wasn't on hand. Next time I will add some petite frozen peas to the mix for more texture and greens. Nice recipe though, very close flavor to what my Thai aunt makes!

Excellent dish. I've been looking for a recipe to keep me out of Noodles and Co. and their Thai Curry Soup and this is almost exactly like it. Just added tomato wedges and fresh Asian basil and a squirt of sriracha sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really nice.  I took the advice of many others and added tofu.  I would add more than the amount of chicken required though.  I also didn't add nearly the amount of spinach.

Really flavorful, loved it! Omitted the lemongrass (hard to find here) and used frozen cooked shrimp, thawed and added during the last few minutes of cooking. Also used regular, not low-fat, coconut milk. I prepare rice noodles this way... Soak noodles in cold water for about 30 minutes to soften, drain and add to boiling water for 1-2 minutes until tender, drain. Other methods seem to make mushy noodles.

I love this soup!  I've made it several times and don't really change many things.  I do like it with a little more heat so sometimes I add different types of curry and different proteins.  The basic recipe is great though.

LOVED IT!  My husband must have said 10 times how much he loved this soup while he was eating it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I didn't use the cilantro (not a fan, at all.)  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  If you like your curries on the HOT side, you may want to add some red pepper flakes.  The great thing about this soup is it's a meal all by itself.  And it's somewhat healthy so you don't feel guilty eating a large bowl of it.  Try this one, you will not be disappointed!!

Really lovely! I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I made it veggie (vegetable broth and no shrimp). Next time I'll add a bit more curry to up the spice, but that's just a personal preference. Will definitely make again!

This is good. I like it a little spicier so next time will add chili oil or red chili’s. Some say it’s bland. I notice that other Thai curry soup recipes have fish sauce. Not sure, but that might add more flavor or just double the spice. A good base recipe. .

The BEST.  I add organic chicken, thinly sliced red pepper.  Make sure to add fish sauce at the end. Really finishes it!

Love this soup! I didn't have lemon grass paste, but I had lemon grass leaves and threw them in to simmer when I added the chicken stock. I removed them right before serving. They really add a wonderful flavor, don't omit them if you can. I also used fresh ginger and just grabbed it in.

Great recipe, tasted like restaurant Thai curry soup, Yum!  The only change I felt I needed to make for flavor was instead of 2 teaspoons of red curry paste, I used 2 tablespoons. It needed that extra punch, though it was still not two spicy. Still very mild. We chose to use chicken instead of shrimp, because we love chicken curry. We prefer dark meat chicken, so used 1.5 lbs of chicken legs instead of shrimp.  We also used fresh spinach, putting in a large 10 ounce container of fresh baby spinach. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe that can easily be made Vegan.  I used extra firm tofu cut up into small cubes instead of shrimp and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Left out the spinach but added julienned carrots in the initial saute of garlic and lemon grass.  Definitely use the lemon grass! It's SO worth the flavor!  Added a dash of crushed red pepper flakes to add a touch more heat.  Didn't use the noodles but ladled over Jasmine rice.  Delicious!  I  will make again and again.

It was excellent as a starting point, but changes had to be made due to allergy to mushrooms, and spinach due to dislike.
Boy Choy leaves were substituted and stalks to the place of the mushrooms.  Red curry was increased for more heat.  Also, homemade broth was used, and the amount of shrimp was added too (about 170 grams.  I cooked the shrimp separately, and husband likes his shrimp firm.  Adding it and cooking for only 5 minutes was not sufficient for him.

This was tasty when the curry paste was doubled and some salt added. That took it to 5 stars. I used dried lemongrass in a cheesecloth bag, but I imagine fresh would be much better. Thanks for sharing1

I loved it just exactly as it is written.  And I think that the spring onions (scallions) are essential to the Thai flavoring.  It has become a favorite.

I don’t know it was the lemongrass I got, but it was like bark.  I would put it in an infuser next time.  It was really good otherwise.

My third attempt at curry.  This was a great recipe.  I added extra mushrooms and shrimp.  I would go with more vegies next round but the broth was excellent.

Great recipe, I treat the spinach as optional, I add some shrimp at the end and I serve in a bowl over a lemongrass flavored Quinoa. Plus, instead of olive oil I use coconut oil. Very tasty!

Fantastic, no need to change anything, though I only had chicken so we used that, it will be amazing with shrimp.  

If you do not have lemon grass, which we don't, use the zest of a entire lemon, works great!

Used 1 thinly-sliced chicken breast instead of shrimp. Substituted 2 dried lemongrass stalks for fresh minced lemongrass and added after chicken broth rather than before. Used closer to 4 tsp of Thai Kitchen red curry paste for greater heat, and the juice of a whole lime.

Great base, but does need tweaking. Fish sauce for sure, more of the seasonings, also. My daughter added curry powder to her portion, because she likes curry and the paste added spice, but not enough flavor. Probably regular coconut milk would be better.  It was good, though, and will take whatever meats and veggies you can add. I did add peanut butter in my quest to get more flavor. I'll make it again and add curry powder, as well as paste. Thanks!

I added celery, carrots and zucchini while cooking, then puree'd it to thicken it some and to add more veggie nutrition. 
It tastes great as a soup. You can also add cut onions, peppers, potatoes, carrots, pumpkin, meat, etc and serve it with rice as a traditional curry.

This is delicious as is or added too. I sometimes make it without the noodles and it is still amazing. I love it so much I whipped up a big batch to bring to a soup swap and it was a huge hit. I come back to this recipe again and again it is so flavorful and delicious.

I added a jalapeño and sautéed it with the garlic, ginger and lemongrass.  I also subbed some chopped rotisserie chicken for the shrimp. This is easily the best soup I've ever made. Loved it!

Great recipe. I made some alterations for personal preference: Fresh basil instead of cilantro, and veg broth instead of chicken broth. I also added fish sauce, it's in most Thai soups. I used baby portabella mushrooms (they cook nicely and aren't expensive) I've also made a few more times with bamboo shoots, baby corn, bell peppers, peanuts and more. Tasted great every time.

Loved this! My first attempt at Thai food so followed the recipe exactly except for hammering the lemon grass and tying as suggested by another reviewer. Will definitely make again

It was good - I found the coconut milk to be a little too much - the cream was overpowering for me. I will probably make it again with a little less coconut milk and some spicy peppers for an extra kick.

We added chicken because of my DH's allergy to shrimp.  I added about 12 oz of leftover pieces from a rotisserie chicken, and regular spaghetti noodles cause that's what I had on hand!  We wish there was more!

This recipe is delicious!  Perhaps the best part is that it tastes better the next day after all the flavors have combined.  This will become a regular dish in my kitchen!

I added 3/4 cup red bell peppers, snow peas, carrots, red onion, and 1 whole jalepeno at the same time I added the shrimp. I added 2tbsp of fish sauce when I added the chicken stock as well. Came out delicious and very nutritious.

Lovely dish! I veganized it with better than bouillon vegetable base in place of chicken stock and tofu in place of shrimp. Added one diced Roma tomato as another user suggested to make it more like Noodle & co. And used full fat coconut milk, as that's what I had available. Awesome! Thank you for the recipe. Definitely staying in my favorites!

LOVE this!  I leave out the rice noodles just per my own tastes.  I add 1-1.5 t green curry paste along with the red.  Sometimes I exchange tofu for the shrimp.  
At the table, I add cayenne pepper and/or chili powder to taste.

This was so good and easy!  I can't believe I made it myself!  I did make a few changes which makes the recipe even better (that you can do that so easily)!  I did not use lemon grass,I used green curry paste, I did not have chicken broth, so I just counted the juice from the canned mushrooms and chicken (12.5 oz) plus 3 cups of water.  I used the chicken instead of the shrimp, lemon juice instead of lime, no cilantro and red onions cooked at the beginning with the garlic and oil instead of the green onions.  Maybe I'll try it more accurately the next time, but this was really good!

Wow. Thank you to Kaeli on this one. Best Thai style soup I have ever eaten, anywhere. I doubled the mushrooms and added red bell pepper but other than that stayed pretty true. So, so good.

I have been trying to duplicate this EXACT recipe for several years now. My former employer used to bring this to me before I moved out of state. I followed the recipe with 3 exceptions I added more mushrooms cause I love mushrooms a pinch of red pepper flakes & more lemon grass. I loved it my family couldn't get enough.

We loved this soup. It was full of flavor. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper because we like spicy, but it would have been delicious without I am sure. I didn't have fresh lemongrass so I used some dried. I put it in the broth and let it cook until we were ready to eat, then removed it. I will make it again but will sauté the mushrooms prior to putting with the other ingredients. Great recipe.

This is great! I also added 2 grated carrots and crushed red pepper flakes for some heat. I was unable to find red curry paste at the store so I substituted red curry sauce and it turned out delicious.

I did pretty much everything wrong (used frozen spinach, too much of it, curry powder instead of paste, and even managed to curdle the coconut milk by simmmering too high), and it was still fantastic. I comment on the Lemon grass. Didnt have any, and read that you could substitute lesser amounts of fresh lemon zest. I used about a tablespoon. Apparently true, the soup was perfect despite my errors. I agree with other reviewers that note shrimp or chicken are not necessary.

To get closest to the Noodles version, use full-fat coconut milk, a couple of tomato wedges and some shaved purple onion.  Even without those changes, this is a 5-star recipe; make it, and you will think you took yourself out for Thai food.

Note that neither the noodles nor the shrimp re-heat well; if you are going to have leftovers, cook only the shrimp you need.  Save the remaining broth and add fresh shrimp and fresh noodles when you eat it.

This is different then what I'm use to, but this is a great restaurant worthy recipe even without the Thai chili paste or Fish-sauce that is so common in Thai cooking.  Actually, with a veggie base, can be altered very little to make a very delicious vegetarian coconut curry soup.

In the case of myself, I followed the recipe to a T, added a single diced habanero pepper.  Used only chicken stock, and no meat.  I got thin vermecelli style, or Pho style noodles that I added instead of the fat Pad Thai style noodles.  Fork friendly, and soup friendly rather hen having to fight the Pad Thai noodles like flopping fish.  Over all very good recipe, and was not missing the pungent sardine smell of the Fish sauce filling my apt.

This is a great recipe if you love mushrooms. My boyfriend does and I just think they are ok. Therefore he loved this soup while I just thought it was ok. He said it tasted better than the Thai curry soup from our local restaurant. Overall a good recipe.

I probably shouldn't rate this since I modified the recipe quite a bit based on what I had on hand, but it turned out great nevertheless. Ingredients I omitted (coconut milk, mushrooms, shrimps, lemon grass and cilantro). I added an extra tsp of red curry paste as well as 1 tbsp of chili garlic sauce. I also added a bunch of baby bok choy, some celery and some zucchini in there. Turned out great. Just goes to show that this recipe is versatile!

I tried this soup but with my own twist. I changed a lot of the things that were in the soup and added a lot that wasn't on the recipe. I added tomato's, corn and chunks of onions. I added a few more spices and a lot more curry powder! I also used wheat noodles instead of rice noodles. Only complaint which was on my part was to much soy sauce and to much chicken. Next time I plan to use less chicken broth and less soy sauce. This was a seriously tasty soup.

Very flavorful.  I skipped the spinach because I didn't like the idea of large leaves of soggy spinach, so instead I put a handful of basil in with the cilantro and I really liked how herbal and fragrant it made the soup.

This had excellent flavor and we LOVED it.  Would have gotten 5 stars except that the lemongrass remained hard and crunchy.  Like eating cut up straw in your soup.  Will definitely be making again either without the lemongrass or with the lemongrass in a tea strainer for easy removal.

My wife loves this recipe when I make it. I do, however, make a few alterations. Instead of having minced lemongrass I cut fresh lemongrass into large chunks(couple inches long at least) and hammer it a bit to break up the cellulose and release the oils then fish it out of the pot later when its done. I also use Coconut Aminos instead of Soy Sauce as my daughter has a soy allergy. Using lime marinated shrimp is also good(you can get pre-done at Costco).

Great soup.  I didn't have red curry paste, so I used green.  Also, I couldn't find lemon grass at my grocery store, so I just left it out.  I also used fresh ginger instead of ground. Finally, I doubled the recipe, but put in 7x (14 oz) of noodles, and we still ate them all.  We are a noodle loving family.

I pretty much did this one by the book.  Only changes were I used more noodles--there's a lot of liquid--probably 4 oz.  I didn't have spinach, but I had arugula and that worked fine.  Then I tasted when done and decided it was very bland so I basically ended up squeezing one whole lime, added another tbl. of sugar and then I added a good dollop of sesame chili oil.  It definitely needed some heat.  And I also added more cilantro because we just love cilantro.

SO easy! This has been an extremely big hit with my friends and family. Can make broth ahead of time then add coconut milk, shrimp, mushrooms & spinach 5 min. before eating.  The only suggestion I have is to cook mushrooms a little longer before adding spinach and shrimp.  They are then a little softer, depending on your preference.

This soup was awesome. It is pretty close to Noodles & Co. thai curry soup, which I love! Instead of green onions I added red, and also added some tomato since Noodles' version has both those. I add tofu too instead of shrimp.

I used the cilantro-lime shrimp you get at Costco and instead of rice noodles and red curry paste, I used japanese noodles and one of those concentrated curry bars. Excellent, I made it twice in one week it was such a hit!

I thought this was too spicy with 1 teaspoon of red curry paste, so next time I'll cut it back to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also think that 1/2 cup of shrimp is too skimpy for 32 oz. of broth, so I put in 1/2 lb.  I added a julienned carrot to the sauted items and also 1/2 tablespoon of fish oil.  Overall, it was really good!

Yummy!  However, I left out the cilantro (as I am not a big fan of it), didn't put lemon grass as I didn't have any, used fresh ginger, used regular coconut milk, used 1 tsp of curry powder and 1 TBS of red pepper paste and used chicken instead of shrimp.  I also am going to make plenty more noodles next time since that was the best part in the soup.  Even with these changes it was delicious and I would definitely make this again!!

This recipe was oh so good! The flavor of the broth was excellent and everyone at the table enjoyed it thoroughly.  Next round I will reduce the spinach and increase the amount of shrimp and mushrooms, but the broth is perfect as is. Great meal!

This soup is FANTASTIC! I like to substitute the shrimp for fresh mushrooms, and vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it a bit healthier. Also- instead of spinach, I use Bok Choy it makes for a really nice flavor. My favorite soup by far!!!

This was fantastic. I doubled all of the ingredients in this recipe to make some leftovers - but I think that it still should have had more shrimp and noodles per serving. So, I'll probably tweak the proportions a bit next time. Other than that - it was yummy! Oh, and I didn't have lemongrass or lime juice - so I added lemon zest and lemon juice. I know that they're completely different, but still added a great flavor to the dish.

Good quick soup. Used tofu instead of shrimp and left out the spinach. I didn't have lemongrass, so I used extra ginger and some lemon rind and juice. Next time, use lemon grass and sub soy sauce with fish sauce.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did add one more clove of garlic, an additional cup of mushrooms and some additional red curry powder because I did not think it was quite spicy enough.  Overall, very good, but next time I will add less spinach.

I love soup...I love curry.  I LOVE this recipe...its honestly my current fave recipe.I also made a few small adjustments and it was still very flavorful.  I used yellow curry powder and chile garlic paste.  Did not have lemon grass..but will try it next time.  I added some shrimp..and it was delish.  I will be eating this whole pot of soup today, most likely! (oh and i felt a cold coming on...well, my head is clear and i sweat out something while eating..its a cure!)

I made this last night..it turned out sooo good! I felt like there were a lot of ingredients but it all adds to the flavor of it...I will definitely be making this again..and making double the amount above so I can have leftovers..I had a hard time finding the minced lemon grass so I substituted it for fresh lemongrass..which seemed to give it the same flavor...This is a definite A+ from me!

Haven't tried it yet but it looks good. What on earth is "cilantro" though, and where do I get it? I've never heard of it. It would be nice if a description of strange and unusual ingredients were included. Also, what are "green onions"? Over here (I'm in London, GB) we have red onions and white onions. Never seen green onions before.

I added 2 more cups of broth, ~1 cup (before cooking) rice, more curry paste (green), some ground red pepper and omitted the mushrooms... and I'm pretty happy with the results!  I think it would also be better without the meat (using tofu instead, or just none at all).

Incredible recipe! I used brown rice instead of rice noodles (but only because it's what I had), green curry paste instead of red, brown sugar instead of white, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  

You could easily serve it without rice or noodles for a wonderful appetizer soup, but is great as is for a dinner soup. I can't wait to serve it to guests!

I just made it with Tofu instead of chicken.  It was the best soup I've had.  Since we are vegetarian I  used vegetable stock.  Did not have red curry so used green curry paste.  Added thai basil instead of spinach.  Omitted soy sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe.  We will be making this for years to come.

This was fairly easy to make, but it didn't have exactly the flavor punch I was looking for. It did get a little tastier the next day. It was still sort of spicy hot, yet bland. Maybe I should have used regular coconut milk, instead of the light version? Will keep tinkering with this to get the flavor I amk looking for.

As written, I thought it was really flavorless, and so I tweaked it alot (more lime, some fish sauce, red pepper flakes, a TON more red paste). Also, I hate the texture of rice noodles so I used broken up angel hair pasta. Husband wasn't keen on the spinach either. This was ok but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

I made this soup with tofu instead of shrimp and omitted the cilantro.  It was just ok.  I was a little disappointed actually because it sounded so good and the reviews were great.  It may have been the red curry I used - I know it makes a difference.  I just bought the first one I could find at the grocery store...
I don't think I'll make this again.

I love this soup!!!  I usually only make vegetarian soups though so i exclude the shrimp from the pot.  I make this every time my boyfriend travels for work, and I eat it all week long.  It's a great thing to come home and look forward to.

AWESOME!  There are NO Thai restaurants around here and we miss curry soup... this turned out sooo good.  I didn't have baby spinach, could only find green curry paste, used veggie broth and tofu to make it vegetarian and added a bit more coconut milk.  Thought it was too salty when I first tasted it, but when the noodles are added it is PERFECT!  Such a good recipe, my husband and I loved it.  Thanks!

Very interesting soup. It's definitely a soup for spinach-lovers. The only two substitutions I made were rice for the rice noodles, and a chicken breast cut up in bite-sized pieces, in place of the shrimp. I used mild red curry paste, but you may want to spice it up a bit. Found a 3 oz. frozen container of chopped lemon grass (also called "Sa Bam") at an oriental food store for about $1.50 .

This was really good.  I used chicken and different veggies for my personal taste.  I like that you can easily substitute what you like.  I will make it a little spicier next time, too.
