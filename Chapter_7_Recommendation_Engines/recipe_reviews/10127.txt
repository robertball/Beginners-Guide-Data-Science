At first, I thought this wasn't going to turn out.  I had made the mix a week ahead, and it was a solidified hunk when I got it out.  I microwaved each cup of mix for about 30 seconds, and it got soft again.  The cookies were so good I had to make extras for me and my husband! (Was making them for a cookie exchange at work).  I am going to se the leftover mix to try some of the other recipes, I was able to get about 28 cookies out of each batch instead of 12.

These cookies are ok but not great. They're not very sweet at all. I'll add regular white sugar to them the next time.

These are a pretty good cookie!  Not too sweet, but I used natural peanut butter, not one with sugar in it.  These cookies are nice and soft and stay that way.  I also used butter, not shortening because I never keep shortening around.  Super easy when you've got the make-ahead mix ready to go!  Will make again!
