I made these today. We thought they were very good. I liked the dates, chocolate flavors with the Bite of chocolate chips and a little cinnamon.   A soft cookie and chewy.  I thought the flavors were great. 

I thought they were sweet enough without the adding sugar. 

I  used pecans because I was short of walnuts and I didnâ€™t want to go to the store. 

I will make them again.

My daughter liked them very much, as they aren't quite as sweet as other cookies.
