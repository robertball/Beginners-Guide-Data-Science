After reading reviews I made adjustments, so I found it hard to give it the full 5 stars. This was a very tasty dish that went well with the pork tenderloin I prepared. I also served broccoli along with it. It was a nice presentation. Since so many commented on the sweetness, I cut the sugar in half. I used pineapple in its own juice, NOT the kind that has the sweetened syrup. It turned out fine...not sweet at all. I also cut the butter in half. Next time I would use just two tablespoons. I could still taste a bit of greasiness, although not bad.  I followed the directions and used a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. If you want to taste these, you will have to use more than a  pinch. We could not detect either spice in the casserole. Many reviewers said it was too eggy for them. So I used three eggs and 1/4 cup of milk. It turned out well. Cooking time was right on. I used a 2 1/2 quart casserole. It was a nice change from potatoes. Everyone who ate it, enjoyed it.

This is a new holiday staple at my house. I follow the recipe exactly, and we love it. 

Keys - use pinapple in juice, NOT syrup. Syrup will make it too sweet. 

Use good bread. I've always made it with french or italian. If you try this with Sandwich bread I expect it'd be a lot more runny/mushy. 

Mine has never been soggy, and reheats really well.

Made this as a side dish to "Marinated Pork Tenderloin" recipe also off this site, both EXCELLENT!!  And compliment each other very well.  If making this in a 9x13 pan, you will need more like 8 slices of bread in the mixture, so once its baked, it puffs up more like a stuffing, otherwise it will be too runny.  I also cube my bread, don't think that matters as much.  I also bake mine at 350 for 40 min. and that does the trick....I think 60 min. is too long.  Enjoy, this is excellent!

I doubled this recipe for a dinner party, and put everything in one large baking dish.  It was moist, fragrant, and absolutely delicious.  Even the pickiest of eaters were having seconds and thirds!

A wonderful side dish with garlic/onion pork tenderloin!  I used 1/4 pound of softened butter instead of the margarine, and only used 1/2 c. sugar.
This dish is great to prepare early in the day and refrigerate until you are ready to bake it.

I just made this recipe and it turned out great. I changed it just a little by using only 1/2 cup of sugar, more nutmeg, lots of cinnamon and instead of white bread I had some Cinnamon Raisin Swirl Bread. Now it's more like dessert! Thanks Cheryl!

Excellent recipe.  I made it for a potluck and received lots of compliments.  it is very easy and tastes great.  I used approx. 6 oz. smart balance butter, 3/4 cup splenda, 10 slices bread, 2 20 oz cans crushed dole pineapple, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon.  I baked it for about 1 1/2 hrs.  I put some sliced pineapple on top.  The batter was extremely sweet.  Once it was baked, it was a lot better. Very easy, very inexpensive to make, very good.  I recieved many compliments and 1 request for the recipe.  highly recommended.

My mother and I have been making this same recipe (minus the spices) for years and it's ALWAYS a hit. We call it "pineapple souffle," even though it's definitely NOT a souffle - it's just kind of fun to call it that (we're just goofy and from the Midwest). I read one review for this recipe that said the leftovers are terrible, but we find that it actually taste better the second day, hot or cold. We serve this only on holidays, due to the fat content (and to keep it special). It's SO easy, too.

This was a great dish for a potluck!  Easy to throw together with items I had on hand.

Tips for the next time I make it:
Tear the bread into smaller pieces.
Add more nutmeg and cinammon, I used maybe a teaspoon or two and the flavor was hardly there.
I also used pineapple chunks and squashed them, I will definetly use crushed pinapple next time.

Delicious and lovely side dish. Served it with roast chicken. Used 1/2 cup of sugar in the recipe -- it was plenty sweet. Thank you for this nice recipe.

I did make one change, I didn't have enough eggs, so I checked the substitution section of my Allrecipies cookbook and used one whole mashed banana and 1 tsp. Baking powder in place of two eggs. I took this dish to Easter dinner and it was the hit of the afternoon! Everyone asked for the recipe, bananas included!! This dish is a crowd pleaser!

This recipe is unique and fabulous.  I've made it as a side dish to pork and ham.  Don't use sandwich bread - be sure to use French Bread or Italian (or a bread with more substance than sandwich).  Increase the amount of bread to approx. 8 slices (I always estimate, since I don't use the sandwich bread, but I think 5 slices would not be enough).  I always double the recipe and use a 13x9 pan.  A great recipe, and one that is always requested of me at Easter or Christmas.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made it for the first time about a year ago and since then I have probably made it about 15 times. It's delicious and I have made it so much that my family is sick of it. I make this recipe without the cinnamon and nutmeg and it is wonderful. I definitely recommend making this!

Yum!  I used softened butter.  I also used 10 slices of white bread (crusts removed).  This was perfect for my 10x10 stoneware.  The stoneware helps the dish stay hot if you are transporting it to a potluck.

I made this today for Easter dinner. First time making baked pineapple, usually my mom makes it, but since I was hosting this year I did most of the cooking. I was very pleasantly surprised. I did take the suggestion in other reviews and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and only used 1/4 cup butter, dotting it on top, instead of mixing it in. This was delicious! Only one spoonful left and my husband gladly ate it so we could wash the pan!LOL! Thanks for the recipe!

I read all 55 reviews before trying this dish for
an Easter potluck and since only a couple were less than enthusiastic, I thought this would be a
keeper...WRONG. I followed the recipe but it was just kind of boring and I threw most of it away.
I overheard one guest describe it as "kind of weird" and I can't imagine I'll try this one again.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner as a side dish for ham.  A lot of people loved it.  I thought it was very good, but not incredible.  It's pretty easy to put together and does taste great with a bite of ham.  I guess I just thought it was a little sweet as a side dish for dinner!  It would be really good with a side of ice cream for dessert!

Used pineapple chunks because that is what I had.  Probably would use crushed next time for a fuller flavor.

This was different, but good.  It's really a pinapple flavored bread pudding.  I used slices of fresh pinapple on top for garnish and I think that helped to get people to try it.  Otherwise it doesn't look very appetizing.  I added quite a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers.  When I first pulled it from the oven I was a little disappointed because it looked greasy from the butter.  Fortunately I still had to cook another dish and I let it rest for a bit on the stove before serving and the butter seemed to soak back into the casserole.  I don't think I'll put it in rotation, but it's a nice recipe for something different.

Made this on Christmas with ham and it was wonderful!  Everyone commented on how good it was and wanted the recipe.  The only change I made to the recipe was to halve the sugar.  It was plenty.  In fact, when I told people that it was supposed to have more sugar, they all said NOOO!!!  That is why I must give it four stars.  If the recipe only asked for 1/2 cup sugar, it would get FIVE stars for sure!!  Thanks for a keeper.

I double the recipe and only use 1/2 cup sugar for a 12 serving-sized casserole, because the pineapple juice sweetens it also.  I also add two slices of bread. Make sure to cut your bread in small cubes. It's delicious cold too, like a dessert! Thank you Cheryl!!

Made this last night as one of the sides for ribs.  The only change I made was to use fresh pineapple because I didn't have canned.  I mashed up enough to make almost 2 cups and it worked fine.  I didn't think my husband would go for it but he gave it a two thumbs up!

I can't stop eating this!  It's almost a must-have with pork or ham.  I believe it would also make a YUMMY dessert served warm with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  I used 7 slices of bread, cut the sugar in half, and used 3 (jumbo) eggs.  Can't say enough good about this one - - FABULOUS!

Yummy. My husband loved this recipe. It seems like it's going to be very sweet when making it, but, the end result it isn't. Similar to a bread pudding. Two thumbs up. I've got the "go" to make this again and again and again. Thank you for the great recipe.

This is so good!  I've made it twice now and both times my guests devoured it.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe because I think it's perfect as is.  I was worried the first time I made it that it would taste too "eggy" and some people wouldn't like it, but you can't even taste the eggs.

This is a fantastic recipe. I hate to throw food out, and that includes bread. My 
family has a way of opening up a loaf of bread, eating half of it, and then 
opening up another loaf.  So I end up with lots of "somewhat stale" bread.  But 
in this recipe you would never know it....the resulting cassarole was something
people at our potluck lunch were literally scrapping off the pan it was so good!!!
I will definitely make this again...and again...and again...Thanks for sharing   :)

I really love this and will make this as often as I dare tempt myself with not eating the entire dish.  I don't lean to overly sweet foods so I followed other reviewer's suggestions and cut the sugar to 1/2c.  and butter to 1/4 c. and felt is was plenty sweet for a side dish (as written, a desert).  I also went with the 3 eggs and 1/2 c. milk.   I used up some stale French bread (5 cups of 1/2" cubes) and think the texture was better than had it been mushy yet it was plenty moist.  I used fresh pineapple and the suggestion that 2 c. was sufficient was right on.  I stuck to the pinch (1/8 tsp) of nutmeg and cinnamon and feel next time I will do a tad (1/4 tsp lol) heavier with the nutmeg.    This is wonderful yet with my changes I have to go with 4 stars, but with reduced sugar / changes, I would rate this 5 stars plus.  Wonderful, wonderful dish that will be at my next grill out.  Thanks and I think I will go have some more.

I doubled the recipe and used one whole long loaf of french bread from my grocery store's bakery. It turned out really well. I served 16 and still had about a half a pan left. Ate it for breakfast cold and it was still really good. I would up the spices next time. I also think adding raisins would be a nice touch. 

It's really a bread pudding.

I made a double batch; subbed 1 cup of brown sugar for white, subbed 6 eggs for 8, added 1 tbsp. cinnamon & nutmeg, and put some bread inside but the rest on top & topped bread with melted butter. Came out delicious!

We were having a Luau at work today, and I made this casserole....but edited it a little: I cut the sugar in half.  I diced a can of spam, and cooked it on the stove, then after I tore the bread apart, I put the bread in the casserole dish, and then sprinkled the cooked spam over it, and then poured the pineapple mixture over it.    It was so good...and gone in 10 minutes....

This is a great recipe!  As you mix the ingredients together, you may sense that it needs a little more bread in order to keep it from being soupy. I usually add more bread until it seems "right!"  Not only delicious with ham, but with barbequed ribs as well.

I made this recipe yesterday for Easter dinner.  I had a total of 15 people over.  This was my very first Easter dinner, and when i saw reviews that this goes well with Ham, I figured why not give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I doubled the recipe and that worked really well.  I followed the instructions with no alterations - other than doubling everything.  i did use the cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  Everyone raved about it.  This was the one dish many people wanted the leftovers of, and there was not that much left.  It was so good, sweet but not too sweet.  It was perfect.  I would definitely make this again.

I used half the butter and sugar. This is my quick fall back dish when I need something with pork/ham for dinner or to take for potluck--everyone loves it! Plus it is sooo easy and fast. I like adding vanilla and almond extracts and cherries, topping with cracker crumbs and cheeses.

Made this for Easter to accompany ham, and everyone LOVED it!  I had several requests for the recipe!  I did make modifications after reading various reviews.  They are as follows; I used a fresh loaf of crusty french bread from the bakery, cut the sugar amount in half, used 1 tsp. of almond extract, and decorated the top with a few cherries for apperance.  I also used the optional cinnamon and nutmeg, and used butter rather than margarine.  We will be making this one again for special occasions/holidays....for sure!

What else can I say?   I listened to other reviewers and halved the margarine (I used butter) and the sugar and it came out great.  I even decorated the top with halved maraschino cherries before baking and so it looked beautiful too.  I think pineapple and cherries go together well.  I often wonder ...do the original submitters ever try their recipes with the reviewers changes and suggestions?...and what do they think?  Good one, Cheryl, Thanks.

I was looking for a new dish as I get soooo tired of the same ones everyone brings. This dish was a GREAT hit. Everyone loved it! As soon as we sat down..everyone was like "Who made the Pineapple Dish?" Hubby loved it too! It was VERY easy. Will make more often. Definitely try this one out!

I took this recipe to a camping Pot-Luck as a side dish for a Ham Dinner. Because we are tent campers, we baked this dish in a Dutch Oven.  The results were excellent!  There were 25 other campers with us and each wanted the recipe.  I'm making it again tonight to serve with a grilled ham steak.

I made this go along with baked ham. I ended up throwing the whole pan out. To my surprise after reading the reviews I thought this would be more kid friendly. They would have prefered a side of applesauce. It's always fun to try new things but this isn't something I won't be making again.

This was so wonderful that I had to make it twice for one Thanksgiving dinner because we ate the first one right out of the oven.  I had to make a second just for everyone else at dinner time.

I tried this for the first time for Easter and it was a hit. The only ratio I felt was a little off was the bread, I used a couple extra pieces. A co-worker that makes this all the time recommended letting the bread get stale before using it so I did that. She also mentioned that it turns out the same no matter what type of bread is used.  I did not feel the sugar amount made it too sweet but I did make sure the pineapple was in juice, not syrup. I agree with other reviewers that if you want to taste the cinnamon and nutmeg you need A LOT more than the recipe calls for. It does go well with ham and I will make it again.

Excellent. Made for Family for Easter.  I put it together the night before.  Put in Refrigerator.  Took out about 1 to 1 1/2 hours before putting in oven. I put cinnamon and Nutmeg in recipe.   Def. worth making again

this was great, I did not add the nutmeg and I sprinkled brown sugar on top. My family loved it and we will make it again.

Loved this recipe.  It's kind of a twist on bread pudding.   Used cubed French bread and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and some chopped pecans.   Yummy!

LOVE IT!!!  I made this for our office holiday luncheon and it was a BIG HIT!  I tried it a second time for the family and added more cinnamon and nutmeg and I think that adds a little more to the flavor.  It is sweet, so you could cut down on the sugar, but overall - it's great just as it is.  Many thanks for sharing

Just made this with the marinated pork tenderloin as so many others suggested.  Amazing!  I used a whole loaf of French bread and baked it maybe 45-50 minutes.  I had to watch it closely and covered it toward the end so the bread did not burn.  Delicious!

Reading other reviews, I doubled the amount of cinnamon & nutmeg, & used texas toast insted of regular bread.  I also added 1 TBS  of rum extract to the mixture.  It was good.

Good!  Went great with our ham dinner.  I did feel that the top was really good while the bottom was a little soggy.  Next time I'll make it in a 9x13 so it's thinner.  Great taste though!

Loved this. Only used about 1/4 cup of sugar and this was still a little too sweet for a dinner side dish. Had to bake it at the same time as the ham so I cooked it @ 325 for 90 min. It turned out great and the guests (and husband) loved it! This is a keeper.

This was the best thing at my Christmas party.  Luckily I made 2 pans of it.  My mother and I tested it and stood over the stove with spoons and kept eating it.  Make it in a shallow pan and it gets a crusty top, delicious warm or cold.

Very good.  Made without the spices and used wheat bread.  Good flavor and lightly sweet, but not too sweet.  Was a good addition to a summer potluck/picnic, and went well with the fried chicken and brats.

Quite a good side dish. I liked the crispy top. One complaint: the leftovers tasted bad. My advice: eat it all fresh from the oven and don't bother keeping the leftovers.

This was WAY better than it sounds! I had a free loaf of bread and some fresh pineapple that I needed to use up, so this seemed like a good way to do it. I cut the sugar in half and used probably 8-9 pieces of bread. I cut my fresh pineapple in small chunks (even smaller than what comes in the can). Next time I think I will use only three eggs.

Served with Pat Patty's wonderful pork tenderloin.  I had some initial doubts but family all absolutely loved it.  I used butter, a heavy hand on the spices and a soft sour dough bread.

followed the recipe exactly.  i cooked it until the top was slightly browned - over 60 minutes.  the casserole was pretty watery (probably with the pineapple juice) at the bottom and it just didnt go over well at our house.  i did cover it with foil so i dont know if that contributed to it being loose.  i can see how this would be a nice side dish with ham.  but for us, probably wont make it again.  thanks for the try!

This is good but next time I make it I will make the following changes: use 6 tbsp. butter instead of 8 because it was a bit greasy.  Use 7 slices of bread instead of 5 because I would like it a bit firmer.  I also added extra spice as we are lovers of spice.  Other than that the recipe was very good.  Even better with a little bit of canned whipping cream on top!!

I made this into a heart healthy recipe by using 1/2 cup olive oil in place of butter and whole grain bread, I also cut the sugar to 2/3 cup. It was great.  C.H. from Ohio

My husband and I both enjoyed this casserole.  (I made it to accompany the leftover AllRecipes Marinated Pork Tenderloin we had from the other day  - which we also both liked). I tweaked the casserol recipe a bit based on other reviews.  Used 1/4 cup butter rather than 1/2 cup margarine, used a total of 3/4 cup sugar; 1/2 of which was brown & the other 1/2 white, toasted 6 slices of pre-cut thick sliced French bread instead of 5 slices white.  Used all other ingredients as measured in the original recipe.  YUM!

My family was blown away by this deceptively simple recipe.  I didn't have white bread, so I used oat bread, and I also substituted butter for the margarine.  Otherwise, I added all the recommended spices and didn't alter the recipe.  I let the mixture sit a few minutes (during oven warm-up) so the eggs could seep into the bread before baking.  I paired it with teriyaki salmon and it was fabulous.  We didn't need dessert after having this with our dinner.

This is the same recipe my mom always made.  She never added the spices.  It is delicious, especially with ham.  I will try it with the spices next time.  Thanks for sharing this family favorite.

This recipe was super easy!
I added 1/4 tsp Nutmeg and 
1/2 tsp Cinnamon, and diced the bread into smaller pieces.
I used it as a dessert with tea. 
It would be great served with vanilla icecream.  Next time I will have it with sausage at brunch and will add more cinnamon.

This was really good and easy.  Went great with ham.  I used brown sugar and wheat bread which gave it a carmel flavor.  Yummy

My family is in the minority here but, I made this as a side for Christmas Dinner (ham) and it was not my extended family's cup of tea.  We all agreed the egg taste was overpowering.  We all like eggs but something about this recipe or the mix of ingredients REALLY made the egg taste stand out.  I gave it two stars for originality and it was relatively easy to make.

Wow, this was the most talked about thing on the Easter menu. Great addition and will be a standard dish with ham dinner. We had it as a compliment with the ham. I did cut down on the sugar to 3/4 cup and plenty sweet. Loved it!

Took other reviewers suggestion of using half the sugar (still used the amount of butter called for). Served it at the end of Easter dinner.  Wow!  It was wonderful, not too sweet or tart, just right.  Addicting!

This is what I did to give it my special touch.......  I doubled it for Easter dinner, which made a perfect fit for a 9x13 baking pan.  I did use the cinnamon and nutmeg, and I added a teaspoon of orange extract, but vanilla or almond might be just as nice.  I also used 1/2 stale white bread and 1/2 stale cinnamon raisin bread.  Very well received by the guests.  Fast and easy.

This is one of the best holiday side dish recipes I have used.  It is dessert-like, and goes well beside ham; it goes pretty well with turkey, too.  It is very rich.  Easy to make.

I substituted with a half cup of truvia and margarine for just under 200 calories per serving. And it still came out delicious! Also followed other's suggestion of fresh bakery Italian bread instead of plain white bread. It gave it lots of body and great taste.

I really enjoyed this.  It was very indulgent, but it would have been a perfect pairing for ham.  A friend suggested I bring it as a side to my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  Unfortunately my in-laws are not as into sweet dishes as my side of the family.  No one really had anything good to say about it.  I think it was just too sweet for their liking.  I will still make this again, but I may cut back on the eggs.  My friend said she does two egg whites and two whole eggs.  Might be a good compromise.  I also might cook it a little bit longer.  I cooked it at the full 1 hour, but I think it could have been cooked a few minutes more.

I used fresh pineapple really well mashed. We liked it but found it way too sweet. Either the fresh pineapple was the cause or you need to cut back on the sugar, like others say, by about half. I think it does need a higher quantity of spices too but overall it was a good side dish and I will be making it again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I bring this to family gatherings and dinners and it is always a hit.  There is rarely any left over, and if there is I like to warm it up, add some whipped cream and eat it as a dessert.  It really is more like a dessert than a side dish.

This was so good! I was skeptical about making it as a side dish because I thought it would be way too sweet. The only change I made was decreasing the sugar to 3/4 c. and next time I will use only 1/2 c. because it was a little sweet. Regardless, I loved it and the hard-to-please boyfriend also loved it. I served it with the Marinated Pork Tenderloin from this website and steamed green beans. Success!

Followed the recipe as written.  The flavor was good, maybe just a little too sweet for us.  We didn't care at all for the bread-pudding-ish texture.  I think it's a good dish-- just not suited for my family's likes.  Thanks, tho-- it was fun to try.

It is very delicious. I would say it would be equally as good with slightly less sugar. Other than that, an A+ recipe.

This is sooo good.  I did decrease both the butter and sugar by half.  Also, I used 3 extra-large eggs instead of 4.  Finally, I used 8 slices of honey wheat sandwich bread.  I served this with Ham Loaf I from this site.

I have made this recipe a few time now since making it for our Thanksgiving get together. I also made it for a pot luck dish at a group gathering and everyone there enjoyed this and asked about the recipe. The only thing I did different from the actual recipe was to use 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1 cup and I added 1 tsp Vanilla. This recipe is a keeper!

I was excited about this recipe, but I won't be making it again.

It was verrry pineappley and the bread was just ick. (I used sandwich wheat bread). Maybe if you use a different kind of bread...but it was very soggy and just not a good flavor. I tried it again the next day cold, and it was slightly better. Anyway, I'll pass on this one.

VERY GOOD!!! The only changes I made to the recipe were that instead of a full cup of white sugar I used 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar; and instead of regular sliced bread I found a sweet italian bread at my grocers bakery. I was even able to prepare ahead that morning by mixing all the ingredients except the bread and putting it in the refrigerator all day. When I was ready to start baking I just pulled apart my bread, added it to the mix and poured it into the casserole dish. Since this was the first time I had made this dish I was not expecting much and told everyone (grandmother, mom and sister included) it would not hurt my feelings if they did not like it. Much to my surprise, everyone loved it. There was even a little dish hogging when it was almost gone.

This recipe is so similar to one my mother got from my grandmother. We just use 3 eggs and we freeze our bread overnight and then cube it. But this is the yummiest thing ever! Great with ham or pork chops or chicken!

Our family calls this Pineapple Bread Pudding.  This has been a family favorite of ours since I was a child.  We never made it with the spices and we drain the pineapple (but not draining out every drop of juice - it needs the moisture).  It cooks in about 30 to 40 minutes (until lightly browned on top)and it is WONDERFUL!!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I thought the idea of pineapple, eggs and cinnamon sounded kind of unusual but after reading through some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I took some of the suggestions I saw and cut the butter and the sugar. I used brown sugar and wheat bread instead and tried using 2 eggs and 2 egg whites also to help cut the cholesterol. It turned out great and I served it with ham as well. My husband kept YUM-ing through the whole meal! Thanks!

I really liked this. I cut the sugar and butter in half like others suggested. I used Smart Balance instead of butter. Maybe I would add just a tiny bit more sugar but my husband didn't think it needed it.

Wow! Very Good... I did not have crushed pineapple so I just used canned and crushed my own. I used a french bread in place of the white loaf bread. And I double the receipe for a potluck Hawaiian theme. It was all gone!

i was a little skeptical about this recipe - but tried it anyway.  we loved it.  i used 7-grain bread, 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the butter that the recipe called for. i made it with the marinated pork loin (as suggested) and it was a great combination.

ok, I read all the similar recipes and this one got the highest ratings but very few people made it as written, I only made half the recipe...I used 1/4c sugar and 3tbs butter(for 1/2recipe) it was still a bit greasy I would recommend cutting butter in half. It was a bit eggy I shouldve followed others advice and only used 1egg.I left out the spices. If I made it again I would probably use brown sugar. It reminded me of pineapple upside down cake.

This was excellent!  I had tried a recipe before w/ pineapple chunks and cheese, and this was much better.  I did double the recipe, but still only used 1/2 c butter and 1 c sugar.  It was more than sweet enough.  Excellent recipe though---thanks!!!

O Man, is this stuff good!!!  I've never had a pineapple casserole, so I really don't have anything to compare it with, but to me, it's more like a dessert - bread pudding to be exact!  I couldn't get enough of this stuff - very sweet, but I like it sweet!!
It also has to be one of the most easiest recipes I ever made too- Everything was already in my cupboard!  Enjoy this one!! YUMMY!!!

This was very good except there was too much butter. I used half the sugar and slightly toasted my bread and threw in some pineapple tidbits. Next time I'll try to double this using 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c each of sugar and splenda. I think egg beaters would work well too.

I made this for a potluck at work and everyone asked for the recipe,it's alittle different from the pineapple casseroles I've made in the past. I did like others,and cut back on the sugar by half. I also added cheddar cheese on top, because I've always had cheese on my casserole and everything is better with cheddar.

My husband and I loved this. Went great with a pork tenderloin I made tonight (see reviews). I can see how it would go well with ham also so I think I will serve this at Thanksgiving. It was extremely easy to prepare and I loved the fact that it was something "different." Next time, I think I will reduce the butter I only use butter, never margarine) to 1/3 or 1/4 of a cup. I also slightly reduced the sugar to 2/3 of a cup. I think 1/2 cup would be fine.

This dish was alright, not exactly our favorite but it wasn't bad either.  The consistency and texture of the dish was a little bizarre.  The flavor was good though, although I will probably drain out some of the pineapple juice next time since it came out a little too sweet for our tastes.

Simple and easy.  Very, very good.  Delicate flavoring.  Not as sweet as I was expecting from some of the reviews - but that was to the good.  Will definitely make it again.

Made this and loved it!  But I also have a bit of a sweet tooth, and I thought this could even be considered dessert, instead of a side dish.  But it was excellent!  Will make it again and again.  Thank you.

My sister made this recipe for a family dinner and boy was it a hit. It went great with ham. My brother couldnt get enough...he kept piling it ontop of his ham slices. It was gone in a flash.Cooking is not one of her favorite things(e.g.fathers day pancakes, and silver dollar hamburgers)but she pulled this one off with no trouble whatsoever.

I made this casserole the Christmas Eve night so I wouldn't have to make it Christmas Day.  My husband dug into it that night and ate a quarter of it!  It was really delicious and went well with our pork dinner.

I was sceptical of how it would turn out, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results!  We had ham instead of turkey this year, and this recipe was a wonderful accompaniment.  It tasted sort of like a pineapple bread pudding, and was an absolute hit at the dinner table!

My mom's recipe is so much better. It tastes better with the bread on top and crusted instead of mixed in and soggy.

Instead of bread I used cinnamon raisin bagels. 3 bagels (6 halves) torn up works perfectly. The final product had a perfect bread pudding consistency. I served it with vanilla ice cream as a dessert and it was a huge hit. will definitely make again.

This turned out great. Many compliments.
When I make it again I'm using more pineapple. 1 can just wasn't enough. It's only a 20 oz can and the recipe did call for 30 oz.

I made it exactly as called for, and it was delicious!  It was totally gone at our family Christmas Eve potluck—everyone loved it. It was sweet without being too sweet. Will be adding this to my casserole repertoire, especially since it was the easiest casserole I’ve ever made!

Just made this for Easter dinner. All my family loved it but thought it would be better as dessert rather than a side dish. Only change was that I used 1/2 the sugar and it was perfect. Very easy and no fuss. Will definitely make again.

I used whole grain white sandwich bread which I tore into small pieces the night before and let sit out. I halved the sugar and butter, used 5 eggs instead of 4, and added 1 tsp each of the spices. I cooked it for 90 minutes and it was not soggy or dry, not too sweet if served with salty ham, but too much for me served alone. Most people at Easter dinner considered this a pineapple flavored bread pudding. It turned out the way it was meant to, but I probably won't make it again.

This turned out really well for our Easter ham dinner and everyone liked it.  I used less than 1/2 cup sugar, and I used 8 slices of pepridge farm hearty white bread, crusts cut off.  I let it bake to get a little brown on top around edges and it fluffed up nicely.  Will make again!!

My family has been making a different version of this for years.  Traditionally, we put the egg/pineapple mixture on the bottom of the pan.  We then butter the bread, cut it into cubes, and put it on top of the pineapple/egg mixture.  We do not usually mix the bread and pineapple/egg together.  So I tried the recipe this way, and about half said they liked it better this way, and half said they liked it better the other way.  I also added cinnamon which was new to us.  Some said it tasted too much like a dessert bread pudding instead of our traditional buttery bread side dish.  I personally liked this recipe and the cinnamon.  I'm sure I will make it again.  If you like soggy bread, like French toast, you'll like this.  But try it my way too.

I have made my version of this recipe for years now and it has been a family favorite. But I never use a large amount of sugar. Two or three tablespoons are quite adequate and give more weight to the salty than the sweet quality of this unique dish.

Really good!  I halved the sugar and butter and used 3 eggs with 1/4 cup of milk per the #1 reviewer and it turned out great.  This was a surprisingly familiar recipe that I remember from my childhood, or something very similar.  I don't remember my mother making it so I'm thinking I'm remembering it from a church pot luck possibly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy to make and a great side dish to any pork or ham dinner. I made this for the first time yesterday for Easter dinner. It was a  hit at my house. My 3 year old son is extremely finicky and he loved it. The changes I made to the receipe were to use crisco instead of butter and ciabatta bread. I will definitely make this at my company potlucks.

I made this last night.  It was my first time trying this dish.  I have always wanted to find some ways to enjoy pineapple besides just eating it by itself.  I really like this dish. I just could not use cheese, I guess because I want it to be a dessert, so I had whip cream with it.  I used only about 2 eggs, & it still came out fine. I also lessened the white sugar, as I do with most recipes.  I used about a tablespoon of white sugar, 3 to 4 tablespoons of brown sugar, & 2 lil packs of Truvia sugar, plus cinnamon & nutmeg, so it was sweet enough. I used whole grain white bread, & it was fine. Maybe 1 day if I prepare it for others, I will add the cheese. Thanks for this recipe.

Never had anything like this before but thought I would try with molasses pork loin.  It was pretty good but not sure the kids really cared for it.  I would eat it again but it's just not something we would have often.  If you like pineapple though it is very tasty.

This was delicious! followed the recipe but used a chewy 7 grain bread and easily doubled the spices. Everyone loved this. Leftovers were great for breakfast.

This is exactly what I was looking for! The local BBQ restaurant serves a "Pineapple Hot Dish" and I could not figure out how to make it. I gave this recipe a shot, tripling the recipe for a 9x13 pan and it came very close to the dish I was attempting to mimic. This dish reminded me more of a bread pudding but I absolutely loved it. It was a little on the sweet side but not too much that I would cut the sugar back next time.

FYI - This is one of those dishes that is caught in an identity crisis (it's considered a side but sweet enough to be a dessert).

Even people who don't like sweet side dishes LOVE this!  It is a staple in our house with ham for the holidays. I do use butter instead of margarine and add 3 more slices of bread than the recipe calls for but the flavor is wonderful.

OOOOOOOH! Can I have this every night please??? I wasn't sure if this was going to be so sweet, it should be the dessert instead of a side at the dinner table but it is the perfect accompiment to pork and chicken at dinnertime!

Delicious!  My husband requested a pineapple casserole when I had his family over for Christmas, and I didn't have a good recipe for it.  Look no further, this is it!  I can't believe that some people said this wasn't good as leftovers, it's SO good the next day.  The only changes I made is that I halved the sugar, used Italian bread, and increased the nutmeg and cinnamon.

This recipe is more of a sweet side, but very good.  It would go excellent with ham or pork chops.  Also would be good with a caramel or chocolate sauce and ice cream for desert.

I served this alongside the Burgundy Pork Tenderloin from here on AR.  It was very good but I did make some changes to try to lighten it up some.  I only used 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c sugar. Also I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg...I thought it would taste to "desserty".  I sprayed the baking dish with cooking spray first.  Very good

This is awesome!!  My Grandma used to make this when I was a kid and I always wondered how she did it.  I cna't imagine not using the cinnamon and nutmeg.  It really adds to the casserole.  I've made this for friends and family and it disappears.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I really really liked this.  the bread pudding-esque texture combines very well with the crushed pineapple.  my boyfriend and I first ate this as a dessert and I think it would be good with vanilla ice cream although I've been eating the leftovers for breakfast!
used frozen sweet bread dough, that I baked into a loaf, half a cup of sugar, and no spices (my bf doesn't like cinnamon).  next time I will use a 1/4 cup of butter to make it a bit more health conscious.

It was good, but not really a side dish.  More of a dessert, if it had a sauce to go on top.  I don't think it would get requested again by my family.

Yummmy, yummy, yummy! This was great when paired with the maple pork tenderloin. After my 5yr old daughter tasted it she said I was THE best cook ever. LOL thanks for the great recipe! I will use this often.

This was okay--it was nice for something different. Like other reviewers, I made some changes: I used hamburger buns instead of bread and reduced the sugar (1/4 cup of white and 1/2 brown) and the margarine (3/4 of a stick). I also crumbled Ritz crackers and sharp cheddar on top to make it more savory, but it was still too much like bread pudding to serve as a side for my taste. Also, it didn't reheat well, so I'd recommend making it when you have a large crowd.

This was okay, but not as good as I expected.  Hubby didn't care for it at all.  If I try it again, I'm definitely going to serve it with ham and cut the butter in half.

This recipe was quick and easy and reminded me of pineapple upside down cake. My son did not like it. Probably due to the consistancy which was mushy. I thought it was good.

I made this the other night for a BBQ and it was the one thing everyone had seconds on!  I used left over buns from the freezer and they were fine!  This is a keeper!!!

I thought this was good. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet, but it turned out great. I think if I make this again, I will make it for a gathering versus just for my husband and I. He was not too fond of the texture.

It doesn't sound like it would be good, but it is!  A great alternative to traditional stuffings (which is really what it is!)  I melt the butter first, use a little more cinnamin and no nutmeg, and I make it in a bigger pan, since my family likes the crunchy part on the top!  This is an often asked for dish in my house!

Just OK.  I made this for something different with my Christmas ham, and it didn't really excite anyone.  I was remembering a different kind of baked pineapple from my childhood, that may have been made with saltines rather than bread ... think I need to keep looking.

For Thanksgiving, I prepared this dish and EVERYONE (even those who don't care for pineapple) enjoyed it!  The dish was empty!  It would make a great substitute for 'Pineapple Upside-down Cake'.

At first I thought the combination of ingredients sounded a bit strange, but it was very good! It was quite sweet so I will use less sugar next time. It tastes good cold too.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I thought it was "average".  I am very impressed that those strange ingredients could make something that tasted so good, but it was only good, not great.  The flavor of all those eggs was very strong and the texture reminded me of quiche.  I enjoyed how simple and fast this recipe was to make and I can see making it again sometime in a pinch.  Thank you for sharing, it's always nice to put something different on the table.

A friend told me this was her Grandmothers secret recipe, so I was suprised to see it on allrecipes.  My family and I love this casserole.  It's a tradition to have it with Easter Ham dinner.  It's super easy and everyone loves it.  My mom has an extra helping instead of desert.  Enjoy

This was GREAT!  Instead of bread slices, I used 2 leftover hamburger buns.  I served it with a pork roast and it was a nice complementary dish.  I've already been asked to make it for Easter!

I've never had anything like this.  It was pretty good.  It could be eaten as a side dish or dessert.  I also used 1/2 cup sugar and it was sweet enough.  Next time I will also decrease the amount of butter.  I used wheat bread instead of white, since that is all I buy and it tasted good.  Next time I make a ham I'll be making this!

I had never had pineapple casserole before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I mixed it all up in my food processor and it came out very smooth with no texture. I'm pretty sure that's not how it is suppose to be but it was tastey anyway. Even the leftovers were good the next day. I'll make this again without using the food processor and see how it turns out. I think I'll add a few finely chopped pecans the next time too.

Super - my guy LOVES! pineapple - so this dish made him happy.  It was easy to make and the only change I made was to cut back a "little" on the sugar.  This is a definite keeper - I served it with a pork roast.

Great flavor, fun for something different.  I though it was pretty strong though, next time I'm going to add more bread to try and bland the flavor a little bit.  Worth trying though, thanks!

Most excellent!

I make this all the time now and why not, it's just about as easy and boiling water and much tastier.

I also add coconut to this and well as add much more nutmeg and cinnamon, but that's why I like. You really can't go wrong with this.

although I really liked this dish, I found it to be way too greasy--I liked the buttery flavor but it is too much of a good thing.  if I make it again, I will cut down on the butter.
