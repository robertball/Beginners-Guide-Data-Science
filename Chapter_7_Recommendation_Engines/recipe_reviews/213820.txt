Quick, easy, and yummy even without the unsweetened shredded coconut which I couldn't find at the store.  The tapioca, surprisingly, was cooked in roughly five minutes or so, not 25-30 minutes.  Yeah!  I would have liked it better with only 3/4 cup of sugar, but you decide. I also put in the whole can of coconut cream, but one cup probably would have been fine.  I added a beaten  egg when the tapioca was still slightly hot because I wanted to make sure the pudding would be thick enough.  I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla.
