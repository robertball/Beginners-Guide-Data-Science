I have been making and eating this salad for years. This is a good recipe to start, but don't be afraid to try other flavors of Raman. Also, try adding more veggies. Broccoli slaw works well alone or with the coleslaw, chop up some celery for more crunch. Diced peppers, cucumber, radishes, etc. I think you get the point. Use whatever you like to eat. The other variable is the vinegar. There are many different flavors of vinegar. If you are like me, you will never eat the same salad twice.

Simple salad to put together, but, very flavorful.  The topping of ramen noodles, sesame seeds, & almonds gave it a nice crunch.  The only thing I didn't like was that it was slightly oily.  Other than that a very tasty salad.

Made this just as stated.  I felt something was missing .    I tried some low sodium soy sauce and increased sugar to 3 Tbs.
Much better.  Will def make again.  My company liked it too

I have made this for years, but I add a can of drained mandarin oranges and one pound of chicken tenders, chopped into bite size and sauteed to make it a meal instead of a side dish. I also use apple cider vinegar vs white and the Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles vs the Chicken Flavor.  Always a hit!

I used rice wine vinegar instead and added some soy sauce. Cut back on the oil as well.

Not sweet enough.  Had tried another recipe for this salad and found it much more Asian tasting.  The vegetable and topping mixture was very good, but the dressing was lacking.  Won't make again.

LOVE this summer salad!!! So easy and it's delicious!  I forgot to get almonds so I used walnuts instead and tossed in a handful of dried cranberries.  It was a big hit with my family!!!  Even better the next day!

The salad part was good but the dressing was lacking. I think the white vinegar needs changed and there was too much dressing for the 1 bag of slaw. I may make it again but not this exact recipe.

This is a flavorful salad. I like to make it with the oriental ramen packet.   Also I make it the night before so it absorbs the flavors

I have used a lot better recipes for this.  This one didn't have much taste, didn't really like it.  I think it is better with beef flavor.  Would not make it this way again.

I used 4 T cider vinegar and equal amounts of sugar. Much better .  Don't add the crunch in until right before serving.
