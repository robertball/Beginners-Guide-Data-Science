I made this fora brunch and to be honest I was making them as a joke. Well Th joke was on me. Everyone loved them. I did find that I only needed to bake them for 10 mins. Since I have had to make these cookies twice in the last week because my family loves them.

This is a great recipe. I did  replace the white flour whith wheat flour...bran flakes instead of corn flakes, and frozen blueberries instead of raisins. My kids are very picky with what they eat. But not with the breakfast cookies.... they just couldn't get enought of them

These were different, but in a good way.  I did decrease the sugar to 1/2c and I used dried cranberries rather than raisins just because we prefer them. Although all oven temps differ, I found that I only needed to bake for about 8 to 10 minutes.  Just watch them closely!

My kids loved these I did replace the raisins with choc. chips since I hate raisins. They are not bad but very crunch, maybe I cooked them too long. They are very yummy.

These are wonderful. I made them this morning and I will make them often. I did not have any bacon so I used sausage. my kids can't believe I made them cookies for breakfast. I also used frosted flakes since I did not have any corn falkes they were a little sweet so I would try it with just corn flakes or less sugar next time.

I have have made many recipes from this site but this is my first review, had to share.

have fun!

I made exactly according to recipe. This didn't make 12, more like eight big cookies. I didn't care for them but my boys flipped for them. They ate every single one, including mine! I'll make it again, for them. NOTE: Next time, I might try dried apples. My husband thought that might be better than raisins.

Like a couple others said, watch your cooking time. These don't need more then 10 minutes in my experiences. Try them! I'l be honest, I was kind of grossed out but then I thought, hey! Some of my favorite recipes here are the ones I thought were a bit odd. These were delicious. Thanks for sharing:)

WONDERFUL!  These were surprisingly filling and stuck with us for several hours and through yard work!  (2.5 cookies each)  Made ours with wheat flour, less sugar (part brown and part white), raisin bran, some dried cherries, and half the bacon...most changes were due to what was on-hand.  Agree with other reviewers to cut the baking time to 11-12 minutes.  The dough seemed quite dry, so I added some V8 fusion - probably unnecessary.  (I'm not much of a baker - even cookies - and am easily spooked!)   Our batch made 11 cookies.  I can easily see myself making these for road trips, flights, over-night company, etc.  Thank you!

So very yummy!  I used raisin bran, but picked out most of those raisins, and only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour.  Next time I think I'll use even less sugar.  I also discovered that I *did* need to cook them for at least 15 minutes.  Definitely making these again though!

I had to try these because of all the reviews.  They are pretty good.  My 3 year old loved them.  My 5 year old didn't care for the bacon though (I think he was expecting a typically sugary sweet cookie which this is not).  I did have to make some subs: I used about 6 tbsp of Costco's crumbled bacon, used 1/4 cp raisins and 1/4 mini chocolate chips and Envirokids Amazon frosted flakes (which gave the cookies an extremely chewy texture).  All in all, an interesting idea for breakfast if you want to try something different.

I don't even like bacon and thought these were amazing! Especially when they are still warm. I used maple bacon, and by the time I was done my whole house smelled amazing. The recipe, as is, will make 12 large cookies, but I would recommend making them smaller to snack on. Also, they only need 10-12 minutes at the most.

Amazing! We used four extra thick slices of bacon and added Raisin Bran instead of cornflakes and raisins. They turned out to be very good cookies. One batch is breakfast 3 times for my family of four. We will be making this again really soon!

We really liked these.  I hate raisins, so I subbed choco chips instead, and reduced the sugar down to 1/2 cup (brown sugar) and I still thought they were really sweet.  I will reduce the choco chips to 1/3 cup and see how that helps, but they were still really good, and very filling.  Made 18 good size cookies!

Such a nostalgic surprise to see this recipe on the internet!  They are soooo yummy! I have been making these cookies for myself, family, friends for various occasions since 1974 when I discovered the recipe in Seventeen magazine.  That smudged-up cutting from the magazine has now passed to my daughter, but I know she'll prefer this online option.  I've doubled the recipe with no problems, but I have had some problems making them at high altitudes--I never seem to make the right adjustments.  I would not recommend any substitutions.  I've tried turkey bacon (to lessen the guilt) and it's too tough in texture.  I've also tried Raisin Nut Bran instead of the cornflakes, but the cookies were more dense.  The cornflakes are truly the perfect match with the bacon and raisins.

I made these using whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar to !/2 cup and used brown sugar. Also I used bacon from our local butcher shop! As oven varies, I found baking them for ten minutes was sufficient. Absolutely delicious, will make them again!

I was looking for something super tasty and easy for my husband to take to work for breakfast. When I saw that there was bacon in it, I just had to give them a try. They are SO good. We both love them, and I don"t usually care for bacon. We do use maple bacon instead of regular. This has become our everyday breakfast.

Call me crazy, but these did not taste good at all.  The ingredients just contrast too much in taste and not in a good way.  I made them exactly like the recipe said and I took one bite and my husband took one bite and we had cereal for breakfast that morning. I don't even know what I would change to make it better. Sorry.

Don't be afraid of the list of unlikely ingredients!  They meld together like magic!  Bacon cookies -- who knew?!  And these really are cookies, & didn't turn out like biscuits as we thought they might.  I made the batter the night before so I could easily pop them in the oven the following morning.  The kids LOVED them!

Surprisingly good!  I did use Oscar Mayer bacon pieces rather than heating the house more with cooking bacon on stove top, next time I will change recipe from raisins to dried cherries.  Next time neighbors will get a taste, too!

I've made them several times now and each time they disappear without a trace.  I get about 20 medium sized cookies out of each batch so it's well worth making double.  I made  a double batch and wrapped them 2 each in plastic wrap and then put prewrapped cookies in one large freezer bag. This way, the children can go get a cookie bundle, toss it into their book bag and at snack time they have a delicious homemade cookie.  My DH has taken them to work and I've shared this recipe with everyone in his office.  They are even better when left to sit in an airtight cookie jar overnight .  Can't say how they'd be after a day or so because they simply don't last that long in this house!   Louise, thank you for sharing!!

Tried these for a family brunch, doubling the recipe and using half white and half brown sugar and fresh blueberries instead of dried cranberries. They were well received, although I personally was not crazy about them (I think the twice-cooked bacon was a little strong for my tastes). The doubled recipe yielded three or four dozen when using a scoop of approx. 1.5 tbsp size. The fresh berries made the dough a little soft but it baked fine. If I make these again, I will try whole wheat flour and oats, as others have suggested, and maybe cut back on the sugar some to make them a bit healthier.

This sounded so bizzare I had to make it! It was good... reminded me of a chewy granola bar. They are very filling and the breakfast items in the cookie added to the interest and unique flavor. I would make these to take on a hiking trip or an outing as a snack. Thanks for the interesting recipe!

I doubled the recipe, omitted raisins, and added 1/2 cup each of walnuts, craisins, chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. I used precooked ready to serve bacon.  I got about 4-5 dozen. Very good.

My daughter chose this recipe for a cooking lesson. We replaced the raisins with blueberries as suggested and the results were amazing!  She thinks we should reduce the sugar next time.  We also crushed the cornflakes before adding.

I was really hesitant to make these with the bacon in them but I was plesantly surprised. I did not have corn flakes so substituted 2 cups of Great Grains Raisins Dates & Pecans Cereal and eliminated the 1/2 cup raisins from the original recipe. I haven't gotten reviews from the family but anticipate they will like them. They will make a great quick breakfast along with coffee/milk or juice. Good cookie!

These were a hit at brunch! I used 4 bacon strips and no raisins. The bacon was still perfectly strong- I think more would have been overwhelming. 

The cornflakes in the center part of the cookie were chewy/soggy- and the outside ones were awesomely crunchy! Next time I would make the cookies much smaller, for more crispy cornflakes.

Instead of cornflakes, I used Post Blueberry morning cereal. It had blueberries, almonds, multi grain flakes and clusters. 12 min. on the time was enough. 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Good stuff!

I love these cookies.  I use less sugar (1/2 cup) and dried cranberries instead.  I always have to double the recipe or more because people love them so much.  I usually make them to take to people's house as it's dangerous for me to have them at home.

This is a surprisingly good cookie, that apparently stands up to substitutions.  Due to lack of non-hydrogenated margarine, I substituted canola oil. Also didn't have enough raisin bran or brown sugar.  I found the mixture to be dry this way, so I used these amounts: 1/2 cup + one tbsp oil, 2 eggs, 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup raisin bran, 1 cup quick oats, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 6 bacon strips.  I baked this for 9 - 10 minutes. Made 20 cookies, 1 heaping tbsp in size.  I will make it the above way again, because it was delicious and  I like the health benefits of the added oats.  Would definitely use all brown sugar to equal 1/2 cup if I hadn't run out.  It could even stand less, maybe just a little over 1/3 c.   Thanks for this great idea!

Had a half box of cornflakes that was not being eaten and  I found this recipe.  These are surprisingly good. I did make two adjustments: less sugar (1/2 cup) and 1/2 the amount of bacon.  My kids were excited about "Cookies" for breakfast!

***** I wish there were more stars!!!!!!!!!!  I saw these and I just had to try them. They just came out of the oven and they are so good. I am in the process of making another batch (this time doubled) so I don't have to make lunch before I go to work. Oh, my husband and I are sitting here thinking of all the possibilities. Bacon, Hamburger, and cheese would make an awesome bacon cheese burger flavor. I wish I would have found these before we took our trip this summer, we drove 7,700 mile, these would have been way better then have PB&J's everyday.

I made these and took them into work. I'm really glad I doubled the recipe as they were *very* popular! People kept stopping by to try the bacon cookies and then came back for seconds. :)

You'd think that the bacon would overwhelm everything, yet you can still taste all the different flavors (raisins, corn flakes) and it's not overwhelming. Well balanced and yummy!

I've made this a couple of times since I found it.  Both times I made this with raisin bran cereal instead of the corn flakes. Otherwise I followed the directions to the letter. You do need to flatten the cookies on the baking sheet since they do not spread much. Be careful of offering these out tho, I did have a couple of friends that are allergic to pork.
Once people get over the idea of bacon in their cookies, they all raved over them.
