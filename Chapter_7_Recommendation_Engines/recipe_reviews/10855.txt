The BEST sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. I have a suggestion however...mix your baking powder and salt with only 3 cups of the flour and add that first, then gradually add more flour until you have a proper dough consistency. I only needed 5 cups flour in total - not 7. The flavour of these cookies is outstanding! The dough rolls out nicely and it is so easy to cut out shapes and transfer to the cookie sheet. They have a wonderful texture once baked and cooled, and hold up beautifully while decorating. My intention was to cut out "ghost" shapes for Halloween, and then stick the sticks in some sort of foam graveyard I made, but I couldn't find proper cookie sticks in the time crunch I was in. I just cut out ghost and bat shapes and decorated with frosting and coloured sugars. Can't wait for Christmas now! LOVE this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing it!

I was a bit worried about these cookies on a stick. They felt so heavy and hard. After I had them frosted I counted how many I needed and  I had a few extra so, I tasted one...they were very good ( I ate the whole thing). The cookie itself is not sweet at all but, it is very tender. The frosting or icing makes them sweet. 
We will make these again.
thanks for the idea!

This recipe really stood the kid test. When I decided to make cookies on a stick for children to decorate at a Spring party, I was afraid that the cookies might fall apart as the children decorated them.  This recipe was sturdy enough to resist breakage from the toughest little hands. The cookies were not too hard either.  They had a great taste.

This is the only cookie dough I use for all my holiday cookies.  The only change I made was switching the butter flavored extract with vanilla, or sometimes almond.  Kudos!

I have just used this recipe to make '6' shaped cookies for my sons birthday party.  I didn't follow the method given, I just threw all the ingredients into my food processor and then put it in a bag in the fridge for a couple of hours.  When I got it out I sprinked flour on before I rolled it and it has made wonderful biscuits.  They puff up a bit so they shouldn't be put too close together on the baking tray.  I have iced then with glace icing and they are lovely.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Just one thing, I am British and have never heard of butter flavoured extract so I just left it out!  I used caster sugar for white sugar and plain flour for all-purpose flour.

Not only did this recipe taste wonderful,
the cookies stood up to the kids' decorating fun. And, this recipe also 
divides fabulously. EDITED: This is our go-to decorating cookie. This is the dough I make for Bumpa to come over and bake cookies with the kids. They hold up well while rolling out/cutting, bake up beautifully and they hold icing well, if that makes sense. Plus, they taste FANTASTIC.

Thanks for all of your compliments cooks! 

Andrea - I think maybe you cooked them too long. This cookie definitely should not get hard - they are firm, yet soft. All ovens are different. Maybe try a little less flour. It's also easy to overwork your dough if you are rolling it in too much flour.  Good luck on your next try!

ADDITIONAL COMMENT:  I have gone to using the clear Mexican vanilla in my Royal Icing - unbelievable taste and smell -- No one can eat just one!!!

I didn't do the craft, just made the cookies with my 2 1/2 year old daugheter.  The only complaint I have is that they were very hard and we tend to like them a touch softer (not too soft though!).  Maybe I baked the too long?  Anyway, I agree with another review that they passed the kid test!  My little daughter had a great time cutting animal shapes out of this dough - which was so easy to make.  I halfed the recipe, due to a lack of enough butter in the fridge, but it made MORE than enough cookies!  lol  Also, I didn't have butter extract, so I just did additional vanilla.  I bet it's good with the butter flavor though....  :-)

This is my standard sugar cookie recipe.  I half it often and it turns out perfectly every time.  They are delicious and if you roll them out to 1/4 of an inch, they are soft inside and crisp on the edges.  I don't do the lollypop sticks, too much trouble for me!  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at cut-out cookies. They were super easy and SO GOOD! Very sturdy, my 2 yr old helped me frost them and didn't break one! After I put them in a tupperware they moistened up nicely and were soft and delicious! I didn't have any butter extract so added almond in it's place and got many compliments on the flavor it added. Looking forward to all holidays to make this cookie again.

Very good. I also sandwiched the stick between two 1/4" cookies before baking and baked about 12 minutes.

Great tasting cookie! The one hint that I read somewhere is NOT to use flour if your dough is sticky- use powdered sugar. It doesn't add to the sweetness and it doesn't make the dough tough. I also make my cookies thicker, about 3/4" to allow for the lollipop stick. Thanks!

As many have said already. This is the BEST sugar cookie dough recipe EVER. I have made these cookies multiple times and each time I make them the cookie plate is empty. I have also tried cookies on a stick and found that shish kabob sticks work well for that. Also this recipe makes a LOT of dough, I use what I need and then freeze the rest.

Excellent cut out cookie. Very sturdy and extremely minimal spreading. I followed the recipe with the exception of only needing 6 cups of flour.  Half of the cookies I put sticks in, the other half I just baked.  I used bamboo skewers.  I cut them in half with a new, clean pair of rose pruners and sanded the cut edges with a new, clean sanding sponge to eliminate any rough edges.  I rolled my dough to 1/4" thick and got exactly fifty 3" cookies.  I iced them with Sugar Cookie Icing from this site.  It's the perfect taste combination and the icing dries shiny and "hard" to the touch, while remaining "soft" when you bite into it.  This flavor of this recipe could easily be altered by adding 1-2 tsp. of different flavorings such as almond, lemon, etc.    To make rolling easier, I put a tea towel (flour sack towel) on my counter and sprinkle with flour. Then I roll my dough out on this.  It completely eliminates the dough sticking.

Fabulous! I made exactly as written and they were great.  It was hard to pick a cookie recipe but I'm glad I chose this one.  I divided the dough into 3 smaller parts to roll out, and when one section got too soft, I put it in the freezer and worked another section.  These cookies were AMAZING!  Now I just have to find an icing I like.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  I'll never try another!

This is a delicious recipe.  Although, my cookies did lose their shape a little.  I'm not sure how to rectify this.  I tried freezing before baking and still to no avail. So if you aren't worried or fussy about your cookie losing it's shape, this cookie is for you.

This will be my go-to sugar cookie recipe. The dough was easy to work with, roll out and cut. The cut-outs kept their shape when baking and did not spread out or puff up! And they tasted better than any other sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. I used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe from this website to frost, which was also a 5-star recipe.

I normally don't gush over recipes, but this idea is one that is deserving.  When I saw this recipe, I knew that this is what I was going to make for my kids' end of the year gifts.  I made the dough the night before to chill and removed it from the fridge about 30 minutes before using.  I did cut the recipe in half and it yielded the perfect amount of cookies.  Even when I am not making cookies to put into pots, I will use this dough as my sugar cookie recipe.  The dough was delicious and rolled perfectly.  I am not a professional decorator, and my cookies didn't look as great as some of the photos posted, but they still looked cute enough - my kids felt proud to present it to their teachers and the teachers loved them.  I will make this again for gifts and hopefully my cookie decorating will only improve with time.  Thank you for such a wonderful idea as well as a great tasting cookie!

This is a soft dough but firms up when chilled.  I made a half batch and got about 5 dozen medium-sized cut-outs.  I used 1-1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and almond extract and my cookies are really tasty but next time I will increase that to 2 tsps. each for extra flavor.  Overall, a great dough!

Thank you Laura for giving me the sugar cookie cut out recipe I have been searching for!  After leaving the dough in the fridge overnight, it was hard.  Left it out a while and worked with it and it was just fine.  These are not to sweet and don't have that flour taste so many cookies do.  Used another reviewer's suggestion and used JBS BOX's recipe on here for sugar cookie icing.  I have Halloween cookies that are bakery quality and everyone who tasted them said the same thing.  If you want a crisper cookie, cut them thinner.  Once they start browning around the edges, they are done.  BUT, even my overbaked ones tasted good.  I used parchment paper to bake them on.  Didn't change the recipe at all.  I can't wait to make Christmas cookies in all different shapes this year with this recipe!

This is my favorite sugar cookie recipe. They roll out perfectly and hold up to even my kids decorating them. I tried another popular recipe but I prefer this one better. I usually use vanilla and almond extract. Really delicious with the sugar cookie icing.

Thank you, thank you!  After trying another butter cookie recipe from this site that turned out not so good, I was hesitant to try again.  I am glad I did.  These rolled out so nicely, and taste good too.  I omitted the butter extract because I couldn't find it anywhere.

Cookies are hard and hold their shape very well, I'm sure it would have been nice as a cookie flower pot. For those who want a cut out recipe to bake for the kids, this is THE recipe. My kids have fallen asleep after helping out, I'm quite sure they will like it when the get up. I cut back some sugar and flour.

Excellent tasting cookie.  I too made them with only vanilla, because I didn't have butter flavoring.  I probably will continue to do this for future batches.  I used thick bamboo skewers I purchased at the grocery store and made 4" cookies.  The sticks held up fine, and it is far easier than asking my husband to cut dowels. :)  (I did not soak the bamboo, just took them straight out of the package).  I had a problem with the dough sticking to my marble surface.  I rolled out small batches in between deli wrap sheets, and it was perfect!  I had to bake them longer, and found that the cookies were a little too brittle after decorating, if I did not cook longer.  Also, I preferred those baked on my Pamp Chef stone vs those cooked on metal.  They were more evenly cooked and not as doughy in the middle, which affects the cookie's integrity.  I'm still looking for a good frosting recipe though.

I made these for a baby shower, using teeny-tiny terracotta pots and wooden dowels. Boy were they a hit! And they tasted sooooo good! Clever idea, great recipe. Thank you.  (Note: I did omit the butter flavored extract, and the resulting flavor didn't lack a thing.)

This is the BEST recipe!!  Makes excellent cookies- hold very well even with large cutouts on sticks!  HIGHLY recommend!!!  Didn't use all 7 cups of flour, so took advice from prev poster and mixed salt and BP with 5 cups flour first.  firm cookie but soft on the inside- I made big daisy cookies and had to cook them for 15 mins 8-10 was not enough..  enjoy!

I love this recipe.  Easy and the cookies stay fresh in an air tight container for a long time.  I have made these twice with my kids and they can't get enough.  We leave out the sticks and only decorate the cookies with sugar cookie icing from this site.

Was looking for a "Lollipop Cookie" recipe for my 3 year old's birthday party and couldn't be happier to stumble upon this one.  I'm in the UK and we don't have (or I've never heard of) butter extract so I put in a bit of almond extract in its place and they are so good I am glad that I only made 1/4 of the recipe or I'd be eating them all!!

This recipe is really good.  The dough is so easy to work with.  Sometimes I add a little almond extract for a different taste.  I love these cookies plain with a cup of coffee!  The best part about them is after they are baked they stay soft when you bite into them.  Don't be afraid to roll out a nice thick cookie!  I have made these atleast a dozen times and they have been perfect!

I made these for an Easter party for my son's class.  I made them in the shapes of Easter eggs and we decorated them and put some on dowels and some on popsicle sticks.  The popsicle sticks seemed to work the best. They were easier to get in the middle of the cookies and supported them better as well.  The dough was easy to use and the cookies turned out great.  They had the perfect amount of sweetness for icing and even though they are durable to have on sticks, they still have a good soft consistency.  Great recipe; thank you!

This is a very good cookie to work with for both kids and adults! I have and will continue to make this recipe for yrs to come! The only thin I do different is I do NOT add vanilla extract, I always use emolsions. You can find them at hobby lobby. What they are is a thicker richer addative much like an extract but it doesn't bake out while cooking. I use one in this recipe called "sweet buttery dough" and it makes these cookies taste divine. They always look wonderful but the emolsion makes them taste equally good. There are several flavors of the emolsions such as sweet buttery dough, princess, and bouquet. They can be added to cookies, cakes, icings, ect.. Hope you will try them for yourself and agree that they make your bake goods great!!

This is by far the best cut-out cookie recipe I have tried. I have made many gift bouquets with it and it turns out perfect each time. I use the sugar cookie icing recipe from this site with a paint brush to apply and they turn out beautifully. One trick I have found so they don't turn out hard is bake them on parchment paper (watch them closely) and they are done when they just start to turn brown around the bottom edge.

This is the 3rd time I made these. First was for Halloween cookies, the first batch was fine, easy to work with....That's my one problem, finding a cookie dough that's easy to work with. Alot of the time the dough turns out sticky and I get frustrated. But this one's good. But for my 2nd Halloween batch I used Imperial Margarine, not butter, and the dough was sticky and hard to work with, I had to keep putting it in the freezer.....Lesson learned always use butter when called for, I can't bee frugal and use margarine, doesn't work.  Made this recipe again recently and freezed the dough till ready to use today for birthday cookies.....Easy to work with and taste great!!!!....I haven't even iced them yet!....My new keeper cookie cutout recipe!!!.... But will always use butter....thanks

Great recipe! 
I have come to leave out the baking powder because I find the details of the cut-out shapes get lost a little bit as the cookies puff in the oven. And they still have a great texture without the powder -although the dough really benefits from an overnight stay in the fridge.
 
Last adjustment: no butter flavored extract to be found here in Belgium, so I sometimes sub in maple flavored extract (which is not available here either, but I bought that one in Canada a while ago) or just leave it out and double the vanilla.
Thank you Laura!

These are GREAT - I didn't end up using sticks, but these are great cut out cookies!  I tinted them with red food coloring to make them pink for Valentine's Day.  I used 1 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract and 1/2 tablespoon almond extract.  I cut them into heart shapes and used "Really good frosting" to write saying on the hearts like the conversation heart candys.  The kids classes loved them on Valentine's Day.  The dough is really easy to work to with, to roll and cut out.

Easy and delicious. Made half the recipe and still had tons of cookies. The dough was very easy to work and the cookies held their shape.  To make rolling out easier, I found it best to let the dough rest overnight in the fridge and then roll out a bit at a time.

These cookies were super easy to make and they held their shape. In the past when I have made cut-out cookies they never held their shape. However, this recipe was different. They tasted really good and the kids had a blast decorating them. Thanks!!!!

This is definitely the best cut-out sugar cookie recipe I've found. The dough was extremely easy to work with after chilling for just 3 hours. I usually end up fighting the dough for cut-outs, but no problems at all with this recipe. The cookies are delicious and have great texture. The flower pot idea is super cute! I made this for my MIL for Mother's Day and she was thrilled. I will definitely make again! Thanks :)

Excellent recipe!!  As other have said the flavor is great even without the butter flavoring (although I imagine that would only add to the yumminess).  I made these in 2 batches of 24, only because I miscalculated the number of guests I was expecting.  Only after making the first batch did I realize I needed 24 more.  For the second batch I literally eyeballed the measurements, threw all the ingredients into the bowl, mixed with a spoon, and only kept in the fridge for 30 min before rolling (while for the first batch I measured everything exactly, used an electric hand mixer, and kept the dough chilled for 4 hours).  There is no difference between the two batches—both came out perfect.  This recipe is very forgiving so if you’re short on time these are for you.  The only thing I did differently was add a little extra salt as I think salt brings out the flavor in sugar and butter cookies.  I decorated with lemon flavored royal icing.

This cookie dough is awesome.  I was able to take the ball of dough out of the fridge and bake a few cookies at a time.  I hate baking a batch of cookies and having it go stale after a couple days.  I wrapped my dough in wax paper and then with plastic wrap.  It stayed good for two weeks!  My two year old son really enjoyed decorating these durable cookies.

My only gripe with this recipe is that I thought it was WAY too sweet. We used buttercream icing to decorate these cookies cut into heart and butterfly shapes and baked onto popsicle sticks for my girls' bday party. I used the tip someone else gave and cut two cookies per stick, sandwiching the stick between the two cookies. These baked about 15 minutes and were around 1/2" thick and made about 24 cookies. If you are using the sweet frosting, I suggest cutting way back on the sugar. Otherwise, it tasted good despite the hardness of the cookie which made us nervous (we thought they'd be dry). Will do again with less sugar.

These cookies are great.  I made a batch for my children's valentines day parties and they were a hit.  With half of the dough we made hearts with lollipop sticks inserted in the bottom and the kids painted them with icing.  We inserted the sticks immediately after they came out of the oven.  I received many requests from neighbors and preschool teachers for the recipe!

It was my first time making cut-out cookies and it was much easier than I expected even with using an old salsa jar as my "rolling pin".  Most importantly, they passed the 3.5 year old icing (and eating) test.  It's the first time my daughter got to eat one of her crafts and she's thrilled.

I generally like sweeter cookies so if I ever make them with the intent NOT to ice them, then I'll add more sugar.  Next time I'll try using less flour to see if it's easier to roll out.

I read reviews and only used 5 cups of flour which was more than enough but these really had no flavor - we sprinkled white sugar on top then they were ok. Once we frosted them they were also good. Not that easy to work with either

i wanted to try a cookie cut-out recipe that used butter rather than shortening.  This one was perfect!  I followed the exact instructions, chilled over night and then baked each cookie (let out the sticks) for 7-8 mins, personally one of the BeSt cut-out cookie recipes i've tried!!

Great cookie. (I took the advise to add part of flour with BP and salt first. I needed 5 1/2 cups) I have been making Sugar Cookies for my Cookie Monster hubby for years. I wanted to try something new and these are great. I am making 130 cookies for Church event with a tropical theme. I stenciled a palm tree on each cookie. BIG HIT!

I'm making these cookies right now, the dough is still really soft and when I try to cut out the shape and lift it off the counter it loses its shape, any suggestions?! I hate to add more flour (I've already used the 7 cups) and dont want my cookies to be tough.....

These cookies are very good. The almond extract makes them taste more special. I bought a pan that is specifically made to have a stick in it. I used some pam spray, and the key to get them out in one piece is to go around the edges when it is warm, and not wait until they are too cool to take them out. They also looked good without a stick. I bought the white icing in a tube, and all the supplies I needed at Michaels craft store. My husband and son's thought they were awsome. You can use Royal icing, if you want to make the icing youself. I made these at spring time, right around Easter. They make any Easter basket look super special.

I love this recipe but the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the recipe listed above is huge and on the first batch I tried to make it stripped the gears from the beaters on my mixer.  I'm an experienced baker and have made big batches of cookies every christams but this killed my mixer.  My advice is to half this recipe.  I also doubled the vanill and skipped the butter flavoring. My original intent was to find a good sugar cookie that would hold up to kids decorating them.  I'm making about 500 cookies, some big, some normal size for a holiday party.  So far these have been excellent and my family loves them!  we'll see how they stand up to 300 kids (mostly boys) come this Saturday!!

****!! I have said that other sugar cookies were the best in the past but, hands down this one out of this world! I halved the recipe and it was perfect with the measurements given. I followed the recipe exactly despite all the reviewers saying that they didn't used the butter extract. It was such a nice delicate flavor and I think this was due to the extracts in the recipe. A sturdy, soft and flavorful cut-out. Perfect!! Loved it.

Iwas looking for a five star recipe, and this is IT! I made wedding cake cookies, and they turned out fantastic! The cookie cutter I used was quite large, and after a couple of tries, realized thinner is better. They rise enough and keep the shape.   Definitely a winner!  The only thing I did differently, was I used parchment paper and they came out evenly browned on the bottom. Wonderful recipe!

Love this recipe, always turns out.  My new favorite!  Used a little more flour and used almond extract instead of butter.  Rolled between wax paper and cut out hedgehog shaped cookies.  The flavor (with the almond) was outstanding.  These were extremely sturdy cookies, just what I was looking for to put on sticks.

I have never liked making cut-out cookies. I felt the effort never equaled the return ... until now.  I wanted to make onesie cut-out cookies for my daughter's baby shower.  I thought I would try this recipe. If it didn't work I would order them from the bakery.  They turned out beautifully!  I made them about 1/2 inch thick to look more professional. I never had butter extract on hand so I just added more vanilla.  Thank you. You've helped me perfect one of the skills to be a perfect grandma - cut-out cookies!

These were very yummy cookies, although I like mine a little softer. For taste though, definately a 5 and the dough was so easy to work with.  I used one cup less flour then the recipe calls for and it was perfect.  I also bought cream cheese frosting and melted it a bit in the microwave and then dipped the cookies into it and they turned out perfectly smooth and shiny and they had the great cream cheese taste.  Yummy!

Loved this recipe!  The cookies were wonderful and they stayed soft and were not brittle!  I will be using this as my go to sugar cookie from now on.  Keep in mind that this makes a ton of cookies!  I made about 50 cookies ranging from 2-4 inches and only used about half the dough!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!! Ive used it for 2 bridal showers and a baby shower in the last 3 months. It hasn't failed me once and everybody loves them! Perfect cookie for royal icing, and the thing i love most about them is that when you put them in the oven they don't stretch out and loose there shape! They really held too. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It is now my go to for all holidays and events =]

Not impressed at all.  This cookie has such high ratings so I expected an amazing cookie.  I made the dough last night and its been sitting in the fridge until this morning.  The dough was easy to work with and roll out.  I didn't think the dough was very flavorful though but was excited to see what the cookies would taste like.  Well...they are just coming out of the oven now and are a mess!  They do not have a lot of flavor, they are sticking to my cookie stones (which I have never had a problem with before!). I took another reviewers advice and rolled them with powdered sugar--maybe that was the problem?  I have never done that before!  Right now i have some in the oven that I scooped with a cookie scoop.  We will see how these turn out.  I needed these cookies for a girl scout event today so i am very dissapointed!!!  Update:  I just took the scoop cookies out of the oven and pressed them with lots of sugar...they still don't have flavor.  This time I did not use powdered suar.  So, I am changing this rating to 1 star.  These cookies were a waste of ingredients and now I have to figure out something else for girl scouts!!!

I have made these cookies many times and each time is better.  I am about make about 150 for my daughter's 6th birthday and thought I might share that this recipe is hands down the best!  I don't always do the flower cookies or use sticks, but this is now my go to cut out cookie recipe.
I do add a little extra vanilla and opt for almond extract instead of butter extract depending on the crowd but each time these cookies are phenomenal!
 
Thanks for sharing!

I have to say this recipe is a winner!! I just cut down the sugar a bit because I thought with the icing it would be too sweet and it was just perfect :o) It was a great Mother's Day gift. My Mom absolutely loved them!

I have found my new cut-out cookie recipe.  These are neither too hard nor too soft.  I only made 1/2 the recipe, which made 24 flowers/butterflies.

I was a bit nervous about trying this new cookie recipe, but was amazed by the results, my 7 yr old daughter helped me make them, and we had a blast. They tasted perfectly, the only thing I didn't add was the butter flavor, but didn't need it.

The cookies held their shape well, though I must admit I found them rather bland. Easy to ice, and eaten quickly though!

This is an excellent cut out recipe. I was able to find butter flavored extract at my local grocery store and I could definitely taste the extra flavor; it was a great add-in. The only problem I had was with the flour. I used all 7 cups because the dough seemed to loose while mixing, then when I took it out of the refrigerator the next morning it was rock solid. I had to work with it to soften it back up and my cookies were a little tougher than I had hoped. Next time I will reduce by 2 cups as others have suggested.

These  are wonderful!  I made them twice.  The first time I used almond extract instead of butter extract because I had a hard time finding it at first.  The second time I used butter extract and they turned out so much better.  These are the only sugar cookies I will make in teh future.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! The flavor of the cookies is excellent. I did over bake the first batch because I am used to cut-out cookies being slightly golden brown on the edges when they are done. I waited for the edges to turn golden on these and they were hard! So I took the next batch out after 10 minutes and they were perfect.

I used this as a great base for a Spiced Sugar Cookie. I didn't use the butter extract either - I've never even heard of it, though it sounds yummy! I used 2 more tsp of Vanilla and 1 of Rum extract instead. Then I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg and 3/4 tsp of Allspice for my "spice". Contrary to other reviews I found that it needed all 7 cups of flour and rolled out quite nicely for cut outs. A very tasty dough before and after baking! I baked mine for 10 min at 335 since I was using a dark metal non-stick pan. Perfect!

I didn't put my cookies in a flower pot, since I was making pigs for my second grade class (Charlotte's Web theme), but I may try that at some point. These cookies were delicious. They tasted much like those famous smiley cookies. I used frosting and fondant on them, and even after setting overnight, they were still soft and delicious!

FANTASTIC!  Didn't have the butter extract so used double vanilla.  Still delicious.  With the big cookie cutters you can't get 72 cookies for sure at 1/4 inch thick.  Mine were thinner and I still only got 50.  But that was more than enough.  I took a picture.  They were beautiful.

Positively the best homemade sugar cookies I've ever had!!  The only adjustment I made was the baking temp...I raised it to 400 and baked them only about 6 min.  I rolled them out pretty thick, about 1/4 inch, and I found they "rose" nicer with the higher temp...at 350 they kind of got "blobby" and "rolled over" their edges.  They still came out wonderful and soft at 400, too.  I have a recipe that was my great grandmothers that I have used since I started baking (been a while, but not admitting how long!! lol), and I am now replacing it with this one!!  Oh, and definitely almond extract instead of the butter flavoring!!  TY so much for this recipe!!!!

I have found the ultimate sugar cookie recipe!  I tried two other recipes in the past - the first one was bland and the second one was good, but spread too much.  This one is perfect!  It doesn't spread, so it's great for decorating with fondant.  I also used almond extract instead of butter extract b/c I didn't have any and it turned out really yummy!

These cookies were delicious.  They had lots of flavor and a really nice texture.  I made these for the 4th of July.  I cut out flags and stars and set them in a metal holder and used flag material to cover the oasis.  What a beautiful center pice it made and everyone loved eating them off the sticks....even the kids.  I was afraid that they would break during transportation to the party but they were very sturdy.  I soaked the bamboo skewers in water before sticking them into the cookies and baking them.    Thanks for the recipe.  They were a lot of fun!!!!

This recipe is fantastic!  The cookies are sweet, but not overly so, and have a great consistency.  I wanted to make cut-outs and usually end up with broken cookies that don't survive.  These survived being mailed across the country, and arrived in one piece!  This is definitely a keeper.

I used the recipe as-is except I cooked them about 1 minute more so they wouldn't break.  They worked great for party favors.  They lasted a whole week and still tasted great.  I individually wrapped them in clear bags with little bows and everyone raved about them!

I love this recipe and have shared it with many friends.  Great for party favors, I made baby girl onesie cookies for my sister-in-laws shower.  I have been experimenting with the extracts, I find the butter flavor leaves an after taste. Any suggestions would be great!

Made this recipe this evening as stated with the exception of substituting almond extract for the butter  flavored extract.  The dough, once chilled, is unbelievably easy to work with and bakes up perfectly in ten minutes.  I rolled and cut my cookies out then placed them in the freezer for ten minutes before baking to ensure they held their shapes.  Now just to decorate!!!!

These cookies were fantastic! I set up a cookie decorating station at a party. They were a hit! Only change I made was I used Maple flavoring instead of the Butter flavoring...maybe just a tad less flour. Rolling them out was a little difficult but once warmed by hands it was easy to roll out. Most defiantly use this recipie for all my cut out cookies!

I've made A LOT of sugar cookies in the time I've been baking but this is the best recipe to date!  I halved the recipe and they came out great!  I didn't have much time to decorate them but what I did do for decorating was fun!  Look no further for a cut out  sugar cookie recipe! EDIT: I have continued to make these cookies, the original recipe is GREAT!  Sometimes I add a bit of almond extract -1/2 tsp in addition to the others (YUM)! I've made them with & without the cookie sticks, both ways were enjoyable!  I find when I  leave the dough in the refrigerator for a coupe of days, it works best for me.  I kneed the dough a few times to loosen it up.  I don't use flour for rolling it out, I use powdered sugar. Seriously, look no further for THE BEST cut out sugar cookies!

Best recipe ever, have to admit got a little scared when I took out of fridge and dough was very hard, but once I started to work it, it was so easy to roll and cut, used powdered sugar instead of flour and almond extract instead of butter just because I didn't have it and these cookies are so addicting and held up so well for the 30 kids I had over for my daughter's cookie decorating party, people were raving about them!  Will never use another recipe again! Thank you so much!

This is a great cookie, it does not even need icing as its perfect on its own and holds its shape well when baking. It is important to chill for a few hours. I used almond extract not vanilla and they came out perfect.  I used Butter Icing For Cookies for the kids to decorate and the combination was a win:)

I found this recipe not too long ago while having a baking day with my niece.  I have made them several times since and my family loves them!  The last two times, the cookies were all gone before I even got them frosted!  I will definitely make them again, and again, and again.........

My kids and I made these for mother's day gifts. My kids painted clay pots and decorated them with beads. For the cookies, we made 3 different sizes of flowers, and used cookie sticks. We decorated the cookies using Wilton's buttercream icing, outlining with royal icing. The only change I made to the recipe was to use almond extract. This project was so much fun and turned out beautifully! Thanks for sharing!

I made these  Cookies yesterday and let them sit in the fridge overnight. I followed the directions to a T, yet they were extremely sticky when cutting out ( I had to continually re-flour everything) , and swelled while cooking. Since no-one one else really seemed to have an issue, I am assuming it was just me or maybe the climate I live in. Anyone who has advice feel free to respond or contact me. Though Cookies in general were very tasty though.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I kept the ingredients the same, they were taking a little long to bake (probably my  oven)so I turned the oven up to 360 degrees and baked for about 12 minutes.(I was making  4 inch cookies, I don't know if this made a difference or not) I only baked until the edges were slightly golden, they were  soft when I  took them out of the oven, but as they cooled they did harden a bit. They were not too hard as someone mentioned, they turned out wonderful and tasted delicious. I will definitely be  using this recipe again.

I should have listen to one reviewer statement that she uses 5 cup of flour instead of 7 because our cookies was hard it could break teeth! I  made these with my friends today but the good thing is it stays on the stick. we only use a thin bamboo stick and it holds ok.the flavour was great though despite the hardness. we didn't use butter flavour because we cant find it. so we used almond extract instead.

I love this cookie recipe! The only thing I changed was that I used 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and omitting the butter extract because I didn't have it. I also rolled it just under 1/2 inch thick and baked it for 12 minutes. Great flavor cookie!

the first two times i made this recipe, i made about 24 cookies, using the calculator, and they came out great, even held their shape while baking, but the third time i tried to make 100 cookies, and it was a disaster, I' made sure to blend everything well, but im wondering if the calculator isnt converting correctly. The dough puffed up in the oven and tasted much more raw. I have the dough for the fourth batch (of 72 cookies) in the fridge. let's see.

I lost my cut out cookie recipe so I decided to look for a 5 star on allrecipes.  I chose this one and was glad I did.  It is even better than the one I lost.  I was a little worried when I read the cookie wasn't real sweet I don't frost my cookies.  I used vanilla only I didn't have the butter extract.  I put sugar on them and they were delicious. Definitely will make again, thanks Laura

These are awesome and I'm not a big lover of butter/sugar cookies.  It was my first time making cut-out cookies so if it's your first time make sure that you roll out your dough think enough otherwise the cookies will be so tough.  I'd say go between a 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch.  Make sure you don't overcook them.  Bake them 10 minutes at most.  They will not crumble even if they look a little light.  These cookies stand up to the toughest little cook's hands and taste great with almond extract instead of butter extract.  The recipe is a bit confusing as it calls for butter then talks about margarine.  I used all butter and iced them with royal icing.  These will definitely be my go to cut- out cookie.

The best cut-out/sugar cookie recipe I have ever had.  I have always had problems with the cookies staying a bit chewy the way my wife likes them and have been baking for years.  This recipe has solved my sugar cookie problems.

Hands-down the best sugar cookie recipe ever. Didn't have butter flavoring. per some of the suggestions, I substituted with 1/2 tsp more vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Haven't tasted cookies yet (they are cooling) but dough was so good that was what I had for breakfast!

These are the absolute perfect sugar cookies- I got 76 out of my batch- plenty to give out to friends and neighbors.  They're great plain, frosted, sprinkled with sugar- whatever you like... and I like it all!  I can't wait for halloween and Christmas so I can make tons more!

Great Recipe Laura! Also, is it possible to use margarine instead of butter?

I used this recipe to make Lemon Cut Out Cookies for my niece. I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown. I reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp. I used lemon extract instead of butter flavor extract. We'll decorate with simple frosting using 1 lb. powdered sugar,  1/2 cup butter, and fresh lemon juice. 
I love that girl!

This is a great recipe for cut-outs. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies were really easy to roll and cut out, with little need for me to add flour upon re-rolling the dough. (Adding flour on re-rolling can cause the cookies to come out hard.)

I was concerned because the dough was rather hard at first, but a little kneading was all that was needed.  So tasty, not too sweet, really perfect.  Great dough to work with, made beautiful cut out cookies.  Even the reindeer legs didn't come off when moving from counter to the cookie sheet. 8 minutes was the right time. The cookies were sturdy enough to withstand my 18 month old nephew's decorating techniques.  This is the new official Christmas cutout cookie recipe for the family and generations to come.

I just finished baking about 80 ninja cookies for my son's birthday party which is in 2 days. The dough was ridiculously easy to make and the cookies are baking up perfectly. I'd noticed a few people mentioned that the cookies are firm and won't break if children decorate them and I can see exactly what they mean. Plus they taste amazing. This is the first time I've made cookies with cookie cutters like this and it is the only recipe I will ever use!! I read the reviews and just used some extra vanilla instead of the butter flavor and I used maybe 6 or 6 1/2 cups flour instead of 7. Definitely bake on parchment paper -- SO easy to slide right off when they are done. THANKS!!

Would have given it 5 stars, but I had to use less flour ( about 6 cups) and only half of the butter extract . We used both traditional cut outs and the cookie cutters that leave imprints, dough held really well, did not expand as much as other recipes I've used. Will definitely use again.

My cookies were not great :-( The dough sticks while trying to cut out. I didn't even try to decorate them. After all the 5 stars, I guess it was me. I cut the ingredients in half and followed the recipe exactly except I used almond flavor. But it should not make such a big difference.

Very good.  I used extra vanilla extract instead of the butter flavoring and made these into regular sugar cookies.  We topped the cooled cookies with Decorator Frosting (from this site) and it was amazing!

I halved the recipe and made these for MIL's birthday bouquet as well as Easter basket fillers.  I rolled the dough in a combination of flour/powder sugar to prevent the dough from becoming tough and dry when re-rolling.  The cookies turned out great when frosted with the sugar cooking icing from AR.  My daughters said they tasted like Eat'n Park smiley cookies.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is great!! I made my mother and sister a bouquet of cookie flowers in a flower pot for Easter! They turned out awesome! I used almond extract instead of butter extract as that's all I had and they were still yummy! The cookies weren't too hard - just right. Thank you.

These cookies are fabulous and are like bakery cookies.  I have made them MANY times and am known for them at the Hospital I work at.  I just made five batches of dough that yielded about 240 cookies!  I follow the recipe exactly and love them just like that.  I make the dough a few days before and then roll them out on another day.  The key to easy mixing is the butter!  Make sure it is nice and soft...makes life much easier.  I spoon mix til I can't anymore and then use my hands to turn and knead until it's one big ball.

I cook A LOT!!! and this is a great recipe.  If you like your cookies a little shorter (I do) leave out the seventh cup of flour.  These cookies will work for the snowflake cookie cutters...they don't swell up as much as other recipes.  I did not do the stick thing.  Also, instead of the butter flavor, I used almond flavor in one batch and orange flavor in another...they were all good.

I made this recipe with my 11 year old granddaughter.  We had problems with this recipe I think because our cookie cutter was large--4 1/2 inches--we had problems with our cookies falling off the dowels because they were so heavy.  Also, I used "real" butter and next time I think I'll omit the butter flavoring.  We'll try it again with a smaller cookie cutter.

These were great cookies.  We made them for Valentine's Day.  Tender and chewy.  We didn't get quite as many cookies as the recipe states but we were using a 3 inch heart shaped cutter and got only about 30 cookies.  A keeper though!

These are pretty good, but they're very dense. The butter extract gives them a nice flavor so if you don't have it maybe add some almond extract or additional vanilla instead. Very easy to frost and very sturdy and easy to take somewhere without breaking.

This is my go-to sugar cookie dough.  I've used it for years.  The cookies keep their shape while baking and they always turn out delicious!

This is the mother of all sugar cookie recipes.  Once you've tried these, you'll never go back to anything else!  I have made these many, many times and can't find any recipe even close to being this good.  When I moved several years ago, I had a cookie decorating open house around Easter and it was so much fun.  They hold up well and have delicious flavor.  Enjoy!

Super impressed!!!  I have tried lots and lots of recipes and this is the BEST.  I have a very picky family when it comes to sweets (they don't like them) and I lo c e to bake.  Guess what? They loved these cookies.  I did chill about 9 mins before I put them in the oven.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!

I made these for a 50 and Fabulous themed birthday party!  I followed the recipe but forgot the vanilla extract and they still tasted amazing.  I had to use the paddle on my heavy duty mixer otherwise 7 cups of flour are impossible to mix. They hold their shape when baking! The mix produced 82 cookies!

Love this recipe. My changes are all flavor based. I don't use the butter extract and often I will add spices, such as cinnamon and cardamom, instead. Good cookie. Stands up to decorating well, good flavor, not too hard and doesn't fall apart.

I've been using this recipe for holiday cut out cookies for years. They turn out perfect every time! I do not add the butter flavor extract, but use a teaspoon of almond extract instead. Keeping them thick makes it easier for little ones to decorate. The perfect recipe. Thanks, Laura!

This is my go to sugar cookie recipe and they turn out perfect every time. I have made them with sticks for a cookie bouquet and they are very sturdy and hold up well. However, most of the time I do not. Don’t panic if they seem hard. They are not. The cookies are crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. They are delicious with or without icing. This is the only sugar cookie recipe I use and people love them.

This is a super easy recipe. I made large flower cutouts. I noticed others said not to use the full amount of flower but I did and they were nice and had a soft chew after 10 mins. I did not use any flour to roll them out. Chilled overnight and rolled out between 2 sheets of waxed paper. They rolled perfectly with no sticking.  My treat sticks were not oven friendly so I just popped them in the cookies while they were still warm from the oven. I did not have butter extract so I doubled my vanilla but it does seem like something is missing. I think the butter extract would give it that extra umph! I think it even almond extract would have been good. Overall great recipe!

I love these cookies. I have tried other recipes, but keep coming back to this one. The only substitution I do is using rum extract instead of the butter. I have also added crushed white chocolate chips which was quite tasty.

The taste of these cookies and how they hold their shape is outstanding. However I found it does not need the full amount of flour. Every time I make these it is too much flour and they start to crack and crumble as I roll them out. May be my error. It is no big deal for me to use a tad less.

Followed recipe verbatim except added a little almond extract. Did Easter shapes and stuck the sticks into florist's foam placed in small basket. Great gift! Royal icing recipe on this site was shiny, just hard enough to spread nicely but soft to eat. Love this recipe, thx!

I needed a sugar cookie recipe for Christmas gift baskets. I used this recipe after cutting it in half. I used Sugar Cookie Glaze by cyndi, which I added a 1/2 tsp lemon extract and little more confectioners' sugar. I did not add the 10 drops of food coloring as per cyndi's recipe, but rather a few for the desired color.

All time favorite sugar cookie recipe! So so good! 

Going to a party with some lactose free kids, has anyone made this with margarine instead of butter?
Thanks!

I've been using this recipe for cut out cookies for a few years  now at least. I leave out the butter flavored extract and sub with extra vanilla extract. These are the only cookies that ever keep their shape when baking. ETA - I quartered the recipe and used a gluten free flour mix to make these and they still came out awesome! Still my favorite cutout cookie recipe. I get asked for it all the time.

Wonderful recipe, thank you.  It is very flexible and allows for creativity.  I added 1 tsp of almond flavoring and it tasted great.  Be sure to read other reviews for good ideas.  I did not have time to refrigerate the dough, so I used powdered sugar on the rolling surface and rolling pin to keep dough from sticking.  Watched cookies closely so they did not over-cook.  I took mine out when just golden on the outer edges and they were ready and perfect.  Thank you for sharing.

Delicious and easy. I modified the recipe for 36 cookies. I did not use the butter flavour, but did up the vanilla a bit. I tried some dough before refrigerating, and it was fine!  Cookies took ten minutes.

Without any icing, these turned out more like a tea biscuit than a cookie. In fact, if I were reviewing a tea biscuit recipe, I'd give it 5 stars. As a cookie, however, this is a 3-star recipe at best.

I halved the recipe and kept out some of the flour, as an earlier reviewer had suggested. That way, when I dusted with flour before rolling, I wouldn't be adding extra flour. The cookies turned out 'just o.k.' and nothing special. We'll eat these and continue looking for a really good sugar cookie recipe.

This is the best cut out cookie I have ever tried. It tasted delicious and kept its shape perfectly. It allowed you to make a nice thick cookie that did not spread. The dough was tough right out of the fridge but a little effort and it rolled out great! I used the sugar cookie icing on this site.

These taste great but spread terribly. I'll try popping the cut-outs in the freezer prior to baking to see if that helps next time. Still a delicious cookie though! Great texture.
