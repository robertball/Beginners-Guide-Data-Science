I've been making this same cake for years! Actually, instead of the oil, I use another stick of butter. Yikes! Three sticks in one cake!!! Anyway, I have been asked to make this cake MANY, MANY times over the years. I have even been paid to make this cake. My mother-in-law has dreams about it, and hoards it when I make it. I got the recipe from a friend about twenty years ago (when I was in Jr. High School!), and she called it Candy Cake because the icing is like eating fudge. I highly recommend poking lots of holes in the cake just before you pour the hot icing over the hot cake. I use a thick wooden skewer to do this. If I didn't have one, then I use the back of my beater from my hand-mixer. This makes it unbelievably moist and heaven-filled! I used to get asked to make the birthday cake for all the birthdays in my office, and my co-workers even asked if I would make this cake for my own birthday. It is a definite winner. Don't look any further, this is THE chocolate cake! 

Oh, and candacemarie, my name is also Candice Marie and I go by Candi, too. People think the cake is named after me (since we call it Candy Cake). lol

Well i was looking for a chocolate cake recipe, so i tried this one. I followed the recipe almost exactly but cut the cinnamon to half the amount. Even with that the cinnamon almost over powered it. I wanted a basic chocolate cake, not a cinnamon chocolate cake. Also, it wasn't very chocolaty. Because of that i give it 3 stars.
Now since then i stopped using cinnamon and use a bit more than 1/4 cup of cocoa. The cake is very good and very moist.
A good recipe to build off of.
Also i did not like the frosting, way to sugary.

This is an AWESOME recipe!!!! The ingredient list is long, but it is very easy to make and clean up is simple. HINT: I didn't want a rectangle cake so I poured the batter into 2 9inch pans. It turned out great. Perfect for layers!!! For big layers- double recipe!!! (It also slipped out of the pan with no mess!!!!)

This was an unexpected hit.  It's incredible to me just how much chocolate flavor there was in this cake given the small amount of cocoa powder in it.  It is also incredible how moist and fresh tasting it was, given I made it three days ago and first cut into it tonight! I loved that it called for both butter, for unbeatable flavor, and shortening, for guaranteed moistness. I didn't include the cinnamon simply because it didn't appeal to me and that was a good call for my taste buds.  As for the frosting, it is a fudgy, brownie-type frosting that pours easily and stays soft (even three days later).

I found this cake really easy to make and quite tasty. A good, cheap-to-make chocolate cake. (I didn't add the cinnamon.)

This is the same recipe I had years ago and lost...so happy to have it again!  As suggested by others, I use 3 sticks butter (omit veg. oil), use only 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and punch holes in cake with handle of small wooden spoon prior to adding the icing.  It's much better on day 2...even more moist!!

This was one of my Mom's favorite recipes and mine too.  To make it more chocolately, I add 1/3 cup Giradelli 60% Cocao chocolate chips or same in Giradelli baking bar to the heated butter/water/oil.

I use a mixer.  Mom always mixed it by hand.

Frosting: 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup white sugar.  Bring to a rolling boil.  Add 1/2 cup Giradelli chocolate chips and beat.  If using on sheet cake, pour over and allow to cool.  I use this cake between layers and on top of this cake when I make a layer cake.  I use a thicker frosting (made with powdered sugar) for the sides.

Was looking for a cake to bake on ball-shaped pan. The recipe has great reviews, the name itself is captivating, so I decided to give it a try as is, no modifications :-) First thing I noticed was that took way longer than suggested, I almost felt like will take it off the oven direct to the trash can :-( waited untill toothpick came clean (65 minutes!), it ended with a big volcano-like crest in the middle and smelled overdone... but deciden not to do the icing.  Surprisingly I found a wonderful flavor an texture!!! As it was a test we didn't mind the bump and keep testing texture and flavor day after day; we have to tell that both improved over the time. So, we LIKED the cake and would love to have it among our favorite recipes... but the bump is indeed a big problem as we would have to top off almost a third of the cake to make it presentable. Anybody else has had the same "bad" experience we did, any idea on the reason why this happen? I usually use heavy molds for fancy shapes like NordicWare, was the result caused by the pan itself (Wilton's aluminum soccer ball pan)?

VERY EASY RECIPE WITH AN ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR.  THE CINNAMON MAKES THIS A MOUTH WATERING MEMORY.  MY FAMILY JUST LOVES IT.  I KEEP GETTING REQUESTS FOR IT.  BUT, IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG WHEN I MAKE IT.

Wow! This is THE best chocolate cake I've ever made. Everyone who ate it was at a loss for words. When looking for a recipe, I struggled as there were so many great options to choose from. However, I will not use any other recipe in the future - this one is just perfect!    I did make a few alternations based on availability of ingredients and feedback from other reviewers:  1. I didn't have buttermilk so substituted it with whipping cream.  2. I halved the amount of cinnamon.  3. I used butter instead of oil.  4. I used melting semi-sweet chocolate instead of powdered cocoa for the icing.  5. I used 2x 9" cake pans - I put some of the icing in the middle layer, put the second layer of cake on, then topped with the icing. Based on another reviewer's comments I poked holes with a skewer on both layers before putting on the icing. The icing fell through the holes and made an already moist cake insanely moist.    Don't look anywhere else!

I always look for great chocolate cake recipes and this is definitely one among them.The only thing i feel is the frosting quantity is too much..half the quantity of the frosting would suffice or else it become too sweet.Love the cinnamon flavour.This is one must try recipe!

My friends mom would make this back in high school & I fell in love with it but I never managed to get the recipe. So I totally freaked out (in the best kind of way) when I tried out this recipe and it was THAT cake! Thank you so much for sharing this :) 

I did tweak it slightly as suggested by other reviewers. For the batter I left out the cinnamon completely, substituted milk & vinegar for the buttermilk as I did not have any on hand, increased the cocoa to 1 cup, & baked it in a 9" x 9" pan. For the icing I left out the pecans & used only 2 cups confectioners sugar which still turned out plenty sweet. Took 30 mins to bake. I have to admit I was pretty skeptical at first, but dove in anyway & gave it a go. Super chuffed that I did! 

I love that you don't need to use a cake mixer for this. Plus the tip on poking holes in the cake & pouring the icing on while still hot was right on point! So moist! My family loved this so much and devoured it in record time! Will be making this again this weekend for my little sisters girls day in (she begged me to bake this for her!) Quick and easy and so delicious! A definite keeper!

For me, this was an unusual method that produced a really good result.  The icing is very much a like a layer of creamy homemade fudge, and the cake is tender and moist.  THe touch of cinnamon is pleasant, but I might reduce the amount slightly next time, and there will be a next time. I made two - one without the pecans - and both were delicious. I had to bake mine 30 minutes; the center was still liquid at 20.
Updating my review because I have made this cake 3 times in the past 2 weeks for different people, and everyone loves it.  It is going to work tomorrow for a pot luck.  Oh how I love to find an easy to make crowd-pleaser that turns out great every time!
Ok - second update - I forgot to mention that this cake is even better the second day, if you can manage to have some stay around that long!

WONDERFUL!  Not many recipes make it printed and in my actual kitchen files but this one is a keeper.  A little more on the cooking time was necessary but other than that I didn't change a thing.

Mine turned out alright.  Good flavor (I did NOT add the cinnamon).  Wasn't my favorite texture.  I did not use the frosting.  Made cream-cheese frosting, instead.

After my changes, I definitely would make this a 5 star recipe.  WAY delicious, but also deadly rich.  

my notes/changes: next time, cut back on the cinnamon, it is too strong.  I used cream (melted ice cream, lol) instead of milk in both the cake and the icing.  For the buttermilk, I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk and added vinegar and let it sit while the chocolate boiled.   instead of cocoa powder/bittersweet chocolate, I used a bar of Lindt 90% dark chocolate.  I used about a 3/4 of a bar on the cake and 1/2 on the icing. i also substituted butter for the vegetable oil, but only really because i didn't have any oil.   instead of 1 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of water (next time i will use milk), and 1/2 cup of rum/creme de cocoa (half and half each).  Also, for the icing instead of confectioner's sugar, i stirred in about a cup of and a half of brown sugar.  came out great.  once the cake came out of the oven, i poked it all over with a toothpick before pouring the icing on.  great out of the oven, and i am going to try freezing it.  it was delicious! one of the richest, most chocolatiest cakes ever! (better be, for 2 1/2 sticks of butter, a cup of ice cream, over 3 cups of sugar, and a bar of chocolate!)

I really appreciate reviews on recipes and always read several before making a recipe.  This recipe rated very high in Like reviews however, after following the recipe exactly,I found the cinnamon ruined the flavor of this cake  The density of the cake was great however, I will not place the cinnamon in the cake the next time I make the recipe. This morning I am still searching for a moist chocolately rich cake recipe.

Used less than half the cinnamon recommended and twice the chocolate and it still came out tasting like cinnamon bread. Not even cake. Bread. :( Could hardly even taste the chocolate. I doubt I'll ever make this again but if I do I will probably leave the cinnamon out entirely and add chocolate chips or something. Very disappointing. Left a bad taste in my mouth, too.

This was a wonderful basic recipe. I modified it quite a bit in order to give it a 5. The chocolate really needed to kicked up to my liking.

This fabulous recipe is also known as Texas Chocolate Sheath Cake. It is so delicious and very easy to make. You can also bake it in a cookie sheet and will be 'cake' brownies. Great if you want to stretch your recipe for special events...

I am questioning the baking time of 20 minutes?  I baked it that long and then followed the recipe.  My cake is not done inside.  I'm going to try and rescue it because of the cost of the ingredients.  I'm very disappointed.

Very moist and made 24 nicely shaped cupcakes, but I'm not sure I love the cinnamon.

Literally the best chocolate cake I've ever ate, and made. AMAZING! And pretty easy. The best part was pouring the chocolate frosting from this recipe on the hot cake, and it basically molded to the cake and it was perfect! I made it for my sister's birthday cake, and I will make it every chance I get. Thank you so much!

I made this cake because I looked and looked for a chocolate cake recipe that was made with cocoa powder instead of baker's chocolate or chocolate chips.  I did not add the cinnamon (maybe I'll try it next time though).  I just totally left it out.  I also didn't bake this in a 9x13, instead I used 3-8'' cake pans.  It did cook in the 20 minutes, which surprised me, since the batter was so liquidy.  The layers came out a little thin, but that's to be expected when using 3 pans instead of 2.  The cake is soft and moist.  I really like it.  I frosted it with "Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting" (a double recipe) found on AllRecipes.  It turned out great!

For reviewer TX-Pat, Shirley Corriher's wonderful book "Cookwise:  The Hows and Whys of Successful Cooking" on page 152 under Cake Problems at a Glance says a "volcano" cake may be the result of an oven temp too high, a pan too small, or a recipe not balanced. ....Personally, in this recipe I increase the cocoa to 3/4 cup, adjust the flour accordingly, and replace the 1 cup water with strongly brewed coffee. The result is almost like biting into a Hershey's kiss.  Ahhhh heaven.

First I must say, I wish the name of this recipe included cinnamon in it. In my quest for a stable all-around yummy chocolate cake recipe, I stumbled on this one. The inclusion of cinnamon caught my eye - and I'm now very glad I tried it. 

This is an excellent, moist and very flavorful cake. I do think it is especially nice to make in the fall and winter months where its flavors seem even more seasonally appropriate.

I made this into cupcakes. There is something about the final result that reminds me of a warm and cozy cup of hot cocoa, so it inspired me to fill mine with a marshmallow creme filling and top with whipped chocolate buttercream.

Delicious!!

The cake is good- if you like a cinnamon flavor, but I thought the frosting was way too sweet and runny. It was much like the chocolate cake at OCB but with cinnamon.

We loved this cake!! One of my favorite recipes, the buttermilk makes it super moist and the cinnamon adds a little extra twist! I recommend this cake to chocolate lovers. I was skeptical about pouring the icing over the hot cake but it worked out perfect.

Great recipe, although I made a few changes: I left out the cinnamon, added 1 cup more of cocoa, 1 tbsp baking powder, and used soy milk instead of buttermilk. This is a very rich and light cake. Next time, I will probably cut the sugar down to 1cup and a bit because I like cake less sweet than the frosting. I'll also make buttercream next time too.

I've been looking for a rich moist chocolate taste cupcake recipe. This cupcake taste like cinnamon all the way!... its good when its hot and fresh and spongy...after a couple of hours, the nice round shape goes down a bit.

I don't want to mess up the ratings for this because I didn't cook in a 9x13 as directed... however I wanted to give a review from the cupcake perspective. This cake has a great taste...it's a pretty thick batter and makes dense cupcakes. The only thing that frustrated me was they got really crispy on the outside before they were fully cooked inside. I kind of liked the "crust", but I imagine some people would want a softer cake. Topped with a blackberry buttercream! Great flavor combo!

I'm 27 weeks pregnant. Baby and I decided I needed some chocolate cake to go with my glass of milk. Found this recipe, loved how it didn't call for much time in the kitchen and that I had all the ingredients, sans pecans-- was already a hit in my books. 

Was super simple to make, and this type of frosting is one of my faves (total sweet tooth). I took the advice of other reviews and used a skewer to poke holes in the cake before I poured the icing over, WONDERFUL IDEA!!

I followed the recipe exactly (except used "sour milk instead of real buttermilk) and do have to agree, with some other reviews, that it is a bit heavy on the cinnamon. Yet, its still a good flavor combo, that warm spicy feeling, great w a cup-o-jo. 

I did give a 5 star instead of 4 because of this, though. I do think the cinnamon aids in relaxing the richness cakes like these tend to have, I was able to eat the whole piece and down my glass of milk, with ease (and joy). 

Over all, LOVE this, will most definitely be making this again, but with 1/2 tsp cinn instead-- 4.5 stars :D

Didn't have buttermilk, so used sour cream, a bit of milk and a tiny bit of lemon juice. I think just sour cream would have worked just fine though. Followed the rest exactly.
It did take a looot longer to bake though. Delicious moist cake!

I dont know if it's because I made this with sunflower oil or not but all I could taste was the oil. It was actually the worst chocolate cake I ever had. Icing was good though. I liked this method better than the regular icing method. Mine was hard to get out of the pan and the middle got all messed up, had to cover with icing.

This was a very tasty cake. I was skeptical at first but it did not disappoint. It was very moist and remained moist for day's. The only draw back was the frosting, it was actually a disaster, it was way to thick an did not make nearly enough to cover the cake and I personally did not like the taste of it, but that was easy to fix I just used a different chocolate frosting recipe I had at home and it turned out perfect. Once you make this cake you will not go back to making boxed cake again.

Delish and made as is except didn't put nuts in for the sake of my toddler. But I imagine the nuts would cut the sweetness of the frosting a bit. I wouldn't cut the oil out - it matters to use both fats for the flavor and the texture each one contributes. This is a lot like a cake called Texas sheet cake. The cinnamon makes it something special though as does the oil.

This cake is awesome! Super moist! Super easy! Super chocolatety!  I did change the frosting a bit. I doubled the milk and cocoa powder, cut the powdered sugar to 3 cups and added 1 c. coconut flakes and 2/3 c. almond slivers. Delicious! It was sweet enough with the decreased amount of powdered sugar and the extra milk made it soak into the cake more. Sooooooo goooood! I might just go have another piece right now!

I don't often bake, but it was my moms 83rd birthday and she LOVES chocolate cake, so I gave this a shot.  This was a HUGE hit with the whole family!  I've never received so many compliments...even from my brother-in-law who has nothing nice to say to me!  This is not an easy recipe, but it's worth the effort.

Wow, this cake turned out to be fantastic. It's very moist, with a very nice flavor. I made the following changes:  1. I completely skipped cinnamon and substituted butter for oil.  2. Added about 2  tbsp shavings of  ghirardelli semisweet chocolate bar. 3. Used 1 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups.    All in all this is a great chocolate cake. It's easy to make and you will be happy you made it.

It's ok, but I definitely have had better.  I made it EXACTLY the way the directions said to.  It was WAY too moist I think and WAY too sweet.  I think the cinnamon threw it off for me!  I think if I made it again I would leave out the cinnamon and use half the icing.  Also, instead of 2 cups of sugar I will probably use 1 1/2 cups.  Oh and, make sure you sift the powdered sugar into the cocoa mixture for the icing or you could get lumps of powdered sugar all over the cake when you pour the icing on top of it.

This is great!  Wonderfully moist.  I really like the fudgy texture of the frosting, and like to add 50-100% more cocoa to it if I'm in a major chocaholic state.  But the regular amount works well, too.

Very moist!  I used to make a similar recipe when I was a young teen for whenever we had family cookouts.  It was always a hit with the kids.  The difference was we put walnuts and coconut in the icing.  I'm going to try that next time I make it.

Mixed Reviews: I made this cake for a birthday and did not like it at all, for me the  cinnamon just did not work but even if I were to leave out the cinnamon, I do not think it would be that good.  One sister-in-law said it was good but would prefer no cinnamon, 2nd sister-in-law said it was the best cake she ever had and my husband said it was very good and that he liked it.

Moist and tasty. Very good recipe. I have a recipe similiar to this one that uses a cup of water in the batter, that is years old. A nice buttercream icing is a great finish to this scrumptious cake!

I made this cake for my daughter's 17th birthday party and everyone loved it!  I used the suggestion of topping it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.  The two recipes together made this cake truly sensational!

The only recipe I'll use from now on!  Everyone loved it - the cake is SO moist and the thick icing is almost like fudge.  I think a bit less icing sugar and a bit more cocoa for the icing is best, especially if you like a dark chocolate taste rather than a very sweet icing.

This is literally and unequivocally the best cake I have ever had in my life. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and I'm pretty sure he fell in love with me right then. (He also ate the whole cake in two days, and he's a skinny guy). I've made this cake three or four times. I always take one reviewer's advice and substitute another stick of butter for the oil, and I usually skip the pecans. Sometimes I don't make the frosting by hand, either- shhh, don't tell anyone I use store-bought frosting! I also substitute an equal amount of plain yogurt for the buttermilk- either ingredient is the secret, I think. It keeps the cake super moist and rich for days, almost like pudding. I found that one trick is to watch it closely while baking and cook it "halfway"- most of the bottom and the sides should be fairly solid, like a normal cake, and the inside should be softer, a bit more liquid and a slightly different color. Then it's almost like two cakes in one.

I recently discovered that I'm sensitive to gluten, but even if I can't make a gluten-free version of this cake work I'm not going to stop making it, if only for other people. It's just so good!

I loved the icing, but the cake was not great.
I felt that after 20 minutes it still looked raw, so I left it in a bit longer.  When I served it, it had flattened and taken on a really dense brownie texture.
I thought I followed the directions exactly, but the rest of the reviews are very positive, so perhaps I didn't leave it in long enough.

This cake was so good.  I skipped the cinnamon and used all butter instead of oil in the cake mix.  It was really a good cake.  Extremely moist and the icing was so yummy.  I will definitely make again.

This cake was delicious, and I tweaked it like others have mentioned by adding coffee instead of water. One change, the baking time was off by quite a bit in my oven.  After the 20 minutes suggested, my cake was still very raw in the center so I added 10 more minutes, checking doneness at each 5 minute mark.

I really enjoyed the texture and flavor of this cake. It could use a little more chocolate. I left out the cinnamon but it was still good. If I could give half stars I would give it a 4.5. I love the fact that a blender isn't needed so it gets extra for that!

This cake was wonderful! I did make a few slight moderations to the ingredients. 
I used an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa powder
an extra 1/2 cup of buttermilk (which I added to the hot ingredients, as well as the eggs)
I used self rising flour,
Left out the salt,
Used a pack of cook and serve chocolate pudding,
Forgot to add vegetable oil,
And used a bundt pan instead of a flat one.
Apart from that I followed the recipe to the letter! It's absolutely delicious, especially with melted chocolate and crushed nuts on top of it! (Well it IS Christmas after all!)

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good cake!

The title says it all!!  Very tasty, moist and easy to make.  Never any complaints when I make this cake.  Everyone always wants seconds and the recipe.  One time I substituted the oil with butter, next time was margarine and a time after that was apple sauce and it always came out perfect.  I've also used milk/coffee cream instead of the buttermilk.  This recipe is very flexible.  I often make the cake in a bundt pan and make cupcakes.  I never buy cake mix anymore!

Delish...next time will add less cinnamon and work with the icing (was  too thick).  Liked the idea of piercing the cake allowing the icing to seep into cake...my icing was too thick this time but will do it again.  Thanks for recipe.  Happy Thanksgiving!

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I've searched for it as a Texas sheet cake but the others failed to add the cinnamon, which is a key ingredient.  I use the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa for a more intense chocolate flavor.  For those of you that don't keep buttermilk on hand, you can substitute an equal amount of sour cream.  If your frosting seems thick and does not pour easily, just add extra milk (1 tsp at a time) until it is the consistency of pancake batter.  The icing will set up as it cools.  My mom used a fork to poke holes into the cake before pouring on the icing so it would seep into the cake...yum!

This is like a thick Texas Sheet Cake.  I had to add 10 minutes to the baking time--it was still a soupy mess at 20 minutes.  I am making it for a coworker who's celebrating a birthday so we'll see how quickly it's eaten tomorrow.

I baked this cake in 2 round 9 in pans and for 25 minutes and it was just right. 5 stars for the texture but 3 for the taste - I like the cinnamon (it's not too strong as others have said) but this recipe begs for more chocolate. I would have doubled the amount of cocoa powder if I had enough left.

The cake itself was wonderful!  I followed the advice of others and only used half of the cinnamon.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I substituted just under 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 T of lemon juice.  I mixed it together and let it stand for 5 minutes.  It worked great!  I rated it a 3 since I didn't like the icing.  It was difficult to work with and very rich.  I would make the cake again but using a different icing.

great recipe, loved the soft texture of the cake, and how quick it bakes. about the frosting, it is very easy to use and gives a clean finish for a neat looking cake, by using a spatula. taste wise i followed the other reviewers' advise in using less suger and making half the amount. this made the quantity and sweetness just perfect for me. i also did the trick of making holes on top of the cake using a tooth pick, so the frosting could sink in the cake. this gave a tasty moist.

I did not like the frosting.  It was overwhelmingly sweet.  I am thinking that cake would be good without all the fat by replacing the butter and oil with nonfat yogart and using sliced strawberries on top.

Delicious! The only time I have ever done the heating liquid with the chocolate and margarine method was to make the base for nanaimo bars. It makes this cake moist and rich. The only things I did differently were to add 3 squares of semisweet bakers chocolate to the hot milk mixture, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon baking powder and omit the cinnamon.   Cooled, cut into 2x2 inch squares and individually wrapped to freeze.   Oh...if you're looking to layer this cake and add a filling, you'll want to double the recipe.

Great cake! I made a test cake ahead of time to see if this would be THE ONE for my daughters first birthday. It is THE ONE! Great texture, frostable, and moist. Be careful...the batter might not make it to the pan soooo good! Only used a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and that was perfect.

This was a hit!  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time to get a good feel of how the base flavor tasted.  The cinnamon gave it a very interesting/good kick of flavor.  I may try this recipe without the cinnamon once to taste it without.  I did make one change.  All of my chocolate baked goods recipes, I substitute cold coffee for the liquid.  So, for the 1 cup of water, I added 1 cup of cold coffee instead.  It brings out even more chocolate flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.

I baked this cake last night...the recipe was very easy to follow and make.  I'd never made cooked frosting but it came out so smooth and was easy to pour on the cake.  I will definitely make this cake again!

This got rave reviews from my family. They found it very fudgy and the crumb very moist. I thought the frosting was too sweet, but solved the problem with cutting a smaller slice the second time around! Thanks, it's worth the effort.

This was an extremely easy cake to make, but the cake was dense and tasted more like a chocolate cake donut.  I would make the frosting again, it was of a great consistency to pour over a bundt cake.

The frosting separated on me :( I think I did something very wrong there. (It separated after I put a drop of cold milk into the hot frosting? If anyone would care to explain. Either way, I'm never doing THAT again.) Cake was perfectly fine, used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a pinch more, flavor was very tasty. Anyone recommend another type of frosting for this cake?

This is A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y The Best Chocolate Cake Ever. Just like the title says. This is just like a recipe I had from when I was a kid. Making this brought me right back to my childhood...to a recipe that is irreplaceable. Thank You!! To everyone thinking about making this, you won't be sorry. I like to make it in a big jelly-roll pan, as I like the flatter version better. Don't be condemning about the cinnamon-that's what helps make this recipe. You don't taste it right up front, but it helps bring out the chocolate flavor even more!  A#1

I'd probably not make this recipe again. First off, I had to bake it much longer than the 20 minutes, and normally I have to under-bake in my oven. The cake didn't keep it's shape well and got quite crumbly once cut. The cinnamon is a nice addition, but over all I was hoping for a richer tasting cake.

This recipe is aptly named--it just might be the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten...

No alteration was necessary, and it was a very simple cake to put together, not to mention that it tasted fantastic!  Very moist, and it stayed that way for days.  It makes a very good birthday cake.

(The recipe also works well baked in two round pans, if you want a layer cake.)

The chocolate cake is very tasty and good but the frosting was a bit too sweet and there's way too much of it versus the amount of cake you make. I'm going to try this recipe again next time with 1/4 the frosting amount and less sugar.

I've been looking for a "go to" recipe for chocolate cake for some time now - I think I've finally found it! I followed the directions almost exactly, the only difference being that I used two 9in round cake pans instead of a 9x13 rectangle.  The batter was easy to pour into the pans, and when the cakes were finished baking they were easy to turn out of the pans. The frosting (more like a glaze) was great and made the cake extra moist. Even my husband, who's my biggest baking critic, loved this cake! Next time I'll try it for cupcakes... this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the exact same recipe that can be found on another website/magazine.  I reduced the cinnamon and don't think it tasted enough like chocolate.  I used the recipe for buttercream frosting on this website and it was amazing!  I still think I'm getting better results with altering or adding to a box mix.

This was SO easy to make, but more important it was DELICIOUS! 
I only had enough cocoa for the cake so when making the frosting I used 1/4 cup hot coffee with 2T powdered milk mixed in it. Then I added a packet of hot cocoa mix and a couple tablespoons of kahlua. Then.. just for good measure i added another small splash of kahlua when I added the powdered sugar and pecans. It was incredible!

I wanted a quick rich, moist chocolate cake, and this recipe delivered it exactly as promised.  It was super easy and cooked really fast. We were all amazed at how rich and chocolatey it was, and it was SO MOIST!  The kids loved it. I suggest you follow it and do not leave out the cinnamon.  It is a great balance with the sweet chocolate.  I did up the cocoa to 1/3 cup though.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake is quick, easy and it works!  It does not compare to fancy, layered cakes with exotic fillings, etc... But when you need a basic, quick chocolate cake this one can't be beat.  It cooked in 20 min. in my gas oven and I tested with a knife stuck in the middle.  The knife will come out clean.  The chocolate flavor with cinnamon is great.  Even the picky eaters at my work liked this one.  The frosting is not "pour out of can" it is somewhat thick but spreads easily to a smooth finish.  Use a steel cake decorating knife to spread the frosting and you will have no trouble.  Really nice texture to this cake and moist too!
Fills a 13x9 nicely.

Although this cake was pretty easy to make, it took much longer than 20 minutes to bake. It smelled and tasted weird. I may not be a connoissseur of cake, but this was not too great. Sorry!

Easy to make but I didn't like the consistency of the cake, it tasted oily. It also took much longer than 20 minutes to bake.

I made this cake yesterday, it turned out very well taking into account of my wonky oven. Good texture and flavour and asides of being slightly uneven in the pan worked out fine. I'll make this cake again.

I’ve made this cake many times and have been asked to make it for special occasions and family functions. I have tried different ways to make the cake not changing the ingredients but have found  if you let the cake cool and then make your icing using refrigerated powdered sugar the icing doesnt absorb into the cake but is actually a fudge type icing. The cake still remains moist and you
Can still refrigerate the leftover cake and eat it cold.

I followed the recipe as written. Agree with others that the amount of cinnamon is way off and basically ruined the cake for me.  The cake was moist and the glaze was a good match. I would make this again omitting the cinnamon and adding 1/4 tsp of espresso powder instead to intensify the chocolate flavor.

This should never have been called "Chocolate Cake" for it's nothing like what one would expect. I had to cook it 30 minutes to get a 1 1/2" high gelatinous brownie; 20 mins (as per recipe) would have been liquid.  It's more like a flourless cake and is VERY sweet (yuck, for my taste). I left out the cinnamon & I'm glad I did. If you want cake; run from this recipe. If my description is what you want, go for it.

Made this for my 6 year old daughter today! Came out wonderfully! I made it with Stevia because the kids are a little crazy on the sugar, and as a half the time healthy woman nowadays, I don't want to be a stick in the mud on birthdays! Thanks for a great cake!

It tasted great but tried making this in a 9 x 13 pan twice.  Greased and floured pan as directed but still stuck both times.

After reading wildly mixed reviews, I decided to make the cake as the recipe indicated except I cut the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp as I used a high quality, very flavorful cinnamon.  It was excellent in a 9 x 13 air-lined pan although I baked it for 35 minutes until a toothpick came out clean.  It came out perfectly and had a delightful flavor that was very surprising.  I made a conventional chocolate buttercream frosting and put it on a warm cake.  It got 5-star rating from my husband who was very skeptical about the cinnamon.  I will definitely add this to my favorite recipe repertoire.  With the exception of longer bake time, not sure how anyone could screw up this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, CandaceMarie!

Great, moist, chocolate cake. The cinnamon enhanced the warm, rich flavor of chocolate. Buttermilk is always a winner for reach, moist cakes. Definitely keeping this recipe!

This cake was good but not great even tho I cut the cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp it was still to much...also the time on this is wrong needs to cook for 30 min instead of 20. To me it wasn't a very moist cake. Definantly not my fav.

This is seriously the best chocolate cake EVER. Followed the recipe exactly, but cut the cinnamon in half, and used 9in round cake plans. The icing was a little tricky this way, but turned out so amazing!! My whole family loved it.

I was VERY disappointed in this cake.  I am searching for the best ever and this is NOT it.  I will say this, it is very easy to make and the frosting is delicious.  When I find the best cake I may put this frosting on it.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a little extra cocoa and kept the same amount of cinnamon. Outstanding! Moist and full of chocolate flavor.

This is the first time I am giving any recipe five stars. I make this as a round layered cake at every special occasion.  Must cool cakes completely in the pans before turning out.  I follow the other user's idea and pile the two layers directly on top of each other, then use chop sticks to punch lots of holes all over the cake before pouring on the hot icing.

This is my favorite cake recipe ever and the one I make most often! I have not tried making the icing in this recipe. I usually just cover it with chocolate ganache. I whip a  little of the cooled ganache and use it as my icing between the two layers of cake and I poor the rest over the top and sides. It works great as cupcakes too!
I have tried replacing the oil with more butter but I can't really tell the difference in the taste when I do, so I tend to stick with the oil since it's a little healthier. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

YUMMY!!!  The cake tasted delicious, but I had two mishaps that were most likely my fault...(1) I thought it would be prettier to bake in a bundt pan instead of a 9x13 and it took much longer to finish PLUS it didn't come out smoothly and broke up  when I flipped it onto the cake plate; and (2) I was in the process of making the frosting when I realized the recipe called for 4 cups of confectioners sugar and I only had 2 cups.  I tried to halve the recipe figuring I would just have less frosting, but when I halved the frosting ingredients it was so pasty I could barely stir it and pouring was never going to happen.  I ended up using the recipe recommended amounts for all but the sugar and it was pourable.  The cake tasted delicious, but was not fit to serve company due to the presentation factor.  I think next time I will do the frosting the same way, but let the cake cool a bit before taking it from the pan.  Otherwise, YUM!

I was so hopeful of this recipe.  At 20 minutes it could still have been poured out of the pan.  The icing turned out as a lump.  I keep reading the recipe to see what I may have done wrong.  It may have been me... just don't know what I did wrong.  My icing was like a lump; there was no pouring it.  Hmmm.  Sorry!  Glad everyone else loves it.

Baked for 32 minutes in a 9x13 and came out perfectly. I used sour cream in substitute for buttermilk. It will be swollen when it first comes out of the oven but within 10 minutes will settle nicely , no cracks and no dip! Perfect to frost  right in the dish as backup cake for birthday.

This is a great and simple cake, really easy for beginners and when you need something FAST (mine was done and iced in 30 minutes), and it has a great chocolate flavour, but it suffers just a bit in the texture department. I found this one was dense and just a bit dry, though I followed the recipe exactly. I'd reserve this recipe for a quick cake on a weeknight or for kids' parties.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  Just like some of the other negative remarks, I found the cake to hardly taste like chocolate, and I like mild chocolate.  The frosting was horrible, too.  All my ingredients were fresh and I made no mistakes.  A mystery to me as to why it comes out great for some people.  I also found that it had to cook over 20 minutes; I even left it in the oven for 5 extra mins with the heat off in an effort to not overcook it.  It rose fine, but the taste...well, it had none.  I'm sorry!  I really wanted to love it!

The texture was amazing, but the cake tasted too much like cinnamon. I would double or triple the coco and just get rid of the cinnamon in general. I put a pinch of cinnamon in the cake and it was still over powering. No chocolate flavor either

I have made this recipe twice so far, once as a sheet cake and once as a double layer round cake. Awesome recipe, the only thing I did differently was omit the cinnamon and instead of using one cup water, I used 1 cup coffee. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks

I just finished making this cake and the cake turned out perfect... The icing turned out rather thick.  Next time I will add the icing sugar one cup at a time, and see if I just used too much all at once.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. It is light and fluffy, just like cake mix. I made two round layers and used my own icing instead of the icing recipe provided. Yummm, definitely making it into the recipe box :)

literally, this is THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I EVER ATE, but I did make a few adjustments.. I substituted a second stick of butter for the oil, reduced the cinnamon to 1/4tsp, and upped the vanilla to a full tablespoon. Instead of making the frosting, I topped it with original cool whip, and served the cake chilled. It was gone in a snap. I definitely recommend this cake to anyone that is looking for a good chocolate cake-however, you may find yourself addicted to it ;)

Really good, i enjoyed the light cinnamon flavor. The  only thing that i did not like about this cake was the texture. It was moist and yummie just not like the normal cake i am used too. When my husband came home from work and looked at the cake he said its not a cake its a brownie! The frosting was really rich, and used way too much butter, is acutually pooled on top of the cake. 
I will make again as my husband liked it so much he took half of it to work the next day. (It says a lot since he dislikes cocolate.) 
The bake time on thes is perfect.

I made this for the first time ever for a work party and everyone loved it!  What a relief!  I followed some of the recommendations like leaving out the cinnamon and poking the cake with a fork after it had finished baking.  Like other comments, this cake took about 10 more minutes (30 minutes total) to be done.  A keeper!

This really is the best chocolate cake you ever ate. I didnt have buttermilk in the fridge so you can just take 1/2 tbsp on white vinegar and 1/2 cup of milk and let it sit for 5 mins, does the same thing. This cake was a hit and is now my favorite!

Note: I only made the cake, not the frosting. 
The cake was so tasty!!! The batter didn't bake up very high, but that is ok. When I over filled the pan, it looked a little deflated, but when I filled it correctly, it was perfect. I made some peanut butter icing and made the batter into cupcakes, it was a huge hit! I also filled some with a rasberry jam icing, and made a choco-pb&j cupcakes. They were very popular at my boyfriend's birthday. I already have been asked to make them again!

This was a really easy cake to make. My first chocolate cake ever for a friend's bday. It turned out really well. I have no complaints, but it tasted a bit too sweet. I think those 2 cups of confectioners sugar for the frosting is a bit too much. But then again, everyone's taste is different. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, it's very moist and tasty with a great texture.

I make this cake on a regular basis as the dessert for us!! Love it! :) I don't change a thing about the cake recipe though I do make a cream cheese chocolate or butter cream frosting frosting instead! The cake is moist and stays that way! I have also made it into a heart shaped 3 layer cake as well! :)

AMAZING! Very simple to make, and the frosting is easy as well! Due to the super yummy sweetness of this cake I managed to get 32 servings of this. Just enough to tempt the tastebuds of my husbands coworkers!

The Name says it all!  This is definitely the best chocolate cake I ever ate in my life!!  The only changes I made were in changing the cinammon to black pepper.  This cake is truly addictive!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I just made this cake and it isnt very good. The cake itself its very soft and isnt too bad but the frosting tastes odd. I followed the recipe word by word except for the cinnamon - I only added 1/2 a teaspoon. It also took more than 30 minutes to bake.

I  made this cake for my sweetheart for Valentine's Day and she loved it.  It is really moist and rich and the icing is awesome.  I was told by her and others that they don't usually like homemade icing, but this was good.  Also, the hint of cinnamon in the cake made it really tasty.  I'm going to make this again, but try and cut it in half.  24 servings is a bit much for just the two of us.  Didn't help my diet at all :)

Loved this cake! I used 1/3 cup cocoa powder in the cake, and cut the amount of powdered sugar in the frosting by at least 1/2 cup.  Also, used all butter in the cake, and didn't add the cinnamon. Moist and yummy!

Yep, they got it right - took this to a friend's birthday and was invited back for Thanksgiving dinner the next week, but only if I brought another cake!  Very moist and turned out great even at high altitude.

It's a good recipe but i wish I'd read some more the reviews before I made it. The cinnamon is completely overpowering and chocolate light. If I make this again it will be with 1/2  the cinnamon and twice the cocoa. I also had to bake it 30 minutes so the middle didn't pour out.  I doubled the cocoa in the frosting to make up for the cake and it tasted sweet and weak without it but it was good. Slightly warming the frosting (I just stuck the metal mixing bowl in the cooling down oven for a bit) made it pour nicely.

Good cake, not great though - not a very chocolatey taste for chocolate cake.  The frosting is good but 4 cups of icing sugar is WAY too much for the amount of liquid in the recipe.  Try cutting the icing sugar back to 3 cups instead.

This cake probably would have been much better if I didn't skip the 1 cup of water! But surprisingly the cake was still edible. The glaze style frosting was very good. I will try this again (with the addition of water next time!), and I would probably omit the cinnamon, as I didn't care for it in the cake.

I didn't add the cinnamon, because chocolate and cinnamon aren't two tastes I want combined and I was afraid if I tried the cinnamon I'd regret it and have 2 cakes nobody wanted to eat.  I made a double batch (2 cakes for 2 different occasions). As I was making the cake, I realized I was basically making a Texas cake.  I had to bake the cakes around 30-35 minutes before they passed the tooth pick test.  The icing is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  It was good, but I think 4 cups of powdered sugar is too much as the icing was thick and had to be "pushed" around on the cake rather than "poured" over the cake, so it doesn't have a smooth finish as I hoped it would.  My husband and I each tried a bite as it was still just a little warm so I could get my review in and we both agree it tastes like a thick Texas cake.  That's not a bad thing, we really like Texas cake.  Granted, I left out the cinnamon and I'm sure that significantly changes the taste of the cake, but other than that, it's a good, moist, lightly chocolate, relatively easy cake that will go great with a glass of milk or a dip of vanilla ice cream.

YUMMY! Very dark and moist cake!  The icing/frosting was rather sweet - any ideas how to keep the frosting dark, but not as sweet?  More cocoa, less sugar perhaps?  Some mentioned using a cream cheese frosting - is this recipe available on site?  Thanks :-)

I'm a little confused about this cake. We love it. Very moist and delicious, but nothing like a chocolate cake. I wish it wasn't called a chocolate cake because that's the only thing throwing me off... it's like taking a sip of tea when you think you're going to have a sip of Dr. Pepper... they're both good but it's strange when you think you're going to taste one thing and it's something totally different when you sip it. Much more like a spice type cake. But like I said, very good. The only change I made was to leave out the pecans. I was worried while it was cooking because it looks very strange. I had to bake mine 30-35 minutes at 375 in a glass 9x13. Overall: not the prettiest cake, not a chocolate cake to me, but all in all a yummy cake that I would make again (but I'll have to change the name because my tastebuds and my mind are conflicting)

This turned out so well. I have tried many chocolate cake recipes and this is IT. MOIST with a rich chocolate taste without being overpoweringly sweet. I was going to use a cream cheese icing but at the last minute decided to give this icing a shot (minus the nuts) and glad I did! Great for chocolate lovers, very fudgy. Will make this again and again and experiment with different frostings in the future. A keeper!

Wowwowwow, truly the best chocolate cake I ever made.  I put a few chocolate chips on the top when it was baking and the frosting is perfect.  Thank you so much, I will make this one again and again.  (enought butter in here to kill you, but what  a way to go!)

Just made this cake tonight. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and was very disappointed. The cake hardly tasted like chocolate, had the texture and consistency of an underdone texas sheet cake (and I even baked it 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for), and it didn't look appetizing either.

my family loved this cake. I skipped on the icing though, since my family prefers rich to sweet. They do love the slight cinnamon aftertaste. But we have a deep love for cinnamon. Skip on the cinnamon, if you don't. I made it a triple layer with chocolate cream cheese icing instead. Very different, and much more moist than any other chocolate cake I've made.

Great birthday cake, nice and solid but not heavy.  I "floured" the pans with cocoa, gave it a nice finish.  Going in the recipe box for future birthday cakes.

I doubled the cinnamon in the recipe. My husband doesn't like cake without frosting, but I didn't have anything for it. So I just sprinkled brown sugar over it the cake when it was done. It didn't last very long. We loved it. I did have trouble with the 375 degrees, I bake mine at 350.

Even though I had technical difficulties w/ finding a cake pan (don't ask me why they seemed to be all out at every store!!) This was such an awesome cake!!  This was my very first cake that I've made from scratch and it was very easy to follow and the results were even better.  Thanks Candacemarie

I am torn. The cake was delicious and super moist. Almost too moist. I don't know what happened but I could not get it out of the pan, it just fell apart, it was very sticky on the top. I used 2 9-inch round non-stick pan from the pampered chef. I had to piece it together and slather it with frosting to hide that fact. Any suggestions as to why it fell apart on me? It tasted good though. I used a maple cream cheese frosting instead.

Definitely NOT for the Chocolate lover.  The cinnamon threw it off and there was very little chocolate taste.  Even my 4-year old wouldn't finish her piece off.

I halfed the amount of cinnamon, and I wish that I would have added more cocoa powder to the cake mix.  I added a little more to the frosting and it was great!  I cut holes in the cake before pouring the frosting over.  I only used 3 cups of sugar in the frosting, it was perfect!  I will make this again, but next time I'll add more chocolate!

This was a delicious, easy-to-make cake. I don't even like chocolate cake, so I can say that this was the best chocolate cake I ever ate. The frosting has a fudgy texture which I enjoyed much more than overly sugary birthday cake frosting. The batter was very runny and I had to bake it an extra 5 minutes or so for it to set in the middle. I like that you don't have to wait to frost it. I wasn't sure it that would work but it did. The frosting sets quickly. This was a hit!

I followed the recipe exactly and for some reason it had a very funny smell--actually nauseating, so I checked to see if any of the ingredients I put in there were bad, and nothing was, so I don't know if that stench is normal.  I never even cooked it.

I made this cake recently, and it was a big hit.  Delicious and oh so moist! I cut back on the cinnamon, as others suggested, and used 3 cups powdered sugar instead of 4 for the icing. It was perfection!!!

I loved this cake! I made it today for a dinner party and everybody seemed to love it just as much as I did. 
I did make a change since I don't cook with sugar, I substituted the sugar for splenda. I was not sure how that would work with the powdered sugar in the frosting but it turned out really good! I also took anothers suggestion and used 2 sticks of butter for the cake batter instead of using half oil. This one is a keep, I'm sure I'll be making it again!

the cake should be renamed - the cinnamon flavour is too strong even after i cut down half as suggested by some reviews. it doesn't taste good w/o some frosting, and the icing in this recipe is WAY too sweet. i regretted switching to this recipe for my aunt's birthday (i usually use other recipes but saw some rave reviews about this so wanted to try), everybody complained about the soft texture (although i find moist cakes ok), and everyone asked me why i made the icing so sweet even tho i cut down 1/2 cup of the icing sugar for the frosting. i won't recommend this recipe to anyone with diabetes - this'l kill them. cinnamon n choc lovers with a sweet tooth - this should be a keeper.

I'm SO HAPPY to have found this recipe! My grandmother used to make a chocolate fudge cake that I absolutely adored and I lost the recipe years ago. I will agree with some of the reviewers in that the icing is very rich and sweet and the cake very "cinnamony" but that's what I love, love, love about it!!! (I will probably add a smidge less cinnamon next time).

Wow...this definitely is the best chocolate cake I've made! It tastes a lot like my grandmothers old recipe. The only 'mistake' I made with this recipe was when I had to make my own buttermilk (with vinegar)...I added the whole cup of 'buttermilk' instead of just 1/2 and then cooked it for an additional 10 min. It was superb! Very, very moist!

This turned out incredibly moist! The cinnamon adds a nice spice and made for a very unique cake. I cooked it for 20 minutes, but I think next time I will extend that a little bit if I'm going to cut it into a layer cake like I did this time. Along with buttercream frosting, old english vanilla custard, and a raspberry cake filling... this was an amazing cake!

Phenomenal... that's all one can really say. Even my sister who "really dislikes chocolate cake" ate it up and raved about it. I made it for my Dad for his birthday (a make up cake really) and it was perfect! I don't really even like cake and I couldn't not eat this one! I garnished the outside with mini chocolate chips which added a great texture to the finished cake.

This cake is fantastic!  Easy, too.  I didn't use cinnamon, but will next time.  Do try it and do use a little more cocoa.  Otherwise it's great the way it is.  So, so good and I love chocolate!

I AGREE!!!  I had given up on making cakes homemade (box versions always seem to come out better for me) but this cake was so delicious!! My husband loved it and it was very easy to make.  I tried to cut it in half and layer it so I could fit it in my cake dish so it looked a little messy but the frosting I put in the middle of the two layers melted into the cake and it was delicious, definately the best chocolate cake ever!!

Great cake.  Bizarre that others said the cooking time was WAY over 20. In a non-convection oven and a glass pan, mine was perfect at 23 min. Icing was great (not clumpy like some said). I left out the cinnamon after reading other reviews, now I wish I hadn't. I have not kept any cake recipes, but this one I will keep.

This cake was very easy to make, I was surprised at how fast it was to make.  I personally didn't care for the final product and the reason I am giving it 5 stars is because everyone at my sons bday party loved it including my hubby who doesn't care for cake and because it was an easy cake to make.

Was tasty and moist.  I used a round tin that was too small and had a mini volcano on my hands!  Still tasted good.  I didn't have any cinnamon in the cupboard, so look forward to trying that next time.  The icing was great, esp with the chopped pecans in it.

WOW!! I just made this cake for the first time and it is DEFINITELY the best cake I ever ate! It's SO special that my kid has friends spending the night and I put the cake in my room so they didn't eat any. HA! AWESOME CAKE and SO easy to make. Minimum mess....But it did need more than 20 minutes baking time. OH it's sooo good!

I made this cake on Christmas Eve to be served on Christmas day.  It took about 10 minutes longer than the time indicated to bake.  The frosting got hard before I "poured" it on the cake, so I had to spread it.  It was the consistency of toothpaste.  I was hoping that the frosting would melt with the heat of the cake, but it didn't happen.  When it was time to serve the cake, I drizzled stripes of Hershey's chocolate syrup across the top of the cake to make it more festive.  The cake sliced perfectly and was very easy to serve.  Everyone enjoyed it, even those on a diet.  The kids wanted seconds and thirds.  Great recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

This cake came out wonderfully. It was rich, moist, and was chocolatey enough to satisfy my husband's sweet tooth. It went perfectly with my family's favorite chocolate buttercream frosting.

YUM!

If you want to put it into two 8" pans instead, you have to increase the cooking time by about ten minutes

the chocolate cake that is supposedly " the best i ever ate," wasn't that good. i believe it may have been a combination of the flavours from the buttermilk and the cinnamon that took away from what could have been a "chocolatier" taste. mind you, the cinnamon added a certain spice that may have been softer  and smoother had it been mixed with nutmeg or substituted for all spice.

One great cake!!! Very easy and fast.  The family loved it.  The zip of cinnamon was a wonderful surprise. I will definitely be making it again and again!  Thanks.
