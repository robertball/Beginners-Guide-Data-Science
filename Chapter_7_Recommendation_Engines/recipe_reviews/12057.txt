I used a slightly larger can of tomatoes and chiles, a bag of whatever frozen vegies that I had, and some shredded cheese.  My husband loved this dish, as did I because it was tasty and very easy to make.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My family LOVES this dish. Except I use a 3 quart baking dish because the 2 quart is a little small.

This was by far the best cassarole I have ever made from AR.  It was creamy, flavorful, easy and downright good.  I did cheat and used chix fajita meat, which was preseasoned.  It turned out wonderful.  My husband and I also like Angel Hair pasta, which I did use.  Sorry for taking liberties with your recipe, but thank you for giving it to me.

I'm giving this only 3 because my husband liked it but I didn't care for it. I found it kind of bitter. I deviated from the recipe only by not including the chiles and the onions but everything else to the letter. It just seemed to be like it needed something else, though what that is, I couldn't tell you.

Chicken & Spaghetti Haiku: "Doubt I'll make again. Way too many leftovers. Tastes like from a box." We weren't too impressed w/ this recipe, and unfortunately, it made so much (I even skipped the optional canned tomatoes, and decreased the pasta) that I had to separate it into 2 baking dishes, freezing one for a *sigh*'nother night. (Although, when I go to thaw and bake round 2, I'll have to add some seasonings to make it more palatable.) I used fresh mushrooms, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. (Except my cringing at the phrase "processed cheese food", so I topped w/ grated cheddar.) Did not like the onions being raw at all, so I would suggest lightly sauteeing the onions and mushrooms (+ minced garlic perhaps) in a little EVOO b4 mixing everything together. Upon serving the dish, it seemed like it would be a pleasant, homey casserole, but the taste was yawn-inducing. I thought for sure that my 3-year old would eat it; I mean, chicken, carrots, noodles - kid staples! - but it was a labored supper experience, all of us trying to finish our plates.

Great recipe without changes. I did use on another occassion shreaded colby jack in lieu of cheese food and added to Tbs cream cheese and fresh mushroom sauteed witha medium onion. A cup of brocolli is nice change with the cauliflower and carrots. The option tom and green chili is the secret in my opinion for a little bite.

If I would've made this dish by just the recipe given I think it would have been bland.  I used fresh broccoli and baby carrots (bite size).  I boiled them for 10 minutes before adding them to the dish.  I used fresh cherry tomatoes, cut in half. I used tons of garlic powder, oregano and basil.  Load it on!  I used 2 cans of mushroom soup instead of one.  I used cheddar cheese.  Made this way it tasted like something you'd get in a restaurant and I give it 5 stars.  Made only as the recipe states...I can't imagine eating it like that...no spices...not even salt of pepper.  No way.  Mine was delicious and my husband raved!

It was ok. If I make again adding peppers as well as Chile’s with cream af mushroom soup might add more flavor to the dish

I know I'll make this again...but leave off the cheese and bake in a casserole dish with a lid. I used sharp cheddar, maybe the processed cheese would have been creamier, but I don't eat that. I made a lot of changes - don't mean to insult Roxanna - great recipe idea! There was so much spaghetti I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup (low sodium). I sautéed some fresh garlic,  the onion, fresh mushrooms and carrots together. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes. I also didn't cook my pasta to al dente - left a little less done and it came out to be a perfect dish. Leftovers are terrific.

I loved this recipe! I was a bit skeptical at first because of the simplicity of this recipe but the first few reviews were good so I went with it. The only main change I made was adding 3 good tablespoons of sour cream! For cheese I used a Mexican blend and for veggies, I used whatever frozen bag I had. I skipped the additional mushrooms only because my bf isn't crazy about them. I also decided to forgo the tomatoes. Very delicious!! We both loved it!!

I loved this right along with the family... it was a hit and yes the cheese is the secret.. I used shredded monterey jack sprinkled all over on top.. the fam frowned because it wasnt sauce, but loved it after tasting
