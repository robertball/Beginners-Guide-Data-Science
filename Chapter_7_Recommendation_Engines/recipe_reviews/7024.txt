Using this for teacher gifts.  Was planning on using my favorite recipe from the Fanny Farmer Baking Book for the bread, but noticed that the ingredients were almost identical so I used this one instead.  I omitted the cloves (don't like them much) and after reading from another reviewer that the bread had tasted a little too spicy.  Cut back a little on the cinnamon too.  I also used cooking spray to grease the inside of the jars.  After filling half-full I placed the jars directly on the rack (as another person suggested).  They came out perfect and the recipe is delicious!  If when taking them out of the oven you noticed that they've popped out of the jar a little you can carefully (with gloves of course) press the top of the bread down gently so that the sides are away from the seal.  I made sure that the rim was clean and even with them being quite full they all sealed perfectly.  Found the pint-size wide mouth jars by where I live for only 5.99 for a dozen at Big Lots.  Plan on decorating them with 7" round pieces of material with ribbons and will print out gift tags to attach with a note to heat for less than 30 seconds in the microwave so they will slide right out and be ready for slicing.  Will definitely make them again, plan on buying more mason jars and storing them for holiday baking!  Hope this review helps...all the others did for me as well!

I've made these 5 times!  Very moist but the real key is to NOT bake them on a baking sheet.  Carefully put the jars directly on the oven rack for more even baking.  Baking on the sheet causes the middle to be not cooked with the top being too cooked!  I got so many compliments from everyone I gave these as a gift to!

I just made these with 8 ounce Jelly jars and they turned out perfect filling with 1/2 cup of batter. I will put these jars in inexpensive mugs with a packet of hot cocoa mix. wrap with cellophane and ribbon for a cute little gift. Thanks for the recipe and gift idea!!!

Fantastic!! This was my first time making banana bread and it turned out wonderful. My husband, who is a banana bread conniseur, said it was the best he's ever had. I found the jars at Wal-Mart, since I know a few of you were having trouble finding them. I also reduced the cloves from 1 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp. Like another reviewer, I scaled the recipe to make 12 jars. As an experiment, I cooked 6 jars at a time, the first time with a cookie sheet, the second time without. The bread cooked with the cookie sheet turned out just fine, however, the ones cooked without the sheet look more golden brown on the outside (the others were darker). Also, HELPFUL HINT!!, I figured out a super easy way to get the batter into the jars: pour the batter into a heavy gallon freezer bag and cut a small hole in the corner of the bag. This way, you can pipe the batter right into the jars. No mess! Thanks, this recipe is great. Can't wait for gift-giving this year! Next time I'll try pumpkin.

Very, very impressed with this method. Used the recipe "pumpkin bread" from this website and made two jars as an experiment and two loaves with the batter. In heaven from eating some still warm slides after dinner! It was very easy to pipe batter into the jar with a gallon size bag with a hole cut in the corner. I used 1 cup of batter in each jar and it cooked perfectly up to the top without going over in about 45 minutes. After about 10 minutes being sealed I heard the "ping/pop" noise that it's supposed to make. Haven't tried getting it out of the jars yet, but it doesn't look like it'll be a problem. What a fun idea, thank you! I will definitely make the banana bread and give these out for the holidays.

This bread was very good.  I will be taking it to a party in a couple of days, but I had to try one for myself, first.  One problem that I encountered was that not all of them cooked all the way, due to where they were situated in the oven. Next time I'll make certain to rotate them at the half way point.  Aside from that, they were very good and easy to make!

You can make this with 2 cups of any fruit that you like. Just be sure not to exceed 2 cups of fruit if you plan to make it in the jars. I have always made it with pumpkin puree. I double the cinnamon when I use pumpkin. I've also used applesauce, but the pumpkin is my favorite. I make this every year for gifts. I originally made it in the jars, but when it got to where I was making 24-36 each year, it was too time consuming. So now I make it in mini-loaf pans and wrap them in colored Saran wrap. Everyone looks forward to receiving them each year!

I made this recipe and it was FANTASTIC! I got rave reviews by all who tasted it and was asked several times to make more. I greased the insides of the jars with shortening,filled them half way up and they baked right to the top perfectly. The only change I made was that I used cinnamon pecans. The bread slides right out of the jar when cooled. Oh so easy, oh so good. Will be baking more of these again soon. Oh, and I have read about baking in jars. Some places claim you can keep them as long as normal jarred items (like months and years!). This is incorrect. You must eat just as  Linda states, within a week. Fun gift and presentation. Thanks for sharing Linda!

The only change I made is I only used 1/4 teaspoon of cloves because I am not a big fan of cloves.  Yummy!  My husband and I ate a whole jar of bread in one day! This is a WONDERFUL recipe for banana bread!  I have made two batches so far to give away as gifts.  I cut a 7 inch circle with pinking shears out of a fabric with Christmas designs. I unscrewed the jar ring (after completely sealed and cooled) and laid it on the lid and screwed the ring back on.  A ribbon or raffia bow tied around the ring with a gift tag is all it needs to complete the presentation of the gift.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone I have given one to has asked for it so they can make them too! For fellow Canadians, I used the 500 ml jars and they worked great.

Great recipe and fun to make. These are great for gift baskets and bake sales. I decorated the jars with fabric & ribbons and added a note to each jar with storage and heating instructions. I also made these with pumpkin instead of banana and thye turned out just as yummy. Some tips: Use a _VERY_ large mixing bowl, this makes a lot of batter. Be sure the jars are the wide-mouth, straight-sided kind or you'll have a hard time getting the bread in & out of the jars. Will use this recipe forever.

I have done this for years but with a different recipe. It is always a hit. My comment is that I don't see the need for refrigeration. If it is sealed properly it will last for 1 year. I left some on purpose for a year and it was fine.  Experiment!!! Thanks

Soooo good! Bake on a large cookie sheet, jars will be much more stable. Don't try to double this batter in the same mixing bowl it will not fit. I have a big Kitchen Aid mixer and it wouldn't hold a double batch. This is really a good recipe and everyone raves about it. Thanks Linda Jean for sharing such a fun recipe!!! I baked on a large heavy cooking sheet and they baked up beautifully, no problems. The first batch I placed on oven rack and they fell over when I checked them,like a domino reaction what a mess I had in my oven!  Before you decide how to cook, see how the jars fit on your oven rack.Then decide how to bake. Some veiwers after mine had trouble using a sheet, but I must state that I used a very heavy, stainless steel, bakery quality sheet. Not light aluminum or the unstick kind. I don't think you would get proper results if you don't. Jars should not be touching,should be enough space between jars for good heat circulation. I had excellant results this way. Good luck if you try this,just use your own judgement on how to bake.

Idea works well with any quick bread.  Don't fill the jars to more than the 1 cup measure or your bread will raise too high in the jar.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I scaled the recipe up to serve 36 instead of 24 so that I would have enough to fill a full case of 12 mason jars. It turned out perfectly the first time I made it.  Rave reviews from family and friends. It is just so neat to be able to bake in the jars.  I will be trying this technique with other recipes also.

I was the center of attention when I brought one of my "bread-in-a-jar" delights to work.  No one could believe it.  I did learn that the bread slides right out when warm.  If it's cold, I just removed the lid and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm it and the bread slid out for serving.  IThis is a great gift idea!  The most difficult part for me was finding the wide-mouth pint jars.

This recipe is very good and makes a great gift. However, I decided to coat the jars witha sugar and cinnamon mix after greasing. This gives the bread a great coating upon removal. I also increased the bananas to make it have a little more flavor.

This is DIVINE!!  I have already made it twice, and the second time, instead of jars, I put it in 3 loaf pans, and what I had left over went into a heart-shaped Pampered Chef Bread Tube. (Those had to cook about an hour.) I also cut the cinnamon and cloves in half, to see what kind of difference it made. I have no doubt everyone will love these too. I have already given this recipe to my neighbor and she has told everyone else! Thanks Linda Jean!

Awesome recipe... for those looking for jars, I found mine at Ace Hardware!  I also stapled together a cardboard "funnel" and lined it with wax paper.  It worked great for keeping the tops of the jars clean.

This was a great recipe!  Mine has lasted far longer than 6 weeks.  It can last months in the pantry and still taste "just-baked."

A friend and I have been making these, with many variations, for years.  They're always very well-received gifts and we put an expiration date on the label of ONE YEAR after we've made them.  We also don't refrigerate them; I found a year-old one in the back of my cupboard a while back and it was delicious!

This is outstanding!  The bread stays moist and absolutely delicious in the jar and is so easy to make.  I halved the recipe to make some 'testers' and they were wonderful.  It is easy to get out of the jar, and we had no problems sealing them or baking them.  The first time I put the jars on a cookie sheet, but then the jars did not cook completely evenly (top browned faster), so cook them right on the rack.  I forgot the nuts but it still tasted so good, almost like banana cake!

Making this for the billionth time tonight. I like to make some without nuts, some with nuts, and for a fun variation, the nephew loves it when I add chocolate chips! Extra thanks to the person who suggested to NOT use a baking sheet and cook directly on the oven wire.... HUGE tip. It doesn't cook evenly on a baking sheet!

It is most helpful to use a funnel that is designed for canning in order to not get any batter on the rim of the jar.  Then it is not necessary to wipe the rim of the jar when you take the jar out of the oven -- just take it out and put on the lid and ring.  Also it it not necessary to refrigerate the jars; they will keep just fine at room temperature as long as they are properly sealed.  I have kept some as long as 12 months (just to test) and it was just fine; although I suggest 6 months just to be safe.

I sent these to my boyfriend on deployment in the middle east, and he and the guys LOVED them!  He said they tasted perfectly fresh when he received them 2 weeks after I put them in the mail!  I used 14 8-ounce jars so there was more to go around.  The only other change I made was using buter instead of shortening.

This is a great recipe for banana bread.  I make similar recipes including zuchinni bread and carrot raisin bread and bake them in jars also.  If these seal correctly they actually keep for up to a year in your pantry.  We just ate some the other day from Christmas of 2009.  It was GREAT!

This is a wonderful recipe,turned out good,I always made my bread for holidays in a can,so this is a good change. But one question, how long well it last in the jar,or can I freeze it in the jar. I need to make a lot.thank you for the ideal.

I was impressed by all the wonderful reviews of this recipe.  It did taste good, but none of the jars sealed. I tried it twice! I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what I did wrong.  Since we can't use it as gifts, I guess we'll have to eat all the jars ourselves! :)

THANK U THANK U THANK U! This was the BEST banana bread I have ever had. It turned out excellent. At first I was afraid of putting the glass jars in the oven but they were fine. Next, I thought they were getting too brown, but it hadnt been 45 minutes yet. They turned out GREAT! And make a GREAT gift if I can stop eating it! Thanx again!

Three Cheers For Linda Jean!!  This is a terrific idea and the best part is, it works!  I didn’t have the bananas the day I made the bread so I used a 14oz can of pumpkin, it was great.  They sealed within minutes of taking them out of the oven.  Just as a test I waited several days and when it was time to remove the bread I just slid  a knife once around and out it popped.  Everybody I know is getting bread in a jar for Christmas.  Thanks Linda Jean.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!!! Awesome ! Follow it to a "T" !
I put the jars on a cookie sheet, added a loaf pan half full of water under the cookie sheet ! Perfecto! The steam was coming out of the jar when I sampled it!
Delicious! Linda Jean , Thanks Girl!! In going to try it with Strawberries next!

I love this!  I baked the first batch in half pint jars, and for Christmas I am making baskets with this, apple bread, pumpkin bread and fruitcake, all made in the jars.  Not using a cookie sheet was a helpful hint, but for the smaller jars, I used a muffin pan to hold the jars since they have a smaller bottom and would be easier to tip in the oven.  Even though the jars were smaller, they needed to bake the same amount of time.  My gift baskets will have 4 jars of assorted breads, tea, coco and a recipe card giving full credit to Linda Jean and this website.  I already use it for so many other things, this is just the BEST yet.  It isnot the same old same old gift basket, the jars are reusable (I will put in new lids with the gift basket in case they want to try it) and with a little ribbon and material it looks wonderful all the while staying *green* .  Thank you all for the wonderful new things to try and for the honest and helpful reviews that are posted.  Merry Christmas if you celebrate it, or Happy holiday for the holiday your family does share.

I made these as Christmas gifts.  I considered using my own banana bread recipe baked in a jar but decided to try this.  It was very good however, I am not used to the cinnamon and cloves in banana bread.  It tasted more like a spice bread because these spices overpowered the banana flavor.  This turned out great and was tastey, I just think the title of the recipe is a little misleading.  Or, maybe it's just my perception of what banana bread should taste like.

This was just GrEaT!! I honestly was not sure what to expect when I first read the recipe, but after reading all the reviews I had to try it and I was not at all disappointed.  The only spice I used was Cinnamon and I forgot the nuts (distracted by the kids).  I used a Kerr wide-mouth Mason jar, but I did still have a bit of difficulty getting it out of the jar..I am going to search for the wide-mouth straight side jars and I am sure they will work much better.  The bread is so good and moist- my family loved it and I plan to bake dozens of these around the holidays and decorate the jars.  EnJoY!!

So luscious!!! I made my first batch and had to "try" it. It was very easy to get out of the jar. I used 3/4 cup of walnuts in place of the pecans. Make sure you only fill jar 1/2 full. Ended up making 3 more batches.

I haven't tried the recipe but I did make bread in a jar using this recipe last year for Christmas gifts. Everyone raved over it. To answer someone's question about storage. I left in my pantry and I know it stayed fresh for at least a month as that is how long I had the last jar.

Yum! I made a 1/2 batch first without the jars to test the recipe and it made one full loaf and two mini loaves. I used butter instead of shortening (or is that the same thing?) and omitted the cloves. Incredibly good! I'm making the jars today to take to work for coworker presents. Thanks, great idea!

This will be the second Christmas that I have given these out as food gifts. It is the most requested recipe by my friends and family and couldn't be easier! I follow the recipe but add a bit more banana and some coconut. I have also substituted the sugar with Splenda and I dare you to tell the difference! Thanks for a great recipe!

What a fun recipe!!  My friends were amazed at Christmas and my daughter couldn't stop eating the cake.  We substituted pumpkin and loved it.  My only caution is to be sure to wipe the jars well around the edges if you have any spills as they will look much prettier and will be easier to seal.  I will use a wide mouthed funnel next time.  Thanks for a unique gift idea.

One of the best recipes (and easiest) I have tried.  I made a loaf for everyone in my department at work for Christmas and they were a big hit.  I have had several requests for the recipe.  It makes a wonderful gift and is extremely tasty and moist.  What a great idea!

I used my own recipe, but followed the directions here.  I bought Christmas material and put it over the top and a little below the lid and secured it with a few strings of raffia.  It was adorable and I was proud of them.  I'll make more next year for sure.  I'd like to try a cobbler in a jar sometime too!

Excellent right out of the oven but it really doesn't keep well.  If you ask me that's a rather silly quality in something you seal in a canning jar.   Not practical for gifts.

REALLY tasty, moist and delicious!  I will be making this again.  They make they perfect little gifts for friends, mailmen, neighbors, teachers, whoever.  But make sure you keep a few for yourself!  I made one batch and used wide mouth canning jars (1 qt.) and the batch fit into four perfectly. Try them!

I can't believe how easy this was, expecially for a person who cans all summer.  I had to purchase jars at Walmart for 8.99.  I used 1 cup of mixture(no extra) Used my canning guide that sits on top of the jar to put my batter in, no mess at all. Baked on the racks and tested with my long Pampered Chef tester. Baked so Pretty....Added a christmas fabric under the lid and added the straw like string, can't remember what it's called.lol...Printed a tag from my Christmas Cookies Goose berry cookbook and added the 30 second microwave instruction to the tag. 
I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to my double batch of bread and substituted walnuts for the pecans. I left out the cloves. It was wonderful.  I can't wait to give it to my co-workers.  I even have my nurse manager friend making it for her nurses in obstetrics and she's never canned a day in her life.
I doubled the recipe and it made 12 jars and 3 minature pans.  Of course we had to try it also..... It was Great.. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was so moist and delicious! They came out of the jar so easy also!

I froze some of the extras right in the jar and they held up for a while!!! Ohh so yummy!

I was skeptical, but oh my gosh, this is the best recipe ever.  I had one jar spill over a bit, giving me the opportunity to actually taste the finished product before I gave the jars as Christmas gifts, and it was absolutely delicious!!  I too left out the cloves, reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. and used only really ripened bananas.  I was totally impressed with the ease of preparation, but with the end result.  I will definitely make these again, and often.

Great recipe!  I didn't have a funnel but made one out of tin foil by placing the tin foil over the jar and pushing down on it to create the funnel area, then formed the tin foil around the jar opening, and used a knife to poke a circular area out of the middle of the tin foil.  I sprayed the tin foil with PAM so the batter ran through it smoothly.  It worked great, no spatters at all, and I was able to transfer the funnel from jar to jar.

Loved the idea, however, did not care for the cloves in the recipe.  Used my own recipe for banana bread and it turned out just perfect.  Did a trial run on two jars while making my regular banana bread.  I am planning on giving these gifts to everyone this year - making zucchini bread jars also and packaging them together.  Can't wait for the reviews.

Perfect!  Was skeptical about cooking in jars, turned out great!  Made in Nov., tried at Christmas, as soon as you pop the top, the aroma of fresh baked bread fills the room.  Moist and delicious!  Will definitely add to recipe box!

This is an excellent recipe and a great gift idea for the holidays.  I have already made 6 batches.  The bread is so very moist and it smells like fresh baked banana bread when you pop the seal on the jar.  It is time consuming but well worth it!!

I tried this last night and was very pleased with the results.  Next time I will use less cloves though.  But overall enjoyed, even the hubby and kids loved it.  A keeper for sure.  It was a blast to make.  Great gift idea.

I recently made 150 jars of the banana nut bread, plus I used the recipes for other breads, such as zucchini,pumpkin,etc, for our Fall Festival at school and sold everyone of them. Everyone was amazed at the cleverness and how good it was.
I just opened a couple jars of banana nut bread that I made last year and it's just as good and moist now as it was when I made it.

I have more of a question than anything. I want to send these to my husband who can't be home for the holidays since he's deployed. Will they hold up more than a week? Boxes take typically a week and half to two weeks to get to him.

I DID use my own recipe for the second batch, filling just short of half full, as the batter was so fluffy. Worked just fine. I also kept the lids and rings in a shallow pan of water at a simmer, just as I do for canning. When the bread was done, I removed one jar at a time, carefully, wiped the rims and sealed with the hot lids and rings, treating them as I do my other canning. All jars sealed, and the one that didn't make it out as a gift for Christmas is still sealed a month later...The only problem that I can see is that a single jar is a very tiny loaf!

Very creative idea! I gave these to my coworkers and friends as Holiday gifts.   Be sure to only fill half way, I found out the hard way when I put in the first batch and they overflowed over the top of the jar!  I made one change, after I greased the jars I used a 1/4 cup sugar/ 1 teaspoon cinnamon mixture and dusted the inside of the jar before adding the batter. Came out great!  Thank you for the creative recipe!

Help! Some sites, and some reviewers here say that the sealed bread can be stored for up to one year. You say one week. Who is right?

I have used this recipe (or one like it) in the past. I do not remember worrying about the shelf life or even keeping it in the fridge. Does anyone have knowledge about this? To check for doneness, I used a long, thin, wooden kebob skewer. I used quart wide mouth jars. Attach a tag to the gift card suggesting that they first slice it in forths with a long knife. Then, lift out each wedge with the knife. Warming it first sounds like a good idea.

Oh, yes, definitely add nutmeg too! For winter holidays, a handful of chopped dried apricots (not pre-softened) made a neat seasonal variety with the bananas. And, I loved measuring half orange (or apple?) juice/half water. To those asking where to find jars: look at neighborhood garage sales,
a bazaar or a "Dollar" store. However, sterilize those jars and use only new tops and rings.

Merci beaucoup !  It is a great recipe. I also used sweet potatoes. I checked the reviews and I agree with less clove, no cookie sheet, and the funnel (plastic bag) for the filling. Thanks again.

YUMMY!  Great for camping trips!  I’ve stored sealed jars for an entire year and the bread was still very much edible, however a bit "clovey".  Next time I decide to store for more than six weeks, I'll use 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves.

What an idea!  The bread stays moist and when I make them for friends and family, I hear nothing but rave reviews!  Depending on where you live, you might want to purchase your Mason Jars during the Spring/Summer, because they are hard to find during the Chritmas Season!

Made this for a craft show but kept a few jars for myself, wanted something with coffee and this 
was excellent, thought I would find it too dry but
it was very moist and good and came out the jar without any trouble.

I was skeptical about the results but filling the jars to the 1 cup mark was fool-proof and they baked up nice and brown. The sealed jars keep the bread moist, too.

Amazing! The addition of the ground cloves really sets this recipe off. Everyone who tried these loved loved loved them.   I only had 6 jars left over to make these in, so I made a batch of muffins. I have to say that having them stored in the jars is great. somehow they tasted even better from the jar than they did in muffin form. (I had the same experience with a red velvet that I made in the jars w/ extra made as cupcakes.)   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!  (I followed the instructions exactly, as I usually do on my first attempt. Great job and perfect measurements)

The ideah is great. I used my own family recipe because other reviews. I baked 2 dozen and tied festive bows around the lids. We gave these to neighbours for Christmas. If you bake these on a cookie sheet, be sure to rotate, as some will brown more than other. Everyone wanted to know where I got the ideah. Thanks for great inspiration!

I was so excited to make this recipe for the in-a-jar baskets my sister and I do for Christmas. I give this 5 stars for the idea but a 2 or 3 for the recipe. We didn't taste banana at ALL. We decided to test one just in case. We kept eating it but it was more like we were trying to get something out of it that wasn't there. I would suggest finding a better banana bread recipe (or whatever you would like. I'm sure you could make all different kinds of bread) and using this recipe as a guideline for the baking technique. As a note, I believe we tripled this recipe and made 12 quart size jars, but had some batter left over. It took about an hour or so to bake that way. They started to look like they were going burn but turned out just fine. It was pretty moist.

Awesome recipe.  Tried it for the first time.  When it says, fill 1/2 jar with batter, DO IT.  I filled 3/4 and it was baked over the top of the jars.  I poured the bread out, wrapped it, and hand it out to neighbors, and they loved it.  Also, placed on racking for baking, the jars tipped to one side.  Next time will try putting them on baking sheets.

I have made a recipe like this for years to rave reviews. I lost my recipe and this one is just as great. When I sprayed the jars with non-stick spray I also sprinkled sugar in the jar. The hardest part of this was getting the hot jars out of the oven and putting the lids on without burning myself. I have heard that this can last up to a year unopened and in a cool dark place - I would like to try that but they never make it past a month. Even after a couple weeks they are still moist and delicous.

A delicious banana bread and a unique gift idea. I opened up one of the jars to try the bread (very moist and flavourful) and found it was easy to remove from the wide-mouthed jar (which was well greased - I ran a knife around the outside of the bread and tapped the jar mouth down on the counter; it slid right out). Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was so easy. I gave it as a Christmas gift to my family members (being that I am a college student with very little time to do much else). Everyone loved it. I kept one for myself to try and had nothing bad to say. It slid out of the jar perfectly and was delicious!

I am so impressed with this!! I can't wait to make these for the holidays. Next time, I will only use 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and add another cup of banana. Yummy!!

Cut back on the cloves and added nutmeg.
Added a handfull of rasins just 'cause I could.
This is a very nice recipe.
Maybe I'll replace the water with orange juice next batch to give it extra zing.

I made 1-1/2 recipes (exactly as written) and was able to yield 11 jars for gifts.  I did take the advice of many to bake them directly on the oven grill and it worked beautifully!  They were moist but fully cooked.  The cloves added a wonderful taste to this bread and as they were Christmas gifts for neighbors, it had a great holiday taste perfect for the holidays.  Greasing the jars, and using straight lined jars made getting them out easy.  Thanks for this great recipe Linda Jean!

Could someone please tell me why jars need to seal if going to be eaten soon.  Also, I don't understand, so again helpme (!), If the jar seals, is it liked canned---and if it is like something canned wouldn't it last for a long time....

Made this with my son last night perfect!!!! so easy, make sure your lids are nice and hot when you put them on jars, awsome taste, the only thing I will do is not fill them quite half full as we had to cut off a little off the top to get the lids on,

What a great idea!  Made these in 8-oz jars, using 1/2 cup of batter per jar. Baked them at 325, aprox.15 minutes, directly on the oven rack per previous recommendations.  They sealed perfectly!  Will be giving these as gifts with little packets of Hot Cocoa.  Thanks Linda!

Great presentation.  We did have to make it twice because the first time I accidentally knocked the jars over and made a huge mess!  We baked it without the baking sheet as others recommended.  We gave it as gifts using the exact recipe here and everyone loved it.

this recipe is a keeper! very easy! my only suggestion - place the filled jar on the rack in the oven not on a sheet.  the air distributes evenly around the jars that way.

This is the best I have ever made and tasted, I did read reviews and took their advise. I did not use a cookie sheet when cooking, I do think it cooked more even. I am very impressed with this recipe. The best of all you don't ever have to throw out those bananas any more, these jars store for up to one year as long as they seal.

I was just talking to my friend who is over seas for our country and we were talking about food. He asked me if I ever heard of bread in a jar, No I said. when done talking to him I searched the internet and found this. I was thrilled and now I will be making this for him to send over to him and his crew. I hope they all will enjoy it. And of course I have to keep 1 for me.
Thanks for the recipe

This was a great change from cookies in a jar. The bread really stayed moist. I'd adjust the spices, though, as the banana taste had a hard time coming through-tasted more like spice bread.
For my second batch, I subbed pumpkin for the banana, used my favorite spices and it was even better than the banana bread. This made a great gift but it's also nice to keep some and have fresh bread in a couple weeks with no work.

Very simple to make.  Tastes great.  The jars need alot of decorating if giving as gifts.  Not very pretty while in jars but the flavor does make up for it.  Will use again.

I made these last night and I was worried about cooking them in the jar. They were so BEAUTIFUL and tasted WONDERFUL. These were really fun to make. I love this recipe. Today I'm going to make it with Strawberries and plan to give them to my friends and relatives for gifts. Thanks so much for sharing.

Fabulous!  Thank you so much for this wonderful idea.  There are 7 jars on my counter right now awaiting some ribbon and gift tags.  The 8th one got opened as soon as my daughter and husband came through the door.  I always cook banana bread for Christmas gifts and this is a perfect presentation.    This goes in my keepsake recipe book!

I REALLY LOVED THIS RECIPE, THANKS FOR ADDING IT. I HOWEVER DIDN'T USE THE CINNAMON OR THE CLOVES, AND IT TURNED OUT JUST AS GOOD. 
I ALSO TRIED IT IN QUART WIDE MOUTH JARS, IT DOESN'T WORK AS WELL AS THE PINTS. MY DAUGHTER HELPED ME MAKE THIS, SHE IS ONLY 10. AND WAS
REAL EASY FOR HER. AGAIN THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE WITH EVERYONE.

Loved this recipe! It was so moist and delicious.   I did use butter instead of shortening.  I baked them a few days before Christmas, and just opened my last jar today, so it's been about three weeks.  It still tasted just like the first jar I opened, so I would say it will definitely keep longer than the recipe states.  After opening the jar, I slice it about 1/4 inch thick and spread softened cream cheese on it.  It is SO good that way!  I've also toasted some of the slices before putting the cream cheese on, and that makes it even better.

This is the best banana bread ever! It's more like cake than bread, but SOOOO good!! The jar thing is great for gifts, but I use this recipe when I make a regular batch too.

this is the best of the best!  I've made this recipe for years now.  My kids & grandkids love this banana bread.  I make it just as written most the time but from time to time & will handful or so of mini chocolate chips.  Great as a gift!  I've even made them in 1/2 pint jars for my single family friends & neighbors.  You have to try it!!

I've used this method a bunch of times and I'm very happy with the results.  I used my own recipe and due to this approach I end up with a super moist banana bread.  I also made a batch for my mom who can't eat a regular loaf by herself.  This is the perfect amount for a single person and being able to freeze the jars and use as needed is a wonderful idea.  I will try other recipes using this method.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  I was hunting for a banana bread recipe, and this was highly rated, so I made it but baked it in loaf pans (made 2 good size loaves).  Baked at 350 for 1 hour.  It was a hit with the man, and his kids, too!

This is a very good bread recipe, and I will definitely make it again.  The best way to preserve this bread is in the freezer.  When sealed as described, it helps prevent freezer burn, and keeps well.

Wow!  I was a little skeptical, but it came out SO good.  I made just one jar to try it out, and turned the rest into muffins, but I have to say, the bread in a jar has to be the most moist banana bread I've ever had. DELICIOUS!  I'd just say that if you do plan on moving them around in the oven for even baking, PUT THEM ON A BAKING SHEET.  THe wire rack wasn't a sturdy enough surface, and I wound up tipping it over twice.  But the recipe is perfect just the way it is, I didn't have to make any changes at all.  Five stars and two thumbs up!

I have Zucchini bread my mom made in 1988 which has been in her basement 'fruit room' which still looks just fine and which we ate a jar of recently and we are still alive.  I will add, eat at your own risk if kept for that long!

I made this for Christmas gifts for my family. I stuck right to the recipie with one exception. I'm not a huge clove fan so I only put in 1/2 the amount it called for- that made it perfect for me! (I also used walnuts instead of pecans. Next time I will add more nuts as it was a little light on nuts for my taste!) The only major issue I had was finding the right size jar. I went to two craft stores and finally settled on a jar that was a pint and had a small lip. Because of this I had to double the recipe and I still didn't have quite enough batter for all 8 jars. I did a test run with one of the jars and I filled it up a little bit more than halfway at 325 for 55 minutes. It came out perfectly! Some of the other loafs were smaller, but that didn't matter much. Everyone loved them and was so surprised! I added a cute note "Warning: avoid initial urge to break jar. To eat: cut length wise and remove. Enjoy!" I'll definitely try this method again with different kinds of breads.

Maybe I am being too critical.. I thought the bread left a bitter aftertaste.  I will use the extreme banana bread recipe on this site inside the jars next time.  I am going to have my spouse test it in the morning.. if he thinks it tastes good... i will give them away.  If he agrees with me, I will throw it all away. I will not use this recipe next time.  I will use the canning method with another recipe next time. plus, they only rose 2/3 of the way up.

Love this recipe! I have made it twice and each time I try something different, I did use half the cloves that was suggested and added coconut, cranberry flavored crasins and a cup of applesauce.
I decorated the jars and gave to co-workers they all loved it.

This was delicious and got rave reviews at outreach prayer. The only thing I did differently is to bake it in a loaf pan for about an hour. (I made 2 loaves, one 8x4 and one 9x?) I also followed the advice of one reviewer and sprinkled the pan with cinnamon sugar. Made a delicious loaf of bannana bread. Will be making this often.

FANTASTIC!!!!Kids loved it in bundt cake form or muffin form. Reduced cloves by half and left out nuts for them. Stays moist for days. This is replacing my other recipe for banana cake that I've been using for years. A GREAT FIND.

I made this over the holidays. It was raw on the inside and did not come out of the jar. I was really disappointed bc I spent a lot of time following the directions and I am not the best cook in the world. Clearly, I had to of made an error bc this recipe has very good reviews

What a novel idea.  My picky children loved the bread and giving the bread as a gift in a jar was wonderfully easy, but it looked like I put a lot of effort into it!

This recipe is fantastic.  I was searching for jar recipes to give out and found this site.  I have never made a better banana nut bread recipe and this will now go into my recipe file !!!  I forgot to grease 2 of the jars and they still came out of the jars without sticking.

Thanks for the great gift idea.  These turned out great and made wonderful presents.  Also, the house smelled wonderful when they were baking.  They are easy to make and people were impressed with the gifts.

Great recipe!  I had some problems getting the batter in the jars, even using the baggie with a corner cut-out method.  But, my husband helped getting the batter in.  I gave these as Christmas gifts to the neighbors.  They couldn't figure out how I got the bread in the jar.  I will definitely do this again.  I might try a different bread recipe just for diversity next time.

This is an awesome recipe. I love how original it is! I didn't use cloves in my banana bread because I'm not too fond of them, and the cinnamon still adds nice flavor alone. You could try nutmeg too. I didn't add nuts because I was giving these out as Christmas gifts to neighbors. Everyone seems very impressed, and I like the fact that I don't have to stress out about baking during the week of Christmas! I can bake everything ahead of time and it will still taste just as fresh as the day I baked it! Thanks for the recipe! I'm trying pumpkin next time!

I don't know what went wrong, but my banana bread didn't raise very much at all.  3 of the jars were less than half full after baking and the other jars were only 2/3 full.  The banana bread was super moist and flavorfull, but i was expecting a full jar.  I may try again.

These turned out perfect.  Every year I bake my neighbors breads or cookies for the holidays.  This year it will be these Banana Bread in a Jar. I followed the recipe and they turned out perfectly. Thanks so much for a new and different recipe.

I made this for Christmas gifts about 3 years ago then lost the recipe.  I looked everywhere online and off last year.  Couldn't find it.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  Can't wait to make it again.  I had some for a year and it was still good.

Well, this was my first time at canning anything.  What a wonderful idea for gift giving!  I actually used my own banana bread recipe though.  The ladies at work insisted I bring in a jar because they had never heard of "bread in a jar"!  Love it!  Thank you!

This recipe is wonderful!! I made about 30 jars for my deployed Army SGT hubby and his fellow soldiers for the holidays. Not only was the bread edible after traveling 7000 miles, but my hubby and his friends ate all 30 jars in a week!

Great recipe!  I omited the cloves due to other reviews citing that it was too strong of a flavor.  Very moist!  I preheated a jelly roll pan in the oven before placing jars on top.  They came out perfect per the time table.  Flavor while excellent is more of a spice cake.  Hubby and I could not detect a apple taste (we sub'd applesauce for the bananas).  Going to add these to the food baskets that I made for a few family & friends this year.  This would be great with butter (we tried that) or cream cheese!  One of the few times my hubby went nuts for something sweet!  He never, ever eats sweets but he certainly gave this a thumbs up :)  A overall five star rating and certainly would make it again.

This is a great recipe! I used pumpkin for my 1st time. Can't wait to try other fruits & veggies. Planning on freezing the jars for Christmas giving. Very moist & delicious bread!!! I tried with 8oz. jelly jars - baked for 35min. Next is the quart wide mouth jars. I made apple bread the 2nd time around. Just made banana bread in jelly jars - 8oz. Cooked them for 35 min. on a cookie sheet. Turned out fantastic!! Really a neat recipe. Can freeze them for holiday gift giving.

Very good!  Worked as well as stated, and was very well received by those I presented it to.  My daughters helped with decorating the lids with stamped labels.  This will be a keeper in my stash of "holiday gift giving ideas"!

I used my bread machine for the dough.  This was my first time to make ANY sort of roll/bread.  Simply the best!  We are now going to have these for the holidays instead of my Granny's cresents, which we've used for over 30 years! Followed the recipe exactly, except I just used butter before and after the baking. Yum, yum, yum!!

Tried this yesterday and it was such a hit with the whole family that I'm going out today to invest in jars. My sons will love having it in the pantry at all times and not have to wait till Mom bakes.

Delicious, only change was I did them in pint and a half jars baked for 1 hour or till toothpick cones out clean. By sterilizing my jars first, it has kept perfect for over 3 months!??

This is such a clever idea! I didn't have a loaf pan and I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. They turned out delicious. I will definitely be keeping this recipe for future use.

Made the banana nut bread exactly as the recipe says and It turned out GREAt! The bread is so moist and light and fluffy but hearty. I used 12 8 ounce wide mouth jelly jars for mine because it was our due date announcements and we had more than 8 family members to give them out to. Also I used really really really ripe bananas and the consistency was a lot easier to achieve.(no lumps) I am mailing a couple out too. I hope since it's jarred that it will keep without refrigeration so our family can eat it :) Overall GREAT TASTING BANANA NUT BREAD!

I have a question.  Has anyone tried making this bread with butter instead of shortening?  Also would it effect the shelf life?

Tried it. Gave it. People are asking for the recipe!!!Wonderful recipe and idea.  I did not include the cloves.  One reason is, I  did not have it in my spices and was not able to get anywhere to purchase on the fly.  Also, I feared the clove flavoring being too strong, as suggested.  It was so-o-o- delish!  If you are like me, I don't always get those bananas eaten when they look appetizing so Banana bread is a wise idea, especially this recipe.

I TRIEed this and the banana bread turned out the best i've ever tasted.  only one problem.  i didn't use the correct jars and can't figure out how to get the bread out.  the bread is bigger on bottom than the top.  So I guess I'll have to cut it in the jar and try to pull it out.  it only says to use wide mouth jars.  i considered my jars wide mouth but they are still smaller at the top.  Oh well, guess I'll have to send instructions with the gift.

What a great idea. I will be adding this recipe to my annual fall list.  My jars sealed and the bread turned out moist with flavor. Can't wait to try out other bread recipes using this method. I placed a piece of fabric over the top of the jars and tied it with some string. Looks great..

This turned out really good - kind of a funny, quirky thing to do with banana bread - but fun and really good.  I did not add cloves - as I am not a fan, and like other reviews  I only added about 1/2 t. cinnamon.  will make again when I have leftover bananas!

This recipe is great for gifts! I did what another reviewer suggested and used two cups of fruit, but i substituted the banana for applesauce and chopped apples. I also added raisins and a bit of nutmeg. It was incredible! I was not sure how to bake- with or without a cookie sheet, so i tried both. For me, they turned out better placing them on the sheet in the oven. I just placed holiday fabric and ribbon around them, and they are ready to go!

This is a GREAT gift for soldiers overseas.  I make all different types of cakes/breads in jars and send them overseas and everytime I hear that they taste as if they were just baked.  You can make any type just by filling the jar 1/2 full with whatever batter you want, the only suggestion is not to use fruits or anything that can spoil.

Changes: added an extra cup of mashed bananas.  The condensation that builds up in the jar is very unappealing to look at, not to mention some shrinkage on the bread.  Also, I had to more a little more than half of the batter in the jar, for this to rise close to the top.  Will continue to use this recipe, but may have to switch to loaf pans.

I found this recipe on the site and had to try it. It was wonderful, I am sharing it with a friend that bakes banana nut bread every Christmas and freezes it, next year, she will not have to freeze it. Thank you to whoever came up with this recipe.

I made this for Christmas to hand out to friends and family.  Everyone LOVED it - this is my new go-to for Christmas gifts.  Fabulous, easy to follow recipe.  I did not use a cookie sheet - I placed the jars directly on the oven rack.  They came out beautiful, and were very easy to shake out of the jar (I lightly sprayed inside of jars).

Love the concept of the canning jar presentation.  I posted a picture (somehow it is now showing up on it's side) of enhancements in the preparation process.  
First of all, I used "Baker's Joy" baking spray to coat the inside of the jars.  This cooking spray has flour in it (no idea how they do that) so it is comparable to greasing and flouring the jars).
One of the other reviewers piped the mixture into the jars with a plastic bag - I found that the top of a 2 liter recycled soda bottle made a perfect funnel.  The mouth of the bottle was large enough to allow nuts and chocolate chips through, but kept the sides nice and clean.  Amazingly enough, the top of the inverted bottle ended up right at the 1 cup measurement in the jar.

I have a question. Do you need to remove the bread from the jar to completely cool on a wire rack and put it back in? Or leave it in to cool completely? Thank you. The recipe is delicous!

I made this banana nut bread twice. It's moist and delicious! I did bake them right on the oven rack not a cookie sheet and they were done perfectly. I'm using these for Xmas gifts and I'm sure my friends and family will enjoy the taste and flavor. Thx for the recipe!

I made these for the neighbors.  A good hint after sealing the jars cool them upside down.  This helps the lids seal and bread loosens from the side of jars.  I made 12 jars 1/2 pints and one loaf.

Grandma Van Doren's White Bread review:  Don't underestimate the size of bowl you need to use to let your bread dough rise.  I had to move it to a much larger bowl, when I saw how much it was growing (almost overflowed) in the 1st rise.  Getting ready to bake in about 1/2 hour, and it looks like they will be 3 beautiful loaves.  Will update, if it doesn't remain a 5*.

I love this recipe! It's so moist and tasty. I make it for my coworkers a lot. Recently I used 5 bananas instead of 4 (since I had an extra banana) and it was even better. The best one I've made so far. Got so many compliments from it.

This is delicious!! I actually ran out of flour & used Bisquick for the 2/3 cup of the flour (in a half recipe), used the full amt of cinnamon, but added in equal parts of cloves & nutmeg, reducing the amt by 1/3. I also omitted the nuts because I'm not a fan of nuts in baked goods. ?? It is absolutely yummy!! I made a loaf for myself before baking it for my dept as gifts this year. Can wait to see if they love it as much as I do! ??

I make this several times a yr-they will keep in your cupboard up to a year and still be fresh and moist-must be stored in cool cupboard so it doesn't get to warm and pop the lid.

Very good presentation.  The addition of cloves was a bit much.

This bread was really good. I used 1qt. jars and used the cookie sheet and half way thru the baking I rotated the cookie sheet. I will be making this again...

Easy to make and fun to show people. It's not the best as far as taste but I like banana bread in general and usually am not picky.

Yummy!  Used 1/2 the amount of cloves as others suggested, and didn't bake in jars, since I wanted to see how it came out first.

Question:  Where does everyone get the canning jars?  I can't locate the pint size ones.  I can't wait to try this recipe.
