Used dairy-free Silk Pure Coconut milk (was in the fridge, I like it on cereal) and low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt.  The result was a smoothie that was lower in fat and calories, but at no sacrifice to flavor.  I had this for breakfast, but it could be just as easily served to the kids (or adults) as a milkshake.  I also used frozen bananas which gave the smoothie the perfect texture.  Topped with a sprinkle of coconut and freshly-ground nutmeg.  DELICIOUS!!!

I will make this again and again! I really enjoyed this recipe and makes for a great meal in the morning or when I crave something sweet. The flavor isn't really all that sweet, but it is thick and creamy. I made mine with regular coconut milk, but used non-fat vanilla greek frozen yogurt instead of regular ice cream.

Oops this smoothie was so tasty before i could think about snapping a photo, i had already drank most of my share. It was super easy and fast. I used a can of coconut milk, several scoops of vanilla ice cream and one very ripe banana. I opted to add the honey.
