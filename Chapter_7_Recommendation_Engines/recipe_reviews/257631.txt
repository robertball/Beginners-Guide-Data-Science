I've never had pupusas with this type of cheese mixture in them but it was good. I  did not use the optional curtido in this recipe but chose to make a different one. That was a mistake on my part. The one I used called for white vinegar and the apple cider vinegar makes a huge difference in the overall flavor. Good recipe but I will try different cheese next time.
