My family loves this recipe. Its so easy to make and full of flavor. I usually add more ginger and soy sauce than what it calls for.

You really have to eat it quickly after putting in the Ramen noodles, or they get mushy.  I pulled the roast apart and served it over rice.  Everyone loved it.

Not very much flavor with this dish. The noodles where so soggy and drank up most of the sauce before I could even plate it up.  The pork was the only good thing it was moist and tender so we ate that.

This was very boring.  With the exception of the pork, it was quite bland.  The seasoning was perfect for the pork however, so I will remember that.  But, as for the rest of the recipe... I think I'll scratch it.

I didn't care for the texture or flavor. I'll go ahead and splurge on three stars because my children ate it (which they don't tend to do.)

This was ok. Don't think I would make it again. I thought it would be better. Needed more flavor for me.

May or may not make this again. Added some minced garlic for taste and some shaved carrot for a bit of color contrast. I didn't put the ramen noodles in until a couple minutes before serving after I added the corn starch and soy sauce for the 5 minutes. Still seemed to lack something : /

The whole family loved this. It was so easy to make! I did add extra ginger and extra soy sauce. I was impressed with how crisp the pea pods stayed! I'll definitely be making this again.
