One of my friends taught me how to make this when I was first branching out into learning how to cook for my husband and my growing family--this was her Momma's lasagna, too! The only changes in her recipe were she used one of those large cans of spaghetti sauce (I want to say the brand is Hunt's-you can usually get them on sale for under a dollar at most stores), she added a teaspoon or so of italian seasoning to the sauce mixture and she added a generous layer of grated mozzerella cheese on the top. It bends well to whatever you have on hand (I've even made it with sausage/ground turkey or half the meat and adding in chopped veggies for the missing meat) and I've made it "lighter" with whole wheat pasta and lowfat cottage cheese/sour cream/cream cheese. It's always a family pleaser and the leftovers freeze/reheat well.

I've made a variation of this for years.  Although mine is fairly different, I wanted to suggest using a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes. One can drain it and reserve the liquid, freezing it in an ice cube tray for other uses. I then blend the tomatoes as I'm not a tomato fan, and add it in replacement of the tomato sauce.  I use fire roasted tomatoes in a can for everything that requires sauce or canned tomatoes.  
Thank you VH for posting this recipe.

I enjoyed this easy to make casserole dish...once I got past the name.  It really is nothing like lasagna and doesn't carry the strong flavors in lasagna. But with that said, it is a good, inexpensive, easy week-night meal.

This was OK.  To my family and myself it was a little bland.  I ended up adding worcestershire sauce and V8 to liven it up.
