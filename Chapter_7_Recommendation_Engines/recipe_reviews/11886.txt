I really liked this recipe, but made a few changes to make it a main course instead of a side dish.  I used brown rice penne pasta (delicious and healthy) instead of bow-tie.  I didn't have any peas, but wish that I did.  Also, I only had the little sweet peppers that you ca buy at Costco (red, yellow, and orange), and thought they were a great substitute for just red bell peppers.  Added crushed red pepper 1/8 tsp. and 2 cloves minced garlic to the sauce just to give it a little extra kick.  Then I baked some chicken brushing it very lightly with EVOO, salt, pepper, basil, and a little minced garlic.  YUM!!  I served this up layered--pasta, chicken, and smothered with the sauce.

I am shocked at how wonderfully tasty and delicious this recipe was. I never would have thought to make a sauce out of bell peppers but this recipe was awesome. What a way to start out my low-call diet! I was afraid I was going to have to eat dull, dry, flavorless food but making this recipe right out of the gate made me more optimistic.

I actually made this again but doubled the recipe to make it a main meal and my whole family really enjoyed it, including 2 teens and a toddler, as well as my mother, who was visiting.

Used a can of white beans instead of the green peas, and a handful of fresh spinach instead of parsley.  I thought I was going to need to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but after it had simmered for a few minutes with the cooked pasta and the other ingredients, it thickened up on its own nicely.  A very healthy but filling main dish and a nice flavor change from pasta sauce made from a tomato base.

This was an awesome change from the regular old spaghetti sauce. I didn't have peas so I skipped on those but I didn't miss them. This would be awesome over steamed veggies too. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this pasta!  The sauce had a nice bite and couldn't be easier to make even though I had to whip out my blender.  ;)  I added chicken breast strips that I brushed with olive oil and fresh minced garlic before baking.

This recipe is definitely going in our rotation and next time I will double the sauce and make more pasta so we'll have more leftovers. 

Thanks for posting the recipe!

Easy and good.  Portions would be a bit small if this was to serve 6, more like 4 I think.  I will add shrimp or chicken to it next time.

My husband doesn't like tomato based sauces, so I tried this out.  It was awesome!  I roasted the peppers, a tomato (I didn't have paste) and a garlic clove, and added spicy red peppers as well.  Will make again!

This was really good.  I added red pepper flakes to give it some spice.  Also, I substituted the peas with brocoli.  I will be making this again.  It is a good change instead of using tomato pasta sauce.

This was a very good dish. I would make extra sauce though to coat the pasta. This would mess with the calories though. :(

Might be a good recipe but the calorie count is almost certainly off.  Maybe since it's 6 servings out of what would normally be 4 servings of pasta, but it still doesn't seem right.

I liked this but won't add the balsamic vinegar.  It was too strong and it didn't really add to it at all.  Overall really good and easy to make.

Not at all what I was expecting. The combination of vinegar and honey made this dish a sweet and sour sauce. I didn't think that blended well with the red peppers at all. I wouldn't even try to tweek this recipe.

This was TASTEEEE!  It was a nice twist the regular tomato sauce.  Next time, after I puree the sauce which I'll probably make more of, too - I plan to put it back in the pot and add Italian Sausage to spice it up even more!  Husband and 2 year old ate it all up!  Thanks!

very good. could have used some more sauce but that's just personal preference. though i believe the calories count for this is off... by 100-150 calories but whatever.

I liked the sound of this recipe so I gave it a try with what I had at home. I wanted to make this as healthy as possible so I used whole wheat penne instead of bow tie pasta.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried. I think I should have used less than what the recipe calls for for the fresh herbs.  The dish came out a little too spicy.  Aside from that I will try some variations in the future like the other reviewers mentioned. Definitely worth trying and is easy to make if your short on time.

This is a great recipe! We have made it as a main dish with chicken. I would double the recipe if you want to use it as a main dish. I also added red pepper flakes. I skipped the fresh parsley. I love parsley but I don't like it with this sauce.

This was tasty and a nice cange from the normal tomato based pasta sauces.  I took a few of the suggestions and baked chicken, also added some crushed red pepper.  I'm not big on bow tie pasta, so I layered angel hair, the baked chicken, sauce and sprinkled with parmessan cheese.  A side salad and garlic bread completed the meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

this was a great sauce. nice change from traditional tomato pasta sauce. made a few changes but used this as a base.
mixed one zuccini and a handful of corn in to the pot with the red peppers. I also added a few dashes of worchesire sauce. delish!
mixed in the pasta and added a little mozz. cheese.. served it along side of a broccoli/cauliflower mix and sourdough bread.. WILL DEFINITLY MAKE THIS OVER AND OVER!
THANKS SO MUCH :)

I really enjoyed this!  The sauce is unusual, but very tasty.  For those that are not tomato fans, this is a real treat!  It was easy to make, and even got decent reviews from 2 picky teenagers.  I will definitely make again.

Wonderful sauce, I added some raosted red peppers to the sauce and it worked out perfectly. My 5 and 2 year old sons and husband who all hate peppers ate this sauce without any problems. I served it over ricotta stuffed rigatoni.

Bear in mind: This is a "diabetic friendly" dish, featured pastas notwithstanding. Experienced diabetic cooks and dieticians can suggest safe flavorful tweaks to this dish.   Make it 1st time per directions and you'll see it actually makes maybe 4 servings--and albeit it's eatable---it benefits one to tweak it their way.

As for the low calorie and low fat I give it a thumbs up. For those that are good with fresh herbs and spices I think one could really spruce up the flavor, without them there is not a lot of flavor. Added bottle spaghetti sauce, carrots, broccoli and diced tomato which helped however, I most likely won't make it again.

Really loved having a change from tomato sauce! I doubled it and froze an extra round for another day. Instead of peas I threw in some chopped fresh asparagus and sweet pea pods with the boiling pasta. Loved it!

This tasted amazing! what a great change-up from tomato sauce. I followed the recipe exact, except I doubled..maybe tripled.. the amount of tomato paste. A new favourite for sure.

Everyone seems to either love or hate this sauce. My whole family loved it! The flavors of the honey and balsamic complement the natural sweetness and tang of the red peppers perfectly. Based on the reviews stating it was lacking some depth, I added 2 cloves garlic, 1 shredded carrot, and one diced celery.

This was a great alternative to traditional pasta sauce. I was short on ingredients and omitted the balsamic vinegar, but it still turned out great. I doubled the chicken broth because it cooked down to nothing pretty quickly. I also added some red pepper flakes for kick and a pinch of garlic. Basically, with a pepper / broth base you can add anything you want and this will turn out great.

Very good. Next time would add some red pepper flakes and fresh garlic to give this dish a little more flavor and zip.  Will make again.

Great sauce! My only complaint is that I too think the serving sizes are a little small. I made a few substitutions to the dish that I would highly recommend. First, I added 2 (sliced) cloves of garlic, 2 serrano peppers, and a pinch of red pepper flakes (maybe only try this if you like it spicy..) to the red pepper mixture. I didn't have the peas to add so while I simmered the peppers I roasted some carrots in the oven. I combined the carrots and peppers once I pureed everything. Gave it a sweeter and fuller flavor. Delish!

This was actually a very good and easy recipe.  The red pepper sauce has a nice little zing to it and my family really enjoyed it.

This is the first recipe here that I really didn't care for.  I guess maybe I was expecting it to taste like tomato sauce, and I just found it bland and uninteresting (and a bit watery).  Maybe I missed something in the preparation.

i followed the recipe to the letter. it was basically just red bell pepper flavor. my whole family helped me search through the pantry for either something to add to this to make it better or something else to eat entirely. you would have to be a straight vegetarian to enjoy this, not just someone looking for something a little different.

This is great, and so simple to make. I agree with the previous posts that it's much better with chicken added. I'd even make this dish for company.

Really liked this. Tastes great. Added a few extra seasonings for personal taste.
