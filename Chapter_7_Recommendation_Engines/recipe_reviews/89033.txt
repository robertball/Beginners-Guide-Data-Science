As is, this recipe is pretty basic.  It's a good launching point.  When I went to the Farmer's Market with this recipe in hand, I didn't stop with the required ingredients.  I used green pepper, but also yellow, red, and purple.  Each has it's own flavor, so it brings an incredible blend to the salsa.  Also, I didn't use pickled jalapenos.  I used fresh.  It had some kick, that's for sure!  I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine.  AND, I added more cilantro (it's one of my favorites).  That's the glory of salsa......it's an empty canvas waiting for an explosion of taste and color!!!  My mother in law (who is Mexican and can make INCREDIBLE salsa) was even impressed - a rarity :-)  I will refer to this recipe in the future, but I recommend using this as a springboard for creativity!

Very good salsa. Have made it twice now. I modified the recipe slightly though. I have no red wine vinegar so used balsamic instead. I used lemon instead of lime and a red onion instead of white. I added 2 bay leaves, 3 cloves crushed garlic, 1 tsp ground corriander, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 habanero pepper instead of the jalapenos and more salt to taste. I omitted the cilantro as my fruit and veg store was out, but I would normally use it. The one habanero is plenty to make this quite hot. Will maybe use 2 next time to make it extra hot.

very colorful and refreshing.  I didn't use food processor for tomatoes, as I like a less 'soupy' salsa, so I squeeze the juice and seeds out and dice.  Used red onion, and had to add 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Used balsamic vinegar for the sweet mild flavor.  Added the zest from the half of the small lime I had and complimented the flavors nicely.  Thanks for this nice recipe.

We really enjoyed this salsa.  The only ingredients that we put in the food processor were the tomatoes and cilantro (just minced the rest).  We also added 2 garlic cloves (how can you make salsa with no garlic?!) and fresh jalepeno instead of pickled.  We used one fresh but two would have been better.  We served the salsa over homeade pita chips (cut pitas into six wedges with a pizza cutter, then separate and brush with oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and bake at 450 until browned).  Incredible meal!

This is delicious. I seeded and squeezed the tomatoes before chopping them but as they sit there is more liquid they sit in.  I drain that before adding other ingredients so the flavor is not sitting at the bottom of a bowl of salsa.  Everyone loves fresh salsa and its healthy and low calorie.  The cilantro makes a huge difference do not substitute that ingredient

This was my first attempt at making salsa, we loved it!  The only change I made was using balsamic vinegar.  Very good and I'll make again.

I would have enjoyed this more without all the cilantro - it just kills the taste of everything else. Next time I'm either going to drastically reduce the ammount or I will forgo the cilantro alltogether. Seriously, it was harsh. 

The rest of the recipe was excellent. Everything was fresh & delish. Extremely easy to prepare & any leftovers can be used for chicken, fish, blah blah blah.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for to make homemade salsa with the tomatoes I grow in my garden!  I added minced garlic and kosher salt for a little more flavor.  Delicious!

I made this in the morning, so the flavors would really have a chance to blend for dinner.  DH & I broke into it at 10am!  It's very good.  I used organic tomatoes from our food co-op, tripled the jalapenos (love the idea of using pickled jalapenos; never tried that before!), added a fresh garlic clove, 1/4tsp extra salt, & extra cilantro 'cause we love it!  Great salsa, Valerie! :-) Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I am listing what I need at the store to make this. I have a dozen tomatoes on my deck railing BEGGING me to "salsify" them. It was so nice to read the reviews for this recipe; Valerie should feel so proud. I am rating the recipe based on ease of directions and member feedback. (very well written, thanks) can't wait to see what creative bursts await me. . . . I came back to say I just made this, and it's really great and undeniably a five. It will get nice in the fridge until dinner. Inspired to make a pineapple salsa - I pulsed double the onion, cilantro, jalapeno and (garlic)- half to the tomatoes, half to the grilled pineapple cooling on my counter. Same juicy dressing. Minutes after bookmarking this, my husband emailed me the EXACT recipe from his search for a nice salsa. Now that's a match made in heaven.  Thanks again, Valerie

Make sure to add 1/2 tsp. salt to the tomatoes first, allowing them to sit a half an hour, then drain well. This helps release some of the excess juices. Great salsa recipe - I omitted the lime juice because I didn't have a lime, added 2 small cloves of garlic, and a fresh jalapeno pepper.

Forget the blender and keep it chunky  because it's a lot fresher tasting and has a cleaner look.  I tripled the recipe actually and I am very pleased.  Though I did have to drain a lot of the tomatoes' goop because it was just way too wet.

Good set of ingredients. I substituted a red pepper for the green.  I'd  also up the # of jalapeno slices, because I like spicy.  Next time, I'll try it without using the food processor; the finished product was a tad too soupy.

5 Stars! I made this for my kids with a bounty from our garden and they loved it! Use the cilantro sparingly because it is a strong flavor! I had to use more veggies b/c I got chop happy but awesome recipe!

Great basic recipe, I have been searching for one. I used the food processor as I hate to chop, just pulsed and it turned out great. Next time I will add garlic. Can't wait for the fresh produce to start coming in season.

Loved this salsa - I had a couple of tomatoes that I needed to use, so I scaled this down to 5 servings.  Used green onions instead of white (was all I had), left out the green pepper and olive oil (didn't have) and added three small cloves of garlic (salsa must have garlic imho).  I also just dumped it all in my Ultimate Chopper - three seconds, done :)  I will absolutely use this recipe again - thanks for sharing

Great Recipe!  Was not sure about the oil and vinegar, but it is a must.  I use 1-2 fresh jalapenos when available, a couple cloves of garlic minced and omit the bell pepper. Everyone loves this recipe!

I agree with ALL of the reviews that comment that this is a great base recipe!  So here are my tweaks:  doubled the salt (using sea salt), added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, used fresh jalapeno instead of pickled, added 1 tsp corn syrup, and added a 6 oz can of tomato paste (to thicken the "soupy" texture)... Next time, I'll also use less onion.

This is very similar to how I make my salsa, (minus the bell pepper). As a twist and to give it a sweeter flavor I take all the pepper, 1/4 of the cut up tomatoes and 2-3 cloves chopped garlic and broil them about 5-10min. before adding to the rest of it. Really makes a difference!

So good.  We eliminated the bell peppers and substituted a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  Also added a bit more lime juice and salt.
Great bright flavor with a smokey note from the chipotle.

my attempt at homemade salsa!  TfirsHIS RECIPE PRODUCES A SALSA THAT TASTES SO REFRESHINGLY fresh!  IT'S DELICIOUS.  WE DO NOT LIKE CILANTRO IN MY HOUSE, SO I HAD TO DO SOME SERIOUS SPICING UP TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF IT.  I ADDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS FO GARLIC, ITALIAN SEASONING, CUMIN, AND CHILI POwder (sorry, hit the caps lock by accident!!).  with the additional seasonings it had great flavor...alone it was bland.  makes a ton too - many more than 10 servings i think!!

After adding a few ingredients,and dicing instead of processing, this was exactly what I had hoped. Better than some restaurants, I've been to. Great recipe!

I used 6 tomatoes but took the juice and pulp out of 3 before adding them to the food processor, subbed 2 jalapenos for the pickled slices (NOTE TO SELF--wear gloves next time...jalapeno oil burns like heck!), added extra cilantro, garlic, sea salt and a bit of tapatio hot sauce. MMMMMMMM! This stuff was super yum!

This recipe is awesome!We hand diced all the ingredients,same size for nice presentation, instead of putting them through the processor because we like our salsa chunky instead of 'soupy'.We also added 2 whole cloves of garlic sliced paper thin & chopped almost until melted,whole fresh Jalapeno(we grow our own),a mix of Roma and Early Girl tomatoes(home grown)and half of a diced Yellow Bell for a nice splash of color.We also doubled the dressing and added a touch more Red Wine Vinegar.We went with a full bunch of Cilantro(only ingredient we put throught the processor), which wasn't overpowering at all with this recipe.We made our own white corn chips,some we sprinkled with Parmesan & Romano cheeses and others sprinkled with Chili Powder & baked.Great game day snack ! We'll DEFINITELY make this one again and again.Thanks :)

I've made this three times now. I've used two vinegars, and my favorite is the cider (the rice vinegar was too mild.) Also, I added some fresh green chilis, which rounded out the flavors a little. Fresh jalapeno gives a little more kick. We like it best with white corn chips, but it's also great rolled up in a burrito!

Very tasty! I have 2 suggestions. First, I don't like my salsa really runny, so after I processed the tomato mixture but before I poured on the oil/vinegar, I layed a paper towel square on top of the mixture twice to soak up the tomato juice. This worked great and sucked up a lot of liquid, making my salsa less runny, almost a pico de gallo consistancy. Second, I  used SERRANO peppers instead of jalapeno because they are not as hot and they were 1.99 a pound instead of the 9.99 a pound jalapenos. My two serrano's cost me 10 cents. Heehee :D
Tasty stuff - I will definately be making it again!

This is how salsa is supposed to be.  The people complaining about the cilantro are nuts! That's supposed to be in salsa.  This is a very refreshing, quick, delicious and easy recipe. I did add 2 cloves of garlic and used the whole lime, other than that this is heavenly.

First time making homemade salsa. Made it a few times b/c we had lots of tomatoes. First batch used cider vineger.  Second batch used red wine vinegar. Prefer Cider vinegar. Neighbours loved it. Thanks for sharing.

Sorry- we really didn't like it.  All I could taste at first was cilantro, so I doubled the onion and peppers and added cumin and garlic, then let it set overnight.  It didn't help.

EXCELLENT!  The only changes I made were to use mild peppers in place of jalapeno and skip the lime as I didn't have any.  I will be sure to have it on hand the next time as I feel it will enhance the flavor.  Thank you Valerie's Kitchen for sharing!

Did not like this at all. Considering all the other reviews, I thought this out be great but unfortunately I hated it. The oil seemed strange and we just did not like the consistency. Won't be making this again.

This was a very good and fresh tasting salsa!  I used a red pepper because that is what I had on hand, but I think a green pepper would have been better both visually and taste wise.  I upped the amounts of both garlic and pickled peppers to account for our taste. I will definitely make this again; it complimented my husband's famous margaritas perfectly!

Delish! It's Nov 23 & we still have jalapenos growing that we need to do something with before the frost. I used more cilantro, garden fresh habanero, jalapeno & serrano, a whole lime & several T's of garlic. Put it all in the food processor and it's wonderful! Full of flavor. Thanks!

Was a little bland since I didn't have any hotness in it.  Next time I will definitely add the jalepenos.  Also will add some garlic and salt for a little more flavor.  I added chunks of tomatoes for chunkiness and probably won't grind the ingredients so much next time.  Will definitely make again!!

I use to use salsa packets that have the spices all ready for you, but I wanted to try something different.  I didn't have to look for long.  This recipe is amazing!!  You don't even need to add the olive oil or vinegar if you don't have them on hand.  I have also added yellow bell peppers and fresh jalepenos instead of pickled ones.  Amazing Salsa!!

A quick and easy salsa...I used a hand mixer to chop up all the ingredients. Beware of the jalapenos, especially if you buy fresh ones like we did. The seeds are the hottest part of the pepper, so if you want more kick, leave in a few seeds.  But beware! Avoid touching your eyes and face after touching the pepper.  My husband wiped his brow hours later (even after washing his hands) and his face burned up!

This salsa was awsome, better than mexican  restraunt salsa.  But we saved some for 2 days in the refrigerator and when we pulled it out it wasnt bad but very different we didnt really like it then, i think it was something about the vinegar but not really sure.  If youre planing to eat most of it that day, for a get together or something i HIGHLY recommend this because it was really good.

I added the salsa to another recipe on here Quesadillas II and it made a huge difference to the flavour.  It is a shame that I am the only one in the family to like raw onions as I have to now eat the whole bowl.  Fantastic!!! as the lime and vinegar give it a real kick the cilantro is a must and in my mind so is garlic.  This will be fantastic on a hot summers day and it was pretty good on a wet, cold, windy spring afternoon.

I didn't really like the green peppers and vinegar in the salsa. I skipped the blender step because I like chunky salsa. I ended up mixing this with some store bought salsa from the local mexican grocery store, and forgot to take a picture before I did that. Thanks!!

I agree with a previous review - it's a great basic recipe to adjust to your own taste.  I found it a bit bland after making it & letting it sit for about 1 1/2 hours, so I added the other half of the lime (along with the zest), doubled the cilantro and added more salt.  I used 4 small jalapenos from my garden -could've used more for a hot salsa.  I also added some zucchini because I had it, and 3 garlic cloves.  The additional lime really made a difference!

Great way to use up fresh garden tomatoes!  I added a clove of garlic to give it even more flavor.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to seed the tomatoes first, and I'm very glad I did.  It would have been too watery and seedy otherwise!  I only made half a recipe and still ended up with about 3 cups (1 cup per tomato, I guess).  Unless you have a big food processor, you'll need to process the onion, peppers, garlic and cilantro first, remove them from the processor, then process the tomatoes.  Mine was too full to process correctly, and I only made half a recipe!  We didn't find that the olive oil or the vinegar gave the salsa an "odd flavor" as the previous reviewer indicated, although I did use just regular olive oil, which has a lighter flavor, and not extra virgin.

This was exactly what I was looking for to use up some or our garden tomatoes. I made this to go with tonight's taco soup, chips and guacamole. My hubby and I thought it had a wonderful flavor. I bet it will taste even better tomorrow after the flavors blend more.

I love this salsa so much I make it by hand.  I find it is a simple fresh salsa that showcases fresh tomatoes beautifully.

Several other people who hate cilantro loved this salsa.

I eat this salsa on pizza, toast, salad, wraps, baked potatoes, chicken, and with chips.

I had never heard of using red wine vinegar in salsa (at least in the recipes on this site) but it really makes this recipe work! I used extra jarred hot jalapeno slices since that's all I had on hand. Great salsa!

I used canned green chiles instead of bell peppers, lemon juice instead of a lime (all I had, and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, dried cilantro leaves, and a pinch of sugar. Although the salsa is excellent as I made it, next time I will get the ingredients to follow the recipe exactly. Great recipe and one that I will use again!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I used both red and yellow tomatoes, cut down on the cilantro (not my personal favorite), added chopped fresh garlic and increased the amount of tomatoes and lime juice.  Thanks for sumbitting this recipe!  It is a great way to use up all those extra garden tomatoes!

This salsa is a lot like some expensive salsas made by a local mexican place and sold in local stores. Very very good. I'd suggest that you let it sit a day before you eat it to give all the flavors time to mature.

This was a good recipe. I subsituted red onion for sweet onion. I also chopped some tomatos and used a process with some. This is a good fresh recipe. If you are hoping for it to taste like jar salsa, it doesn't. It tastes like fresh salsa from the deli!!!

It seemed heavy on cilantro and light on tomatoes to me.  I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy but the 5 jalapeno slices were completely eclipsed by the flavor of cilantro.  People at the party I took it to ate it, but its not something I liked enough to make a second time.

I had a lot of extra seasonal vegetables from my garden to use up and was looking for a basic fresh salsa recipe. This was outstanding!!! I did use red onion instead of sweet, and also added a small cucumber and 1 "stalk" of celery to the other veggies along with fresh jalapeno. I used my food processor for everything and it turned out great, not to pureed but not real chunky. I am definitely going to use this as the summer progresses and I have more fresh tomatoes! Be sure to use the fresh cilantro if you make it, it really makes the salsa!

Great salsa recipe!  Very fresh and tasty.  I used a lot less onion than the recipe called for (most of my family hates raw onion) and it turned out great.  I also added a little bit of the brine from the jalepenos to make it a little spicier.  A big hit at my last dinner party!

I was looking for a great salsa recipe for my homegrown tomatoes and peppers, and this is it! Of course, I made some minor changes (taste preferences), but this recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I added less cilantro (I'm not a huge fan), used fresh jalepenos, and I only blended 1/2 the mixture in the food processor instead of all of it because I love the "soupy" consistency of salsa, but I also like the chunks! I wasn't sure what the vinegar would do, but it tastes delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

OMG! This salsa is so fresh, flavorful and zesty!  I did not use jalapeno peppers; and substituted red wine vinegar for apple cider.  Also, I added red onion instead of sweet onion.  The proportions were just right.....we all know that's the most important.   I will be making this Garden Salsa again.  In fact, it will be my go-to from now on.

This is an awesome little salsa! Very mild though so I made a few minor changes. Sorry Valery ; ). I put a whole jalopeno pepper for slightly more heat. It's still mild but with a bit of a zing. I added a bit more salt, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of dried red chilies. I also added 1 rib of celery for extra crunch and 1/2 of a different coloured bell pepper for colour.  The finishing touch was 1 5.5 oz can of tomato paste for thickening.  

try it and enjoy!

I would make this again and again. I've tried a few different tomato's but waiting for those Jersey tomato's because they are the best. The flavor of this salsa is the best I ever enjoyed with the heat. I do not like heat. So fresh tasting I cannot stop eating it when I start. I made it twice in less than a week and just resupplied for this weekend to make more.

This is the best salsa recipe I have tried. I use 2 whole fresh jalapeños but I like salsa hot.

I think this is a great base recipe. I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic and a pinch of rock salt and a splash of red wine vinegar to give it some zest. I also threw in about 1/2 cup feta cheese. Yum yum

Really liked this salsa.  It's a great base to make your own.  If anyone has an aversion to cilantro (I ONLY like it in guac or salsa) try adding a sprig or two of thyme leaves and/or parsley to taste.  It's a milder kick than cilantro but does the trick.

This "Garden Tomato Salsa" was very nice. We enjoyed it. The next time I make it I will seed my tomatoes so that they are less juicy (less water in the salsa) and use a yellow pepper instead of a green pepper for contrast with the jalapenos (I used fresh jalapenos). Thank you Valerie's Kitchen for sharing your recipe.

This doesnt taste bad and I used up tomatoes and green peppers ready to turn. To be honest, though, this tasted much more like a gazpacho than what I think of as salsa for some reason. I am using it for a recipe, so I think it should probably be fine.

This recipe gave me confidence to experiment with making salsa.  Once I used green tomatoes, left out the green pepper, added 1 tsp. garlic and used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of pickled.  Yummy!

My DH and I thought this was ok. We just couldnt get over the odd flavor of the olive oil and vinegar in salsa. Dont think we'll be making this one again.

This was great after I made a few changes.  I used 4 stalks of celery and 4 carrots.  I only put in three jalepenos.  I also added an entire bunch of cilantro because I love this herb.  I will make this again next year!

I used red tomatoes and yellow variety tomatoes.  I also used half of a deseeded jalopeno since I'm breastfeeding (I dont want it hot).  I also subsituted garlic salt for  salt but I think next time I will stick to the recipe and use salt because the garlic salt wasn't enough. I will also add minced garlic nextime.

This was a good, basic recipe for salsa.  It was missing something to me??  Possibly needs more vinegar and salt...??

Great recipe!  I added garlic as we are garlic lovers.  Other than that stuck to the recipe and it was great.  I used it with Salsafied Chicken and Rice (on this website.)

Good salsa.  Did add garlic and a bit more salt.
