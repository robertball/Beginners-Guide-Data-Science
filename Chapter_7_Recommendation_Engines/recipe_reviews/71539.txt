I have been known to embellish a recipe but this is ridiculous! If you don't add the french fried onions and add onion soup mix instead and if you dump a bunch of other marinades in the mix then you are not rating THIS recipe you are rating YOUR OWN!  Why not try it as stated THEN rate it or just don't rate it at all. That being said, I made this recipe AS STATED and found that it did indeed need garlic, salt, pepper.  Grilled pineapple sounds nice too.  But that is a total different recipe!!!  I rated it a 3 because it's a good base recipe.

I added fresh minced garlic to the meat/teriyaki mixture and let it mainade in the fridge for at least two hours before adding the french fried onions, and making the patties.  Also, my local market has a teriyaki/wasabi mainade, it is made by ESSENSIA, and carried by Albertsons.  It adds a nice kick above the standard teriyaki.  Durring BBq'ing, I glazed the patties with the extra teriyaki/wasabi, and opted for sharp cheaddar cheese, these modifications with the bolder flavors took this burger over the top.  while the burgers were finishing up cooking I grilled up some pineapple rings I had basted in hot vietnameese fry sauce, but you can just as easily baste them in a vegtable oil/grill spice blend, it really adds a beautiful sweet/spicy topper for the finnished burgers!

On a whim, I tried these; told my family the hamburgers had a secret ingredient. My daughter, who never likes my burgers, said they were the best burgers she's ever had. My husband, who like his burgers plain with no seasoning, said they were great. The only change I made was to season about 2 lbs of meat using these ingredients instead of one. I don't think my family will let me try anything new again, they are so sold on this recipe!

WOW!!!Delicious! Upon others' advice, I marinated the beef for two hours after I added the teriyaki sauce AND minced garlic. Also, I used dried onion soup mix  I had on hand instead of the french fried onions-but only about a third of the packet for fear it would be too salty.  Also, I fried them in a skillet instead of griling.  Talk about juicy!! Tasty, easy and delicious!!!

My family absolutely loved these burgers!
I didn't have Teriyaki marinade so I used a mixture of Teriyaki sauce and light brown sugar. I mixed that and the  crumbled french fried onions into the ground chuck and let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours. My husband cooked them on a charcoal grill and I have to say, they were absolutely deliciou! Very juicy with an incredible flavor! Instead of cheddar we used Provolone. I thought a little horseradish sauce would taste good but was out of that too so mixed some horseradish with mayonnaise and these were by far the BEST burgers I have ever had! Hubby ate it with no condiments and and raved! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

This is such a great and super simple starter recipe. I made it using ground turkey, 1/4 cup of sesame ginger Lowry's marinade, a smidgen more minced ginger and a finely chopped and sauteed medium yellow onion.  Cut down on the fat even more by serving the burger topped w/ sauteed mushrooms instead of cheese. Perfect!!

Sorry but this was not my favorite burger.  The consistancy was to mushy.  I doubled the recipe and i used 6 oz. can of the onions and maybe I shouldnt have used all of that can - I think that is what made the meat mushy.  The consistancy was like a mushy meatloaf.  The flavor was ok it still needed something though - something with a punch.  On the other hand my husband liked them and said they were the most flavorful hamburger that we have ever made.  So we had 2 totally different opinions. I am thinking grilled pineapple with this burger would be good.

VERY moist and flavorful burger!  I marinated for 1 hour in the fridge with teriyaki sauce, worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke, then added the onions.  My family really liked this one.

We liked these but not as well as some other ways we have made burgers.  I will try again adding a little liquid smoke and green chili peppers.

This is slightly better than the typical burger.  I made it as directed and it could definitely use more seasoning.  I will add some salt and pepper next time and I may try adding garlic and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Like others have said, this is a good base recipe to start from.  Also, for those of you who thought it was mushy, this is a result of having to mix ingredients into the ground beef.  If you want a burger with better consistency then you'll have to shape your burgers right out of the packaging.  Otherwise, you might try lower heat with longer cook time.

I used a garlic teriyaki marinade instead of original and man did it ever give it a robust flavor, my sister who was not keen on trying this burger said it was the best one she had ever eaten!

This was so easy and the flavor was great. A nice change of pace to burgers.  The next time I make these I will add just a bit of garlic.

Made mine with ground turkey and these came out fantastic!  Even my 7 and 9 year old gobbled them up...they didn't even realize there was onions in them, which they claim they hate.  Perfect recipe with just the right amount of flavor :)

Our house is really holding strong to the eating healthy concept for the new year, normally we've dropped that habit a while back.  I get sick of chicken and thought that these burgers would mix it up.  They were easy - my suggestion would be to use a thicker consistency marinade rather than a teriyaki sauce from the asian section of the grocery.  I did the latter and would change it next time for a deeper, sweeter flavor.  I used two tsp of onion soup mix, didn't want to use fried onions.  These went great with sweet potato fries and fresh pineapple - and were good on whole wheat buns.  Came out juicy on our George Foreman grill.

These were very good, however, they don't stay together well, especially on the grill.  But it has great flavor!!

I made these for the guys and they gave them five stars.  My husband loved the addition of the teriyaki sauce and said it made them nice and juicy.  My little guy didn't even complain that there were onions, and that's impressive!  I don't eat hamburgers, but grilled a chicken breast in the teriyaki sauce and then topped with the onions and cheese and it was absolutely delicious.  This is a definite keeper in our house!

Delicious! I seasoned the meat with some garlic and onion powder then let it sit in the teriyaki marinade over night. The burgers came out great! I'll definitely make them again.

**Made these again using ground turkey. I also chopped up some mushrooms and mixed them into the patties. I got five patties from the meat and topped them with grilled pineapple instead cheese. So good.**

Yummy.  Served this as a quick recipe when I found out my Mother-in-law was coming to dinner.  She loved in and hates to eat meat.  Lots of flavor and still tastes like a great burger.  We will put pineapple rings on it next time.

I read through all of the reviews and only found two or three that mentioned this key point: The burgers fell apart on my grill, crumbling and falling between the grill bars. The meat was mushy and simply did not hold together well. The *taste* was five-star and when I prepare this recipe again, I will experiment with a binder--maybe bread crumbs--to hold the meat together.

My family doesn't eat beef, so I used ground turkey instead. As a regular lean turkey eater, I wasn't prepared for the amount of grease that the french-fried onions would bring - but it was delicious! The burgers were a little soft, but we found that it wasn't a problem at all. I marinated the meat for about 12 hours. Definitely will make again.

I made this recipe using Lawry's Teriyaki Marinade and it was delicious!!  I didn't add cheddar cheese just because we preferred it without and it was so good.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe!! Very flavorful, moist & simple to prepare. I made mine with the George Foreman Grill & they were very easy to handle & remove from the grill plates, so I didn't run into the problem with the burgers falling apart like some of the other reviewers. I did use ground sirloin so I'm not sure if this had any effect on the consistency or not?? My only slight deviations from the recipe were I added a little bit of ground pepper & used a reduced sodium teriyaki marinade. The reduced sodium marinade had nearly 47% less sodium & they still turned out delicious. I'll be making this recipe again & I think I'll use some of the other reviewers suggestions & add a bit of garlic to the mix & grilled pineapple on top. Great ideas!! Thank you for the recipe!!

The burgers were excellent.  I used a cast iron skillet.  I made my own Teriyaki sauce a recipe form Cooks Illustrated and my own hamburger buns with beer and cheese.  Will look forward to making them again!

The teriyaki sauce I had on hand did not say "marinade" on the bottle, it is a thicker consistency that I think is probably more of a glazing sauce.  However, that's what I used and with the french fried onions made a very tasty, juicy burger.

These always turn out well, but I never find the teriyaki taste to be particularly prominent.  Still easy, and it isn't adding breadcrumbs.

Yummm...  Used the BGE to cook these.  We used 93% lean ground beef and the burgers were very moist.  We used onion cheese buns and toasted them on the grill also.  I did add a small sprinkling of pepper and garlic powder.  A great quick easy burger...  Thanks Frank!!!

Very nice; I added a splash of the Kikkoman Teriyaki marinade just before the cheese was added after my first one. I felt that it could use a bit more of the teriyaki flavor. I'll definitely make again.

We thought the onions tasted rubbery, we would have been happier placing the onions on top like a traditional burger an dthen they would have been cripy like we like them.  In addition, we woul dhave needed a lot of the sauce to have the full flavor and that would have resulted in mushy burgers.    Just a matter of preference I guess, but sounded amazing!

My company and I found these burgers exceptional. I doubled the meat so I doubled the terriyaki sauce but I didn't double the fried onions. I put about a tablespoon of minced garlic in the mix and a splash of olive oil (to keep the burgers together on the grill). I served these with avocado, which along with the chedder cheese, was a huge hit. These were very juicy burgers and did not need condiments. Will definitely make these again!!

My kids and husband really loved this burger recipe. I found it to be okay. I mixed the teriyaki sauce and meat a few hours ahead and allowed to marinate. I added the French-fried onions just prior to forming into patties. We will be making these again. Thank you for the recipe!

Something in this just didn't work for us. I think it was the format, we both thought that if this had been chunks of meat in a sauce/gravy and served over rice with some stir fry veggies, we would have liked it much better. They seemed mealy/meatloafy in texture. The flavor was good, it just didn't work as a burger for us. I didn't grill these as it was already late, so I cooked them on the stovetop. We couldn't figure out which condiments would go with this or quite what to top our burgers with as the taste was, well, teriaki. These weren't bad, they just didn't work for our tastes. Thank you anyway! I loved the idea of using french fried onions in my burgers and I will do that again.

I didn't get the meatloaf feel from this that some other people got.  My husband HATES meatloaf but loved this!  Next time I will use more teriyaki cause I shorted it a bit and was scared it would overpower the meat, but it was really good!  Definitely a keeper ;)

These burgers were very tasty!  I made a few changes though.  First I used two pounds of 93% lean ground beef.  I put the beef in a big Ziploc bag with 1 cup of Teriyaki marinade, two teaspoons of minced garlic and some salt and pepper.  Then I let the meat marinate over night.  Before grilling them I added some bread crumbs to keep the burgers together and the french fried onions.  I had no problems with the burgers falling apart on the grill.  They came out wonderfully!  They were perfect with grilled pineapple rings and mayo on the bun.  These burgers were so good they didn't even need the cheese! :)

I made this into a meatloaf because it worked well with what was in my pantry. I did add some chopped red bell pepper and some bread crumbs and an egg to hold it together and a tablespoon of minced garlic. I used regular teriyaki sauce since I didnt have a marinade and I added it on top with a few reserved crispy onions. Baking it smelled awesome and tasted good too. We had cheesy rice and green beans with it. Excellent fall food.

I made the recipe as stated and it's not bad, but not great either. I liked the French-friend onions and I will definitely use that in my burgers in the future, but this burger was only okay. We found the texture to be a little mushy and there wasn't that much flavour to the burgers. May make again, but only with the additions that others have suggested.

Great recipe as is!  It was a little hard to keep the burgers from burning.  I added some grilled pineapple to toppen it off.  This will be part of our BBQ repertoire for sure!!!

I enjoyed this, topped it with cheddar cheese.  I think it could use some kind of topping/dressing but not sure what would go with teriyaki. The wife doused hers with kechup and declared it ok.  The kids did not go for it.  Why do I bother??  :)

This is a very simple, easy in a rush to make burgers.  We were looking for something to spice up regular burgers and this was it for sure!  We used a foreman grill to cook the burgers it burned a little bit but not too bad. I will def be making this again.

These were sensational. The french fried onions were soft but it gave the burger flavor. I don't think it matters if they are crunchy or not!

Really yummy. Followed other reviews suggestion and mixed the teriyaki sauce/marinade with the meat(I used ground turkey) and mixed the onion rings in just before grilling. Loved them!

My family loved them! I did two thing differently. Instead of grilling the meat I baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 min.(we live in washington state, need i say more on why I didn't grill the meat!) And for myself, I added a pan seared pineapple ringing atop my burger!  Will deffinitely make again!

We love this recipe. But I did a few things different  I added some Soy Sauce and Stir Fry sauce that I had left over in the fridge to the marinade sauce and instead of Fried Onions I used Onion Soup mix. It tastes great! The longer you marinade the better it tastes.

i had no probs that some of the other reviewers complained of -- doubled the recipe, not mushy or falling apart.  added a bit of liquid smoke & worcestershire & garlic, as suggested by others.  my husb will like these leftover as much as cold meatloaf!!

Both of us don't really like onions but this recipe made them okay (just dealing with the heartburn afterwards). We used the colby jack cheese we had on hand, and tried the recipe as is and also with some A-1 sauce on top to combat the dryness.  Overall it was good, but we've had better.

I never have had a better burger.  I marinated beef for 2 hours in teriyaki sauce, worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke before grilling them on my charcoal grill. Definitely a repeat menu item!!

I added a little extra sauce, some bread crumbs, and diced raw onion to the mix. Adding pineapple rings on top make it a little tropical, and the burgers turn out super moist. I actually think they are even better reheated the next day, the teriyaki flavor is more pronounced.

We have made these several times this summer and love them, what a great twist on a plain ole burger, they never get dry and have a wonderful flavor.  I too tried doubling the recipe once and it did not turn out as well, too many onions, stay with it as is and try again.  I like mine with provolone cheese and the boys like it with pepperjack on toasted buns...YUM-O

Pretty good.  Turned out nice and juicy!  The flavor was more bland than I thought it would be.  I did let the mixed ground beef sit for awhile in the fridge (not the full 2 hours as others suggested), and they smelled really good while frying!

Delicious! Yesterday I was exhausted and wanted an easy hamburger recipe. I didn't want to chop anything or mess around with spices and I came upon this recipe. I thought it sounded a little strange with the french fried onions, but gave it a shot. I only had about half a container of the onions left over from Christmas. I did not marinade it and I did not use cheese. I used Kikkoman teriaki marinade with garlic and ginger flavor and 80% ground beef/20% fat. I only added a little garlic salt to it and WOW! It was so delicious....like from a restaurant delicious! Thanks so much for posting! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made these as is in the recipe and cooked them on a charcoal grill and they were perfect.  Everyone loved them, I think next time I might try some grilled pineapple to top them as suggested but other than that I wouldn't change much.

Made for the family, followed some suggestions to add minced garlic no french fried onions, used onion soup mix instead. Very flavorful and moist. Children and husband found tasty. Will make again.

Not my favorite burger. Our kids loved them but we felt that the flavor of the french fried onions wasnt right. Maybe next time we'll make some caramalized onions instead and throw in some cracker crumbs.

Great burgers! I left out the FF onions and added 2 finely chopped fresh jalapeño peppers to the beef mixture. Really nice heat! Topped with raw onion to serve and everyone raved! Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted great!  I loved the taste of the onions and Teriyaki together.  The only change I made was to use Pepper jack cheese instead of Cheddar.

A great "splurge" burger for the 4th of July!  Very rich and delicious on a toasted bakery Kaiser roll.

Fast, easy, tasty. I did mix up hours ahead for teriyaki to marinate beef.  I am going to try this with  ground turkey next time. Would never have thought adding fried onions to hamburgers. Thanks for sharing.

Great burgers! Made for a birthday party and we loved them!  I let them marinate over night and had no trouble with them falling apart while grilling.  They were moist and flavorful and the leftovers tasted great the next day. I will without a doubt make these again!

They were ok.  We added a pineapple slice and sauteed mushrooms on top.  However, the teriyaki flavor really didn't come through.  It probably depends on the brand you use.  Next time, I'll use more.

Very nice recipe.  I doubled everything and added some garlic powder and thyme.  We used 92% lean meat so it made the burger a bit tight.  

I recommend this recipe.

This was my first time to make my own hamburger.  Great taste and flavor.  My wife added a pineapple on top and really enjoyed it.  Next time in need to make the patties a little smaller, they were trying to fall apart as I cooked them.

These burgers were amazing!  I doubled the recipe and used a 6 ounce can of the French-fried onions.  I dumped it all into the mixing bowl and asked my husband if he thought it was too much French-fried onions as I started taking some out.  He said to leave them in and I did.  I cooked the burgers on a grill pan in the oven.  My older girls had friends coming and going and they ate some and thought they were fabulous.

I can't say enough about these burgers. If you love teriyaki then you will LOVE these burgers!!! I am not even a big teriyaki fan and I love them. My hubby says they are one of the best burgers he's ever had!!
UPDATE!! I hadn't made these burgers in ages and made them again tonight. Still oh so good!!!! For those of you that dont like these maybe its the teriyaki you are using. I have always used KC masterpiece honey teriyaki. you can find it in the aisle by the bbq sauce.  i usually add in some oats to and a tad bit more teriyaki. Thanks so much again for this to die for recipe!!

I think this recipe is one that you'll either love or you won't.  As a previous reviewer said, the consistency is much like meatloaf (not a bad thing in my estimation!), but I did find it to be a bit salty with the added ingredients.  Picky boyfriend says to give this a 5; I could probably go my whole life without eating this again and not miss it as I didn't care for the teriyaki flavor.  I'll make these again for my BF; just make my burger plain, please :)

I loved this recipe.  It was a good burger with a little twist.  My husband wasn't as thrilled as I was.  He thought they were too rich.  I will probably make again with a little less onion.

YUM!  I used ground buffalo (supposed to be better for you than hamburg - ?)  Used a little less teriyaki, added a little chopped garlic and black pepper.  Even hubby, who says he doesn't care for ground buffalo, loved it!  Thanks for the recipe, LuvMoores!

3.24.18  Just couldn’t see a slice of cheddar cheese on this burger, so I topped it with a slice of freshly-grilled pineapple with ginger oil and red pepper flakes...very nice.  No teriyaki flavor as I would have liked, so I’d add more sauce if I make this again.  Good, but not totally WOW’d by this, just a bit disappointed.

Whole family thought it was delicious, but we'll maybe have to try to grill it lower and slower.  It burns very easy and started a little bit of a fire.

I wasn't sure my boys would like me messing with the typical hamburger, but I was trying to use some stuff up and gave this a try.  Luckily for me these burgers were met with rave reviews.  I added some dried minced garlic as other suggested.  Too cold for a grill, but turned out great in a cast iron pan.  The ones with cheese stayed together better.  Next time I might try using an egg or something.  I even made a sauce that my boys loved It was great on the burgers even though they didn't need it.  Used some of the orange sauce and teriyaki stirfry sauce, chili w/garlic sauce a few drops of sesame oil and some reduced fat mayo and mixed.

These burgers were delicious. I didn't have the fried onions, so I grated some onions. I added some panko to keep it together. I had some coconut Gouda cheese, so I melted that on top. Then, put a grilled pineapple slice and put some wasabi mayo on the bun. I will definitely make these again.

Very Tasty!  It's good on it's own, in a bun or over rice.  Marinated it for a few hours prior to cooking.
