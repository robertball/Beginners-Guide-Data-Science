Very good, moist bread, despite the reduced amount of fat compared to other breads.  I did not use the walnuts because my kids didn't want nuts in the bread.  I poked little holes in the bread while warm and then added the glaze, which helps keep the bread moist and full of lemon flavor.  I also used lemon extract instead of vanilla.

A good bread. A little dense but with good lemon flavor. I used dried lemon zest and skipped the glaze, since the bread would not be served immediately.

Delicious! I used fresh blueberries. I also served with a blueberry sauce: 1/4 cup blueberries, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 3 tbsp water, 2 tbsp sugar. Let it simmer for 15 minutes until it thickens.

This bread was pretty good however, I feel that it was missing a little something.  I realized that it tasted awesome when you got a bite with the glaze on it.  I'm thinking with a tad more sugar and lemon in the bread this would be a 5 star recipe in my opinion.  I am willing to try though.  :)

This is a surprisingly good quick bread, easy to make and disappears like a magic trick, very healthy to boot. It's ALL good.

I made this recipe into muffins (got 18 small/med sized muffins). The flavor of these was great and they were very moist.  I found them to be extremely sweet and I did not use the glaze, and I have a massive sweet tooth. I will make these again but cut the sugar down. Thanks for the recipe:)

I've made a few loaves from this website, and this was the best one so far!  It baked up nice and tall in a well-preheated oven after only 45 minutes, so watch yours carefully.  The glaze added nice lemon flavor, and the loaf was moist enough. I used frozen blueberries, and the 2 eggs were large sized. I did make a few minor changes: I didn't bother roasting the walnuts, and I substituted plain yogurt for buttermilk.  I omitted the vanilla extract (I always leave that out when baking).   It is delish!

I used cranberries instead of blueberries and it was great! Got a little hard during the baking, but after I took it out, I wrapped it in foil and that made it moist.

A little dry.  Maybe I made it wrong.

I agree that this is a good, moist bread.  The only issue I had was with the glaze.  I cooked it for a while on low heat, but it never boiled down properly.  I added some icing sugar and it worked great.  It's a lot easier to make a runny lemon icing rather then cooking sugar in a saucepan.

Pretty good.  Though this is SUPER dry without the sauce.  DO NOT use brown sugar in the syrup!

This made a great looking loaf. I thought the recipe was fine -- the bread turned out moist and paired well with morning coffee. I doubled the recipe and I made one loaf as a gift for my mother-in-law and the other for my parents. 

The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I just felt like it needed a little something extra. Maybe some more lemon in the batter or a different glaze. I like the lemon-sugar glaze as it is, but I think if I did more of a strudel type topping next time or a powdered sugar based frosting drizzle, it would be amazing!

I made this the other night. This recipe is identical to one that I cut off of a package (plastic bag). No idea what product was now  but saw recipe, sounded good. Cut out recipe & stored away. Made it the other night. Husband loved it but I thought it was somewhat dry & not very lemony. All my (fresh) blueberries sank to the bottom of the pan so the top of the loaf had very few & the bottom was really heavy w/ blueberries. The texture was somewhat coarse too, not smooth & fine like a cake would be. Two things that affected my end result...I didn't have fresh lemon. I used bottled lemon juice & so no zest in bread, I subbed bottled juice....Also, didn't have powdered sugar in the pantry that night so I didn't make any icing/glaze at all. I really missed that!...Also, I baked in an 8x4 pan as instructed & my bread rose & spilled over the top. Luckily I'd put a cookie sheet under the oven rack which caught the batter otherwise my oven would have been a mess. Next time I'll use a bigger pan.

First time I didn’t use walnuts, and it was still delicious. This time I did plus added 1 tsp lemon extract to increase lemon flavor.  Haven’t tried it yet, still in oven, but I love both walnuts and lemon so I’m sure it’ll be great.

I only had half the walnuts but I made it anyway.  This is the very best cake I have ever made. Not fancy but delicious.

This bread is very good. I thought the amount of sugar was sweet enough, some reviews suggested using more - glad I did not.  I omitted butter and used applesauce in its place and it was the right consistency.  I did not put glaze on as fine alone.
