I only found a few things wrong with this pie, but it was enough to ruin it for me, and I feel compelled to warn anyone who is about to use their precious huckleberries on this one.  I would omit the cider vinegar.  I feel cheated wasting my $16 worth of handpicked wild huckleberries from the farmer's market on this.  Huckleberries are a rare treat with a unique flavor that deserve to stand alone, not be compromised with the taste of vinegar of all things!  I thought maybe it was my pregnancy hormones making me more sensitive, but when my husband started sniffing the pie, I asked him why, and he said, "Why does it smell like vinegar?"  And NO, I did not add any more than the recipe called for.  It was also a bit runny at slightly warm temperature where you want to serve so it could use some more tapioca or other thickener.  I tried this with a cream cheese crust which was delicious.  I know people use lemon juice in this type of pie, so that might be a better alternative to the vinegar, but probably better to just leave it out.

The pie was delicious and I would use this recipe again. Just one note, make pie crust for a double crust pie, not a single.

I was nervous about this recipe because of the effort in getting 4 cups of huckleberries. I will not use a T of vinegar if I ever make this again. The vinegar was very strong when the pie first cooled, but not too bad this morning. I still don't think it needs it, or maybe just a touch of lemon juice. These berries are not sweet to begin with. I also used minute tapioca which I think worked fine. I didn't think to brush my crust with cream or egg, and wish it would have been suggested in the recipe. I didn't need to cover crust to keep from overbrowning, which I did and it's pale. It's okay alone, better with ice cream.

This was awesome. My dad brought me back some huckleberries from Washington last summer. I usually freeze them and make daquaris but decided to make a dessert for once. Im so glad I did. A+. Thank you so much. Will make again when he brings more back this August. I cant wait.

This was a hit and set up without running all over but not to solid.  It has been a hit every time I have made it.  This year we picked 75 quarts of huckleberries and so I canned them in quart bottles.  This was a great recipe but because I used bottled huckleberries there was a lot of liquid.  I drained the liquid off and thickened it with 3 T of cornstarch, cooled and then added back in the berries and added tapioca flour, which I made by blending whole tapiocca.  Let that sit while making the crust.  The berries were bottled with a light syrup so I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c. and put in lemon juice instead of vinegar.  I also didn't add in the butter.   Cinnamon always enhances huckleberries so I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top of the crust.  This will be my stand-by from now on!

The pie was delicious! I attended a Dinner Party and tried out the pie. 
I did not have Tapioca, used 2 tablespoons cornstarch instead and it was not enough. The pie was too juicy so used small bowls. Most had never tasted Huckleberries and these were wild ones. No one cared about the bowls and whipped cream was available.  They loved it!!!

I omitted vinegar. I used 3 Tbl tapioca and was just right. 1/2 cp white sugar is enough.

Skip the vinegar!!!! I was skeptical, and for good reason.  The filling did noticeably taste like vinegar.  I worked so hard picking those huckleberries, so this was quite disappointing.  Also, the filling was pretty runny.  Many recipes call for lemon juice.  Honestly, I don't think either one is necessary, as wild hucks are naturally sweet & tangy.

Made it exactly according to the recipe and it was awesome.  I planted huckleberry plant starts (from where they grow in the wild) in my garden with good soil and the berries are as big as blueberries with no competition from trees in the woods.   This recipe is a keeper.   The smell of vinegar was noticeable while baking, but  could not detect it in the taste.

Wow! The best pie we ever had, say we party people. I had to make it 4 times this month for our friends. Although it was perfect , I ran out of sugar one time and substituted Coconut sugar. The color was darker but there was no significant difference in flavor. Also. I am an old hand at cooking so don't accurately measure. That also didn't make much difference. Much thanks goes to my son-in-law who picked the berries from a nearby island for us. Sacrificed some precious fishing time but...no regrets. Super pie.

I thought the addition of vinegar was odd, but the flavor wasn't offensive–the berries needed a bit of balance as they were very sweet.  The consistency is nice, and worked well with a lattice top (no sinking).  I used Martha's pate brisee recipe for my crust which was flaky and crisp and didn't require foil.
