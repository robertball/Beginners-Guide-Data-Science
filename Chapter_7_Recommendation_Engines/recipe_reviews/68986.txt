This was very good, but I changed it up a bit.  I didn't like the creamy puddin-like consistancy, so I added an egg and nuked for another minute then added a dash of nutmeg.  It was more like custard, and totally delish!  Thanks for idea!

Pretty darn good for something so simple. I am struggling through a lo carb diet and have yet to discover a lot of options for breakfast. This really fits the bill. Reminds me of a hot cereal. I left out the sweetener and added flax. Thanks!

I really like this idea, great for the mornings when you want something low carb but have no time for eggs...
I agree adding the cinnamon gives it more of an oatmeal flavor.  I sometimes also add a little bit of some cocoa to give it a little different flavor too.

You can also eat this cold...is a Phase 1 South Beach Diet dessert.  I always add either vanilla extract or even coconut or almond extract.

I made this this morning, on a whim, just had some ricotta to use up...I used a packet of Truvia and cinnamon and it was actually really good.  Tasted nothing like oatmeal, but more like a good hot cereal...similar in texture to cream of wheat....still I will make again! Very good!

I tried this recipe because I had some leftover ricotta cheese, and because I was plain curious. I have to say, it does not taste like oatmeal, even after lots and lots of cinnamon. I'm giving it four stars anyway because it doesn't taste bad and I think it is worth trying. It is slightly chewy, and if you use nonfat ricotta cheese this can be pretty healthy. You get protein and quite a bit of calcium.

I tried this after making a lasagna and not wanting to waste the small amount of remaining ricotta. I really enjoyed it and will make it again. The flavor is delicious and it's a great way to start the day with a healthy amount of protein and fat. Thanks for the idea!

Not awful by any means. But my family  Decided to feed this mock oatmeal to the family dog. Perhaps it was the fake taste of the splenda. Maybe I should have used Agave nectar.

Really tasty, not sure if I'd compare it to oatmeal.  Added cinnamon as suggested by another reviewer.  I'm sure most sweeteners would work, I prefer erythritol ad it worked great.  Next time, I'll add blueberries.

It lacked a little kick to it, so I added cinnamon and that made it pretty good.  I'll probably make it again.

Not like oatmeal at all.  But if you liked cream of wheat as a kid, you will like this. Warm, satisfying and simple.  On a cold winter morning it works just fine! Vanilla and and some sort of sweetener are important, but from there you can jazz it up however you like.

I really liked this! I would recommended using sugar free syrup instead of packet sweeteners to give this a better flavor. I also made this on the stove top with no trouble.

Yummy. Good if you can't face another egg in the morning, but want something warm in your tummy.
Planning on trying it cold too.

Sounded very strange, but I wanted to give it a try just to see what it tasted like.  It's really not bad, but it's not as good as regular oatmeal.  I guess for the sake of losing some of the "winter weight" I've put on, I could continue to eat it.

I LOVE ricotta and could eat it right out of the container, so when I saw this recipe I had to make it. This ended up being my dinner tonight and I'm a very happy camper. I did take others advice and added some cinnamon. Delish and thank you!

I changed the ingredients up a little. I used 1/2 tablespoon of regular sugar instead, and since I didn't have vanilla, I sprinkled in cinnamon and paprika. I like things spicy. It was delicious!

This is actually really good. I added some cinnamon and vanilla extract to give it a bit more flavor. It’s simple, quick and a nice alternative to eggs for those on a low carb eating plan.  The texture is a bit like pudding. I think this could be tasty hot or cold.

This was an epic fail for me. Started blowing up in my microwave after 1 minute so, not sure why it says to cook for 2-3 minutes? Couldn't take the grainy consistency either. Might try again with an egg, as someone suggested, since I have all of this ricotta left over.

This is good, but I will have to change a couple things next time. I used 1 T honey in place of Splenda, and it was a bit too sweet for me. I'll cut back a bit next time. I tried it when it was cold, and I really liked it. I could imagine putting some fresh strawberries on it and eating it cold. However, I put it in the microwave and set for 2 min. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned that the microwave time was too long for them. My microwave is usually close to what recipes recommend. At 30 seconds, it started to bubble and at 45 sec it started to come over the sides, even with the plastic wrap vented. I took it out, and it was all boiling and super hot. No way would it have lasted a full minute. I had to let it sit for a bit before I could take the wrap off and stir it. It was very liquidy and smooth. I sprinkled some cinnamon on top. It was okay once it was warm enough to eat. Next time I will either eat it cold or warm it for 15 seconds, stir and add another 15 if needed.

Interesting recipe - made a few tweaks. FF ricotta was what I had on hand. Added monk fruit sweetener and a tsp of vanilla extract. Cooked for 2 min with the plastic wrap then added a 1/4 cup of liquid egg. Popped back in microwave for another min. Added cinnamon and nutmeg to final product. Consistency was like cottage cheese. Very sweet. Will probably reduce monk fruit sweetener to 1/2 tbsp next time. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Great idea, and option for low carb breakfasts! Added Cinnamon and Vanilla using Stevia sweetener.  Very tasty and satisfying!  Will make again, and try other things added in!  Thanks for the recipe!

I am on a super low carb no artificial sweetener diet so my tastebuds are different.  I used the suggestion of adding and egg plus I added vanilla and cinnamon.  The cinnamon added just enough sweetness and I thought it was delicious and very satisfying (almost 10 hours satisfying!)

Great breakfast for a low-carb diet. However, use 1 tsp of real maple syrup and you will like it so much more. That gives it slightly higher carbs, but you won't have the chemical-sweetener- taste that you get with the fake stuff.

Could do this with small curd cottage cheese. Good protein source

I must admit when I read this recipe I found it to be intriguing and...well...odd. Which made me want to try it all the more. Plus I had some left-over low fat ricotta in the frig, so I figured I didn't have anything to lose by trying it. I actually never got around to nuking it because it tasted good cold. Not bad for a 3 point Weight Watchers breakfast. (It doesn't even remotely taste like oatmeal though.)

This was great. I haven't eaten oatmeal very often so I can't really compare, but this was surprisingly delicious. I made it with brown sugar instead of Splenda, and I added a little more vanilla. Thanks!
