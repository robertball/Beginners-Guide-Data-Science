I just finished eating this dish.  I don't think I would make it again as it is.  It seems to me that it is a bbq sauce want to be.  I would expand on the sauce a little bit further.  It reminded me of a bbq sauce my mother has made for years and I think it would work for this: 1 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup worcestershire sauce, 1 T of chili powder, 1 T of salt, 2 dashes of tabasco and 2 cup of water.  Put in a sauce pan until mixed and heat it up pour over the pork chops with lemons and sliced onions.....Yum.  450 for 30 minutes then go to 350 for 45 minutes.  You'll get more of a bbq sauce and it is tasty...

I have looked at this recipe numerous times. I wasn't sure I would like it or not because of the vinegar. I took one of the reviewers suggestions and used cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar. I salt and peppered the chops and lightly browned them. I removed the chops from the skillet and with the pan drippings still in the skillet I added the ketchup, vinegar and some water mixed with a little cornstarch. I returned the chops to the skillet and sprinkled the brown sugar on each of the chops. I then topped each chop with a slice of onion and a slice of lemon. I love lemon and onion so I added extra of each. I brought it to a slow boil, covered the skillet, reduced the heat and simmered it for about 45 minutes. They were extremely moist and flavorful. It is delicious served over rice with the sauce. I am so glad that I tried this recipe. Yummy!

Sorry, but the ketchup flavor is overwhelming.  This is a variation of a recipe I have used for years when I want a good, quick meal.... I place my chops in a casserole dish, put a slice of onion and 1 tablespoon of ketchup on top of each, then mix 1/2 Cup of vinegar and 1/4 cup of water and pour around the chops.  Cover and bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.  Can't get much simpler and the taste is great! Even thin pork chops come out moist and tasty.

I've used a very similar sauce recipe for many years now. You do not need the vinegar, trust me! They are very elegant and very moist. My guests have always raved over them. I would have given 5 Stars, but I've never tried it with vinegar in the sauce. For those who think its bland, add garlic powder and lemon pepper to the pork chops. I like to cook more along the southern-style, so I bread my chops in a 50/50 seasoned cornmeal and flour mixture. I fry them in 50/50 butter and olive oil until golden brown.

This was excellent.  When I browned the chops I also threw in some onion slices and added them to the top of the pork chops in the oven.  I also added 1 tsp of chilli powder and 1 tsp of worstershire sauce to the ketchup mixture.  Served it over egg noodles.  Very tasty; ketchup and all!

Far to much ketchup in this recipe. I should have folowed my instinct & adjusted the amount as no one at the table would finish eating them.

My husband and I thought it was very good.  My picky son and his friend told me the pork chops were good.  My son doesn't usually compliment my cooking.  I used 8 small pork chops.

This was good. The flavor is very strong. My family all ate it. Next time I will leave off the lemon and just use the juice. Chops were so tender.

I made this for my husband and I and we both loved it! I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and it was fine. I really like lemon, so I also put the ends of the lemon in between the chops for some extra zing!

This was a fairly simple recipe that tasted good.  I did season up my boneless chops as I browned them so that they would be more flavorful.  I was out of white wine vinegar and substituted with white balsamic vinegar.  I think that the sauce would be excellent with the changes reviewer SWEETJAM suggested.

This reminds me of an old recipe I have made in the past. I incorporated some of the ideas from other reviewers: I made a rub of garlic powder, lemon pepper and salt; then, braised the chops in a little olive oil.  Removed the chops and made the *gravy* as called for but added a little water and cornstartch. It was very good.  Hubby loved it.  I may try this with chicken.

Yikes, I'm really not sure what is elegant about this dish, but it got some interesting reviews so thought I'd try it, more out of curiosity than anything.  I don't like serving something with that much sugar (lots of sugar in ketchup) for my main meal.  This was basically ketchup and pork...(what is 1 teaspoon of vinegar really going to do?). A lot of the reviews have modifications, so aren't really reviewing the actual recipe.  Many other pork recipes out there that are far tastier and just as easy.  Will never make again.

I have used this recipe for years  and called it Lil' Abner's Pork Chops. I use much less ketchup and no vinegar. Did not precook just throw in the oven with a little water in the bottom. Best to cook on foil for easy cleanup. Cook at 300 for about 1 1/2 hrs. or until fat on the edge of the chop is caramelized. Enjoyed the variation with onion.

the lemon and tiny bit of vinegar are not enough to balance the super sweet ketchup and sugar. I do plan to try it again BUT using my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup. I think I would like the lemon flavor added to that. This version is way too sweet.

Very good recipe with the suggestions from  others. I sauteed onion rounds after the chops and added those on top. I also added a tsp of worstershire sauce. This will go  into the dinner rotation!

This recipe was good, but it wasn't great. I thought the sauce tasted like sweet n' sour. I think next time I would try more seasoning and less ketchup.

This was good and very easy to make.  A little to strong on the ketchup flavor so if you are not a fan don't make this.  But, if you like ketchup you will be pleased.  This is a nice way to spruce up boring pork chops without being too time consuming for busy moms.  I will be making it again.

I used bone-in chops I had on hand and it was good.  I was a little disapointed in the amount of sauce it made, it expected it to be like a gravy.  We had guest over the night I made it, they didn't say much but my somewhat picky husband and I enjoyed it, I will make it agian, it was easy!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was a tasty way to make a really cheap cut if pork. I will defiantly save this. I served it with garlic Brussels sprouts and au gratin...probably some rice-a-roni next time..

This tasted like ketchup and lemon smothering a pork chop.  Nothing elegant about it.  Very disappointing.

My husband and I enjoyed this. I always read the comments other people put to see how to maybe make it better.  I followed the directions then strayed alittle. When I borwned my meat, I added a little Italian seasoning. And for the sauce,  I added a little chili powder and hot sauce.  I loved the way it tasted like a different bbq sauce. We'll have to try it again :)

This is not a new recipe, but it is wayyy better with BBQ sauce. This is as common as a recipe for cornbread. Sort of a 'depression era' recipe. My great grandfather made this back in the 30's and our family has been enjoying this recipe for decades. BUT...He used BBQ sauce (not ketchup) AND you use APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, cook it low and slow...you don't have to cook the chops first. Do it all at once in the oven.

try adding a package of Homemade Gourmet® Apple Pecan Vinaigrette Mix  instead of the ketchup and brown sugar...it's healthier and taste great! www.shophomemadegourmet.com

I would suggest using a plain spaghetti sauce in lieu of ketchup or a lower calorie and less salty organic ketchup.  Ordinary ketchup is overloaded with sugar and salt. Lemon Pork Chop in its many versions is a traditional home cooking favourite.  It's fun to play around with the recipe and adjust it to personal taste.  Thanks for reminding me of this recipe.

I wouldn't describe this as elegant but I would describe it as very good.  Not exactly something you might want to serve to company.  Good served with mashed potatoes as a nice contrast to the tomato-ey taste.

This was great for a change.  I don't cook pork often, and it was definitely different.  I think I had a little too much lemon (I also added lemon juice to the sauce and put 2 slices of lemon on each chop).  But overall, very tasty and good.

It was too hot to turn on the oven so I marinated the pork chops in the ingredients and grilled them.  My family loved them.  Even my picky 3 yr old ate them.  Will make again!

Although this was an easy and quick recipe, the taste was anything but elegant. Next time, I'd substitute teriyaki or BBQ sauce for the ketchup! The lemon was a nice touch, but overall my husband and I were not that impressed with the taste.
