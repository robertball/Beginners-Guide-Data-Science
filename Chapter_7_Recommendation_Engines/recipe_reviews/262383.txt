Good. Not great but good. It needed something else to me. Probably not traditional in the least bit but some cayenne pepper would have been nice. I used English muffins as mentioned in the footnotes and they soaked up the sauce nicely. I think my main issue with this is that there wasn't enough time to cook off the beer flavor. I like beer flavor in my food but this just had a rawness to it. What I think this would be better in is a dip for soft pretzels. Just my two cents...
