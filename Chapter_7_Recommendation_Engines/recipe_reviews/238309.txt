Added onions and garlic as per other reviewer suggestions. Also used fresh spinach and wilted it with more garlic.

This was wonderful.  I wanted to use leftover Easter ham & didn't want to make a casserole.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I followed the advise of other reviews & added onion & garlic.  The sauce was really thick so I put in extra milk.  That didn't work so I put in chicken broth.  Also, the ham sort of got in the way of stirring so I took most of it out of the pan.  It was absolutely delicious.

Excellent! As usual I can't just follow a recipe - I tweaked it a bit. I added a thinly sliced small onion and some minced garlic from reading the reviews. Made this with fresh spinach just wilted it down and chopped it also added at the end a diced tomato for a bit more color. 1% milk worked just fine. And I agree - fresh basil would have been good-

Very easy recipe. Creamy and cheesy. Great way to use up ham. I used skim milk so I don't think it was as 'high fat' as a person might think. I used ground bay leaf seasoning rather than the bay leaf but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. When basil is fresh and on hand it would be a great addition.

Didn't add the spinach or bay leaf and came out great. Next time I'd add peas or broccoli for some veggies.

Very tasty with a few tweaks. I followed the recipe for the most part but added thinly sliced onions with the mushrooms. I also used fresh spinach which I added to the mushrooms and onions to wilt just before adding the flour and milk. I did not add extra salt to the dish but did add some black pepper. My husband and I both liked this and will probably make again.

This was good and came together easily. It's very rich so I think I'd prefer it as a side dish. I added some diced onion to the butter/ham/mushrooms and enjoyed the added texture/flavor (I'd add some minced garlic too if I made it again). The recipe doesn't mention removing the bay leaf before serving but be sure you do. THANKS for the recipe!

My family went bonkers over this. I did add onion and garlic because I love them. I did have to add some broth but that was probably because I was increasing the recipe and probably messed up the amounts. Lol. A big thumbs up from my family and we will be making this again.
