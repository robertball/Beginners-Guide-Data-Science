I didn't have black mustard seed, so just used the jar labelled mustard seed.  Because of no microwave, I steamed the cauliflower and added it to the onion mixture.  This is a great tasting way to serve cauliflower!

This is very tasty! Good, rich flavor, not overpowering. Greatly improves your standard cauliflower. Easy to do. Get the lid on the mustard seed quick, though, or they'll shoot all over the kitchen - lol. I'll use medium heat next time instead of medium high, as the seeds took about 30 seconds to cook, not 2-3 minutes. Also microcooked it for longer than suggested, as we prefer it a little more tender. Notwithstanding, nice recipe.

East, pretty, and a bit different.  Lemon juice made it better. I steamed it in pan as others have done.  Thanks!

I made the recipe as directed.   While the result was a pretty side dish, it lacked in flavour

it's actually quite bland given the complexity and fresh ingredients.... not worth the effort.

Love, love, love it! So flavorful and easy too. I was out of mustard seed so I just added about 1/8 tsp ground mustard to the onion sautee just before adding the cauliflower. Served with Fast Salmon with a Ginger Glaze from this site, and lightly seasoned jasmine rice. Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing.
