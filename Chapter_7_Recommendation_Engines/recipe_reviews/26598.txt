This recipe is great.  I've made this a few times and it never fails.  My husband likes it so much, I start to get a little jealous!  I followed some other reviewers and lessened the cracker crumbs to about 3/4 cup; we don't care for cooked green peppers, so I double up (or more) on the mushrooms and create the glaze to taste.  Yesterday I didn't have any saltines, but low fat Ritz worked just fine.  Also, I press into a loaf pan and then poke random holes in the meat to let excess glaze drip down into the loaf.  It really is quite a good recipe.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had.  The veggies were great, and the glaze on top was delicious.  I was looking forward to leftovers the next day for lunch, but my husband ate the leftovers later that night!  Delicious!

This is for anybody that leaves only one to three stars. Make a dish according to the recipe. Rate the recipe. Don't rate something based on how you made it, since you didn't have all of the correct ingredients. This is unfair to the author of the recipe. If there's something listed in the recipe that you are not fond of...why would you even try the recipe?

We loved this meatloaf. I did omit the cracker crumbs, I just don't like them in my food.  the eggs and veggies were enough of a binder and the taste was excellent.  thanks.

AWESOME recipe.  My husband told me to NEVER cook meat loaf again until he tried this one.  What a hit.  There was nothing left.  I used a loaf pan and cut the katsup (was too much)and added a dash of worchesire.  Thank you for sharing.

Not bad, but I think next time I'm going to try baking it in a loaf pan (8 X 4 inch) and use less sauce. My kids weren't crazy about the sauce on top, but overall I liked the flavor, might add a can of drained peas too to increase the veggies.

This was an excellent meatloaf!  It seemed a little strange when I was making it but it has wonderful flavor and holds together well.  Makes a huge portion.  Next time I will half the recipe since there are only two of us.  In addition, there really is more topping than is necessary so will decrease that.  Will definitely make again!

I can never seem to make a meatloaf that the center gets all the way done! This recipe is the answer to that! My kids LOVED it despite all the veggies that they "hate". I will be making this again!

I doubled this recipe to have leftovers the next day for the boys' lunches (meat loaf sandwiches). Instead of green bell pepper, I used red bell pepper and I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines only because that was what I had on hand. This was okay--both my husband and I thought the beef with onion soup mix was a good addition but it didn't have much flavor aside from that. I will say it held up well for sandwiches the next day though I don't think I'll make this one again.

Except for the glaze, which didn’t appeal to me, I chose this recipe for the ingredients, which did.  When I set out to make it, however, I saw it wasn’t going to work for me as written.  It seemed to me the measurements were off - I almost wondered if there was a typo, and the recipe was meant to read TWO pounds of ground beef.  I even measured out 8 ounces of crackers and there was no way I could use that much.  I probably used half the amount called for (about 1/2 c.), one egg, (again, half the amount called for), and only half of the packet of soup mix.  Those with more mouths to feed at their dinner table could simply use two pounds of meat and keep all remaining measurements of ingredients the same. I added some chopped celery and used sweet onion for the green onions called for.  I gave it some Montreal  Steak seasoning and Worcestershire for flavor and found I needed to add a little half and half to loosen the mixture a little.  I added no mushrooms since I made a mushroom gravy rather than the glaze.  When I chose this recipe I assumed the meatLOAF would be formed into a loaf, not pressed into a 9x13” pan, which also didn’t appeal to me.  I did form it into a small loaf and baked it for an hour.  We thought it was delicious, five stars for us actually, with the changes I made.   Assuming we all put our own spin on our meatloaves, and accounting for individual preferences in terms of the amount of filler, etc., I’ll call this one four stars.

This is a great recipe, but instead of crackers use 2 slices whole wheat bread, and pour 1 can of sweetened condensed milk into mixture to add flavor, then 12 cup of chopped Celery, mushrooms, sweet onion, and green pepper to give it some crunch. Then it is heavenly!!!!!!!!

My husband loves meatloaf, however I do not so I very seldom make it.  I have to admit this was the best and I will make it again.  My husband ate leftovers for 2 days and it was still as good and moist as it was on day one!

This recipe is good enough, but for the Divine part, I use equal parts of sweet sausage in with the ground beef.  Omit the soup mix as it contains so much sodium, and instead, I use seasoned salt, about 1 tsp. Saltine crackers also contain salt, and add the best flavor. NOW, to get divine, add 1/2 tsp of ground nutmeg to the ketchup and brown sugar mixture, and eliminate the mustard. This has been in my family for over 60 years, and is tried and truely Divine!  It is amazing how good it is, the nutmeg really makes this recipe pop.

With saltines and soup mix this meatloaf to my family was very salty and not that great.  They said they didn't like the flavor of it either.  Won't be making it again.  Sorry.  Don't really see where the DIVINE title came from.

This has been a family favorite for the past 3 years since I found it here. Thanks SO much! My husband RAVES about it every time I make it to anyone who will listen. I have modified it slightly to suit our tastes. I changed the following ingredients to: 1/2 bunch green onions, canned mushrooms instead of fresh, 1 cup kethcup, 2 T mustard, 8 t brown sugar. I also leave it as a loaf instead of pressing to the sides of the pan. Everything else I've left the same. WONDERFUL!!! Thank you!

This sounds great, very like my own recipe, only I don't put in mushrooms (but maybe I'll try).  Another very good tip for a lovely MOIST meatloaf is to put a large bowl of water in the oven when cooking, it will not dissapoint!

I loved using the saltine crackers.  I don't think I've made a meatloaf that called for green onions before, I loved it!  I was a little confused about the 9x13 baking dish the submitter said to use.  I threw mine in a standard meatloaf pan and it turned out fine.  I'll be making this one again soon...thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic recipe! I used this recipe, with a lot of substitutions, and it adapted beautifully. I subbed 9 slices whole wheat light bread -- in crumbs -- for the crackers. I used Egg Beaters (1/2 cup) instead of eggs, and I simmered 18 oz tomato paste with 1/3 cup cider vinegar, 2Tbs garlic salt and 1 cup Splenda for 45 min. I used this instead of the ketchup. Everything else was kept the same, and it was terrific.

Excellent.  I had 2 of my sons for dinner and they said "different".  I didn't have enough catsup, so I used some honey barbecue sauce along with the catsup.  Didn't have green onions, so I used some onion.  I made a double batch which gave me 3 nice-sized loafs.  This was delicious.

This really is divine! Everyone, including both my kids gobbled it up. It keeps well in the fridge so the leftovers were also very delish. I used corn flake cereal crumbs instead of saltines but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing.

I can only give this recipe a 3 star rating because it uses a soup mix.  It is not that difficult to use fresh or dried herbs in a recipe.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've made.Even the leftovers were moist and tasty the next day on a sandwich. Great job.

havent tried it as yet but sounds and looks yumm.The crackers will help absorb the extra moisture from the beef,and by the time the meatloaf is cooked one hardly notices the crackers.

As far as meatloaves go, this is very good. I've never been a big fan of the ketchup dressing ... but the kids love it, so its hard to complain about that.

I am not a big lover of meatloaf, but this is probably the best one I have ever tried. I omitted the mushrooms (only because I didn't have any) and used regular ground beef (that is all I had in the freezer). It was really tasty and moist, and my very picky children had seconds! I gave it four stars only because I am not a meatloaf fan.

I used 1 1/2 lb of beef and the amt of green onion and bell pepper was just right.  I used an 11 x 9 glass pan and that was perfect too.  When I make it again, I will cut the sauce in 1/2; too much of a good thing.  Warmed up for leftovers, it was even better than the first time around!  I really like this recipe.

This was AWESOME! I used bread crumbs instead because I did not have saltines, added sharp cheddar also.  LOVE this meatloaf!  Thank you for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  I used red peppers instead of green and did not add mushrooms... it was so good that my husband had thirds! The meatloaf was definitely more flavorful than I expected -- a good quick recipe.  I served it with the honey roasted red potatoes (recipe from this site) and both were a hit.

This recipe is very similar to what I make .. the only thing different is I use 1/2 cup of instant oatmeal instead of the crackers and only 1 teasponn of the brown surgar. 
Deliciuos recipe... I double it and freeze one loaf. Great for sandwiches

This was a hit with my boys.  Didn't have fresh mushrooms and used canned.  I don't like meatloaf at all and actually ate some.  It's a keeper.  next time I might cut the sauce in 1/2 so it's not so overpowering.

Excellent meat loaf recipe. I used two pounds of ground beef & formed it into a loaf. (one pound of meat pressed into a 9"X13" pan & you would have a pancake)The glaze is outstanding.

I am so glad to see a recipe for meat loaf that doesn't use oatmeal--this recipe is pretty much like the kind I make except she has taken it up a notch with the fresh vegetable ingredients which makes it very nice. From other meat loaf recipes I have seen on this site, I think this one is the best. No oatmeal!

It was ok. My fiance loved it but I ate one piece and stopped there. There was way too much sauce. I thought it was a little strange that it said to press into a 9x13 pan. Shouldnt it be a loaf?

I am very picky when it comes to meatloaf and I really loved this recipe. I added only half the onion soup mix and also used crumbled wheat bread in place of saltines and it turned out wonderfully. Oh, I also ended up skimming about a third of the sauce off the top half-way through cooking because it was just too much. I'd definitely cut back the sauce next time. My husband loved this recipe.

The amount of crackers called for give a mushy texture, the amount of ketchup called for was way over kill.  And to pat it down in a 9x13 pan?  Good grief.

This recipe is a great base for meatloaf and like others I have made some changes.  I cook the meatloaf in the pan for 20 minutes then take it out of the oven drain off any excess fat that has accumulated during cooking. Then invert the meatloaf onto a foil covered cookie sheet or tray that has sides and remove the meatloaf pan. 
This way you can apply the ketchup mixture to all sides.  Also, you have a more uniform meatloaf shape that has been able to cook in its own juices for part of the process... The "end" pieces are sought after if you are a ketchup fan!

Have not tried it yes, just found it today but I would not ever make meatloaf without an actual meatloaf pan (Holes in the bottom of the top pan) to catch all the grease drippings. I mix honey and catsup for a glaze, half before cooking it and half when it gets done.

What a pleasant surprise!  I'm one of those who like to know quantities so here's what I used. The beef, eggs and soup mix were as called for, but 3/4 cup peppers(a combination of sweet and hot), 4 green onions-2/3 cup, 1 cup cracker crumbs, I think this was too much, I'll try 3/4 cup next time.  I also used a loaf dish,and it held together well, but think I'll try a 7 x 11" baking dish next time, so there's more glaze per serving.  A great way to get those needed vegies in!

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't have any crackers, so I added Italian bread crumbs.  I added the veggies it called for and about 1/4 c of julienned carrots I had from another recipe.  I didn't have the beef soup packet, so I softened a beef bouillon cube in the microwave and mashed it together with about a 1/4 c of dried onion flakes, then added this to the meat mixture.  I started cooking the meatloaf at 400 degrees WITHOUT the sauce (I like the outside a bit crunchy!)  After 30 mins., I lowered the temp  to 375 and added the sauce which I had preheated in the microwave so as not to lower the temp of the meat.  My super picky 3 year old said it was, "kinda yummy."  This is a GOOD THING!

LOVE this meatloaf recipe. I didn't have green onions so I substituted for a white onion and it turned out so good that I've never changed it.

Yum! I left out the mushrooms (don't like them). Very good, just like Mom used to make.

Recipe was okay, be careful in what the type of meat you select, mines came out oily and fell apart the seasoning was well.

I use this recipe as a base. I omit the onion soup (too much sodium) and use a sleeve of Ritz wheat crackers crushed instead of the saltines. I cut down on the amount of catsup, and increase the brown sugar a bit. Instead of a loaf pan, I use an 8x10 and make it thinner for even cooking. Something about that topping - tastes a little like bbq. yum.

We will definitely make this again. However, as much as my kids and myself enjoy ketchup, it was just too much. The kids scraped it off before eating. We don't do mushrooms, I added a little more bell pepper and used butter crackers instead of saltines (didn't have any). If you have picky kids, I'd suggest dicing the veggies until they are almost pureed. They hide better that way! I will probably try to "hide" more veggies next time!

I've been around professional kitchens for a long time and I've seen a LOT of meatloaf recipes, from the inspired to the ridiculous, and to each of them I gave their proper respect, for after all, they also were someone's favorite, if not mine and someone had taken the time and effort to write it down and prepare.

This one I'm gonna write down and prepare, with some cremini or porcini instead of button.

Thank You for sharing.

WOW! Absolutely fantastic!! I did not have any green peppers (so I simply omitted them).  Used FreshFrozen Mushrooms and 1TBS re-hydrated minced onions. The Crackers I used were Keebler TownHouse (low salt) and 'regular' OnionSoup Mix. 

Like other Reviewers I created the Sauce to 'taste' .. about 3/4Cup Ketchup 2TBS BrownMustard & about 4TBS BrownSugar.  I did not want the sauce to be too 'Ketchup-y' 

I used an 8x4 Loaf Pan and Baked for 50 Minutes.  It came out PERFECT.  My husband loved it too.

-... I can now make a great Meatloaf thanks to YOUR Recipe ...-

My husband RAVES about this recipe! I cut the ketchup down to 1 cup and increased the brown sugar to 6 teaspoons. Also, I can't find onion soup mix w/ beef, so I use 1 pkg of onion soup mix and 1 beef bouilon cube. YUM! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was not good.  I don't know if it was the addition of the beef/onion soup mix or something else.   I also used the 9x13 pan when it would have been much better in a meatloaf pan.

I know it's not good when instead of the meatloaf being devoured it gets pushed around the plate and they are eating the mashed potatoes over the meatloaf.

This recipe is a hit! SO MUCH FLAVOR! The green peppers really give it a great taste. I blogged it on my food blog and my friends just LOVE it! I'm not one to change up a recipe unless after reading reviews that it wasn't working...On this recipe (NOT because it wasn't working) I did change the saltine crackers for Garlic & herb croutons. For one they don't get as soggy as saltines I like how they hold up in meatloaf and also I like adding that extra seasoning the croutons have. But this recipe could win awards...seriously, its that good!

Delicious!  Husband loved it!  I had to make a few substitutions only because of what I had on hand.  Used a regular onion, a green bell pepper, and some leftover defrosted frozen peas for veggies which gave it great texture.  I reduced to 3/4 C of seasoned bread crumbs and used a whole egg and two egg whites.  I poked holes to let the sauce sink in as another reviewer suggested, but there was way more than enough for this.  I'll make less topping next time around.

Good recipe..I wasn't so sure at first.  While mixing it just seemed like it may be dry, but it sure wasn't.  And boy did it smell good cooking too.  The ketchup sauce on top gave it a good flavor too.  I did add a few sprinkles of Worchesteshire sauce too.

Excellent!!  I have made this once for just my husband & I then again last night for a dinner party.  For the dinner party I increased the servings to 12 and used the same pan to make it a "thicker" meat loaf.  It worked out great!  My husband loves it and suggested to put some of the topping mixture in the middle as well...that will be next.  Thanks!!

Made recipe exactly as written.  Being a little naive, I pressed into 9x13 dish.  Why didn't you say the this was supposed to be in loaf pan?  Came out dry (of course).  Also, I don't think these vegetables are worth too much.  Sorry.

Very good,this is almost a meal in itself.I cut down on the ketchup like one poster suggested but it evaporated too much.The next time I'll use the full amount of ketchup.I too couldn't find beef flavored onion soup mix so I added a boullion cube.I found that the meatloaf didn't hold together as well as I'd hoped so I might add an extra egg and a bit more cracker crumbs.

This was a hit at my house! My Mother in Law said this meatloaf is divine. She didn't know the title. My husband said this was the best meatloaf I ever made. My 4 year old and my one year old ate all of it on their plates! I doubled the recipe and used one red bell pepper. Thanks for a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this meatloaf! Yummy! My husband kept going back for more. I did use egg substitute in place of the 2 eggs, for a healthier version and it came out great.  This meatloaf is definitely a new favorite at our house!!

2 WORDS FAB-BU.  I added celery and pregresso garlic and herbs bread crumbs, baked at 375 for 1 hour. I didn't use the sauce recipie, due to the fact that I had left over sauce from lasagna I made a few weeks ago.  WONDERFUL!!!

This was a really good recipe - the sauce was a nice combination of sweet/tangy, and my husband liked it.  It was easy and didn't take too long, which was a huge plus.

Baking it in a 9X13 pan really made it unsatisfyingly thin, so next time I will try a 9X9 or loaf pan.  Also, I think I will use fewer green onions or chop them super fine.

What a unique flavor compared to the traditional meatloafs that I have had - my husband & I really liked the veggies cooked in it!  Used green & red bell peppers and left out the green onions - personal preference.  Not sure if I used 4 ounces of fresh mushrooms, I'll add more next time because we love them.  Baked at 375 for 50 minutes in a 7x11 dish sprayed with Pam and per my husband: excellent!  I will halve the sauce for the top next time - I didn't like that much sauce and it was alot since I used a smaller dish than called for.

This was a great recipe!  The cooking time was right on.  I was out of beef/onion soup mix, so I added chili powder/onion powder/garlic powder and salt (just a pinch) and pepper instead.  It turned out great.  The glaze is really what makes the meatloaf though!

I used Vermont Maple Syrup in place of brown sugar.  Delicious!

Made this tonight.  Only changed one ingredient.  Red instead of green pepper.  Everyone loves it, including 3 very fussy 14 year old girls.  Keeper recipe.

After trying a few recipes in our search for the perfect meatloaf, we've settled on this one. As is, it's a good thickness for sandwiches. Doubled, it feeds more people.

I'm not a meatloaf fan, but I try to make it now and then because my husband likes it. This is the first recipe that I also enjoyed! Very good recipe the only thing I might change is a little less glaze on top, but that is just personal preference.

delicious and flavorful. the 9x13 pan makes it too thin, see the picture & notice the burnt sides. Use a regular 4x8 loaf pan. The topping needs the ketchup cut by half at least, it tends to overwhelm the meat's taste. Easy to throw together. Might try it with different topping altogether.

I'm writing this review because there is no longer a place for notes on the recipes, and I'd like to remember what I liked and didn't like about this one. I like to follow the recipe exactly the first time, but 2 eggs and an entire stack of saltines, crushed, just seemed way too much for 1 lb. of meat. So I used half the amount of crackers and only one egg, and it came out perfectly. The loaf itself is quite good, and I look forward to making it again. I agree with other reviewers that there is waaaay too much ketchup in the sauce.  I didn't have yellow mustard, so I used brown and had to up the amount a lot to get that tang--but maybe that wouldn't be the case if I used yellow mustard. Next time I will vastly reduce sauce or skip it altogether. My family isn't fond of sweet and savory, so maybe I'll look for another kind of sauce or glaze.

Divine Meatloaf Haiku: "Sorry, not divine. Too much ketchup, salty too. Nine by thirteen, huh???" To start, an entire sleeve of Saltine crackers is entirely too much, so that, coupled w/ the salt from the beef/onion soup mix put the salt and dryness factor thru the roof on this, but I suppose that was somewhat balanced out by the swimming-in-ketchup sauce on top. Then there is the peculiar directive to press it entirely into a 9X13 pan, which was the only thing that I couldn't bring myself to follow in the recipe, patting it into "loaf" shape. Tried to salvage leftovers onto a sandwich by scraping off the ketchup. So sorry to say that this recipe won't be a repeat on our house

I really used this as a guide so I tweaked it a lot. Instead of the crackers, I used Italian Bread crumbs (1/4 c). Instead of the beef onion soup mix, I used Lipton Vegetable soup mix (which made it more awesome since my son doesn't regularly eat veggies!) Instead of the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mix, I used 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce (since I had a lot of it on hand). Will definitely make again!!!!

Great meatloaf.  Whole family loved it!!!  Used 1lb beef and 1lb half pork....added worchestershire, parsley and panko crumbs and spices.  Mushrooms and chopped peppers secret in this recipe.  Serve with mashed spuds and cream corn...  Separate into two containers...cook at 375 degrees.  Freeze or give one to in-laws or folks.....they will love you forever!

In general, it is a very good recipe.  I used 1.3 lbs of beef and half of the recommended condiments and it turned out great.

Delicious just as is.  I did make less sauce because I didn't have enough of the ingredients to make the full amount.  But just enough to cover the top was fine.  Also, I used the pan size indicated but left about an inch around all sides of the "loaf" so that it wasn't too flat but more of a loaf shape.  Worked well.  Husband loved it....but he loves everything!

This was a great meatloaf.  I used buffalo instead of the usual ground beef.  Every single member of the family loved it, which is rare in this house of 5!  Yum!

Absolute all-time best meatloaf I have made from this site.  I did exclude the mushrooms because my family doesn't care for them but, otherwise, easy to make minus the chopping and a real treat to eat!  I think this will be my meatloaf of choice in the future.

I followed the complete recipe, and thought it was very dry.  My husband and I didn't like the taste at all..  I would say this was the worst meatloaf recipe I have ever tried!  Don't know how anyone is raving about, and why they are calling it Divine sounds fraudulent to me!

Best Meat Loaf Ever.  I doubled it and used a Red and Green Bell Pepper, and by mistake I put one package of Onion Soup Mix in the topping which tasted great too.  This will be a regular meal for us. Next time I am going to use Pork and Lamb with the Beef.
