I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter, and I would not change a thing, I did use Cooper Sharp cheese and the flavor was awesome!  I think a good sharp cheddar cheese makes this recipe!

Yeah. Just ok for me as far as the original recipe goes. I definitely listened to the suggestions on here! I doubled the spices and then it was still lacking for me. So, I added about 1 1/2 c of sour cream and drizzled lemon juice and added pepper. MUCH better!! I would try this again but also add a little more cheese. I still got the buttery taste and texture from the avocado that I love. So, not great but definitely a good starting off point to rework.

This is a good recipe to really mess around with - I liked my finished product but I definitely didn't follow the recipe after reading the reviews.  I added in some sour cream and feta cheese to make it a little creamier (and of course less healthy -ha) and I left out the nutmeg because I forgot.  I added in some vegetable broth for extra flavor, also.  
I just dumped everything in a dish and stirred in the avocados because I couldn't find the top to my blender.  I really liked this, as I said, but I did make quite a few changes.  I liked the consistency, however, and it was a fairly quick weeknight meal.  I'm going to continue to experiment with this because I feel like it has potential!

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did the kids. Hubby was not impressed with the hint of lime (which was part of why I loved it). I had to add some feta as I didn't quite have enough cheddar, and it needed salt, so I added 1/2 teaspoon.  I also added shrimp, per the footnoted variations, but saluted them in garlic and oil.  I also cooked some diced zucchini at the some time and then pur√©ed it with the avocado and cheese so that it would be a meal complete with veggies.  I used an immersion blender.  I usually don't write reviews when I make this many changes, but in this case I don't think it affected the flavor much.

The avocado turned brown almost immediately and definitely lacked flavor.

At first when I made this, it was not as I expected. By the time all of the sauce was blended, the noodles and sauce were cold. I mixed it all together and heated it in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes to heat it up. Slightly overpowering avocado, recommend to add more cheese and not double the spices as other  reviews have recommended.

I recently tried this recipe & unfortunately I was not a fan. Overall, it was very bland and not so tasty, not to mention if you have leftovers and know what happens to avocados after cut open and not eaten right away.
This recipe below was healthy & yummy: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cheesy-butternut-squash-pasta-sauce/detail.aspx

I loved it. I did the recipe pretty much as written except I used dried parsley only cause I didn't have fresh, and omitted the chives because I don't have any. I added some leftover venison meat which added some needed saltiness. Overall I liked it.

I made it as is, re-made it as suggested by other reviewers. Imagine bland guacamole mixed with bland Mac'n'cheese. Not worth it unless you change the type of cheese.

Like everyone else I doubled the spices and added a few red pepper flakes but also added a teaspoon of chicken soup base to the pot for hopefully another layer of flavor. (it was very bland up to this point.)  The cup of flat parsley does give it that Avocado color green which is why I believe it's there, but on the other hand a cup of blended flat parsley leaves turns the whole concoction into more of a pesto-ish pasta dish instead of a cheesy comfort food which is what I was hoping for. I don't think I will make this again but use it as inspiration for a whole new recipe because I love the idea of Avocado Mac and Cheese. Just didn't think this one was what I had in mind.

Very bland even after doubling the nutmeg and chili powder. It looks good but my goodness does this dish need help....it tasted better as a leftover dish served cold.

Made this last night with a few simple changes: doubled the spices (as others have mentioned, it can use a little more kick), also added a tiny bit of siracha sauce for flavor, set the table with extra limes to squeeze and used onion powder rather than garlic since I was out. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious! I loved how creamy the sauce was without giving everyone a stomach ache from cream additions! Next time I may try adding some tofu to the blend for some extra protein. Awesome recipe!!!

Loved this. Thought is was very good. I did double the cayenne pepper and nutmeg. Very creamy. We really like limes so I had some lime wedges set out to squeeze on for an extra zing and we also had more than just 1/2 cup diced avocado to toss. Just preferences. We are huge avocado lovers here. Good way to sneak in something delicious and nutritious for your kids.

Tastes pretty good, but need to double nutmeg & chili powder or it's too bland.

I thought this was ok. You can taste the avocado and it was creamy but I think I will stick with good ol mac n cheese.

Great idea, but we had to deviled it up a bit. Instead of skim milk, I used heavy whipping cream. Then added butter, salt and pepper to taste. Very creamy and tasty.

This is a nice twist to traditional mac and cheese. I find that fresh parsley can overwhelm a dish and I am so glad I only used about a 1/2 cup or it would have been ruined. It did need some spicing up a bit so I doubled the garlic, nutmeg and chili powder with an addition of salt and pepper and even my children were impressed. I would certainly make this again, but only with the changes I made.
