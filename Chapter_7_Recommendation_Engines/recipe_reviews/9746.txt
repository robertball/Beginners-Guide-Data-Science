I think this recipe is supposed to make meringues but the instructions are written poorly so that they turn out flat. I beat the egg whites till they were stiff and added the sugar/cinnamon/cocoa mixture to the whites at about 1T at a time (I left out the almonds). Doing this will keep the whites fluffy, but as written in the instructions, if you add them all at once you'll deflate your eggs. I made 24 of these and put them on parchment paper, and they turned out wonderful. They're melt in your mouth crispy on the outside and just a bit chewy on the inside. Bake for 35  minutes and they're perfect.

I was looking for a fun way to use up two egg whites, which is why I chose this recipe. After reading the reviews, I was a bit hesitant on how to proceed, but it simply came down to a matter of sticking as closely as possible with the recipe as written, to get a good handle on what, if any, problems there may be with it, and out of fairness to the submitter and the recipe. Having said all that, I left out the nuts and I used parchment paper to line my cookie sheet instead of greasing it. I agree that this recipe could have been written with more specific detail. That is so important in a recipe so as not to leave the cook second guessing. I whipped the egg whites as directed, until stiff, but not glossy. I added the rest of the ingredients and stirred as directed. The egg whites did deflate substantially (recipe yielded 20 cookies for me). I dropped the batter by teaspoonful (again, being specific is important as 'spoonful' is pretty vague). The batter did not spread out and flatten as it did for another reviewer. I baked at the time/temp indicated on a standard metal baking sheet, and the cookies were crisp on the outside, and chewy on the bottom. The insides were largely hollow, and they are reminiscent of a meringue.  They do taste strongly of cinnamon, which I loved. I have to add that these 'cookies' are addictive!

This recipe did run on the cookie sheet, so the cookies werent perfectly formed but that didnt affect the taste! easy to make and lovely taste these were a great success! I have to say though, the yield is more than 30! i made at least 50 of these cookies from the original recipe! :0)

These cookies are so yummy- all of the cinnamon gives them a nice spicy kick. They're thin and crunchy, and almost remind me of gingersnaps. They're a breeze to mix but from there it gets difficult: they run on the cookie sheet, making it easy to end up with lopsided cookies. Be sure to grease the cookie sheet very well because they're tough to get off. Worth all the work, though!

My batch turned out okay, they seemed a bit moist in the middle...which concerned me, but they were cooked, I think I made them a bit too big. The taste is great! It was worth it.  Some tips - if your cookies ran during cooking time then you didn't wip your egg whites enough. Also I used a stone ware pan and they didn't stick at all...metal pans really aren't good for this type of recipe.

â€¢These were yummy! I followed the review about adding ingredients one tsp at a time, and they turned out great! Although I think I'll use a little less cinnamon next time. ??

They tasted good but came out unappealing to look at.

I strongly recommend greasing your baking sheet. Thoroughly.
