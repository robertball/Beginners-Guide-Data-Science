Okay, the reason this recipe is so bland is because it calls for too much olive oil.  I made it with only one cup of olive oil and it was much better.  Try that and see what you think!

Loved this dipping oil with crusty hot bread.  I did, however, cut the oil in half and added freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The fresh basil is a must and added great flavor.

Buy really good olive oil. Ordinary olive oil will not cut it for dipping.

Delicious! Use a good quality olive oil. Also, added some fresh grated parmesan reggiano on top.

I love things very flavorful & spicy so I only used about 1/4c olive oil. Tasty! I have decided that I am not a huge fan of red pepper flakes so next time I will make this with loads of fresh garlic instead.

I make this all the time.  Followed the advice of another reviwer Bonnie.  Delicious with fresh hot french bread from the oven.  Company loves this and it is great.  Thanks for the post.

Makes a lovely flavored olive oil for cooking with but I would not try this recipe again for a bread dip. It was so thick and oily and lacked flavor, I didn't even serve it to my guests. But as I said before, a nice recipe for a flavored oil.

I used 1c. EVOO and added some parmasan cheese before serving.  This was still not very flavorful.

I added about 1 tsp salt and used dried basil because I felt that the fresh basil would not stand up to storage. Works for me.
