I have tried several of these "chinese slaw" recipes.  This is the best.  the addition of the sesame oil makes a world of difference.  It has been a requested recipe, even by people who already make a version of this.  I keep the 3 components in separate containers in the frig and mix it up as I feel the urge.  It stays crunchy and is a great quick lunch or dinner side dish.  A BIG hit at gatherings, too.

Really, this recipe is almost like "asian salad" also found on this site (just a little less sugar and less ramen noodles).  Still, VERY GOOD!  I like to use a package and a half of the pre-shredded coleslaw mix, it gives you the same results but less time is spent on chopping.  In addition, to make this one "different " from the other recipe, I used cashews in place of blanched almonds...I just tossed them in when I mixed in the sauce.  I'm keeping this one just in case I ever lose my copy of the receipe for Asian Salad.

This salad is phenomenal!  My mom made it for me the first time.  I don't like cabbage, so thought I wouldn't like this.  Boy, was I wrong!  I could have eaten the whole bowl!  I made my mom fix it for me several times while home visiting - and it was also the big hit with any guests who lucked out and were present for dinner with this fabulous salad on the side.  It does take a bit of work - but it's worth it!  Plan to eat the whole salad in one sitting, as it's not so great the next day when the crunchies have gone stale.  If it's too much for one sitting, make the salad and split it into two before adding the top ramen and almonds.  Put the extra toppings in an airtight container for the next day.  Do the same with half the dressing.  Trust me - this is as good as the chinese salads you get in a restaurant!  Kudos to the chef who shared this with the rest of us!!!

so i made this again tonight b4 realizing i didn't the ramen.  here is my solution: use 1 cube of chicken boullion and dilute in a tablespoon of very hot water.  add this to the dressing ingredients (which i always, always double except the oils.  i only use 2 tablespoons vegg oil and 1/3 cup sesame oil to cut the fat/calorie content.  yes, the dressing is a wee bit loose but i will sacrifice the oilyness of almost a cup of oil, yuck!).  still toast your almond/sesame seed mixture but you don't even need the butter if you use non-stick pan. my family didn't even notice the difference.  and once again we ate the entire bowl.  so good with salmon and brown rice.   
-------------
my family loves this!  its very yummy & very similar to another recipe on this site but has less calories (napa cabbage noodle salad).  only made two small changes: less noodles cuz there would have been waaaay too many. used about half a bag. second, i added more green onion than called for as i wanted more of the wonderful subtle green onions flavor. another thing i did was make more of the dressing as i am going to try it as a marinade for sea bass or such.

Great salad. Have made tons of times. I make dressing and the nut topping, then chop and bag the veggies (Napa and green onions)and put all in fridge. When I am ready just toss all together. Can do up to 2 days ahead. Sometimes I make half recipe and do the rest the next day or the day after. Very user friendly recipe and always gets rave reviews.

I really LOVED this salad, but unfortunately I could never eat it again.  If you get headaches from MSG, beware!! Those ramen seasonings straight are bad undiluted!!  I used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of shredding a head of cabbage, and I added a few extra drops of soy sauce to the dressing b/c all I could taste was the rice vinegar.  I also stored everything seperately like suggested, and it did keep for a few days.

Very good! Next time I'll add some carrots, broccoli, and chicken.  Take the advice of another reply and store the dressing seperate from the cabbage because it is soggy the next day.

Actually, this is a recipe I've had in my arsenal for several years now. I was fresh out of college and went to a fellow alumus' grad party and his mom served this refreshing salad.  I demanded the recipe before I left and good thing, too, I haven't seen the alum since the party-- thanks, Mrs. Levine! After browsing the allrecipe.com site and finding it here, I just needed to chime in with praise.  MAKE IT -- it's a crowd pleaser EVERY time!!

This salad is delicious.  Shred the napa and scallions very finely (and the carrot too if you want to add it as I do) and toss in a small amount of chopped cilantro (fresh coriander leaves) or watercress.  

You can prep it ahead of time, too: (1) brown the noodles/seeds/nuts/seasoning then hold at room temp under a paper towel (2) mix the dressing and keep seperate (3) and shred the veggies and keep in fridge.  When ready to serve, simply toss all three components together - fabulous!

My mom makes this with cashews, not almonds & it is THE BEST SUMMER RECIPE EVER!!  It's wild how the different ingredients combine to make such a unique & flavorful dish, like other reviews, you can't tell it's raw cabbage, it's just crunchy. Reminds me of the Lettuce Wrap appetizers you get at PF Chang's.

Overall, this is very good. I browned some chicken breast and added it to the noodles, sesame seeds, and almonds in the skillet. There didn't see to be enough dressing for the amount of cabbage I had. (And it was only about 3/4 of the large head...) I added a tablespoon of sesame oil to the dressing. I did not add the dressing to the whole bowl of cabbage and tossed only the amount needed for the meal. I am storing the rest of the chicken/noodles/nuts and the cabbage and the dressing all separately for left overs tomorrow.
I love this type of salsd and will continue to try other recipes in order to find the one that best suits our tastes.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You must serve this salad the same day that you make it. I made it a day ahead and the dressing wilts the cabbage down to mush!

My friends BEG me to make this salad. The adjustments I made are to use 1/4 cup sesame seeds instead of 1/2 cup, and a bag of shredded cabbage. Keep all ingredients separate until ready to eat otherwise the cabbage and crunchy mix get soggy. This salad doesn't last leftover.

Fantastic!  I use prepackaged - coleslaw - it saved time and was even better. It is a huge hit.  Often I add chicken strips and mandarin oranges to make a meal out of it.

Mmm. So good, but very salty. It may help if you can find low-sodium Ramen, because that's where all the salt comes from. Definitely do NOT put dressing on salad if you are going to save the leftovers. The dressing has an almost peanutty taste, by the way. I eat this as a meal.

I have made similar recipes before, so I just glanced at the recipe before making this.  It wasn't until I went to prepare it that I noticed that you are to use the seasoning packet from the ramen. I eliminated that step and made it otherwise to directions and it was delicious.  So don't be afraid to leave that icky flavor packet out, just crumble up the ramen raw and put it in the salad.

I couldn't put my fork down! I only used 1 tablespoon of butter...the ramen still browns just fine with a little cooking spray. I was able to cut the fat and calories almost in half just by using less butter! I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used cider vinegar and it still tasted great.

So good!! A very light and delicious salad. I made it for a Chinese themed supper club and it was excellent. I also made it a 2nd time with a mushroom flavored ramen and it was equally good! Thanks!!

I have made this several time for potlucks and it is always a hit.  To add color, I use some shredded red cabbage, bok choy and a bit of grated carrot, which make a lovely presentation.  For my own family, I have thrown in chicken for a great meal.  This recipe is a keeper!

The dressing for this salad is first rate -- light and flavorful!  My husband doesn't like cabbage, so I used mixed salad greens, added sliced, cooked chicken, 1/2 cup of shredded carrots per salad and some mandarin oranges, and left out the onions and the sesame seeds.  I've substituted both chow mein noodles and fried rice noodles for the ramen noodles with good results.  So you can substantially alter the salad itself but still get good results with this wonderful dressing.

This was wonderful! I even liked the dressing and I usually prefer to make my own. Throw in some sliced chicken breasts and as another rater suggested, you have a main dish for those hot summer days. No almonds? Use dry roasted peanuts. You could even add some shreaded carrots for color. This is a very versatile, easy,fast & delicious recipe. Thanks!

This was excellent!  To make it as an entire meal, I sauteed boneless, skinless chicken breast in a little all purpose seasoning and oil and diced up the chicken adding it to the salad.  My husband loved this!

This is so delicious! I’ve made it several times now. I haven’t made it with sesame seed yet (I’m too cheap to spend $5+ on sesame seeds), but it’s great anyways. I used 1 tablespoon of butter (don’t like it too buttery) and use only 3/4 of the seasoning packet (don’t like it too salty). I suggest buying the better ramen brand as you can tell the difference. It's always a hit at parties and I could finish the entire bowl myself!

Good, but not the best. Since all the indredients are of the same color a little red cabbage helps a ton. Also substitued cider vinegar for rice.

This is excellent. It's the only cabbage-ramen salad recipe I use. I add chunks of grilled or poached chicken breast.

Yum.  Makes a good "lite" dinner.  My husband dislikes cabbage, but loved this dish.  He was surprised when I told his it was cabbage - he thought it was lettuce.

This was wonderful!! Never have I enjoyed a salad as much as this, my Mum and I nibbled at the leftovers till the bowl was empty.  Even my stepDad liked it and he doesn't like "new" foods!!
My daughter, who doesn't like cabbage liked it too. Thanks for this recipe.

My whole family loved this.  I served with lettace wraps for a healthy dinner.  I too used packaged slaw mis to make it easier and the carrots in it add a little something.  Of couse my daughter loved this (she is my picky eater) as she has been begging me to make this salad for months.

There are a billion versions of this salad on this site, and this is a very good version. Be certain that you don't add the crunchy bits until you're ready to eat the WHOLE BATCH because otherwise the noodles get soft which is sort of -- disconcerting. Serve the crunchy bits in a bowl on the side as a salad topper if you think there's a chance you might not finish it all in one sitting. I served this with AR's "Thai Chicken Balls" and we liked this combo a lot. Thanks for the recipe!

My entire family loves this recipe. It's super easy to make and travels really well, so we've taken to holiday parties, business events, and just served it for dinner with family and friends. It is always very well received, and even my crotchety grandpa who doesn't trust that foreign food enjoys it. If you can't find white sesame seeds, black works just as well, though I tend to cut the amount they ask for so it's not overpowering. This salad has a delicious and surprising flavor to add to any meal.

A friend I worked with brought this years ago, LOVED it. But she called it Stinky Salad. She moved and I never got the recipe. This is it!!! Love the flavor, the crunch & the texture. Brings back fond memories of myself and co-workers bringing dishes to work and enjoying each others food. It was a great way to bond with each other.

not bad....even the kids ate it!!  I used regular cabbage, but I think I used too much of it.  Next time will make it with only 1/3-1/2 of the cabbage (I used over 1/2 of a small head and it was too much).  Also, I only added 1/2 of the flavoring packet, but next time I think I'll use the whole thing as it wasn't too salty to me.

This is a wonderful departure from boring tossed salads, and is a great hit with guests and family alike.  Add a can of well-drained mandarin oranges for more depth.  Even the kids like the sweetened flavor.  I recommend combining the salad/dressing/noodles at the last minute to preserve that crunch!  Ramen noodle mixture will keep for weeks, and is good as a topping to any salad.

This is pretty good. I don't think the ramen noodle mixture needs the seasoning packet added though, it takes away from the dressing and is way salty. I used regular cabbage and it turned out well too.

I liked this slightly better than another similar recipe I made. Very simple and quick to prepare when using bagged coleslaw mix. Husband loved the crunchiness of the salad.

Great recipe, my sister-in-law first gave it to me.  If you want a salad that will hold up, substitute one large bag (at least 16 oz) cole slaw mix for the napa cabbage.  The salad will last until it's all eaten-up!
You can also add a large can (or two small) of well-drained mandarin oranges, tossed in at the end.  Delicious.

This salad is very easy to make, especially if you have a food processer that will shred the cabbage.  It only took a few minutes and it was absolutely yummy! I recommend not adding the ramen mixture until the very last minute or the ramen noodles will soften.

This recipe is very good as is, but there are a few changes I would make to consider it a 5-star recipe. First of all for the dressing I would only use half the vegetable oil called for, I would also double the sugar, double the sesame oil and add a pinch more soy sauce. Next time I will add a lot more ramen noodles and sesame seeds as well- about 1/3 more of each. Not quite enough crunch as is. But overall a very good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Ooh, great!  I just had it for the first time at a party so was really happy to come across this recipe.  My family loved it too and I'll be serving it often.  I agree with others that it doesn't hold up well after its been tossed, so make only as much as you think you'll eat.  (Which was easy in my case because they ate the whole thing!)

The dressing is fantastic. The salad tasted just like my favorite chinese chicken salad from a restaurant, minus the chicken. I didn't have any ramen noodles, so I omitted them, but added shredded carrot & sliced red bell pepper (great additions IMHO). The salad was just begging for shredded chicken and next time I'll definitely add it and maybe some cilantro. Will make this again and again and again.

Nice salad full of Asian flavors.  I enjoyed this as a light dinner tonight.  I left the dressing on the side, so that I can save the left overs for tomorrow without it getting soggy.  I will keep this in mind for my next pot luck or get together, as I'm sure it would go over well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this!  I will make again.  I subbed a small amount of  flax seed oil in the dressing forthe veg and sesame oil.  I also used half as much green onion and I'm glad I did.  I also used half oil/half butter to toast the raamen noodles.  Slightly healthier and keeps the butter from burning.

This is by far my favorite ramen coleslaw recipe. The soy and sesame oil really add something... That said I have NEVER added 1/2c sesame seeds. I have always been out when making this recipe, but I still couldn't imagine using more than 1T of sesame seeds. The napa cabbage is great in this too.

I just finished making this and it was just as amazing as the Oriental Salad I order at Kona Grill.  I used cole slaw bc my store didn't have napa cabbage, half the butter when cooking the ramen noodles and only half the flavor packet to try to cut down on the sodium.  Only used 1 tbsp sugar instead of two and I think it tasted perfect.  Will definitely be making this again.

LOVE this recipe! Its such a nice change from typical salads. I added shredded carrots and extra scallions... YUMMY! I make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge to stay cool, then pour on the dressing right before you're ready to eat so the cabbage keeps its crunch! This one's a keeper for sure!

I love this recipe! It was very light and refreshing.  The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because I did make some changes that I thought improved it.  I added carrots, broccoli, pea pods, and used a lot less seaseme seeds.  The colours looked amazing!

Also I did not fry the noodles.  I thought it added way too much fat.  Instead I added the seasoning packet to the dressing mix.  I crunched up the noodles and added them after adding the dressing, right before serving. 

It tasted awesome, and got great reviews. I am making it again for my tiki garden party that I am holding next week!

The salad tasted good enough but was not visually appealing.  The various crunches make it good enough that I may try it again.  Maybe adding some carrot or purple cabbage would give it more color.

This is great.  I used pre packaged shredded cabbage and canned rice noodles instead of ramen.  Served for the Chinese New Year -- big hit!

As a new member, this was a great start!  Loved the flavors of this salad, as did everyone else.  Clean plates all around!  Since we used this as a main dish, the  6 servings proportions, were perfect for 4, and I added chicken.
Great salad, will absolutely make it again!

The flavor of this salad is just wonderful.  I adjusted the recipe as following, though: toasted the seeds and almond slivers in a toaster oven without any butter; replaced the veg oil with light coconut oil; omitted the ramen noodles and flavoring altogether; added a splash of hot pepper-flavored oil; omitted sugar altogether.  It was great!

I absolutely love this recipe!! It is so easy and so good. Although usually I don't use Napa Valley Cabbage, but rather shred some romaine lettuce and mix in shredded cabbage or coleslaw mix. I also buy a store bought Oriental Sesame dressing (Marzetti brand)-it is the best! I have this pretty often and also add some cubed, cooked chicken. The flavor of the noodle/sesame seed mixture is what really makes this salad taste so good.

THIS SALAD WAS SO YUMMY. WE SERVERD IT WITH SWEET AND SOUR MEATBALLS ON THIS SITE. A COUPLE HOURS LATER I ATE THE REST OF IT. YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS SALAD. ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT YOU REALLY CRUMBLE THE NOODLES GOOD OR YOU WILL HAVE TO BIG OF CHUNKS. AND I HALVED THE ALMONDS WITH SUNFLOWER SEEDS SINCE I HAD NO SESAME SEEDS.

This is one of the better recipes for this delicious salad.  I added a bit more vinegar as I found the dressing a bit too sweet.  I also combined cashews and almonds which added to the crunchy texture.  I made it for a potluck and brought home an empty bowl.  Thanks Kay!

This was pretty good, but I have had similar salads that I liked better.  I definitely liked the tip of keeping the dressing separate so that leftovers aren't soggy.

I loved this salad but don't like the fact you can't keep the leftovers.  The noodles get pretty gross after only a short time.  For a crowd, it's a winner though!!

The sauce was good - the ramien noodles kinda freaked me out because they're very salty and high in cholestrol. Not something I'd make again.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I loved it so much I now automatically make it with two bags of chopped cabbage from the store because we love this recipe.  It's good with chicken breasts and egg rolls if you have a large crowd to feed.

A fellow co-worker brought this in for an Easter potluck and got rave reviews.  I, of course, misplaced the recipe and had to browse this site, and OF COURSE, found it here!  It was pretty darn close and pretty darn tasty too!  I used half a head of cabbage *which I tend not to like* and only one pkg of ramen noodles.  Who would have thought uncooked ramen noodles would be any good?  I had beef flavoured Mr. Noodle, so I only sprinkled a bit on it, so it wasn't too salty or MSG'y like another viewer had mentioned.  I will definately use this for further parties and dinners at home.  EASY AND DELICIOUS!  A little soggy on day two, but still.. VERYYYY Good!
Thanks

Alright . . I've seen a few different versions of this salad and this by far is THE BEST!!  Thank you Kay.  Less sugar and sesame oil is the key.  Most recipes have double the sugar and it's too much.  The sesame oil adds such a complimenting taste.  By the way, two things.  You don't have to have the sesame seeds - they are a little pricey and you can use any kind of ramen noodles you'd like.  I use the oriental flavored.  TWO THUMBS UP!

I left out the sugar and instead added in 2 tablespoons of sesame ginger salad dressing, juice from one Navel Orange and added 2 more oranges cut into chunks. It creates the same balance of flavor that the sugar provides with the freshness of the oranges. Mandarin oranges would be even better!

Always a hit at summer barbecues--I have probably made this thing 50 times now!  I am always one to tinker with recipes so here are a couple of suggestions but by all means the base recipe is great.  For the salad part I like to add a few other ingredients for color and contrast so I shred up a couple carrots and thinly slice a red pepper to add to the cabbage.  Personally I like cilantro so I usually chop some of that up and add in in as well--it gives it a fresh taste but some folks don't like it so it just depends.  The dressing is phenomenal with that sweet, salty and acidic contrast.  I jazz it up a bit with a tablespoon or two of the chili-garlic paste and minced fresh ginger.  I also usually double the sesame oil because I like that taste.  Just a few suggestions--but again great as is.

This is such a delicious way to eat a bunch of cabbage!! Like other reviewers point out, do NOT mix the cabbage with the dressing and "crunchies" until you're ready to eat it, it will get soggy. I like to use 3-tbsp of peanut oil and 3-tbsp of sesame oil instead of the vegetable/sesame oil called for. You can also decrease the sugar a little bit without compromising the taste. Yum!

I really like this recipe!
First time ever trying the Asian cabbage salad thing, and I ended up making it three nights in a row because it was delicious. This recipe is also very  fool proof in that you can add/subtract many different ingredients and it still tastes great. It also goes great with many different dishes. I was making ginger pork and was worried the taste would be too contrasting, but it was perfect!

I used plain green cabbage because it was on sale, skipped the almonds because I didn't have any on hand, and substituted half a white onion for the green onion. I also reduced the vinegar and sugar in the dressing by about half.

Also: DON'T add the ramen seasoning. The seasoning really masks the freshness of the veggies in our opinion. For those of you that are MSG sensitive, this is a great way to enjoy this recipe.

Ok... WOW!  This is delicious!! The picky eater and I are having this, this evening and its ah-mazing!
Used 1/2 head Regular cabbage, cider vinegar, two whole green onions. Thats what I had.
Added 1/2 sliced red pepper and some carrot for color.
Sauteed some chicken tenders in the pan after I toasted the noodles and added 1/4 cup of the dressing in w it while they  sauteed. 
This is quick and easy.. The only problem, next time I'll need to triple this recipe for my family of 7!

Very tasty - great blend of flavors. I made a vegan version using Earth Balance instead of dairy butter and meat-free ramen noodles . I also used agave instead of sugar.

As written this salad just isn't that great.  It needs more to it. The dressing is good though

Thank you for your version of this popular recipe.  It is simpler and much better!  The other recipes use too much sugar and oil.  It's just not necessary, especially for those trying to eat healthy.  The rice vinegar and sesame oil are also add wonderful flavor, much better than vegetable oil and white vinegar.  You also skip the part about baking the noodles, nuts and seeds in the oven.  I'm all for making good recipes less complicated.  You have accomplished that!

I made this tonight with two teeny changes - I toasted cashews along with the almonds, because the package I bought had both, and I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of cabbage to use up - and it turned out fantastic! A beautiful and delicious salad, very much enjoyed by my roomates and very picky boyfriend. Highly recommended!

One of the best Chinese salad I've tasted!  I added cooked chicken pieces to make it a complete meal.The toasted, buttery ramen made all the difference.

Exactly what is says: excellent way to use up cabbage. My family likes the flavor balance, though I use evaporated cane juice instead of sugar.

Delicious!  I changed two things -- I cut back on the oil to 1/4 cup, and I added a splash of sriracha sauce to the dressing.   Thanks!

I have to be honest, this sounded like every bad food nightmare I've ever had. Ramen noodles crushed up in cabbage? But it was SO good - I couldn't stop eating it. Key to the recipe's success (I thought) was toasting a generous 1/2 cup of sesame seeds and another of almonds with the crushed noodles. I'm going to go eat some more. NOW.

This was very good! I also keep all three separate so it doesn't get wilty. I had to make 3x as much dressing but maybe my head of cabbage was too big? Thanks for sharing!

Boy, I guess we're one of the few who didn't care for this. Made as directed - only change was to cut to 2 servings...maybe it through the dressing off.  So sorry.

I had a huge head of napa cabbage and wanted to try something different-- this was delicious!  I note that some have recommended using about half the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles.  I used all of the packet from an organic "Asian vegetable" ramen which seems to have considerably less sodium than the regular store brands, and the salt level seemed just right.  To turn it into a vegetarian main course salad I also sauteed a box of Quorn "naked" cutlets in the same skillet in which I'd cooked the noodles, almonds and sesame seeds and then diced them before adding it all to the salad.  I also LOVE sesame seeds and toasted sesame oil, and thought the large quantity of sesame seeds gave it a great taste and texture.  I'm embarrassed to admit that my husband and I pretty much devoured the whole thing.  We'd washed and chopped the napa cabbage when we brought it home a couple of days before using it, making this salad incredibly quick and easy to put together.  I'll definitely be making it again!

I'm thinking it might only needed a half package of the ramen noodle soup to season the noodle.  Also make sure to add sesame at the end of browning.  It burnt very easily.  But overall, the salad was delicious.  I'll make it again.

Awesome and refreshing salad. I love the flavor of toasted sesame seeds and almonds. I didn't find it necessary to use "toasted" sesame seeds since I threw them in with the almonds to toast after the noodles started to brown. The only thing I'll make sure of the next time is to use the largest Napa cabbage I can find. I used a medium sized one, even though the recipe says large, and I found all the other ingredients to be overabundant. I'll definitely make this again.

I took this recipe to a picnic yesterday and it got lots of compliments.  I used red cabbage for color and it was beautiful.  I also didn't use the chicken ramen noodles because I'm vegetarian.  Instead I tossed in chow mein noodles at the end which worked out great.  I will definitely make it again and again!

With this recipe, I only needed half a cabbage. I threw in a large handful of matchstick carrots. When I made the dressing, I added garlic powder. Everything else I kept the same.

I kept everything seperate and didn't cook the almonds/ramen/sesame seeds or add the dressing until right before dinner, just to keep it from getting soggy.

Really, really good. And really not all that difficult to throw together. I'd make this again.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I usually make a lot of changes to a dish, but this was perfect as is.  The only thing  I did differently was that I used half the packet of seasoning, since I tend to find pre-packaged Ramen too salty for me.  This was so easy to throw together for dinner.  I plan on making this often.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This was mediocre. The sesame oil flavor seemed to dominate the whole dish, which was not very appetizing. I used a bag of cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage as another reviewer suggested and added sunflower seeds instead of the almonds. I would cut way back on the sesame oil (maybe only add a tsp. or so) and add chopped pears to this if I made it again. I think the fruit would compliment the strong flavor of the dressing.

Nice. I halved the recipe, skipped the seasoning packet, and added a little fresh grated ginger to the dressing to add more asian flavor.  I took some for lunch the next day and added in a few pieces of roasted chicken. The noodles still had a little crunch left in them and had that bottom of the bowl goodness!  I will definitely make this again.  Update: Try serving the toasted ramen and nut mixture on the side and store the leftovers is a small covered container. This way, if there are left overs, the ramen mixture will still be crispy and ready to use the next day.  Just make sure the ramen mix is completely cool before storing in the covered container. The only downside to this is, the ramen mix tastes pretty good by itself and makes for good snacking so it might get eaten if left unattended!

A versatile and simple recipe. Like others stated browing the toppings in 2 Tbsp butter is sufficent.  Since I do not care for the additives in the ramen season packet I simply added S&P to taste. The nuts once roasted are flavorful in their true state. I use seasoned rice wine vinegar for the dressing which for my preference enhances the flavor more. I also find keeping the dressing completly seperate from the salad is best. This allows others a choice on the quantiey of dressing they prefer, as well as no soggy leftovers.  I would recommend everyone to try this.

Very good! Very tasty! Quite different! 
I use red wine vinegar and usually make a little extra dressing. I find it has more flavor with more dressing. 
I use 2 packages of ramen noodles with both seasoning packets. We like lots of crunch. 
I usually mix dressing with cabbage and scallions and refrigerate for a few hrs. It doesnt get soggy but allows time for the flavors to absorb. 
I also dont use butter but a little olive oil instead. I keep the toasted mixture in a bowl and we add as we eat. Usually keeps fine for a few days as long as you dont put toasted mixture in salad. 
Have made it a main dish by adding browned cubed chicken. Very good that way too.

This is a great recipe.  I used 2 packages of ramen noodles with both seasoning packets. I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and it was plenty.  I added about 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro and it was a great addition. I love the dressing.  Thanks for a keeper!

HELP! I can't stop eating this salad... I'm completely addicted! Cabbage and ramen noodles have now become permanent items on my grocery list.  For extra flavor (and crunch), I've started using 2 packages of the ramen noodles (including both of their seasoning packets). For convenience, I've substituted 1 package of shredded cole slaw mix in place of the head of cabbage. I've also substituted white distilled vinegar for the rice wine vinegar. For slightly fewer calories, I've toasted the noodles in the oven (at 350) for about 8-10 minutes instead of browning them in the butter (however, I must admit - everything's better with butter!).  Try adding cooked shredded chicken for a more substantial dish.  And I occasionally like to mix things up a bit and use the "oriental" flavored ramen noodles.  Mmmm, writing about this salad makes me want to go make it right now!

I can't help but to think I did something wrong. Everyone else gives this a five and Im thinking negitive five. Maybe I did something wrong or didn't do something right.

The salad was good, not great. I used 1/2 a head of cabbage, but it actually turned out to be too much for the dressing as the dressing seemed to be very light. Next time, I'll increase the ingredients for the dressing. I also put mandarin oranges in the salad and i think thats what actually MADE the salad. Overall, good salad, but the dressing needs tweeking.

My boyfriend hates creamy coleslaw, so I tried this recipe and it was a HIT! I added mandarin oranges, which were awesome with the sweet tangy dressing. Will make over and over, thanks :)

After making this salad, there was one thing I added to add a little substance to the meal -- CHICKEN!  My wife liked the salad, so I'll make this again. Though some of the ingredients were a little hard to find.

This is almost the same as a very popular recipe which swept Australia a few years ago, and is still very popular. There, the recipe is printed on packs of "Changs" fried noodles. If ready-fried noodles are available in the us you can save yourself any cooking (if you use ready toasted almonds, otherwise toast in a dry frypan).
I substitute dry slaw mix, which has bits of red cabbage and grated carrot, so the finished salad is much more attractive than with straight cabbage.
Everyone in Australia seems to just love this salad!

Quite yummy! I added shredded rotisserie chicken which made it a terrific meal. Eat it immediately, as it gets soggy as leftovers (although it still tastes great)

I have made this recipe several times now and LOVE it!  The only thing I do different is that I use the oriental package of ramen noodles along with the oriental flavor packet it comes with.  It gives the salad even more flavor.  I love the fact that this salad keeps so wells and tastes great even after a couple of days in the frige!

My mom requested this salad, but she said it had a bit too much vinegar.  I added an extra head of cabbage as well, as the other ingredients drowned the single head of cabbage.  Overall, I loved the recipe, but my mom said it was still missing something.

Very Good recipe.  I didn't use sesame seeds or oil and instead of cider vinegar I used Italian dressing.  It turned out very well and was impressed with the left overs.  Will definitley make this again.  Thank you!

Today I added leftover chicken to make it a more complete dinner salad. too hot to cook.

Amazing! I would just cut down a little on both the butter and the oil in the dressing, and add an extra spoonful of soy sauce. It was a huge hit, and we'll certainly be making it often.

This recipe was SO yummy. I made it as a side dish with chicken terriyaki, but I think we ate more of it then we did the terriyaki. My husband had fourth! I will certainly keep this recipe and will make it again soon.

I love this recipe. I get asked over and over to bring it to parties. The ONLY change I do is that I disolve the sugar in the dressing ingredients by heating it first and let it cool. I find its the best way to not get the grainy sugar in the dressing.

This was SOOOO good.  The leftovers are even better. It's still crunchy and I think the taste is better the next day.  Three things I did differently:  Added a bad of broccoli slaw, cooked the dressing and then let it cool (this dissolved the sugar) and we also added bacon crumbles to it. YUMMY!!!

Excellent Recipe! If you store your veggies, toppings, and dressing in separate containers and mix together just before eating the meal will keep for several days. I added shredded carrots, red pepper, and chicken to it.

I added cooked chicken to make it a meal. I love Chinese chicken salad, and I like this version (albeit similar to others I've made) a lot. I added pumpkin seeds (shelled) because I didn't have slivered almonds, and flax seeds because I didn't have sesame seeds. I'll use less seeds (whether sesame or flax) in the future. I'll also use a bit less butter.

I made this with a few additions- a diced red pepper and a pound of chopped chicken tenderloins sauteed in sesame oil with a splash of Asian salad dressing. Salt and pepper the cabbage before mixing in the other ingredients to improve tenderness.

Out of all the Chinese Cabbage Recipes on here, this is by far the best. I think it is because it calls for soy sauce (which I always end up adding anyway) and rice vinegar! Make it often!

Very different but good. Lots of flavor. I did not add green onions, almonds, or sesame seeds since the kids don't care for it but added cilantro. Liked the sesame flavor and was surprised the noodles tasted really good. 2 of 4 kids ate it. Husband liked it.

Very good. Next time I make it I will only use a tablespoon of sesame seeds and less oil, maybe a little bit more vinegar. The browning of the almonds, seeds and noodles in the butter really makes it delicious. I will certainly make again.

A friend's grandmother made this one year, and it was so good, I wanted the recipe.  I never got it, so I searched and searched, and this was the closest recipe I could find and it is SO good!  I have used both bagged cabbage mix and head cabbage, and both work great.  The only change I do is use vegetarian ramen noodles, and I bake my almonds and sesame seeds to brown them.

I make this salad just about every time I need to take a salad somewhere.  It always gets rave reviews.  I make no changes.  Although sometimes I'll add diced chicken to it and make it a main course.   It's fast and easy.  Thank you for this recipe.  It's the absolute best dressing I've tasted in this kind of salad.

Very good and easy! But be careful not to make this far in advance. One time I did it about an hour ahead for a BBQ (not thinking)- it was very soggy, cabbage and all. My mistake though, great recipe if done right! ;)

Delicious.  I added some red peppers and had to use pine nuts instead of almonds.

Perfect! My grandmother makes this salad and I really couldn't find a recipe that was quite what I wanted. The dressing for this recipe is absolutely perfect, though.  I generally do not have sesame seeds, so I skip them. I do, however, add a handful of raisins after my grandmother.  Yummy! I love it, my boyfriend loves it...Will be adding this to my recipe book.

very good! used half of the ramen seasoning packet, and only 3 tbsp of butter. That was more than enough for my taste. also used coleslaw mix, to save time. dressing was a little vinegary, so maybe a little less vinegar next time.

I make this recipe when I have a large gathering or have to bring something to a BBQ.  It is always a hit.  It goes quickly.  I buy the already prepared cold slaw bags and is really quick and easy.

Easy and delicious salad! I used one package on pre-shredded of napa cabbage and one package of shredded broccoli mix. I also used splenda instead of the sugar!

I had never tried Chinese cabbage before. I planted several plants in my garden this fall. When I tasted the beautiful leaves, it was terribly, terrible bitter, and I actually threw some of it out. I followed this recipe exactly and warned my guests of the bitterness. I was totally surprised that the vinegar mixture completely took out the bitterness and left the most delicious salad.It was quickly eaten by guests with many compliments. I could not get over how good it tasted! Make sure you put the crunchies on right before serving.  Luckily, I have more cabbage in the garden. This recipe is a keeper. I will make it on Thanksgiving as well. Thanks.

I have made this recipe many many times for family and friend gatherings. The only substitution I make is cashew pieces for the almonds just out of personal preference. Occasionally I have added shredded chicken to make it a main course salad. I can't even count the number of people who ask me for the recipe. There are two groups who demand that I bring this salad whenever we get together. Thank you so much for this perfect salad recipe.

This salad is like something out of a restaurant. Very Good.  Next time I will greatly reduce the amount of butter used in making the crunchies.  I may use another reviewers suggestion to use the spray butter.  I thought I would have trouble finding Napa Cabbage in my small town but surprisingly Walmart and HyVee had it.  I just never knew what it was until then.  Will definitely make again!

I put baked teriyaki chicken on this salad and it is just good. Alone it's a lot of cabbage salad to ask someone to eat without a lot of textural variation. Anyway. Try it with the chicken. It's good. Especially if your husband is a tough sell sometimes on greens.

I made this for my luau party and it didn't go over well at all. It was just way too salty for anyone to enjoy. This was the first time I made and ate something like this and even with suggestions from others, it still wasn't happening for us. This has potential to be something delious but it definitely needs to be tweaked a few times to get it right from my experience anyway.

Yummy! I didn't have Napa Cabbage, which really makes this salad. I used romaine since I had it and it turned out great! I also baked my almonds and ramen noodles so I didn't have to stand in front of the stove turning them.

Quite fast.  I think the dressing needs less vinegar.  I recommend making everything beforehand and storing in the refrigerator, so that the salad is chilled when served.  Mine was too warm because I made it right before dinner.  The coleslaw express bag of cabbage works very well and saved a lot of time.

I wanted to make this a meal-in-a-salad. So I sauteed adobo seasoned sliced chicken breast in garlic and olive oil. I then tossed the red cabbage and onion in the pan just to knock the chill out. Browned the noodles with flax seeds. VERY YUMMY! Thank you.

I love this recipe! It is GREAT followed exactly as is, but I also think the cabbage and toasted ramen/almond/sesame mixture would be a great base for any Asian-style dressing, especially a peanut or a wasabi one. I'm going to make this again, both with the variations and with the classical dressing!

I guess it's just us but my husband and I did not care for this salad at all.  It was very easy to make which was great but there was way too many sesame seeds in it which in my opinion, overpowered the rest of the salad.  If I were to try making it again, I would definitely cut down on the sesame seeds.

I loved this salad. I served it as a side dish for Teriyaki Steak. I see that lots of folks don't care for it the next day. I on the other hand liked it very much the next day. It wilted and took on the texture of Kim Chi so I added some Korean peppers to it. I thought it was very good. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I love the idea of toasting the noodles! It made it all the more better! I used sunflower seeds since I was out of the others, but I'm looking forward to trying it with the almonds and seasme seeds. I didn't use nearly as much seasame oil as the recipe called for--that would be way too much in my opinion since it's such a flavorful oil. I used about two drops--which was plenty. Otherwise, I thought the dressing was perfect. Also, I used a small head of cabbage--and that was just right. A large head would have been too much.

The basic formula of this recipe was good, but I spruced it up quite a bit from the original (which is why I only gave it 3 stars).  I absolutely loved the concept of flavors that this recipe involved, but it seemed like it was missing a few thing.  Namely, meat and spices.  There is no way that anyone in my household is eating a meat-free dinner, so I browned some ground chicken in advance, then toasted the ramen noodles, sesame seeds & almonds and added the ground chicken to the mixture.  I cooked the ground chicken with a little soy sauce, garlic powder, 5-spice powder, and chili oil.  

I used the pre-made coleslaw mixture, and added about a cup of the mixture in with the chicken/almond/sesame seed/ramen and cooked for approximately 5 minutes to soften slightly.  

As far as the dressing, the recipe definitely doesn't call for enough (as nearly everyone else had mentioned), so I doubled the recipe, and also added garlic powder, ginger, and a touch of chili oil.

I served the mixture on a bed of baby spinach mixed with the remaining raw coleslaw mix.

Everyone loved this dinner!!  I especially loved the crunch that came from the almonds and ramen noodles.  Great basic recipe--I'm eating the leftovers now!

Liked this alot.  I did need more cabbage though as there is way too much dressing.  So I will either cut back on the dressing or add more vegetable.  But it did disappear at the gathering.  I had to use bagged coleslaw mix as that is all the store had.

Have made this several times over the last couple years, and everyone loves it.  I'm not really a cabbage fan, but I really like the napa cabbage in this.  I do use EVOO and a small amount of toasted sesame oil in place of plain vegetable oil.  My only complaint is that it just doesn't keep well ... needs to be mixed together just before serving, and you may as well finish it up and not count on leftovers!

If I followed the recipe exactly, I could feel comfortable giving it 5 stars.  But, I didn't, so I won't.  I used plain cabbage, no almonds, no green onions, and added shredded carrots.  The salad was a hit, we took to a potluck outdoor wedding and didn't bring home any leftovers.  My husband has asked me to make the dressing for this on all our salads!

Incredibly good salad.  Whole family loves it.  We prepared it just as directed and it's perfect.  We did take the advice of another reviewer and keep the topping separate until we actually eat the salad--this also allows for individual preferences.  I don't agree that a coleslaw mix would be as good: the napa cabbage has a nice, mild flavor that combines perfectly with the dressing and crumbly topping. This salad is perfect for those who don't like the flavor of traditional cabbage.

This is a fantastic recipe! I make this all the time now and I have made a few changes based on my preferences. I do not fry the raman noodles with butter - instead I broil them in the oven (only to save the calories). I also often do not have green onions in the house so instead I'll use regular onions diced up very small. I have made this for many groups and they all love it!

very tasty...but I made some changes: I'm vegetarian so I left out the chicken packet and used an equal amount of veggie bouillon instead.  I also used only 2 T butter to brown the noodles--this seemed like plenty.   Finally, I used 1 T brown sugar instead of the white sugar that was called for as it seemed like it would be too much for my tastes.  Yum!

Delicious!  So easy to make.  When I make this for my family I keep the almonds, noodles, and sesame seeds (I saute them along with the other ingredients) seperate so that they don't get soggy in leftovers and we just sprinkle them onto our individual servings.  It's a big hit at potlucks as well.

I made this for my family reunion and everyone loved it.  I did add some extra's to the recipe.  I added shreded carrots and red cabbage to give some flavor and color.

I love this salad and have made it for years.  Sometimes I toast the noodles sometimes I just crunch them and add.  Try the leftovers in a wrap.  Every bit as good!

This is just a great salad, to begin your meal.  Now add this to your salad: I love to marinate tuna steaks (yellow fin or black) in my mixture of a dash of soy sauce, worchestershire sauce, garlic, white wine, maybe fresh cilantro.  Use your imagination. Marinate a few hours or a day. Who cares? Then grill, rare, please.  Take this delicious salad, place the tuna on top, and you are one heck of a chef!
Going to a party??? Take some fresh shrimp, sautee in garlic and white wine. Then add them to this salad---you are another great chef!
You can always add pea pods, mandrin oranges.  Don't have or like Nappa cabbage (can't imagine why not), but choose another cabbage, mix Romaine lettuce.  It's all good!

I'll admit to changing the recipe out of necessity (no ramen flavoring due to a family member with MSG allergy and using regular cabbage because store didn't have Napa cabbage), but I did not enjoy this recipe much.  Even though I used the recommended sugar, it was too tart.  Too many sesame seeds.  Wouldn't make again.

EXCELLENT KAY!!!! Skipped the butter and used canola oil. What I love most about this salad is that you can make it ahead including the dressing and is still nice and crisp. Just throw the topping on when you're ready to serve and you're good to go. Thanks so much as this was the best cabbage salad I've tried so far!!

First time I made this as a diabetic friendly dish by subbing the sugar with Splenda. Was great and my husband couldn't get enough. Now i have tweaked this recipe to be Keto friendly too by subbing the ramen noodle pack with chicken soup flavoring and added pork rind pieces right before serving.) I also added shredded chicken! ) I love being able to take a recipe and tweak it to my dietary needs and i know some people get annoyed at this but everyone want great recipes to add to their personal repertoire. Thanks All Recipes!#

I loved this recipe.  There was a little too much dressing for the medium sized Napa cabbage I bought so I’ll simply buy more cabbage the next time I make it. Thanks for a great dish!

I thought this was a nice change of pace for a salad. I made the recipe exactly as written and added in leftover chopped chicken thigh meat. It was well balanced and loved the crunch bits.

Great salad!  It was a hit for Father’s Day dinner. I prepped the entire salad I’m the morning and then tossed it all together just before serving dinner, so it wouldn’t get soggy. I followed the recipe as written and then added water chestnuts and mandarin oranges. I only used half of the dressing so I will save it for another salad. Next time maybe cut the dressing portion of the recipe I half.

Really good! I used shredded purple cabbage because I wanted to use it up and followed reviewers recommendation to separate the cabbage and crunchies if you weren't eating it all right away.

Unfortunately, I forgot to add the seasoning packet, to the dressing, but I liked the dressing anyway. Also I was distracted while browning the crunchies, and they were pretty we're pretty dark, but OK.
I really think this would be a great salad with some chicken added. I will make this again, but only  when  there are no distractions.

Made this recipe for this first time today and was very surprised how much I loved it. I had extra cabbage from another recipe and was searching for ways to use it and stumbled upon this recipe. The only changes I made was substituting honey for the sugar and adding grilled chicken. What a great lunch! The dressing is what makes this recipe. Don't skip the sesame oil! Will definitely make again

We love this!  The ramen-almond topping mixture is amazing!  For 2 of us, I'll only mix 1/2 of each thing -- cabbage, crunchy mixture, dressing.  Then we'll save the rest in 3 separate containers to mix and eat another time.

Great for camping!  I put it in a large plastic tub and keep the dressing separate until ready to serve.  It keeps really well and is a huge hit.  It helps to break up the camp food monotony with something fresh and green.

Delicious!  This was the second version of Nappa Cabbage salad that I've tried.  It was much more to the liking of my family.  We tweaked the recipe using 2 blocks of plain ramen-style noodles (no seasoning packets), no sugar, half the butter, and half the sesame seeds.

Like others suggested I kept the ingredients in 3 separate containers.  My ramen was hard to crumble so I used my food processor to chop it.  I used the slicing disk for the cabbage (the grater turned it into mush) and used the grater disk to grate a few carrots.   

I mixed the dressing ingredients in a small jar (also added a pinch of ginger) by shaking the jar.  Easy to store then also.

Nice to have a new salad to serve to my vegetarian friends.  Everyone really liked it.

Good recipe. I adapted slightly for what I had on hand... Pine nuts instead of almonds and spicy sesame oil since I didn't have regular. I also used peanut oil but doubt that made a huge difference. Good as is I'm sure, but I kinda liked the spice :)

This "Chinese Napa Cabbage Salad" was delicious! I left out the butter and ramen noodles (due to milk and grain intolerance) and green onions (don't like them) and used a tad of honey instead of sugar. I was surprised that this salad was so similar to what I have been making off the cuff for years. Thank you Hopps for sharing your recipe.

MADE SOME CHANGES- I used this recipe since it was so similar to one I have at home in Calif.  In that recipe, I don't use the ramen seasoning packet, and instead of vegetable oil, it called for peanut oil.  Also, other good additions are shredded carrot and chopped cilantro.  The sesame seed, almonds, and ramen noodles can be toasted on a sheet in a toaster oven rather than using butter on the stove.  Four stars for using that Ramen packet.  too much salt and chemicals to suit me!

The ingredients sound totally strange on this, but it is actually pretty good. I tried it at a 4th of July bbq. It mostly looks like a mix of cabbage and ramen noodles, but the flavors transform themselves and it looks healthy. The ramen does stay crunchy in this.

Great recipe. Made a couple of changes - Dry toast the sesame and almonds in a pan (not the ramen noodles) and I don't add the seasoning packet from the ramen. Just omit it and it still tastes great.

Love the recipe, but I don't care for all the calorie in the Ramen noodles. I generally us Saifun bean threads and boil and chop them before adding them, but they can be fried as well.

We have had this salad many times before but when we used this recipe, we had a hard time staying away from it.  The difference was the sautéing of the noodles, almonds, etc, that we had never done before.

Amazing! I could not stop eating this. I used only about 1/2 of a packet of the seasoning mix to reduce the sodium, and it was still delicious. I recommend it highly. I brought it to a party and had to come home and make more.

I make this all the time but add carrots and broccoli. I usually make it for lunches for the entire week by having 2 zip locks, and a bottle for the dressing. Put all "crunchy" items in a bad, ramen, almonds, sesame seeds. Then put all veggies in a separate bag that way nothing looses it's crunch. Bring the dressing along and toss before eating! If I add chicken I can easily get a weeks worth of healthy salads out of this recipe!

Made this exactly as written (increased to make 5 times the servings) for a party. I did add a little finely chopped carrot and green pepper, added only for a little extra color. I also added just a little bit of Chinese hot mustard to the dressing(whisked in with some of the vinegar first, to blend the mustard). I was so pleased with the flavor!!! We like to mix it a little ahead of time, so that the noodles actually soak up some of the dressing and take-on more of a noodle texture, instead of a crunchy texture and the cabbage softens more and wilts. Really, I like it both ways - crunchy and soft! Added the rest of the dressing close to serving time. Thanks for sharing - this one's a keeper!!

My husband liked this one more than I did. I loved the noodle/almond mix and cabbage, but the dressing only tasted good when we used the least possible amount. I think it's the sesame oil--it smells like burnt coffee. I added more sugar in the dressing to compensate. I'm not sure if that's supposed to be that way or we just got a bad bottle--this is my first time cooking with it, so I'm not sure what sesame oil's supposed to taste like. I would try again, but with half as much of the oil, or with different oil.

As other reviewers suggested, I stored the cabbage, dressing and noodles separately and mixed at serving time.  For a healthier dish DO NOT use the ramen seasoning packet.  I sprinkled a bit of Herb ox sodium free chicken bouillon granules on mine, but the noodles can go without any seasoning.  I cut back on oil a bit and I didn't have sesame seeds and it was fine without.  Great salad.  Thanks for posting.

Very good salad!  Stored the shredded napa cabbage, ramen blend and dressing separately.  The cabbage keeps for a few days and you can quickly toss it with the dressing just prior to serving.  Then, top with ramen blend and you have a quick, crisp salad.   Modifications made:  Bean sprouts were added and the ramen mixture was fried in 1 Tblsp canola oil instead of butter and it still was wonderfully crispy.

Everyone at the get-together liked it.  I used only 2 tbsp of butter and that was plenty to brown the noodles.  A 1/4 cup isn't necessary and is just too much grease.  Next time I make it, I will use a little less almonds and sesame seeds, it was just a bit much for how much napa there was.  I used the whole head of the largest I could find at the grocery store.

Very good, I added 2 shredded carrots for color as well.  I made the cabbage and dressed it but didn't add the butter/ramen/almond mixture until shortly before serving because I was afraid they'd get soggy and I never made this before.  I'm not sure how much in advance you could do it beforehand.

This is my favorite salad. I make it all the time. I often make it with regular cabbage and it's still great. I'm a big vinegar fan, so I often double the vinegar. I also prefer using 1/2 apple juice and 1/2 extra virgin olive oil for the oil. One final thing I do differently sometimes is use double the ramen noodles. These will soak up the dressing, so if I do this I add some extra oil/vinger/(apple juice).

I love Love LOVE this easy salad.  I made it almost exactly as in the recipe, but cut down a bit on the oil and vinegar.  I am QUITE happy with how it turned out!  I will definitely make it again and I might try reducing the oil & butter even more next time.  Thanks very much for an excellent, easy, cheap recipe!

This was an excellent recipes...a keeper in our house. The only substitutions I made was I exchanged toasted cashews for almonds. I also didn't use any sunflower seeds. As another reviews said, it's best on the first day. The cashews and noodles will not stay crisp on day two, but it's still tasty!

This recipe was very good. I didn't have almonds, so I omited them, and I didn't use the ramen noodle packets. I also reserved some of the browned seseme seeds as a topping to put on top. Very very good.

I have made this recipe numerous times, and my sorority sisters expect it at our last meeting of the year, when we have our pitch-in.

I made this for a large crowd and it turned out excellent! I cannot count how many people asked me for the recipe, I think that says a lot!

I was craving this salad and took a chance on finding the recipe online and here it is!  My mom has been making this salad for her summer luncheons since I was in middle school and it has always been a hit...very light and refreshing on a warm day!

This is an excellent recipe!  I added chicken breasts.  I grilled them, let them cool, then cut them.  Easy recipe and very tasty!

Easy to make and tasty!  Here are the changes I made:  used "oriental" instead of "chicken" flavored ramen, didn't use sesame seeds (didn't have any on hand), used 1/4 light sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  My daughter loved it and we will make it again!

I absolutely loved it.  I was kind of worried about the dressing and how it would turn out but no worries anymore.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe for many events and always get rave reviews! Even my picky picky grandfather loved it and asked me to make it for the next time! Like others said - it isn't the most visually appealing - but the taste takes care of it!

Very tasty, but does not make for the prettiest presentation due to all the oil in the dressing.  If I make again I will add a pinch of salt and only use 2/3 of the dressing.
