I wasn't sure about making this as I hate beer and no one in my house drinks it.  I also don't like very spicy foods. However, I took a chance and used Heineken for this recipe as well as the taco seasoning and tomatoes with chilies and the soup was DELICIOUS. I couldn't detect a "beer" taste in the soup at all and found it to be a bit on the mild side. Everyone in my family loved it. I made another pot for tailgating - it was the most popular dish - everyone wanted seconds and the recipe. It's easy to put together.  You could easily substitute chicken broth, as many people have, and leave off the cheese and sour cream (or use reduced calorie products)and use baked chips to make it more diet friendly.  I put mine in the crock pot before going to bed.  The chicken was frozen when I put it in the pot.  The next morning, it was so well cooked, I didn't have to take it out and shred it.  All I had to do is "grab" each breast a couple of times with tongs and the chicken just fell apart.  Then I gave it a good stir and that's all it took to shred it.

I brought this to my Texas Holdem Poker nite.  Everyone liked it.  Im on a budget of 20 dollars.  So I only used 4 chicken breast, doubled the recipe, added water no beer or chicken broth ( the chicken makes its own in the water) doubled everything else. You need large crockpot.  Just threw everything in the crockpot.  Took chicken out about 4 or 5  hours later cut it up threw back in.  Also added a little cumin and chilli powder next time I will add a little cilantro.  Served it with nacho chips.  Sour cream and cheese would have been good with it though.  Served a crowd and was under my 20 dollar budget. And even after cutting the chiken back there was still a good amount in it.

People are really getting on my nerves saying "Leave out the beer!" No, do not leave out the beer. USE THE CORRECT KIND OF BEER!!! You need to use a DARK, MEXICAN BEER, not your husband's Natty Light, Miller Lite, Colt45 or whatever it is people have been using. This is an excellent recipe, I urge people to not leave out "key ingredients".

Very good!  I cooked this for 10 hours instead of 5 (since I was at work) & it turned out great.  I followed advice from other reviewers & added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cummin & 4 T taco seasoning.  Used pinto beans instead of chili beans and added a full 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar at the end - I felt the beer gave it a weird bite or bitter taste.  Next time I'll skip the beer and just add chicken broth in it's place.   Defintely needs a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar, but overall a keeper recipe!

Five stars for quick, easy, and tasty.  Plus, I already had everything in the house.  I left out the beer and used one cup homemade chicken broth instead.  I used two chicken breasts and that seemed like a good amount.  I also used fire-roasted frozen corn from Trader Joe's (instead of canned).  Garnished with light sour cream and fresh cilantro, and served with tortilla strips for dipping!  Yum!

This is an easy, GREAT recipe ... especially if you use about 1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders in place of the boneless breasts BUT ... FORGET THE BEER!  Next time I'll use a can of chicken broth.  Beer gives an unusual flavor that we did NOT care for.

This soup is not bad. It needs more seasoning. I added some chili powder, cumin, flaked red pepper, salt, and garlic powder.

This is a great recipe, low in fat and full of fiber.  Yummy!!! It made alot and would be great when you have guests over for dinner.  I did make a couple of changes based on previous reviews.  I left out the onion because my family doesn't like it.  I left out the beer and added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup of chicken broth (both FF). I used lowfat sourcream and reduced fat mexican cheese and lowfat tortilla chips when serving the soup.

If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I totally would. It is AMAZING. I will say that a key to making this soup so good is using a homemade taco seasoning. Cuts down on the salt, and boosts the flavor. I used three tablespoons of homemade taco seasoning which happened to be the perfect amount. Plus, rinse your canned vegetables/beans! This will cut back on the salt taste that you would normally notice. You want to taste the seasoning, not the salt! The only things I changed on this recipe is adding worchestershire sauce AND I used a large can of tomato paste, in place of the tomato sauce, and only adding 8 oz. of water. It made it thicker than sauce but the tomato flavor was much richer. I used two large cans of cooked chicken which was a good amount. My husband RAVED about this soup, and he's not much of a soup eater. He had two helpings. And I was so taken aback by the flavor of this soup. I paired it with the Mexican Cornbread 2 from this site. Really complimented each other well. Thank you times infinity for the person who shared this recipe. I look forward to the following day's leftovers!

This is an incredible soup!  I made mine on top of the stove, and was sooooo happy with it!  The only thing I did differently was add 1 lb. of browned ground beef and a 15 oz can of beef broth.  I substituted a 6 oz can of tomato paste and 3 cans of water for the tomato sauce - but other than that, it was the same.  It is awesome with cornbread!

This is a family favorite, I double the recipe and freeze half for dinner on a night that I work late.  I did change the cheddar cheese to velveeta cheese, it blends in better and it gives the soup a creamy taste and texture.

Really Good!  1 key ingredient is to use MEXICAN Tomato sauce (found in the Mexican aisle at the grocery store).  It adds SO much more flavor then regular tomato sauce and definitely gives it a kick.  I used the recommend taco spices and Corona.  I only had 1 can of Rotel so I left the other one out totally.  I also drained both the chili beans & black beans which is why it my soup ended up so thick (which was fine by us).... The next day, we used the shredded chicken (there was a lot) for tacos and the day after I made enchiladas out of it which were awesome (dipped corn tortillas in warm cream of mushroom soup, piled on some of the chicken mixture, shredded cheese and green onion.  Rolled and put in baking dish.  Poured 1 can of red enchilada sauce over dish, covered with cheese.  Wrapped dish in foil and baked at 350 for 30 minutes (20 covered, 10 uncovered). Really Delicious :)... And we still have a ton of chicken left over!

I would actually rate this about a 4.5....I thought it was a great EASY meal, but my husband said it was just ok.  Suprisingly enough as we both very much enjoy beer, I think it was the "beer" taste he (and I) didn't care for.  I did use a Sam Adams Summer Ale which is a pretty flavorful beer, so perhaps that was the problem.  I will try a black and tan next time and if the "beer taste" stil exists, I'll switch to chicken broth.  I followed the recipe, except I used kidney beans and only 3 chicken breasts (it was plenty of chicken!).  The best part of this soup is that the prep that took the longest was dicing an onion!  Thanks for the recipe!

*Update*  I just thoroughly ENJOYED a bowl of leftover soup...the beer taste was much less noticable reheated....it was outstanding!!!

*UPDATE 2*  I made this the second time using chicken broth in place of the beer and what a difference!  We both thoroughly enjoyed it and the leftovers are amazing.

Yet another highly rated recipe that was just so so for me. I can't quite put my finger on it but there was something off a little. I would have guessed the beer as the culprit but no one, not even the beer-haters claimed to taste the beer at all. With that said, the suggested toppings of sour cream and cheddar cheese did greatly improve the flavour. In addition to these toppings  I added a very small amount of thinly sliced green onion and fresh cilantro.

The first time I made this I thought it tasted very good, but lacked some flavor. I did some research and found many recipes that added a package of dry ranch dressing. I just made this a second time with that addition and it made all the difference and really added flavor. This is a great recipe.

This soup was amazing. I used hot Ro-tel (the kind with habaneros), chili beans in hot sauce, Trader Jose's dark beer, and a 1.3 oz bag of TJ's taco seasoning. It was incredible, with just the right amount of spice. My boyfriend ate 4 bowls and proclaimed it the new title-holder of the best dish I've ever made.

This was absolutely delicious and easy!  My husband ate two bowls, and would have eaten three but was too full!  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces (schedule did not allow time for shredding tonight), and added fresh chopped cilantro.  I spiced the mix up with two tablespoons of chili powder, a teaspoon of cumin, and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Cooked for 8 hours on low. Thanks so much for sharing!  Added 5/6/11:  I've made this so many times, I think I've perfected it by adding more cumin, only one can black beans (skip the chili beans) and subbing one of the cans of Rotel for a can of zucchini with tomato.  I also add a small diced summer squash for even more veg.  This freezes well, too.

Absolutely delicious!  Wish I could give it MORE than 5 stars!!!  I made the recommended Bill Echol's taco seasoning, and put all of it in the soup.  Used a bottle of Shiner Bock for the beer.  Did not need to remove the chicken breasts after the 5 hours, just used two forks in the crock pot and they shredded easily. Served each bowl topped with fresh cilantro, and had a 'topping bar' that everyone used to top their soup as they liked - tortilla chips, diced tomatoes, diced avocado, sour cream, grated cheese, and fresh lime wedges to squeeze over the soup! CanNOT say enough about it!  Very healthy, ingredients were inexpensive, and the whole bowl had a great fresh taste with the cilantro and fresh lime, a creaminess from the sour cream, crunch from the crunched up chips, and gooeyness from the cheese!

Good recipe. I like to sear the chicken before putting it in the slow cooker - it adds a lot of flavor. If you don't like beer, use an equal amount of chicken broth. Just watch the other salt that you add. I drain and rinse my beans, always. I don't use premade taco seasoning - I just add cumin, chili powder, Mexican oregano to taste. Fresh, chopped garlic is an absolute must, 2 or 3 cloves. A little lime juice and/or cilantro are nice additions at the end.

Although there was nothing remotely wrong with it, there wasn't anything superb about it either.  Family agreed it tasted similar to the 'innards' of the filling for tamale pie.  Thank you for submitting the recipe as it's always nice to try something different.

Loved it! I used chicken broth instead of the beer. It made a ton, but froze really well. When i reheated it i poured it over some rice and it was delicious! It was like a gumbo!

This is one of the BEST recipes that I have gotten off of this site!  I have been looking for a chicken tortilla soup that tastes like the one I order at the Islands Restaurant.  This is it!  Instead of the beer, I use chicken broth.  I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of Ro-tel. I used all kidney beans because I like them.  One time I substituted one tablespoon of chili powder for the taco seasoning and added a few "tamed jalapena peppers in a jar."  I added shredded mozzarella cheese to thicken it.  Delish!  I won't be ordering this soup at The Islands anymore.  Thank you RaisinKane aka Patti!

Very good!  I can't believe I haven't rated this.  We have this almost religiously.  The beans are easy to substitute with anything you have on hand.  It's also easy to cook on the stove in a dutch oven... It never needs to be cooked as long as it says... or it can be cooked longer!  Very versatile.  Yuengling Light has been my beer of choice lately, but I've used Heineken and Dos Equis with good results -- I think I've used Miller Lite at times, too.  With this last batch, I doubled all the canned ingredients (added an extra can of cream corn), the beer, and tripled Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning I -- it was awesome but too spicy for the kids.  So, the next day (today), I added two more cans of corn, a can of light red kidney beans, two cans of vegetarian beans packed in tomato sauce and another batch of Bill Echols' seasoning (minus the pepper flakes) -- YUM!  The kids really enjoyed the less spicy version, and I'm enjoying a super cheap meal that has fed us multiple times.  As I said, it is VERY versatile. =]

This is a great Weight Watchers recipe...all vegies and high in protein!  I followed the directions exactly and found it to be souperb!  Also makes a great nacho dip when served warm!  I poured my left overs over nachos, added some shredded cheddar cheese and put it in the oven for 8 minutes...great appetizer!

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!  I didn't have time to do this in the slow cooker, so I adjusted for the stove-top.  We don't like the taste of beer, so I subbed that with chicken broth, but used about 24 ounces and more tomato sauce to accomodate stop-top cooking.  I cooked it all for 1 hr, took out the chicken and shredded, put it back and cooked for another hour on a low boil.  I also added some chili powder.  Adding shredded cheese and a dolup of sour cream after poured into a bowl is a MUST.  This one will become a winter staple at my house.

I've been meaning to try this FOREVER! Soooooo good and easy! I used one 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes with chilies instead of the 2 10 oz cans and I threw the chicken in frozen. Perfect!!!

Very good, my family loved this.  It had a stronger beer taste than I would've liked so next time I may only use 1/2 a beer.

I'm not big on soup usually but this oh sweet heaven perfection! Another abnormal for me I never review unless I follow the recipe to the T, but this recipe can stand on its own!!! Out of chili beans at home so I subbed with baked beans - No beer so chicken broth it was- Only 1 can of tomatoes so I threw in salsa. People were eating the soup so fast I didnt have time to dollop sour cream and cheese so I stirred in 1 cup of sour cream to the batch and threw in some stale doritos crumbs. A realistic meal for the frazzled cook at home!!!!

WHOA! As is, it's a zero-star recipe. It gets five stars IF (1) the two cans of tomatoes/green chilies are substituted with two cans diced tomatoes and one can diced green chilies, (2) LOW-SODIUM taco seasoning is used (3) it’s boiled vs "slow cooked." It’s also good with or without chicken!  

For the boiled version: saute the onions; add everything else including already-cooked chicken. Preferred frozen corn, a little healthier (reduces the sodium), when I could eat it. Now, I just add another type of bean. The type of beer doesn't make a difference. But, it DOES need the beer (learned the hard way). Boil to evaporate the alcohol. It's so light and refreshing!   

About the cans of tomatoes and green chilies: Too much chilies taste, and it majorly dragged down the flavor. Same with slow cooking for SEVEN hours. Yuck. You cook away all the flavor, and the beans were mush. We threw it out.   

We look forward to this about once a month—year round!

Wow!!! I have never had a "Taco Soup" before but WOW!! This was delicious, I thickened mine up a little with some cornstarch mixed with water and served it with some buttered egg noodles and it was delicious.

I *LOVE* this recipe! My boyfriend and I really enjoy this soup. I've made it several times in the last couple years. Sometimes I use fat free chicken broth in place of the beer to save some calories. I serve it topped with sour cream, fresh cilantro, and shredded cheddar cheese with Tostitos Scoops for dipping. Leftovers are great served burrito-style in flour tortillas with all the fixings.  Yum! Thanks for the great recipe, Patti! :)

This has become a favorite with my family.  I substitute the beer for chicken broth and it turns out particularly well when I substitute the corn for a can of yellow hominy.  Lime wedges to squeeze over it and a touch of cilantro make for an easy complete meal for a busy day.

I actually got this recipe from a parenting forum and then today this recipe was featured in the daily email from allrecipes.com. Funny b/c this is currently in my slow cooker!!! So obviously we love it. I made it the first time in October before my baby was born. One recipe made enough for us to freeze this into 4 containers!! It is just as good thawed out and heated. Instead of beer (we don't drink and have none on hand), I just used water and we added corn. Great on a cold fall/winter day!

Delicious and easy to prepare. I used chicken broth in place of the beer and I also drained and rinsed the black beans. This was one of the best slow cooker recipes that I've tried. This soup also freezes well.

Delicious! Used Chicken broth instead of beer, and used Pinto bean's instead of black beans, all in all, very good! I did the calorie count on the recipe on the recipe calorie counter on Spark People and found it to be 260.2 Calories, which is lower than the suggested on this site, I went half way with 300 for my calorie counter.

Although I like this OK, I found I didn't love it. It seems to be missing something, but I am not sure what. I may play with it a little more to see if I can get it just right for me, or I may merge it with the Slow Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup recipe that is on this site.   I did really like all the beans in this recipe. Maybe I didn't use the right taco seasoning. Next time I may make the taco seasoning recipe that the original author suggested even though I bought a really flavorful mix.

All these reviews...figured this had to be good.  Figured WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!  My husband said it tasted like spicy minestrone with chicken.  It didn't even smell good while it was cooking.  I did use Bill Echols Taco Seasoning as posted by RaiainKane.  Maybe that was the downfall for this recipe.  That is really not how to make your typical homemade Taco Seasoning.  It is quite spicy and I sure won't recommend using it if you don't like your food spicy or if you have young children.  This recipe will goes into my file 13th.

This is a lot like the top rated taco soup, except with shredded chicken and beer instead of water. I've liked the top rated soup, but this is way better. I followed the recipe exactly, and it's wonderful.

I made a huge crock pot full of this soup tonight.  No leftovers!  I read a few reviews before making it and considered making some changes but chose to stick with the recipe for the most part.  I did add some garlic powder, paprika, and one cup of chicken broth.  I also did not add the full 12 oz of beer.  My family LOVED it and I will certainly fix it again!

Tasty!  I used a can of pinto beans instead of black beans (didn't have any).  Also, 15 oz. tomato sauce.  1 3/4 c. frozen corn, 1 can mexican diced tomatos and 1 can diced tomatoes, also the chili beans and this taco seasoning:  Here is the recipe for Bill Echols Taco Seasoning. It really makes this recipe. 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper.(used only 2 tsp . chili powder in the seasoning though)
also 1 Rolling Rock beer.  Delicious!

My large family adores this recipe. I love how crazy simple it is. I use a 16 oz jar of salsa in place of the diced tomatoes w chilies. I have always used broth in place of the beer as I never have one around. But this is the easiest thing ever. I throw in the cans of beans and all the other stuff onto the crock pot w frozen chicken breast filets and by the end of the cycle that chicken is just falling apart and perfect to shred up into the soup. On the rare day there are leftover, they reheat very well.

My family always cringes when I pull out my slow cooker and were hesitant trying this recipe because of the beans and tomatoes. They are soooo glad they did! They begged me to make it again. That's a switch! I followed the recipe exactly but used chicken stock instead of the beer. Make sure you serve it w/the chips.

Skip the beer and sub chicken broth and this comes out great. We top it with cilantro, shredded cheese, a little lime juice, and a dollop of plain yogurt (or you can use sour cream if that's what you prefer). Comes out perfect every time! My kids can't get enough.

Made on stove top with 2 12.5 oz cans of chunk white chicken breast and pinto beans instead of chili beans and simmered about 1 1/2-2 hours. I did not have any corn but will try next time to see which way I like Tried first night with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheddar. It was very good, but second night for leftovers it was awesome since flavors had melded and I tried without sour cream and torn pieces of warm flour tortillas on top...perfect this way for me and hubbie.

I made this chili/soup on a Sunday in my crock pot and it's the most delicious recipe I've made in a long time!  I highly suggest topping it with the shredded Cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  I would also lessen the amount of beer.  I used a can of Miller Lite and although the beer taste is fine, it's pretty potent.  Maybe try using half - 3/4 a can.  Great recipe!!

I must confess, I only tried this because I needed a slow cooker meal for some chicken breasts I had, and the reviews looked good so I gave it a go. Omg - this was so much better than the picture shows. Total winner and is now a Boxing Day favourite! My tip: take the time to shred the chicken.. Worth it for the texture. I used chicken broth instead of beer and it was great too. :)

Excellent!  We loved this recipe and will try again.  Used beer and it turned out great.  I've cooked with beer many times and it's not a taste issue at all once it's cooked, it's about the ingredients of the beer working in the recipe.  PERFECT for the cooler night ahead as we go into winter time. 

UPDATE 12/7/2013 : This has been a cold night soup, a Thanksgiving soup, and a company's coming tonight soup.  SOOOOOOOO easy, sooooooo good, this is a must in our recipe book.  To keep down the calories (it's already pretty healthy) use a low fat sour cream, less cheese, and white corn tortilla instead of chips as the sides/toppers.

Very good!  Used chicken broth instead of the beer and it turned out wonderful.  Have made this twice now and will make it for company.  First time I made it my brother ate two bowls worth knowing that he was going to get dinner with his friends not too long after that.

very yummy, the only changes I made was I did not have any green chilies on hand so I added about 1/2 cup salsa. Also the last 20 minutes of cooking I added lime juice and cilantro.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because my husband and I both hated it, however, my mother and aunt both LOVED it.  The beer was very strong to me and my husband and was too strong to even finish my bowl of soup.  My mother and aunt did not detect any beer taste and was so glad I was giving them all of the leftovers.  Very odd.  I guess it just depends on the person but I would definitely not put the beer in the recipe again IF I decide to even make it again.

this was good!  I cooked it overnight, let the chicken shred into the mixture and used a jar of medium salsa instead of diced tomatoes.  I also took the cover off toward the end to reduce the liquid and served it over rice and on top of nachos during the football game, big hit!  :)

This was very good and easy.  I made a black bean salsa as an appetizer with black beans, corn, tomatoes, lime juice, and cilantro.  When on added that to this soup it was amazing!!  I would say add lime wedges to squeeze in your own lime juice and fresh cilantro to you toppings list.  The lime juice gave it a great flavor.

This was great.  I cubed the raw chicken before putting into the crockpot and added a teaspoon of dried cilantro.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it came out great.  Will make again.

Good recipe...although I used a bottle of Corona and ended up straining the whole pot because the taste was way too overpowering.  I then added chicken broth as I should of in the first place.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Cooking it on high for 4 hrs.

This is wonderful!  Only change I made was to precook chicken by boiling and then shredded it and left it out until last two hours.  And, if you want it more spicy hot, just add chili powder or your favorite hot spice.  This recipe has been requested everytime I serve it.

Very easy, tastes great.  I used vegetable broth instead of the beer and used regular diced tomates w/o chiles; still good even with the substitutions.

Delicious!  Simply divine.  This was just the easiest recipe, and both my husband and I enjoyed it so much.  It's traditional with a little extra zip (jalapenos do that).  I will make this again and again, I'm sure.  Fast and easy!

I can't count how many times I have made this recipe.  It's perfect as is, but sometimes I leave out the beans (I'm intolerant) and add chorizo and rice.  My fiancé likes dark meat, so sometimes I throw a few drumsticks in there for him.  This is such a great, easy and cheap recipe to make and then tailor to your personal liking.  I love it - and am making it tonight for the Super Bowl to root on my Patriots!

Added sour cream at the end to mellow out the heat for the kids. Used 1 tbs of whole chipotle for flavor. Skipped the chili beans. Really good!

It was kinda watery.  The spice was there, but it still seemed to lack something.  Maybe cumin or oregano.  I won't make it again.  Gave most of it to my neighbor

I have tried all the top Chicken Tortilla soup recipes on this site and this one is by far the best!!  Great flavor and super easy.  I did sub 1 can of chicken broth for the beer because I dont like beer at all and added a little cumin.  It turned out so good and my husband always asked for seconds!  thanks for sharing.

Yum! Yum! I had frozen corn instead of canned.  I didn't use the tomato sauce because I did not want a tomato base. I substituted the beer for chicken broth and added paprika, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder.  I waited until it was cooked to determine if it needed salt and I'm glad I did because it did not.  The taco seasoning and green chiles are key.  I threw in the boneless, skinless chicken breast while they were frozen.  5 hours later. Viola! My 8 year old said I should open a restaurant and only serve this soup...LOL!

I have made 4-5 different kinds of "taco" soups... this was delicious, but after 5 hours, my chicken was starting to get overcooked (a little mushy) (maybe my cooker cooks hotter ??). And, by slow cooking, the lid is on the entire time, and I don't think the alcohol gets to cook off. I could taste the beer too much. When I make again, I will use broth or stock instead of the beer and cook for only 4-5 hours with my slow cooker.

This was delicious! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I followed the recipe (including beer) and it was great. I used the taco seasoning recipe Patti Kane posted on 10/17/06(which is also "Taco Seasoning I" on this site). It gave this soup the right amount of kick. I used 3 single chicken breasts but perhaps 4 would have been just as good. I rinsed & drained the black beans. I also used petite diced tomatoes. It fit perfectly in my 2.5 qt crockpot. We skipped the optional ingredients since it was great just the way it is. I can't stop eating it!

This soup was very good. It just needed a little more spicy flavor to it for my tastes. I added 1tbs of cayenne, 1tbs garlic salt, 1tbs chili powder and a dash of cumin. I served it with crushed torilla chips and a dollup of sour cream. I also added 3 cloves of crushed garlic inthe beginning. Overall I thought it was really good and I will make this again. Thanks for another great soup recipe!

This was fantastic!  We did the recipe exactly the way it was written and we loved it.  We will definitely be making this again.

Very good recipe. I left out one can of tomatos because my crockpot was to the point of overflowing. I used chicken broth because we don't like the alcohol flavor. The reason I'm giving it a 4 is because, while it was very good, it wasn't the best chili-type soup I've had.

This recipe was soooo EASY to make. I made it twice, but because the first time I made it I just used a Michelob Ultra that was sitting in my fridge from a road race that I was trying to get rid of and it ended up giving the soup a funky taste. Believe me though, I LOVE BEER, you just need to use a HIGHER QUALITY BEER. Second time around I ended up going with a darker mexican beer, NEGRA MODELO and what a difference it makes!!! NO FUNKY TASTE WITH HIGHER QUALITY BEER! Entire family loved it.

I'll be making this for the second time today.  The first time I made this was a huge success for my fiancée and me.  So yummy!  The best part about this recipe is not only that it's quick and easy but also that you can do almost anything you want with it to make it your own.  I always support experimentation.

My family loves this recipe. What they love even more is what I do with the leftovers. I drain off the additional liquid, and heat in the microwave. Then I place a spoonful in Tostitos Scoops. Topped with cheddar and put under the broiler until the cheese melted. Serve with salsa and sour cream.  Yum!!!

Can't say enough good things about this recipe!! I usually don't do it in a slow cooker because I am not that organized in the morning. It can easily be done stovetop on low. I have served it at several parties and it is a hit EVERY TIME!

Making this today for the second time in 2 weeks. Big hit with my family. I did reduce the beer in half and added 2 packages of taco seasoning just because I wanted it more like stew than soup.

Doubled the recipe and decreased it by one can of beans, and one can of chicken broth (used that instead of beer).  It was incredible!  No need to double for a family of 4.

This is a great recipe.  The only change - I used Trader Joe's frozen fire roasted corn instead of canned corn.  I highly recommend using Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe (as the author suggests) on this site instead of a pre-packaged taco seasoning.    Garnishes I'd recommend in addition to the standard chips, cheddar and sour cream are lime wedges and fresh cilantro.  A squeeze of lime and a scattering of fresh cilantro when serving really adds brightness and brings out all the wonderful flavors.   Family loves this.

This turned out great!  I didn't have all the right ingredients because I had planned on a different dinner tonight.  The only substitutions I had to make was cajun seasoning + cumin instead of taco seasoning.  I had 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilis and 1 plain.  I also used only dry black beans because that's what I had on hand.  I used 2 bottles of Leinenkugels fireside nut brown.  I sauted the onion in olive oil with some minced garlic before adding to the crock pot.  I didn't have any corn, but will make sure to pick some up next time I make this.  Turned out awsome, my husband went back for seconds.  Thanks for sharing!  To sarah, some of the other reviewers mentioned using chicken stock in place of the beer.

Terrific! I used the recipe for Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning (listed in a rating here) in place of the packet of taco seasoning and it was great. I omitted the beer and made do without an onion. It was still great. I had some leftover taco shells and put them out on the table. My husband just spooned the chunkiest parts of the soup into the shell and ate it up! My daughters (ages 3 and 5) loved it, too.

There is not that many things that I won't eat, so I was surprised that I was disappointed by this recipe.  It had a lot of great reviews and the ingredients seemed very simple and straightforward.  Once it was made up, I thought it was just terrible!  The beer taste was strange and overpowering...and I love beer!  I would not make this again and would not recommend it to anyone to try.  Sorry.

This wasn't at all bad. The only thing I did differently is I added more onion and some minced garlic. When I served it up, I sprinkled each serving with a dollop of sour cream, sliced green onions and some sliced olived. Iserved the soup with Nacho Tortila Chips and cheese, salsa and bean dips. We all enjoyed the soup and we will definitely have it again. Good Job!!

We were thrilled with this recipe!  I'm not a bean fan so I was worried I wouldn't like this - but it was so delicious!

I didn't use the beer and replaced it with 12 oz. of chicken stock, and also used chicken tenders instead of whole breasts.  I was short on time so I cooked on high for a total of around 4 1/2 hours and it came out beautifully.  Even my picky 1 year old gobbled it up.

Also, we didn't find it too spicy at all, although we did use the "milder" version of Rotel tomatoes.

This is good.  I made it with ground beef instead of chicken only cause I needed something quicker and on hand.  It is just like the slow cooker taco soup.  I omitted the corn.  I used kidney beans, pinto beans and the black beans, all drained and chicken broth instead of the beer.  I used one can of diced tomatos and discovered it was Italian style which I think added even more flavor and then added a small can of diced green chilies.  Everything else I did the same.  It is like chili but I think better.  I cooked it on the stove instead of the slow cooker and it was done in less than a half hour. Tastes great the next day also.

Easy and tasty recipe!  I pre-cooked and shredded the chicken breasts and added them with the rest of the ingredients at the start, so no need to do it later.  I also added a couple tablespoons of chopped, fresh cilantro.  Served it over tortilla chips with sour cream and cheese on top.  It was a hit with the whole family.  Will definitely make this one again.

This soup was fantastic! Unbelievable! It was even better the next day. I subbed chicken broth for the beer (don't like the taste) and a can of all white meat chicken in the last 2 hours (shredded) instead of the chicken breasts. It is great topped with a little shredded cheddar cheese and some crushed tortilla chips. My husband said I could make this once or twice a weeks and he would be thrilled. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly as written, using Modelo dark beer, Bill Echols taco seasoning (3 tablespoons)  and frozen chicken tenderloins. It was especially delicious with all of the options. It made a large batch, so I froze some to be able to use later. Very delicious, even though I am not a beer drinker I enjoyed the extra flavor that the beer gave to the soup. Don't be afraid of the beer, but I agree with another reviewer, use dark Mexican beer.

Simply delicious! It turns more into a chili than it does a soup but I'd prefer a chili any day. I omitted the tortilla chips as I feel this dish is better without and it remains the best tasting chili I've ever had. Not one person that has had it dislikes it!

If I could give this 4.5 stars I would. This was extremely easy to make, tasty, and made a HUGE batch -- it says 8 servings but it looks like 10-12. 

I used a bottle of my Husband's lager and a lot of spicy taco seasoning.  It has a bite which was mitigated by the shredded cheese and sour cream. Tortilla chips gave it a nice crunch. 

I'm going to enjoy this for many lunches to come. Great on a cold winter's day.

I love this recipe! I cut back on the spice a bit by using 2 cans of plain diced tomatoes and separately adding 2 cans of mild green chiles. I double the chicken and add 1 or 2 cups of chicken broth (however much is necessary for enough liquid). I also add some cilantro at the end, along with the sour cream.  Don't skip the cilantro, it makes a big difference!  Easy and delicious...it doesn't get better than that!

This recipe is, to put it simply, awesome. I've always made it with the homemade taco seasoning referenced by other reviewers so I can't say how it would taste with the packaged stuff from the grocery store. With the homemade stuff, it comes out delicious and has met with rave reviews every time that I've made it.

I've made this 3 times now and the last time doubled the seasoning to kick things up a notch which was appreciated by all but two of my children who don't like spicy. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Oh, and I put in 1 fewer chicken breasts than called for - as-written we felt that the quantity of chicken once shredded was a little much. If you like a meaty soup then you'll like it as-written; however, we like it better with a little less meat. Excellent recipe!!

This recipe is a keeper for me!  I only made two alterations: chicken broth in place of the beer because I didn't have any, and the addition of a large can of green chiles.  Great flavor!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was absolutely delicious, and I don't even like soup.  I have finally found one.  The only thing I changed was 2 cans of black beans since we don't like kidney beans too much.  Thanks for a GREAT and EASY recipe!

This recipe is ridiculously easy, yet tastes like you put effort in it!!! I'm having tonight for dinner, with a side of pepper cheese quesadillas..... Cannot wait for hubby to have some, as I know he's going to love it!! AND, it certainly looks and tastes like I really went all out. :)
I didn't use beer, used the chicken stock instead, and as I see I used low sodium taco mix, it will need a little salt. (my mistake) but it has such a nice kick to it, and as this is my first "home made" soup of the season, I would say I am off to a great start!!!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. It's rare that I can follow a recipe verbatim due to some dietary requirements in my household, and that was the case here. But I didn't have to change much. I made Bill Echols' taco seasoning as is recommended in the reviews. I used fresh roasted and diced Hatch green chiles and diced up 3 tomatoes (subbing this for the Rotel). Made my own black beans and used frozen corn. The beer I used was a Sam Adams Oktoberfest, and I only used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. The two breasts totaled 1.45 lbs. of chicken and that was plenty.

It was really easy to make and came out quite good. If I make it again though I might skip the corn and add a blend of masa and chicken broth.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo, and we loved it.  I put everything in the crockpot and by dinner time  the chicken just fell apart.  I added an additional can of beans and corn, and substituted chicken broth for the beer, and also took other reviewers tips and added a tsp. of cumin and garlic powder.

This is one of my all time favorites! If someone doesn't want soup they can eat the chicken like a taco. I make it more Tex-Mex by substituting pinto beans for the black beans and hominy for the corn.

Very easy, healthy, and tasty!  I took the suggestion of some other reviewers and made homemade taco seasoning (recipe also found on this site) but tossed in a little extra cumin and garlic powder, as well as some cayenne pepper since we like spicy food.  Inadvertently forgot to buy chili beans so didn't use those, but tasted fine without.  This does remind me a little more of a chili consistency than a soup, so I might add extra broth next time.  I didn't have to remove the chicken to shred - was able to just shred with a mixing spoon in the pot.

OMG this is amazing. I needed something to throw in the slow cooker last minute due to a evening event. This is wonderful. though i have to admit I had to make a small substitution...as I did not have chili beans. Used refried to give it a boost. But it was still fantastic. I just finished and I cannot wait to eat the left overs tomorrow night

Simply delicious, topped with mexican blend of cheeses finely grated along with the sour cream and bite size tortilla chips. Add jalapenos for a little spice. I also cooked with chicken broth and seasoned with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste during the last hour.

This was sooooooo good!! Did not last long in our house. I took some to work with me to share w/ a couple girlfriends and they loved it and requested the recipe immediately - they could not wait to go home and make it for themselves.  The only changes I made were that I was used chicken broth instead of beer, threw in some chopped jalapenos, and I used 2 10oz can diced tomatoes, and 1 4oz can fire roasted green chilies. We topped it with sour cream, grated cheese, cilantro, and green onions. 
Thank you for the recipe - I will be making this time and time again :-)

Omg!!! So easy & so yummy!! Easy to make substitutions too! I was out of chili beans so I used a can of Ranch style beans. Used 2 cups frozen corn instead of canned & used 2 14.5oz cans plain diced tomatoes & added can do mild diced chilies because that's what I had on hand. Shredded chicken after 5 hours & added back to pot, but ate about 15 minutes later & was awesome!!

Hmmmm, and very unexpected. Am not too fond of beans but I absolutely LOVED this recipe. It was too large for my slow cooker so I made it in the oven, 3hrs at 350, then in the fridge overnight, next day I cut up the chicken and back in the oven at 350 for 2 hours. 
In Québec, we can't find tomatoes with chilies so I put in about 10-15 slices of jalapenos, chopped finely and used one pack of Old ElPasso taco seasoning and replaced the chili beans with baby red beans bacause again, I couldn't find them... served with Kraft Mexican cheese, low fat sour cream and tortillas.... de-li-cious ... a sure bet after a long day outside playing in the snow !!!

This was so easy to prepare the kids were able to help out! There was very little preparations. The down side was, it filled my crock pot to the brim and bubbled over, but I got home in the nick of time and put it in a bigger pot. Plus it didn't smell as good as it tasted, so I was a little worried. But it tasted great and did not disappoint,  we ate with the recommended sides.

I make this recipe often and have shared it with friends.  So easy!  The only thing I change up is the types of beans I use.  I prefer to just use all black beans or 1 can of black beans and 1 can of white.

I made this last night for dinner and it was a hit for my husband and I. However I did not add chili beans since I didn't have any on hand. Instead of the beer I added one can of chicken broth and some water. I added one can of "Rotel" diced tomatoes with green chili's and one regular can of diced tomatoes. Everything else remained the same. Delicious! I love Slow Cooker meals this easy!

This was SUPER tasty!! Even my two year old (not a fan of soups) ate two bowls. I used the chicken broth just because I didn't have any beer and it was delish. And here's a tip: to get your chicken shredded, put it in your kitchnaid mixer and use the paddle attachement. It shreds like nobody's business!

I was another skeptic of this meal because of the beer (I absolutely hate most beers)... But I decided to go ahead with it since it was a very budget friendly meal, and it seemed fairly simple. I used regular ol' Budweiser, and didn't substitute anything. I made some spanish rice and served it with the soup over the rice, a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheese on top of that, with tortilla chips around the outside of the bowl... My extremely picky husband went back for 2nds and 3rds of this! I made enough to freeze some for 'leftovers night' and it froze and reheated amazingly as well! :) I will DEFINITELY be keeping this recipe and making it a staple in our house!

This is the BEST taco soup recipe I have ever tried!  I have made 2 changes, just based on personal preference:  I do not cook with alcohol, so I substitue a bottle of Mexican malt soda for the beer, and I also throw in a packet of dry ranch seasoning.  This gives a huge burst of flavor and is absolutely wonderful.  LOVE, LOVE this recipe!!!  Thanks so much for posting!

This was pretty good...my crockpot wasn't big enough to squeeze in the bottle of beer or the tomato sauce...I did use the liquid from the beans though, so maybe that's why.  Tasted great, but wasn't that much easier than my regular chili recipe, so not sure I'd make it again.

I love this recipe!! Its stupidly easy and always a big hit with my boyfriend and his coworkers. I do make the following changes to suit our tastes but this recipe is delicious as written. We like spicy food so I use diced tomatoes with habaneros. I also tend to be a bit heavy handed with the taco seasoning, and I switch the canned corn for frozen if I have it on hand. (I cook the frozen corn in microwave before putting it into the crockpot) I also cook on low longer than recommended so I get more of a chili consistency. Yum! This has become a staple in our household

This went well with my family, I did not use the beer I used a low sodium chicken broth. Added a drop of sour cream on top.

We love this recipe!  I do not use beer though.   To me, it makes the most sense to put the tomatoes and the chicken in the crock pot for 4-6 hours, then cut chicken, replace it and add the rest of the ingredients, then let that cook 2 more hours.  Why cook the already cooked beans all day?  We prefer Fritos corn chips over the tortilla chips with this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made several changes but also think the recipe is just fine the way it is. The only change I strongly recommend is that I used 2 chicken breasts and 1 package of thigh fillets (boneless; skinless). The thighs were much more moist. I might only use thighs next time- they're cheaper anyway. And don't chicken out (pun intended) on the beer- I used a Newcastle and the final product was great. I roasted 2 ears of corn on the grill and also added some roasted jalepenos- but again I don't think you have to do either.  One of the very few "simple" recipes that was actually good! One note: tortilla soup is often served/made with only chicken stock as the base. (Think chicken noodle soup with tortilla strips instead of noodles).This is much heartier with a stronger tomato flavor. If you prefer the chicken noodle soup style this isn't for you.

This is so good! And super easy! We don't keep beer on the house so I substituted chicken broth. We also don't buy tomatoes with chiles so I use a 15 oz can of tomatoes and a small can of chiles instead. Turns out great every time!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  We followed it to a "T" except that I added in some leftover homemade Spanish rice in the last hour to give it a little extra body.  It was amazing, we ate way too much!  Thanks for a keeper!

It was the perfect warm solution to a winter's day.  My husband and I enjoyed the leftovers thoughout the week and each day was better than the one before.  I will be making this easy and filling soup again.

This is an awesome soup. Just spicy enough. Very filling with all the beans. Added cut up red peppers to get more of my veggies. Great for anyone on Weight Watchers. 8 point serving for quarter pot.

Delicious! I followed this recipe almost exactly as far as ingredients go, but added my own twist. Based on other reviews, I did leave out the beer.  After I dumped in the ingredients, I put some water in each can to rinse out the contents and added that to the soup because it did not seem like enough liquid. After 7 hours in the crockpot on low, I added a (12 oz??) bag of shredded cheddar.  I also mixed some cooled broth with flour and added that to the soup to thicken it slightly.  We served it with hearty bread, tortilla chips, and a dollop of sour cream.  My family loved it!

I didn't have any beer so I used a combination of wine and chicken broth for the liquid.  The chili had an odd aftertaste I think was caused by the wine.  If I make this again, I'll just use broth.

This was very well received by the family when I made it last weekend. I just got done making another batch to freeze. My DH doesn't often like soups with beans, but this one he really likes. I made a few minor changes that I don't think change up the recipe that much. I used two 15 ounce cans of petite diced tomatoes and two 4 oz cans of mild diced chilies. That is what I had on hand.  I doubled the black beans. I substituted chicken broth for the beer and used 5 chicken breasts. Looking at the most useful reviews, I followed the author's recipe for homemade taco seasoning and used 2 T of the seasoning. This turned out great and will be in my collection of make agains.

This soup was so good.  I left out the corn and beer but the flavor was magnificent!  You gotta have a little scoop of sour cream on top and then it's perfection!

I followed this recipe exactly except I left out the chili beans.  After reading the reviews I was torn about whether to use beer or chicken stock, so I used half beer (Dos XX)/half chicken stock.   It was excellent!  Had a great flavor and nice thick consistency.  Can't wait to try  the leftovers for lunch.  I will definitely make this again (and again)! Thanks Patti!

Very tasty! I put my chicken in frozen, and after 3 hours took it out and diced (personal preference to shredded). I used Sam Adams Boston Lager for the beer, and frozen corn instead of canned. I used the Echols taco seasoning recipe in the first review, but went a little light on the crushed pepper flakes and chili powder (neither my son or I like very spicy foods). Everything else was as stated. Great flavor, not too spicy (I was worried about all the canned chilis in the tomatoes). I liked it best with lite sour cream stirred in to make it creamy. Also made a great dip for the 'Hint of Lime' tortilla chips! Picky boyfriend ate quite a bit, so I know he liked it!

This was really tasty.  Made it exactly as written, except my cook time went 7 hours straight through, then I shredded the chicken.  Topped with some reduced-fat cheddar cheese and fat-free sour cream... only 6 WW points and super good.

Delicious! A huge hit at the potluck I took it too. I used frozen chicken breasts (no need to thaw, just toss them in) and cooked it for 8 hours on low. Afterwards I fished out the chicken, shredded it with two forks on a plate, then stirred it back in. Wonderful with corn bread!

This is the first ever recipe on this website that I have ever rated (been a member since '03).  I called it "Mexican Chicken Chili" for my work chili cook off and won 2 years in a row.  Very yummy w/crushed tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheddar.  I substitute 1 can of chicken broth for beer.  This is an easy, wonderful soup or chili.  Great recipe!

Yum-O as Rachael Ray would say!!!  We loved it!  I was really impressed at how "complicated" it tasted...it really does taste like you slaved away to make it.  A keeper for sure!

This recipe was so easy and so delicious! I tend to like more creamy soups, so before I added the shredded chicken, I put about three-fourths of the soup in the blender and pureed it. then I put it back into the crockpot with the chicken. My son loved it that way. Added some shredded Mexican cheese, tortilla strips and sour cream. Awesome! Better than the soup at our nearby Mexican restaurant.

Outstanding! Some additions to this make it perfect and more wholesome!
I boiled a whole chicken and created good stock with veggies and herbs, let it cool, then deboned and used about half the chicken (saving the rest for another meal-freeze in ziplock bag).
I sauteed onion, sweet pepper, and celery and put into the pot. Added sliced carrots, several cloves of garlic and a cup or so of frozen corn.
Used a few cups of the homemade stock, one can of rotel, and some tomato sauce (could use any kind of canned tomatoes).
Used one can of kidneys and one can of pintos.
Top with cilantro, grated cheese, and lime tortilla chips. Serve with cornbread or corn muffins.
Everyone's favorite!
Thanks to all previous reviewers for the great ideas and additions!

This soup was very easy and very good! I used one heaping tablespoon of dried minced onion and a can of reduced sodium chicken broth in place of the beer. I also drained and rinsed the black beans and used reduced sodium taco seasoning. The soup has plenty of zip, and you won't miss the extra salt at all.

I tweaked this a a bit. No beer on hand so I used Chicken stock. I used Pinto, Kidney & black beans, rinsed and added the whole can of corn, water and all. My pals love this and is one of the most often made soups in my home.

I altered this recipe a bit based on what I had on hand, but we love it and are now making it for the third time in three weeks.  It's beyond easy and better than any we've had in restaurants!

I used the Bill Echols seasoning that was recommended, and the first time I made it I thought it called for the whole mixture, but it was delish so I've continued to make it that way.  I didn't have beer so I used chicken broth and some water, and 2 cans of black beans (vs chili beans), 2 cans of Mexi-corn, and 1 can of tomatoes with about a pound of chicken plus the onion.  I garnish it with lime juice, cilantro, sliced jalapenos, sour cream, shredded cheese, and tortilla strips.

I've got it going in the crock pot right now in fact!

I've made this recipe 3 times since I first found it here. I absolutely LOVE this soup!! I've alternated between draining the beans and corn and not draining; I think I prefer draining. This last time I used frozen chicken breast and I think that added some liquid to the mix though not too much. Another reviewer here suggested using a dark Mexican beer, so I use Modelo Negro. Top it off with crushed tortilla chips, Mexican blend cheese, sour cream, and guacamole, and I'm all set!! This is a new favorite in my house!!

This is a staple in our home during the winter. So easy and delicious. We don't usually use beer, I sub chicken broth. My husband didn't like the beer taste. Much thicker than a soup, this is one my family calls a stewp! In my opinion the sour cream and cheese really make this recipe stand out. Give it a try, I love it!!

This is SO delicious! I have made this probably 20 times since I ran into the recipe.  I make it exactly as written, have lots of leftovers which is still very good the next day. I let this cook in my crockpot on low while I'm at work all day,(12 hours) I'm sure it's done much sooner but because of my commute/schedule I have to let it cook that long, I come home and shred the chicken, let it cook maybe another half hour to an hour. It makes the whole house smell so good. The beer gives it a really good flavor, melds everything together, kind of a tangy taste if I'm describing that correctly. DO NOT leave that part out, even if it sounds strange, it wouldn't taste the same without it.  Great recipe!

It was a cold morning and I decided to throw this in the slow cooker so it would be ready for lunch. I ended up doing it on 3.5 hours on high and it was very delicious, hearty and satisfying. Based on the ingredients I had, I used three cans of chicken already chunked up, a bottle of Oktoberfest beer (because I live in Germany and it was dark and perfect for the recipe), and because I only had one can of Rotel, I used another of plain diced tomatoes and a can of Mexican corn. Our bowls were topped with shredded Pepper Jack cheese. The whole family, even children ages 2 and 4, ate this right up. Thank you for the easy and cheap recipe that is so tasty.

I've made this several times and have tweaked it to my personal taste. I do use chicken broth just because I always have it on hand. I use Trader Joe's taco seasoning mix and it gives a real kick. Maybe too spicy for some but just perfect in my household. Just what you want to come home to after a long day. Shredded cheddar and sour cream are a must.

Made this following the recipe as written. I used Bill's recipe homemade taco seasoning instead of  package seasoning. This was SO delicious!! Served with cheese and sour cream, sprinkled with green onions. A great recipe! No beer taste at all! I will definately add to the rotation!!!

I love this recipe!  instead of beer I use hard apple cider which goes great with chicken. I also add garbanzo beans cause I love them, and chicken or anduille sausage because my son loves it. this is one of those great recipes that is easy to alter based on your preferences,  and I love just throwing everything into the crock pot and coming back to a meal!

I followed the recipe as is, including with Bill's Echols taco seasoning and wow it was amazing! I used a 12 oz bottle of  Modelo Especial (my personal fav beer). Great flavor, made it about a week ago & making it again today. There will be no leftovers! Thanks for this great recipe

I'm giving this 4 stars because I had to make alterations from the original recipe.  But following the alterations, I loved this soup! 

Beans: 1 can of chili beans and 1 can of kidney beans (with the liquid), I used frozen corn (much better flavor), added 1 can of low sodium tomato soup, omitted the beer and replaced it with chicken stock, replaced the tomatoes and chilies with tomatoes and chilies with lime and cilantro, used 1 packet of chipotle taco seasoning and 1/2 of original low sodium taco seasoning, added 2 teaspoons of cumin, added 1Tb of Sriracha, 1Tbs of garlic powder, and pinch of nutmeg.  For the final change, I replaced the chicken breasts with Wegmans Cilantro-Lime Marinated Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs.  I cooked for a total of 8hrs.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese and chopped cilantro.  This was amazing and had the perfect amount of kick to it.

I took someone's suggestion and did this on the stovetop.  I browned the chicken, then the onions, then added everything else, including about 45 oz of chicken stock (left off the beer).  I didn't have 2 cans of tomatoes so substituted a jar of salsa for one of the cans and used homemade taco seasoning.  I simmered it about 1 1/2 hours, then shredded the chicken, added it back to the pot and served.  The chicken stayed tender this way.  I was able to keep it from overcooking.  This soup as written has been one of my favorites and a freezer staple every winter.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I already loved it, but the stovetop method is my new favorite.  Addition:  I've found that a squeeze of fresh lime juice is a good substitute for sour cream in this recipe, plus this soup is really good with a few slices of avocado on top.

Not sure why this recipe is rated so highly.  It's alright.  We will eat it without complaint, but we definitely won't make it again.  It's just...not that great. I will say that it's super easy.  That part was awesome, oh, and the chicken comes out super tender.

This recipe was okay. It's more of a chicken chili, as other users have said because the chili beans really give it that flavor. I make chili regularly so to me it was a cross between that and a "southwestern chicken dish" (chicken, corn, black beans) dish that I make pretty often. So for those reasons, I probably won't make it again, but otherwise, it was tasty and flavor was good!

Yu - u - ummmmm!!!!!!  I couldn't wait until tomorrow to try this recipe so I made in the oven and used pre-cooked chicken strips.  I put all in corning ware at 325 for 2 hours.  I would love to make this for my parents if I could make it a little less spicy - they have sensitive stomachs.  If anyone has ideas on how to make milder - besides removing red pepper flakes I would appreciate the advise.

As other reviewers have mentioned this recipe does NOT make your house smell good while brewing. That being said, the soup is delicious. I made a few changes. I added about 1/2 more of fresh chopped onion, onion powder, garlic powder, approx. 1/4 - 1/2 cup of water, approx. 1/2 cup of sugar, salt & pepper (like others suggested), and Italian seasoning. I not only drained, but also rinsed my beans before adding them to the crock-pot,  I used frozen corn, because that's what I already had and a Corona beer that had been in my frig for literally months (seriously). This soup is very spicy, but its fabulous! I especially like it when served with the sour cream, cheddar cheese, and tortilla toppings, as suggested by the recipe. I'm really happy I made this! Thanks! :)
My advice for those who are thinking of making this... I think you ABSOLUTELY must tweak this recipe per your specifications. If you know you don't like the bitterness of canned tomato sauce, you have to add sugar, if you are a big onion fan (like me) add more onion, if you like herbs, add herbs, if you don't like beer use white wine, but whatever you do, PLEASE DO NOT USE A CHEAP beer. This is an excellent base and for many its fantastic just the way it is, but if you are a picky Lady like I am, you must tweak it to cater to YOUR taste buds. You are doing yourself an injustice not to spice it up to your liking. That's one of the things I really like about this website. Its encouraged! :)

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!  We always add our chicken breasts frozen, and they cook and shred just fine.  We usually only add 2 chicken breasts, because we store them in the freezer 2 in a package.  We usually add 3 cans of beans, either 2 kidney and 1 black bean, or 2 black bean and 1 kidney.  We use chicken broth instead of beer.  For us, this comes out more like a chilli.  We put cheese on top of it and scoop it up with Tortilla Chips instead of a spoon.  So yummy, so cheap and easy to make, and everyone LOVES it!

I used pinto and black beans, frozen corn, and substituted chicken stock for the beer. Served it topped with sharp cheddar, crushed tortilla chips, avocado slices, and sour cream. Very tasty!

Made this for dinner and we couldn't be around to follow the instructions with the chicken first and then the additional items...so we simply put it all together in the am.  It was rated a 6 out of 10.  The presentation lacked and the flavours were bland.  But, then again, we didn't have time to cook the chicken separately.

Probably the best and most tastiest recipe!  I have made this three times so far and each time without the beer.  This last time I used higher end thin sliced chicken breasts (no gristle), two cans of corn, chicken broth, two large yellow onions, two packages of taco seasoning (my local market has a delicious non-name brand taco seasoning packet), a little extra sea salt, Ro*Tel with habanero, hot chili beans and the rest of ingredients as listed.  I did not add any cheese or the tortilla chips which really aren't needed.  Definitely serve with a dollop of sour cream.  It turns into a scrumptious, south-west style "chili bordering on soup" (especially the next day).  The husband loves this so much he tries to come home for lunch to eat it then has it again for dinner.  This last time, I had an extra cup of cooked rice which I threw in the slow cooker as well.  This is a fantastic weekend recipe that is delicious when done and makes perfect leftovers.  Keep in mind the chicken gets tender and easy to shred in the slow cooker so shred it after about 4 hours then mix into the soup.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe....the video showed draining chili beans and black beans....which I did.  I used the recipe for her taco seasoning and Heineken beer.  I found no after taste.  This recipe is exceptional as written.  A squeeze of lime and dollop of sour cream was all it needed.  Awesome and will make again!

This turned out really good. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some and used salsa instead of tomato sauce. Added a few cloves of garlic. Used fresh corn cut off the cob (cooked, three ears of corn). Served in a bowl with a little sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips. Would also be good as a filling for tacos or borritos.

I saw the video of this recipe on the the All Recipe roku channel and could not wait to make it.  It was good and i will prob make it again as an easy weekday meal but it is missing "something".  some spice or just something to give it a bit of pizzazz.  I followed the recipe but instead of a store bought taco seasoning I made my own using a recipe from this site.  maybe that just needed a bit more cayenne or something.  I topped mine with shredded cheddar, sour cream, hot sauce and ate with tortilla chips.  Again, it IS good but just not GREAT.  Oh and I think that 3 WHOLE chicken breast halves may be too much.  I will prob try with 2 WHOLE or 3-4 breast halves next time to make it more of a soup and less of a chili.

I made this minus the beer. It was DELICIOUS! My incredibly picky husband raved about it. It was an easy "dump everything in and let it cook" kind of recipe. I cooked it on high for around 3-4 hours, shredded the chicken, and let it cook for less than one more hour and it was perfect! Definitely a keeper. I also used homemade taco seasoning.

Thought this recipe was awesome! Of course me being extremely picky, didn't add onions or the tomatoes, but followed the recipe and then added an extra can of beans (kidney).  Some people stated that it was spicy but it wasn't spicy at all.  This would be great to bring to a potluck at work!

Great recipe!! I varied the recipe slightly but this recipe is solid and changes can be made w/out sacrificing taste. I sauteed the onions first just to carmelize them for flavor; I had no chili beans so I skipped those, used frozen corn, skipped the beer since I hate beer and have none, made the great taco seasoning that Patti attached to this recipe, and I used canned (Kirkland-Costco) chicken since that's all I had. It was delicious! My husband and coworkers raved about it (all guys)! Try this recipe, you won't regret it!

I used Taco Seasoning I from this site...half the batch....and one can of tomatoes with chilies and one can of plain diced tomatoes since that is what I had on hand. It was plenty spicy! At my max comfort tolerace. I suspect that has to do with using the fresh made seasoning above. The stuff out of the Ortega or Taco Bell package would probably not pack as much punch.

This recipe is great.  Packs a good kick.  If you want less of a kick, just add one tomato w/chilies and one without.  I used chicken broth instead of beer.  Very tasty on a cold winter night.  I made cornbread to go with it... Yummo  Will definitely make again.

Agonized over the beer after reading all of the reviews (I really must get a life....lol).  Do the beer - adds so much flavor!  Killer soup - took it on a ski trip and it was loved - and one lady hated beer!

This recipe is so simple! I love it but I had to add cumin, a bit of season salt, red pepper flakes, white pepper and garlic because it was too bland for my taste. I did not measure any of the above, just to taste.

Wow!  This soup is SO GOOD!  I actually made my on the stovetop, after cooking the chicken breasts in a pan with some no stick spray.   But followed all the ingredients and it is fantastic!  We are getting colds, and this is perfect with the "heat" from the chiles.  Thank you for sharing!

Made as directed & this was really good! (I accidentaly left out the onion @ the start & added about a Tbsp of dried minced onion & a tsp of onion powder later in the process.) SUPER easy to put together and the chicken was so tender it was easy to shred after 5 hours. Even my boyfriend who dosen't like chicken (b/c it's "bland") was pleased with this. Even with Mild chili beans & mild taco seasoning this had some kick, but not a turnoff to those who are sensitive to heat. I'll be making this again & trying it with beef, too!

This was really good and easy.  I used a store-bought rottiserie chicken instead of putting the breasts raw in the crockpot.  Also added 1 can chicken broth and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes w/green chilies.  Served with nacho chips, cheddar and sour cream.

I have been making this for a few years, and it is one of my kids' favorites!  Perfect for a weeknight when  you need something ready when you come home.  We like to serve it over crushed taco-flavored Doritos!

Yes indeed!  I'm a vegetarian, so didn't actually EAT any of this, but I cook for my elderly mom and in-laws regularly, and all three said "GIVE THIS FIVE STARS (and make us more to freeze...!)"  I doubled this recipe, and added (last-minute inspiration) a pound of Velveeta "Mild Mexican" cheese during the last hour of cooking.  I'm tellin' y'all, they lapped it up!  I think I'll serve this  next time I host our (definitely non-vegetarian:):) supper club---with some good cornbread and a salad.

I made some changes so I would have leftovers. I used 5 breasts, a can each of black, pinto and kidney beans. I left out the beer. I also had a bag of frozen corn that I used. I doubled the tomato sauce, used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 can of chopped green chiles. I also had some corn tortillas, so I made my own chips in the over. Went over very well, and we have enough for 2 more dinners each!

My husband declared this my best slow cooker recipe so far! He loved it! After reading the reviews I tweeked it: replaced the beer with broth, put in my own combination of spices, added garlic, a bunch of cilantro, 3 bays, a little green salsa, and cooked it on high for 6 hours. Fantastic flavor!

Loved this!  Definitely a keeper!  Did not use the beer, but great anyway!  Used skinless, boneless thighs for flavor.  Chicken breasts are too dry in the crockpot.

This is a great recipe.  I tweaked it in the following ways. I use two 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes and omitted the tomato sauce. I added a packet of ranch dressing mix and two cloves garlic, minced.  For the beans I used one can of Cuban style black beans and one can of Chipotle pinto beans. I also added a large can of diced ortega chilis.  I use 4 chicken breasts and halfway thru I chop the breast up and add them back to the pot.  It has a kick, great for a rainy cold day!  We serve ours with white rice, either on the side or  the chicken mix served on top.

I'd give this one more stars if I could!!  It was great.  I was a little leary about the beer but could not taste the beer in the soup at all.  I had chicken left over from making a crockpot roasted chicken earlier and used that instead of cooking the breasts with the other ingredients.  This was a wonderful soup for a cold evening.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a wonderful hearty warm recipe for the family on a cold night. Everyone loved it and it was beyond easy and quick to prepare. I also used chicken stock instead of beer. I also added cut up chives for the top along with the sour cream, cheese and crushed tortilla chips. It was great and even better the next day! Everyone requested the recipe. Thanks!

This was very good.  Made it as directed and came out great.  Used Southwestern Style flavored chip strips from Target (Archer Farms) and it gave it some nice zest along with sour cream.  YUM!

I thought this was great.  Doubled recipe and served a crowd tonight.  I thought the recommended (Bill Echols) seasoning mix is what made this one better than other taco soups that I've tried.  The flavor is better.

I thought the soup was pretty good.  I had to change a few things because of the sizes of the cans of ingredients I had on hand.  I cooked mine late at night and let cool.  By the next morning, the beans and the chicken had soaked up alot of the juices.  The spices had had a chance to mellow out.  I will definitely add this to my soup recipes.

This wasn't spicy enough for us. If I was to make it again I think I'd add two packets of taco seasoning instead of one and the spicy rotel instead of regular. I didn't think the beer gave it an odd taste at all (used Red Stripe). It was too thick so I did add a little bit of water in the end to thin it out some (maybe this is what made it not spicy enough).

HATE TO REVIEW SOMETHING THAT WASN'T MADE EXACTLY LIKE THE RECIPE. BUT, I DIDN'T LIKE THE FLAVOR 'AS IS', SO, THIS IS WHAT I CHANGED: USED 2 CANS OF FIRE ROASTED TOMATOES WITH GREEN CHILIS, ADDED A PACKAGE OF DRY RANCH DRESSING MIX, ADDED A PACKAGE OF DRY ONION SOUP MIX. ADDED JUICE FROM 2 VERY JUICY LIMES WHILE COOKING. ABOUT 30 MINS. BEFORE SERVING I ADDED ABOUT 4 TBSP OF CHOPPED FINE CILANTRO. WITH THESE ADDITIONS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. WITHOUT MY CHANGES THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT 3 STARS. WITH MY CHANGES I'D RATE IT A 5 STAR RECIPE.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made NO changes to the recipe.  This family LOVES spicy and this soup had just the right amount.  You really shouldn't skip topping it with cheese and most definitely the sour cream - it's a great balance to the spice.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Oh, my chicken was frozen when I put in the crockpot - came out perfect at the end of cooking time.

This was really good.  The only substitution I made was I had to use taco sauce for the tomato sauce (it was all I had).  
I did expect it to be a little brothy-er than it was.  It came out almost the consistancy of dip or really thick chili.   Stir cheese and sour cream into your bowl and it was great with frito scoops & tortilla scoops eaten like a dip.

I LOVE this recipe. A friend shared it on her blog, & it's one of my favourites! Sure, you could make a bunch of changes here & there if you're wanting to perfect it or tweak it to your exact specifications, but, as a simple throw together meal, you can't ask for much more. I don't change it at all, save for using my own homemade taco seasoning (though I've made it with packaged, and have been equally as pleased...it just has TONS of salt that way). I say go for the beer. I have a feeling that if people think there's too strong of an aftertaste or bitter flavour, then a poor beer choice was made. I always use a lighter flavoured beer, like a pilsner (while I HATE to drink pils, they make for a mild, but delicious additive). I have also made this stove top, and find it, again, delicious. The only thing one may need to do is add an extra can-ful of water to the recipe, not necessarily to make it soupier, but so there's enough liquid to cover your chicken breasts. Oh, and something important (to me, at least) is to always rinse your black beans. If you don't, they'll muddy up the beautiful colours of this soup!
Thanks SO much for the recipe!

very good. I use chicken thighs instead of breasts -- it adds more flavor but you need to dice them instead of shred them.

This was really easy and really good! I added a little extra spices but I think it would have been great without! I didn't have beer so I used a small can of chicken broth. I only had frozen chicken and it worked fine! I will definitely make this again!

Liked this, but to us it had a little too many beans and needed some additional 'spice'.  I have a dish similar to this that I make that is more a thick chili type dish rather than a soup.

SO easy and SO good!  I made this at home and we liked it.  Then I took it to a work party and people loved it!  Don't forget the sour cream, chips and cheddar cheese on top!

This was definently the best taco soup recipe I've ever found or tried.  It was perfectly flavored and everyone who tried it liked it too.  The only thing I can't decide if I like or not is how thick it is - it's so thick that a little goes a long way, but I did add some liquid to it to a couple of bowls and I liked it that way as well.

You can feed a crowd for very little. The whole family loves this soup. I put it together in the crockpot the night before and through it on low as I'm going out to work. I only use 2 chicken breast and that is plenty. I also used the black beans with jalapeno in them. We like it hot in our house.

It's delicious as is, although I took others advice and added garlic powder, salt, and cumin. We like a lot of flavor so it made it perfect for us. Personally I think it tastes even better when left to "marinade" overnight after cooking it.

I made this in a 7-quart crockpot and used Dois Equis as my beer. It's very easy to make. I don't cook very often but this will be a repeat for me. Very filling.

This soup was soo delicous!  For someone who does not know how to cook.. this was super easy.  I followed the advice of several, and did not include the beer.  I substituted it with chicken broth.  I also added mushrooms to it.  I slow cooked it on low for 7 hours, and it came out perfect.  I also followed RaisinKan's season recipe.  Everyone loved it!  I froze the leftovers to warm up for a quick and easy dinner.

Delicious, very hearty, hits the spot.  Used chicken broth instead of beer. Think it was the better choice.

This was really good.   The only thing I didn't add was the beer b/c I didn't have any on hand.  Lots of spice without it being overwhelming.

I made this almost exactly as stated...except I used 2 packages of McCormack Chicken taco seasoning, 1 can chili beans (no black beans) and 1 can of the diced tomatoes. Used chicken broth instead of beer. And I used already cooked cut up chicken. Did not need to be in the crockpot as long as stated because the chicken was already cooked. Very tasty and hearty.

AWESOME recipe!!!
TRY this:  
- add fresh squeezed lime juice to your bowl
- cilantro
- sliced avocados
i used FROZEN chicken breasts, slow cooked for 5.5 hours, took chicken out to shred, continued to cook soup, then added chicken at the end.
DELISH!!! + EASY!!!
thank you for a great recipe!

SO SIMPLE and very good!!  I used 3 TBSP of Bill Echols taco seasoning--would probably be a little spicy for kids with that amount--I did rinse and drain the black beans and used chicken broth instead of the beer--thanks!!

Loved this! My husband said it's the best chicken taco soup he has ever had!  I had most of it on hand except for green chillies so I used jalepenos. It makes a lot so we freezed 1/2 for later.  The taco seasoning makes it and is listed in the first review but here it is as well: Bill Echols Taco Seasoning. It really makes this recipe. 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper

We were not big fans of this.. 1st.. Look at the salt! 2nd it has a overwhelming beer flavor.. If you add cheese and sour cream and add with chips it wasn't to bad.

A rare 5 Star rating (from me)!!! I followed the recipe exactly - as I typically do the first time. GREAT FLAVOR, color, and consistency. I made it for friends who generally prefer mild spiced food .... this was a little spicy for them but they raved about it!!! I'll stay with the recipe as written. I served it with sour cream, sliced avocados, Fritos, Cilantro, and shredded cheese. It's a VERY good recipe and works great with company. THANK YOU PATTI!!!

This soup is awesome. I cook mine on the stove for several hours instead of the slow cooker. I do not use the beer instead I use chicken broth. This is my all time favorite recipe. Makes plenty! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.

Mde this with homemade chicken broth instead of beer and it was wonderful.  My sn and husband ask for this weekly even though they both claim they don't like soups.  I have used all sorts of beans and it is always good.  If I don't have chili beans I will add a bit of chili powder to taste.

I had to substitute creamed corn & tomato soup (instead of tomato sauce) because that's what I had on hand.  I only used 1 can diced tomatoes because it seemed to have plenty of liquid but my husband thought it was too thick so next time I will use the 2nd can.

Delicious I followed just as written except to not add the cumin because I don't like it and it turned out great! I used Coors Light because thats what I had in the fridge and this taste even better the next day.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVEEEE THIS RECIPE!!! I have made this so many times as either a really hearty dip for company with tortilla chips, or I buy shredded lettuce and then put the taco soup on top of it and it's pretty much like a taco salad. The only difference I make in the recipe is using chicken broth in place for the beer. My boyfriend loves when I make this. So simple and delicious!!!!!! :)

Great, easy soup.  My family loved it.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  We will make this again.

I LOVE beer but I agree other reviewers that the beer added a different taste. I used a Sam Adams beer and I first I thought it was the type of beer I used until I read some of the other reviews. I thought this recipe was a good base. It's easy to make. However the beer didn't seem to blend well and the flavor was bland. It seemed to be missing something for me. I was disappointed but I will probably try to make it again and add my own spices.

This went over pretty well with the family. The changes I made were: I only used one can of Rotel, 3T of Taco Seasoning I (from this site) for the spices, and a handful of frozen corn. Next time I'll try it with Chix Broth instead of beer (or a light colored beer.) I used Newcastle and we could still smell/taste the beer in the soup (but it wasn't overpowering) I served with Monterry Jack Cheese, Sourcream and tortilla strip chips. Thanks for a good recipe on such a chilly day!

Everyone loved this soup! I made a few minor changes and cooked in my Dutch Oven. Cooked chicken with onions, garlic, lime juice and cilantro then shredded. Omitted the beer, added 1 cup of chicken stock, used tomato soup and a can of green chilis instead of canned tomatoes, added additional lime and cilantro. Excellent!!

A HUGE thank you to Patti for submitting this. My husband asks me to make this all winter. (It's too hot in Texas to justify making it in July.) My in-laws love it, I love it, my parents love it. It's an all-around crowd-pleaser; you won't be sorry you made it! A few things to note that aren't in the directions: please rinse your beans before adding them to the crock pot! There's way too much sodium in the liquid used to preserve the beans; this recipe doesn't need it. Also: USE Patti's taco seasoning (the most helpful review on the front page.) I know it's "extra work," but there's all kinds of junk/sodium in those taco seasoning packages and her seasoning tastes *SO* much better. If you have the time, I find cubing the chicken breasts beforehand makes the shredding easier - it pretty much falls apart on its own.  For REAL kick-you-in-the-teeth heat, use cans of "Hot" Rotel (just one, unless you're in for the punishment.) For those nights you don't want to be up, use the Mild Rotel. ;)

Not my favorite Mexican themed soup.  I had a whole different taste anticipated, so I think that may have deteriorated my opinion of it.  Thanks for sharing!!

So Delicious!  It's my new favorite soup.  I didn't add all the beans because I didn't have them.  I also used PBR for the beer.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This made for a base of a great soup. I didn't have the chili beans, so I sub. black eyed peas. Also, I didn't have regular corn, so I used cream style. I completely forgot to add the beer (even though I love beer). This was very easy to fix, just dump everything in and go to work, thinking about yummy dinner. My hubby and I almost got sick from eating too much at a time, we just couldn't stop, it was so good!

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was more of chicken chili than a soup. I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the onions and substituting chicken broth for the beer. Turned out perfect and the leftovers were great the next day. This will be one of our new staples!

This is delicious and easy soup! I also used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site which gave it a little kick. I let this cook while I was at work so I could not shred the chicken 5 hours in...shredded it right before serving and it was just as good.

This soup is awesome!  So easy to make, smells great, and tastes even better!  I used chicken broth instead of beer like others suggested...  it was a great substitution.  This will definitely become a "regular" slow cooker item for me.

In our family of three, two of us are PICKY when it comes to food.  This is my first rated 5 star rated recipe.  Our 16 yr old, pickiest of all, LOVED it and wanted 2 invite his friends over right away!  Leftovers were gone by then end of day 2.  Not understanding y people are saying it is too salty? Not at all!  I made this using the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe. Honestly, I can't say enough! One week later and I'm ready to make it again!  So YUMMY!!!!! TRY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

Very easy and delicious!  After reading other reviews, and not being a lover of beer, I added chicken broth and it was yummy.  Also could not find tomatoes with green chilis, so substituted enchilada sauce......  still yummy!

After making this as the recipe states, I switched the beer out for chicken stock and added one or two more small chicken breasts. Delicious! I especially love it with the sour cream mixed in. :)

I usually don't review on here, but this was so good that I just had to. I've made it with and without the beer and both ways turn out delicious, especially when topped with cheese and crumbled up chips. I've made it twice now and the second time I used a can of Mexicorn and it added a lot of flavor (I had omitted corn the first time). I definitely recommend this!

FABULOUS! I make this regularly and follow the recipe as is.  I wouldn't change a thing. We like to use the lime flavored tortilla chips - kids like to eat this "soup" - which is more like a chili consistancy - by scooping up with tortilla chips.  Everyone always loves it! Great for large groups.

I am so full and it was so good. The Dam Man said this is a keeper. So the changes I made were, I used one can of diced tomatoes w/green chilies one can plain,one can of pinto beans and one can of El Pato mexican style tomatoe sauce,only had 1/4 cup corn so subbed the rest w/ green beans. I only made the changes because I didn't have the other and the mex tomatoe sauce to make up for only one can of diced tomatoesw/green chilies. Hubby wants to try it subbing chicken brouth for the beer.

Ingenious concept... Dump cans and frozen chicken in Slow Cooker, spend rest of day 'facebooking'. Why didn't I think of this? Not to mention, the scrumtrulescent soup at the end of a long day of lounging... mmm. And forgiving! I used an ancient can of Miller High Life (from the back of the fridge; God knows how it got there in the first place), used pinto instead of chili beans and took RaisinKane's suggestion for Bill Echols' seasoning blend (1 TBSP chili powder 1/4 tsp garlic powder 1/4 tsp onion powder 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 tsp dried oregano 1/2 tsp paprika 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper). I'll probably sweat my way through bowls of this all summer long... it is SO good!

It was a cold and rainy day and I was looking for a good comfort soup and I found it in this one. Easy ingredients that I had on hand and I'm not sure why one reviewer said this lacked in spice and added things. This WAS spicy and lacked in nothing. The beer really added that special touch. If you don't like beer then DON'T complain about the beer taste.....DUH!!!! Come on people!!! This one was easy and lacked for nothing when you need a quick and easy and pick me up for dinner.

I wish I could have followed this recipe to a T but I either didn't have all the ingredients or the right ones. I ended up using one can of tomatoes with jalapeno peppers and another without since I didn't want to burn any tongues off. I didn't use the beer I had, b/c it was either the cherry wheat or the blue moon which I wanted to drink later! so instead, I used chicken broth. I forgot the corn. I used pinto beans for the "chili beans" and I cooked on high for 5 hours. At the 3 hr mark I shredded and returned to the pot.  Served with cornbread from this site. I do enjoy how this recipe is pretty forgiving! sometimes living in NYC- it can pretty hard to find the usual canned mexican fare (I can't find enchilada sauce anywhere!) so this recipe was grocery store friendly. and tummy friendly!

Yum.  This was really good.  I had to cut out one of the cans of rotel tomatoes just because my dh cannot take too much spice.  I just subbed a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting.

This soup was great. I did use a jar of roasted black bean and corn salsa instead of the cans. The beer was a great addition as the soup just has a slight beer taste. I added two cups of homemade chicken stock to the pot as well. Served with cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top. The hubby said it needed rice so when we eat the leftovers I will make rice to go with it. Thanks Patti!

This is really good at the end of a long day.  We spoon it into warm tortillas and top w/ avocado and sour cream.  Beware if you are afraid of too much spice, the combination of the crushed red pepper and the tomatoes w/ chilies really kick this recipe up.  If you want less spice I'd ditch the crushed red pepper or just use italian-style diced tomatoes instead.

Only change I made was chicken broth instead of beer.  I make this fairly regularly. I've also made it for a few parties and it's always the first thing to go! It's been a huge hit so thanks!!   My only advice is to MAKE SURE you use the taco seasoning "recipe" that's offered in the first review. It really makes the soup. (Over time I have increased the amounts of seasoning called for because I don't feel like 1/4 teaspoon of certain spices are enough for us.) We also use it  for other chicken items that need great flavor.   I also add a few extra chicken breasts when I make the soup so they can soak up the great flavor, then put them in tacos or taquitos. Great recipe!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes, although I only gave it 4 stars cos I alter it a little bit.  I add a little spice using some hot sauce.  I also use chicken broth instead of beer.  I tried the beer but my family prefers chicken broth.  I also use kidney beans or two cans of chili beans.  And to cut down on cost, I use chicken thighs, which works just as well.  But this is the most requested dish by my family and friends.

Yummy! I only made 1 change - I used a can of chicken broth instead of the beer...sorry the beer just seemed a bit to strange! Also, I used frozen chicken breasts. I just put everything in the crock pot in the morning, and when I came home that day all I had to do was shred the chicken, great! Oh, the taco seasoning packet was kinda intense - next time I'd use less of it.

LOVE this! i substituted chicken broth for the beer and a can of mild enchilada sauce for the second can of diced tomatoes because that is what i had on hand.  i also added a small can of tomato paste as i wanted a little thicker soup base.  delicious!

i made this for dinnner today. it was so superfabulous. i changed a few things though, based on reviews. i didnt use beer, instead i used chicken broth. and instead of regular taco seasoning i bought the chicken taco seasoning. i also doubled the beans and corn so it was more of a chilli verses a soup. i also  really loved the flavor that the tomatoes with chillis gave to the whole dish.
my family is still raving about dinner. it was awesome.
thank u so much for thise recipie.

A little salty for me, but canned stuff does that. I will make this again but not for a while. DH does not like shredded chicken so I cooked mine on high to keep chicken together and then did a rough chop at the end. Definitely use the sour cream and cheese.  It really cuts the heat and adds some creaminess. Chopped cilantro is good too.

Yikes! 4.5 stars and 927 reviews. Need I say more? Well, yes, actually... I made this recipe exactly as written. I even followed Patti's recipe for the taco seasoning. It tastes very beery! Adding a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkling of cheese and crushed up tortilla chips certainly makes this a decent bowl of soup, but I'm gonna sub chicken broth for the beer if I make this again.

This truly is wonderful.  I followed the other reviews and used 12oz chicken broth instead of beer, and the recipe for taco seasoning given by the submitter instead of the packaged stuff.  I use three or four chicken breasts and it turns out perfect every time.  My husband asks for this soup every week!!!

I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis by accident and I'm so glad I did, it would of been too dry if I hadn't (plus, my boyfriend and I love tomatoes). I was a little disappointed in the taste the day I made the soup. That night we put the leftovers in the refrigerator and reheated it the next day, TOTALLY different soup! It was amazing with some sour cream, crushed tortilla chips and cheese. Make sure you make a day ahead of time and just reheat it in the slow cooker the next day, you won't be sorry. Will make again and again, thanks for sharing!!!!!

Made this last night.  My kids thought it was too spicy. Husband said it was ok.  I liked it, but seemed to be missing something.  Used the beer and 2 cans of black beans instead.  I even scaled back on some of the spicer spices, but it was still pretty spicy!

Made this for book club this week. I had some bone in chicken breast so I boiled them the day before and deboned the chicken. I used the broth for my base added Rotel w/green chilis,black,pinto & chili beans (can of each) and a can of Ranch Style w/jalapenos. I seasoned with Taco seasoning we buy the large containers and I probably used about 3 tablespoons. I also added finely chopped onion and simmered for a couple of hours the first day then heated for 30 minutes or so the next day before serving. I also added a package of Ranch dressing mix the second day. I used mozzarella in stead of cheddar, and the ladies loved it! I usually use the sour cream and chips, but no time to pick them up and make it to the meeting on time. But it is better w/sour cream & chips. Will make this a lot in the future. I really think letting it refrigerate overnight made it more flavorful.

Wow, whole family including extra kids loved this recipe. Used a little less beer (couldn't taste it in the finished product). Make sure you cook it the full 7-8 hours as recipe suggests. Used minced onion for ease. Also used my homemade taco seasoning from this site. Excellent & easy! Always happy when I can please the family with food. Update - made this with a homemade chicken broth (that was delish) instead of the tomato sauce! I also drain & rinse the black beans, they turn it dark.

I used Corona, skipped the chicken, and added a can of cream of chicken soup.  The beer taste is pleasant, but I think next time I make this I will use a little less beer and add a can of chicken broth.  I also recommend making your own spice blend rather than using the taco packets full of who-knows-what.

This was super easy and delicious! I didn't have a taco seasoning packet so I used Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe as some others suggested.  I added a fourth chicken breast but will not do so next time as it ended up too thick and hearty and more like chili. I used half beer and half chicken broth and couldn't taste the beer at all. I cooked it all on medium heat in my slow cooker for 4 hours, shredded the chicken and then cooked for another hour. My husband suggested that next time I top it with a little cilantro and squirt of lime in addition to the other toppings.  We thoroughly enjoyed this and I will be making it again soon.

So easy to prepare.  I omitted the beer since I didn't have any and didn't miss it.  UPDATE: I have made this with both beer and with chicken stock, and I prefer the chicken stock.  Also, if you don't like things super hot, I would suggest using only one can of diced tomatoes with chiles.

This is my new favorite crock-pot recipe. This was really simple to make and had tons of flavor, even my four year old loved it. The beer and taco seasoning go perfectly together. I used a jar of salsa instead of the diced tomatoes and also added a cook of long grain cooked rice and a small can of green chilis. It was delicious and had even better flavor the next day.

I love this recipe and have made it a handful of times.  Several comments indicate that the soup is thin.  I am not the author of this recipe, but the recipe says 3 "whole chicken breasts" which should  (in my mind) be the equivalent of 6 chicken breast halves.  Just a thought on those of you who felt it was thin or that the chicken was tough.  A 10-Star Recipe!

Very tasty and quick to put together in the morning!  I rinsed the beans and corn in a colander under running water to reduce some of the sodium, and it was still salty enough.  By omitting the last three ingredients (sour cream, tortillas and cheese), I was able to drastically reduce the fat and calories, which makes it a great 'diet' dinner.  Next time I will try a bit of non-fat sour cream, and low fat cheese on top with fresh cilantro to garnish.  A definite keeper!!

Excellent soup!  I cooked mine on top the stove, and it came out just fine.  I cooked the chicken ahead of time, then shredded it and added to the soup ingredients.  I simmered the soup for about an hour and a half.  It got rave reviews by my co-workers!

Love this! It's very forgiving too.  I've made a few slight variations depending on what was on hand and it was fine.  This time:  1 can pinto and 1 can black beans, 1 can petite diced tomatoes with zesty jalepinos and one can diced tomatoes Mexican style, 1 cup chicken broth instead of beer (to make up for the extra liquid in the 2nd can of tomatoes) and added 1 can drained jalepinos.  Also you can leave the chicken as is all day, 8 hours, and then shred it and it's still fine.

This was really good!  I put everything in the cooker the night before and totally forgot to add the beer in the morning, but totally didn't miss it.  And we left this in the cooker for 10 hours, because of work, then two more hours after we shredded the chicken, and it still was fine.  Definitely add the cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips.  It makes all the difference.

This recipe is a keeper....amazing!  I cut out the beer but if there was anything missing I couldn't tell. The only complaint my picky son had was that there were too many beans and there were quite a few beans so maybe next time I will reduce the amount of beans.  Even with that complaint he still asked for more!  This makes a lot of soup (serves 8) so there was plenty left over with just the two of us.  You may want to scale the recipe down if you're only serving a few people.  Make sure you add shredded cheese..it makes a big difference...hmm, hmm, good. PS-don't forget to rinse the beans well!

I forgot the onion, substitued beef broth for beer, used ground beef and fajita seasoning and this was still awesome!!  Excellent recipe, added it to my recipe box, which doesn't happen often.

Delicious! And so quick & easy.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs, added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, rinsed & drained the black beans (I hate that liquid they're in), used 1 can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic and one can of the tomatoes with chiles, and forgot the tomato sauce (but I don't think it needs it). I also only used about 1 tsp of taco seasoning (Bill Echols' recipe from this website) and added about 1/4 tsp more cumin, and it was just the right "heat" for my family. Served it topped with crispy tortilla strips (baked) and chopped avocado.  I'm always looking for good crock pot recipes and this one's a keeper!

Delicious!!! I doubled the beans, tomatoes, corn etc. and used 1 can of beer and 1 can of chicken broth. I only used the 3 chicken breasts and it was PLENTY of meat for this soup. squeezed just a smidge of fresh lime  into each bowl of soup and topped with the suggested toppings. The family loved it and everyone had seconds. So easy and stress-free and boy did my house smell good all afternoon!

This is a great recipe. Mine turned out too salty and too spicy. I think the culprit was the can of chili beans. I think I will substitute regular canned pinto beans next time. The chicken turns out nice and moist.

This was such a huge hit at my house I received the following letter from my 10 yr. old son.  Dear Mom, That was the best meal I have had in my life.  You should make it more often.  It's not too spicy.  It's just right.  I want it for my birthday.  Sincerely, Michael
*I used a can of coke in place of the beer.*

Everyone loved this soup! I used 1 quart of tomato juice instead of 8 oz. of tomato sauce and left out the beer.  I also used only one kind of bean.  The soup was spicy & delicious!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was pretty good, but next time I will cook the onions in a skillet prior to putting them in the crock pot.  The onions were still crunchy, and my family does not like uncooked onions.  The flavor is definitely improved with cheese and sour cream.  The only thing I did different was that I used kidney beans instead of chili beans because I didn't have any.  I will probably make it again, but I didn't feel like it deserved five stars.

I've made this over 20 times and love how convenient it is. I can pick all the ingredients from supermarket shelves in about 10 minutes, chop one onion and just throw it all together.

I tend to put in a little bit of liquid smoke and some cayenne pepper for a kick, and like others just use chicken stock instead of beer. Perfect for portioning out low-carb, high protein meals for the week.

Thank you for this easy breezy recipe that did not disappoint. Of course I did tweak it a bit, like adding a dash of cumin, a dash of salt, and I used chicken broth instead of beer. I let the chicken go the entire six hours, and by then the chicken just fell apart. I was amazed at all the flavors this recipe produces! This recipe is definitely a keeper, especially on those hectic days!

As another reviewer said, if you can open a can, you can make this dish.  My DH checked the pantry, took the chicken out of the frig and put it all together, opened the cans and turned on the crock pot.  We spent the better part of the day being tortured by a great aroma as the dish cooked.  A big squeeze of lemon juice and soups on.

We found this very good and very easy. I had to make this Gluten Free so reading the label on each can was essential. Some canned chili beans and packaged taco seasonings do contain wheat flour.  I used some dried black beans and pinto beans I had soaked and cooked previously and stored in the freezer. I didn't have any beer but I don't like cooking with it anyway so I used a can of chicken broth in its place. Also, I only had one can of Rotel vs the two the recipe specified so I used one can of stewed tomatoes in place of the 2nd can of Rotel. It helped cut down the spicy factor as not everyone in the house can handle spicy foods. I put this together the night before and stored in the refrigerator so I could start cooking it first thing the next morning. The chicken breasts I added were frozen but cooked completely by lunch time, shredded easily and were very flavorful.  This is a wonderful recipe! It's fast, easy and filling on a cold day!

This is absolutely scrumptious. It's more like a stew than a soup, but it definitely has broth so it's not like chicken chili. I made my own taco seasoning from another recipe on allrecipes and I do think it added more of a bright, intense flavor. The chicken becomes infused with all these delicious flavors. The corn adds a nice crunch. The beer adds a nice hint of flavor, too. I might try it with chicken thighs next time. I did not eat it with the chips, cheese or sour cream garnish and it was totally delicious as is.

My new favorite soup! Dont be afraid to use the beer. I didnt notice a weird taste at all. I think the type of beer you use does matter. I used another reviewer's suggestion of Shiner Bock and that was delicious. So easy and so delicious!! I've been eating leftovers for two days and can't get enough of this stuff!

Yum  I made this as written with a bottle of Negra Modelo beer. It was delicious. For those reviewers who said all they could taste was beer, you either used cheap nasty beer or didn't let it cook long enough.

Quick, easy and good. Leftovers were even better! I fried small corn tortilla strips to sprinkle on top. Everyone agreed the tortilla strips were the perfect touch.

OK, this is obscenely easy, and tastes great.  If the most work intensive part of a recipe is chopping 1 onion, I have to try it.  To make it even easier, I used frozen chicken breasts (4 at about 1.5lbs = meat lovers).  Works great!  Reading reviews can mess me up sometimes, and with this one, it was "beer, or not to beer".  Half say use beer, and half say use broth.  I chickened out and did half and half.  In reality, beer is often used as a tenderizer which wouldn't be needed for a slow cooker recipe.  I say go with what moves you.  If you're afraid of the taste of beer, I can't imagine 1 beer leaving any flavor.  Avocado, tortilla chips, and shredded cheese makes it.  This is my third slow cooker, Mexican soup from this site.  All 3 are great: Slow Cooker Chicken Tortilla for a less hearty soup; Slow Cooker Pasole for a more meat and potatoes kind of fare; this recipe for when you want something heartier than tortilla.

Love this recipe. We make it on a regular basis. I add in fresh spinach and chopped carrots. I also find the low sodium Rotel to give the perfect kick.

This by far the best recipe I have found on this site. Even though mine turn out more like a chili than a soup, it was absolutely delicious. On a whim I added a bit of extra chili powder. It was not necessary. I am definitely making this again. I didn't mind at all that it did not turn out like a soup. Baked flour tortillas was an added crunch.

This was inedible. It was super spicy and I didn't like the beer flavor (dark, Mexican lager) with the other ingredients. I used 2 chicken breasts but it was still far too much meat.

I did not care for this recipe. I gave it two stars because I have used very similar ingredients (minus the beer) in other soups and it's come out alright, so I honestly think it was the type of beer. I don't think you can just say (12oz) of any beer when there are SO many kinds of beer that would completely change the flavor....SOOOO many different kinds of beer! Tried to save it with the sugar, even read that lemon juice can help....nothing could save it. Had to completely strain out the broth, rinse off the chicken, beans, corn, tomatoes, etc., and luckily I had some old homemade chicken broth and a can of enchilada sauce to salvage my ingredients so we didn't waste money.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the flavor was great.  However, it was way too spicy for my liking, even after using only one can of the tomatoes and chilies.  I also substituted chicken broth for the beer. The next time I make this (and I will make again), I'll opt for 2 cans of plain diced tomatoes and use regular kidney or pinto beans.  I actually cooked my chicken breasts in the crock pot first(so I could eliminate most of the fat), and finished the soup on the stove top.  Very easy to throw together.

Loved the recipe, BUT had to leave out the beer, replaced with chicken broth due to time constraints and stuff on hand.  Added additional onions, and Laredo chili.    Turned out much better then expected.  Was in a hurry to cook 9 lbs of chicken breasts and this was one of the recipes I chose. Will definitely be making it again and hope to have time to read some reviews, to see what others are suggesting.  Thx!

This was an awesome recipe.  The only thing I change was, I had an open can of tomato paste so I used that instead of tomato sauce and added a little water.  I also skipped the green chilis as my husband doesn't care for spicy.  It was awesome. I will definitely make this one again.

This meal has so many recipe options and I'm glad I picked this one. It was full of flavor and just as good the next day. I did add a can of chicken broth to make it a little thinner consistency more like soup instead of chili.

Love this recipe, have made it a few times. My son and husband also love it. This time I'm using some carnita meat I have left over from earlier this week.  The other times I made it as written. 
Thanks for sharing, this one is printed and in my recipe folder. :-)

We loved it!  I don't mess with recipes.  I make them as is.  I'm just not that creative. Otherwise, I wouldn't be using a recipe! I did read in reviews to use a good Mexican beer, so we did a negro modelo.  We loved it!!!  Very easy and delicious.

Oh my good Lord. This was spicy. I like spicy food, but I had no idea that it was going to be this spicy. I wonder if maybe the taco seasoning I used (Trader Joe's) happened to be really spicy and I just didn't notice? Whew, it's going to be tough to finish all of this soup.

This was a great recipe. Very tasty. The only thing I did was to add 4 chicken bullion cubes for more chicken flavor. I'm not a fan of beer but it made the flavor...

We make this soup often.  Even my 3 year old likes it!  I usually substitute chicken broth for the beer, but have made it both ways and both taste good.

Delicious! I used only one 15 oz can of pinto beans, instead of 2 cans of the rotel listed I replaced one with a can of rotel that had cilantro, chicken broth instead of beer, 2 dallops of sour cream and a few slices of fresh jalapeño for a kick. I have very picky eaters in my house and this was a huge success!

I make this and bag it out for lunches, then just throw some shredded cheese and tortilla chips or avocado in the bag and I am out the door. Very yummy reheated as is most chili. I've made it with and without the beer and didnt really notice a difference. I did have to adjust the spices but as the poster said it is a very forgiving recipe. I also recommend taking a serving of it, reduce it in a sauce pan so it isn't so soupy, and top tortilla chips with it and some cheese and broil for 2 mins until cheese is melted. Best nachos ever!

Delicious! I stuck to the recipe and only added avocado and lime as garnishes.  Used Sam Adams lager and served with tortilla chips. Didn't need the cheese or  sour cream. My husband loves this dish and we will be making this again soon! Yum!

Made this to the recipe. I did not however make the taco seasoning. First off I used st Arnold Christmas ale. We could definitely taste the bitterness and smell the beer smell. I will most likely either leave it out next time and add broth or buy Guinness, I am told that is a good one to cook with. So if you are worried about the beer, as I was, that is my take on it. I also think you should make the taco seasoning they suggest you add instead of the packaged stuff. Next time I will also do that. My husband added spices to his liking around the point I needed to take the chicken out to shred it. It needed salt badly and cumin and garlic. Although they were in the seasoning I added, it wasn't enough. For those who want to know if frozen chicken is ok.. go for it! Mine turned out perfect for shredding. I did however set it to high for the first hour then turned it low for the remainder. If you are a garnish person or like toppings this soup is wonderful with sour cream, avocado, shredded cheese and tortilla chips. even some cilantro. 5 stars for a crowd pleaser and overall very delicious recipe!

This is pretty good and easy - I like the beer addition, it adds a little extra something to the soup.  I didn't shred the chicken until about half an hour before cooking time was up (I cooked on low for 7 hours) and it was fine.  It was also pretty cheap to get all the ingredients for this, which as someone on a budget I really appreciate.  I'll definitely keep this one in my back pocket.

This is a good, hearty soup that pairs well with tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, avocado, and other taco toppings. My one year old loved it! I followed the recipe exactly. I used black & tan for the beer and would probably try a different one next time I make it. Also, I used trader joe's taco seasoning and would use homemade seasoning next time.

My entire family loves this soup! We did not use beer, but used chicken broth instead. So, you can skip the beer and not miss out on any flavor. I like my chicken to be shredded, so after it's finished cooking in the crock pot, I take it out, let it cool and run it through my little vegetable chopper (you know, the $10 kind), and it shreds it perfectly. I just dump it back in with all the other ingredients and it is delicious! (I also use White Shoepeg corn as it is our family's favorite)

Really tasty dish. I decided to toss it on a bed of brown rice just to give it some body. With Tostitos Hint of Lime Chips it definitely hit the spot.

It turned out pretty salty.  Don't cut yourself short.  Instead of using the packet of taco seasoning, as the recipe calls for, create your own.  I've made several versions of this and found that this version has been my least preferred.  My husband agreed, its better when I do the seasoning.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was sooo bland! I don't know what I did wrong because everybody else seems to like this recipe! I'm wondering if I used the wrong kind of beer or something because I used an IPA (I didn't know anything about beer at the time) and I think it just overpowered all the other flavors. Did anybody else have this problem? Anyways, very disappointed, but I figure that it's my fault.

all in all the recipe was simple to make and enjoyable to eat with corn chips. i did however add a larger variety of vegetables and doubled the amount of liquids to make it more of a soup. add siracha sauce for more flavor!

More like shredded chicken chili... Easy, delicious, and lasted a while. Love love love this recipe. It is one of my staples since I found it. Seriously just dump a bunch of cans in a slow cooker and wait a few hours. :) Super easy. My 1 yr old loved it (for 3 days straight). Will be making this again.

I needed it for a party. I baked the chicken and then added it. I made the rest on the stove top. I used spicey chili beans and black beans with jalapeños. I also used suggested taco season recipe. It was a hit.

The first time I made it I used everything to exact measurements, And used the homemade taco seasoning. And depending on what brands you buy, you can lower/increase the calories. My ONLY change this time will be a tsp. less chili powder. This past time had juuust a bit more kick than I love. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for dinner tonight for the family. First time making any type of Mexican soup. Loved it!

However, I made some changes right from the get-go. I used a 6-Qt slow cooker so I wanted to almost double the batch.

I deleted the chili beans because we just don't like them. Instead I added two cans of black beans (rinsed and drained). Even though I doubled recipe, I only used one bottle of beer and the two cans black beans (NO chili beans at all) and 2 1/2 pounds chicken breasts (approx. 3 large breasts). Doubled everything else. The soup was just soupy enough without being too runny. 

We garnished with sour cream, shredded 4 cheese Mexican blend, sliced green onions and fresh avocado with a side of mini corn bread. Yummm!

I used 2 lbs of stew beef that I had leftover from Costco.  I browned it in a large pan before adding it to the soup. I used two packets of taco seasoning also. Since I don't have a slow cooker I cooked it on the stove to a gentile boil for 4 hours, and then I spooned out the meat to shred.  I cooked it another hour after and it was absolutely delicious. This is a versatile dish with sides and accompaniments. My husband likes the drained filling in burritos.

This soup/chilli is delicious! Only made on substitution:  I used a can of red kidney beans with a "chilli" recipe since I couldn't find one in my grocery store.  Used a bottle of Corona and frozen corn and there's absolutely no beer taste.  I cooked in the slow cooker on High for about 4 hours, and started shredding the chicken around the 3 hour mark.  Then put it on low for another 2 hours.  So, so yummy.  I like spicy so if you don't, then I'd definitely recommend using diced tomatoes without the chiles or only one with chiles.  You can always make spicier later.  I would probably only do 2 chicken breasts next time as well... a little too much chicken in my book.  Great on a chilly day!

This was really good.  I used the Bill Echols seasoning mix that the submitter supplied in her review.  I also used chicken broth instead of beer.  My only criticism is that it called for way too much chicken.  Next time, I'll only use 2 or 3 breast HALVES.  The suggested toppings of avacado, sour cream, cheddar cheese and corn chips were good.  I served this with Grandma's Buttermilk Corn Bread, also from this site.

comment about recipe if I said add 2 oz of spice, you would say what kind of spice,  Add beer elicits the response, what kind of beer?
Or better still you could say Bud Which everyone knows is made from rice(water, rice, etc from bottle) and therefore a Sake beer.  I will
use one of the Mexican dark beers(Neagra Modelo) spelling my phonetic probably wrong..

This soup is now a favourite with me and my husband. I however only added a 14.5oz can of tomatoes, not two 10oz cans. And I noticed someone saying to use a dark beer, I saw that at the last minute however, and had to use a normal one, but it was still delicious.  Id say the beer is must, you cant taste it at all. This recipe is perfect.

LOVE!!  I make this fairly regularly so I mix up a big batch of the seasoning mix and then just measure out one third cup for a double batch. To cut down on added salt I use low sodium canned products and substitute frozen corn for canned. Add some diced celery and carrots for a fresh crunch.

this was just ok....I was afraid the spices would be too dilute when I substituted chicken stock for the beer and then added MORE stock to cover the chicken tenderloins I used. WRONG!! it was quite spicy with the Bill Echols taco seasoning I used, the red pepper and chili powder (and the 2 cans of tomatoes with green chilies?) overpowering everything else,not what I was hoping for. and this was using an extra can of black beans. I rinsed all the canned beans..and used frozen corn instead of canned. once I added sour cream and grated cheddar to the soup it helped, but it really just tasted like chicken chili. Maybe a little less red pepper flakes and using canned tomatoes WITHOUT the green chilis might make it more palatable for my tastes. definitely not a soup for kids,way too spicy.

The dish was fine, but a bit bland.  I noted that  the recipe does not call for seasoning, so after tasting it, I added taco seasoning and some salt and pepper, which helped.  The dish is full of good foods and the beans I used were beans I had frozen.  I cook  up a bunch of raw beans of different varieties and freeze them for dishes such as this soup.

Absolutely wonderful. Reminded me of a soup my parents used to make me.

I made this soup on the stove top rather than a slow cooker. I sweated the onions in the bottom of the pot with some olive oil, then added all the rest of ingredients as indicated (including the liquid from the diced tomatoes). Added the chicken breasts whole, brought to a boil, then reduced to a low simmer with a lid on for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I then removed the chicken and shredded it using two forks, and it was incredibly moist and tender.

For beer we used an Extra Pale Ale (Rolling Rock). The spice mix indicated for Bill Echols Taco Seasoning (posted by RaisinKane aka Patti) was incredible, and really made the recipe. Will 100% make again!

Absolutely Incredible!!! I used the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe.  I only did a few small modifications; 50% less salt Corn, Roasted Garlic Tomato sauce, Black Beans with jalapenos & a can of light beer.  I added 2 Large Chicken breasts and it was enough.  FANTASTIC!!!

Absolutely delicious!!! I used the recipe for Bill Echols Taco Seasoning and omitted the beer. The one thing I would change is the amount of red pepper flakes. 1/4 teaspoon was way too hot for me and I couldn't serve it to my daughter. Maybe just a dash would be sufficient. Thank you for this recipe. I can't wait to make this again.

I made this soup last week and it is deeelicious! I substituted some corn starch for the tomato sauce for some heartburn relief and to keep it thick, and it was still a great recipe!

This so was good I can't get over it!  The only thing I modified was using a bottle of Stella Artois (a Belgian Lager) and my own DIY taco seasoning.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a HUGE hit. Perfect for those cold winter days - or when you're just feeling lazy. This is really more of a chili...especially when you omit the beer. Lots of flavor and taste! I followed the top suggestions:

--Use hot chili beans
--Put the chicken in raw, shred after 5-6 hours
--Skip the beer
--For the taco seasoning, make your own:
Bill Echols Taco Seasoning: 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper

My 9 year old said I should make this soup every week. We all (husband & 3 sons)  LOVED it! I made a couple changes but they in no way changed the integrity of the recipe. We don't keep beer in the house so I used an entire container of chicken stock. I used canned chicken (so yummy!) and just added it to the soup for the last 15 min to heat it through. I wanted it to be more soupy so we could sop it up with our cheddar biscuits so I added extra tomato sauce. I buy taco seasoning in a large container instead of the taco packets - so I just eyeballed it.  I used Rotel tomatoes. ALWAYS USE ROTEL in my Mexican recipes. I put all the left overs into a 3 pint mason jar filled to the top. By evening - - when we usually get popcorn or a bowl of ice cream - everyone got more soup. The was barely any soup left. Will make this again and again! thank you Patti!!

The ONLY thing I would do differently...is add salt!  THAT'S IT!  I followed the recipe exactly like it says...but cooked it on low a little longer because I was at work all day. I used a very light beer, since that was all I had, and would probably use a stronger one next time.  HOWEVER...we could still taste the hint of the beer flavor and loved it! Those saying they couldn't taste it...must not recognize it like we do.  ;-)  It's good...and my biggest critic...husband...loved it!

OH MY GOODNESS, a wonderful, easy, GREAT tasting meal! I paired this with a superb grilled corn, tomato, red onion, basil, cilantro salad, so I omitted the can of corn for the recipe--it was a HIT. Adding 1 can of diced green chilis, about a 1/2 T of Mexican oregano, 2 t of cumin, and a sparse T of sugar (to cut the acid in 1 can of tomatoes w/green chilis), I topped the soup with fat free sour cream, grated colby-jack, and crushed tortilla chips. This is in my recipe box FOREVER!

I found this soup to be delicious and easy to make. I used Sam Adams Summer Ale and it gave the soup a delicious flavor that wasn't too "beery." I also just used a regular taco seasoning packet. I did add some salt and pepper. My kids LOVED this, and my son doesn't even like beans, but he ate it all up. I highly suggest NOT leaving out the beer. As someone else said, just use the right kind. Cheap beer, which is not full bodied, will not give it a good flavor.

I would not call this a soup, I like my soup a little more broth-y...With that being said this may be my new favorite CHILI though!! I followed the recipe exactly except I left out corn (didn't have it, I'm not a huge corn person, but it would make this dish look even more amazing then it is) also i accidentally drained my chili (kidney?)beans, maybe this is why it wasn't liquidy. Made some for now and to freeze, but already taken more out of the freezer. Amazing recipe and easy!

This was really good, but I did adjust it a little based only on what I had on hand.  Thankfully, I had most of what I needed, and that makes this a great go-to recipe.

I only used one can of black beans, drained and rinsed, no other beans.  I used a 10 oz can of tomatoes and a 14.5 oz can since that's the closest I had.  I also used roughly 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the beer.  Everything else was the same, and it turned out really good.

I cooked it about 4.5 hrs on high, and that was fine.  I can see me making this again in the future since it was so easy and good.

Excellent! Use the original posters recommended Taco Seasoning:

Bill Echols Taco Seasoning. It really makes this recipe. 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper

Delicious and loved by all! Made as directed and w/Bill Echols seasoning. Used a Corona light beer. Soup had no beer taste whatsoever. Might change up the liquid/chicken ratio next time.  Seemed to have too much chicken and not enough broth to me.

Since this was a late in the day afterthought, I made this in a pot on top of the stove and it turned out great. Super easy. I cut the breasts up in small chunks and sauteed them with onion and crushed garlic, then added the rest of the ingredients.  Delicious!

Made three batches of this soup in the last couple of weeks.  It's just my wife and me but we ate the first batch in a very short time.  We made no changes in recipe. Don't worry about the time too much, the longer it cooks in the crook pot the better it gets. Second batch we ate some of but froze most in serving sized portions for later and then made a fresh batch for a couple of friends that came over Sunday night for dinner. Served with corn chips,green onions, sour cream,and grated cheese on the side so they had their choice of toppings. Served with a green salad and some sliced avocados. What a hit.  We sent a large portion of what was left and the recipe home with our friends. Great recipe--thanks--Omar

This recipe was SO amazing that I actually created an account just to review it!  My boyfriend and I loved it - it's definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly but added garbanzo beans and did a 50/50 blend of beer and chicken broth (couldn't decide based on the reviews!).  

Oh, and to cut the time I made it on the stove with shredded ROTISSERIE chicken breast.  WOW!!!!  

Highly recommend.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Just a heads up, this recipe was way too big for my crockpot. Mix the first ingredients in a large stewing pot and use half for the soup  and put half into a freezeable container to make later!

I used hot chili beans, which boosted the spice factor in this already spicy soup. It was a little too spicy for my wife, but we both enjoyed it. I'll just need to remember not to add anything spicy to it the next time I prepare it. I used pre-cooked naked, grilled chicken tenders from Costco and sliced them diagonally and cooked it on my stove top. It turned out great.

I just cooked this on the stovetop. Cooked the chicken in olive oil, adding the onions, one clove of garlic, and the taco seasoning during cooking. Added all the other ingredients then, but used what I had around: one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, one 8 oz can tomato sauce, 8 oz of chicken broth, two cans tri-color beans. Also used Trader Joes "burnt corn" (frozen), one bag. Two large chicken breasts were enough.

This was delicious. I made a couple of additions: 1 teaspoon of onion powder and 1 teaspoon garlic powder when mixing all ingredients to start the cooking. Then after the step of breaking up the chicken, I added 1 tablespoon of lime juice before the final cooking. I topped with shredded mexican cheese, diced avocado and chopped cilantro.

OMG!  The kids went nuts over this recipe tonight.  Not sure if they were just extra hungry or what, but they all went back for seconds and rated it infinity stars. WOW!  I did not use beer, but chicken broth instead and added a splash of lime juice.  I put frozen chicken breasts right into the pot and they were ready for shredding after 8 hours on low. Also used frozen corn.  At the end I stirred in diced avocado.

UPDATE: I've been making this for years now.  I pack as many frozen chicken breast as I can fit in the crock pot.  The kids ask for it all the time AND it the ONLY thing my picky 4 year old eats entirely.  One week I doubled the recipe, and she ate the leftovers 5 days in a row and cried when it was gone!  We top with green onions, chips and shredded cheddar.

Originally I thought hmmm, smelled great cooking.  Dished out and added sour cream & cheese.  Looks really pretty.  Mix it and it looses that appeal.  Tasted EXCELLENT...  Never bring any home when I take it for a get together.  I make this now and freeze for quick dinners in the winter.....

This soup is incredible, I didn't change the recipe at all - apart from the corn, I only had frozen on hand.  I couldn't taste the beer at all, my guess is if you don't drink beer at all you may notice it, I just used a lager and I forgot it was even in it.  I also used the taco seasoning I recipe from this site as the poster suggests.

Made this for a couple of years now with great results everytime.  Love it as is however, so as not to grow tired of it (we make it a lot), I replace the chili and black beans with only white beans, add a jar of salsa, and mix sour cream into the soup.  For toppings we like cilantro and baked tortilla shells cut into strips.

Loved Loved Loved it!!! My husband loved it so much he ate the left overs a couple of days later and he never eats left overs. We also used the left overs for more of a dip by adding a lot of shredded cheese and sour cream it was really good too!!!

Made this for friends and what a hit, nice flavour, couldn't find tomatoes with chilis so I added jalapeno peppers and used fire roasted tomatoes.  Made double the recipe so it wouldn't fit in my slow cooker so low and slow on the stove top was just as good.  Used Tostitos Artisan Garlic and Black Bean flavoured chips and Tex Mex shredded cheese along with sour cream for toppings.

Truly a 10 star soup-I mean seriously seriously...I'm not the best cook in the world, but wow, this truly was a breakthrough for me and EVERYONE who I invited to eat it absolutely loved it!! Thank you so much for posting this...

On a side note though, I did add a clove of chopped garlic, a bit of cumin, and some fresh cilantro to the mix after following what others wrote on the reviews...so thank you all, you HAVE TO try it! First time I reviewed a recipe on Allrecipes.com so trust me, this is huge!

We love this soup. It is so thick and hearthy that its almost like a chili. I only used 1/2 of the beer the second time i made it and i liked it a lot better. Spreading the word about this simple, warm, tasty dish!

My picky eaters actually ate this, although I found it a tad too spicy.  I used to large chicken breasts cut into strips (not shredded) and made it on the stovetop. Omitted the beer, added chicken broth and water, garlic powder, salt, onion powder and cumin, with a touch of paprika.  Didn't have chili pepper so added 1/3 package of chili powder mix and a package of taco seasoning.  Had to keep adding water to take some of the spiciness out.  Served with Mexican blend cheese and nacho chips.  And lots of leftovers!

I made this just last week and I am picking up the items I need to make it again.  I only added about 1/3 of the onion and substitued chicken broth in the place of the beer.  Also, I'm not a big fan of tomatoes, so I nixed the can of those and instead added salsa that has corn, beans, and not so many chunks of tomatoes. Also, I added the chicken frozen and it turned out great!  Once it was cooked, topped with cheese and served with tortilla chips.

Absolutely exceptional!!! I personally added another chicken breast just for a little more meat but is wonderful otherwise. I find that you could add a little cajun seasoning instead of taco seasoning and have a nice Cajun style soup as well. When we did the Cajun version we also added sausage and it tasted wonderful. One to try and keep as a backup plan for those days when you aren't exactly sure what you want. Thanks for sharing RaisinKane

This is fantastic! The leftovers froze well.  I  followed another reviewer(Nov. 6/06 by Chicago Cook) for the leftovers. Both meals tasted wonderful and so easy to prepare. This recipe will be great in the RV too for those long days when you just want to relax.

This one really wowed me. I thought I would like it, but i wasn't sure about anybody else.  So I made a pot during a time when I knew my other family members had a busy week.  Well my husband tried it without my knowledge.  But I kept noticing the pot kept getting smaller.  Then he calls me from the road to ask if there would be any left for his supper.  He loved it.  This one is a keeper.  Thank you for this recipe

This soup is GREAT!!! I did as Patti suggested and used Bill Echols recipe and I brew my own beer so I used a 22oz bottle of English Mild Ale. It was definitely a soup but it was great!!!

This was a hit! I used packaged taco seasoning and was afraid it wouldn't be spicy enough for my liking so I added some ground cumin, red pepper flakes, chili powder, and cayenne and it was perfect! I also followed the advice of a couple of the previous reviews and used chicken broth instead of beer because I didn't have any on hand.  I will definitely make this again and I think next time I'll add a couple stalks of celery. 

My husband had 4 bowls of it then wrapped some up in a tortilla and ate it like a taco, I didn't try this but he said it was delicious.

You can't get any easier then this! I did two frozen chicken breasts and let it cook while I was at work all day, so about 9 hours and when I got home the house smelled Soooo good! We loved it with the chips, sour cream and cheese. I'm freezing the left overs and look forward to eating it again! Also I just used McCormick taco seasoning!

This is a delicious soup.  I always just add the sour cream into the soupl & stir until incorporated after it's finished cooking.  There is rarely a drop left.  It's great served with cheesy mexican cornbread :)

Very good.  I used a whole chicken and doubled the recipe.  Came out wonderful.  I used mild diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Gives it a great taste and not too hot.

This soup was mediocre at best. The only flavor you get is from the beer and I personally do not like beer so I did not care for it at all. Even my husband (who the beer belonged to) did not like this much. I made it exactly like the recipe, then when I did not like it, added more beans, corn, and chicken and salt, pepper, and cumin in an attempt to make it better. The upgraded version was better then the original, but still not great. I don't understand the high ratings on this. I joined the site to post otherwise.

Loved this. Quick, easy, and inexpensive.  I have little ones, so to cut down on spiciness, so i only used one can of tomatoes with green chiles, and I used petite diced tomatoes for the other can.  I also used beer with lime since it was a mexican dish.  gave it a great flavor.

Easy and excellent! I used original rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies and used the taco seasoning mix she recommended in the recipe.  I didn't change anything...

I made this tonight and o..m..g. So good. I didn't have the taco seasoning which I was really worried about. Instead I used a few tsps creole seasoning, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes and it was still amazing, flavorful, and spicy!! I only used 2 chicken breasts but it made a ton. I added the chicken frozen and cooked in the crock pot on high for 8 hours. It fell apart perfectly with a few turns with tongs. I also substituted chicken broth for beer like some other reviewers recommended. Will absolutely make again and again!!

Made last evening for my 10 year old son and I.  We both loved it.  I did throw in the tblsp of chili powder and a couple shakes of cayenne pepper as was suggested by someone else.

This was a wonderfully flavorful soup!  Even my hubby who usually isn't much of a taco soup lover (because of the "tomato-y" taste) raved about it.   It was a little bit spicy for my 3 year old, but I loved the little kick that it had!  I used a Shiner Bock beer and it gave it a really amazing taste.  Even if you're not a beer drinker, please make this at least once with the beer since it really gives this a unique taste.  This is the sixth "taco soup" recipe I have tried this winter and this recipe is the only one I will make again.   I did add about 1/4 cup of cilantro to the mix about 10 minutes before I served it.  If you are a vegetarian, you could leave out the chicken and it would still be delicious.   I topped it only with crushed blue tortilla chips.  Paired with a good asiago cheese bread and dinner was easy breezy!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was incredibly amazing. The only change to this recipe should be the removal of the word "optional" from the sour cream and cheddar cheese.

i liked the convenience and easy ingredients..quick and easy to prepare...i froze several containers small and medium, and plan to eat it lunch or dinner or even for a snack..used sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese ant tortillas.  so easy to shred the chicken and added back to the soup for the remainder of time..house smelled like i put a a lot of work into this...looked at other recipes of this kind and chose this one.  plan to poo\ur it over rice next time.

This was excellent.  I boiled and shredded the chicken before putting it in the slow cooker, and I cooked on low for about 5 hours and 45 minutes.

I doubled the recipe using 2 lbs. of boneless chicken breasts (it did almost overflow my 6 qt. crock pot!) to serve for Super Bowl Party.  Was a huge hit and freezes great.  The chicken shredded beautifully and made the soup really thick.  Also good over baked potatoes.

We loved this dish!  So easy to prepare!  I followed the recipe the first time I made this, but in the future would definitely add more beans--at least one more can--and some fresh diced green and red pepper.

We loved this recipe!  I cooked in crockpot all day as I was at work.  Tweaked a bit just based on other's recommendations: added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 4 T taco seasoning, 28 oz diced tomatoes instead of 20, and substituted chick broth for beer.  I wasn't sure if I should drain both cans of beans...went with draining black beans and keeping chili bean sauce.

First let me say my husband HATES chicken. To my suprise he went on and on how awesome this was. He even took some to work the next day. I was afraid it tasted bland when it was done but then I added some sour cream and crushed tortilla chips and WOW what a great great combo. You gotta try it once at least!

Easy, versatile recipe! I did make changes based on personal taste & what I had in the pantry. lol.

-Used green onion-subbed pinto beans for the black beans-subbed chicken broth for beer (we don't drink)-added a packet of ranch dressing mix-used only 1 can of tomatoes/chilies.

YUM! We loved this & will definitely make it again!

Loved this receipe!  I used regular diced tomatos and added a finey diced jalapeno pepper instead.  I also added a fourth chicken breast.  It came out thick like chili and it was amazing!

I love this soup!  I use chicken thighs instead of breasts, most of the time. I’ve used chicken breasts a few times and that’s good, too.  I just have a personal preference for thighs with crockpot recipes. I also use frozen sweet corn, because that’s what I normally have on hand.  The flavor of this soup is so rich and you can’t taste the beer, but it definitely adds to the flavor.  I serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips and sometimes chunks of avocado.

I enjoyed this soup but made a few changes after trying the recipe the first time.  I used a small whole chicken and poached it in the slow cooker over night the night before.  After easily striping all the meat I saved the broth and used that in the soup instead of beer or water. I liked to shreaded chicken better than the chucks of chicken I got when I used the breasts, and I haven't found a beer that complimented the flavor of the soup so I liked the chicken broth much better.   Also I went with one can of tomatoes and one small jar of salsa it added a great zip.

Sooo good.  I recommend spending an extra minute making your own taco seasoning (the Bill Echols one on this site as recommended in the reviews).  This is like chili meets tortilla soup.  Awesome.

I've wanted to try this recipe since I've seen it on here but never had.  I am so happy I did though.  It's awesome and delicious and can be tailored easily to your tastes.  I just threw everything in the crock and let it go.  My chicken was even frozen.  THanks!

I've made this many times to rave reviews.  I've done it strictly according to the recipe which is excellent.  I've also tweaked it over time so it suits our tastes - adding a package of dry ranch dressing mix as well as adding in a few chopped jalapenos to add a bit more spice.  I've used leftover cooked chicken and once even used canned chicken just to get rid of it.  I throw it in the crock pot on low before leaving for work and come home to a great smelling house.   For ease of preparation and return on your effort, this can't be beat.

This was excellent! I did add a small can of tomato paste because I like it thick and I also added a package of chicken sausage. I used 2 packets of taco seasoning and a tbsp of cumin and 2 tbsp of sugar. Will definitely make again!

This is a very good soup that I think is almost identical to Chicken Tortilla soup.  I made it with chicken broth instead of beer, and squirted in a generous amount of lime juice. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I offered chopped cilantro, shredded cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips were offered as toppings.  Very delicious and everyone loved it!

Delicious!  I omitted the 2nd can of Rotel and no one noticed!  It had more than enough with one can.  I've also made this using chicken stock instead of beer and it's just as good!

Almost like a chicken chili. The best thing was I was able to substitute stuff I had (e.g. 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes + small can of mild green chiles for the 2 10 oz. cans of tomatoes + 8 oz. can of tomato sauce) for stuff in the recipe. Also used can of chicken broth instead of beer and pinto instead of chili beans. This was a HUGE hit.

This soup was a hit with my entire family, and I have been informed that I need to make it again next year for out Christmas Eve dinner.  I did not care for the strong flavor of the beer I used, but that could just be me or the beer (I used Foster's Lager).  Next time I make it, I will try substituting chicken stock for beer, and see how that goes.

I made this as written.  It was a huge hit at our department lunch.  Everyone asked for the recipe!  It was just a little kick but not too spicy.
****addendum*** Almost everyone I gave the recipe to has made it as well and families all loved it.  A few people have put crushed fritos on top and that is the new favorite topping!

Excellent!  And easily made!!  I added some corn starch and flour as thickeners as well as a cup of sour cream. My family loves it, though I will decrease the spicyness next time because we are wusses when it comes to hot-spicy foods.

Good, but I put in Bill Echols Taco Seasoning instead of the taco seasoning packet, and it was just too spicy for me. If you are concerned at all about the heat, go with the mild seasoning packet.

Delicious and super simple. I also noted the bitter beer flavour and added 2 TBS of brown sugar. I added it at the beginning tho, so it could be that the bitterness would cook out eventually. My only tweaks -  I used fresh tomatoes (4 vine) and cut up 6 jalapenos. I'll definitely add this recipe to my regular rotation.

I made this exactly as written and it is delicious! Made it a second time and substituted the beer for a can of low sodium chicken broth; added some diced green bell pepper; a few shakes of cumin; 2 oz taco seasoning packet; and a few shakes of cayenne. This is definitely on my rotation now! Can't beat taking 5 minutes to throw some food in a crock pot before work to eat like a king when you get home :)

I can't give this a true rating because I didn't have all of the ingredients, so my rating is for tonight's soup. I only used one can of the diced tomatoes with chilies. I used creamed corn instead of whole kernel (but that was fine), a large (15 oz) can of tomato sauce, and I made the Taco Seasoning that you suggested. While the soup was cooking, I was pretty convinced that I wasn't going to be happy with the results. When I tasted it, it seemed way too spicy. In an effort to cut the spice, I added some homemade chicken stock and about 1/2 cup of sour cream. However, once on the table, with saltines and shredded cheddar, the soup was perfect! Even my picky, very UN-spice-loving son raved about it! I will be making this again!

Husband said "hearty", I said "Yum", 2 kids (3 and 4) said "Eeww". 2 out of 4 ain't bad, but it really was FANTASTIC! The only thing I changes was adding a few cilantro leaves while stewing.

I make this with chicken broth instead of beer, and one can of tomatoes with chilis, (adding a an of crushed tomatoes instead) and my family love it.  Make it often when it's chilly outside or just when I need a no fuss, yummy dinner.  We grate sharp cheddar cheese for a topping and serve with corn chips.  I'm making it again today!

We love this recipe!  My modifications:
I use all black beans (2 or 3 cans).  I use 1 can plain diced tomatoes, 1 can diced tomatoes with CHIPOTLE chilies in it, one can of tomato sauce, and one small can of diced green chilies.  (the chipotle chilies add an awesome flavor!)  I use 2 or 3 tablespoons of taco seasoning from a bulk container.  I use half chicken breast and half chicken thigh meat for added flavor and a different texture (thigh meat is cheaper too).  Of course the corn and onion are the same.  Finally, I use water or sparkling mineral water instead of beer (enough to fill the large slow cooker up to 1/2 inch from the top so it won't spill when simmering). 

I love to put crushed tortilla chips on the bottom of the bowl and a little shredded mexican cheese blend on top.  YUM!!!

*The best modification is the Chipotle chilies - if you can get just a little chipotle chilies in the recipe somehow I DEFINITELY recommend it!

Oh man was this delicious!  I used fresh corn, jalapenos and tomatoes.  I used two chicken breasts, a can of Bud Light, Chicken Stock and cooked it for 5.5 hours on high.  I skipped the crushed tomatoes because I didn't have them, didn't need them either.  Even the kiddos loved this.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

I made this exactly as written using lite beer and it turned out great!  I was hesitant about the beer, but I couldn’t even tell it was in there.  My chicken breasts were on the small side but were perfectly cooked in five hours.  My batch yielded more like 10 servings, so I froze the leftovers for later.  I do think, as with many soups, the flavor is even better the next day.  Great recipe!

Great recipe! I obtained a full bag of eclectic chip crumbs after a church social and stumbled upon the recipe. Sine I live in New Mexico I used some freshly roasted green chile I had on hand instead of the diced tomato with green chile, and I used a bag of frozen corn instead of canned corn. I also used only one large chicken breast. (Since we try to keep our grocery budget under 50 every week). It came out as a nice hearty soup with plenty of chicken. This is my new go-to recipe whenever I have chip crumbs.

This recipe is so EASY, CHEAP and YUMMY!! I made it with the beer, and I don't agree with everybody that said it had such a strong beer scent and flavor.  I used a light beer, and the house smelled terrific all day. There was a ton of food. The leftovers can be used atop a green salad, over a baked potato, in wraps (if drained well).  It's a very healthy southwest meal. I added a green pepper and used one can of original Rotel tomatoes and one can hot. It was just enough kick. I also added an extra chicken breast. I'd do it exactly the same next time, and I'll definitely be making this over and over.

This soup was pretty good and very easy to make. The beer gives it a nice flavor, so I wouldn't skip that ingredient! The recipe makes A LOT of soup, so I froze the leftovers to eat later.

Excellent and EASY! I followed the recipe with the only addition being a dash of garlic salt and cumin at the very end.  I also used frozen chicken and cooked it all 7 hours before trying to shred (I work nights and had gone to bed for the day) and it was perfect when I woke up. And yes, I used the beer, and I didn't have the bitter problem others had.

This is pretty much the same recipe I have been making for years except my recipe calls for one package of ranch dressing. I gave this recipe to a diabetic friend and he makes it all the time.

Awesome!

I love this.  I made it Saturday morning, so I will have it throughout the weekend.  Perfect combination of flavors and very hearty for a fall soup.  I used 1.5 packets of taco seasoning and bud light lime to add a hint of lime flavor.  Mmm so good and made the house smell so good as well!

Great recipe to build off from! I used a bottle of Sam Adams Octoberfest and some roasted chilies. Three chicken breasts was too much meat for our tastes so I separated the extra meat and it will be used for enchiladas.

I rarely rate a recipe 5 stars but this one deserves it.  The whole family inhaled this dish.  The beer adds a very nice dimension, but it would be ok without it.  This is a great recipe to play around with.  I didn't have much of the cumin called for in the taco seasoning but it was still great.  I cooked extra chicken, then shredded the extra and froze it for chicken fajitas on another day.

This recipe is awesome!  The whole family loved it and it is really easy.  I used Dos Equis Amber for beer and Bill Echols Taco Seasoning for spice.  I also added half a head of cabbage at the start of cooking.

This is a really hearty soup but I was expecting more flavor.  Next time I will use 1 can of mild and one can of spicy chilies with tomatoes.  I will also add 1 or 2 garlic cloves and some fresh cilantro.

So simple is this soup.  I love just pouring in cans and basically being done!  I need to cut back on the onion next time for my liking.  Also found it a tad spicy, just a warning in case you dont like any heat.

So easy my 19 year old was able to make it for the family.  What a wonderful dish.  We used chicken broth instead of beer and we may spice it up just a bit more the next time around.  This dish will make it to my recipe box and to family members for them to try.

This is wonderful on a chilly night.  I had left over fully cooked chicken, so I just chunked it up and added it for the last couple of hours.  I've also made it using browned ground beef and I once used some cut up hot sausage and served it with french bread for dipping.  Very adaptable recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

It was ok. I brought it to a scrapbooking day and nobody was that impressed. I did make the special taco seasoning that is suggested. You can definitely taste the background of the beer.

Very nice, easy recipe. I ended up using the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning as I don't find packaged taco seasoning very good, plus it's just too salty. I threw in some frozen corn and doubled the recipe. I also tossed in 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans as that's what i had on hand. Will make again.

I make this at least twice a month. Litterally takes less than 10 minutes to throw together. Follow recipe to a T. Lime beer adds a nice twist. Must have with the cheese, chips and sour cream. Even my picky kids gobble it up. I even use frozen chicken breasts and they work just fine.

I have made this many, many times.  We love it!  Instead of tomato sauce, I go to the local Mexican restaurant and buy their tomato base salsa.  WOW, it adds a very nice touch.  Try it.... you may like this soup even more.

Excellent recipe.  Used one can of Original Rotel, and one can of Mild Rotel.  Spicy enough for us....if you like more, use both cans of "Original".  Added some chopped green onions to the toppings.  Definitely a keeper.  Used Busch Light for the beer.  Would be interesting to try a bottle of Guinness, or maybe a good local porter.

AWESOME!!  We loved it!  The only thing I did a little different is I used a rotisserie chicken and I used two cans of beer to give it more liquid.  Wonderful recipe!

My husband and I have been making this regularly for over a year.  We absolutely love it.  He eats his with cheddar and I eat mine with sour cream added.  It has a wonderful flavor, and is fairly versatile.  you can add and subtract different veggies and it still tastes great!

This was really good and even better the next day. I had a turkey carcas in the freezer with quite a bit of meat left on it so I used that in place of the chicken breast.  I also used some frozen tomatoes from my greenhouse (last summer's) in place of one can of tomatoes.  Hubby loved it.

Really liked this soup.  I found it to be different than chili.  Very flavorful and great reheated. Only addition was a couple of shakes of chili powder and garlic powder.

I have made this three times and it is just wonderful. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and found that the beer didn't work for us. The next time I made this I used two cans of chicken broth and it came out just perfect!  Having just moved to the northeast I really appreciated a taste of the south. Great for a cold and snowy day!

This soup was awesome!!!  Very rich flavor, and the chicken was very tender.  Next time I will add some diced jalepenos or something to give it more of a kick, because we like spicy.

This soup is really good.  I used Rotel brand tomatos with chiles and it was pretty spicy.  If you don't like it so spicy you can use the mild version.

Was okay but, did not like the beer smell/taste (not big beer/alcohol people).  Tried Miller light draft.  Wonder if something else wood be better and less strong.

DELICIOUS!!!!  And so SUPER EASY!!!  I love this meal!  I didn't have chili beans, so I just added a can of northern beans, since that's what I had on hand.  I also used a spicy taco seasoning that made up for it.  I substituted the beer with chicken broth instead.  And I didn't have diced tomatoes with green chilies, so I just used plain diced tomatoes and added a can of diced green chilies.  I also just left everything in the crock pot until we were ready to eat.  The chicken fell apart easily as I stirred.  We enjoyed it with sour cream and cheddar cheese and crushed chips on the top!  Thanks for such a great recipe!  This definitely goes in my favorites.  :)

i would honestly give this recipe a 0 if i could. im sorry im being so blunt. but i am a good cook and i also follow recipes to the notch. this soup was just awful. it smelled and tasted like beer. i thought the alcohol would burn off but it did not. the meat was really tender. but overall i am scared to make this again. we had to go eat out after finding that the soup tasted really bad. i used Heineken beer.

Did not like the flavor because of the beer.  I used Golden Wheat beer & it was much too strong!!  I followed the recipe exactly...Hopefully, without the beer it could have good flavor.

I took this to a church potluck dinner, and didn't come home with any.  It was a huge hit.  I didn't use the beer, only chicken broth, and I increased the amount of corn and beans, and added red, green and yellow bell peppers. It was wonderful.  Slightly spicy, but very nice.

I didn't have chili beans so I used Red Kidney Beans. I also substituted Chicken Broth instead of the beer. Used 2 cans of chicken breast because I didn't have time to cook the chicken. Set on high for 5.5 hours and it was fantastic. 

I added Cumin, Garlic and Chili powder as others suggested. Very good and this will be a regular meal in our house!!

This was really good! I used boneless thighs instead of breasts, kidney beans instead of chili beans, and two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes with chilis. I added a Sam Adams Cream Stout for the beer. I also used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning as suggested. Garnished it with shredded cheddar, sour cream, cilantro and fried white corn tortilla strips. Will definitely be making this again.******

Second time I made this I followed the original recipe except I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes and this time I used Yuengling Lager - excellent!

Not very good.  I did use the beer but it had a very odd flavor.  Definitely will not make again.  I think the garbage disposal liked it more than I.

Great recipe! I tweaked the recipe as I always do and made it my own. This is an easy dish to make and also to make 'your own'. So many things you can add or take away. Like many of you I chose two 14oz cans of broth over the beer. I also used pinto beans & kidney beans instead of what the recipe said. I also added Yukon Gold potatoes (cubed), chopped carrots, grean beans, plus the kernal corn, etc. and left out the white onion. I'll use peas the next time. You can add or remove most anything! I used the entire package of Lawry's taco seasoning and added 1/2 tsp of cumin, good dash of pepper, & 2 tbsp chili powder. I may have even done a couple of other things but can't remember as I just create as I go along. I cooked on high for 6 hours and the chicken breasts fell apart on their own in the crock. Then cooked another 2 hours. For the garnish I had sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions & topped with tortilla strips. I served garlic bread for dipping on the side. I got that idea from a restaraunt that made an amazing tortilla soup which is basically what I considored this to be. My husband loved it and it's a keeper! Thank You Patti for the recipe!

I loved this one! I did however change it just a tad. Instead of the beer I used about 2 cups of chicken broth. I also added cumin seeds, garlic & cilantro. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. I topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, chopped green onions & chives & sliced avocado. Yum!

I have this in the crockpot now, waiting for my husband to get home for dinner.  I can't stop sneaking spoonfuls.  It is amazing!  I'm sure it'll be even better with the crushed tortillas and cheese on top.  I did use chicken broth instead of beer, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Yum!

Probably the best chili I have ever had! Dont skip the beer it makes it. I have made it several times and find that the mass market beer (I have used micro brews) works best. I also add a can of drained and rinsed pinto beans.

Great, diet friendly and hearty.  Add brown rice if your looking for something more substantial.   Freezes well too.

I like this recipe, I agree with the chicken stock subsitute. First, I warmed in my pot about 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Next, I threw in about four tablespoons of flour and let them work together for abour five min. on med-high heat. Then I put in my onions and let cook down for another 5 min. This adds a little more texture to the soup by the time it is ready to serve. Oh yeah, just use Rotel instead of diced green chilis and 2 chicken halves (placed in your pot for about 5 hours and then debone, and take the skin off and chop it) instead of boneless chicken, adds flavor.

Made this soup for the second time last night. Slow cooker recipes are the best and this one is definitely at the top of my list. I love how easy it is! It's also super healthy... low fat, full of fiber - which makes it super filling. We just top it with a little bit of fat free sour cream, mozzarella cheese, crushed tortilla chips, cilantro and a little avacado... Delish! Even better the next day!!!

Easy, delicious. What more can you ask for?  Followed the recipe exactly, though I wasn't sure if I should really use 3 WHOLE boneless breast (vs. HALF). So, I used about 3.5 HALVES and there was plenty of chicken.

I reduced my chicken down to two breasts and used my own, home-made taco seasoning.  We have a family member on a lower-sodium diet, so this taco seasoning helps cut that down.  2 T Chili Powder, 1.5 T ground Cumin, 1 T dried Oregano, 1 T ground Coriander, 1.5 tsp Garlic Powder and 1/4 tsp Ground Red Pepper.  This can also be used by placing that amount with 1/2 cup water for each pound of ground beef.  Great flavor and soooooo easy!!

This was delicious. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and put my chicken breasts in frozen, then let it cook for 9 hours. The chicken pretty much fell apart. I put cheese on it, but my husband didn't. We both liked it, which is good because it made a lot. My kids liked it too even though it was a little spicy.

My boyfriend and I love spicy so I too used "fiesta corn". I also used HOT taco seasoning and it did not need anymore seasonings in my opinion. I didn't add any garlic or anything and it was really flavorful. This was awesome. I'll be making it again for sure!

one of the best things i've ever made!!! it is absolutely delicious and couldn't be easier! i made a few slight changes: i used kidney beans instead of the chili beans (only because that's what i had on hand), frozen corn instead of canned, and half a can of beer instead of the whole can. i topped the soup with the toppings suggested, as well as diced avocado and cilantro. perfection!

This was very tasty.  I used frozen chicken breasts which helped decrease the mushiness in texture that you can sometimes get when you use a crock pot for cooking chicken all day long.  I did also use a can of chicken broth instead of beer.  I will make this again.  Mmmm.

Excellent! I was so proud of myself for pulling this off with just throwing together stuff that I already had on hand. I did use left over roast chicken instead, omitted one can of the Rotel tomatoes w/chilies, replaced beer with 1 14oz can of chicken broth and replaced black beans with pinto beans.  I also threw in 2 T. of my Garlic Garlic seasoning (from Tastefully Simple).  Instead of the crock pot, I sauteed my onions in my dutch oven for about 8 minutes on medium, then added remaining ingredients...kept on low for 4 hours on the stove and it was PERFECT.  The sour cream/cheese/crumbled tortilla chips on top is the perfect compliment.  Everyone in the house loved it...even my picky kids...AND PICKY HUBBY!!!

Awesome awesome!!!I just bought my first crock pot and I don't think that I could have picked a better recipe to break it in with. I did make some little changes, like substituting chicken broth for the beer, adding garlic powder, chili powder and cumin. I cooked the soup for 10 hours because I was working and it was perfect, perfect! I am definitely going to make this again and many times over.

I make this soup often and even for parties.  It is always a hit.  When it is just for the family I only use a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning just because that isn't my favorite flavoring.  Sour cream and crushed tortilla chips on top makes it even better!!!

Great recipe!! I used the Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe as recommended by the author. The only change I made was that I cooked the soup on high for 1/2 the amount of time due to time constraints, but it was still delicious. I served it to the hubby with light sour cream, grated cheddar cheese and crushed Fritos. We really enjoyed the way the beer flavored the soup. The recipe was large enough that I could freeze the leftovers for a future meal.

Absolutely delicious!!! The whole family enjoyed this soup--even the young ones. I served it with homemade corn bread on the side. I did not have black beans, so instead used kidney beans. I also did not have canned corn, but did have frozen corn as the substitute. It would have been delicious with a fresh cilantro garnish, but we didn't have that either. I will definitely be making this one again and again.  A delicious, warm, comfort food!!

This soup just won the "soup off" contest where I work. It competed against 6 other soups, some of them absolutely fantastic. I was shocked that I won. I have made this soup twice, each time a little different and each time, it came out great. The first time, I had no idea how much of Bill's taco seasoning would equal a package of taco seasoning. I dumped all of it in as I saw someone mention that they used 4 tablespoons of Bill’s seasoning. Well, I had to put in a lot of extra canned tomatoes, broth and rotel to counter act it. The second time I added the taco seasoning 1/2 teaspoon at a time until it was just right. I think I put in 3 to 4 teaspoons (and I did not add the crushed red pepper in his recipe.) I played it safe spice wise as I was cooking for a crowd. The one thing I can say is that you can't go off how it tastes as you are cooking it. The flavor and spices blend together in the end and taste really smooth and fantastic!

This was my first time making a taco soup and it really was tasty! The only thing I would change is maybe put only 6 oz of beer and then 6 oz of chicken broth. The beer taste was still pretty potent. It gave it a great flavor but the first thing I would notice with each bite was the beer flavor.

Great soup for a cold winter night! I followed the recipe exactly and found that it has some heat using "original" variety of Rotel. You could use mild variety Rotel to tame it a little. Pass bottled hot sauce at the table for those who like more heat. I loved, lovedd the ease of this recipe. I assembled it the night before and stuck it in the frig. In the morning, I just pulled it out of the frig, set it on low and let it go. Dinner ready when we got home! Love that! I made some cornbread to go with it. This recipe made a thick, hearty stew. Add some chicken broth if you are looking for a thinner, more soupy soup.

Our family loves this soup! So easy, and so delicious. I usually add a can of cream of chicken soup to make it a creamier base (I use chicken broth rather than beer, too) but you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Excellent.  I took to work and shared w/ co-workers and was told anytime I want to bring this again is A-okay with them.  I used boneless breasts and broth instead of beer. I had to sub pinto beans for the chili beans and tomatoe soup in place of tomatoe sauce.

This is so easy, and super hearty for a soup! We were out of black beans, so I just omitted them. I Also have an onion disliker, so I just used onion powder. I am pregnant, so I omitted the beer, even though I am sure it would have cooked out. I added about a 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro and water to make up for the lack of beer. It is so yummy and a perfect treat on a cold day! We only had frozen chicken, so I turned it on high for the first 4 hours, and it came out fine.

I didn't get this in until after lunch, so I cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hrs. instead of low for 7. I wasn't home in the middle to cut up the chicken but it wasn't needed. When I did get home at dinner time the chicken literally fell apart, I just pulled it apart with a couple of forks to shred it without even taking it out of the slow cooker. We ate it right away and it was excellent so I feel safe to say this doesn't need to be a two part recipe.

A very affordable meal that tastes GREAT! To save even more time, I used two cans of precooked chicken and cooked on high for 3 hours. I used chicken broth instead of beer (did try it once and didn't care fore it), the recommended taco seasoning from this site (AWESOME!!!) and also added a bag of frozen 3 pepper & onion mix instead of the chopped onion. This gave the soup more substance, and was even QUICKER to make!

I simply couldn't wait to review this recipe! It is FABULOUS!!! A must try! All of the flavors blend together perfectly. It is very filling. I doubled the recipe and it made enough for nearly 20 people.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. : ) I followed the recipe as written, which I normally do, when first trying a recipe...I wouldn't change a thing! I did take the advise of the author and used the taco seasoning recipe from another submission on this site. WONDERFUL!!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe, it is a keeper in my house!!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it was so easy and I had no leftovers. Everyone wanted seconds. I read all the other reviews first, and added cumin and garlic. Also, I used double black beans and chicken broth. I thought shredding the chicken would be hard, but it just fell apart. Great recipe, especially for a beginner like me!

Loved this!  I used Navy beans and White Northern because its our prefrence.  I loved it!  My kids found it a tad bit spicy so I will add 1/2 pack of taco seasoning next time for their sake.  I used frozen corn and a large 15 oz can of tomato sauce because it was what we had.  Next time I will also add a can of chicken broth just because it was so thick and I like it soupy.  Fantastic recipe!

If you are not a beer lover, like myself, you WILL be able to taste the beer in this.  I highly recommend a high quality beer because the flavor infuses throughout the soup.  I fixed it a second time with chicken stock and it was much better.  I did not like it at all with the beer and my kids hated it...my husband, being a beer lover, did like it. Edited 9/2014:  I have now made this soup lots of times.  It is my go to recipe for taco soup.  I always add chicken stock instead of the beer and my own homemade taco seasoning.  I get tons of compliments, but the taco seasoning that I make is much more flavorful than store bought which gives it an extra kick.  Everyone raves about this dish when I take it to potlucks.

Good and filling.  Don't forget to top it with tortilla chips, salsa, a little bit of shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.  It's so quick and easy to make!

Very good!  I use chicken broth in place of beer, and cut the tomatoes to one can, since my family is not a big fan.  I also replaced the onion with dried onion flakes, to make it more child friendly.  Love serving it with sour cream, avocado,cheese and tortilla chips!

My family and I loved this recipe. I made a bigger batch because I had larger cans of some of the ingredients and I also used chicken broth instead of beer, put the chicken in frozen and added a few more seasonings but I think if I followed it as is it would have still been incredible.

This was so easy and delicious!  I think the taco seasoning is the secret... I added a little extra due to previous comments, but I don't know if that was necessary.  Other changes: I used about 8 chicken strips instead of breasts, two cans black beans only (had them on hand), added about 1/4 c. pickled jalapenos, substituted 1 c. vegetable stock for beer (sadly, no brewski in the fridge), and cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours.  Just don't forget to drain and rinse the beans before adding them... it makes a big difference in my opinion.  The chicken was indeed tender enough to break up with a ladle at the end while just stirring the soup.  This is a keeper recipe for my new slow cooker!

It was ok, I hated the beer taste of it, kinda tasted weird and I love beer. I just thought if I made this I might as well make chili cause that was the taste I got from it. Sorry just not a fan! Ive had better.

I made this recipe twice with and without the beer and it is delicious either way but I did like the flavor that my Newcastle gave it. I don't do the slow cooker though. I precooked my chicken while everything else was cooikng and then shredded the chicken and added it to the crockpot and only had to cook for a couple of hours....YUMMY!

I have made this 4 times and love it. I haven't used beer (hubby would kill me if I "wasted" a beer in food) so I have been using chicken stock. I use the Bill Echol's taco seasoning recipe (but reduce the Cumin by half subsequent times as my family isn't a big fan of that spice). I have tried it with a few different bean combinations and I think the best is a can of black beans and a can of mixed beans (red kidney, garbanzo, black eyed peas and romano beans). Hubby wanted it to be thicker, like chili instead of soup, so the last time I substituted the tomato sauce with tomato paste and drained the beans half-way to reduce the liquid and it worked well. We serve with sour cream, fresh cilantro and Old Dutch Sea Salt & Lime tortilla scoop chips and it is fantastic! This is my favourite slow cooker recipe.

Sadly, I make a lot of recipes from this site, and have never made something that was rated so highly that I didn't like, but I just did not care for this. I think it was the beer (I used Bud Light). It seems many others have substituted chicken or veg. broth, which I should have done. It looks so good in the pic, and I followed the recipe exactly, but it just did not turn out. :(

I, like others, was hesitant on the beer in the recipe but no hesitation now. I typically like the brothy tortilla soup and this has less broth and still so flavorfull! I used trader joes frozen corn because to me it tastes like fresh corn, added juice of 1 lime, 3 chopped tomatoes and added cilantro. I also used the seasoning mix suggested by the submitter (under highest rated reviews) and it makes a HUGE difference. Packaged taco seasoning is overwhelming and I rarely use. Thanks for the soup recipe and the taco seasoning recipe!

Very yummy.  Couple substitutes: garbanzo beans instead of corn; beef broth instead of beer; and Penzey's taco seasoning instead of a packet.

We loved this recipe!  Very easy to make.  I did make a couple of small alterations.  I left out the onion.  I just didn't have the time to chop it up and we couldn't tell it was missing anything.  I also substituted kidney beans for the black beans because I'm not a big lover of the black bean.  Other wise, I prepared exactly as instructed.  It was out of this world!  My husband said it was like eating chicken chili.  The recipe makes a lot so we froze the leftovers.

This is a great recipe. I left out the beer and tomatoe paste. The chicken makes its own broth and I added Jalopena peppers. I make this all the time and every one loves it.

I have made this three times so far, and there's currently a bowl of it sitting next to me while I write this. Simply put, it's delicious. The only thing I subbed was using a combination can of diced tomatoes and chilies, rather than purchasing those ingredients separately. And when I don't have a beer around, I'll use water, and it turns out just the same. Put this over rice, eat it with crackers, tortilla strips, or as a twist on the Frito pie, as I'm doing right now. I'm in LOVE with this recipe.

Not bad, very easy to make.  I used hard beans (soaked for the night) and apple cider instead of beer.  Healthy, too.  Not five stars because, frankly, its just nothing phenomenal.  I feel I need to spice it up a little more.

This is a really good recipe. Since I don't buy Taco seasoning, I added my own version which is eerily similar to Bill Echols. I also opted  for a Summer Shanty Ale for the beer part and it added a nice tang. Put everything in the crockpot at lunch on high until I got home at 5 and then shredded the chicken, and turned it to low for another hour. Topped with favorites like sour cream, shredded cheese, green onion, avocado and fresh cilantro-My family devoured it.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I actually made it exactly like the recipe which is unusual for me but I liked it.  I think it needed something though, and I haven't figured out what it needed...but we will make it again.  Oh, I did use the taco seasoning recipe on this site and it was FABULOUS...definitely try that recipe!  Thanks for a good one...will try it again to figure out what it needs....Oh...you know what.  I did do something different.  My family doesn't drink beer or cook with it so I used chicken broth instead.  But it was still good.

Next time I will exchange the beer for chicken stock and saute the onions before adding to the crock pot.  I also adding more taco seasoning. The flavor was good but i'm sure it would have been better without the beer because like some others have said the beer gave it a weird taste.   Overall I will make again.

This recipe ROCKS!  I have made it twice already and love taking the left-overs for lunches.  The shredded chicken makes it so hearty!  And since most of the other ingredients are in cans, it is very simple to throw together before a busy day.  Enjoy!

Absolutely wonderful-- I am always on the look out for good crock pot recipes, since they are so easy to make, and this is by far one of the best!  We used store bought taco seasoning and substituted chicken broth for the beer, topped with shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips- perfect!

3 out of 3 of us rated this 5 stars!  Put this together in 15 mins. and when we ate it, it tasted like it could have taken hours to make.  I left everything exactly as written and wanted to make that homemade taco seasoning that the reviewer said but i just didn't have the time.  after dishing this up, i put crunched up tortilla chips in, shredded extra sharp cheddar and a big dollop of sour cream.  Made a batch of corn bread and we were in heaven.  Having for lunch today!  will make this often and use the beer, it's wonderful!

This was excellent. I was not very confident about this recipe initially because it was my first crockpot endeavor and most of the ingredients are canned, which made me fear that this was going to taste like canned soup.  I also used packaged taco mix and frozen chicken breasts in this recipe.  It was fast enough for me to put together between school and work (20 minutes to eat lunch and prepare dinner) and when I got home from work, the entire apartment smelled like delicious chili.  I served it with tortilla chips and homemade guacamole and it was fabulous.  My boyfriend liked it, too, so it is definitely going into the rotation.  Perfect for a rainy day in Seattle, but I can see it shining as a summer potluck chili, too.

Fabulous recipe and a bit more sophisticated than some of the other taco soups. One caveat: Beware the chilies in the diced tomatoes. I bought some that were so spicy it wrecked it for me. I like some mild heat but this was over the top. My husband liked it but make sure it's a brand you've used before!

One of our favorite soups.  I made it many times and adjust it with what I have in my pantry.  I always use Bill Erohls taco seasoning recipe.  I mainly use black beans-drained and canned or frozen corn, Rotel and diced tomatoes and chicken broth vs. beer.  I like the taste better with broth than beer.  I surround the crock pot with bowls of chopped cilantro, cheese, sour cream, chopped green onion and BBQ Frito's.  My family tops the soup with their fave combo's.  All my family and friends have asked and make this soup on a regular basis.  So very, very good and easy. Great for parties.  Cheap to make too.  I have used frozen chicken- breasts or tenders. Whatever I have on hand....dump and go.  Come home to a house filled with the smell of this soup.  MMM. Yum!

Patti, I am soo sorry, my Carlos only gave this 9 1/2 stars! Now I Finally know why everyone LOVES this soup! I added lime juice from my own tree, to the top of this along with the sour cream,cilantro,green onion, tomato, avocado. I had some Fritos and put those on as well.I was at home today and did this on the stove, on low, all afternoon. I kept tasting it and the seasonings were just right. I knew it was going to knock the families socks off. It did:) Thank You so much Patti. Patty

Pretty bland without the changes suggested by the other users. Even with them, doubt I'll make it again. It just tasted like a regular old soup, nothing special to recommend it.

Awesome soup! I used a regular packet of taco seasoning (as opposed to the Bill Echols) as I didn't thoroughly read through reviews with a screaming, hungry baby at home, but it did turn out fantastic. I used a pumpkin ale for the beer since no one liked to actually drink it (didn't want it to go to waste), and it worked nicely- couldn't even taste that there was beer in there. I also used frozen corn simply because that's what I had. Aside from the bit I put aside for my daughter's lunch tomorrow, my family finished this off! Definitely will make again, thanks!

I'm not sure if I did it wrong, or if it's just not for me.  The beer flavor was too strong and it was kind of boring.  I don't think I'll make it again.  Darn, I had high hopes.

I have made this for about 3 years now after finding it on this site.  Every time I make it I am asked to pass on the recipe.  It's incredibly easy and soooo good.  I have made with chicken stock instead of beer but it's not as good.  Beer makes it!  I have taken the advice of others and added 1 pack of ranch dressing mix and about a teaspoon of cumin.  I always double it beacause it freezes well.  This is a KEEPER!!!

This soup is really excellent!  I am only giving 4 stars because it can taste like chicken chili.  My way to get around this is to eliminate the chili beans and just use plain pinto beans.  Also I use 2 packages of taco seasoning or the equivalent of that in regular spices.  This is a crock pot absolutely full of ingredients.  It needs a lot of seasoning.  This makes the soup really taste like taco soup not chili.  The toppings of tortilla chips and sour cream is a must.  Awesome comfort food.

The easiest, best dinner I make according to my 3 teenagers.  I use chicken broth instead of beer-I think the beer makes the broth too yeasty-tasting.

I made this for the first time today and LOVED it!  We added about 1/4 C of chopped Cilantro, 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup (to thicken), and used spicy chili beans along with the black beans.  Also, we used mildly spicy taco seasoning. Next time we'll make some sweet corn bread for the side!

I have made this recipe several times and this past time used 2 turkey loin cuts in place of chicken. Turned out perfect! This recipe is quick, has simple ingredients and is gives consistent results.

Delicious!  I made it almost exactly as written, except I was a little worried about the beer since some reviewers said it gave it a weird taste.  I only used 8oz of beer and the other 4oz I replaced with chicken stock.  I am sure it would have been just as delicious if I had left it alone.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I did the recipe exact except I used a can of red kidney beans instead of chili beans. This was great! So easy to prepare. I even put my chicken breasts in frozen. A hearty soup that'll fill you up. Will be making this one again and again!

Great recipe for the crockpot, I just made this and I think it can also be enjoyed in the summer months too.. makes a lot of leftovers.  I think cooking it for 7 hours though seems to be a bit long. I took out the chicken after 5 hours and it all seemed done to me, so not sure why it needs to go back in for 2 more hours. Thanks for recipe.. tastes good.

this has become one of my favorite dishes by far. i've tried it both with the beer and chicken broth- it is great either way. Easy to make and we always have left overs. Everytime I serve this to fmaily / friends, they love it and ask for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect "as is." There is no need to change or add a thing. To stick to the Southwest flavor of this, I've stuck to import beers like Corona & DosXX. Have tried them both and each gave the soup a distinct flavor. Personally, I like the Corona. With the extra bottles, makes a good excuse to invite friends. Delicious with some corn tortillas and sliced up avocado.

Good soup but a little too close to chicken chili.  I substituted can pinto beans for the chili beans and used enchilida sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it tasted more like a "Taco" soup.  This dish will be made again!!!  Very easy and quick to prepare.

This was absolutely wonderful! I started this one like I do all my soups: saute onion, garlic, and celery in olive oil in the slow cooker. Then, I added the remaining ingredients (chicken broth, not beer). I also took the suggestion to use Bill Echols taco seasoning. I topped mine with sour cream and fresh homemade pico de gallo. I already want more of this soup. It tastes and smells heavenly! This is going to be a staple in my house, no question!

I pretty much made this as the recipe stated and it was amazing.  I only had to change a couple of things based on what I had in the pantry.  I used Romano beans instead of black beans, and 1 can of Furmano's tomatoes-28 oz (from the States), 1 can of Primo Recipe Starters diced tomatoes with basil and garlic-not 28 oz, maybe 20 oz. (sounds gross, I know, but it's all I had and it worked) and a small can of Herdez salsa with green chilies-210 grams (7 ounces).  That's what I had on hand and the dish was a hit.  Will definitely make again.  Not sure why people thought the beer gave it a weird flavour, maybe they didn't cook it long enough???

Not great, not bad. Four stars only because it is indeed quick and easy. I do agree with other reviewers that the flavor was disappointing with the recipe as is. Next time I'll drink the beer (used Sam Adam's Brown Ale, which they recommend for Mexican food) on the side and use chicken or veg stock instead. I even used cheese and chips on top to help and was still disappointed.

This is absolutely delicious! I used the tortilla strips that you can buy in the salad section at the grocery store to top it off rather than the chips. Great presentation, easy to do and yummy!

Really good. We cut flour tortillas into strips, sprayed lightly with olive oil, and put them in the broiler on high for 3-4 minutes until crunchy. Yummy, and lower fat than tortilla chips.

This was incredible.  I used chicken broth instead of beer only because you cannot purchase beer in MN on sundays!  Otherwise followed recipe as written...YUM!!!!!!  Topped it with sour cream, cheddar cheese, fresh cilantro and crushed tortilla chips.

This soup is awesome, and we refer to it as fancy nachos.  I'm pregnant right now, and crave nachos, so this is perfect!  We stir in the cheese, sour cream, and broken chips, and it is perfect.

i used chicken broth rather than beer but only as a personal preference. 1/2 a white onion.  I did place the chicken in a baggie with taco sauce and shook to season chicken then poured into crock pot with remaining taco sauce.  Very flavorful!! I think the reviewer who mentioned that there wasn't enough flavor must have had a week taco sauce because ours was perfect. update: I make this all the time.  I made it last week with beer as the recipe calls for and my husband likes it better with the beer.  You can't taste the alcohol after all the cooking.  I also now use the whole onion and again after slow cook of 5-7 hours it isn't so pungent.  We keep it in the fidge, warm helpings in microwave for many days.  Thanks for the recipe

Wonderful- quick, easy, and delicious!  I omit the beer and find I like the taste and consistency better.  I also make it on the stove.  I saute the onion and chicken and then add the remaining ingredients.  You can cook it until warm...or let it simmer for a few hours until you are ready for dinner.

This soup is DELISH!  I've made it a bunch of times, as is.  I use a taco seasoning recipe that's on here instead of the store packaged stuff.  This soup is hearty enough to have for dinner, with a small side salad and you are golden.  SO YUMMY!

YUM AND EASY! Used 2 very large frozen chicken breast and put them in the soup in the AM. Cooked everything for 10 hours on low, used chicken stock instead of beer. Added cheese, sour cream and cilantro on top. Very good. Very yummy.

Very good. A little spicy.  I made a double batch using half beer & half chicken broth. I froze half since it wouldn't all fit in my crockpot.

I served this soup at our Lenten soup supper at church and got wonderful comments!  It is spicy but not too hot with the Rotel and can be kicked up if you like it that way!  I scaled it up to 48 servings which made an 18 qt roasterful.  I skimped some on the beans but probably didn't need to.  I used the bulk taco seasoning from Sam's and added a little extra.  Very good!

I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the ingredients as I have a really big crockpot and love leftovers. I even measured out the spices which I hardly ever do. It was too spicy for us - too much red pepper flakes even though I carefully measured it out. Next time I'll go with less or even leave it out, but overall it was very good and flavorful (if it weren't so spicy). DH thought it too spicy too, but good. I hope the flavor doesn't intensify as it sits in fridge!!!

I made this on the stove and it came out wonderful. I added extra black beans to cut out some of the heat. Everyone loved this and I have had several requests to make this again.

Ok so I just joined the site so that I could comment on this recipe.  AMAZING!  My husband had THREE bowls!  It was a little spicy for us though because I used 2 cans of "HOT" diced tomatoes with jalepenos, I think next time I will use one MILD and one HOT.  I am about to freeze the leftovers so that we can have something delicious to eat next time we don't have time to cook a whole meal!  5 STARS FOR SURE!

This soup is fabulous!!  The only change I made was I substituted a can of chicken broth for the beer.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Did this on the stove.  Added 2 bottles of beer and 2 cups of chicken stock for more broth.  Simmered for an hour and a half.  GREAT!

Awesome! Enjoyed this easy and healthy dinner tonight for dinner. I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilies! Added 1 can of diced tomates rather then the tomato sauce. Added beer and 1 cup of cooked elbow macaroni before dishing up. Will be making again! Warmed us up in this cold Atlanta weather!!!!

Wow... this recipe is great.  It is in regular rotation at my house.  I use a can of reduced sodium chicken broth instead of the beer. I have also used fire roasted diced tomatoes, and they are great in this.  We love it with a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of cheddar jack cheese. My husband likes tortilla chips in it as well.

Made this last night. I used 5 chicken thighs instead of breasts.  The only other addition I made was a good dash of cayanne pepper.  I would also add that the chili beans are very important.  The are also refered to as cowboy beans sometimes.  They are basic kidney beans but they are canned in a meat/chili sauce.  This was great and sour cream and cheese on the top really made the dish.

This was a great recipe. I can't stand it when people change everything & then rate it, but I have to admit I changed only one thing. I didn't put the beer in, I used chicken broth instead. It was wonderful. We loved it & I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe Patti.

Wow!  This is the best soup I've had in a long time.  I can't believe how good it is because it is so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and served with crushed chips and shredded cheddar.  My husband is still raving about it.  It is very hearty, when I make it next time, I'll add a can of chicken broth, I like my soup less thick.

My sister recommended I try this recipe and I'm glad she did.  It has a wonderful flavor, and it is easy.  It is a great and easy soup/stew for cold days.  UPDATE:  I have now made this several times and it is great every time.  I use Bill Echols Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site instead of the packaged seasoning or sometimes I use a can of enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce and seasonings.

My husband loved this.  I made exactly as written, but with the poster's recipe for taco seasoning as she stated in her review.  Delicious, healthy, easy. I served with homemade taco chips. Thank you Patti!

This was amazing!  My kids even ate it all up.  I did exchange the beer for chicken broth since we didn't have any beer on hand.  It turned out excellent.  Wish I lived in colder climate so I could enjoy this soup more often.

I've made this soup 4 or 5 times.  It's so easy and fills the house with it's wonderful smell.

USE THE BEER! Don't be afraid of it. I've used Miller, Bud, and even a Land Shark Lager. Perfect everytime. This is the easiest five stars I've ever given!

My husband does not like soup - but I love soup, so I still occasionally make it. This is the ONLY soup my husband will eat. We love it! I use 4 chicken breasts instead of three, and everything else I do exactly like the recipe. Wonderful!

I will tell you, DON'T skip the beer in this recipe!  It really makes a difference and is even better the next day.  I used Miller "Chill" - Chelada-style beer, which has a hint of lime.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I make this soup religously now. It has become a wonderful addition to my meal planning! Thank you soooooo much for this one. I also use Bob E's Taco Seasoning (from the site). I use 1 and 1/2 cans of chicken broth, 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce, 2 cans of corn (drained), 1 can of Rotel, 1 can of black beans, 1 med onion (I use vidalia) 2 chicken breast, and plenty of seasoning. I probably make this soup twice a month. Top it off with sour cream and your favorite cheese, a little fresh cilantro, and jalapenos (if you like them) and YUMMY! The best part of this recipe is that it is just as good put back in the crock pot and reheated for lunch or dinner again the next day. Perfect!! Thank you so very much for this one!!

This chicken taco soup is dynamite!!!  This recipe is perfect!  A + + + + + I used McCormick® Hot Taco Seasoning Mix from the local Meijer store.  Instead of regular chili beans, I used hot chili beans.  Since I'm on a budget, I used store brand can goods which turned out fine.  The corn chips shown in my photo are Trader Joe's Multigrain Tortilla chips, made from organic white corn and several different grains.  These chips are are a healthy alternative to Dorito's.  For those who need more heat, try adding your favorite hot sauce to your serving.  I made this taco soup twice, first using beer and the second time using chicken stock.  Both ways provided an excellent soup.  Along with the soup, I baked Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread, a very easy to make side dish from allrecipes.com.  What a wonderful dinner.  My wife and I loved the soup and cornbread and will have leftovers tomorrow night.

I think the beer gives this recipe a great taste! I pregnant and I love this recipe. Its quick and easy and with the low energy of pregnant woman it is a keeper!!  I did use frozen corn and not canned. The frozen corn gave it a more fresh crisp taste to the soup.  It is also not as spicy as I thought it would be... which is great for me. Full of taste... not heat.

OMG!!! I would rate this 10 STARS if I could. I had never made soup before, but this seemed easy. I wasn't expecting it to be too amazing, but WOW it just knocked my socks off. I used hot taco seasoning cuz its all I had and used Corona beer. Wouldn't change a thing. And oh, the cheese and sour cream on top... mmm... SO GOOD!

You can't get much easier than this.  I threw 3 medium size chicken breasts in frozen and 2.5 hours later they were cooked through and ready to trim up and shred.  I did use chicken broth, as beer sounded unappealing to me, personally, for this type of a soup.  I also added some garlic powder, cumin and chili powder.  Other than that I followed it to the T.  I would say that serving 8 is a stretch though.  I would say serves 6, max.  More like 4 if people want large or a couple bowls.

This was fantastic!  I cheated a little - I used a quart of home made salsa in place of the tomatoes and chilis, used a bottle of pale ale, and used Bill Engols taco seasoning - it was fabulous!  This will be added to our rotation - thanks for a wonderful and easy recipe!

Oh Baby!  This is amazing!!  The only thing that I would change is to use red beans or another can of black beans rather than the chili beans..... I felt that the chili beans made it to "chili-ish."  But OH BABY, it was good!

This is fantastic! I used a large box of chicken broth instead of the beer and two small frozen chicken breast (which was plenty). Kept everything else the same and it was great! Don't forget the sour cream and cheese...YUM!

Loved this recipe and it's pretty versatile. I used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans and mexican style corn. I also used only half the packet of taco seasoning and added some red cayenne pepper. I didn't have a full cup of tomatoe sauce so I added a bit of pizza sauce that I had left in the fridge. I added frozen chicken breast tenderloins that I had in the freezer on top and cooked for 6 hours. I also added some turkey meatballs that I had in the frige. I liked the meatballs in the soup much better than the chicken.

Was initially scriptural because so many ingredients are from a can. But this is so easy and my family loves it. I do not alter the recipe. ( Why do people give a recipe 4 or 5 stars and then list five things they changed?) You can put it together in 10 minutes before work and it’s done when u get home. The sour cream, cheese, and chips make it even more delicious but can pack on the calories if you’re not careful. Also, sometimes add fresh cilantro to a bowl of this. Makes great leftovers.

forget potpourri, the smell of this soup will bring everyone to the table!  EASY, EASY, EASY!  Versatile recipe that seems to come out great everytime!  I threw in green peppers and chopped celery and carrots.  The heat is adjusted easily by using more or less rotel tomatoes, and I used Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe as recommended by so many others.  I served nacho doritoes along side, rather than crushed as directed.  My family loved this recipe, and I heartily recommend it.  Many accolades to the originator.

I want to give this a 4.5, because the final result was delicious, especially the leftovers! However, I strongly recommend replacing the beer with broth, or maybe replacing half the beer with broth, unless you really want the soup to taste like beer. At the 5 hr mark I took a small taste and was really grossed out by the beer flavor, so I removed a few ladle-fulls of the liquid and added in a few ladle fulls of chicken broth. I'm really glad I did - this improved the flavor by a mile!

This recipe is awesome.  We made approximately 1.5 x standard recipe for 11 adults and 4 kids and we still had leftovers.  Everyone raved about it - good sign considering Australians don't get exposed to a lot of Mexican flavours.  As we don't have black beans here (really!) we used kidney beans instead and it was still perfect.

This was quite delicious! Due to having a small crockpot, I excluded the beer, used only 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 2 chicken breasts.  I also added some Cumin, garlic powder, and quite a bit of Texas Pete.  I mixed all ingredients in a bowl then put in Crockpot and left it to cook overnight.  Didn't even have to take out chicken to shread. Very yummy and will be making again!

This recipe is fantastic!  I mix the 1st 8 ingredients the night before because with 2 little ones I have no time to open the cans in the morning.  I add half the mix, then the chicken, then the rest.  Cook on low for 10 hours.  Shred the chicken before serving.  Makes great leftovers or lunch.

I really liked this recipe. I made it as described, except I just cut the chicken breasts into small chunks and left it in the entire time. The soup had a bit of a spicy kick to it which I liked, and made the house small great. I probably wouldn't change anything if I made it again.

This was very good and SO easy.  It was nice to be able to throw everything in the slow cooker on a Saturday morning, shred the chicken later and have a meal ready to go.  I definitely recommend the cheese, sour cream, and chips for a topping.  Instead of using tortilla chips, I like to cut flour or corn tortillas in to strips, spray with cooking spray and bake in the oven until crispy.  This makes a nice topping.  It was really good with the sour cream mixed in.  It is also great for left overs.

I'm sure this was excellent as written.  I made only very minor changes - I used one can of tomatoes, 12 ounces of broth instead of beer, and only one rather large chicken breast.  It was delicious, especially with a little bit of sour cream.

if you use beer, make sure you actually enjoy the taste of the beer you use, because it is still quite noticeable in the end product.  Good base recipe, minus the beer in my opinion

OMG!  This was sooooo good!  I swapped the beer for chicken broth.  Even though I like beer/wine I do not like them in my food, so just a personal preference.  We are a "frozen corn" family so I used that instead.  Also, only had chicken tenders so I threw in 9 of them still frozen and it worked great!  I omit the Cilantro.  Served with Fritos, cheddar cheese and light sour cream.

Yum! This is awesome, especially considering how easy and inexpensive it is! I used the canned tomatoes with jalapenos instead of the ones with chilis and added some cumin and red chili flakes for a little extra punch. I'm going back for a second bowl right now.

I followed this recipe exactly, but did not make the taco seasoning mix recommended in the first review. I used taco seasoning from the pack. My family enjoyed this soup and it was very easy to put together. The entire seven hours of cooking were required to mesh the flavors. I will make this again, however, I will use chicken broth next time instead of beer. The beer gave it an "off" taste that didn't quite belong.

I made this in a regular stew pot, just cooked my chicken in the pressure cooker first. Very good and you can add or delete spices per your own preference. Serve with a dollop of sour cream, topped with flakes of fresh cilantro. My boys like to put cheddar cheese on top.

This stuff rocks and it's so easy!  My only change is leaving out one can of diced tomatoes and chiles, but only because I don't have a big enough crock pot.  Also, I use chicken broth instead of beer just because I don't like cooking with beer.

My husband loved this recipe and it was so easy to make.  I just had surgery and I needed some quick slow cooker meals and this one was great.  We decided this is our new "chicken chili".  Others mentioned the "beer" taste but I didn't notice it.  This recipe is very good and I will make it again.

I made this for my family and inlaws for Halloween dinner. I bought a jalepeno honey flavored chicken from the deli then shred it up. I changed  the recipe a little bit. Added a can of cream of mushroom,2 chicken boullion cubes, sauteed the onions with minced garlic and added water until it looked good.Topped it off with sour cream,mozzerella, lime juice, and tortilla chips. Oh, and I cooked it on the stove on low-med heat for a couple hrs. It was GOBBLED up!

I was quite disappointed in this recipe.  I am from Texas and that's not taco soup.  It needs alot more spice or umph if you will.  The beer was a little funky so next time I will do half beer and half chicken stock.  There are other recipes on this site for taco soup using beef that are alot better and they use a package of taco seasoning and a package of dry ranch dip mix which adds alot of flavor and makes the soup wonderful.  So with all that said I will try this again but I will definately make some changes.  It just needs alot more flavor!

Initially I was disappointed because it was much more like a chili than I expected, but does have a very good flavor.  The cheese and sour cream really make it.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I just blended 1 1/2 of the cans of tomatoes because I don't like tomato chunks.  I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning, and the soup was a bit spicy for my taste, so I would halve the red pepper in the seasoning next time.  I'm very sensitive to the taste of alcohol, but I used Corona and could not taste the beer at all.  I think it would be fine with a bit more chicken also.

Husband doesn't like beans, so omitted those.  Overall, we really enjoyed it and will make it again.  We added the chips and sour cream when serving, and also some chunks of avocado.

OMG! This was delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect. I loved the taste the beer gave the soup. What a treat and so easy. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to a crowd of people and if you want to make it hotter just add hot taco seasoning and hot diced tomatoes with chilies. But we loved it just like it is!!

This is the best! I have made this several times. I like to use thinly sliced chicken. It cooks quickly and absorbs the flavor throughout. Don't forget to serve with sour cream and tortilla chips. My husband and his Marines made this all the time at their base in Iraq. Thnks

I really loved this soup.  So did my husband, his brother and his father.  I had a can of chick peas that i wanted to use so I put them on in, they are healthy and I don't believe they changed the taste of the soup. I will be using this recipe again!

I'm glad others who have made this enjoyed it, but I was disappointed.  Found it lacking in flavor.  May try it again in my dutch oven on the stovetop.  Might have been the slow-cooking that diluted the flavors.

I made this for my boyfriend who promptly ate two large bowls..He stated "This is an eat til your stomach hurts" recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly and was more than pleased with the results, but after reading the reviews have decided to add the envelope of ranch seasoning to see if I can make it into a 5 star!!

I make this all the time.  The kids love it.  The only change I make is I add chicken broth instead of beer, I'm not wild about the taste of beer in soups.  I also quite often leave out the corn & add more beans instead.  Delicious & easy!

This was really good and super easy!  I made the recipe as is, omitting the onion because I was in a huge rush when I threw it all in the crock pot.  didn't miss the onion.  Very good flavor.

The only comment is that it was a little thin and soupy, so we served with a slotted spoon which took care of it.

Really just fantastic chili!  We used the hot taco seasoning for a little extra kick and it turned out great.  I think if we had used the regular/mild stuff it would have been lacking spice.  If you like a thicker chili drain the beans and tomatoes.  We ended up having to drain some of the liquid.

I always rate my recipes based on how fast my picky husband gobbles them up, and let me tell you, he LOVED this one! We even had leftovers for 2 more meals (just the 2 of us) and he NEVER eats leftovers! He even said the 2nd and 3rd meals were better than the 1st (think the flavors had more time to meld). I made this recipe exactly as written, using 1 Guinness bottle for the beer (I don't like to drink Guiness but I have 2 other recipes that I use it in and they turn out fantastic-- you absolutely cannot taste any beer once cooked). I also added sliced avocado on top when I served it. Definitely a keeper and great for a rainy weekend!

This recipe was so easy and yummy!! My hubby loved it. I did do a few things different. I used beer, which I brought to room temp. and let go mostly flat, and homemade chicken broth. I wanted it more like soup than chili. Only 1 can of black beans and fresh corn that I grew this summer that was in my freezer.I used boneless skinless chick. thighs and 1 breast. I will be making this again.

Left the beer out completely. Nice taste for a meal made from stock pantry items. I will make this again. I like that it's a chili recipe and you can convert the leftovers: nachos/cheese dip/taco filling. Tastes just as great after a few days. I added additional cumin, cayanne pepper, and black pepper, garlic, pickeled jalepenos. Subbed Stewed Tomatos drained.

i did not use a slow cooker, i cooked the chicken and cubed it first, then added all the ingredients and cooked on the stove for 3 hours. i added 2 cups of water to make it a little more like "soup" but the taste was wonderful.  the kids weren't crazy crazy about it but my fiance had 2 bowls the first night!  i love mine with sour cream and cheese.  the sour cream cools the spice for those who thought it was too spicy.  will definitely make again!

PEFECT for those cold winter days!  I took this dish to a Soup/Sandwich Potluck at Church and it was a HUGE hit, and I had a couple ladies ask for the recipe. **Substitution -  I used a can of Chicken Broth in place of the beer and it was WONDERFUL!**

LOVED IT! This is great. I was tired of the same old soups, and this one got me out of my rut. It was spicey with being hot. It was chunky and very filling. And you were right about Bill Echols Taco Seasoning, it was perfect for this recipe.

This was a hit at our house!!  I did modify a bit, but it was simple and oh, so good!  I used a can of cheddar cheese condensed soup instead of the beer, one can of chili beans, a bag of frozen corn and 2 lbs chicken breast instead of what was suggested.  It cooked on high for 3 hrs then on low for 3 and was superb with sour cream, tortilla chips and monterey jack cheese!  Next time I may add some velveeta!

It was just a bad chili recipe.  All I changed was leaving out the beer because it was for a work pot luck. I have a reputation as the queen of the pot lucks, but I threw more than 1/2 of this out! I will not be making this again.

WOW!  Seriously loved it!  Used RoTel Milder as my “diced tomatoes with green chilies” since my child can’t handle spice.  For taco seasoning I used Lawry’s brand.  I mixed sour cream and sharp cheddar in my child’s personal bowl before serving him (out of eyesight) so that I could shove a little extra dairy/calcium into him.  For a kid who despises beans, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, and chilies, he ate three bowls full.  It is really that good!
I use a three-quart slow cooker and cut the recipe in half.  It fit perfectly into my machine.  The left-over ingredients after 1/2 –ed the recipe were frozen together so that I can make it easier next time (which I will be doing soon!) This recipe goes beyond five stars!  However, if I was making it just for myself I would have added a touch more spice.

This was great - didn't use the chicken so it was a great vegetarian dish as well.  No need then for the slow cooker!  Dumped everything in the stewpot and simmered for an hour.  It was so economical and definitely don't skip out on the cheese and sour cream!  Loved it and will make again.

My family and I really liked this recipe so much!  I added 1/4 cup medium hot salsa to give it a bit more spice and it was fabulous and easy!!!Thank you for a wonderful and easy meal idea that I will make again and again for sure!

The whole family loved this soup.  The only thing I changed was that instead of using canned corn I used frozen corn.  I think it tastes more like corn!
It was delicious and we all had seconds.  I will definitely make this again.  Simple as can be!

This was a really good soup and easy to make.  The only change I made was I added one can of chopped green chilis because I only had plain diced tomatoes.  When serving I sprinkled with some shredded cheddar and crushed Tortilla Gold chips.  They are thicker and sturdier so still they had some crunch in the soup.  Will be making this again!

This was so good! I cut the recipe in half and used a frozen bag of mexican flavored corn, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and black beans. I did add a can of chili beans. I cut up the chicken breasts in chunks and just threw them in with the rest of the ingredients and cooked it in the crockpot all night. Very yummy!

A new family favorite! So easy for a working family! The hardest part is chopping an onion! I made a couple of changes: 14 oz can of tomato sauce (larger than called for); 14 oz can of diced tomatoes; additional chili powder and cumin (1 tsp each). I also used frozen chicken breasts and left it on low from 7 am to 5 pm. YUMMMMMM!

Good & healthy, too! I had cans of 15 0z tomato sauce, so I just dumped the whole thing in. I used 1 can of reg. tomatoes in place of one Rotel & I'm glad I did- it was spicy enough! Used 4 T. taco seasoning out of my big Costco jar. Used 1 lb. of chicken breasts. Instead of shredding, I tore off pieces with my fingers & threw them back in! I think it's amazing how chicken done this way or shredded tastes so much better than chopped!

Awesome!  I will definately make this again.  To "hurry up" the cooking time, I used precooked chicken breast strips.  I also added 1 tsp ground cumin, and two cloves of garlic.

This recipe was fantastic...so good that I am copying it to recipe cards to give to my family.  I rinsed and drained the black beans, and left the Mexican beans undrained.  Added ~3/4 t. cumin, 1/2 t. garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste.  Served topped with cheddar cheese and tortilla chips, this will become a regular at our dinner table!

This is the easiest, tastiest soup! I absolutely loved it! I made it for Superbowl as well and had RAVE reviews, and handed out several copies of the recipe. The only change that I made was that I doubled the recipe and instead of 2 beers, I did 1 beer and 12oz of chicken broth. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!!

This is wonderful. I get one can of the mexican style tomatoes and one regular. My family LOVES this.

Allowing for a 1/4 cheese and sour cream per serving, this ends up being 9 ww points if you take out the corn.

Very good and easy!  We like soups thicker than this broth, so I just added 2 cans of Great Northerns to the food processor when I shredded the chicken and it was wonderful.

This was wonderful from the very first bowl to the last. I didn't have the taco seasoning on hand but did have fajita packet seasoning and used that instead. Was that ever good. Try substituting that for the taco seasoning and see the wonderful flavor you get with that. Wow!! Easy and quick this receipe is!!!

My boyfriend made this great soup and I was impressed!  Couldn't taste the beer the night we ate it, but when we reheated it the next day, the beer got stronger--and stronger over the week!  I may suggest the chicken broth method next time!  But it had great flavors--highly recommend!

LOVE this recipe.  I've made it several times.  It's also great for company.  I made it recently for family member and everyone had seconds.  I suggest doubling the recipe if you are feeding more than four.  Also, water works as a substitute for beer.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  Instead of making it in the slow cooker, I just boil the chicken in water until fully cooked, shred it, and add it to the rest of the ingredients in a pot on the stove.  It is done in about 45 minutes total!  The beer is not overpowering (I use Shiner Bock, since that is what we usually have).  I usually omit the onion, but it tastes great with or without it.  A little bit of sour cream and cheese top off the soup very nicely.  Definitely a perfect recipe for the cold weather!

Very good, colorful, and easy to make!  I used 1 can of chicken broth instead of beer, and only one can of rotel plus one can of diced tomatoes.  I think it would have been too hot for us with 2 cans of rotel.  I served mine over rice, but hubby preferred crackers with his.  This should freeze well also.  Definitely a keeper!  :o)

I found it hard to believe that such an easily prepared soup could be so good!  I had to taste it for myself-AND IT'S TRUE!  This soup is great, easy and quick!  I left it in the slow cooker all day and then shredded the chicken breasts when I got home and it came out perfect!!!

I loved this recipe!  I had 16 oz of frozen tomato sauce I made over the summer,so I used all of that and only one can of diced tomatos. Also, only 2 chicken breasts. I threw those and the tomato sauce in frozen. We didn't have any beer, so I used 12 oz of chicken broth. I made it before work and left is on low for about 6 hours. WOW!

I was a little hesitant to try this because I am use to white chicken chili, but I thought it would be a good change of pace.  I was glad that I tried it. The only change I made was to use two cans of chilli beans and no black beans (hubby doesn't like beans).  We really liked this soup, it was great.  I crushed the tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl and then topped with cheese and sour cream.

I used one can of pinto beans and one can of black beans, two cans of mexican stewed tomatoes (rather than tomato sauce and diced tomatoes) a bag of frozen corn rather than canned, and burrito seasoning rather than taco seasoning - my family (including my 9 and 5 yo daughters) cannot stop raving about it!  Super easy and super yummy!

We didn't use the beer (just to lighten it up), and didn't do it in the slow cooker since we had some canned chicken. A great quick dinner - frying the onions first makes a big difference in the taste. (We've even added celery & carrot to get the kids eating more veggies.)

My kids loved this, especially with the cheddar, sour cream and chips on top!  I used chicken broth but think I'd use less next time because we like a thicker, more chili-like consistency.  I also will use only 1 can of the tomatoes w/chiles (maybe just sub regular diced tomatoes alone for the other can) as it was a bit too spicy for us.

I forgot to buy the beer for this recipe, so I just used a cup and a half of chicken broth and it was perfectly fine. Instead of cooking it on low for the final two hours, after I shredded the chicken, I turned it up to high and did one hour instead. Everything else I kept the same. Next time though, I might do my own seasonings because the taco seasoning packet had lactose in it, and I'm lactose intolerant. Probably cheaper just to use the spices I have anyway, instead of spending the $1 on the packet.

This recipe was awesome!!  I prepared it the night before and put the crock in the fridge.  It ended up cooking for about 10 hours on low, which was fine.  My husband loved it.  I tried mine w/ lime flavored tortilla chips...very nice.  It added a nice Caribbean twist to it.  We're making it for Super Bowl Sunday.  Thank you for a yummy, easy, and quick recipe.

This soup is very good.  I don't really like chili beans so I used dark red kidney beans instead. I drained and rinsed the beans and the corn to help reduce some of the sodium. I served it for our chuch small group and everyone really enjoyed it.

I left out the can of beer hoping for more of a chili consistency.  I cooked down the leftovers and poured it over tortilla chips added melted Velveeta, lettuce, sour cream, and black olives for chicken nachos.

This is one of my favorite dinners to make!  I am a college student and it is so nice to toss everything in the crockpot before I leave in the morning and have dinner ready when I come home.  I have made this with chicken and beef (family member w/ chicken allergy).  When I did it with beef, I used a 3 lb roast that I trimmed off the fat cap cut into 4 medallions for even cooking.  I always use broth instead of beer (don't like the taste of beer).  I use kidney beans instead of chili beans and I drain and rinse all my beans.  I always add chili powder and smoked paprika, because the original recipe is not very spicy.  Also, I use frozen corn which I add right after I shred the chicken/beef and allow to warm.

I made this in the Instant pot, 22 minutes!  The only thing I did was leave out the onion and the beer.
Put it with crushed chips and some shredded cheese on a tortilla shell, was SO GOOD!!!!
Leftovers were even better!!

This was so easy. I had to substitute a little based on what I had on hand. I don’t drink beer so I used chicken broth and used chili ready tomatoes and Rotel for tomato sauce and green chilis. The chicken was frozen and I cooked on High for 5 hour. It was perfect.

Made this recipe tonight and wow!! I’m a substation cook. Meaning, if I don’t have it, I substitute what I do. Used pinto beans instead of chili beans and just 1 can of tomato. 8 oz tomato paste instead of sauce. No beer, so didn’t drain the cans. Added a small can of jalapeños. More of a stew than soup, but ohhhh was it good!!!  Highly recommend!!!

I have made this recipe several times and love it. I've made it with and without the beer and found I prefer it made with the beer, but it is important to not try and hurry the process or there is a funky beer aftertaste. Cook on low 6 hours, then remove chicken and shred, returning to slow cooker and continue another 2 hours or so. I use two large chicken breast filets, cut in half and one can of tomatoes with green chili's.

I loved this soup!  I made some changes due to some dietary restrictions such as leaving out the onions and garlic.  It still came out amazing!  Instead of using store bought taco seasoning I did use the suggestion of Bill Echols seasoning as well as homemade chicken broth in place of beer (didn’t have any).  I’m one person and this recipe makes a lot so I’m freezing the rest (after bringing some into work for friends!)

Excellent chicken chili. I used a Corona for the beer, and I couldn't taste the beer hardly at all, which was perfect. I just dropped frozen chicken breasts in there, and after 5 hours they were still raw-ish. Pull the chicken apart and let cook another 2-3 hours like the recipe says and it is really tender. I would probably defrost the chicken first so it will fall apart in the slow cooker! Fed me and my girlfriend for like 4 meals apiece. Wonderful.

Wonderful and will make again.  I used chicken broth in place of beer, regular canned diced tomatoes and made the seasoning according to the Bill Echol’s recipe the OP mentioned.  Made myself a bowl with crunched up tortilla chips, threw in a little sharp cheddar, a little sour cream and diced up some avacado on top.   I had multiple compliments and four people asked for the recipe.   Better after it sits in the fridge for a day.

I was a little worried as I am not a fan of canned foods.  But it is extraordinarily good!  I used chicken thighs as they were on sale at the grocery.  I also did not use beer.  I make chicken stock and had some good stuff on hand so used that in place of beer.  I had a packet of taco seasoning but added additional chili powder, cumin, chopped garlic and smoked paprika.  I thought I had canned green chilies but turned out I didn’t but it’s still outstanding!  A keeper!

Rainy and cold out,  this was the perfect soup.  Almost a stew.  I added fresh jalapeno (seed and all) which made it the perfect spiciness.  Also added sliced Avocado to each bowl which gave it a balance between spicy and creamy. loved this recipe

Delicious soup for a rainy day. Everyone loved it and wanted to make this again.  Great feature that each person can customize with toppings. I measured/calculated each ingredient (No options).  = 21.8 calories/oz (wt) or 378 cal/cup. Total = 2270 calories in 5.5 cups, 103.9 oz (wt). I read all the fuss about the beer but I made this per the recipe using a dark Mexican beer as someone suggested. I used Modelo Negra and would absolutely use this again. The soup had a bit of a funky aroma during the early cooking but only when the lid was removed. That went away and the there was no beer taste, but the aroma in the room and the flavor was outstanding. The family commented how good it smelled and they couldn't wait to try it. Everyone loved this. I saw some comments about the seasoning. I used one packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning and a can of mixed chili beans in a mild sauce. The soup came out mild.  Would definitely recommend sticking with the recipe initially if you can. We served optional toppers including shredded cheese, light sour cream, sliced black olives, tortilla chips, and pickled jalapeno slices. Everyone added exactly what they wanted. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent slow cooker soup. I didn’t use the beer. I’m so sorry, I see some of you have very strong feelings in this regard, but my brain and my taste buds are intrinsically linked and my brain could not handle the beer. So, I used chicken broth, and this recipe is amazing! Topping this soup with jack cheese, crushed tortilla chips, cilantro, and avocado is a must. Super quick to put together, frees up your time for other things, makes the house smell great, and then graciously comes to your rescue at the end of a busy day. Haven’t you done enough already little Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup? I think we just became best friends :)

I didn’t make this in the crockpot so I took a shortcut and used shredded, smoked, pre-cooked chicken. I used the spices that the poster suggested in her review. Also used chicken broth instead of beer because that is what I had at hand. Could not be any more delicious! The smokiness of the chicken was lovely against the spiciness of the broth. This is a keeper, for sure!

This is now my favorite "go to" recipe!  My husband, teenager, and tween all enjoyed it. It is quite adaptable based on your pantry and frig contents.  I did not use beer & instead added chicken stock. Didn't have taco seasoning and used garlic powder, paprika, salt, & pepper in its place.  Works great in the slow cooker.

We love this recipe and make it frequently. I use a taco seasoning I found on here a while ago, Bill Ethols taco seasoning. The seasoning has a kick to it so you can adjust it to be a little more mild. I usually make this on my stove in a large pot, takes about 45 minutes to an hour on medium low at a low boil. Great recipe, we love it.

Super easy! I used regular diced tomatoes and added hatch green chilies that I had roasted and frozen. Didn't have beer so used chicken stock. I always add a bit of sugar when using canned tomatoes. When I shredded the chicken and added it in I also put in a can of re fried beans. The texture was amazing. We held off eating it the day it was made because I think this type of soup is always better the next day. Thanks for making a cold day in Kansas a little more bearable!!

This is AWESOME!  My kids 6 & 12 ask for me to make this all the time!  Sometimes my husband and I even get to eat some before it is all gone from the kids eating it all! Don't really change anything from the recipe, but sometimes double the cans of things so there is more for the rest of us!! :)

This is really good stuff! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but otherwise followed the recipe. Well, except for the beer, because I didn't have any. Chicken broth worked just as well. Great with cheese and crushed tortilla chips.

I will definitely make this again. I went a little heavier on the chicken breasts, seared them on the grill before adding.  Added a little more taco seasoning also.
Delicious!

A very good chili (or soup, if you prefer). I made the recipe exactly as stated, including using the beer. Don't change that part of the recipe; you simply cannot substitute chicken stock for beer and expect to get comparable results. The key is to use the right kind of beer. You don't want a light beer or an IPA here. Go for a dark Mexican beer like Modelo Negro. If you can pick up on the beer taste on the first day, rest assured that it will mellow out and basically disappear by the second day. If you're worried about it, don't use the full bottle. I also recommend draining one can of the Rotel tomatoes to eliminate a bit more of the liquid and make the "soup" more like chili. Delicious!

For the beer, I used Surley's Hell.  WAY too strong of a beer for this.  Definitely go with your "nothing fancy" beer.  
I would make this again as it was very good.  Just a funky taste from the beer I used.

Very good recipe, of course everyone adds seasoning to their taste. In my case I did add cilantro after it was done cooking and a little bit of seasoning salt. I see a lot of people saying skip the beer but I did use beer. I used a regular Budweiser and my recipe turned out great. Something is telling me that a Corona would be nice so I will try that next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Of course I read all the reviews and added the HOMEMADE spices recommended, plus I used my own canned spaghetti sauce, did not include the beer, and added the cream of chicken soup.  LOVED IT.  Thank you for this recipe.

I made as is but added in a package of Ranch dressing.  I was looking for a recipe to fill up my teenage son.  After he ate a couple of bowls said, "Mom, that was pretty good!"  Usually he never says anything when I make something new.  So by him saying that I knew it was a keeper and I'll be making it again soon.! :)

As a beginner at cooking, I found this recipe SUPER easy to make. Before making it, I read fellow reviewers' comments and took their suggestion in making your own taco seasoning as opposed to using store-bought taco seasoning, and using chicken broth as a substitute for beer. After making the recipe, I was really worried that my boys wouldn't care for it, but they LOVED it! I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was delicious.  I added 8 diced corn tortillas at the beginning.  They completely dissolve into the soup creating another depth of flavor.  Will definetely make again.  Thanks for sharing

We loved this one.  Used the all recipe taco seasoning recipe for the seasoning.  Also added some chopped green pepper I had on hand.  Tastes like something from a fine Mexican restaurant.

This soup was delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and added 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.

I have lived in Mexico for 12 years. Here this soup is called tortilla soup. This is a very good and tasty recipe. The picture shows sliced avocado and in Mexico cubed avocados are in the soup. a great addition. I am always surprised when, other than adjusting spice and seasoning levels which are helpful, people make huge changes. Adding canned soup and other major changes means you are not doing or judging this recipe so what is the point? Gracias, Patti. Yummy!

I've made this too many times to count - absolutely LOVE it!  The only thing I've ever changed is swapping out the beer for a can of chicken broth because I rarely have anything other than a light beer in the fridge.

As Is, I give this recipe 4 stars.  But with modifications to fit our tastes, I give it 5 stars.  First this recipe filled my crockpot to the brim.  I did add in an extra can of tomato sauce, and instead of the beer did chicken stock.  I cooked this in the crock pot on high for 6 hours but since it was so full it never got nice and bubbly.  So the last several minutes I transferred it all to the stove to finish cooking and only cut up 2 of the large chicken breasts and it was perfect.  I did add a lot more seasoning to add more flavor like garlic powder, cilantro, parsley, etc.  And definitely garnished with the cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips but I also think it needed a squeeze of lime and more cilantro on top.  With these additions it made it an amazing 5 star soup that we loved and will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this!   It is actually more of a chile rather than soup. It is very hearty and absolutely delicious. The only change I made is that I used an 8 oz can of El Pato Salsa Jalapeño in place of the regular tomato sauce. My crew likes the extra heat.

This is my first time making this particular type of soup and yet again, we have a winner!  If you eat it with tortilla chips, it's just like you're eating a chicken taco, so good.  And adding a small of cheese just sweetens the meal.  I love tomatoes and I was afraid the chiles were going to make it really hot, but not at all.  They had that little bit of heat that gives the soup a kick.  Great recipe.

We have made this recipe several times now and we changed one thing - used Limearita in place of Mexican beer! Oh that was good. It gives you the beer and the lime undertones. We've crock pot cooked it. We've added a bit of chicken broth to it, we've stove top cooked it. We've cut up the chicken to hasten the finish, being careful to cut it into chunks with the grain. This allowed us to shred it while maintaining the texture. We happen to like the flavor of jalapeno salt and we've added that at the end sometimes. When we made this the first time we used the Costco bulk taco seasoning. Now that we have her base recipe, which is fast to put together, we are hooked on it and have made a bulk container to use in place of the Costo brand. It really does take this recipe to the next level. We can make this stove-top method in an hour and a half. Happy potluckers! Thanks for a great combo of flavors.

One of our favorite recipes! This is an easy weekday meal. I make this for my husband and I and so we always have left overs. It just as good, if not better after it sits for a day. I've used several types of beer, but our favorite is Corona. This is a must try!!

I prepared this the night before and placed it in the frig.  The next morning my wife set the crock pot to low and went to bed.
This was super easy and delicious.  I didn't change anything about the recipe except add a little cajun season to my bowl.  
We also add the sour cream,cheese and some chille lime salad tortia stripes.
I would highly recommend this it is so good and easy to fix.  What more could you ask for.

Can't say much that hasn't already been said.

I use half a beer (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or lighter) to make it thicker.

When it's freshly made, a tiny hint of beer flavor is detectable. After reheating the leftovers, that taste disappears entirely.

I did make this before and obviously didn't use the correct kind of beer. I had only tried alcohol about 3 years ago and my knowledge of anything good or what to use was severely off. I'm so glad I came across the posting about using a certain type of beer. Thank you... Perhaps it could be recommended in the recipe for slow people like me...lol

We eat this all the time! One thing we do, however, is add cut up green peppers and red peppers to add more vegetables and we do more chicken. Also, do beer! Not chicken stock! We have done both and it's a HUGE difference! The type of beer also changes the flavor, so think about if you want more of a roasty flavor or light and sweet!

I love this and it is so easy.  My family loves it too.    After tasting it the first time I added a second package of taco seasoning and it was perfect.  I would definitely serve with the cheese, tortilla chips and avocado on top.

I made this as is and it is the best tasting taco soup ever. I too think it's the beer that makes this taste different from all taco soup recipes, but in a good way.  I didn't use Mexican beer just what was in the fridge and it is delish! It bothers me when people rate a recipe,  when what they made was not the recipe at all. Easy,  quick and I make this alot my family loves it.

Great recipe thank you !

Fantastic!!
I only used 3 chicken breast halves because I miss read the recipe, but it was perfect for us and I will keep it this way.  I also chose chicken broth over beer as I am not a beer fan and didn't have any in the house.
Sooooo good!!

This was much better than I expected it to be.  I had 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs that I needed to use up so I used those instead of breasts, and I was leary about having a beer taste so I only used 3/4 of a can of Bud Light.  :-)  BUT there was no beer flavor in it so I don't think you have to worry about it.  I love the tortilla chips in it, YUM.  Thanks!

I thought the soup was awesome!! I WOULD include the beer. I used a Shiner Boch and I couldn't taste the beer at all. I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning and I loved the flavor. Overall, it was easy to make and had lots of flavor. I'll be making again for sure!!!

This is an awesome recipe that is really easy to make.  If the flavors are not to your liking, I would recommend using Kuner's black beans with cumin and flavored chili beans.  This adds a little extra to the recipe.

Great recipe, I made it on the stovetop with frozen grilled chicken breasts, thawed in microwave. Used a packet of chili seasoning I had on hand instead of taco seasoning, and threw in some fresh cilantro that I needed to use up. Can't taste the beer, it has a nice flavor, quick and easy even on the stovetop but it would be great in the slow cooker if I plan ahead next time.

I made with light beer and had weird taste people were talking about. So i added LIME JUICE from one fresh lime in slow cooker before i serve food. It was outstanding decision. I strongly suggest to add lime juice.

This is a great soup/chili.  I followed the recipe as listed except used leftover roasted chicken I had and used just diced tomatoes and a small can of chilis as that is what I had on hand.  I used a dark amber beer as recommended.  I will be making this again.

This was so good! I made a couple changes based on reading others reviews. I did not use beer just added water instead. Did not use chili beans, didn't have any in the pantry so used 2 cans of red kidney beans. I did add cumin and chili powder...gave it a little kick. Will definitely make again.

One of our families new favorites!!!  I actually didn't have enough time for the Slow Cooker, so I placed everything in a soup pot and simmered for 2 hours.   The chicken was easy to shred.  I added a dollop of sour cream, some cheddar cheese  and topped it all with smashed tortilla chips.  The sour cream helped tone down the spice flavor.  This recipe will be made for years to come!!!

Made this for the first time and it was an instant hit! I substituted the white wine for beer and made mine stove top instead of crock pot. Cut chicken breasts into strips to cook faster sautéing in olive oil chopped onion, minced garlic and white mine. We had unexpected company drop by and it was enough to feed 5 people and have left overs ?? great recipe will be making again!

The kids said it's good enough to make again.....definitely, so I put it in my recipe box.  I made the taco seasoning mix as the author of the recipe suggested because it's just so darn easy.  I made extra seasoning so tonight, when I'm making this soup again, the seasoning is ready to go.  I used chicken broth instead of beer and served the soup with tortilla chips, grated cheese, sour cream, and avocado on the side.  Delicious!

This is an awesome, amazing, EASY recipe!  I did not use beer in the recipe and instead substituted in chicken stock in the amount of 10 ounces, simply because I had no beer on hand.  I also substituted in a can of mild enchilada sauce for the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  When I pulled the chicken breasts out of the crockpot and shredded them on the cutting board, I sprinkled the chicken with some cracked black pepper and Adobo without pepper (blue lid) before returning the shredded chicken to the soup.  I also added some Adobo to the soup and seasoned it to taste.  I used Bush's chili beans, Old El Paso taco seasoning, and found black beans that were pre-seasoned and corn that included mild green and red chilis in the Mexican food section of the grocery store.  I topped it off with shredded queso fresca with jalapenos as well as a dollop of sour cream and some crushed white corn tortilla chips.  Absolutely fantastic!

Yum!!  I followed the recipe except that I substituted canned chicken broth for the beer because that's what I had on hand.  My husband loves it too! I freeze it in freezer bags for him to have a warm and healthy lunch.

I absolutely LOVED this dish! I did make some adjustments that I thought would be a better fit for me. Instead of the beer, I used 1 cup of water. I'm not big on eating beans, so I only used half a can of the chili beans and black beans (which was perfect for me). I don't like spicy food, so I only used regular diced tomatoes, and didn't get the can with green chilies included. To reduce sodium, I used tomato sauce and taco seasoning that was low in sodium. I was worried that my soup wouldn't be seasoned enough though given the water I added (and I only had one packet of taco seasoning), so I used the, "Taco Seasoning I" recipe that I found on this website and I think it added a perfect touch. Plus that recipe calls for red pepper flakes which gave my soup a mild kick that I knew I'd be okay with. I can't say enough about this dish. You MUST try it with the sour cream and cheese. It was the cherry on the cake. My tummy is happy. :)

This is my favorite taco soup recipe! I use hominy instead of the corn, and I definitely use Bill Echols' taco seasoning instead of the taco seasoning packet. I have even canned this in pints to have on the shelf for a faster soup!

Awesome!!!  Everyone loves this, including my boys, made several times just as recipe is :) ...and by the way,  I don't understand why people mutilate recipes and then try to rate them?  A few adjustments are understandable, but when you start completely changing major Ingredients??? Just try the ACTUAL recipe!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and did not like it at all.  In fact, I ate one bowl and threw out the rest.  So sad.  Waste of money and it looked like it was going to be delicious!

I love this recipe because it's simple and so flavorful! My husband was very skeptical about the beer in this recipe until he tried it and said that it just adds so much flavor to the dish! This is one of our favorite cold weather meals! :)

Delicious!  I used a bottle of Brown Dog Ale and it made all the difference in flavor.  I know nothing about beer, so this is just what I could find at Whole Foods as a single bottle, but it worked great.  Used the Taco Seasoning recipe from Allrecipes too (haven't used anything else in years!).  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this a couple of times, and we love it. It is easy to make and we typically have all the ingredients in the kitchen already. We free-styled the seasonings and used hot peppers from our own garden. Both times it was quite spicy, but delicious! I love the use of beer. Yum.

Was a little bit too spicy for me. Was enjoyed by those who liked spicy food.  Heavy on the spices... Definitely need the sour cream and tortilla chips to balance this out.  This just missed the mark for me.  If I do make it next time, I'll probably use less cayenne pepper.

I followed the recipe, but used generic taco seasoning found at the food store instead of "Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning", and it came out really well. I might try tinkering with the chicken breasts some more since they kind of dried out in the slow cooker, but came out pretty nicely after it was shredded and put back into the slow cooker for another two hours.

This was just okay. I added toppings such as shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips. The beer was a bit overpowering. Also, the recipes calls for 3 whole skinless chicken breasts which I thought would be too much so I reduced it to 2 breasts. It was still way too much chicken for the amount of liquid that this recipe makes. i will definitely make it again but I will cut the chicken down even more, add extra corn and beans and cut the beer in half or eliminate it all together and add chicken broth in it's place.

Great recipe! The only thing I would do differently is not add beer. It was super easy! Just place all ingredients and BAM!!! No precooking required! Awesome for people with kids and working business hours. Before I left for work just put it together in crock pot and when I came home was done!

There was something off on this that only was enhanced as a left over. I used salsa instead of tomato sauce because I didn't have the chilis. Next time I will substitute broth for the beer.

Delicious! Followed this recipe exactly and it came out SOOOO good!! Next time, I'd probably cut it down by one chicken breast. Once we added the broken tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream to finish, it was like a stew. The broth was yummy and my picky teen wanted more!  It did taste like a beef chili recipe I got that uses black & red beans and beer.

If you need a quick easy, yummy receipe this is it! The whole family enjoyed and I have to say it seemed tastier the next day. I'm not sure that it was very "taco" tasting, but more like a stew - I used a tecate beer and I think this is a big part of the taste!  don't leave it out! going to experiment and try not using so much canned stuff.

This was absolutely wonderful!!! I cut the chicken into bite-size strips before cooking and cooked for the 7 hours in my slow-cooker.  Didn't change the recipe at all.  The chicken came out good and didn't have to take it out and shred it.  I'm not able to walk and stand very well, so this worked well for me. My husband and guests thought it was wonderful.

I am making it right now as I text and what a breeze this Recipe is to put together. I know I will love it as all ingredients called for are on my 'foods to eat' list. I do have a question, Patti. Could I cut the cooking time down by having it on high the first 2 hours and then finishing out the last 3 hours on low?  That way it is a total of 5 hours of cooking time instead of the 7 hrs called for on low, originally. I'm going to try this as got started a bit late today, due to an unexpected drop in. Life happens!

I made this for dinner tonight! It is so yummy! A few changes for preference and necessity- I didn't have beer so I didn't use any. Still delicious. Also, I didn't have corn so I used green beans, which worked fine. Instead of the canned diced tomatoes I just got 4 Roma tomatoes and chopped them up. Instead of an onion I used onion powder (don't like the texture of onions) as well as garlic and pepper. Super yummy!

Made this almost to exact recipe. I added chicken broth by mistake. About a cup. My family LOVED it! I say keep the beer. I have it in the crock pot now for my daughters baby shower tomorrow! Definitely a keeper! Tastes even better as left overs!

I altered slightly. I added a second can of black beans (drained). At the end, I thought it was a little bland, so I doubled the taco seasoning packet. It was awesome. The next day for lunch, it was even better.

This is a very yummy soup! I only used one can of the diced tomatoes w/green chilies (Ro-Tel) and I'm glad I did as it was plenty spicy for us.  I also used Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning & Mexican tomato sauce as others had suggested.  Topped with sour cream, cheese, tortilla chips, & avocado.  It turned out great!  A tip for the beer:  try Negro Modelo (lager brewed in Mexico).   I don't believe this recipe is meant to be made with Pabst Blue Ribbon & the like.

Excellent recipe! I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand: I didn't have tomato sauce, but I had an 8 oz can of chipotle sauce -- definitely kicked it into high gear, so not for the heat sensitive crowd. I didn't have chili beans, but had a can of charro beans to add along with the (drained, rinsed) black beans. I frequently find cooking with beer adds a bitter/metallic taste to the food, but I tempered it by adding some shredded carrot and a tsp of baking soda to counter the acidity, and it was awesome. Don't skip the beer! topped with cilantro, green onions, cheese, tortillas and sour cream for a fantastic meal. Thanks, Patti!

This recipe was great. Everyone loved it, including our 4yr old. While I tried to follow the recipe exactly, I was limited to what I had in the house, so some of the sizes weren't exact.. The largest alteration was the 2 cans of diced tomatoes, mine were chili seasoned but with green bell pepper not chilies so I threw in a small can of Old El Paso green chilies. Also, the only beer we had was Bud Lite w/ lime. 

There was NO lingering beer flavor, but I do think I could taste a hint of lime. 

It was cooked on low for probably 9hrs. Fed 4.5 people with enough left overs for 2 more meals.

So good and so easy! My husband and I make this all the time on lazy Sundays and then we have lunch for a few days as well. The only change I make is to replace beer with chicken broth. We also add the cheese and sour cream on top and serve it will tortilla chips! Thanks for the new family favorite!

This recipe is AMAZING! Please do not omit the beer because you don't think you like beer.  The beer adds a totally deeper taste to this soup! I used Corona and cooked it in the soup on the stove top since I didn't have time to slow cook this.  I also used Taco Seasoning 1 recipe by Bill Echols on this site which was delightful! Overall, this is my new go to Mexican Soup recipe I'll use from now on! My husband LOVED this and now calls it Corona Soup :)

Absolutely wonderful.  DH gave me soooo many compliments on this.  It was super easy and quick to pull together and I let it simmer for 3 hours on the stove top.  Used 3 leftover broasted chicken breasts and it was the perfect amount of meat.  Had "bold" taco seasoning mix from Penzey's and used just over 4 tablespoons.  Perfect spice.  Served with hot cornbread of course.  Thanks for sharing.  6/17/14

This recipe is sooooo good!! The only thing I changed was that I substituted kidney beans for the black beans. (I don't like black beans) Once when I didn't have enough time to make it slow cooker style- I precooked some boneless skinless chicken tenders, added them to the pot and put the whole thing on the stove for about an hour and it turned out great!

Let me tell everybody that this wonderful! First I came home from the store and there was no beer in the house, which my neighbor was nice enough to give me one...my can opener was gone because for some reason my son 
Put it up, when I put the first part together it overflowed my crock pot and an hour into my cooking time I realized that my crock pot was not plugged in...haha. It was definitely worth every problem that I dealt with. My family loved it, finished it & literally begged me to make it again :)

Delicious and can be thrown on in ten minute before you leave for work in the morning! I use PBR for the beer and add a little siracha if I want to spice it up a bit more.

We all though this was awesome. We also followed the suggestion of 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cumin and 4 tbsp taco seasoning. We didn't have any "chili beans" so we used a can of pinto beans in place of it. Made it with honey corn bread. My husband thinks it takes like a minestrone, I think it does - a taco chicken minestrone!

So easy so good!!  For the beer I used Guiness.  Instead of 2 cans of Rotel, I used one can and one can of petite diced tomatoes.  For the taco seasoning I took the author's suggestion of:  (1 T Chili Powder, 1/4 teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red pepper flakes and oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin and 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper).  I cooked on low for 4 hours, shredded the chicken, added a can of cream of chicken soup and a small amount of water with a T of cornstarch to thicken it a little and cooked another 2 hours.  Thank you for the recipe it is a keeper in our house.

Just threw this together before I went to work. I only had diced tomatoes with basil and garlic, I used it anyway. I only had 2 cans of black beans, used them. Large can tomato sauce. I added Guiness dark stout and cut up a few hot peppers I had frozen from the year before. I also made my own taco seasoning from a recipe I found on Allrecipes.com.  I like that much better, no junk just spices and herbs. I also added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 tsp Better than Boullion chicken seasoning.  Two bone in breasts gave more than enough meat.  It smelled so good  when I got home!  My son ate 3 bowls and told me how tasty the soup was.  This went into my recipe box!

Awesome! Winning recipe with the family. I used chicken thighs instead (preference bc more moist and flavorful plus less expensive). The meat just fell off the bone after 5 hours in the crock pot on high. I used Corona for the beer used. Definitely a keeper recipe! Don't forget the avocado! It's in the picture but not on the shopping list.:)

I have made this more than once. I swapped out the tomato sauce for green chili sauce. Use organic ingredients, especially for the taco seasoning so you're not getting MSG. The beer adds flavor, the alcohol cooks out (in response to someone avoiding beer because it was for work). Sometimes you have to play around with a recipe to match your own taste desires.
Use organic for the beans too to avoid BPA lining. Edens' Organic does not use BPA lining. Or soak your own dried beans.

By far my favorite slow cooker meal I make.  Make sure to read the cooks note and follow the instructions to make your own tacco seasoning for the very best results.  I would not change a thing in this recipe, it is perfect as is....

Loved this! I made the taco seasoning as listed in reviews and wow...awesome. I didn't pull the chicken out to shred. It was soft enough to shred in the crock pot with a fork. Highly recommend this recipe!

Nice flavor & easy to make; however, too spicy for the kids to eat. If I make this again, I will sub petite diced tomatoes for the Rotel tomatoes.

I followed this recipe exactly except for using frozen corn (instead of canned) and used salsa (instead of canned tomatoes).  It was very tasty, but I think it could have used even more taco seasoning.  I used Corona beer, which is a light enough taste for me.  I think corn chips would have been a wonderful addition too.

Really liked this, I peronally changed out two types of beans for two cans of garbanzo beans because I like them, and omitted the beer (not old enough to drink anyway). Definitely an easy go to recipe.

This is a very good recipe. Quite spicy though, but just add some sour cream at the end to mellow it down! I use a rotisserie chicken and shred it rather than the raw chicken breasts. We also top it with Fritos and some shredded cheddar cheese! Delicious!

I have made this several times and the only changes I made were to cut everything in half because I use a small slow cooker and I used chicken broth instead of beer.  Very tasty and the leftovers are perfect to take to work for lunch.

Absolutely amazing!!  I do not usually rate recipes but this recipe was so good I had to make a comment. I did substitute one cup of homemade chicken broth for the beer and I added one can of green chilies. Other than that I followed the recipe.  My whole family loved it!!  I had friends over for lunch and served this and my friends asked for the recipe!  Incredible!

Delicious!!! I agree with other reviewers: USE THE BEER! It's the secret ingredient to how yummy this is.  So easy. Of course if you don't like spicy, use plain diced tomatoes. My family loved it made exactly as written.

Awesome and the easiest recipe ever! Try adding browned chorizio for added kick! But you must add crushed tortilla chips and sour cream when you serve it up! It completes this chili/soup!

This soup turned out great.  This recipe is definitely a keeper :) 
I know a few reviews said the taste was "off" from using beer, but I used Modelo beer and couldn't taste it at all.  (Maybe other reviewers didn't cook long enough for the alcohol to cook off?)  
Also, I only used 2 chicken breasts as many people recommended, and there was PLENTY of chicken.  I think 3 might have been overwhelming. 
PS: All of my canned ingredients were low/no sodium, salt free or no added salt & it was an AWESOME decision!  I figured there was enough salt in the Taco seasoning packet & I didn't want it to be too salty.

Made this for the superbowl last night. It is so easy and turned out so good. So glad that so many people rated it high because that is how I choose my recipes on this site. Thanks for sharing and couldn't believe how moist the chicken turned out.

Substitute red kidney beans for the chili beans, leave out the beer, and add more chicken. I personally double the recipe for my family of 7.  Add mozzarella cheese to each bowl and mix in. My family loves this!!!  It's a constant request in my home!

Made the recipe with no changes. Saranac IPA for the beer. Simmered on the stovetop for 4 hours instead of a crockpot. Chicken broke up with forks very easy. YUMMMMMMMMMMMM

We loved this soup! I only used one can of the spicy Rotel tomatoes because they are very spicy to me. I used a big can of diced tomatoes with spices instead. I think you can definitely taste the beer, so leave it out if you don't like beer. I couldn't find chili beans in the store so used pintos and red beans instead. In the future I might add some cooked rice to this, I think it would be a good addition. I will definitely be making this many times in the future!

I am new to cooking and just left the world of ramen noodles and Mac and cheese. This will definitely go in my new recipe box. I LOVED it. I plan on making this for my Super Bowl party. Oh and for all you worried about the beer in it the alcohol cooks out. Won't get a buzz off a bowl, sorry.

I didn't have beer on hand so I used a can of chicken broth and added two cans cream of chicken to enhance the texture and flavor. My family LOVED this recipe. Rarely do I make all 6 in our family happy.

Work early. Not home until after 2pm. Did this in a cast iron skillet, and it turned out one of the best soups or chile that I've ever made!
Couldn't find the chili powder for Bill Echols taco seasoning, so changed it to chipolte powder. Can't wait to try it in a slow cooker!

this was a great dish, and super easy to make. I don't know what all these folks have against beer, but it was awesome. don't be a crazy fool, buy a six pack, pour one in, and the rest goes down great with this awesome soup. I only added a little more seasoning, but who doesn't? my wife and kids gave me an attaboy for this one. thanks for the great recipe.

Very Good! Easy to follow and my neighbors loved it. I was going to take a picture of it but it was gone too quick. I'd leave the tortilla chips on the side though. Get a bit soggy.  I put some avocado slices on top of each serving (like the picture). Thanks for the recipe.

Just what I was looking for!  Tastes great with shredded cheese and sour cream.  I even omitted the chicken once and it didn't change the flavor at all.

Loved it! Did use the suggested taco seasoning but cut back on the chili powder, for the kiddos! Served over tortilla chips in bowl with avocado slices, dollop of sour cream.  This will be perfect for baseball game nights.  Thank you

I made this for dinner tonight and the whole family raved! I followed recipe, added the Bill Echols seasoning 1 and used Guinness draft beer and didn't even notice the taste of beer at all. I did the cheese, sour cream, cilantro and lime to top it off. This is going on my favorites for sure, thanks for another great recipe!!
Update- A regular dish in my home now, everyone gets excited for chicken taco soup night!

I have made this twice in a week and a half.  My husband I love this recipe and for me...it is EASY to make.  I make this recipe exactly as is except for chili beans.  I don't like chili beans as much as other beans.  The two times I made it, I used black bean and white beans.  YUM!!!

I absoultely love this soup. I was uncertain about the beer but you cannot even taste it.  This is a new family favorite and have had friends ask for the recipe.  I added some yogurt to my own bowl and it was almost identical tasting to Chilis Chicken Enchilada soup. Thank you for sharing!

I doubled the recipe because I wanted it to last for at least two days and I have a family of six. Everyone loved it. I followed just like it said  but I used half the beer and it was still great! I think I'll take it to a office pot luck too.

YUM!! I changed several things, but this recipe is a great base...like chili you can add/eliminate things and its still good!  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste and water. I added a chicken bouillon cube. Also used a can of regular diced tomato. I added a can of cream corn- which thickened it up. so good! would recommend!

We really liked this easy recipe.  I pretty much followed directions other than using pinto beans instead of the chili beans and since we are not big beer flavor fans I used chicken broth.  Ok, so maybe that is a major change to the base flavor!  I put frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot on low for close to 8 hours since it was overnight and then shredded it and it was perfect.  I think I will do one can of tomatoes with chilis and one plain next time b/c it was a bit spicy for the kids (used Rotel with chilis, lime, and cilantro).  I added a little dry cilantro to it as well.  Sour cream and chips is a must!  Update:  I made this with the beer instead of the chicken broth and the family didn't like it nearly as much.  I'll stick with the chicken broth from now on.

Absolutely enjoyed making this and LOVED each bite. To add more umph I added chopped celery and fresh diced tomatoes. I'm not a huge fan of sour cream and I like to keep my meals light, so I used non-fat plain greek yoghurt as a topping (it really rounds out the flavors) and a dash of sriracha sauce. I also didn't have 7 hours to cook this, so I put it on high, and halved the cooking time. So 2.5-3 hours on high to cook the chicken, then once cooled and shredded, another 1-1.5 hours. Seriously amazing stuff. Thanks for sharing!

Superb!! It is so good!! Cook it strictly to the recipe, superb. Vary a bit, still superb. I would not leave out the beer (as some have suggested) because I think it might be like leaving out the chicken broth in some other recipes. It is the heart of the meal, this tasty broth, so just leave as is and meditate on the earth's sea water, a complex frothy mix that you just really can't separate. Anyway, I'm cooking it now as I write, it puts me in a good mood, always.

This soup is delicious! I used 4 chicken breasts instead of 3, used chicken broth instead of beer, added 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp. of cumin, a dash of red pepper flakes, and a small can and a 1/2 of green chiles (didn't have diced tomatoes with chiles like the recipe called for).... the flavour was great and was not as "bland" as some reviewers said. A lot of the reviews on this recipe are rather "fussy" saying you MUST use the beer, and you MUST add more spices, etc. I made it as mentioned and it was perfectly delicious!

It is good. You could easily omit the beer.  I don't think it enhanced it overall, and I could taste the beer flavor. I like rich seasonings and spicy food, and this is pretty mild, so next time I would add more chili powder or hot salsa or something.  Maybe next time I will blend up some salsa so it is liquid and use it to replace the liquid of the beer I will leave out.  It was good and healthy, I will make it again, but it won't go into my favorites file yet.

Very good slow cooker meal!  I used my own taco seasoning (2 Tablespoons of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of coriander, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper).  I also used two large chicken breasts (probably about 1 lb) and a Bud Light Lime (the lime flavor worked out well in this dish).  It was a little spicy for my 10 y/o daughter, but she just added sour cream to bring it down a notch.  Definitely will make again!

Wow, this is a good soup!  When I saw the recipe, I wanted to make it right away since the weather is cool here today and it looked so good in the pics.  Unfortunately I did not have any chicken, so I browned 1 pound of ground beef, and  used beef broth instead of beer.  It turned out delicious!  Next time I will make it as written and review then.

Unlike other reviews, I found no overwhelming beer taste... Perhaps it's because I used a quality Belgian wheat instead of a cheap gut-rot inducing beer.  I totally skipped the chiles (mainly because I skimmed over the ingredients when putting together) and added instead  a mix of cumin, chili powder, can of tomato paste, and a touch of cayenne half way thru.  
Gave a nice heat and nice aroma as it simmered.  Used 2 chicken breasts and found that to be more than enough. This turned out more like a thick chili than a soup.  I recommend to use frozen corn instead of canned, much better taste. All in all it was easy to toss together and was easy to spice up to my liking.  Will make this one again for sure.

This was incredible, I will definitely be making it again.  I added in one yellow and one orange bell pepper just because I like them and it was a great addition.  I also rubbed the chicken with Weber Kickin' Chicken seasoning before adding it and it gave a really nice flavor.  Also, you can drain the juice after heating it up and put it on a flour tortilla with sour cream and cheese and it makes amazing burritos.  As a college student, this was just perfect.

Wasn't sure if we liked it the first night because it seemed a little tangy, but the next day it was AMAZING! Definitely one of those things that only get better the longer it has to set. We used Octoberfest beer and it is delicious!

Made this for some students tonight for a (late) Halloween party and they loved it! Added some extra veggies and served it with rice and some local bread. Will make this again as it gets cooler. Couldn't find black beans easily so I used Azuki beans and they worked great! I also used a very cheap beer that I found here and it worked fine.

I had intended to use the slow cooker to make this recipe, but ended up  on the stove top.It was just to temping on a cold,grey fall afternoon! The only subsution I made was using a store bought rotissare chicken and adding a bit of fresh garlic. I simmered all ingredients for five hours added the chicken during the last two hours. Beautiful, spicy, healthy soup. Husband & teens happy. Will make all season long.

My family thought this was amazing!   So easy! I used leftover chicken meat from a roaster that I had in the freezer and decided to make stock with. I also used frozen corn off the cob from the summer, fresh frozen peppers (green and yellow) from the summer......this was a very easy throw together , I used 2 pks of taco seasoning and served with tortilla chips, shredded cheddar and low fat sour cream. Excellent!

I made this for Taco Day at work and it was amazing. Everyone asked for the recipe. I made it again for my family and the results were the same. Both times I left it in the slow cooker for at least 10 hours before I shredded the chicken. It practically shredded itself! This is a keeper, especially now that we are heading into the fall and winter season. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made a few changes to this recipe and it was fabulous. I added chicken broth instead of beer, added 2 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp chili powder and 3 dashes of chipotle instead of taco seasoning. I  used 1 large can diced tomatoes and 1 can green chillies and only 2 chicken breasts. Family loved it--it is definitely a keeper.

Delicious and easy. I didn't have tomato sauce so I subbed tomato paste, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I hate the taste of beer, but thought it worked fine here: it added depth to the sauce without tasting like beer. And my husband said I could make this any time.

Made this twice in one week! Took it to work the second time and there were no leftovers!  Used chicken broth once and beef broth once in place of the beer.  Made my own taco seasoning, as recommended by RaisinKane aka Patti and this kicked it up a bit. It's a perfect recipe: simple, one pot and delicious!!

I love this recipe and it's a regular meal for us. I just slightly change it. I do not use the beer for one. I bake my chicken with seasoning, and drizzle olive oil on it. Then after chicken cools I shred chicken and then start the soup in my croc pot. I salute my onion, about a half of a red, orange or yellow bell pepper, a jalapeno (you can use more or less of jalapeno) depending how hot you like) and minced garlic in a small fry pan with olive oil. Then I place ingredients I added and omit the beer into the croc. I use the rotillo tomatoes and chiles that is the "mexican" style one with lime and cilantro. Very yummy! I tried to add a pic, this site is not very photo friendly...

This receipt was amazing. I was a little worried that it would not have much flavor. I am happy to say I was completely wrong.  I added a 6 oz can of roasted green chillies and about 5 cloves of garlic.

I will make this again!

My family loved this and they are hard to please. I like more spicy foods so I added 2 hot rotell cans, reduced sodium taco seasoning, 2 cans instead of 1 of chili beans (1 spicy), and chicken broth instead of beer. Love beer but not in my food, just in my drink.

This was super easy to throw together in my crockpot. I left out the beer and replaced it with a can of chicken stock. I also added a pinch of salt, since it seemed to be missing something. Other than that, it was perfect and my family ate it right up.

Made this yesterday for the first time and ... WOW, it was fabulous.  Followed the recipe pretty much as directed; however, I did use chicken broth instead of beer and threw in a little cumin and garlic powder.  Also used a 6-quart slow cooker, and it turned out to be the perfect size as this recipe makes a lot.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks, RaisinKane, for sharing your recipe.

All I can say is MMMMMM..... so very good! I still tasted a bit of beer flavor, unlike some of the other folks who made this, but love it. Stirring in fresh lime juice, cilantro, and a bit of sour cream really give this a good finish. It can be thick like chile, but if you like a bit thinner, just add a bit of chicken broth.

When looking for a soup, I hit favorites to see what would come up. As I read the title I had no idea what to expect. I decided to give it a try as these ratings are usually good indicators!  It was an incredible hit and will definitely make again!

I made this last night and my family almost licked their bowls clean. I read reviews before starting and did not make any changes to this soup. I used Bill Echos taco seasoning as suggested by the recipes creator. I believe this is a key component to making this soup taste as great as it is. I also used dark beer 8oz Dos Equis Amber. We topped our soup with grated cheddar, avocado, and fresh lime. This is a new favorite. Thank you for sharing!

Really easy and really delicious!!  Whether with sour cream, tortilla chips or on it's on, this is really a filling and satisfying dish.  I prefer a bit more spice and found it was better with some added salt, chili powder, onion powder and paprika.  Will certainly be making this again.

This is incredibly easy on top of being so tasty. Was about to pull out some steaks to grill when-OOPS-- I found some raw chicken breasts in the fridge that were about to expire--thought immediately about this go-to family fave recipe.  So I'm gonna whip it up tonight and just reheat  tomorrow for dinner.  Extra yummy if you crumble Fritos or tortilla chips either on the bottom of bowl or sprinkled on top. Love adding cheese and sour cream too. Great leftovers!

DELICIOUS...EASY...and HARD TO MESS UP...for example, today I didn't have black beans, I used garbonzo instead....still came out AWESOME.  I love a dash of lime juice in the end...totally makes the soup.  Last week I had fresh cilantro....DELICIOUS....(cilantro turned rotten this week so did without) and still delicious.  I always use one can diced tomatoes w/ chili's vs. 2 just because the kids freak out about the spice.  Still spicy but not as bad.  We're broke this week and I'm still trying to avoid unnecessary/cheaper carbs (ie bread/pasta) so this recipe works great for rough times and good times.  Never used beer, but when it's in the house I'll use it if it's readily available.  Sometimes I only have 2.5hrs on HIGH.  Sometimes all day....still comes out AWESOME.

Full of flavor and easy. I changed a couple of things, but not because the recipe needed it, just my personal preference. Omitted the tomato sauce and beer. Added a can of chicken broth and some extra water towards the end. One of the cans of Rotel was hot.  The soup ended up being pretty hot, but good with the sour cream on top. My chicken breast weren't thawed. I put them on top of all and they cooked up beautifully. I like to start the crock pot on high to get it going, then after an hour or so, I'll turn it back down to low.

I gave it five stars because it's really easy and really good.  I didn't have an onion but didn't miss it either.  1 whole chicken breast (2 halfs), 2 cans of chicken broth instead of beer and only 1 can of diced tomatoes.  Excellent!

This is easy to make and its nice to read other reviews to know how to make raisinkane's taco spice. Spice is enough to drive away a cold but not too much to make something "too hot". Temp is just right. I dont have a slow cooker so made it on the stove, easily. Just let it simmer for a couple of hours. It works. Thanks!

First time making it: followed directions to a T...it was tremendous.  Subsequent times lowered the sodium content by using low/zero salt versions of all the canned goods and taco seasoning are...Still tremendous.

Such an easy and delicious soup! Both my kids loved it. I didn't shred chicken until just before serving, as I didn't get home to do it 2 hours before serving. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is one amazing recipe!!  My family just loved it...  It was so easy to make.  I hated the fact that this recipe called for beer?  So I used the beer.  The end result was just awesome!!  I do recommend this to all of you!!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!  The only change I made was I used Chicken Broth instead of beer.  It lasts me & my hubby about 3 dinners & it gets better each day.  I've made it twice already & still can't get enough.  So simple too.

This was awesome! I did pre-cook my chicken as I wasn't sure I'd be able to shred it in 5 hours. I also added a teaspoon of ground cumin and garlic salt. I did use sour cream and broken tortilla chips. My family also used tortilla chips like we normally would crackers as we ate it. YUM

This recipe was spectacular!  I made it as written (with one exception), and the entire family gobbled it up.  I didn't have a can of beer, and so instead substituted chicken broth.   The prep time is minimal and it's great to drop everything into a slow cooker and come home to a healthy, high protein dinner.   Next time, I will add more liquid, for personal preference.  I would prefer it with another 15 oz of liquid so there is more broth.  Thanks for sharing -- it will definitely be in our rotation.

This recipe is quite good. I would modify it for less of some of the ingredients. I found that the chili beans, the tomatoes (with chilies) and the taco seasoning are just too much. The soup was way to spicy at least for our taste. I will make this recipe again however I will add half of the amounts of the aforementioned ingredients or would add little by little those ingredients especially the chili beans and taco seasoning until I get the desired spiciness before covering the slow cooker to let it do its job.

This is awesome stuff!! I made this recipe as written and it is great, and sooo easy to make, it's fun! My wife loved it too, and she's not big on real spicy foods. The recipe is in my box and I will make this again soon. If you feel the need to tamper with this recipe, then I suggest you find another, but leave this one alone! Mmmmm....GOOD!

This recipe is incredible, I altered it to cook on top of the stove due to time constraints but the stew like consistency and the hearty addition of beans makes it a meal in of itself. i used skinless boneless thighs instead of breasts and added diced red peppers. Served with cheese quesadillas on the side, awesome!

This could be the easiest thing to make!! I didn't have beer, so I substituted chicken broth. Chicken was so tender, soup was spicy but not too spicy. Served with shredded mexican cheese and used "scoops" tostitos to eat it...very thick like a chili

This recipe turned out delicious! I would also have to say it's been the easiest slow cooker recipe I've made. I've only made 4 so far, but I honestly think it couldn't get easier than opening a few cans, a bottle of beer, and throwing in a few extra ingredients! I cooked mine on high for 3hrs, shredded the chx, and then continued cooking on high for about 45mins. I made the soup with Heineken (there was ZERO "beer" flavor so it was great). I also added 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, and some cilantro. I wish I added MORE cilantro because I couldn't really taste it at all. Next time :) Served with tortilla chips, cheddar, and sour cream. Definitely a hit with my boyfriend...which makes me feel great!

Followed the recipe exactly, using 1 1/2 lbs. chicken tenders, and it was perfect.  Used Bill Echols taco seasoning (recipe from this site) as others had recommended.  Fantastic flavors.  The beer DOES give it an odd, but not unlikable taste.  My husband loved it - I think I would like it just as well using chicken broth rather than beer.  Easy - will definitely make again!

I love this recipe, I've made it many times.  It's very easy to make, I add black olives and use chicken broth instead of beer.  I serve it over rice and my family loves it.  A great meal on a cold winter day.

It makes a lot..about 12 hearty servings...My husband and i love eating this soup in the cooler months.
We have started freezing it in individual 
containers enough for two.  It is tastes even more delicious reheated. And it is so nice.. on those cold, dark winter months when there is no desire to prepare a healthy, warm meal. Also great with crusty bread and butter.

This recipe had mixed reviews in our house.  It didn't turn out as 'soupy' as we expected.  We'll give it another try with a few tweaks.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! My husband often complains that stuff from the slow cooker always tastes the same but this one he loves. It’s packed with flavor, super yummy, and about as easy as you can get (just dump cans). I often double the recipe in my large oval crock pot and freeze several containers of it for future use.

This is a favorite at our house. After reading the previous reviews, I've made a couple of changes.  I use 12 oz of chicken broth in place of the beer, and I use 2 (1 oz) packages of taco seasoning instead of just one at 1.25 oz.  We also like this soup with flour tortillas torn up in it.  I also cook mine all day while I'm at work (8+ hours) and then come home to shred the chicken.  It's always been fine, not overcooked.  This is a great recipe! I've made this for my co-workers and they LOVED it.  Definitely worth trying.

This is no exaggeration... my husband warned me that he “hated” tortilla soup when I told him this was cooking in the crockpot yesterday.  I guess he later felt bad for his harsh words after my efforts… so as a peace offering, he offered to taste it as long as I understood that his dislike for this recipe would be directed to the food and not my cooking.  With a smirk on my face, I made him a tiny, sample size bowl.  Well, he loved, loved, loved it!  He made himself bowl after bowl after bowl, and made constant “yummy” noises!  Then he called his mom to tell her I would email her the recipe, then he asked if one day I could make a batch for him to take to work! Today he took leftovers to work which is also out of character for him!  This recipe was so extremely easy too!  I used the home-made taco seasoning recipe instead of the packaged taco seasoning, which I think made it over-the-top delicious.  I also didn’t use beer, but plan to try it next time.  This recipe is now going to be my signature dish!

Loved it! I doubled the recipe for a large crowd, but still used 1 bottle of beer (Boulevard Wheat) and a splash of chicken broth. I also added Cilantro and a small amount of diced garlic. Otherwise, followed the recipe to the "T". Finished it with a healthy squeeze of lime. My crock pot was empty before the others had been tasted! Lots of requests for the recipe.

Great recipe! To tie the taco theme all together, top with shredded low fat Mexican cheese, crushed corn tortilla chips, and...cilantro! Served this to a group of friends and the consensus was that cilantro was a great addition, it adds a new element of flavor. This recipe is easy to modify to make it even healthier - choose low fat or low sodium options wherever possible (taco seasoning, I'm looking at you). Also don't be afraid to go off the path a bit and add your own ingredients. I added cumin, turmeric, chili powder, pepper, and a jalapeno to give it some kick. 5 stars!

Started this before I left for work yesterday.  Set the crock pot on low for 5 hours, keep warm for 5 hours.  When I came home, I gave it a stir, shredded/cut up the chicken, put it on high while I gathered the cheddar, cream cheese, and tortilla chips and set out bowls.  At first I thought it might be a little on the salty side (must have been the taco seasoning I used - Chi Chi's, won't use again) but with the addition of the sour cream, it was just perfect!  My husband loved it, too.  Had left overs today (makes a LOT!) and it was even better.  I will definitely be making this again.  Simple and really tasty!  Filling, too.

This stuff is incredible. Hits the spot EVERY time! We make this all the time in the Fall/Winter except we use the Habanero Rotel, which in my opinion gives it a 'medium' heat. We also use the taco seasoning recipe that was mentioned and I add a can of homemade canned tomatoes in lieu of the tomato sauce and some chopped peppers, which is minor. So delicious and flavorful. Perfect topped with sour cream, cheddar cheese and crushed tortilla chips. WINNER!

I LOVED this. So easy. I added some of the spices from the taco seasoning on here to the brand I had. I just checked the ingredients, and added what wasn't in there already. It was really good served over rice.

Easy and basic. I suggest you  serve with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips.  I also suggest avocado.  Very much like a tortilla soup.

I'm in college and made this for my roommates and myself. It was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased. It's not very expensive to make, and totally worth it! I will definitely be making this again!

Made this many times and always turns out really good. Made the way it was written with the beer but doesn't need it. I have since used chicken broth instead.Very easy dish to play around with to your liking. A great tip - Add a few extra chicken breasts to the pot to used for chicken enchiladas another day.

Really easy!  Half my chicken was still frozen, didn't make any difference.  Didn't shred the chicken until about 30 minutes before, and it was fine.  Slightly spicy and excellent flavor.  Very filling.  Hubby loved it :) !

I followed the suggestion in some of the reviews, and used chicken broth instead, and instead of plain frozen corn,I found some frozen corn that had a southwestern flavor, and used that for added kick.  Then added some spices of my own. Loved it!

Me and my husband both loved this. I didn't use the beer - just substituted a cup of water. My only complaint (and in no way is the recipe submitter's fault) is that it makes too much for 2 people! Leftovers for days because black & kidney beans don't come in smaller cans :) Oh well, #first world problems, right?

Very good. Only thing I did different is use chicken broth instead of beer. Didn't have any and I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Will denfinitly make again. Getting a little cold here in WI and a nice warm soup warm's you up.

***I HATE BEER*** but I tried this anyway and loved it!!  I made the following modifications: 6oz can tomato paste w/ 2oz water instead of 8oz tomato sauce b/c that's what I had - homemade taco seasoning instead of a packet (any of the ones on this site are good, just make SURE you watch how much red pepper goes in b/c that's where the heat comes from) - Rotel diced tomatoes *lime juice & cilantro* instead of *green chilies* and for the beer I used Dos Equis (one 12oz bottle).  I cooked on high for 4hrs.  It was perfect... my kids (6 & 3) ate two helpings!

Husband can't get enough of it, so I guess it's a keeper!  Followed the recipe, used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe from this site and used all if it, and added a couple dashes of hot sauce.  It was delicious.

This is my go-to weekend soup recipe!  I've tried a couple different types of beer in this soup & so far I've found that the darker brews will really bring out the taco seasoning & chili flavors.  We garnish this soup like you would any other taco; sour cream, shredded cheese & black olives.

Loved it. Cooked according to exact directions above and it was great. Probably a little bit spicy for someone who doesn't like spicy foods, but if so then jsut use diced tomoatoes without the chilis. Easy and will cook it again for sure

Tastes Amazing when you use the suggested recipe for Bill's Taco Seasoning! I added a little bit of chili paste in, since I didn't have the diced tomatoes with chilies. I used 1 28oz can of reg. diced tomatoes, and 1 5.5oz of tomato paste cause that is all I had on hand. Tonight will be my forth time making it. My family enjoyed it more topped with cheese.

This is amazing, I love it!  I think it might be one of my favorite soups now, and even my children like it.  I did add a chopped red pepper, just to be sneaky about another veggie for them.  Delicious!

YUMM-ALICIOUS! Made this recipe for myself and a friend who had a hip replacement and she liked it so much, she has asked for the recipe twice. She stated she likes foods that have several levels of flavor and seasoning and this one hit the mark. My tastes run a bit simpler, but I enjoyed it a lot...so much so that it will be in my regular soup rotation. Even though I am a Texan and I love my Tex-Mex...I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to "heat" and this one was not too spicy for me. Of course, your mileage may vary!

I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning and followed the recipe to a "T" with one exception...I substituted a can of beef broth for the beer. 

I served it with mild cheddar cheese...freshly grated. Do yourself a favor and grate your own cheese...makes a big difference!

I ran it through the WW Point calculator and based on the nutritional info provided...with no substitutions, it came out to 11 PointsPlus per cup.

Loved this! So easy and yummy!  I only used two whole chicken breasts which was plenty.  I cooked it on low for about 10 hours. I used Boulevard Single Wide IPA. MAYBE next time I will sauté onions first but my husband loved the onions the way they were.

I get annoyed with people who change the recipe and then rate it. However after reading other reviews I did use chicken broth instead of beer. This is a great recipe. I have made it many times. Its  big hit with my adult son. Its on my list of go to soups to make and its so easy!

Mine did not come out even close to a soup.  I think it should be listerd as chili, as it's very chunky and has no broth to it.  With that being said, it is delicious as a chili or a dip for chips.  I did not have beer, so I used 12 oz of chicken broth instead.  Someone suggested using water, but I thought it would drown the taste.  After seeing the final product, water would work just fine.  My husband loved it as well!  Will be making this again, just not as a soup!  :)

This is a great and versatile recipe. I usually use just one can of pinto beans and about 2 cups frozen corn. I add more taco season and use shredded leftover rotisserie chicken as well as canned crushed tomatoes (I add a cup of green chillies). I also add some garlic and usually just skip the bear in favor of chicken broth. It's great with cheese and crushed tortilla chips.

Made this exactly as the recipe is written.  I used Corona beer and doubled it to serve it to my son and his college friends. I now have an empty crockpot (6 qt).  Big thumbs up all around.  Excellent, tasty, easy to make and economical.  We will definitely add this to our rotation.

I used stewed Mexican style tomatoes (halves, not diced) because that's what I had on hand. Also Only had the regular sized 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce so I used the entire can. The beer we keep on hand is Coors Light so that's generally what I put in crockpot recipes. Turned out great. I don't like tomatoes so was good to be able to pick around them! I also cooked on high for half the time and was still great. Husband loved it and he usually turns his nose up at soup. Not that spcy but probably due to the lack of chiles in the tomatoes. Also, read some poor reviews saying they could only taste the beer. Not to be contrary, but there is no way you would taste the beer seperately from the other ingredients unless you did something wrong. Awesome fall meal!!

So good and so delicious. My kids sucked it down faster than I could put it in their bowls. The chips add a really nice crunch. I used fresh, diced tomatoes and I used frozen corn, because we didn't have any canned. We used a Wheat beer, which made it have a nice, smooth flavor. It turned out wonderful!

My family loves this soup. I always want to freeze the extra but it doesn't last that long! I use chicken broth instead of beer but I am sure it would be great with beer, too.
Update: We have made this soup many, many times since my first review. It is still a huge hit, and I now use the beer, which makes it even better. I also use kidney beans instead of chili beans, a drained can of corn or a cup of frozen corn, and I normally use diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes with chilies, just because that is what I normally have on hand.

followed directions exactly, except we used frozen corn instead of canned corn. I think next time I would do half beer, half chicken broth, but the hubby loved it exactly how it is.

This soup is amazing! I followed the ingredients and directions for the most part but made a few changes. I didn't drain any of the canned foods such as the corn and beans. I used a low sodium chicken broth instead of the suggested ingredient, beer. I made it with Heineken last time and it was alright, but it was much tastier with chicken broth. Instead of the soup smell I smelt beer all day long, and it wasn't a very good beer smell. Low sodium broth was great and it didn't make the soup very salty at all, just right actually. I used a whole packet of taco seasoning as suggested but went with low sodium as well. The soup was good enough not to have sour cream, cheese, and tortilla crushed on top but we did have tortilla chips to dip with. We adjusted the recipe to 8 servings. Enjoy!

My friends think I'm a HERO for introducing them to this! It's amazing! The only change I made the second time around what to cut the beer in half and substitute for chicken broth. (My only reason for doing so what with all beer it smelled to me like nothing BUT beer, and I wanted to smell the soup, not just the beer!)

Phenomenal! This was tasteful and delicious.
This makes a ton of soup! I used three chicken breasts, which was plenty. I also used an Old El Paso burrito seasoning mix because I didn't have any taco, and that was great. I added chicken broth instead of the beer, and I think that if I had left it out, this would have been more like a chili. The diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and the natural juices from the chicken would have been enough. I'll leave out the broth next time. Also, to cut down on the sodium content, I will rinse the beans before adding. Used HOT chili beans, and that added some oomph. Great recipe!!

definate 5 stars... I used a pound of hamburger instead of the chicken... I didn't have chicken on hand, and it seemed like more of a struggle. i used a spice mill for the taco seasoning recipe in the reviews by the recipe poster.

This soup is awesome! We love it, especially with sour cream in each bowl. Sometimes, I'll make it without the majority of the liquids and use it as a filling for enchiladas.

This was such a hit in my family.  My boyfriend who didn't want to try it because it has "beans" in it (picky), loved it.

Perfection!  I use chicken broth instead of beer, and I prefer to cook and shred the chicken beforehand instead of letting the chicken cook in the broth and having to pull it out later to shred.  But other than that, make it exactly as directed.  So easy to throw into the crockpot at the beginning of the day and have a great meal waiting for the family by dinnertime.

Yummy and easy!  Only change was to saute onions first, then combine everything.  Cooked on stovetop due to lack of time and it was great!

Sooooo good!  For those of us who live in areas of Canada or other countries that don't carried diced tomatoes with green chilies I have a suggestion for substitution.  Add a cup of salsa (homemade is best).  Works like a charm! :)

My boyfriend and I absolutley love this recipe! From the other reviews, I left the beer out and added 2 cans of chicken broth. I also added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, chili powder, and cumin. (I also add the packet of taco seasoning but it's not enough) I leave out the black beans and use 2 cans of the hot chili beans. So delish!

I used much less chiles than called for and chopped some separately so that the adults could add some to theirs and it would be mild enough for the toddlers. Very yummy!

Wow!  The flavor is amazing on this soup!  But it's crazy hot - that's why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  I will definitely make it again, but I'll cut down on the taco seasoning and the chili next time.  So worth it!

Oh my!  So yummy, warm and satisfying!  SUPER EASY and fast.  My favorite soup is Taco Soup made with beef but this is just as good!  I added some cayenne pepper for a little kick but recipe was made 'as is'.  My mouth is watering as I type this....slurp!

I made a double batch of this soup and there was nothing left!  I made it exactly as stated, just doubled everything. I have made this recipe several times but am just getting around to reviewing it, but this is definitely a keeper in my house.

My household loves this recipe!  Not only is it extremely easy (and the ingredients don't cost an arm and a leg) but the recipe lends itself to being very versatile.  We're a spicy household, so we use the medium and hot versions of the ingredients.  Sometimes I drain the cans to have more of a chunky, stew-like consistency that goes well over rice and that's been a hit, too.

Delicious! Rather than using packaged, I made the taco seasoning, I drained and rinsed cans of black beans and pinto beans, and used original Rotel tomatoes (for canned tomatoes). Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again.

I'm not a big fan of any soup but the pictures of it look so good so i took a chance and cooked this for my family and we loved it!! This is also good for anyone who is on a budget i spent less than $10 on this meal. Thanks for the great recipe i will be making this again.

This recipe was delicious and very filling. I used 1 cup of chicken broth because I did not have beer. The dish came out rather salty for me, but I think it might have been due to the broth, as well as the juices from the other canned items. But overall,  delicious and a huge hit at the house.

I happened upon this recipe when trying to duplicate Chic-fil-a's new Chicken Tortilla soup. Although it isn't like their soup, it is great on its own. I love low maintenance slow cooker recipes and this one is very tasty.

Easy to make and very good.  I like it a bit more spicy so some chili peppers were chopped and put in about the last hour or so.

Hey folks, just thought I'd let you know that I didn't use the beer as I don't drink it and didn't want to buy some just for this recipe.  I used an equal amount of chicken broth and the results were great.  I might use more taco seasoning next time though.

I took this to my daughter's mexican fiesta party and it was a BIG hit!  Many asked for the recipe and nobody could believe how easy it was to prepare. I used chicken broth instead of beer (didn't have any in the house at the time). This is now one of my favorite slow cooker recipes!

Great easy recipe. I always use whatever brand taco seasoning I have in the house and it always turns out great, and I substitute chicken broth for the beer.  I serve it with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheese and it is a favorite of the family now.

Definitely more of a chili than a soup but still delicious! Followed the recipe but used chicken broth rather than beer as many have suggested and I also rinsed the black beans. Instead of pulling the chicken, I just shredded the chicken in the crockpot and let it continue to stew or a couple more hours after. Easy and delicious!

This one was just okay for me.  A little too "taco" tasting for soup in my opinion.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  Maybe I will try it again and cut the taco seasoning and/or chili beans in half.  Too much flavor going on at once!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this today but didnt eat it for dinner since we had 2 power outages lasting over an hour each so it wasnt ready.  Just turned it off and OMG its delicious.  I followed the recipe using the beer and only had 2 chicken breasts which are plenty for me.  I used black beans and pinto beans, could almost use another can of black beans.  I used the original Ro Tel (never used before) its a bit spicy but not too bad but my daughter wont try this so next time I will just use diced tomatoes or just one can of Ro Tel.  Cant wait for dinner tomorrow this is a keeper for me!  Its after 11 pm and I want a bowl now :)  Will make some corn bread and rice to go with it.  Might even go with a polenta ?

Great Recipe, I would leave out the beer. I made it with the beer (miller lite) and i did not care for the taste after i added the beer. And we are Beer drinkers and love the taste of beer! Gives it a bitter taste. It's still good with the beer but i think it would be GREAT with the beer left out. I also used Bill echols taco seasoning from this website.

I love it just as it is written, as long as I do go to the extra step of making Bill Echols seasoning instead of using packaged.  It’s still good with packaged, but truly no comparison to the real thing.  Also have always used Corona beer.  I’m trying Dos Equus this time ‘cause it’s what was in the fridge.  Long as it’s a good Mexican beer, it should do the job.  We LOVE this soup and so does everyone we feed it to!

I loved the flavor of this soup. I followed some suggestions and used Bill Echol's Taco Seaoning recipe from this site. I also took 4 white flour tortillas, basted both sides with lime juice and sprinkled sea salt on them.  Then I sliced them into thin strips with a pizza cutter, and baked them in the oven until crispy, tossing occasionally. We used these to top the the soup along with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Delicious!

Very similar to the Weight Watchers recipe that uses ground turkey and ranch dressing mix.  We add some chipotle hot sauce to liven it up a bit.  I made it with less green chilis so my kids would eat it.  They loved it with chips and cheese (yea!).  Very easy to put in the crock pot and have ready for a quick meal when you are on the go!

Loved it!  This dish was easy to prepare and a hit with the whole family.  It's really a "chicken" chili, but just a bit lighter and just enough variation to alternate with other Tex Mex menus.  It'll definitely be in our rotation, especillay for the winter months.  I made it using a 2.5 lb bag of frozen chicken tenders.  I doubled everything else except the diced tomatoes since my son doesn't like too much chunky tomato.  I put the frozen tenders in after everything else was mixed in the crockpot.   The chicken was ready to shred after 5 hours on low.  My crew was so anxious to eat that we only let it simmer another 1 hr before eating and everyone enjoyed.  I used the homemade taco seasoning recommended below and it was plenty tasty and spicy.  We'll use it going forward rather than pre-packaged stuff.  BTW, I DID include the beer....happened to have a local brew on hand, Billy's Chilies (from Boulder, CO) which turned out to be the perfect complement.   But, just in case, I only added one bottle along with 12 oz water.  I'll definitely use beer again, but then I've been adding beer to my chili for many years and folks have always loved it!  I do think, however, that the beer you choose will either work with the soup OR stand out unfavorably, so choose carefully.  I keep a few varieties on hand to use in Tex Mex dishes and BBQ pork.  Anyway, don't give up on the beer...it can enhance!!

I love this soup. I've made it for family and friends and they always get the recipe. I also dice avocado to with the sour cream, tortilla chips, and diced raw onion and greated cheese. Hubby loves raw onion even though cooked onions are in it.

This is a family favorite.  We all like spicy, so increased to taco seasoning to 1/4 C.  It continuously gets rave results.

More of a chili than soup. I love that I had most everything on hand. I made this in the slow cooker. I substituted 6 skinless drumsticks for the breast meat, 1 1/2 c water for the beer, and a 10 oz can of tomatoes w half a can of chiles. I didn't add the onion either. I agree the seasoning previously mentioned added the flavor. My husband who is not a chili fan ate two bowls. Will make again.

I made this soup today, but on the stove top instead of the crockpot...didn't have enough time for the crockpot. It came out with less liquid I'm sure because some cooked off in the pot whereas no liquid cooks off in the crockpot. When I first took a taste right out of the pot, I wasn't sure what I thought of the broth. I did substitute chicken broth as I don't keep beer on hand. It had plenty of zing..no problem there. I used Rotel tomatoes & plenty of the good taco seasoning everyone talks about on here. I think the different flavor was because I didn't rinse my beans, it just gives a different flavor. All that liquid from cooking beans is full of nutrients!  

Anyway, then I got the idea this would be great on brown rice. I took some cooked brown rice out that I keep in the freezer, thawed in the microwave & scooped the soup/stew over it & it was WONDERFUL. Not to mention one plate was so filling! It ended up being lunch & dinner. 

I think this will be a go to recipe for me as I have been trying to eat a lot more rice & beans. Beans are at the top of this list right under veggies & fruits to have the highest vitamins & minerals for the lowest calories. So they are a perfect food to fill up on!

My 11 year old daughter made this today and it was outstanding.  She made a few changes to match ingredients we had in hand.  She used browned ground beef in place of the chicken and chicken broth instead of the beer.  We always use plain greek yogurt in place of sour cream and provolone instead of cheddar.  It was wonderful!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome! I came across this recipe to late to put it in the crock pot so I just cooked it on the stove top. We do not drink so therefor I did not have any beer in the house. I used chicken broth instead of the beer. My husband said that it was the BEST soup that he has tasted in a long time. Thanks for sharing!

As a mom of 8 children, dinner can be a little tricky at times.  Surprisingly, my WHOLE family loved this soup!  My husband even said it is in his top 3  meals.  I'll have to try it again... just to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  : )

(I also used chicken broth instead of beer)

This was an absolutely fabulous recipe! I've made it twice already and it has yet to disappoint. Rather than use the beer, I used 12 oz of chicken broth and it was still phenomenal. I'm sure that this will be one to keep in my recipe book forever!

EXCELLENT!  I loved this dish.  I also used ground beef and beef broth instead of chicken and beer.  I added the additional spices recommended by a previous reviewer (cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, red pepper).  It was so good!  I can't wait to try it again...maybe this time with chicken :-)

Excellent!  I prepared this for the first time the day of a dinner party.  I was a bit fearful that it might not be fancy enough as an entree so I made it the first course.  Everyone loved it, asked for the recipe which I still have not given up.  Very good in fact, I just prepared it again for the family tonight.  I love crock pot cooking this is no hastle and healthy and very good.

My family LOVED this!  I didn't have beer and substitutued chicken broth.  Also, I wasn't home, so I cooked it for 7 hours on low and cut up the chicken before serving.  I used 2 1/2 T of homemade taco seasoning from this website.  My son loved it so much, he has requested this be a permanent Tuesday night supper!  :)

My husband pretty much lost his mind when I served this!  I haven't seen him enjoy a soup this much in FOREVER!  lol   I did some of the mods suggested: broth instead of beer, added cumin, more taco seasoning AND I accidentally opened a can of plain dicded tomatoes, so I added them in there as well.  As I was preparing the soup, I discovered that I did not have anymore tomato sauce so I used tomato soup... it was fine, but the next I make it will be with the sauce.   I think also the next time, I will dice up some onions from my garden to add in there.   Instead of  tortilla chips, I cut flour tortillas into strips with the pizza cutter and floated them on top of the soup with the cheese.  It added a nice texture to the soup, like an enchilada ...  Will be making this again per request!

This recipe can not be rated with only 5 stars, it needs endless. This recipe has been a life saver for me more than one time. It has an ingredient list that I usually have most of in my cupboards and it is a huge hit with my family and friends as well. IT is a great soup to put on in the winter and come home to after a day outside or at work. 
The only change that I make is no beans. My husband cant eat beans so I make it without and it is still just a good as if it had them. I also add extra onion and a n extra envelope of taco seasoning. 
AMAZING RECIPE, Thank you!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I've made it a few times since I found it a couple weeks ago....totally addicted!

When making it, I actually didn't add the beer. I'm not a beer drinker and felt that it was a bit unnecessary. It came out AMAZING! Since I didn't add the beer, my soup was more like a thick chili. To thin it out, I'd probably add another can of tomato sauce. But I liked the hearty thickness it had. 

I will definitely be making this again and again. Friends loved it as well!

OK, you recipe purist, don't beat me up to badly for changing the recipe.  I only did it so I could use what I had on hand.  I didn't have any chicken breast, but I did have two large cans of white chicken from Sam's Club, so I added it towards the end of cooking, and I used chicken broth instead of beer.  We loved this!  I wil certainly be making this again!

Great recipe for a winter warm up. I chose to make it more soupy and added chicken stock and tomato juice and omitted the beer. A healthy alternative to canned soup. Very easy.

This soup was great.  I did make Bill Echols taco seasoning. It was too easy not to. Used chicken broth instead of the beer.  I used 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies and 1 can Rotel with habaneros. Omitted the tomato sauce because I didn't want the thickness it would give. Topped it off with cheese, sour cream and chips. Next night I drained off the liquid and used the meat and beans rolled in flour tortilla's topped with cheese and heated in oven till cheese was melted. Yummy.

This is FABULOUS!!! WE made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a huge hit.  There was none left.  The soup has great flavor and it is really almost chili like.  This will be added to my monthly dinners rotation.  PS this was also super simple

I might as well add my review to the 3000 plus people who love this!  I did as well.  As one other review stated they were not sure about adding the beer.....I wasn't either as I hate beer.  The combination of all the ingredients tasted great!  Super easy and delicious.

Given all the great reviews, I was really expecting to LOVE this!  Unfortunately, I felt that the taco seasoning (I used a pkg, not the recommended recipe shown here, so maybe that was my mistake?!?) added an odd flavor to the 'chili' that I just couldn't get past.  I did not use beer - but chicken broth, instead.  I think this recipe is a great starter/base, but the seasoning just isnt right for me. =(

I have to Rave about this recipe! It was Delicious! We added cheddar cheese on top, crushed tortilla chips and cubed avacado once it was ready to serve.  It was To Die For! Lots of flavor...Much, MUCH better than I expected it to be.  We will be having this one Lots!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a soup-cookoff at work and won!!  Everyone loved it.  I made it pretty much as is - expcept I did rinse the kidney beans and I added a can of rinsed black beans.  I drained the liquid from the corn.  I also used two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes that had chilies in them - instead of two cans regular diced tomatoes and and a can of chilies.  Like others I added a package of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing - but I used the Spicy variety which added to the "kick".  The tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream topped it off.  I added less water than it called for because I like think soup.  A little less than a can.

Excellent!  I've made this over and over again.  It's so easy and delicious.  And filling. The only change I make is to substitute chicken broth for the beer.  (I used beer the first time I made it, and it sort of overpowered the other flavors).  If anyone out there is counting Weight Watchers points, I divide this into 9 servings and share it with a couple of friends - it comes out to 7 Points Plus per serving (without the garnishes).

This stuff is awesome!  Couldn't be easier.  The chicken breasts I used were huge, so I threw in an extra can of beans and an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I tried it with sourcream but preferred it without,  (serve it on the side).

Excellent! Perfect meal for a cold evening. Warms straight to the bone and is hearty. Very simple to prepare and versatile. Like mine extra spicy so threw in lots of cayenne pepper along with cilantro and tarragon. I can't believe how easily the chicken shredded. Mmmm....loved the cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream on top too! Thanks - this one's a keeper for sure!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet since I usually make it two or three times a month at my sons request. This one is definitely at the top of his favorites list, and I'm pretty fond of it myself.
I do replace the corn with a can of hominy and the beer with chicken broth, other than that I usually stick to the recipe except to make it on the stove once in a while. It's a great last minute, quick to the table dinner (less than 30 min.) even when I fail to prepare and get it all in the crockpot before work.

This was excellent and so easy! I decided to make it on my lunch break from work and take it an hour's drive that night. I had most of the ingredients on hand and made it in a 4-quart crockpot that was filled. I used one chicken breast and one tender (anything more would have been too much for my pot), dried onion, only one can of diced tomatoes (with basil and oregano... used Rotel sauce with chilies) and left out the beer. I used chicken bullion and water to compensate for leaving the beer out, but I would've been okay without it - just a little more like a chili. I also added a Hidden Valley ranch seasoning packet and a dash of chili powder and I think it gave it more flavor. I cooked on low for 5 hours, shredded the chicken, then drove 1.5 hours with it and cooked it on high for another hour or so. I ate it with crackers and shredded cheese.

This tasted amazing and was so easy to make. It got rave reviews... Perfect for a cold rainy day! It would be great to make in big batches and freeze or to customize using different beans.

I have made this frequently for the past 10 years!  
I have used, beer, and substituted lemon lime soda, lemon carbonated water,  Chicken broth and chicken stock for the beer. 
It is filling delicious and adaptable for dietary restrictions.  example: I do not add corn.  I often use chicken strips cut into bite size pieces. 
I highly recommend this recipe.
Make a double batch and freeze the leftovers.  I use single serve containers, great for lunches.

I have to give this 5 stars!!!!  Other than substituting chicken broth for the beer I followed exactly and it is fantastic!  I took it to work for Crockpot Monday (doubled the recipe) and I got two thumbs up from everyone!  Licked the pot clean and wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make again.

Loved it!!! I followed the recipe almost to the letter. I used chicken stock instead of the beer due to niece being a new nursing mother. Next time I will use the beer. Cooked it for 2 1/2 hrs on high because I started late. Turned it to low and shredded the chicken. Cooked for 2 more hours. After letting it cool, put in refrigerator for the next day. 
The next day heated a serving as the rest was going to niece's house. It tasted too sweet to me. I do not know if it was the corn, tomato sauce or what. Anyway, I added 3 soup spoons of liquid from a jar of Tostitos Restaurant Style Salsa - medium. Once it was warmed, I added the sour cream and ate it with taco chips. It was perfect. YUM YUM!!!

I made for super bowl as it was good - I'm only giving it 4 stars because I thought it could use a bit more bite (spice) and I've had others that are just as good.  I thought it could use more juice altho' it filled my crockpot to the brim.  And I found 2 chick breasts were plenty - guess it depends of the size of one's breasts !  I will try again with some options !

Very yummy, satisfying and easy soup! I followed the recipe as written and used a microbrew (Mirror Pond by Deschutes Brewery). I topped it with sharp and pepperjack cheeses as well as sour cream, cilantro and taco shells I already had in the pantry. Will certainly make again!

OMG!!!! This is the best recipe I've ever tried from this website and quite possibly from the entire internet! The soup tastes incredible and even looks incredible. I had nearly everything right in my pantry so no trips to the store for any ingredients that you'd use once and then never use again.  I only made 2 modifications but only because I knew they wouldn't impact flavor.  I used 2 cans of black of beans (that's all I had in the pantry) and since I didn't have the canned tomatoes with chilies, I used two 10 ounce cans of tomato sauce and a can of chopped chilies.  Perfect!  I also used Patti's recipe for the seasoning - again, I had it all right in the pantry anyway.  The flavor of this soup is so fabulous!  I used Molson beer as that's what was in the refrig for our superbowl party but I think any decent beer would be fine.  I would stay away from heavier beers but the Molson did not give it any kind of "off" taste as a few others have mentioned.  I thought it was fabulous just as is.  I know this review is long, but I just can't say enough wonderful things about the soup.  I can't wait to make it again!!  I'd give this soup 10 stars if I could!  And Patti -- I'm going to be following all the recipes that you post from now on!!!  Thanks for this keeper!

VERY BUDGET FRIENDLY!!! OMG!!!! This was sooooo Good!
I added an extra can of corn & an extra can of Chili Beans Plus chicken Broth. That way it would Fill up both my 2.5 quart Crockpots. I think it would even be Good With rice added too if your on a Budget. I Used Frozen Boneless Chicken thighs to cook in the crockpot.
 I also added More Meat From an 4 pieces of Fried chicken at the last minute too for some extra protien.
so Freaking good!

I agree with the others who said to use chicken stock instead of beer. The beer gives it a funny taste so I strained it and added canned chicken stock. I added some fresh onion when I ate it rather than while cooking it and topped it with sharp cheddar cheese. Was delicious. I made baked corn chips and ate some with the soup. Will definitely be making this again.

Easy and delicious! I made it per directions with a few minor changes. I added a can of red kidney beans and a stalk of celery, used chicken broth (not beer) and after shredding the chicken I decided to add fresh cauliflower. I think this is a very forgiving recipe and I will use it again and again. It tastes even better the next day and I froze some to share with my mom the next time I visit.

Really, really good.  We ate it over saffron rice and also used it in a quesadilla maker between two flour tortillas.  Excellent that way.  Just remember to add shredded cheese!  Loved the homemade taco seasoning.  Will make this again.

Really good and super easy... anyone with a can opener can do it!  BUT! definitely had a beer taste to it that my kids were a bit put off by.  Next time I'll use less beer and maybe use some chicken broth instead, but there WILL be a next time!

Yum-O!  Everyone loved it, including my picky kids!  I used 4 breasts instead of 3 (my husband is big on eating MEAT for dinner), a total of 3 cans of diced tomatoes, and a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies.  I didn't drain the canned corn either. We used all the (optional) toppings and I chopped avocados for the topping as well.  So easy for weeknight dinner!!!  Hooray!!!

Very good...however, my chicken was not done at the proper time noted so I cooked an additional 2 hours on high then shredded.  This makes a lot of soup to be sure you read the servings!  Very yummy.

I think turned out really good!  I also think it's more like 10 servings...not 8 serving.  With this division to 10 servings....this is 5 Weight Watchers Points (on the 2012 Points Plus Program).  Lots of flavor - you don't need to waste calories on the cheese or the tortillas or the sour cream.
 
RECIPE CHANGES:
* I added two diced green zuccinis. 
* I drained and rinsed the black beans - not sure if you were supposed to, but I did.
* I did NOT drain the chili beans - not sure if you were supposed to, but I did NOT.
* Used Coors Light

Love this soup!  Made it exactly the way the recipe calls it and it received rave reviews from family and friends.  I used Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe which is wonderful!  Kudos to you Patti and thanks for sharing! :)

Delicious! I made a few changes based on taste preferences: no corn, more veggies (bell peppers, fresh tomatoes). Also used the following spices instead of the seasoning packet to minimize sodium: chili powder, cumin, ground oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and a touch of garlic salt.

This was really good, I just added a little more chicken. Also I have a dry house so I used chicken broth instead of beer. This was still awesome!

Excellent... I did not add the beer, we had none on hand, but it was still excellent.  I made too much but it was too good to toss the leftovers so I froze it. I thawed it out and ate it tonight. My husband said, "I hope you kept this recipe".

By far hands down the best taco soup I've made.  Only made a couple of changes.  I didn't drain the corn (missed that note) and I used left over taco meat instead of chicken.  I also didn't use the tacos seasoning because my meat was already seasoned.  Super easy and way good!

this was sooo good! i wasn't expecting it either. i'd call it watery chili, still it tasted pretty delicious. i'll definitely make it again, and cut back on the liquid. didn't even need any garnish for this.

Wow! I made this today and when I came home, I could smell it from the driveway!!
We couldn't wait to dig in! 

I made it soupy not chili-like. I kept the oregano, but I also added extra cumin and extra broth... I added chili powder and some smoked paprika (our favorite spice!). I only used 1 can of tomatoes/green chilis because it's usually too spicy for our kids. I used Bud light lime, because it's what I had on hand.
My husband, who is the very best chef I know, said it is now his very favorite soup! Now THAT'S a compliment!

A really quick and simple recipe! It came out great and literally took little effort. Followed the recipe but I didn't have the beer so I substituted it for chicken stock and it tasted great.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Better yet, my family loves it even more.  As with others, I used chicken broth instead of beer, but that was the only alteration.  This soup will definitely help stave off the bitter cold winter we're having this year!

This soup had a delicious aroma and flavor! It was a little spicy for us, though. Next time, I will use canned diced tomatoes without the chilies and see if that helps. Otherwise, a great dish! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious.  I omitted the beer, as I dislike the flavour it gives food, and simply used chicken broth.  Definitely a recipe I will use in the future!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  I started late in the evening so I put all the ingrediants in my crockpot and laid 3 chicken breast on top.  I let it cook on low all night.  It smelled so good!  When I got up I sredded the chicken which was so easy.  It tasted amazing with the tortilla chips crushed in the bowl and shredded cheddar cheese on top.  I then added a dollop of sour cream.  My boyfriend and I ate it for breakfast and dinner.  Thank goodness we have letovers.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was tasty and easy.  My daughter loved it and she spent the whole morning looking at it funny thinking it would turn out horrible.  She says her new favorite food is chicken taco soup.  I did substitue chicken broth for the beer and added a few extra cans of beans and an extra chicken breast.  Lots of leftovers!! I love leftovers!!

Excellent stew!  Family loves it.  The only changes I make, subsitute 2 cups of chicken broth in place of beer, and add 2 more cans of different kinds of beans (kidney and navy beans in addition to the black beans and chili beans).  One hour before serving add 1 cup of fresh chopped cilantro and let it simmer in the stew before serving.  This is KEY to finishing it off!!  Fabulous!

Absolutely delicious!  A hit every time and very easy to make! We love beans so I also add a can of kidney and pento beans.  I also substitute chicken broth for the beer per the other reviews.  I have noticed that the cooking time isn't as long as suggested.  I take the chicken out to shred it after around 4 hours and then it only needs another hour or so.  This is phenomenal.... must try!

This was amazing.  Make sure to use a 6 or 7 quart crockpot.  My 4 quart could not hold the recipe as written.  It was delicious!  I used Bill Echols' taco seasoning.  This can't be beat.

This was a very simply and tasty soup. I might use chicken broth instead of beer next time.

I had a hard time debating on how many stars to rate this.  I absolutely HATE beer, and I do not know too much about it.  I used whatever beer I had in my fridge the first time I made it.  BIG MISTAKE i guess.  It was Bud Light, and now Im reading some reviews that say the type of beer makes the difference.  Well then that should have been stated in the recipe, because it turned out quite disgusting for us.  We could clearly taste the beer.  Well my husband didn't know I put it in, but he asked what the weird taste was and after I told him he said he could taste it and refused to eat it.  I tried with the chicken broth the next time and it was DELICIOUS!!! 5 stars delicious.  But I am rating it 3 stars because I feel it deserves criticism for not being specific on the beer.  I personally will not try with beer anymore because the chicken broth was so good.  It is one of our favorite meals!!!  BTW if i rated this on how it tasted with the beer I would probably rate it a 1 star or 2.  Thats how nasty it was to us.

This soup is absolutely PHENOMENAL. Every time I make a batch, numerous people HOUND me to bring them a bowl or more: I am lucky if I end up with more than a serving for myself! I make the chicken broth version minus the beans, and usually end up adding more chili powder and paprika for taste and a little bit of sugar just to counter the tartness.

There needs to be a warning on this recipe for being EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!!! I have wandered out to the crock pot many times with a tortilla chip in hand just for another small taste...

This soup was really good, my family loved it.  I accidentally put in to many red pepper flakes so I had to add more black beans, tomato sauce and corn.  Will definitely add to the monthly rotation.

This is the most amazing soup recipe on this website! KUDOS! However, I do make a few changes just based on my own personal preferences; I add a chopped green bell pepper and about 3 minced garlic cloves, only half of an onion, I use pinto beans instead of kidney beans, and I use about 1 cup of chicken stock instead of the bottle of beer (I made it with beer the first time and it made a lot of "broth" - the flavor, however, is not much different). Also, I add whatever spices sound good that morning; garlic salt, cumin, paprika, chili powder, etc. Overall an AMAZING recipe! If my crock pot was larger, I'd double it every time!

This recipe can easily be modified to suit your preference in heat level. Very economical! I made this and served huge portions to ten hungry co-workers. A wonderful cold-weather meal.

This soup is really good and got really good reviews from everyone that ate it.  I'll definitely make it again.  I made the following changes to this recipe:  added 1 can of pinto beans, 1/2 can of low-sodium chicken broth, two tablespoons of chopped jalapeno, 2 cloves of garlic, 4-5 drops of tapatio, pinch of salt & pepper and instead of taco seasoning, I used cumin and chili powder.  I also served it with shredded cheese, chopped green onion and 5-layer bean dip.  With the addition of these items, I would definitely give it a 5*.

This dish is great. It's super easy to make. It's a very versatile dish. I make it thick like a chili. I like to cube the chicken just for a better consistency. I serve it in a taco bowl with shredded lettuce, cheese and sour cream. You can also use it as taco filling. Just put it in a flour tortilla with some cheese and grill it.

I'm making it a again today and added some enchilada sauce. I'm 4 hours in cooking it and it smells so good! Thank you for this recipe!

I just made this today...and we will be sitting down to eat in less than a half hour and I have tasted it, and tried to doctor it up and honestly am not looking forward to serving this to my husband! I have a MUCH better chicken chili recipe, and this is more chili than taco soup...but is far inferior to the straight up chili recipe. Like other reviewers have said....it doesn't even make the house smell good, like most (all) slow cooker recipes. Furthermore I used Miller beer (which is not even very beer-y) and I can taste/smell the strong beer scent (and I LOVE beer cheese soup) but this is off putting. I will NOT be making this again...and am some what bewildered as to what I will do with 8 servings! (probably more now since I put in some chicken stock to dilute the strong beer taste). :(

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I have been craving tortilla soup ever since my family and I went to a local mexican restaurant and had some. I left out the beer and used frozen corn instead of canned and it turned out fantastic. I cooked it on high for approx 2 1/2 hrs instead of the recommended 5hrs and everything was still delicious. 

Highly recommend! Will definitely make again.

Super yummy!  I did make a few substitutions based on my pantry.  Used chicken thighs, subbed chicken stock for beer, used regular pinto beans for the chili beans because I couldn't find gluten-free chili beans then added extra taco spice to make up for it,  and let it cook more like 10 hours because that was when we all finally got home for the day.
That soup was fantastic, and made delicious leftovers for lunch the next day.  Thank you for such a yummy easy soup!!

I made some slight changes like using white kidney beans instead of black beans, adding 1tsp garlic powder, 1/2tsp cumin. I also cooked it for 4.5hrs on high. The whole family LOVED this, which is surprising because one of our sons doesn't do spicy.

We all loved this! It did not have a distinct beer flavor and all the ingredients combined for a great soup. My kids loved it and it was super easy. I added a little bit of cumin as people suggested. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Really good!

Great recipe! I added Bud Lite Lime for the beer, and also added spicy ranch dressing mix. The flavor was incredible!

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. I am always looking for easy weekday recipes and it doesn't get any easier than this. The only thing I changed was chicken broth instead of the beer and I used chicken breast tenders. I will definitely make this again.

made it slightly different than the recipe, left out the onions, beer and extra tomato sauce, added some water and some leftover salsa verde I had on hand. Also used leftover grilled chicken that had a chipotle lime marinade on it and some extra spices. Served with cilantro lime rice as well as the optional ingredients listed in the recipe. Yum!

I prepared this with the recipe for Bill Echols Taco seasoning (as RaisinKane suggested) and it came out tasting a lot like chili.  Not bad for chili, but not really what I was expecting.  I also substituted chicken broth for the beer.  I probably won't make this again.

I used the taco seasoning recommended and used chicken broth instead of beer. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste and mixed with water to get a cup. I put the cilantro in at the end and topped with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Super good and easy!

A very flavorful, easy soup. I was serving two people so I had to scale back on the amount. I added 3 T of homemade "Taco Seasoning I", from this website, with chopped onions and 2 cloves of fresh, chopped garlic. Instead of 1 can of whole kernel corn I used 4 fresh, sweet corn on the cob. I added the can of GOYA black beans, rinsed, 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles and a can of chili with beans. I chose to use a 6 ounce can of tomato paste with a little chicken stock in place of the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I was looking for a nice hearty soup, not too thin but with a little more thicker consistency. The tomato paste made the soup a darker red color and didn't change the taste-only helped to thickened up a bit. I threw in a sprig of cilantro for flavor. I poured Corona into the crock pot and placed in 2 chicken breasts which I pressed down into the sauce. The aroma was so wonderful as this was cooking that it made my mouth water. This soup is not watery, but tasty and hearty with just the right amount of beans and fresh sweet corn. The chicken was so tender-it fell apart. The seasoning was just right, not too spicy -thanks to Bil Echols for his taco seasoning recipe.  Before serving the soup, I removed the cilantro. I served the soup with a dollop of sour cream, a squeeze of lime juice, and cilantro for garnish. A match was made in heaven with this soup and "Absolute Mexican Cornbread, from this website. (The cornbread is very sweet and tasty by the way.)

I made this for my boyfriend and he LOVED it!  Next time I'll use only 2 chicken breasts and add more chili beans.  The chicken I used happen to be huge so 3 was just a little too much.

SO GOOD. This soup/chili comes together insanely easily (lots of cans of vegetables), and turns out INCREDIBLE. My boyfriend who never gets terribly excited about food said he actually prefers it to chili, and I'd agree.

Will most definitely make this over and over again. Thanks!!

This is very good. Really easy to make and taste wonderful. I have made this with pre-cooked chicken from the store and uncooked chicken. Both ways turned out wonderful. I use a can of green chilies also for a just a little kick.

This is the best taco soup recipe ever. The only difference I make it so switch out beer for chicken broth. I just do not have beer around and it tastes great without it. Goes perfectly with corn bread and butter!

Loved it!  Very easy and delicious.  I made the following substitutions due to not having some ingredients on hand: used chicken broth instead of beer, used 6oz tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, used 28oz crushed tomatoes instead of the suggested tomatoes, used onion powder instead of onions.  The 3 toppings suggested make it extra good.  I will definitely make this again!

I have made this soup a few times and it is amazing.  I find that I crave it from time to time.  I make in on the stovetop with grilled or boiled chicken.  One of these days I will have to try it in the slow cooker.  Very tasty just the same.

I enjoyed this soup but made a few modifications! I did replace the beer with chicken broth and I used a rotisserie chicken instead of breast and diced 3 garlic cloves. Also, I cooked this on the stove for 1 1/2 hours instead of slow cooker. This had alot of flavor! I am let 2 girlfriends try my leftovers and they wanted the recipe too!

Definitely needs spices like cumin and chili powder but once those are added...superb! Only thing I changed are using pinto beans instead of black beans because of personal preference and I only used half of a chopped onion because a whole one seemed like way too much.

This is a keeper! I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I love a recipe where the only real prep is chopping an onion and opening some cans. I used Corona for the beer even though I'm not a beer fan, and could definitely taste it but in a very good way - I think it gives an extra something that chicken broth wouldn't. Perfect with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream, and if you get tired of soup leftovers, it is thick enough that you can strain the broth out of some of it for brilliant taco or enchilada filling. Love it - thanks!

I followed the recipe closely and took other reviewers advice about the extra cumin and garlic powder.  I really liked it.  I thought the beer really added depth to the soup and complimented the sour cream and Mexican shredded cheese we added as toppings.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely make it again.

This wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. The flavor was your typical chili flavor and not unique. I won't make this again.

This was SUPER easy and absolutely amazing! My 3 yr. old even ate her entire bowl full. I didn't have the tomatoes with green chilies on hand so I substituted with regular canned tomatoes and a can of green chili enchilada sauce.

This had SO much flavor and so delicious!!!!  I used cheddar cheese, cilantro, and crushed tortilla chips as the garnish.  I used a can of diced tomatoes then a separate can of hot diced chilies.  My daughter ate all of her's which is a miracle lately!  Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly, EXCEPT I cooked on high for 4 hrs then shredded chicken and cooked for 1 more hour (I was anxious to try it!). It turned out fantastic! I might add an additional chicken breast next time to thicken it a bit more, although it's almost thick enough now (stewish). Used 1 can coors light. Couldn't taste the beer flavor, unlike what other people have said.  I was very pleased, and so were the 3 boys I live with! Success! :-)

This was very tasty!  i took a lot of the reviewers advice and used 12 oz of chicken broth instead of beer (even though i love beer :) i followed the recipe almost completely, except i rinsed and drained both cans of beans, and i also added one small can of herdez salsa(along with the two cans of diced tom. w/grn chilies).  i also added garlic and cilantro, because i had some and i love it!  topped with shredded mexican blend cheese and crumbled tortilla chips.  very tasty indeed!  in a pinch, this could be made on the stove with shredded canned chicken, though in the crock pot the flavors have a nice long time to marry.....yum!  Thanks for the recipe!  This would be great camping!

Love this recipe, it's great as it is. Only change i made was sub beer w/ chicken broth.  It is also easy to customize to your own taste. The bill echols taco seasoning is the best. Just be careful it can get pretty spicy so start out with a little and continue adding the spice until desired taste.

My husband liked it. Used a good beer... Full Sail Amber Ale. I think the beer muted all the yummy flavors. I was disappointed. Will have to freeze or give away most of the soup.

Made recipe as directed except used 2-15oz cans tomato w/green chilis (store didn't have 10oz size).  Was kinda worried about using beer since many of the best reviews used chicken broth but decided to make recipe as directed.  I used Smithwick's beer and the recipe turned out great.  I will be making this again and again -- especially if it freezes well.

To me this recipe is nothing special, and I'm surprised at the great reviews. I thought it tasted like thin chili. Even though I don't like beer, I followed the recipe exactly and added it. I should have used chicken broth instead, because I don't think the beer added a good flavor to the soup. Even my husband, who likes beer, wasn't crazy about it. It didn't taste bad, but it's probably not worth making again. Maybe it would be better with broth instead of beer.

I made this for Super Bowl and the pot was finished with rave reviews.  My husband absolutely raved about it for days.  The only change I made was a can of chicken broth instead of beer.  The toppings really make this soup!!!  I will definitely make this many more times.

This came out really good.  I only had 1 14oz can ofsome canned tomatoes, used the taco seasoning on this site that was recommended, added a can of kidney beans and a box of chicken stock. I also threw some of the broth in a blender to take out some of the chunks (like the onions that floated to the top) to make it more kid friendly and it was awsome. We are experiencing a VERY cold snap here in TX and it hit the spot!

The seasonings were dead on in this recipe.  I went with items I had on hand..8 boneless skinless chix thighs, Trader Joe's Fire Roasted Corn and Fire Roasted Diced Tomates with Chipotle Peppers.  I also subbed the beer with chix broth.  Be sure to use the taco seasoning the author included in HER review.  I did not use nachos but served with home made cornbread.  So delicous.  Will try making with ground turkey and turkey sausage for an alternative.

LOVE this recipe.  The first time I made it I used beer as it calls for, however my family didn't care for it much.  The next time I omitted the beer and just used water and a little chicken broth and they LOVED it.  We now make it once a week!  SO easy and delicious

Not really impressed with this one. Soup retained the beer taste. I used Hefewitzen beer so perhaps another choice would have been better.

This recipe was incredible. We followed the recipe and made a few slight changes. Instead of beer I used a can of chicken broth. Beer just didnt sound good to me in this dish. The cans of diced tomatoes and chilies can be found in your local grocery store, its a can with both of them combined, we bought the Rotel MILD brand of tomatoes with green chilies because we are not big fans of spicy foods. This provided just enough mild spice. I used onion powder because I didn't have an onion in the fridge, but I am sure this does not make much of a difference. We used the Ortega taco seasoning brand. We didnt use any sour cream or tortilla chips, but when you serve it, top it with some shredded cheddar cheese. This makes the dish.  Other than that I made the recipe exactly as shown, other than the fact that I cooked it on a higher setting in about half the time because I was not home all day.  We ate it up and it was DELICIOUS. Definitely will be making this again and have shared the recipe with others. THANKS!!

I have now made this twice.  The first time was some time back and I remember it tasting very beery.  I decided to try it again and this time it was great!  Not beery at all.  I used Bud Light (not sure what I used the 1st time so that could be the difference) and "mild" Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  Wow, it is spicy, but not too much for us!  I used Ancho chili powder which is a mild to medium spicy chili.  Honestly, I don't think I would change a thing.  We used greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and that cut the spiciness just enough for us.  The only other thing I would suggest is to serve with diced avocados on top!  That would really smooth this out.  Thanks for a great recipe!  One other thing...I did use Bill Echols taco seasoning mix.

Super easy to make and tastes delicious. I cooked it all in a big pot on the stove instead of using a slowcooker as my slowcooker is really small.

This one is definitely a keeper, at least as far as my mad for Tex-Mex food husband is concerned. I made it exactly as described except that for "chili beans" I subbed pinto beans. Also, it wasn't specified in the recipe, but I did drain the beans as I find the pot likker from black beans particularly can be rather unwholesome in appearance. "Beer" is rather a broad category, I used our favorite American style lager (Yuengling Traditional) which is similar in taste and appearance to some Mexican beers.

Great recipe.  I had to improvise with what I had on hand.  I made this on the stove because I used a rotisserie chicken that I shred.  I didn't use  beer because I'm not a big fan of the taste.  I didn't really want a soup and wanted something more like chili, so I only replaced the beer with half a can of chicken stock.  I also sauteed the onions and a red pepper with fresh garlic that I chopped up for extra taste and texture.  I only used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilies (that still had a decent kick).  I omitted the tomato sauce.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but it was all very minor stuff.  After 2hrs on the stove on low....my husband loved it!  The recipe has a lot of flexibility, and is so easy and good.

This dish was amazing! I was skeptical at first because it had such a strong smell, but the taco flavoring was nice and mild.  I used a small bag of frozen corn in place of the canned and added an extra can of black beans.  I love the addition of beer to the recipe it gave the soup a much rounder flavor as opposed to using water or stock.  This is definately a "do again" dish! Thank you for posting it!

This was great!  I was worried about the spicyness of the chilies so I bought mild, but next time I will definitely buy regular or even hot, this soup can stand the heat.  Also I forgot to add in the onion and it still tastes WONDERFUL!  Doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in my 6.5 quart crockpot.

Delicious! I used organic kidney beans instead of chili beans and reduced sodium chicken broth in place of the beer. Served with avocado, cheese, sour cream and corn chips. So good on a cold day!

This is an excellent slow cooker recipe. We made a few adjustments as other reviewers have suggested. We substituted chicken broth for the beer and seasoned with fresh cilantro, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. We used pepper jack cheese to add at the end and the soup came out pretty spicy. It made a lot and was very filling.

This recipe is fabulous! So easy & so delicious. I read several reviews & decided to cook it for 8-10 hours & the chicken just fell apart.  We are a spice loving crowd so I added fresh jalapeños (as well as spicy versions of the taco seasoning & diced tomatoes & chilies)  & it was terrific.  My family ate every bite & wanted more!

This was delicious! My family asked for more. I would use twice the liquids next time in order to have more juice. I also used Mexicorn and believe it added just a bit more zing!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! I call it soup, my son calls it chilli. Either way it was wonderful and perfect for a cold night. Probably my new favourite soup.

This recipe is good and there is no taste of beer for those who dislike it.  I would reccomend putting in chick broth or stock to make it more like soup than stew.

Someone else made this soup and I loved it. I don't know if she made any changes to it. I made it exactly as is except I used the taco seasoning that was mentioned. Still very good, but it was a little too spicy, so next time I would not use the cayenne pepper. Super easy, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the beans, so I did. Good thing, because there was plenty of liquid without the liquid from the beans.

Thank you Patti! We have been using this recipe for a few years now.  It is a staple during ski season!  We made a fun discovery during our ski trip.  I always substitue 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilis for a can of chicken broth.  We used Bud Light with lime, OMG it was soo good! The lime really kicks up the flavors!

This is a wonderful, family friendly, healthy dish!  I was concerned about adding beer to the recipe, but it gave it a little something extra my husband just couldn't put his finger on.  Ironic, since it was his beer.  We ate ours with a dollop of sour cream and a few minced onions.  For leftovers the next day, I added some white rice and strained the extra broth so it wouldn't be too soupy and make burritos.  The reincarnation as a burrito was received heartily by my sons and husband.  I love this recipe.  It makes me appear to be a better cook than I am.

My family loves this soup. I make it at least once a month if not more. If I don't have beer, I just use chicken broth and garlic, it comes out just as good. I have even made this for teacher pot luck days at school- it' so easy. Everyone loves this one! It's a keeper!

I used the homemade taco seasoning as suggested by recipe author however, I found this too spicey for my taste (and I like spicey) maybe I did something wrong.  I only used one can of black beans and did not add chili beans.

Have made this over and over again since first discovering it last year! Very tasty and hearty soup. Great as leftovers too. Followed the recipe exactly ... a few times had to substitute some of the ingredients that I didn't have on hand, but otherwise try to stay true to the original and it's excellent every time!

Thanks for this easy breezy dish. It's a crowd-pleaser for sure. My aunt asked for the recipe for her future church gang potlucks. Adding the beer for liquid was a great idea. I only had one can of diced tomatoes with chilies so i used up some left over salsa with chilies in a jar. Turned out great and will definitely make again!

I am pretty hard to impress and don't write reviews often, but this soup is awesome!  I doubled all of the ingredients except the beer and taco seasoning.  I also added chopped carrot and celery.  Also instead of one of the cans of tomatos and green chilies, I used a can of Walmart brand Mexican Style Fire Roasted Tomatos.  Crowd pleaser!

Excellent soup. I put in pinto beans instead of chili beans, I also added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end. My 4 year old and 2 year old also love it as dip for their cheese quesadillas

i LOVED this soup. i accidentally bought only one can of tomatoes with green chilis and one without -- turns out that was fine as it has plenty of kick- two cans with chilis might have been too spicy!  I have a slow cooker but it was WAY too small for this recipe, so i simmered it for 2 hours on my stove top, cooking and shredding the chicken separately and adding for the last hour of cooking.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe b/c it seemed too easy but it turned out okay. I think next time I'll add some jalapeno to add more kick. My boyfriend LOVED it though. He keeps asking for it!

I followed the directions to make my own taco seasoning, added a couple of splashes of light cream at the end, cooked on the stovetop, and pureed up a couple of ladles fulls (picky kids complain if there are too many veggies).  Pretty tasty, a little spicy, but good for me.  I am excited to add cheese and dip in some tortilla chips.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful!  It was so quick and easy to prepare!  We enjoyed it with crushed tortilla chips and cheese.  I can't wait to have it again for lunch tomorrow.

Great basic recipe.  I added cumin and cayenne for extra spice.  The soup is not thick but very flavorful.

Oh baby !!  15 stars !!!  This is so yummy - I used chicken broth but will try the beer next time.  What is so great about this recipe is you can spice it up or down depending upon who you are serving.  My hubby and I enjoy spicy foods so I added a package of hidden valley ranch fiesta dip mix instead of taco seasoning.  Wowza !  Great flavor.

Followed advice from other reviewers & added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cummin & 4 T Echols taco seasoning. Used pinto beans instead of chili beans. Ended up using 16oz can of diced tomatoes and about 1/2c of diced green chilies since I didn't have then premixed. Also used a white onion. It was good last night, today for lunch it was dynamite with sour cream and sharp cheddar!

I love this recipe! I just throw it all in the crock pot and 6-7 hours later dinner is perfect! Only one dish too! I use the taco seasoning recipe from AR and I love it. This recipe is a keeper!

This soup is frequently requested at my house.  I have also made it without the chicken and substituting TVP (textured vegetable protein) to make it vegitarian friendly.

This soup was very good.  Because we like our food spicy, I took others advice and added some extra spices, habenero sauce, etc., yet it was still too tame for us.  Next time I think I will add jalapenos and even more habenero sauce.  I cooked it even longer than the directions stated and it was pretty good.  One note: I used my old stand by, Rival crockpot, and there was so much, it barely fit to close the lid!  I ended up having to remove some of the contents so the soup could cook properly in the crockpot.  After it had cooked down some, I was able to add what I had removed back into the crockpot.  Overall, good soup!

Very good.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the cooking time (ran on high for 3 hours, low for 2).  I did use the beer since we really like its flavor.  Garnished with cilantro, which seemed to go really well with the beer flavor.  One negative note- I used the recommended taco seasoning recipe: Bill Echols Taco Seasoning.  Found it to be bland and ended up adding an additional 1 T cumin, pepper, and about 1 T chipolte chili powder to make it spicy.  Truthfully I'd probably give it 4.5 stars and will definitely make again.

I HAD TO COMMENT....The taste was amazing.  So easy.  My husband, 8yr. old and 5 yr. old couldn't stop eating!!!!  I'm an amateur cook but even I couldn't kill this recipe.  I mistakenly added chili powder when I wasn't thinking.  It was still great!  Thanks for sharing.

This soup is excellent - we make it at least every other week and freeze the leftovers (which are awesome when reheated). I omit the corn and instead of the package of taco seasoning I use Bill Eschol's taco seasoning from this site. I also add about 2-3 cups of chicken broth which makes it more like a soup - otherwise it is like a thick chili.  This is our go to spicy soup recipe - it is great!

Very easy and so good. My only change was that I did not add the beer because we (surprisingly) didn't have any. Added a bit of water in it's place. Excellent, no-fuss recipe!

Delicious!  I didn't have the full 7 hours, so I put the slow cooker on high and after 3.5 hours I shredded the chicken and let it cook on high for another hour.  The husband loved it and it will go in our regular winter soup rotation.

I've made this dish so many times. I make this recipe with alterations. I skip the beer and I switch the chili beans for pinto beans. I use my own taco seasoning concoction. I use Knorr Tomato Chicken Granulated Bouillon, minced garlic, cumin,  salt and pepper.  I will sometimes add other seasonings like oregano, parsley, chili powder or chili flakes, and paprika. Overall, it turns out great and it's in my meal rotation.

Wow! This was good and so easy. I put together in 15 minutes. I added cheese, sour cream, cilantro and crushed tortilla chips on top. So yummy. I used Bud Light beer as that's what I had (bought for beer butt chicken!). Next time I'm going to use Dos Equis or Corona. Also will use the taco seasoning I from this sight. :-)

LOVE this!  We did switch the black beans for pintos and chunked the chicken at the end (there really is no need to open the slow cooker lid), but left everything else the same.  The Bill Echols Seasoning is a must!  The soup is fabulous and is now a part of our rotation.  Try it with ground chicken, too, for a more chili-like feel!

This recipe is simple, quick and tasty!!! I followed the recipe to a 'T' except I omitted the beer, I hate beer and according to a lot of the reviews the beer is very potent in this recipe. I followed another reviewers suggestion and sauteed the onions before I added them to the crock pot. I don't remember how long it took to fully cook but it was well worth the wait. Also I added some ground pepper, sea salt and chili powder to suit my taste. Overall very good recipe! Prep it, set it, go and come home to a complete hardy meal! I plan to eat it with some homemade cornbread. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe saved the day!  I had my husband throw everything in the crockpot and set it on low for about 7 hours.  Took the lid off, shredded the chicken, and it was ready to go!  We didn't use a can of chili beans and only used 2 large chicken breasts.  Used the taco seasoning from the most helpful review (I think Bill Echols) and it tasted perfect!!  Reminded me a lot of Catherine's Spicy Chicken Soup from this site which I love- especially after mixing in sour cream and cheese.  Didn't have chips but it was still great.  Can't wait to have it for lunch!

Did this on the stove in 1/2 hr.   My husband and I liked it.  My two older children liked it.  The other littler ones did not. It is still good with some corn chips. I modified the recipe to use what I had, but the ingredients were all in there or close... I used 1 jar of salsa (mild) and no beer...just chicken broth that had just gotten done on the stove...added the spices as suggested by reviewer, packet of frozen corn, and beef and bean chili leftovers about 4 cups. Added some shredded chicken and mixed  together.  Heated through in a pot and Voila...dinner within 1/2 hr. Served with corn chips, sour cream and cheddar cheese.  Very filling hearty meal.
8/27/11
Made again.  Omitted beer, but all the other ingredients were added.  Quick and tasty!

This was a good soup and I substituted black eyed peas for the black beans b/c that's all I had.

This is a delicious recipe. I did use some fresh ingredients and dried beans in order to control the sodium content to my preference, but otherwise followed the recipe. The beer is what makes this one stand out! This is a tasty soup that I'm sure I'll be asked to serve again :) Thanks for the recipe!

It's so hot here in the summer (108 yesterday) that I try to use my slow cooker on the patio whenever I can to keep from heating up the house. I tried this yesterday with a couple of changes - chicken broth rather than beer and extra diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (too hot to drive to the store). Thought it needed a little extra flavor, so added cumin, some fresh chopped cilantro and squeezed a couple of small limes into it at the end. Garnished with sliced green onions and served with warm flour tortillas. Had some extra jalapeno jack cheese, so I set that out, too, and everyone thought it was perfect with the soup. This is pretty healthy, too, if you don't overdo the toppings.

This is very tasty. I substituted a can of chicken broth for the beer just because it didn't sound good to me. It turned out great and was just as good if not better the next day!

Fantastic! I have made this several times and love it every time! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. It's also delicious with other bean varieties, red/green peppers, and whatever veggies you have lying around! This is also wonderful strained and served over mexican rice!

Quite yummy!  I really enjoy being able to throw everything in the crockpot and forget about it.  Added a dash of lime juice and fresh cilantro in the last ten minutes of cooking, served with crushed tortilla chips on top.

Not the best tortilla soup I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  The ease of prep is worth at least 3 stars!  I used pinto beans instead of chili beans, and skipped the corn. I also used about 1 1/2 lb. skinless, bone-in thighs. I used the "hot" version of Rotel (the one with habanero). Cooked on high for 5 hours. About an hour before serving, deboned & shredded the chicken, then added it back into the cooker.  Don't be tempted to serve without sour cream, cheese (cheddar, mont. jack, or Mexican white cheeses). Be sure to include crushed corn tortilla chips and lime juice--also feel free to add avocado and cilantro, too. You just have to "dress" most Mexican soups for the full flavor! Thanks for an easy, filling recipe.

This is really good and easy, too.  I used frozen corn and about 1.5 lbs of chicken.  Also used dark beer and did not find any beer taste at all, as others have complained about.  I think the type of beer could make a big difference.  Can't wait for cold weather so I can make this again.

Made the soup with very few alterations---I used beef broth instead of the beer (because that's all I had) and replaced 1 can of diced tomatoes with fresh diced tomatoes. I thought the chicken was a little bit dry considering it was covered in saucy deliciousness (the soup is pretty good) but that's the only negative to this dish. Next time I'll use ground beef instead. The sour cream addition does WONDERS, so much tastier! I didn't give it a full 5 stars because of the dry chicken.

My family loved this.  I found it to be more of a chili than a soup.  I don't think i'll ever make "regular beef" chili ever again.  I liked it a bit thicker as thinner soup is harder for my children ( 3 and 19mths) eat and not spill everywhere.  lol  I added the beer and didn't think there was any weird flavour(as previous reviews said) I have a 7qt slow cooker so i added some extra stuff to fill it so i can freeze some.   I also added a can of chick peas, some crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, red and green peppers and some celery.  I had to omit the green chilies because of little kids.  It was great.  Will definetly be making this again.

I will not make this again.  : )  Easy prep, but the finished product was not good....could totally taste the beer.  If I were to make this again, I would definetly ditch the beer & use chix stock instead.  Horrible after taste.  I ended up using some of the leftovers in quesadillas (w/out the liquid).  It added a healthy bulk (beans/chix/tomato) to just plain cheese quesadillas.

This was wonderful! My family and I absolutely loved it!! I made a couple changes: I replaced the beer with chicken broth (as other posters suggested), used HOT taco seasoning, and I pre-cooked and shredded the chicken the night before in order to cut down the cooking time to 5 hours on low heat. I will definitely be making this again, but next time I think I will add some cumin. This is a great recipe!!

Everyone thought this was wonderful when I made it...I used a can of white kidney beans and chick peas instead of chili beans and used chicken broth instead of beer. Wanted to make it spicy, so I used a hot and spicy taco seasoning....the family is already asking for it again.

I made this last night for friends--they all loved it even my friend's husband who just moved to the US from India!  I added extra black beans and extra tomatoes as well as some cumin becuae it tasted too bland. Also, it was too much to fit in my slow cooker so I made it in a big pot on the stove. It didn't take quite so long to make and came out beautifully!

I didn't have the full amount of time needed so I improvised by pre-cooking  and shredding the chicken. I then cooked on high for 4 hours. This was awesome and I will definitely add this to the "make often" list!

I did not like this at all. I have never cooked anything with beer but I followed recipe exactly and I thought the beer flavor was way too strong. I used a 12oz. bottle of Bud Light which is what we drink and I really think it ruined this recipe. Maybe it would have been 5 stars without the beer or maybe a different brand.

Love this soup!  I made it just about as written.  I only used chili beans because that's all I had.  I also doubled the taco seasoning for our own personal tastes.  The only beer I had on hand was Guinness (left over from St. Patrick's Day!).  I wasn't sure how well that would go with this dish, but it was delicious.  Since I was feeling extra ambitious, I made home-made bread bowls, and served it up in them.  Garnished with a little sour cream, shredded cheese, and cilantro......YUMM!!

Best soup ever!!!!  I make this all the time and all 6 members of my family love it.  It is really good with a dallop of sour cream and shredded cheese on top.  Love that you just dump everything in the crockpot and walk away.  I use 2 cans of cheddar soup, one regular and one nacho cheddar.  This gives it a little extra kick.

This is one of the best soups I have ever made! My family adores it.  We make it with chicken broth instead of beer (it suits our tastes better).  It is a great meal to take to a potluck or for friends who are under the weather.

Made this exactly as written (I've also used bone in chicken direct from the freezer and just pulled off the bone when shredding) and is delicious.  One of the few soups my kids will willingly eat!

I LOVE this recipe and make it all the time.  A few suggestions: (1) when serving a lot of people, I add an extra can of corn, (2) I found I prefer using chicken broth instead of beer, (3) Depending on whats available at the store, I have used chili beans, pinto beans, and great northern beans, (4) chopping up 2 jalapenos and adding some hot sauce is an easy way to spice it up, (5) take the extra 5 minutes to use the taco seasoning recipe -- its AWESOME, (6) to make this receipe even easier, I throw in a bag of frozen onion instead of chopping one myself.  ENJOY!!

This. is. so. good.  !!  Thank you for my new go-to recipe for what I'm going to call "Chicken Tortilla Stew."  The only changes I made were using a Mexican cheese blend and only 1 can of beans (husband is not a big bean person).  The optional cheese, crushed tortillas and sour cream are what bring this from 4 to 5 stars.  *Remember, don't use alcohol in a dish that you wouldn't normally enjoy drinking alone!*

Loved this...it was so easy and really good.  Didn't have tomato sauce, so used salsa instead.  I also used Miller Chill as the beer which gave it a sweet taste, and subbed chili beans for white northern beans.

This has become a favorite for my family ~ from my 6 yr old to my mom and dad ~ everyone loves this recipe!  It can be done on the stove, in case you need a quick dinner, if you sub cooked canned ckn instead of breasts.  I also substituted a can of ckn broth for the beer, and I substituted great northern beans and kidney beans for the chili beans and black beans. To suit my 6 yr old's taste, I leave out the Rotel.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Made this for a dinner party last night and everyone really enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  It is so easy to make and it has alot of flavor.  I did use Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe per other peoples reviews.  I added some cilantro and cumin.  Will make again.

I made this soup for the first time for my family that was visiting from out of town.  EVERYONE just raved about the flavor and think my husband had thirds.  I did substitute the beer for a can of chicken broth as suggested by several people.  I can't wait to make this again!

Great, simple recipe. Smells delicious while cooking. My husband dislikes most slow cooker recipes, but always asks for this one. I add  fresh cilantro with the shredded chicken. Serve with cheese quesadillas.

I've made this twice now and it is my favourite crock pot recipe!!!  I use bone in leg quraters with the skin removed so I can cook it longer (8+ hours on low).  The meat falls right off the bone and I just tear it up and throw it back in the soup.  Everything else I follow to a tee,  this recipe is great as is and needs no adjusting.

This soup would have been really good if it weren't for the beer. It left a strange bitter taste. I'm surprised some people said that they couldn't taste it. I like drinking beer on occasion and it was a no go for me. I will try broth next time for a substitute. Other than that, it was pretty good. I didn't have 5 hours to cook so I boiled my chicken seperately then just pulled it apart.

I have made this recipe several tiimes, and thought it was ok.  This time I made it with the chicken broth instead of beer, and used frozen corn since it was what I had on hand.  I think it turned out much better with the broth, even my husband thought so.  It is an easy recipe, as I can throw it together in the morning, and have a nice hot meal when we get home.

Excellent! To make this more soupy I like to use 16 oz chicken broth in place of beer and leave out the tomato sauce. I often use 2 cans red kidney beans instead of chili and black. I also use 2 packets taco seasoning to spice it up. Better the 2nd day. I often cook 4-6 hours, refrigerate, then cook again for another couple hours. YUMMY!

Delicious and very easy!  I made it the first time exactly as it was written and it was great - next time I didn't have the beer so I substituted 1/2 cup dry white wine and 1/2 cup chicken stock.  Also added and extra can of diced tomatoes, doubled the corn, and made it thicker with a can of cream of chicken soup - it was great with the changes as well!  Love that you can change this soup up to suit your particular taste - and I love that you just put the chicken breast fillets in the crockpot whole...a real time-saver.  (I've even put them in still somewhat frozen and they turn out beautifully!)  Thanks for another terrific soup to add to my collection!!

Absolutely delicious soup.  Made exactly per the instructions, but added one small can of jalapenos because we like it spicy - it was fantastic. A definite 5* recipe.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  Thanks for a really great recipe!

We did not enjoy this recipe that much.  We felt the taco seasoning overpowered all the other flavours.

Wow, this is delicious.  I wanted to make sure I had enough for a crowd, since the serving size is 8, and I'm feeding 8, I like there to be a little extra.  I just used the large cans of everything instead of the regular sized cans (beans, tomato sauce, corn, chopped tomatoes).  I used a whole 1 lb pack of chicken tenderloins and the suggested seasoning from the comments.  It's fantastic and I know it's going to be a bit hit.

Thick and hearty recipe! I used two cans of Rotel, one medium and one mild. The soup was still pretty spicy for me so I add a scoop of sour cream to my bowl to help cool down the chilies. Very yummy!

Loved this soup!!!!! I used regular packaged taco seasoning; would like to try the mix (Bill Echol's?) recommended by other reviewers so I can control the sodium amount.  I used low sodium chicken broth (Wolfgang Puck) instead of the beer.  I don't think we missed out on anything by replacing the beer.  The soup was very flavorful and well-rounded.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

The first time I made this, I forgot to add the cup of water and used garlic powder instead of real garlic. I drained my black beans and did not use an entire package of frozen corn. I also threw in 2 large frozen chicken breasts. I cooked it on slow for 3 hours and then took the chicken out to shred it and cooked it on high for an additional 2.  It was FANTASTIC! My boyfriend and I ate it for dinner that night and then it was my sole source of sustanence for the next three days...No exaggeration!  The next time I followed the recipe and added the water, did not drain the beans, used all the corn and room temperature chicken. I did not like it as much. Though is was still very tastey, it was less hearty.  I would however recommend either version to anyone! Easy, delicious and adjustable to anyone's personal taste. I personally like it hotter and loaded with cilantro!

This recipe is very hearty and good.  It isn't very spicy, just mild, so it was good for my kids.  It also holds up in the frig and makes great leftovers.  In fact my family liked it better the next day.  I doubled the recipe.  I used one beer and one can of chicken broth.  I used frozen corn instead of canned and used kidney beans in place of black beans.  It made so much and was taking so long to cook, I placed it on the stove instead to speed up the cooking process.

This was fantastic!  I don't know why I waited so long to try this.  The only changes I made were using 2 cups of chicken broth (in place of the beer) and using frozen pre-chopped onion (instead of fresh).  Served with crushed chips, sour cream, shredded cheese, and sliced avocado.  Delicious!

This is great to throw in pot and have ready when we come home.  It is also always a hit at our Superbowl parties, served with hot wings.  I do use the taco mix recipe suggested by the author.

An easy, tasty, and modifable soup.  I used all no or low salt ingredients with only a couple of substitutions.  I substituted chicken broth for the beer (didn't want to use my last beer) and instead of tomato sauce and one of the cans of tomatoes with chilies, I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes.  This really filled the crockpot.  I started it around lunchtime and it was ready by supper.  Eveyone loved.  Update: We make this several times a year.  Tweak to your taste.

This was really good.  I'm a novice with a slow cooker.  A little spicy, next time I will use MILD enchilada sauce.  I added rice near the end to make the soup more filling, but you realy don't need to.

This recipe surpasses 5 stars in my book for ease of preparation, cost and taste!  I threw all the ingredients in the crockpot before going to bed and the next morning before work I took it out of the fridge, set it on low and forgot about it (cooked ~11 hours total)!  I omitted the onion, used spicy chili beans, 8oz of chicken broth, 2 (14.5) oz cans diced toms w/green chilis, 2 heaping tbsps of Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning and 4 chicken breasts.  Served with crushed tortilla chips and cheddar cheese, this recipe was the perfect amount of spicy and very filling.  This would be great to throw together in the morning for guests in the evening - just serve with an assortment of topping options (sour cream, cheddar cheese, tortilla chips, cilantro, green onions, etc) and you have a meal for a crowd!

Absolutely the easiest best tasting slow cooker recipie. I've made it almost every week. I actually made it for the employees at my job during inventory. Everyone wanted the recipie.   My boyfriend can't have beans so I don't always add them. I tried to add bell peppers once, but you have to be careful how much you put. After cooking so long the bell pepper taste was really strong.  AWESOME RECIPIE. And a great way at making one pack of chicken go a long way.

Excellent recipe! So easy to make and very tasty! I'm a newlywed struggling to find new and interesting dishes for my husband, and this was definitely a winner!  I replaced the beer with chicken broth, but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Very hearty and enough left over for our lunch and dinner tomorrow!

Very good, makes a lot, I had to freeze 3 extra servings.  It tastes like enchilada filling--- as a soup.  Next time I will use less sauce, cause I would have liked it to be a little thicker like a chili.  I would not eat this without the sour cream and cheese or tortilla chips, it makes it five stars..... but ofcourse, not as healthy!

OMG! Delicious! My son & husband were skeptical but once they tried it they couldn't have enough!  I used stuff from my pantry. Changed chili beans for chili w/o beans, added cilantro and chopped garlic. I didn't have diced tomatoes with green chile so I added the diced tomatoes with garlic and a can of chopped green chile. I also added a bit of Badia Fajita seasoning.  The boys are already asking me to make it again..I'll make them wait a bit so they really appreciate it :-) Thank you for the recipe.

I did alter this recipe a little and it was fantastic!  I left out the corn as I don't care for it, added 2 tsps of chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  This gave it more flavour.  I also used 2 cups of leftover holiday turkey instead of chicken and substituted chick broth for the beer as many people had suggested.  It was very good and even my 13 month old ate it up with no problem!  I will be making it again very soon.  It's a good way to use up leftover turkey.

I loved it!! This is one of my all-time favorites from allrecipes! I sub'd veggie broth for the beer, and vegetarian crumbles for the chicken. It took about 3 minutes to put together which is fantastic! I served the soup with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This was a thick, flavorful, very filling stew (not thin enough to be a soup IMO, and I like them on the chunky side). I did substitute a can of chickpeas for the chili beans (what was on hand) and made with the beer as written. The beer gave what we though was a pleasant and complimentary flavor: we did definitely taste it though, if you're nervous about beer broth might be a good way to go. I prefer a richer more broth-y flavor to my chicken taco/tortilla soups, but I will make this again when I'm out of broth or want something unique in the slow cooker. Thanks very much for sharing :)

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I loved that you didn't have to pre-cook anything, it was so quick to put together in the crockpot!  The only thing I added was an extra can of pinto beans, and I used chicken broth instead of beer.  It was perfect today since it's so cold out.  I think this is my new favorite chili recipe, and yes, I'd say chili rather than soup.  Loved it!!!!  Will definitely make again this winter (and next winter).

Thank you we loved the soup. I made some minor changes. I cooked on the stove top not enough time to wait on the slow cooker. Made my own beans. Used ground turkey instead of chicken and left out the onions my since my husband is allergic to onions. I also used a taco seasoning on this site from Bob.

We really enjoyed this soup for dinner tonight.  It was easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.  It was actually more like chicken taco stew!  I followed the recipe exactly as written but, because we like our food pretty spicy, added a tsp. of chili powder and cumin. It was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Okay but had a weird taste to it. Possibly the beer? I would try it again without the beer.

This soup was great!  I added an avocado, cilantro and homemade corn tortilla chips to each bowl and it was 5 stars with these additions. The soup itself was good, but needed a little more spice.  I added 2 tsp cumin and 2 tsp garlic powder, in addition to the taco seasoning, and this made it much better!  I also omitted the beer and used 8 oz chicken broth.

Very good and filling.  I did make a couple of changes based on what I had.  I used one large previously baked chicken breast, shredded and instead of the beer, I used 12 oz of the stock from "Simple Carnitas" from this site.  Put all in the crock pot and simmered 2 hours on high.  I don't even need the extras.  And without the cheese, sour cream, and tortillas it is an extremely healthy soup.  Thanks for sharing!

Even though I didn't follow this to a T, I still have to give it 5 stars because it's an excellent base than can be altered easily.  I used what I had on hand and it turned out perfect!  No time for the slow cooker so I made everything on the stove top.  While I boiled 1lb boneless skinless chicken tenders, I heated everything else up in a separate stock pot.  I followed the ingredients except: I substituted the chili beans with 2 cups of cooked brown rice (didn't have chili beans on hand) & used 1 can of regular Hunt's petite diced tomatoes with no chilies.  I added 1 can Hunt's tomato sauce,  1 T each of garlic powder and dried onion flakes, and 1 can of chicken broth in place of the beer.  When the chicken was cooked, I shredded it and added it to the stock pot with the other ingredients.  I thought it needed a little more liquid, so I added a couple ladles of the leftover broth from boiling the chicken.  It was ready to eat after a few minutes and even better the next day.  This is a top-notch base recipe all around - budget-friendly, easy, very tasty and can be brought to the table in 30 minutes.  We didn't feel the need for the cheddar and sour cream, it was tasty enough without the added fat.  The tortilla chips do add a nice touch, but it's still great without them.   I have had soups similar to this in upscale restaurants but I prefer this homemade version hands-down!

I made this soup today and my only substitution was to use two cans of navy beans as I don't like really meaty beans.  I also found the beer gave it a "weird" taste.  I will make this soup again though and sub chicken broth for beer.  I enjoyed everything else about it and my husband liked it too.

Very good and very easy.  I did, however, felt it needed a little cumin and garlic so I added 1.5 tsp of each. I omitted the beer and used 14 oz. can of chicken broth.

This was so easy and so good! We used two cans of diced chicken that we had in our cabinet (wasn't sure how that would be) and it was great. It didn't even need the sour cream or cheese on top, although I did crumble a few tortilla chips on my bowl. So overall it was pretty healthy and delicious. And I used the Bill Echols taco seasoning- which is the only one I use. I don't even buy the packets anymore becasue that taco seasoning recipe so easy and delicious.

Love this recipe!  I used frozen chicken thighs - its tough to find a recipe that works well for thighs with all their weird shapes and parts, but this one is perfect, since you shred the chicken.  Dropped them in frozen and timing was still perfect.  I did amp up the spices, using 6 tablespoons of taco seasoning, and then adding about 1/2 tsp each of cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika.  Also added around 1 tsp of onion flakes.  I think I will just double the raw onion next time instead.  Also, drain all the beans to keep this from getting too soupy.  Thanks a ton for sharing this recipe - I love it!

We really loved this soup! Ours actually came out more like a chili consistency, but I'm not saying that as a bad thing. Since we were really wanting that soup consistency, we froze half, and added more chicken stock to the half we planned to eat. Amazing flavor!! The corn stayed crunchy, the beans were not mushy at all, and the chicken had a great flavor. Delicious!  The only changes we made were: Chicken stock instead of beer per others' suggestions Cooked onion before putting in crockpot per others' suggestions 1 can tomatoes and chilies & 1 can fire roasted tomatoes 2 chicken breasts (there are only 2 of us)

By far my favorite soup. I have made it soooo many times now.  It make a lot.  I usually freeze the rest.  I usually use whatever beans I have on hand. I have used pintos, kidneys, black beans, any kind turns out great.  Also, usually leave out the beer.  I have made it both ways and like it better without.  mmm.mmm

Loved this recipe!  Super simple...and I highly recommend adding the beer!  If you're someone who enjoys beer for the flavor, it definitely adds something to this recipe.  But I also put a little chicken broth in to thin it out as it cooked...so both were good together.  I also used the taco seasoning recipe, instead of the packaged stuff...it had a kick to it, and wasn't too spicy.  My husband couldn't get enough of this, and he's hard to please.  I think next time I'll make some rice and try adding it in as it's served.  Thanks for this keeper!!!

THE BEST TORTILLA SOUP EVER!!  Used Yuengling beer. Cut flour tortillas into thin strips with a pizza cutter and toasted in the oven to top the soup.  Monterey and cheddar cheese and a dollup of sour cream.  Better than what we've had in restaraunts...SERIOUSLY good soup!  Even better the second day day!!

This is a fabulous base recipe!  I would say it's more like chicken chili than a soup.  I had to make several modifications so I could make it for dinner spontaneously.  I made it in a stock pot (chicken pan fried, shredded and added afterward) in about an hour or so.  Because it was spur of the moment, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but my substitutions were GREAT!  The best one to mention is that I only had one can of the Rotel tomatoes, so I used my favorite salsa instead for the other 10 ounces.  That was a great addition since it also had cumin and other flavors that it added in.  I used chicken stock as other reviewers did and kidney beans for the chili beans.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This is soooo yummy!!! My whole family loved it.   I even froze the leftovers and then when I had a party at my house I thawed it out, drained it a little bit, shredded some cheese on top of it, threw it in the oven and served it as a mexican dip with tortilla chips!! Every one loved it!!!

I've made this twice now and love it!  I stayed true to the recipe the first time and the second time added 2 cups of chicken broth to make it go a little further.  I've frozen individual portions to take to work and it tastes great warmed up.  I'll be making this over the holidays when we've got a house full of folks coming and going... Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, this was my first soup I've made in a crockpot & it was great!  It did turn out pretty spicy though, I think next time I might use just one can of the tomatoes w/chili's & then 1 other can of plain tomatoes to make it a little milder.

I knew it had to be excellent to have so many good reviews. The only thing I changed was the diced tomatoes with green chilies - I can't for the life of me find these in CDN grocery stores, so I used a chunky salsa - still tasted great! I added sour cream, cheese and minced jalapeños. YUM. Oh, I also shortened my cooking time - 2 hours on high, 3 on low and in the last hour I shredded the chicken which fell apart basically on its own. Thanks for a great hearty and healthy recipe!

VERY yummy.  Children liked it because it wasn't TOO spicy, but adults could add a couple dashes of hot sauce to spice things up.

My Dad found this to cook with his brand new crock pot. Now it's one of the family favorites! We've taken it on work team trips and potlucks and never have any left over.

This was a wonderful dish and can't wait to make it again.  With some of the left overs I made Nachoes. Just melted cheese over the top with a splash of sour cream.  Yum!

This was great! Exactly how you would want it to taste! We ate it two nights in a row even, we couldn't get enough and it was even better the 2nd night! We topped it with fritos, sour cream and cheese! Yum! Thanks!

I love this recipe! So easy to make and adjust to your tastes. I've done it with and without the beer, and have used different types of beer. It's good either way.

I used 12oz of chicken broth instead of beer. I drained only the corn and made it exactly like the recipe. It was delicious! I topped it off with sour cream, cheese and crushed tortilla chips. I won't change any part of it when I make it again, except the broth for the beer. Will make again and again!

this was really tasty. i bought a rotisserie chicken and pulled thechicken off of it! that was really yummy! i was a little nervous to add the beer in there, but you cant even taste it. i used a bottled corona. Next time i am going to make it with the homemade taco seasonings though. i really think that will make it taste amazing! great recipe though. gotta try it!

Very tasty, filling & super-easy!  I followed the recipe (used a bit less onion as that's all I had) & I used the beer (12 oz bud lite).  Delicious topped with cheese, sour cream & tortilla chips. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I made this recipe tonight for the first time.  It was delicious.  My husband loved it too!  I did make two changes: I substituted chichen broth for the beer, and I threw some cheese into the soup while it was cooking.  With just the two of us this recipe makes way too much, so we're freezing some for later!  Thank you for the wonderful soup!

This didn't have any flavor!  I would sub chicken broth for beer, and shred the cihcken at least an hour before serving so it would absorb some more flavor.  I found the flavor to be lacking and it was just missing something.  I tried adding another packet of taco seasoning and it didn't help.

Excellent soup recipe!  I omitted corn and added another can of beans.   The taco seasoning was very good and gave the soup a nice "bite".  Good with avocado and olives, as well as sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips.

A definate keeper!! Tastes like a mild chili with chicken instead of beef...great for those who don't eat red meat!  The only thing I did differently was added a 12oz. can of tomato sauce as opposed to an 8oz. can and it came out great! It was thicker than a soup would be. If you like it spicy you could jazz it up with a few more spices. Great served with corn bread. Really easy!

I followed the recipe except used chicken broth instead of beer. I didn't want to chance it since I don't like beer. My family and boyfriend loved it. I ate it for about 3 days in a row and didn't get sick of it. This is definitely a fav. Thanks!

I just made this soup today. I had to try it before dinner, because I couldn't wait! It's by far THE best soup I've ever had/made! I'd give it ten stars if I could. I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the beer. For the corn I used frozen Southwestern flavored. Added some garlic powder, chili powder, and some onion powder. This soup is AWESOME!! Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

This soup was very easy to make and very good.  I was worried that it wouldn't be spicy enough from reading a few of the other reviews, but it was very flavorful.  I used the package of taco seasoning before using the custom spice blend provided by the recipe's owner but next time I will try the custom spice blend since everyone says it is so good.

We LOVE this soup.  It has become a regular meal in our house now that the weather has started cooling.  It is so simple and easy, and tastes great too.  I usually use the recipe for Restaurant-Style Taco Meat Seasoning instead of a pre-mixed packet.  We top it with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese, and sour cream.  Wonderful recipe!

Excellent! My family raves about it, and the leftovers don't last through the next day.  I've made with the beer, but also substituted chicken broth instead.  Either way, it's fantastic! The homemade taco seasoning is a must for great flavor, and I've also sprinkled a little fresh chopped cilantro in right at the end.  Great soup!

Big hit at my house.  I used canned chilli beans in zesty tomato sauce and eliminated the can of tomato sauce.  Also, no beer in my fridge so I used chicken broth. Going into the rotation for sure.

I thought this turned out to be more like a stew than a soup, but it was still delicious topped with homemade salsa and scooped up with scoops tortilla chips. I only used 2 chicken breasts and I also used a 2 tbsp. of a homemade taco seasoning from this site, Taco Seasoning I. Delicious the next day, too, warmed up for lunch!

This was pretty good but seemed to need a little more zing!  I cut up the chicken breasts into cubes, cooked them and then put them in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients. It seemed simpler that way.

This was wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly using a double batch of Bill Echols Taco Seasoning.  The chili beans were spicy, and gave it a nice bit of heat.  Topped with cheddar cheese, a little sour cream, cilantro and served with scoop tortilla chips.  Fabulous!  Makes plenty for a crowd.  Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't "sold" on this recipe while it was cooking as I cheated and lifted the crockpot lid a few times and the aroma didn't strike me HOWEVER! the flavours REALLY come together in this dish during the last couple of hours and like many stew-type dishes, this soup is FABOULOUS after it's been sitting in the fridge for a day or two.    I normally find chicken breast too dry but it becomes so incredibly tender and juicy in this dish. I'm happy that I do not need to substitute the white meat for dark meat and can keep this recipe so healthy.   This freezes really well!  I defrost a large container of this soup in the fridge overnight and the next night, a quick reheat makes for a hearty, homey meal!  I added extra green chili bec my husband likes this soup on the hotter side - a bit too hot for me so a tbsp of sour cream stirred into my serving makes this just perfect.

This was one of the easiest meals I have ever prepared, and it was delicious! It's a great recipe to customize. I used chicken broth instead of beer, added some chopped green bell pepper and used frozen Southwestern Vegetable blend instead of the corn. It was very mild, and I would have added more spices had my 1-year old not been eating as well. But, this was something we could all enjoy, especially when served with tortilla chips (next time I'm using Fritos!, sour cream, and cheese.) Thanks Patti!

This is so easy and so delicious!  I put my chicken breast in frozen and literally had this all put together in my slow cooker in under 10 minutes.  The house smelled yummy while it was cooking and was perfect after 6 hours.  I served it with the sour cream, crushed tortill chips, and shredded cheddar.  I also added some green onions.  This will be on the menu again.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this on Halloween for guests. The only change I made was that I omitted the beer and used 14oz can of chicken broth and added a small can of cream of chicken soup.  It was really really good. Everyone had at least two bowls. It is perfectly spicy but might be a little too much if someone is a spice wimp. Even the teenagers ate it up!  The next morning, we ate the leftover soup on top of eggs. So delicious! Don't omit the tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream!

One of our favorites! SO easy to prepare, just open cans and dump. Some changes I make: I do not use the beer or the tomato sauce, instead make up chicken broth with Better Than Bullion and water to replace these.  Also, I use Chipotle Taco seasoning. This gives it an incredible flavor, but is sometimes hard to find. I also find that the chicken breasts can go in frozen and cook thoroughly.  Throw on the cheese and chips, and it is a hearty meal!

Great recipe and super easy to throw together in the morning and have ready for dinner. I used frozen chicken breasts and frozen corn. I used one can rotel and one can diced tomatoes - other than that I followed the recipe to a T! The beer cooks out - you can smell it in the beginning but by the time it was done there ws no trace of the beer smell.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did let it cook a little longer to make the chicken a little more tender from the davice of some previse comments but other than that its a hit in my home! I am a full time colege student with a hungry husband and three hungry boys! I love this recipe! I can put it in the crock pot as we are all leaving for school and come home to a hot meal for my family! Thanks for sharing.

This was easy and outstanding!  Instead of tomato sauce I used enchilada sauce and it worked wonderfully.  I also didn't have canned corn (or frozen) so I substituted cream corn and it worked just fine.  Used rotel tomatoes.  I put it in the crockpot and it cooked for 10 hours with no negative results.  This was really good and we'll be using it again.  So easy as a crockpot recipe!

Excellent!  I made this using the spices added individually and chicken broth instead of beer.  It was super easy in the crock pot and made a big batch.  Husband and picky teen son loved it.  Unfortunately I didn't have cheddar and tried parmesan in the bowls.  It was very good but I'll try the cheddar next time.  I may try the taco packet, too, and compare but this was so very yummy.  Thanks!

Wonderful! As others, I replaced beer with chicken broth. It's so easy that I didn't even measure anything. Just threw the ingredients in. lol Cheese/chips are a must. Husband loved it!

DELICIOUS...... I loved this soup, it was filling, had just the right amount of spice, and was easy to throw together. I used a big can of black beans instead of the black beans and chili beans. I forgot to buy a can of corn, so I used 1/2 bag of frozen corn. Used some chicken broth instead of the beer. Turned out great!!! Topped with chopped green onion and a little bit of cheese. Can't wait to make again.

This was not terrible but I was just expecting something better with all the great reviews and near perfect rating. I followed the recipe without deviation, and even with the cheese,sour cream and tortillas it just wasn't that good. I even added some extra spices trying to perk it up and still pretty bland. Im sorry but I will not be making this again. This is a three star recipe at best despite its convenience.

This recipe is wonderful and SO easy. I used the "Mexican" Chili beans as well as "Mexican" flavor tomatoes/chiles which added some more of the cumin taste to the soup. I also added another tsp of chili powder and garlic powder. I ended up cooking it for 7 hours, but shredded the chicken after 5 hours and it was still wonderful. I served it with colby jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream, tortilla chips and fresh cilantro. This is a keeper!

So easy and so good!  I used 3 chicken leg quarters and the meat literally fell off the bone, it was barely any work to shred it!  We served w/ sour cream, crushed tortilla chips and cheese.  Great dinner for a cold fall evening.

AMAZING!  And it gets better each day you eat it!  It is definitely THICK - I ended up using a whole 12 oz of beer, and an entire can of chicken broth.  It could have handled even more liquid to make it more soupy and stretch it out a little longer (my husband and I were practically in mourning when we ate the last helpings).  I baked up corn tortilla strips in the oven and threw them in the slow cooker for the last 10 minutes or so.  And as others said, definitely add sour cream and shredded cheese.  This is a GREAT recipe to keep on hand for others - sick friends, families who just had babies, new neighbors, etc...a REAL CROWD PLEASER!

Wonderful meal paired with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread! I used leftovers  from a roasted chicken added in 15 minutes before serving. The Bill Echols taco seasoning works very well.  I left out the tomatoes and added an extra tomato sauce and a can of chicken broth. Also, frozen corn is more flavorful than canned-substituted 2 cups.  I agree with others that the beer really gives it that little extra something.  Try a bit of avacado on top with the chips and cheese!  YUMMY

A wonderful hearty soup, bursting with flavor and color.  Made as written and would not change a thing.  Easy and simple, can't get much better that that.  Served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbead.  Thanks, Patti!

This is a no fail recipe.  I tried it a month ago and it was well liked by al my guests.  I used the spice mixture that Patti gave in her comment and it was so spicy most people "cut" it with sour cream.  I enjoyed the spice level, however.  Kids even ate it and liked it.  This time I'm making it with McCormick's original taco seasoning.  It will be ready later today but I think the spice level will be lower.  I did not use beer.  Substituted chicken broth the first time, and a 5.5 oz can of V8 juice + 6 oz. water this time.  Added a large clove of garlic each time, too - personal taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

sooo easy to make and sooo good!  I substituted chicken broth for the beer and we top it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and the tortilla chips.  It's a hit in our house.

This was so simple and had great flavor. And it is even better with cheese and sour cream on top.

I made this for an easy Labor Day meal & my brother stated it best; this recipe is over the top! Everyone loved it, even my mother who doesn't like spicy foods & my husband who does. I used the Bill Echols taco seasoning & I really think it made the difference. It was seasoned perfectly. This is going to be a much-requested meal at this house. Thank you Patti for such a great recipe!

This was very good and easy,  I made 1 change.  My husband likes the taco soup creamy, so about a half hour before serving I added 1 brick of cream cheese.  it was perfect.  I served it with corn chip and shredded cheddar nd sour cream

Pretty good. I had everything on hand, and always do! I did use the taco seasoning from this site and it was very yummy. The reason I did not give it a 5 star was because there was just something missing, not sure what tho. How ever will make again! P.S. if you dont have sour cream I would not make this recipe! The sour Cream makes this 100x better!

This was great...perfect for for after football practice. I made a few changes based on what I had in the kitchen...didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste and some water. Also, based on previous reviews, I added about 1/2 the amount of beer called for and substituted chicken broth for the other half. I used my own blend of spices that I use for taco seasoning, and instead of corn I cut up some corn tortillas and threw them in the slow cooker too. They made the soup nice and thick and gave it a great flavor. We'll definitely be having it again!

This soup (more like a chili) was wonderful!  The only thing I did differently was to use chicken broth in place of the beer. (I didn't have any)  I didn't even need to pull the chicken out to shred...I just broke it up with my spoon.  Delicious!  My hubby loved it also.

Easy to make and very delicious! I've made it several times since finding the recipe. I've made it exactly as listed, with and without beer, and with only black beans and it's great any way. The soup is good alone but with tortillas, sour cream, and cheese topping it's great. This one's a keeper.

I made my own blend of taco seasonings and used chicken stock rather than beer.  Plus I cut back on the corn and I topped the soup off with diced avocado.  I've made it many, many times... Delicious!

This was incredible.  I used chicken broth instead of beer.  And I also used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe as suggested by the recipe submitter.  The tortilla chips crushed on top was an added bonus.

Tasty and SUPER simple to make. I timed it -- this only took me 4 minutes to get all ingredients together, then open and dump into the crock pot. I used frozen precooked chicken strips and was able to shred them later in the crock pot just fine. Nice and spicy, great texture and the crushed tortilla chips on top give it just the right amount of salty and crunch. Even my mother-in-law liked it!

I used a 9.75 ounce can of chicken breast meat and cooked on low for 5 hours. It was wonderful! The beer gives a unique but good flavor. Even my kids loved it! The first time I made this, I used spicy diced tomatoes with chilis and it was a little too spicy for the kids. This time I used Rotel's MILD diced tomatoes with green chilis and it was perfect! I served it with a dollop of sour cream, a little shredded cheddar, and tortilla chips. Everyone loved it! I will be making this regularly now!

This is a nice break from "regular" soups and chilis. My 10 year old had seconds. I used heineken in mine and only used about 10oz rather than the whole 12oz because of all the reviews I read about the bitter beer taste. I did throw in a dash of sugar to cut that bitterness. Overall-incredible dish!

I have made this soup a few times and I love it.  My kids, husband & friends rave about how good it is.  I use chicken broth instead of the beer sometimes and it is just as good.  I also use canned pinto beans instead of the chili beans.  Delicious!!!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for.  My husband hates beans so I make it with green and red bell peppers and corn, and I make my own taco seasoning to be Gluten-free. Other than that this is awesome!

This was an instant family favorite, even my really picky 19 month old liked the beans in it. I made it exactly like the recipe except added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to it. This was the easiest time I've ever had shredding chicken. Fantastic!!! Thanks. My kids are now 5 and 6, and they "make" the soup with a little supervision! Still a family favorite, and my most requested recipe ever. It's also my go to recipe for potlucks and freezes amazing.

This was a great everyday meal.  My 14 yo daughter put it together when i was at work and the whole family enjoyed it that evening.  Not an elegant dish but delicious, filling, low fat and very healthy.  This is a keeper!  thanks.

Patti, thanks for the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe.  I tripled the recipe to have extra in the pantry to use as an easy every day seasoning.  Despite other reviews, I did add an imported bottle of beer and did not find that it gave the soup a bitter taste.  I'm making the soup again today and will add a few chipotle peppers, but I think the recipe is very tasty as it is.

This is so easy. I make it the night before and cook it on the stove when I get home. I also BBQ the chicken to get another taste, salt and pepper and cumin on it. SO good and easy.

This is a great soup. I also used the beer (a can of Molson Canadian) and there was no strange taste because of it. I will make this often.

What an easy soup to make.  After reading several ratings I decided to only use a half can of beer and half can of chicken broth.  I think this gave it the right blend and it did not have a beer taste.  I also used 3 large cans of chicken as that is what I had on hand.  It could have used more because it shreds as it cooks.  Will make again.

I used chicken broth instead of beer, used the extra spicy version of taco seasoning, and added a chopped up chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. That gave it a nice, slightly smokey flavor. I put in a can of mexican corn an hour befor serving. Definitely add a dollop of sour cream when serving. Delicious!

The entire family loved this soup! Although it irritates me when people make changes to the recipes, this one was easy to substitute for what I had on hand.  Try adding cut green beans, and using salsa (I used a medium hot Chi-Chi's) if you don't have diced tomatoes with chiles or taco seasoning.  Add some cumin and cilantro to taste and I think you have about the same soup-delicious!  I took the lazy way out and cubed the chicken before I put it in for the day so I wouldn't have to shred it later.

This was awesome!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast, and added cooked rice to make it a little more hardy and baked some ciabiatta bread rather then tortilla chips.  Very good, I will definitely add it to my book!

This is a great recipe.  Great to put in the crock pot and let cook all day on low too.   I would cut the amount of beer a little though as it was a little "yeasty" smelling.   Otherwise, Great!

I LOOOVE IT!!! We are huge taco fans in general, this was a great switch up and I love that it can cook while me and my little people go play, and then when we get home its done and the house is smelling like a big taco! Wonderful! Thank you for sharing your redipe! I did add 2 whole tomatos (fresh) at the beggining, just to put a few more vites in there. Again thank you! Absolutly delish!!

I loved it! Simple and tasty with plenty of leftovers. I didn't put in an entire bottle of Coronoa since I thought that would be a bit much but that just meant I got to drink it anyways. Next time I'll add a bit of cilantro!

I made this soup for the slowcooker but wanted to speed things up a bit, so I started it out in a 5 qt pot on the stove and cooked for about 30 min or so until the chicken was done. I shredded it and then put everything in the slowcooker for about 2 1/2 hrs. It tasted delicious! I did add the beer but used Budlight since several of the reviews said the beer taste was overwhelming. The only other thing I did differently was use Pace chunky salsa in place of the rotel.

No wonder this soup got so many stars!  It's excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the beer (didn't want to use my Guinness).  I just substituted that with low-sodiium chicken broth.  I made this twice and realized that the key in tender chicken is breaking it up really well.  If you don't break it up well, it'll just turn out like any ol' slow-cooker chicken breast - tough and chewy. This is great to freeze too!

I thought it was good. I added some chili powder to the mix. It just tasted like it was missing something. It kind of reminded me of a watery chili. We topped it with sour cream, cheddar cheese and avacado. Would make again!

This is ok...would I make it again?...not so much. I had the slow cooker on high and still I found the chicken tough. 3 "whole" chicken breasts is a lot...we found it a bit too much. This wasn't terrible - just very average...

Very delicious and easy to prepare. My only criticism is that there wasn't quite enough spice for my tastes. Next time I will add more taco seasoning and some extra chili powder.

This was great, especially on a very rainy monday.  I halved the recipes, since I was only feeding my husband and myself.  I don't like Kidney beans, so I used a 15oz can of black beans instead.  I added the entire 8oz can of tomato sauce and used chicken stock since I didn't have any beer in the house.  My husband ate 3 servings.  This is definately a keeper!

The chicken turns out super moist and flavorful!  A few changes I will make for next time: Instead of 3 chicken breasts, we felt it only needed 2.  Instead of the extra chicken, I will add another can of beans.  Probably a 3-bean mix (pinto, kidney, black).  I also omitted the beer, and used broth instead.  Added chili powder, cumin, and black pepper.  Very easy and delicious recipe, will make again!

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I had to on this one.  This is possibly the best slow cooker recipe I have ever made.  I have a 6 qt. slow cooker so I doubled the chicken recipe, used a 30 oz. can of tomato sauce, used only one can of the diced tomato with chiles, and it came out awesome.  I used 2 cups of frozen corn since I didn't have canned corn.  I also used the recipe for the taco seasoning described in the 1st review from the person who submitted the recipe, however, omitted the red pepper flakes and decreased the chili powder amount because I have small children.  The entire crockpot was devoured - each person ate 3 bowls each.  It was truly amazing!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!!

My family loves this one. You can customize so easily too, more or less of one thing, add jalapenos for heat, use pork instead of chicken, etc. But not matter what we do it still comes out great. Serve with chips and a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese.

Love it!! My changes: chicken broth instead of beer. I left out the black beans (not a big bean fan). Served it with crackers instead of chips because I forgot to get some. Will be making this more often.

I found the beer gave it a bitter taste that I did not like.  I would not put it in next time, I'd use a chicken broth instead.  To suit to my taste, I added a cup of chicken broth, 2 tsp suger, 1 tsp cayenne pepper and small can of tomatoe paste.  This reduced the bitterness beautfully, and we really enjoyed.  Will make again with those changes.  Still, a welcome recipe, thank you.

I'm really surprised that this turned out as well as it did.  It's very, very good and makes terrific comfort food.  It doesn't look very appetizing when you dump everything in your crock pot but after 6 or 7 hours it turns out great.

OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!  This has got to be THE BEST soup I've had in a long time.  I didn't have any beer, so I substituted a 14 ounce can of chicken broth instead.  Then I discovered I was out of taco seasoning mix, so I searched for a recipe here and found Taco Seasoning I, with 1000 reviews and a 5-star rating that it very much deserves.  Thank you for a great recipe, Patti!!

This was great!! I used frozen corn, large can of diced tomatoes (what I had), small can of green chilies, I only added 1/2 bottle of beer (Hic) as I used a large can of diced tomatoes, and followed the rest, turned out wonderful and yummy, served with fat free sour cream and grated light cheddar cheese. Thanks for sharing your recipe Patti!!

This soup, which is actually more like a chili, is delicious. I omitted the beer and added about 12 ounces of chicken broth. It's really great with sour cream and cheese on top, and it seemed to get better the next day! I will definitely make this again, and may add some green and red peppers and possibly some rice.

This was fantastic!! Quite a few people asked for the recipe. I did add another 1/2 can of chicken broth to mine since it seemed too thick. But it was delicious with just the right spices. YUM!!

I used chicken broth in place of the beer. I only used 1 1/2 cans of rotel. The soup was really good. This makes a full crock pot so it is good for when you have company. I added lowfat sourcream, shredded mild chedder,and crushed tortilla chips. Super!

This so fast and easy to make, and all of my guests loved it.  However, in addition to the toppings suggested, I also used avacado and cilantro.

Fantastic soup - much better than anticipated!  It turned out to be a favorite of our entire family.  We substituted spicy taco seasoning and spicy chili beans and our whole family loved the taste.  We didn't experience much heat from the substitutions, so I added some cayenne pepper to mine.

I think the boys really liked it.  I didn't use the beer and the chicken breasts were placed into the crock pot from a frozen state.  It was REALLY simple and the leftovers were ALL eaten up!  2ND TIME WE SPICED IT UP MORE, (used 1.5 lbs chicken breasts).

This recipe was really great. I made it in the slow cooker. I did use a taco seasoning recipe from this site (Uncle Bill's, I believe).  Very delicious!

I don't drain the corn, just pour everything in. Used taco seasoning from this site. I use stock if I'm out of beer. This is the easiest soup to make, and everyone always loves it!!! Perfect.

This recipe is good but mine tasted a lot like beer and was thick, not much like soup. I would probably make it again tho just make a few changes.

This soup is excellent. We used one can of chicken broth rather than beer. For years I have searched for the Chicken Tortilla Soup recipe from Chili's and this soup tastes almost identical to it! Once dished up, we put shredded cheddar cheese on top, then crumbled fritos over that. Excellent!!

This is my all time favorite recipe and make it every other week. The only change I've made is that I use frozen corn instead of canned and I use 4 frozen chicken breast...I can never remember to take them out of the freezer ahead of time - and I've never noticed a difference by using thawed or frozen chicken.

I wish we liked this because it sounded really good. The beer gave it a terrible flavor. We tolerated it for dinner but then it sat in the fridge... :( Maybe I'll try it again without the beer because I think the flavor wouldn't be as "yeasty".

This was very good.  And I don't think it gets any easier than this.  The hardest part was shredding the chicken.  Since some reviewers noted the flavor of beer, I went ahead and used chicken broth instead.  And since the recipe does not specify, I did not drain or rinse the beans.  Since it came out well, I assume this was correct.  I also cut down cook time to about 5 hours by cooking on medium.  And tortilla chips in the bowl definitely gave it that little extra heartiness and flavor.  This is a keeper.

Great Recipe! It does come out very chili-ish, so I added 2 cups of chicken broth to get a more soup consistency.  I also cut up corn tortillas into strips and added them in the beginning. They completely dissolved and added to the flavor. I topped it with fresh avocado, sour cream, crumpled tortilla chips and shred cheese.

I made this for a  pot luck lunch we had at my work. I followed it exactly as follows and got many complements on the dish. I however am not a big fan of beer and I could smell and taste the hint of beer which threw me off a bit. I didn't notice the spice but my husband the next day did. The second time I made this, I changed a view things and it was absolutely delicious. I used a can of Chicken broth instead of the beer, regular tomatoes instead of ones with chili peppers and omitted the tomato sauce and onion and to me it was perfect. This is a great and easy recipe to follow to the tee or to make any variations to suit your tastes.

This was wonderful.  Pretty much followed recipe as is because I hate it when people make a thousand changes and then rate it.  I did however use precooked frozen chicken leg quarters. Put in the crock frozen and then shredded.  Awesome soup, I can't wait to take to a party.  Thanks.

One bite in to this delicious soup, my husband declared it "a keeper." I subbed 12 oz of vegetable stock for the beer, just in the interests of keeping calories down. I also only had one can of Rotel, so I added about half a can of extra water. To reduce the sodium content, I drained and rinsed the beans, then dumped them back into the can and filled with water to get the proportions right. We also used Bill's Taco Seasoning as recommended (it's on this site as Taco Seasoning I), but cut the salt in half. To make this meatless, we used about half a bag of Quorn chicken-style chunks instead of the chicken. I made the soup a day ahead and added the Quorn when I reheated on the stovetop, but I'm sure you could add it a couple of hours before serving. I loved this with crushed tortilla chips on top. It was plenty spicy for my tastes, but my husband added hot sauce. We're already looking forward to the leftovers!

I can't even remember if I've written a review for this recipe yet.  I make it all the time!  I've almost always got everything on hand and if I don't, I toss in something to substitute.  Hasn't failed me yet!  One day when the kids aren't home I'm going to make a spicy version and add some jalapenos and the hot and spicy Taco seasoning.  I have yet to make it with beer either, but its fine with broth, which I always have in the cupboard.  I started it late tonight and we're all drooling waiting for the chicken to be cooked through.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is awesome!! The only change I made was 12 ounces of chicken broth instead of beer and I used low sodium ingredients. I served this for my bible study group and everyone asked for the recipe!! Fabulous!!

Thanks for the fabulous recipe. So easy and delicious.  Did use Bill's Taco Seasoning mix in this.  That's a keeper too. I used a can of chili beans in hot gravy and a can of kidney beans.  Left the rest of the recipe as is.  Topped with sour cream, grated cheddar cheese & cilantro. Yum!!! Definitely will use this soup recipe and variations of this recipe alot. My 18 years old said this was the bomb, which means fantastic in teenager talk.

Fantastic soup.  Used chicken broth in lieu of beer and it turned out great (tried once with beer and it tasted off to me).

My wife and I loved the recipe!  I doubled the amount of chicken which made it more of a gumbo - I served it over rice.  Big hit!

If you are craving Chicken Taco Soup, then this recipe will hit the spot.  It is not a 'WOW I love this' recipe but it is very good. I followed the recipe exactly and used the recommended seasoning recipe -which IS a must!-  Will definately make again.  This is the best recipe like this I have found.

I followed this recipe and added a few changes for more flavor and was not that impressed.  I added fresh garlic and some sea salt and pepper. I used all organic ingredients, which are pricier and was disappointed at the result. After reading others reviews, I have to agree that the soup goes wrong with the addition of the beer. My soup had a very strong beer flavor. This is a good base for a soup, but next time I would use chicken stock and and skip the taco seasoning and use my own seasons that are more fresh. There are much better recipes out there for this type of soup.

This recipe was AMAZING!  I made it for co-workers and they LOVED IT and are all asking for the recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of beer, like others suggested.  This will be a staple in our family for years to come!

Loved this recipe! I used Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning that Patti Kane recommended and I do think it "makes" the recipe.  I also put the chicken into the crock pot frozen (it was very thin - I think it's Perdue Select Size filets or something) and let them thaw/cook in the soup and it worked like a charm. They were pre-trimmed, so that wasn't an issue.  My husband specifically asked me to make sure this made it on to my "Make this again and again" list!

This was a really good, easy soup.  I used 1 can of chicken broth in place of the beer and also used mild Rotel instead of the original.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand to make Bill Echol's taco seasoning, so I just used a packet of McCormick's taco seasoning, and it was great!  Can't wait to go home and eat leftovers tonight!

This is really good.... more of a chili than a soup I thought.  Adding a little sour cream to your bowl is key. So good!

Wow...this was sooo good, there almost wasn't any left for doh when he got home! Even my 6 year old daughter loved it and asked me to make it again the next night. The only thing I did different was to add a little more corn (and I used Bill's taco seasoning recipe as the submitter recommended). It's good with or without cheese and/or sour cream. Yum!

This recipe is a real gem! It's so easy to toss everything into the crock pot and come home to a delicious meal! We sprinkled ours with cheddar-jack cheese, added sour cream and scooped it up with tortilla chips. So delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  I used chicken broth like most of the others and I used the seasonings that were recommended in one of the reviews. I only used 1 can of black beans. I used frozen chicken breast and cooked on low 10 hours while I was at work and when I came home  the chicken was falling apart and it was delicious.  We topped with shredded cheese and fresh tomatoes (fresh avocado would be great too) and ate it with tortilla chips.  Great Recipe!

Best soup I think I've ever made.  I decided to make it into a true soup, however, instead of a chili.  To do this, I added a 48 oz. can of chicken broth in addition to the beer.  Other modifications: used the recipe author's directions to make my own taco seasoning, used frozen corn, and used a can of diced tomatoes, a small can of mild green chiles, and a small can of hot jalapenos.  One other tip: toward the end of cooking, I decided to pull the onions that had floated to the top because they were still quite raw, and saute them for a few minutes in the residual liquid before returning them to the slow cooker.  This worked nicely.  The soup was MUY picante, but sooo good.  Garnished with lime, avocado, crushed tortilla chips, sour cream and cheddar.  I will make this again and again and again and again.

I am not typically a fan of soup, but this was easy, tasty and pleased the whole family.  I did not use the 2 cans of beans the recipe called for, as I did not have them on hand, and I am not a fan of beans, and it still came out great. I also placed the chicken breasts in frozen...they were so tender that I only had to poke them with the tongs a few times to get them to shred. I cooked on low for 8 hours. Definetely add the sour cream, a healthy handful of cheese (cheddar or monterrey jack) and fresh avocados on the individual bowls before serving--it makes the soup. I was not all that impressed with the smell and taste while it was cooking, but was in for a great surprise when it was done. I will make again!

I made it on the stove since I thought about it too late to do it in the crock pot - only took 35 min from start to finsh. I also added a little extra cumin and chili powder since we like it spicy. So fast and tasty! This will definitely be a keeper.

simply Ah-mazing!! so very easy and so very yummy! I forgot the tomato sauce, so i used 12oz can of V8 (bumps up the nutrition anyway). 2nd time i made it, i made more of a 'stoup' by adding 1cup of COOKED rice (a little al dente) about 45 minutes before being done..it  helped 'thicken' it up a little. Great either way!!!

I made modifications to this since I didn't have 2 cans of the tomatos with chiles so I used a can of chicken broth instead. I also didn't put any beer in the recipe after reading other reviews. I added some onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and it came out delicious. My family couldn't stop eating it!

Is a wonderful recipe that is easy to make and taste great. It took 5 mins to throw together and my family ate it 2 nights in a row (which is unheard of). Have told my all my friends about it.

This is AWESOME soup! My 20 year old son loved it also.  I did make some changes.   1) I used 5 boneless skinless chicken thighs, as we prefer dark meat 2) I used the "Taco Seasoning 1" recipe on this site instead of the package of taco seasoning. (Bill Echols taco seasoning) 3) I used frozen corn 4) I am not a beer drinker, and did not have it in the house, so used chicken broth. If I had beer in the house, I would have added it. 5) I used 2 cans of chili beans (we love beans). I found chili beans at Safeway, S&W has them. The can that was labeled "chili beans" was really a can of pinto beans, chili peppers, onion and garlic in a zesty tomato sauce.   This was a very hearty soup, more of a chili (probably because I used 2 cans of beans), and it was delicious! When finished, we topped with shredded Mexican cheese and sour cream. I will definitely make this again!

EDIT: I made this again and used beer instead of chicken broth, and the beer version is much better. I also used a mixture of chicken breasts and thighs. The only other changes I made were to add 2 chopped poblano peppers and 1 chopped red pepper to up the veggie content. Squeezed the juice of 2 limes in it at the end. Delish!

Loved this recipe. Used rotisserie chicken since I put on before leaving for work for the day, also used chicken broth instead of beer like some other reviews said.

This soup is great!  It is so easy to make...I made it exactly as directed, but the only corn I had on hand was creamed corn!  Oops!  No fear, it was delicious.  I'll make this again!

We really enjoyed this soup.  Omitted the beer b/c didn't have any.  Added a bit of water and an extra can of tomatoes.  Before serving I stirred in a bit of evaporated milk (needed to use up) and it added a great creaminess.  Will make again & again.

I loved this recipe!!!  I used chicken broth in place of the beer, and Monterrey Jack cheese in place of the cheddar and it was wonderful!  It was great to be able to start this first thing in the morning and have dinner done when we were ready to eat with minimal effort.  Thanks so much!

Only gave it four stars b/c I didn't have all the ingredients on hand to try recipe 'as is', but my husband and I LOVED the result of what I did have! As others suggested, I used Lt. Red Kidney beans (2 cans undrained) instead of (1 can) Chili beans, kept corn/black beans, onion, tomato sauce, & taco seasonings the same, used (1 can) no salt added diced tomatoes, added 1 Cup of salsa instead of the diced tomatoes/green chilis, & no beer. Also used 3 frozen chicken breasts, cooked on high ~5 hours and everything was done perfectly. Usually I don't add sour cream on top of soups, but with this one, it was a MUST for pulling out the flavors a bit more. Delicious!! UPDATE: used the chili beans as recipe says second time I made this, and didn't like the flavor. Felt like the taco seasoning and the chili beans were too much of the 'same thing,'so made soup 'blander'. Will only use Kidney beans from now on! Excellent recipe!! Thanks!!

This was de-lish! I was looking for something hot and warm to make for my boyfriend on a cold night. It was the perfect recipe. I used a rotissere chicken instead and cooked the soup on the stove top since i dont have a crock pot. Everything else i did the same. I will definately be making this again!!

Soooo good!  Like a few others I also doubled this recipe and cooked it stove top. I added chicken broth in addition to the  beer. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to shred and wow, this was loved by my entire family (including the kids who initially looked at it with hesitation). Definitely a keeper!

I tasted this and I have to admit, it was very good.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but my very picky clients LOVED it!!  They even asked me to make more.  So, if you're truly a Mexican food fan, then this is definitely one you must have.

I drained the black beans just so the soup wouldn't be too dark and just added a little extra water to the other cans I didn't drain.  Other than that I didn't change anything, and it was enough for us to eat on every day for 3 days.  Great fall/winter dish.

Made this recipe as stated, except we used chicken stock in the place of beer as many reviewers suggested, and it was a hit! It was thick,more like a chili than a soup, and turned out nice and spicy, tomato-y and healthy, as well, which is a nice bonus... A great recipe - thanks!

Delicious!  Cooked on low for ~10 hours (I didn't feel like waking up at 3am to cut up chicken..) and it turned out beautifully.  Followed recipe pretty closely, but this is a great recipe to improvise and play with....I will making this often.  :)

Wonderful, flavorful and easy! Added sliced green onions and fresh cilantro on top with the sour cream and tortilla chips, perfection! We like heat so used the hot Rotel and hot chili beans, it was perfect!

Great recipe. I had it the first night in homemade bread bowls. The second night I drained a lot of the liquid and added 1.5 cups of cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream and had this as a dip with nacho chips. It got rave reviews!

What an unbealivable recipe.  The only thing i had to adjust was the slow cooker temperature, as the chicken didn't cook during the 5 hours on low (so I added an hour on the stove top at low/medium heat).  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic soup!  Will definitely make this a common dish in our house.  We don't keep beer on hand so I just used chicken broth.  Worked out just fine.  Also, I had no idea what chili beans were so I used the kidney beans I had on hand.  

One tip... if you are feeding folks who don't care for spicy foods you might want to omit the peppered tomatoes and just get the regular ones.  Or cut back on the taco spices.  We like it spicy so it was perfect for us.

Yummy! Ok, so I made a few minor changes, as some other reviewers suggested, I subbed out the beer in favor of one can of chicken broth, and cut the actual amount of chicken down to two large breasts.  Since I LOVE spicy foods, I made the taco seasoning (the way the author recommends in her review) but added some extra chili powder, cumin, and a touch extra garlic powder.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours, because that's just how my day worked out.  Even though it turned out more like chili than soup, it was the absolute BEST chicken chili I'd ever had! I will definitely be making this again, it was amazing!

This is a great soup!  My whole family liked it which is a rare moment.  Kind of spicy with the Rotel, but the kids didn't seem to mind.  I did use chicken broth instead, 2 large chicken breasts and the website taco seasoning.

I'm editing this after tinkering with the recipe a few times.  I've found that using chipotle-flavored taco seasoning gives the soup a bit more zip, which we prefer.  Cooking for a longer time (up to 10 hours) over a very low setting also seems to make the chicken tastier and easier to shred.  Topping with sour cream, shredded cheese and tortilla strips is a must!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very tasty and so easy! I followed the recipe closely except used chicken broth instead of beer. 
I served it with slices of avocado on top and sour cream or cheese on the side for individual preference.
A perfect recipe for a cold, busy night.

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was ok, but a bit bland.  I used store bought taco seasoning and I agree w/ reviewers that say skip the beer.  Next time I will add more spices and use broth.

This way exceded my expectations!  Unbelievably easy to put together and really good.  I subbed 12 oz chicken broth for the beer and added a couple of shakes of garlic powder and cumin.   I also added extra chicken. We shredded some of the chicken and chunked some of it.  I topped with sour cream, shredded Mexican queso cheese and lime Tostitos corn chips.  I liked the soupy consistency but did notice as we were eating it the chips softened and thickened the broth - really yummy.  We are used to having soup and grilled cheese so for a Mexican flair I served cheese quesadillas on the side. I definitely will be making this again.

ok...admittedly i'm not the best cook in the world...nor did i follow the recipe to the "t" but....i'm thinking something else is just not right cause it doesn't sound like it should have gone that wrong....it turned out quite sweet-ish and really thin, and not "taco"-tasting at all...here's what i did/didn't do:
**what are "chili" beans anyway?  i used red kidney beans.  i did not drain the 1st can of (red) beans (i doubled the recipe since it had such good ratings!) and i may not have drained one of the cans of black beans.  could that be why it was so sweet (definitely sugar in some brands of canned beans)?
**i ended up putting the onions (2) in last since i wanted to get the chick started cooking...and i thought they were pretty prominent tasting...?too much vs maybe it was important that they were on the bottom?
**beer -- my husband had only bottles of "leffe", a "strong beer" (so it says on the label)...but i used only 1, instead of 2 (my kids thought they could taste it...don't know if it was power of suggestion or not)
**i did add a touch of chili powder and cumin, a pretty small amt for such a HUGE vat of stew/soup
**cooked on high, instead of low, about 5 hrs altogether
**at the end i thickened it with a little cornstarch (that shouldn't change the taste, should it?)
any thoughts/comments would be appreciated..especially any suggestions to improve on it now ... i have tons of leftovers!!! :)

Another winner!  I doubled the recipe (for a crowd...)and made this without the beer and I added Fajita seasoning for some of the spices because I didn't have taco seasoning and it was still great!  I've had manny compliments on this one.

Outstanding!  I cut it in half for my husband and I and still had leftovers.  I used butter beans because it was all I had, and it turned out great. I used Bill Echols taco spice and put that much in for half a batch and it was perfect. I would double his spice for the original recipe.

Brought this to a pot luck and it was a hit. Easy to make while gone at work. One thing I messed up on was the beans I used was spicy so the soup had a slight spicey flavor to it, but nothing that kept people from eating it. It is even better once chilled and eaten as a leftover.

Loved this soup.  Would never leave out the beer as some suggest.  I did add a can of refried beans for a thicker soup.
My husband who hates spicy hot foods really really liked this soup.  A winner!

I'll be honest...there really wasn't anything that stood out in this recipe that made me think that it was going to be great, but I'll tell you what...this was FABULOUS!  I absolutely loved it and had plenty left over to freeze and take to work with me!  I would gladly make this for my friends and family!  It is so good!!

Yum!  I didn't have the corn and I subbed beer for chicken broth (per other reviews).  The soup was great!  We added crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese.  I'll definitely be making this again.  And having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  :)

YUM - I will make this again.  I only added one can of tomatoes, rather than two.  I added one small can of green chili's and did not drain the corn when I added it.  The corn and the chilis provided enough extra juice for the broth.  The corn juice also sweetened up the broth a bit, as the beer does make it slightly bitter.  Great Recipe! Thank You!

This was delicious!!! I made a few minor changes only because it's what I had on hand. I only had one can of Rotel so I made up the difference with chicken stock, which I also substituted for beer. I used frozen whole kernel corn and rinsed the beans so the soup wouldn't have a "muddy" taste. (I added a little extra corn right at the end for added texture.) It cooked all day on low and it was perfect and ready to eat when we got home. My family loved it so much they want more next week!

This is great!  I added lime juice and sliced chilies after a couple of days (to change it up a little) and it worked out even better!  This makes a ton, so be prepared to eat this over and over and over again from just one batch.  Oh and I totally skipped the beer and added just chicken broth.  Great recipe though.

Excellent recipe.  I used two cans of chili beans and omitted the corn.  Also used broth instead of beer as suggested by other reviewers.  My husband and kids loved the taste and I loved having dinner ready when I got home from work.

I am giving the recipe 5 stars. I did use the chicken broth, was not sure about the taste of beer. I also used 1/2 pack of taco season  and about 2 tbs of chili powder and a little sugar. The night before I put everything except the chicken in my cooker pot and put it in the refrigerator, the next morning I threw the chicken in and went off to work. When I got home that afternoon dinner was done. My kids and husband loved the soup/chili..will definitely have this again and again.

VERY GOOD!!!! I made some changes however, as other people suggested. I replaced the beer with a can of chicken broth, I added a small can of green chilis, added about 1 tsp. of cumin, and about 1 TB. of chili powder. I also had low sodium taco seasoning, so I put that in there since other people thought it was salty. My chicken was a little tough, so maybe next I will change the cooking time.

This recipe was easy, but it seemed to lack in depth of flavor and the chicken was surprisingly tough.  I ended up using a little corn starch to thicken the soup to make it more of a hearty meal.  To improve on the chicken texture, I'll probably use a shredded rotisserie chicken in the last 2 hours next time.  I am sure I'll make it again.

Curious about making this. It turned out pretty good. Too spicy for my taste, so I'll add 1 regular diced tomato and 1 with green chile. I, also, took the advice of using chicken broth than beer. I would make it again and recommend to friends.

I followed the recipe "as is" and I think it is a wonderful soup!  Very easy to make.  The beer gives a great flavor, and the green chiles give a little kick.  I did cut down the cooking time slightly because I was thought the chicken might get too dry.  I shredded the chicken after 4 1/2 hours and then cooked again for 1 hour instead of two.  I melted some cheddar on top and served with sour cream and crushed Frittos.  Wonderful!  Thank you for this easy recipe!

It doesn't get much easier!!!  I added an extra can of hot & spicy chili beans with a big TBSP. of chili powder.  Used two cups of broth (no beer).  Served with colby cheese, chili-cheese flavored fritos, sour cream & Frank's Red Hot.  Made cheese and mushroom quesadillas to have on the side.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is perfect for a pot luck as it makes a lot, especially for a small family we had a ton left over.  Very good southwestern flavor, & with a bit of sour cream on top, warm comfort food.

This is delicious, and looks very appealing too!  I had half a rotisserie chicken left over, so I shredded it, sprinkled it with taco seasoning, added it after 5 hours, and then proceeded as directed. The chicken absorbed the flavors and was so tender.   This is a delicious meal served with the Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this site!

This is really good! I used the seasoning recipe in the first review. I used a Miller Lite for the beer. It's a bit spicier than I thought it would be, so I don't think I will be giving it to my toddler. My chicken was ready to shred in 4 hours, not 5. Yum!

This was awesome.  I used kidney beans instead of black because my husband's allergic to black beans. Also, I added chili powder and cumin.  It turned out wonderful!  I,my husband and 4 little ones (even my super picky 1yr old) all love it!

I know this would be five stars with the beer.  I, however, used two cans of low sodium chicken broth instead.  Why chicken broth instead of beer?  I don't waste my beer in food - I'm on a budget.  Why two cans of broth?  With one can it seemed too much like a stew or chili - too thick.  I wanted more of a soup-like texture.  Everything else followed exact.  Huge hit!  Everyone went nuts over this!  SO EASY.  I will definately be making this again.  Hopefully right after payday so I can spare a couple beers and try it that way.

Fabulous recipe!!  I substituted chicken broth for the beer, and I've found that I can put frozen chicken breasts in (I put it on high for about an hour, then low for 5-7 hours).  So easy and so delicious!  This recipe has become a real standby for me--I try to have the ingredients in the cupboard all the time in case I need to throw something together with short notice.

I have to say- I added sour cream, a blend of mexican cheeses and crumpled Fritos to the soup as garnishes, and it made ALL the difference!! I didn't even mind the beer (couldn't really taste it at that point)! I had to change my star rating from a 4 to a 5. I love this recipe now, and I will definetly make it again. The possibilities are endless, but I will certainly use chicken broth next time.

This was really good.  I used 2 chicken breasts, regular diced tomatos, and added frozen corn at the very end (cooked in 2 minutes).  Next time, i'll use 1 can stewed and 1 diced and i'll rinse the beans before adding them into the slow cooker.

I never cook this for longer than an hour, b/c I don't think ahead.... I use chicken broth instead of beer, and usually add a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it, and blend flavors for a family who doesn't like it "spicy" (even though I don't think it is!)

I thought this recipe had great flavor but too much spice for us.  I used the taco seasoning listed here and it was way too spicy.  I think I'd cut down on the quantity.  I made this with 1 can of black beans, no chili beans because I didn't have any.  Also made with chicken broth instead of the beer.  Only used 2 1/2 breasts but that was enough for us. I cut up my chicken first and just cooked it the whole time and it turned out great (I tossed it with some of the seasoning before throwing it in).  I think this is a great recipe with great flavor but I'll have to tone it down a bit.  We had the sour cream & chips that helped take some of the spice out.  Got even spicier the next day but we suffered thru it because the basic taste was great.  Only made enough for 2 meals for the 2 of us - maybe we just eat a lot but it didn't go as far as some of the other reviewers said!  Very easy too!

I think this recipe is great because you put the chicken in raw rather than precooked.  Fast to assemble.  I used cumin as others suggested.  Enjoy!!

This recipe is awesome!  I did change some things based on the other reviews though; used chicken broth instead of beer (but next time, I think I'll leave most of this out since I like it as a thick chili more than a soup), used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe, and I also used ground chicken instead of breasts but only because that was all I had on hand.  Since I used ground chicken (browned on the stove first), I kept in the slow cooker for a lot less time (maybe 3 hours?).  Even my picky boyfriend who hates beans and chili loved this though : )

Have made this several times.  I have tried a few variations and think I finally have it perfect for my taste.  I have added extra tomato sauce and a can of diced tomotoes, but felt it ended up too soupy an dulled down the taste.  I've tried an extra packet of taco seasoning, but this left it too salty.  So, in my last batch, I made the following adjustments, and it turned out great:  Used frozen corn (canned corn, yuck!), 2 cans of drained black beans (love um), chicken broth vs beer, and the biggest change was I added about 4-5 chopped chipolte peppers and a little of the adobo sauce in which it was canned.  As expected and desired, this gave it even more of a spicy punch.  My grocery store does not carry the spicy version of the Rotel tomatoes/chilies, so I wanted to spice it up a bit without having to add to the salt via the taco seasoning. This freezes well which is a huge plus.

Deeelish!  Had this recipe saved for awhile now and finally threw it together this morning before work.  So glad I did. It really is wonderful.  Only change was that I substituted tomatoe juice for the diced tomatoes as family does not like chunks of tomatoe in anything.  Great recipe.

I started the night before by soaking dried beans.  I was able to adapt this for my low sodium needs.  It had wonderful flavors.  Wonderful texture.  We served it as a side with taco salad.  We froze the leftovers and it was wonderful the second time around as well.
This will be on our table many more times in the future.

I loved this recipe... i changed it a little because of what I had in my cupboard.  I had left over Ropa Vieja meat (slow cooked flank steak with cuban seasonings),  I did not have tomatoes with green chilies so I used stewed tomatoes and chopped up jalapenos.  Anyway this is a keeper--- it will be a good leftover    dish since I usually make black beans with Ropa Vieja.  Yum, Yum!

I should have paid more attention and didn't realize this was for a larger slow cooker.  I have a 5 qt, so I ran out of room once after I put in the first can of tomatoes.  It's simple even for me to make and reminds me of chili.

This was so very good and so very easy!  I used 3 chicken breasts and kicked it up a little more with some hot sauce, served on the side.  Shredded cheese, sour cream and chopped green onion to sprinkle on the top.  This is a keeper.

Very good, easy recipe!  Makes a TON!  I made a couple of changes - I used a 5 oz can of V8 juice instead of tomato sauce and a 14 oz can of chick broth (both were low sodium) instead of the beer!  Very tasty and fairly healthy too!

This is the best thing I've ever done in a crock pot!  My hubby loved it.  I did use chicken broth instead of beer and added some extra cumin and chili powder.  I also added a can of kidney beans. I rinsed all the beans except the chili beans to try to keep the sodium down a little.  There are very few low fat recipes that don't require trips to the store for produce and lots of chopping.  This is easy to put together with ingredients that are already in the house and it couldn't be quicker!!

This was excellent. I substituted 2 cans of White Chicken breast (shredded it first) instead as it was easier...placed it in about an hour before serving. I also used canned diced tomato with green chilis instead of fresh tomato. I forgot to add the beer so it was very thick...I will definitely make this again!

This was great. I omitted the beer and didn't add any more liquid so it was more like a chili than a soup. I also used a home canned quart jar of stewed tomatoes instead of the cans of diced tomatoes and chilies. I cooked it on high for about 2 1/2 hours then shredded the chicken and put it back in for another 45 minutes still on high. It came out great. We ate it with the chips like a dip and it was very tasty.

I like using chicken broth instead of beer. My kids don't care for the beer taste, but they love it when I make it with chicken broth.

I made this according to the recipe and used the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning Mix also on this site. It was FANTASTIC as a soup. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts(cheaper but in a slow cooker just as good). I like spicy foods and this lived up to the billing but there was one spice that I did not care for. I believe it was the cumin, I would cut back on this spice, but if you have a bowl and decide it needs more then add some. It is easier to add spices than to remove them. It is so simple to make you gotta try it!!!

For as easy as this was to prepare, it was shockingly good.  I made the recipe as written and served it with the cheddar, sour cream, and tortilla chips.  I did make it with the beer and couldn't even taste it in the finished product so I'm surprised to see some of the previous posts complaining about the overwhelming beer taste.  Very good soup and perfect on this rainy winter night.

Simply fabulous!  I didn't add the beer as it's not something we usually have.  Instead I used chicken broth.  My entire family loves this dish and it smells fantastic cooking.  The first day I made it, I had the windows open and the mailman came to the door to deliver a package and said "I don't know what that is, but something smells wonderful!"

This was very good! I cut up the chicken and served 40 minutes later...I'm not sure why you have to let it go for another 2 hours, because the chicken was definitely cooked. At the same time that I shredded the chicken, I also added about 1 cup of rice, deciding that I didn't want "soup". It ended up just a little thicker, more like a chili. The texture of the rice was also better, I think, than it just being a soup. Overall, it was wonderful! I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.

This was great and easy to make! I dont eat Black or Red beans, but LOVED them in this soup. My husband loved it as well. Just needed more heat and some spice. I seasoned the chicken before placeing in crock-pot, and added cheese when I shredded the chicken.  Will make again, but add some heat!

My family loved this recipe!! It's delicious, full of flavor, and very hearty. A great cold winter night recipe! My twelve year old daughter had two helpings and packed it in her school lunch the next day. I used chicken stock instead of the beer, and definitely use the recipe for Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning. It really packs a lot of flavor, and I like not putting in the extra additives that comes in the packaged stuff. Can't wait to try it on tacos!

Really tender chicken and tasty soup. Ours was more like a chili as I used a large can of diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce, but it was great. We scooped it up with tortillas instead of crushing them into the soup/chili.

My only complaint is that the flavor was a little dull. Next time I'll add more chili powder (used the seasoning recipe recommended on here and it didn't seem to be powerful enough to add much flavor) or possibly some chipotle peppers with adobo sauce for a little more kick. I'm not a hot spice freak, but this could have used a little more oomph. But I wouldn't have been disappointed if I had served this to guests.

Outstanding ... more of a chili than a soup in my opinion ... took the advice of other reviewers and added some garlic powder and cumin (hence the chili reference).  Used 2 bone-in chicken breasts, removed them after 5 hours, cooled shredded and cooked for another 3 hours.  Fabulous, easy and now a staple in our meal rotation!

YUMMY!  Perfect. I didn't change a thing.  But do make sure you sprinkle with some cheddar cheese, sour cream & chips - it makes a wonderful addition.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Perfect winter comfort food!

I left out the black beans & beer.  Tossed in frozen chicken breasts, and they were done in the 5 hours allotted.  Soup was delicious. Crushed tortilla chips & cheese were delicious additions.

Great recipe! I always end up making changes to every recipe I make, so here is what I will do differently the next time I make it.
1. Reduce the amount of chili powder. I used Patti's recipe for taco seasoning (in the reviews.) I thought it was a little heavy on the chili powder. Next time I will reduce it by half and maybe add some cayenne or a dash of hot sauce to get some heat without the chili flavor.
2. Use two cans of black beans instead of one black and one red. The red beans (combined with too much chili powder) made my brain think I was eating chili.
3. Even this time I used 12 oz. chicken stock instead of the beer. I don't like beer and was afraid the flavor would come through. Also, I am pregnant and can't have alcohol (no, it doesn't all cook out!)

Other than that, thought it was just wonderful. Will definitely be making this again soon.

This is our new favorite slow-cooker recipe! Just as good as chicken-tortilla soup from the restaurants. Very economical too. My family likes spicy food, so I add about a cup of hot salsa and a can of diced green chiles. Smokin'Good!

I made this for dinner the other night and the only change I made was to cook the soup on high for about 5 hours (instead of low).  After I cubed the chicken and added it back, I turned the temperature down to low.  The end result was a really yummy soup, but both my DH and I found that it was the cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla's that really made this dish.  As a side note, this makes a lot of soup, so if you're eating leftovers, the soup gets really thick once it cools, so you might want to consider adding more liquid (chicken stock?).

I really enjoyed this, except for the fact that I could ::really:: taste the beer for some reason and it bugged me even though I love beer. Maybe it was the beer I used (Michelob Ultra Amber)? I will probably skip the beer next time. 

Anyway, great, easy recipe. I also like that I froze it for 2 weeks and it still tasted really good left over (I put it in a Ziploc disposable container with a screw-cap and then just thawed 1-2 days in fridge). Will definitely make this again!

Amazing soup. I have made this 3 times and each time, it is delicious. I love that I can get everything in the crockpot the night before turn it on in the morning. Nothing better than coming home to a complete meal already cooked.

This is a great soup!  My only change is I only used half of the taco seasoning packet, I didn't want it to be too salty.  It turned out wonderful!!  My best friend and sister loved it.  Next time I will use mild chili beans and I bet my 4y/o will love this.

A keeper. My husband actually threw this all in the crockpot, and shredded the chicken at the end; he quite enjoyed it. I think he thought adding beer to food was quite fun, too, although we were both wondering if we should skip that step. But it turned out great--we liked this alot! Thanks!

This was delicious!  Even my 6 and 8 year old children loved it.  I do not recommend the Rotel tomatoes with the chilies.  They were way too spicy.  I found myself scooping the tomatoes out of the pot.  I would recommend using a can of petit diced tomatoes then add chilies separate.

This deserves even more stars! Super easy and really, really tasty.  I made it as written and used the homemade taco seasoning, so it had a little kick.  Served it with Spanish rice and cheese quesadillas.  Delicious recipe!

Easy and yummy!  I used rinsed kidney beans and chili ready diced tomatoes.  I also coated the chicken in the taco seasoning to givve the chicken itself a little more flavor.  I added a little more chili poweder and threw in some garlic powder.  I would keep the beer instead of using water like some reviewers suggest.  It gives it a nice flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I paired this with Paprika Onion bread. My company loved it! We used a porter for the beer, and the taste it added was definitely amazing. I didn't add cheese for garnish, and it was agreed that cheese would have made the meal--but it was still amazing!

Beer flavor very strong. Next time I'll try 1/2 broth as recommended. Add more spice if you like more flavor. With those changes I'll give it 5 stars. Definitely add toppings! Could also eat over rice.

This was so good! Much better the next day!  Followed the recipe, except added some fresh cilentro.  I liked it better with sour cream and/or cheese, but, hubby liked his w/o.  Also used the seasoning as suggested by the submitter in a follow-up review (see below the recipe).  Ohhh...and severed with the Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site...Winner Combo!!

This was excellent. I substituted veggie broth for the beer, and used one can tomatoes and chili's and one can plain diced tomatoes so it wouldn't be too spicy for my young children. I added a T or so of ancho chili powder. Cooked for about 5 1/2 hours. Wonderful!

To be on the safe side, I added one can of tomatoes with chilies and one can of plain diced tomatoes. I was disappointed when the flavor was wayyyy too mild/bland! 

I would highly recommend preparing this AS WRITTEN! Lesson learned on this one! If it had turned out too spicy after making it the right way, I could have just added sour cream to my bowl to tone it down!

I made this soup exactly how it was written up and it was awesome! It is even better the next day! Mine came out thicker like a chili but if you wanted it to be more like a soup add more beer! What a great new recipe for me to share at the next football or hockey gathering! Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe that takes so little effort.  I have made it twice, once with beer, and once without.  It's good either way, but the beer does make it better.  I made it for a family get-together and decided to decrease the chiles to better suit everyone's taste.  I used one can regular tomatoes and one with chiles, and it was still very good.  This gets pretty spicy with both the chiles and the taco seasoning.  I also add a can of tomato soup, about 3/4 cup of cream (sounds crazy, but good), and thickened it with a little cornstarch.  Everyone loved it.  Don't leave out the "fixins", adding the cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream really adds to it.

I loved this recipe! I have had it before with beef but I really liked the chicken. I only used 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies and I used Miller Chill beer with lime and a rotisserie chicken. The house smelled great! Thanks for the great recipe!

Not my favorite.  I felt like the beer was too strong of a flavor in this soup.  Maybe if you left it out?  Not sure.

I really loved this recipe for the taste and simplicity. I used a mexican style beer called Chill. I didn't have chili beans so I used black eyed peas. I didn't have diced tomatos so I used stewed. I used Taco Bell taco seasoning. It was so good. We crushed up some tortilla chip into it while eating. Thank you!

This soup was very good. The only thing that I would add/change would be the heat level - there was none.  I would add one serrano pepper, seeds and all.  That would give this soup the kick that we were looking for.  But it is still good just the way it is, too!

This is a great easy recipe.  I dump in everything and then add left over chicken meat or even better left over pork (dark meat) and cook on high about 4 to 5 hours. I use all chicken broth and finish with crushed tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream.  I make this at work and everyone loves it.  To save time, I put it all together the night before and put in the fridge.  Put in on in the am and it is ready by lunch!

Okay, here is proof of how easy it is to knock this soup out: I prepared it while incredibly sick, eyes half opened due to a pounding headache. And the result was delicious! Thank goodness I had all the ingredients stashed in my pantry and freezer. I was grateful to suddenly have warm soup with flavors strong enough to break through a sinus infection. It helped nurse me back to health, and there was plenty left to enjoy after I recovered. Good food does not always require rocket science and hours of prep, luckily. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is heavenly. It's my husband's favorite meal. I like to use bone in, skin on chicken breasts because it adds flavor. I also don't bother cooking it any longer after I shred the chicken. I love that it's so quick and easy to make.

Not bad. I made it on the stove top. Cooked the chicken in the oven first while the rest of the stuff simmered while covered. Then added the chicken and cooked about 30 minutes on medium(let it come to it's own mild boil, don't rush it), took them out and shredded the chicken, added them back in, cooked a little while longer(does it really matter how long?). Added dashes of cumin, red pepper flakes, chili powder, and some hamburger seasoning I had. Served with crescent rolls, and of course the cheese, sour cream and crushed chips. Also, the diced tomatoes added in were chili ready, used fiesta canned corn. And used minced onion instead of the onion(heaping tablespoon). Plenty left over :)

This was a very good recipe, but a little too spicy for my taste! In the future, I think I'll only put in one can of tomatoes with chiles, but still a great recipe!

This is so delicious!  I will be making this a lot.  I added about 2 to 3 cloves of crushed garlic and I didn't have a taco seasoning mix so the next best thing to use is a chili seasoning mix.  I also threw in a dried cayenne pepper from my garden.  Excellent, loaded with wonderful flavor and delicious with corn muffins!  Oh, and extremely easy!!!

Very good!  I used Italian (oregano, garlic & basil) tomatoes since my little ones don't like things too spicy.  I used kidney beans for the chili beans.

Has been a huge hit with guests every single time.  I use one can of beef broth in place of the beer.  Tastes even better with cornbread on the side (I've enjoyed both homesteader and absolute mexican from this site).

I really liked this recipe, however, it is really a chilli, not a soup. The longer it sits in the refrigerator, the better it tastes. I added green and red pepper and hot sauce.

Very easy and very tasty! I cooked this in a dutch oven and the chicken turned out wonderful. I would definatly recommend the extra 2 hours after pulling the chicken to really let the flavors absorb into the meat. I used 4 chicken breasts (since you can never find packages of less :) so I used the beer but also added a cup of chicken stock. I added an extra can of beans (pinto). Alot of soup but it will definatly dissapear quickly!

This was excellent!  When I shredded the chicken, I put a little can of sliced black olives and a couple stalks of celery (diagonally sliced)in, also. I only used 1/2 pkg. of Taco Seasoning.

I think I will try this with chicken broth next time instead of the beer because I could taste a hint of beer in the broth.  Very good and flavorful.

A staple in the house during the winter. So easy. I have cooked diced chicken on hand in the freezer so this is a quick meal to throw together. I didn't use the chili beans but used kidney beans one time and pinto the other time. I use a can of chicken broth instead of the beer. Cooks well on the stovetop if in a super hurry. The soup freezes well for later -- just remember to pull it out the day or two before. Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband normally  does not like soups but he always gobbles this up when I make it. We have made this recipe multiple times for company and everyone has loved it. I have also given this recipe to a few friends who have raved about it after making it. 
I'll admit the first time I made this I was a bit scared of adding the beer because I HATE the taste of beer, but I have never tasted it  in this. I always use Bud Light for the beer.

This was really delicious, thank you for sharing. I made up 4 of these and froze in big ziplock bags, thawed one each week and then had a super quick meal that cooked while I was running errands! We topped ours with cheddar and chips but avocado slices would have been awesome. Even my 5 year old enjoyed it!

Yummy!  I left out the beer (didn't want to chance it) and used a can of Healthy choice cream of chicken and a cup of water with 1/2 tsp of bullion (low sodium as well as low sodium taco seasoning).  Only had black beans and frozen corn, so I used them.  My husband and I both loved this!  Can't wait to use the leftovers.

Because my wife isn't real fond of beans, I substituted a can of fat free refried beans for the chile beans.  It still added the bean flavor without the beans. I used Miller Lite beer. This recipe is great!

This recipe is amazing! Super easy, inexpensive and simply delicious. I put in 3 solidly frozen legs/thighs and the meat still just fell off the bone. I followed the recipe but used hominy instead of corn. Do use a good beer for a richer flavor.

I rarely eat soup, let alone make it, but I am so glad I did this time!  This soup is SO easy to make and delicious.  The only thing I changed was adding chicken broth instead of the beer (like many other people suggested). Thanks for the recipe!

too spicy for our tastes-next time I will replace one or both of the cans of tom.w/chilies with just regular diced canned tomatoes.  The toppings make this soup!

This was really good and I will make again.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the black beans and chili beans, so I didn't and it came out fine.  Sour cream, corn chips, cheese, avocado as toppers are all a must.

Ok, this soup/stew is awesome!!! First, it just does not get any easier to prepare. Second, it is just plain delicious.  My husband is a little bit picky and really does not care for beans of any kind.  He LOVES this soup!!!  He loves it so much the leftovers don't even last long!!  Wonderful with corn bread or tortilla chips. I also love that I can adjust the "heat" level by the choice of tomatoes and green chilis. I have used the regular once, lots of good heat. And I have used the mild, still really nice flavor.  Great for winter days!!

The beer added a different flavor to the soup rather than your typical broth.  Next time I would probably experiment with a different type of beer.  Had a good kick to it with the taco seasoning, yet not too spicy.  Adding the tortillas, cheese and sour cream added a zip to it too.

This was very delicious and simple to make.  I gave it 4 stars only because I did not think it has an authentic "Mexican" taste.  Perhaps adding a little cilantro near the end of cooking time would make it more authentic tasting.  Next time I will do this.  Thanks for the recipie!

I made this soup exactly as directed - very easy and good. My only complaint is that it was too spicy and salty for my family. Next time I'll rinse the black beans and use one can of tomatoes with chilies and one can of regular diced tomatoes...that ought to fix it for us! Very good.

This was so easy to make and came out wonderful! The texture of the soup was perfect and it was delicous. It makes alot (definitely more than 8 servings). Next time I will add a little cilantro, but other than that I won't change a thing.

I thought this was really good.  It actually tasted almost identical to my beef chili recipe....although I did alter this recipe a little because I didn't have any tomatoes...I substituted the cans of tomatoes for a large can of mild enchillada sauce, a small can of regular tomato sauce and a small can of diced green chilis. I also left out the beer and added chicken stock instead.  I liked how it came out but maybe I'll try it with the diced tomatoes next time to see how much of a difference it will make.

I enjoyed this easy recipe and so did my family. I used 2 cups of frozen corn instead of the canned and used a can of diced chile peppers in addition to the dice tomatoes.  I will certainly make this again.  Next time I will add some red pepper flakes and/or cayenne pepper for some added kick.  I will also try using crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and try to make it a little thicker as a stew.  Some small pieces of pasta might work too!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was delicious. I used chicken broth instead of beer and added about 1 1/2 cans. All four of my kids loved this even my husband who does not like beans. I will be making this again.

Just made this for a pumpkin carving party & everyone loved it.  I thought you could taste the beer a little to much so next time I'll try using chicken stock.  No one else complained about the beer flavor, in fact most couldn't even tell it was in there.  I guess it was just me - since I'm pregnant maybe I'm more sensitive to the taste.

Tis the season for soup like this!  And it was much tastier than I expected from just a bunch of cans dumped in a pot.  I made it on Monday night and my fella and I have dipped from it all week, finishing it off on Thursday.  I actually made it on the stove top, dicing the chicken breast and browning in olive oil first, then adding the onion, taco spice (+ extra "chili" spices from my rack) then a can of coors light (even cheap beer worked) to scrape up all the yummy browned bits. Then added the remaining ingredients and simmered 2 hrs.  I only used about 3/4 of the beans to cut down on...er...you know...The Toots, and never had a problem.  I used no-salt corn and tomato sauce, even though I have no problem with sodium.  Delish served plain or with the suggested toppings and corn chips.  A guacamole salad would be great to round it out.  Thanks for this keeper!

I made only a few changes - used chicken broth instead of the beer, and it tasted great (I might try it with beer sometime, but the only beer in the fridge was my favorite microbrew and I couldn't bear to chance wasting it on a recipe I'd never tried).  I came home from work after nine hours of cooking on low heat before shredding the chicken, and then let it cook for another 2 hours. Cooking it so long didn't seem to make a bit of difference. 
I served with tortilla chips on top, but didn't think it needed any cheese or sour cream.

I have had this recipe for almost a year now and finally made it.  WOW!!  It is excellent.  I used chicken taco seasoning instead of the standard packet for beef.  Used Michelob Ultra for the beer as that was all we had on hand.  This was a super easy and cheap meal to prepare.  Husband and his friends want it again this weekend.

My husband and I both loved this dish.  We made it minus corn and one of the cans of tomatoes with green chilies was spicy.  I don't like beer at all, but I thought it really complimented the spiciness.

tasty soup. however, when i read the recipe, i thought the beer sounded good, but having tasted it, i have to agree with others that found it overwhelming. i would definately use chicken broth instead next time.

This is awesome! It deserves all of 5 stars and then some. I made it with chicken broth instead of beer and used boneless chicken breast and thighs. The tortilla chips and cheese on top just make it even better. Even my picky eater liked it and that doesn't happen often. Thanks so much for this and I will be making this many more times. Oh, I also used the taco seasoning in the review section here and it was great!

This was an AWESOME soup !!  My 12 yr old  said "this is amazingggg"  and ate 2 big bowls! The only change I made was i used chicken broth instead of beer. and let it simmer on the stove instead of the crock pot.  It made so much I had to freeze quite a bit. Freezes and defrosts very nicely! Will definately make it again.... and again.... and again !!

I LOVED This soup! It was better than I had expected and so so easy! I'm actually heating it up in the crock pot now for a friend that's coming over- I'm sure she'll love it too! Make this soup!
Does anyone have the taco seaoning recipe that Patti suggested to use? I can't find it.

This is a great recipe!  I added chicken broth to make it more soupy. It was just a tad thick for my family's liking but the flavor is great!  This is a keeper!

This soup is easy and delicious. My friends kept asking what spices I put in and were amazed at the simplicity of the recipe. I will definitely be keeping this one.

I'd probably rate this a 3.5.  I should have cut the recipe in 1/2 since there are only two of us!  But I think I'll freeze some.  It was good; I thought the flavor was enhanced with the cheese and/or sour cream dollop.  Was hesitant to pour beer in the crockpot, but I did it.  Couldn't taste it at all, but it may have been the very very subtle undercurrent of sweetness I could taste in the broth. Accidentally used a small can of tomato paste, rather than tomato sauce.  Didn't hurt it any.  Used fire-roasted diced tomatoes for added flavor.  Made Taco Seasoning I from this website, rather than using a store-bought packet.  Only used two chicken breasts.  Got a late start on this, and even put the chicken in frozen (cut up), so put it on high for 5 hours. It makes a lot; my crockpot was full to the brim! Served it with chips and Guacamole (by Bob Cody) from this website.  Thank you, Landmarkpatti!

My husband loved it.  At first he is always skeptical, but he ended up having 2nds.  Also, he hates all beans, so I substitute diced potatoes instead and for more substance I served it over yellow rice.

This soup has a fabulous flavor!  I knew I'd love it just by reading the recipe!  I did use 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans, frozen corn, and I was out of tomato sauce, so I used a can of tomato soup. Also, I used 1 original can of Rotel and 1 mild (kids and hubby don't like overly spicy) and it actually had enough zip for me. (I like super spicy) Served with shredded colby jack cheese, sour cream, and corn chips....YUM!!  Will be making this for family and friends regularly!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe, however next time I won't add the beer.  I didn't like the flavor it gave the soup.  I also added the whole can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomoatoes because I didn't have two on hand.  Turned out well.

This soup is an absolute hit!!!  I've had repeated requests for the recipe and have extras on hand in case I'm asked again!!  One of the best things about this recipe is how easy it is to substitute items if needed!

Loved this soup.  Used Amstel beer & 1 more can of corn (just because we love corn).  I have a similiar recipe where I use ground beef, and add a package of ranch dressing mix.  Just as good, and both soups will be made often at this house!

This was excellent.  I  was short on the diced tomatoes so I substituted a can of tomato soup and a can diced chili peppers this worked out well.  I also left out the beer.  My family really enjoyed it.

Very delicious and filling!  Didn't have chicken or beer so I used 1 lb browned ground beef and 1 can beef broth.  Otherwise rinsed the corn & beans from cans as I don't care for the "canned" taste.  Also added an extra 1/2 packet taco seasoning, garlic powder and cumin.  It turned out so yummy!   I made this with the recipe for "Authentic Mexican Tortillas" on this site and it was truly an enjoyable dinner to serve to my family.  This is a recipe for my file!  (I think we'll call it "Mexican Chili".  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This soup is so good, I made it about 5 months ago just as the recipe stated except I used chicken broth in place of the beer.  It was awesome.  I just made it again yesterday but with altered ingredients as to what I had on hand, it was still great (I used 2 cans of chili beans (no black), and added an extra can of stewed tomatoes because I did not have any sauce, once again used chicken broth no beer, and didn't have any corn either).  I can't wait to get home and reheat it for dinner!

This is an excellent dish and has become one of our favorite.  My husband likes to use the Scoops tortilla chips and treats the soup more like a dip.  It is thick so it works this way too.

Scrumptious!! My kids loved it.  Not too spicy but very flavourful.  Used Tyson pre-cooked chicken strips which worked great.  Added them at the beginning and they were delicious after cooking all day.  Served the soup with all the trimmings (sour cream, cheese, tortilla chips) and also made Camp Cornbread from this site which went great with the soup.  Highly recommend this soup and will definitely make again.

Delicious recipe! Wow. I used Pacifico for the beer and the taste was perfect. And because of my work schedule I had to leave the chicken until I got home 9 hours later. So when I got home I shredded the chicken, stirred it up and served it. The chicken was tender and delicious!

Quite tasty, and I'll make it again, but it was more of a chili than a soup. It was very thick, perhaps because I've no slow cooker here so cooked it slowly on the stovetop. Next time I'd simply add more tomato sauce and probably some broth. Also, I wasn't sure what the writer meant by "chili beans". I assumed kidney beans -- is this what others used?

Yummy! I used diced leftover roast beef to make it Beef Taco Soup. It was very good with tortilla chips and cheddar on top. You could not taste the beer at all, but I'm sure it enhanced the flavor.

l love this soup tho I've used it as a starter for my own. Black beans, chili beans and kidney beans. No beer but chicken stock and crushed tomatoes and red pepper and chili powder. Always topped with cheese and sour cream. Crockpot filled to the brim!

So incredibly easy and soooo delicious.  Might as well make a double batch!  I didn't find it necessary to take the chicken out at the 5 hr mark, I did this step just before serving, while setting the table and making a salad.

WOW! This was great. A nice low fat alternative to chili. The only changes I made was to use water instead of beer and added some chili powder. I shredded the chicken which I think is better. Made it before work, came home and shredded the chicken and served it an hour later. This will be a family favorite! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a really easy recipe, but I didn't care much for the flavor the beer lended to the dish.  I will make it again, but sub chicken stock for the beer. Other than that, it was very tasty!

This recipe is fantastic! I do not have a slow cooker so I just put everything in a large heavy saucepan and once it came to a boil, turned it down to simmer and let it cook for a few hours. Everyone in my family loves it. It was more like stew than soup and very, very tasty.

What a great recipe!  I cooked mine on top of the stove, took the advice of a couple of other reviewers and used Bill Echols taco seasoning instead of the packaged kind and substituted chicken broth for beer.  This is my first review and I just had to rate this because it was great.  A keeper for sure!

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly except I used the taco seasoning recipe from this site, drained one of the cans of tomatoes (which were 14.5 ounces, not 10 ounces), and used Sierra Nevada for the beer. Using a homemade taco seasoning is nice because you can control the amount of salt going into the soup. Rinsing the black beans is immportant because most of the time they are packaged with salt to keep them fresh. My soup wasn't too salty or too spicy, as others have said. Instead of 5 hours on low, then shredding the chicken, I did three hours on high, shredded the chicken, turned it to low, and let it sit for another few hours. This recipe couldn't be easier.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe. I only used one can of diced tomatoes with chili's, and one can of regular diced.  Sub the beer with chicken broth, and I didn't have chili beans so used one can of ranch beans.  Served with corn bread.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was very simple and quite good.  My husband and I prefer our food super spicy, so I added an extra packet of taco seasoning and some cayenne pepper.  I also added some garlic salt for a little more flavor.  Next time I think I'll nix the beer (the flavor was a little overpowering) and only use one can of beans (it was pretty laden--much more chili than soup).  But I'll definitely make it again!

Excellent & easy. I used frozen corn & chicken broth instead of the beer. Since I would like to see more juice, I may try putting some diced tomatoes or more chicken broth in next time.

AWESOME!!!!! 
I doubled the recipe and made a few subtle changes. I used kidney beans because that's what I had. I used one can of beer and one can of chicken broth. I didn't have tomatoes with chilis so I used regular diced canned tomatoes and chopped a jalepeno that I had. I only used two large chicken breasts and I thought it was plenty.  This recipe was so good and such a good pot luck recipe. I will for sure be making this on football Sundays.

This soup is most delicious!  It is super easy to assemble, and who doesn't love slow cooker meals?  Be sure to top off your bowl with a little shredded cheese and sour cream.  Chips and salsa also go well with this very filling meal. Thanks for the recipe!

Goes together in no time and is delicious.  I used chicken thighs, low sodium taco seasoning, and low sodium chicken broth in place of beer.  Great recipe!

This is an excellent soup!  The only thing I changed was, I use diced tomatoes with onions and put in only one can of Green Chiles separately.  I found that some "Diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles) can have more heat than I like...but I have the office hooked on this one!

Garnish with a little sour cream, shredded cheddar and chips.  Very good.

Wow, very yummy and nutritious!  I used Tones Taco seasoning from Sam's Club.  I weighed it to get the number of ounces required for the recipe; next time I will use a little less because it was spicy for my taste.  I will make this again!

I used two cans of black beans & cooked this for almost 11 hours before shredding the meat- it was great.  Very tender meat!  My husband thought it still tasted too tomato-y, so next time I might put one can less tomatoes and one more can black beans.  I also used canned creamed corn (wanted to get rid of the can) & it had no noticeable effect.  Topped with shredded cheese & sour cream.  For how little effort it requires, it is a great recipe.

I cooked the chicken in a pressure cooker to save some time, then added it to the slow cooker for about an hour. Two cans of tomatoes and green chilis was too spicy for us, so next time I'll add one can of plain tomatoes and one can with chilis. Overall, everyone liked it!

This is good and filling.  I substituted chicken broth for the beer and kidney beans for the black beans due to personal preferences.  It's great to come home to this after a hard day at work.  I mainly love the fact that there is no pre-cooking the chicken breasts involved.

This recipe was a huge hit at our house! It is so different, delicious, and EASY! One thing to note - you'll need to know your slow cooker - mine was done in a total of 5 hours on low, and the tender chicken makes all the difference.

Yum!!! This was so easy to put together and tasted wonderful. I did use chicken stock instead of the beer as suggested and frozen corn, because I don't like canned, it was great. Thanks for a easy and tasty soup Patti.

This was so great for a cold day.  My guests gobbled it up and everyone said it was delicious.  I used chicken broth instead of beer and added a dry ranch mix to it.  Very yummy!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I made it for a birthday gathering and out of 5 soups/slow-cooker entrees, mine had the least left over!  I love it with sour cream and cheese, but like the adaptability for guests.  A definite keeper!

This soup is great. Made it twice in one week, my husband loved it that much.
I did cheat a little and used old el paso seasoned shredded chicken the second time I made it and also used kiddney beans. This is a keeper. Thank You.

Big hit at our house, especially with the kids!  I made a few substitutions- chicken broth instead of beer and used frozen corn because I didn't have canned.  I topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream, and then I tucked a few tortilla chips around the edges of each bowl of soup.  Very satisfying! Souper quick too!!

Didn't have any beer so I took the tip of another reviewer and used chicken broth and it was great!  It is definitely best with the chips, cheese and sour cream.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe--I make a similar recipe using ground beef and chicken is a nice change.  I added an envelope of ranch dressing mix and a can of green beans(drained and rinsed) and it was delicious. This is one of the easiest meals ever!!

FABULOUS!!!!  I also used the TACO SEASONING I recipe rather than the prepackaged stuff!  My BF loved it and has talked about it SEVERAL times since we had it.  I threw it together in the morning and we enjoyed it after a long cold day watching the Jets lose.. *laugh*!

I made this soup for my co-workers and all asked for the recipe.  One made it the next day for her family!  This soup is not only delicious but very easy.  I boiled the chicken that morning and then put it all together and it was ready by noon.  It was a bit spicy for me so I will try mild Rotel tomatoes next time.  I used 1/2 beer and 1/2 chicken broth. Excellent recipe!

This was a very good and hearty soup...more like a chili made with chicken. I didn't have the time to take out the chicken so I poached it ahead of time and then added it at the end. I didn't find that it tasted at all like beer....maybe  that's because I used a mexican beer (Corona). I made it about a week ago and my husband's already asking me to make it again.

Something healthy my kid finally loves. I do not care for canned foods or preservatives so I made my beans from dried using the instapot. Also 2 cups fresh tomateos= 1 can. I also added a chopped Jalapeno and green pepper.  I omitted the beer and used one cup chicken broth with one can cream of chicken soup.  If you love Mexican, you probably already have all the spices to make your own taco seasoning.

I made this soup for a Super Bowl party and it was a smash hit. Everyone gave it rave reviews and several asked me for the recipe. The beer I used was "Shock Top" and that gave it the soup a very light citrus pop that nicely balanced out all the flavors. I will be making this one again.

This is a keeper!  So easy and delicious!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews (and the fact I can rarely leave a recipe alone!). I used two cans of tomato sauce and decreased the water to 1 cup.  I added a bunch of minced garlic, cumin, oregano, and basil.  I served it with grated cheese and avocado on top and tortilla chips on the side.  Everyone loved it!  I made everything the night before and put the crock in the fridge.  Simply plugged it in before leaving for work.  Enjoy!

Loved by everyone in the family!  Did not have black beans so I used cannelloni beans.  Tasted great.  Next time will use black beans.

Made this and it was delicious!  I added in some garlic and cilantro to the mix.  This makes a lot of food so have a big crew to help you eat it.

We love this one . Great for a busy day. We make up chicken ahead of time and put it in the freezer to speed up the process. Also minus the beer didn’t feel it was a necessity.

Used this as my “go by” and modified as follows:  omitted chili beans, only used 1-can of Rotel tomatoes, added 1/2-small can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, added 2-cups of frozen fajita blend pepper and onions (out of the frozen food section), and 30-minutes prior to serving, added 8-oz of cream cheese.  Husband said this is delicious. ??

Super easy and delicious. I didn't add the corn and added a can of kidney beans. Also, I didn't cook as long. I did about 4 hours, cut up the chicken then another hour.

Fantastic base for a wonderful meal! I added cumin, oregano, curry powder, cayenne pepper, and a few other chili seasoning powders to it. I also added a half a stick of butter, as well as a full cup of shredded cheddar cheese??. I seasoned the chicken breast with another packet of taco seasoning also. It needs a lot of flavor added to it, but once you do, it turns into a fantastic meal. ?

I just cooked this over the stove instead of a slow cooker.  Simmered about 15-20 minutes.  My family loved it.  Definitely will make again.

I tried this recipe at my daughters house and absolutely loved it! I make it twice a month, it’s wonderful with corn bread, tortillas or cheese quesadilla on the side. It freezes well for another dinner in case you need something fast. It’s a warm and hearty meal on a cold rainy/snowy day!

While family loved it!  I wasn’t sure whether or not to drain beans, so I didn’t.  No beer on hand, so I just used water.  Not spicy, but had a great flavor and was just what we needed for a cold night.

I used chicken broth instead of beer, threw it all in the instant pot for 25 minutes and let it depressurize on its own and it was PERFECT! The thigh fillets shredded perfectly, didn’t need salt. Next time, I would only do 20 minutes or depressurize it sooner. We ate it with tortilla chips/flour tortillas, sour cream, shredded Mexican cheese, fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon. My 10 and 11-year old LOVED it!” This creates a lot of servings, too.

It was good - next time I’ll double the seasoning! I grew up eating my mom’s Middle Eastern food, so I’m used to more flavor than most recipes I find. If you are the same, more of the seasoning recipe provided by the author in the comments would make it even better.

I love this recipe but with a few adjustments, most notably, swapping out the beer and using 12 ounces of low sodium chicken broth instead. I also use 1/4 cup of taco seasoning instead of a standard packet as this recipe originally calls for. To make it less of a chili and more of a soup, reduce the chicken breasts from 3 to just 2, and make sure they are totally thawed and not frozen when you put them in. To make it even thinner, sometimes I just cook it without the chicken breasts and then add in some leftover chopped chicken from a roast chicken dinner (2 cups of chopped chicken), during the last half hour of cooking. Increase the chicken broth to 16 oz if going this route though. Enjoy!

Loved— So easy! Made it exactly as directed. Made some cornbread to go with it which was perfect. The cheese and sour cream on top are a crucial finishing touch. I might use thighs next time instead of breast’s. Def adding this to the rotation bc of how little prep is involved! Throw it in the slow cooker and bam! Dinner served.

This was quite a good recipe and was tasty, but I had serious problems because I used a beer (a blonde ale) that had a slight bitterness--the bitter/hoppy flavor was hard to get rid of. So, an important caveat: USE ONLY LAGERS AND OTHER VERY LOW BITTERNESS BEERS IN THIS RECIPE!

I love this soup! Very easy to make. Like another reviewer said using dark mexican beer is the way to go. I also like my soup a little more spicy so I added in a can of rotel the one with tomatoes and habaneros and I also choose spicy taco seasoning instead of regular taco seasoning and I added a half a pack of fajita seasoning.

Amazing meal for those having a busy life and need too have dinner ready for family after a long day.  Started it the night before and let it cook all day until dinner time. Just had the chicken shredded already from the night before.  Was a big hit for the family.

Made this on the stove top. Delicious. Sautéd to brown onion and garlic in a little veg oil first with some diced poblano, then added pre-cooked rotisserie chicken. Added Dos Equis amber ale to pick up the brown bits and let it boil for a minute. Only modification really was I added a cup of chicken broth to thin it a bit, and a few dashes of tobacco. Used mckormick taco seasoning packet. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used Goya Tomato Cooking Base for the tomato sauce and Dos XX for the beer. I also used the taco seasoning recommended by the submitter, Bill Echols Taco Seasoning, from this site. it was perfect! We topped it with sout cream and shredded cheddar cheese. My whole family went back for a second and third helping. My 10 yr old daughter keeps asking when we'll have it again. This is a wonderful, easy recipe and I highly recommend it!

Great recipe! I substituted some of the tomatoes with salsa for a little extra kick, and added some chicken stock to make it more of a soup consistency.

I really like this  recipe . I usually put water and bouillon cubes to make the soup thought. Just not a fan of beer and did try making the soup with beer, but really like it better with the water and chicken bouillon cubes.  My family likes it spicy so I so add some taco  sauce when I put everything together in the crock pot and cook it all day. After shredding the chicken breasts and adding back to the soup, I add shredded cheese and tortilla chips and serve! Yum!

We don't have beer and I forgot some at the store, so I used chicken broth. I followed the recipe as is for everything else and we loved it. I'll be making it again though next time I'll make it a bit spicier for my husband. Even my 7yo ate it up. We did the cheese and sour cream on top though. thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe and it was absolutely amazing! Even the kids gobbled it up! I had no left overs :-) we loved it just how it is including the sour cream, shredded cheese and chips. I added some chopped green onions to the top of mine. My only regret is not making more!

This recipe is a staple at my house! I think it’s perfect, but definitely stick with Modelo Negra Lager beer. When I have used others beers I don’t like it as much. It’s is the best match with this recipe!

No changes to the recipe. Love the flavor used dos xx beer. Thought My picky eaters would love it. But they don’t like much of anything. The rest of the family loved it.

This recipe was so easy yet so delicious.  Only made a few minor changes.  I used my Aroma rice cooker by the way.  I first sautéed the chopped onions in a tablespoon of minced garlic (about 5 min).  Then I added all the ingredients as listed.  I used one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and added 1/2 cup of salsa (I used the medium heat kind they sell in the glass jars).  Everything else was the same but at the end I added some heavy cream to make the soup creamy instead of the optional sour cream.  So delicious!

I saw this recipe years ago and have made it at least a dozen times now. It's fantastic for an extremely easy, very tasty meal to serve a group.  All my friends love it and think it was way more work than it is.  You can make it as spicy as you want by adding hot green chilies.  I have all the toppings out with the bowls and people just serve themselves. Great slow cooker party dish. 5 stars!!

Delicious!  Made exactly as written, but used frozen shredded chicken and added everything to stove pot and cooked that way instead of using slow cooker.  Was afraid there wouldn’t be enough liquid since you don’t add chicken broth, but there was plenty of liquid.  Very flavorful and it was easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!!

I was surprised how awful this was based on the ingredients and others reviews.  I used a premium Mexican beer. My children and husband "doctored it up" with queso and salsa.

It makes a lot.

Yummy! I used what I had-no beer, but chicken broth worked. When it was nearly done, I spiced it up for our tastes-cayenne and hot sauce to taste. Easy and tasty!

I had thee worst cold today when I made this soup.  No variations on the recipe at all.  Towards the end of the day I took the chicken out to shred and it dawned on me due to the cold I had absolutely NO sense of smell or taste!  I shredded up the chicken and tasted the soup and could not tell if I needed to add anything.  When my husband got home I asked him to taste it and let me know what I needed to add.  Two bowls later he said "Nothing, the soup has great flavor!"  So, I can't say it was great, but everyone else loved it.  Next time I make it I'll make sure I don't have a cold!

I have made this several times in a crock pot. This last time I made this recipe in a Dutch oven, in my pellet smoker. I also put a whole chicken with a chipotle rub on the chicken, then setting on a small cookie cooling rack on to top of the Dutch oven with the chicken setting on the rack. All the chicken drippings drops into the Dutch oven to add flavor. Turned out great with a smoke flavor 
Note: I use 32oz of chicken broth and not beer per the recipe

The only change I made to the recipe was to add diced jalapeños and some cayenne pepper, as I prefer more heat. I used a Gulden Draak Belgian Ale for the beer. Perfect for fall and winter and very easy.

My favorite meal on this app! I was hesitant at first because (I thought) I hated beans. I use it about once a month as it makes quite a bit of soup, great if your usually busy or into meal prep. If you like a little kick, I use the hot Rotel vs the original or mild.

I'm not a great cook and found this very easy to prepare and it tasted great. I don't like beer, so like a lot of others I used 12 oz of broth instead. Next time I make it, I might add more broth, because the first servings had enough liquid but the last 3 were all chicken, beans and corn. Otherwise, it was satisfying. I had a bunch to freeze for later.

It ended up being quite good. I made it exactly as the recipe said, but it tasted bitter to me. Must have been the beer. It didn't taste like beer, but there was nothing else in it that could have caused it. I countered by adding 3 packets of Splenda and some half and half. Then is was just right.

Tasted amazing, one thing I want to add in the directions...please include the part where you drain the beans and corn. My kid didn’t drain them. As good as it was, it was a little soupy. She didn’t watch the video until it was cooking because she wanted to surprise me.  Overall I will be having this dish again.

This was really delish!!  Made a couple changes though I had no beer so I used water.  When it was all said and done it still tasted a little bland to me so I tossed in a extra pack of seasoning (Fajita Seasoning).  That did the job!!!  The next day I reheated drained off the juices and used it to toss in soft shells.  It was DELISH!!  Will definitely make again

This soup was easy, I had all the ingredients on hand except the beer, so I used a can of chicken broth instead. I cooked the soup on the stovetop substituting 2 cans of Costco precooked chicken for the chicken breast called for in the recipe. I used about 3 T. of taco seasoning which made the finished soup mildly spicy. Topped each serving with a spoon of sour cream, grated cheddar cheese and diced green onion. Very tasty!

So easy and tasty.  I added a second packet of taco seasoning at the end to bump the flavor up.  I also used rotel fire roasted tomatoes and green chilis rather than the regular can.

I have made this so many times because it’s such a huge hit in my house and super easy to make. Also I’m not a beer drinker at all, you can’t taste it. The pickiest of eaters will devour this. I started adding the large jar of corn, and I’d add one more can of beans, whichever I had on hand. 10 mins before serving I’d dump about half a bag of shredded Mexican cheese in there with a cup of sour cream. Mix it in, then serve. Makes dishing up easier in my house!

Seasoned chicken with some of the taco seasoning giving it a quick fry in a cast iron pan with avocado oil and half of the chopped onions before adding it to remaining ingredients in the slow cooker. Don't care for the texture of the chicken simmered/boiled in broth from raw. Used chick broth instead of beer, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added in fresh jalapenos to the bowl when serving.

I didn’t add corn, but otherwise followed the directions. Very good!! Will probably make it again. I might add 1/2 a beer next time because it didn’t cook off as much as I thought it would.

Made it twice now. We love it so much and it's even better as leftovers! It's adaptable to personal taste like the author says. I do not use beer as we are not beer drinkers (find me a good wine and I'll throw it in) so I sub 14oz. can of low-sodium chicken broth. My other half does not do spicy, so everything is pretty mild (4 T taco seasoning, 1/2 t of cumin and 2 cans of Rotel the original recipe). I have used chili beans and have also sub for pinto beans as its what I had on hand. I also use sweet corn instead. I have used fresh garlic (2-3 med. size cloves) and also garlic powder (1 t) - we love garlic. Any version is delicious! It is great for leftovers or it would be great for potluck or entertaining (Superbowl perhaps?). Top it with cheese, sour cream, and avocado and you WILL NOT go wrong!! The tortilla chips are great but warning they end up soaking up liquid and become mushy. Great recipe, thank you!!! :)

Loved this!  Now I know people out there get mad with those of us who change things - I don't like the taste of beer so I substituted chicken broth.  I also didn't have a can of corn, but DID have a can of hominy.  I served this with the requisite sour cream, cheese and I deep fried some tortillas into strips.  This was a keeper and I will DEFINITELY do it again (with my changes).

I love this soup, been making it since 2006.  I use Bud Light because it is very light flavored and that's how I like it.  I do think it gives it a good flavor but not the bitterness from a heavy beer.

Great easy family loved recipe! Can use boullion cubes in place of beer and dried onion instead of chopped. Make ahead 2 recipes and freeze 1/2 for later. Warm up in crock pot the day you want to use it.

This was delicious!
I didnt have beer, so I used extra tomato sauce (it was regular pasta sauce with basil and oregano) 
Used a prepackaged low sodium taco seasoning and added 1tbsp chilli powder and 1/4tsp garlic powder
My chicken breasts hadnt fully thawedbefore I started assembling this, so I cooked it on high for 5 hours, took out the breasts to shred at 3.5 hours (partly to ensure they would be fully cooked in the end)

I hate to rate with modifications, but I didn't have everything for the recipe. We HAD beer, but it was mango beer?? Didn't think that would work.  No tomato sauce, so I used enchilada sauce. I used chicken broth in place of the beer.  Other than that, everything else I had.  We really liked this, and it was better the next day!  I topped with cheese, sour cream and fried jalapenos.

I couldn’t believe that I had everything for this on hand and at the end of the month with not much for food in the pantry I had tomato paste because I didn’t have sauce and one can of tomato and Chile’s and one can of just tomatoes because of the kids. My picky son absolutely loved it! We served it with slices of fresh lime, 505 brand hint of hatch tortilla chips, sour cream and cheddar cheese. I also added a bit of a chili packet because it tasted kind of bland.

This was excellent! Only change I made was I left out the tomato chunks and just used a can of green chili’s since we don’t like tomato chunks. Definitely will make again!!

I'd definitely make this again. A great slow cooker recipe. I substituted lo-salt chicken broth for the beer and added extra broth. I think I'd add more taco seasoning next time as the extra chicken broth kind of washed out the flavor.

Left out the beer cuz I'd rather drink it than eat it, and used only a half can each of the beans. This soup is DELICIOUS. I'd make it once a week if my husband could stand it.

Our family and friends love this soup/chili!  Thank you!  
My only changes, I use mild chunk green chili and less chicken then the recipe calls for.  I use no sodium chicken broth and the beer.   Super easy!  This recipe can be made either mild or spicy, according to your own personal taste.

Very tasty! I used the taco seasoning recommended by the submitter and chicken broth instead of beer. Next time I might try using my Instant Pot to cook for the first stretch of time, then finish on slow cook mode, since the chicken wasn't as easy to shred as I expected after just 5 hours.

This turned out great. I used hot Rotel for some spice, and threw in a few table spoons of sugar at the end that gave it a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor!

I didn't have chill beans and substituted with Pinto beans. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Put on soup mode (medium) in the instant pot for 20 minutes. Worked perfectly!

First off, prepare to get some major gas from this recipe. I made this exactly to the instructions and it was very  tasty and not all that spicy either. Leftovers tasted even better.Next time I might put a few jalapeños in it. 
I'm seeing come complaints on here about the beer which amazes me because it really does add to the recipe and gives it some body.

This was a really tasty soup and SO EASY to make.  I agree, keep the beer in the recipe, and the darker the beer the better.  You could make substitutions and additions if you like, but this recipe can stand alone as is and won’t disappoint.

I've made this twice. Once with the beer (per the recipe) and once with two cups of chicken stock in place of the beer. Both were very good. My family enjoyed it more with the chicken stock instead. This is a simple, easy, DELICIOUS, satisfying, and healthy meal.  My kids who are picky eaters asked for seconds!  Notes: (1) I used the taco seasoning the author recommends. Perfect seasoning. (2) I used one can of Rotel (for the tomatoes w/ green chilies) and one can of regular diced tomatoes (13 oz).  (3) Also, frozen corn instead of canned. Just my personal preferences. We will make this over and over again. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

Recipe was super easy & turned out great!  I was able to use 2 forks to tear the chicken breasts apart rather than remove them and cut them up. It has spiciness to it from the Ro-tel and from the taco seasoning. I don’t recommend adding more heat unless you like food very spicy and your kids can handle that. If your kids can not handle any spiciness then use mild ro-tel.

I was a little hesitant about this recipe! But boy was I surprised. Definitely agree with another reviewer use the right beer. I used Modelo and it was fantastic. I also did not use the taco packets as listed I used the recipe for the taco mix the original poster posted as an addendum! This was a definite hit with the family! Will be making it again for sure!

I chose low sodium options where I could to lower the sodium content. This was SO good and highly recommend adding chips on top when you are eating it for a little crunch.

I totally enjoyed this. my husband and daughter didn't like it one bit. they are very picky. if you have picky eaters you might want to see if its something they will eat first before you make it. my daughters friends were over and devoured it! I added my own touch but cutting tortillas into thin strips, spraying with pam, shook some taco seasoning on them and baked. great alternative for this soup than just crackers

This turned out really good. My original goal was to cut it in half.  Glad I didn't. I chopped up 1/2 of a red and 1/2 a white onion that was in the fridge that needed using up, but that was more like a cup than half. Then I bought Ranch Style Beans vs Chili Beans oops..one can tomato with green chilies and added one can of green chilies. Frozen corn, because I don't care for canned.  I used the 8oz of tomato sauce because I bought the wrong beans and used about 6 oz Shiner Black beer. I had taco seasoning from the bulk Healthy Living section of my store, and probably used 3T maybe more. I didn't add chicken because I was cooking for myself and planned on adding leftover shredded chicken from enchladas for the BF's serving. After reading reviews on the thickness, or suggestions that you could use it as a dip, I wanted soup. So I added a carton of vegetable broth and a little extra water as well as cumin. Put the cooker on low and headed to work. Later that night I added the drained black beans and  set it on high while I made a sweet cornbread.  Just a small amount of heat and topped it with fresh cilantro, green onions, sour cream and white cheese.  Will do again!!

I'm a full on mom, with no time to write reviews, but today I have time thanks to this dish!!  All the ingredients are simple and ones that I usually have on hand. It is absolutely amazing. Easy and simple and my little kiddos said, "Please make this again!"     I did heaping scoops of all the spices (accept for the spicy chilli flakes and chilli powder) and I didn't do beer (didn't have any in the house), just a cube of chicken stock.  Thank you!

Easy, easy meal that tastes great.  I used kidney and pinto beans instead and used a Mexican beer and it was a really good soup, I loved it and so did the family.

This is a great recipe. It will vary to your tastes depending on what taco seasoning you use. We use Old El Paso hot and spicy taco seasoning and love it. We throw in some of our own favorite seasoning and top it off with Santa Fe style tortilla strips. :)

Delicious soup, I think the beer really made a huge difference. I've made soups like this before, but they have never had such great flavor. It was thick and so yummy!  I didn't add the veggies in the beginning.  An hour before the soup was done I added a can of Del Monte Vegetable & Bean Blend Mexican Style.  That way the beans wouldn't get too mushy. We loved it and it will now be our new go to Tortilla Soup!  Thank you Patti!

Very yummy, would make it again. I made my own taco seasoning instead of buying anything prepackaged and it was a great way to go! Also, instead of using sour cream I used a little plain Greek yogurt instead. Yum!

So good! I like using the pre-seasoned canned black beans without draining them. I tested it out using a tortilla chip - 10 minutes later and I was still “testing” it. Sooooo good!!!

I made this recipe just as written but did not add the 8 oz can of tomato sauce cuz I didn't have it. I did use Mexicali corn.  My diced tomatoes with green chilies were  larger  cans(I pureed them since the boys don't like chunks of tomatoes). So with the 12 oz beer & 28 oz of tomatoes my slow cooker was full.  I started it after lunch -probably around 1:30 & the chicken was half frozen so cooked it  on high until 5 pm.  Shredded the chicken, putting it into the soup made it so 
thick with chicken and yummy.  We did not add sour cream or cheese.  I used plain tortilla to scoop up some of this delicious soup.  I'll make this again!

My wife love this soup.  I added garlic powder and cumin per one reviewers  suggestion.  Next time I will use a food processor for the Ro-Tel tomatoes with chilies because I I don't like chunks of tomato. It's the flavor that matters.  I may also add a touch of cayenne.  I will make it again.

Great Recipe and easy to make.  Cooked on low overnight . The  chicken was so tender and easy to shred.  Only used 2 breasts due to store packaging.  Will be making this again.

I have been making this for over 10 years and it is one of my favorite chicken recipes, slow cooker recipes, chili recipes... it’s just all- around good! You can add another can of beans(try different types) or two to extend this chili and it’s good every time. It’s also so incredibly easy! The hardest thing is cutting up the onion!

I love this soup! Easy and inexpensive to make, especially for larger gatherings. I like how it can be served either on it's own or as a dip. I like to set out fresh cilantro, green onions, Scoops Dips, avocado slices, shredded cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream.

So easy and so good! I made it with Old ElPaso taco seasoning and it was very good, a little spicy especially if you don't add sour cream.  If you are making for kids you might want to use mild Rotel. Definately will be making again!

It was pretty good.  A little bitter so I added lime juice which helped. Definitely the cheese and sour cream enhanced it!

Yummy,  yummy.  I made with ??, bud light 15oz,  and everything the recipe called for.  I did add bellpepper and garlic,  cause I like veggies.  Came out super great.  I hate soup and I couldn't get enough.  Stuffed does not begin to explain. ????

This soup is delicious, I made a few substitutions and we loved it...instead of adding beer, I drank it and used chicken broth, I also added 1 can of Mexican Recipe Stewed Tomatoes and substituted the Chili Beans with a can of Chili...we also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream...I will be making this again very soon.

This is my new favorite recipe.  I use the Taco Seasoning 1 recipe from this site too (which I make in bulk to always have on hand).  I've tried mixing in some home made salsa and adding a little more spice, but in general, it is perfect as written.   As others have noted, I used a dark beer (black IPA).  I love that I can keep almost all the ingredients on hand for use anytime and it is even better left over for lunch the next day.  My kids, who normally don't like beans, will also eat this without a complaint.  I've shared this with multiple people and they all love it!

Our whole family loved this with just a couple of tweaks. It's been my experience with chicken that when cooked in a CP all day, it tastes Funny. Like it has a weird texture so instead we seasoned the breast with garlic/onion powder, diced in bite size pieces and whitened in olive oil with fresh garlic. And put the pieces in the CP. WOW that made ALL the difference in how the chicken came out. 
I didn't have chili beans so I used kidney beans dusted with chili powder. As for the beer, (HighLife)this time I used it since I was out of chicken broth and said nothing while I watched everyone gobble it up then told them. "WHAT? THERE'S BEER IN THIS?!? We wouldn't have known if you didn't say anything." Served with crumbled tortilla chips and cheese.

I have been making this recipe as is and with a few changes at times for several years. Beer is a key ingredient to this recipe, don't leave it out, you just have to get the right beer and the right beer is a Mexican beer. I perfer Dos Equis. I like this with chicken or beef. I like to add the canned mexicorn sometimes too. As written however the recipe is still top notch. Everyone who eats it no matter how I make it, absolutely loves it!! Thanks for the share!!

Everyone I have ever made this for LOVES this soup! I love that it’s sooooo easy to prepare. Only changes I make it to use a can of chicken broth instead of the beer, add a clove of crushed garlic, pink beans instead of chili beans, and when it’s all done cooking I put some chopped fresh cilantro and mix it into the whole soup. I serve it with some sour cream and tortilla chips. So delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Everyone loved it. I used chicken broth in place of the beer and doubled the tomato sauce. I normally try and follow the recipes to a T, but this time I used what I had on hand. It turned out great.

I love this recipe as and have made it at least 10 times. BUT it is important to note that the size of the chicken breasts matter. Our chicken breasts at my store are HUGE weighing 2 lbs each and If I used 3- and I have- there is too much chicken and the flavor is watered down. I try to use the smallest breasts I can find.

It was tasty, be careful with the beer. Too much leaves a funky after aroma/taste that some didn't care for.

I'd give this about 3.5 stars. I followed the recipe as written but used the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe instead of a store bought packet. Perhaps that's why I found this too spicy? I'm not sure. I was very glad to have the sour cream and cheese to cut some of the heat. It tasted good, but I think there could have been more beans. They were pretty sparse. I'd definitely add another can of black beans. My family ate and enjoyed this, but the leftovers didn't move too fast out of the fridge.  I loved how easy it was to make though.

Love this recipe. All three of my boys are happy when I make this. I usually use a Corona for the beer. Nice light flavor. A neat cooking hack I’ve learned because my shredded chicken always looks awful, put your chicken in a bowl and shred it with your electric beater. Sounds crazy but it shreds it perfectly. Just be sure and use a large bowl because it can be messy!

One of my favorite recipes on this site! I've made this many times and my boyfriend loves it as well! I follow the recipe with a few adjustments. I double the amount of corn. I also recommend Trader Joe's taco mix and a small can of green chilies for a little extra spice. Like other reviews, I recommend the beer be a dark Mexican beer. I cook on low for 6 hours and shred the chicken and cook for 1 more hour on low. I serve soup with corn chips and toppings like shredded cheese, avocado, green onions, sour cream, cilantro, and lime juice.  It is more like a chili than soup, but maybe because I add extra goodies! I'm making this again for dinner tonight!  Yum! :)

We ate this for lunch 3 days in a row (and that's unusual for us).  Just a great recipe!  Only change I made was using chicken broth instead of beer.  For toppings we used sour cream, cheddar cheese, chopped cilantro and regular Fritos.  I used RaisinKane aka Patti's recipe for homemade taco seasoning instead of using a store bought packet.  All around great recipe!

I liked the overall flavor, but my family (4 adult kids and husband) all thought it was too salty. I think I'd omit the chili beans and replace with more black beans and use reduced sodium taco seasoning.

I made this with a hoppy IPA, red pepper flakes and garlic. Very good.  I shredded the chicken with a mixer, saved time.  My family all liked it with exception to my mild mouth 9 year old. Sigh... Her loss.

This was delicious and so easy to put together. I was worried that it would be too spicy with the two cans of tomatoes with green chilies, but the spice level was just right. And it seems fairly healthy as well. Thank you for a great soup.

This is the best soup. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not add beer, but instead a 32oz carton of chicken stock, because I  like a soupier soup.  It is fantastic.

I guess we just have big chickens here, 3 breasts were enough to turn it into more of a stew than a soup. It had great flavor and was easy to make.

A go-to meal whenever I know it will be a hectic evening. I use chicken broth instead of the beer, just due to my preference.

My rule is to make the recipe per the instructions and then make changes next go around if needed.  That is what I did in this case but, well, this recipe lacks any and all spices.  If I were to make it again, it would REQUIRE adjustments to spice this up.

This is prob the best chicken tortilla soup I've made yet! The chicken was super tender & the soup flavorful. What was even better for me, after researching, I used this recipe & made it in my instant pot for 20MINUTES! Yes, 20 instead of the 6-7 hrs (which you would, of course, have to do in a slow cooker).  So those w/an instant pot it's 20mins for a g8 soup vs the 7hrs. Love this! Many thanks, Jen :)

Made it for a large group of friends!  It was excellent!  Followed the recipe  and made the Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning - and LOVE it!! Instead of crushed tortilla chips, I used tortilla strips - like what you serve on a salad!  Since they were multi-colored,  it looked so festive!  Definitely a keeper recipe!  Served with corn bread and a salad -- and margaritas!

This recipe was pretty good, definitely more of a chilli than a soup. I felt that it needed more flavor to it, and the sour cream and cheese made it taste a ton better.!

I made this for my daughter's high school. Our booster club was hosting a staff appreciation for Education Week and the school staff loved it. My soup was the first to go. My daughter stated that one of the staff members was asking for the recipe, so I hope you don't mind if I share. 

I'm going to have to make this again for my family as there was no leftovers when I picked up my crock-pot. LOL!!

So good, Patti! Thank you for posting this. I had frozen chicken so I put breasts in first with my homemade taco seasoning and some salsa when those were close to done I added your ingredients. Full disclosure, I did not add beer or corn due to personal preference also I used Rotel for the tomatoes. This is a keeper!

This was so easy to make since it all just dumps into the crockpot!  I decided for this time to use beer, and we had Dos Equis on hand.  It is still very good, but could see how it could add a unique taste that some people don't care for.  I'm meal prepping before baby arrives, and got 8 portions that fit into freezer quart bags for later (the 3 chicken breasts were large). Looking forward to easy future meals!

This was so good!  I started off making it in crock pot but my crock pot decided to die on me after an hour, so I finished it on the stovetop.  I also added a packet of ranch dressing mix. YUMMY!

This was very good. Since I have celiac disease, I didn’t add the beer, and added chicken broth in its place. I also added some cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

I love this recipe!  It's 5 stars as is, but I also have made the following changes:  Sometimes I used hamburger or turkey sausage or a mix of the two (already browned) and mix in some refried beans too.  I add a whole 15 oz can of tomato sauce and a whole 15 oz can of corn.  Using a Guiness beer is awesome!

Easy-peasy in Instant Pot. Built recipe as instructed except I only used 3 breasts. It was more than enough. I used the pressure cooker method. IP took about 35 min to preheat, then only 15 min to cook. Chicken shredded with ease. Great recipe and easy to modify based on preference.

I thought this was great ?? and so did my family, who by the way are very picky.  I did use chicken broth instead of the beer because I read some of the reviews that it may have given it a funny taste.  Other than that I followed the recipe, had a great taste just the way it is. Thank you

LOVED this recipe! Followed it except for I replaced the beer with chicken stock as someone recommended.  OMG good! Will definitely make again and make corn bread to accompany. Maybe a cold beer to drink with the soup would be the best.

This recipe is excellent, everyone love it. I did take the adive of many and made my own taco seasoning. I also added hot sauce to my bowl when I ate it for some extra kick! Delish!

I added more of the spices and some hot chilis.  My family likes their food hot and spicy.  Other then that it was great.  Very easy just adding all the ingredients in at once.  Chicken very tender.  I will definitely make this dish again.

I substituted chicken broth for the beer (16 oz).  I also let it cook for 8.5 hr on low before shredding chicken (not home).  Then I garnished with chopped avocado and sour cream.  Even picky people loved it.  It doesn’t seem spicy at first, but as you keep eating it, the heat turns up.

I will make it again because it’s a solid recipe, but there’s was just a little too much chicken. When I make it, I’m just going to put less protein.

This is delicious.  I love it....I added asparagus and fresh green beans.  I used chicken leg and thighs and made the recipe on the stovetop.  I made the taco seasoning as well as indicated by Patty!! I used fresh tomatoes and chipotle in adobo sauce and an Anaheim roasted (skinless) Chile.  Fresh corn and homemade black beans.   I am so glad  Patty shared this deliciously delicious recipe.

Great!  Good on first day, good on second day, and still good a few months later (after being frozen).   Had just enough "zing" to appeal to spicy-loving adults without being "too much" for kids.
This recipe  makes a lot.

This is my "go to" taco soup recipe.  Love that I can basically dump all the ingredients in the crock pot early in the morning, including frozen chicken breasts, and it is ready when I get home from work.  The soup on its own without cheese, sour cream and chips is hearty, healthy and low fat.   The chips, sour cream and cheddar cheese  are excellent toppers however the soup does stand along without them if you are looking to cut calories.  It comes out perfect every time!

It’s was pretty good. Changes I incorporated: I seasoned boneless chicken thighs with Cuban and Mexican seasoning rub, I seared the chicken in peanut oil to lock in flavor, added green onions and fresh cilantro to soup, switched the tomatoes with green chilies for fresh pico de gallo with chopped jalapeños, left out the crushed red pepper due to jalepenos inside of pico mix, and I kept the bones in the soup after shredding the cooked chicken for additional flavor.

This recipe is a staple in our house from Fall to Spring. Always use Bill Echol’s seasoning recipe! Truly makes a huge difference. Throw in can of corn, lots of diced green chiles, cilantro & anything else that strikes my fancy. Never make without the beer and the longer it cooks or sits overnight, the better it gets.

Great recipe and everyone loved it. I added more chicken because I had it and I like a meaty chili.

Loved this!!! Even my finicky 16 year old daughter came back for seconds! I will definitely make this again! I also substituted the beer for chicken broth. I will try it with the dark mexican beer one day though.

Ok I’m giving it 5 stars but to be honest I didn’t use the recipe as a whole since I didn’t have some ingredients but i used a majority of it. I didn’t have taco seasoning so I used a combo of cumin, coriander, chili powder, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper and it tasted great. I added chopped avocado, sour cream, lime and cilantro on top and it was light and flavorful and filling!

I made this as written except for one substitution.  I used chicken broth in place of the beer to make it gluten free, due to Celiac issues.  It was delicious and will definitely be one that I make again, it was so easy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is amazing, except the first time I made it , it wasn't flavorful enough so I added more taco seasoning than it suggests, extra chili powder and some chili pepper flakes.   Seriously, DELICIOUS!

I made this and it was AWESOME! I forgot to buy the cilantro, but not a big fan of it anyway. Abig bowl with crushed tortilla chips and grated cheese on the bottom, ladle in the soup then top with sour cream and maybe a spoon of salsa. YUMMM!!!  This was souper-easy ?? to make and inexpensive! I picked up everything I need to make 2 more batches and I have the canned goods stored together in my pantry, ready to go!

So I made this but substituted taco seasoning for chili seasoning (3 packs). I didn’t use beer, and used kidney beans and chili beans instead of black beans. 4 huge boneless Chicken breast, mushrooms, green onions and red/green peppers. When I tell you it’s AMAZING!!!

I have a young son who has a young-son taste buds; I therefore skipped the beer and substituted chicken broth.  He doesn't like beans so he picked most of them out. But, he did seem to enjoy it otherwise.  This is the closest that I've been able to get him to try something other than kid food (chicken strips, fries, pizza, etc) so I am very pleased and will keep experimenting with it.  As for myself, I thought it was very good and will make great leftovers for the week ahead.

I've made this twice now for my large family, 5 children (one is still a baby though) and this lasts us 2 meals with some for lunches, very rare in this house.  I've made it according to the recipe except we use a full 3 pound bag of chicken breasts and we serve it over rice and use the tortilla chips to scoop everything up with.  The kids absolutely love it along with my husband and I.

I had no beer here unfortunately so used up vegetable broth I needed to get home instead as well as added several cut up mini peppers I needed to use up. Rinse your beans. It’s important. Made mexican cornbread and Spanish rice on the side for a complete meal we will eat on for a couple of days. Started it at 7 am and after simmering all day my honey finally ate at 11:30 pm...4 big bowls. Winner in my book. Fantastic. Will make again sometime.

Would not make it again......I agree with a previous poster, the taste is a little off, almost chemical or artificial tasting.  Haven't served it up yet, had to thicken it with cornstarch......I have many White Chicken Chili and Chili Bean Soups that I prefer........

Yes, I made this with beef sirloin chunks, I added green peppers,garlic,salsa,and chicken broth sometimes I use beef broth. It just depends on what I have at home. I have even added cooked rice to this in the winter time. The chicken can become to stringy. I do not add my chicken breast to early.  I have been known to not add any meat at all. This is very fulfilling.  Great after football games

This recipe is fantastic, I’ve already had requests from my husband for another batch. I used the actual seasonings instead of prepackaged taco ones and chose non alcoholic beer to lessen the “beer” flavor. It was delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have canned corn or beer, so I used red pepper and chicken stock. I also substituted the taco seasoning for 2 tsp. Ground Cumin, 1 tsp. Paprika, and 1 tsp. Garlic powder.

This is a very filling and satisfying dish - packed with goodness. Will be adding it to my list of favorites!

Good base recipe. I did this stovetop on low for a good while. I added more tomatoes, hot sauce, crushed chili peppers, cumin, seasoning salt, and a little bit of lemon (to increase acidity without adding even more heat). I used ground beef instead of whole breasts. All told this filled 5 16 oz containers and an 8 oz container. Good for a week of dinners under 10 dollars.

I made this for the wife and kids. Granted, I had a couple (ok, a few) glasses of red wine beforehand (which always makes food takes better), but it was as advertised. Everyone liked it. I substituted the beer for chicken broth.

Great recipe. I used chicken broth instead of beer, but I didn't need the full amount because I like it thicker. I also didn't have much time, so cooked on high for four hours and then the chicken shredded nicely. I cooked it for another hour on low, but that probably isn't necessary. I used the taco seasoning recipe from the author's comment, but used healing amounts of each ingredient. Honestly could probably just double or completely. It wasn't spicy. And I also used a whole package of ranch dressing seasoning. Next time I will double this recipe because it barely lasted us four days! Served with chips (note self- buy the big bag) and bread (from a seasoned loaf). It was great!

This has become a family favorite! The 2 necessities are the taco seasoning recipe & using a Porter beer. My family doesn’t care for beans so I just use an extra can of corn.  The porter beer gives it a great flavor!

Made this with the beer. May try without it next time. I just couldn't tell what it did for the super. I froze half of the batch for a later time. Defrosted and brought to lunch. Very yummy and healthy soup!

This has high ratings for a reason! This is light enough for summer and hearty enough for winter. Full flavor and feel free to customize because it is fool proof. Next time I will try to turn up the heat a bit. Definitely will make again.

This is a really hearty soup. I followed the recipe except I couldn’t find chili beans so I just used a 19 oz can of black beans. It was actually beany enough for us. I also use a homemade taco seasoning mix from this site instead of buying packaged. Good soup/stew.

We all really liked this. I was slightly skeptical as my hubs and I don't typically cook with a bunch of canned goods ( he even commented on the dog foody smell of the canned beans lol), but I have had it in my recipe box for a while and it was featured in AR magazine so I figured it had to be pretty decent. I used Taco Seasoning 1 from this site ( I always have a batch made up)  and I didn't really measure it, just threw it in. I did add some dried Cilantro and Mexican Oregano. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. We topped it with Avocado, Cilantro, Cheese and Red Onion.  We will be making this again for sure!

Easy and delicious!  Just as good if you use rotisserie chicken.  Instead of canned corn, using frozen corn gave the corn a fresher taste.  You can also substitute the Taco seasoning with equal parts of Chili Powder, Cumin, a Tbs of salt, and a fresh clove of garlic.

I wasn't sure what kind of "chili beans" to use, so opted for plain pinto beans, drained and rinsed.  To compensate for possible lack of spice, I added about a third of a 4.5 ounce can of green chilies (put the rest on the table for addition to the soup to suit individual tastes).  I also substituted a package of frozen Green Giant roasted corn for canned corn - better flavor, color, crunch.  Whole family really liked the soup so this recipe is a keeper.

It's unanimous - the family loves this soup even more than the Chicken Taco Soup I used to make!  I probably would not have tried it except that the April/May issue of Allrecipes magazine featured it using reduced-sodium products.  Since we try to watch our sodium intake on a daily basis, we thought we'd give it a shot. The only change I made was to substitute reduced-sodium chicken broth for the beer.  We thought the blend of ingredients made an exceptionally tasty soup - thank you so much!  We really love soup and will be enjoying this recipe often!

This is a super simple recipe since it uses all canned ingredients. I wasn’t particularly impressed though. I found it VERY salty. In fact, I’m not even going to eat it. My husband will. He eats just about anything. I’m sorry, but I will not being making this again.

I made as-is and it wasn't the flavour I was expecting. I didn't want to eat any more, so I brought it into work to share it. Even though my co-workers are a bunch of guys who love beer and tacos, they did not care for this soup either. I would not make it again.

Delicious! I used Old El Paso Taco Seasoning 2 packs, 2 cans of corn one was Fiesta Corn with red and green peppers. Turned out excellent, not too spicy! I used Heineken beer also.

This is a family favorite and a hit with everyone I have served it to. Everyone asked for the recipe. 
I always make Bill Echols taco seasoning as recommended by RaisinKane below. . I also use Glen Muir fire roasted diced tomatoes.

Very tasty! I prefer to use chicken broth instead of beer - healthier and I always have broth on hand.  Delicious soup! I've made it for a potluck as well and it was devoured with rave reviews! I use a chipotle taco seasoning from Costco that is AMAZING! So easy and really good!

I have made this recipe as stated. It was good. The second time around I tweaked it to my palate. I doubled the recipe. I added approx. 1/4 cup of hot sauce, a couple tablespoons of chili powder, and a dash of cumin. At the end of the recipe I added two jalapeno peppers seeded and chopped and a couple tablespoons of fresh chopped  cilantro. I added the peppers towards the end because I like them crunchy.

I really liked this soup. I accidentally used way too much chicken, but for me there's really no such thing as too much chicken, so all is well. It just turned out more like a chili than a soup, but still had great flavors and was very filling. I added a bit more spice to kick up the heat just a tad, and only used black beans because I'm not a huge bean fan.

I used to LOVE this recipe, but then I became a Vegetarian.
I decided to adapt the recipe for my Vegetarian diet. I followed the recipe but removed the Chicken and replaced everything else with Organic Veggies. 
I added a diced Yellow or Orange Pepper and I added a can of sliced Black Olives, drained.
I thought it was as delicious as before, actually better and no meat was needed.
I'm not a Vegan, so I did use Organic Mexican Style Blend Cheese.

Loved this.  Used chicken broth instead of beer.  I didn’t have the cans of tomatoes with chilies so I used a large can of tomatoes and a small can of green chilies .  Figured it amounted to the same thing.  Everything else the same.  Made a nice large crock pot full.  Was super easy for someone who is not much of a cook.  Shared it with my friends.  Just a lovely recipe.  All my cans of food were NO SALT.  And I used taco seasoning that was 30 % less salt and the taste was delicious.  I think if I had used regular cans the salt taste would have been overwhelming.  This was much healthier and perfect taste.

This soup is excellent.  I have made it tons of times and people always beg me to make more.  The only thing is I cut the chicken portion in half because I felt it was a bit much (and Im a meat lover) but 1 and a half chicken breasts (if you get the good ones) is perfectly fine

I made it exactly as the recipe states and I wasn't a fan. It had a really strong beer flavor and not enough liquid. I ended up adding chicken broth, and then it was okay, but not the best.

This is "roll your eyes back in your head" good!  I LOVE that it's a "dump" soup.  I used chicken broth, lower salt taco seasoning, added a whole 15 ounce can of tomato sauce, and green chilies.  My NEW Taco Tuesday family meal!

This was a very easy recipe.  Dial the heat up and down as you would like.  It's a great hearty soup. Adding the chips, cheese and sour cream are great as well.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves their tacos!  :D

Fantastic! Made this for dinner the night before last and it’s a new family fave! You must, must, must use the enclosed taco seasoning recipie , it makes all the difference.  Makes enough to feed a small army, but, mo worries, leftovers freeze beautifully. So, so good?

We prefer black beans to "chili" beans so we double the black beans and omit the chili beans. Also prefer lower carbs so omit the corn.  This recipe is one of our favorites. Have made it more times than I can count. Definite family favorite!

I've tried a lot of soups for my family with teenagers, some very time-consuming. This one is both easy and fabulous - everyone liked it a lot, and shared some with family who asked for the recipe. Will be adding this to our regular meal rotation.

Substituted chicken broth for beer since we don't keep it in the house. Worked fine. Used Rotel brand for the diced tomatoes with chilies.

Outstanding! I added 1 tablespoon of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to the soup and it put just enough bite in it to make it Tex-Mex. I also served it with jalapeño corn muffins instead of chips. It was all gone in 15 minutes

I really wanted to love this but it just wasn't what I thought it would be.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The beer added a funky, yeasty flavor that nobody liked.  I plan to make it again without the beer to give it a second chance.

This soup was perfect for my boyfriend and I. I think I would add a small jalapeno to the soup, for a bit more kick next time. The flavors, however were absolutely wonderful! Will SO make this again!

Absolutely yummy!!  Based on taco seasoning instructions I used 2packets chicken taco seasoning. It was way too spicy so I added 8 oz chicken broth still turned out great.

Delicious!! Easy, fast, inexpensive. Great on a cold winters day. The only change I made was to add 1 and 1/2 packs of taco seasoning mix and a little extra salt, but not much.

I think the beer ruined mine. Before reading the reviews, I grabbed a Bud light from the fridge (Dilly Dilly) and it gave it a weird taste. I read somewhere to add a root vegetable to help draw out the taste of the beer so trying that. Last time I used chicken broth. Much better!

Used garbanzo instead of corn.  Regular diced canned tomatoes and added jalapeño.  Also used cubed chicken instead of whole breasts to shreds later. All ingredients in at one and that was it!  Used tomato paste with a little water instead of tomato sauce.  Love this dish and will definitely make again.

This soup overall had good flavor.  I didn't have beer so I replaced it with chicken broth.  The only other thing I would do differently is to sauté the onions with a little oil or butter first.  The onion flavor was overpowering and a little saute would have made a world of difference.

Great recipe. I added fresh cilantro, chives and parsley. I also put in dried beans instead of canned and they did fine (1/2 cup of each). I left out the beer and added some extra water for the beans. Hubby and I really enjoyed this and had lots left overs for weekday lunches. Next time I would like to try it with either canned or dried posole (hominy) too. It would be great with a side of cornbread.

I love making this soup!! The only thing I change is instead of the beer I used chicken broth and I season my chicken with some Cajun season and pepper and salt. Other than that I don't change nothing at all! One of my favorite soups!

Very good. Tastes like chili. I substituted the beer for a 10 oz cream of chicken soup and about 12 oz chicken broth. Used just black beans (not chili beans). After 7 hours it was delicious.

While I'm not a fussy eater, I made this yesterday, following the directions carefully.  When the time came to eat it, I scooped up my bowl & just didn't care for it.  The soup had a very strong taste  & I believe it was the beer.  After reading a couple reviews of other ppl that didn't care for beer (me either), I was anxious to try this recipe anyway.  It made a ton & I plan on sharing some with a friend hoping she'll enjoy it.  I will not be making it again.

This recipe is great as is, but my husband likes a kick . So i make a few modifications. He loves this soup so much that he requests it all the time and I always make it for his birthday. 
I add 1 sliced jalapeño and 1/2 jar of Frontera Habenero Salsa.  I use frozen corn instead of canned. I use one can of black beans and leave the chili beans out. I use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because they have a  little more fat and flavor.

Made it just as the recipe states.  It was very good and easy to make since you do not have to precook the chicken.  We like spicy foods, so next time will try some jalapenos and cilantro.

super easy to make. it was a hit! a couple things to note: i did add garlic powder and cumin to spice it up as others have noted. cooked on slow for 5 hours then pulled the chicken apart. definitely did not need two more hours on low so i switched to the warm setting. it was a drool worthy meal.

I made this exactly as is and it was so good! My husband who is very picky even went for seconds! Some people may know this tip but for those who don't, shred the chicken using a hand held mixer. It is quick and does an excellent job of shredding!

I have never cared for taco soup but I had a lot of chicken that was already cooked to use up, so I tried this recipe. It was so yummy! We are still eating it and it seems better everyday. I followed the basic recipe with the exception of using cooked chicken that I added near the end. I also have my own recipe for the taco seasoning and I used that. Usually I really tweak my recipes but it was not necessary with this one.
*** I just made this again with ground beef and we loved it even more! I did not brown the meat before putting it in the cooker, I just broke it up in small pieces. I did add a bit more taco seasoning, and used V8 instead of the tomato sauce, put the cooker on high and it was done in 4 hours.

I was hoping it to be similar to Mexican Tortilla soup, but it was more like chili with taco seasoning.  Unfortunately, I don’t think I would make this again.

It was as just ok. I really didn’t like  the beer with it at all I think it would have been better with broth. I’ll keep looking for a better recipe

Love, love, love this! Thick like a chili and so full of flavour. To be honest, I don't even need the chicken in it to enjoy. I make it regularly and it freezes well too.

Absolutely loved it.  The only change I made was used chicken broth instead of beer.  Everything else was exactly as given.  Would definitely make it again. Maybe using ground beef instead.

This was very good.  These are the changes I made only because I decided to make this at the last minute and didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I substituted the chili beans for Cannelli beans.  I used diced tomatoes with onions, and I added 1/2 tsp. Chili powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and a 1/2 teaspoon cumin. I also used Chicken broth instead of the beer.  I will make it again!

Will try again... I used 4 breasts instead of 3 and I had no issues of it needing thickening. I used diced tomatoes and chiles instead of Rotel. Next time I will do 1 can of each. I was scared the Rotel would over power the nice blend of flavors but I would like to incorporate 1 can next time. We like a little more heat so I will definitely have diced jalapeño peppers as a garnishment.

This was a good idea and easy for you to put in a crock pot before going to work. I added all the ingredients and a taco packet be and used low sodium chicken broth instead of beer. I had to add extra seasoning because it was just bland. I added salt, pepper, cummin, chilli powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoning salt along with the taco packet. and turned the pot from low to high for the last two hours. it was awesome with chips, sour cream, and cheese. I froze the rest for another night.

I was a little apprehensive about how "hot" the seasonings would be but my family all thought it was just right. In the  tradition of using what I had on hand, substituted red beans for the chili beans, used some corn frozen from our favorite farmer, used one can of diced tomatoes with chili’s and another can of diced tomotatoes, no salt added. I had a can of tomato sauce with no salt added and it was 14 ozs so used the whole thing. The connected taco seasoning recipe was also used. Will definitely make again.

I made it pretty much as written, except I had some ground beef I needed to use so I substituted the chicken for beef. I also added more liquid as mine came out too thick. I added in some beef broth and more tomato sauce. It was an easy meal that freezes well so I can pack it in my lunch bag in a pinch. Could use a little extra spice to make it better, so I'll play with that next time but I'll definitely make it again.

This was a very tasty recipe. I will definitely be making it again!  For the beer, I used Dos Equis Amber. I left out the chili beans, and took RAISINKANE AKA PATTI's advice and made Bill Echols Taco Seasoning. The chicken shredded oh so easily, and it wasn't over salty.  I put shredded cheese and plenty of sour cream (yum!) on top of my soup. I got fresh cilantro as well, but I was so excited to dive in that I forgot to use it.  I LOVE cilantro, and I'll definitely use it next time.  Even though I put extra stuff on top of mine, it was really good without it as well. I just like all my food loaded!

I made no changes. As it was cooking I started regretting using enchilada sauce, but I was wrong. It was awesome. Also, I tried a sampling of the soup before I served it, and it was good, but once you add the toppings, it turns to amesome. This will be on repeat!

Absolutely amazing!!  Although I would say it's more of a taco chili than a soup. It's kind of thick but my husband and I loved it with tortilla chips.  This will be a remake for dinner often.

I made this yesterday exactly by the recipe including the authors "Taco Seasoning".  My husband, who normally would say it's, "fine" said, "this is really tasty".   That akin to being over the moon with excitement.   I'll definitely make this one again.

kids liked. I subbed one can dice tomatoes for chicken broth instead. added diced potatoes (we like more veggies with pescatarian) and some cilantro at the end- basically hearty veggie soup w/a kick (taco seasoning).
didn't have to go the slow cooker route- just over stove-top.

Amazingly good! I've never made before. I made a FULL 6qt slow-cooker full, all but 1/2 a small bowl was left after 5 people finished. My DH said "It's screaming"! (His term for really good). Followed with "Can you make it again?"
Yes, I surely will! Thank You.

I used Heineken beer and unfortunately its taste lingered. I followed the directions exactly and cooked it for close to 8 hrs total. The beer taste was slightly detectable to 3 out of 4 of my dinner guests. The recipe itself wasn't that great. I will not be making this again.

One of my families favorite recipes when the weather turns cooler. I followed the recommendation for the Echols Taco seasoning and use the Rotel's with Habenero because we like spice.  Top with shredded cheese, sour cream and some sliced green onions and it is good for what ails ya. Thanks so much for sharing

Used chicken broth instead of beer and kidney beans in place of chili beans.  Turned out great!  Enough for leftovers after family of 4 eat.

We loved it! Made as directed except that I drained and rinsed the beans. Cooked overnight in the crockpot, I just shredded the chicken when I turned off the crockpot. Absolutely fabulous reheated for take-to-work lunches. I can't wait to make it again!

Thanks for sharing! I made half of this recipe and it was still quite a bit. My one change was due to having a baby in my house, chicken broth in place of beer.

We make this weekly! We use chicken stock instead of beer, double the beans and exclude corn. I’m not a fan of reheated leftovers but this is amazing for days after.

Made exactly as written.  Hubby and I both really liked it.  I was in a big hurry so I used packaged taco seasoning.   Will make my own next time.

I wanted to love this so much but it tasted terrible :( The beer flavor was too strong. I’m guessing got really depends on the brand of beer?

Made this with left over cooked rotisserie chicken using Old Speckled Hen English Pale Ale and dried minced onion. After three hours in the slow cooker the soup already had a very smooth, slightly smoky and mildly heated flavor. Can't imagine it would be as tasty if I had made it with the beer suggestions that pop up on the web site- Budweiser, Heineken-yikes.  Will certainly make again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and I was extremely disappointed. It was a hearty soup but there was little taco flavor and it was bitter. I used Coors Light beer because it says to use whatever beer you have. I could taste the beer too and I hate beer. Regardless, I will not be making this again. My boyfriend and I are both foodies and we thought this soup was gross.

Amazing and filling! I used chicken tenders instead of breasts because it’s what I had at home, I totally forgot to add the beer and only cooked it for 5.5 hours since I started a little too late and it was still sooo good with tons left over. I would love to make this again and for a crowd, perfect for the weather and football season.

Oh my goodness. This is now one of my favourite recipes! My boyfriend loved it as well. I made it with the recommended Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe. Amazing and flavourful with the perfect amount of heat. I am in Canada and we don't have "Rotel" which is the US company that makes "diced tomatoes with green chilies". I did however find a store brand version at "Save On Foods" under the "Western Family" brand. So to the other Canadians.. we definitely have a suitable equivalent here! It's labeled as "diced tomatoes with green chilies and lime juice". I used it in mine and it was perfect.

Three out of four in our family really liked this meal.  Easy to make.  I added frozen chicken breasts and cooked all day.  Included the recommendations of 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp cumin.   My son wasn't thrilled with it but he excluded adding the melted cheese and sour cream to his bowl, both of which I thought added a lot to this meal.

Was a bit skeptical before trying, but this was first rate.  Hard to get some ingredients in the Pacific Northwest, but with some searching and hunting, was able to get what was required.  The flavors blended nicely and topped off with some Daisy sour cream, it was first rate!  Thanks for sharing.

Best crock pot recipe yet!  Just too darn easy!  I did mix up the taco seasoning that was suggested.  I did not have beer on hand, so used chicken broth.  Used one can of Rotella, one can diced tomatoes.  I did cut up my chicken, and mixed up the night before, placed in the refrigerator.  Plugged in the crock pot the next morning on low, cooked for about 10 hours.  IT WAS A PERFECT DINNER!  Topped off with some chips, cheese, cilantro.  Will be making this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this soup for years and I LOVE it and its adaptability! I've gone meatless since first making this but I simply throw in some extra beans or a meat alternative in place of the chicle. and viola! Vegan taco soup! Other than replacing the meat I don't change a thing about this recipe and it comes out wonderful every time!

Good recipe but I didn't like the beer flavor. I'm not a beer drinker and no one in my house drinks it but I decided to take the chance, and I honestly didn't even like the smell of it once it was cooked because of the beer. However, I did eat it and it was ok. I am gonna try and make it again just maybe using a chicken broth instead of the beer. Otherwise, I like all the ingredients and I did eat the leftovers; just think I'll tweak it next time.

This was delicious - I added some extra tomatoes and broth and substituted beer for nonfat chicken broth only because it was for a large office luncheon.

I made it in my pressure cooker and it was AMAZING! I made a few changes--I put in LESS beer (only half a bottle) and added a bit of tomato juice to compensate. I also added about an 1/8 cup of non-fat, plain yogurt to it (or you could use sour cream) before cooking. It turned out AMAZING. I took it to a faculty pot luck and it was the first dish gone! ;-) I provided fresh avocado and tortilla chips as garish.

So much easier than my old chicken & tortilla soup! I used bone in chicken thighs & legs 4 pc total. Toward the end of cooking removed the chicken & deboned & added cut meat back in. I did cut back on some ingredients & still had plenty for family of 3 plus left overs. Used canned chicken broth but would give the beer a try next go round.

We loved this!  Made almost exactly as the recipe called for.  I do think the choice of beer is crucial to the flavor.  A dark Mexican beer is key, as mentioned by another reviewer.  I did add a small can of tomato paste to thicken and extra salt to make up for it, plus I used only one can of Rotel tomato and green chilis.  Topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream, add avocado if you have it. Perfectly tasty!

This recipe turned out really well! I substituted the beer for chicken stock (I was too lazy to run to the store to get a bottle). Then I added at the end some lettuce and fresh tomato because my soup came out really thick. My chicken breasts may have been larger or I shredded them too fine. Either way the taste is amazing and it was so easy to make!

This was good and super easy, and it tasted better the longer it sat. I omitted the chicken, added a cube of adobo seasoning, subbed hard cider for beer, and used my own blend of taco seasoning (New Mexico red chili powder, cumin, oregano, and garlic). In addition to the suggested toppings, I used black olives and avocado. A definite keeper!

This was a hit at my house. I will put this on repeat this coming Fall and Winter. I served it with corn muffins on the side. I also skipped the beer and added a can of chicken broth since we have a toddler (I didn't feel right using beer).

Yummy AND easy...how can you go wrong? Funny story...I put this in the crock pot before picking up my granddaughters for the weekend, ages 11 and 13. Their mom said they were not going to like it because "they don't like beans or onions" so of course I was worried. Guess what? They LOVED it and both had seconds! It passed the Chloe and Lexi test and it will be a hit with your tough lil guys, too!

I have been making  this soup for a couple years now and just haven't gotten around to rating it. This is by far the best soup I have ever made.  Everyone loves it!  I use homemade taco seasoning and don't change a thing.  Sooo good.  And I love that I can make it in the crockpot, as well as on the stove or in my pressure cooker!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is excellent!  I used 1/4 cup of Taco Seasoning 1 from this site, a bottle of Killian's Irish Red beer, and the meat from a small rotisserie chicken.  I made it on the stovetop because I was in hurry which is why I used a rotisserie chicken.  We like spicy so I served it with shredded hot habanero and jalapeño cheese.  This will definitely be in my rotation!

Oh this is a wonderful recipe! I was worried about the "beer" taste but didn't detect it at all. My add ins I used were one part Dos Equis XX beer and one part chicken stock along with a 3tsp of garlic powder and 2tsp of onion salt. Lastly I added a Knorrs chicken and tomato bullion cube for lasting flavor (I ran out of seasoning salt had to improvise!) 

Would make this again.

This recipe was bland at best.  I used the taco seasoning recipe that the original poster recommended, but after reading some of the comments, I increased all of the spices by 1/2, except for the crushed red pepper.  In spite of that, I had to add more cumin after cooking to help the flavor.  

There wasn't enough liquid to the soup and there was too much chicken compared to the other ingredients.  I plan to reduce the chicken to only 2 breasts and supplement the remainder with more beans, 12 ozs of broth, diced fire roasted tomatoes, and rework the spices.

This is a great recipe, so easy to make!  It is very versatile since you can make it more or less spicy based on taste of group preparing for.  This recipe is one of the first recipes I tried from All Recipes and it is a favorite!

It is a delicious, yet simple recipe. I substituted chicken broth for the beer. Also I didn't use the corn, not a huge fan of corn in my soup. It was super easy to follow and I will be making this again...Sprinkle cheese on top and it is divine!!

Like most soups, this recipe tastes better the day after you cook it. Also, if you like spice, this is really on the mild side. I would recommend adding some chopped jalepeño slices or hot sauce into the recipe for a nice kick.

Love this recipe very versatile.  I use a rotisserie chicken to save time and enjoy the flavor from the roasted chicken.

I do recommend adding 2 chopped garlic cloves, chili powder, salt, pepper, and a little flour to thicken the soup. The soup was too thin.

I used kidney beans instead of chili beans, used chicken stock instead of beer and homemade taco seasoning mix.   It was really good, I ate it all in 3 days by myself! I plan to make it again soon.  A little too much heat for me (I'm a spicy/heat wimp) so I'm going to use one can of diced tomatoes with chille and the other can without.

I liked this.  Followed the recipe exactly (except I mixed the seasonings suggested by the person that posted it instead of using a packaged taco mix).  I could taste a mild beer flavor which didn't bother me as I like beer-if you don't I would suggest using some type of broth instead.  This dish is very mild-if you like spicy food you should add more seasoning.  Also, it looked really thin when I took the chicken breasts out to shred them, however when I put the shredded chicken back in, the soup was quite thick-I did use 3 really large breasts.

I made this as is using a dark mexican beer as another reviewer suggested, and it came out so delicious! I totally recommend it with the beer and not chicken broth as others did, you just have to make it with the right beer is all, not some cheap sh**.

This is a great easy recipe. So easy my husband made it once lol. On a serious note this is a great meal. Great flavor, not too spicy and very fulfilling. I've made those several times now and it only keeps getting better. Highly recommend this for anyone.

I made this recipe exactly as written using Modela Dark Beer and the full recipe for the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning.  After cooking for 4 hours, I was concerned that the consistency was very watery and soupy so I made the decision to remove the cooked chicken breasts and pulse them in my food processor.  I added the cooked chicken back to the pot and this thickened it beautifully.  I used some shredded Pepper Jack Cheese I had on hand and this was so good.  Thank you for a terrific, easy recipe.

I made a couple of changes, but it turns out awesome and the family loved it. I used chicken stoke instead a beer and I used Navy beans instead of black beans. Next time I plan to keep the black beans and replace the chili beans with navy.

We didn't like the beer in it. Gave it a strange flavor. Put two cups of chicken broth in to tone it down. It was really good after that.

Needed a recipe where I just shopped my pantry and this was it. I did the Bill Echols taco seasoning as another post contained the exact measurements. 

I had some variations since I didn't have everything in stock: I used raw 1/4 Cup black beans (ensure you can cook it for 8 plus hours in slow cooker), no beer in the house so used 1.5 cup chicken broth, chicken thighs, and a can of baked beans  since i did not have chili beans. 

Overall i slow cooked for 4 hours high, then forgot about it and by time i returned i put it back for another 4 hours high. For me i mainly needed the black beans to soften, everything else was cooked and simmering. We liked it, and added shredded cheese, chopped cilantro and chips to it.

It's almost a tortilla soup, or chili. Delicious!

I left out the beer and replaced it with stock. I put in some long- soaked black beans and somehow they didn't cook properly. It's possible I did something wrong or they were old, but I recommend cooking any dry beans you want to use beforehand.  Also I thought that three whole chicken breasts was a lot, so I only used one. It made plenty of chicken. Delicious recipe. I will make it again.

I used chicken broth instead of the beer (per others suggestions), used the recipe for the taco seasoning instead of the packaged stuff and my family and I loved it! Had just the right amount of spiciness to it. I might use another chicken breast next time (I only had the "perfect portion" chicken breasts on hand which are a little smaller than regular breasts).

No changes.  Used Schillings Taco seasoning.  Used as many low salt items as I could find.  The fun aspect of this dish is you can spice it up if that suits your taste.  I always like to keep it to the original recipe until I have given it a shot.

This meal is a staple at my house! I like that I can make substitutions as needed to suit our tastes - canned chicken instead of fresh, white beans instead of black beans, chicken stock instead of beer, etc. Super adaptable, and pleases the wide variety of eaters in my hose.

This was a hearty soup that my whole family enjoyed, but I had to add more seasoning that the recipe called for because I found it bland. I added cayenne, black pepper, chili powder, cumin and salt.

This was a great recipe because it was easy to follow and it turned out really well. I made no changes except adding a little Tabasco chipotle at the end. My husband is very picky and he loved it, without any sour cream, cheese, or tortilla added on top. Will add it to my rotation of Sunday night soups.

The only change I made was to not use the beer. Instead I used the liquid I drained from the corn with additional water to make 12 ounces. Makes a lot of soup,  was easy to put together and very well liked.

Needed to make something with stuff I had lying around the house. Came out very good. I always season to my personal taste. I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder instead , added garlic powder, a splash of adobo seasoning, salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder and a dash of hot sauce. I had to add a little bit of sugar to combat the tartness of the tomatoes. Definitely include the tortilla chips for a much-needed crunch. Would not have been as good without the sour cream. Also served with crescent rolls.

Great foolproof soup, full of flavor and fiber. I did replaced the beer with chicken broth and added the spices that were suggested by others (garlic powder and cumin). Served it with avocado, cheese and nacho flakes, no leftovers each and every time (3 times al ready).

Very tasty! I used chicken broth as a substitute, because I didn't have any fun beer, and added a tbsp or two of lime juice. Really made things pop! Next time I will use a milder taco seasoning for my little ones.

I loved this soup! I didn't use the beer, and I put about 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper chili flakes in the broth as I was cooking it. Next time I will add an additional chicken breast to make it a little heartier. I served with cheese, crushed tortilla chips, and sliced avocado. Delicious!

We loved this!  My 10 year old said it might be the best meal he has ever eaten!  I had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand - 1 jar of my home-canned tomatoes (for bought ones), 1 can of tomato soup (instead of tomato sauce) to offset the acidity, a can of mixed beans (for the chili beans).  Plus lots of garlic!  You could definitely use any kind of bean in this soup, or add even more.  Also, the beer cooked perfectly into the dish - even thought my hubby and I are not beer drinkers.   We topped it with lettuce, cheese, green onions, mushrooms and crushed tortilla chips.  This will become a regular dish in our house!

This is a delicious recipe.  I read all the reviews and now substitute chicken broth for the beer and like it much better that way.  I've made this a few times for teacher appreciation lunches or dinners and its always the first soup to go.

This is terrific! I have three teens, 18 & 17 yr old boys & a picky 13 yr old girl who all gave this a thumbs up! I added cumin, chili powder & salt to give it top notch flavor. My local grocery store serves fresh tortillas daily so I warmed them up again in the microwave,  buttered & rolled them up for dipping. Delish!!

One of my favorite slow cooker recipes.  Adding toppings like cilantro, jalepenos, cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips and green onions is definitely the best part.  This always pleases a crowd, including the kids who love to dip with their chips.

This tastes like it came out of a can,  because it basically did!  

It is easy enough for a 10 yr old though.

Either avoid this recipe or substitute some fresh ingredients.

This a go-to recipe that we enjoy regularly. I usually sub the chili beans with another can black beans, frozen corn for canned, Penzey's medium chili powder or Arizona Dreaming for taco powder packet, add cumin to taste, then taste for salt at the end. Have been making this for years!

I was snowed in and had most of the ingredients on the pantry shelf but did substitute chicken broth for the beer. I made the Bill Echols taco seasoning from recipe provided by RaisinKane aka Patti.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Ro-tel tomatoes with green chilies and also put in 1 can of washed and drained kidney beans that is not in the recipe.   By doing this I added more chicken broth than called for.  I think this is a recipe that can be played with and made to suit your taste.  Everyone loved it.

We love this dish and we make it at least once a month.   I have one family member that likes it better with the beer and one that prefers the taste when it is made with chicken broth.  Either way it is delicious!

I made exactly as written. So good!! Next time, I would take the suggestion of Patti who submitted this recipe and use the homemade taco seasoning just to take the extra salt out of the mix. Thanks RaisinKane aka Patti! Enjoyed this very much and will absolutely make again.

I admit that I made some changes to this, mostly because I didn't have everything on hand. I used a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes and one with tomatoes with chilis. I also added a small can of chilis. I did not use the chili beans or tomato sauce. I used chicken broth instead of beer, but next time I will try the beer.  I also added 2 oz. of ranch dressing mix. It has so much flavor and is just the right amount of spicy. I love recipes that have some bite, but more flavor than heat and this one does. I also love that the chicken just cooks in the crockpot.

This was a big hit with the family last night.  I will definitely make it again.  I added an 8 oz. package of Philadelphia cream cheese and that gave it some creaminess and made it thicker.  Delicious and 188 cal per serving according to MyFitnessPal.

This is one of my favorite soups!  I usually replace the corn with kidney beans (white or red).  I also replace the onion with 1/4 cup of dried onion flakes, and add another 4 ounces of beer .

I attempted to make this exactly as the recipe was written, but misread it and had to make some adjustments after the fact, which actually turned out to be super fantastic. I mistakenly used two cans of diced green chiles instead of two cans of tomatoes with green chiles. I didn't have a package of taco seasoning, so I made "Taco Seasoning I" from the recipe on this site. I used a bottle of Smithwick's beer. (I was going to use Miller lite, but couldn't find any in the house - thankfully, as it turned out.) I guess given the mistake, along with the homemade seasoning, this turned out way too spicy for my taste. I read up on how to cut down on the heat of spices, and subsequently added close two cups of shredded cheddar cheese, and about a tablespoon or so of sugar. I put it in the fridge overnight to allow the flavors to blend and had it for lunch the next day. I topped it with a little bit of cheese and sour cream. OMG, best soup ever!

This was easy to make and delicious. I only had black beans so those were the only beans I included. I had no canned tomatoes, so chopped up 3 fresh ones and I also added chopped up red, yellow and orange peppers. Love fresh garlic so added approx 4 cloves. My family loved this dish - will definitely make it again.

This was a slam dunk for my family! I was nervous about adding so many beans for my children's sake but they enjoyed it.  I added an extra packet of taco seasoning and about 1/4c of chicken broth. Cooked it on high for 4 hours and just stirred it to break up the chicken.  will definitely make this again

I used the homemade taco seasoning recipe.  I found this to be so so. I much prefer this same mix of chicken, beans, and tomatoes with either chiles in adobo sauce or ranch dressing mix + taco seasoning (recipe here: https://www.google.com/amp/www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/taco-soup-recipe.amp.html)

I didn't change a thing and the beer wasn't over powering at all! I've made it  over 5 times now and it comes out great every time! If you want a less spicy version just use diced tomatoes with out the green chili peppers

Made this to test it out before serving it at one of "porch parties" with our neighbors. Mm Mm Good.  We are not beer drinkers, so I didn't have any on hand and I kind of forgot about it.  When I first taste the soup, I wasn't overly impressed, but when I served it with the dollop of sour cream stirred in and the tortilla strips and cheese... .YUMMY GOOD.  It was a hit with even the nine year old. And we ate leftovers as take along lunches for work days... was still just as good reheated in the microwave.  A definite winter rotation and will be served at the porch party.

This was one of the best things that I've made from this site.  I used a bottle of Miller Lite and it came out great.  The only little changes I made was I used spicy black beans rather than the regular kind and I used hot chili beans rather than the regular kind.  I feel like it gave it a little extra kick.  And I used a 15oz can of the tomato sauce.  I just felt like 8oz wasn't enough to really do anything.  Came out great.  Will def make again

I made this dish per the recipe and overall it was good, but I would have to say the beer has to go.  It overpowered the rest of the flavors.  If I make this again maybe I will use some chicken broth and water to replace the beer as a liquid.  Thanks for the recipe!

I need to say that I should have looked at the reviews before making this, and then made adjustments accordingly. I used a taco seasoning packet from the store, and Kilt Lifter beer, so I'm pretty sure changing these things will improve the soup next time I try it.  Thankful for reviews! Usually I look at them before I make something, but didn't this time.

Followed the recipe and, after reading some of the recommendations in the comments, I used 2 packs of taco seasoning and bought an already broiled chicken which I chopped up and added to the mix.   Turned out well and was a big hit at hunting camp.   (Great aroma when entering the cabin!)  Giving 5 stars for tastiness and ease/speed of preparation. Will use as a go-to recipe for parties and potlucks.

I did have to add more seasoning as in other reviews.  But the soup as a base is wonderful.  Thanks!  I also used bone in breasts, after they were cooked,  i took out deboned and shredded, I find bones, do give richer tastes.

Very flavorful and easy. We substituted Apple Ale instead of beer and it turned out great. Defiantly one of our regular dishes, great for these cool Fall evenings!

Absolutely fabulous just the way it is! I added extra salt but that's it! I'm hard to wow too, but for such an easy, quick recipe, this was definitely wow! Thank you!

This is a go-to recipe.  It's delicious, inexpensive  and my whole family likes it . The only change I make is I add an extra packet of taco seasoning.  I don't think one is enough.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love making this soup!  It is a hit with family and friends.  I omitted the beer and added chicken broth and I made the suggested taco seasoning myself!
I will keep the ingredients always on hand,

I can't believe how easy this soup was to throw together and how delicious it tasted.  I was running short on time so I cooked on high for 3 hours, then shredded chicken and finished on low for 2 hours.  Perfect result!

Very delicious recipe! I always use chicken thighs instead of breasts as they're more tender. I also used Octoberfest beer, which I could taste and thought it went well with the comfort food & fall vibe. Some people mentioned they prefer adding chicken broth instead of beer, but I don't think that would taste as good. I thought it was the perfect amount of spicy using diced tomatoes with green chilies. My boyfriend doesn't like cheese/sour cream but I do, so I just added the toppings to mine and we were both happy. Would definitely make again!

I followed the recipe to the "T" but replaced the beer with the chicken broth due to the mixed reviews.  However, the chicken flavor and the meatiness from the chili beans clashed.  Leave out the chili beans because it thickened the soup gave it more of a spicy stew like texture.

This will definitely go into my regular rotation of meals! So easy to make and super delicious. I couldn't find chilis in sauce. I did find sauce with chilis. Didn't give it enough kick, so I added some chili powder.

I used all low sodium canned beans and veggies and it still turned out really good. Next time I might try adding a jalapeño for a little kick. Great recipe, very hearty.

I've made this 4 times now and love it, especially with a spoon of sour cream on top of my bowl. It's very flavorful and hearty.  An alternative is to buy an already cooked whole roasterie chicken and shred it into the soup the last 30mins of cooking.

For the beer I used Warsteiner and for the taco seasoning I use Alton Brown's recipe. It is not a bad recipe; not the best taco soup that I have made, but it is pretty quick and easy. For me the biggest flaw with this recipe is the lack of depth to the flavor. There is flavor, but it is neither complex or satisfying. The soup ends up with just a hint of something, but is too wan to carry the day.

Holy moly, this is amazing.  I wasn't even able to add the tomato sauce or shred the chicken until just before serving it, and it was still dynamite. I did use the home made taco seasoning recipe recommended.  Gotta believe that made a difference. This will be in heavy rotation through the fall and winter.

I made this and I think it turned out very well.The only changes that I made were as follows: 
-enchilada sauce in stead of beer 
-red pepper flakes, chilli powder, cumin powder, garlic salt

We prefer things a bit spicy so this worked well for us. Will make this again!

Loved it. I thought the beer gave it a bolder flavor than some others I've tried. Only change I made was to buy chili beans in medium sauce and include with and I also make my own taco seasoning.

My family and I loved this!! I made a few changes but overall it's a great recipe. I substituted chicken broth/stock for beer, added 2 cans rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies, 1 can mexicorn, 2 cans regular corn, 3 cans black beans drained (half a can with seasoned juice), 1 can spicy chili beans undrained, 1 whole onion and 1 green pepper cut into pieces. I used about a 1/4 packet of taco seasoning then added a couple taps of garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, cilantro leaves and white pepper. Topped with tortilla chips and mexican cheese, it was just the right amount of spice! Great, heart warming soup for a chilly night (or a warm Florida one for me).

Great recipe! I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans (personal preference) and it turned out great. The only thing i'll change for next time is using half the bottle of beer, since you can definitely taste it. Still turned out great, though! To me, it was more of a chili. I served with shredded cheddar cheese on top, doritos and sour cream.

I made it with the chicken broth, instead of beer and it came out great. The chili beans I used had jalapeños in them and it came out someone spicy. My kids are it ALL up. This recipe is a keeper!

I didn't use a crock pot made it on stove top in my iron dutch oven.  It took about 1 1/2 hours and it was absolutely delicious.  Served with scallions, cheese, tostidos and avocado.  I'll be making this again and again.......

I liked it however I think I'm going to try to season it myself next time rather than use taco seasoning.

Awesome. Turned out perfectly. I used chicken stock instead of beer because we didn't have any in the house. Sour cream and avocado garnish were added perfection.

I made exactly to recipe except for the beer simply because I didn't have any! Delicious and perfect consistency. Thinking beer might have made it too thin.will definitely make again

This was good. I used pork roast leftovers, as that's what I had on hand and left out the black beans (not in the cupboard). Added a little more cumin.   Will make this again!

Amazing!  I used home canned tomatoes and a small can of green chilies. I omitted the beer and tomato sauce because my home canned tomatoes had lots of liquid. My entire family loved it!!

This soup was delicious - both my daughters (6 and 8) gave it thumbs up. I used chicken broth in place of beer and at the end I heated up a can of cannellini beans in the microwave, puréed in the food processor and stirred in to thicken. The soup was just too watery for our tastes and I guess we wanted more of a chili consistency. I cooked in the slow cooker a little over 5 hours on low and that was plenty of time. Any more and I think the chicken would have dried out. Served with some plain Greek yogurt (that cooled down the spice for my daughters). Yum!

The recipe as is, it's very good. With the juice of a freshly squeezed lime it is EXCELLENT. 
I'm married to a real, 100% Mexican and she didn't accuse me of cooking Tex-Mex. She even ate two bowls of the soup.

I make this at least once a month. My husband and my kids love it. I made as is except no beer. I don't like the taste u get when cooking with beer. Instead I use chicken broth and it tastes extremely good. Thanks for the recipe.

This is very good. I substitute the beer with broth and I think it's amazing. I also use the spicy taco season pack for a little kick. Add a little fresh cilantro, avocado and sour cream aver it's dished up and it perfect! We love it!

I did not have tomato sauce (which I assume was meant to me tomato puree, not ketchup - Kiwi here!) or tinned tomatoes with chilis. So I used two tins of regular tomatoes, I added some crushed chili - maybe 1/2-1tsp and a 2 tbsp tomato paste to try to compensate for my slightly wrong ingredients.
It was beautiful! It needed no seasoning adjustments. The flavour and texture was spot on. It was almost like a stew in terms of consistency. It got gobbled by the family.
I just had it with sour cream, cheese and a bit of fresh cilantro (fresh coriander for the Kiwis reading). It was filling as it was. I did not need the chips with it but I am sure they would have been nice.
I am making another batch for my work lunches this week (I am not sharing it with my family this week, it is all mine!)

I made this for a work potluck and everyone loved it.  I did omit the beer just because I didn't have any on hand, but I think it would only elevate this dish even more.   I sub'd chicken broth, and it also turned out alright.   

My daughter noted that it was missing "something".   We added some fresh cilantro, a few red pepper flakes,  and a little bit of lime juice and that seemed to kick it right up a notch, but seasonings are always subjective.  I loved this as written.   (Granted I had to omit the beer, but that'll change the next time I make it).  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Really good!  Subbed white beans for chili beans since it's what I had. Also subbed chicken broth for beer cause I didn't have any. Made in my instant pot under stew cause my slow cooker wasn't working. Will DEFINATELY make in IP in the future. Tastes fantastic!!

One of my family's favorites! I omit the green chiles and add a can of regular diced tomatoes. A nice dark beer is the key. (Celebration/pale ale) A definite winter and fall staple in our home :)

I, my family and friends love this recipe.  I have made it several times now for dinner, potlucks, and parties.  Even one of my "cook-challenged" sons makes it for himself now!  The original recipe is great but for those who nix the beer, the correct beer enhances the soup ten fold.  I use Sapporo beer as it was on hand when I first made it and it really makes this soup even more yummier.  Since I love tomatoes, I always use a full 15-16 oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8 oz.   For the spicier batches I have chopped up and added one of the Chipotle peppers from a small can of  "Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce" (taking out the seeds though for those who are sensitive to such).  I also have used crushed fresh garlic which is nice but doesn't really enhance the already great flavor.   This is such an easy recipe to make and is a great meal that goes a long way for those on a tight budget.

Seriously amazing. I made it exactly as it said except I skipped the onion because I did not have any. I also used fresh diced tomatoes from the garden and just added a small can of diced green chilies. For the beer I used a bottle of Michelob ultra.

So easy and delicious!  I added a little chorizo sausage, just because I had some on hand (totally not necessary), but otherwise, followed the recipe perfectly. The soup made a hearty dinner served with salad, and the leftovers froze and re-heated well. Will definitely make this again and again!

Used the taco seasoning mixture mentioned in the comments. Due to having extremely large chicken breasts, mine was a bit chicken heavy for a soup. Flavor wise, this recipe rocks! I don't think I would change a thing beyond adding about 1/2 more of the taco season mixture just because it tastes so good. It has a well balanced flavor and tasted great with yellow rice too. The only hard thing about making this is waiting to eat it after the aroma starts filling the house. But definitely wait. The chicken turns out moist and so good.

The perfect soup for a rainy day like today. I used Bill's taco spice mix as suggested. I couldn't find the right beans so I used two tins of Four Bean Mix instead. And I used beer as the recipe said. Very tasty.

Made the recipe as is except added cilantro cause I am addicted to it.   Topped it with crushed tortilla chips, lime squeeze, cheese, sour cream and a little more extra cilantro of course!! So yummy!!!

The beer in this is overwhelming. I would recommend maybe using 1/2 the beer recommended.

I made this for my family. I'm allergic to chicken so I did not get to eat it, but my family loved it. I will be making it many more times.

Such an easy recipe and oh-so-good! I do however, substitute chicken broth in place of the beer. This is one of our go-to recipes that we love and so quick to make in a hurry. Also, instead of corn chips l use the tortilla strips you find in the salad topping area at the store. They are a southwest type of flavor that adds to the deliciousness.

Delicious excluding the beer, used chicken broth instead. Filled the entire crockpot, plenty for leftovers.

Overall a good recipe, but the chicken was over cooked. Perhaps a 4 or 4 ½ hour first stage. I used a spicy taco seasoning to kick it up a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed the flavour. I added Avocado and Sour Cream on top and it was really really good. Only negative I could find was that the soup was a little too watery, If it was slightly thicker it would be perfect!

i MADE THIS RECIPE AND IT WAS GREAT. uSING THE SLOW COOKER, i  WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE TIME SCHEDULE BUT AS SOON AS i GOT HOME i TOOK OUT THE CHICKEN, wHEN COOL ENOUGH TO HANDLE i SHREDDED IT AND PUT BACK INTO CROCK POT. THE SHREDDING HELPED TO ABSORB THE JUICE AND UPON EATING I WAS AMAZED AT HOW IT TASTED. TOPPING WITH AVOCADO AND PLAIN GREEK YOGURT  WAS EXCELLENT.

I put this recipe together in literally 10 minutes.  The broth is rich and I might venture to say healthy. I added tortilla strips, sour cream, avocado, and some Mexican cheese blend. Delicious.

This Chicken Taco Soup is excellent. My older kids loved it. Since it is a little spicy my younger daughter 8 years old did not like it.

Subbed pinto beans for the black beans and chilli beans and added a package of chilli seasoning mix, because I didn't have the other beans on hand.  Served with sour cream, fiesta cheese and Fritos. Turned out good. The husband loved it. I will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe without adding beer or sour cream. It turned it to be easy and it tasted great. I didn't use canned beans. I soaked the beans over night and chopped the chickens to small pieces instead of shredding :)

I  made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit! (Rare because my husband is the cook in our house and rarely likes what I make.) I only used 2 chicken breasts because I'm not a big meat eater; my husband is a big meat eater and we both felt that there was enough chicken with just the two. Also, I thought I had tomato paste and diced tomatoes w/ chilies at home but I only had a can of diced tomato with basil which I used instead.

We thoroughly enjoyed this tasty soup that was not so spicy that it couldn't be served to children or sensitive adults.  I followed the recipe per se and provided condiments that would increase zing or just add value to taste.

I loved how incredibly easy this was.   I was unsure whether to drain the beans or not, so I didn't.  It cooked on low for about 10 hours before I could get home, but still turned out great.

I made it with the chicken broth instead of white wine, and used frozen chicken breasts as someone suggested; cooked for 10 hours; chicken shredded easily; cooked for another hour or so. Mine came out really thick. Will use more broth next time and this definitely needed the large crock pot! Rich flavor so. Will make again.

I substituted chicken broth for beer. I also placed the chicken on the bottom & shredded in the pot. Some ate cornbread muffins, others at corn chips, all enjoyed!

Just Wow!  Had left over steak and prime rib(already cooked and some on the bone.  I never throw anything out) in freezer and threw it all in the pot vs chicken.  Added some extra seasonings and use Northern beans vs chilly beans because that is all I had. Use pumkin oct fest for the beer, again all I had and wanted gone. So easy and tasty.  You can not mess this up it you tried.  Thanks!

I have made several recipes via slow cooker & grill that call for beer or wine. I found that if the people don't see & you don't tell .   .. . 10 out of 10 don't find anything to complain about.
Face it. After 5 hrs in a slow cooker or 20 minutes on the grill .. .all the alcohol has cooked off. It's a mental obstacle for some people. My mother-in-law loved my grilled chicken until she found I had marinated it with wine.

Not happy with the beer! It just leaves a very bitter taste in an otherwise good soup.

I LOVE taco soup and this  one is the best tasting one I have really enjoyed. However, I fixed it on the stove top. Same ingredients with a few additions. I used a 6 qt. Dutch Oven, first I browned the onion in 1 Tablespoon of olive oil on med heat for approx. 4-5 minutes (stirring occasionally . Push onions to side and add the chicken to the oil and lightly brown (4-5 mins. Each side). Add the remainder of the ingredients. I then added 1-15.5 oz. can (drained) Garbanzo peas and 1-32 oz. box of chicken broth. Stove top cooking evaporates the liquid faster than slow cooker, so I knew it would need more liquid.Although, water can be used instead of broth but, I wanted as much layers of flavor as possible. Turn up the heat, bring to boil,  put lid on and turn heat to low and cook for 1-1/2 hours. Stirring occasionally. Take chicken out and shred,  add chicken back to soup. That's it, it' s ready to bowl-up and add your favorite toppings, serve, and enjoy. We like crushed white tortilla chips or fried tortilla strips. This is one to cherish in your 'go to' recipe file.

the recipe is just a can of this, a can of that, preparation 15 min. 
i guess this is only for americans, since you find those cans in the states. 
i agree it is easy cooking, but not real cooking..

Love this recipe and so does the family. My only tweak is we don't use the onion and beer. Look up taco seasoning 1 on here, has a lot of reviews, that's what we use and it's great if you don't mind it a little spicy.

I've made this many times. I use black beans and pintos, corn, tomatoes, green chilis, chicken, cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, green enchilada sauce, taco seasoning and add in yellow Spanish rice.  Top with cheese or sour cream, it's fantastic!

I make this recipe a lot.  I've made some changes.  I use 1/2 can sliced chiles and 2 cans of black beans and no chili beans.  I also add 2 cloves of minced garlic.  This is a great recipe to make and freeze the extras for the week ahead.

I have made this recipe several times using Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe. My family and I love it! I usually serve it with tortilla chips, cilantro and sliced scallions as well as the grated cheese and sour cream (light versions). I also use no-salt versions of some, but not all of the canned goods. This soup is not only delicious, but also reasonably low-cal and healthy.

This was very easy and was a crowd pleaser.  Made the house smell lovely.  I skipped the beer.  Only thing I wish would be that it wasn't as thick a soup - might add chicken stalk in place of half the tomato sauce.

I have made this several times and everyone always loves it.  It is super easy and very tasty.  This is now my go to recipe for company  or family when I don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.  Just put it all in the crockpot and let it simmer.  Then shred the chicken and you are done!

I've been using this recipe for years.  We love it.  Very easy and very good.  I make this for a freezer meal and it reheats well.  I sometimes cook this in the oven instead of the crockpot.  Alos I use all black beans and chicken broth instead of beer.

I have never been a fan of soup of any kind, but when a cold winter snap hit my area I thought I'd give this a try.   It is one of the best recipes I've tried from this entire website.   I didn't change a thing.   My husband loved it too.   Try it.   You won't be disappointed.

Awesome!!! I've done this several times in the crockpot and it's perfect every time. I did use one can regular diced tomatoes and one with Chilis as my sweetheart doesn't like it spicy. Also used leftover rotisserie chicken that I deboned and cooked it on the stove and just added some extra chicken broth. Let it simmer for 45 minutes or so and its great!!!

Recipe was a huge hit at the Firehouse. One thing everyone keeps saying about taking out the beer; leave the beer in and make sure you get a good expensive Mexican Lager beer. I used Dos Equis Amber($18 for a 12 pack) and because I made the meal 4 times larger, I used 4 12 oz bottles of beer and you can't taste it at all. Don't use IPA's or Ale's they are to bitter and have too potent of flavors to be added. Also don't use some cheap light watered down beer, there is too much water in them and not the right type of flavors.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have the chili beans or the tomatoes with green chilies.  With that said I used only black beans and substituted a cup (maybe a bit more) of medium heat salsa for the tomatoes.  I also added about a cup of water.  My soup/chili came out on the thicker side which we happened to love!  Flavors were excellent and leftovers even better! Def a keeper!

This is a nice recipe, however I'm only giving 4 stars since I found it was not as flavorful as I would like.  Read some more reviews and added cumin, garlic powder, a bit of chili powder, rock salt and pepper.  This is specific to my taste so it may not be for everyone.  It's in the crock-pot now and with my changes I think it will be very good.

Possibly the easiest meal I've cooked all week.  I added some pico that was sitting unused in my fridge.  Delicious!

The beer ended up being a little over powering, that said it wasn't bad. I think next time I will cut back on the beer and maybe see about adding extra seasonings.

I loved it! This was super easy and good. I changed a few things. I used black beans in chili sauce for the chili beans and only used a half can and I used black beans as well drained mostly. I added two tablespoons of chopped garlic. I also used chicken taco seasoning. What else I changed is I added fresh cilantro in the mix as well. I added a little more cumin, black pepper and garlic powder.  I didn't have the beer so I used chicken broth. Topped with tortilla strips cheese and squeezed some lime juice! Excellent easy for a busy day! Cooked for 8 hours on low since I was at work! We will definitely be making this again! Don't add any extra salt it has plenty with the taco seasoning. ??

Absolutely delicious!  Made it exactly as instructed including your taco seasoning mix.  Used Dos Equis amber beer.  We topped it w/ sour cream & crushed up some tortilla chips.  Next night I put it in whole wheat tortillas after cooking it down some to make it a bit thicker.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

I made this one tonight and my husband LOVED it! Followed the recipe exactly, minus the corn. Hubby is funny about corn in his food. Super easy and basic ingredients. Love simple recipes with GREAT flavor. This one is a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe.  I've made it many times, and it is always scrumptious and perfect for dinner guests.  I have always used bud light lime, and could always slightly taste and smell the beer, which I personally didn't care for.  I forgot beer one time and used hard cider, which worked fine....however I read another review on here that said to use a dark Mexican beer, so I bought Modelo Negra at Safeway, and I must say it made the difference.  No beer taste or smell at all.

No alcohol is allowed in my family's diet. I substituted chicken broth for the beer. I added some garlic and used only 1 can of Rotel . When I tasted the soup at the end of cooking time, I found it little bit bland. It might be because of the changes I had to make or the brand of Taco seasoning. But, adding little cumin and some chopped Cilantro made the soup taste a lot better.
I served this topped with some avocadoes, sour cream, cheese and some corn chips. It was a very comforting meal in a cold winter night

Very good and super easy! Great for family & friend vacation trips where you're cooking for a crowd. The only thing I'd do different is because my kids don't like tomatoes, I'd blend them smaller and add more beans.

I made this for my school's soup group and many teachers trekked down to my room just to tell me the soup was fantastic!  For that time, the only thing I changed was the beer (there are some anti alcohol anything teachers) for chicken stock.  The second time I made it I used the beer.  Both were awesome.

We love, love, love this soup.  We use chicken thighs which shred right in the pot with a little stirring eliminating the take out the breast and shred step.  We usually add some jalapeños and more spice at the end.  We like it hot!  And, for the taco seasoning we use Bill Echols Taco Seasoning as recommended by the author RaisinKane.  Delish.

We make this frequently as it is very quick to throw together and tastes great. We have used a number of different beers and have found that Yuengling Lager adds the best flavor, but of course your mileage may vary!

Delicious soup. I don't think it needs this much chicken, however, and would reduce it to two breasts next time rather than three.

I couldn't find my recipe for Taco Soup and this one seemed similar.  After my first taste, I realized what this recipe did not include.  My old recipe calls for a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.  This gives it more taste.  I thought it was a bit bland.

I make this up then freeze a lot of it so I can take it to work for lunches.  This is my go to meal every time there is a potluck at work.  They must like it because it's always gone.  I always use an IPA for the beer because of the all the hops really add to the flavor.  Also, instead of cheddar cheese and chips I use Mexican cheese and torn up cor tortillas.

This makes a lot of soup! Since there are only two of us I get about 3 or 4 extra dinners to freeze. I have taken leftovers and put over romaine lettuce with sour cream and avocado. It gets thicker in freezer or I pour off extra liquid.
Very easy to make and you can spice it up by using 2 packages of taco seasoning.

So tasty and so easy to make!! Everyone else loved it as well :) I served with some 90 second rice that we scooped right in to the soup. The only modifications I made were an extra can of corn and an additional type of bean.

Delicious!  There's only two of us so I made a smaller portion by using only one can of black beans and one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  I used chicken broth over beer and a dollop of sour cream while my husband opted for shredded cheddar cheese.  It would be good also with the crushed tortilla chips as well!  About 10-15 minutes to prep and sooo good to eat!!

I have been making this for a year now and my family loves it. I sometimes add a couple of different seasonings. It is amazing on those cold nights and when you want your house to smell so good like you have been cooking for hours and you haven't . 
Thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe and so easy too! I made the recipe exact, except instead of beer I used chicken broth. It is great when you have guests coming. This way you don't have to be out in the kitchen cooking for hours....break out the slower cooker and later in the day your meal is ready to. Many times I make corn muffins to go along with it.

Made this exactly as directed with the suggested taco seasoning. I added a little extra chicken stock just to thin it and stretch the recipe.  Using a good dark beer is key.  Negra Modela is my go to beer.  It's tasty and easy to find.  My husband and I loved it but it was just touch too spicy for our eight year old. He liked it very much but sadly has not inherited our love of a little extra heat. This will definitely go in to our winter rotation minus the crushed red pepper.

We have been making this soup/stew for three years now - usually at least twice each winter. It's great for warming up on a cold night, and any extra freezes and reheats beautifully. The additions that we have made are a couple of teaspoons of pimentón (smoked Spanish paprika), maybe a teaspoon of cumin, 1 roasted jalapeño, 1 roasted cubanelle 2/3 roasted habanero (if you'd like to add some heat), and 3 cloves of crushed garlic. In addition to the garnishes listed, we also top with a little cilantro, a wedge of fresh squeezed lime and avocado.

Great recipe, but I would add another packet of taco seasoning- perhaps rub the seasoning on the raw chicken breasts before adding to the mixture. The soup flavor was great, but the chicken was rather bland. Spouse did not care for the beer taste, so I will omit that in the future.

I  did not put the beer in like others said and it was fantastic!! I have made it 5 times for guests and everyone loves it.  Adding  toppings like avocado, sour cream, grated cheese, tortilla chips (even Fritos), and  chopped olives makes it even more delicious and  guests have fun choosing toppings.  This is a go-to for me now.

I first made this several years ago and it has become a recipe that everyone asks for - and I love it. It is easy and delicious; I make it nearly as it is written with perfect success every single time.  The toppings help everyone make it to their own taste: cilantro, sour cream, cheese, crushed tortilla chips, and avocado or guacamole.

Followed the recipe almost exactly.. I did substitute the beer for chicken broth and I added a pinch of cumin and a tbsp of garlic powder. I also cooked on high for about 4 1/2 hours.. Chicken fell apart so I knew it was done. No additional cook time !! It was amazingly delicious !

My husband and son loved it and my son is picky. We used dark beer and it was very good.. I did add a little sugar as suggested. I used mild taco seasoning and next time I'd use medium taco sauce for a little more zing

I made this without any substitutions (and using the allrecipes taco seasoning recipe she recommended).  My husband and I liked it but we both thought it tasted like chili, not a chicken taco soup. I also thought it was too spicy.  I used original Rotel (never bought it before) and didn't realize there was a mild Rotel until I looked online to see if original Rotel was supposed to be so spicy.  My lips were on fire and my nose was running...too spicy, even with sour cream and cheese on top.  I used Yuengling Oktoberfest as the beer...couldn't taste it.

I added a bit extra spices, left the beer out, and it turned out pretty good. Would add more water or broth, was definitely more of a chili than a soup/

This was amazing!!!!! I used Modelo Amber for the beer and used a couple orange Goya packets along with the taco seasoning. I topped it with avocado, cheese, sour cream a dash of fresh cilantro and a splash of fresh lime. Sooooooo delish.

This has become one of our weekly meals.  The first time I made, my mother wasn't going to eat b/c she doesn't like tacos b/c she doesn't like the taste of the meat.  This worked great b/c it has chicken instead & the taco seasoning is used to season whole soup not just meat.  She loved it.  I also have a picky son who doesn't like tomatoes, but he loves this.  We tried it using beer first time & chicken broth second, I prefer the beer, it enhances flavors better.  I made no changes to it except I use chicken tenders instead of whole breast.  Thank you so much for giving me a recipe so we aren't eating the same thing over & over.  We love it & we eat it with fritos.   :)

Made this two nights ago - it was delicious!! I used a bottle of Corona and it worked really well. Just a mild hint of beer in the flavour. Recipe was really fast and easy to make. My husband loved it and asked that this be in the regular dinner rotation!

I love making this recipe this time of year.  It is super easy to make and taste like you spent hours making it.  I double the recipe and make my own taco seasoning.  I pressure cook a whole chicken which makes its own broth.  Once my chicken is done (25 min) I shred and add the broth to the pot with the rest of ingredients. Tortilla chicps, sour cream, cheese and avocado on the side and you have a hearty meal.  I do omit the beer and it is still delicious.

I just added some pepper and garlic powder. (just sprinkled it in no measuring.) I also added extra chicken and another 1/2 envelope of taco seasoning.  Everyone loves it especially my husband!

Very easy and so delicious! I did sauté onions and then about a tsp of garlic as I usually add them to most dishes. I decided to split the controversy and added a can of chicken broth and 2/3 of a bottle of Stella. Flavor was awesome. I didn't have "chili beans" but did have kidney beans so I added them. Will definitely make again. The whole family loved it.

This stuff in incredible!  I added two more chicken breasts, and I would definitely do that again.  Also, I'd recommend using a "good" beer, not something light and cheap.  I used a Boulevard Bob's 47 and it was amazing!  The taste is very subtle, but you can taste a bit of it in the meat.  I topped mine off with sour cream and shredded cheese and it was to die for!  This may replace my standard chili recipe!

This is one of my favorite crockpot recipes! Easy to make and tasty. I use chicken stock instead of beer and add an extra can of black beans. I usually serve it with corn bread muffins. It freezes well too so I freeze the leftovers in individual size portions for a quick lunch I can bring to work.

This was pretty good. Cilantro and green onions among other toppings are a must. I would use slightly less chicken; maybe two large breasts or three small. I omitted tomatoes but might try adding salsa next time. I used a bit more cumin and more chicken broth. I ended up cooking mine for about 12 hours, which is not necessary but worked for me. some hot sauce might be nice too, or maybe just to top. Thank you :)

I hate to waste food, So this recipe was perfect. I used left over taco meat instead of chicken. 2 cans of chili no blk beans. I didn't want to waste half a can of tomato sauce so I added a 16 oz Chaldea beer  (my husbands favorite beer) It has Clamado sauce in it. 1 lg can tomatoes with lime and cilantro. I also made the Taco seasoning as directed It was good a bit to much cumin for me but I will use it again making adjustments to my taste. Topped with chips, sour cream and Tillamook cheese. I know that this is now a completely different recipe but the idea sprang from this fabulous versatile recipe. Bonus: I didn't waste any food or have to run to the store. Thank you.

My boyfriend and I adore this recipe. We make it all year round. We've made it with the both packaged taco seasoning and Bill Echols Taco Seasoning (ingredients provided by RaisinKane aka Patti in one of the comments). I prefer the Bill Echol Taco Seasoning over anything packaged, but that's just me. I HIGHLY suggest using Yuengling for this recipe. Hasn't failed me yet!

Nice tasting soup. I cubed the chicken and slow cooked it on high for about 5-6 hours stirring once or twice. Don't forget the beer! I used PBR and it still added a nice flavor. I added a little heat by throwing in 2 jalapeños and a ghost. (de-seeded) the heat was nice, probably should have diced the ghost up a little bit more to avoid a sudden intense surprise.

I liked the recipe, easy to make, but mine turned out kind of weird, probably due to the beer I used. The only beer I had on hand was a "Bud Light", and I should have just skipped adding it all together. It gave the soup a strange flavor, not horrible, just not quite right. Next time I would use a better beer or just substitute using chicken broth.

not sure i should even rate given the changes I made but we all do tweak things to our liking, budget, and on hand items. First off i was impatient and wanted tonight so I diced a red onion and sauteed in butter than transferred to my soup pot and then i sauteed 3 pounded out chicken  breast in same pan coated with chili powder and some garlic and salt. In the soup kettle i added 2 cans of corn , one can of seasoned black beans, once can of petite diced tomatoes (with garlic i believe) Instead of plain tomato sauce i added a can of hunts garlic and onion spag, sauce. I had no beer so I added three beef boullion cubes cuz thats what I had....and three cups of water, one and 1/2 packages of taco seasoning, about a teaspoon cumin (eyeballed it) and some garlic powder and additional chilli powder.  Some one mentioned sugar and i always add a little to my spag sauce  so I added a tablespoon of that too. diced up my chicken pretty small and threw it in...boiled for a while as I stirred than simmered for a while, had my boys (10 and 12) taste test advising that i would be adding some  cheese on each bowl with a dollop of s,c and some tortilla chips!!! THEY LOVED IT!!!  so there are my two cents for what its worth...go with your gut ... i cant remember the last time i followed a recipe to the T

Excellent flavours- spice up it up as much as you'd like.  I also do this soup on the stovetop.  Brown the diced chicken in a little olive oil along with chopped onions and garlic.  Add to the other ingredients and simmer for about an hour.  I omitted the beer, used a splash of red wine vinegar,  and added chopped cilantro before serving with a little cilantro on top for garnish.  I once served this soup to 40 people and it was a huge hit!  Lots of second helpings!

This was great!  Yes I was one of those that did read the reviews and changed it a bit.  Which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5.   I can tell that if I hadn't made the changes it would have only been a 3 or 4 star recipe.  I doubled the taco seasoning, instead of tomatoes with chilies I added fire roasted diced tomatoes and then a small can of diced chilies, added frozen corn and lastly added 2 of the homestyle stock gel packs.   I agree with others and use a GOOD quality beer.  Remember if you wouldn't drink it because of the flavor then don't cook with it!  Will do this again but tweaking it.  A little too heavy on the tomato for us so I'm going to eliminate the sauce and see how that goes.
UPDATE:  So for those that like this soup but get heartburn from all the tomato you can sub the can of tomato sauce with a can of pumpkin.  It will give it the kind of creamy texture and you can't taste the pumpkin.  Kids and husband said it tasted the same.

Absolutely fantastic! Made it in my dorm room to share with friends and everyone loved it! Had to substitute chicken stock for beer, as I'm 20 and couldn't buy beer to put in it, but it turned out perfectly! Will definitely make it again!

Hit the spot! Very similar to slow cooker Chicken Tortilla soup but chunkier/ less soupy. Great topping for nachos or baked potatoes. Instead of taco seasoning packet I used 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 &1/2 tsp cumin,  1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 tsp ground chipotle pepper, 1 tsp sea salt and 1 tsp black pepper and a bay leaf. Next time I will add cilantro before eating. Ate with tortilla chips, avocado and cheese. Next time will add lime juice. Will make again!

Made for a parent teacher conference pot luck for staff.  Really easy to make on the stove or  in crockpot.  I thought the can of chilli over powered a lot of  the flavor. And we'll probably just use other beans instead.  I omitted  the beer and used broth.  All in all, very tasty and I think I'll make this for my family in the near future.   Added the sour  cream, cheese and corn chips as toppings.  Will update after the staff has lunch tomorrow.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and took out the beer and but in cream of chicken soup and chicken stock. I also put in some cilantro and green onions. Instead of using chicken breasts I browned ground chicken in a pan, drained it, and then added it to the slow cooker. The next time I make this I'm going to add something for more spicy-ness.

I made this recipe as directed using Bud Light. Not sure I even noticed the beer taste. I really liked the overall taste of this easy crock pot meal.  I made the taco seasoning as listed by one of the reviewers.  This is the second time I have made this dish and it probably won't be the last.

Turned out very well. Was looking for an easy slow cooker recipe to eat at the end of a busy day. I used dried beans that I soaked overnight instead of canned. I also added mushrooms, a whole diced pepper, and two diced celery stalks to get some veggies. I didn't have beer on hand so I used chicken broth instead. The chicken stayed very moist and shredded nicely once cooked. I made enchiladas but this could be eaten as a soup/chili or in burritos with fresh toppings. Loved the texture of this meal.

Delicious.  One can of tomatoes with green chilies was enough for my spice liking.  I did add more canned tomatoes instead though.  I also substituted the beer for chicken broth since we do not drink beer, and therefore do not have any in the house.  The whole family enjoyed the recipe.

Made this today and served it with some (yellow) cornbread. Good but missing something I cannot put my finger on. Will definitely try it again and maybe play around with it a touch. Be a great dish on a cold winter day.

My whole family LOVES this recipe! I have shared it with many friends as well. The only thing I changed is the corn, My husband doesn't like corn in soups or chili so instead of whole kernel corn, I used 1 can of Whole Baby Corn. That way it is a lot easier to avoid scooping it out for some people.

Really good, I read the reviews and decided to substitute chicken broth for the beer.  It was delicious, easy and I would make it again.  I topped mine with avocado, cheese and sour cream.

I thought this was a little bland so I added  1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. salt, pepper and oregano. Forgot the corn, darn it, but I don't think that affected the flavor.  I don't think it needed to cook that long. My chicken was done in 2 1/2 hours but I did cut the breasts in half.

I have made this SO many times as it has become a family favorite! I follow the recipe pretty exactly (but I use low/no sodium canned & packaged ingredients when available) and it turns out perfect every time. Love it!

Made this using rotisserie chicken cut into large chunks so it didn't disintegrate in the crockpot. Topped with tortilla chips, shredded Mexican cheese and sour cream. I also made the taco seasoning per suggestion in reviews. Quick easy soup for cold nights and will freeze well.

I love this soup. The only change I made was frozen vs canned corn. And sometimes I do frozen chicken. You just have to cook it about an hour longer.  Great flavor. Very versatile. Had my family over for dinner and doubled the recipe. I could cool it off with sour cream and cheese for my grandma or spice it up with hot sauce for my husband. Perfect!

I made this for myself, my boyfriend, and our roommate and everyone loved it. I recommend NOT completely substituting the beer for chicken broth. I used 12 ounces of Negra Modelo but also added just under 8 ounces of chicken broth and it was perfect! Definitely going to make this again.

This recipe was delicious! I used ghost river beer. The flavor was great and the corn added a nice pop. I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and avocado. I will definitely make it again!

So good! We used a dark beer in the recipe, and once we got a dollop of sour cream on the top, and a handful of Fritos......it was delicious!

This is my favorite soup recipe, EVER! I have made it exactly as the recipe reads and I have made a few tweaks, but it always ends up excellent.  I use Trader Joe's taco seasoning, which is much stronger than others, so I don't need to add any extra spice.  I have also added a Uncle Dan's ranch packet and it makes the soup a bit more creamy. YUMM! Use a Corona and you can't go wrong.

Super good! Made for a dinner with friends and I got compliments from them all. Going to add another chicken next time for more chicken. I didn't shred the chicken I just chopped it. I'm so glad I bought all the ingredients twice while at the store because I'm totally making this again. Will continue to make this again and again as its wonderful. For the beer I used Sleeman cream ale.

I made this with the amount of beer it called for and did not like it at all. Even my husband, who is a craft brew fanatic, didn't like the overwhelming flavor of the beer. I've talked to friends who made it and loved it but they made it with chicken stock. I think it would be good if it was made with the stock instead of the beer, or perhaps half and half.

Always delicious and always simple. We use two packets of taco seasoning - whichever kind is on sale. I normally toss it in with frozen chicken breasts and it cooks for at least 10 hours while I'm at work. This is always our favorite "first cool day of Fall" recipe!

Delicious!!!  This recipe makes  a full crock pot and only lasted 2 days in our home. No need to substitute anything. It's perfect the way it is. Very flavorful. And for those of you thinking of cutting out the beer...don't. Personally, I don't care for beer, but decided to use one and I'm glad I did! I chose Pacifico, the Mexican Pilsner-style beer.   And after 7 hours of impatient waiting in our aroma-filled home, we garnished it with tortilla chips, shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream. My husband wanted a little heat, so he sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes. That's it. Easy to make and eat!!!!  A new family favorite.

We all loved this soup: friends and family alike. Substitutions-
great northern beans because I was out of kidney beans,minced garlic for garlic powder if doing your own seasoning and everyone wanted to drink the beer and not cook with it, so we used chicken broth!

I made this last night for guests.  It was a great hit!  I didn't change anything except to add some heat with red pepper flakes and serve hot sauce on the side.  Also, I rinsed the black beans before adding, although the recipe didn't specify.  I used a crock pot liner so clean up was a breeze.  The chicken breasts were frozen when I put them in and after 5 hours, when I took them out, they just fell apart, making the shredding process easy peasy.  I will definitely keep this one and make again.  Less fussing in the kitchen means more quality time with my guests!  Thank you Patti, for a "keeper".

Made this on the stove top and it worked out great! Made a few adjustments though - used chicken broth instead of beer and used ground turkey instead of the chicken breast. Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe before and brought it to work for a pot luck.  I have already shared the recipe four times since the event.  Like other users, I use chicken broth rather than beer.  Freezes well, too!

Delicious soup with practically no effort! I used the taco seasoning the submitter suggested since I no longer buy the packets. I also used 2 large cans of chicken instead of the chicken breasts. This is an easy and forgiving recipe to make your own way with what's available.

I used this as a base because I had leftover shredded chicken. I am not a bean fan, and I made it in a pot. Yes, major changes but I'd say the flavor was very similar. I have saved this to do again. It had enough spice for me and not to much for the rest of the family. Everyone loved it and finished it. Which, is approval in my house!

My family are picky eaters--some don't even like chicken--but they loved this recipe! I made it exactly like it says--using Bill Echols Taco Seasoning and a Shinerbock Octoberfest beer! Making this a staple in our house. So easy and delicious! Thank you. With four kids, easy and yummy is king!

So this was very good, super easy, but it's spicy!  I was surprised at that.  Not sure what was the heavy spice as I use taco seasoning regularly and don't normally have that issue.  Next time I will dial down the seasoning just a bit.  Super good with a few crunched up tortilla chips, sour cream and sprinkled cheese.  Would be great for a pot luck or small gathering.

Made this without changes, the whole family loved it!  For leftovers, I added some chicken broth to make it "soupy" again.  Delicious!

Instead of chili beans I used Cannellini beans. I subbed the Taco seasoning mix for cumin, coriander, oregano, and sea salt.

Changed the recipe a little bit to use my faves. Used chicken broth instead of the beer, and used pinto beans and red kidney beans. Added a packet each of Sazón Goya and Goya chicken bouillon. Also added garlic powder and black pepper. Topped with sour cream, mexican mixed cheese, and green onions. It was amazing! Family loved it.

My husband and I love this one! I made it according to the recipe and it was really really good. I didn't have any fancy Mexican beer so I used whatever my husband had in the fridge and went for it. Despite it being Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat it complimented it well. I thought it would add an odd flavor but it didn't at all. I added some additional spices after tasting it like cumin and red pepper flakes. I topped it with cheese, avocado and cilantro. PERFECTION!

So easy! I didn't have all of the ingredients in the house so I just used the basics and what I had on hand, that's why I give this recipe 5 stars I feel like it's a perfect base.

I made it with a taco seasoning that was posted before and it came out FANTASTIC. Actually, I had made a similar recipe with ground beef - which was okay - but decided to use chicken instead the second time. And I substituted beer with chicken broth. It is so so so so GOOD - RaisinKane, come up with more of the same!

My husband loved this recipe ! Instead of chicken breast and beer, I used some chicken thighs and stock that I had made in the crock pot a couple of days before. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was fabulous! I will definitely make this again, it would be a great pot luck meal!

Love, love, love this recipe! I even made a mistake with the seasonings - was using 1/2 Tbs instead is 1/2 tsp. Just didn't put in as much spice blend (saved half for another time). Used Yuengling beer. Decided to cook up some Minute Rice - put a small scoop in each bowl then added the soup. Really tasty dinner! I think this recipe can be easily modified to suit taste/preferences. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe as written. Only thing I have to say is I tried making with the chicken and then ground beef and I don't think meat adds anything to it so I make this all of the time and omit any meat. Delicious everyone loves! Great for a large group and inexpensive as well!

My personal opinion is if you're going to make a recipe for the first time, always follow the directions to a tee, and make changes accordingly, or make notes for next time. But you'll never know what you truly think of it as long as you're fiddling with the recommendations. Now, if you have allergies or a devout disdain for any of the ingredients, that's all together another story---and change away! But all that to say, I followed this recipe as closely as I could, even following the suggested "taco seasoning" (even though I already had  my own prepackaged taco seasoning on hand), and it was delicious. And after eating it, I would honestly say that if I had used the taco seasoning that I had already on hand, it wouldn't have been nearly as good. I also used a 12 oz bottled Pacifico beer---cause it was the lightest and cheapest we had. Just follow the directions if you can, and it'll be a treat!

This is so delicious and easy!  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

I added garbanzo beans, chopped celery, and chopped carrots, as well as used fresh corn, because I had it in the fridge and seemed like it would all fit nicely.

Delicious!  I am so excited to have this on hand for the Fall/Winter.

Love this recipe. I do add a full container of chicken broth as I want it to have a soup consistency and found it too thick otherwise and a little too tomatoey Plus I usually have at least 3 or 4 teenagers to feed on any given evening and need to make it go farther. You can also make it hardier by topping it with cheese, taco chips and avocado so no need for it to be that thick. Delicious

Do not use 3 whole chicken breasts. That's gotta be a mistake. I used 4 chicken breasts (the halves, not full breasts) and I had to add more liquid. I used chicken broth instead of beer, and when I determined it wasn't "soupy" enough, k added extra chicken brother and a bottle of (uh oh, this is Canadian)... Mott's Caesar. It's a Clamato juice with vodka. Tomato based. Use Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe, but double it. Everything else I stuck to the recipe. Really great. Definitely top it of with sour cream, avocado, cheese, and tortilla strips!

This is a favorite at our house. I don't like tomatoes so I replace that with some smooth salsa instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it's delicious.

I Used tomatoes from my garden and added chopped zucchini the last 90min. I also only used 1/2 the beer and seasoned with chili powder, garlic salt, and onion powder cause I didn't have taco seasoning. I served it with mini cornbread muffins,  sour cream,  cheese,  and diced onion. It was really good!

This was terrific. The only changes I made was used broth instead of the  beer.  I also added a whole clove of garlic to the pot to simmer and I added roasted dry California chilies cut in  pieces to give it some earthy flavor. I even added some whole ones to let them give off flavor. Delicious.

I used Miller High Life, which probably wasn't the best choice for the beer, but it's what was on hand. Also, I cooked this exactly as directed for the exact amount of time, and the onion was still a little crunchy and very strongly flavored.

This recipe is amazing! It's quick, easy and tasty. The only changes I made were: I added a can of kidney beans, I use Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning (the recipe is on this site), I make sure to use Corona (I tried Miller Lite once, DON'T DO IT!), and I add a lime to it. I remove the lime once it's finished. Also, I use frozen chicken... It dries out less.

I doubled the beer (corona) and thought it still needed a bit more liquid, because I also doubled the beans! I used chili, black, and kidney beans. I used cumin, chili powder, crushed red pepper flakes, and fresh cilantro rather than taco seasoning. It turned out to be GREAT with the modifications. However, everyone in the house had some of the worst gas that will go down in history.

Well, this is a keeper! My two-year old really liked this soup, spices and all.  I took the original poster's advice and made used her taco seasoning (minus the 1 tbsp. of chili powder--didn't have any).  (1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper).  I also didn't have beer or the green chiles, so used chicken stock and omitted the chiles; we didn't miss them.  Recipe is very versatile and easy to adapt the canned ingredients to what you have on hand (I subbed kidney beans for black beans).  I also just made on the stove top instead of in the crock pot and it was lovely.

This is AMAZING!!! I just used a corona, it did the trick. I added a dry ranch packet- I'm no chef but it was suggested in a few reviews and it sounded good. I'm sure this would've been just as fantastic as-is too!

My family and friends love this soup. I make it for big family parties and it gets devoured. I usually add diced green chilies to it which adds a little kick. But it is good as is as well.

The beer makes a difference, so don't leave it out. I frequently just make this on the stove top and add in cooked chicken. I'm not sure what the slow cooker feature adds.

Let's start with the good news. I'm not a beer fan at all, but I didn't taste any beer at all (I used Killian's). The other good news is that I am the biggest weenie when it comes to spicy food, and I was able to eat this just fine. 

Now for the bad news. To be perfectly honest, I don't understand the five star ratings. I just made this tonight and I thought it was pretty bland.  I wonder, though if chicken broth would be better to give it more flavor. I'm not sure if I would ever make this again, but maybe I'd try chicken broth and I would add a lot more spices... not sure what spices, but it needs more. I was definitely underwhelmed. My boyfriend wanted to rate this three stars, and I wanted to rate it two... I'd give it two and a half stars.

I would make this again! My family loved it! I substituted kidney beans for the chili beans since I didn't want it to taste too much like chili. I also used Corona extra since that was the only single can of mexican beer I could find at the store (I didn't want to buy a whole case), and it gave the soup good flavor.

I didn't use beer, but that's only because I got home from the store to discover I was completely out. To make up for the lack of liquid, I didn't drain the corn. 

I enjoyed this soup without the crunch of tortilla chips, but the sour cream is a MUST. Boyfriend prefers without, though, so what do I know? 

Really delicious! Thanks for sharing!

this is a keeper . I use chicken broth instead of beer. I add 1 tsp cumin, chili powder & garlic powder. I use red kidney beans instead of black & chili beans. If I am not around I do the shredding of the chicken at the very end. the family loves it .

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice so far, the first time as written and the second time using half the amount of beer and substituting chicken broth for the other half.  Both were delicious. This is an easy, great tasting recipe and is great for the colder months.

Pretty good - did not stray from recipe, other than cooking it for 10-11 hours while i was at work.  Came out nice.  Used one can of Hot rotel and one of original rotel - if i were to do it again i would use both hot rotels.

I followed this recipe exactly. Used Modelo Especial as the beer (light Mexican beer), drained/rinsed both cans of beans, and used the Bill Echols taco seasoning. It had a great flavor with the perfect amount of spice! I'm from Texas, and this was as good as my favorite TexMex restaurant tortilla soup. I used three frozen chicken breasts, left it all in the crockpot for 8 hours on low and 1 hour on warm (waiting for guests to arrive). I shredded the chicken straight in the crockpot instead of dirtying another dish. I had avocado slices, pico de gallo (premade at HEB), chopped cilantro, tortilla chips, and shredded cheddar for guests to add as toppings. And last but certainly not least, I squeezed half of a key lime over each serving - really gives it a nice fresh zing! Definitely will make this again.

This was so easy and great on a cold day! It is very chunky like a chili but the sour cream makes it really delicious. We used a Mexican beer.

Great recipe.  Omitted the beer because I ran out of room in my slow cooker and I thought the taste was phenomenal.  The soup came out thicker and was more like a stew which was my preference.

I used the recipe as is. The only thing I changed was that I used ground beef instead of chicken. That is a personal preference. Red sauce = beef, white = chicken or pork but that is just me. 

So my picky teen ate two bowels full to the brim (mind you don't know where she puts it and there are no signs of her eating like this anywhere on her body). Husband also said he could eat this and chili in the same week the two were very different in taste for those that are wondering. I thought it was good. It reminded me of a spicy vegetable soup(not my favorite) but it had enough of a Mexican flare to be just enough different that I enjoyed it also.  I will make this when I am being pestered to make a "vegetable soup". Over all it is a good soup. I didn't think it was "lick the bowel" good but my family thought it was.  It makes a lot. I had left overs and enough to freeze for another meal. Fingers crossed that it freezes well. Also THE BEER IS A MUST IN THIS RECIPE. It does not taste the same without it.

Love love love this recipe!!!! First time I made it I followed directions exactly. I did find it was just a little too much chicken but still very very tasty. Now when I make it I use 2 whole chicken breasts (4 chicken breast halves) and I find that to be the perfect amount of chicken. Also - be sure to put avocado, cheese and sour cream on top. Amazing!!!!

I thought I had a really good chicken taco soup recipe...until I tried this one!  I was worried about not draining and rinsing the black beans because I've never had a recipe that didn't, but I didn't drain them and it was fine.  I didn't have any beer and substituted 12 oz chicken bullion.  I was out of tomato sauce and substituted a big squeeze of ketchup!  It was still delicious!  Really, from now on this is my go-to chicken taco soup recipe.  Best I've ever had.

Delicious!!!  I used chicken stock instead of beer.  For future recipes, I'll probably add more stock so I can have more liquid.  The veggies and chicken absorb a lot of the liquid, but this was a fantastic soup!

I left out the two cans of tomatoes with green chilies and added 1 can of green chilies.  We left out the onion.  I added 1/2 jar of the Walmart Great Value White Corn / Black Bean Salsa.  I used 1 tbsp. taco seasoning instead of the package.  Instead of chili beans, we used the Campbell's Roadhouse Chili Beef & Bean.  We added 1 c sour cream directly to the soup.  Very similar, just some slight modifications based on what we had on hand.

Excellent! I made this on Saturday as an easy meal that my husband & I could eat after a day of hunting.  It was so much better than I thought it would be and he loved it! I added garlic to the recipe which is the only change I made.  This will be a GREAT Game Day Soup! Thank you~

Made this and loved it! Here's the changes I did to the recipe:

Because I have teens in the house who pick out onions out of everything I make, I left the onion out of this recipe but added green onions as garnish at serving time.

I added two cans of corn instead of one.

I used 2 packets of Taco Seasoning Mix, 1 Chicken, 1 regular. 

At the last 30 minutes to go, I added 3/4 cup sour cream to the soup. This made it even more creamier.

I garnished with Sour cream, green onions, avocado, and crushed Tostitos Lime Flavored Tortilla Chips. Dash of Cholula or a squeeze of lime.

It was awesome.

It's amazing as is and still tastes great if you have to change the proportions up a bit to fit in your slow cooker. It is always a hit. I cook it on low all day and shred the chicken, stir, and serve when I get home from work. Thank you for the great recipe!

Ho Hum! :( I was unimpressed by this recipe. It had such great reviews I thought it couldn't fail. We only have Eldo-Paso Taco seasoning here in Australia so I am not sure if that was the reason. I have to agree with another review I read. It was like spicy minestrone with chicken in it. I also used Chicken stock instead of beer. I won't make it again.

Super easy and really flavorful. Whole family likes it. Avocado is  great addition! I use 5-8 boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.

This was really good. I used boneless chicken thighs because that is what I had and it was delicious. Just spicy enough. Easy to put together and I had all the ingredients. What more can you ask for!

This was a hit! Last year I made a massive amount of this for a Superbowl Party-2 large crockpots. One with onion and one without because someone was allergic. Both pots were empty by halftime and people were asking for the recipe. I didn't substitute anything else. I used red stripe beer in it and we had some happy campers.

I never rate anything that I make on here, but this was great! Only change I made was that I only used two chicken breasts instead of three... Otherwise made it exactly as written and it was perfect! I am from Louisiana where everything is spicy and heavily seasoned and was nervous that I would find this bland but it was very flavorful! Definitely a keeper!

This soup was super easy to make and SO good!!  I substituted a can of chicken stock for the beer; added a generous amount of cumin; a few dashes of Penzey's Chili Con Carne; and 2 garlic gloves.  It had the perfect amount of spice.  My fiancee normally adds Tabasco to soups but did not this time - yet it was not too spicy.  The chicken shredded perfectly after about 4 hours in the crockpot.  We topped it with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla strips.  Cornbread on the side.  Definitely a 5-star recipe!!

This is a great recipe!  I used lentils instead of chicken to make it vegetarian and also used vegetable broth instead of beer.  Delicious - can't wait to make it again!

Love this recipe!  It is perfect just as it is.  We used the extra spicy taco seasoning because we like the heat.  It is also good with ground beef, turkey, or without meat at all.

This was alright.  The chicken came out a little tough but I had to turn the pot down to "warm" for a few hours because I had to leave the house unexpectedly.  I would try this again just to see if the chicken comes out more tender following the directions exactly.  The soup itself is very flavorful and spicy and I like that.  If the chicken comes out more tender next time I'll update my rating.

I was a complete dope and forgot the taco seasoning, but it was still really good!  I didn't have 7 hours, so I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  For the beer, I used Negra Modelo, which is a dark, Mexican beer and I loved the result, so I don't know why people are saying to skip the beer.  Next time I make this, I'm going to actually remember to add the taco seasoning and cook this on low for 7 hours like the recipe suggests.  I suspect it'll be even tastier!

This is my "go to" recipe when I don't have a lot of time to spend hovering over the stove. I've served this soup to company and everyone raves about how good it is. The toppings (crushed tortilla chips, onions, cilantro, cheese, avocado) really kick it up a notch.

Nice, but seemed to lack something, may try again with lime and fresh cilantro. Cut back on the amount of chicken, there was way too much. I will only use 4 half breasts next time, or I'll use the extra for fajitas.

I have made this recipe twice now, and followed it primarily.  Yes, I have used beer and it was fantastic!  Don't use any of the lights or ridiculous beers, a good beer will work.  I added some cumin to it to give it that extra flavor, since we all like that taste.  I actually served this to a bunch of guys who were working in our yard one cool, crisp day and also just for us.  Freezes well in portions.

Very yummy recipe!  I used chicken broth in place of beer, like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I think next time I would make it with less chicken (I used 3 good sized chicken breasts) and add another can of beans or corns instead.

This is a favorite at our house. I usually make it just as directed, sometimes doubled to freeze some for future use. Economical, incredibly tasty, and forgiving of substitutions when necessary.

This has a very good flavor. It needs more juice though the little bit of liquid in the quickly burns off in the crock pot. Next time I make this i will add 3 to 4 cups of chicken broth.

I have another recipe just like this one but it replaces the tomato sauce with V8 or tomato juice. I use the low sodium store brand. I also replace the corn with hominy. Instead of diced tomatoes I just use a jar of my favorite salsa. Very good any way it is done. Haven't tried the beer and I add that to everything.

This was really good! I used a can of Yuengling and didn't care too much for the aroma as it was cooking, however the flavor of the final product after the sour cream, cheese and nachos were added was wonderful! Next time I will use a bottle of Corona to keep with the southwestern feel. I will definitely be making this again. It was good even with substituting of a can of tomato juice for the tomato paste.

Made this for my family and we loved this.  Used only one can of diced toms with chili's not everyone likes real hot foods - but it was great.  Gave recipe to all my friends.

This is a really easy to make recipe.  We tried it and found it to be really tasty.  We are going to add some chopped jalapeño peppers to it next time we eat the soup.  We would highly recommend this dish.

This is a delicious and easy recipe! I left out the chili beans, beer, and tomato sauce because I didn't have any, I added a cup of chicken broth. I also used frozen chicken breasts. I was worried there wouldn't be enough broth but it turned out perfect. Both my husband and I weren't sure if it was soup or chili, but it was hearty and spicy...perfect for a cold winter day. I loved the Bill Echols taco spice blend, hot and simple to make. I served this with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and crackers. I will definitely make again!

I was very excited to try this recipe tonight with all the great reviews I made. I followed the recipe for the most part and I put chicken broth instead of beer. I cooked mine on low for about 11hrs since I was at work. At first I tried it with shredded cheese and tortilla chips and I thought it was good but needed more flavor. Then I added sour cream and wow it made it taste so much better. My better half added the sour cream and crystals hot sauce to his and said it was really good. Now I have so much left over I'm thinking of making rice and adding it for another dinner night.

Everyone in the family loved this.  After reading other reviews I omitted the beer and used chicken broth instead.  So easy to make when you have a busy day.  Will make again.

I first made this for a Halloween party and I've made it over and over since! Ive been asked for the recipe several times. I love this recipe because it is so easy and it can be easily made gluten free. I use 2 pounds of chicken breast instead of 3 breasts because that can vary quite a bit with the giant chickens now. Use GF beer and McCormick's Taco seasoning because it is GF.

The hardest part of this recipe is shredding the chicken. This is where patience comes in because if you cook it all day on low, it is much easier to shred than if you try for high for 5 hours or so. 

I have made this once without beer because my dad didn't have any GF beer and while good, I think the beer gives it a richness in the broth that is otherwise missing.

The best soup!! I didn't have black beans so I used extra chili beans and it still tasted amazing. I'll definitely be making this again :) I also only used half a bottle of Sam Adams winter lager and I couldn't taste a difference.

I absolutely love this chili/soup!
I've made this about 5 times now and each time I've made it a little differently.
Here is what I have determined thus far:
I prefer either chicken broth or Hard Apple Cider such as Angry Orchard in place of the beer.
Also, don't be afraid to add chickpeas and all sorts of other beans to this recipe to make it more of a chili.
It's great spicy or medium!
I love adding avocados as a garnish/different texture.
Don't forget the tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese!

We loved this! I also substituted the beer for worchestire sauce (we dont drink alcohol). We put white rice in the bottom of our bowls first and added the soup/gumbo on top. I fried tortilla chips to garnish with the cheddar cheese and sour cream.

Super easy to make, and our whole family loved it.  It's definitely going in the regular dinner rotation.  (We were short on time so I made it on the stove top and used chicken tenders instead of full breasts, but I'm looking forward to putting it in the crock pot next time).  Thanks!

we had a chili day at work and decided to bring this...it was my first time trying out this recipe so I was a bit nervous how it would come out...OMG - amazing!! Everybody loved, loved, LOVED it!  Simple ingredients, hassle free cooking - what else could I ask for?! I have family flying in this weekend, so I'm making this again.  Only variation this time around will be to add chicken stock instead of the beer. :)

Awesome and EASY! Perfect for superbowl parties (I usually make this and a beef chili). I have been asked for  the recipe so many time! I add in a can of "chili starter" in place of the can of chili beans. Thanks for the recipe!

Like others have said, using a dark beer is important.  I used a Imperial Stout made with Ghost peppers and it was amazing with some sharp cheddar shredded over the top.

This is a delicious recipe.  I am making it for our christmas eve family get together.  I made one change by also adding a packet of dry ranch dressing.  It gives it a richer taste.

I tried this recipe this past weekend.  I gave it a four star because it was missing something. I did substitute the black beans for pinto beans,( my wife prefers pinto beans), and still something was missing.  I added chili sauce and it kick in the flavor. It was a good recipe and I might try it later.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit.  Not sure I'll use beer again...seemed like I could taste it or maybe I imagined it. Not too fond of beer.  But it was very good and the family loved it!

instead of Chili Beans (couldnt find) i used heinz baked beans, the sweetness made the soup have a depth of flavor i felt was lacking before. Before i added the beans it was spicy, period. seemed to be missing something, the beans sweetness complemented the heat and made it great. really enjoy with cheddar cheese and sour cream to top, in a bowl with a piece of homemade cornbread to soak up the juice.

Loved this soup. I made it on a cold winter night for my family and guest. They were all asking for the recipe at the end of the night. So easy, cheap to make and taste great. I used corona beer for the dish.

Made it just like the recipe said except I only had 2 chicken breast on hand. It was awesome will make again!!! I could not believe my 5 year old ate it! I told him he could just dip his bread in it and eat the chicken (so I could avoid the fight!) but he ate it all!

OMG!!!  OMG!!!!  Beyond amazing!  Used Corona Beer, added roasted garlic, and used Pheasant for the meat.  3 kids, and 3 adults, served with garlic bread, and we were all happy as a clam!  This will definitely be a keeper in our home!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe for my work chili cook-off. Despite the fact that my husband said it wasn't chili, I won first place!! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used chicken broth instead of beer and I used the Bill Echols seasoning recipe. Was a huge hit and I'll definitely make it again! Thanks!

Because we were living overseas and limited on available options, I have made this with pinto instead of chili beans and with just regular diced tomatoes. I always use Patti's posting for Bill Echols taco seasoning and all combinations have turned out great. I've tried a number of chili recipes from this site and from other friends and this one is by far the best!

Wonderful recipe! To save time, I use a store bought rotisserie chicken. Also, I like to crush some Tostitos Hint of Lime tortilla chips and stir them in right before serving. Yum!

This is delicious! You don't need the optional topping suggestions (cheese, sour cream, etc) because this soup is amazing as is. The *only* thing I added was 1 tsp sugar, and that was at the end of cooking. I tasted the soup, and it was good, but needed something to brighten up the tomato flavor. Super easy, super good, I will be making this often!

It was very good. Made it just like the receipe called for but the chicken broth instead of the beer.  I wanted a little more kick. But it was really good. I set it on low for 8 hours. I did add just a little more corn because of the sizes the cans came in. I will make this again!

This was Amazing!!! Such a good recipe! Was a little skeptical at first about making it all in a crock pot but it trned out great! My boyfriend and I ate soo much we could barely move. I just had my third day of it for lunch, still good :) It made enough that i was able to freeze some of it. Even though it was an amazing dish, im giving it 4 stars because it needed more a kick. Wasnt hot enough, and i think it makes a better dip (when you mix the sour cream and cheese) then a soup. Still good though, deff making it again!

Patti, this recipe is phenomenal! Quick, EASY, super flavorful!  My husband didn't add any spice to it, the kids loved it, if we all eat it, it's a HIT!  :) We cooked it 8.5 hours & the chicken couldn't have had more flavor, I could rave all day for your taco soup recipe!

So good! I let mine cook all day in the slow cooker (set on Low) while I was at work and the chicken came out wonderfully moist - not dry like some slower cooker chicken. Both of my kids enjoyed it too which is a huge bonus!

I didn't have exactly the right ingredients for this, but luckily it's very flexible - even to the extent of using plain ol' Miller Lite for the beer. I only used 1 can of tomatoes and about 1 pound of "Refried Beans Without The Refry" (recipe from this site) with the black beans. I made it today for dinner tomorrow, but know from my oh, so necessary testing that this is good already - I can hardly wait to heat it up tomorrow. It makes a bunch so we have some frozen for another day. Matching the soup with some sweet Texas cheese cornbread and guacamole and I'll be all that! Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

Delicious, hearty soup that warms you from the inside on a cool fall day. You can't beat how easy this is to make.  I made this exactly as is (and I often tweak recipes) and both the hubby and I were pleased with the end result.  I, personally, am not a beer drinker, but I added the beer as the recipe indicates.  I did not notice (nor did my husband) much of a beer flavor.  It seems to add an over all rich, background flavor, if anything.  I can't wait to make this, again and again.

Absolutely delicious...I was not expecting it to taste that good with such a low amount of ingredients and how easy it was. This tasted better than a lot of restaurants!

Super easy to make but taste odd.  Definitely need quite a bit of cheese and sour cream. I will not make this again.

The husband said it was the best soup I've ever made.  I used ground chix thighs (cheaper).  He bumped the kick up a little by adding diced jalapenos in his own bowl as not to out-heat the kids.

This recipe is amazing, especially considering the low amount of prep time. Made this for my wife and she hasn't stopped talking about how good it is. I recommend anything that gets me extra smiles and hugs at home. Try it yourself and enjoy!

Hubby and I both live this recipe! Confess that I didn't have all ingredients so I improvised crushed tomatoes for tomato sauce, coke for the beer, and added 1 1/2 cuos uncooked rice for filler so it goes further. Recommend adding a little water (maybe a cup or two) to compensate for the added rice. No doubt the original recipe is excellent also!

Delicious!  I used "lower sodium" taco seasoning and it was still perfectly yummy!!  Doubled the recipe for large crowd but it didn't fit in my 7 qt slow cooker!  So had to divide until it cooked down a bit then transferred to largest cooker. Will definitely make again. (and again!)

This recipe had an overpowering beer taste to me. To be fair, I did use an IPA which tends to have a strong hoppy flavor, so maybe using a lighter beer would produce better results.

I've made this twice.  Once with a bottle of Corona and once with chicken broth. I use Breast fillets and it's usually done around 4 hours on low.  Both times it came out delicious!!  I love that I usually have everything on hand.  And so easy to throw it together.  I top with cheddar cheese, sour cream and avocado!  YUM!
Thanks for a great one! It's a keeper!

I have made this recipe several times and it is so easy and delicious. The chicken ends up perfectly tender and shreds easily. I make my own taco seasoning (from AllRecipes.com of course!). The only part I keep experimenting with is how much beer to add. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too strong. I think the trick is to use a beer that you really like and since I'm not really a beer drinker it throws me off if I use too much. Last time I used about half the amount of beer and tasted the beer ahead of time to make sure I liked it and it turned out perfect.

The first time I made this, I used thighs instead of chicken breast thinking that dark meat cooks better in the crockpot.  It was good, but thigh meat doesn't shred the way breast meat does, so I was frustrated with it.  I made it a second time with chicken breasts and it was sooo much better!  At the time of this review, I've made this recipe several times as well as for my extended family once and everyone loved it.  I will definitely keep this as a staple in my stack of recipes!

I tried this recipe and it is superb. I substituted the tomatoes with half a jar each of left over black bean salsa from Kroger and Publix brand. I also used the El Paso taco seasoning and boneless chicken thighs. I also added a small can of green chillis.

Excellent fall dinner...I used boneless skinless thighs, with additional sprinklings of chili powder, paprika, cumin, & coriander. Prep time was 10-15 minutes, so a great meal to fix for company. Also, some of the tomatoes & beans I used were no salt added. And don't leave out the beer!

This was fantastic. To save time I didn't go the slow cooker method. I sautéed the onions then added everything to a pot. After letting it simmer for an episode of Parks and Rec I added leftover rotisserie chicken that I had shredded up. I let that simmer for another episode or two. Came out perfectly. I had added some extra spice to it and used another user's suggestion for taco seasoning from scratch.  I since then have been enjoying the leftovers.  Tonight I took the remaining leftovers and made a pan of makeshift enchiladas which are to die for.  Thanks!

I love this recipe! It's my "go to" recipe for busy days.  I have used any combination of beans I have in the pantry - it's always delicious.  If I have it in the pantry, I add an envelope of ranch dressing mix for extra flavor.

This is a great recipe! I usually don't review highly rated recipes because the ratings normally speak for themselves; however I felt the need to review this due to some of the remarks that I read. Many people stated that the beer took away from the recipe. In my opinion this is not at all the case! I actually don't care for beer at all and surprisingly could taste it in the soup, but I found it added a great bit of flavor to it. Maybe it's the type of beer you use...I used Heineken. I loved it! I also don't normally care for spicy things, but somehow with okay with the bit of kick that was added to this soup. I didn't alter the recipe at all, and I actually get the sour cream and cheddar cheese with cottage cheese. It probably sounds disgusting but believe me it was good. I will be making this again and again...

Made this for my somewhat picky-eater husband and after taking only one bite did he proclaim, "this is REALLY good". We topped our soup with only the shredded cheese and sour cream.  I will be adding this to my arsenal of crock pot soup recipes.

I followed the recipe using modelo for beer. I didnt use the taco seasoning, but followed the recipe given by the original creator. The soup is delicious except I think it needs more spice. I added more salt, which made a difference. The cheese does make the difference. I will definitely keep this recipe.

This has become one of our favorite recipes to make. We make this soup when we don't feel well or need a pick me upper. We do add 1 cup of fresh cilantro, 12 oz of hot sauce and cayenne pepper as needed just to give it an extra kick.

I substituted an extra can of diced tomatoes for the tomatoes with green chilis and just added extra chili flakes, chicken stock for the beer, 3 heaping tbsp of home made chili sesasoning and used two large chicken breasts which was plenty of chicken.  Deeeee-lish!

This was a hit for our family and I love how easy it is to make. 
I used Bud Light and it tasted great (not beer-y at all). I put  this together with frozen chicken breasts at 11 am and kept it cooking on high for 2 hours, then turned it to low before leaving the house. When we got home after our daughter's basketball game that night, it was fully cooked and scrumptious!
It was a tad on the spicy side for my 3 year old- but the Rotel I used must not have been mild and the chili beans may have been seasoned. 
This may become a regular meal for us....and I'm thinking about making it when we go camping. Thanks for the recipe!

Chicken cooked well this way, though.

We absolutely loved this recipe, (and I have the pickiest husband on the planet). We followed the original recipe, except we did not have Mexican beer. As a substitute, we used a porter (dark) beer, and it was fabulous. Wonderful flavors, has a nice kick, but not too hot. Bravo!

Amazing! I substituted chicken broth for the beer. I had to tweak the recipe somewhat to give it a little more flavor for my taste. In addition to the taco seasoning, I added a chili mix as well. I also added a dash of paprika to give it a little kick. Adding a little fresh cilantro on top makes all the difference in the world with this soup and helped it take to the next level!

This was delicious!  I used a Modelo beer, next time I may try a beer with more flavor and see how it changes things.  I also added an additional chicken breast and a can of chicken stock.  My enire family liked it!

I made this recipe for a meeting at work for 40! I pre-cooked the chicken and shredded it the night before. I was going to substitute chicken stock for the beer until the vegetarian in the group asked me to use vegetable stock, which I did. It turned out fantastic! I served it with shredded cheddar, sour cream and deep fried tortilla strips. Everyone raved about it and I had several requests for the recipe! I make this at home and keep it in my freezer for quick meals as well!!

We eat this all the time with a dollop of sour cream on top, and sprinkled with crushed tortillas - it's a meal, not a soup! Family favourite!!

Yummy and easy!  I used boneless skinless thighs, which shred nicely.  I left out the beer and added 3 fresh jalapenos and a chipotle pepper.  Leftovers could be used to fill tacos or enchiladas, or to serve over rice.  Will make often.  I like that it is low in calories too!

Excellent recipe. I use dried beans that I've soaked overnight; a mixture of black, red, and pinto. I don't have alcohol so I used chicken broth instead of beer. Afterwards when it was all done I love to add in lots of sour cream to make a delicious thick concoction for dipping nachos in. Even my toddler loves this!

I make this same recipe using a can of chicken broth in place of the beer.  And I always add a package of ranch dressing/dip mix...such a nice kick in flavor.  We have it at least once a week during the cooler months.  Absolutely love it!!!

Delicious and easy! And it is more like a chili than a soup so you really get your money's worth. I made this exactly according to directions and loved it. Gave it to a friend at work for lunch and she loved it and now makes it for her family. Her reason for thumbs up included that it is easy to "make your own" but subtracting and adding ingredients.

Delish! I ended up using white homeny instead of corn, no black beans and substituted beer for low sodium chicken broth.  I cooked it on the stovetop on simmer for about an hour. I cooked the chicken first and diced it up.  Great recipe! Thanks 'Raisinkane aka Patti'! I've been looking for a different kind of soup and its yummy with multigrain 'scoops' chips.

Tasty and easy to make, Didn't have the beer, so instead, I added chicken broth. Made my own taco seasoning. I added 2 large chicken breasts and that was more than enough.

This recipe is a great place to start for Taco Soup, but it is in need of some changes. The beer is a problem. I tested it out by putting a fourth of a cup in and it completely changed the flavor. It didn't not better it and I can imagine that putting the whole can would have killed it for me. The KEY INGREDIENT of this recipe IS the TACO SEASONING! If it's not flavorful enough, add more taco seasoning! This is not enchilada soup. Adding cumin and chili powder caused major problems for me. I ended up having to almost double up on ingredients. But the taco seasoning really is what makes it! Everything else is personal preference. Also, sauteing the onions in butter first and using tomato paste totally added some great flavor!

This is such a hearty and flavorful soup- no need to make anything else with it except for optional toppings.  I add all of the ingredients the night before and just pull it out of the fridge and turn on the crock pot in the morning. A big hit around my house!

This was SO yummy!  I did make a few changes based on the other people's suggestions. I used a can of chicken broth instead of the beer and used hot salsa instead of canned tomatoes and this turned out perfect! So easy to make and very filling.

O.M.G. - normally I dislike soup but this is my favorite.   Do not change anything about the recipe; however, I've also made it with chicken stock in place of the beer and it was equally good.  YUM !!

Yummy!  Just made a batch. Substituted canned corn for fresh corn off the cob. Still as tasty as I remembered.

This was a great BBQ party soup. Set out toppings and let people help themselves.

This is a ok recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it tasted more like a chicken chili but it was definitely interesting.  I think if it doesn't suit your taste buds it could be easily altered to fit your style.  I served it with fritos and chicken enchiladas. Not sure if it's a do over but it was good............

Perfect taco soup! I used a pale ale and could not taste the beer at all. Added a few sliced jalapenos for heat, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

tried this recipe but used chicken broth instead of the beer, tasted perfect!!  I used this recipe once before with the beer but the beer killed the flavors and taste of all the other ingredients in the soup... used fresh cut tomatoes instead of the canned ones...I did use all of the other ingredients as listed and it was delicious!!  Thank you!!

Excellent flavor and so easy to prepare.  I made a few changes to use up some leftovers.  I cut the corn off of two ears that were grilled previously and used up the rest of a roasted chicken.  I did use a dark beer and about a cup of chicken broth.  Cooked on low in the crockpot for 7 hours, topped each bowl with fresh slices of avocado, cheddar cheese and sour cream. So good, will make this again!

This recipe is amazing! Every time I make it, it is a big hit! The only thing that I added was a can of diced tomatoes not drained. I also did not drain the corn. So delicious! Thanks!

Made exactly as directed- used the homemade taco seasoning as suggested.  Dos Equis for the beer.  In addition to sour cream, cheese, and taco chips, also added some fresh avocado when serving.  Very nice dish.  It was spicy like I like it, but not too spicy for my 12 year old.

I made this according to directions and it was excellent! I added the chicken breasts frozen and let it slowly cook until my arrival from work, and it was so moist and juicy! A great dish that I'll make again and again!

Seriously best soup ever ..once I listened to a few reviewers. If you use beer and taco seasoning packets it's not really that great. If you use chicken broth for the beer and the homemade taco seasoning (Bill Echols Taco Seasoning) it's seriously the BOMB!

By far the BEST chicken chili I have ever had! If I don't have beer in the house I use chicken broth and it comes out just as good. I add another can of black beans too and we use Fritos instead of tortilla chips. Love, love, love!!

Love this chili recipe! Made a double batch of it again last night, and less than 24 hours later, it's all gone. My husband and two teenagers ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! We prefer the stove top method better than slow cooker, chicken stock instead of beer, and I made it with ground turkey and chicken, both great! Otherwise followed recipe to a tee.

This is just so, so GOOD!  I don't add the beer, but otherwise stick to the recipe as written and it is awesome!  Mine always comes out more like chili than soup.

Very simple and quick. I put everything in the slow cooker in the morning (5 min) and boom it was ready when I came back. We ate it with tortilla chips and sour cream and shredded cheese (put under broil) the first time and then with rice the next day.  Did not have the red beans but still good. Did not use the whole envelope of taco seasonning as it was a hot and spicy one.

This recipe was amazing! Very easy to make. I used non-alcoholic beer, and it worked just fine. Definitely will make this again. By the way, if you want to add more spice, use SPICY chili beans and SPICY black beans. Also, a bit of tabasco sauce heats it up. You don't even have to use beer.

I cooked this in the crockpot for about 10 hours or so. The taste was great and my husband and kids liked it. However, I needed to add 2 extra cans of broth before serving b/c there was so much chicken. I think next time I will use half the amount of chicken. I used 8 ozs of jarred tomato sauce I had left over.

Simple & Delicious!  When I asked my Mom if she thought it was good, she had already had 3 bowls and was asking me for the recipe so she could take it to her church luncheon.  
We'll definitely make this again!

I made this in the morning and left it for about 8 hours while I was at work.  Made minor substitutions - one large can of diced tomatoes (no chilis) and frozen corn. It turned out really good - but was more stew-like than a soup.  It made a large oval crock pot, Flavor was fantastic, I felt that the cilantro really made the dish.  Tasted really good the second day as well. Served with taco chips, shredded cheese and sour cream, everyone liked it!

Fantastic! Healthy, easy to make, and extremely tasty! What more could you ask for. However, I did add more spices (chili powder, pepper, and herbs de provence.) If you feel like your soup is "missing something," try adding more spice!

Incredible, simple favors that aren't too spicy. This eats more like a chili in my opinion. Very hearty. My one year old even loved it. Others were impressed with it..it looks and tastes like something you'd order at a higher end Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurant.

Very good! I didn't have beer so I used a can of chicken broth. Also made Bill Echols taco seasoning like suggested. Served over brown rice, with some shredded mexican cheese and a dollop of sour cream. It was very very yummy! Will definitely make again.

I have done this recipe several times now. It is one of my family favorite. I use chicken stock instead of beer. It is the only change I made, I serve it with shredded cheese, sour cream , cilantro and avocado on the side. It is easy to do, inexpensive and taste great. The perfect recipe!

Easy and very tasty. The only thing I don't add is the beer. I use Lawrey Taco Season Mix and that seems to work well. Every time I make it, it gets rave reviews. I am asked to bring it to pot lucks and work functions constantly. There are never any left overs, so that is always a good sign.

My whole family really likes this recipe, and it's really easy.  It is not too spicy at all if you ask me, but I think my kids prefer when I use just plain pinto beans instead of the chili beans... but really they enjoy it either way.

This soup was very tasty!!!  I did make some changes to make this more kid friendly.  I used one can of diced tomato with chilies, plus added an additional can of tomato sauce.  Since I only had an economy size bottle of taco seasoning I used about 1/4 cup more or less.  I cooked the soup on high for 5 hours then I took the chicken out but the soup was sort of missing something.  It was a bit spicy and just salty.  I added a some sugar to taste and it really brought the flavors of the soup together.  Then I added the shredded chicken back in and it was perfect.

I was looking for something to make for dinner and saw this, looked like something my family would enjoy.  I also liked the high ratings but after looking at the reviews am unsure.  I really don't know why people even rate a recipe at all if they didn't make it! Really? I think it's a five star only to find out you rated your own altered recipe! And if you gave the recipe 3 stars and didn't follow recipe thats not fair either! So please when rewiewing only submit it after you have made the Actual recipe, thanks. I will give 4 stars to be fair and I know I will like it, may not LOVE it, but I have to give something since I wrote this,then rate again after making the actual recipe.

Made this for my husband, and we both liked it, but it felt like something was missing. It wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping, even though we substituted the beer for a can of chicken broth and added in three cloves of garlic. I'll probably look for a different taco soup recipe that has more flavor.

Sorry but just not that crazy for it.  It was like a mexican chili because it was so thick and I didn't add the chicken. This would be good for putting over a Taco Salad meal (which I normally put chili on.  Edible but probably won't make again.

This recipe is amazing! I added a 1/4 of Coriander, and did the full amount of Cumin for extra kick. Finished the soup off with sour cream, avocado, Monterey Jack and tortilla strips.

Thank you for sharing your recipe and it was a hit since we had frigid temperatures this past weekend. My husband and I had 2 servings and wanted more soup :) I made a healthier version with no salt added canned goods and organic foods to it. Looking forward to tomorrow's dinner again :)

Great recipe!!  I've tried it with several types of beers and the best one is angry orchard hard apple - the Apple brings out the flavors well.  I also add some cayenne pepper to give it more kick.

Just made this today to go with our wings for our superbowl dinner.  Family loved it very much!  I did as suggested by many here:  I substituted low fat chicken broth for the beer (not beer drinkers here) and topped it with shredded sharp cheddar, broken up tortilla chips, fresh cilantro, and a dollop of low-fat sour cream.  SOOOO yummy.  We all loved it and this will be put in our meal rotation.

served it the first time to guests and they loved it.  It is a very hardy meal and requires no sides to be good but cornbread or garlic toast work well too.

I cooked the chicken and shredded it before adding it to the crockpot which worked better for me since i only had 3-4 hours to let it cook in the crockpot. Also added red pepper flakes cause we like things hot and subbed chicken stock for the beer since we don't drink. Overall, pretty good soup.

I made this recipe minus the beer and just added a little extra water.  This recipe is now one of my family's favorites.  Great flavor and so simple to make.

I enjoyed this recipe.  VERY simple to make.  However, it had very LITTLE broth, not to much of a SOUP.  I did make quesadillas with the left overs and the kids enjoyed them.
I will make this again however, I will cut the meat in half (maybe use dark meat) and double the remaining ingredients.

Made a few changes... no beer, used vegie stock instead. It came out great. You can decrease the amount of sodium by choosing low sodium canned beans and low sodium canned corn. We had it with corn chips, and my husband and I both really enjoyed it.

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it.  I made few changes to the recipe.  I used Bush's brand mild chili beans, 2 cans of mild Rotel, 2 cups (16oz) of frozen corn, and a Sam Adam's Boston Lager.  For the chicken breasts, I used 5 (2 lbs.) of Perdue's individually-wrapped chicken.  It turned out to be about the right amount of chicken for my preferences.  The only thing I noticed is it was still alittle spicy for my taste, but not mouth-burning.  I believe I will use one regular can of diced tomatoes next time to tone down the spice.  But it was delicious and I strongly recommend it with some crushed plain tortilla chips and grated cheddar, especially good for a cold winter day, or even a Superbowl party!

I just made this for my family. Wonderful. Did use Mexican beer and added chorizo. Decided to fry up a link of chorizo after taste testing the soup. It was good but we enjoyed the extra kick of the sausage.

Liked it very much. Used fire roasted diced tomatoes, but next time will try at least one can with green chiles. It could use the punch of heat, which I opted to avoid due to my children. Served it over mixture of brown and black rice. Very tasty!

Half way through the cooking process I tasted the soup, it was really spicy and tasted awful. Really bad aftertaste of the beer. I had to fix it. I removed as much of the juice as possible, about 4 cups. Replaced it with 4 cups of chicken broth and a can of cream of chicken soup. Then, I made some Spanish rice and added it to the meal. Served the soup with all the fixings and it was a hit! I definitely would NOT add in the beer next time and I would use half of the taco seasoning.

Easy and delicious.  I too went for the chicken broth instead of the beer. Mostly because I didn't want to buy beer. I received numerous compliments and requests for the recipe when I tool it into work for a potluck.  I used HOT taco seasoning and it was still pretty mild.  I am really glad I didn't use the mild or medium.

This is so quick and easy.  Healthy too.  I used low sodium taco mix, and it was just fine.  If you don't want to use the beer, use 2 cups of chicken broth. It makes a lot, so you can always freeze for another day.

YUM!!!  I used chicken broth instead of beer, only used 1/4 of an onion.  I did not have the canned tomatoes with green chili's   - so i used only one can of diced tomatoes (probably would not use two ever - one was enought) and then chopped up some jalapeno's.  Super zesty flavor - family loved it - and perfect for when you need to throw something together and have it ready when you get home - this is a keeper!!!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I didn't have beer, so I just left it out. Since we like food quite spicy, I also added an additional half a pack of taco seasoning (hot and spicy). This is hearty and excellent on a cold winter day. I had enough left over to eat it for a few days.

This was delicious!  My husband went back for a third bowl, and our daughter (a picky eater) loved it.  Followed the recipe mostly, even adding the optional items.  The only change was that I used one 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and cilantro and one 10 oz can of plain diced tomatoes (local store didn't have diced tomatoes with green chiles).  The only reason I used one can of plain tomatoes was so that it wouldn't overwhelm my daughter.  I also chopped up some cilantro to sprinkle over the top.  I think a little bit of sliced avocado would be great, too.  Will try adding that next time.

I have a celiac kid so I skipped the beer and just added water. Still came out amazing. Don't skip the sour cream and cheese it brings it to a whole other level.

Yummy, easy, can't go wrong!  I made it for Christmas lunch - a little unorthodox (pardon the pun) but it was a hit!  Rave reviews from family, and a number of second helpings were had. 

The onions didn't soften as much as I would have liked.  It's possible I chopped them too big.  Next time I would soften them stove-top or chop smaller, just to be sure.  

Our family likes spicy, so I used some chili powder and a little cayenne.  You could also add crushed chilis and/or garlic powder - to taste.  Really, you can't go wrong!

Absolutely wonderful on a cold winter's night.  Very easy to prepare and the whole house smells wonderful while it is cooking.  I used Mexican beer in the recipe.  This soup is not spicy at all so you may need to add extra seasonings if you like spicier, hotter foods.

Awesome!  Make sure to cook on low or the chicken will over cook and get tough.  My husband actually growled when eating this (I'm pretty sure that's a good thing), loved it!

This is a great convenient recipe and easy to double.  As a Texan I thought it  needeed more spice.  I upped the chili powder  and cumin about a Tbl.  I added  2 Tbls. cilantro last two hours.
Didnt have taco chips in house so broke up fritos in soup and it thickened the soup and added  great flavor.  Got lots of compliments.  Thanks for a keeper.

Great soup!  This is a regular at our house.  I will admidt, I have never made it using beer.  I am not a fan of beer, and having young children, just didn't seem like it would be a good ingredient choice for us :)  That being said, I substitute 32oz of chicken broth as we prefer soups with a higher liquid base.  Delish!

This soup is delicious!  I skipped on the chili beans and only used black beans and used Spicy V8 instead of tomato sauce. I also used a taco seasoning recipe I got from allrecipes.  The soup is very flavorful and hearty.

I had a soup "cook-off" at work today and chose this recipe because it looked easy and the ingredients sounded like they would mesh well together.  I tasted it when it was finished and it was a little bland so I added 2 gloves garlic, tablespoon of Louisiana hotsauce and tablespoon of lemon juice (would've used lime but didnt' have it).  It was a hit!  I won the soup cook-off. :-)

I liked this quite a bit but the indigestion factor is high on this soup. It is more like a chicken chili which is just too heavy for me. But the taste is great.

Made this yesterday and loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly - even using the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning that the author recommended. Yummy!  Hubby loved it, too.  Topped it off with some cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, and fresh avocados.  I used chicken breasts and they were delicious, but next time I might add mixed pieces, to get some dark meat flavor in there.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best tasting taco soup ever! I was not sure at first because there are alot of canned ingredients and its so easy to make...but it is a family favorite. I subsitituted the ber for vegetable brother and the chicken breast for chicken sausage - great!

Love this recipe!  I have made it many times and it always gets raves. Made a huge batch of it for a post trick-or-treating get together and it really hit the spot. It's perfect as is, only thing I do differently is cut the chicken into bite size pieces so I don't have to shred it later.  Thanks for this family favorite!

My family really liked this, but I it could be made in under an hour by cooking it on the stove. The canned items simply need to be warmed up, and the chicken can be simmered in water, shredded, and then added to the soup. Seven hours is simply way too much time for this recipe. Other than that, we loved it!

My family loved this!  I had to make a few modifications because of what I had on hand.  I drained and rinsed the chili and black beans, used frozen corn (about a can's worth), used 2 cans diced tomatoes without the chilies and then added a can of diced chilies.  I used 12 oz. chicken broth instead of the beer.


This was a last minute meal idea so I did not make it in the crockpot.  I cooked it on the stove top and from start to finish took a little less than 45 minutes.


I boiled the chicken in salted water until it was almost cooked through, then chopped it up and set it aside.  I sauteed the onions in a tablespoon of olive oil and once they were softened, I added the taco seasoning.  Once that was thoroughly combined, I added everything but the chicken and brought it to a boil.  Once boiling I added the chicken and returned to a boil then reduced the heat to a simmer.  I only had time to simmer 5 minutes before we ate it.  My kids topped theirs off with some crushed tortilla chips and my husband and I ate it without any additional toppings.  It tasted wonderful!!

Very nice recipe .Very simple to make . I really enjoyed the flavor . I would also recommend Old El paso brand taco seasoning mix . It was a hit hit with friends and family too. Now that i look back at the recipe , I think I should have added some fresh chopped cilantro near the last hour of the cooking process , just to add more punch. Oh by the way the beer is essential , I used a dark pale beer.

Overall, this recipe is really quick and easy. I am not a big fan of the beer....if I could do it again, I would leave out the beer and amp up the spices. It came out a little bland....add in some red or green peppers, too. Hubby really liked it...I was just happy it was edible :)

This is pretty good and it's easy to make. I have to say though that I forgot to add the tomatoes and green chiles and it was so much better with out. Perhaps it's the brand I used but it gave it an off flavor after I added it. I top mine with crunchy tortilla strips, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream.

Excellent and so easy, well like by all in the house. I forgot to add the beer, but was still great. I also cooked in a large pot on the stove vs slow cooker. Served over cooked white rice. This will be a regular for our family.

This was awesome!  I followed the recipe very closely with the following small changes: I used chicken broth rather than beer (we don't drink beer and don't use it in cooking) and added an additional can of diced tomatoes with chiles because my family loves tomatoes.  We also added shredded taco seasoned cheese when it was served and everyone absolutely LOVED it!  This is a recipe we will definitely make again!

Yikes!  My mouth was burning!  There was no warning how spicy it would be.  I toned it down with a ton of sugar, and then I could eat a little, but my mouth was still numb.

Super soup!  Substituted chicken broth for the beer and a big can of hominy instead of the corn.  Quite a hit.  Made a huge amount; am on Day 4 and it just tasted better every day.

This recipe is sooo easy to follow, and the result is delicious! To save calories, I swapped one cup of chicken broth for the beer. I put everything in the crock pot before bed, set it to seven hours, and shredded it when I woke up the next morning (probably about 9 hours later.) It turned out fantastic. It had just the right amount of spice. It does make a lot, so I froze some which I will use again for lunches in a week or two.

I LOVE this soup!  It has become a staple part of winter!  Its so easy to put together - I sometimes cheat and use rotisserie chicken, I double the recipe and cook it on the stove instead of the slow cooker, I add things that aren't in the recipe, I leave stuff out - and it is still ALWAYS a winner.  DH just finished the first bowl of a really BIG, slightly warmer than normal batch.  I made my own taco seasoning, and I think one of the cans of Rotel was 'hot' - so not sure which one is to blame for the extra heat.

Will have to saute the onions before adding to the soup, they were crunchy. I left out the corn as I'm allergic to grains - so it's gluten free! Yay! I used kidney beans and added a liberal shaking of garlic powder with homemade chicken broth, also. Hubby said, "Eh". He ate it, though. This is progress!

This turned out to be a one of the best soups that I have made. I will definitely be making this again. The only thing different that I did was use chicken broth instead of the beer and used four chicken breast (they where on the small side). It was even better once you top it with shredded cheese.

I substituted a couple things and it turned out to be one of the best soups I've ever had.  I used one soup size can of Rotel w/ habaneros (HOT) for tomatos and chilis, and some smoky chipotle paprika seasoning (2T and 1T of fajita seasoning) in lieu of the taco seasoning.  I also used about 8 oz of beer (chef's privilege on the remaining 4 oz!)  This is a layup crock pot recipe and I would have paid $5-6 for a bowl in a restaurant and been HAPPY about it.

I made this yesterday for myself and some coworkers for lunch. One hates beans and despite that she nearly licked the bowl clean it was so good. My changes were chicken broth subbed for beer, only used half a packet of taco seasoning because that's all I had, and frozen corn instead of canned because that's what I had on hand. My chicken breasts were frozen, so I had to cook this longer than the posted time, more like 10 hours. I served this with light sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar cheese toppings and it was truly delicious.

WOW! But this is what I did different...instead of the tomato sauce, I used a can of Rotel Mexican(lime and cilantro). The chili beans I used were spicy. The 3 skinless, boneless breasts weighed in at a little over 2lbs. I also added a tsp of smoked chipotle pepper (a personal fave!), along with a tsp or so of salt, a half tsp of smoked cumin, and about a tbsp of garlic powder-NOT garlic salt; it's a big difference! My soup turned out amazing! The heat was medium for us, so maybe omit the chipotle pepper if you're not a fan of heat. But definitely add the cumin! It's a perfect addition for anything Mexican, but doesn't add the heat. YUM!!

I fixed this tonight and tripled the recipe because I was feeding a lot of people.  The only thing I did different is that I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because they are more tender.  EVERYONE loved this soup.  The kids loved it, the adults loved it and it was soooo easy!  We garnished with avocados, cilantro, and cheese.  It was so DELICIOUS!  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I did end up adding some salt, chili powder & chipolte - but that's to my taste.  I also didn't read it correctly and only had one can of tomatoes w/chilies so I added another can of diced tomatoes and chopped up a canned green chili to add.  I hate reading where people "added this and lessened that" to the point where it's no longer the same recipe but what I changed was just tweaking to my own taste buds.  The soup is very tasty - especially with some freshly grated cheddar on top!

I haven't tried this yet and was wondering if I could substitute chicken broth for the beer.  I don't drink beer nor do I cook with it. Would the broth be a safe sub for the beer?

A solid recipe.  Just doctored it a little bit with some more chili pepper and cumin (just personal preference).    Will definitely be a repeat in our house.

Very easy and pretty tasty.  This is a simple recipe to prepare because all of the ingredients are ones I always have on hand!  The soup definitely needed more seasoning,though.  I added cumin, southwest essence, salt and hot mexican chili powder.  Used semi-frozen chix thighs,and it was ready in 5 1/2 hours in my crockpot!

Amazingly good. I made it exactly as written. I do note that "three whole boneless chicken breasts" equals SIX chicken cutlets, so that's what I used, which was perfect. Chock full of tender chicken. Yum!

This is so good. I don't like spicy so I added only 1 can of diced tomoatos with green chili's and a plain can. It's the perfect amount of just a hint of spice.  The beer actually is what makes this soup so good. Will be making this again.

Very tasty! Not a beer fan so I added a half bottle of beer and half can of chicken broth. I also added a can of kidney beans but only because I had them, next time Ill leave them out as it was to thick with not enough liquid.

This soup was delicious! It is kind of like combining chili and chicken tortilla soup. It is a tad spicy, but I followed the ingredients list exactly and wouldn't change that. I accidentally put it on high for the first 2 or so hours, so I knocked an hour off of the cook time and it was fine. Make sure to have a large crock pot, because it will be needed. It will cook down, but a large one is needed at first to hold all of the ingredients. The sour cream, cheese, and chips to top, as suggested, worked perfect. ty

Yum! Made it two ways: one, vegetarian and one with chicken.  Both were devoured by my crowd to rave reviews.  I did 1 1/2 times the recipe, and it fed just 10 women - one serving each, so keep that in mind if you have big eaters.  I also used Trader Joe's frozen grilled corn in lieu of the canned corn, and that added a nice flavor.  I put fresh avocado chunks out for garnish, too!

Excellent soup and so easy to make. I had to speed up the cooking process so I baked and shredded the chicken and added it to the soup. I put the slow cooker on high for five hours and it turned out delicious.

Absolutely delicious. I used 2 frozen chicken breasts and just plopped them on top. I cooked them for the full 7 hours before shredding the chicken with a fork. I also used a can of black beans with jalapenos and a can of pinto beans instead of the chili beans. I will definitely make this again.

Sooooo easy and delicious! I made it in a hurry and didn't read how much tomato sauce you were supposed to put in until after I dumped the 15oz can in... I decided to cut back on the chicken broth (which I used instead of beer) to compensate for the extra liquid. I also didn't have as much time as it suggested for cooking, so I put in on high for 4 hours and left the chicken in the whole time. I used McCormick's Chicken Taco Seasoning, and topped with sour cream and chips. I remembered while taking my last bite that I was going to add cheese - it didn't need it (and neither does my waist)! Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper and I'll definitely make it again! (Maybe I'll even make it the right way next time)   :)

Another great recipe on allrecipes!
Made this using the Taco Seasoning I recipe and it was delicious.
I did substitute the beer for the chicken broth and I used Rotel Original for the tomatoes with chilis.
I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for the meat...it made it to number 3 in my husbands all time favourite home cooked meals in its first ever appearance on our table...now that's good!

Easy and delicious! I'm kind of a spice wimp. So I used mild Rotel and the level of spice was perfect for me! I actually could have used the regular, I think. My 6 year old actually put everything in the crock pot! She loved when I told everyone that she made dinner!

This is my go-to crock pot recipe. I am gluten intolerant and was able to find a gluten free beer to use in this recipe. Chicken broth works in a pinch, but beer definitely gives the soup more flavor.

Turned out great! Everyone loved it and somehow mine made way more than 8 servings. I'll be eating taco soup all week now. I used the Bill Echols Taco Season recipe as recommended but didn't have cumin and added a little cayenne. I accidentally misread and put a can of vegetarian chili instead of chili beans. WHOOPS! Once I realized that, I only used one can of diced tomato w/green chills and added about 8-12 oz of water in addition to the beer (fat tire) since I thought the chili would add a lot of flavor and salt. I'm not sure how much chicken I used because I could only find thinly sliced chicken breast. It may have been equivalent to 4 breasts in the end. Turned out PERFECT and I don't even regret the chili mistake!

This was great!! I did drain the black beans a little bit and I used a little too much beer.  I do not drink beer, so I went to the store and all they had were 24 oz. cans, so I had to estimate.  It was still good, there was just a hint of a beer smell in the air.  Husband LOVED it!! I will make this again!

I make this ALL the time! It is so delicious and everyone literally raves about it and if something needs to be cooked, they want me to cook this! However, I do make ONE change. Take out the beer, add a chicken boulion packet and about 1/2 cup of water. Lower calories and just tastes WAY better!!

Would give it 3 1/2 stars.  Was good but not the best I've ever had.  Would make again.  I doubled the recipe so unfortunetely it wouldnt fit in my crockpot then so I made on the stove.  Put it all in, brought to a boil, then turned dwn on 1.6 for about 5 hours.  Added can of cream of chicken....used bill echols seasoning instead of package...2 cans of rotel and then a large can of tomatoes.

This was so easy to put together.  I substituted chicken stock for the beer (did not have any!). Once it was topped with the shredded cheese and sour cream, it was delicious!  It makes a good amount, so it would be great to freeze half of it.  Will definitely make again!

This is so easy and a great weekend meal. My family loves it and its great when watching the football games. One time I didn't have beer so I subbed a can of chicken broth and it was still great.

Excellent.  I like to make things as written first, since that is the only fair way to rate a recipe, but I only had "hot" chili beans, rather than regular.  This made the soup a little too spicy for our children but the sour cream took the edge off.  Next time, I'll be sure to use regular chili beans.  If needed, I may substitute one can of tomatoes for the tomatoes with chiles but we'll try one step at a time.  The soup got a little hotter the next day.  Still - excellent flavor and sooooo easy!

Other modification suggestions: Add beer, chicken, AND vegetable broth to make it more soupy and add even more flavors (more vegetable than chicken as the chicken creates some of its own). Instead of just chicken breast, we used chicken thighs as well to have a mix of white and dark meat. I like yellow squash in my tortilla soup so we sliced some and added it about 2 hours before serving so that it wouldn't be too mushy. Also, instead of garlic powder as others have suggested, we added 6 whole cloves of garlic that soaked up all the juice while adding their own flavor to the soup. Cilantro is a must.

Great recipe.  Skipped the beer and used chicken broth instead and added a cup of salsa instead of one of the cups of tomatoes.  It is really important to shred the chicken for this recipe.   The taste completely changes if you don't.

Thanks to hurricane Sandy, our Halloween turned cold and rainy.  I wanted a slow cooker recipe that I could start in the morning so I wouldn't have to fuss with dinner while passing out candy.  This recipe was fantastic.  It's a keeper.  I brought left overs to work the next day and shared with a coworker - she also loved it.  I used all of the ingrediants listed but did add some diced jalapenos for extra zing and I used a regular taco seasoning packet. I will be making this again!

I love this recipe and have made it a couple of times....the first time I made it I didn't have tomato sauce so I used 1/2 cup non-alcoholic bloody mary mix and only 1/2 of can of beer....it's now the way I make it. It added a bit more spice. I also used a fresh jalepeno instead of canned green chilies

We nearly killed our taste buds! Next time I am definitely using regular canned tomatoes (vs with chiles). I used Trader Joes taco seasoning. Our kids (5&7) couldn't take the heat, but DH and I kept testing with sour cream/milk/cheese to try and cut the spice. Didn't work...but the fact that we tried so hard to make it work says a lot. Bottom line...crazy spicy, but super yummy!

I made this for a church supper.  Doubled it because we needed more.  Very little of it came home.  (Note: the alcohol in the beer boils off.  I'm a non-beer drinker and just noticed that the broth was a little richer.)  On the other hand, finding just one bottle of beer is difficult.

This soup has only a few ingredients but so tasty. I only use half the amount of cream cheese so the squash flavor isn't overpowered by the cream cheese. I use a stick hand blender rather than a regular blender. I always manage to burn myself when I use the blender on hot ingredients. On occasion I add a little curry for a different zing. This is a recipe that I use every fall.

I made this exactly as written. It was very flavorful and filling. I was trying to make it as a family meal that would have leftovers (makes a lot), but as I was adding the beer, I realized it wasn't gluten free which one member of our family requires. Has anyone tried a GF beer for this? I will definitely be trying this myself next time.

I used taco bell taco seasoning and red stripe beer. I thought it turned out great. I was expecting more of a taco taste but really tasted like a good chicken chili. Could not detect any beer flavor!

Love this recipe! I was a little wary of the beer, but it added a lovely aroma and taste. I used Sam Adams Light to try to cut back on the calories a bit and because we're watching our sodium intake, I added frozen instead of canned corn, used no-salt-added tomato sauce and diced tomatoes (plain, I added a separate can of green chilis instead), and used previously cooked dried beans in favor of canned. The only downside is that after the first night, most of the liquid was gone (and my attempts to make more resulted in sub-par leftovers). Next time, I'm going to double the liquid. I like my soup to be soupy, not chili/stew-like.

This recipe was fantastic!   The beer added great flavor along with a dash of cumin and I sprinkled dry cilantro over the top before cooking. Before adding it to the crockpot, I cooked the onion in oil until the edges were brown.  I sliced the chicken breast into strips and browned it oil and seasoned it with Adobo seasoning (without pepper).    The flavors complimented each other.  A keeper for sure!

This is a go-to winter meal in our house. I usually skip the beer and tomato sauce but always add a 1/2 to full can of chipotle peppers (depending on if you want it warm or to actually make you sweat). With this addition, the sour cream and cheese on top aren't optional as you need the creaminess to balance out the spice.

This soup turned out great! My husband had two bowls. I followed the directions with two (small) changes: #1 I only used ONE can of the diced tomatoes w/green chilies (which is PLENTY believe me,) and #2 instead of using chicken BREASTS, I used chicken TENDERS (because I already had some thawed.) I cooked it on HIGH for 4 hours and it was perfect. The tenders quicked much faster than the breasts. I will definitely make this again it was so easy!

Really good, easy to make, and a great meal-in-one for any cold-weather family supper or friendly occasion/get-together.

This was so easy and with a little extra spices very good! My husband is chef and I can never make anything that he deems good EXCEPT this went over well. I added a jalepeno, garlic powder and little salt and it we perfect. Thank you for the recipe, I will be making this again!

Everyone I know that has tried this soup LOVES it!  NOT only that, but I go into restaurants and try their chicken Tortilla soup, and there has not been one that compares to this.  Make it, you will love it!

This was super easy, and so good! I modified it a little though.  I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste.  Nor did I have beer, so I used a carton of chicken stock. I also don't but taco seasoning (I make my own), and I added a bunch of crushed red pepper to make it hot.  It was amazing, and I will definitely be making this again!

I first made this for my other half , who honestly, was less than eager to try it. After he had munched his way through 3 bowls, it was safe to assume we had a winner. I have since prepared it for group events, family get-togethers and pot lucks and it is always popular, the recipe requested over and over. The first time I prepared as per the recipe but ever since I have made my personal version, as follows:
I use a British wheat beer, tomato paste as opposed to tomato sauce, frozen corn instead of tinned and added an extra breast. I also cook on low for at least eight hours and use a fork to start pulling the meat apart after about 6 hours without removing it from the slow cooker, it really falls apart by itself. Very nice!

I made this recipe with a little added cumin and 2 Tbs of homemade taco seasoning in addition to the taco seasoning packet and one can of tomatoes with jalapenos.  It turned out really good.  I was hesitant on the beer, but I used a bottle of light Corona.  My very picky twelve, ten, and six year old who won't touch beans came back for seconds.  My husband rarely tries something new, but... well, he ate way too much.  Will definitely make again!

This is the best recipe I have found for Chicken Taco Soup- and so easy!!  As most other reviewers, I too did not use Beer, and instead used 1 can of cream of chicken, and 1/2 can chicken broth.  Also added a tsp or two of chili powder & extra garlic.  I will be making this again for sure!

I just made this dish Fri. night and it has been a hit with my friends and family. I think the only addition I will make the next time is to add a little cumin seasoning to the ingredient list. This will definitely be a repeat dish this fall/winter season!

Very good my family loved it. I used rotel for the tomatoes with green chilies and Picante sauce for the tomatoe sauce. Tastes like tortilla soup almost minus the hominy.

Loved it!  Just the right spice. D-lish. Easy too.  the hardest part, if any of this recipe will be shredding up the chicken.  That's it.  Really simple.

Pretty good. I had to use chicken broth instead of beer because I was afraid of the weird taste people were talking about.
Next time I might cut back to two chicken breasts, because this really was a lot of chicken even though the breasts I used weren't huge.

THIS WAS DELISH!! I made this when I had an empty fridge & needed dinner. All I had were dried beans (black, small white & great northern) & frozen homemade chicken broth, which already had shredded chicken in it. I didn't use a slow cooker just simmered everything on the stove. Followed recipe, but excluded beer & chili beans. Didn't have diced tomato, so cut up a few grape tomato stragglers I had & added some sliced pimientos for color/texture.  Added crushed garlic and followed poster's recipe for taco seasoning which was PERFECT! I'm keeping that for ALL future taco/mexican dishes. I also didn't have tortilla chips so I baked some cut up corn tortillas that were coated w/olive oil.  Luckily, I had some left over sour cream..that just brought it all together!  This will surely be a dish I crave and our new regular soup dish for my family! Thank you.

JUST MADE THIS LAST NIGHT & IT TURNED OUT VERY GOOD.  IN MY EYES, IT WAS CHILI, WITH CHICKEN.  IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A HEALTHY VERSION, I RECOMMEND LEAVING OUT THE TACO SEASONING (ENORMOUS SODIUM), & ADDING YOUR OWN SEASONINGS. THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE PRETTY HEALTHY. I ALSO OPTED FOR THE BUSH CHILI BEANS. I ADDED A CAN OF MILD & A CAN OF MEDIUM. HAD A SLIGHT KICK TO IT, SO ADJUST ACCORDING TO YOUR TASTES. OVERALL, I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!

Great recipe! I made a few changes based on previous reviews & personal preference... Left out the chili beans (the 1 can of black beans was enough for us), added minced garlic, a pack of ranch dressing mix, used a Corona for the beer, and in addition to the beer I also added homemade chicken broth since we wanted a soup, not a chili. I used 2 big chicken breasts which was plenty. Also to make it more kid friendly for my little ones, I used a pack of mild taco seasoning mix as well as mild Rotel tomatoes.

I love, love, love this soup! It makes frequent appearances at our dinner table. My personal preference is to use chicken broth in place of the beer. Other than that, I make it as directed and it is delicious. Perfect for a cold day!

I made this for a staff lunch and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and made the following small changes:
Used 1/2 beer and 1/2 chicken broth for liquid;
used Trader Joe's fired roasted corn, frozen instead of canned corn;
added 1 T chopped garlic and 1 tsp. smoked paprika.
For toppings, I added diced avocado and cilantro to the mexican cheese and sour cream.
Delicious!

This soup is absolutely delicious. My boyfriend loves it as a main dish because it's quite filling. With some sour cream and tortilla chips, nothing can be beat! Didn't change a thing on the recipe.

I used 28 oz can crushed tomatoes.  3 large chicken breast halves, capful of Costco taco seasoning.  small can mild green chiles.  Not too spicy but I added salsa to mine, Robert didn't.  I just shredded the chicken with a fork and knife - so tender!

Love this recipe! I never rate anything, ever... but this deserves it! I finally found a recipe my husband loves (he's very picky about good food).  I doubled the recipe and as I placed one ingredient in the crockpot, I placed the other in a gallon freezer bag to store for a busy work week. I used Oktoberfest beer- yum!

With some modifications, it was very good.  Added a dash of cayenne pepper, a can of chicken broth to thin the tomato, added a tsp of minced garlic, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/2 c chopped green pepper, bay leaf and used frozen corn rather than canned.  Will make it again, but with my changes!  Best steeped at least overnight!  Cooked mine all night & simmered all day.  It was better in the evening!

Used chicken broth instead of beer. Turned out great. 3 breasts provided more than enough meat. Rotel diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro gave it a nice bit of flavor.

My husband and I thought we could enhance it by adding Hooper Hash along the crushed tomatoes. Can't wait to enjoy this for dinner this weekend.

YUMMY and EASY!!!  Made this in the lounge at my school at 7:30 a.m. and it was all ready to go for lunch at 12:30.  I did cook the chicken breasts the night before and just added the shredded chicken with the other ingredients.  SUPER easy and loved by all the other teachers.  I also offered fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheddar cheese, crunched up fritos and sliced green onions to top it all off.  Low in calories, high in flavor.  One additional note...I did not use beer.  I threw in one can of chicken broth, instead of the beer.

Wonderful flavor!  I loved it and so did my family, it's a great, simple put together recipe.  I actually used chicken tenderloins (I added more than what this recipe called for) and diced/shredded them, but I think that the original amount would still be great....there was A LOT of chicken in mine and not much broth. Thumbs UP!  Thanks!

Also, the reason I added more chicken is because I do not like beans, at all....

This was great! The only thing I changed was to add some salsa seasoning to give it a little more kick, but otherwise this was a really really good recipe-and a requested repeat!

This was just ok when I ate it on the first day.  I added more salt and chili powder because it was pretty bland.  After letting it sit for a day in the fridge it was quite a bit better.  I'll probably make it again but would add fresh hot peppers and a few extra spices.

This turned out REALLY good.  There's a ton of servings leftover if you're only cooking for 2.  My fiance loved it.  He's not a fan of beer, but he didn't mind it so much in this recipe.  I think next time, I'll cook it without the beer and see if he likes it even better.

This was delicious! Super easy to make.  My family loved it.  My girls even ate the tomatoes, which says alot.  It's really more like a chili than a soup.  This has been added as my staple recipes that I will use for pot lucks and visitors.

This was delish! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used frozen corn). I used Blue Moon Summer Wheat for the beer and there was no funny or bitter taste. I also used the recipe for taco seasoning by Patti (in the top review). I mixed all ingredients and put my frozen chicken breast on top and cooked on low for 8 hours. Took the chicken out and shredded it and mixed back in for 2 more hours. Served with Mexican shredded cheese and sour cream. It was a huge hit. So easy. Will make often.

This is my favorite recipe on the entire site. I like to add a splash of lime juice to my soup/chili and use the chips to scoop it up. Great protein count for after my workouts.

This soup was amazing!  I used water instead of beer because beer doesn't stay in our fridge long and when I went to make the soup, we were out of beer! I also was going to put frozen corn in but forgot and the corn dethawed on the counter.  STILL AMAZING SOUP!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

this taco soup is amazing, and my 3 teens and husband raved about it, i added 2 cans of chopped tomatoes, and one can of green chiles in the place of the 2 10 0z. cans of tomatoes with green chiles.
i will make this often and today is 108 out and we just let it cool down first. top with crushed chips and cheese. i'd walk a mile for a bowl of this.

Made this today - used water instead of beer and instead had the beer with dinner ;) Also used skinless on the bone chicken thighs (5), which I find more flavorful as well as being cheaper. I also used Trader Joe's Taco Seasoning as I didn't have time to mix my own before work.  

When making again, I will use the custom taco seasoning recipe (and make extra to have on hand) and top with cilantro.  VERY easy and quick to put together and is forgiving of modifications to the recipe.

Delicious!!! Because I ddn't have corn, I used hominy. I think when I make it again, I will stick to the hominy.  I also used tortilla strips I found at our local grocery store.  You can buy them in plain OR lime flavor, which is very good in the soup as well.  We like both.  I strongly urge anyone that likes soup to definitely make this one.  I will make it again, and again, and again...

Great! I made this today- it's super easy to throw together and forget about. I didn't have as much time so I cooked it on high, and left out the chili beans since I didn't have any. I'm really full now but I want to eat more, it was that good!

Great recipe! I love that there is no prep work required other than a bit of slicing. I added quite a few fresh peppers and used chicken broth instead of beer, only because that is what I had in the fridge. I also used my own taco seasoning blend instead of store bought (so easy to make in bulk and so much better). It wasn't necessary to remove the chicken to cut up; it flaked apart easily with a little help from a fork. This recipe is a keeper.

Wow!  We loved this soup/chili.  I used an additional chicken breast because I like alot of meat, but it probably didn't need it.  This is crazy good and very easy to prepare.

Loved it!  Kirk

This was sort of "Eh" to me. I ate a few bowls, over the course of as many days, but I didn't crave it. The beer flavor added an odd "twang" to me, and I LOVE beer in most foods. I used the recipe for homemade Taco Seasoning, and it almost overpowered any of the ingredients in the soup. That could have been the chile powder used however, so I won't fault the recipe for that. Still, this soup didn't really "mesh" to me.

I made the recipe following everything as-written, except that we had no chicken--so I threw in a pound of ground beef.  It turned out great -- flavorful enough to be interesting, but not so spicy that we couldn't eat it.  We will definitely make this again!

I replaced the beer w/ chicken broth, used Ortega's Taco seasoning, frozen chicken breast, organtic veggies, made it 3 days ago, refrigerated it and reheated it and had it for dinner last night.  My family of 6 ate it all gone!

Wow! What great flavor! I have made many taco soups and this is by far the most flavorful...thanks in a large part to the beer. It certainly "makes" this soup and gives it a more complex taste. I used the cheapest beer I could buy at Aldi since "beer is beer" to me! I cooked it for 8 or so hours overnight, the chicken shredded with very little effort, and it was gobbled all up at our church soup luncheon! Thanks for a great recipe!

this was surprisingly excellent! Im not a fan of any of the taco soups. this however made everyone happy in my family (that is rare in itself) I did add extra small can of mild green chiles .. and frozen sweet corn. Im not one for canned veggies except for beans.. I let it cook for about 13hrs.. i know.. overkill but was amazing. we served it topped with shredded cheddar and some authentic tortilla chips.. mmm..

The best part about this soup is the ease of preparation, with everyday ingredients found in the fridge and pantry. The only alterations I made were to substitute 1/2 cup of salsa for the tomato sauce, couple of bay leaves, and red pepper flakes for some heat.  I used a bottle of dark stout, which I thought added that extra richness and color to the soup. We enjoyed it very much!

Great recipe. Did not use the beer but instead used one can of chicken broth. My family likes lots of seasoning so I used 2 packets of taco seasoning mix. It was delicious. Will make this again very soon.

Just tried this and it's easy and delicious. I couldn't find 10 oz cans of diced tomatoes, so I added two 14.5 oz cans. Only modification was adding a little Adobo seasoning. Added the dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese and torilla strips, and everyone loved it. Also made enoudh for more meals. Great recipe!

We used broth instead of beer (not beer drinkers) and tomatoes without the chilies (we have young children that don't do well with chilies), otherwise we followed the recipe.  This was very good served over some orzo pasta

I used Yuengling lager and packaged taco seasoning. I also added 1 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 TBSP. cocoa powder. I used one can of mild Ro-Tel and one can of original Ro-Tel.I made it on the stovetop because my husband left our crock pot at work. After tasting, I opted to add a packet of ranch seasoning. It is delicious!

This was a hit with my family!  I didn't have enough time to do this in the crockpot, so I altered it to a stovetop version.  I included all the ingredients except the chicken and simmered for about an hour.  Also, since I didn't have rotel, I substituted a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chopped green chilies.  About 15 minutes before serving, I added precooked shredded chicken.  This was so flavorfull and not too spicy for my young children.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe and makes a good amount to serve with friends.  Really easy to put together in the morning and then is ready when you get home.  I have used Frozen chicken breast so I cooked it longer.  Everyone has loved it.

Switch the chicken for beef and this is a old weight watchers recipe. Although, i cook it on the stove top since the veggies are already cooked. I just cook and drain the beef first. It has been a family fav for more than 10 years. I will have to try the chicken someday.

I used 1 14.5 oz can of tomatoes with chilis and 4 oz can of diced chilies and a 1.25 oz package of low sodium spicy chili seasoning. It was really easy and really good. Almost better the second day

So good on a cold night and so easy! This is a very good alternate to the Taco soup recipe that uses ground beef. The seasoned chicken really makes it good. I substituted white shoepeg corn for yellow whole kernal corn and like that very much.

Very good. The beer makes it great. I was using heineken, now I use 16 oz of Mexican beer. Ive been using Aldi's brand and its a very good beer and not bitter at all.  I get  a very good rich flavor from it. Bud, coors or any other cheap beer or bitter IPA   would probably have an off flavor.
I preferred with a dollop of sour cream but isnt necessary.

Made this a couple of weeks ago.  It's ok.  My husband dug it more than I did.  I prefer an easier to make "plain ole" tortilla soup... fewer ingredients, better taste... but that's just me.

Made this for my card club this week, everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe.  I added my own taco seasoning (that I got from this website) instead of the seasoning packages. Very easy and taste great.

Really good and easy. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of enchilada sauce. Left out the corn and added some brown rice at the end. Made the taco seasoning as recommended, that too, was great!

I have made this many times ans it's just delicious.  I probably add a little bit extra of each ingredient. I also make chips with tortilla's sprayed with Pam and sprinkled with taco seasoning and baked until crispy.  Very yummy.

I made this and my husband has been raving about it ever since. It does make a large amount so we have had several meals and he continues to rave about it. I did not use the beer just because I had the chicken broth handy. Otherwise made it as written. Thanks so much. Best soup he has ever eaten WOW!!!!!

All the reviews on this were correct.  This dish was a great crockpot find.  So easy and convenient and tasty.  I used a packaged taco seasoning mix and I used a bottle of Blue Moon beer which is what I had and didnt even taste the beer at all.  I will definitely be making this again.  The next time I may try the recipe for the home made taco seasoning.  I served with scoops, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and I dont think it really needed the sour cream but either way it was delicious!

I'm a novice, and this was my first attempt at a slow cooker meal. It turned out great!! This is an easy and delicious recipe for a beginner. I made a few changes. I ommitted the corn because I just don't like corn in my soup...lol... Instead, I used an entire large can of black beans. I used one can of tomatoes with chiles, and one plain, because that's what I had. I used a packaged taco mix, but I think I'll try the included recipe next time.  I'll definitely be making this again!!

we absolutaly loved this.  Only changes I made were for personal preference.  I don't like black beans so substituted dark red kidney beans instead.  Don't drink beer so didn't have any and used chicken broth instead.

Made this yesterday a day ahead for tonights dinner, used the chicken broth as many people suggested as I am not a big fan of beer.  Tasted awesome, my hubby really enjoyed it too. Took a picture and posted it on FB and have had two friends already ask if I can forward them the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a delicious hearty soup on a cold winter day!   Here is a tip for anyone who interested in making this soup that may be wondering how much chicken to buy:  The package of skinless boneless chicken breasts I bought weighed around 2.3 lbs., which was plenty.  When I made this soup, it yielded approximately 8 quarts.  I had plenty left over to put in the freezer!

This was excellent! I can see now why there are over 3000 reviews. I followed the recipe very closely however I only had one can of the diced tomato/green chili mix so I added a full 14 oz can of tomato sauce to compensate.

This is an outstanding alternative to chicken chili! I made it on Super Bowl Sunday, and I only made one deviation from the recipe: I used a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Also, I took Patti's advice and used the combination of spices she suggested for the taco seasoning. I am using that combo instead of packaged taco seasoning from now on. The great thing about this recipe is that it's even better as leftovers. I'll be making this again!

Amazingly simple and so delicious! Substituted chicken broth for the beer, and as per reviews, added cumin, garlic powder.
A few fried corn tortillas cut into small strips along with sour cream and cheddar tops it off. 
Perfect dish to come home to after work!

I'm completely new to cooking, so I messed up left and right with this recipe. (Mainly the diced tomatoes I bought didn't have green chillies in it, and I drained it when I wasn't supposed to. I also used only 2 chicken breasts instead of 3.) I used Sam Adam's Alpine Spring for the beer. I came home and my husband ate 4 bowls in one sitting.

This was really easy and delicious.  My kids have 3rds.  I only made 2 changes  1) used chicken broth instead of beer 2) used diced tomatoes without chilis and added a 4oz can of chilis.  I used the taco seasoning suggested by one reviewer and it was PERFECT!  This is a keeper, thank you.

I made this exactly as listed and it was very good, both my husband and I loved it!  I used Coors Light for the beer (I usually use Mich Ultra) and we could not taste the beer at all... we are not beer drinkers either but I love chicken cooked in beer.   I used a regular packet of taco seasoning and I did rinse my black beans.  I cooked all day in crock pot as we both work, shredded the chicken and let it cook 30 more minutes.  It was plenty spicy for us.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mine came out more like a chili, but it was very good! I suppose I could add more broth to make it soupier. We topped it with Frito corn chips, sour cream, and jack cheese.

Just wonderful! This was super quick, easy, and cheap to make, and it tasted great. Despite the number of reviews warning against it, I was brave and used the 12 oz. of beer. I'm glad I did, no funny taste from it at all! I used a good-quality local brew (Alaska White), so quality might be the issue that others are having. This will definitely be a staple in our household from now on.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it.  I added a little extra taco season for more spice and lots of cheese.  The longer you cook it the better it tastes.

Was a hit on Superbowl Sunday!  Not a drop left!   Followed as directed accept used chicken broth instead of beer and added green onions along with the other fixins!  Was great to make the day before .Hint:  shred the chicken before you fridge it for much better results and just reheat and serve!!

I loved this recipe. My husband and I are not big on beans, so we omitted the canned chili beans and just used the black beans. Also for a little extra kick I added a 4oz can of diced green chilies.

Should have substituted chicken broth for the beer.  Had a funny twang to it. My husband will eat almost anything but he did not care for this & would not eat any of the leftovers.  Not a keeper for us.

I made this yesterday for a super bowl party happening this evening.  It was so delish that my hubby and I ate most of it for dinner last night so I am making it again right now for the party.  Yesterday's version was done with chicken broth instead of beer, as all we have on hand is pabst blue ribbon and that didn't seem robust enough, and I used the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe, all of it.  I rinsed the beans, using black and pinto.  Loved the soup, but it didn't have much liquid in it.

Today's version is done the same as yesterdays', but I subbed a 14oz can of ground, peeled tomatoes for the small can of tomato sauce, hoping for more liquid.  Hope it makes it to the party intact, it smells awfully good!  Will serve it with sides of sour cream and shredded cheddar, and blue corn chips for dipping or crumbling, diners choice.

This recipe is a keeper, so easy and soooo good!  Thanks Patti

This soup is fantastic.  I'm not a fan of beer and didn't like the aftertaste it added.  Next time I will substitute chicken broth for the beer.  Also, I added 8 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the pot and mixed it in rather than topping it with cheese.  This made for a heartier broth.  Can't go wrong by making this dish.

Wow!  This is the first time I have posted a review...I was drop-dead delighted with this recipe, and so was my husband!  I used 1 & 1/2 lbs. of chicken tenders, as a reviewer suggested, as well as adding 1 tsp. of chili powder. I also substituted chicken broth for beer.  The results were terrific!  I found this in time for Super Bowl Sunday, and I am bringing a batch to work that day...(yes, I have to work on Super Bowl Sunday).  A very easy, crowd-pleasing batch of soup!

I suppose it would be better if I had not drained the chili beans. I hesitated but when I saw diced tomatoes with green chilies, "undrained", I automatically thought I should drain the chili beans, silly me. I found there's something missing in the soup so I added a cube of chicken bouillon and it made a difference. It has a nice kick which I didn't expect at all but I love spicy food so no complaints about that. I only used 2 full chicken breasts though because I think three would be way too much meat for this recipe. Actually I would use less meat but more tomatoes and corn next time for personal preference. I don't think the beer is overpowering at all(I used Mexican beer). Overall this recipe is very simple and easy to make. I'll make it again.

Great recipe, love the recipe for the taco seasoning, and I added a few extra of my own so it has a nice "kick" to it.  I used the chicken broth instead of the beer too, but next time I will use that.  I will bring some to my mom at the nursing home for supper, and likes soups and spiced up food.  She will love this too.

As others have said use a dark beer, I use guinness but I have also used a porter or other stout.

Made this with fresh Vegetables and tomatoes from the neighbors garden. Excellent. Used a variety of tomatoes and extra green chili. Served with sour cream and shredded 3 cheese blend.

I stumbled across this recipe a few months ago when I was looking for a slow cooker soup. This has become one of our favorites! It's so easy. Instead of using chicken breast, I use a roasted chicken which I will shred and then put in the crockpot for the last 1.5 hours. It makes it a little easier for me and still tastes amazing! The best par is my kids LOVE it!

Tasted great, the whole family loved it. I have to admit that I left out the beer and used chicken stock instead. Also, I used one can light and one can dark kidney beans in place of the others; and followed RaisinKane's recipe for Bill Echols taco seasoning. Topped it with mixed cheddar cheeses and served with cornbread. Wonderful recipe, will make again for sure!

This was fantastic!  Even my picky kids ate it.  So easy, used chix broth instead of beer, and couldn't fund 'chili beans' so just used pinto.  Served w/ tortilla chips my kids were making mini tacos w/ the sour cream & cheese, fun.

Excellent recipe.  I substituted chicken broth for the beer and added some garlic powder and it turned out great.  I also cooked it on low for 9 hours.

We LOVED this soup/chili.  I used the taco seasoning suggested in the description (Taco Seasoning by Bill Echols on this site), and everything was absolutely awesome!  Make sure it cooks long enough (so the beer flavor isn't strong), but I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

Delicious and easy!  I added a bit of concentrated tomato soup and water because I thought it was a bit more like chili than soup and I like it a bit "soupier".  Otherwise, AWESOME!

I made the recipe without tomato sauce, since I did not have it. The first night it was only okay. Nothing that wowed me. But the next day, OMG! It was soooo good! I served it (2 days out) tonight for dinner and my guests loved it as well!

very very yummy. The chicken comes out super moist and falls apart by itself in the soup. I only needed to cut a few pieces. I chose not to use a beer ad use water instead. I enjoy my food spicy so i topped it with black pepper. :)

This recipe is great as-is, but it's also easy to build off of.  I generally add a can of kidney beans, and use 30 oz of tomatoes with chiles instead of 20.  This never fails to get compliments, and it reheats wonderfully.

This recipe is a dream come true because you can use it so many ways. I used it as advertised (a soup) the first night. For leftovers, I took a slotted spoon to let the juice drain off and used it as the filling in a taco shell - awesome! For another dinner I drained off the juice again and used it to top a plate of tortilla chips and had awesome nachos. I bet it would be great as a baked potato topper, too. I only had dark beer in the house at the time of preparation so I just used broth and it was still fantastic!

I've cooked this recipe twice.  Once I followed the recipe exactly.  In my opinion, the beer created a strange flavor. This is the reason for the 4 stars.   I used Chicken Broth the 2nd time around, used 2 cans of corn, 2 cans of chili beans, 4 chicken breasts, and used Bill Echols taco sauce recipe.  The 2nd time around turned out much better.  This is a great recipe and is so easy to make in the slow cooker.

Love this recipe!  I work very long hours, so I don't have time to come home in the middle of the day to mess with the chicken. Instead, I boiled chicken breasts the night before and shredded them in my food processor so it was all ready for me to dump in the pot the next morning!  This was a huge hit at our house, and so easy to make!

I actually want to give this one 4.5 stars.  To spice it up a little, I added some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  I also put the onion into the food processer which liquified it somewhat.  I didn't have any garlic or I would added that, as wll.  I cooked it on low for about 8 hours.  Served it with the dollop of low fat sour cream and sprinkled with low fat medium cheddar cheese.  I also crushed lime & chili chips over the top.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was a hit at my house!  I used Corona beer and it was good, but I could taste the beer.  So if you don't like beer, use chicken broth or water.  Will make again for sure!

So yummy and easy- I doubled the recipe for a luncheon at work. I added a bay leaf, used frozen corn instead of canned and added a small can of hatch green chiles. I didn't realize until the next day that I forgot to add the onion, the soup was still wonderful.

Really delicious! I used the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe that RaisinKane posted in a review of this recipe, used XX Amber for beer (since people said it needed a dark Mexican beer), Bush's chili beans, low sodium black beans, Rotel for the diced tomatoes with chilies, and actually forgot the onion and the corn, and it was incredibly, incredibly yummy!  My fiance raved about it and had seconds. Thanks for the great recipe, RaisinKane! I will definitely be making this often!

This dish was very good! I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand - 1 can of chick peas instead of chili beans, 1 can of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, 1 cup chicken broth instead of beer, 1 can of Rotel, 2 packages of taco seasoning and like 5-6 chicken breasts. Mine turned out really meaty and was perfectly seasoned. I cooked on low for 6 hours because I was way from home. After shredding the chicken I cooked for 1 hour on low. We didn't eat it until the next day and MMMMM! I put half away in the freezer for another time and I can't wait.

Made this today and it was great.  Super easy and very tasty.  I left out the black beans only because I didn't have any and it was fine.  Easy to double for a large family or party.

I make this a lot and absolutely love it! I dont always use the beer, and sometimes just use one can of black beans, not chili beans.  I think it does need the beer to make it more soup-y.

This is very easy and really good. I swapped out half of the corn for frozen okra, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great.

I used fajita seasoning instead of taco and garnished with tri-color tortilla strips and chopped green onions.  Also used my favorite beer, Blue Moon, a Belgian wheat ale.  Turned out very good.  Will make again.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I make it all the time and freeze half of it for later.  Don't skimp on the beer, it gives it a really unique flavor.  I like to double the chicken so it's really meaty, but that's the only change I make.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. It works great as both a soup, or you can drain a little of it and use the chicken/bean/corn portion to stuff in a soft shell to make a chicken taco. Both sooo yummy! I definitely recommend using the beer too, instead of just broth. It really gave it a yummy, unique zing that plain ol broth wouldn't do. My only complaint/question is I made the taco seasoning recipe that the creator of this recipe listed (it is in the first review), and since it does't indicate how much of the seasoning to use, I used it all, and it was WAY TOO MUCH!!! WAY TOOOOO SPICY (we were avble to fix it) but it was way too hot to leave as-is. Does anyone know how much of the actual seasoning to use?? Thanks!

I am giving this 5+ stars - it was delicious.  I followed the recipe and only added a little garlic and I used chicken broth instead of beer.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

I fixed this for a family reunion.  It was a hit - not a morsel left over.  I served with mexican cornbread.  I used 3 breasts and decided after it had cooked that it was too much chicken.  I took out 1/2 the chicken and shreadded the rest.  I fixed nachos with the leftover chicken - just mixed in cumin, salsa, pintos and corn and heated in a skillet.  Serve over nachos- yummy!

Fabulous! I was a little skeptical putting this all together. I had to make several subs. I only had 1/4 of an onion, replaced the tomato sauce with a can of tomato paste and a can of water, replaced the diced tomatoes and chilis with a can of stewed tomatoes (in the blender for a few seconds) and half a can of mild salsa. Also only had mozzarella cheese and only black beans. I used 3 tsp's taco sauce and could have used more. I figured with all these substitutions that it would be awful. I was wrong and my picky eaters loved it! It just needed a pinch of salt.

What a warm and inviting soup!  I made it today for the first time and it was a hit with my very picky teenage daughter.  My husband loved it also.  I substituted chicken broth for beer, per previous reviews and it was very tasty.  I used kidney beans instead of black beans as that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely revisit this recipe many times!  I turned the crock to "high" for the last hour or so to really thicken and soften the vegetables/beans a bit more.  Served with corn muffins, sour cream and cheese for a satisfying one bowl meal!

Served this at a Mexican themed housewarming party yesterday, went over VERY WELL! Made as indicated but added one can of drained kidney beans. Also made a veggie version by skipping the chicken and adding half a can of veggie broth. People raved about it & really enjoyed it! The beer really added flavor and made it great.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe as written with the addition of a tsp of cumin since it is a favorite spice.    Cooked in my slow cooker on high.  A bit of Salt and Pepper when serving.   Will make again and I would serve for a party.    Topped with cheese, dollop of sour cream and fried tortilla strips.

Delicious, and tastes great reheated too! My husband and I loved it. The only changes I made were I left out the beer and added about a cup of chicken broth instead. It was delicious..definitely something I will make again and perfect for fall!

Amazing! I noticed when there was 1 hour left that there was a decent amount of liquid left which my husband is not a fan of so at 45 minutes I added 1 cup of dry lentils. Soaked up a lot of the liquid and made it the perfect chunky soup! Scooped it with tortilla chips, added cheese and sour cream!! Amazing!

I was really concerned when I started putting all the ingredients in the crock pot.. It didn't look very pleasing and adding the beer (we are not drinkers) kinda grossed me out. BUT, I've got to say, it was a hit.   Really good!!  We will make it again for sure.

I love this recipe, make it all the time. Perfect dish for summer because using the crockpot helps not heat up the house. I do use chicken broth instead of beer and I only use about 6oz of it. I also drain all of the canned stuff to make it thicker, so for us it is more like a chicken chili. I always serve it with chips, cheese and sour cream on the side, we tend to use it as a dip. Very filling just the same and the leftovers freeze and reheat very well!

I just love this recipe, but there were so many canned items, that i shucked some fresh corn and added it in the last hr of cooking, the canned corn in the crock for 5 hrs, was to over done, plus i used some lower fat greek yogurt in place of sour cream, it is what i had on hand, the rest was just as the recipe called for, the fresh corn made a difference, and light yogurt, made it taste lighter, did not weigh me down, love the crunch of the tortilla chips on top, bought some tortilla's and baked them with my own spices and crumbled then on top, delish, thanx for your recipe, will make this again, every body loved, loved loved  foodie 55

We really enjoyed this - a great recipe for the beginning of fall.  I had to make some slight modifications because I was using up stuff from my pantry but believe it would have been just as good had I followed the recipe exactly as it was listed.  I did go for the beer and used Bass Ale - I think it was a great addition!

This is the best slow cooker recipe I have ever used.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and four year olds liked it as well.  It was absolutely delicious!

Delicious.  I used Corona for the beer and it was great.  Spice it up with a little sriracha if you need more heat.

Wonderful recipe! I added one can of cream of chicken soup to make it creamier, which I think made the dish. I also used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, chicken cooked perfectly. YUM!

A bit bland. Added more of the homemade seasoning. Used 4 chicken breasts. Kids liked this. Was thick, not like a soup. Good to top with cheese and sr cream and scoop up with tortilla chips. Would make this again. Would be great for gathering of teenagers.

This is simply the best soup.  Easy to do and you can spice it up or down depending on your tastes.  My family and I eat this often in the fall and winter months.

Too spicy for my tastes but that's easily changed by cutting down on the green chilies.  My husband RAVED about how much flavor was in every bite.

I did switched from kidney to garbanzo beans bc its what i had.  I did drain the beans first even though it didn't say what to do. :)

This soup is amazing! my husband loves it and it makes the house smell great too. The first time i made this is followed the recipe exactally, it was great but a little salty for us. I add about a half cup of brown sugar at the end and let cook for 30 mins or so really adds a sweet flavor to the soup. thanks sooo much for posting this recipe!!!! :)

My family loved this recipe. The only thing I did different was to puree the vegetables in a blender (so my kids won't see that they're eating vegetables) while I was shredding the chicken.

Wonderful and flavorful! Made this for a work potluck and everyone raved about it!!! Will make this again and again!
Edited: I have made this the traditional way as well as a more milder version to be more kid friendly. For a milder taste I used 1 can diced and 1 can tomatoes with chilies, 1 can chicken broth instead of beer. Both taste amazing! I also have taken leftovers and drained the excess liquid and cooked enchilada style with flour tortillas in the oven for 30 min. with some of the drained liquid and cheese baked on top. It is fabulous! This recipe is so versitile and EASY!

This seems more like a chicken chili to me than a soup... but you can call it whatever you'd like, because its AMAZING. Crock-pot recipes are my favorite, and smelling it all day definitely made me anxious to try it for dinner. We served it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and some crushed fritos (the saltiness of them went GREAT with it). I will definitely be making this over and over!

SOO TASTY! Made this yesterday and it was a big hit! The only change I made was I subsituted chicken broth for the beer & I did not add black beans because I don't care for them...I definitely recommend sprinkling cheese and adding sour cream when ready to eat!! This is a keeper!

I have made this so many times I've lost count!  I use a lot less liquid for a more chili-like texture and put it over yellow rice for lunch.  This is also easy to make gluten-free, if you use chicken broth in place of the beer.

Perfect! Made last night for an Oscar girls night and everyone loved it! Did replace the beer with chicken stock, other wise did exactly as directed. I'm also glad I topped with the suggested toppings as it really did add flavor! Will make again!

This was great - I don't know why, but I just wasn't expecting it to be so yummy! I followed the recipe, except that I substitued the beer with chicken broth.  I made it with corn bread on the side and my husband loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

This soup is amazing! I followed the directions exactly the way they were except I used pinto beans instead of chili beans. I used a regular lite beer and I don't think it gave it a strange taste at all. I wouldn't change a thing.

I found this to be extremely acidic. I'm going to go add some brown sugar and hope that it cuts the acid of the tomatoes. If I ever make this again, I might try sauteing the tomatoes first to cook out some of the acidity.

This is fantastic and really easy.  I added a couple cloves of pressed garlic (since I add it to everything) and a few dashes of cumin due to other suggestions.  I used chicken tenders verses breasts because thats what I had.  Very flavorful, and the chicken fell apart during stirring.  This will be a regular in my rotation.  Also, I cooked for 9 hours since I was at work and it was wonderful.

I made this sans beer (I have a young child) and it was very good.  I didn't even notice it was missing anything.  I've made it with hamburger and thought that was also good.  Great recipe to make your own modifications and make it to your own preferences!

For being easy, delicious and healthy. I made this on the stove top and sauteed the onion and garlic with a little cumin.  Then after all of the ingredients were dumped in (I used 32 oz box of chicken bouillon), instead of chicken, I floated 6 frozen Boca burgers in the broth until they were soft. (Microwaving them makes them hard) When soft, I pulled them out and diced them up.  For those following weight watchers, I calculated this to be only 2 points per cup before adding cheese or sour cream.  Yum.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  Didn't change a thing from the original recipe.  The secret it using a quality beer and not a cheap light beer.  Gives it a wonderful flavor.  Adding cheddar, sour cream and chips is a must!  Cornbread compliments this recipe perfectly.

This is great. The kids just loved it, I used ground turkey burger instead of chicken , and beef broth instead of beer. Definately a keeper.

Tasted great.  But as a single person, it made too much leftovers.  It's just not something I could eat for several meals in a week!

This recipe is a favorite in our house.  I have made it for large groups and it all has disappeared!  It makes quite a bit, it is easy and warms up well too.

This was pretty good, it ended up more like a chili than a soup.  The flavor could have been bolder, but it served us well for a recent ladies night.

Excellent soup....love this with a few minor substitutions. Used white chicken chili seasoning in place of taco seasoning, and chicken broth in place of beer.

This is so good!  Instead of raw chicken breasts I bought a pre-cooked whole roasted chicken and removed the meat from the bones.  I added the chicken at the end just so it could heat up.  I also added a T of chili powder and a couple tsp of ground cumin.  I substituted kidney beans for the chili beans and chicken stock for the beer.  Served it with shredded cheddar, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.******UPDATE*****If you are using the entire roasted chicken then double the recipe or else there is WAY too much meat.  I just used half the roasted chicken and froze the other half for later.

Just had this for dinner with Grandmothers cornbread from this site.  Yummy.  We don't drink so I subbed chicken broth for beer. I also added a few pieces of Kielbasa.  Used the taco seasoning recommended by recipe creator in most helpful section but I didn't add red pepper flakes or black pepper because it was spicy enough for us.  Definitely looking forward to it for lunch tomorrow at work.

This was fantastic. I ate it 3 days in a row. Used cheap beer instead of something really nice and couldn't tell the difference.  Next time I'll add a can of chicken broth also because it was a little more like stew than soup to me and was overloaded with shredded chicken.  Otherwise it was perfect.

made this last night and used what I had on hand...kidney beans, white beans, 4 frozen chicken breasts and 28 oz of tomato sauce plus the other listed ingredients......Delicious! My husband loved it and it made for great left overs for him to take to work for lunch.

My husband and I love this soup!  It's incredibly easy to put together at the last minute or to fix in the crock pot the night before and pull out of the fridge to cook in the morning.  It's also versatile forgiving if you don't have something.  Definitely use the taco season recipe provided in the first review.  Also, the flavors get better as it sits in the fridge for a couple of days, so leftovers are amazing!

Perfect for a cold rainy night. Even my 15 month old loved it! Cooked on low for 8 hours, didn't have to tear chicken apart. It just fell apart on it's own. No beer in the house so I used applejuice. Next time will add jalapenos for a little more heat.

I followed the recipe almost exactly ( I already had shredded chkn) and the spice was way too strong for me.  I ended up draining a lot of the broth and adding more tomato sauce and chicken broth.  I ended up with what I was looking for but the original recipe was less than desirable.  Thanks anyway

Spicy, but not too hot.  Used a brown beer and couldn't taste the beer, but think it added depth.  Wonderful recipe.

My husband thought it was the best soup he ever ate!!  I didn't change a thing but didn't add the can of chili beans since I didn't have any.  Still great!

I recently made this as one of many dishes to stock up my grandmothers freezer with. I was short on time that day, so I boiled and diced the chicken, then just cooked everything on the stove top. It had really nice flavor, and was very simple to put together. Thanks!

Would have used Chicken broth instead of beer. I used a pale ale, and definately could taste in the soup, not so good. A little spicy for the kids, and lacked some flavor. Maybe cilantro?? Anyway it was just ok. I was expecting to be wowed with all the great reviews it got...

This really wasn't what I expected. The chicken was very tender but it was way too spicy for me. The taste was ok when I added a ton of sour cream to cool the heat down. I like the basic idea of it, I may try again and change some things around.

This soup is one of my favorites to make!  I leave out the beans.  Added a chopped green pepper.  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand but used enchilada sauce and that was a great addition.  Also used 1 can of HOT diced tomatoes and one lime/cilantro can.  It definitely had heat and a lot of flavor.  I usually make the Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe from this site to go with it.

This recipe was wonderful!  I substituted 1 can garbanzo beans for the 1 can chilli beans because that's what I had on hand.  I have to say it was a great addition to the one-pot meal.  I used Corona as the beer and it turned out great.  I would not recommend using a dark beer. Served sprinkled with corn chips and cheese.  Delish!

Easy to make and tastes pretty good. I need to tweak the seasonings a bit, it was a little bland. Next time I would add at least another can of tomato sauce.

I thought the beer taste was too strong..maybe because I used a dark beer.  I would use a lighter beer like corona next time.

Oh my goodness!  This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  I was looking for a chili....and this was a little thin as it is intended to be a soup.  So, I just scooped out about a 1/2 cup of the liquid, added a bit of cornstarch to the liquid, stirred it up until it was thin.  Added it back to the soup and WOW !!!! Instant hit with my kids. No other alterations necessary~ I'm making a double batch next time!

Made this as a gift for my pregnant friend. Omitted beer (i know it probably burns off but whatever) and used chicken broth instead. So, SO good. Used Bill Echols taco seasoning as recommended (and made a big batch of that later as well to use on EVERYTHING mexican flavored). Not only did my friend love it but she shared with her mom and sister who both demanded the recipe immediately. Also made it for boyfriend who now thinks I'm an amazing cook-too bad for him i get all my edible stuff off allrecipes lol.

YUM!!!  I made this for tonight and it was a hit.  I got a late start so I cooked it on high for 4 hours (shredding the chicken after 3 hours).  A lot of people mentioned leaving out the beer, but I think it adds a lot to the flavor.  (As a Texan, I chose to use a Shiner Bock.)  I took the advice of other reviewers and used Bills Taco Seasoning.  I wasn't sure how much to use but ended up throwing the whole thing in, and it was perfect!  I will be adding this to our dinner rotation, especially now that it's getting cooler.

i thought the recipe was excellent. i love using the crock pot in the cooler months of the year. we used an oktoberfest beer and it worked out really well with all of the other flavors. a few drops of franks red hot right before serving give it a nice kick. i would definitely make this again.

So easy, so delicious! I didn't customize at all. I used hot chili beans and one hot rotel, one mild. The spiciness was just right for me.

This is really good.  I left out the beer by accident, but it did not need it at all.  Also, I used frozen chicken breasts and they cooked perfectly on high for 5 hours.

Amazing!  We increased the servings to 40 and sold this soup as a fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and has been asking for the recipe. We did change a few things.  We omitted the beer, used chicken legs, thighs and breasts, and cooked the chicken first then used that broth as a base.  Also we did it on the stove so it only took about and hour to cook.

This was a fantastic recipe!  So easy and everyone loved it!  From my 7 year old to my 71 year old father....My mom asked for the recipe.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I'll be doing this one again and again...it was delicious!

Really easy recipe!  I used only half a bottle of leffe dark beer, and added an extra cup of chicken stock plus 2 tbsp white sugar.  I used 1 28oz can of crushed tomotoes, instead of the 2 cans with green chilis.  Turned out great.  Served  with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheddar and fresh snipped chives.  This recipe is a keeper :)

Awesome flavor!  I remembered the recipe at the last minute when trying to decide a dinner that would be available at different times because our kids are in and out on some nights.  I had to use 4 chicken breasts instead of 3 (how they were pkgd) and could have used another can of chicken broth (I used broth because I didn't have any beer in the house, next time I will try that).  Anyway, I will definately make this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent! My husband wanted the leftovers the following night for dinner, and he would not usually request that with any type of stew or chili. Served with cheese-toasted beer bread. Yum!

It was so easy to make!!  I used dried back beans just to keep some of the calories down.  I also add some red spicy pepper because my family and I like some heat to our meals.

This soup was excellent!!!! I followed the exact directions and it came out just how I wanted it to. I was a little worried that it would be more like a chili but it was more like a soup, which is what I wanted. I used rotel tomatoes with chilies (one mild, one regular) and the regular gave it quite a bit of heat. Next time I think I will do both mild but everything else came out great. I used a low sodium taco seasoning as well. I will definitely be making this again!!

This soup is amazing!  I used a light mexican beer (sol) and followed the recipe exactly.  Slices of avocado, sour cream, and cheddar cheese really topped it off nicely.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

This was a good soup but next time I will not use the beer, it really made it taste a little off. Also I added a chopped green pepper. I stirred in sour cream and added some cubed avacodo just before eating. Had i not used the beer this would have gotten 5 stars.

We LOVE this soup!  So easy to make and it's really a crowd pleaser!  If the diced chiles are too spicy, you could always use regular diced tomatoes.   My husband adds extra heat to his by adding cayene pepper.   This is in heavy rotation in my crock pot!!

This is the best soup known to man kind!  I have made a few changes based on other reviewers recommendations, using chicken broth instead of beer and using 2 cans of black beans instead of the chili beans.  If I don't have the time to wait for the slow cooker, I will very lightly simmer the chicken for about an hour (i'm sure less time will suffice if you are in a serious time crunch but I've never tested it...), take the chicken out and let it cool.  Make sure to not BOIL the chicken unless you want rubbery chicken.  Then I will add the remaining ingredients to the home made chicken broth instead of adding boxed chicken broth and let simmer on the stove.  When the chicken has cooled enough to shred, I add it back to the soup and cook for another 15-20 minutes.  I haven't had a chicken tortilla soup in a restuarant this good, YUM!

Made this the other day for my boss and her family. It was fantastic. I made a few substitutions, though, that really made it:  --No beer, chicken stock made using Better than Bouillion instead --Made my own taco seasoning --4 chicken breasts instead of 3 --Sliced black olives --Extra cumin  Yum yum!

Awesome recipe, just don't calculate the sodium content! Made it before a camping trip (in October...burrr!) and it was the perfect thing to warm us up. I used double (ok maybe triple) the taco seasoning and I think I skipped the beer. Topped it with sour cream, plenty of shredded cheddar and used "Tostitos Scoops" chips to shovel it in my mouth ... who needs a spoon?!? Tastes even better the next day after the flavors mend together.

This soup was awesome. Kind of a taco chili and it was great. I drained the corn, but did not drain the beans and used frozen chopped onion and 2 chicken breasts. The chicken just fell apart and was so tender. Great recipe!

This was a good and different dish.  I think that it definitely needed the cheese and sour cream. I added some queso cheese after the shredded chicken was added to give it more flavor and consistency. I would save it for when you have to feed more people because I had alot left over.

The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is that if I would have NOT ADDED THE BEER it would have been a pretty good chicken taco soup. The flavor of the beer reminded me of a college frat party gone wrong when mixed with tomatoes and soup. I followed the instructions exactly and I wish I would have listened to my daughter when she said "Beer is NOT for cooking soup momma."

I will give this 5 stars for both taste and EASE!  I have handed this recipes to about 6 people so far - and it has become a staple in all of their homes - just like it is in mine.  After having my baby - this was the first thing that I found that was easy enough to throw together!

This soup is blah- it calls for way too much chicken and it's bland.  I honestly don't see how is has so many good reviews.  I've made something very similar before- it's called taco soup and I used ground beef- it also called for a can of olives.  This was a bit different but tastes about the same.  I tried to follow the recipe as close as I could.  But I also tried to cut the sodium content- rotel and chili beans have a ton so sodium in them! I also used that Echols recipe for the taco seasoning.  I added about 5 cloves of garlic- because garlic makes everything better- but not this soup!  I really wanted to use the beer- but I wanted a dark mexican beer like someone mentioned but we never got around to buying it so I used 12 oz chicken broth.  I also added 3/4 red bell pepper because I had it in the fridge.  I added 4 chicken breast halves and there is A LOT of chicken in this.  I think the 3 WHOLE chicken breast is an error because that would be 6 halves.  Oh yeah and I did use the mexican tomatoe sauce like someone recommended.  Overall this soup needs more seasoning, it is so bland!!!.  I don't think my small substitutions made a big difference.  I don't see how people find this spicy?  Maybe some jalepenos and a lot more cumin/chili pepper next time?  I topped it with cheese, sour cream and homemade corn tortilla chips.

I won't make this again.

VERY YUMMY AND EASY TO MAKE!!!!  I did make a few changes... Instead of using beer i used chicken broth, frozen corn instead of canned, I added lots of garlic, and some salt, chili pepper, and cayenne pepper. I used hot taco seasoning, because I like spicy foods.  I also topped it with some fresh cilantro.  I did double the recipe and froze the leftovers.  It freezes well, the leftovers were GREAT!

This soup is soooo good!  I have made it several times and have used chicken broth instead of beer based on other reviews. I also have added the juice of one lime to the mixture prior to cooking and have also added the juice of one more lime and some salt to the shredded chicken before I put it back into the slow cooker. I have made it with and without the lime and it is great either way. It's easy, delicious and healthy!!! Plus, my 21 month old and husband both love it!

Incredibly delicious.  This is IMPOSSIBLE to mess up.  You're basically pouring a few cans of things into the crock pot, walking away, and coming home to a delicious meal.

Wow! This recipe made a wonderful soup!! It was very spicy which I love. My kids want me to use the mild rotel next time because it was a little too spicy for them. I served it with shredded cheese and homemade tortilla chips (instead of crackers). Will definitely make it again!

was so delicious and tender. I used what I had on hand- black olives, frozen mixed corn/green/red peppers.  When I got to step 2 I was worried the chicken was not going to be tender; however, after shredding it and cooking for another 3-4 hours (had to leave the house so it cont to cook on low) the meat was exquisitely tender!  will definitely be making this again, and again, and again!

I'm finally ranking this after cooking it a dozen times.   Easy to modify as needed based on what's in the house. I enjoy serving it with cilantro as well.  I use any canned diced tomatoes; and sometimes I use beer.  Freezes well.

Excellent! I didn't have chili beans, so I subbed canned pinto beans. I threw in 28 oz of diced tomatoes instead of 20 oz, and tossed in extra seasoning-- chill powder, garlic powder and cumin. I also put in about 1/2 cup of salsa and several jalapeno slices for that extra kick! I set it on low at 11 a.m. and by 7 p.m. it was ready to go! I served it over spanish rice, and instead of spoons we used homemade tortilla chips drizzled with salt-- divine!

This will be one of the life-saving recipes I can turn to during a busy day---you set everything in the slow cooker, turn it to low, and you come home to a wonderful-smelling house and a tasty meal at the end of the day.    Some tidbits about my changes: I used "hot" taco seasoning to give it a little kick, I used closer to 16oz of beer, and I also ended up adding some chicken stock to the mixture to create more liquid for the soup.  Also, I didn't want it to be so heavy on tomato and spice, so I thought the chicken stock would add flavor and prevent the tomato/spice flavors from being TOO dominant.  Addtionally, there isn't really a need to have to open up the slow cooker just to shred the chicken.  I ended up leaving it in there for 8 hours, untouched, and I took out the chicken and shredded it with forks just before serving.  It's better not to have to open up your slow cooker, because it makes the temperature drop a lot and thus increases cooking time significantly.  All in all, a great recipe, and very forgiving/accommodating to different tastes.

This is our families favorite dish. Even my 3 year old grand-daughter loves this dish. Try it. The only thing I changed was instead of Tortilla chips I use the salad Sante Fe strips. Mmmm. Love it.

This was sooooo good. I used everything you listed int he main soup and it was really wonderful. I didn't use crushed chips, but quickly fried tortilla strips and put that on top with a handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  The cheese melted and the tortilla strips still held up their crunch. Just great! Thanks.

DELICIOUS!  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I didn't add the beer.  I didn't add any liquid at all, though I would've added water if anything.  Didn't have any chili beans and it didn't matter.  Only used 1 chicken breast, so I made a bit of a smaller batch but I loved the seasonings.  I added a little extra cayenne pepper and some fresh garlic.  DELICIOUS and hearty!

I like this recipe, except for the beer. I still detected a bitter flavor in the soup even after the right amount of cooking time. I might try chicken broth next time instead.

Delicious & easy soup! Also, very healthy(depending on what you top it with ;)! I love spicy food, so I use spicy chili beans, hot Rotel and add lots of cayenne. I also use reduced sodium taco seasoning. Usually I will add a few additional dashes of chili and cumin powders to taste.

I LOVE this soup!!! The flavors in it are wonderful, I used the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe as suggested. I wasn't sure about the beer, so I put in half a beer and half chicken broth. You can't detect a beer taste in the slightest, and I'm not a drinker, so I would be able to tell. I added a little bit of fresh chopped cilantro, and a squirt of lime juice as well. The best part...this recipe is EXTREMELY easy! Put everything in the crock pot in the morning, go to work, come home...dinner is served! I will make this again and again. Thank you so much!

Very good.  I made this recipe to use up 6 piunds of chicken tenderloins that thawed when the freezer died :(    We eat this by itself or over rice.  Tasty, easy, and filling.   4 stars only because 5 stars are reserved for 'Out of this world' recipies.

Yummy!  This is part of my regular rotation now.  I have made with chicken or hamburger and both are good.  I have made with beer and without and it is good either way.  I am making it for supper right now!

Very simple and turned out great. I took the advice of other reviewers and added cumin and cilantro to the mix--I also threw in some jalapeno slices which was delicious. Didn't think the cheese and sour cream would be necessary, but when added they definitely completes the soup!

Great soup! I don't think the beer is really necessary and I'll probably replace it with chicken broth next time. I also only used 1 can of chilies and it was plenty spicy for us. Thanks for the recipe:)

Just had 3rds on this hearty soup! But I made a few changes. Here's what I did - same ingredients and used the seasoning recipe that the author posts...but changed beer to 32 oz free range chicken broth, added an extra can black beans, 1 can kidney beans, and extra corn. Used Hormel VEGGIE chili. Also gave "generous" measurements when it came to the cumin and chili powder. I also had a half bag of frozen peppers/onions so I threw that in as well. This is AMAZING and will replace all of my tortilla soup recipes as it is the easiest to make and tastes the best!

This was excellent. I added some cayenne pepper for kick. It was pretty simple and inexpensive to make. I crushed tortilla chips in it and added the shredded cheese and sour cream....delicious!

My seven year old ate two bowls.  I added a can of chicken broth and omitted one of the cans of rotel to cut down on the kick.  I didnt have the packet of taco seasoning so I just shook in some mexican spices.  I used kidney beans and black beans.  My chicken was frozen when I added it and it still came out wonderful!  Highly adaptable recipe.

I used chicken broth instead of beer and only used 1 can of the diced tomatoes since I'm not a huge tomato person.  My first bowl of it actually wasn't so great.  So on my second go at it, I added the sour cream and fritos instead of tortilla chips and they both made a HUGE difference... The fritos makes it taste more like a taco and the sour cream mellows out the taco seasoning, which I thought was too strong at first.  Will definitely make again!!

I'm from Texas, and we LOVE Mexican food.  This soup was yummy and almost authentic tasting... the only thing I would change is the chili beans.  They gave it too much of a chilli taste, and it lost a little of the Mexican taste.  You can double the black beans, or add seasoned pinto beans instead.  Thank you for this recipe.  We will definately make this again!

even my kids love it! With Tortillas. I've made it several times now and have switched the beer to a can of chicken broth.  Had my bachelor friend make it once and he loved how simple it was and it tasted great! He makes it often now too.

Extremely good recipe! Will make again and often. I modified it slightly to match the ingredients on hand, which was to substitute one of the cans of tomatoes and green chilies with a 14 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and added an extra small can of diced green chilies and omitted the 8oz can of tomato sauce. It smelled wonderful while cooking and was even better the next day. A keeper!

i was really unsure about this as i was putting all the ingredients together, but it's really good once its all done!  it is a little bland, but it's all according to what you like- i would add more spices next time. if you drain out the juice its good over rice as well.

Very good. Pretty spicy. Used Taco Seasoning I from this site (Bill Echols), and used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with chiles bc I didn't find 10 oz. cans, which added to the spice, I'm sure. However, I added sour cream, cheese and corn chips and it toned down the spice well.

Awesome recipe! I left out the beans and used diced tomatoes without green chilies since my family is pretty sensitive to "spicy" flavors. To reduce cooking time I browned the chicken first. Cooked on low for about 4 and a half hours. So delicious!! Family loved it and I will deffinatly make this one again.

This was very good - a little salty for me, but the boys gobbled it up.  The beer really added a richness to it all, and it kept everyone fed for the weekend.

This is absolutely delicious!  I am so happy that someone posted chicken broth in place of the beer!  My mom visited for lunch and I gave her a bowl of this soup.  She was scraping the bowl afterward!  Your family will love this!!

Great recipe- you really can't mess it up. I didn't even have the onion on hand and no beer (1 cup chicken broth instead) and it was YUMMY! I added a 3/4 block of cream cheese at the end and it was AWESOME! New family staple!

The only change I made to this recipe was to sautéed chicken and “chunk” prior to putting in the slow cooker.  I served on rice with sour cream and shredded cheese and a big slice of Mexican cornbread on the side.  Terrific for a crowd.  Thanks.

I make this at least once a month and freeze half of it so we can eat the leftovers. It's sooooo good and sooooo easy. Plus it's easy to keep all the ingredients on hand, especially since I usually put the chicken in frozen! Instead of using the beer, I've started using a cup of water with boullion added to it--I just like the flavor better that way. I also use the spice mix from Bill Echolls which is really great in this soup and in turkey tacos.

I love this soup and so does my family! I did use chicken stock instead of the beer and it was fabulous.

This was my second time making it and it was delicious! The second time around I added hot chili beans, spicy taco seasoning and one chopped jalopeno for extra heat.  It was amazing! I also add a small chopped green pepper for good color and flavor too.

Good and Easy. I will make again. However, I agree with previous posters that wrote this recipe needed a bit more spice. I added chili powder, cumin, pepper flakes and cayenne.

Whole family enjoyed.  Used chicken broth, not beer.  Update: Just made this for the second time with some left over cooked chicken.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker though, and just threw  everything in the pot and cooked for a hour or so.  Still was great!  Tossed in some chili powder too.  This is one of those recipes that you might actually have everything in the pantry already.  Great.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was delicious.  I didn't have black beans so I threw in Great Northern Beans.  Also, I did use a bottle of Killian's. The beer added a great flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

I can not stand beans, and I thought this recipe was FABULOUS! My husband wants me to add this to the weekly rotation...he said it was better than chili, which is a huge compliment. He even asked me to send some leftovers in his lunch tomorrow.   I left out the beer and added 1/2 a can of cream of chicken soup and 3/4 can of chicken broth. I also left out the onion as my family doesn't like. I also used canned Mexican corn, and 24 ounces of diced tomatoes with green chilies.   Don't forget the chips, sour cream and cheese! It makes it even better!!!  Great recipe!! Will make again with the above substitutions.

If I make it again, it won't be with beer.  I am trying everything I can to salvage this - I'm either just not a beer drinker or the kind I used was not the best for this recipe.  I'll try this again and substitute chicken broth and take the spice level down a little too - a little too much for our taste right out of the pot.  However, we've had things with this level before that calmed down the day after to make it perfect for us.  Still, as is, this recipe did not work for us.

OMG - so delicious!!! After reading everyone's reviews I followed some substitutions: I used a can of chicken broth instead of beer and I used the taco seasoning by Bill here: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Taco-Seasoning-I/Detail.aspx ----- But I added 1/2 tsp of Chipotle for some extra kick! ---- I also substituted a can of Chili beans with Pinto beans since the Chili beans has a sauce pre-mixed in and I try to avoid the extra salt and preservatives. ----- I drained the beans and can of corn but I dumped the cans of tomato w/green chilies in with all it's juice.  I followed the cooking instructions exactly and it turned out PERFECT. I will most definitely be making this dish again and again!

If I ever make this again, which is highly doubtful, I will omit the beer.  And even if I did omit the beer, the recipe is just not doing it for me.

Way too spicy for our taste - would use only 1 can tomatoes with chilies and one regular can of tomatoes.  Easy to fix on top of the stove.

Pretty good and certainly easy enough to whip up  on a busy weeknight! All I had to do was chop an onion (last night), open a bunch of cans this morning, dump everything into my slow cooker, turn it on and LEAVE!!! B/c of the ease factor, I even had spare time to make homemade taco seasoning (Bill Echols) :) I did make a couple of substitutions, basically to accommodate what I already had in my pantry. I used an 11 oz. can of Mexicorn, (2) 15.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies (I figured that it was OK to do so since I used less corn...), HOT Mexican tomato sauce (La Preferedia brand) and, as mentioned b4, Bill Echols taco seasoning for the packaged stuff. I used Corona for my beer and Busch's chili beans in medium sauce. And since I only had frozen chicken breasts available, I dumped those in the slow cooker with everything else. Set on LOW for 8 hours with excellent results (because I leave for work at 7 AM, I set my sc for 8 hr.; I don't get home until close to 7 PM and my warm setting will only run for 4 hr. MAX). Served steaming bowls with a sprinkling of shredded monterey-jack cheese, chopped cilantro, a squirt of fresh lime juice and tortilla chips for dunking! My fiance commented that he'd be happy if I made this again (and he HATES beans!!!). I think I'll try this with ground beef (pre-cooked) next time!  Play around with this - it can be easily changed to suit your tastes. Tx. for sharing, Patti! :-)

Easy meal to throw together in the morning and then enjoy at dinner time.  I use one can Hot Rotel and one can Regular since we like our food spicy. Makes great leftovers.

Delicious and super easy! All you do is dump everything in the crockpot and you have a tasty, hearty soup at the end of the day. I substituted a can of chicken broth for the beer because I'm not a beer drinker and I only used half an onion because that seemed like plenty for me. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. You can taste some spiciness but not too much at all. The soup is great with sour cream and cheese, but the soup has a really great flavor on it's own. Very satisfying.

This taco soup is divine!!!! I was worried when I  first made it (and smelled it cooking) that  my kids wouldn't like it, but they both LOVE it (3 & 8)!!!! Everyone who has tasted it has raved and asked for the recipe. Definitely a family favorite in this house! Thanks SO much for sharing!

Great recipe.  My husband and I really enjoy this recipe.  I made a couple of substitutions - instead of chili beans, I use kidney beans, and instead of the tomato sauce, I substitute spaghetti sauce.  I omit the beer and use chicken broth as suggested by other reviewers.  I have made this recipe several times, and have enjoyed tremendously.

A really great recipe for those slow winter days as a nice pick-me-up, or dreams of a Mexican vacation!  I did however make three very minor changes to the recipe. 1.  I used frozen chicken breasts 1.5 lbs 2.  I used a lime infused beer.  3.  I added tbsp of lime juice, my flavor I guess.

Super quick and easy! Tasted good. I added some crushed red pepper to it to give it a big of kick and took out the tomatoes. Pretty good soup.

I love recipes like this because you can add and subtract to suit your own tastes. I took the advice of others and used chicken stock in place of beer. I also put the chicken in while still frozen and let it cook over night and they basically fell apart on their own. Will definitely make again!

AMAZING!!!!!!  This was soo tasty!  The only change I made was instead of adding the beer, I just didn't drain the cans; I dumped all the cans into the crock pot and it was plenty "soupy"-- sooo delicious!

This is delicious and SO easy! I do recommend being careful not to cook it too long or the chicken gets a little too mushy and the liquid starts to disappear. For the beer, I use Corona, and I add a heaping tsp of cilantro and a half tsp of ground cumin to deepen the flavor.

Great! Nice & easy too. I just chopped some onions & garlic then opened up some cans and threw  in the chicken, doesn't get much easier. I added cheddar on top and made corn bread on the side.  For the leftovers I put them into a muffin tin so that I can just grab the amount I want.

Delicious!  As per several reviewers' recommendation, I skipped out on the beer and used chicken broth instead.  I also added garlic because I'm a huge garlic fan.  It was so easy.  I put all the ingredients in the crock pot before class and came home to delicious soup. :)

I did not use beer.  I used chicken broth instead.  I did not use the chili beans nor the tomato sauce.  Used 1/2 cup of frozen corn.  Used Tomato paste and used 2x as much chicken.  Used blue tortilla chips for something different.  WAS even BETTER the next day!!!  YUM!!!

This recipe is awesome!  My husband loved it.  I used Rotel tomatoes, a little spicy for the kids.  The spice mixture is perfect.  Definitely serve with shredded cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  Will definitely make for get togethers.  Thanks.

This one's a keeper.  So easy. and delicious.  Substituted chicken broth for the beer.  Added 1/4 cup of taco seasoning mix and 1/4 cup of ranch dressing mix.  Also used pinto beans instead of chili beans.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Chicken easily shredded at the end of the cooking time.

My family loved this recipe. I did replace the beer with chicken broth as my dad is not alcohol friendly in any way shape or form, and I upped the chili powder because we all like spicy foods.  It's great because you can adjust the seasonings and fillers (beans, corn, hominy) to you and your families tastes.

This was so yummy, it was very filling as well. I also substituted the beer for chicken broth and sauteed the onions prior to putting them in the crock pot. I hate to cook, and this was super easy. I put avacado on the top of mine, with crushed taco shells and my husband put cheese on his. We both loved it.

I changed this up a little. I used diced tomatoes with jalepenos, a can of green chiles, 2 cans of black beans (and 1 kidney bean), taco bell taco seasoning, cumin and garlic powder.  It was not a favorite, but tasty enough I'd make again.  Sour cream and cheese made it perfect! It passed the picky husband test, he doesn't care for beans in soup/chili had 2 bowls and liked it.

Loved it! Used 2 cans black beans and seasonings suggested in author's comment in lieu of taco seasoning. I could smell the beer when I took the lid off but not taste it at all (I hate beer LOL).

Great Recipe!   All I did was add a little spice.   The beer gives the soup a great flavor.   Make sure to use a good quality light beer (like Stella's).  Cheap or dark beer will make this soup taste funny.

This was soooo yummy a must have for your slow cooker.  Everyone in my family enjoyed even the picky one.  I would bring it to any pot luck.  VERY easy to assemble and was very excited to share with my friends.  Great as a leftover as well.  A must try

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  The only difference is that I sauteed the onions before adding them to the slow cooker.  It turned out great and my husband very enthusiastically gave it five stars.  It reheats very well, also...which is good because it makes a lot!

WOW!  I love this recipe!  I doubled the recipe, split it between 2 slow cookers and will be freezing the leftovers.  I am thinking of freezing for future dinners and smaller portions for lunches.  Thank you for the great addition to my recipe box :-)

Best taco soup I've ever had. I made it according to the directions and added a little bit of chipotle sauce to give it a "smokey" flavor. I served it with chopped fresh cilantro and sour cream. Yummy!

This was great.  I also omitted the beer and used chicken broth just to lower the calories though.  I also used chicken thighs because that is what I had on hand.  I threw it all in at one time and it cooked from 8am to 5pm turned out perfect,  Shredded the chicken when I got home and served.

I have been making this for a few years now.  My husband loves it.  I use Rotel brand tomatoes and chiles, and I like using the "Hot" variety.  Makes the soup very spicy, which is a big hit in Texas and my native Louisiana!  It's so easy to throw together, and cleanup is easy!  I have made this for friends, as well, and it is always a favorite.

This is good but better described as a chili.  I used the recipe for Bill Echols Taco Seasoning that another reviewer recommended.  Very spicy!  My husband loved this recipe!

This is hands down my favorite soup recipe. I follow the recipe exactly. But I omit the beer and add chicken broth if necessary. I like my soup on the thick side so I usually barely add any. Comes out more like chili but still every bit delicious. Always a hit for potlucks or served with corn bread on a cold day.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was really good. My kids finished theirs with no complaining which is a huge plus with 2 picky eaters. I substituted extra tomato sauce since I didn't have any beer in the house. I also cooked mine for closer to 9 1/2 hours since I left it cooking while I went to work.

This is a fantastic, easy soup. I made just a few adjustments - I used 2 -14.5 oz cans  of diced tomatoes with green chilis, 2 packages of taco season and an additional can of great white beans. This soup had a nice kick but not too much. THE KEY to this soup is the quality of the beer. Use a hoppy quality beer or a quality stoudt for optimum flavor. I used Sierra Nevada Torpedo and it was perfect. Guiness would also be a great choice. PS: Shredding can be a pain, I just cut into bite size morsels.

Very good base tex-mex style soup. I plan to work with the spice some since the taco seasoning means so much to the overall taste.

This was good.. really more like a chili than a soup. I only used 2 lg. chicken breasts and one can of beans and there was almost no liquid left. (I do think my crock pot runs a little hot) It's good served over rice.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever - I should have reviewed it ages ago. It is easy to alter if you're short an ingredient, like it spicier etc. It turns out every time, makes a huge recipe, freezes well, goes great on nachos, is easy on the wallet and very heart and waistline friendly.

I thought this was delicous!  With some minor changes.  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of cumin to the taco seasoning.  Next time I would add chili powder for some heat (it was too much like tomato sauce).  Also, this was much thicker than a soup.  I actually followed the cooking recipe but then set it to warm for another 3 hours.  It was delicously thick and I served it over yellow rice.  SO GOOD!

My husband and I have both had head colds, so something warm and spicy sounded perfect, but I was starving and did not want to wait until tomorrow to eat this! So I thawed some chicken breasts in the microwave while I boiled 2 cups of water for some chicken broth (I am not a beer drinker...) I cooked the chicken on low in some oil and fajita seasoning while the broth boiled. I added all the ingredients (+ some dried red pepper and garlic salt) to the broth while the chicken "slow cooked" and tried to let everything stew. Once the chicken was cooked I shredded it in the seasoned oil, then added it to the soup. In an hours time, I had some AMAZING soup that was spicy enough to clear my sinuses! Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow :D

This was pretty good. I overcooked mine a little because I was at work all day, so it cooked on Low for about 9 hours. It was a very unappetizing colour, but the flavours were great. We added sour cream, cheese, and tortilla chips to garnish.

NEW FAVORITE crock pot recipe! Used one can each of black beans, kidney beans, and chili beans (cause we like beans in this house), and a small jar of salsa in place of the tomatoes with chiles (cause that's what I had), and it was delicious! Cheap to make, and I think you could sub a lot of ingredients depending on your preference/pantry supply and it will still turn out great! I liked it served over rice and hubby liked it served over rotini noodles. This one made it into the TNT recipe book for our house - thank you!!

I made my soup on the stove top as I didn't have enough time to make it in the slow cooker. I used chicken broth instead of beer and tomato sauce. and I added a little tabasco sauce to spice it up a bit. over all a real crowd pleaser and I'll definitely be making it many times in the future.

I went to a get together this past weekend and the theme was soups & stews.  Everyone brought something different and brought this recipe and it was a huge hit.  My dish was the only one that was completely gone.  Very easy to make!

Wow... I have never had a more delicious taco soup...  So hearty and flavorful!  Couple changes I made: used 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of 8 oz, because it looked like it may dry up after cooking so long.  Also, did chicken tenders and left in for 8-9 hours (only took out at end to shred).  Chicken came out practically melting and shredded so nice and easy.  This was a BIG hit with me and my husband.  He said this one is definately "a keeper!"

This was really good, and the frozen leftovers, re-simmered a couple weeks later were even better.  I omitted the beer, and used extra broth instead. Next time I think I will only use one can of tomatoes....or perhaps a hotter version. My whole fam commented that it was just a bit too "tomatoey".

This soup is unbelievable and very good for you!  It is packed with protein and fiber.  I did make a few changes.  I always cook the onion first before adding it and I always use low sodium taco seasoning. Plus, I add 1 cup of heated low sodium chicken broth about an hour before it's done.  I've never had to add salt or any other seasonings and the little bit of extra liquid makes it a perfect consistency.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I've been searching for the perfect tortilla/taco soup and unfortunately this just wasn't what I was looking for.  I should have realized this when the submitter was unsure as to whether to call it soup or chili.  The beer didn't work for me, even though I do use beer in chili. And I had to add 2 cups of chicken broth to get this to the consistency of soup.  Even then I was disappointed with the results - it took a fair amount of sour cream and avocado to balance out the tastes.  I ended up throwing most of this out.

Pretty good. I guess a prefer something with a fresher taste, but for a quick, out-of-the-can meal, this is quite good. In addition to tortilla chips and cheese, try topping your bowl with a few avocado slices. Yum! Note: I have since tried this again with fresh tomatoes, jalapeños, onions, and chilli peppers from our garden, extra taco seasoning, as well as with a home-brewed dark beer and . . . Yum, much better!

I've made this several times now and it really is fantastic.  So easy to just throw everything in the slow cooker in the morning and come home to fabulous dinner!  I always add kidney beans and a jar of chunky salsa.  Use Newcastle for the beer and it's great.

Love this recipe! The only thing I do differently is to add one more can of beans, usually pinto beans. Very EASY and very tasty! This recipe makes a lot of soup so it's great for a crowd or to freeze for later.

My soup ended up more like a chili than soup, but that was ok and it was very good. Next time I will only use 1 can of beans and substitute one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies with one can regular diced tomatoes. I prefer it not so spicy. This recipe is a keeper!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!!  It was incredibly easy to make and so delicious!  Only change I made was to spice it up a bit by adding some Cayenne and Chili pepper to it.  I also substituted the tomato sauce with tomato paste that I watered down to create more of a sauce (only because I accidentally bought tomato paste instead of tomato sauce).

LOVE this nice and easy recipe! Full of flavor!! I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning and used Corona beer.  I didn’t find any funny taste as others did. I also through my chicken breast in frozen and after 6 hours took them out and shredded them with a fork. Great recipe and thank you for sharing!!

We loved this soup!  The only suggestion I have is that we would have liked a little more liquid...it's VERY chunky.  Next time I will add slightly more beer and tomato sauce.

I am always looking for slow cooker recipes where you just throw the stuff in and leave it!  I hate those recipes where you have to basically cook the whole meal before you put it in the slow cooker.  This one fits the bill and it tastes great!  I will be making this one often!

I made this soup for my husband and I and it was a total hit!  I used chicken tenders instead of breats, and cooked for 8 hours.  The chicken was so tender!  I also added cumin and garlic powder as suggested.  I used the beer and could not taste it at all... I also added about 12oz. of chicken broth to make it a little more "soupy".  If you prefer, you could make it less spicy by using the mild Rotel, but I thought the flavor of the original was just wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely the BEST soup i have ever made!  it makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  The only change i made was to put one can of tomatoes and green chilies instead of two.  I also squeezed some fresh lime juice into the bowls after serving them along with some crushed up lime tortilla chips and cheddar and sour cream.  LOVE this recipe!

Loved this soup. Subbed chicken broth for beer and added the whole 15oz can of tomato sauce. I used cannelleni beans instead of chili beans cuz that's what I had. Next time I will soften my onions first. After six hours in the crock pot they were still crunchy. I only used two large boneless chicken breast (which I put in frozen) and it was plenty of chicken. I cooked the first hour on high and then turned down to low. Makes a lot so I have some for my lunch today. Very good!

With alterations to suit our taste, this soup was delicious!!!! We don't care for the beer taste, so we leave that out. I have not made it with the corn, but would try that someday.  I also added cumin, because I really like the smokey flavor.  I add a can of diced green chilies, too.  I have put frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot and they cooked just as well as thawed ones.  I then pullled them out to shred them, returned them to the crock pot for another hour or 2.  I love this soup for football and Sundays as an alternative to chili. (only because we can't eat chili every week!)

I made this recipe with only two minor changes- I couldn't find chili beans so I used red kidney beans, and I used Mexicorn in place of regular corn.  The results were spectacular!  My fiancee and I devoured this dish and cannot wait to be hungry again so we can have some more.  It's very filling.  I was worried that it did not come out very chili-like but once I added the sour cream the consistency became thicker.  Delicious!

Great starter.  Just needed a lot more spices (like garlic powder, red pepper seeds, cumin and chili powder) to give it some kick and make it more authentic tasting.

Loved this soup!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but only cooked for 5 hours on high in my crock pot because I was low on time.  Turned out perfect.  When I first tasted it straight out of the crock pot, I was worried that it was too spicy, or that the spice flavor was overbearing.  But once sour cream and cheese were added, the blend was great.  I will definitely make this again.

We loved this!! It was so easy!!! We are Vegetarians so instead of the chicken I used Quorn Chick'n Tenders. I also passed the recipe on to my Mother whose a Vegan and she made it with the Quorn and veggie broth. She said "WOW!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!"

I've tried different taco soup recipes and this is the absolute best tasteing and easiest recipe I've seen. I usually don't have the beer on hand so I leave it out. I would rather have this any day instead of chili!

I followed recipe using Bill Echols Taco Seasoning, but found it too salty. Next time I will cut back on the salt. I used three large skinless chicken thighs in place of the breasts and added a low salt 14 oz. can of chicken broth to make it more of a soup consistency.  Since I only had 1 can of the diced tomatoes with chilis, I used a jar of home packed tomatoes. My husband loved it which means I'll be making it again.

So GOOD!! The recipe makes a LOT of soup, so I froze half of it for a later date. (There's only 3 of us in my house) The beans and corn make it really filling.

Tasted great!  I also added cilantro and minced garlic!  We ran out of tomato sauce so we used ketchup and also no chicken breast so  we used chicken thighs!  It was the bomb!

I don't understand why some of the rater rated this recipe with no flavor. If you use her spice recipe by Bill Echols...the recipe turns out fantastic!! Thank you so much RaisinKane aka Pattie. This is sure a keeper and my entire family ranted and raved about it for days. Awesome! Thanks again.

This recipe was ok, it needed some doctoring. I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce. I don't care for canned corn, so I used frozen corn. Also, I used 3 different types of beans (chili, white northern and black). The taco seasoning didn't seem to have enough flavor, so I added more spices and hot sauce.

Wonderful! This was my first slow cooker recipe with my 7 quart Crock Pot I got for Christmas. I used two large chicken breasts (that I put in frozen because I was late for work), a smaller can of corn because it isn't my favorite, chicken broth instead of beer (because I only had my favorite beer in the house and I couldn't bear to cook with it), and added a bit more chili powder and cumin. I followed the cooking directions exactly and it turned out perfectly! Can't wait to take it to work tomorrow and brag about it!

This soup was gorgeous.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made my own Taco Seasoning.  It made quite a lot and I was able to freeze some, it freezes & thaws well.  This is going to be a family keeper, thank you for sharing RaisinKane.

Awesome recipe!  I used the Bill Echols taco seasoning that the recipe submitter suggested in the top review.  I didn't have any beer in the house, so I subbed chicken broth.  It came out so yummy.  Perfect for a frigid Minnesota day!

Loved It! Quick & easy to make. This is the first time I used a slow cooker & I'm glad I choose this recipe(: I made a few alterations for out tastes: 1) replaced beer for chicken broth, 2) added a bay leaf & finally 3) added 1/4 tsp of chili powder & paprika. This is a keeper. My only regret is that I don't have a larger crock pot to double the recipe!!

Delicious Recipe! I've added a can of Refried Beans (Refried Black Beans are also ok) to thicken the soup and make it a little more hearty.  I also added a clove of garlic because, well.... I love garlic! I will make this for years to come!

I'm giving this 5 stars because although it was very tasty, the prep time won me over.  5 minutes to dice an onion and open some cans?  Heck ya, bring it!  Made it with chicken stock as I didn't have any beer on hand.  Good easy weekday recipe!

This was very good - definitely more stew like than soup like but that's not a problem for us. I think I put a little too much chicken in but I can adjust that for next time.

This morning DH said "Are we having THAT for dinner tonight?" Well, he "ate" those words :)    Absolutely delicious and added leftover roasted chicken from last night for the last hour & sub'd broth for the beer taken from other reviews...After dinner, he said it's a 5-Star! Bill Echol's "TACO SEASONING I" is the only one we use for any mexican dish!!!

Lots of flavor, and does have a little heat. We cooked it to the directions. I think it would be better with out the beer (we've tried it twice with different beers). I also think you could leave out the chicken, if you wished, as a vegeterian dish. My hubby likes it with the chicken, & I pick it out.

I have made this three times now, and it is so good!! I double the chili beans, black beans, corn, taco seasoning and chicken- use frozen chicken breasts- it fills up my large slow cooker that way. I cook it for about 7 or 8 hours on low- usually at night. The chicken is so tender- it shreds with two forks! DEFINITELY use Bill Echols "taco seasoning I" from this site!! Serve over some tortilla chips- I add sour cream, my husband and kids do not- too good!! Freezes well too!!!

This soup was good!  I didn't have any chicken in the house but lucky for us, we went out to eat the day before and had fajitas, and we brought home a large amount of fajita meat and veggies.  I added that to my soup near the end (since they were already cooked) and it worked out great.

Cooked this recipe and when done, took out chicken. Took out 1/2 the stew and put it in a blender for a few seconds and placed back in slow cooker with chicken. Very good with cornbread for dinner. More like chili, still thick. Next day made enchiladas with the leftover. Still had much leftover for freezing and dinner some other night. Very good recipe and will cook it again.

This was a big hit with our family. Easy and relatively healthy until we added the cheese and chips. I did add dried cilantro.

I love this recipe. I made this for my family a few weeks ago and it was a big hit.  I am gonna make it again tonite. Soups are always great when the weather is chilly outside. Adding the beer just gives it that extra kick, in my opinion. I give it 5 stars..............

This is a huge hit in my house! My dad who hates chicken soup, actually requests me to make this when he comes over! I use Chicken breasts on the bone to give it a good taste. I just take the skin off, and about an hour before serving, I take the chicken out and cut it up. I also use Corona for the beer.

Love this. Would not change a thing except, I did it all stovetop. I seasoned the chicken breast and stuck them under the broiler on low untill the juices ran clear then set aside to cool while I assembled the rest in a large pot. I shredded the chicken an added and let simmer until the onion was done, but still just a little crisp (personal choice).  Topped with the crushed chips and sour cream.  All was done in about an hour and still yummy! Made it several times and will keep in my recipe box for future use!

Super easy. You could do it in less than 5 min. if you were really moving quick. I added some cumin, chili powder, and garlic power, but it would have been pretty tasty without it.

I have celiac's disease and can't have gluten so I used gluten free beer.  It was just the right amount of seasonings and it was more of a "stoup" (half soup/half stew).  Very filling. It got rave reviews by everyone I fed it to.

This soup was awesome!  It tasted so good, I could hardly believe I made it!  And it was so easy and the kitchen smelled fabulous all day.  The only changes I made were to use Mexican style kidney beans that I happened to find at the store, 1 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes (only b/c I read the recipe wrong), and only 2 chicken breasts b/c they were all I had (and to be honest, I think it was plenty).  This is going to be the perfect thing after coming in from the cold here in Chicago.  Thanks for such a good, easy recipe!

I thought this was good and have no specific complaints about it. I think, though, that maybe it just wasn't my style. To me it tasted more like chili with chicken. I was hoping for more 'taco' flavor.

Delicious! I used a bag of store-bought taco seasoning and it was very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. This was so quick and easy to make, next time I'll just throw it in the crockpot before work - great!

Wow, this has to be one of the easiest dishes I've ever made.  I don't think you can mess this dish up.  My husband, daughter, and I all loved it.  Next time I will add a little more spice to it, but it was very good.  I didn't have any beer, so I used chicken stock instead.  Very hearty and healthy.  Thanks.

great soup.  i took user advice and added 1 cup of chicken broth to make it more a soupy rather than chili consistency.  I added 1/4 c cilantro, 3 cloves garlic, and 6 corn tortillas cut in strips.  I cooked on high for 5 hours.  NExt time I will only use 1 can of beans, not 2.

Awesome!  Great recipe for a cold winter day.  I used chicken thighs and I used chicken broth rather than beer.  Also, instead of tomato sauce, I used enchilada sauce.  Some slight variations for personal taste, but this recipe is great.  I sprinkled shredded cheese on top (mexican cheese blend) and some crushed torilla chips and a little fresh cilantro.  Delicious!

YUM! I've made this 3 times, once with breast tenders, once with boneless thighs, and tonight with bone in thighs. It worked out great everytime. Tonight I just removed the bones when it was all done cooking. I've had to double the recipe the last two times cause it goes too quickly!!!

This recipe was good but needed a lot more seasoning. I added cumin, salt, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and paprika. Come to think of it, another package of taco seasoning probably would have been easier.

This is very good and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly as written even down to using the recommended recipe for Taco Seasoning on this site.  I had used it before to make tacos at home.  This is definitely a keeper.

The last time I made it I used beer and did not like it much.  Maybe I'd like it better with a different beer, but I'll probably leave it out next time.  The family did eat it though and it was easy to make.

My whole family enjoyed this dish including my 13 month old (with a spoon of sur cream.)  I was making this with what I had on hand so I made 3 substitutions.  I only had 1 can of rotel so I substituted diced tomato for the second, I used great northern beans in place of chili beans, and I used cooked chopped turkey that we had frozen after Thanksgiving in place of the chicken.  I am looking forward to trying this again using the homemade taco seasoning.  This worked great to use up leftover meat. I completely recommend it.  My three year old said it was "dewicious" and she is pretty picky.

This soup is very tasty.  Made the recipe exactly as stated.  I took the advice of another reviewer and saved the shredding of the chicken after the soup was finished cooking (after a full 8 hours)...probably mush easier to shred this way as the chicken falls apart for you.  Best served with corn chips, sour cream, and shredded cheddar!

A good tasty soup - I even got brave and added the beer.  This is a recipe that you can tweak to your taste.

This soup wasn't bad but nothing great. We needed a larger pot so we weren't able to cook the chicken with everything else. Nothing spectacular.

I thought it tasted like raw onion soup.  I would saute the onion first or leave it out.  Wished that I would have read the reviews about substituting the chicken broth for beer.  Was to spicy for the kids to eat and I used the mild taco seasoning and the mild rotel tomatoes with green chiles

Fabulous!  Family chowed a double batch down.  I added two cups of water as it was a bit too salty for me and one cup of chicken stock.  I did use the beer as I really like to cook with it.  Also increased the chicken and cut it into chunks before I cooked it.

i was very happy with this one. for chili beans, i used kidney beans...im assuming that was what was meant. definitely dont skip the beer. i used bud. doubled it for a large party, and had no leftovers. i made jalapeno cornbread to go with it. (homesteader cornbread recipe from this site w/ jalapenos added to batter.)

My husband made us this soup yesterday and we *LOVED* it. He followed the recipe as written, not changing a single thing. He didn't top his with sour cream, but I did. I made homemade tortilla chips. This recipe is a keeper! *SO* easy, delicious, and cheap to make!!

This was easy and great.  I dumped all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook for 5 hours.  Mine was done then and I didn't need for it to cook the extra two hours.  I think my crock pot cooks faster than most.  Easy and delicious!

this soup was an absolute hit at my dinner party. We do a thing called a "soup swap". It was so so good. It tended to be a little thicker like a chili. To take care of that, I imagine you would just add a bit of water or another can of tomato sauce. I garnished with fresh cilantro, sprinkle of cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Definately will be making this again!!! Even better the day after.

I took some suggestions from previous reviews, and browned the chicken in a skillet with some chili powder before putting it in the crockpot. It turned out great! I have been looking for a good, easy tortilla soup-style recipe. My boyfriend loved it! We will definitely make this again and again. Enjoy!

Very good, and so easy! I didn't add the beer, and can't say that I missed it. Did add some chicken broth as others suggested. I also didn't use taco seasoning, but instead used Cayenne, Garlic, Salt, Paprika and Cumin.

I would give this recipe three and a half stars. It was good except for the beer. It gave the house a funky beer smell. Next time I will use broth.

Really good slow cooker soup recipe.  Easy and very flavorful.  I made mine with the beer and was pleased with the flavor and my mother made this with chicken stock instead of the beer and it came out great for her, too.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have time to put this in the slow cooker so I made it on the stove top. My chicken breasts were frozen so I boiled them before placing them on top of the soup mixture and I also sauteed the onions a little bit so they would be soft and also used the recipe for Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning.  Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe as written and it was delicious. Best chicken taco soup I have found.

I love this recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the changes I made.  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts because they were on sale.  I used chicken broth instead of beer as well.  I stuck the chicken thighs down into the mixture to cook.  I cooked it for about 9 hours on low (the time i was at work), and when i came home from work, the chicken thighs were tender and juicy.  I shredded the chicken, and it ended up an amazing, hearty, heathly soup.

We loved this.  The only thing we would change would be one can of Rotel instead of two and two cans of chili beans instead of one.  It's only because most of my family doesn't like tomatoes.  This is a definite keeper!

That was delicious!  I'm not a bit onion person so I only used half of one and then added some healthy shakes of chipotle powder.  YUM.  I took the leftovers into work and everyone wanted to try it when the smelled it reheating in the microwave.  I've already been instructed to bring this to the next potluck.  Thanks!

Wow! This is sooo yummy! I followed the advice and added 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of garlic. Served with mozzerella cheese and guacamole chips--WOW!

We love this recipe!  It was so easy to make.  I work outside the home a couple days a week and love to make this before I leave in the morning.  I use frozen chicken breasts and I work 10 hour days and the soup is great!  Once I even forgot the onion and used minced and it still was amazing!  Thanks so much!

A very unusual but good flavor.  I think the beer is what made it so different from more traditional taco soups.  We ate it for a week since there are only two of us, but it still tasted good at the end of the week.

This recipe is great.  Super easy and makes a good amount.  I put my slow cooker on high though and only had to cook it between 4-5 hours.

This was a great recipe.  I found that I needed to cook this on high for five hours in my crockpot.  After five hours, it was perfectly done and the chicken was easy to shred.  I also used a can of chopped green chilies as I didn't have any tomatoes with chilies on hand.

THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!! It was really good. Everyone in my family enjoyed it, even my friends' babies... I cooked it for 10 hrs in the crockpot while I was at church... I didn't use the beer, because of the children and I didn't have any onion powder, but it tasted fantastic... I could I have used more chili powder though.... maybe next time. I will definitely be making this more often and it will stay in my recipe book.

Made this soup today, and was very good.  Used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning, as the recipe submitter suggested, and it was seasoned just right.  Will be making this one again.

My husband saw the onions and said he wasn't going to eat it.  I got him to try it anyway, and now it's his FAVORITE.  He's insisting I make it for a big family get together.  We don't drink or have beer on hand, so I used chicken boullion cubes for broth.  It worked great!

This recipe is awesome. The flavor was absolutely delicious. The only changes I made was to use chicken thighs instead of chicken breast (I didn't have any on hand) and omitted 1 can of tomatoes and green chiles and can of tomato sauce and replaced it with fresh salsa from the refrigerated section at the grocery store. I also added about a tsp of garlic powder and a few extra shakes of chili powder for a little more kick. Definitely top with sour cream, cheese and chips! Burned my mouth eating it, it was so yummy.

This is a very hearty soup-lots of flavor and the chicken just melts in your mouth.  I used the Echols taco seasoning and ckn broth instead of the beer.

I love anything that you can toss in a slow cooker so I decided to try this soup. I ended up adding cilantro to mine and also a little cumin & cayenne pepper. It was delicious except I did not enjoy the beer taste. My boyfriend & his friend devoured it but I think next time I will use chicken broth instead of beer. Also, I tossed in frozen chicken breasts & cooked it for almost 12 hours on low. The chicken was perfect and fell apart when I shredded it. Great soup!

This soup was great! Super easy to fix and easy to modify if you need to. I didn't have canned tomatoes with chiles, so I used a can of diced tomatoes and threw in some green salsa. My husband doesn't like spicy chiles/soups, so he added some ketchup and honey to his bowl plus some shredded cheese and he LOVED it! I ate mine spicy but will compromise and probably make it with ketchup and honey in the crock pot next time. I also skipped the chili beans and only used one can of black beans, as he also doesn't like a lot of beans in his soups. Topped with sour cream, shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips this soup was FANTASTIC! :)

I make this recipe as written, except I use chicken broth, not beer. It's excellent and it didn't make me feel like I needed to try it with beer to experience the true soup flavor, because we loved it so much without! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious! With the exception of a few small changes, I followed the recipe to a T, and everyone came back for seconds (which is always a good sign, right?). The chicken was so tender, it just fell apart. My changes include:  1. Adding another chicken breast since we served a big group of people 2. Used 4oz beer, and 8 oz chicken stock 3. Added 1tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp cumin as per another user's suggestion.   I left it in the crock pot for about 11 hours total, and loved the result. Thank you for a great recipe!

I really enjoy this recipe as fall is rolling in and its chilly outside.  I was cleaning a bunch of chicken and decided to throw this together as I was actually preping for another meal on the weekend.  I am enjoying it all week for lunches and easy week night dinners.  We like spicy so I used chili ready beans and hot rotel tomates.  Also made the recommended Bill Echols Taco Seasoning.  Also   Must serve with co-jack, sour cream and crushed tortillas or crackers.

I made this Sat. and we loved it! The only change I made was to use chicken broth rather than beer and I used more than 12 oz. to make it more like soup than stew. Also used one can of original Ro-Tel and one can of extra hot since we love spicy foods. I had leftover baked chicken so I shredded it and added it at the very beginning. I also added a little cilantro. The only side dish was a big pan of Mexican cornbread. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is a hit in my house.  The only thing I changed was I used chicken broth instead of the beer.  I also cooked on the stove instead of the crockpot.  If you buy the chicken premade, you can prepare this in 20 minutes.  One more thing... I added cilantro and a little cumin. YUM!

I made this as a quick meal so I didn't use the slow cooker for it.  I made it in a stock pot on the stove.  I used every ingredient EXCEPT the beer; I used chicken stock/broth.  I am not a beer drinker so I thought it would be too much for me.   I added a little extra spice and two cans of chili beans....it was perfect.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and I boiled them to prepare for the soup.  Topped with some avacado, the tortilla strips, cheese and a bit of sour cream....it was great! (Oh and I read what the author of the recipe said about the seasonings...I used exactly what she had listed as they were a staple in the pantry).

I think it was just average.  To be fair, I couldn't find 10.5 oz cans of tomatoes with green chilis so added both 14.5 oz. cans.  To me it was a little to tomatoey (is that a word?)I used my immersion blender to chop most of them up since my husband won't eat chunks of tomato, maybe that was part of it. It seemed like it was lacking something too.  I don't like to spicy either so didn't want to add much.  I thought 3 chicken breasts were to much chicken also.  I guess I should have gone with my gut and only used 2 and not all the tomatoes.  I also didn't like the sour cream in it.  I usually love it on everything so it surprised me.  It did whip up quickly but I don't think I'll make it again.

This was good!  We made it exactly as written, next time I will drain the beans instead.  Otherwise it's perfect!  We also cooked it a lot longer than the recipe calls for (10 hrs) and it came out fine.

Very, very good.  Used canned mexicali corn and rotel.  I let it cook for an hour more before shredding the chicken.  The chicken was very tender and the broth was outstanding especially on a dreary rainy day!

The *best* chicken taco soup recipe! We used cooked rotisserie chicken from the store and substituted chicken broth for the beer. The longer it cooks, the better it is! Great alongside some warm cornbread.

Followed recipe exactly, except used chicken broth instead of beer.  Threw all ingredients in crockpot at 10pm, cooked on low all night and served at an 11:00 am luncheon. Everyone loved it!  Served with cheese, sour cream and purchased tortilla chips (crushed).  Will definitley serve again!

this was awesome!! my boyfriend, his brother and his mother all loved it!! definitely a keeper. i was a little nervous with the beer, and as i took little peeks through out the day i was definitely unsure! but it was fantastic!! i wouldnt change a thing...and i wouldnt be afraid to add in extra stuff you have in your fridge. We had some jalepenos in our garden that added a little kick to it but not much! this was perfect!!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I would call it more of a chicken chili than anything else.  Don't get me wrong, it is good, but I wouldn't say it was great.  Will I cook it again? Probably not.  I would rather make a chili recipe I got from this site.

This soup was DELICIOUS! I do not have one bad thing to say about it.  You can alter the spicy-factor just by altering the amount of hot peppers you put. I used chicken broth, as someone had recommended, and it was a good choice.  I even made my own tortilla chips to put on top!

This is delicious. I made it to freeze and it was awesome when I heated it back up a few weeks later. I replaced the beer with chicken broth as another reviewer suggested.

Beyond Awesome!!  I have made this multiple times. My entire family always ask me to make it when the weather is going to be cold!  Used Sour Dough Bread Bowls.  Even better than using regular ones. I will continue making over and over and over!!

I left a few things out,the onion and can tomatoes.Added extra spices for heat after it was done cooking. The flavor before the extra spice was really good,after even better!! I soaked and cooked my beans rather than using canned. Cooked in my giant crokpot and had NO leftovers. Hubby 3 giant sons and a small son ate every bit. We will be making this for years to come,thanks for the recipe,it was worth it!!

Easy to make and very tasty. I left out the beans, as nobody in my family likes them, and served with the "optional" ingredients - cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Great for football Sunday!

If you have any doubt, CHECK IT AT THE DOOR, and make this soup because it is amazing!!! If using Patti's suggestion of Bill Echol's Seasoning mix, you have to make about 1.5x the stated recipe to yield 1.25oz as called for by recipe. I used beer, nothing bitter about it. I also added about 2C chicken broth, only bc I wanted a thinner soup, not a thicker chili consistency. Of course I added more of the base ing. like paprika, salt, etc. but I recommend tasting it at the 5 hour shredding mark to see how to adjust to fit your tastes. My only wish* would be for the chicken to be flavored somehow prior to adding it in the mix. Maybe as leftovers it will absorb more of the flavor of the soup, but as is it tastes like excellent soup with really moist boiled/shredded chicken tossed in. Still the best soup I've had in awhile though!!!!

Great recipe!  Much better when beer is used.  Have tried to substitute the beer with chicken broth, but it did not taste as good.   Thanks for a new family favorite!  :)

Just made this tonight & it was soooo good! Used chicken broth instead of beer based on everyone's suggestions. I only used 2 chicken breasts because I didn't want it too thick. The only thing I drained was the corn. Definitely suggest the cheese and tortilla chips. I'm excited for the leftovers!

Exceptionally easy (I leave out the onion) and very well liked by all!  I do use chicken broth instead of the beer (just because it's what we have around).  With the leftovers, I add a little cornstarch when I reheat it to thicken it up, and it makes a great dip with tortilla chips or to serve in soft tortilla shells.

Fabulous.  Have made this twice in a month - husband loves it and so does everyone at work - yum yum.  Skipped the corn though - everything else the same.  I put the chicken breast in frozen - came out fabulous.

First go around on this was amazing!  I cooked it on high for 4.5 hours.  I simply took the chicken out at 3.5 hours to shred it up and threw it back in to cook for another hour.

Excellent, great for company with some sides.  I doubled the recipe but my slow cooker didn't like that, so when it was time to shred the chicken it was still partly raw.  I transferred it to a soup pot and simmered for an hour, then shredded.  Worked out OK, so I guess it could be a slow cooker recipe (single) or in a pot for a couple of hours.  Don't leave off the chips and cheese to top, they made it!

This was *so* delicious! And I could not believe how easy it was - if you can use a can opener, chop an onion, and stir - you can make this. Most of the ingredients I already had on hand, and what I didn't have was not expensive to go out and purchase. I ended up using a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, and a small can of chopped green chiles because that's what I had in my pantry. I also omitted the beer because we don't drink alcohol, and used a can of chicken broth instead. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. My kids normally do not like chili, but they asked for seconds on this one. Thanks!
**Update : I made this again this week, and used a 28oz can of Diced tomatoes w/ green chiles, and it came out much spicier! My husband thought it was perfect, but sad for him - I'll never make it like that again. It was just too much for me and our little ones. Still great, definitely a keeper. I'll just stick to the toned-down version :)

Very good flavor!  My husband loved it.  It was a little bit to spicy for me. I think next time I will use only 1 can with tomatoes and chilis and one can just plain chopped tomatoes. If you like it a little spicy, try this.  I will make it again.

Added in 1 tbs chili powder, 1 tbs garlic powder, 1 tsp cumin and 1 tbs chicken bouillon paste. Also I accidentally bought  cream corn instead of regular corn and used it. I have made this multiple times and this was the best flavor the soup has had.

Used broth instead of beer and started with frozen chicken breasts, frozen broth and frozen black beans. 4 hours on high, then sredded the breasts, 1 hour on low, and it was almost as good as some of the taco soups I've had at resturants. A little salty (even though my broth and black beans are unsalted) - I might cut the taco seasoning back a bit the next time I try this recipe.

Great taste and very easy to make! I love that I didn't have to cook the chicken ahead of time. My husband loved it too! I substituted chicken broth for the beer and realized after I was at work that I forgot the chopped onions. But it still was fabulous! I highly recommend this for busy working women!

EXCELLENT, easy, so yummy! I didn't have the Rotel so I just used diced canned tomatoes and a diced fresh jalapeno. I also just diced up the chicken from the beginning and cooked on high for 4 hours. (Slow cookers are very forgiving.) Very tasty, the whole family (including hard-to-please-kids) enjoyed it!

This recipe really is amazing! Even my fiance raved about it, and he usually does not like any kind of soup. I used frozen chicken like a few other reviewers, and it was so tender I couldn't believe it! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow

I made this yesteday and it was quite good.  I added chicken stock when I shredded the chicken since there was virtually no liquid left at that time.  I also only used two chicken breasts since ours always seem to be huge - 3 definitaly would have been too many.  For how easy this was, it was quite good.

This was so, so good!  I didn't change a thing except for to squirt a little dash of lemon juice into it.  I also used Bud Light Lime for the beer.  Yum Yum Yum!

Very good and very easy. Added Cumin, Curry and a tad bit of sugar to sauce to cut down on the acidity.  Very good on a chilly night!

Very good.  I did not have chicken, so I used ground beef that I browned before hand and added to the other ingredients.  Added crunched up Taco Doritos to my bowl.  Yummy!!

Delicious! I followed the recipe using the top taco seasoning recipe on this site, a can of Bud Light beer, and seasoned to taste a bit at the end with chili powder and garlic salt. I wanted this to be thinner like soup, so I added about 2-3 cups of chicken broth. **Update: I've made this quite a few times and always have to do some doctoring. I added a jar of enchilada sauce and got closer to what I was looking for. Finally, I followed a helpful (and odd) review to add dry ranch seasoning. It worked like a miracle! You can't even tell it's there, but it added the flavor that was missing. I will always add the ranch seasoning now.

I looked over this recipe before I decided to make it to see if it was different from the one I already make. The cook time on this recipe is too long. I usually bake about 4 bone in chicken breast on 350 for about 25-30 minutes depending on the thickness. I use either home made chicken broth about  or store bought(about 1 1/2 cans) add can corn, black beans, can of mixed beans, either diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions or can of rotel tomatoes, a package of taco seasoning, and a pack of hidden valley ranch dry seasoning packet(this gives it a very good flavor.) Of course you would cook 1 chopped onion, 1 red and green bell pepper then all all other ingredients along with the shredded chicken and simmer for about 30 minutes. This soup has no end to the things you can add.

Threw it all in the crockpot, turned it on high and left the house for 4 hours, came home to a wonderful easy dinner. I didn't use the beer but used a can of V-8, 1 can of tomatoes w/chilies (plenty of heat) and 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I also added 3 cloves of diced fresh garlic. The smell was wonderful and the flavors were explosive. Glad we had leftovers as it should be better tomorrow.

I followed this recipe though made it on the stove top as I didn't have enough time for the slow cooker. I cooked the chicken first then shredded it and added it in. Excellent of blend of flavor and texture! I forgot to add the can of tomato sauce but found I didn't need it. I added about a cup of chicken stock instead of the beer.

I made a revamped version of Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup by RaisinKane aka Patti for Allrecipes Allstars Canada.
#ARSoupsUp #soupoftheday

This is the recipe I made:

2 onions, finely chopped
2 cans baked beans, Bush's vegetarian
2 cans black beans, drained and rinsed, PC Blue Menu no salt
1 can Del Monte Southwest corn, drained
1 can Fire Roasted Rotel
2 cups no salt tomato sauce, Hunt's
2 cups homemade chicken stock, from the chicken I roasted
1 tbsp homemade taco seasoning, no salt or sugar added
1 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper
1 1/2 lbs shredded chicken
1 small lime, juiced

Add all the ingredients except the chicken and lime juice to a large slow cooker. Stir to combine. Cook on high for 6 hours. Add the chicken and lime juice. Stir to combine. Turn off the slow cooker and let sit for 1 hour to heat through. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Makes 8 to 12 servings. I usually freeze the leftovers so we can have it at a later date.

Yummy!!!  I made it last week and all four of my children asked me to make it again!  I left out the beer and added chicken broth.  The only other variations were that I used one quart of home canned Mexican tomatoes with chiles, cilantro and garlic.  I also pan seared my chicken breasts before adding to the crockpot.  Delicious!

This is going to become a soup staple for me.  I especially like that the prep work is 98% opening of cans!  This will be wonderful in the summer so that the house doesn't get hot by cooking something before putting it into the slow cooker.  I did make it by directions at first but found that the taco seasoning was too strong and the soup too thick for my taste so I added 8 oz of chicken broth as well as several cloves of fresh garlic.  I believe in the future I'll up the chicken broth to a full 16 oz and put the fresh garlic in immediately.

I agree with some others that this recipe was more like a chili than a soup but very tasty and easy. I used chicken broth instead of the beer. I also took the advice of others and used one can of plain diced tomatoes and one can with green chilies. However, next time I'll use both cans with the chilies as I thought it needed a little more heat. Loved it with the sour cream, cheese and chips on top! Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper.

Just made it...and found it to be very much like chili, but without much complexity, flavor-wise; just very salty (even with low-sodium taco mix) and spicy (which is fine with me, I like spicy). Had to add some brown sugar to taper off the saltiness and add a bit of richness. If I made it again, I think I'd use dark beer instead of amber ale, and make my own spice mixture (ended up having to add some cumin, oregano and coriander at the end).

this wasn't what I thought it would be, but it was tasty.  I'd call it more of a chicken CHILI, but that's semantics!  forgot the corn, darn it, used pinto & kidney beans (boyfriend got the wrong "chili" beans), threw in some green chiles, and since I NEVER used prepared taco seasoning, I just dumped loads of chili, garlic, dried cilantro, cumin & onion powder.  it was better day two with hot corn bread!  yum!

I used your recipe as a base. Once I was done, my version barely resembled the original, only due to what I had on hand, and suiting my family's preferences.  I mixed in some cheese spread with the chicken broth, used a can of black beans, a can of tomato sauce, the spices described in a review posting, 3 Tbsp cream cheese, shredded chicken, and about 2/3 cup corn.  It ended up too spicy for my kids, so I added about 1/4 cup brown sugar which mellowed it out, and gave it a pleasant sweetness.  Thanks!

This is a GREAT soup!  I strongly recommend using the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe vs. a taco seasoning package because I've made it both way and it makes a huge difference!

I made this soup today and used chicken broth in lieu of the beer.  was very good and flavorful.  next time I will use ground chicken as I didn't like the texture.

This is the second time I have made this recipe.  The first time I doubled (whoa, needed two crock pots, and it made ALOT, but I have a family of seven) this time I made the way it was written.  The first time I also used Bill Echols taco seasoning from this site like many other reviewers suggested.  I LOVED it and my family ate it.  BUT alot of them commented on the spiciness.  I used the Taco Bell seasoning packet this time.  Only confusion I have is whether I should drain/rinse the black beans, what does everyone else use.  BTW my 3 year old, picky eater, LOVES this.

I LOVE this recipe! This has become a standard and is probably one of the best things I make. I always use beer, and find that a darker beer generally creates a greater depth of flavor. This is seriously yummy!

Excellent!  We made a few modifications to reduce the sodium content (salt free beans/veggies) and added some jalapeno peppers to taste.  Also used Ro*tel tomatoes w/cilantro & lime juice because that's what I had on hand and a separate can of chilies.  Wonderful!

This is a delicious recipe!  I have made it several times as written and also used it as a base with variations.  One thing I always add is cumin and use the spicy varities of ingredients (sour cream really cools it down for those who don't like it as spicy).  Overall, delicious and my husband, a very picky eater, loves it as well.

I replaced the beer with water. Mistake. I should have replaced it with chicken broth because the end result was good but kind of bland and missing that certain flavor. So next time I make this it'll be chicken broth instead of beer.

We loved this one; I was a little worried about the beer, but it gave the soup a great flavor. We didn't bother cooking raw chicken breasts - instead we bought and shredded the meat from two rotisserie chickens so we wouldn't have to wait all day to eat it. We also sauteed the onion in a little olive oil to brown it and soften it up. It was really delicious, and the soup has a little kick to it. We'll definitely make this one again. We topped ours with crushed baked tortilla chips and low-fat sour cream, and it was delicious.

Very Good! My husband wouldn't try it, but I loved it! I used 12 oz of chicken broth in place of the beer. Excellent. I added shredded taco cheese and tri color tortilla strips. I had two 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes, I only used one, next time I will use both, it will make more broth. My daughter thought it was spicy. I used the taco seasoning recipe, which was excellent, next time I may omit the salt, since there is plenty of salt in the canned beans.

This recipe was SO GOOD!  As some others I used chicken broth instead of beer.  It was also so easy to make!  I put all my ingredients in the crock pot before work and came come to a delicious meal!  The recipe made a lot!  At least for one person! :p I'm glad I liked this because I'll be eating it for the next week!

This recipe is wonderful!  I left out the beer and did not use chicken stock and it cooked more like a Chilli.  It was really great with Tortilla Chips.  Love it, will definately be making it again!  It makes alot so i'm freezing some.  Too much for just 2 people to eat.

Simple, inexpensive and exploding with taste and texture.  One would not think that a meal made from can can be so good.  I highly recommend anyone with no time and a hankerin' for a thick and hearty soup try this one out for size.  I rate it four [out of five] ladles!  rdh

This was a very hearty soup. I wanted to make it exactly as written before I tried altering it. Next time I would not use beer, I hate beer and it left a weird after taste. Everyone in the family liked it so I'm sure ill make it again at some point with the chicken broth as other reviewers have suggested.

As a soup it was good and very simple. Turned the leftovers into nachos and they were very good. Just drained the liquid from the soup and put the rest on top of tortilla chips, topped with cheese and melted in the oven. Put salsa, sweet chile sauce and sour cream on before serving.

I have made this many times and it is fantastic.  I have used thawed chicken and frozen chicken and either way, it turns out great.

This recipe was good, but not as great as I thought it would be. I think it had a little too much of a tomato flavor for us. The only substitutions we made were chicken broth for the beer and added a little cumin for flavor. For ease of preparation, I give it 5 stars, but for taste, I'd only give it 4.

Wow! I had been hesitant in trying this one. Wasn't sure if my family would like it. Well, it is fabulous, we all loved it!! I made another batch the next day to have for lunches. I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used Bud Light in this, not too strong of a taste, but there was flavor from it which was interesting, but in a good way.  My mom loved it and couldn't stop talking about it, and she doesn't like beer!  A great recipe for when it's cold outside.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe with lots of yummy flavor. I followed the recipe only using chicken broth instead of beer. My husband and 4 year old daughter loved it and we had it for lunch the next day too. Great recipe!

I did not like the beer in the recipe.  I think chicken broth would taste better.  I will try making it again using chicken broth and adding some cumin.  It definately needed more seasoning.

Great! I made a big pot of this to have family over, and even the kids liked it! I wasn't sure about chilli beans, so I used one can of kidney beans, one can black beans, and about half a can of great northers we had left over. I followed the suggestion to make my own taco seasoning, and I really think that's what made the dish! Perfect mild-medium heat. I used bone-in chicken breasts cause that's all I had, and it worked perfectly.

This recipe has been a fantastic addition to our dinner menus.  We love it.  I replace the beer w/water instead.  I have many girlfriends and coworkers who have used this recipe and loved it, too.  We just keep passing it on!  Thanks Patti for the delicious, easy and inexpensive dinner!

This was easy and has a wonderful taste. It is almost thick enough to put on taco shells if you want to.  When I took it to work for lunch, the aroma was so wonderful my co-workers all wanted to try it. I used Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning I for the spices.  I don't like the sodium in packaged taco mix.

This turned out yummy! My boyfriend likes his food super spicey so i made sure i put extra spices in it. I used Ranch style and black beans and doubled the recipe as well.  I did use the beer, wasn't sure what kind to use so i figured I couldn't go wrong with Stella. Topped it off with some cheese, sour cream and cut up an avocado.

Very delicious & satisfying. We did add more cumin but that is the beauty of this recipe -- gives you a great dish you can fine-tune to your taste. A dash of seasoning salt on each serving seems to bring out the flavours. An instant family favourite and one that will be made again and again! Thx for this terrific recipe.

I thought this had great flavor.  I made it without any changes and it was great.  I loved it with the sour cream and cheese on top, so the the next time I made it I added 8 oz. of cream cheese at the end and it was very good.  Thanks for the post I will be making it again.

So easy and so delicious! I did omit the beer and added more chicken broth. Also used a package of Ol El Paso taco seasoning, worked perfect. Only problem was that I didn't have enough leftovers...everyone asked for seconds!!! Thank you for sharing.

I browned a pound of ground beef in place of the chicken. That way it only needs to cook for an hour on the stove so all the flavors blend together, rather than making it an all day event. I also added a package of chili seasoning IN ADDITION to the taco seasoning. Of course I dumped a ton of Tabaso and Crystal hot sauce in it for spice. It came out REALLY good!

We made this recipe exactly as stated. It was wonderful, just a little spicy for us. Next time I will add half plain diced tomatoes and half with peppers.

super good soup.  Yum!  I used frozed chicken breasts because I forgot to thaw and it worked out great.  The meat was really tender.  I have been looking for a good soup.  I will definitely make again.

This was a big hit with my family! It was so easy to make which makes it a hit with me. I used the taco seasoning recipe RaisinKane aka Patti suggested. We ate it over corn chips and it was great! We ate it over spanish rice and it was great! Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this again.

I think the beer definitly adds another layer of flavor. Usually use Corona. I have made it with chicken stock and it tasted fine- but different.

I make this over and over again whenever my freezer runs out of leftovers!  It's so good as is and the only change I've made is I use mexican style spicy tomato sauce, but it's not necessary.  It makes a ton and freezes and reheats beautifully.  I did find I need to cook the chicken a little longer before shredding (shredding it before it's fully cooked is much harder) but that's it!  Other than that it's a simple, healthy, delicious soup.

I made this and also the ingredients sounded like a good dish, it was lacking in flavor, I have not fined tuned it, maybe some 1 to 2 Tbl cumin and maybe cut back on liquid, slow cookers don't need as much liquid, so the flavors would intensify. The cheese and sour cream did help significantly.

Could NOT be happier with this recipe! Talk about easy! I followed the recipe pretty much to a T but ended up using about 3/4 bottle of Corona and added 1 cup of water with 1tsp of chicken bullion dissolved. Just used a 1oz store bought package of taco seasoning as well. The taste was fantastic! And it's so filling. Looking forward to the left-overs for tomorrow's lunch. This, I think, will become one of my staple dishes!

AMAZING. I have been craving it since I made it the first time. It does come out thick like a stew, so I ended up adding a little more liquid. Can't beat the taste though. Thanks!

Easy to make and reheats well.  I added a little sugar & it topped it off wonderfully.

This was fantastic and it could not have been easier to make!  I made it exactly according to the recipe, including the sour cream, cheese, and crushed chips.  My 5 year old son and husband both had multiple bowls.   This very well may take the place of my favorite chili recipe. Thanks so much!

We ate it with tortillas and lots of sour cream.  Very tasty and very easy to prepare.  I cooked it on the regular stove top, at the lowest temperature for several hours.

The soup was quite good without the sour cream, taco chips and cheese, but is OUTSTANDING when these are added, as they mute and somewhat cream the sharp taco seasoning.

This was fabulous. I tried it in the crock pot, then the second time I made it, I cooked it on the stove in about an hour. I broiled the 3 chix breasts in the oven using low heat. It took about 45 minutes. I simmered the rest of the ingredients while they cooked. Then I chopped the chicken and added it. Let it simmer a couple minutes and serve. Great!

This was so delicious I ate it for a week straight for dinners!  I made it exactly as the recipe said, except I also added a little Tabasco (few drops) and some chili powder at the beginning.  Topped with plenty of shredded cheese, and ate it with nacho chips.  This was so simple, and tasted so good!  It also reheats really well in a saucepan on the stove top.

Thank you so much for providing the taco seasoning recipe!  I'm severely allergic to MSG, which has 21 other names, and packaged seasonings always have it.  Thanks!

Pretty good. I used the suggested homemade taco seasoning. But I felt this made the soup taste more like chili. I still liked it though. I put all ingredients in the crockpot before work and then shredded the chicken and stirred in after work and served almost immediately. Also, I used chicken broth instead of beer. Will make again.

We absolutely loved it! I made this chili on the stove with a few changes. I didn't have any beer and substituted with 1 c. chicken broth and used canned chicken breast that was shredded before adding to the pot. Used 1 can black beans and 1 can pinto since that was what I had on hand. The taco seasoning recipe was fabulous and will use it from now on! At the end of cooking I did add a little cornstarch w/water to slightly thicken. Great flavor and hearty meal! Total cooking time was about 1/2 hour. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for supper last night and I'll use it again, I used chicken stock instead of beer, just because I had no beer in the house and crushed tomatoes instead of diced for the same reason. Very quick, very easy and tasty too, though I like Kdayne's idea of the lime juice. Thank you

This soup was good enough.  I probably won't make it again but there wasn't anything bad about it.  My family just wasn't crazy about it.  I'm sure other people will like it.

This is wonderful.  I used pinto beans since I don't care for black beans.  I also used 15 oz tomato sauce since that was the size of can I had and didn't want to waste it.  I used frozen thighs and cooked it for about 9+ hours and then shredded the chicken.  Can't wait to make again.

This soup is the best!!! I actually called it Chicken Taco Chili because of all the beans and mine came out kinda thick. Then adding the cheese and sour cream makes it!  I have made it several times and we absolutley love it!

My husband loved this.  I dumped everything in the crock pot on the way out the door.  I didn't have time to add onions.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  My husband made me print out the recipe for a lady at work.  He took some for lunch the next day.  Excellent.  I will make this again.

didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker.  boiled the chicken breasts with some onions and celery. meanwhile, sauteed the onions in oil in a pot on stove then added the rest of the ingredients.  shredded the chicken and added it to the pot.  simmered for about 2 hours.  terrific.

Ooooo yummy!  I made this today for the first time.  It's super super melty great.  My best suggestion: USE THE BEER.  The alcohol and 'beery' taste cooks off - it leaves the greatest flavor - truly unique.  Like others, I used two full packets of taco seasoning (4 T total), and added some cumin and chili powder.  I also added 3 huge cloves of garlic.  I used pinto beans instead of chili beans.  Other than this, I followed the recipe exactly. It's really a treat.  I will make this again for sure.

This is a fantastic recipe! I never have any leftovers. All my picky eaters love it as well. I just add 8oz of Monterey Jack cheese when I put the shredded chicken in and it finishes it off to perfection.

This is a very good recipe. I was short on time so I cooked this on the stove and let it simmer for 30min. Will make this again. Very good with sour cream and cheese and tortilla chips!

EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe as is, with the exception of substituting chicken broth for beer and using diced tomatoes WITHOUT green chiles (personal preference). Delicious and so easy! I love that you don't have to precook the chicken. Everything goes into the pot, the flavors all blend together, and you end up with a flavorful, hearty soup. I topped it with Fage (greek yogurt) instead of sour cream and crushed tortilla chips and they were the icing on the cake. I will make this again and again!

This recipe is a fav at our house! We do change it a bit by not adding onions, can of tomato sauce or beer, but we do add a bit of jalapeño sauce to give it an extra kick, along with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. When the soup is ready we serve it on top of cooked rice as well. My brother got a crock pot for Christmas last year and his girlfriend said this had to be the 1st thing they cooked. Yummmmy!

This was very good!  I did however, make it on the stove-top instead of the crockpot and it turned out great (even better the next day!). I let it simmer on low for about an hour and I also added some cumin,fresh garlic, and a can of nacho cheese soup (as another cook suggested) and it was awesome.  The beer gives it a robust undertone.  This will definately be a staple in our house.  Thanks for sharing!

YUM.  Made this for a party and everyone LOVED it.  Like most, I made a few modifications: I substituted a 12 oz. can of chicken broth for beer.  I used 3 packets of Sazon seasoning (found in the ethnic foods section) instead of taco seasoning.  I used frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 10 hours.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This will be a regular meal at our home.  My family loved it. I used chicken broth instead of beer and frozen corn instead of canned. I plan to try the taco seasoning recipe, but this time I used a packaged mix.

This soup was great! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a can of low sodium chicken broth instead of the beer and used a can of Hot Rotel. I also added about 2 tbsp of sour cream to the entire pot to add some richness as well as a little bit of cheese. The tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream on top is a must!

My family loves this recipe.  It is sooo easy and fast to make.  To make it faster, I use rotisserie chicken already baked from the groc. store.  Then I just throw all the other ingred. into a large pot for a few hours.  Yummo

Oh num! Eating this is like being hugged! Instead of the tomatoes with chilis I used regular canned diced tomatoes and finely diced 3 jalapenos (seeds, ribs and all since they seemed mild). Turned out to be the right amount of heat for me. I also used the submitter's suggestion for the taco seasoning ("Taco Seasoning I" on this site) which was very good, but I added some extra oregano. Used the entire recipe of that seasoning (I like things highly seasoned). Otherwise kept to the recipe. Used Becks beer, kind of a pricey import but gooooood. I'll be making this often.

This recipe is pure gold, always a crowd pleaser and there is always demands for seconds so I make a double batch (doubling all ingredients except the chicken.) I have made this with PBR, Corona, and chicken broth and each time it was still delicious despite the variances.

Very good!  We followed the recipe to a T.  The only change was that the chicken was ready to shred an hour early, so it cooked for only 6 hours instead of the 7 stated in the recipe.  There was a split in our house as to whether the soup was too spicy.  I liked it and I don't care for real spicy food.

Very delicious.  I made the taco seasoning that the recipe submitter suggested; used that entire quantity in the soup.  Leftovers were just as good too.  Tortilla chips are a must for me with this---I scooped the soup with them like it was a dip.  I'd prefer this soup any day over queso dip!

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  I had initially chosen it for him, as I am not a huge fan of spicy or black beans, but I liked it so much we will have it again as leftovers tonight!  The only deviations I made were as follows:  Didn't have the beer so I left it out.  Instead of packaged taco mix I used one that I made from the taco seasoning recipie on this website, it's great!!!  I added just about a tbsp. of the seasoning.  It had just enough spice for him and not too much for me.  I put everything in the crockpot at once and cooked for 4 1/2 hours, it came out perfect!!!

I mistakenly forgot to add the tomato sauce, but despite that, this turned out really well. I didn't cook as long as directed either - six hours was more than enough time. The chicken was tender and shredded easily, and the extra zip from the taco seasoning (I used McCormick's original) was just enough to keep it lively. I served it with a nice handful of shredded cheddar and crushed tortilla chips, and it was a hit. Will definitely make again.

Good tasting soup, but my family didn't really care for the beer taste.  Next time I'll make with chicken stock instead.

I usually use another Taco Soup recipe made w/ a few diff. ingredients. I thought this receipe was very good - although it seemed like it could use a little more kick for my family's taste. This recipe is a keepter and I will def. make this again.

I only gave this recipe four stars as it isn't the absolute best ever. That being said it is a good recipe..pretty hard to mess this one up. I took the others advice and used chicken broth rather than beer. It turned out great, served it with fresh cornbread out of the oven and hubby and myself really enjoyed it. Will make again

I loved this recipe...we like our food a lil spicier so i used 2 pkgs of the taco seasoning mix instead of one.  ~~I was short on time and cooked on high for 4hrs instead of low for 7 and it was perfect :)

Love this recipe!!  I have made it a couple of times now and each time I get many compliments.  I did exactly as written accept used chicken broth instead of beer.  The chicken pulled apart so easily and was so tender after a few hours.  Served with tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheese.  Just spicy enough for our taste.  Thanks for the recipe! *Update* have been adding 1 tsp each of chili powder, garlic powder and cumin.  Didn't think it could get any better but this adds some depth.

Very, very tasty and easy!  I used frozen chicken breasts and it turned out perfectly.  I added all ingredients without draining and there was plenty of liquid, so I omitted the beer.  I also sprinkled in some garlic powder and cumin. Served with a salad, cheese and chips.

I love the concept, and it was a hit with my Mexican roommates!  I detected this weird bitter/sour background note, which I attribute to the beer, per other reviewers.  Next time, I will use white wine or chicken stock. Also, I think there was a little too much onion, so I would chop up a smaller one.  I would also just dump in one container of salsa (reduce the liquid) instead of two, and I would add some garlic.  So, with some minor tweaking, this is an excellent crockpot dish, and I would make it again.

This was great! So easy and turned out delicious. I used Newcastle Ale and Lawry's taco seasoning. Didn't alter a thing.  Will be one of my staple recipes. Thank you! UPDATE: I've made this several more times using the seasoning blend recipe. It just keeps getting better!

Very tastey! I added a rinsed and drained can of black beans, an additional cup of water and a chicken bouillon. Also at the end, squeezed in the juice of half a lime. Delish!

This soup is over the top! I kept hearing mmmm this is sooo good...music to my ears! I added a can of ranch style beans w/jalapeno's, garlic and cilantro. I used turkey, rather than chicken,and topped with homemade tortilla strips...very, very good! Will certainly make again and again. Thanks for sharing!

This was very easy and delish!  Didn't really change anything, only added 1/2 bottle of beer b/c wasn't sure if they kind I had would work (fruity wheat beer).  I served it over rice and it was very hearty.  This is a keeper.

Well . .. this recipe already had so many reviews that I hadn't planned on adding my own, but ... YUM!  I only altered to save myself a trip to the store . . .used 2 cans of black beans and no chili beans.  I used a 7 oz. Budweiser and about 2 c. of chicken stock.  I boiled and shredded the chicken and added it to all the other ingred. that were in the crock pot to speed things up.  It was a gigantic hit.

This was a hit!  I added garlic powder and cumin, used kidney beans instead of chili or black beanss..did not like the beer taste (and I LOVE beer) but it could be because all I had on hand was Miller High Life...I added more tomato sauce and it took care of the beer twang.  I used a little more chicken and this made a LOT!  Fed it to company and froze a bunch.  It was great!

Alone, this recipe is very delicious (5 stars!), however, I added a few things the second time I made this soup and it turned out even better (worthy of 10 stars). I cooked it on high over the stove for 1.5 hours with already cooked chicken ("Boiled Chicken" recipe on this site) added a full bundle of fresh chopped cilantro, left out the chili beans, added 1/4 cup of lime juice, 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, 1 bottle of beer, and used several shakes of cayenne pepper and chili powder to really bring out the heat of the soup. This recipe is such a wonderful and hearty dish, and can be modified to your liking. I don't like to measure ingredients but instead just throw things in as I go (tasting in between). Thanks a lot for this recipe -- it is definitely a keeper!

This is pretty good, I didn't have a bottle of beer on hand, so I substitute some tequila and chicken broth. 1/2 and 1/2.

this recipe is absolutely amazing. i cooked this for my fiance and he raved about it. i took some other reviewers advice and i used broth instead of beer. would like to try it with beer as i do love it. but there is nothing better than taking 15 minutes to throw ingredients in a slow cooker and walk away. a must for every persons recipe book!!

This recipe is so simple and really delicious! I used tomato soup instead of paste because it was all I had on hand, and I also used chicken stock instead of the beer, and it turned out awesome.  My boyfriend (a picky eater) said it was the best soup he has ever had and requested that I make it every night for him!

Only one out of 4 of us liked this soup.  It was easy but really just seemed like a soupy version of chili with chicken instead of beef.  The flavor was good.  I had high hopes because of the rating...dissapointing.

Awesome recipe!! I'm from a family of great cooks and rarely get recipes that I end up loving from sources other than family, but this one is now in my arcenal!!  I had to change some things according to what I had on hand but I loved the end result:  I used 2 cans of white northern beans instead of black beans and chili beans and tomato juice (didn't measure...about 3 cups) instead of tomato sauce, because that's what I had.  I also used chicken stock I had frozen from previously roasting a chicken instead of beer.  And, I used some leftover green pepper, onion, and celery I had sauted the night before and had left over (that added a lot of flavor!). I used the recommended taco seasoning mixture but halved the crushed red pepper.  I only had about 4 1/2 hours instead of the recommended 7 hrs, so I did the following to speed things along:  seasoned both sides of the chicken breasts with the taco seasoning and then sauted them in a little margarine to get it going.  I then combined everything in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 1/2 hrs.  The meat was still tender and fell apart and had great flavor!  I like things spicy and, even with reducing the crushed red pepper flakes to 1/2 the amount, this was still just a little too spicy.  I don't mean to insult the original cook by changing the recipe so much but I had to work with what I had!  I'M SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS RECIPE!!  DELICIOUS!!

I am a single person and cooking is a pain. But during the winter this is my go to recipe. I absolutely love it. I followed recipe but left out the onions. This is a keeper for sure. One chicken breast with half of each canned item and Ive got a healthy warm meal for one with leftovers.

I have made this many times. It's quick, easy, and VERY good. When I made it the first time my daughter watched and thought it looked gross. When it was done, she carefully tried it and then ate three bowls! I have had two people tell me it's the best soup/chili they have ever had. This is a keeper!!

Good with sour cream.  Also, I used chicken broth instead of beer and added garlic, cyanne pepper and cumin.

This is a great recipe as-is.  My only change was that I used leftover fried chicken (skin removed) because that's what I had.  I could taste the beer, but I thought it was good.  However, I would be willing to use chicken broth if I didn't have the beer and I think it would work just as well.  This was particularly good with the suggested toppings.

This was just okay.  I was looking something to put together for the family since I had to work late.  I cut up the chicken so they didn't have to shred it later and that worked fine.  Just wasn't our favorite.

I guess I am just a wuss.  This was waaaaaaay too hot for my taste.  I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning from this site like others suggested.  I loved the flavor and textures, but can't enjoy it because of the heat.  I will make this again, but I will leave out the red pepper flakes from the taco seasoning and only use one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.

We only had a 15oz can of tomatos, and a 5 oz can of green chilis. Worked out fantastic! Really easy to make as well. Will definitely make again.

I used the Bill Echol's taco seasoning.  Really good, but really warm mouth feel.  I substituted 2 cans of chicken broth for beer (we were out).  This made the concoction one step up from Stew.  Will probably keep the 2 cans of broth next time AND add the beer!

This was fantastic!  Much more flavor than your average chili.  I didnt want to risk using beer and not liking it, so I just used chicken broth.  I made the recommended taco seasoning but cut back to 1/8 tsp red pepper and it was still pretty spicy.  My husband raved about this recipe and invited all his buddies to come eat it!

This soup was delicious! The chicken is very tender and melts in your mouth. We topped ours with low fat sour cream, cilantro, and lime flavored tortilla chips. The pale ale we used gave it a great taste. A definite keeper!

I did 2.5 hours on high, tore up chicken, then 2.5 hours on low and it was great.  The spice recipe is not a big effort - and so worth it! Only change next time is to add an extra can of chili beans.  I served it with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site, a winning combo, loved by all!

Easy recipe but did not like the beer taste, probably should have substituted the chicken broth like others had suggested. Not a ton of flavor.

WOW!!  This was insanely good.  Used broth instead of beer, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Not sure what people mean about lack of flavor, because it was fabulous (and super easy).  This will become a new staple in my house4!!

This was amazing! Still eating the leftovers today for lunch. I was so sad to be full after only the first bowl! I left out the corn because I didn't want the sweetness, and I replaced the beer with a can of chicken broth. I also used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of 8 oz., and I squeezed in the juice of one lime. I also used frozen chicken breasts. Cooked on low for 3 hours, then kicked it into high for another 2 hours as I was pressed for time. Don't skimp on the sour cream and cheese...it really makes this dish!

I was very hesitant in making this soup. But it kept being recommended on the recipe exchange with rave reviews. So...I finally made it. And I was glad I did.  The only change I made was with the taco seasoning. I made my own from a recipe on this site and it made it outta sight. I also added some chopped pickled jalepeno. (we like spicy) My first bowl I had just on it's own and I thought..this is pretty good.  My SECOND bowl I added the sour cream and a little grated cheese and BAM...Really really good.  Thanks everyone for recommending it over and over and over again. Now I'll be doing the same.

I'm SO pleased to write my first review for this fabulous soup!  I tried it the first time because I had everything on hand, and now I make SURE to have everything on hand because it's so full of flavor and truly could not be easier to make.  A few ideas: 1) using frozen diced onions, which I always keep on hand, makes it super-quick; 2) I love it with cheddar, sour cream, and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro over the top--the cilantro gives it more dimension; 3) if you're not a fan of beer, or would prefer not to use it, a can of chicken broth is a great substitute; and 4) I put everything in for 4 hours on high, shredded the chicken, stirred it all up, and enjoyed it right away.   Yum, yum, yum!  This is, literally, dumping cans into a crock pot, with no prep time at all, and results in a hearty, flavorful meal!

Very good, quick, easy recipe.  I did the Bill Echols taco seasoning which was really good!  I did rinse the beans - even though it didn't say to do that- and I also did half beer, half chicken broth. I kind of freaked out while pouring the beer because it was an Pale Ale and I wasn't sure how that would taste.  But it was gooooooood - and it was spicy - in a good way.  I will definitely make this again.

I served this at a dinner party and it was received with rave reviews. I was asked for the recipe and have since been asked to make it again for my boyfriend. The best part is that it isn't fattening and loaded with flavor. I fixed it just as the recipe says.

This was AWESOME! I changed a few things like substiting beer with low sodium chicken stock, and used lower sodium black beans, no salt added corn, and lower sodium taco seasoning. I also just used 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. My husband loved it and so did my kids. It was great! We eat it atleast once a week now.

I've made this recipe a lot!  It is so easy and always a big hit!  I usually use chicken broth instead of beer though.  I don't think it makes much of a difference in the flavor, and I figure it has fewer calories that way.

I made this tonight for my family... 3 kids ranging in ages & hubby.  It was so yummy! Even my youngest who is very very picky ate it up.  It wasn't spicy in the least (although my hubby and I would have liked it spicier... but kept it mild for the kids) I used pinto beans instead of chili beans (couldn't find them here in Canada) and added a small amt of green chilies as I also couldn't find diced tomatoes with them already added.  I used chicken broth (as others had mentioned) instead of the beer.  With the sour cream, cheddar cheese and chips, it was a fun meal.  Thanks for sharing this... p.s it was my first meal in my brand new slow cooker.  Will make it for years to come, I'm sure.

This turned out well.  I left out the onion, because I hate soups with onion in them, and substituted dried onion.  It definitely has some bite to it, but I thought it was very good.  As with most soups, this one was better the next day.

Loved it, it was so easy to prepare. This is on the spicy side, but we love spicy foods. I think I even used frozen onions - so only the chicken had to be prepared ahead. It freezes really well, too.

Fantastic soup.  The only thing I found was I could taste the beer.  Not a problem for me but some might not like an entire bottle in it.  I diced up the chicken and mixed it into the soup and let it cook that way.  Next time I will try to shred it so there is more chicken throughout the soup as opposed to chunks.  Family loved it.  My father in law wanted the recipe to take home so he could make it.  That is the ultimate compliment!

My husband loved this recipe! I was missing black beans and tomatos, and it still turned out great. Instead of black beans I used a can of Chili Con Carne Beans, with plain chili beans. The following night we ate the left overs over chips like nachos.

This has quickly become one of our favorite meals! I will admit, the first time I made it, I left out the onion and tomato sauce (didn't have any) and used chicken broth rather than the beer - we loved it so much that way that we keep making it the same. I used chicken breast tenders and it works wonderfully (don't need the extra step of shredding and continuing to cook for 2 hours - we just shred it in the crockpot right at the end). We use mild chili beans and mild Rotel tomatoes w/chilies and it still has plenty of zip! Yum yum!

Very yummy soup! I omitted the beer (no one in the house drinks it and I wasn't going to buy it just for this) but it was still fantastic. Everyone loved it!

I thought this turned out great.  I had the soup cook overnight so it smelled great this morning.  I did make a couple of minor changes. I didn't have any chili beans so I just used two cans of black beans.  I also didn't have any canned corn so I used frozen corn instead.  Plan on serving this tonight with warm corn tortillas.

First of all let me say that I don't really eat meat or soups. Now let me say that this recipe is out of this world! I had two bowls of it myself! My husband said he has never tasted anything like it before. He loved it!! The only problem I had with the recipe is that I should have made a double batch!!!!I will definitely make it regularly!!!!

Perfect, very easy to follow recipe.  I did add some black beans and used tortilla chips instead of the corn tortillas.  My 6 year old asked for seconds.

I followed the recipe as written and was disappointed. I could taste the beer and it was too spicy. I stirred in some sour cream and that tamed the spice a bit, but I think next time (if there is a next time) I won't use the tomatoes with chilis and replace the beer with chicken broth.

I am not a big fan of stews and vegetable type soups but this soup is outstanding! We love it!  It has such a great flavor! If I don't have a can of beer around, I use 12oz of chicken broth.

I am in a group that meets each week to pray with other mothers for our children, the schools, and teachers in our town. (Moms In Touch, Int.) We decided to make soup for the teachers as a treat.  I made this soup and when we went to pick up the crock pot it was empty.  I tasted it early on in the process and could taste the beer, but just wait it cooks off and taste wonderful.  God bless and Thank you.

This was a HUGE hit at my table!! We gobbled it right down. I used the home made version of taco seasoning as suggested by the recipe's author in the reviews. I used 1 can of healthy request cream of chicken soup + 1/2 can reduced sodium fat free chicken broth in place of the beer (didn't have any)..I can't wait to make this again

I have been using this recipe since February of '06 when I emailed it out to all of my friends recommending it. It is awesome! It always a favorite at Bunko and potlucks and a quick dinner when we have company from out of town.   My husband hates beer, yet loves this soup! I love beer, so the kick that the beer gives it is welcomed. I've made it without before and hubby and I agree, it tastes like it's missing something.  I make it with chicken or ground beef.   Mine gets thicker when it goes in the fridge, so leftovers are perfect on top of a salad.

This was a 5 star on the ease of the recipe.  I also used Bill's taco seasoning mix.  My boyfriend loved this recipe. My sons and I thought it was "good".  I'm making it again today with a regular envelope of taco seasoning to see if there is any difference.

Good soup.  I used chunks of chicken instead of shredding.  Today we are eating the leftover soup ontop of baked potatoes.

This was incredible! I left out the tomato sauce and just used a big can of Rotel. It was rather spicy and not very family-friendly, so next time I'll try the recipe as printed or use the mild Rotel. The beer is a must! I used amber bock, since my DH doesn't like it and refuses to drink it. The leftovers freeze well, so you can have some for later!

This is the first soup I have ever made and it was awesome!  I did use beer (Fat Tire), but added a cube of chicken bullion to it, it tasted fantastic.  I don't dig on onion, so that was omitted, but fresh cilantro was added, along with some lime for serving.  I will be making this for my next party!

My family thought this recipe was outstanding...the best I've made using all recipes.  I did not care for it as much.  I could still taste the beer in it and I hate the taste of beer.  I gave it 4 stars because everyone else really liked it.

this was a good recipe.  reminded me and my husband a lot of chili.  we ate it with sour cream and cheese. there was just soo much of it.  i feel like i could have done without one of the cans of beans and some of the liquid.  overall very good though.

Very tasty, but I will next time add only half an onion instead the entire thing, I found that it overwhelmed the soup. Also, I think I will try the half beer and half broth idea...it sort of took over rather complimented the soup for my taste. Also I added garlic powder, chili powder, and a touch of cumin powder. Then made an additional topping of chopped avocado at the end...Yummy! Overall a great meal!

This is one of those rare recipes that is just perfect the way it is. I also love that it's so simple and easy--the only "work" part is dicing the onion.  I have made it both in the slow cooker and--when I decided to make it last minute--on the stovetop (and still turns out just as good).  I like the beer in it, but only use about half a can (mostly so my kids don't freak) and eyeball some chicken broth so that it's a little more soupy than stew-y. I also use the taco seasoning I recipe.  Don't forget the cheese and sour cream--it finishes it off nicely!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is excellent though pretty mild.  I added a little cayenne pepper and about 1 T. cumin.  That made it good for me.  Husband added Tapatio to heat it up even more.  Very good though!

One word - AMAZING!!  My whole family loved this recipe!  I was hoping for some leftovers to take for lunch during the week, but there weren't any left!!  I did realize after I made it that I forgot to put the 12 oz beer in the recipe, but the good news is it still turned out great!  I can't wait to make this again and see what the beer will add to it!

This recipe was wonderful!  I used kidney beans instead of chili beans, and a red onion since I had just a little yellow onion left.  The last 20 minutes or so, I left the lid off so the liquid would reduce, and I added some broken up pieces of lime & salt tortilla chips to the ingredients.  My husband is not particularly fond of chicken; however, he thought this dish was very good!  I can hardly wait to take some to work!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

Fantastic! I have always made my Taco Soup with ground turkey or lean ground beef. This recipe is much more hearty and filling with less fat and calories. I recommend using the Taco Seasoning recipe other readers have stated.

This recipe was very good. I've never done a taco type soup before so I decided to give this a shot. I didn't have some ingredients on hand, so I just used two cans of black beans, one can of regular diced tomatoes and a full can of tomato sauce. I also didn't have the seasonings on hand (except for taco seasoning) and this recipe was still delicious. I added garlic powder, salt, and red pepper flakes and it was very, very good. However, I do think the beer gave it a bit of a bitter taste, but I hate beer anyway. May try the chicken broth next time, but my husband LOVED it the way it was. Highly recommend serving with cheese and crushed taco shells/chips and any other dressings  you see fit. delicious

Everyone was excited to taste the soup after smelling it cook all-day in the crockpot, and it did not disappoint. It was delicious topped off with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and avacado. Followed the recipe exactly, and it had more of a thicker chili like consistency than soup, perfect for a chilly winter day.

This was a hit with my family, and it was so easy to put together.  I used no-salt-added canned corn and tomato sauce just to cut the salt down a bit, and no one missed it.  The leftovers were gone at lunch the next day.

Delicious and took only minutes to throw together! The recipe made a lot and our family of four enjoyed it for two days. We even made it more like a taco salad by serving it topped with thinly sliced lettuce and diced tomatoes in addition to the cheese and sour cream. A definite keeper in our home!

I made this yesterday, ate it today and it was pretty darn good.  I didn't have any beer, so I used chicken broth.  I didn't have black beans so I used cannellini beans.  I also substituted frozen corn for canned.  I will definately make this again.  Will probably tweak to add a little more flavor.

This recipe is all of my favorite things about recipes: 1.EASY 2. DELICIOUS 3. TASTES GREAT THE NEXT DAY!!! My boyfriend is really picky and he absolutely loved this soup. I added one can of broth instead of beer and it tasted great. It fills your house with a great spicy smell, too. However, the soup is quite mild. My boyfriend and I were both expecting a spicier soup. Next time, I'll add an extra packet of seasoning. It's great!!

This soup was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I only had one can of tomatoes. Instead of using a taco seasoning packet, I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site. I'll probably make it again.

I made this recipe yesterday.  I couldn't find diced tomatoes with green chilies so I used canned stewed tomatoes and a separate can of chopped green chilies.  I also used low sodium tomato sauce and taco seasoning to keep the salt to a minimum.  Next time I'll make the taco seasoning recommended but it was delicious this way too.  I topped it with some low fat sour cream and grated cheese and it added a lot of flavour.  Great recipe for this freezing cold weather and healthy too.  Thanks very much.

This was awesome!  I followed the recipe and was a little concerned at first that it was going to be too spicey.  As it cooked and the flavors mellowed it was just right.  A squeeze of lime and some fresh cilantro to brighten up each bowl as you serve.  Definitely a keeper and a good option for company.

I didn't change anything.  It was awesome.  I used Negra Modelo beer.  Had Monterey Pepper Jack for cheese which really gave it a nice kick.

Certainly not gourmet, byt SUPER EASY and delicious.  I didn't drain anything except the corn (per the recipe), but next time I would probably drain off more of the liquid from the other cans so it is more of a chili consistency.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I did use chicken broth instead of the beer.  The chicken turned out nice and juicy and the flavors blended really well together using the suggested taco seasoning mix.  Thank you for a great healthy recipe!!

This is excellent! I didn't use the beer instead I used 12 oz of chicken stock. I cooked it in my slow cooker on low for 6 hours,  the chicken just shredded easily with a fork. My husband ate it with tortillas like a taco with sour cream, cheese, and homemade guaq.

Wonderful flavor! I only made a few minor changes. I used frozen fajita style chicken, changed the tomato sauce to 1 28oz can crushed tomatos, and a 28oz can whole kernel corn not drained. Other than that left recipe as is. I used a bottle of Miller Lite. The beer is a must for flavor. Does not taste like beer at all but everything comes together to make a great tasting soup/chili flavor.Have Texas Pete, cheese and corn chips on hand to serve. Mmmmm Will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Great!  I used one pre-roasted chicken and cooked the ingredients, without chicken, the day before...just 5 hours. Next day added the pulled chicken and three more hours. Easy!

This soup is so good! I too used chicken stock instead of beer and substituted chili beans for kidney beans. I also add either a small jar of diced chilis or jalapenos. The first time I made this soup, I made it again the very next day so I could freeze individual sized portions to have on hand.

Loved this recipe!  I made it exactly as stated and everyone thought it was de-lish!  It has the taste of a chili in soup form.  Even the leftovers heated up yummy.  Will be making it again (and again!)

WOnderful, very very easy recipe that is very healthy too.  I would recommend substituting chicken broth for beer.  I also had to sub out canned tomatoes with chilies (too spicy for my boys)with reg toms and used pinto beans instead of chili beans - you can control the quality of the flavor better.  You can sub tomato paste and water for the can tomato sauce depending on what you have on hand.  Recipe makes almost a double batch - which is a bonus as this recipe freezes well.

This was very good.  I did follow the top review and made Bill Echols Taco Seasoning.  I used red kidney beans for the chili beans..and I also didnt have diced tomatoes w green chilis so I just bought a tiny can of green chilis and used half of that.  I too served with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheese and it balanced the heat nicely.  And how fun to scoop the soup with tortillas...YUM!!!This is a perfect superbowl or potluck dish that I cannot wait to try on my friends.  Thanks for the share!

My husband would give it a five. I however, thought it was a bit salty--I think it was the taco seasoning I used--next time I will use the seasoning the cook for this recipe recommended. I give it four stars. We added cilantro, cheese, sour cream and a huge dollup of homemade guacamole. That really helped with the saltiness for me.

I love this recipe and have taken it to friends.  I use substitute minced onions for fresh, broth for the beer, sometimes reduce the amount of taco seasoning, and blend the tomatoes with green chilis for picky children.  It is still just as delicious.

I expected this to be better than it than it was. I thought it was too salty, my parents thought it was too spicy and my husband would not touch it at all. I feel like I wasted my time and money. It just wasn't for us.

This is so delicious and healthy too! Chicken was frozen when I put it in at 10am, used Bill Echols taco seasoning, made extra, so good! to keep on hand.  After 5 hours on low, shredded the chicken it was amazingly tender, added some sea salt, cooked for another 2 hours, served with sr cream and mexican blend shredded cheese, husband devoured it, and it's great leftover :) I'd give it 4.9 stars if I could! Also, used chicken stock in place of beer.

Excellent!!  Made it exactly as recipe states.  Very good!  My kids even ate it which surprised me.  **NOTE**  When I manually calculated the calories and fat, it was much lower than it states here.  For 8 servings (which I think it actually makes more like 10 servings) the calories are 262 and 3.75 fat.

This was so good!!!  So easy - I can't believe how nice it turned out.  The only thing I didn't do was the beer and that was because my husband drinks weird dark beers that really may change the taste.  I used chicken broth instead.  It was great I will use it again - maybe for company, it was that delicious!  Thank you!

I would not use beer next time. After cooking on high for 5 hours, I could still taste the beer. Next time I will use chicken broth. Other than that it was great. Topped with sour cream, crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and cilantro.

made this easy recipe for dinner tonight for myself, hubby and kids..i would say it is very good if you love taco tasting soup, and good if you are a semi-fan of mexican..had a nacho soup at a friends house that i liked alot better with a cheesy base..this is more a tomato base..all in all, i would make it again maybe a few times a year..it is very filling i must say..one bowl and we were all stuffed..

Great flavor! I had to alter the recipe slightly because my crock-pot was too small, but it tastes great and hubby loves it!

Awesome! Put the chicken breasts in frozen cooked for 8 hours on low.  Took chicken breast out and cut into chunks, so tender. I like chunks better than shreds. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.

This was delicious! I used chicken broth insead of beer, and I used 1 can of Rotel and 1 of plain diced tomatos, and it was plenty spicy for me! I've been eating it all week for lunch, and occasionally dinner. I froze some too, and it thawed out just fine.I will definitely make this again!  I think next time I will put in less chicken and more beans, but that's just my preference.

Amazing!  This recipe is so simple and delicious.  I like spicy food so I usually toss in a 3-4 minced seeded habenero peppers.  If you remove the seeds, it's not too spicy.  Also a diced bell pepper or 2 small cans of mild green chilis adds a nice green color to contrast all the red, yellow and black.

This is pretty good but didn't 'wow' me. I prefer another taco soup recipe on this site as far as taste, but I do like the ease of the slow cooker.  I used Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning I from this site. I used mexicorn, one can of mexican stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes and added a tablespoon of chopped jalepenos.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a can of tomato soup plus 1/2 can of water. I cooked it on low for 5 hours, shredded the chicken and put it back as directed, then turned it on warm all night.

Excellent. It was Sunday and I forgot to buy the beer, so I didn't put it in. Turned out great anyway. Great to take for lunch too.

Excellent.  Followed a few other reviewers suggestions, like substituting the beer with chicken broth, adding a bit more spices (a shake or two of chili powder, cumin, garlic powder).  Perfect amount of flavor.  It was little watery right out of the crockpot, but thickened up nicely with sour cream.  Also, the day after as leftovers, it was perfect!

I'm a big cilantro fan and thought it might go well with this as an optional garnish, but for some reason, it didn't really mesh well with the soup.

This absolutely wonderful...I didnt have taco seasoning, but used the advice of another reviewer and added spices normally in taco seasong individually(paprika, blakc pepper, etc.) Also, I used "spicy" chili beans instead. I cooked in slow cooker for abour 6 hours, shredded chicken, and cooked for another 2-3 hours.

All I can say is:
Oh. My. Godfrey.

This is soooo good.

I added a can of refried bean at the end to thicken it up a bit.

For fun, I added some of the Hidden Valley Ranch dry mix.

But this is an awesome recipe!!!!

We loved the beer, we used Corona.

Excellent.  I made mine without the beer (I just didn't have any in the house) and it still turned out great!  So easy and everyone in my house liked it.  Definately a recipe I will put in the front of my stash!

I love this recipe and it has quickly become a staple at our house and with our friends.  I replace the chili beans with red kidney beans, replace the beer with chicken stock and cook on high for 3 hours or so before I tear the chicken.  One of our friends claims this is one of his top favorite meals of the year and the guys even requested this for a bachelor party weekend!

SUPER EASY AND SUPER TASTY!  I didn't want beer in my soup, so I used chicken broth.  I also used frozen chicken tenders and they cooked up nice and juicy and tender in the same amount of time.  Awesome recipe.

This recipe was delicious! I am so glad I came across it! My husband who NEVER eats any type of soup even helped himself to seconds, and my 9-year old daughter who tries to keep a good distance from any sort of vegetable gobbled up two bowls herself. I think I'll be bringing my slow-cooker to work to show off my cooking skills. I followed the recipe exactly (including the beer which I was nervous about) and am so glad I did. I am most excited that the next time I get a craving for tortilla soup I won't have to go to a restaurant. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I love this recipe.  I have made it twice in the last month and am going to make it again tomorrow.  It is so easy to make for a big group.  I just start it in the morning and it's ready when we are.  It's a great one-dish, no hassle meal.  I've had nothing but raving reviews. I make it exactly as stated with the exception of leaving out onions, using regular taco seasoning, and using chicken broth instead of beer.  Mmm.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go to recipe for days I don't feel like cooking. The only thing we do differently is we omit the beer (just add chicken stock). I've also used different types of beans and it still comes out great. Thanks for submitting this recipe!

We loved this and so easy.  The only change I made is adding a fresh jalepeno pepper and 2 cans of 15 oz diced tomatoes instead of tomatoes w/chili's. I used corona beer.  This is loaded with protein great for the start of the new year. You can alter the ingredients to light beer and low sodium taco seasoning.  You can bake fresh corn tortillas and lowfat chedder chez and ff sour cream.  I loved this.  What a treat. Especially on a cold icy winter Chicago evening.  Thank you my family is looking forward to this into our rotation.

All I can say is YUMMO!  Made the soup with chicken stock (personal preference) and kept everything else just as written.  My oldest son wouldn't touch it (he's not much of a soup lover).  My youngest son kept raving about it as he ate and my oldest finally gave in and tried it!!  Two full bowls later, I think I have a convert in the soup department.  I rounded out the meal with some cheese quesadillas and it made for a perfect cold, wintery evening meal.  Thanks for sharing!!

My family loved this recipe I used less beer than the recipe called for and cooked it on high in the slow cooker for a cook time of about 4.5 hours...This was really good!!!!! Michelle Gilbert, AZ

This was a good, cheap recipe. It would be easy to make a lot for a lot of people, and it really is a no-hassle recipe. I wouldn't make this to impress everyone, it seems more like a staple in most people's kitchen rather than a treat to dazzle guests.

I LOVE this recipe!! I followed it just as it said, and I think it's the best tortilla soup I've ever had!! The chicken turned out great, I think I'll even pull out some chicken and use it for enchiladas or something it's so good. My husband told me I'm not allowed to give any away because he wants it again for dinner this week. It's a really great recipe, and probably one of the easiest ever!! Some canned goods, chicken, and a seasoning packet...VERY simple. And the seasoning was just enough, I didn't have to guess and add my own, the taco seasoning worked perfectly. I will DEFINITELY be bringing this to potlucks from now on!!

Second try w/ this recipe.  This time I only used one 10 oz can of the Rotel brand green chiles/diced tomates and  did not use any tomato sauce.  But . . . I added another small can of green chiles, again, sans the diced tomatoes.   I thought it was a lot better this time -- it has a little kick, but it's good.  Last time it was way too acidic, too tomato-y, we're not huge tomato fans here.  I also used 2 cans of 99% f/free MSG/free chicken broth instead of beer which worked well.  Replaced the chili beans w/ pinto beans, which I also liked better.   Also used a MSG free taco seasoning.    Next time I'm going to go bold and use the beer instead of chicken broth.

Very good.  I made this on the stove top and doubled it.  I only used 1 packet of taco seasoning and used chicken broth instead of beer.  I also rinsed the black beans.I thought the flavor was good.  Not too salty.  I had some for luch today and thought it was better than yesterday.  I will be making this 
again.

I really, really like this soup.  It has become the tradition in our house to have this on Halloween before we go trick or treating.  It's so good and the sour cream allows for the kids to be able to handle the spiciness.  Very hearty.

This was perfect!  I used chicken broth in place of the beer and added a dash of cumin.  I also added 8 oz. light sour cream for the last 20 minutes in the crock pot, which made it smooth & creamy.  This is not a spicy soup, but very flavorful. Also used pinto beans & great northern beans.  Thank you for a great cold night meal!

This soup was so good.  I will be making it again.  I used 1/2 cup dried black beans and 1/2 cup dried kidney beans.  (I soaked them overnight.)  I also used frozen corn and frozen chicken.  I cooked the soup on high for 2 hours to cook the beans.  I also used chicken broth instead of beer.  Everything came out great.  I have already given the recipe to my neighbor.  Thanks for sharing this.

Very good and very easy to make.  I roasted my chicken and then put it into the soup.  THe soup is just a tad too hot for my taste buds but my husband loves it.

Great!  So easy and so filling. I replaced the beer with chicken broth like many others, and added velveta mexican cheese.  Was absolutely wonderful...oh and it made a ton, we both had one bowl and put the rest in the freezer for other meals!

I am rating this as I made it....same ingredients but I changed the "preparation" to try to trick my son into eating it.  Before adding the chicken I processed the whole thing in a food processor to "hide the beans".  We all liked it but my son ended up being ill and couldn't try it....so at this point I don't even know if it passed the fussy kid test.

this is a favourite!  i don't think i've ever had ALL the ingredients on hand so i do some basic substitutions like tomato sauce/diced tomatoes/tomato soup all interchangable for different textures.  it's always a hit and has become my winter company meal.  served with some piping hot cornbread and toppings like shredded cheese, lime slices, hot sauce!

My only issue with this soup is that it smelled like beer. 

On the plus side, my beer had lime in it, and it gave it an extra kick.

This soup is really good. I doubled the recipe but it didn't seem to need that much more chicken (I only used 4 boneless chicken breast HALVES and it was a LOT of chicken, even for double the other ingredients). However, it seemed like two packets of taco seasoning was too much. I could taste the taco seasoning, even after all those hours in the slow cooker. I would reduce the amount to 1 for doubling the recipe (so maybe only half a packet for the original recipe?).

I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts and it worked just fine.  My family loved this recipe.  We added a large spoonful of cooked rice to our bowl of soup, put tortilla chips on top with grated cheese and a dollup of sour cream and it was perfect for a cold wintery night.

This recipe is awsome.  My husband loved it and so did my 2 yr. old son!  I used mild everything and used chicken broth instead of the beer and I added a little garlic powder and kosher salt.  I have since forwarded on this recipe to all of my family and friends.  I will definatly make this again it was so easy to make!

This soup was a huge hit at my house. My husband liked it better than my taco soup with ground beef. The only change we made was using fritos instead of tortilla chips. Will definitely make again.

This could not be any easier and it tasted great.  This was a big hit with everyone.  The only change I made was to cut up the chicken before cooking since I was not home to do so after five hours.  I cooked on low for about 8 hours.

This recipe was absolutely AMAZING! I made it last night and had it for lunch, dinner and lunch today. Not too spicy and didn't taste at all like beer (which I worried about). 
  Some things I did differently: Used pinto beans instead of chili beans. Used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Used 3/4 bottle of Molsen beer instead of whole bottle. Baked on high setting for 4 hours.

This wasn't really anything too exciting for me, unfortunately.  Part of the problem may have been that it was too runny for me.  Probably won't make again.

I made this soup and brought it to work. Everyone liked it alot except that I made it too spicy they said. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any tomato sauce and I used 1 jalepeno instead of crushed peppers.
Since I used stuff that I had on hand we ate the soup without the sour cream,cheese and tortilla chips. Thanks for sharing. I also used the taco seasoning provided by the submitter in one of the reviews instead of a seasoning packet.

Following other reviewers, I omitted the beer (didn't have any on hand and don't care for it anyhow) and added more seasoning toward the end (cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper all "to taste").

Huge hit with me and my skeptical husband!

This recipe is very good and makes a lot.  I didn't bother shredding the chicken - just cut it up really small to begin with.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe today...it's the first time I've used my crock pot, and it turned out really well.  Very simple too.  I thought it was best with the broken tortilla chips, shredded cheese, and sour cream, although it would still be good without.  Since I'm not a big fan of beans, I used less of them and a bit more of the tomatoes and corn.  Simple recipe for a cool fall day!

I replaced the beer with water (last time I made it with the beer and it was too yeasty) and added a little garlic powder to give it more flavor. I made this taco soup for my Mexican cousin who is sick and her whole family raved about it! It's not traditional Mexican, obviously, but the flavors in it are so good! They think I'm the best cook now that I made this soup for them, hahaha!

My husband really enjoyed this soup. He said, "this was the best soup I have ever made". Most importantly it was so simple. I did add some extra cumin, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. I substituted chicken stock for beer. Tasted great, highly recommend trying this recipe. (Still tastes great without the cheddar and sour cream on top, if you would like a healthier version)

This is delicious and easy!  I used chicken broth rather than the beer, and used Taco Seasoning I for seasoning.  This will be a winter staple at my house!

I substituted chicken broth for beer because I didn't have any. I actually liked it better without and without the calories.(I have tried it both ways)I didn't have time to defrost my chicken so took the advice of someone else and put them in frozen. Great easy recipe. I like it best as a dip with chips, cheese, and sour cream.**** If you need a good meal with low calories sub ckn croth for beer and 1 can of rotel. No sourcream,cheese or chips. Right over 2100 calories for the WHOLE CROCKPOT!! Have lost weight!!

I did not like this although my husband loved it. I think it would have probably been better if I'd subbed the beer for chicken broth. I think the beer gave it a funny flavor that I just did not like. Next time I'll skip the beer and use chicken broth like others suggested.

I loved this recipe! It was so simple and I already had all the ingredients on hand.  Opened the front door after a long day at work to a yummy smell!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Chicken breasts were put in the slow cooker still slightly frozen.  I cooked on low for 10 1/2 hours (long day!) and it came out perfectly.  This will definitely become a staple in my kitchen this winter.  Added reduced fat sour cream and Mexican melting cheese to serving bowls.  I was out of crackers and served some pretzels on the side instead.  Delicious!

oh so good, I left in the slow cooker for 9hrs on low and it turned out great.  I shredded the chicken and I added another package of taco seasoning (it was a little bland) before serving remember to top with cheese and sour cream......this makes a great week day meal.

I loved this spicy soup! I used a jar of homemade salsa instead of the Rotel, added some extra spices (garlic, cumin, chile powder and Chipotle tabasco sauce). Also used chicken broth instead of beer and added 4 oz. cubed velveeta to the soup to give it a creamier texture! Will make again!

This recipe is awesome and so easy!!  I didn't have any corn chips to serve with it, so I made cornbread.  I substitued chili beans for white beans since that's all I had.  Turned out great. will make again.

This is PHENOMINAL!!!!!  Perfect - I would not change a thing!  My family and I do an annual "swap" gift exchange at the holidays. I gave the dry ingredients and 
recipe as a gift.  This is now a family favorite!  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this soup. It had just enpugh spice. The people who wanted more used hot sauce. The Bill Echol's taco seasoning and using a mild beer is a must. I also set bowls of cheese, tortilla chips, sour cream, and chopped avocado out for people's own preference. Great recipe

I made this recipe as stated and found it to be pretty tasty. I will make it again with some tweaking (I like a little more spice). I thought it would be thicker. I drained and rinsed the beans, drained the corn, but added the tomatoes with their liquid. I served the leftovers with some rice - all gone now!

My whole family LOVED this. The next day it had more of a chilli consistency but I used crushed tomatoes and a separate can of chillies instead of diced tomatoes because thats all I had.  I did sub the beer for chicken stock and next time I will use just a little more to make it a little thinner.  I was so surprised that the flavor was PERFECT! I also didn't use quite the whole packet of taco seasoning.  I figured I could add more later if need be and I didn't need to.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!

This is absolutely delicious! I was a little hesitant about adding beer, but I wouldn't eat this soup any other way. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this for a cousin's get together weekend and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I did use the home made taco seasoning as recommended by the poster and substituted a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and 1 small can of chilies for the 2 10 oz cans of diced tom w/chilies and used a can of pinto beans not chili beans. I cooked overnight shredded the chicken the next morning turned it off for a couple hours thanback on an hour before serving. It was just spicy enough and I will be making it again very soon,  Very easy!!
just another note, I have made this with beer and with chicken broth  I think the flavor is far superior using the beer!!

I didn't want to wait so didn't do the slow cooker method. I boiled my chicken in water with garlic, pepper, and hot salt. While cooking, I put other ingrediants in pot except chili beans and beer (used chicken broth instead). I also added a can of green chile enchilada sauce.  My hubbie gave it a 4 saying it had too much chicken (he'd rather eat beef) and not "soupy" enough. I gave it a 5 because it was the perfect amount of heat - left some fire in your mouth but not your stomach plus it was ready to eat in under 30 minutes.

This dish is on my regular menu rotation.  I don't use a slow cooker, I make it on the stove top.  I add all the ingredients and heat on medium heat for 20 minutes.  That's it!  A very adaptable recipe to suit your taste.   My vegetarian 15 yr. old loves it so I add rotisserie chicken to my portion only.  I don't use diced tomatoes either, just sauce.  Freezes well too!

Taco soup is the ultimate crowd pleaser! IMHO, the beer makes a big difference in mellowing the flavors. Also, if you are feeding kids or picky people who might object to chicken, pre-browned ground turkey works great and is also healthy!

It was excellent.  I added in all the recommended spices and everyone loved it.  It was more like a chili consistency, but that was fine with me!!

This was good but not great.  I followed the directions exactly - ingredients and cooking times.  I think 3 chicken breasts is too many.  If I make this soup again, I will use 2 full size breasts instead.  I will probably use chicken broth instead of beer, as well.  The sour cream, cheese and chips are a necessity with this soup!

This soup was incredibly easy and very very tasty, everyone loved it.  Because of all the canned ingredients, it is high in sodium.  To lower the sodium, I used frozen instead of canned corn, no salt added tomato sauce and low sodium taco seasoning.

Wow, this is super good.  I did follow the suggestion of one reviewer and made my taco seasoning, here is what I did. 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper.  I added cheese but did not do the tortilla chips, who needs to mess with perfection.

This was the perfect "stoup" recipe!  (as Rachel Ray would say!)  I added a bit more chicken breasts to make it a little thicker but other than that, I followed this recipe exactly and it was so good!  I doubled the recipe thinking I could freeze some for a month or so from now and it made so much I ended up taking an entire batch to my in laws!!!  It makes a lot!!  (and I have big eaters!)  Anyway, you will love this recipe and you could even swap out the shredded chicken for shredded beef!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe that will be in my recipe book for years to come!  Everyone raved about how yummy this was... perfect for a cool fall day or a cold winters night!!!

This was a great, easy recipe that I'll make again.  My changes were: 2 cans of 14.5 oz Red Gold diced Tomatoes with Chipotle, 1 an (4 oz) green chilis, 5 small chicken breasts.  I used Yuengling lager & the flavor was awesome, but our kids didn't like it that much. Leftovers were very, very tangy, still good, but next time I might leave out the green chili's.  This would be a great super bowl party recipe as it's more like chili than soup.

This is a great and easy recipe - especially for a group.  I made a few minor changes - I did not use the beer, but added a can of chicken broth.  I also added a little bit of additional cumin (app. 1-2 tsp.).  The soup was looking a little thin for my taste, so I also added a small box of Velveeta - this made it the absolute perfect consistency and also a wonderful cheesy flavor without being overdone.  Definitely a keeper!

This was great! So easy to put together.  I made it recipe as is but I did substitute the beer for chicken broth.  I do think that it could stand for a bit more spice (an I'm wimpy to spice) Maybe bit more green chili or some jalapenos.  My mom and sis both asked for the recipe.

Yummo! This was great! and per suggestions made Bill Echols taco seasoning. I was worried because it looked so super watery but once the chicken was shredded it really thickened up. I also used tongs to "tear/shred" the chicken. I have a large family so I used 1 can each of chili beans, northern beans and black beans and 2 cans of corn all drained. I used the beer, was worried about that too but it came out pretty good. Will definitely add this to my rotation. FYI I started this a little later in the day than I had planned and my chicken was frozen -so I cooked this on High for 6 hours.

Yep...love this one! This was SO simple! Gotta love slow cooker recipes! I love that you can just throw the chicken in and don't have to worry about baking or browning. Very tasty and very easy. I served it up with 'dragon dippers' from this site.

This was a chili as far as I'm concerned. It tasted pretty good. We like our chili spicier. I would definitely use jalepenoes next time. I also added some chopped avacado which my family loves. I will probably put in some black olives next time too.

Very Good Chili type soup! I added extra tomatoes, and a little more 'heat' to mine. Serve it with a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese shredded on top. Great to dig in with some tortilla chips! Reminds me of a Baja Chicken Enchillada soup that I love!

This soup is so quick & easy.  My 8yo daughter made a double batch for a church lunch.  We used chicken broth instead of beer and one fajita & one taco seasong mix instead of two taco seasonings.  A big hit.  Just delicious.

im not sure if i should rate this, i had to change the recipe quite a bit. to use what i had on hand. i used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning from this site. and all black beans, no corn. no beer. 1 can rotel w/lime and cilantro. and 1 can diced tomatoes. it turned out very good, only thing i would like is a lottle more spice.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Better then any restaurant soup I've ever had!!
-I added 3 cups of chicken broth to make it more soup like. Did not use beer.
-Used corn with red and green peppers.
-Also used 2 extra chicken breasts.
Perfect! This is a keeper. Thanks Patti!

I didn't have all the ingredients but the recipe still turned out great. I made the Bill Echols seasoning without the Oregano and used water instead of beer. I also only added one can of Rotel. Thanks for the recipe. I can't wait to make it again.

Fantastic soup! Instead of taco seasoning, I put in my usual blend of chili spices- it smelled wonderful and tasted even better! It was a nice alternative to chili, and my husband raved about it. I think I'll make a pot just for him, and maybe put some peppers in it. This is definitely going on my list of handy recipes.

It tasted good.  Didnt like the beer taste in it though.  Husband said, "I wish this was beef instead of chicken".  Theres nothing wrong with the recipe so it gets 4 stars, it just wasnt up to par with our tastes.

This was great.  I did use the suggested taco spice from this site but left out the salt. Canned tomatoes and beans have enough sodium.  The fact that it is so easy, makes it a 10*!

This was one of the best tasting meal I have made in the crockpot!
I made just a couple of changes however.
I added two 15oz. cans of red enchilada sauce and 1 15 oz. can(instead of 8 oz.) of tomato sauce in place of the can of chopped tomatoes and chilis. All chili beans, no black beans. All changes were just personal preferences.
Made some corn bread to go with it and voila,deelish!

This is really good, cheap and easy.  I left out the onions, tomatoes and beer and added 12 oz water and a tsp of chicken bouillon (just my tastes).  I also added cheese, but didn't have tortilla strips.  LOVED IT!!!

I knew my husband would love this soup so I made it for him, knowing I wouldn't care for it.  Surprisingly, I loved it!  It is such a perfect soup as our nights are getting cooler.  It was a too spicy for my kids but with enough cheese and chips, they ate it.  A new fav from Allrecipes!

This is a decent recipe. But it's mislabeled. It's not a soup, it's a chili. If you're expecting a great soup, getting a decent chili can be a double let down.

This recipe is awesome! I changed up the ingrediants just a bit to use stuff I already had on hand. I use fajita style chicken strips, 1 can tomatoes with green chiles, 1 can regualr diced toamtoes and chili beans with hot sauce. Kept the rest of the ingrediants the same. It was still plenty spicey. Let it cook on high for 2 hours and then on low for 2. My whole family enjoyed this. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was awesome! It's the first recipe I've tried from this website and I'm so glad!  I used 2 cans of chili beans instead of the black beans because I don't like black beans, but that did increase the calorie count by about 100 calories per serving.  

Thanks so much for sharing this!

For those who are on Weight Watchers, I plugged this recipe in and it came out only 6 PointsPlus per serving.  The best part is, except for the beer and taco seasoning, all the ingredients are power foods!!!  I made this soup exactly as directed and it was fabulous.  We had it for dinner one night and was so good I decided to use it as the appetizer for my cookout the next night.  It was a huge hit.  The best part about this soup is that it couldn't be any easier to make. For those worried about the beer, the alcohol cooks off and you can't really taste the beer.....

This soup is so easy to make and is truly delicious. I use chicken stock in place of the beer, fire-roasted canned tomatoes and frozen fire-roasted corn from Trader Joe's and it turns out very well. I also use Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe as suggested. Even my daughter loves it.

Very easy to make and a big hit! I've made this twice and I can't say anything negative about it. Made it according to the directions and it turned out fantastic!
Definately more of a chili than a soup, but I like that better- its heartier and definately enough to be a meal.

Got rave reviews when I made this last night.
Changes I made:
* used chicken thighs for more flavor in the meat
* added masa flour to thicken the soup
* added veggies: mushrooms, zucchini
* sauteed veggies and onions and garlic before putting in to add more flavor
* added lime juice towards the end

Will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as instructed with the exception of 3 chicken breast halves.  I don't know how 3 full chicken breasts would have fit.  :)  It was super easy & the chicken is SO good!  It is more like a thick chilli and I might add a 2nd beer & taco seasoning packet next time to make it more like a soup.  Hope it freezes well! Excellent!

Very, very good.  Seemed so simple but the taste was wonderful.  I used my own mix of mexican spices rather than taco seasoning. The leftovers were even better.

AMAZING!!  So easy to make, and I think it is our new favorite soup!  It makes a ton, and we it was gone in a couple of days.  I added sliced black olives to mine, and we enjoyed the slight beer flavor.

I followed the recipe to a T except for the fact that I used dark meat chicken (cheaper and no one knew the difference). Very good and I will make this easy crock pot recipe again.

I love making this soup in the winter.  So easy and so tasty.  I also made it for a potluck at work and it went over great.  Perfect amount of spiciness - I like a little but not too much. :)

This is one of our new family favorites, even my 2 year old loves it!  While I LOVE putting the beer in, sometimes I just don't have it in the house, and I've discovered that throwing in some water only or water with some chicken bullion works great too.  Thanx for posting this recipe!

WOW!!! This soup was SOOOOO Delicious!! I have been searching for a good chicken taco soup and this is it!! Substitutions that I made were: chix broth instead of beer, only one can of plain diced tomatoes,3 tsp.of diced canned green chilis, blackeye peas instead of black beans and an 11 oz. can of Mexicorn instead of regular corn. Also sprinkled with a little fresh cilantro when I served it. Thank you for this recipe!

I was very disappointed in this recipe after all of the great reviews.  It is definitely more of a chili than a soup, and had hardly any liquid after it was done cooking.  The chili powder in the taco seasoning (I used the one recommended) was all I could really taste.

I loved the flavor of this recipe, but it lacked heartiness.  To the 2nd batch (I froze half) I added Jalapeno chicken sausage, and it made a big difference.

Very disappointing. Followed this to the letter. The soup never looked like it was cooked thouroughly and was far too spicy - should have known with all the green chilies. Better recipes similar to this out there.

This was good! I did cook and shred my chicken before adding to the slow cooker. I also made Taco Seasoning 1 from this site for this. I don't think I liked the beer in it though(and I usually love to cook/bake with alcohol.) I think I would leave it out next time or not put as much in. Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent. I took the advise of others and replaced the beer with chicken broth and used 2 cans or Rotel tomatoes w/ green chili's.  It turned out GREAT.  I put a dab of sour cream and shredded cheese on top and then scream "KISS THE COOK".  LOL.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was great!!!!!!!  No hassle, KIDS NEW FAVORITE, they even ate ALL the leftovers the next night so I didn't have to make dinner again.  This past week was the last week of school for us all and I needed an easy, no hassle, good dinner that would feed everyone.  I used some of the suggestions from the previous reviewers - esp. MKettrick - and used chicken broth (my kids hate when i use beer in anything) and added some of the other spices they suggested. IT IS FANTASTIC!!! A recommendation to all.

Love it! I added 3 cups of chicken broth instead of the beer.  I like my soup a little soupy to absorb the crushed corn chips I added!  I also added pinto beans instead of chili beans, frozen white instead of canned.  5 stars!!  and easy!!

This is a very good soup, but mine came out more like a stew.  I used Bill Echols Taco Seasoning because it is GREAT! I added more corn and beans because I wanted to have leftovers and it turned out great.  My daughter like it and didn't complain when we had it two days in a row.  I have to say I hate beer and after putting 1/4 of a bottle in I couldn't put in the rest because it smelled bad to me. So I added in some water and it was fine.  We will make this again!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I found that I can also make this a non-slow cooker if I'm pressed for time.  Just boil the chicken in water or chicken stock, shred and add to all the combined ingredients.  Let it simmer for about 1/2 hour and it's ready to go!!  There is absolutely nothing I would change about this recipe - it's fantastic!!  With as much as it makes - we hardly ever have leftovers! Excellent...

This taco soup is so easy to prepare and so delicious that it's impossible not to give it a 5 star rating! I followed the recipe exactly, and I let it cook in the slow cooker all day. The meat shredded with ease, as well. I topped each bowl with a little shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sourcream, as suggested, and that added a slight creaminess to the more brothy soup. This recipe makes enough for plenty of leftovers - it's a filling soup - which were eaten readily in my house. Although I think this recipe is perfection, it's also a flexible recipe that others can tweek to their liking. Also, I used packaged taco seasoning for my first time, but I will definitely try 'Bill Echols taco seasoning' that is listed on this site, below this soup recipe. Thanks Patti Kane for sharing this tasty soup!

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this dish!  We can't wait to serve it to all of our friends.  It helps to keep you full and has a great taste.  We served cheese, sourcream, and avacado slices on top.

SUPER GOOD! I am a big fan of brews with hearty flavors so I opted to use Bass Ale in thie recipe.  It was perfect as it lended a wonderfully complimentary "beer flavor" without being overbearing.  What a great, easy and affordable dish!

I made this recipe as stated.  No changes were needed at all.  We enjoyed it so much we had it 2 weeks in a row.  One for ourselves and the following week for a friend that was just out of the hospital.  I realized the first week that the recipe makes so many servings I was able to make it the second week and split it with enough for both my family and hers.  It is a little time consuming but is definitely worth the effort.

OH MY GOD!!!! This was the best!  I've used quite a few recipes from this site and this has got to be the best and easiest by far.  My husband and kids raved and even had seconds and thirds.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was really good for such a quick and easy soup.  Followed recipe exactly.  Made with Mexican Cornbread II from this site (with a few changes - see my review).  Will definitely make this one again!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone absolutely loved it.  My husband has been wanting me to make taco soup and I couldn't have found a better recipe.  I do have some left overs and I think I will make some cornbread to go with that tomorrow.  I only made a few slight changes.  I had three very large baked, boneless, skinless chicken breast halves left over from something else that I used.  I just shredded them and added them in for the last two hours of cooking which cut my cooking time down to 5 hrs.  This was also plenty of chicken for us.  The tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream added to the bowl at the end make it absolutely perfect!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!  It is definitely a KEEPER!

Yummmo!  This soup is delicious!  I did not have time to do it in a slow cooker so I did it on the stove top in about 3 hours.  I first seared the breasts in a pot and then covered them with the other ingredients until it boiled and then turned it way down and let it simmer.  I did not use beer and instead used two can of broth and it still turned out fabulous.  I added some cilantro to the soup during the last 10 minutes for a fresh taste.  The family loved it!!!

This recipe is fantastic1 I'll definately make it again. I would categorize this as more of a chili. I love the addition of corn! If you like it a little thiner, like me, you can add some vegetable stock...I used some homemade that I had on hand. Garnish is a must. Crushed tortilla chips, sour cream, shredded cheddar, chopped fresh cilantro, Cholula (or other hot sauce). 
My favorite part of this recipe is how incredibly fast and easy it is!

This soup is really, really good as written.  However, I would recommend using 3 chicken breast HALVES (instead of whole breasts) if you are looking for a soup consistency.  I used three whole breasts (6 halves) and it turned out more like a chicken chili.  It was still delicious, just very thick and hearty with very little broth.

Substituted another can of black beans for chili beans, and added a bit of cayenne pepper, chili powder, and about half a cup diced jalepenos. Added a bit more chicken broth, which I used in place of the beer. Also used diced tomatos in place of tomato sauce. It was wonderful!

I really enjoyed this, and it's more the consistency of stew.  Now, I doubled the recipe but only used about 1.5lbs of chicken.  We had a fair amount left over and I used that the next night.  I used a big pie pan and tore up corn tortillas, topped with the stew, then cheese, then crushed doritos and did those layers.  My family thought it was better the second night.

We absolutely loved this meal.  Extemely satisfying and delicious.  Could not be easier.  It has a bit of spice, but our kids were still able to enjoy it.  I crisped up some corn tortilla strips to top it.  I did use a can of chicken broth instead of beer.  I also used 3 chicken breast halves and thought that was plenty of chicken.

Good recipes & easy to make. Next time I will add some jalapeno's or some spice to it. My husband wants to try it by adding rice too. But overall it was easy & turned out well.

I prefer calling it chili, and I like my chili thick.  It didn't say if you're supposed to drain the beans, but I did.  I also couldn't find "chili beans", so I used Red Beans.

Zesty, to be sure.  I ommitted the chicken to make it meatless.  I'm not a vegetarian, just trying to cut food costs and calories.  Not so sure about the beer.  I liked the beer I used (Dundee's Honey Brown), and the end product was ok, but maybe next time I'll try just water.

Excellent!  This soup was wonderful ... full of flavor.  I omitted the corn, because I'm not a big fan of "floaty corn" in my soup.  Instead, I added some chopped poblano pepper and some fresh lime juice.  Outstanding, especially w/ some melted cheese!  I've been eating it for lunch all week!

Great!  Worth five stars.  Used leftovers as a casserole base, added low-fat cheese, some hot salsa and topped with a prepared boxed cornbread mix.  375 for 45 minutes.  Incredible.  Not a crumb left!

Very good, kind of reminded me of a similar soup at Chili's, but better. I left out the beer and a can of beans and because of that it was a really spicy, but still good.

I have 4 very picky eaters. I gave each just a spoonful to try and everyone passed up their bowls to be filled. 
I didn't use the beer instead I used a can of chicken broth. I also added black olives about a half a can. Would definetly recommend.

I can't remember how many times I have made this soup - it is one of my favorite! It freezes really well so it's great for making on a Sunday for lunches and dinners for the next couple weeks. I have already recommended this to friends and family; make it yourself today!

Really liked this, as did my family.  I used chicken broth, plain diced tomatoes and frozen mixed veggies(all I had) but I think it would be very good with just plain frozen corn.  I didn't use the crock-pot, but worked just as well on the stove, I did pre-cook the chicken.

I cut the recipe to 4 servings as it is only my husband and I and we thought it turned out great. Very flavorful with evrything blending well. We had plenty left over which I have frozen and will reheat in a couple weeks and see how it is then.

5 stars!  This was so easy and hearty. It made a large crock pot of soup.  I followed the recipe exactly- it was fantastic.  I will certainly make it again.  The leftovers were even better!

We loved this recipe -- I put it together within 10 minutes before I left for work, and when I got home, I shredded the chicken and simmered it until supper.  Delicious and so easy.

ALOT of flavor. We loved it the first night, but the next day when we re-heated it, there was a strong beer taste. Next time, we will only add half a can of beer and drink the other half!

This was awesome!  This only thing I changed was to add more Taco seasoning near the end of the cooking time since it needed a little more flavor.  Everyone loved it and best of all it was easy to make.

Also I cooked on high for 2 hrs then shredded the chicken then put it on low for the rest of the time.  I think the creative use of high and low makes it easier to fit into a schedule.

This is not a gourmet recipe, but it is simple to make and tastes delicious.  I add 2 tablespoons of Bill Echols' taco seasoning to the crockpot, and I use another 2 teaspoons on the onions (which I saute in olive oil, along with 2-3 cloves of freshly minced garlic, until soft).

As for liquid, make sure you drain the beans or the finished product will be too liquidy.  I've experimented with several kinds of beer and have found that Amstel light adds just the right depth without being overwhelming.

I've found that I can shave 1.5 hours off the total cooking time by shredding the chicken after 4 hours (vs. 5) and then cooking for an additional 1.5 hours (vs. 2).

Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out very well, but it had quite an intense kick that made it unsuitable for my toddler. I also used chicken broth instead of beer and used Taco Dust from Whole Foods as the seasoning. This is a great recipe for dreary days.

This was very tasty and great, but a little too spicy for my taste.  My kids wouldn't eat it b/c it was too spicy. I would suggest cutting using the mild Rotel tomatoes, (and if using the seasoning mixture instead of a taco seasing packet) - 1/2 of the pepper suggested and skip the crushed red hot pepper.

I also used a can of chicken stock and can of cream of chicken soup instead of the beer, and a litle bit of Velveeta cheese to have a thicker consistancy like stew.

This recipe is a keep though!  Yum!

This soup was a hit at my house.  I used the Bill Echols taco seasoning without the oregano because I didn't have any.  I added about 2-3 Tbsps of sugar because I thought it was to harsh or something, and it really did enhance the flavor without changing it.  I also recommend using the sour cream, cheese, and chips, it really made the soup.

Fabulous!  I added in 1/3 cup of onion instead of a whole onion, and added in about 5 oz of corn instead of a 15 oz can (that's a lot of corn!).  The only other change I made was just before serving: remove about 3 Tbl of soup liquid into a bowl and add in 1.5 tsp corn starch.  Add back into soup to thicken it up just a little.  Both my husband I loved this recipe, and I'll be making it again!  Thanks for sharing!

This is easy and delicious!  Changes:  I used two boxes of frozen corn instead of canned corn and one can of original Rotel tomatoes and one can of extra hot Rotel for the diced tomatoes and chicken broth instead of beer.  Will definitely be making again!

Very good as is; I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 4 chopped chipotle chilis (in adobo sauce) to give it some extra flavor....I'd rate it 5 stars with these changes.

Loved this recipe....and so did my 2 teenage boys, one of which usually doesn't like corn and the other that usually doesn't like beans!  The only thing I changed was added another chicken breast and I replaced the beer with chicken broth.  Made it again for company the next week and they loved it too

This was super easy! Family loved it (and they don't like anything new). I didn't use beer, instead used chicken broth.  Towards the end of cooking I added 3/4 cup of minute rice and a little water.  It was very good the next day.

This was the easiest soup to make and very tasty!  Just throw everything together in the crock pot, couldn't be any easier.  My husband even really enjoyed and he is not a soup fan and gave me the "huh?" look when I told him what it was.  I added another 1/2 can of corn and black beans and some fresh cilantro.  Great for a group or anytime that you may have made chili!

This was super good.  I made mine with a pound of hamburger and added a packet of taco seasoning.  I also added 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese just before serving.

I did change this recipe a bit because I did not have tomato sauce on hand.  I used 1 can of enchilada sauce instead. I did chop up a jalepeno pepper and throw it in also. Next time I will use spicy enchilada sauce to 'turn up the heat' a bit on this delicious recipe. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

Our reviewers were in a dead heat between a 4 or a 5- so we'll give it a 4.5. Since we cooked this at school we used chicken stock for the Beer. It was a meal in itself! A favorite for sure.

Wow. After all the great reviews, I knew this was going to be good. While it was cooking, the smell kind of turned me off. I was a little worried that it wouldn't suit my tastebuds! My boyfriend came over and we were going to go to his moms house for dinner, but he wanted to try the chili first. After mixing the sour cream, chips, and cheese in, he was loving it. He even said he wanted to ditch his mom and stay home to eat 6 bowls! Haha. Anyways, i highly recommend it. Followed the recipe exactly.

This was good. Instead of cooking in a crock pot I cooked it all day in a cast iron dutch oven. It was great on a snowy day. I topped with sour cream & chopped cliantro.

Pretty good. I didn't really have to substitute for anything! (meaning, most ingredients should be on hand for this recipe for most households). Closest thing to it was the taco seasoning, which is easily made (see recipe author's comment). I didn't have any cheese, but without it, it would just need a little salt/pepper.

YUM,YUM!!!!  Put all of this together Sunday night in the crockpot so that Monday on the way out the door all I had to do was plug it in (yes, I put the liner in the frig. over night).  I used one pound of chicken tenders (next time will add 1 1/2 pounds), cut into chunks, added raw.  Than I used only one can of Rotel (daughter can't handle too spicy), one can of diced tomatoes and one can of chicken broth.  Was so good that husband whats it again real soon!  Of course, you serve it with all of the "extras" listed!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this soup tonight in half the time and it was great!  It took me 1 1/2 hours and I used a reg pot, I let it simmer for an hour.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Rotisserie Chicken from the grocery store that is pre-cooked. I used the chicken broth at the bottom of the dish they come in and added it to the soup.  Me and my husb loved it, it's spicy!

This is a very good soup.  And easy.  The only change I made is that I used canned hominy instead of the corn.  I think it added some visual appeal, and my family loves hominy.  The chicken came out so tender and tasty.

I really liked this recipe, especially when I added shredded cheddar and crumbled corn muffin to it.  YUM, YUM!  Super easy and it was excellent even though my husband forgot to turn it off and it cooked for 5 hours longer than necessary.  I highly recommend this recipe!  The only thing I might do next time is add more corn.

This recipe was great for the amount of time it took. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the canned soup taste. I would have added a fewer fresh ingredients, like fresh chopped tomatos, etc. However  - it is great for the amount of work that goes into to. My boyfriend loved it. I followed all of the user reviews and added a few chopped jalepenos for a kick. Good.

I hate to rate this anything other than a 5 star, but this dish did not live up to it's rating. This is not a 'kid friendly' meal, I made this specifically because others stated their kids loved it. My kids picked at this and took only a couple of pieces of chicken out. I am really sad that this wasn't as good as it sounded, it was so easy!!!

Wow.....super easy, mouth watering good.  I sub chicken broth for the beer and used one can of tomatoes with chili's and one with lime and cilantro.  My kids won't touch it, but that just left more for dh & I.  Dh loved it, as well as the neighbor, one pot did not last long.  Skip the chips, cheese and sour cream.  A keeper for certain.

I used the beer and followed the recipe exactly. I even used the taco seasoning recommended on this site. We found this to be very good. A little spicy but good. It was much better the second day IMO.  Thank you!

This was good but not great, although I followed the recipe exactly it felt like there was something missing somehow.  I like the overall concept and will work on it since I am now seeking lower fat recipes for the slow cooker and so staying away from the heavier meats that are so good in it,

Wonderful recipe!  I doubled it for my bunko party and my only changes were using chicken broth instead of beer and using Bill Echols taco seasoning instead of packets.  My guests raved.  Super easy and delicioius.  I will make this again and again.

I personally really liked this soup and so did my 3 year old daughter. Its my very picky husband and 8 year old son who disagreed...My husband gave it a pretty good and my son refused to eat. I made it exactly as stated, My daughter and I get the leftovers all to ourselves.

I've been making this for years and it's always a crowd-pleaser, or a great way to have dinner ready for several days in advance. We always end up sharing the leftovers with friends, who all love the soup. It's nice because you can change the type of beans and garnishes for a little variety. It's great with chips. I always used frozen corn instead of canned to cut back on the sodium a little. It is a salty soup!

I have made this several times and I love it!  And when I serve it at parties, the pot always seems to be empty very quickly!  I have found it to be a bit spicy...so I make sure to opt for "mild" versions of items where there is an option.  And I make it with the 1/2 can of chicken broth.  love it!

This was very good. I added one extra can of beans - pinto. My family loves beans! Also, very easy, just follow recipe and eat! I did slow cook it for 8 hours - was gone all day - did not overcook at all.

Definitely a hit! I used frozen chicken breasts and added a can of black beans. Instead of whole tomatoes, I bought crushed tomatoes which seemed to have the perfect texture. I might even double the tomatoes next time. Also, if you live near a Trader Joe's, I highly recommend using their bottled enchilada sauce. Everyone in the family loved it, including my 10 and 4 year old boys.

This was very good! My whole family enjoyed it, even my 2yr old. It was quick and easy! I cooked it for a full 8hrs on low heat and then just took a fork and pulled the chicken apart and served. I think the cheese and the sour cream make the dish. I used chicken broth instead of the beer and I also used 1 can of Rotel with lime juice and cilantro, and one can of regular Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes with green chillies.

This is a very tasty and hearty soup.  I used the new Miller Chill beer which has a nice lime flavor that I think makes a difference.  I serve with tortilla chips and sour cream - yummy!  This also freezes well.

This is a great base, but I added jalapenos and cilantro to up the mexican flavor.  I also use boneless chicken thighs for more tender meat.  I've made it several times.  Great topped with scallions, sour cream and mexican blend shredded cheese.

Absolutely wonderful.  I changed the bottle of beer to chicken broth (had none of one and lots of the other) and added an 8 oz can of tomato paste.  Delicious!  Guests even wanted me to e-mail them the recipe.

I didn't think this was as fabulous as some of the reviewers, but it was very good and we will difinitely be making it again.  I made a few changes and will change one more thing next time.  The changes I made were to put in my own seasonings instead of the packet, make 1.5 C each of cooked black beans and pinto beans instead of the canned beans, blend the tomatoes before putting them into the soup (we don't like tomato chunks), add three pressed cloves of garlic (might add more next time), and use 6oz turkey stock plus 6oz beer instead of 12oz beer.  The only thing that we didn't like about the recipe was the onions, they weren't cooked enough when the soup was done and my husband thought there were too many.  So next time i will use 1/2 an onion and saute it a bit first.  I will also only use 2 chicken breasts next time, there was a TON of chicken!  I might further increase the amount of beans and decrease the chicken to save money.  But over all really good recipe!  And so easy!

This is a new favorite in my household!  Even my normally picky 12 year old daughter gave this two thumbs up.  Great to feed a crowd on a cold day!  I highly recommend using the beer with lime in this recipe - it really adds great depth to the flavor!

This was fantastic!  I used mexi-corn and all pinto beans.  I could smell the beer but it didn't have a noticable flavor.  I'm sure it added something.  I cooked this on high because of lack of time.  I tasted it after it cooked for about 3 hours.  It was MUCH better after 5.

Wow!  Great recipe!!!  I also omitted the beer in favor of chicken broth and added some garlic salt.  I ended up boiling the chicken with onion and garlic salt, shredding and adding it in at hour 5.  My husband is difficult to get a really big reaction and he raved over it.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is wonderful!!!  One of the best I've ever made!!!  I did substitute chicken broth for the beer and added a packet of ranch seasoning to it.  Also, I was short on time so I actually cooked it on the stove top then just kept it warm in my slow cooker.  I highly recommend this hearty soup!

This is a good recipe.  It came out like chicken chili.  The beer taste put me off just a bit...but I just don't really like the taste of beer in general.  On the other hand, my husband LOVED it and I don't get that response for my cooking from him very often! I will be making this again. :)

An excellent soup standby! Using so many canned ingredients makes this easy to throw together any time. I had leftover baked chicken breast from the previous night, so I cut it into large cubes and threw it in the slow cooker with everything else. Cooked on high for about 3 hours. A warm and filling meal for a chilly Maine night!

I made this with only one change. I used my own mixture of taco seasoning.  It was delicious. Reminded me of the chicken enchiladas I make with beer.

This is possibly one of the best meals I've ever made.  My husband yelled out "Oh my Gawd" three times while eating it cause it was so good.  We substituted the chili beans for pinto beans and also used a half can of beer (Coors Lite) and a half can of chicken stock.  Yum!!

Super easy to make.  I also tasted the beer and it was a little too much beer taste for me.  I will try it with chicken stock instead.  Still it was missing something.  Probably will make again but alter it a bit.

Oh my gosh, this is amazing soup!  I used the taco seasoning from this website that is listed in one of the reviews.  It was great and did not have the salty taste that taco seasoning packets sometimes have.  I wasnt' sure about the beer so I used 6 oz. beer and 6 oz. chicken stock.  I think the beer added a nice, almost sweet taste, that complimented the spicy taste.  Next time I may add the whole bottle of beer.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Sooooo easy to make! I did not add the beer instead I added one can of chicken broth and one 11.5 oz can of V8. If you are not able to shred the chicken just chop the chicken into small cubes when you add all the other ingredients and enjoy 7 hours later!

TEN STARS!!!! Made this Thanksgiving weekend to feed a large group during football. Everyone raved about it. I doubled the recipe so there was quite a bit. The next day my neighbor was over looking for more and then the my bro-in-law was back for more even though I had sent a bowl home with him as well! The longer it sits the spicier it gets! Cheese on top makes it rock!!!!

Just had some of the leftovers for lunch!  The BEST!  I did make modifications - because of a lower carb dieter in my family I omitted the beans, 8 oz. tomato sauce, corn and beer.  Added 1/2 knorr chicken bullion, 1 cup water, diced green chili and 14.5 oz diced tomatoes.  Made Bills Taco seasoning exactly (FANTASTIC). Topped it with cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro and green onions.  Used the meat the next day for a killer taco salad!  Thanks!

I was a little nervous b/c I don't like corn in my soup, but my sister told me to try it.  It was GREAT.  I fixed it on night and froze hlaf for another.  It was so nice to have yummy soup ready on a day when I didn't want to cook.  This recipe is also so healthy and FULL of fiber and protien.  Thanks so much.

This one continues to be a hit at our house! Serve with the hint of lime tortilla chips to fancy it up a bit. This soup freezes and reheats well too. While I have made substitutions when I didn't feel like heading to the store, I wouldn't change the recipe at all. THANKS!

Yum, this was GREAT! I was a bit skeptical until I shredded the chicken... it really made the dish more "meaty" and less soupy.  I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, but had extra cans of diced tomatoes that I blended smooth with a hand blender. Used Bill Echols taco seasoning recipe the author suggested and it was terrific, just next time I'll probably ease up on the amount as it was a bit too spicy for hubby.  Like other recipes, this even tastes better next day.  Makes a lot so you can freeze some. Served w/sour cream, shredded cheese and tortilla chips.

This recipe was great!!  I have made it twice now.  I would suggest using chicken stock (or broth) rather than the beer.  It makes for a milder taste.  We also cut the chicken back from 3 breasts to 2 to make it more like soup.  With 3 chicken breasts it is more like a stew.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe.  I change it a little every time and it's always great.  I do add more chicken than it calls for to give the soup a little more bulk.  It makes a better meal that way.  I NEVER skip the beer.  It gives it a unique taste.  MMMM.

Absolutely delicious! Definately use the Bill Echol's seasoning recipe, makes a difference. I used chicken broth instead of beer. One note, not too sure how accurate the nutritional information is, 17 grams of fat?! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, beans are virtually fat free...hmmm.

I am always inviting my family to try new recipes.  I wanted something easy and good.  This is it.  My only problem is that the little that was left had a distinctly beer flavor the next day.  So you just need to make sure to eat it all the same day.

I served this at a family gathering and everyone RAVED about it for days! I omitted the beer, added more chicken broth, and cooked the chicken first rather than in the Crock-Pot. I agree that the Bill Echols Taco Seasoning really makes a difference. 5 stars!

Thanks a lot for the recipe, it was a big hit  and everyone asked for the recipe. I added 2 fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned ones and only 1 chicken breast piece, fresh cilantro. used pinto beans as i didn't have chilli beans. i used dried beans instead of canned ones. soaked it overnight and pressure cooked black beans and pinto beans and then added to the soup. didn't have slow cooker so cooked it on stove for 2 hrs. it was even more good the next day.

Family loved this one even though it was a little spicy for them....next time I will just use a milder can rotel tomato. My husband claims this made his cold and sore throat much better....think I will use this one instead of the old fashioned chicken soup for the the cold and flu season. Perfect for this time a year....will be making again soon!!!

Very good and super easy! I had to make a few modifications because I did not have all of the ingredients on hand. I used only one can of rotel tomatoes and an entire jar of salsa to sub for the tomato sauce and extra can of rotel. I used the beer and thought the flavor was great. Perfect for chilly fall and winter weather. My husband loved it.

I made a few adjustments as well.  At the end of cooking, I added a little chili powder and some brown sugar.  I wanted it to taste a little richer.  Also, next time I will try to substitute chix broth for the beer.  The beer taste threw me for a loop.  Guests raved about the soup though.  Once you add the sour cream, mexican shredded cheese, and crushed Doritos (loved the Doritos), it's a hit!  I didn't use the onion and next time I might do one tomato w/ the chilis and one plain.  It was a little spicy for my kids.  I will for surely make this again and would recommend it.  It's easy and yummy!

The whole family loved this one!  I used 6 chicken breasts instead of 3...it was very hearty and warming.

Only change is next time I think I'll use low-sodium chicken broth instead of beer

This was delicious!  I used Bill's taco seasoning as recommended and also used chicken broth instead of the beer.  Although, I am still curious about the beer so may try it in the future.

I thought this was really good. I didnt have much in the house so I was looking for something and came across this. I had pre-cooked chicken in the package so for some reason it didnt string apart with my fork so I just diced it. I think I would like it better that way but Ill try it the other. Thanks so much! Living in buffalo we need nice warm meals=)

This was so easy and I was surprised it wasn't spicer than it was (although I used the milder Rotel cause hubby doesn't like spicy).  Anyway, turned out great although I thought it could have been souper so I added a can of chicken broth which didn't hurt it at all.  Thanks for the receipe we will definately fix this again.

This was very good, most people at our party asked for the recipe; however I agree with other reviewers that it is more like a chili.  I used the beer, which I will do again, as it really gave great flavor (you can taste it, so use a beer you like!)

We loved this soup & it was so easy!  I omitted the beer & added one can of Cream of Chicken soup without draining cans of beans & the corn for more liquid.  Just spiced it up a bit with cumin & some red pepper flakes.  Wonderful topped with shredded cheese, sour cream & crushed tortilla chips!

I LOVE this soup!  So quick and easy, great flavor.  I did add CHicken broth instead of the beer and a bit of garlic and cumin.  When serving I had tortilla chips, sour cream, cheese, avocado...it was delicious!  Even better the 2nd day!

Ok, so I love the slow cooker and I've never reviewed anything on allrecipes.  I've cooked many of them and they were all ok, not great, but ok in my opinion.  THIS SOUP IS AMAZING!!! I followed other reviewers suggestions by using only half of the beer and the other part chicken broth.  Topped with cheese and sour cream, ahh sooo good!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!!

This one is always a crowd pleaser and so easy.  It is easily my best crock pot recipe and I have tried a lot of crock pot recipes.  It is flavorful, weight watcher friendly and ridiculously easy to prepare. I always use fat free chicken broth in the place of the beer but otherwise stick with the original recipe.  It is great because nothing has to be cooked ahead of time and the only thing that needs chopping is the onion.  It takes minutes to put together and my 2 and 5 year old love to help me dump the cans into the slow cooker.  Even my very picky mother in law enjoyed it and actually asked for the recipe!

This soup was wonderful!   I did omit the beer and added chicken broth instead - no reason really, just thought beer sounded a little strange.  I also drained the black beans and used mild rotel tomatoes.   To make the dish a little harder, I cooked a pot of sticky rice and ladled the soup over it in bowls, topping with cheese and sour cream.  Very good - I know I will make this a lot.

Loved this recipe!  I made it 5 days ago and I had the last bowl for lunch today.  I have to say it got better every day!  I did hae to make a few changes as I didn't have exactly what the recipe called for.  I had plain old diced tomatoes, no chili beans but Chili starter in a can with chili beans.  I used frozen corn and very little onion.  I started out using a whole can of Bud Lite, thinking since it's a light beer it wouldn't overpower the soup.  For my taste it still was too strong so I added a whole 14.5 oz can of Chicken broth on top of the beer.  It really helped tone down the taste of the beer. I was fraid the soup would be too think but it wasn't at all.  THe soup is definitely a keeper, I plan to make it all winter long!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe. I did omit the beer and used chicken broth. I also used a hot and spicy taco season, and extra hot tomatoes, and used fiesta corn. It was really spicy and great, my family loves spicy. will make again and again.

I made this last week and the whole family loved it.  After reading reviews I was a little hesitant on adding the whole can of beer.  I probably added about 2/3 of the can and did not replace with any other liquid as others have done.  (next time I'll put it all in)  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous!  Great meal for a cold winter evening.

I made this today, it was good, and very easy to put together. I did not have chicken breasts, so I used chicken thighs. Still turned out good. I did add cumin, and ground red peppers. I am going to make this again, but I am going to try ground beef, to see if it is good that way also.

I decided to try this recipe since I had all the ingredients on hand. Wow was I surprised at how well it tasted. I didn't change much, but I did reduce the amount of beer, added some chicken stock, and when I added chicken back in for last two hours, I added some red bell pepper and sliced jalapeno peppers. My husband took the leftovers to work and just called to tell me how good the soup tasted.

omg.. can i just say that i did not have enough time to use the crock pot and simply cooked the chicken first and added all the ingredients to a huge pot and "whala" after maybe an hour I went ahead and served it.  IT was still great.  so the next time I did cook it in the crock pot and it was EVEN better.  I have no complaints.  delish!

Served this for 9 adults and 13 kids ranging from 15-5 years. All loved it.
The only thing I changed was browned the chicken with onions, shredded it, then added it to crock pot. Had it on high for 4 hours, turned to low, people ate as they were hungry! Not a drop left.

This was so simple to make, and it was soo good. My 4 year old loved it and actually asked to eat it as leftovers the next night. It was even good the second time around.

Don't change a thing, it's perfect the way it is!  Got a little zing, but not so much it doesn't suit all.  Absolutely delicious.  I will be making this again.

I love this recipe. I marinated my chicken breasts in a marinade of my choice for a good two hours before I put them in the crockpot. I also ommitted the corn and can of beer, but only because I didn't have them on hand. It still turned out DELICIOUS, and it's now one of my family's favorites. We eat it with slightly warmed white corn tortillas, as well.

This was pretty good, but it seemed to be lacking some depth, and that's probably because after adding all the other ingredients, my crockpot was filled to the brim and I couldn't add chicken broth or beer.. I used spicy mexican tomato sauce, spicy taco seasoning and chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also added a small can of chopped jalapenos, and forgot the onion. Still, it's an easy dish and very healthy.

This soup was fantastic!  My husband, who normally loathes leftovers, not only devoured them the next day, but had two more helpings!

The chicken was so tender and this soup was restaurant style.  Coupled with the suggested sour cream and blue corn chips, the result was an A plus!

This soup was so easy! My husband and all four of my children loved it. I had friends over for coffee the next day and I heated the leftovers and served it with chips. (like a dip) They all loved it and wanted a copy of the recipe. Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe!  I use chicken stock in place of beer, just because we like the flavor better.  We make this at least a couple of times a month.

I made this soup for my husband's 30th birthday party. It was so good! I changed it up a tiny bit by using 4 chicken breasts that we cooked on the grill before hand, added a can of chicken broth and some slices of green, yellow and orange bell peppers and omitted one of the cans of diced tomatoes. I will make this again without a doubt.

This was a good, VERY easy recipe.  I made it a few months ago and waited until I finished my frozen leftovers to rate it.  Easy to make, tastes great fresh, for leftovers or after being frozen for a while.  I used chicken broth instead of beer.

This was awesome!!   I only had a whole chicken so I left alot of the liquids in with the canned beans.  We didn't have chile beans, but I don't think we missed them.  The beer goes really well with the taco seasoning.  We made a huge pot .  We froze half and my husband ate the other half in one night!!  We will make this again and again!!

This recipe was awesome!  I must admit I was a bit skeptical as it seemed too easy.

  The only thing I did differently was add a packet of guacamole mix (found in the produce dept)... It was the closest thing I had to taco seasoning.  IT WAS AMAZING!  My husband and children wanted me to make it again the next night!

This may be the single best recipe I've gotten from this site.  I did make some changes -only 1/2 a beer, upped the chicken stock, 2x the taco seasoning, left out the spicey tomatoes, using diced tomatoes and some chile sauce instead (what I had), and only 1 chicken breast.  UNBELIEVABLE soup.  Honestly, so so SO good.

Our family really enjoys this recipe.  Since we don't drink beer, we substiture it with apple juice, and add avacado slices along with the chips, cheese and sour cream.  Dump the ingredients into the cockpot before work, come home shred the chicken - walla, a stress free dinner.

We have a big Halloween party every year for friends and neighbors (kids included). Last year I made this soup for everyone and it was awesome.  I received so many compliments that I wanted to claim it as my own, but didn't.   This soup is a little spicy (kid's still loved it), but very, very, very good.  Try it!!!!!

For a camper friendly version avoiding raw chicken, bake chicken ahead of time in broth, shredding once cooled. At campsite heat together with rest of ingredents on camp stove or crock pot, enjoy!

Wow!  I LOVE this recipe!!  First I think its the seasoning that makes it, I couldnt imagine it without.  You should make extra and keep it handy for quick prep!  Just gathered everything and threw it in the pot!  All I had to do was cut the onions, next time I think I might add some rice.  Very inexpensive too, I had most everything at home!!

this has become a favorite in my house! it is so quick and easy. i agree with others that the beer flavor is somewhat overpowering-even for a beer lover like myself! i prefer to do 1/2 beer and 1/2 chicken stock but that's just personal preference. delicious!

Easy, inexpensive, healthy, and most of all delicious! I used a cut up chicken which I stewed and shredded. I added 1/2 a tsp. of salt, about 8 ounces of the broth I cooked the chicken in, and 2 tbls chopped cilantro after cooking was complete. I wouldn't skip the beer, it really added to the recipe. All 9 people I fed it to enjoyed it! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I love the easy, no-fat, no-bother cooking in the crockpot. This recipe is no exception! I bumped up most of the seasonings by 1/2 teaspoon and chopped up the chicken before putting it in. Bite sized pieces are fine with me! I threw in some fresh cilantro at the very end, and served with sour cream, avocado and tortilla chips. Much less work and mess than making tacos!

I took this to a potluck at work and everyone raved about it.  I have made it several times, and I agree that the beer is better, but chicken broth works very well, too.  I have also assembled the soup and put in cooked/shredded chicken to save time.  That works great and doesn’t compromise the flavor.

This recipe is great.  I think with a little more liquid it would make a wonderful stack dish.  Rice, green onions, etc.

This soup was very easy to make and the flavors were good.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was good, but not wonderful.  I would make it again, though, because it was so easy and it was a filling meal.

I made this for our Daytona 500 party and it was a hit!  I used 4 chicken breasts instead of three and I drained all the canned goods.  I used Bill Echols taco seasoning as well.  I forgot there was even beer in it after I made it!  I served it with shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole and tortilla chips on the side.

Yummy!  I made this over the weekend since we had a hectic schedule.  I substituted chicken broth for the beer, and it was still amazing.  I'm lookin' forward to having a steaming bowl of it again tonight for dinner.

My family and I love this recipe!!! I make it on a regular basis now and everyone gobbles it all up every time! I also definately recommend using Bill Echols taco seasoning found on this site. The variations I use in this recipe are: adding a whole can of chicken broth and only 1/2 - 3/4 bottle of beer, 2 tsp minced onion instead of a chopped onion (my husband is not a big onion fan), use 3 fully cooked shredded or cubed chicken breasts and I cook it on the stove top for 45 min to an hour. We also serve it over some white rice and add shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped avocado & fresh cilantro on top. This is a very filling meal and the flavors are magnificent (even as left-overs)!

This was so easy and so delicious. Even my picky 6 year old ate an entire bowl. I added an extra chicken breast since they are packaged in 4's. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I would actually give this a 3.5.  I love how easy it is to make.  The taste is pretty good, it could use some extra seasoning.  Also, if you don't serve it with sour cream, chips and cheese it has a really strong tomato taste.

This was excellent!! The only thing I noticed was as a "left over" it was even more spicy than the night before.  Otherwise with chips and cheddar cheese on top it was excellent.

Good taste, just not my taste.  I prefer regular chili to this variation.  Good for someone looking for a change from the norm though.

This is the easiest crockpot recipe ever!  I used chicken broth instead of beer and a pack and a half of taco seasoning and it came out wonderful. I also added some black olives even my 2 yr old loved it.  put hint of lime tortilla chips and sour cream on top.  forgot about the cheese in my fridge, I was ready to dig in!  hope yall enjoy!

My whole family loves this soup.  It is so easy.  The beer gives it the best flavor.  One time I accidently forgot to get tomato sauce at the store and just made it without it, it still tasted the same.

This is fine, so don't misconstrue the review.  It's a fine slow cooker soup, really easy to make, tastes pretty good, but not great.  Kind of like a thin chili.  If you make it, i'm sure you'll like it fine, but don't expect too much.  All of that said, it's so easy, and good enough, that I'll probably make it again.

This was delicious!  I didn't have beans or corn, or beer, but it still turned out great.  Very flavorful!  My husband said our local mexican restaurant should serve something like this on their menu! How's that for a compliment?

I love the flavors of this soup.  Like the contributor states, it's very easy to adapt to your personal tastes.  At my house, I used only 1 can diced tomatoes, and it still is great.

This recipe was amazing, and my whole family loved it.  A little tip thought, if you or someone in your family isn't huge on really spicy food, substitute at least one of the cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles for just a can of diced tomatoes alone.  It was a bit too spicy for our tastes, which honestly could have less to do with the chiles and more to do with the brand of taco seasoning.  But yea, a great recipe.

I cooked the beans all day. I didnt use any meat. Didnt want to bother with any. I didnt put any beer in it. Of course I added garlic to it. Im a garlic fan. I had my sister and her dh over for dinner and he wanted her to get the recipe. It was a great, big huge hit. I will make this again and add it to my favorites list. Thanks for sharing, Land.

Loved it!  Very easy.  I loved that I didn't have to cook the chicken first.  I used kidney beans instead of chili beans because that's what I had, half of the taco seasoning, chicken broth for the beer, and I accidentally forgot to add the onion, but it was still great.  Next time I will add the onion though.  My husband doesn't like tomatoes, and the 2 cans of Rotel was a bit much for him (not me), but next time I will substitute more tomato sauce and some green chilis.

I added chicken broth instead of beer like the others had suggested. It seemed like it was missing something to make it better. Chicken tortilla soup was better.

This soup tasted great...except a little more spice would be great.  I think next time I will add a little more chiles...my family likes things spicy. Also, instead of using beer I used a can of chicken broth.  My family loved this recipe.

Wonderful flavor and so easy to make.  Used cooked frozen corn (didn't have canned on hand) and was delicious.  The recipe was slightly spicy--but even my picky husband who does not like spicy foods loved it!!  Will definitely make again!

I've made this soup several times and use chicken broth instead of beer. Also add garlic, cumin and red pepper flakes and an extra can of black beans. I made it for our election day soup supper at church and it was a huge hit. I had several requests for the recipe. This is my husband's favorite.Thanks.

This was awesome!  I made a couple of adjustments purely out of what I did and didn't have on hand.  Left out the chili beans and the beer, used two packages of McCormick Taco Seasoning and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the soup.  Also used 5 breasts as opposed to 3 and it can be eaten as a thick stew or even rolled up in flour tortillas!  I served it with the above extras as well as some fresh avocado and lime - this is a big hit in my house and everyone who tries it wants the recipe!

Whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I replaced the beer with chicken broth and had crushed corn chips, cheese, & sour cream as toppings.  YUMMY!!

Okay, this was great, I really really liked it.  The youngsters found it to be too spicey, even though I only used the "chunky" rotel tomatoes.  My hubby, who loathes soups, was extremely happy to strain off the broth and chow down on the "real" food.  I believe he even had thirds, which is pretty amazing.  Also, I used turkey instead of chicken, because lot leftover from Thanksgiving.  Very good use of turkey leftovers!!  I garnished it with some sharp cheddar, Fritos, and served with a whole-wheat roll.  Delish!

My family LOVED this.  Hubby took the leftovers in his lunch and had to share with the guys at work!  I didn't make in the slow cooker because I decided late to make this.  So here's what I did.  I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and roasted in the oven until cooked through.  Then diced and added to the other ingredients that I had already started simmering on the stove.  I did use chicken broth in place of the beer.  Next time, hubby (who is Mexican-American) asked that I use hominy in place of the corn, and pinto beans in place of the chili beans.  We loved this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I did replace the beer with chicken broth and it was yummy!!!  I also make cornbread to go with it.  I made this for my picky in-laws and they just raved about it.

This was ok.  It was a nice change, but my kids didn't emjoy it at all, and there was a lot of left overs that got wasted.  I enjoyed it, but I am rating it overall a 3 b/c of my family.

I loved how easy this was - just dump and go! I tried to use lower sodium ingredients when I had them. I will probably leave the beer out next time. I could smell beer when I was reheating for lunch at work!

This soup was exactly what I wanted!  I shredded a roasted chicken from the deli instead of cooking the chicken in the crock pot.  It turned out great!  We served it with sour cream, avocado, cheese, and tortilla chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Completely incredible!!  This soup has so much potential because of it's flavor and it has room to grow. Next time I believe I will add some cut up squash just to increase the vegtable content.

I thought this was pretty good but not outstanding.  Would have liked a little bit thicker of a soup.  But my husband liked it and he is a picky eater.I would make it again since my husband enjoyed it and it is super easy to make.  May try making it with dark meat chicken instead next time since dark meat seems to have more flavor.

This is tasty, but not a "wow". Husband and I liked it, but our boys weren't thrilled. It was a little too thin for our liking. Skip the beer if you don't have any on hand; it really doesn't add any noticable flavor. It makes a lot, so there will definitely be leftovers for lunch the next day, and another meal. I didn't try to freeze leftovers, so don't know how well it would freeze.

Very good. I followed the recipe except that instead of plain tomato sauce I used Mexican style hot tomato sauce. It turned out a bit spicy but my husband and I enjoyed it a lot. I cooked it on low for about 12 hours and it was still great. It's great warmed up the next day too!! Very quick--perfect for a working family.

I've made this recipe several times now.  It's easy and freezes well so there's always something good to eat on a busy day. The only change I've made is to add fresh cilantro when I have it on hand.

I made this for a costume party last night, and it was all gone, every one was asking for the recipe!  I did make a couple of changes, like everyone else, I added the chicken broth instead of the beer, and I also added the fiesta ranch dressing mix.  This was really good and will make this again!

I thought it was really good, not amazing...but good! I used chicken broth instead of beer, and I used the suggested taco sesoning from this site. I would make it again.

Very easy and yummy!  This is a new favorite at our house.  I always keep the ingredients on hand now.
I use chicken broth instead of beer too.

I made this last night for dinner... oh boy!!!  It was delicious!  I have no complaints... I followed the recipe to the T.  I did debate on whether to half the recipe since it was only for my boyfriend and I... I will do that next time, unless I have company!  My boyfriend loved it so much, he requested some for lunch today! :)  Thank you SO much!!!

This soup is so delicious! I didn't make it in the slow cooker, and I used 15 oz. of tomato sauce and added 1 1/2 cans of water along with all of the other ingredients to make it more soupy. I used a can of light beer, and the flavor was awesome! It didn't need any additional seasonings as it had just the right amount of spice. My kids even liked it! My 13-yr old son said that I should definitely make it again.

This soup was alright, the sourcream and cheese are a must.  I thought the beer flavor was overpowering too.  I think next time I would use chicken broth and maybe some chili seasoning instead of taco. Very easy to put together.

Fabulous and easy recipe.  I used Corona beer and added the juice of one lime.  Also, used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  Husband and friends raved about the recipe.  So easy and so good!

Sorry to be in the minority here, but this soup was just ok.  I found it on the bland side, I thought the taste of beer was a little overwhelming and it made WAY more than 8 servings!  I don't think I'll be making it again.

GREAT soup! I cooked the soup on high in my slow cooker because I think the low setting isn't working properly. I used chicken broth instead of beer and used 4 boneless chicken breasts. The soup was very thick -- almost a stew.  I also used one can of tomatoes with green chilis and one can of plain diced tomatoes because the chilis are too spicy for me.  I will definitely be making this again!!

WOW...Awesome! The only changes I made were I used 6 oz. beer and 6 oz
chicken broth instead of the 12 oz. of beer. I also added 4 chicken breasts instead of 3. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is awesome!  It has to be the easiest to make on a busy day!  I have made this on several occasions including while we had company.  They loved it!  My kids beg me to make this every week.  I have made it with water instead of beer when I did not have any beer on hand and it does not have nearly the same taste.  The beer definitely makes it! A regular meal at our house now!

This was easy, fast, and tasty!  I thought it was a little salty, so I will try a low-sodium taco seasoning the next time I make it.

Awesome recipe! I rinsed the beans because I think the juice in the can is yucky, and I added some chicken broth to make it a little more soupy. Great recipe. Thanks!

Incredible!  Instead of tomato sauce I use a combination of tomato paste and hot taco sauce (husband likes his food HOT).  I would give it 5 stars regardless of the modification.

Extremely tasty and easy too! Hard to ask for a better soup recipe! A wonderful combination of flavors and easily adjustable if you want to add more heat, as I did. Don't bother trying this on HIGH, just set your crock pot on LOW and let it cook 8-10 hours. The soup tastes better the longer it cooks and it makes your entire house smell great! Served it with tortilla chips to crush on top... will make this one again for sure!

This is AWESOME!  I used chicken broth instead of beer and spicy taco seasoning (my fiance adds tobasco, he likes things hot) and it is super filling, warm and delicious!  The leftovers are just as good if not better!

I didn't have any beer, so I used 8oz of white wine (Chardonnay) and it was excellent!

This dish is AWESOME!  And it is SOOO easy to fix - you can't ask for anything more!  Husband and 10 year old picky eater also loved it.  Be sure to top with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream.

Awesome!  I had a brain fade the night before making this:  I had already put the chicken I'd be using in the fridge.  Then, right before going to bed, I thought about what I'd be making for dinner the following night.  Thinking "taco soup", I promptly took some ground beef out of the freezer and put IT in the fridge too.  So...I used both in the soup, and it was great!  I loaded up on the spices and added some garlic and Tapatio.  It had just the right amount of heat for all of us.  I served it over tortilla chips, adding sour cream, cilantro and cheese to the top.

This was really tasty. The kids loved it! I didn't have chili beans, so I used a can of pinto beans and added half of an envelope of dry chili mix. I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a 4 oz. can of green chilies instead of the combination of the two in one can only because I didn't have it. I also added half a can of water because my mixture looked almost too thick and the water seemed to make it the perfect consistency.  I used about 8-9 frozen boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins (Costco) and placed them on top of the mixture as the recipe states. I will be making this one again!

The only reason I gave this four stars is because my kids didn't like it. I forgot to add the beer, but it was still delicious. My husband ate ALL the left-overs.

Loved it!!  I'm a working mom and this was soooooo easy.  I didn't have the exact beans called for in the recipe so I put in whatever was in my pantry, kidney and white beans.  They worked just as well.  Made this for a girls night out and they all wanted the recipe.  Definitely adding this one to my collection.

Loved how quick and easy it was to put together so based on that I will probably make again. Thought the flavor was good, but nothing to rave about. Remembered the next day that I had forgotten about the sour cream, tortilla chips. Was definitely better the 2nd day with these additions. The sour cream really makes the dish!

This was so easy and such a hit with my guests.  I added two packets of taco seasoning. I used 6oz of Corona and 6oz of chicken broth. It slow cooked for over 7 hours before I shredded the chicken, and it still turned out great.  I will make this again!

This is a very tasty recipe. I made it at my house and all the neighbor kids happened to come over and they loved it.  I then made it for a church function and people wanted more more more!  I would not recommend leaving out the beer as some  of the other reviews have stated.  The alchohol helps tenderize the chicken (cooking it for a long time does that also).  I would recommend using a decent beer with good flavor though (I used Stevens Point Amber--inexepensive and tasty).

This was so good.  I was not too sure about using chicken in a red chili, but I am so happy that I tried this. I did not use the beer, but replaced it with the same amount of water and a tablespoon chicken bouillon.

This recipe was so good.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I left out the chili beans because I didn't have any.  I poured into bowls and topped with the shredded cheese and sour cream and it was to die for.  thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely a keeper! Instead of beer, (didn't have any in the house)I used low-sodium chicken broth - it turned out fantastic! We garnished with sour cream, tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, and green onions - YUM!

This was fantastic, at first I thought it was more of a soup...but once I shredded the chicken it thickened up. I servered over tortilla chips.

This was a really tasty soup. Easy too! I like beer, but I could take it or leave it in this. Will make again though.

This was pretty good. I used pinto beans instead of chilli beans. Could have used a bit more spice though.

Very easy to make -- I forgot to add the beer and it was still good! Sour cream and cheese (with a side of cornbread) go well with this recipe.

Absolutely the best!  We serve this with tortilla chips and sour cream.  The kids aren't crazy about it, but they don't like anything from the slow cooker.

WOW!!!  This was PHENOMENAL!!!  Easy to make and DELICIOUS!!!  I made dinner for my boyfriend and I last night.  I served this soup with "Absolute Mexican Cornbread".  YUM!!!  I made this recipe exactly as stated EXCEPT I added a half-can of green chiles AND a half-can of jalepeno peppers.  It gave it a nice zing, which my boyfriend prefers more than me (It wasn't TOO hot!)  Thank you:)  Oh, I should, also, state that I didn't cook it as long as it states in the recipe.  I made the chicken seperate and then shredded it before adding it to the crockpot.  In total, I probably cooked this four hours.

I made this for a "Girls Night In".  And all of my girlfriends absolutely loved it and it was nothing to make.  Two of them took leftovers home to their husbands and called me the next day for the recipe.  Definitely try this one!

Great on its own, and ridiculously good with sharp cheddar, sour cream, and tortilla chips!  And the crock-pot makes it so easy.  For lovers of chili and Mexican food alike, this recipe needs to be in your collection.

Great recipe Patti!  I have a treasure of wonderful soup recipes...but this one is SO good...I think it deserves first place!  We served it over tortilla chips with sour cream and shredded cheddar.  There were no leftovers....shucks.

AWESOME!  Added some crushed red pepper because we like it spicy.  I added 1 more can of corn and another can of tomatoes to make it thicker- more like a chili.  Reduced fat Sour and cheese made this even healthier! The man and the dieting roommate loved this!  Even sent it to mom.  Thanks!

This soup is excellent and soooo easy!
The only substitutions we made were like Picknicki, we used frozen corn... and like Sue9688, we used 16 oz. plain diced tomatoes along with a 4 oz. can of chopped green chilis.  This soup is now a family staple!

I've never bothered to review a recipe before, but this one was so good, I had to. Easy as can be, tastes very similar to chicken tortilla soups that have much more prep time. Made with Taco Seasoning I (by Bill Echols) also found on this site, excellent!

This was a great and simple recipe.  I actually didn't use the slow-cooker.  I just used pre-cooked chicken that I diced up.  Then I just dumped everything into a pot and let it heat on the stove.  I did use Rotel tomatoes instead of the regular tomatoes and chopped onions.  It was even better the second day!

This was an awesome soup. I used chicken broth instead of beer, added an extra pack of seasoning, and used 1 can of regular diced tomatoes instead of the two with green chiles. I brought some in to my co-workes and they loved it asked for the recipe. Next time I will add an extra can of beans and corn. I like my soup a little chunky.

What an awesome soup!  My entire family loved it, even my three year old!  I didn't change anything when I made it and it turned out perfectly.  It freezes well, too.  It's a special treat to serve it with all the taco fixin's :)

This recipe is perfect just like it is!  If you like Tex-Mex food, you just try this.  And it freezes well--if you have any left over.

Was a hit.  Made it for my oscar party.  I prefer a tortilla soup personally over this kind of soup because I like the lime flavor but people seemed to like it.  They called it Chili.

I made this for my husband and sisters...they all LOVED it!  It's an easy recipe and very flavorful.  I will probably add a jalepeno and cilantro for a little added flavor next time.

Totally Awesome!!  I took this to a friends house for dinner and it was loved by all.  I plan on making this again and again.  I used chicken stock, I don't keep beer on hand, but I want to try it with beer to see what the difference is.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe!  The fact that I can just throw everything in a crockpot and come back home hours later to a fabulous-smelling house is so great.  I followed the recipe exactly, using Corona, and topping with some cheddar cheese.  Thank's for a great recipe!

There are not enough stars for this soup.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, I have served this soup to wants the recipe.  It is the BEST.  I did use 1# ground beef, instead of chicken. Makes a big crock pot full.  Enjoy!!

Very Good and flavorful.  Made the soup less the chili beans .  Black beans were sufficient.I used the diced tomatoes with mild green chilies and the soup still had alot of flavor.

I feel a little bad rating this dish the way I did, only because everyone else thought this recipe was fabulous.  I made the recipe "as stated" and thought it was good, but nothing spectacular.  It tasted more like a very thin chili.  My hubby thought it was SUPER, but me and my kids didn't rave over it.  I'm glad I made it...it was a nice change, but it's not something I will make often.  :(

This recipe is excellent.  It reminds me of 'Chicken Tortilla' soup I have had in restaurants.  It is so easy to prepare, smells great while cooking, and tastes amazing.  If you like spice, I would recommend using hot chili beans, and tomatoes with spicy green chilis.  Overall very tasty!  I will make this again and again.  I did not service with chips or sour cream to save on the calories, and it was still fantastic!

Great soup. My picky daughter ate two bowls and my husband raved about it. I cooked on the stove, because I didn't have time. I think fresh grated cheddar cheese on top is key and I served tostito chips and sour cream on the side. Yummy!

Very hearty and very easy! We also served it with cornbread and it was delicious. After reading some other comments I spiced up mine with chili powder and red pepper flakes and I'm glad I did. It had just the "zip" we love. I will make it again and again.

This soup was fantastic!  Next time, however, I'll use regular diced tomaotes and add a little bit of chilies (it was a tad too spicy for my kids)

This was wonderful. It had great flavor. I did add rice which received great compliments. I put in about 1 cup of cooked rice and about 1/2 of the chicken. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using a package of fully cooked shredded chicken to cut down on time. Everyone at the Superbowl Party liked it! Next time I'll try it without the beer to see what the difference is in taste! Super easy, super yummy!

Delicious! I substituted the beer with chicken broth because I don't like the taste of beer, and it turned out wonderfully. I will be making this again for sure. Yum!

I absolutely love this recipe. I used 1/2 dried minced onions instead of 1 chopped onion, and it turned out just wonderful. I served it with quesadillas.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight and we loved it.  Only thing I changed is that I added an extra packet of taco seasoning and some extra green chiles because we like our food a little spicy.  Excellent dish and very easy to make.  Thank you!

This soup was pretty good, but it had an overpowering beer flavor even after cooking on low for 7 hours.  I will use water next time.

This soup was a HUGE hit for our family!  It was very easy to prepare and it had great flavor.  The only change I made was that I added regular diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chili's.

This soup was pretty good, but not as good as the tortilla soup I make simply by adding some Safeway Chipotle Salsa and lime juice to broth w/ corn, beans, veggies, chicken, etc.  I will stick to that, though I may start doing it in the crockpotto make it even easier.  This soup had a bit of a funny aftertaste, and the seasonings weren't robust enough for me.  Adding some fresh lime juice and more spices (including ground dried chipotle) helped a lot.

This recipe is great!  I did use chicken broth instead of the beer and added some of the suggested spices.  My Dh loved it! It was a little too spice for the kids (2 and 4 yrs) so next time I will try to tone it down for them.

So simple and delicious! I had to substitute a few ingredients, as our small grocer didn't carry some things. I used kidney beans instead of chilli beans. I used Sprite instead of beer. I used plain-diced tomatoes and a separate can of green chillies. I also used a bit more seasoning.   One reviewer had said that someone had to be home to shred the chicken and another had said to precook and shred the chicken first but neither is necessary.  When I made it, I followed the directions but had to leave it over night to cook (about 10 hours).  I shredded the chicken right before I served it, mixed it in and it was perfect! I topped it with chips, cheese, sour cream and (my most favourite addition) a sprinkling of fresh cilantro. The next day I used it as a burrito filling, that was yummy too.

This is an excellent and very tasty soup.  The only downside is that someone has to be home to take out the chicken breasts to shred them.

Excellent soup! I only used one can of tomatoes since thats all I had and the consistency was great when ready to serve. It thickened too much after it cooled though, next time I will use both cans called for. Also, you MUST add the sour cream, chips and cheese toppings. They make the dish!

WONDERFUL! I used Ortega Smoky Chipotle taco seasoning and only 1 can of beer. I let it cook for 8 hours instead of the 5 that the recipe states. We served it OVER tortilla chips and topped with sour cream and shredded cheese. YUMMY!

I followed the recipe exact, except that I used a whole chicken – the flavor was out of this world!  It was effortless to put together, of course, until I had to debone the chicken, but honestly, it was so worth it and I will cook it this way again and again!  Beer of choice – Budweiser!  We poured this yummy soup/chili over crushed tortilla chips and then added a little cheddar cheese and sour cream on top – DELICIOUS, my whole family loved it!!!  Thank you for sharing!!

This came out great - my husband really loved it. The only thing I would do differently next time is add half a bottle of beer, rather than the whole bottle. I like beer, but the flavor overpowered the seasonings a bit. Of course, it could have just been the brand of beer I used (a poplular Mexican beer). We'll definately make this one again!

A touch too simple for a spiceoholic such as myself. I threw in about a teaspoon of cumin and mexican chilli powder, along with two tablespoons of minced garlic, a large chopped green pepper, and a few sliced up roasted red peppers; thanks for the head start!

This was great!  I substitued the beer with chicken broth, as suggested by other reviewers.  For anyone who has had Hacienda Mexican Restaurants' Chicken Fajita Chili, this is very similar.  We ate our first bowl with a dollop of sour cream & the 2nd bowl without.  Liked it better without.  I also put crushed tortilla chips in mine.  Will definitely make this again - only next time will DOUBLE the recipe so we have enough leftovers!

Very easy to make.  Very healthy.  One problem I had was that I used homemade taco seasoning (Bill Echols from this site) and for me it was too spicy.  Will make again with packaged seasoning.  Also I expected more of a chili consistency and it was more soupy.  When I make it again, I will cut out some liquid, perhaps less beer and I will drain the tomatoes.  Overall a good soup for a cold day!

Love this!  Started too late for slow cooker though so simmered it on the stove for an hour, then added chicken and simmered it for another 1/2 hour or so.  The kids loved it with cheese on top!  My husband and I ate it with cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips!  Next time I'll do it in the slow cooker!

We loved this soup - my husband was a bit put out that I used his last bottle of Anchor Steam beer, but did the soup ever taste good!  I had to use Google search engine to find the recipe though; it didn't come up in a search from the AllRecipe site...

Chicken is so tender and the flavors in this recipe are vibrant!  I prepared it exactly as directed and it is perfect in every way.  Not spicy, just flavorful.

I was really disappointed with this recipe; it is definitely not a 5 star recipe in my opinion.  It basically tasted like canned vegetables flavored with  soupy taco seasoning.

This was good, but I have another taco soup recipe that definetly tops it.  Not bad, but I won't make this one again.  Also, I left out the beer.

This recipe is wonderful!!!! I made it for my husband and parents one night, and everyone loved it. My husband took leftovers to work the next day, and said they were even better, and everyone in his office asked for the recipe.

I don't like beer, so I used low-sodium chicken broth.  I also added chopped carrots and zuchinni and a little cumin.
Very tasty.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I highly recommend it! I have eaten the leftovers almost every meal since I made it.  It is easy, delicious, and has lots of healthy vegetables. I did use chicken broth instead of beer.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
