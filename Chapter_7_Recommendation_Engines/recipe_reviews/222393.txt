I make this recipe all the time and LOVE it!!  It is great with steaks or chicken.  Sometimes I cut Kale or Spinach for a little added nutrition and add it in as the wine is simmering off.

These are so very yummy.  I almost liked them more before I added the wine, but they are good either way.  I did use cabernet sauvignon, but I don't think that would make that big a difference in the final product.  The browned butter is what really made the difference.  I've always cooked mine in butter, but the browned is really great.  Thank you ever so much!

This was just jampacked with flavor!  I used large white button mushrooms and cabernet sauvignon instead of pinot and it was just amazing -- the hit of the show!  The mushrooms cooked a lot quicker than the amount of time stated in the recipe so will adjust accordingly next time.  Thank you for this keeper recipe!
