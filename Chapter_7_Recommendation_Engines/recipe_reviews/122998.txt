I added a little extra spice when I made this, and I didn't use any allspice because I didn't have any on hand. The cinnamon is a special touch, I will make this again! A comfort food with a lower fat content.

Well, my wife just made this for dinner tonight. What can I say, she is the greatest cook, but even she was powerless to overcome the combination of the ingredients that blend into a most unusual meal. We spent the entire meal discussing what was wrong with the recipe. I don't think a combination of ground turkey, hominy, and canned tomatoes could produce anything better. This recipe could also be named "Turkey, tomatoes, and hominy unwrapped". It may not be as funny if you weren't there.

Thick like a chili, chunky like a stew. Tasted much better than I anticipated. Lightening fast too. I added a 1/2 cup of pureed cauliflower and about a tablespoon of sour cream. Could use a bit more salt. Tasted great and very filling.

I didn't have turkey on hand so I used ground hamburger.  I also had only one can of hominy.  It was still very tasty and everyone, even my 3 and 4 year old liked it. I served with rice, but will probably serve with noodles next time.

This recipe is worth trying - especially if you are looking for something different to do with ground turkey.  I didn't have ground mustard, and it turned out fine.  The smell and mixture of flavors is really nice - the texture combo may take some getting used to.  My 3 and 6 year old ate this over pasta and didn't complain!

Sweet, spicy, and very tasteful.  The hominy gives a great contrasting texture to the ground turkey.  This recipe might go good with gorditas and some mild cheese.

While I completely changed this recipe to suit my own tastes, I couldn't have done it without the advice from other reviewers and the original recipe itself. Great base to start from.

Paired with cornbread and a green salad, this chili was a quick easy meal for a week night.  I found the 2 cans on Hominy a bit overwhelming.  Now when I make this I put in one can of hominy and one of black beans (both rinsed).   I've also been adding a touch of Chipotle and a little Ancho to add a little more richness to the flavor.  Great as written, easy to make your own riff.  Highly recommend

This flavor of this dish reminds me of some of the ingredients in chili made in the Cincinnati area.  This dish was much better than I thought it would be.  The mixture of flavors combined with the contrasting textures of the turkey and hominy makes this recipe one we we make again and again.  The best part is that it is low-fat!  Yummmmm!

I had ground turkey that I HAD to use, so when I saw this recipe, I thought I would give it a try.  I knew that I liked the ingredients on their own, but was doubtful that this was going to be something my whole family enjoyed.  Wow!  Was I WRONG!  I had to beat the teenagers off with a stick!  They went on and on about how good it was (and you know teenagers are not generous with their compliments!).  I  served it over rice and had NO left overs.  I'm very excited about this recipe because its healthy AND my kids love it.  Thank you for sharing it!

This was a great dish and really easy.  We like it a bit spicy so I mixed in about 1 tsp of red pepper flake right before served it.

Great meal and a family favorite.  I would suggest only using the chili powder and cumin; skip the mustard, thyme, cinnamon, and allspice.  I opt to add a splash of red wine vinegar and a teaspoon of sugar instead.  Delicious!

Pretty Good, I gave this a 4 start rating because I thought that it could have been a little bit more spicer for the taste, but over all it was delish...I also changed a few things, I started with 2lbs of Ground turkey, and instead of just using tomatoes I used zucchini's in tomato sauce and that added more veggie, always a good thing.  I also added 1/2c of water to rinse out the cans and that kept the mixer moister.  I only put one can of hominy, because that is all I had.  I put this over spaghetti squash, to eliminate some of the calories.

This is pretty tasty when made through the slow cooker, but with some changes. Notably without the mustard and allspice, and the meat was browned before added to the slow cooker.  First time round it was a bit soupy and sweet. Second time round we added yellow corn, chopped green pepper and onions, and drained tomato chunks. Came out less sweet, not soupy and delicious with a side of veggies and mashed potatoes. Also works well served over a bowl of rice.  This is goes into rotation for dinners every so often.

I had some leftover hominy and found this recipe.  As the other reviewers suggested, I upped the spice amounts.  End result was hearty and tasty.  My husband and I ate it like a chili, but it would be good over pasta or rice, too.

A very different flavor!  I made it according the recipe, except I scaled it back to make 6 servings.  We liked it.  I served the turkey mixture with warmed corn tortillas and sprinkled with just a little cheese.  Served this way, this recipe makes a sort of California turkey soft taco.  It was so easy, too!

If you are expecting a spicy Tex/Mex posole, this isn't it, but it never promised to be. 
Not spicy, but unique and very quick and easy.
