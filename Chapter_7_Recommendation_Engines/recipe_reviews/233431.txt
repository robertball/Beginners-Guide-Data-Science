Sorry...couldn't give it a five. Instead of using all canned goods (because of so much sodium). I went with frozen corn and bag of black beans. Also used real chicken breasts. Cooked the chicken in olive oil and added some seasonings. It takes longer to cook this route, but in the end it was worth it. Made a full to the brim pot, and it was gone before the Chiefs game started.

This soup is probably not meant to be the healthiest, best, "good-for-you" soup; it's meant to be quick, easy, filling, and tasty, and it definitely fulfills that in a big way. The good thing is that you can easily make changes that will up the "healthy" factor: use left-over cooked chicken, add frozen whole kernel corn instead of canned (both of which I may do next time), make your own cream of soup, and on and on. But for a cook who's been at work all day and needs a fast, one-dish meal for a hungry family, this is it!

I found this recipe back in college and it was cost efficient and tastes great! however, I added some spices to the soup to give it more Mexican flare, I added dashes of red pepper, cumin, and chili powder, and serve it over tortillas with sour cream dollops. mmm!

I was amazed at the flavor of this soup. I used two cans of broth and omitted the condensed cream of chicken soup. To get the best flavor-bang, I used Rotel Tomatoes with Green Chiles, Cilantro and Lime. The third time I made this, I used Fiesta Corn, which contained red/green bell peppers.  Great with tortilla chips or cornbread.

Super quick and super easy. I used vegetable broth and cooked/diced some chicken, but I love that you *could* just throw in canned chicken. Really liked the Rotel flavor. We don't mind if the soup base is dark, so I didn't bother to drain/rinse the black beans. Will try the addition of taco seasoning next time. Sodium wasn't a big issue as most of my canned ingredients were low-sodium ones.

We love, love, love this soup.  It is so quick and easy to make.  I double the recipe, triple the broth and add a can of green chili's.  Garnish with tortilla chips, cilantro and shredded cheese.  YUM!

This was fine and quick for a lunch type soup. I. Didnt have the canned chicken and dislike chili peppers in a can in any form. So, I left out the canned chicken and used canned diced tomatoes and added about 1/2 teaspoon of Penzeys taco seasoning. It was fine with toppings. Not as thick as pictured, but I didnt add the meat. Definitely not a low sodium soup, but fine when pinched for time.

Used a rotisserie chicken and added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and a little tapatio. We ate the leftovers the next day and it was even better!!

Decent, quick and super easy. Except, for the canned chicken. Use real chicken or skip the chicken all together. The canned chicken doesn't doesn't have good flavor or consistency in this soup.

So easy and so good. Not the healthiest soup ever, but everyone needs to indulge once in awhile. I've made it with canned and left over chicken. Excellent both ways.

This is a great, hearty soup.  You can mix and match what goes into it.  I always add a little cumin and some other spices per taste and add sour cream and cheese for toppings.

Fabulous! So easy and ready in about 25 minutes. This soup already has everything you need for a complete meal but if you want to dress it up, serve with guacamole and tortilla chips or a salad. Or add garnishes like cheddar cheese and sour cream. Both my husband and my son loved this.  Very good for something you can throw together so fast! 
(I prepared it exactly as written in the recipe).

It was a great base. I didn't have some of the ingredients it called for so I improvised. I used 2 cans chicken broth, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 can of corn, 1 can of northern beans, 1 can tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano, rice, and rotisserie chicken cut up, garlic powder, ground pepper. It was a great soup to be able to get ready very quickly which was what I was looking for. Added cheese, sour cream and avocado when served. I enjoyed it and it made enough that I can freeze some for another time. Thank you Julie for your recipe I appreciate it.

Very adaptable recipe. Can swap chicken to fresh cooked or leftover rotisserie, canned corn and beans to frozen, pretty much to whatever cooking skill level you are at, this is an easy recipe to play with.

I made just a few changes. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken so the soup could be creamier. Also I used fresh chicken breast seasoned with cumin and black pepper. Added a little fresh cilantro after it was done cooking. Crushed tortilla chips and added avocado on top. Delicious, quick, and affordable. Will definitely make again.

Easy to make, better the 2nd day! I used rotisserie chicken, drained & cleaned the black beans, used low sodium ingredients for the rest, and threw in a package of taco seasoning! Great for a cool evening

So quick and easy to whip up with things I already had in the pantry. I followed the recipe exactly, plus a few dashes of cumin to spice it up a little.  Definitely not gourmet, but sometimes you're not looking for that. I will be making this one again!

I made this with leftover rotisserie chicken and Mexican tortilla broth instead of the regular chicken broth. It was so good. I think the cream of chicken soup made it nice and thick and the flavored broth gave it a great flavor. I love salt and pepper in soup but this one didn't need it.

Nothing fancy, nor the best, but this was a good quick, cheap and modifiable recipe. As others, I was afraid of all the sodium as a health nut. I boiled and shredded chicken, used frozen corn, extra low sodium broth instead of condensed soup, and low sodium cans for the tomatoes and black beans.  I also just used a can of diced tomatoes plus a larger can of green chilies.  Topped it all off with some tortilla chips and cheese.

I've made this numerous times! Instead of can chicken. I use real shredded chicken. Other than that... It's delicious! Just crumble some tortilla strips on top ... Sour cream or cheese and your good to go! Perfect for those cold nights!!

I switched a can of condensed cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of chicken broth. I also added a can of drained, rinsed pinto beans. I took it to a church soup lunch. A woman asked for the recipe. Shortly after that, her husband asked for “the real recipe”. He couldn’t believe the ingredients were all canned. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

All in all this is a good recipe.  I did not use cream of chicken soup, also added a few more items such as a taco seasoning, along with cumin, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Also used low sodium chicken broth. I use chicken tender strips to cut up in cubes and not canned chicken.

This is an easy last minute meal and I always have the ingredients on hand. I add some taco seasoning for a little more flavor.

I replaced the canned chicken for a shredded chicken breast I had.  It was absolutely delicious. My husband said a 10 and we’ll definitely add this to our favorite easy meal list.

I followed the tips from some other reviews. I added cumin, garlic powder and cilantro paste. I veganized this recipe  by substituting a vegan chicken protein and using a can of tomato soup instead of the cream of chicken that was recommended by one of the other reviewers. Also used veggie stock instead of the chicken stock. Super easy and received rave reviews from vegan and non vegan guests. Will make again!

I ended up using frozen corn and fresh broth but the “spicy” tomato’s really made the soup all worth it. It’s cheep to do and tasted great!

Easy to tweak recipe.  I served this to my elderly father and he loved it.  Note: Never purchase can items with salt added.  Only if you plan to keep the can for years.  Always salt to your taste. Besides salt is cheap.

This is my go to soup if I am in a hurry to get something fixed in under 15 minutes.  It is so versatile that you can substitute the beans and corn for what you like.  If I don't have black beans on hand, I use pinto and if I don't have corn, I use two cans of beans.  I also add an additional can of chicken as well as a teaspoon of Cumin to give it more flavor.

It's really quick, which keeps it on my to-make list. I really wish it had more of a strong flavoring, though.  I think its a little bland.  Salsa can substitute for tomatoes and chilies.  Sour cream and cheese are an extra that is great when you have time for it and aren't in a hurry.

I doubled the amount of broth and omitted the cream of chicken soup.  I've made it a few times now an I love to make it ahead of time so the flavors have to to just meld together.

I added more chicken broth just because I like to put cheese, sour cream, and quite a few crushed up nacho cheese Doritos in mine and I still want it to be a soup. It is delicious and SOOO easy to make.

Great quick recipe!  I had a little more time on my hands so I boiled a couple of chicken breasts, added olive oil and Italian seasoning to the pot.  I shredded one of the chicken breasts and I used about 20-22 ounces of the broth from the chicken breasts (put the remaining broth in freezer for another meal).  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1/2 c of chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic and a wedge of lime during last 10 minutes.  Mmmm mmmm good!

I make this all the time.  I just LOVE it.  Sometimes I use less chicken broth to make it more like a stew.  Sour cream on top is a must!

I usually have chicken breasts in the freezer, so I cook and dice one before hand.  After combining and heating all ingredients, I serve this with a garnish of crumbled tortilla chips, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, diced avocado and fresh cilantro.  I also make quesadillas on the side. I could eat this all day long!

Love this recipe! Add some salt, pepper, lime juice, and chili powder and it makes it pop. Garnish with cheese, avocado, and tortilla chips. Cost efficient and super easy to make!

Great! Changes I made were:no canned corn-frozen. No Rotel tomatoes so 1/2 if large can of crushed tomatoes & 1/2 sm can of jalapeños& no canned broth so used 3 c of boullion. Tasted so much like there were corn tortillas in it! Had fresh lime juice to add which lightened it. Also had chopped avocado to add. Delicious!

This is a great soup that my whole family loves. I make a few replacements with low sodium or fat free options where available. I also omit the canned corn and instead use a bag of Bird’s Eye Protein Southwest blend.  I’ve used both the canned chicken and fresh chicken. Great anyway you modify it.

I've made this several times. My girlfriend requests it about once every couple weeks or so. I've modified the recipe so that it uses less chicken broth and comes out less soupy. I also don't use the chili peppers, or sub in Jalapenos instead. We usually eat it on tortilla chips with sour cream in it. Guacamole may also be good with it, though I haven't tried this yet.

Ditto with fresh chicken.  Then tweak with chili ready or chipotle diced tomatoes and then add fresh chopped cilantro with about 10 min left to cook.  Now PERFECTION!

I doubled the recipe except for using just one can of Rotel. It still had great flavor, but not as much heat. It was perfect with some warm, crunchy ciabatta rolls.

very good - and almost too easy to believe.  Only change I made was added frozen peas.  Took to a friend in rehab and we enjoyed it together.  She had 3 bowls she like it so much.  I don't know how this is so tasty - but it really is.  I did use cream of chicken soup that had herbs in it... that and the peas are the only change I made... will make again and often.  Will definitely put these ingredients in our RV so when on the road I can make this when we don't feel like going out or getting the grille out.

I really liked it,  but it was too spicy for my kids.  It was borderline too spicy for me.  My husband thought it was the right spice, but did not really care for it.  Easy to make though.

This recipe was delicious! I added jalapenos and chopped onion for heat, as well as a little heavy whipping cream to make it a creamier soup. I also garnished it with a dollop of sour cream and cilantro, and Mexican cheese. Instead of canned chicken, I bought a pound of fresh chicken, boiled it, then shredded and seasoned it(with cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder). I know this was a lot of modifications...but it had a great starting point that is easy to manipulate. Definitely worth trying.

Always loved at social gatherings and potlucks.  Great base recipe--- but make it your own.  I add taco seasoning and seasoning for ranch dressing.  I use homemade seasonings but I am sure store bought would work.
