I made this for a good friend's birthday instead of the traditional birthday cake and it turned out just beautiful!  And she loved it!

Delicious flavor, but very very sweet to me.  Since I don't have much of a sweet tooth,  I would probably reduce the amount of cinnamon sugar on top to about 1 tablespoon and use a little less jelly next time.  Amazingly enough, the white pepper really did set off the sweetness of the fruit without being easily identifiable as pepper.   Mine turned out a tad bit too soupy, but I wouldn't fault the recipe for that. The fruit I used was at peak season and fairly juicy, so next time I'll compensate with a bit more cornstarch.  Aside from the time it took to slice the fruit, this was quick to put together and bake.
