just a hint Here is the sauce I use and it does not use ketchup:
1 1/2 tablespoons wasabi powder 2tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sour cream
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 tablespoon Tabasco sauce (or to taste)
1 green onion, white and part of green,finely minced
salt and pepper Growing up in New England and having seafood and seafood sauces my whole life, I did not much like this sauce. I was a bit hesitant to use ketchup anyway, to me ketchup is cheap and not worthy of good seafood. Personal opinion, but sorry, I did not like this. Will not attempt again.

This is very much like Super Al's Cocktail Sauce from this website (which we LOVE) except for the wasabi instead of horseradish.  We upped the wasabi for a little more bite and it was a perfect balance with the sweetness.  Keep cookin', Rachel! ;)

My first time using wasabi, and I found out that I love it! The recipe is perfect as is, but after mixing up the sauce, I tripled the wasabi! I will make a double batch of this for a family party this weekend when I make a crab dip. Thanks for sharing, Rachel!

This is a "great recipe" especially when using real wasabi rhizome (not the standard coloured horseradish).  Once you've tried it and have the flavour experience of your life, you wont ever compromise again!

Just wanted to update-I served this with beer-boiled shrimp to a group of "Potter-heads" for a Harry Potter party, and it was the first thing consumed! Just a superb recipe, Rachel--I would not change one thing about it. 7/11/07: Served this on a block of creme cheese with crackers at my 4th of July party--was a big hit. Used lime juice. Perfect just as written.

Absolutely awesome! I usually make my own cocktail with ketchup and horseradish, but the wasabi in this is going to go great with the Asain inspired dinner I am serving. I, too, doubled the wasabi and even added a bit of regular horseradish.

I was craving some shrimp cocktail but I did not have the horseradish and other ingredients I needed for the traditional sauce and I was not going to the store.  I found this easy recipe and I had all 4 ingredients.  This was a delicious sauce and it is much simpler to make.  I added more wasabi cause I like a good kick.  I will definitly be using this for my sauce recipe from now on.  Thanks for this recipe.

I doubled the wasabi as suggested by the submitter.  Great kick; great flavor.  Had it with a dinner of Asian Orange Chicken and Asian Coconut Rice, both from Allrecipes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Best cocktail sauce I've ever had! I quadrupled the wasabi because my boyfriend and I are big fans of it. I also added another teaspoon of brown sugar to dampen the "ketchup" taste. A note of caution on the wasabi: I made it immediately before adding it to the recipe, and I noticed that it had a lot more heat after sitting for a few minutes. We still enjoyed it, but if I made this for someone else, I would take it down a couple notches.

Positively amazing cocktail sauce. Following reviewer ktardiâ€™s lead, we used fresh wasabi rhizomes. By all means include the brown sugar; it mellows the tang of tomato ketchup. Our clients gushed over this sauce, which will in future be a staple on our menu.

I liked this with one change, I did not have wasabi paste so I used horseradish, instead of the 1/8 tsp we put 1/4 tsp of horseradish and that made it perfect for us. Good with fried shrimp but I would mix a little mayonnaise in it too.

Great cocktail sauce, I like it with twice the amount of wasabi as well.  It gives it some kick, but not too much.

Hello, I cut down the recipe just for a lb. of shrimp..I think it is GREAT! You can add or delete the Wasabi..and since it comes in dry form..You can always have it on hand. No need to go spend money at the store! Thank you Rachel ! :)

I really liked the idea of using wasabi instead of horseradish in a cocktail sauce, but the brown sugar was a mistake.  Ketchup is sweet enough as it is.  In my opinion, this sauce lacked depth.  I'll try the wasabi in my usual recipe which includes garlic, Tabasco and chili powder as well as lemon juice. Sorry I didn't like the sauce, but thanks for the idea.

I found this WAY too sweet as is. Quite a bit less brown sugar and more wasabi (or horse radish) will improve this a LOT. Unless you are a fan of overly sweet shrimp sauce I would find another recipe.

I hate giving bad reviews. I have tried to make this (twice now) And I DO like wasabi. However, this recipe is terrible. I couldn't stand it at all, and a couple of my friends cooking with me did not like it either. So, it COULD be me, but I did try it twice. (With a friend along the way the second time!)

We thought this was just ok, with all the different reviews it was hard to judge what to do and what not to do.  So we added extra wasabi, but we did not care for this so will for other recipes.  Thank you for the recipe.

Way too sweet, couldn't taste the wasabi at all, nobody liked it. My guests actually told me how much they disliked it! I will not make again. As is, it tastes like extra sweet ketchup. If I were Rachel I'd be a little upset about this recipe being named after me.

With a change in technique, this recipe is actually a pretty good one. Knowing that it would be gritty, I microwaved this mixture for 30 seconds. It smoothed the sauce out entirely.

Also, remember that sauces like this are 'to taste' so tweaking the wasabi and lemon juice a bit helps. For my family, I doubled the wasabi and lemon, and decreased the ketchup by half. Perfect in a pinch as I forgot to buy cocktail sauce at the grocery store today! Thanks, Rachel!

Even with a little tweaking, I had a hard time making this recipe work. I added a bit more wasabi, ketchup, and lemon juice. So next time, I'll try less ketchup, and a bit more wasabi.

I've tried a few cocktail sauces on this site and didn't find what I was looking for and have to agree with boonesdaddy.  I made two seperate recipes this original and yours and yours took the cake. Everyone gobbled it up, I printed it but you should post it on AR.

A wasabi-lover's dream!!! I even added MORE wasabi paste. The shrimp were gone in a flash. Thanks, I don't know why I never thought of it before.

I have been watching this display and enjoying the heck out of it! I decided to make this sauce tonight to see what all the hubbabullo was about...and I did not find that this sauce was all that great. Ok, kind of grainy on the tongue and sweet, but not great. Thanks anyway, and thanks for the entertainment (that is way I am rating this a 3---2stars for the laughs and 1 for the recipes)

I was not really pleased with this recipe/amount of sugar. The sugar in it gave a grainy texture, didn't blend well with the other ingredients. I am glad I tried this before my party, otherwise I would have been really embarrassed! That's why I love this site, too, I can see that other people found the same thing to be true about this recipe that I did. Thanks, All recipes for saving the day! And my party !

This sauce is hard for me to rate. I did not like the taste of it, even after adding more wasabi. The wasabi and the sweetness from the catsup & sugar were in conflict. Sorry, it wasn't for us, though my niece thought it was good.

Hey, I'm hanging out in China these days, couldn't find horseradish. But no problem finding wasabi paste.   I cranked up the wasabi and lemon.

First of all, this is a great version of 'coctail sauce'! I love the use of wasabi instead of horseradish, I'm a huge wasabi fan anyway. I just happened to find this recipe last week right after buyin a few pounds of fresh Louisiana gulf shrimp that I was planning to boil, this was a very good compliment for it! while others who reviewed it don't like ketchup cuz it's 'cheap', don't review a coctail sauce recipe. If you wanna use mayo, or sour cream, that's more like tartar sauce! Thanks Rachel, I loved it!!!

Just what I wanted - a cocktail sauce that was easy to prepare and ready to eat right away. I LOVE the wasabi in this. Nice bite that is easy to adjust. I find myself slathering my shrimp with this. Thanks, I would have never thought to use the wasabi.
