I think 1 1/4 cups of flour is not enough. if I understand right, 8oz of cottage cheese is about 1 cup. so when I added less then 1 cup of cheese, the dough became too watery and it is impossible to roll it even with floured hands. so or you add more flour or less cheese. but when you add more flour you need to add baking powder, maybe sugar etc... Or you can make cheese less watery, but I didn't find this step in the recipe description. finally I made cookies, but I didn't use hands to roll balls (because of watery dough), I just scooped the batter with a spoon onto a cookies sheet. Well they don't have such a beautiful round form, but taste good and smell lemon+lime ?? I didn't make the glaze because the cookies didn't turn as I expected.
