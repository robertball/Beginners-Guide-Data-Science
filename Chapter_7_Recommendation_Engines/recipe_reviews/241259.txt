I sure liked this. Fresh and not too sweet. I used almond milk in place of cow's milk. The maca powder gives it a butterscotch sort of flavour, different and nice but being new to maca powder I only used 1/2 tsp and thought it was fine this way. Thank you Krissu for sharing this recipe.

It was great! I used more ice, however. One of my favorite smoothies for sure! I'll definitely make it again.
