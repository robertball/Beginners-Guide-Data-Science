This was tasty and filling and pretty healthy, too!  I used all the ingredients (scaled them down a bit for our tastes) with one exception--the rice I had was basmati, so I cooked it beforehand.  I ran out of liquid in the pan to finish the cooking process, so I added a little bloody mary mix that I happened to have leftover from New Year's Day, and that made the final touch to this.  My leftovers will be snatched from us by visiting family members!  Thanks, Martha C., for our dinner!

Not recommended for children. It's pretty spicy. But it was delicious. I did not use the cumin, I thought I had some, turns out I didn't. Didn't need it either. Was just fine without it. One thing I did want to say was this recipe did not specify whether or not to drain the corn and beans. I did not drain the beans but I did drain the corn and it turned out a little runny but still good. I thought it was better than being dry. We just used bowls instead of plates.

Really quick and easy mex meal! Followed directions exactly and it came out great! Used already diced chicken breast from the grocer which cut down on time. Hubby and I both loved it, but he did add a couple of shakes of Frank's hot sauce on his because he loves it hot!

Cooked exactly as the recipe said and itâ€™s a huge hit! It has just the right amount of spice and a great flavor. Definitely making this again.

Defiantly a cold weather meal. I did not find it very flavorful.

Very good. Very spicy.  We added sour cream on top. Also goes well inside tortilla as a burrito.

Easy is an understatement. This recipe made a simple and filling dinner that the whole family enjoyed.  The spices bring just the right amount of heat!

Great, but a little spicy for most of the family.  Will try again without the chipotle pepper.

Wow!  This stuff is great!  Had some thin sliced chicken breasts and some leftover white rice from Chinese the other night and came across this recipe from an ingredient search.  So glad I did!  Cut the chicken in about 2 inch squares since it was already thin sliced. My rice was already cooked, so I put that in right before I put the cheese on top and let it heat up in the bubbling goodness while the cheese melted.  I'm sure the spices would have absorbed more had I cooked the rice in the sauce, but it was still spicy enough.   Served with shredded lettuce, sliced black olives and sour cream on the side when I needed to cool things down a little.  Hubs went back for 2nds and was happy I only had one plate.... because we now have enough leftover for dinner tomorrow!

It was too easy and tasty not to make again and again.
