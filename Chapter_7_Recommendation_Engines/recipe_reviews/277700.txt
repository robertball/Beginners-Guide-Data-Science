Loved it! My husband is Filipino and had 2 servings. I cooked on high pressure for 10 minutes and quick released pressure which took less than 5 minutes. I didn’t have thighs, so I used large chicken breasts and cut into thirds. I didn’t have peppercorns, and used 3/4 tsp ground pepper. Next time I’ll use 1/2 tsp. I also doubled the garlic because Filipino’s love garlic. Definitely will make again.

This is the best recipe I have made in my new pressure cooker. Very flavorful.
