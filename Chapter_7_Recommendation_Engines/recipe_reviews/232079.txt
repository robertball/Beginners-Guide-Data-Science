Make sure your asparagus is very dry to start or egg white will not stick therefore your crumbs will not stick. I mixed Panko with finer ground crumbs for extra crunch. I found finer ground crumbs stick better than course crumbs. Panko and  Parmesan is the best. I've tried different green and yellow squash, Zucchini, carrots and other veggies. I can hardly wait to try it on the outdoor grill.

This was marvelous!
Only difference I made was I used one WHOLE egg instead of 2 egg whites.

I sprinkled maybe 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. It was great! I also used some garlic powder. Yummy
