This recipe is absolutely AWESOME!!! I have tried several recipes from this site, however, have NEVER taken the time to review them, although I enjoyed most of them.  I had to take time to say, I'm from Texas, where he have chicken fried steak at almost every restaurant.  This TRULY is better than ANY restaurants I've ever had.  It's was just awesome.  Like others, I didn't use as much oil, or frying time.

This recipe came out pretty bad, but not inedible.  First they call for way too much of everything, the egg/milk mixture mostly went down my disposal, along with the huge amount of cracker mix.  And 3 1/2 cups of oil was a huge waste!  4 cups of milk made the gravy very very thin.  I think if you scale back on some of these things it may come out better because the taste was ok for all the problems I had with it.

Exactly like the chicken fried steak I ate growing up in south Ga. I would not modify this recipe one bit.  A few hints: be patient with the gravy because it will take a bit of time and constant attention to thicken, but it's well worth it.  Use peanut oil instead of veggie oil if you can, because peanut oil lends a great flavor. Peanut oil also heats at a higher temperature which allows you to flash fry the steak. This will give you a crispy outside and a juicy, tender inside.  Some people have commented that too much oil is recommended.  Whatever size skillet you use, pour enough oil to cover at least half of the steak.  It should not be submerged in oil, but the pan shouldn't be just lightly greased either. Serve this with homemade biscuits, corn casserole or creamed corn, candied sweet potatoes, and dark greens.

Awesome recipe! You definitely don't need all the oil as stated. One and a half cups is fine. Maybe the gravy is supposed to be a little bland, but to suit our tastes I seasoned it up with garlic and onion powders and more pepper. For the person who asked what cube steaks are; they're labeled as cube steaks and they look as though they've been run over by a truck. Happy cooking!

Wow! I just finished the last bite of this and it was wonderful. I took other reviewers advice and added extra salt and pepper to the beef, but it didn't really need it. I also used only 1/2 cup oil and it only took about 3 to 4 minutes on each side to cook. The gravy consistancy was just right. It turned out perfect and tasted just the way I've had it in restaurants. I will make this again but with the exception of the oil and less cooking time will follow the recipe exactly as stated.  Thanks for sharing.  Jeannie

This was a great recipe, it tasted like what I've had in restaurants.  However, like the others I used less oil, and for the gravy; I mixed half milk and half beef broth..nice flavor

Outstanding. Follow exactly but try these modifications. It's well worth the effort. Mashed potatoes are important. Use quality Round Steak and pound it to 1/4" to 1/2" thick. To the cracker crumbs add equal measures: 3 tbls. Onion Powder and Garlic Powder (POWDER, NOT SALT!) Shorten the cooking time by 5 minutes. Here's the payoff. Pour off all but a tbls. of the cooking oil. To Med. High heat add 2- 14.5oz cans of beef broth. Boil and scrape up brown bits. Add 1 tsp each, Onion and Garlic powder. Add 2 Large tbls. of mashed potatoes, stirring until they're dissolved. Make a roux of 1 tbls.  butter melted in the microwave adding 1 tbls. flour to form a paste. Incorporate into gravy. Simmer gravy to desired thickness. No additional salt should be necessary. You will not be sorry. I promise. Serves approx. 6.

Amazing.  I never thought I'd be able to make Chicken Fried Steak this good at home.  The gravy was amazing.  The red pepper requirment was clearly a bit much, but I went with it anyway.  I love spice, but apparently I was the only one in the house.  Next time I will add garlic and limit the red pepper.  And there WILL be a next time!

This was totally awesome.  The double dipping keeps the steaks from being greasy.  Also a good idea with southern fried catfish (using cornmeal for double dipping).  Never tried the crackers before.  Think that was what made it so wonderful.  Next I think I will try it with chicken breasts or pork cutlets.  Recipe should be great with those too.  Thank you very much.

An excellent recipe!  My first attempt at chicken fried steak and it turned out great.  Even the kids enjoyed it.  Other reviews put down on the blandness of the gravy, but if you put enough salt and pepper with it and cooking it in the pan drippings gives it exactly the right flavor for the milk gravy.  You have to have eaten this gravy before to know how it is supposed to taste like.  I only used about 1 1/4 cup of oil.  The amount called for in the recipe is really too much.  Hope others will enjoy.  I know I will make it again.

This recipe was great! My husband and brother-in-law loved it and asked for it again.  For the first time I was not only able to keep the batter from falling off, but I made gravy that tasted like gravy!  The only change I made was that I used buttermilk in place of regular milk for the steak.

I have tried a number of chicken-fried steak recipes over the years, but stopped looking after trying this one.  My only suggestion is to press the cracker mixture into the steaks, especially during the second dredging.  I also personally like to use half milk and half broth for the gravy.

This was the first time I had ever made this, not having grown up eating it. So even though it tasted really good to me, I wasn't sure. My husband said it was better than his mom's~so this is a keeper~ Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  My boyfriend had never had this before, but I lived in TX for a number of years, so I've had it many times.  I was so happy to see it looked and tasted just like it was supposed to!  He loved it.  I used veggie oil and did not heat it as high as called for because I used a nonstick pan.  It still turned out perfect and did not take long to cook.  The gravy did take a little while, though.  Be patient, it will get thick!

First suggestion cut the amount of oil in half at least.  You honestly don't need that much oil! For the gravy, mix the flour straight into the drippings to get less lumps than slowly add the milk 1 cup at a time until you get your gravy to the thickness you like.  First time I made this, 4 cups of milk made watery, thin gravy and I had to add nearly 2 cups of flour to get it to thicken properly.  Other than, this is a rock-solid true Southern comfort food!

Five Stars! I made it exactly as directed and it was perfect, I wouldn't change a thing. I had no problem with it falling apart as other reviews stated. I used tongs and a two pronged fork to flip them. Thanks for the recipe :0)

This recipe turned out perfect! I also used much less oil, and added Lawry's seasoning salt instead of plain salt for a little zip.
An excellent southern meal.

This wasn't as good as I expected it to be, considering the great reviews it got here.  Of course, I am a novice, so it's possible that I did something (or lots of things!) wrong.  The gravy was very bland.  Also, my steaks cooked a lot faster than the recipe said, so they were a little more brown than I expected.  As my husband said, "It's no Frontier Pies." (Frontier Pies is our favorite homestyle restaurant in Utah)

This one is definitely 5 stars.  I made this from the magazine this past winter, and it was a complete hit.  The steaks are crispy with the perfect flavor, and the gravy is a must.  Perfect comfort food for a transplanted Southern belle!

I wanted to make Chicken-Fried Steak because hubby and I always ordered it at JB's when we were dating and first married (it wasn't the best thing on the menu but we had a Starving Student card and it was buy one get one free....lol!)  This totally blew that out of the water!  For the saltines, I used Wheatines (whole wheat saltine crackers). I only used about 3 cups of 1% milk for the gravy.  I cut way back on the salt too, and used a mix of canola oil and sunflower oil (and a lot less than called for).  The meat was very tender and the breading was so good!  Served with garlic-roasted mashed potatoes and sweet white corn.  Yummy!

I followed this recipe to the letter(except for not adding as much red pepper and I didn't have peanut oil,so I used Veg. Oil) and it turned out GREAT !!!...Very filling...I served it with Home Made Mashed potatoes and corn.. I will be making this again and I passed this recipe on to my Mom...I used a 10" cast Iron Skillet,  so I didn't need as much Oil. A++++++++ Thanks for the new recipe.

Great recipe, crunchy outside and tender inside.  Definitely would add something like garlic salt to the cracker mixture to give it a little more flavor but other than that, it's great!!!  I used canola oil instead of peanut oil too.

This was delicious.  I made it with a very thinly sliced sirloin.  It cooked very quickly and was very tender.  Tasted a lot like Texas Roadhouse's Country Fried Sirloin.  We will definitely make this again!

My family loved this. It did take a while to make and I would cut down the amount of eggs and milk to half. I had too much mixture left over. Well worth the effort.

My family loved this recipe!!! It's the best one I've ever made. I use the cheaper cut of meat like round steak and pound it with a meat tenderizer mallet and it comes out really tender. I make this at least 3 times a month.

I've never eaten Chicken Fried Steak nor did I have the desire to, but my husband really likes it so I decided to give it a shot. He really loved it, he said it tasted just like the one he gets at "Chili's". I couldn't believe it but I really liked it to. I think the white gravy is what made it look "different" to me in the past but it was really good. The one thing I would change however is the pepper in the gravy. It was a little to spicy for my son, next time I will try half the requested amount.

This recipe is every bit as good as anything you get in a restuarant.  It was simple to make, but as always with frying it did make a mess.  Next time I may cut down on the amount of red pepper also as it was a little hot for my 16 month old daughter.  The gravy was good on mashed potatoes.  Other than the pepper if I make again I will not change anything.

Great recipie! I used chicken instead of steaks. The gravy was too bland, so I added some mushrooms, garlic powder and more black pepper to liven it up a bit. My Fiance absolutely loved it and raved that it was better than the chicken fried chicken at Applebee's; which to us, is tough to beat. This is definetly a keeper!

This was delicious.  It's the best recipe for country style steak I've done, and I've done a lot.  For those who think the milk gravy is bland, salt and pepper to taste, and add 1 tsp of white sugar.  Milk gravy is supposed to be subtle, not overwhelming.  Served with rice or mashed potatoes, blackeyed peas, corn on the cob, and sliced tomatoes...it's the perfect southern comfort.

I have tried several different recipes for Chicken-Fried steak but have been disappointed every time...not any more!  This was superb, the coating stayed on, the steaks were so tender and the gravy, (once I seasoned it liberally) was delicious over the steaks and mashed potatoes. My 8yo daughter informed me while I was dipping and breading the steaks that she was NOT eating that...guess who had thirds!!!

This is the BEST chicken fried steak that my kids and I have ever had.  No Texas restaurant that I've ever been to has even come CLOSE.  It was a little messy, but I knew that before I even started.  It's just par for the course.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I have looked high & low for a good chicken fried steak recipe & have finally found it!  I had 4 beef & 4 pork cube steaks/cutlets, so all of them.  Due to other reviews, I added alot of cracked pepper, onion powder & garlic powder.  My hubby said they were just as good as what he gets at his fave restaurant.  Make sure that your oil is high enough in skillet to cover the meat & must be hot enough, as well (won't be overly greasy that way).

I made this for my boyfriend, and he LOVED it....got a "Wow, this is GOOD!", which is definately rare.  Only changes I made were to decrease the crackers a bit, use more seasonings (Namely Alpine Touch, made here in MT), fry in canola oil as I couldn't afford the peanut oil, and served with Cowboy mashed potatoes (from this site...see review) and stirfried veggies.  Definately a keeper:)

This is my first attempt at chicken fried steak because I usually don't make fried foods, but my son who just returned from Texas requested it so I thought I'd give it a try. I was SO PLEASED with the outcome! This recipe was so easy. Just make sure that you make sure you make the crackers into very FINE cracker crumbs to ensure a great coating! Great recipe!

The key to having a great coating is to do as recipe says and dip in egg, in cracker mixture repeat. Also- to keep breading on make sure you have enough oil in the pan or yes it will stick and come off. It does make a big difference

An excellent, easy recipe that lets you stand back and collect the compliments.  My husband insists gets better every time I make it.  I tend to use the cheapest cuts of steak for this recipe, because pounding it thin tenderizes even the toughest cuts.  I find that the thinner you get the meat, the less time you have to cook it and the less oil it absorbs.  I also cut back on the oil to about 1/2 cup and added just a little bit more flour to the gravy.  A real family favourite!

Instead of beef I used chicken. This recipe was quite good; easy to make and quite tasty. The sauce ended up being a little bland so I added cayenne, salt and butter to kick it up a notch.

My family enjoyed this very much.  I din't use the 3 1/2 cups oil to fry--just 1/2 cups was enough.  I also used Morton Salt's "Hot Salt" (1 tsp) instead of the salt and hot pepper.  The Morton's Hot Salt has Chipotle and red pepper.  I also drained the oil and added margarine instead of the oil when making the milk gravy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had never made this before, and we had some cube steaks lying around, so why not.  It tasted FABULOUS! I think I was a little heavy-handed on the dipping and dredging though because I ran out of flour mixture.  The second time I made it I doubled the amount of crumb mixture and it covered MUCH better.  This is a keeper!

I didn't even try the gravy part of this recipe based on previous reviews.  The cracker twist is what really made this recipe work!  I added some seasonings along with the crackers, flour and baking powder mixture...it really helps to add more flavor.  I ended up frying the steaks, draining them from all the oil and then baking them in the oven for 15 min at 350 degrees.

Excellent chicken fried steak! Just like my grandfather made when growing up on a farm! I used olive oil instead of peanut oil and the taste was very light and good.

After reading so many great reviews, I had the butcher tenderize a couple of 1/2" round steaks.  Wow !  Great recipe.  The gravy turned out excellent, as well.  My 15 year old son made this.  Thanks.

Hubby raved about it, I thought it was pretty bland, but still ok to eat. The only thing giving any of it flavor was salt. The steak was very tender & juicy though (I used round steak cut about 3/4" thick). And the breading had a really nice crunch to it. If you're into heavy comfort food, this would fit the bill, but I like stuff with more "flair". Would make it again for the family though.

I'm vegetarian, but the rest of the family is not.  I made this last night and heard wonderful reviews.  I did not make the gravy, but used store bought instead (not enough milk in the house).  Typically, we taste and review recipes for alternation next time.  My husband and son said "make no changes, it's great!".  Definately a keeper!

Was very tasty! Mine cooked in less than half the time given. Next time I will double the recipe because the frying makes such a mess of the kitchen! (note: four steaks does not require 3 1/2 cups of oil--more like 1 1/2 cups--at the most).

I made this for my wife and mother-in-law, both of whom are pure Texan, and they said this was the best dang chicken fried steak they ever done ate!  They said it was even better than what you get at Calico County in Amarillo.  Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe!  I didn't crush the crackers fine enough the first time and it made the coating too thick in places.  On all subsequent uses, I've crushed the crackers to a fine dust using the pulse setting on my food processor and it makes a beautiful, tasty layer of crust.  Prior to cooking, I liberally sprinkle both sides of the steak with salt, pepper and garlic POWDER, then let it sit for 15-20 min. It really gives the meat amazing flavor before dredging. You definitely don't need this much oil; 1 1/2 cups should be enough. You need enough to reach halfway up the side of the steaks, but not cover. The cooking instructions are a bit long for both sides; 1st side should cook no more than 6-7 minutes or until all but the very top looks dry (there should be "puddles" of meat juice in the center areas, but edges should appear golden brown and fried), and the 2nd side 3-4.  Any more than that makes the steaks tough. We don't eat gravy so I can't attest to that part of the recipe so my rating is strictly for the steak itself. I can say that I grew up in Texas, and this equals some of the best CFS I ever had there, and far exceeds anything you can get at a chain like Appleby's or Chili's. It's even better than my mom's and hers was amazing!

Out of this world! The gravy totally makes this dish! I used a non-stick skillet and about one cup of olive oil, and mine turned out great. Very crispy coating, AMAZING gravy! Will definitely make again.

This is definitely the best chicken-fried steak recipe I've tried.  If you are looking for extra-thick, restaurant style breading, you've got to give this recipe a try.  I used venison backstrap in place of the cube steaks, and I couldn't even tell it wasn't beef.  I also substituted evaporated milk for the milk in the egg mixture, and made the gravy with evaporated milk too.  I like the rich, creamy taste that evaporated milk adds, and that is simply just a personal preference.  I plan on using this recipe every time I make chicken-fried steak in the future.

Very good!  The gravy did not have much flavor, so I didn't use it.  Instead, I combined cream-of-chicken soup with 1/2 cup of heavy cream and added a ton of pepper.  This gravy, minus the pepper, is part of another recipe on this site -- chicken cordon bleu -- which made me think of chicken-fried steak when I tasted it.  In all, this dish turned out very nicely.  Thank you!

The whole family loved this! I followed the recipe proportions exactly (minus the red pepper). The only revision made was to the gravy. You really do need to cook/brown the 1/4 cup flour in the drippings BEFORE slowly adding the milk. It seems thin, but you need to cook it for quite a while, stirring constantly, till consistency is what you want. Then it turns out perfect!! The reviewer who said they used an extra 2 cups of flour sounded more like they were making paper mache, lol.

This recipe was quite tasty!  Instead of peanut oil, I used veggie oil and only about 1-1.5 cups of it.  I would recommend seasoning the meat overnight.  Delicious!

This recipe is definately the "bomb"! I exchanged the peanut oil with olive oil. My husband's co-workers said it tastes far better than what they have ever had at any restaurant. This recipes gets two thumbs up!

My husband thought this was great, and he is a Chicken Fried Steak Connoisseur.  Next time I will tenderize the meat first. And I'm going to try the breading on chicken too.  Great recipe!

This was so good I'm from the south so I know what chicken-fried steak should taste like. This was fantastic I did some tweaking of the recipe some with more spices etc, I also deep fried it so that it would come out super crunchy. I served the steaks and gravy with mashed potatoes, corn and biscuits (I used the never fail biscuits) from this site

I am a beginner cook so I was nervous to try this recipe. However, I made it last night and it was a success! It was a little messy, but isn't that part of the fun of cooking? Will definitly make again!

I FOUND THE RECIPE TO BE NICE, BUT THE GRAVY DID NOT TASTE AS WELL AS THE PACKET COUNTRY BUTTERMILK GRAVY WHICH IS EASIER TO MAKE. I DID NOT LIKE WASTING 3 CUPS OF MILK ON A GRAVY THAT WASNT' THAT GREAT. THE STEAK WAS EXCELLENT.

This is a good recipe. I always use cube steaks  for chicken-fried steak and I liked the addition of crackers crumbs for the breading. I never use the amount of oil called for, just enough to brown the steaks nicely. I added coarse ground blk pepper to the crumb mixture. I didn't have red pepper and I'll be sure to use it next time. I like food with alot of flavor. Using 2 cups of milk always makes enough gravy for my family of 4 and it's really good with garlic mashed potatoes.

This recipe rocks! I've made this several times with the cube steak, but last night I was feeling somewhat adventureous and tried using portobello mushroom caps. It turned out way better than the beef! I had to double-bread the edges to make it stick. Also, I made sure my oil (canola) was nice and hot, and I turned them only once so the caps wouldn't soak up the oil. Make sure they are a dark, golden brown before flipping. If done this way, they don't turn out greasy, just juicy. Drain all the oil, except a tablespoon or two before making the gravy, which turns out just as good as if you made it with the beef. Yum, yum, yum - new favorite comfort food!

My whole family like this dinner. I am trying to make more things from scratch and eat healthier. We even added milled flax seed to the breading. I wouldn' change anything, but I did have a lot of extra crumb mixture and egg mixture. Also, I know we couldn't eat 4 cups of gravy so we cut that in half to only 2 cups. Definatly a keeper!

My husband and I felt this was "alright". I made modifications that other reviewers posted. I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. I didn't use 3.5 cups of oil - I just used enough to coat the bottom of the skillet and a little bit more. When making the gravy, I drained all the leftover oil and added about 1 tbsp of margarine. I also added only 3 cups of milk to the gravy and it turned out fine. 
I do agree - a lot of the dry and wet mix did go in the garbage, so you should scale the recipe down by servings. 
Overall, this was a very greasy meal (even though I drained the grease for the gravy and drained them on paper towels) for my husband and I. Neither of us could eat 1 each (we're in our mid-20's) and they were very small once they cooked and we only had them with potatoes - nothing else. The gravy was the best part, but this meal isn't worth the calories with the butter/flour/salt. Maybe if you really like Chicken Fried Steak, you might like this, but I wouldn't suggest trying it unless you have an iron stomach - or your idea of dessert is popping some Tums.

I have used this recipe several times in the past few months and it always turns out great! A few minor changes ~ I seasoned the flour mixture w/ garlic powder and greek seasoning.  As per reccomendations I cut the oil to 1/2 cup (it was plenty.  This is a great recipe for unexperienced cooks like me =)

I thought the recipe was very good. I used tenderized eye of round steak...it was very good, I think I should have pounded it more. I did not use red pepper (too hot) and I made the gravy the way I make breakfast gravy...drippings, butter, flour, milk and lots of salt and pepper SO YUMMY!!! I double dipped my meat :) and it stayed together very nice. I did not find this as messy as some have mentioned. Great Recipe!

This recipe was fabulous!!  My husband absolutely loved it!!!  I am making it again for my family (mom, dad and sister) tonight! I did follow another reviewer's advice and added more salt and pepper to the meat.  I also used a breakfast sausage based gravy instead.  I will definately make this more in the future.

This is great chicken fried steak!  I fried the steaks in 1/2 cup oil (instead of 3 1/2 cups called for) and it worked just fine.  I also didn't fry the stakes for the 14 to 15 minutes it called for.  It only took about 5 minutes.  It is a "keeper".

So delicious I couldn't wait to have leftovers!  Don't even *think* about cooking this if you want something light and healthy though.  Lots of oil, and you can't drain off the beef fat.

This is the BEST chicken fried steak recipe! I was going through my recipe box and couldn't believe that I forgot to review it, since we've been eating it regularly for about three years. I've had so many people ask me for this recipe. Putting the ready ones in the oven is a really good idea, since it crisps them up a little bit more, keeps them hot, and drains off some of the excess grease. I've noticed they are a bit soggy if I skip this step.

Off and on, I've tried about four other recipes for chicken-fried steak.  I'm glad I finally found this one...it's the best.  And I've never made gravy before, but this one was so easy.  Keep stirring and keep patient and it will come together.

This was just okay, my husband gave it a 3 1/2, so he liked it a little better than I did. I've never made this before, so I think I might not have put enough salt in the flour mix, plus I couldnt find peanut oil at the store and had to use vegetable oil. This might've affected the taste. I will probably try to make this again before I give up on the recipe!

I sprinkled the steaks with seasoned tenderizer then added 1/2 teaspoon of cajun seasoning to the flour mixture, we just like spicy.  This was good but think I will continue to deep fry mine at 365 degrees for 5 minutes and make butter based cream gravy.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now. It took me along time to find a good recipe and I still have not found a better one.

This was delicious! The coating was really crispy and crunchy and this had a nice flavor. I did miss the garlic I always use in mine though, other than that it was 5 stars. I was a little unsure about using the cayenne pepper, but I couldn't even taste it and no one else even seemed to notice it was in there. This made a LOT of gravy, so next time I am only going to use 3 cups of milk instead. I had to shorten the cook time on the first side by almost 2 minutes as it was starting to get really brown. I'm a Southerner/Texan and grew up on chicken fried steak and gravy, when I say this makes some good eatin', I know what I am talking about! Chicken fried steak is one of our very favorite meals. I loved this recipe. The second time I made this I tossed in a chicken bouillion cube to the gravy, just because.

I loved this. I have tried chicken fried steak at many restaurants and never really liked it. I really do not know why I even decided to cook this. I guess I was hoping that it would be better if I made it and my southern family seems to love chicken fried steak.  This recipe was wonderful. I cooked it with only enough oil to cover half the steaks since it seemed like too much oil was called for in the recipe. I also added a little more spices than listed. I included about a tsp of onion salt and a little bit of blackening seasoning added to the cracker, flour mixture and to the gravy.  I used about 2 1/2 cups of milk for the gravy and this was plenty for me and the sauce did not take too long to thicken. It was bland though until I added a little of the seasoning mentioned above. I will be making this many more times. My husband loved it too especially the gravy.

I used the recipe with a few hints from the ratings and my son raved.  I doubled the recipe because I didn't think a pound would feed my big eater and myself.  I could have fed at least 3 more people.  Great recipe, I'll make it again.

Excellent adaptable recipe for chicken fried steak.  Tried it with heart one time (cause we had plenty) and heart was ..shall we say...too tough.   If you do it with something other than the recommended recipe meat be sure you adjust your cooking times accordingly.

Absolutely wonderful. I added 1/4 cup Frank's red-hot sauce to the egg bath, and old bay seasoning to the cracker crumb/flour mix.

This recipe was easy to fix with ingredients that I already had on hand.  It's a little plain, not too seasoned, which was great for my family.  I ended up making the gravy and had way too much.  Think I'll add some sausage to it today and made sausage gravy and biscuits for breakfast.  I'd make only half next time.

The steak part was pretty good - it could have done with a little more seasoning in the crumbs though - but I didn't like the gravy at all. I ended up throwing it out, and using stuff from a packet instead.

This is the BEST recipe! If cooked correctly, it almost melts in your mouth! The important thing is not to overcook the meat! But this recipe is so easy and good.

I do not usually use recipes to cook, but I decided to give this one a try and it was GREAT! I chose not to make the gravy, but did use the leftover mixtures to season potato wedges. My husband loved it! I will definitely keep this one around.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used chicken breasts (flattened into cutlets) instead of cube steaks...and didn't make the gravy since I am the only one who eats gravy.  The breading adhered nicely the the chicken.  My daughter gave this 50 stars, and my husband said that it's a keeper!  Best chicken fried chicken since I left Texas...and I made it myself!!!  Thanks!

This was really good!  Great comfort food.  I wouldn't go as far to say that it is as good as restaurant quality (maybe if I had a deep fryer), but it was quite tasty.  The only problem I had was that the coating stuck to the bottom of the pan on the second side.  I didn't measure the oil, and maybe I didn't put enough in...that could be my problem.  I made the gravy as well, and it took well under 10-12 minutes to thicken up.  Probably only 6 or 7.

A couple things I would change next time but a very good recipe. Cut the oil down by half and I used olive oil because I didn't have any peanut oil. I used a package of country gravy and just added drippings like others suggested which cut down the time. And also next time I won't cook as long as recipe calls for I will cook for 10 min. total.

WOW! Really good! I cut the cube steaks into 2 pieces, then pounded the heck out of them until very thin. I fried in half canola oil, 1/2 Crisco. Cooked up very quick as the steaks were so thin. I used packaged country gravy mix and made according to the directions, then added 2 tbsp of the pan drippings for flavor. Saved time this way and was still delicious!

This is a great recipe.  The gravy turns out so delicious- tastes alot like the gravy at Chili's.  Yummy!  (I think the secret is to pound the cube steak really thin, and shorten the cooking time.)

The cracker crumbs gave this a really lovely crust, and the meat was SOOOO tender. The gravy was quite good as well. The only things I might change are adding a bit more salt next time, and dredging the meat in cornstarch as the very first step so that the coating doesn't "puff out" from the meat. (That only happened on one of mine.)

Oh, I cooked them a little differently too. Rather than pan-frying them, I deep-fried them for about five minutes each. (Before breading, the steaks were about 3/8 inch thick.)

I've never made chicken fried steak before--this was so easy--and relatively fast!  The whole family gave the thumbs up!

We love this recipe.  My husband, who is from TX, says almost as good as grannies.  We serve with mashed potatoes and fried okra...yum!

This was my first attempt at country fried steak and I was so pleased!  The breading was very heavy but it stayed nice and crunchy and I didn't have any trouble with it crumbling off the meat.  The taste was delicious, although I wish I could have tasted the meat a little stronger through the breading.  I paired this with Garlic mashed potatos and covered the steaks in a creamy sauce made with sharp cheddar and fresh sage, the sauce together with the steak was to die for!

This recipe was very good, the entire family enjoyed it! However, after reading the other reviews regarding the gravy, I was a bit hesitant to following the remainder of the recipe. I instead added 1 can of condensed golden mushroom soup and 1 cup of milk and loosened the browned bits from the pan and it turned out great!! Thank You!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!  We just loved it, loved it, LOVED IT! I was really craving some chicken-fried steak and this totally satisfied my desires.  I did read the rest of the reviews and made a couple modifications.  No modifications to that fabulous breading though, it was terrific! It was crispy and stayed on the meat during cooking.  I didn't have peanut oil, and I thought it seemed like a lot, so I used 1 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup veg oil.  Others I did follow the others and use only 3 cups of milk for the gravy, but I think I could have gone to 4 easy and it would have been just great. Overall just a fantabulous recipe.  Thank you!!

I wanted a new way to cook my cube steak and stumbled onto this recipe. I had all the ingrediants and saw the prep time and thought I'd give it a try. As a beginner in the kitchen it took longer to complete than expected but was well worth the time. The Meal was DELICIOUS! I never got such praise about a meal before. "It tastes like a dish you would order in a restaurant." I think I'll try it with chicken too!

Excellent recipe, I've already made it several times.  I skip the gravy part and make country style peppered gravy separately (from a packet.)

Very good. Messy. But well worth it. Make sure to tenderize the cube steaks though. The tend to get tough and gristly. I've made this twice. Will make it more.

Way to greasy with all of that oil. But good taste. Gravy was bland and needed something else. Will use canned gravy next time.

I halved the breading and milk mixture liquids.  Also, I used bread crumbs and substituted beef broth for half of the milk for the gravy.  The gravy was very flavorful and the cube steaks turned out wonderful!

Perhaps I just don't like chicken fried steak?  It was the first time I ever tried it but I honestly didn't like it.  I found it to be too bland and not at all worth the effort although it was quite tender.

This was SO GOOD!  This is the definition of Good Ol' Southern Comfort Food.  The gravy was lacking a little flavor, so I added some California Blend course garlic salt with parsely and it turned out PERFECT!  This recipe is a definate keeper!

Oh my, soo good.  This is what comfort food is all about.  I was'nt sure what red pepper was, so I doused it with chipotle chile pepper, excellent choice!. Used a sleeve of Ritz crackers, as I did'nt ave any saltines hanging around, and also added a good shaking of garlic powder to flour mixture.  Used remaining flour mixture to add to the milk mixture and just had a grand ole feast.  Thank you "Southern Living"

I made this meal for my family and they loved it!! I substituted chicken for steak and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. I would recommend downsizing the cracker coating and the egg/milk mixture to half. I ended up throwing half of it away. I will definately make this one again. Thanks!

The breading and gravy for this recipe are excellent!! However, I do suggest using tenderized round steak rather than cube steak, which doesn't have quite the right texture for chicken fried steak. Also, be sure NOT to remove any of the bits from the bottom of the pan when you remove the oil to make the gravy. Otherwise it will be very bland.

Very good basic chicken-fried steak. The coating browned beautifully and was very crispy. We liked the gravy too. I may have added more salt to the gravy. Salted what was needed by taste. Also didn't have to cook them as long. I think cooking time is really subjective to how thick you meat is.

Very Very Good.  I reduced the amount of red pepper to just a dash but other than that I made this exactly as the recipe said (I even counted the crackers which equaled 1 package). This was the best Chicken Fried Steak I have ever had.

Had to use my stand by packaged gravy because the gravy tasted awful. Steaks took a very long time to cook.

I don't think this was a five-star recipe.  The steak turned out extremely greasy, and the gravy was disgusting.

Also, the flavor was nothing to write home about.

This was a good recipe. Next time I will double dip and double batter the steaks so they have more toppings. This is the best I have ever tried though. Thanks!

This was alright, it didn't exactly blow me away.  I've never had chicken fried steak, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste.  Anyway, I would suggest that you pound the meat thinly, I didn't do that and it was tough and thick.  Didn't make the gravy, so I can't say if it was great.  Everyone else thought this was alright.  Probably won't be making again.

Chicken fried steak is not one of my favorite things to eat but this recipe is a good one.  The outside is crispy and delicious.  For the breading I omitted the all purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and used self rising flour instead.  I did this for convenience only.

Very Good.  I think maybe it could use alittle more seasoning, but other than that it came out crunchy and delicious.  I used my deep fryer to fry them, so they only took a small amount of time to fix. Husband loved it.

This is a great recipe!! My husband who is a chicken fried steak lover said it was perfect. I did follow some suggestions and use much less oil. Also my family has a favorite country gravy mix so I just used that but I mixed it in the skillet to get all of the left over "crunchy" in the bottom. With garlic mashed potatos this was a wonderful meal.

I've had chicken fried steak before, but not as outstanding as this! I used 6 cube steaks and I pounded them even more with my meat mallot because I've had them when they can be chewy,soI didn't want to take chances with these. They came out so tender you almost didn't need to chew them. You don't need all that oil,I used 1cup.My oil was hot so they cooked in about 5min. My drippings looked burnt so I got nervous and took some out.Then left the rest. The sauce was excellant, spicey but a little to thin, I will thicken more next time. Make sure you use a stainless steal pan for proper results and alot of drippings for a great gravy. Thanks Southern Living for sharing!

I loved this -  I thought it had great flavor and was very easy to make.  Since I am kind of lazy and I really like Pioneer Country Gravy, I made that instead of the gravy listed in the recipe and it was wonderful.  My husband said it tastes just like the Chicken Fried Steak he gets in restarurants - maybe better.

Steak was delicious and tender but gravy was VERY bland!! I added more salt, pepper and about 1 teas. of Kitchen Bouquet browning and seasoning sauce which really helped it get some flavor. I have lived all my life in the deep south and this was way too greasy for me! 1 cup oil is more than enough for 4 steaks. Will make again but will try to find a better way to make the gravy.

I've made fried steak many times over the years, but the cracker crumbs really make this version superior.  Don't know why I never thought to try it before.  I can't comment on the gravy since I ran out of milk and didn't make it.  Great comfort food!

This recipe was great. We are big black pepper lovers and the gravy was alittle too heavy with the pepper. Reduced the oil to about 1/2 c. and this was plenty.

I was craving chicken fried steak and instead of buying the frozen stuff, I decided to try to make it on my own.  What a great recipe!  I used about 1 cup of oil instead of what is called for (even 1 cup is a bit much).  The gravy was not impressive, however.  It was very bland and not what I was expecting, but I will be making this again, just with a different gravy.

Wonderful chicken fried steak recipe.  What else would you expect from Southern Living Magazine.  Make sure that you turn the steaks just as specified though. I left them on the second side for a little while longer and they turned out a little too brown.  Thanks Southern Living Magazine.

The breaded steak is great, but I was so afraid of using so much salt, I didn't use enough and the gravy was very bland.  But the meat is fabulous!  I used an electric frypan and slowly fried each side only once.  You must use all the salt recommended plus all the pepper and more white and red pepper to get the gravy to resemble the stuff in restaurants:  sinful!

This recipe was absolutely "THE BEST". I pride myself in my cooking abilites and working a recipe to fit my spicy taste. I really wasn't sure of the gravy directions. I followed this recipe to a "T" and is was the best chicken fried steak my wife or I ever had. I think I will subscribe to Southern Living if all their recipes are this good. Will use this recipe often.

I needed something new. My boyfriend loved it, he was full from one plate. My three year old and eight year old asked for seconds, and asked me to make it again for Christmas. And me I was lazy for the rest of the evening. I just wanted to go to sleep. Perfect with real mashed potatoes.

I especially liked the crisp and tender cracker coating on this.  The only things I did different was add some garlic powder to the cracker/flour mixture and used just enough peanut oil to come half way up the steaks as others have suggested.

This is the real deal.  I used less oil, and it turned out great.  The crust on the steaks was perfect, and the gravy divine.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been making this recipe for years, and this is hands down my favorite chicken fried steak recipe. Just as good as Cracker Barrel's. I make a few adjustments. I cut everything in the gravy in half, except the flour. Comes out perfect. I also cut the egg mixture in half as it is too much and just goes to waste. I make all of the cracker mix and only put what I need out to bread the cube steaks. The rest goes in a ziploc bag for the next time. Also, I only pour enough oil in the fry pan to sufficiently fry the steak in. Easy to make, and authentic southern!

Husband loved this but did make changes as other reviewers suggested: Less oil, half the milk and flour for gravy b/c this made plenty for us and it needed a little spice for more flavor.

This is a great recipe.  My husband is from Texas and this is his favorite dish.... so when I dove into this one I was a little nervous because I knew I was up amongst some fierce comparisons!  But he loved it.  The gravy is wonderful...

As a southerner I have been frying for years.  Everything...The ony thing I changed is I didn't add the cracker crumbs.  I am not a fan of dredging in cracker.  But there are so many other options..This is still very tasty...

This is a great recipe and is pretty easy. My hunny is super picky about foods that are breaded and fried, but he even loves this one. I do like to add just a pinch extra of the crushed red pepper to give it a little extra kick though.

This was very good, even though I had to make a few changes. I didn't have peanut oil so I used olive oil. It also didn't take near as long as stated to fry the steaks. They were done in probably 5-6 minutes total. Not the absolute best CFS I've ever had, but still good. :) I will probably still be on the lookout for the perfect recipe for CFC, but this one wasn't a bust. It was a little on the bland side..but not too bad!

This was FANTASTIC!! I have never had chicken-fried steak before, and this was a big hit with my family! I didn't follow the directions exactly...I used a non-stick skillet, and it turned out great!

Made this for hubby's birthday and it was a big hit. Didn't use crackers, used bread crumbs instead. Added more red pepper than the recipe called for and it was good. Added a lot more flour to the sauce than the recipe called for. Served with Ravenswood Red Zin and it was great. Will definitely make again.

This country fried steak came out beautiful and delicious.  I accidentally put in more red pepper than was called for and it turned out to be just the right flavor and we don't eat spicy stuff.  I also added some garlic and onion powder, and paprika to give more color.  My only complaint was that there was so much milk in the egg dip for breading, I'd cut that back by half bc it was way more than necessary.  I made my own pan gravy with beef broth.

I had some tenderized hip steak in the freezer I needed to use.  This was a perfect recipe, but I was in a hurry so didn't do the gravy, just served it on fresh buns with mayo, lettuce and tomatoes.  It was very tasty. I can't wait to try it with the gravy.

This was my first time making chicken fried steak. It turned out great! I cooked it on an electric, non-stick skillet with a lot less oil than the recipe called for and my husband loved it. For anyone who's never used this recipe before: With the red and black pepper, it's pretty spicy, so if you don't like that, you might want to use less pepper.

Not bad but I prefer to fry chicken and not steak.  Gravy was not good as is, I added about 2 or 3 tsp of "Better than Bouillion" Chicken flavor to give it more flavor.

I've made this twice now and each time it was fabulous.  the first time I made per directions but used a small deep fryer and it was great and quick.  the second, i pan fried but didn't have any saltines so I used crushed ritz crackers and that was just as great.  The gravy needs a lot of salt but is so worth it!  Will keep this around.

The meat turned out to be quite tender with this recipe (I turned the oven up to 300 degrees while the gravy was cooking), but we didn't care for the gravy.  It tasted too much like flour and pepper.  I did use skim milk, so the gravy would probably be richer if made with whole milk, evaporated milk, or cream.  But the meat recipe is definitely a keeper!

I was so happy to find this recipe in Southern Living!!  It is really wonderful.  My picky husband really liked it.  Don't skimp on the battering.  Cram as much of the crumbs and flour into the steak as possible.  It really gives it the wonderful flavor.  I have a hard time getting the gravy to thicken.  Don't be afraid to crank up the heat.  It will get done faster.  The saltine crackers are brilliant.

I always order chicken fried steak when we go out to eat, but this tops anything I've had.  I make my own country gravy rather than using the pan drippings. I also sprinkle the meat with meat tenderizer so the kids don't get tired chewing it. So very good!

By far this is the best chicken fried steak recipe I have ever made. They only changes I made was that I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil and I used chicken gravy instead of making the gravy from scratch.

I thought I hated country fried steak until I made this.  Honestly, the very idea of this meal kind of made me feel sick, but my husband loves chicken fried steak so I decided to try to make some.  I was wary of the crackers at first, but the steaks turned out perfectly; they have a nice, spicy flavor and a crispy coating.  I wouldn't change a thing about the steaks.  To make the gravy, I whisked in the flour first, and then slowly added the milk (skim) until it was thick enough.  The gravy (which I didn't eat because I don't like gravy) was apparently very bland, though.  It looked very nice, but just had no flavor.  I'm not sure how this could be pepped up--some beef bouillon and lots of pepper, perhaps?  I'll try it next time.

I would like to start by saying I hate to fry with oil!  But my husband wanted country fried steak so I figured "here goes"!   I LOVED this recipe, my husband thought it was a little spicy for him, so I will cut back on the red pepper a little for him next time.  I used 2 sticks of reg crisco, and that worked perfectly, and burns at a higher temp than regular veg oil without smoking or smelling terrible.  I normally dont use peanut oil for allergy reasons.  I also did not make the gravy because my husband hates white gravy, and I was to hungry after making this to wait for it just for me :-) I will DEFINATELY make this again.

This was really good!  I didn't have crackers, so I used 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs instead.  I will only cook the first side for 7-8 minutes next time.  Thanks!

Wonderful!  I am scared of frying, it always turns out burnt and smells up the house!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and let the meat come to room temp before coating, and really watched the temp of the oil.  I was amazed that it actually turned out!  My whole family loved it.  My 7 yr old son who is not a great meat eater actually ate the meat before the mashed potatoes!!

This was delicious and just how chicken fried steak should be. We would have given 5 stars except we felt it could have been a little more flavorful. Going to experiment with some seasoning next go around.

The first time I rated this a 3, it took me two years to try again but before i did i read the reviews over and over and used much less oil so nothing stuck to the pan. My husband complimented the meal over and over. Also, I only used about 1 1/4 cups of milk for desired thickness of the gravy.

Delicious and easy!  And I just used some ground beef patties that I had thawed and needed to use up.  I used a 10" cast iron skillet so didn't need quite this much oil.  I used canola which was all I had on hand.  The only change I'll make next time is to add a little more salt to the gravy as we like salt - even though it's bad for us!

Sinful but Yummy.  You don't need that much oil.  Use your best judgement.  I did add a little garlic powder, well you jost gatta have it.  Crispy on the oustide and juicy in the middle.  My first time making gravy and it even turned out great on garlic mashed pot.  Again very sinful, but ooooh soooo goood!

ooooooooooooooh myyyyyyyyyyy gooooooosh, this recipe was totally amazing. My husband is from Kansas and I'm from Canada and for the longest time he's wanted me to make chicken fried steak so I did last weekend.  He couldn't keep his hands out of the serving dish before we sat down and our guests were in heavan.  I will definately make this recipe many times over.  The only thing that went wrong was the gravy.  From using the drippings, it turned out brown.  The first time I ever tried chicken fried steak, it was served with a white gravy as in the picture so next time I make this I won't use the drippings from the pan.  Other than that, it was totally awesome.  Thanks!

This recipe is the absolute best for chicken fried steack.  The cracker crust is absolutely fabulous.  My husband says he could just eat the breading all on its own.  Excellent recipe!!

I have never had a dish like this before. I really liked the crumb mixture but the gravy ended up being a brown / pink colour and was pretty tasteless except for the occassional bit of pepper. Also I don't understand why this is called Chicken Fried Steak. There is no chicken in it and it tastes nothing like chicken. Won't be making again but nice to try once.

Excellent recipe!  I used tenderized chicken breasts instead of cube steak.  Added some onion/garlic powder and little more red pepper.  Used non stick skillet and worked great!  Truly a keeper recipe!

This was fantastic!  I did add more salt and pepper to the gravy, the red pepper gave it that extra spice.  We are going to try the same recipe on pork and chicken.  
My husband is one happy camper!!!!

PS Be sure to keep the drippings in the pan, and not throw them out with the peanut oil.

I grew up in Texas and loved Chicken Fried Steak as a kid and although this tasted good my husband and I agree that the quality of the meat really makes a difference. The breading was awesome but....if you want beef...go out and spend the money to get a good tri-tip steak instead...not worth the money and time to spend to make ANY Chicken Fried Steaks.......will never make or eat again.

Really good crust! We used whole wheat Ritz crackers because that was what we had and whizzed them up in the food processor. I especially like the addition of the baking powder since it makes the crust nice and puffy yet crispy. 

We used a packet gravy mix instead, so I can't vouch for the gravy part, but the meat itself was superb!

I'm allergic to peanut oil, so we used a stick of crisco and some vegetable oil to raise the smoke point.

Will DEFINITELY make again!!

Being from the mid west, Chicken Fried steak isn't one of my favorite foods in the world, but I do like trying other recipes. This one was pretty good, common sense tells you not to use so much oil, fried this up in my cast iron skillet and came out just fine. I did however add a bit of garlic powder to the gravy as it was a little bland. other then that, pretty dang good.

The steak was delicious- I liked it (and I'm quite a picky eater) and my fiance loved it.  I used regular vegetable oil (forgot the peanut oil at the store), and I didn't even use half of what the recipe called for and it was more than enough.  The gravy was bland and way too thick- and I didn't cook it as long as the recipe called for.  I will be looking for a new recipe for gravy, but will be making the steak again!

Very Tasty!!  I made a few changes though.  Instead of crackers, I used flavored croutons...YUM!!  They gave it a little different flavor.  Also, I cooked for only about 5-7 minutes, then flipped them for another 3-4 minutes because they were starting to get too dark.  I cooked with mashed potatoes & corn on the cob.

So tasty! I used 1/2 of the cracker mixture and 1/2 of the gravy ingredients and this made plenty. I also pan fried the steaks in about 1/2 inch oil.
The gravy is great on mashed potatoes.

My husband was very enthusiastic, and just loved this.  I enjoyed it, but felt it needed some more seasoning...or maybe just onion flavoring or something. The saltine coating was beautiful...nice and crispy...different from the usual breadcrumb coating that tends to get soggy if you have to leave it on a warming tray in the oven.  The cracker coating stayed crispy the whole time. I'll make this again.

Although I am not a big fan of fried foods, I made this for my husband and kids who are HUGE fans of this recipe.  I thought it was ok, but my husband and kids said it was an A+!  The gravy was not flavorful enough so next time I'll add something.  The breading was excellent.

I followed this recipe exactly as written using the stated ingredients. It was not greasy as some reviewers have stated (they may have changed the recipe). I would not change a thing.  It is wonderful comfort food.  I served it with mashed potatoes and a spinach salad.

This was time consuming to make and I really didnt care for it much, the only thing I liked was the actual cube steak without the gravy....it called for way to much pepper, we couldnt enjoy it. The gravy was way too spicy with all that pepper.

This is a good recipe if you really like chicken fried steak. It was still a little heavy for me and my husband and I cut the oil down to a 1/2 cup like was suggested. I can't imagine how greasy it would have been otherwise. Also if I make it again I will be sure that the steaks are really good and thin. The ones I got were too thick and I should have pounded them thinner.

AWESOME recipe!!  Just as good as the restaurant stuff.  Not real hard to make and so worth it in the end.  It was mouth watering and my husband (a picky eater) thought it was outstanding!  This will definitely be a family tradition!

Yummy!  I've never made chicken-fried steak before this recipe -- always go out for it!  This was soooo easy and turned out terrific.  I'm not a big fan of black pepper, so next time I'll go easy on the pepper for the gravy.

I deep fried this and it was done in less than 5 minutes. I never liked Chicken-Fried Steak much, but made this for my husband. I love this now! Plus, now I have a great recipe for white gravy, something I could never make!

I've never made Chicken Fried Steak, although it is one my husband's favorites.  I decided to try this for Valentine's Day and suprise him.  It was AMAZING!  My husband, who is very difficult to please, raved the entire way through the meal!  He said it was better than what he's had in restaurants.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

Unbelievable! This is absolutly the best recipe.  I didn't use as much oil as it called for (only 1 1/2 cups) and we used cutlerized pork steaks instead.  I bet you could even do chicken with this. Thanks.

This is absolutely fantastic.  The best I've ever had.  I don't make the homemade gravy, though.  Takes too much time.  I buy the country gravy at the grocery store.  You have to buy 2-3 envelopes so you have enough for leftovers.  One packet isn't enough.  Shannon

Great recipe. Best fried steak that we have ever had. So tender! A little hot, next time I will omit some of the red pepper.

We just finished dinner and everyone said it was delicious. I actually had 8 small deer steaks and had enough to cover completely all but one steak. I was very pleased with everyone having good things to say about dinner. This recipe will definitely be used again. thanks

This is such a good recipe for cubed steak.
I really liked the cracker and flour mixture. I didn't make the gravy since my husband just wanted steak sandwiches. I can't wait to fix this again, with the gravy, of course!

Great recipe!  Although make sure the oil is hot enough ...  I don't fry often and my oil was too cool so it soaked up alot of oil before truly cooking.. so it was a bit greasy.

My husband really loved this recipe and he lived in the south so he's a good critic.  
Even my kids liked it.  Great recipe.

This was fun to make.  I had never made chicken fried steak before nor had I eaten more than maybe once in my life.  My husband and I really enjoyed it even though we arn't fried steak lovers.  The gravy was to die for.  My son didn' try it so I can't give it a kid rating.

Wow, I made Chicken Fried Steak for the first time with this recipe and it was fabulous.

My husband and son both had seconds, which is very rare in my house.

Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.  We look forward to many more Yummy Chicken Fried Steak meals.

This is the best I have found, great with milk gravy and mashed taters.
