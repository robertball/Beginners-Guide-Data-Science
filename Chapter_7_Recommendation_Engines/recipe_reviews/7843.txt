This recipe works great - and tastes a lot better than I expected! I'm making an actual pink princess cake tomorrow for a coworker's daughter, so I took this recipe for a test drive today. Turned out moist, tasty, and pink (PLENTY pink enough). I was worried about having big, wet strawberry chunks in places, but the strawberries got mashed and distributed through the batter while mixing. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again tomorrow,  - and am reaping the rewards of my 'test' tonight with whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate syrup. Thanks!

This recipe was Okay...it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I think Strawberry box cakes taste exactly the same. I used applesauce instead of oil to make the fat content lower, maybe that affected the recipe. Although people seemed to like this cake, I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious.  I don't think I'll ever buy strawberry cake mix again!  With ice cream, coolwhip and the leftover juice from thawing out the strawberries, it's a strawberry shortcake alternative.

I followed the directions for this cake with only one exception - I used chopped fresh stawberries.   The texture is interesting. The mouth feel was almost that of pumpkin pie (or, a custard-y type pie). It was moist but seemed very dense. Not a bad thing, but not the best cake I've ever had. I may make this again with some slight modifications.

This is a very tasty cake. Good strawberry flavor, but could have been a bit moister. I used a 16 oz container of frozen strawberries, as I could not find any 10 oz containers. Next time I will leave the juice in rather than draining it. The recipe seems like it could use more liquid as it was a very thick batter. That being said, I will use this recipe again. Other than it being not as moist as I would have liked, It was a great tasting cake. Definitely worth making. Sprinkled the top with powered sugar and served with whipped cream and fresh strawberries on top. YUM!

This was good as a cake, but when I tried making mini-cakes, the outsides browned very quickly and the "crust to cake ratio" wasn't very tasty.  I say stick with an angel food pan or bundt cake.

Excellent recipe.  I had a dear co-worker (God rest her soul) who would always make this cake for me as a birthday present.  13 years later, I have found her recipe.    My first attempt I used an Angel food cake mix, and it was a disaster.  Exceptionally tall in size, and very dry.  Almost like chewing on an eraser.   My second attempt was pure success!  I subsituted canned strawberry pie filling for the fresh strawberries, and gelatin.  Most geltin mixes are ARTIFICALLY FLAVORED (yuck).  I also added sliced walnuts to the top of the batter after pouring it into the bundt cake pan and then pressed the walnuts into the batter.  The walnuts help "defeat" the overly sweet flavor of the strawberry pie filling.  Lastly, always use brown eggs.  They make the cake very flavorful.  The deep magenta/fuschia color of the inside of the cake is beautiful.  The outside is a deep brown (I suppose due to the carmelization of the strawberry filling.  I made a plain sugar glaze and drizzled it lightly over the top of the cake and voila!

worked great. have also tried with sugar free rasberry gelatin and liked the contrast in flavors.  I recommend greasing and flouring the pan especially if using a special bundt cake pan ie. rose shaped.

I like it. The birthday girl not so much, said it was too sweet but I think that's because we decorated the plates with chocolate syrup. So don't do that. I left out the 2 tablespoons of flour, I think that might have been why some reviewers said it was dry.  It was nice and moist without it. I also added a scant 1/4 cup of the strawberry juice and glazed it with a milk/powder sugar & pink food coloring glaze. I did wished I had saved the strawberry juice for the glaze, next time I will.

This was an ok tasting cake. My kids loved it though. I did use sugar free Jello so maybe that affected the taste. (Wasn't as strawberry flavored as I thought it would be.) I would try again with regular jello. Also we topped with whipped topping before we served. (That was my favorite part.)

I made this cake for my mom for Mother's Day. It turned out beautiful. The color was a nice bright pink. I followed the recipe as is except I added the juice from the strawberries. I think this helped punch up the color and avoided making the cake dry like some complained about. I served it with Cool Whip and blueberries.

This was super simple to make. So simple that my five year old son made it almost by himself. 

I used fresh strawberries as I had some that were about to go bad. Everything else I kept the same. I did bake it in a 9x13 baking dish, as to make it easy to frost. I plan on frosting it with Cool Whip frosting (1 container Cool Whip, 1 small box instant vanilla pudding, 1/2 c. milk).

Strawberry cake is my husband's favorite so I'm sure he'll love it. I'll update after dinner to say how he liked it.

EDITED TO ADD: Nope. He didn't like it. 
I ended up passing it out to neighbors.

The only change I made was that I put raspberry jello instead of strawberry. I also made a home made butter icing for it minus the strawberries and just threw sprinkles on top as it was a birthday cake. Had so many people compliment me that it was the best cake they ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

My cake turned out lovely. I always worry with cake mix recipes. I have found that cake mixes are actually only 15 oz. instead of 18, so I added a couple extra tablespoons of flour. I also used a packet of Junket Danish Dessert instead of "Jello" and fresh chopped strawberries instead of frozen. I baked it for about 40 minutes and let it cool for 15. It came out of the pan perfectly with just cooking spray. Pretty and pink! Moist and yummy!

I very much enjoyed this cake. Such an extreme strawberry taste, and so moist. I used rainbow chip frosting for my finishing touch!

This is a freaking yummy cake!  I had to use a gluten-free cake mix as I was making the cake for a friend and no one could tell it was gluten-free.  This cake tasted just like eating a strawberry!  And it was so dang easy.  I think I'm going to try experimenting with other flavors :)

I made this to take to my daughter in laws for a memorial day cookout.  It was EXTREMELY thick when I mixed it. I couldn't pour it into the pan. I had to scoop it. Maybe I should not have drained the strawberries. It seemed to need more liquids. It ended up being very dry(chokingly) and burned around the edges even after only 25 minutes. I would have given it a one star but it was a pretty pink color.

This cake has a particular texture and flavor to it; for some people it makes it absolutely delicious, but for others it is hardly edible.  I liked it well enough.  I served it at my daughter's birthday party and some people ate it up happily, but many didn't care for it.  Since it was so middle of the road, I doubt I would ever make this again.

Pretty good! I used the leftover strawberry juice to make a glaze and I sprinkled the top with coconut. I think I overcooked it a bit, but that's ok.  Very strawberry-ie. Yum!
