This is very good.  I made as written with a couple of minor exceptions.  I added a dash of vanilla to smooth out the flavor and used grated orange zest rather than strips.  I think next time I'll try a red wine with a little sweetness.

I really liked this. i used sweet pink Catawba instead of dry wine ( because i didn't have anything else).  Really delicious! You could even put it on toast! Recipe made almost exactly on pint sized canning jar.

Delicious!  Everyone enjoyed it, even those who say they just like "regular" cranberry sauce.  I have also made it with half orange juice and half red wine.

The whole family loved it.  Even my kids, who never liked cranberry relish before, thought it was amazing.

Have made something very similar for years as the cranberry sauce for our Thanksgiving table.  I like the addition of the cinnamon stick.  Yummy!

I make this recipe every year and it's always a big hit. I add more orange zest than is called for with a little hint of vanilla as well. Trim with mint sprigs in a clear glass dish for gorgeous color on your holiday table.

The only change I made was using brown and white sugar equally.  Compliments received from family members who thought they only wanted canned cranberry sauce.  I've made this for Thanksgiving the past 3 years.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This relish is the best!  I am honestly addicted, and make it numerous times throughout the year just so I can use it as a topping on ice cream, cheesecake; you name it, it's delicious! I didn't change a single thing.

I will definitely be making this again!  So easy to make!  I took it to Thanksgiving dinner and some that don't ordinarily like cranberries, raved!  Not too sweet and not too tart!

Delicious. I used fine orange zest rather than strips. I enjoyed it with my pork chop yesterday and look forward to sharing it at Christmas dinner tomorrow.  Will probably try to reduce the sugar a little bit next time I make it.

Delish!  We used a little less sugar (1 and 1/8 cup).

I made this using Sangria. So so good. I'm never buying cranberry sauce at the store again.

Just added a half a capful of vanilla, and cooked it about 5-10 minutes longer. Husband said it was good enough to put over ice cream (not quite THAT sweet, but pretty darned close). Cannot wait to have it with some turkey on Thanksgiving!!
