Hey, it's me, the submitter...

I have noticed that a couple of people are saying that the filling is too watery, that could be due to the wrong type of flour...  Rice flour absorbs a lot more water than the same amount of AP flour, if you are going to use AP flour, use more flour than the recipe calls for...

I am a vegetarian and live off of stir fried veggies. I believe the best way to make this work is to pre-fry all the veggies so their best flavor comes through. This was a huge hit at my potluck and I'm making it for Christmas this year! Gruyere cheese, sherry, broth and cornstarch are my additions to make it lovely and so, so flavorful. To die for!

-Fry the onions in the olive oil until they start to carmelize. 
-Add the carrots and celery and cook for about 5 minutes.
-Add all the mushrooms and stir-fry together with the other veggies until they are all browned, tender, and fragrant. If the carrots and celery are still a little too firm, they'll soften as the pie bakes.
-Add 1/2 C Sherry and the tamari. Whisk in about 1 T cornstarch (as you would the rice flour) and simmer until the mixture starts the thicken and bubble.
-At this point, add the potatoes and whisk in as much veggie stock as you need to reach a desirable consistency.
-Grate in about a 1/4 C Gruyere cheese!

The filling is done. Prepare the pie as you would according to the recipe. Grate a little gruyere cheese over the top before popping it into the oven and you will be in heaven!

This recipe was perfect veg. recipe. My boyfriend and I are not vegetarian though his mother and sister are and this was wonderful. Everyone raved about it. Though by following the recipe I made enough for 3 pies. So I ended up baking it in a casserole dish. I paired it with grilled asparagus tossed in olive oil, and lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Delecious!

This is a great recipe. I have made it a few times...

I usually double the recipe and put half in a 9x9" dish then top with a sheet of puff pastry. I freeze the other half to use with the rest of the puff pastry at another time!

I also add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to the gravy mixture.

If you're thinking of making this pie, you've come to the right place by reading reviews! I've made portobello and chicken versions of this pie now, and I relied heavily on some of the consistent reviews I read here. For example, I used all-purpose flour for the gravy and almost doubled the measurement, and used vegetable stock and wine in place of the water. I also made my own crust. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe makes about twice the amount of filling you need for a 9-inch pie. This recipe is a great start though, with a few modifications.

Delicious! I used criminis instead of shiitakes, but I think next time I might use a wild mushroom mix for fun. I'll also salt the gravy. I caramelized the onions, and next time I'll add more. I also used fresh herbs. Nice and hearty, and fairly easy!

This can be a good vegan Thanksgiving main dish with some modifications. Most importantly, make sure the filling is liquid enough (about the consistency of gravy), as it doesn't taste good when it's too thick and some of the water will evaporate in the baking. However, if you're using all-purpose flour instead of rice flour, you can use 1 1/2 times as much. Also, it's a good idea to taste the filling while it's cooking and add extra soy sauce (up to 1 1/2 times as much total) if you find it's too bland. The carrots and celery should be added to the pot with the onions and mushrooms, so that they end up soft instead of crunchy. Finally, make sure the pie crusts you use are unsweetened (0g sugars in the Nutrition Facts) so they fit with the filling.

Delicious!  The only downside was my frozen pie crust, which tasted like a frozen pie crust.  Everything else was wonderful.  I used allpurpose flour so I cut down on the water - used about 2 cups, and then added flour until I got a gravy consistency.  I was too cheap for the shiitakes, and instead used the portabello stems, which worked great.

Took the leftovers into work and they disappeared in minutes!  Thanks for a keeper.

My husband and I really liked pot pie, although I overspiced (my fault) because before cooking the filling seemed bland.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

I was having a vegetarian guest for Thanksgiving, so I decided to make this is a veggie entree. I didn't actually try any of it myself since I loathe mushrooms, but my vegetarian guest and the others who tried it absolutely LOVED it. It was relatively easy to make, and it was great to know that I had a solid main course for the vegetarians. I'm definitely going to hold on to this recipe! I stuck to the recipe and made no substitutions.

My daughter (veget) really liked this & surprisingly, my hubby (meat/potato man) also liked it.  Didn't change much from the original.  Used 6 medium potatoes instead of small & added extra soy sauce.  Am planning on adding sliced water chestnuts next time, for a little more texture.  Definately planning on having it again!!

Great Veggie recipe! I used 2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead of sage and thyme (didn't have any) and added some zucchini to the mix. It was a wonderfully flavorful meal. Thanks for sharing. I will make again and probably experiment with more veggies.

This Asian twist on a classic is brilliant! I made this for my husband and his mother. We all LOVED it! I didn't find shiitakes in my store, so I used baby bellas. I used AP flour and used 9 T (thank you other raters/reviewers). We like things a bit spicy, so I added a few squirts of Sirachi to give it a bit of heat. Yummy!

Kids loved it! Leftovers were even better than first day. Used dried shitake mushrooms instead of fresh; saved mushroom water from cooking them for the liquid. Yummy!

Delicious. There was too much filling, but it didn't matter because I had devoured the extra filling before the pie was even ready. As always, I use my trusty pie crust recipe from this site (pie crust IV). This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I adapted the recipe like one of the reviewers suggested adding Gruyere cheese and sherry and cornstarch instead of rice flour.  I added too many potatoes though so the next time will cut back on them a little.  My husband just loved this.  He doesn't like left overs but said each day the flavor got better!  We are not vegetarians so it can be used as a side dish also since it has veggies and starch.

Delicious! Total prep plus cook time was accurate, even including making the crust from scratch!  My only mods were 7.5 Tbs of AP flour instead of rice flour, only 5 potatoes, add in the other veggies to the frying bellos, and to use one portobello cap and a bunch of baby bellos instead of two caps.
(Personal notes: bought a tri-pack of mushrooms (baby bellos, shiitake, and oyster), used babies and one cap (of a pack of three), used savory crust recipe in recipe box, used 7.5" by 9.5" Pyrex dish, whisk flour in a separate bowl before adding to gravy so you don't have clumps!)
2014.12.11: Used two packs of baby bellos (taking one thinly sliced cup from these), and somehow I only had four potatoes available.  But it was still delicious!  I have probably made this recipe at least six times, and it is always great.
2016.09.11: BOIL POTATOES FIRST.  Just baby bellos again for mushrooms.  No celery and just one carrot, so added 1 lb of frozen peas.  Good, but maybe just do 1/2lb next time with celery?  Still very good.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly.  I had no problem with it being to runny or not fitting in the (homemade) pie crust/plate, I just didn't care for the taste.

LOVE THIS! Will make many more times! Replaced the water with chicken broth (2c) and some red wine (1.5c) - sounds gross, but came out well (wine turned filling a dark purple though - which was fine with me!). Also used all purpose flour instead of rice flour and had to add more to make it not-watery - just added flour until the consistency was right. Added some extra veggies and it made enough for two pies, which we were happy to eat because we like it so much!

I made some adjustments, most notably using a whole wheat pie crust - I also used a 10 oz. package of baby bellas, quartered, and I threw in a rehydrated packet of dried gourmet mushrooms (porcini, black, more shitake and oyster), using some of the liquid in place of the water. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and for herbs, 1 tsp each sage, thyme and savory, and I used plain all-purpose flour for the rice flour.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but I don't think my changes were totally drastic.  The filling is PHENOMENAL!  Since I hate pie crusts and they seem to hate me, I will probably use storebought crusts in the future, but I can totally see myself making this filling - maybe minus the potatoes - to serve over noodles.  I did have a little extra filling - maybe a cup - but no worries...it was delicious! :) Thanks, John, for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Absolutely delicious! . I agree with a previous reviewer that the carrots, and celery should be sautéed briefly before being added to the gravy mixture, to bring out their flavor.  . I used about seven Tbsp. of all purpose flour instead of buying rice flour, and that worked perfectly. . Don't skimp on the crust by using refrigerator crust - make a great homemade crust to really complement this hearty, delicious dish!

Only change I made was that I used 7tbsp AP flour as I didn't have rice flour. Turned out beautiful and delicious! Even my carnivore husband was asking for seconds and thirds! It did make about 1-1/2 cups more filling than would fit in the pie crusts, but so good that it was eaten alone. This will be one of my regular dishes.

This was a hit for my vegetarian guest for Thanksgiving. He thanked me for making, and then I knew it was a winner when he went for seconds. I am pretty sure everyone else would have also liked if we weren't so full on everything else.  If I were to do again, I would add more carrots and substitute a few regular potato for sweet potatoes.

The filling was very good with some minor tweaks but like some of the others reported, it came out runny. I added veggie Worcester sauce and a sprinkle of red pepper. I also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and since I didn't have any sage I used a similar amount of herbes de provence. I used homemade veggie broth and a tablespoon more of rice flour. The gravy was a good consistency in the pan and I hoped it would thicken up more when baking but it didn't. So it looked very nice until cutting it when it fell apart. But it would make a very good stew by adding some peas or other veggies.

My mum and I found this a bit bland, especially the sauce. It needed something hefty to thicken and flavor it, maybe some added flour and spices?

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I did make this the way that CHOOCHOOMCYUMMY said to make it, without the cheese seeing as I am a vegan and whoa! Flavor explosion! It is definately one of my favorites by far! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and for CHOOCHOOMCYUMMY's additions! If you make this recipe, you truly will not be disappointed!!!

His makes a huge pot pie. It ts edible, but there are a lot better ways to eat mushrooms, potatoes, and carrots. I won't be making it again.

Hubby rates it a 3, while I give it a 4. It tasted great! I was entirely satisfied with this as my meal. My husband, on the other hand, was raiding the fridge after only a couple of hours. Possibly all mental so next time I'm not telling him if something is meatless.

I made this recipe for a Vegetarian friend- she loved it!  Made it with a whole wheat pie crust and it was great!  It had a little too much onion for my taste, but my friend didn't think there was too much at all.

OMG!  My new favorite vegetarian comfort food!  

I did end up using a tad more rice flour and soy sauce, but would have been great exactly as written!  

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I had way too much filling for a regular pie pan.  I ended up eating the left-over filling like a stew.  That was great, and we could hardly wait for the final product.  It was sooooo worth the wait!!!!!

As good as the creamy versions without all the fat and meat!!!  

love, love, love!!

Great recipe, I didn't follow the recipe exact, and just threw the veggies in a wok with oil, cooked a few minutes, added some water, definitely not as much as the recipe calls for, added the soy, as well as some veggie paste for extra flavor, and toward the end I thickened it with a few tablespoons of AP flour, you know by the thickness when it is done, it should be pretty thick, and not runny... I added the potatoes to the mix last right before I filled the pie. Include corn in the recipe, it gives the pie an extra element, good stuff, if I had peas I would have added them too. I will definitely do this recipe again.

Followed the recipe as written and indeed there was a lot of extra filling.  But that was okay because I just put that in a casserole dish for leftovers.  The vegetarians at my Thanksgiving dinner really enjoyed this.  Would be better with homemade crust if you think you can handle that!

Sorry, but although this turned out right texture-wise, my family and I all thought it was missing some taste. Perhaps more salt and spices would have given this more flavor. This was the first pot pie that I've tasted before, but it just seemed bland.

Awesome recipe!  Excellent flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe exactly (except maybe adding a little more shitake mushrooms than called for) and it ended up to be WAY too much for 1 little 9" pie shell.  So, I made pot pie pastries to fit a 13x9 and it was just the right amount of filling for this size.  I'm glad there was so much because 1/2 is in my freezer for a later date.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe - My husband isn't big on mushrooms, but he likes this one.  Next time, I'll make sure I use a 9" deep dish pie pan (or a 10" pan) and decrease the amount of water a bit.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a deep baking dish with a homemade gluten free crust. It was delicious!!  I sautéed all the vegetables together then used 3/4 veggie Better Than Bullion Broth and 1/4 water. The brown rice flour thickened it right up. I read some tips on pastry crusts and one said to cook the pie on the bottom rack to keep the bottom crust from getting soggy. It worked!  I sautéed the Portobello cubes in batches and wired about too much olive oil but it worked out well. 
Thank you for this yummy recipe!

I served it over rice instead, I feel like it would've been much too thick and heavy in the crust. however, there was way way WAY too much thyme in the original recipe. when I tasted the filling that's all that i could taste and there was no way to get rid of that so definitely be careful with that. overall it was pretty good, just too much thyme

I thought this was missing something. It just tasted bland to me. I was expecting a stronger mushroom taste or something. I also didn't care for the consistency of it. It isn't that it tasted bad...it just was to bland for me. I certainly am going to eat the rest of it but I doubt I will make it again.

I thought it was really great, very mushroom-y :)  I made individual pot pies instead of large ones and everyone was pleased.  Next time I'm going to try adding some meat (males in this family don't go much for veggie meals)  Great recipe!
