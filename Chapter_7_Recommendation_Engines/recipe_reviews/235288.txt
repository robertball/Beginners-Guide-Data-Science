I don'the generally rate recipes because I change to many things to give an accurate review. This time I'm reviewing for just that reason. Previous reviewers complained that the berries were to tart, I put the berries, liquor and sugar in a saucepan and let them cook on low about 15 minutes. The sugar had dissolved into the liquor and berry juices, the berries were still firm but now infused with the sugar. Poured the liquid from the pan into the egg mixture and proceeded with the recipe as written. It turned out great!! Next time I make this I will add some orange zest in with the berry's and maybe a little granola as a crunchy garnish.

I had high hopes for this beautiful looking dessert.  wanted to do a test run before Thanksgiving. The custuard is yummy (I even used 1/2 & 1/2, but will use heavy cream when I make it again). The cranberries need to be sweetened a little bit more, I think.  something was missing to make it a "wow" dessert.  this was in the latest Allrecipes magazine,  so I hope others post...it certainly has potential!

Made this elegant dessert for our New Years Eve dinner.  I used washed raw sugar, because that is what we had on hand. I was pretty generous with butter and sugar in the pan before adding the cranberries. There is a brown butter/caramel characteristic to the flavor. Not sure if that is due to the type of sugar or the preparation of the pan. Either way - yummy and easy dessert.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  The custard turned out ok but the cranberries were too tart.  I doubt if I'll make it again.

Cranberries are far too tart for this type of dessert.  If I make this again, I'll use a sweeter berry; blueberries, perhaps, or possibly raspberries.  I think a smaller baking dish would help, too.  The custard layer is rather scanty when made is such a large pan.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It disappeared rapidly.  Will make it again.  Delicious.  Loved the sweet-tart combination.
