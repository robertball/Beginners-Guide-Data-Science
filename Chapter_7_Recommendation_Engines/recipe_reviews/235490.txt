OMG this was amazing! It was yummy and my kids LOVED it. I have one that hates onions and one that hates beans but they gobbled it all up. Just added a pinch of salt then topped it with shredded cheese and dried basil flakes and had grilled cheese on the side!

This was pretty bland. Used 1 can diced tomatoes w garlic and basil, 1 can crushed tomatoes. Neither were brand named specified. After warming, I blended all ingredients until smooth. I added more salt, basil, parsley and oregano and melted parm cheese.  Still kind of bland.
