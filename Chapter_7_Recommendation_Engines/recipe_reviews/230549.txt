I bought a bag of Meyer lemons with this recipe in mind! I am a Grand Marnier lover, so I used that for the orange-flavored liqueur. This little citrus gem has the perfect balance of sweet to tart. This will definitely be treat throughout the week at cocktail hour! Thanks, cookin'mama!

I have been searching for a good lemon martini recipe and this is it.  So easy to make and is not too tart. Can't wait to try it with grand marnier as Cointreau is all I had.

Oh My Golly.  Recently living on the beautiful East Coast of Florida and having Meyer Lemon Trees very available, I have been squeezing and freezing Meyer Lemon juice ice cubes.   A perfect drink is 2 cubes of juice with 2 teas sugar and 2 teas water. Micro for just a few seconds. Add to ice filled cocktail shaker along with the Vodka and Orange Liquor and shake. Swirl your Martini glass in sugar, pour the martini liquid into glass and garnish with lemon rind. Just plain YUM!!

I made a simple syrup ahead of time (boiled 1 cup sugar with 1 cup water) and at mixing time did 2 oz each Meyer lemon juice (I had squeezed all ahead of time) and vodka and 1 oz each simple syrup and Cointreau.  Rave reviews all around!

Yummy! I'm not much of a martini-lover, but do love Meyer lemon, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's very strong, but has an excellent flavor. Had to run to the computer and type this review before I finished the first glass, because I knew I wouldn't be able to after finishing the drink! Good and strong!

This martini is so good. We have made this drink a few times. You have to use Meyer lemons for it to turn out right. Followed the recipe but made some simple sugar with organic sugar and water ahead of time. Also have made it with Grand Marnier when we were out of Cointreau.

Made it with a Truvia simple syrup, which I substituted for the water and sugar.  Really outstanding drink.
