Hubby loved these - so why 4 stars not 5.  I don't like the frying step and it isn't needed.  I did  a couple of things differently.  I microwaved the potatoes - let cool and scooped out the insides - then sprayed the skins with cooking spray and into a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes to get crispy.  The meat & chili seasoning needs to have some water added and then cooked together.  I used Kraft slices, as that is what I had on hand. (Cheddar or Jack would work well too.)   I put a slice on the inside of each skin and then mixed some with the chili meat and then some on top. Mashed the taters with butter and milk, sprinkled with paprika.

These are the best potato skins I've ever had, we ate them for a main dish.

I personally love potato skins so to watch other people making them and learning how they are made was exciting.Actually potato skins are on of my favorite foods because I love fresh potatoes, cheese, bacon and sour cream.The only thing I would say is that when people are making them make sure they are big enough so they fill you up more as a meal than a snack. Also, I think if your someone who's trying to have a small party, game night, etc.... you should really consider making this appetizer because it is a good appetizer to serve while their waiting on the big meal to be done, but if your trying to cook potato skins as a meal for dinner or something the only thing to me that would go good with it would be a steak. Lastly, potato skins are very easy to make so I recommend it to everyone.

This was just okay until I started adding my own twist.  This meat was suppose to be "chili" but not much chili flavor.  I added one large garlic clove, a heaping tablespoon of Oscar Meyer Hickory smoked Real bacon bits, one heaping tablespoon of ketchup; cayenne pepper, black pepper and oregano to taste.  Since it needed to simmer for a few minutes to absorb the flavor, I added chicken stock.  I did not fry the potato skins, I baked them for a few minutes.  I also added fresh chopped scallions to the top once it was done baking.  Much better.  Now it's five stars!!!

This was fantastic!!! I follwed a fellow reviewer and added shredded cheese to tops before baking and also baked with cooking sprayed skins instead of frying. Turned out sooo good! There was only three of us and we ate all of them! no leftovers! In my house you know thats a keeper!!!
