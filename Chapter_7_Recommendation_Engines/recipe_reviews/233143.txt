This recipe is A LOT of work for minimal payoff. It's also too heavy on the sugar. I doubt I'd both with this again as there are plenty of tasty recipes for white, flaky fish that aren't this much effort for such lackluster results.

Best tasting fish ever! We can't get enough. Even if you don't have the time to do the 8 hour marinade its still great!
