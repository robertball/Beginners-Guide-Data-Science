Great idea but needs some adjusting. We found that the blueberry flavor didn't come thru quite enough as is. Maybe next time we will up the amount of blueberries from what I already used which was 2 cups (1 cup blended and 1 cup whole). I also added about 1/4 cup powdered sugar just before churning to up the sugar content. Maybe upping the honey to a 1/4 cup and not using the powdered sugar would be just right.

I love the idea of this ice cream but not so much the execution. It is not sweet enough as written and there is something off about the texture- not quite the creaminess I would expect from ice cream. Needs some tweaking.
