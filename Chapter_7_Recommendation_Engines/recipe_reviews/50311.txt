Fantastic flavor!  I used this recipes for bacon and Canadian bacon using a pork eye of round. This is so much better than what you find in the stores without the chemical taste than many bacons now have.  I use a half-and-half mixture of hickory and maple chips.  I plan on trying this in making my own brown-sugar ham this fall.

So good.  We made 16 pounds of bacon.  We peppered the edges of half of it, delicious. So easy to make.

Great Canadian bacon!  Moist and low fat.  Requires oil [I use olive oil] to fry.  Makes a great BLT or cold sandwich.  Kept for over 2 months in the refrigerator. I will definitely make it again.

I have been making Canadian bacon for a few years and you donâ€™t smoke it you cure it and roll in corn meal and slice and eat
