This was a tasty and healthy breakfast drink! I froze my banana so to make the drink colder. Otherwise, I followed it exactly as written. The almond milk I used was unsweetened, which was perfect for me, but others may wish to add sweetener if their milk is unsweetened. A simple "treat" that I'll be making again!

I used coconut milk and added 2 scoops protein powder. It was great. I'll be doing this again frequently
