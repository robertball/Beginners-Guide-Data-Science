This crust was great! Great flavor even though it doesn't have any butter in it.(I'm a true butter lover) And it has a great texture, tender and flaky. The key is to not over work it. When I added the liquids and stirred with a fork to get everything somewhat mixed, I then dumped the dough onto a piece of cling wrap where I used it to lightly squeeze it together until it formed a nice ball. If you knead this dough too much it flatten all the shortening pieces. Therefore you won't have anymore flaky, just tough. The cling wrap trick also helps in not adding extra flour as you do when you knead, and that can also make a tough dough.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT REVIEWING A RECIPE (AND BELIEVE ME I HAVE USED QUITE A FEW GOOD ONES), BUT THIS ONE WAS WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT.  YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT USUALLY I WOULD NOT BOTHER TO REVIEW A PRODUCT IF I HAVE TO BECOME A MEMBER, BUT AGAIN I PUT THAT ASIDE BECAUSE I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO REVIEW THIS CRUST.  I HAVE NEVER BAKED A PIE CRUST BEFORE AND FRANKLY I WAS SCARED TO DEATH TO TRY, BUT I READ THIS ONE AND DECIDED TO TRY IT; THAT WAS THE BEST CHOICE I COULD HAVE MADE.  THIS CRUST WAS LIGHT AND VERY FLAVORFUL.  I MUST ADMIT I DID USE CHILLED BUTTER INSTEAD OF SHORTENING.  REGARDLESS, THIS CRUST IS SUPERB AND EVERYONE WHO HAS TRIED THIS CRUST RAVES ABOUT IT.  THANK YOU TO WHOMEVER SUBMITTED THIS RECIPE BECAUSE IT IS A KEEPER THAT I PLAN ON PASSING DOWN TO MY LUCKY CHILDREN.

excellent!  Used my food processor.  Added flour, sugar, salt and butter and pulsed until bread crumb consistancy.  Added liquid down the funnel.  Took less than 2 minutes!  Baked it as an apple pie.  Beautiful flaky pastry with next to no effort.  A have to try recipe.

I use this pie crust for every sweet pie that I make. I love it because it compliments the filling perfectly! For easy cleanup and rolling, I place the dough in a huge gallon ziplock bag, place it in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes, and cut the ziplock bag on two sides. So, the pie crust dough is in between the two layers of plastic and its wayy easier to roll out.

Outstanding recipe. It's amazing what the addition of an egg and a little vinegar do to an ordinary pie crust. Easily the best dessert pie crust I've ever made or eaten. This is the ultimate crust for "Grandma Ople's Apple Pie" (available on AllRecipes).  Also, through a successful experiment, I discovered that if one follows this recipe, but reduces the sugar to only one tablespoon (instead of three), the result is an incomparable crust for chicken pot pie. Print this recipe and DO NOT LOSE IT!!

I discovered this recipe a few months ago while looking for a blueberry pie recipe. The reviews suggested using this crust. I am so thankful!

Having never made pie crust before I had a backup plan; a store bought crust to use when I screwed this up. 

To my delight, the store bought remains in my freezer. 

This is the most delicious pie crust. I have made probably 30 pies in the past 2 months and every one has been consistent. 

I always use 5 tablespoons of ice water and just mix till everything is combined. I try not to overwork. Sometimes the dough appears crumbly in the bowl, but I just push it together, roll it and the results are a perfect, flaky crust every time. Everyone comments on how delicious the crust is!  

Thank you TJ, I will never forget you!

my late cousin used to make a similar crust with the vinegar and egg.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I used the butter flavor crisco, as it gives crusts a beautiful golden color as well as add flavor.  This baked up so beautifully; was used for a lemon meringue pie.  I prodded the bottom with fork and for the first time ever I've not had a crust shrink away from the sides!....just wonderful and this is what I will use from now on.  I used other reviewers' suggestions of: #1.  toss the wet and dry with 2 forks, as it limits the handling of the dough (works wonders!)  #2.  put dough in a ziplock bag, sealed it, and rolled it out with rolling pin and put in fridge.  I just cut the one side of the ziplock bag and placed in a pan...that's another great tip!  thanks for the best recipe and thanks to the others for great tips!

This pie crust was quick and not too difficult to make! i thought that it'd be a lot harder, since i've tried and failed with other recipes at making pie crusts from scratch.

I substituted 50ml of the shortening for 50ml of butter for colour and flavour. Also, I brushed an egg wash over top of the crust before I popped it into the oven.

The suggestion to wrap foil over the edge of the crust is a good suggestion, but unecessary. I followed the suggestion and wrapped foil over the edge of the pie crust I made, but when I put it into the oven, half of the foil fell off. I am a very lazy person so I decided not to fix the foil. When the pie was done baking, I found that the side of the pie where the foil remained wrapped.. was very pale and not very nice in colour; however, the side where the foil fell off was beautifully goldened! It's up to you~ but the next time I make this crust, I'm not going to wrap the foil around the edge of the crust.

OOH! Almost forgot! Do not be alarmed if the dough doesn't "form a ball". When I did it, I used all 5 tablespoons of water, but it still didn't come together to "form a ball". After you refrigerate it, it will be "easy as pie" (pardon the pun) to roll out.

OH! and I rolled out the dough between 2 pieces of wax paper too.

After reading reviews, I used half butter and half shortening. The crust tends to brown quickly, so I suggest covering edges with foil. I found it a bit too salty, so I cut the salt in half also. Thanks for sharing!

This is my new pie crust recipe. I've been looking for "the" pie crust for some time and just haven't been quite happy. My husband even asked if this was a new recipe and said it was awesome; you've got your pie crust recipe now. Only thing I did different was cut off about 2 T. of shortening and replaced it with butter. Just a little butter to add a little hint of flavor, but not much. The crust was easy to mix (use my KitchenAid processor) and rolled out great. I just can't say it enough...this crust is the bomb!

Nice, rich, flaky pie crust and a great choice for fruit pies, just as I expected it would be when I saw the addition of sugar, egg and vinegar. The sugar, of course, contributes sweetness, the egg makes this a richer, somewhat more tender pastry, and the vinegar is an age-old secret for flakiness. As others have mentioned, because of the fair amount of sugar in this pastry, great care must me taken to prevent overbrowning! Watch baking time closely, cover loosely with foil mid-way through, or lower oven temperature if necessary!  Makes more than enough for a 9" double crust, with plenty of leftovers for "Pie Crust Treats," also from this site! Lovely recipe!

First time I used this recipe I didn't change anything and it was great. The second time, being a butter freak I used butter instead of shortening and it was even better. I found this hint about using butter in pastry recipes, and it works like a charm. Use frozen butter and grate. I do this for my biscuit recipe also. Incredibly flaky results.

Welll..
A few tips for beginners.
I wouldn't say this is the best pie crust recipe I've ever used, but it worked well enough and got the job done.
First of all, this looks like a giant crumbly mess in the bowl. Which is intimidating. Get it together, dump it out onto some Cling wrap, and roll into a ball like that. 
Keep it in the fridge for about 15 minutes. The cold helped mine with the moisture problem.
Roll it out the best that you can. I found mine to work much better just putting the dough into the pan and spreading it out that way.
It comes out beautifully, although in my case, it took some work.

You can also do step 1 days ahead and put the dry crumble mixture in a freezer safe zip-lock bag in the freezer.  You can double/triple the recipe if you plan to make several pies.  When you are ready to make/bake your pies, take the mixture (~ 1.5 - 2 cups per pie shell) out of the freezer.  Mix in the egg/vinegar/water (remember the recipe makes 2 pie crusts so adjust according to the amount you are making) and you are ready to go.  The advice to not over mix it is important.  I pour the (still crumbly) mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap and put another piece of plastic wrap on top to make rolling out easier.  (Remember to ROLL out the dough, not push it out.)  These are all tips given to me when I was learning so I thought I'd pass them on :-)

I'm 68 and have NEVER been able to make a pie crust - every recipe fell apart.  A young 34 year old friend from church made a pie and this was the recipe.  She gave the recipe to me and I followed it exactly.  PERFECT EVERY TIME!  I follow it exactly.  I use my pastry blade to make sure I break up the Crisco very well and it's in tiny pieces, then when the liquids are added, just lightly mix it and form the ball.  Don't overwork this - just when it's formed together, it's ready.  So, learning to make a pie crust from scratch is off my bucket list.  Need more on that list.  I made a fresh apple pie with this recipe when my sister's came to visit = it was warm and they were thrilled.  Loved it!

I follow this recipe exactly but with the following modifications: 1/2 cup of Frozen salted butter shaved into the flour, and 1/2 cup of chilled non-homogenized lard. cut it in with a pastry cutter and follow the original recipe from there. Also, sift your flour! Very good. my favorite crust

This crust got the kid stamp of approval. There was nothing left on a plate and no comments of the crust was too dry! This crust tastes like a shortbread cookie and added so much to my apple pie. I made it according to the recipe.

This is a splendid pie crust. I also use the best ever pie crust from this site. So for now on with sweet pies I will use the French crust, and for savory pies I will use the best ever pie crust.I did change this some what by adding an extra tablespoon of sugar and I also added vanilla to the crust yummmmmmy.

This recipe was ridiculously easy and surprisingly delicious. I opted for the butter flavored Crisco because I love the butter taste but didn't want to run the risk of messing with the pie's consistency by using actual butter. Also, some wonderful angel mentioned a cling wrap tip (put the dough between two pieces of cling wrap before rolling it out) and that was the best piece of advice I've ever gotten from this site. I didn't have to worry about dough sticking to the rolling pin, I didn't have to worry about the edges breaking apart (they all just smush together in the cling wrap!) and I didn't have to worry about it sticking to the counter. Also, it was much easier to transport the crust when I was ready to move it. I put the two pieces of cling wrap perpendicular to each other so that I could fold the ends over (since the crust was wider than my cling wrap), if that helps. Seriously great recipe that is seriously easy for an amateur like me to do!

I needed a double crust pastry recipe, this one worked beautifully. It was perfect for a nice apple pie with a lattice top crust. I make these changes though: I use butter instead of shortening. (Who the heck uses shorterning anymore? Yuck!) Leave out the vinegar, I don't see what it is for. I used my hands to mix the dough and it was perfect, just enough liquids to dry ratio. For rolling it out, as the dough is nice and crumbly, roll it out between two sheets of parchment paper, dusted lightly with flour. That way the dough won't stick to the rolling pin and the surface.

I made my first apple pie with this recipe a few days ago ('Perfect Apple Pie' recipe from this site) and it was PERFECT! 
Only thing I did that the recipe did not suggest is I ended up having to keep it (plastic wrapped) in the fridge for about 4-5 hours before rolling/baking.

Do not worry too much about overworking the dough in this recipe as although with the intial mixing I worked it as little as possible, I ended up rolling out the bottom part of the crust 3x (for reasons below it fell apart the first two times) and it still turned out flawlessly!

 I do suggest that anyone that makes this recipe in a hot kitchen: (whether it's because you're cooking other things or because you're cursed like me and your air conditioner doesn't work, or both) to try to roll out the dough as soon as possible when out of fridge (maybe putting it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes would help a bit) as the reason my bottom crust kept falling apart on me when I tried to place it was because it was too warm.

Despite my placing issues, this crust was FABULOUS and helped me make the most perfect first Apple Pie. Normally when I bought (past tense because I wont be doing THAT again) apple pies at the store pre-made, I never wanted to eat the outer extra crust but not w/ this recipe!, there wasn't a crumb left!

Try this recipe just as is and you wont regret it.

This is the perfect pie crust for any cream or fruit pie. Rich, but not overly, flaky, flavorful, lightly sweet and it browns up beautifully. It really has every quality needed to take any recipe one step beyond ordinary.

I made this over the weekend for an apple tart recipe. It was the easiest crust I ever made. I mixed the entire thing in my food processer, chilled it for about 20 minutes and it rolled out perfectly. Thank you for an excellent recipe.

Living in Australia, there is no Crisco or anything like that, so I used a block of butter instead. FANTASTIC!!! I do have some pics which I will post. I made a caramel (boiled condensed milk) and strawberry tart and the pastry was the bomb! I didn't want the pastry to be flaky, so I didn't worry too much and did it all in my food processor, dumped it in cling wrap and chilled it until I was ready. I did roll it out between non-stick paper and the finished product was excellent. My husband could hold onto it with one hand, it was so firm, solid, crunchy at the edges and biscuity underneath. I had to prebake it and I didn't use dried beans. It did puff up in the middle a bit, but I just punched  some holes in the puffs with a fork to let the air out. Thankyou for submitting. It's a keeper!

First time I tried and it came out perfect.  Tender and flaky. Make sure the water is ice cold and don't over work the dough or your crust will be too tough. Thank you for the recipe.

Very easy and very tasty...made an apple butterscotch pie with a crumb topping.  Glad this recipe makes 2 crusts.  Froze the 2nd one and am looking forward to making another pie soon!  Used butter instead of shortening...this will be my "go to" pie crust!

I don't know whether I did this wrong or what, but I was awful! (I followed the recipe
exactly and I'm good at baking, so I have no idea) It was hard and tasted like cardboard.
I feel bad posting a bad review, but because of it I had two pumpkin pies (made with real
pumpkin, no less) that I couldn't use. My family and I just ate the pumpkin out of the shell and
threw the pastry away. On top of this, it was so crumbly and dry that it made a huge mess 
every time somebody cut a piece. I can't tell you how many times I had to wipe the 
counter and sweep the floor! Save yourself the aggravation and make a basic crust with 
2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 stick cold butter and 1/2 cup ice water. You know the drill 
from there. Much better and much easier!

This recipe came from a friend when I was 13. She used it to win a blue ribbon at the fair.  She was also 13. 
I tried it and for 35 years I've been winning with my family. Easy to make and always turns out great!!!

Very good - flaky and very light.  Not as fragrant as crusts using butter.  I have since used 50/50 butter and shortening and it's wonderful.  Buttery flavor as well as flaky from the shortening.

This is the best homemade crust I've made so far!  It tasted good, was flaky and looked beautiful (I brushed it with milk and sprinkled with raw sugar).  I used this for a mixed berry pie and it was perfect!  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!  Can't wait to make another pie!  The only thing I did different was use 1 tsp of salt instead of 1.5.

I made this crust today for my hubby's 40th, he wanted his favorite apple pie. This was easy and simple and it rolled out nice.  Great taste too and I'm not big on crusts. With the left overs I used small cookie cutters and made cookies rolled in cinnamon and sugar and baked a few minutes - 3 yr old loved them.

Wow - I've never had a crust turn out better. Note that it is not a very sweet crust and needs the sugar. I tend to try to cut back on sugar with most recipes - do that with this one only if you are using it for a savory dish. I made it in my food processor - soo easy, and did not knead it - just formed it into a ball to chill and quickly rolled it out. First time I've ever made a pie crust that wasn't too heavy or hard!

Beautiful crust!  I don't recommend using butter for this recipe as it becomes a nightmare to roll out.  Stick to the recipe, just add a little bit more salt or use butter flavored shortening as the crust is otherwise a little bland.  I used a food processor and pulsed the dry ingredients, added the butter and pulsed until a sand consistency, added the liquids through the top.  I like to brush my crust with an egg wash before baking to give it a nice shine.

Best pie crust EVER!!!  I'm never using another pie crust recipe again.  I used a combination of butter and shortening and let my food processor do the work.  I made sure all the ingredients were chilled before using (even the shortening).  I also put the pie crust in the fridge again after putting in the pie plate/before filling.

THE PERFECT Pie crust.....need I say anything else?

However, if you want a really FLAKY crust, forget the butter and shortening, and use Lard.  I have tried all 3, and Lard definitely makes a HUGE difference in the consistency and flakiness of the crust.

Lard is rendered pig fat.  yeah, it's a little on the unhealthy side, but if you're not eating a pie made with Lard everyday, there's not much harm.

If you don't like lard, try using half butter, half shortening together.  Like I said I've tried all 3, and combination's of them together, and Lard by itself is the best.

After a failed attempt at making a pie crust, i was rather hesitant to try another but i took the chance anyway n i was impressed! I used 2 forks to mix the dough to avoid overworking it and to prevent the fat from melting. The crust was extremely flaky and buttery. I used it with Grandma Ople's apple pie and it turned out beautifully!

This is the pie crust recipe I have been using for years (I was passed on to me by my grandmother), except I use milk instead of the water and I add a pinch of baking soda. I usually make a large recipe and freeze the (uncooked) leftovers in ziplock bags. Believe it or not, I think it's even better and flakier after it's been frozen!!!

Excellent.  I bake quite often, I have never had a go-to pie crust recipe, now I think that I do!
I rushed through this without proper chilling in a warm kitchen, I had to re roll the same crust 3 times because of my impatience, that usually spells doom for a pie crust, you are almost guaranteed a tough crust.  The vinegar in this crust took care of that problem and helped yield a tender crust in spite of my overworking.  This is now my go-to crust recipe.  I don't know why I have been so hesitant to use a recipe with vinegar in it, but I am now a convert!

I used this recipe, with one alteration, and it turned out great!  Instead of shortening, I used butter, like another reviewer suggested.  Incredibly easy!  Another great suggestion was using clingwrap to roll the dough out on rather than drying it out with more flour.  I used this crust all the time - even for a pot pie recipe - and it tastes great!

I am a novice cook, so if I can do it, anyone can!!

Used 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 butter. If you use 1 teaspoon vinegar PER cup of flour you should get a more tender, less hard (as some have stated)crust.  The acid  prevents the gluten from developing. Also, chill the crust again after rolling out for a better result.

Turned out way too dry, was an absolute terror to roll out, didn't look nice. But it tasted good :P
EDIT: Tasted the crust cooked now, WAY TOO SALTY, I need a drink of water just by eating a little bit. Broke really bad when cut too.

This was a wonderful pie crust, it is totally worth the extra work of a few more ingrediants than your average "flour and water" pie crust. I used it with Grandma Ople's Apple pie, also on this site and it was the best Apple Pie my husband and I have ever eaten! I even mixed the ingrediants the night before but kept the wet and dry separate in the fridge. The final product came out moist and flaky, I can't wait to make again.  Just make sure your wet ingrediants are cold so that the butter doesn't melt before the baking!

This is a good pie crust.  I used the food processor and pulsed the butter into the dry ingredients.  Didn't use shortening, so I reduced the salt to 1tsp.  Then slowly added the mixture of egg/vinegar/4T water & pulsed it a bit, then emptied it all into a bowl to finish pulling it together with my hands.  Wrapped the dough tightly in plastic and placed in freezer for 10-15 minutes.  While rolling it out, it appeared to want to crack around the edges easily, so I tossed a light sprinkling of flour in those areas, and it held together well.  I did need to cover the crust edges with foil to prevent from over-browning. Thanks, TJ, for sharing!

Have been a pie baker for years with my own good recipe but decided I would give this a try.  I thought it was very good and have used the recipe a second time and will probably use again.  However, the crust browns VERY QUICKLY and the edges need to be covered with foil so as not to be burnt.

This was my very first attempt at making a pie or pie crust. I chose this crust because of its ratings and I thought the picture looked very pretty. It turned out amazing my first try. I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 tsp water in the end. I read a lot of the reviews before I started. The other reviewers are right, this dough looks scary! But thanks to other reviewers I did not worry about it at all, I just went along with it. I also used 2 forks to mix the wet and dry (to limit the handling) and used butter flavored Crisco, per some of the other reviews. I made a full top crust and it looked beautiful when it was fully baked! Not to mention it was delicious, it was the *perfect* flavor and flakiness. My husband absolutely loved it and told me it was the best crust he had ever had, along with the pie. This is no light compliment because his mom is able to cook like a champ and makes all of her own stuff from scratch. She is an amazing cook, and he would not just throw out a compliment like that.  I paired this crust with “Apple Pie by Grandma Ople.” This will for sure be my “go to” crust for fruit pies from now on just because of how awesome it is. I have also never had a better crust on a fruit pie. A+++ rating and definitely will use this recipe again!

Simple and soft this pastry turned out well. We made it with the Perfect Pumpkin Pie and it was delicious. Didn't stick to the pie dish and was easy to cut. We froze the other half of dough for future use. Will use again.

The best pie crust ever. EVER.
The only problem I had was handling it. Eventually it turned out perfect, but be careful and don't get frustrated.

This recipe is amazing. I decided to find another recipe other than my mother's (don't shoot me mom) and this sounded so interesting. I used it for pumpkin pies this year. The dough is very easy to work with. I did not change a thing, following the directions to the letter. 
Prior to baking I brushed the crust with beaten egg whites (and if I were making a double crust pie, sprinkled the top with sugar for a crispy, shiny crust) The mini test pie I made got rave reviews from the "testers" aka the kids. I have been instructed to always use this recipe from now on. 
I can't thank you enough for your amazing recipe!!

If looking for a crust that will dominate the pie this is it. I rolled it 1/8" thick, but it seems to puff up or thicken in the oven. It is also quite sweet with 3 Tblsp. of sugar for a traditional pie crust. I used it with a really sugary sweet apple pie and the two did not go well together at all! I would save this pie crust for a tart or no bake pie with a cream filling. It is thick, dense, and almost cookie like.

This crust recipe changed my life!  Before I found this recipe, I was timid and unsure, a Sissy Girl (when it came to pies and especially the crust).  This recipe tastes great, it's flaky, very easy to handle, very forgiving of mistakes and even stores well in the fridge for several days.  Now, I am Amazon Woman of the Pie-Making Tribe!  I have used this recipe at least a dozen times since I found it 2 months ago.  I even left the sugar out and used it for a deep dish chicken pot pie.  The only minor problem I had was I had to use at least double the water to get the dough to hold together.  But, hey, when it did, it was perfect every time.

Before I found this recipe, the perfect pie crust eluded me.  I couldn't make one, an I don't like the way ready made ones taste.  Then I found this recipe, and my pie crusts turn out every time. Flaky and buttery with a touch of sweetness.  Even my mom wants this recipe!

THE best pie crust I have found by far! You don't have to do anything fancy with it. No chilling the shortening, water, bowl, etc and it will still come out perfect. I just used my food processor and it was so easy and come out delicious. Def my new go-to crust recipe!

I made this pastry yesterday, and WOW!  It's the best pastry ever!  I used butter instead of lard, and I did it all the food processor!  THe pastry was light, flaky and actually almost doubled in thickness it was so flaky!  This recipe is a "keeper" for sure!

This was my first time to make a crust and this will be the only recipe I use. It was so good and easy.  It was moist and flaky.  I followed the recipe exactly only substituting butter for shortning only because I didn't have it. My family thanks you because they know I will be making many more pies!

Wonderful flavor and super easy. The only change I made was using butter flavor crisco instead of shortening as the recipe calls for or butter as some other reviews used. It sort of gives you the best of both worlds and is a must in any baking I do. I loved this recipe and will use it again.

Perfect. I grew up on the crisco/flour/ice water crust- which is great, but this is better- more flavor, go this perfect crispness and then just melts in your mouth! Thank you.

This pie crust is excellent, so easy and quick to make and always works out perfectly. I use this recipe whenever I'm making a sweet pie. I do replace the shortening with just standard butter, it tastes great.

i rated this a five because i didnt stick to the directions and my pie didnt come out like i had expected everything was perfect except i used selfrising flour (don't) lol, also for the shortening i would suggest only use about 1/4 c. butter flavored shortening and 3/4 origional. and if u really want sweet pastry use about 4-5 tablespoons white sugar, but dispite my mistakes the pie baked beautifully it just didnt taste very good and thats my bad!

Substituted unsalted butter for half the called-for shortening.  Had real concerns, looking at the fat disks of dough resting in my fridge overnight: they looked really dry and crumbly, but they rolled out really well the next day.  Used for "Peach Pie the Old Fashioned Two Crust Way" from this site.  Crust was, by my estimation, near perfect -- lightly sweet (I did add the bit of lemon zest) and flaky.

EXCELLENT pie crust recipe. I cut the recipe in half to use in a single crust pie recipe. Mixing the dough I had a little doubt because it seemed too soft and wet, but after chilling and rolling it out on a floured surface it was still very moist but stayed intact and was very pliable which is impressive. It baked up incredibly flaky and light. I'll be using this recipe for all of my fruit pies. I might add a touch of vanilla and cinnamon to this next time I make an apple pie.

Awesome!!!!  I used it for avocado pie I found on this site.  I usually avoid eating the crust unless  it's covered in whipped cream or something, but this was wonderful!  It was like eating a cookie.

This is the best pie crust recipe I've ever made. The dough was gorgeously easy to roll out, and the taste-FABULOUS!!! I made a blueberry pie with a lattice top, and the crust was so flakey and light-delicious. I will use this recipe for life! Highly remcommended.

Well just to let you know I live in a high altitude area...so everytime I bake...it is sure to be an adventure.  I'm happy to say that other then having to add an extra tablespoon or so of water...everything went according to plan.  I think the key to this recipe is not kneading the dough at all.  Went the dough started to clump enough to squish into a ball, I did it then threw it in the fridge.  It also helped to roll the dough out between wax paper.  It was perfect for my boysenberry pie!  Thanks from the mountains!

Excellent, this was my first time making a pie crust and it was unbelievable, flaky, soft, and so yummy.  I slightly cut the salt added a tablespoon of sugar and did half butter half shortening.  The only thing I didn't get was what temperature to cook it at, it's not in the recipe, why is that?  Anyway I phoned my nana and she said 425

What a blast to make. I just put it in the food processor, chilled, and rolled it out between two sheets of cellophane. A superb pie crust indeed!

This is the only from scratch crust you'll ever need. It tastes great and is so easy to make. I made it and let it chill while making my pie filling. It's super for sweet potato and pecan pies! I found the perfect sweet potato pie and crust in 1 day, happy happy happy!

This crust was a breeze to make and tasted wonderful, with a great texture.  Unfortunately, I used it to make a disgusting apple pie (Grandma Ople's), so the effect was sorta ruined for me.

Great recipe for pie crust.  I usually double the sugar as I prefer my crust a little sweeter. I definitely prefer the flavor of this crust over a butter crust.

I made this following other's suggestions, one batch with shortening, one with butter...both came out flaky. I used one for two pies, and one batch for chicken pot pies (less sugar). Easy to make....and I kept one in the frig for several hours before baking, still came out great! Thanks

Beautiful! Perfect! I used 50/50 butter and shortening. It was my first crust. Not easy to work with but oh so worth the trouble! It ended up thicker than  it's "supposed to be" for a pie, due to my inexperience and it's uncooked texture, but it was so good and the extra crust looked wonderful. I'll make the same "mistake" the next time I use it.

This is my new crust recipe - period.  As mentioned by others, once you find this one you can stop looking!  I used the tip of reducing the sugar to 1 Tbsp. for savory pies and can't wait to make a fruit pie with the recipe as written.  The vinegar adds such a nice tang.  I followed the tip about pulsing ingredients in the food processor and just pouring the egg/vinegar/water mixture in.  Also, to keep from overworking the dough I used the tip about putting the dough into plastic wrap and molding into a ball.  Great tips and great results.  Thank you everyone!

This crust is sooooo delicious.   I have been making it for just over a year now and it turns out perfect every time.  I use to have a problem making crust, to the point that I gave up for many years and just bought store pie crust and un-rolled it.  Since I found this recipe it's been the only one I've used.  It works up in short time using my Kitchenaid processor. I have made it 'as written' and also subbed the shortening for lard...yes, lard, just like our grand & great grandmothers use to use.  I personally prefer the lard to shortening and I'll just leave it at that.  Just finished making some and after a short rest in the fridge I'll be making a Blueberry Crumb Pie from this site.  This is my 'forever' crust from now on.  Thank you for posting!

Finally! A good pie crust. For several years, Iv'e been trying to perfect my crust, with not much success. My search is over. The only changes I made was using butter instead of shortening, and leaving it in the fridge for @ 30 minutes, instead of 10. A flaky crust that was easy to roll out. I mixed it by hand, but next time, I'll use the food processor.

This is a superb pie crust!  I recommend browsing these comments (as I did), to cater this crust to your preference.  But the distilled white vinegar absolutely makes it spectacular!
And with the perimeters of using butter/shortening etc... you can make it YOUR perfect pie crust!

Nice crust. Easy to make. Only suggestion is if you are going to use it for a sweet pie (as opposed to a pot pie or something), you may want to add a little sugar. Either add a lil powdered sugar and water or a lil granulated sugar.

This is by FAR the best crust recipe I have ever used, either baking personally for my family or professionally. it is sweet, crumbly, flaky, melt in your mouth good. So you all know, the recipe in its original form is EXCELLENT, 5 stars in itself. However, substituting butter for the shortening made an equally delicious subset of the same recipe if you love butter as much as, well, most people in the world. The sugar gives it a sweetness other crusts lack, and the vinegar brings it together, and even adds the slightest tang. This has basically become my new permanent pastry-piecrust recipe.

BEST CRUST EVER! I followed the directions word for word, and used this to make my first-ever lattice crust for Grandma Ople's Apple pie. Since this recipe as written makes two crusts, I had some left over that I cut with cookie cutters to put over the extra apples that didn't fit in the pie! This is so easy, and tastes SO GOOD!!!!!!!

Wonderful flavor and good texture.  The dough was easy to work with.  Chill the dough and you won't have problems.  I used it for a cherry pie with a lattice top and got rave reviews.  This is a rich and slightly sweet dough that I will use again.

I have not made crust in years because usually its tough.  I decided to try this one first.  If not for my Foodie help on the "recipe exchange" I would have not got this right. I did do 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening. I like the end result, it eas flaky, I do think it has just a touch to much salt, so I would cut that back, next time.  I am still have more recipes in my box to try, from my Foodies on the exchange. I think I will try a different one just to see the differences. Thanks for the recipe and THANKS everyone for helping me!

I wanted an Apple Pie for my 32nd Birthday and it had to be made from scratch. I found the perfect pie recipe and went searching for the perfect crust to go along with it...I found it! I used butter flavored shortening instead of the one that the recipe called for, it turned out far greater than any of my expectations. This pie crust recipe will be used again and again. It was so light and flaky, it melted in your mouth and made the tastebuds dance with every bite. Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

This is the most PERFECT EASY TO USE pastry I have ever made!  I used it for Grandma Oples Apple pie and it was delicious. I have never had pastry roll out so easily before. I live in New Zealand and we don't have shortening so I just used butter and it worked fine. Thanks I'll be using this forever!

This is not the crust for the novice piemaker. I am a novice. I followed the directions to the t. taking in mind all the tips for making a pie crust. It was so crumbly. Not easy to work with. Very salty too.

This was my first attempt at making pastry from scratch, and it turned out perfectly. Everyone had eaten the lattice off of the top of the pie by the end of the evening. The dough, however was VERY sticky, so I had to add quite a lot of extra flour to it before rolling it out. Also, I would recommend putting it in the freezer, rather than the fridge, and for at least an hour. This recipe's a keeper! Thanks!

..Love this recipe.  Had a bunch of Granny Smith apples and decided to make Fried apple pies.  This pastry was easy to use, held up when fried and resulted in a sweet flaky crust for my apple filling. The only change I made was used butter rather than shortening. Think I will try cherry next...Thanks TJ!

I don't really even like pie crust, but this one was light,flaky, and very edible.  I resisted the urge to use a 6th Tbs of water--just smashed it all together carefully with my hands at the end.  I would recommend covering the edges with foil right from the start--mine over-browned a bit in the first 15 minutes of the 425-degree heat that my pumpkin pie starts out at.

For some reason, I've never been able to make a pie crust that I've been satisfied with...until now.  WOW!  What a great recipe!  I'm not even going to bother going back to the old basic pie crust recipe.  This one gives excellent, consistant results.  Apple pies, peach pies, berry pies, pumpkin pies...here I come!  I finally feel confident enough about the results to make pies for guests.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

This is the best pie crust!  Beautiful & flaky!  I especially like it with a berry filling, it seems to really compliment the tart berries.  It is also good for an apple pie, much better than the old standard pie crust.  I have already had many compliments on my crust, it has now replaced my 'old standard'; Betty crocker crust...It is definately a keeper!  It ended my years of making an ugly pie that tasted ok, now I can make a beautiful pie that tastes incredible!  The only change I make is that I brush the crust with milk & sprinkle turbinado sugar on top before baking.

I always hate reading bad reviews when I'm looking for a great recipe, but this did not work at all for me.  The only change I made was that I left the dough in the fridge longer...about an hour.  It wouldn't hold together at all - and I used the extra tablespoon of water, too!  I would suggest using the Best Pie Crust Ever recipe from this site - I used it for my other pies and it was amazing.

This crust was very light and browned nicely. Instead of using regular shortening I used butter flavored Crisco and it gave the dough a light butter flavor. I brushed the top of the pie with one egg and milk and sprinkled sugar for a nice golden crust! I am making this again for evey holiday!

So easy that I now feel confident making pie crust!!  I used lard - and changed the amount of sugar depending on the type of pie I made.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!  Try it with Aunt Carol's Apple Pie - guaranteed success!

Easy to make, easy to work with.  It also keeps well in the frig or freezer, so i make it in quadruple batches. i don't like the crust part of pies or quiches, but i really liked the lightness and texture of this.  And "scraps" can be rolled out, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, and baked on a greased cookie sheet till lightly browned- kids love them!

This was a delicious pie crust!  My husband wanted apple pie with "lots of crust" and he absolutely loved this.  This was my first try and making a homemade crust and the recipe was also very, very easy!  Thanks!  This will be the only recipe I will ever use!

easy to make, and turns out wonderful every time. I like the fact that it only needs to rest for 10 mins in the refrigerator, unlike other recipes, where the chilling time is longer.

Excellent pie crust recipe! I'd never made a pie crust using vinegar before; now I don't think I'll make one without it! Light, tender dough that's very easy to work with. Great for lattice top pies.

This was almost the exact recipe I used years ago and lost.  It's a great pastry to work with.  However I found it way too salty!  Almost threw it out because of it.  I think 1/2 - 3/4 tsp would be enough.  You can also substitute brown sugar for the white sugar for a nice change.

Was told it was the best pie crust my tasters had ever had! Subbed good butter for the shortening, ended up adding another TBSP of water to form into ball, more flour to roll.

This crust was very easy to put together, especially using the food processor.  Just mixed the dry ingredients with the butter and shortening (used a little of each) in the machine, then added the blended egg/water/vinegar mixture in the little 'drizzle' cap and pulsed a few more times.  Was very careful to not overwork and it came together very nicely and was easy to roll.  My only problem with the crust is it really wanted to just fall apart when transferring to the pie plate, so a little tricky there.  Pie crust came out light and flaky.  To me, this recipe was not quite enough for a deep-dish double crust pie, but a little more than needed for one crust.  Saved the scraps from the 2 pies made with this recipe and had about enough for another.

Excellent flakey pie crust. Makes 2 pie crusts. I used butter instead of shortening. Use a few more tablespoons of water than was called for and the crust was a bit crumbly but it still came out fine. You could probably make this and store in fridge for a few hours or over night if you want to make it in advance.

It won first place in a berry pie contest! Super yummy and flakey. We followed the tips to use ice cold water and to not pat it out but to put it between two pieces of Saran Wrap.  Oh and we used only butter. It will be our go-to recipe for a pie crust from now on.

I've never made my own roll out pie crust before so when i thought i'd try i was nervous about it turning out. I used this recipe and it was AMAZING. The only different about i did was to used vanilla instead of vinegar (because i did not have any, otherwise i probably would've). My fresh apricot pie was so delicious and flakey! It turned out better than if i'd bought it at a bakery! My husband was so impressed... Will definitely use again and again.

Great recipe! I needed a little more water than the 5 tablespoons called for but Im not sure if that was my problem or the recipes. Also, I egg washed the dough once on the pie and sprinkled with sugar. Would use this one again. Thanks!

Wow!  I had sworn off of making homemade pie crust because I just couldn't find an easy, tasty recipe that would work for me.  This recipe is just that.  It comes together very easily in the food processor.  It's a very sturdy dough that is easy to handle even when rolled out thin.  Very tasty too.  The amount of sugar is easily adjustable for various fillings.  I keep the amount as is for tart lemon pie and cut it down a bit for sweet berry filling or apple.  Very good versatile recipe!

Delicious. Very flaky. Used it to make a Strawberry Rhubarb pies. Oh my Goodness. Used Crisco butter shortening.

Here's my story, so my mother thinks I can't cook and that the stove is too dangerous for me. Well, a friend told me about allrecipes and so I created an account. Quiche is one of my mother's favourites, so I decided on making that. I searched up some pie crusts, and what I found was "french pastry crust". It made my mouth water by just reading the title. I knew it would be hard, but it was surprisingly easy. Now my mother knows that anyone can cook. Thanks TJ!

I have tried many a pie crust recipe with many a bad result. This recipe is either full-proof, or I've finally figured out how to handle a crust. I can almost guarantee that it's the recipe, and not me, that is turning out great crusts. The recipe works for either one double-crust pie or two bottom crusts.

I often substitute butter for the shortening, as I love the buttery, flaky crust. I haven't done it yet, but I've honestly considered just baking the empty pie crust and having that for dessert.

The best pie crust I have ever made! I can not steer away from this recipe. I've tried others and my pie tasters notice the difference. This crust has the right amount of flakliness that once you try it you will be automatically hooked! Been making this since 2007 and it has never let me down.

I did substitute frozen butter for the shortening. pulsing dry ingredients in food processor with the frozen butter until it resembles course meal. Added the liquid formed  2 balls, and then I kept it in the freezer for 10 minutes before rolling out.  This was one of the best recipes I have ever used.  It comes out flaky and buttery flavored, everyone raves abut it!

Excellent crust!! A good tip is to measure your 5T of water from a small bowl of ice water. I used one right away and rolled the other up in wax paper and stuck it in a ziplock in the freezer. It worked just as well as the one I used right away. I used them both for coconut custard pies and received as many complements on the crust as I did the pie!

This crust was fantastic! I was a bit shocked to see vinegar listed in the ingredients but,it was fine. The crust came out perfectly crusty and even had a bunch left over for a mini pie. Definitely reccomend it!

I will use the recipe time and again. It was fantastic. First I made Three Berry Pie from this site and then I made Strawberry Cheese Pie also from this site from the same batch. The crust was thick and flaky even rolling 2 bottom crusts and a top crust. YUM!

This recipe makes the perfect pie crust.  For ease and speed, I made it in my food processor, processing just until mixed.   The crust was tender, had good flavor, and browned nicely.   This is a keeper.

The pie crust I've been dreaming of :-)  I thought other reviews were exaggerating but I love this crust.  It was flaky but moist and tender, and the dough has a forgiving stretchy texture that made rolling out easy.  I had given up and gone to premade shells but now I will make my own.  Thanks!

This crust is fabulous! It is very versatile. I was looking for a fast and easy but delicious crust for a Lemon Meringue pie when I decided to use this one. It came together very easily. I used the Saran wrap tip someone else mentioned and it made it even easier. I added a little lemon zest to mine just to compliment my filling. Since I only needed a bottom crust I had some leftover so I used it as the crust for Pecan Tassies from this site and they came out great as well. The lemon zest also went with the pecan filling rather well. I will definitely be using this again.

The. BEST. pie crust. I have ever made.  I used this for a blueberry pie and can't believe how yummy and flakey it was!  I did this all in my food processor (something I've never done with my pie crust before) and it made the process simple.

Sorry, this came out very strange, and not very pie crusty at all!  It was so difficult to roll, it drove me mad, and after I got it as thin as I could it was torture to get into the pan, and then... it baked up so THICK it hardly resembled pie crust, more like a crumbly pastry cake or something.  The pie was more crust than apple.  (Yes, I have cooked many pie crusts before and I know they are tricky!  Maybe it was something I did, but it is unusual for me to have crust problems anymore.  I only gave this new one a try because of the reviews.  I cursed myself for not sticking with a recipe I had used before.)  I guess if people love this one, they must love the kind of texture it has? Really, it tasted fine, but it was nowhere near as thin and crust-like as it needed to be. Very cakey. :(

This is the first time I've ever tried to make a pie crust - and it was beautiful! It takes time, being from scratch and all, but it's crispy and delicious.  I used this to make turnovers as well!

SUPER, SUPER, SUPER!!!!  I have tried at least three different pie crusts and they always fell apart.  I was beginning to give up on ever being able to successfully make a homemade crust, but then I tried this recipe....I will definitely always use it in the future and will be sure to tell all my friends about it too!

Delish and easy to do!!!! I used this recipe when my store bought (i guess there's a reason one should not cheat) pie shells broke apart while i was preparing old fashioned apple dumplings (another new recipe i was trying out from this site). Thank you TJ and Mom!!

After reading countless reviews, I did the following: -  1. Used 3/4 cup of shortening + 1/4 cup of butter for flavour. 2. Cut in shortening and butter with flour mixture using 2 forks like others. 3. Put dough in ziplock bag and only lightly squeeze to form a disk to ensure that I did not overwork on dough. 4. Chilled dough for 20 minutes before rolling. 5. Lightly floured worktop before rolling the dough.  Verdict? Pastry dough was found to be too hard to handle as it either stuck on the rolling pin or on my grease-proof paper. Even though with constant flouring on rolling pin and worktop; some part of dough torn apart in the process of rolling and transferring to pie dish. I had to spend more time in patting in extra dough to "rectify" the situation!  Considering all the hassle of making it, I will not make this again as we found the pie crust taste to be nothing unusual and I will revert to the no-fail “Basic Flaky Pie Crust” by Stephanie (also from this site)!

Freakishly easy.  I would consider using some butter next time or butter-flavored shortening as it was pretty bland, but a very light crust indeed and very simple!

It was good.  I used one suggestion of putting the dough in plastic wrap...that was helpful.  I just did not get the WOW from my husband as I was hoping.  I am going to try another recipe.

thank you. This was the first time i make a pastry for an apple pie recipe. I did it, it turned out flaky and delicious.
I froze the butter and used a box grater to grate the butter. it make it easier to incorporate into the flour.I also added a little more water till it made a ball.It will takes great with apples. I also used grandma Opel's recipe .. really easy and lovely. Thank u again will definetly make again. 

 I made this again, in a weeks time.. because it was soo good.But this time i use all shortening, the golden crisco to be specific. It turned out wayy better. Don't get me wrong the butter was good too but I found it makes the crust hard to cut into. Very flavourful but too hard.Where is the crisco makes it oohh soo flaky and so delicious and tender. so I recommend you use crisco.

Very Very good. My kid doesnt like pie for some reason, but he ate around the pie to enjoy the delicious crust. I did end up using the 5tblsp of water, it worked out great.

My all time favorite pastry dough that I've ever made. The easiest to work with. I used my Cuisnart food processor and it worked wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully.

I made this recipe once with butter and once with shortening.  The shortening was actually easier to work with and came out flakier.

I always pat milk on the crust before baking as well. This crust has the GREATEST taste! My grandmother use to say "you know when you're a good baker, is when you master the pie crust". She's right..they aren't all created equal. This recipe was identical to hers (I lost her recipe and she died 5 yrs ago) and I will hold onto this for ever! Thanks for submitting this!!

This is the first pie crust recipe I have ever attempted. It was easy to follow, and the end product tasted fantastic; flaky and buttery. I paired this recipe with Apple Pie I which is also from this site. I will definitely use this recipe whenever I bake a pie!

very tasty!  Flakey and slightly sweet.  I used it to make some apple tarts. I made a double recipe and had not quite enough shortening so I used 1 1/2 cups crisco and 1/2 cup butter.  Turned out wonderful.  I'm sure that a delicious option would be to use all butter flavored crisco.

Originally I have given this pie crust a 5 stars rating but recently I have found a great and easy pie crust recipe.  I liked this recipe but I found that it can be quite time consuming to roll the pie crust.

Perfect easy to make pie crust. I used this recipe to make mini custard tarts. I would, however, cut in an additional 1/2 cup butter into the flour and sugar as well because the 1 cup shortening seemed to not be enough. Other then that, this recipe is excellent and easy to make!

The crust was great. Did a few adjustments: put 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 1/2, added 1/2 c butter & 1/2 c shortening instead of 1 c shortening, ran out of white vinegar so I added apple cider vinegar. I covered the crust edges with foil & remove midway to brown them. I made a lemon pie & orange pie. They recieved good reviews. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks a lot.

This was the best pie crust I've ever made. I have not been very sucessful with any pie crust in the past even those that claim to be "never fail". I used this for apple dumplings... WOW! This was really great. Tender and flaky. I think my search for the perfect piecrust is over.

I have always stayed away from baking pies because the crust was so intimidating.  I can't believe how easy this was.  I will now be a baking fool! :-)

So yummy, flaky, delicious!!!!

 My daughter made little pie crust cookies out of the leftovers and she loved them!

This is by far the best pie crust that I have ever had.  I haven't changed a thing from the original recipe other than one time when I ran out of distilled white vinegar and used apple cider vinegar in its place and the crust was still amazing.  Every time I make this recipe I get rave reviews from everyone, oftentimes it is compared to "Grandma's" crust.

I bake pies often, and this is not one of the best pie crusts that I have used.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and although it was easy to work with, and had an ok taste, it was very tough, not flaky at all on Aunt Opals lattice crust pie (now there's a great recipe!)  Sorry, not a keeper for me.  Fool-proof pie crust is much better and flakier.  I'll keep that one.

This crust is very easy to work with.  I have made my own crust for years, and I will now use this recipe as my basic pie crust.  I will try using less salt and more sugar for dessert crusts, and less salt and less or no sugar for quiche crusts.

This was my first try at a "Home Made Crust" I will DEFENETELY  be using this again.  Especially when the crust was still flakey a few days after Thanksgiving when reheated in the microwave. DO NOT BAKE FIRST.  Just roll it out and poured in the pie filling.  Baked it for 15 minutes at 450 then lowered it to 350.

PERFECT!!  I loved this crust.  I did cut the salt in half and I did need the extra tablespoon of water.  I brushed the top of the pie with an egg wash ( 1 egg and water) and I sprinkled it with sugar before baking my apple pie.  It browned beautifully and got raves from everyone who tried it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I will use it again.

I am not known for my pie crust if you know what I mean so I'm just going to say that I tried it twice and the second time came out much better.  I just have a hard time working with crust:(  My hubby says I worked the dough too much the first time - isn't he a sweetie!

I made this recipe with the apple pie by grandma ople and it turned out wonderful. I found that it worked out better if it was only in the fridge that ten mins. I made some the day before and it didn't work for the lattice top so I made a second batch and it worked great. Everyone thought it was the best pie they had ever eaten. Thanks for the recipe.

Very flaky and light - I used 3/4 shortening and 1/4 butter. A pastry knife (multiple blades) makes this dough in a jiffy!

I used this recipe to make mini mincemeat tarts and it was great! I used butter rather than shortening. I also used the suggestion of putting the dough ball in a plastic ziplock bag and stuck it in the freezer for 10 minutes. After taking out, I cut the sides of the bag and rolled the dough sandwich. It worked really well. I will definitely use this recipe again. Delicious!

I replaced the shortening with unsalted butter and apple cider vinegar instead of white distilled trying to replicate a recipe I used as a teenager. Definitely a go-to and the sweetness is more fitting for pies amd hand pies than a typical crust recipe.

Did not turn out at all, was a crumbly mess, even rolled out between sheets of plastic wrap.  Read many reviews and took note of suggestions.  Very disappointed. Threw it out and went  back to my old recipe.

Look no further!! This is the ultimate pie crust to use for every pie you make!! I worried about this recipe not having butter, and choose to use another recipe that used all butter at first. Big mistake! Crust was tough and not flaky at all. So on the next pie I used this recipe and wow!!!!!!!! It was flaky and melted in my mouth!!!!!!!! I made it my own for a peach pie by substituting 1/4 cup of the flour with ground walnuts (ground to powder using a spice grinder) and then using brown sugar instead of white sugar. For the shortening I used butter crisco that had spent the night before in the freezer. Just before baking, I took another reviewers suggestion and brushed with an egg white only egg wash, and sprinkled with a sugar cinnamon mixture. The result was a pefect crust with a spectacular glaze and the taste was fantastic!!!!! I could seriously eat the whole pan of crust by myself  and will definately never buy store bought crust again! This is my go to secret pie crust now. Try it, you wont regret.

This is the BEST pie crust recipe EVER! I've used it to make my apple pies and chocolate sawdust pies every holiday season for 6 years now!. The recipe calls for shortening,  but I prefer to substitute 1 cup unsalted butter instead, for flavor. Either way, it's always a great result. If you choose to use butter, try grating the cold butter into your dry ingredients. This prevents any big clumps, and you won't have to work the dough as much to mix it, so the end product is has a better, flakier texture and taste. Always use the 5th tablespoon of water, and a brush of egg-wash on top makes the most gorgeous, golden-brown presentation! Try it. Love it. Save it.

This is the first pie crust that did not fall apart, when I put it in the dish. I am a new be to cooking pie. I made rhubard, strawberry and blueberry pie. I am 66 years old and had my first rhubard pie, I have been missing so much in life. I did use butter.

I made this pie crust recipe on Saturday, February 28th. The crust to my pine tarts came out so flaky I was totally surprised compared to a recipe I used the previous Saturday which was okay but did not have the flakiness I was looking for in my crust. I was a little skeptical but decided to try it since so many people gave it five stars. I was not disappointed at all. This recipe like many mentioned in their review is a keeper. If you want flaky crusts to your desserts you must try this recipe. I used butter flavored shortening so I did not add salt. The butter in the shortening gave the crust a nice flavor.

I made an apple pie with this crust on Christmas. It was a wonderful dough, very easy to make and use. It even tasted good two days later. Will be using this crust again to make pop tarts.

I have not made pie crust for maybe 30 years or so because I believe the crust makes or breaks the pie and couldn't see the use of making a tough and dry crust when I could get a better one frozen.  
Well I have to tell you I will never buy a pie crust again.  This crust was tasty and flaky winning me compliments from my hubby and dinner guests.  Did take advice of another reviewer and after mixing with fork till it held together, I put it in cling wrap and mixed till I got a ball of dough.  I then put it between 2 sheets of waxed paper, rolled it out and Voila!  Thanks TJ.

I was a little hesitant at first, really, an egg??  Silly me, this is the best pie crust I have ever tried.  I mixed until it was crumbly and put in the zip lock bag and formed a ball, then refrigerated it for about an hour.   A bit hard to work as it is so flaky...but worth the effort.  Top of my list for pie crusts!!

Let me start by saying, I hate when people review a recipe after they've changed just about everything about it. Although, I did make a couple tiny changes, I didn't change it drastically. I used 1/2 shortening & 1/2 butter, cut the salt to 3/4t. and replaced 1/3 of the AP flour with whole wheat flour (as with all of my baked goods and homemade pastas). I used it for apple dumplings. The crust was very good, tender and had great flavor. The only complaint I have is that it was hard to work with. I had a heck of a time getting it wrapped around the apples without tearing it. I eventually did and the outcome was absolutely delicious! I'm sure this crust would be better suited to a pie, but I'm glad I tried it!

Excellent, easy and tasty.  Nothing like that awful stuff you can buy in the grocery store.  Made this while dinner was cooking and put in the fridge to rest, perfect!

I just made a delicious chicken pot pie with this recipe. I replaced shortening with lard, cause someone told me you can't make a good pie without lard. This was also my first pie crust ever. I love it. Flaky, crusty....everything you want in a pie crust. My fiancee says that now I can make that pie crust, he needs an apple pie.

The crust was delish - best that I have ever made.  I had to add a little more water that what was indicated to get the dough to ball up, but other than that everything was perfect.  I will definitely be making this again

BEST PIE CRUST RECIPE EVER!!  It baked fantastically! I used butter instead of the shortening (because I always sub with butter for shortening. I just love the flavor it gives). I also had to add a little more water to get it to come together. It was just a fantastic recipe and I will be using it from now on! Thanks so much for sharing!

This crust was tender and flaky. I loved it. Its def important to work fast because once your hands warm up the dough its becomes hard to work with.

This is a delicious pie crust and will be made again for sure!  I believe that I'll make it 1 1/2 recipes next time so I can have a little more to decorate the edges of my pie with little cutouts.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first pie I made from scratch but it turned out great! I used the apple pie by Grandma Ople recipe with it and it was a great combination. Highly recommended! Thanks for the recipe!

Maybe I did something wrong because most of the reviews on this pie crust are 5-stars which convinced me to try it, but I dont like it.  Would give it one more try to see if maybe I messed up or I just dont like it.  I know I 'oopsed' on the vinegar but not by much, additionally I grabbed the wrong flour so maybe....so we will see (to be con't)

Was looking for a different crust that A) had flavor and B) was flaky. Was very pleased with the outcome of this crust. Used it to make both apple and a pumpkin pie.

I am apprehensive of using vinegar in a pie crust. We will see... Well I tasted it before baking and surprisingly it did not taste like vinegar at all.

This was very good! I did find however that it was not enough to make a double crust! unless it's supposed to be rolled out very thin??
My pie wasn't cooked on the bottom, so I advise to cook the pie crust (without filling) a bit first before adding the filling!

This is a great recipe but do note that this isnt as sweet as I expected, I grew up in England where the pudding pastry is sweet- this to my taste, was great for quiche not the apple pie I wanted.(in hind sight, I added a bit too much vinegar- so thats probably why its tasted less sweet) In the end dissaster was averted by making the custard sauce sweeter than usual. That being said the texture, consistency and useability are outta this world. I ommited the egg , as we have allergies and and it didnt harm the pastry at all.In fact we ditched the shortening- for pure Norwegian butter.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I can't seem to understand what went so terribly wrong, both times I tried this recipe.  I made it once early in the day, and it was dry and crumbly, so much that I couldn't even roll it out and get it in the pan.  I tried adding water, but it didn't work.  I almost went to a different recipe, but thought it must have been something that I did wrong because of all of the high reviews.  So I gave this one another shot.  Same thing - dry, crumbly.  I made a different recipe and it came out fantastic.  Not sure why this recipe just won't work for me, but I won't be trying it again.

Had high hopes for this recipe, but it came out more crunchy than flakey. I handled the dough very little, as I've always done to achieve a flakey texture. I think perhaps there is just too much liquid in this recipe.

OMG! this was my very first try at making a "from scratch" pie crust, usually I buy frozen pie shells. I will never do that again! this was so easy and so buttery and good (I used only butter because that's what I had)...because this was my first try there were some things on my side that I could have done better... I didn't roll it out enough so the bottom crust was kinda thick (the top crust was fine) and although for me it was good i know that won't appeal to everybody so next time i'll roll it out thinner, but overall this was a great recipe and will now be my go to pie crust recipe because it was soooo easy...btw, i made the crust the night before, wrapped in plastic wrap and left in the fridge...in the morning i let it sit for a few minutes before working with it and the prior suggestions about using plastic wrap vs. flour for rolling it out made it that much easier!! woohoo!!

This pie crust is amazing. My husband said it was the best he has ever had and he's a very picky pie crust eater. Love it! I used all butter and followed the advice of making it in the food processor. That was brilliant! WAY easier than cutting the butter in by hand.

WOW! What a great pie crust. I have NEVER been able to make pie crust. This morning @ 6am I wanted to make a strawberry pie. Having no frozen in the fridge, I checked on my favorite recipe website. I used my food processor,follow the recipe exactly, used the two sheets of plastic wrap, and it rolled out perfectly. I kept  looking @ it, not believing my eyes. What a keeper. I have been transformed!

Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing I did different was to add more water, by tablespoon, until it formed a ball. But it had the best taste and so crispy! What a winner!

Absolutely wonderful!! I used it for a strawberry pie recipe, and it was gone in minutes. One tiny change though, I used a little less salt than it called for b/c some of the others said it was too salty. It turned out PERFECTLY.

Delicious!  My daughter, who does not like traditional pie crust, raved about this one!  Great texture, great taste, baked up very nicely.  This will be my go-to pie crust from now on.

Both Nick & dad like this crust. It's sticky & works best with cold, wet hands. The top crust rolls best between wax paper.

OMG this pie crust turned out so delicious! I used it when I made a turkey pot pie that was a little too salty and sweetness of this crust balanced it out perfectly.This will be my pie crust recipe from now on:D

By far the best pie crust recipe I have used. The flavor and flakey texture are excellent. I followed the recipe exactly. Used the ziplock bag tip from another review to roll it out (neat tip thanks). Also used my food processor to cut in shortening and add the liquids. Baked a one crust and two crust pie, didn't have to cover the edges. Both pies baked up beautifully. Crust didn't even get soggy with the watery apple pie I made. A keeper.

I have used this recipe for years because it always turns out great.  Use one crust and freeze the other for later.  It's the only crust recipe I use.

I tried this recipe and found that the vinegar adds somewhat of a bitter aftertaste.  Try using lemon juice instead.

This crust is fantastic.  I have little experience with pie baking, but the crust still came out flaky and delicious.  I will definitely use it again.

This crust is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a great success. This is the first crust that I have made, I usually take the safe road and use Pillsbury. I'm glad I took the chance, my family preferred this crust. I am no longer afraid to make my own crust and I will use this recipe from now on.

Used this crust for a peach-blueberry pie, and it was fabulous.  I used butter for 1/2 the fat.  It got rave reviews from my friends who shared it with me.

I have tried every pie crust known to man, with marginal luck at best, and this one is by far the best. It stays together well, tastes wonderfully flaky and yummy, and best of all, it didn't cause my husband to seek refuge on the opposite end of our house while I was making pies.

This was a great crust! I cut the recipe in half and made eight mini-pies in a muffin pan. I did go ahead and use a full egg when halving the recipe. I also used cinnamon sugar instead of regular sugar. Mmm...~!

A better crust than my 90-year-old grandmother makes - and she said so.  I usually use half shortening and half butter.  I roll it out between two sheets of wax paper.  Comes out perfect every time.

I have been afraid to try pastry as previous attempts have yielded tough, chewy, disgusting pastry.  This recipe, on the other hand, has me baking tarts and pies with confidence.  I don't like vinegar so I substituted lemon juice.

This is the best pie crust!! It comes out flaky and delicious, and the recipe makes a generous amount of dough. I suggested making sure all of your ingredients are very cold when you  make it, and don't overwork or overhandle the dough.

This is the best and easiest dessert pie crust recipe!!
I love that you don't need to have everything chilled and it comes together in no time. I took the advice from other reviewers and I just plastic wrap to bring all of the crumbs together in a ball and then I put it in the fridge for an hour to make sure it was nice and firm. I also used butter flavored shortening to give it an extra rich taste, I have tried it both ways and every time it turns out flaky and delicious.
It was easy to roll out and stayed together beautifully, make sure to poke holes in the bottom.

This crust is awesome! I've used both shortening and butter, both are good, but I prefer the butter. This crust is so versitle, I've made it for blueberry pies and even used it for a turkey pot pie.

A very good recipe. Flaky and tender. I made mine with unsalted butter and the flavour was good. For those of you in NZ or Aust that say you can't get shortening you can! It is sold next to the oils in 500g tubs as Kremelta or Chefade.

This is the recipe I always use for my pies; the added sweetness is a must for me. It has excellent taste and flavor once cooked. It won't give you any trouble rolling it out for a basic crust...but it's a nightmare if you're planning something ornate. NEVER attempt a lattice top with this crust--I learned the hard way. **Update** I just made this again for an apple pie today, and finally tried rolling it between two pieces of wax paper. Worked great! So much easier than the usual rolling/transfer.

I made pies for the first time ever this Thanksgiving. I used two different pie crust recipies. This one was great!  It was pretty easy to work with and turned out so yummy that I ate some of the left over little pieces unbaked! I followed the advice of others and made sure everything was very cold, did half regular cisco and half butter cisco, and refigerated over night. Thanks for sharing!

I've never had a pie crust turn out well, til I tried this one! Turns out perfect every time. I used butter flavored shortening and the cling wrap trick, so it dosen't get over worked.

I used my food processor to mix the dough. Used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. It is very important to keep these cold. Rolling out the dough (always a challenge) was actually not too bad. I used this crust in a peach cream pie recipe which baked @ 400 for 40 minutes. The crust turned a lovely colour and didn't burn at all. I am rating a 4 as I could taste the salt in the finished crust. I will use this recipe again.

Excellent, easy to make and very different. I made the Blackberry chocolate pie (here on allrecipes) and used this pie crust. You just have to try it to believe it.

the taste of this crust was fantastic! I replaced all the shortening w/ butter (I prefer pure saturated fat over transfats :P ) I used this for a banana cream pie, so I had to bake the crust first and since there weren't any instructions on how long to bake the crust, I waited until the crust was golden and ended up over baking it so the crust was a bit hard instead of tender and flaky, but still tasted great. I will try it again and bake only until lightly golden

The consistency of this crust is great, but I can't take the flavor of the shortening. If you are ok with that you will like it.

This was my first pie crust from scratch, and it turned out so flaky and delicious, even though I messed up and the fat had melted slightly by the time it baked. I used half butter/half shortening, 1 tsp. salt, and 2 1/2 tbp. sugar. Delicious!

Seriously, if I could give this 0 stars I would.  I don't know how anyone can stand baking with shortening.  The after-taste in this pie crust was just gross!  And I used only 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup butter.  Unfortunataly, none of my guests ate the crust of the apple pie I used this recipe for.  I will throw away the rest of my pie because the crust just ruined it.  And next time, I will definitely steer clear of any pie crust that calls for shortening in the recipe.

I tried this pie crust yesterday for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful and very easy to make. One of the reviews suggested using saran wrap to roll out the crusts. Fantastic idea and not much mess to clean up. I will definately use this recipe again. Thank you

I used this crust for a "Better than Pumpkin" pie and a Caramel Apple pie from this website.  Both were fantastic, and the crust was wonderful.  I did use half shortening, half butter, and I needed about 3-4 extra Tbsp of cold water than the recipe stated.  It was very easy to work with, and tasted great!

This crust was fantastic!  Easy to make, easy to roll out, and just a touch of sweetness with the sugar added.  This will now be the recipes i use all the time for crusts!

Couldn't get this to work for me as well as I would have liked.  Very good taste though, more like a cookie than a crust.  I used it with a lemon pie and a chocolate peanut butter pie -- held up better with the chocolate peanut butter.

I hate, hate, hate pie crust, but since I made this for my husband, I had to try a bite.  Oh, gosh, it was delicious!!  I can't wait until my apple pie is gone (used Grandma Ople's recipe from this site) so I can try another one.  I'd never made my own pie crust before, and I was nervous, but it rolled out just perfectly!  Thank you!

I am still somewhat of a novice pie-maker, but with this crust I always get a great looking, great tasting pie crust. (My fiancee calls it the "sugar cookie" pie crust.) Great recipe!

I attempted this recipe today, in conjunction with "Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie".  I say "attempted", because I've never been able to make pie pastry successfully - for some reason, it never turns out how it should.

This recipe, however, was different!  Simple to follow, easy to combine, and it didn't fall apart when I was rolling it out between two pieces of wax paper.  The *only* thing I didn't quite like was that the pastry seemed over salty, when I tried a tiny piece of the dough.  However, when I used it in combination with the lemon meringue pie, you couldn't really tell.

Overall, it's a very good recipe, even for those that are pastry challenged  - I just might reduce the salt a tiny bit when I use it with sweet fruit pies. :)

This pie crust was perfect! I used it for a blueberry, a peach and an apple pies and they all came out with lovely light flakly crusts. I highly recommend it.Next time I will add a little lemon zest for the apple pie. I did not use less salt as my family likes the salty taste.

I used this pie crust in a Lemon Meringue Pie and it was perfect. I did cut back on the salt as others suggested. Since the recipe makes enough for two crusts, I used one and froze the rest.

This was just what I was looking for.  I love to bake and this was my first "from scratch" pie shell.  I used it for a fresh blueberry pie and this was excellent.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I followed the review suggestion to put the dough in saran wrap after cutting in the shortening.  I kneeded it lightly then refrigerated it 10 min.
After dividing the dough in half I had to refrigerate the second half to keep it cold for rolling the top crust.   
The crust came out flaky and delicious. I prefer the crust to the filling in a pie and this crust is good even all by itself.  
This is definitely a five star recipe and easy for even novice pie makers like me.

This was my 1st try at a pie crust from scratch.  I will NEVER use a Store bought crust again.  This was so easy and even remained flakey days later & when the Apple & Sour Cream Bluebery pies were re heated in the Micro. THIS IS A KEEPER!

I had always been afraid to make home made pies and pie crust....but this recipe made it so easy. The only thing I changed is that I substituted butter flavored Crisco for the regular shorting (I kept it in the refrigerator before I used it to keep it cold, so it would cut in the flour better.) I used this crust to make Grandma Ople's Apple Pie...also on this site. Thanks, TJ, for a great recipe - it rocks!

This is the best pie crust ever! It's fool proof. I have a tendancy to over work the dough and I figured I had but when it came out of the oven, it was so flaky and tender. Awesome!

Very good. Made this with a shoofly pie I also found on this site. I used an egg substitute and that worked fine. I also added a bit of lemon zest to the dough and put it in the freezer for a half hour. I will make this crust again.

Incredibly easy to make.  I was a little worried about the vinegar, but no worries.  It turned out very flaky and not at all dry like some crusts do.

My crust turned out quite hard.  I think I may have worked the dough too much because I had to keep adding more water than the recipe called for or I couldn't get it to roll out as it kept separating.  When I finally got the right amount of water and consistency in the dough, it had been worked too much.  I suggest adding extra water at the beginning so as not to overwork the dough.

This pastry pie crust was really easy to make, really easy to roll out and tasted EXCELLENT. I used it with the Blueberry Pie recipe by Beth and the result was fantastic.
Instead of mixing by hand, i used the blender and instead of shortening i used butter. It still turned out really really yummy! Thanks TJ!

This was the first pie crust I have ever made and I was really dreading trying it. I  thought it would take me forever and it would be really hard to make.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy the dough was to work with.  The only thing is that the recipe says it makes two crusts.  I halved it and didn't have enough dough for the top of the pie.  Next time I will make the whole recipe.

yay! This pastry recipe works out really well. I paired it with Grandma Opple's Apple Pie and it was great... (thanks to another reviewer who gave me the idea!) Definetly will keep this recipe and use it again and again! I found it easier to put it between 2 pieces of Saran wrap, and then roll it. No mess... Thank you TJ, great recipe!

This is a great recipe. I use real butter (not margarine) instead of shortening and it works even better. It comes out with a nice thick crust that holds the juices in that is buttery and a great compliment to grandma ople's apple pie recipe.

Excellent taste and texture with the blueberry pie. This was a my first crust EVER, but I did have to do it twice. First time, I cut warm "shortening" in too much and couldn't mix in the wet ingredients. I threw that away and tried with shortening from the fridge. I was also careful only to cut until it looked like "course meal". Went MUCH better. Browned nicely, tastes great! Recommended recipe.

So easy and delicious. I use this crust as a base for all my pie crusts. It can be made with butter also which I think pairs well with a more savory pie.

I made this and used it to make an apple pie for my sons 37th birthday - he’s not a cake fan - this crust is SO GOOD! The only change to it that I made, was to substitute unsalted butter in place of the shortening. I did use my food processor like another reviewer on here suggested and it made it so fast. It turned out perfect and the crust has really good flavor, everyone loved it! I had another crust on here that I used and loved (and will still use) but I wanted to try this one also. It’s equally as fabulous. I’m really glad I tried this one. Thanks to the submitter of this recipe, for sharing it!

I was a bit surprised at how much more difficult it was to transfer the dough to pie crust but after struggling to get it in the bottom part, I just rolled the top over the rolling pin to transfer the top. This is not your grandma's pie crust but very tasty,  nice and crumbly.  Now that I know what to expect, will definitely make it again.

I make this AS IS for my pie crust.  It makes a sweeter but oh so flaky crust.  I used it primarily for apple pie and Dutch apple pies.  Have also used it for a quiche base.  It is easy to work with and forgiving.  The recipe is generous.

My daughter requests pies for her "birthday-cake" This March I baked a Triple Berry Pie with this crust... Tender, flaky, lovely texture.
Excellent  pie crust... 
The only thing I changed was to add a bit of sugar...for fruit/sweet pies. 
Absolute Favorite... My daughter  studied at French Pastry School...and she agreed... Best pie crust EVER...

Substituted butter for the shortening (shredded frozen Irish butter). Made the dough in my food processor and was worried there wouldn't be flecks of butter (there weren't). But, the crust came out flaky and buttery and yummy anyway. My son approves! Used this crust with the apple by grandma Ople recipe, and it was a hit!

Lovely crust. Easy to put together and roll out. I use 2 pieces of floured parchment paper to roll out the crust. Also, if you substitute butter for the shortening make sure to cut the salt. Wonderfully flaky crust with just the right sweetness. Perfect.

The best pie crust I've made so far. The only change I made, was that I used lard instead of shortening. It's very hard to work with. (The crust) But worth the effort. I took the advice of others and put the dough in a ziplock bag to press it together. When I rolled it out I rolled it out on seran wrap, then turned it upside down on the pie plate and peeled it of. Super flaky crust, I loved it!

Best crust I have tried and made!! Because I love using cake flour in apple pie crusts, I used one cup cake flour and one all-purpose - it was perfection!! I am going to use this recipe as is for a cherry pie soon and I  bet it'll be just as good!!

Substituted lard for shortening , but the ratios of flour/fat/liquid here are perfect.   A very easy to work with dough.   It seems the egg makes this crust sturdier though perhaps a bit less flaky than other pastry recipes.  Would probably be very good for a meat pie.

Flaky, yet firm, my new favorite pie crust! I did not have shortening on hand so I used country crock (don’t laugh - it worked - haha). It’s delicious and easy to work with. I used my food processor and it was the easiest crust ever. A definite keeper.

Made it in the food processor. Pulsed off and on for about a minute give or take. Popped  it in the fridge for 10 minutes then rolled it out and put it in the pie pan. For CREAM PIE - Blind bake at 425° with aluminum foil & dry beans (to hold its shape) for 12 minutes. Removed the beans/foil and baked for another 15 minutes until golden. Brushed on egg wash and baked for another 3 minutes. Pop in the freezer for another 10 minutes to cool before adding cream pie filling. Perfection! Thank you!

I made this crust using Smart Balance (the version you can bake with) rather than butter. Smart Balance has more water in it so after I refrigerated the dough I had to use extra flour before refrigerating and again while rolling it out.  We enjoyed the pie (Chef John's Peach Pie) and crust. Next time I make the crust I will use at least part of the specified amount of butter.

I thought this was flaky and very tasty.  I will use it again. It makes 2 9" crusts. I did freeze half of it for later use and found that the piece I froze when baking started to slide down the side of the pan so I'm not sure if I'd recommend freezing this dough.

Crust came out nuce and flaky with a good taste, however it was too dry for rolling, had to do a big patch job. Next time I would either add less flour, or more water.

Amazing. This is the only pie crust recipe I use now. It's the soulmate of Grandma Ople's apple pie recipe. It works great with pumpkin pie as well, and I've had success making it with gluten free flours as well.

First pie crust ever. Perfect with no substitutions. I used 5tbs water. It is very crumbly in the bowl. I wrapped it in plastic wrap, molded the dough into a ball, and rested it in the fridge for 15 minutes. This is enough dough for the bottom and top crust.

I have used this recipe for lots of years and it turns out every time. I sometimes use unsalted butter, butter Crisco, lard. I use this recipe for pot pies, fruit pies, savory pies. For savory pies, omit the sugar.  I also use a food processor for the dry ingredients and shortening and then mix in the wet.

My husband gave this a 10.  He isn't a crust person.  And he never gives anything a 10.  I do refrigerate over night.  And I do as one other reviewer said and that is to sift flour.  She also recommend shaving 1/2 cup of frozen butter in place of half of the lard.  I am going to try that next.  Since this review I started using 1 tble vinegar versus 1 tsp.  dough handles beautifully

I made the recipe exactly as written.  It turned out excellently - relatively easy to work with (a big plus for a pie crust novice like me), a good taste when cooked, and held up well to the filling of "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople".  It would be exactly the right amount for a 9" pie pan - mine was a 9.5" glass pie pan, so I didn't get a whole lot of edging on the crust.

I will echo the comments of others - you will almost certainly use the 5 Tbsp of water, so just plan on it, and even after that, it will seem a bit crumbly.  If you mold it with your hands though, it will ball up nicely, and will stay together after the chilling.

This is my favorite go to pie crust for about every pie I do. I like to swap out the shortening for coconut oil it adds a little something special to the recipe. Note: if you do make this swap let the dough rest in the fridge for a little longer the melting point of the coconut oil is lower so its harder to work with but well worth the extra effort..

This was quite good! I used butter instead of shortening and could have used less. I had to use much more water then the recipe stated. I made a savory pie with spinach, potatoes, orange bell pepper & marscapone cheese and it was a BIG hit!

This is perfect!  Even for me, who didn't really take the time to roll out a very thin crust, being in a hurry.  It was still flaky and tasty enough to eat all by itself.

This recipe is amazing!!! I will say that using a food processor made the recipe so easy that it was almost a joke.  I used butter flavor shortening and it came out awesome.  There was a few scraps left over and it was delicious uncooked.  I made Grandma Opal's apple pie with the crust.

When combining ingredients with a fork, it will seem very crumbly and doesn't do well at sticking together. Put it in plastic wrap then in the fridge, helps. Also,  let it warm up just a little when taking it back out of the fridge before you roll it out, but not so long as to let the shortening melt. When rolling, turn often to prevent it sticking to the counter.

Best recipe hands down. I got two crusts out of the batch, without top cover. It was extremely easy!   I used it for a chiffon pumpkin pie that was no cook. So I  put fork holes in the bottom of the crust and baked the piecrust for 20 minutes.  Once cooled I put the pumpkin mixture in and placed it in the refrigerator.  It came out perfect and got rave reviews.

This is the absolute best pie crust I've ever had. I use this recipe all the time for anything from cheesecakes, to pot pies, to fruit pies. It is just fantastic. For whatever reason my dough tends to be a little on the crumbly side when I make it. (The taste never suffers, it's just a little harder to work with). With trial and error I have found that adding a couple Tbsp of softened butter in addition to the shortening makes my dough easier to work with and gives it a nice golden color when baking. I also always use my hands to mix after the addition of the wet ingredients. This tends to give me better results. Wonderful recipe, I always get compliments on it.

I love to bake but I have never been able to totally "master" a pie crust. Something always goes wrong. We got our hands on a huge bunch of fresh picked farm cherries and I really could just taste a cherry pie - although I feared my usual crust failure. I took a stab at this, I chilled lard, and used a farm fresh egg from one of my lovely chooks. This was the BEST pie our family has ever eaten, at least made by me and not Marie Calendar. :)  I would have never thought you could get a crust like this without butter. I was afraid of the vinegar too, but it is magic. I was careful to barely work the dough together, I put the crust back in the fridge for a while before baking my beautiful cherry pie. MMMMMMMMM I can still smell that baking in the oven!! yum. A KEEPER!!

I usually have bad luck with crust, but this was so good and easy to work with. The only thing I did different was use butter flavored shortening and I added more water then what it called for. It did tend to brown on the edges rather quickly, but I just put foil around it. In the end it was amazing....I will always use this pie crust!! Thank-you for sharing.

I am SUPER picky about pie crust. I usually eat around it. This crust is amazing! Super flaky and cooks up so nice!!! I can't say how happy I am to have it. I couldn't get it to ball up so I left it crumbly and put it in the fridge for 10+ min while I prepped my pie. When I took it out I squished it and rolled it out. Worked great!!

I have never been fond of a two-crust pie, mainly because I've never really liked the crusts. That has changed with this crust! I made it exactly like the recipe stated, and it was wonderful! I used it for a black raspberry pie and got rave reviews.  It will definitely be my go to pie crust from now on. Thanks for sharing the recipe, and thanks to the person who shared the plastic bag tip.  It made rolling, placing and cleaning up a snap!

Wow, great crust. Light , flaky and  easy.  I wanted it for a pot pie so cut the sugar down to 1 tsp and it was perfect!  It definitely makes enough for a double crust pie.

Turned out great! Didn't have to use all of the egg, water, vinegar mix in fact I used very little of it. Instead of making an entire pie, I used a muffin pan and made tartlets. I am a chef but I am a horrible baker. Rave reviews *****

This is a GREAT recipe.  I'm only an amateur when it comes to baking but I wanted to try making pie and this crust was so easy for me to make.  After coming out the crust was nice and flaky and I made egg custard pie with it.  I shared it with my friends and they LOVED it.

Loved this! At first I was concerned I wouldn't be able to roll it out properly because it was so sticky but after being put in the fridge it was like a different dough. It was wonderful to work with and baked up light and flaky. This recipe is a definite keeper!

The crust tasted ok but it was horrible to roll out. The dough crumbled while rolling.  I had to keep add water too it in addition to what the recipe called for, kneading it in at the last minute to keep it from cracking as I rolled it. Defiantly better for a fruit or meat pie then a custard recipe.

Excellent.  Light.  Flaky.  Liked it just as much as the filling.  I did 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups white. I used ice cold water and added it a tablespoon at a time.  I think it took me more than 5 TB of water.  After making it, I cut it in half, and wrapped each half in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.  When I took it out, I rolled it out between two sheets of plastic wrap and it worked like a charm.

I goofed and dumped all the water in at once. BIG mistake that I had to spend all my time attempting to correct. I pulsed the flour and shortening and salt in my processor a few times. Be careful not to do it too much or you'll liquify the mix. The water needs to be added by hand versus the food processor. I put the dough in cling wrap in the frig before rolling. I rolled it out between two sheets of cling wrap for ease of handling. 

The good news is it made a nice pot pie crust and my husband thought I was a genius. I will try again and add water a tablespoon at a time and re-review.

The taste was phenomenal ! It was like eating my favorite apple pie out of a giant sweedish butter cookie. I got it to work but find the dough hard to work with . When it was too cold it cracked. When it was too warm it was way too soft. I always use iced pure grain in my pie crust and they are tender and flakey . I like the method (if you havent tried give it a shot) but is the alcohol the problem ? How critical is the measure of the use of water?
what are the downsides of too much  water

Perfect every time.  I don't make pies very often, so when I do I need a basic, easy, no fail recipe for crust.  Not only does this one give me that, but I also get compliments on it every time!

Yum, this was amazing, I'll definitely make it again, I used it for an apple pie and used half shortening and half butter for the fats. My usual recipe is just as yummy but more difficult to roll out and has more shrinkage. This will be my new go-to pie crust recipe. Thanks!!!

Attempted to make this but failed in doing so. I still plan on doing this one as it sounds like one of the best. I have to blame myself for failing. Guess thats what happens when your a novice.

Fantastic pie crust! Flavor is better than any pie crust you'll get at the grocery store. Watch the edges while baking because they can burn.

This is my first time making a pastry crust from scratch and it turned out great! It was a little dense, but with more practice, I'll get it down. I used butter instead of shortening, but I didn't change anything else. It baked very nicely on my fruit tart. This recipe is not at all difficult, and would work great on any kind of tart or fruit pie. If you take the sugar out, it would probably be good for a pot pie, too. I'm making this my go-to crust from now on.

This was an amazing recipe!! I used it to make a pastry-like dessert empanada and it turned out to be the perfect match for what I was going for! I had to add a little extra flour after mixing in the wet ingredients but, regardless, it turned out fabulous. This recipe is a keeper. Happy cooking!!

Made this yesterday to use with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie (recipe this site).  Everyone loved the crust maybe even more than the pie!  Can't wait to try it with Pumpkin pie recipe for the holidays.  Very easy to make and I don't have a food processor.  I did have to had about 2 add'l tablespoons of "cold" water to dough to get it to form ball.  The trick is to add a little at a time and not pour the liquid in all at once.  You learn to see and feel the right texture needed with practice.  I have made many a pie crust using different recipes.  I also have tried different methods of rolling pie dough (wax paper, plastic wrap, wooden pastry board, silicon mat)  The plastic wrap is the easiest and least messy I think.   I will continue to use this recipe for fruit pies.  DON'T BE AFRAID.  It really is easy!

The last time I attempted pie crust was 6 years ago and it was because it was a bonafide disaster. Apparently I was just using the wrong recipe. This was perfect to go with the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople recipe. There wasn't one leftover crumb on my guests' plates!

This is the best sweet pastry recipe ever. I used butter instead of shortening and the texture and flakiness was just out of this world. It also helped using the food processor.

I have tried many crust recipes and this one is SUPERB!  No other crust like it!  Easy to make, easy to roll; just used two pieces wax paper and a lil flour.  Exceptional taste too!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Thank you for an excellent pie crust recipe! Making a pie crust from scratch is often a daunting task, especially for the inexperienced (like me). This one couldn't have been simpler. The only change I made was to use butter-flavor shortening. Terrific!

Tried this crust recipe with a fresh blueberry filling. Amazingly flavorful. Who knew one egg and a bit of vinegar would make such a difference?

The dough was easy to work with and it browned perfectly. However the vinegar left a funny smell to the pie and altered the flavor. I wonder if lemon juice would be a substitute?

this is my crust of choice from now on!  it was easy and perfect, even with the very juicy apple pie i made.  unlike others it took a long time for mine to brown at my slow apple cooking pie temp, so i just brushed it with a little milk wash and it looked perfect!

The crust was wonderful. It was tender, slightly sweet (but not over powering), and crisp. My Grandma who has baked pies for years, loved the crust. When I told her the ingredients, she couldn't believe I used vinegar and sugar. I've never made a pie crust before, so I wasn't entirely sure what the consistency should be. I used all 5 TBSP water, and it turned out perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again.

My first pie crust, instructions were flawless. The crust is rich with flavor, just so amazing in so many ways. I used a Peach Surprise ( recipe on this site ) as the filling, and it all really tied together great. Highly recommended.

Wow, I'm a believer. This was a cinch. You know you've got something good when a man goes "the crust is perfectly flaky" and it cooked to a lovely golden brown even without the egg/milk wash that I forgot to do.

I used store-bought pie crusts for years because I thought it was too much trouble and not enough improvement to bother. But this recipe changed my mind. It's absolutely wonderful. I have friends who rave about it and can't wait for the next pie.

This crust is by far the best that I've ever had! I made an apple pie and served it at Thanksgiving. I had so many people just want to eat the crust. I do have to admit, I used unsalted butter instead of 1c. of shortening.

I have been afaid to try crust after a few disasters, but this was so easy. I used the plastic wrap method to roll out, I just can't believe how easy it was, no flour mess, even the lattice work was easier than I thought. Just a great crust.

I adore this pie crust recipes - its the only one I use for desserts. Its very easy to make (I always use my food processor) and very easy to work with. And on top of that tastes delicious. Its a keeper for sure. For someone stepping out into the world of homemade crusts I highly highly suggest this one.

Made this for the first time along with the allrecipies Blackberry/Peach Pie.  Took it to a party and it was decimated---great!  Nice and flaky, not dry.

Made this last nite and put it in the refig and left the house and came back an hour later dough was very soft and easy to manage. Needed only a pinch of flour to roll it out very easy to roll. Nice color and very tasteful. This is so far the best pie crust. I did a chess pie with this crust. NICE!!!! I forgot to mention,that I used butter instead of shortening.

of all the crusts I have tried to make, they've all ended up in the garbage with a few bad words, but after chilling (I chilled my marble roller too) this rolled well, transfered well and baked well! Needless to say the family is very happy now. I have used this crust for a cherry blueberry pie and it held up to the pie goo amazingly after a day. I have also used this crust for a beef pot pie. Great! Not too sweet at all! Needless to say, this recipe is a keeper! Thank you TJ

This crust is great.  I've tried a lot of crusts but this crust was great.  I loved the ease of making this crust and the fact that it only needs to rest for 10 minutes before you move on with the process.   I used this to make a peach pie. I didn't pre-bake the bottom but brushed it with a beaten egg before adding the filling and it stayed flakey during the baking process.  I also brushed the top with a beaten egg and it came out shiny and browned to perfection. I will add this to my arsenal of recipes and will definitely use it again.

Excellent crust. My 88 year old mother told me before she took a bite, how much she liked a flaky crust and how hard it was to achieve....well, she was amazed, and loved the pie! Thanks!

I decided to make my own crust because I couldn't find any at the frozen section at our local store. I am so glad I made that decision because this is the best pie crust - together with grandma ople's apple pie recipe, this was a match made in heaven. I will always use this pie crust from now on.

This is my new pie crust, I just loved it!  It was easy to put together, easy to roll and made 3 crusts (I only did bottom crusts, so I was able to make 3 pies).  It turned out flakey and thick, not mushy at all.  It does shrink a little on the sides during baking.  I did pre bake it for about 10 minutes first, and I did use the other suggestion of cold shortening and ice cold water and only 1tsp of salt.

Thank you for this pie crust, I will definitely use again!!

This recipe has just replaced the one I used to use. I loved this crust and the texture! It was so nice and flakey with a great taste. Next time I will cut back on the salt by 1/2tsp. I used this for an apple pie. It cooked great, I did cover the edges with foil as I always do to prevent burning. I used shortening that had been in the freezer (it doesn't freeze solid but it helps for that flakey crust) and ICE water. Perfect crust! Thank you!

Thsi is the best pie crust. I used it for apple pie and it was prefect. Can make ahead of time and roll out next day. A bit hard but it does work when it warms up. I use real butter unsalted.

All I can say is OMG!! This is totally superb. The taste is outstanding!!! I just baked my second apple pie. This pie crust was way better than my first. The only ever so slight change I did was use both butter and shortening and I kept my dough in the fridge for an hour. I recommend this recipe to anyone wanting the perfect and tasty pie crust. This will be my crust for years to come.

This is exactly the recipe I used for years and lost.  The key to it is cold, ice water and to put the bowl in the freezer for a few minutes before rolling out and again before rolling out the top.  I also decreased the salt to 1 tsp. and I use lard as it makes it flaky.  I top it off with a little milk and sugar.  Great recipe.

Great and EASY recipe. Instead of the 3 tbs. of white sugar, I added 6 tbs. of DARK brown sugar. It turned out perfect for the fresh peach pie I was making and the b. sugar really gave it a wonderful, deep, flavor.

This dough was so easy to work with and roll out, and it had a wonderful flavor, but it was not as tender and flaky as my old standard Betty Crocker recipe. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, and I loved the addition of sugar to the mixture. The recipe made a generous 2 crusts, and I used then for Honey Crunch Pecan Pie (from this site) and Libby's pumpkin pie recipe--everyone loved both pies!

Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  I used all 5 tbls of water and added a drop of vanilla extract to the liquids.  I do not usually like crust but I ate this one.  :)

I love this recipe! I've successfully used it numerous times and have never been disappointed.  I've also frozen it when I only need crust and it was still good when I defrosted it for another use.

This recipe was fantastic.  It was really easy and turned out so well! Since I was using it for sweet pies, I reduced the salt and used almond extract instead of vinegar.

Very good pie crust.  Turns out flaky and tender.   This crust is a sweet crust so it goes well with fruit.

I do not like to make pie crust, however, I tried this one and it was the easiest and tastiest ever.  I will use it again instead of buying a ready made crust.

I want something that's more a sweet and flavorful crust. But, for what this is, it's great. I didn't even put it in the fridge the whole time. I let it cool in the freezer while I prepared my apple pie. Turned out great and very easy. My first time baking a pie and it was a success!!!

This recipe is fantastic!  Although I always have a little trouble with my crust topping, it keeps turning out a little too hard.  I think I am overworking it, but I don't know what to do.  I also modified this recipe a little, I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  It was delicious with my homemade apple pie recipe using apricot preserves.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe I will continue to use it.

This is a great crust. I even doubled it and it worked great. I would only use for pies not for pasties or turn overs.

Taste very good, I had to use a bit more water than called for, but, I live in a high mountain desert at 4300 ft and it is 100 degrees today with very little moisture in the air. So everything dries up fast here.  Outside of that it was great.

I got RAVE reviews on this crust..the pie I made was good too but all everybody talked about was the crust!  I was so busy cooking Easter dinner I forgot to follow to follow the directions until I had all the ingredients dumped in the bowl! Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend that method I mixed it all together and it still came out great!!  I didn't make any changes!
