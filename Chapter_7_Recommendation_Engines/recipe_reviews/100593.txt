The flavor of the dressing in this recipe is just delicious!  I did have to make small adjustments based on what I had on hand - no garlic-chili sauce so I just used 2 cloves of garlic and a tiny bit more red pepper flakes, warm water in place of the chicken broth and no salt, as the soy sauce added enough saltiness for my tastes.  I added about 1/2 tsp. toasted sesame oil and omitted the chicken (will add some leftover from tomorrow night's dinner) and added broccoli and snow peas.  A squeeze of lime and this is a perfectly seasoned dish - my only problem is the amount of dressing.  I only used half the pasta (whole wheat) since I wanted more veggies, and I feel it could use just a little more of this yummy sauce. Next time I will increase that part of the recipe by half and this dish will be perfection in my book.

Tasty and easy to prepare, this dish reminded us of our favorite Thai restaurant's peanut dressing. I added fresh minced garlic and Thai sweet red chili sauce to the recipe since I did not have garlic-chili sauce. You don't need a food processor for this recipe if you simply warm the soy sauce and chicken broth in the microwave first, which helps to melt the peanut butter. Just whisk them together until smooth. You can therefore make the sauce right in the serving bowl, making clean-up so much faster! I also added some stir-fried broccoli to this dish and next time I might also try water chesnuts for added crunch. Delicious. A definite make-again--next week!

Hello everyone! I loved this recipe. I have to be honest though...when I first read the directions I was so excited to make it for my hubby! But when I started to mix it all together I had second thoughts. Turns out at the end it was excellent. My husband and I enjoyed it he even had a 2nd helping. I'm proud to be the first to rate this delicious recipe. BUT I DID MAKE SOME CHANGES sorry... I didn't change anything as far as the ingredients and how much you use. However rather than just pouring the sauce over the cooked chicken and pasta at the very end i cook the chicken then add the veggies until they soften just a little, then i add the sauce i made in the blender. I let the sauce cook for maybee a minute or so and then pour over the noodles.  Also I don't add the cilantro till the very end. It looses flavor if you cook it.

This recipe is delicious. As many others have mentioned, it is important to double the dressing. If you didn't double the dressing it would be too dry.

Wow - this is really good.  My husband really likes spicy so I upped the chili garlic paste.  I doubled the sauce the second time I made this just because he loved it so much and I had added additional veggies.  Water chestnuts, more celery, red bell pepper and cucumbers.  This salad is perfect for pot lucks or picnics - it is awesome at room temp.  Add more broth to the sauce to acheive your desired thickness.  If you have a stick blender  - use it for the sauce, it blends it in a snap.

Wonderfully flavorful.  A different option that will spice up your routine, but that even the pickiest eaters at your table will have fun with.  My kids LOVED it.  One change: rather than using canned chicken broth, I saved the water I boiled the chicken in and used that.  Healthier and cheaper.

Great tasting recipe!  Number of servings overestimated and I'd say could use a little more dressing (I put some water in to make it go further).  Still, I've had this a few times now and will continue to make it.  It's also so convenient since it can be eaten hot or at room temperature.

I love to make Oriental dishes and my husband said by far the best I have ever made!  It was delicious!  Instead of fresh veggies, I used a frozen Asian blend with sugar snaps, red peppers, little corn, edamame, and water chestnuts. I sauteed for a few minutes then threw it all together and mixed.  Yum!

This was delicious! I recommend letting the flavors combine for a few hours before serving. This was one of those dishes that was even better the next day.

I made this recipe last night almost as written. I used specific name brand ingredients as listed, however, I changed the linguine to Ronzoni "Garden Delight" Enriched Carrot, Tomato & Spinach Spaghetti and it was remarkable. I changed the red bell pepper to a half jar of drained Mezzetta Deli-Sliced Roasted Red Bell Pepper strips. Yum! And most importantly, I made this salad 3 hours before dinner and refrigerated it. When the pasta finished cooking, I drained it and tossed with 2 ounces of Cilantro-Onion olive oil to prevent sticking, placed in a sealable bowl and chilled it. The vegetable ingredients were chopped added to a large bowl and chilled. I grilled the chicken breasts inside on a panini grill and chilled. When ready to serve I combined all ingredients and it came out marvelous, worthy of 10 stars if I could go that high. Thank you for sharing this recipe Sherbg. It is definately a keeper!! Andy

We absoultely LOVE this at our house. The kids, not so much due to the spiciness. We always use shrimp instead of the chicken. Wonderful recipe!

Really yummy. After reading the reviews, I doubled the dressing, but think I could have gotten away with making 1.5 times. I also left out the celery and added green pepper. I preferred it hot, but hubby liked it better served cold, so it can go either way. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one super recipe. My family all devour it whenever I make it. I did tweak a little by using toasted mixed seeds and slivered almonds instead of the peanuts. I also doubled the dressing and it was superb.

This was a great dish. Instead of making it into a main meal, I left out the chicken and served it as a side to grilled asian chicken that I already had marinating for Chinese New Year. I added extra carrots and bell pepper to boost the veggie content, and left out the roasted peanut garnish to help lower the calories and fat. I plan on making it again soon with the chicken in the salad and serving it as the main course next time. Definitely a keeper in our house.

Dressing is awesome will use in Asian salads.  I agree with everyone else, double the recipe for the dressing.  This will become a family fav.

Yep, this one deserves 5 stars.  I found the dressing amount to be just right, but I can see that others may want to increase it, just cause it's soooo yummy.  You can easily switch the types of veggies and/or meats and still create an awesome salad!  Thanks for this one :)

Delicious! I made just a little bit more sauce to make it saucier and left out the ginger since I didn't have any. This is going to be a perfect summer pasta salad! I might even try to adapt it as a warm dish too.

I thought this was very good.  I used vacuum sealed fresh udon noodles instead of pasta.  I felt like it was missing something so I  doubled the Asian garlic-chili  sauce.(I found a similar recipe that asked for 2 TBSPs of the sauce and decided to try it.)  But I still thought it needed something else so I ended up adding a few drops of sesame oil to the noodles.  Then I thought it was perfect.  So did my husband.

I made this for a housewarming BBQ and it was among the favorite items on the table. (if not the favorite)  I did spice up the dressing with some Rooster Sauce, topped the bowl with a nice portion of bean sprouts and served it with lime wedges.  Phad Thai esque version I guess.

I loved this recipe!  I actually tripled the dressing amount and added lime juice instead of broth and more hot pepper flakes.  The leftover dressing was great on tossed salad.

I thought this was a great cold salad.  I accidentally made a little too spicy by using the Thai Chili/Garlic paste instead of the sauce that the recipe calls for.  I did like the effect it had.  I doubled the sauce like a few other reviewers suggested and glad I did.  Added sugar snap peas.  Ate the salad cold and was still good and not too dry after 3 days.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe ROCKS!!!.....The flavors are wonderfully close to a resturants version we recently enjoyed. We made this as a hot  dish served individually. Starting with the sauce, we doubled and heated all the ingredients in a sauce pan. Cooked the chicken and cut into strips seperate into 4 servings. Cooked the pasta al dente saving some of the pasta water, and setting it aside. In a skillet, add a small amount of the pasta water, handfuls of peanuts, shredded carrots, beans sprouts, and green onions. cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken, cook for another minute. Add desired amount of pasta for a single serving and peanut sauce. Toss in the skillet long enough to coat all with sauce. Top with cilantro and enjoy!!!

Delicious.. I used yam noodles instead of linguine, broccoli instead of red peppers and  used a light peanut butter product. I tried it warm first and then cold and IMHO cold was much tastier. The chili garlic sauce really works in this

This was a bit too spicy for me, but my husband loved it!  I doubled the sauce so that I'd have extra, but reduced the red pepper flakes by half and only used two green onions to suit my preferences.  I also used chunky peanut butter because that's what I had on hand.  I added leftover sliced sirloin, plus asparagus and carrots, which made a nice combination.  I used regular sodium soy sauce and regular sodium chicken broth because that's what I had on hand, but that made it too salty, IMO.  It would be better with low sodium versions of the soy sauce and chicken broth.  I'd strongly recommend combining these ingredients in a blender rather than a food processor, especially if you're doubling the sauce, or else you'll end up with a mess.

I am not sure what I did wrong with this recipe...I followed it to a T and it came out way too salty and completely inedible!  I ended up adding about 3/4 cup of water, tripled the peanut butter and added some white vinegar.  In the end it was edible - but still way to salty.  I used light soy sauce (as opposed to dark) as the light is way less potent.  However I still think the culprit may have been the soy sauce.  Has anyone else had this problem?  If so please let me know.

Fabulous, spicy sauce that can be used on noodles, meats and vegetables.  Harmonious blend of flavors! I processed the wet ingredients along with a cup of cilantro, half of a yellow onion and juice from 2 Meyer lemons to the dressing.  Definitely a must try recipe!

I really liked this.  My husband did not, but the kids did!  Don't know what to make of that.  I didn't have some ingredients, like the garlic-chili sauce and the rice vinegar, but I made some substitutions, with some help from Google.  I thought it turned out great and I was tempted to sip on the sauce.  I added peas and I didn't add the peppers.  I think you could mix it up however you like and it would be great.  Thanks for this!

This dish was a huge hit with my family. Made this during the day for dinner that evening using Ramen noodles. Added in lots more vegies including broccoli, fresh green beans and grean and red bell peppers. Hubby wanted to have it cold and my oldest daughter preferred it heated up. Next time, however, I'll double the dressing. Healthy and very easy dish to throw together especially if using left over chicken. Thank you so much!!

I thought this recipe was awesome.  I added a little extra chili sauce to sauce and probably used about 8 tbsp of chicken broth to get the right thickness.
I also cooked chicken at the same time (so it was all hot) - cut into bit size strips and cooked in wok with some chili oil, salt, pepper and rosemary.  The sauce was amazing and it was a great meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious with a wonderful blend of flavors. I did double the sauce too, and added a bit more veggies. Next time I'll make it without the meat . Just my preference.

I wasn't to impressed with how this turned out. The only thing I changed was the type of noodles. I used Wacky Mac instead of linguine. The flavors just didn't blend well in my opinion. I have a feeling this is going to take a long time to finish even with 3 growing boys in the house.

I made this last night.  I read the reviews and went ahead and doubled the dressing.  I used Srircha sauce and 1 clove of garlic. This sauce gives the dish a little kick.  If you aren't into heat then cut the srircha in half. I will make this again. The roasted peanuts give this dish the taste that it needs.

VERY good taste, whole fam of 5 loved it - I doubled the sauce as recommended by others (which was perfect amount of sauce) but didn't double the Asian garlic chile...and didn't put in the red pepper flakes, I was a little nervous about the amount of heat. Glad I did what I did - it was a little hot for the meek- but tolerable...perfect for those who like a good kick. Older 2 daughters fighting over who gets to take to school for lunch tomorrow! :)

I took this to party today and it went over very well.  I did cut back on the red pepper flakes since there was kids at the party and not everyone likees heat.  I did find it a bit too "salty/soy saucy" so I did add probably double the broth and it was great.  I also doubled the sauce as suggested and then tossed it with about 3/4 of the sauce and put the rest in a small bowel next to it for those that wanted more.  I did sprinkle with chopped peanuts, but also put a small bowel with extra for those that wanted to sprinkle more on.  Great recipe and I can easily see using the dressing on chicken or other things as others have suggested.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

The SAUCE is superb! I like mine spicy so i make it just like the recipe states for my family, and serve garlic chili sauce on the side.   VERY EASY Reipce!!! I have done this several times. Sometimes I leave the veggies raw, sometimes i saute them for a few minutes in canola or sesame oil.  Serve with crushed peanuts! WOW!

I'm so happy I tried this recipe. I've been looking for a gingery-peanutty dressing that's like what they serve at my favorite local Japanese restuarant. This wasn't it, but it was very close! I'll definately make it again, but will cut back on the heat.

So good!  Would have been even better with fresh ginger.  I tried it once with Vidalia onions instead of green onions.  Definitely need the green onions.  Also made double batch of dressing and kept in fridge for next time.

A great way to use up leftover spaghetti, and even better the next day than when I served it. I found the amount of dressing to be fine, although I'm not sure exactly how much spaghetti I used.

This was so good! I was looking for a recipe to use up some extra ingredients I had left over from the Asian Roll Lettuce Wraps recipe I found on this site and found this one. I used only half the noodles the recipe called for and didn't have the garlic-chili sauce so I used minced garlic instead. I also subbed cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes since it is what I had on hand.

I love this recipe because the dressing doesn't have a dominant peanut butter flavor. You can taste all of the other seasonings. I didn't have the garlic-chili sauce, so I used fresh garlic instead and a little red hot sauce for kick. I also substituted tofu for chicken. It's a great meal warm or chilled!

I made this without the chicken as a side for some pork tenderloin.  it was very good i loved it I added just a touch of seasame oil and one minced tooth of garlic to give it a little boost, and I added about 1 tblsp of water cause it was a little thick.  i will definetly make it again.

This recipe was okay. My husband didn't really like it and I thought it was expensive. I had to buy a lot of things I don't usually keep on hand. That would have been all right if it was really great but it was just okay. I probably won't make it again.

Made as written except that I didn't have the garlic chili sauce or the fresh ginger.  I used minced garlic and extra red pepper flakes and ground ginger.  It was very good.  I wouldn't call it a salad though, it's more like a side/main dish.  Maybe if the vegetables are cut larger, it would be more like a true salad.  At any rate, it was very good when eaten slightly warm.

My family went back for seconds so this is a keeper! Next time I will make a little more of the dressing (we like dishes that are a little more saucy) and probably add a little more chicken. But overall a tasty dish!

Absolutely loved it! I used a splash of sriracha, we like spicy peanut sauce and will make this again in the very near future.

This sounds delicious. I can't rate it as I havent made it yet.  I want to make this for a family Picnic, and feel a short pasta in place of the Linguine would serve up 
better for 12 to 14 people, of course I would double everything 
to make enough for 14 servubgs ?  Has anyone tried replacing 
the Linguine for a short type of Pasta?

This dish grows on you the more you eat. I loved having something different on the table. It may have been the soy sauce I used but mine turned out very salty.

I would double the dressing, but also dilute it a bit.  Great salad! Will definitely make again! I added more veggies, a yellow pepper, extra carrots and water chesnuts for extra crunch. GREAT recipe!

I loved this recipe. It was pretty fast and easy. I made a few changes, but I do think the recipe as written would be great also. I added grilled chicken, onions and about a teaspoon of sesame oil. I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious!   I made the dressing per the recipe but without chili flakes so kids would eat it.  So glad I doubled to have on salad later in the week.   Definitely a keeper of a recipe!

This was VERY easy and tasty, however I did change some of the recipe. 
First of all, I doubled the ingredients in the dressing; I hate dry pasta. After I made the dressing as the recipe had written (except doubled), I tasted it and it was WAY too salty. So I added another tbsp. of brown sugar, another dose of red pepper flakes, another tsp. of chili garlic sauce, and 1 1/2 tbsp. of honey. This did the trick...the dressing was excellent!!
I added red peppers, green peppers, green onions, and julienned carrots, omitted the celery and cilantro, and it was awesome!! My husband took a bite before I put it in the fridge to chill, and I had fight him off because he loved it so much and didn't want to wait.
With the modifications, this may be the best Asian noodle salad I've ever had.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I left out the green onions and celery and it still had lots of flavor.  Great to have ready and chilled for a hot summer night.

I doubled the sauce on this, per some other reviews, but left out the red pepper flakes and dialed back the chili garlic sauce a little (I didn't want it to be overly spicy for our toddlers).  I left out the green onions and celery and used extra carrots and red pepper.  My husband said it was nice that the raw vegetables added some crunch and balanced out some of the heat in the sauce.  The kids were happy to eat the noodles and some carrots.  Also, this did not save well for leftovers - the chicken became super saturated with the sauce and the texture was not good.

This was delish!  I was tempted to lick my bowl it was so good ;)  I omitted the chicken stock as I didn't have any and just added water.  I also didn't add any chicken, so a vegetarian version I guess.  But next time I will add shrimp.

Excellent recipe!  I used less ginger and still could notice it a lot, I used different veggies, like water chestnuts, snap peas.... and served it with quinoa instead of pasta. Delicious

I thought this was a very flavorful and healthy dish.  Took others suggestions and doubled the dressing which was all absorbed by the noodles and the chicken.  Yummy!  However, DON'T DOUBLE THE CHILI-GARLIC SAUCE!  My mouth was on fire...but it hasn't stopped my husband and I from eating it.  I added some julienned cucumbers to help cool it off. Great for a crowd.  Will be making again with only 1 T of the chili-garlic sauce.

This is good!  I really like the taste of the peanut sauce, even though I had to make do without the garlic-chili sauce.  I omitted the celery since I don't like it but next time I think I'll add some seeded, diced cucumber in place of it.  I think this would be just fine without the chicken, too.  I like to make a batch of this on Sunday nights to take in for lunches at work throughout the week.  Thanks for the post!

This was wonderful!  We eased up on the spice just a little so it was safe for everyone and then those who like it hot put a little more chili sauce on theirs.  We did double the sauce as others suggested but didn't use quite all of it when doubled.  This was a wonderful fresh tasting meal.  It is really good with just a little lime juice squeezed over the top to brighten it up too!

Followed recipe exactly. Recipe good, but may  need some tweaking for personal taste. The sauce thickened incredibly once added to the pasta salad and the peanut flavor overwhelmed any of the other flavorful ingredients.  My husband liked it but thought it tasted too much like eating peanut butter mixed with hot pepper flakes. If I make it again I  will either reduce the peanut butter or increase the other ingredients and will thin out the sauce more with way more chicken broth and maybe add some vinegar to brighten the flavor a bit.  I'm going to use only about 1/4 the pasta and serve it on a bed of crisp cold salad greens with sprinkles of rice noodles on top.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was excellent. Used less chili garlic sauce, 1 tsp., because all I could find was a chili garlic paste instead of sauce. Did not add the red pepper flakes and used some powdered ginger instead of fresh.  Will be making this and packing it for lunches often.

This was really great.  Hubby and both my boys really gobbled this down.  Plan on using the sauce for a lot more, stir-fry for example.  I used penne noodles because that is what I had on hand and it worked just fine.

I used this recipe for the dressing and I was pleasantly surprised at how much it tasted like the dressing at restaurants.  I had lots left over so I halved the salad (as many suggested was a better proportion) and was pleasantly surprised at how good that was too!  I'll definitely be making this again.

I was looking for an Asian-inspired dressing for a green salad I made with lettuce, carrots, cukes, kohlrabi, fried onions, cashews, and grilled teriyaki chicken. This dressing was perfect!  I cannot wait to try making chicken satay skewers and dipping them in this sauce. I liked the spice level too, with the chili-garlic sauce! I have made peanut sauce before with pretty good results, but I will keep this recipe at hand from now on. Great job!

We loved this!  I substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar, but that's the only change I made.  We also ate it hot (I stir fried the veggies and warmed the dressing in the micro).  It was delicious!!!  Will make again and again!
OK, I made it again for a luncheon, and served it cold.  I made it the day before and it did get a little dry in the frig so I spruced it up with a little italian salad dressing.   This worked perfectly, everyone loved it!
