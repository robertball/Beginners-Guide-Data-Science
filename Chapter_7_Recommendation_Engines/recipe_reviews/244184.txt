Easy and delicious. I didn't have coconut extract, so I used almond extract, and it tasted like the Thai sticky rice from my favorite restaurant (but so much easier to make)!

My family said this was just ok. They prefer traditional rice pudding with a sprinkle of cinnamon. I guess I wouldn't be making this again since no one would eat it and I wound up throwing it out.

I've made this recipe a few times and has turned out well each time. I always omit the coconut oil and use butter instead. I skip the extract as well, not totally necessary but Im sure would improve the flavor. I normally omit the sugar as well, I just don't think it needs it. I have doubled this recipe for family dinners and it was great.

This is the only straight forward coconut milk recipe I could find online. Well done!

After adding cinnamon and raisins, this was the perfect rice pudding recipe I've been looking for! I used butter instead of coconut oil also, so delicious!

I didn't use the pineapple. I sprinkled it with fresh nutmeg, whipped cream, and ate it warm. Yumm
