I enjoyed this smoothie and how easy it was to make.  I made it exactly as written, including the optional 1 tsp of agave nectar.  This isn't a very sweet smoothie, so if you prefer sweeter, you'll likely need to add in more agave, or honey would be delicious too.  I used a very ripe banana, for added sweetness. I recommend putting the tofu in the blender first, otherwise having the fruit at the bottom makes it harder for the blender to get going.
