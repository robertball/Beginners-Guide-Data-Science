I should've followed my instincts more & the recipe less.  It was pretty good, but not worth the effort.   I subbed with ground turkey.  Added the egg & wondered why; had to add 1/4c breadcrumbs, but it wasn't enough.  Too soft so most fell apart   I couldn't get myself to put sage in Chicken Marsala, thank goodness.  The other reviewer not meatballing is a good idea.

I liked this recipe a lot. Made it the second time without forming into meatballs, just scramble frying the ground chicken. It is a nice quick dinner!
