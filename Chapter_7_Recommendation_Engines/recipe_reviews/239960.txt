Super simple and came out really yummy. Added orange juice instead of water, and added about 1/4 tsp. of all spice to it. Whisked it so it would mash it a little too.

This is the best way to cook cranberries. There is NO need to add orange, or lemon, or zest, or anything! KISS! (Keep It Simple Stupid) Don't mess with perfection!

Try boiling in orange juice instead of the water.  It's a delicious twist.

I used half white and half brown sugar. I also used the zest of one orange. Rather than waste the orange juice, I added the juice of the orange and water to make 1 cup. Delicious!

All I can say is the canned sauce was left in the dish and the girls were fighting over this fresh sauce. It was totally amazing!!! The only change was substituting  OJ for part of the water. Yummy

This has been the go to recipe for my family for 50 years, but its so simple not sure I call it a recipe LOL. Its a condiment that we use over turkey and dressing at thanksgiving. I especially like it over bread sage dressing that is savory and a little extra salty, the two make an great combo. I also use it over ice cream, and over pita meat and also mix it in cream cheese to make a spread.
Simple but so good!

I would add only  a 1/2 cup of sugar if you use orange juice, and zest and squeeze the same fresh orange for a wonderful orange cranberry sauce. 1/2 cup o sugar cuts down on needless sweet and calories and you can actually taste the cranberries. Wonderful natural sweet-tart!

Great and simple recipe. Two suggestions: 1. Rinse the cranberries before adding to the sugar water. 2. I usually make the night before if possible. Gives plenty of time to completely cool and thicken prior to serving.

Loved this recipe.  The only change I made was I added a couple of cinnamon sticks to the recipe while it simmered for 10 minutes.  Made the kitchen smell great and was wonderful in the cranberry sauce.

I used the orange juice instead of water and added ground ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. A little too sweet will make it with water next time but beautiful consistency

I left this in to boil slightly longer for less chunks.  It tastes great!  In hindsight I should have follwed the receipe for more chunks.  Still a simply great receipe.

I have made it the basic way, but I've also used orange juice instead of the water....delicious!  It adds another layer of flavor while still keeping it simple.
