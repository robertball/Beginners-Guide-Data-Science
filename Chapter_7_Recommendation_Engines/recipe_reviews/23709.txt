Exceptional! 
Make it healthier. Use whole wheat pasta, skip the bacon, pan saute the chicken in olive oil,  used reduced or low-fat feta, add extra tomatoes, throw in some mushrooms, squeeze in some fresh lemon juice and ... voilá -- you have a powerhouse of a meal. 
Eat up, both your health and belly will rejoice.

Delicious! If you do not like greek/mediterranean flavors (i.e tangy cheese and salty olives) this recipe is obviously not the choice for you. However, if you are like me and LOVE those flavors this recipe is a huge winner! My husband said it was just ok, but he prefers a richer type sauce with his pasta. The rest of the family loved this dish and I think the flavor combinations are perfect. Not too tangy, not too salty. I changed a few things only slightly. I used chopped kalamata olives and mixed it into the dish just before serving. I used 5 pieces of bacon and cooked them crisp and added them at the very end right before I added the olives. I sprinkled the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning then browned it in olive oil and not the bacon grease. I added about 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan and a sprinkling of fresh chopped Italian parsley just before serving.  After I drained the noodles, I tossed them with the sauce right in the sautee pan so the noodles really absorbed the flavor. A+ in my book, thanks for sharing!

Great blend of flavors, but the instructions don't seem too well thought out. Here's what I did:  1. Marinate chicken for an hour 2. Heat a large pot of water 3. In a large saucepan, add chicken, tomato, and rosemary, and simmer 20 minutes stirring occasionally (I also doubled the rosemary and added marjoram, paprika, and two cloves of crushed garlic) 4. After chicken has cooked for 10 minutes, turn up heat on large pot to bring water to a boil and add pasta 5. When chicken has cooked for 15 minutes, cook bacon (I used 4 slices and it didn't seem to be enough) and drain and crumble. 6. Set chicken on low and drain your pasta. 7. Add artichokes, olives, and bacon. Stir well and cook for about a minute. 8. Either plate the pasta and serve chicken on top or toss everything together and sprinkle feta on top.  My reasoning behind doing it this way is the bacon wouldn't stay crispy if simmered for 20 minutes after cooking, and the crunchiness adds a nice contrast in texture, and the same idea goes behind not cooking the feta, the coldness of it coming straight from the fridge contrasts the fact that the meal will be warm. I added some fresh grated Parmesan at the end, because I think pasta and Parm are synonymous.

This was awesome!!!  I definitely love the tangy side of it!  All I did was add more chicken and while cooking the chicken I threw in about 1/4 tsp of dill weed.  Perfect!  I WILL be making this again!

YUM! This was excellent. I used fresh tomatoes instead of the canned, used a 14 oz can of artichokes rather than the 6 oz suggested, and left out the olives because I didn't have any on hand. I also used 'bacon style' ham, which was awesome because it’s so low in fat and calories but still has a lot of flavour. I made this recipe late Monday night, ate half of it before bed, and finished it by Tuesday afternoon. Ridiculously easy, healthy and delicious! MMMM thank you Sara!

This recipe is to die for!  It is now one of my favorites to have.  The only thing that I changed in the recipe is that I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of canned artichoke hearts.  Soo YUMMY!

I don't normally leave reviews but I had to for this one. This was great!!! I had to make a few changed but this will be a regular part of my cooking line up. I used canned diced tomates that had onion and green pepper. I also didn't have rosemary so I used oregano. I don't eat pork so I used beef bacon. The bacon wasn't really needed though. I also added a little jar spagehtti sauce because it needed a little more liquid. I also added a tiny bit of sugar. This was great though. I was surprised how much I liked it. Next time, I'm going to use kalamata olives.

The whole family enjoys this dish. We have made it several times and none of it has gone to waste. We mixed it up a bit by adding a white wine lemon butter sauce to it but the original is good too.

I was really excited for this recipe... I love olives, artichokes, feta, etc...  I used canned stuff and it didn't turn out so great.  I was super disappointed.  Maybe it was an ingredient quality issue? I am not sure, but it was too many ingredients to try again.

Very good! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, added a little white wine, used fresh rosemary & turkey bacon, and switched the linguine for whole wheat spaghetti. All minor changes just to accomodate what I had on hand. Really tasty. Thanks :)

This was excellent. My boyfriend actually thought it was the best thing I ever made! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, turkey bacon and I added some chicken broth as well since I wanted more sauce. I will definitely make this again!

This was quite good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions to add garlic/onion and sauteed the chicken with them.  When I mixed the ingredients, I also added mushrooms, asparagus, Greek seasoning, some oregano, some pepper, a fresh tomato and some tomato sauce (instead of canned diced tomatoes).  I used about three times the amount of bacon and found it to be delicious.  Put some feta in the sauce, but also garnished with some more.  Served over spaghetti noodles since we had no linguine on hand.

Nice and easy.  I warned my husband that after reading the reviews it sounded like mixed opinions from the husbands.  He took one bite and said, "There's bacon in it! What's their problem!"

I modified this recipe a little. I added mushrooms, 1 15 ounce can tomato sauce, 2 tsp garlic and more feta. It turned out great.  My husband had seconds and still scrapped the plate clean! I plan on making this recipe a lot in the future. Thanks!

Yum! This was so simple and quick yet had tons of flavor. Basically followed all directions except took the advice of putting in bacon last - glad I did so it didn't get overlooked. Wasn't even sure about the bacon in with all the other ingredients but it worked. I even threw in a dash of balsamic but only because I think everything needs a dash of balsamic! Oh - and put the feta over the top at the end instead of put it in the sauce - liked it better that way. Very tasty - picky husband liked it after he picked out the olives! Great recipe - it's going in the rotation!

This recipe was easy to make and DELICIOUS.  We cooked the chicken in the same pot we cooked the bacon and it added even more flavor.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

HUGE hit in my family!  I agree with a prior reviewer:  if you don't like greek/mediterranean flavors, it's not worty trying/reviewing.  Delicious and easy to cater to your own tastes.  The combination of flavors is amazing. I do admit that I left out the bacon (sheer laziness about cooking it) but didn't miss it.  I also used kalamata olives because we happened to have them on hand.

This recipe has potential... all the ingredients are delicious.  It just wasn't very flavorful. I think the proportions were off for me. I'm going to try it again using more vegetables, maybe some fresh tomatoes, more bacon, more cheese.  The linguine absorbed a lot of the liquid so I will try spaghetti or angel hair next time.

I don't do bacon so I sauteed the chicken in sesame oil.  I had to add some flour to the tomato/chicken mixture to thicken it a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Delicious!!

Loved this recipe.  I used kalmata olives instead of black and had to substitute oregano for the rosemary.  Next time I would use just a bit more pasta.  Great dish all on its own.

This is a very flavorful, light pasta dish. We love feta so I added more feta, probably double or more. It will definitely be made again!

This is a great alternative to the traditional spaghetti and meat sauce.  I followed the recipe using 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs and thick cut bacon, cooked in the same pan with fresh rosemary.  When done, I cut the meat into chunks and put back in the pan with the remaining ingredients (substituting fresh tomatoes for the canned).  It was delicious.

This is an incredible dish.  The subtle flavors are amazing.  The only thing I changed is (taken from the second or third review) was I sauteed the chicken on olive oil first, before chopping up into cubes. And I add a sprinkling of fresh lemon juice towards the end. 

My daughter wants this as her next "birthday dish" it was that good.

Thank you for the recipe.  I made it just as written and it had a lot of flavor.  I got far more than 4 servings out of it also.

I was so excited to try this but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I almost think it would be better as a vegetarian dish and just leave out the chicken and bacon. I also think I'll give the tomatoes a quick pulse with the immersion blender next time.

Made some major changes: red onion, green pepper, no bacon, basil, oregano, kalamata olives and red pepper flakes.  Top with grated feta cheese and toasted pine nuts.

This is a quick and wonderful meal.  I've made it twice now and both times I omitted the bacon (didn't see where it would add flavor) as well as adding a second can of diced tomatoes.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I cooked the bacon and chicken together with some garlic and drained the grease before continuing. I added two cans of tomato to make it stretch a little further. Then I got scared that I had ruined the recipe, but after 20 mins at a simmer it had cooked down and wasn't so juicy. This was so very, very good!

I made this for dinner last night with a few changes - I added 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic and a small amount of red wine, I didn't have diced tomatoes to add, so I used a can of crushed tomates.  My husband & I enjoyed this dinner very much- will make again.

This pasta is great! My boyfriend rated it 4 1/2 stars. I added a can of sliced mushrooms, minced garlic, and sliced red onion. Fast, yummy, and pretty. We used fusilli pasta and marinated artichoke hearts, adding a bit of the marinade to the dish. I will make this again, for sure. I was hoping to start a Valentines Day tradition, but nevertheless, a great dish.

Fabulous! My wife and I prepared the dish for Valentines Day. It's a keeper and definitely one we'll use again. We added a tbsp. of minced garlic, and substituted crushed tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes. As usual, I made extra so that I had a couple of "extras" for my lunch. It freezes really well, and tasted great when "nuked" the following week.

This recipe was just ok for me... The only change I made to the original recipe was to add the bacon at the end. I think it would make a better cold pasta salad... but that's my taste. I think I'll try the leftovers cold.

This was just okay to me.  I'll say right away that I actually left out the chicken in this recipe since I was already having a chicken dish with this.  Next time, I'll be sure to add some because I don't think it turned out the same without it.  The bacon didn't really mix well with the feta, olives and rosemary by itself and would have probably been a lot better if I had put chicken in the mix. (I ended up giving my bacon to my oldest son) The only changes I made was to add some garlic powder to enhance the sauce's other flavors, and left out the artichoke hearts.  My boys loved this though, and asked me for seconds, which is rare unless they really like something, so kudos to the recipe.  I'll make this again, but like I said, next time, I'll definitely add the chicken.

I see a whole lotta tweaking going on with this recipe's ratings.  A wonderful recipe & one that I made exactly as stated the 1st time.  I loved the tangy salty twist to give a areal Greek flavor.  Tweak it to be Italian if you must, but we loved it as is.  I usually only use artichoke bottoms because not a fan of the leaves.  I had a can of' them way back in the cupboard so I used them up.   Hearts are better...yum.  Thanks, Sal!!!

What a delicious recipe! I left out the olives and used creamy goat cheese (rather than crumbly feta) that just melted right into the sauce.  My entire family just loved it - will be making this for a long time!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious recipe and quick to fix. DH is lactose intolerant, so I left out the cheese. I think it would be great with shrimp or scallops.

This was wonderful! I skipped the dried rosemary as it usually ends up being woody pieces in my dishes unless I crush it first. Instead, I sauted the chicken breast with Italian seasoning sprinkled on them to add the "herby" component. Thanks so much for the recipe! Next time I may try halved grape tomatoes as I think it would make for an even prettier presentation.

Excellent! The bacon does add a nice touch, especially to counterbalance the feta, so I don't suggest skipping it. I did, however, wipe most of the bacon grease out of the pan before adding the chicken. [I also added 1/2 diced onion with the bacon.] I used two fresh tomatoes instead of the canned ones, and I added some garlic and herbs. Since I'm not a big fan of olives and we were out of artichoke hearts, I skipped those and served this over spinach linguini. I would definitely recommend adding at least part of the feta to the sauce, as it gives a nice, creamy texture to the sauce without being overpowering. To echo other reviewers - wait until the very end to add the bacon back in or it'll lose its crunchiness. All in all, a great recipe.

What a pleasant surprise this dish was! I had my doubts, but once all put together, the array of flavors was wonderful! I did have to make a couple changes (which I hate to do for the first time) but I only had flavored tomatoes, so used 1 can balsalmic vinegar, basil & olive oil and 1 can garlic & onion. I had a pkg of Kraft Crumbles-Mediterranean style, so used those. We'll be keeping this recipe handy!! Thank you!

This was really good! The only change I made was to leave out the bacon (didnt feel it needed it) and I marinated the chicken in a oil/greek seasoning marinade overnight. I also added an extra can of tomatoes because we love a lot of sauce and I added extra artichoke, low-fat feta and olives too
Yum!! Simple and quick!! Thanks :)

This was SOOO flavorful!! I didn't have Feta so I just sprinkled parmesean on the top. I also added sun dried tomatoes. I will definitely make this again!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have the artichoke hearts, so added a bit more olive, chicken and bacon to compensate space-wise.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  It's fresh tasting and is sure to be impressive next time company comes.

I was a bit skeptical from the somewhat mixed reviews but I made this for a gathering and it was without a doubt very delicious.  Everyone went back for seconds and my friend's mom (who is from Greece) actually asked me for the recipe.  I used 8 slices of turkey bacon (which you could taste in the end) and did not add the bacon until the cheese, artichoke part. I also used Kalamata olives, added mushrooms and used campanelle pasta.  If you like Med. dishes, you can't go wrong with this one.  Thanks Sara!

Always a hit at our house...I like to use turkey bacon and any leftover jarred spaghetti sauce works too.

This is one of my husband's (and my!) FAVORITE pasta dishes. We call it "Valentine's Day Pasta," since we made it for Valentine's Day. To make it lighter, I always use turkey bacon and fat-free feta (and non-marinated artichoke hearts). It is wonderful. Thanks Sara!

Loved this recipe.  My fiance doesn't usually like pasta dishes, and he took the leftovers home.  I will make this recipe again!  I did use more olives just because we both like them.

I LOVED this dish (not to mention my drooling husband!)  I changed it up a little, though.  I would cook the bacon later in the dish so it's not soggy when you serve it, i didnt use any feta, and i added green bell peppers chopped up instead of artichokes.  It was SUPER!!  Topped with Parmesean and voila!!  This is not a saucy dish, but it's DEFINITELY not dry, nor is it lacking in flavor!

Excellent!  My husband called it restaurant quality!  I used bow tie pasta instead of linguine.  I agree with some other reviews that you can't really taste the bacon and may want to leave it out to reduce fat.  Wonderful recipe and very easy!

I really didn't care for this pasta, I think it was the canned tomatoes. I won't make this again but I would suggest that maybe some garlic could be added and use either fresh tomatoes or your favorite pasta sauce. I added garlic (one big fat clove, pressed) and lots of fresh rosemary and oregano and it still didn't help. I couldn't taste the bacon at all and would leave it out next time. This recipe is quick and easy but I don't think kids would like it. Sorry Sara.

Oh my gosh DELICIOUS!!! I basically used the same ingredients, with the addition of onions and garlic, but prepared a little differently.  I baked the chicken, and in the meantime sauteed the onions and garlic.  After chicken was baked, I cut up and added to the onions/garlic until everything was nice and browned, then added a cut up roma tomato.  I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the already cooked linguine, added the chicken and other cooked ingredients, then tossed in marinated artichokes and black olives.  I then topped with the feta cheese.  I used only 8 oz linguine and 2 chicken breasts, and this actually made 4 platefuls.  Absolutely delicious and healthy!!!!

I'd been meaning to try this recipe for a long time - now I wish I hadn't waited so long! The results are wonderful, and it's SO simple. It worked perfectly for me - I prepared it a few hours in advance and then put it in my crockpot on low to keep it hot since I'd have people in and out all night eating at different times. I'll definitely be adding this to my rotation!

I thought it was okay, but my husband and kids didn't care for it at all. They are not usually picky eaters and will pretty much eat anything I put in front of them, but they had a hard time with this. Maybe it was the artichokes, not sure.

This was soooooo good! Definately make it.  The feta cheese melts and melds into the sauce. I doubled the amount of diced tomatoes since I like a lot of sauce, but I kept everything else the same.  Will make again & again!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... and very simple to make! I fix this at least once a month and when I cook it for guests they ask for the recipe. I always use kalamata olives and usually add more artichokes because I love them. This tastes great the next day.... I also hide it in the fridge so I can have it all to myself. ;o)

Excellent dish, and very easy to prepare, and only uses two pans (one for the main dish, one for the pasta)!  I didn't use any add'l oil (other than the bacon fat) and my husband said that it needed a little, so he drizzled some on top.  The feta made the sauce slightly creamy, which was great!  Will definitely make again....SOON!

I love this.  To be honest it probably could have been artichokes and feta on a pile of dirt and I would have given it at least 3 stars but this was so much better.  Because I can't just leave a recipe alone I tweaked it.  I forgot to get rosemary at the store so I just messed with the spices.  Fennel seed, hot pepper, and some italian seasoning.  I am not a big fan of black olives so I skipped them.  Used a turkey bacon and added some olive oil to the pan when it was done cooking (since there really isn't any fat from that bacon.)  Also used some white wine with the mix to keep it nice and moist.  added a great flavor.  Also used whole wheat pasta.  Coulda brought me to tears with its yumminess!

Making it for 2, I used three frozen thighs (defrosted and cut into chunks), three slices of bacon (cut up first, fried, drained, and added later to the dish), and everything else per the recipe. I took a chance since my husband doesn't care for artichokes (sob!). We ate it all, over fettucine. He liked it!!!!

This was excellent! My husband and I really enjoyed it and I would make this for company. I cut the bacon into one inch slices and cooked it with the bacon until browned.  I deglazed the pan with a little white wine and added two cans of tomatoes instead of one. Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Easy and delicious.

I am giving this 5 stars because my husband and parents really liked this. In fact my husband was disappointed that I did not like it as he knows I am unlikely to fix it again.

This was surprisingly good, and very easy to make.  I made some changes just because of personal taste, but nothing drastically different.  I used whole wheat rotini pasta, seasoned tomatoes, and left out the olives while doubling the artichokes.  Next time I might add some wine to the tomatoes for a little more flavor.  If you want something tasty and easy enough for a weeknight, this is a great recipe.

Either too much pasta or too little sauce.  We liked the artichokes and bacon (I used extra too, and it was still hard to find in the dish).  I wouldn't want another can of tomatoes, but maybe some tomato sauce or pasta sauce?  My husband had to talk me up from 2 stars.

I'm not a fan of olives nor artichokes, so I just made this for Husband. He ate it but wasn't especially enthusiastic. Good for a change but I won't be making it again. Thanks anyway.

This was great. My family of picky eaters raved! Definitely a keeper. The husband suggests using clams next time. I took a lot of suggestions and used spinach instead of artichokes.

A...MAZING! Will definitely be fixing again. Posted pictures on facebook and have already had people asking for the recipe. I'll use less olive next time simply because my step-sons don't particularly care for them but other wise it was a huge hit! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was great. I added one minced garlic clove before simmering, otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was even better the next day for leftovers because the pasta absorbed more of the flavor.

Made it just like the recipe, except substituted baby bella mushrooms for the bacon. It was so delicious. I couldn't believe how good it was and the leftovers were tasty too.

Meh.  I was hoping this would be so much better than it was, I'm a big fan of all the ingredientsl, but it just came out kind of bland.  I may make it again, I may not, but there are plenty of other recipes out there that are very similar that seem to have a lot more flavor.

YUM!  So easy.  Like many others, I left out the bacon, so just sauteed the cut up chicken pcs in some olive oil, and sprinkled with Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  Also used a 12 oz bottle of artichoke hearts, not 6 oz, and served with penne pasta. This was really a great meal.  Will make it regularly.

This is heavenly! The bacon flavour really makes the dish! I used fresh linguine. 
Definitely a keeper.

Awesome and easy ... I used spaghetti cuz I didn't have linguine, used fresh tomatoes, didn't drain the artichokes, used 4 slices of bacon and tore them in pieces instead of crumbled them and it was wonderful! Definently a keeper!

No leftovers here!  This was incredibly delicious, and so easy to prepare.  A wonderful change of pace from the usual chicken dishes.  I'll be making this dish again and again.

I've made this several times. I double the sauce and use kalamata olives instead if black olives. My husband and friends love this recipe.

When I made it, i added:
- 1 clove of garlic
- Used halfed kalamata olives, instead of black olives
- used the bacon grease to cook the garlic and the chicken before adding the rest of the ingredients
- Added the tomatoes, feta, bacon pieces, kalamata olives, together with basil, a dash of cayenne, and just a little chili sauce.
But thats just me.

Delicious!  Used angel hair instead of linguine simply bc it's our favorite.  Hubby and children loved the flavors combined with  the chicken and pasta.

I've been making this recipe as written for years and think it's fantastic.  I've also made substitutions/tweaks on my own, mainly due to what I had or didn't have on hand or wanted to use up (sub a can of italian seasoned tomatoes/fresh tomatoes/marinated artichoke hearts/canned sliced black olives/more feta b/c I want to use it up/add white wine if I'm feeling sassy, etc etc).    What I've learned is that there's really no way to mess this up - it's great every time.  The rosemary is key, though.  And the feta, of course.  Don't skip/sub them (IMHO).   By now the only "permanent" tweak I make is to add extra bacon (b/c my family really likes bacon). 

I've got no problem with the canned ingredients, and in fact prefer them when I'm in a rush because it makes this a super-easy, fast dish.  I microwave the bacon while I cook the chicken and start to boil the water; then everything is usually ready to serve by the time the pasta is cooked.  

BTW, it's worth noting that I accommodate a low-carb diet in my household.  This "pasta" dish is a favorite b/c I don't have to toss this with pasta to serve.  My low-carbers can plate a very small amount of pasta and then load the rest of their plates with protein and veggie deliciousness.  Sometimes the pasta is skipped altogether (it's that good).  

My thanks for sharing this recipe is long overdue, and as sincere as the first time I tried it!  :)

This was delicious! I used Kalamata olives. There was no bacon flavor, though I used 3 center cut slices. If you want bacon flavor, you might use 4 or 5 slices. It was good anyway, though.

Loved the idea of this recipe and made it on a whim so I didn't have all of the ingredients.   I ended up using feta, Kalamata olives,  pickled artichokes, and zucchini sautéed in the bacon fat and pickle juice.  My kids looked at it and went yuck! but there were no leftovers in the end. Yum.

This was a simple, tasty, semi-healthy meal. I will for sure make it again. It was a big hit at a dinner party I hosted. The only change I made was that I didn't add the salt. I figured there was enough in the canned tomatoes. It tasted great without it.

Delicious recipe! I used it for a spontaneous family dinner and everyone raved over it. Used canned items and did the artichokes to taste. Plan on trying it with fresher items next time, should be even better!

This rocked! I used Greek pitted olives. And a little chicken broth while tomatoes and chicken cooked used a little lemon spritz. Also added a clove of garlic. Will make again next week!

Amazing! I did change this up a bit by adding shrimp and instead of using whorshire I used lemon juice and white wine. I also used more Bacon and feta and added fresh mushrooms. This turned out amazing!!

Also works great as salad! This is something I found out when the weather suddenly took a turn toward the best and I wanted to take dinner to the beach. I made the chicken, bacon, and pasta ahead of time, mixed it together including a little extra bacon juice, and added the artichokes. Swapped out the canned tomatoes for fresh, added the olives after it was all cooled, and made the addition of a little red onion. Toss fully cooled contents with the lettuce.

No need for dressing other than a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper with all those flavors, especially if you top with the feta.

Wonderful! I was concerned that some of the flavors would be too strong (I am not a huge fan of artichokey dishes) but it all blended together beautifully and company loved it. Made it exactly per recipe, except I used fresh rosemary.

This was fantastic! We added more bacon, but we always add more bacon!  This dish will be added to our favorite list.

Great! We added in spinach leaves, garlic, and roasted red peppers to add some variety. Great!
