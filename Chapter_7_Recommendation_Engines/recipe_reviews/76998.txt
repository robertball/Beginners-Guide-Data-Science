This is outstanding!  I made it using Spicy Bratwurst ("Cajun" flavor, the package said) - omitted sage & thyme because (1) I didn't figure it needed additional spice with the seasonings in the brats and (2) I don't particularly care for sage & thyme.  I also thought I wouldn't need to add the ketchup and mustard; but after tasting a potato, decided that was just what it needed instead of just adding salt.  My, oh my, the results were great - and I plan to make this a permanent recipe in my recipe binder.  Thanks, Pam, for this adaptable recipe!  (Bell pepper might be an addition to the next batch... and my husband is planning to enjoy the leftovers in tortillas with cheese for burritos.)

Normally something like this is right up my alley as I love sweet/savory combos. Nobody in our home liked this. It was very sausage-heavy (could have been better with half the sausage) and was greasy, even after draining the sausage. The sauce was better than I expected, but it was a dry hash. We ate this with over-easy eggs and, like a previous commenter, I found that the yolk added a LOT to this.. All the individual elements would have come together much better if there was more of a sauce to bind it. As is, I wouldn't make it again.

Yummy!  I omitted the sage & parsley and added fresh basil instead.  I also put an egg (over easy) on top of each serving.  The runny yolk added an extra depth of flavor to this already tasty dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My husband loved this. I did think the recipe was written weird though, first it says heat the oil in the pan so the potatoes don't stick, but you don't add the potatoes then you add the sausage and onion. Then for the sauce it calls for oil in the recipe list, but for water in the directions (I used water). Still it was good. As far as a pound of potatoes and half a pound of apples, I just used 3 potatoes and 2 green apples. It definitely took longer to cook the potatoes, which totally stuck to the bottom of the pan, but my husband loved it so 5 stars none the less. Will be making again. Oh no fresh parsly, only had dried, and worked fine.

Used mild italian sausage. Poultry seasoning, instead of sage or thyme, because that's what I had on hand. Delicious!!

I was a little skeptical of the recipe but was trying to find something easy and different to use some sausage I found buried deep in the freezer. I had to swag a bit on the ingredients (only had some red skin potatoes and a mixture of apples) but it was really good. Family loved it and I'll be making it again. It's a big dish so make sure you have a large frying pan or just dump it all into a soup pot and mix together once you're got everything prepared.  Also, apples and potatoes take a lot longer than 10 minutes to cook.

I didn't care for this at all and hubby (the potato and ketchup lover) thought is was just OK.  I think this recipe was written assuming you would be preparing in advance.  I used two skillets - one for the potatoes and I cooked the sausage, apple and onions in the other.  Once the potatoes were crisp I combined the two and mixed in the ketchup, mustard and water sauce.  Actually, I think it was the sauce that ruined this for us.  One reviewer pointed out that the recipe calls for an additional 2 T. of oil - that oil would be used to coat the potatoes prior to cooking - by using two skillets I was able to omit that oil.  None the less, I probably would not make this again.

We. Love. This. Hash!!!  I make it for every Christmas morning breakfast (and any other major holiday, like Easter, Thanksgiving morning, etc)--first, because it's delicious, second because it is allergy friendly--no dairy, eggs, nuts, etc.  It is super flavorful and saves well as left overs.  One hint--it takes a little longer to prepare than indicated and you MUST have a large, electric skillet to do this right.  Oh, and I always at least double the sauce recipe so it's not dry (as indicated in one previous review)...Good luck!

Edible. My husband said it should get 4 maybe 5 stars. He really liked it. I would have given it 1 star. I compromised and gave it 3 stars. I didn't care for the sauce. I liked the apples/potato/sausage/sage combination though. I will keep that but experiment with other sauces though. Using butter instead of oil would probably make a huge improvement on this.

This had great flavor!  I used equal amounts of Dijon and ketchup because I'm a fan of the mustard flavor.  I also added a dash of maple syrup to make it a little more savory.  My husband and I both loved it.  I think this sauce would also go great on chicken breasts or roasted vegetables.

I used sweet potatoes with this and it turned out really well.  I also used mild breakfast sausage, but will try some hot sausage next time because I think it would be a delicious combination with the sweet potatoes.

I found this recipe using the ingredient search for hot sausage.  Next time I will use 1/2 hot sausage and 1/2 mild just for personal taste.  3 out of 5 of my family LOVED the spicyness ... us other 2 wimps are the ones requesting the mix of mild.  Very good.  The ketchup sauce truly makes the dish.  I served it with poached eggs on top and will definitely be making this again.

This is tasty =). I honestly wasn't so sure about the sauce, but it really brought it together. It's not terribly pretty, but then, how many pretty hash recipes have you seen? I used beer brats and cooked the potatoes much longer than the recipe said...didn't want tough potatoes. Anyway, thanks for the keeper!
