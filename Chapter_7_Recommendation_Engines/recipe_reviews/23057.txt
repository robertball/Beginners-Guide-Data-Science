Very easy, great cake!  Frost the cake while it is still in the Bundt pan, and invert later.  I frosted the cake after inverting it, and the frosting didn't seep in as it should have.  Thanks for the recipe!

Too much vanilla taste and not enough orange and peach flavor.  Would be better made with orange cake mix.

Very easy, very tasty.  I had some of the peach juice mixture left too.  That was fine.  I just added some tequila and ice and made a margarita.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice in the last two weeks and everyone has asked for the recipe.  I, too, had too much peach mixture left over so I may cut it in half next time.  I also found that if you take the cake out of the pan and put the glaze in first to be helpful. TK in Houston.

Read the other reviews, so I left out the peach juice and used a navel orange for the oj and orange zest.  Got over 2 teaspoons zest.  Also made it in a 9x12 pan and made powdered sugar icing using 1 stick butter and the remaing blended liquid.  Next time I will leave the sugar out of the blended liquid and only blend until the peaches are in small pieces.

This was just okay. No peach slices but I did have mandarin oranges, so I used that instead. I had a lot of the pureed mixture, over a cup leftover. I found this overly sweet, I think the cup called for in the pureed mixture was overkill. Over the sweet, I couldn't pick out peach or orange much at all. I'd like to play around with this recipe to see if I can't improve it.

It didn't taste much like orange or peach. I was kind of disappointed.

This is a great cake. Very moist with alot of flavor. I think you can cut down on the amount of liquids. I always have extra of the peach-sugar-OJ mixutre left over. And I do think you don't need the alcohol if your making for children, because it doesn't cook out of the glazed part.

This was the first cake I ever baked. It was moist and everyone loved it. That said, I have to say that I did not taste any peach flavor at all. It was just a moist and tasty cake. I'll probably make it again but only after I've figured out a way to make it way more peachy.

I had too much peach liquid as well so next time I think I will drain the juice off the peaches. That should make somewhat of a difference.

After reading the reviews I expected too much I guess.  I made it for my daughters 26th birthday yesterday and expected more peach taste.  It was very moist and my daughter loved it.  I think if I make it again I may try frosting it with the leftover peach mix and whipping cream.  I did have about a cup and half of peach mixture leftover but I added it to some extra peach schnapps and orange juice and it make a very tasty fuzzy navel drink.
