Tastes pretty good but it's a heart attack in a bowl... The recipe doesn't even say to drain the bacon grease! (but I did). And it takes longer to cook than the 35 minutes indicated (like at least 20 more minutes at 350F).

I'm not a fan of mayonaise so I've never liked traditional potato salad. While planning a BBQ I decided to search for a mayonaise-free potato salad and came upon this. It worked out wonderfully for out gathering. A real hit, leaving some disappointed when there was none left! Instead of slicing the potatoes I cubed them, which required a little longer baking time, but I was glad I did cube them.

My very picky, and German, husband loved it! He said "this is a keeper", great praise from the man! It's more like a baked german potato salad/au gratin potatoes than a regular potato salad, but that's good!  It was fine the way it was (I followd the original recipe to a "T"), but next time I'm going to add more cheese (on the first layers) and more salt and pepper.  Great Recipe!

Yum!  I made a slightly larger batch of this which filled a 9 x 13 dish.  What little bit is left I'm having for lunch!  I made a few adjustments, but didn't stray too far from the recipe.  I added a little chopped celery first, then, since I couldn't find any heavy cream at the store, I substituted 1 half pint of whipping cream, and then split amount of milk in half and used sour cream to make up the other half.  And added extra cheddar cheese.  Not so much like a potato salad as a potato cassarole...but very yummy anyway.

This was really good! I used bacon bits instead of having to fry up the bacon and it worked just fine. I also added some seasoning salt over the potatoes to give it a boost. I don't think this tasted anything like potato salad ~ but it did taste just like a really awesome potato skin! Yum! Thanks, Ros! :o)

Yummy! This dish was rich and delicious. I added French onion soup mix to the milk and cream, which made it extra tasty.

This casserole is okay, but heavy on the bacon and cream.  I wanted more potato salad flavor, so ended up sprinkling lemon juice over my serving.

This was a great side dish with our Smoked Pork Butt this weekend. Simple but flavorful. Salt and pepper needs to be added to the potato layers. I would make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I am always looking for different ways to server potatoes, and you can't go wrong with this...I used scallions instead of regular onions...it's just like a "loaded" baked potato bake!  I also substituted half and half for the heavy cream.

Very good, loaded with flavor.  I had left over baked potatoes and used them.  I also sprinkled garlic powder on potatoes between layers.  Yummy!

I put a little less milk and glad I did!  It was creamy enough for me!  My husband loved and that is always a +.  I cheated and used fresh bacon bits!  I'll make again.
