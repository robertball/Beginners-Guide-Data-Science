The flavor, decorations were absolutely perfect. I made a few tweaks for the recipe. I used red velvet cake mix on the cupcakes, for a bloodier and darker look. My family loved them.

Good to go on this one.  I don't bake much, but used all boxed ingredients including the frosting.  So, can't vouch for the taste but they looked good.
