I followed the recipe to the letter, except I shredded the cabbage while processing the other veggies finely.  The soup was fantastic, though three bouillon cubes were not enough to salt that much water. Next time I will also probably add some chunky potatoes to give the soup a bit more to bite into.  Topped it with fresh grated Parmigiano Reggiano and the kids ate it up!

I had the soup vegetarian without a processor and it turned out great. Note I added salt and pepper and added onion powder to the ingredients. I made it vegetarian using fake bacon and not chicken bouillon (

I made some serious changes, two of which were not good. I am assuming that had I followed the recipe exactly, it would have been 4 stars. The version I made was probably 3 stars. The day I made this, I had ten minutes to get it in the crock pot before I ran out the door. I cored the cabbage and cut it into 4 wedges, put the entire bunch of chard in (stems and all), used an entire yellow bell pepper that had been cored and seeded, and 2 whole (peeled) smallish carrots, whole green onions and a celery stalk. I omitted kale. I roughly chopped 7 slices of bacon. I threw it all in the pot with water and seasonings and cooked it on high for 4 hours. I came home and blended it up with an immersion blender. Texture wise, it worked great! A nice, thin soup with no chunks. However, the chard and bell pepper taste were too strong. I should have halved both. I fixed it with more water and chicken bouillon, though. A couple days later, I did wind up boiling some sweet potatoes and adding them in to make the soup more hearty.

I did NOT use bacon.  For additional flavor I added half a can of spaghetti sauce and it is filling and tasty   chris
