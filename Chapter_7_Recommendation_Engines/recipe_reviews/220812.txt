I submitted this recipe.  AR changed my ingredient list, but you should use raw, unsalted seeds and you should have no problems with saltiness of this granola.

Also, I always do a combination of dried fruit.  I chop dried cherries, blueberries, apples, cranberries, and apricots and add them to a 1-cup measuring cup until it is full.  It gives a nice variety of flavor.

This is not a super sweet granola!  The fruit provide most of the sweetness.

Enjoy!

Not as crunchy as I hoped. I did use no salt raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds. I also upped the flax seeds and the wheat germ to 1/4 each. Upped the cinnamon to almost a tablespoon, kinda chewy finsih....and kinda bland due to lack of salt and no sweetness...next time I would add some brown sugar and maybe 2 tblspns of olive oil. Good potential and very healthy. Tasty in my yogurt today...just not the best recipe I have tried....but thanks!

I would suggest buying unsalted seeds if you can. Just made this and it was way too salty. I had to add brown sugar after the fact, but still too salty.  Next time I will know better.
