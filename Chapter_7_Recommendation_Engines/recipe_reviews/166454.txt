This cake could use more flavour.  If I were to make it again, I would add cinnamon.  Rather than using whipped cream and berries, I made an apple sauce by cooking apples in apple juice with nutmeg and cinnamon and served it with some vanilla ice cream.

This cake was unexpectedly good! Although I misread the instructions and gave the cake batter a good whisk instead of gently stirring it, it still turned out very moist and delicious! The texture is not like a cake; in fact, it's very different. But I still love it. The only thing I'd change in the recipe is to bake it for 40-45 minutes instead of 30 minutes.
