My teenage son, my sweetie, and I loved this! I usually make homemade red enchilada sauce, but this was much tastier. This is the first I've used canned green sauce, but it has an authentic Mexican flavor. I used small green and red bells and pepper jack cheese--that gave it just the right amount of spiciness. Also, I used half the cornstarch, as the called-for amount seemed excessive--I was right! Served with a little sour cream and chopped avocado--enchilada heaven! This one's a definite keeper!

These were pretty good. I thought the onions and peppers should have been cut into smaller pieces and the green sauce could be added right out of the can instead of thickening. My husband really liked them.

This was ok. I thought the sauce was a little thick. I think they would be better with regular green enchilada sauce.

I don't generally like Mexican food, but this was outstanding.  My 5 year old son told me that this is the best thing he has ever eaten.

Great recipe and so easy to throw together!  However, I used flour tortillas because I can't get the tender fresh corn tortillas like I could in Texas, and it was just as great without being soggy. 

Thanks for another tasty and more healthful recipe Sunset!

Awesome!  I think it would also be just as good with flour tortillas.

This was good, but not great considering the time involved.  If I make this again I will top with the White Cheese Sauce from this site.
