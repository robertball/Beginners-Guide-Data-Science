I made this for dinner the other night, and while I thought it was good I'd make a few changes. One, I would use more of the seasoning, in fact I would double it. Second, I think I will coat the chicken in oil, put it on the baking sheet and then sprinkle the spice mixture on top. Oh and it took my chicken 45 mins to cook not 25.
