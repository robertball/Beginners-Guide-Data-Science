uber tasty.
unfortunately the dough doesnt bind, and you can fix that by adding more powdered milk to a good consistency. not too doughy, but just enough that it holds the shape of a ball.

I love gulab jamun, but this recipe doesn't have the right proportions in the dough. Even so, the cooking technique is SPOT ON. If you want to make this recipe as is, just work milk powder into the soft dough by kneading until it is solid enough to hold a ball shape without flattening. Do divide the dough into 20 balls even though they seem small. They are very rich! Also, let your oil cool a bit before adding the second batch by removing it from the heat for a few min. It is important to make the syrup in a large fry pan so there is room for all your little donuts to soak. Cheers!

This is a spectacular recipe! I've tried several LOTS of different recipes from this site and this is one of the BEST! I didn't have any Rose Water or the nuts or raisins so I just left them out. Wonderful! Make sure you brown them enough in the oil so that they keep their round shape. Mine went a bit flat in the syrup. I used more ground cardamom too, my mom and I just LOVE cardamom! I will use this recipe again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm a big fan of gulab jamun and the recipe for rose water syrup is spot on, but this dough recipe needs serious alteration.  The dough refuses to set!  After adding what felt like a ton more powdered milk (as recommended by another reviewer), I added more flour and it set perfectly but DO NOT DO THIS.  The balls came out beautifully shaped but tasted like rose water bisquick pancakes, lol.  I recommend slowly adding nearly double the powdered milk called for and testing the dough frequently until it becomes manageable.    Also, to make galub jamun the traditional size (so they stay moist), your dough balls need to be the size of ping pong balls, regardless of how many you produce.    Best of luck!

As other reviewers have said, the dough part of the recipe is off.  I added about twice as much milk powder - the dough held its shape at this point. After resting on the counter for 20 minutes, the dough felt almost like rubber and I was concerned, but it turned out great! I also added two cinnamon sticks and a pinch of ground cinnamon to the syrup.  
Also, when you first drop the dough balls into the hot oil, they will stick to the bottom - I used a wooden spoon to get them off the bottom and they floated pretty quickly. Just move them around for a few minutes and then follow the recipe until the end. I expected these to be mediocre and they were AMAZING. (note: I didn't add any of the optional ingredients).

Recipe for dough does not bind, it is runny and not able to form balls from it.  I agree with Effie, add more dry milk until able to form balls.  I tried adding more flour but it made it too doughy.  Next time I will try more dry milk.  They should be spongy not doughy.

I made this for the first time, using a bit more powdered milk and less fluid milk, and it turned out delicious! Just like in the restaurants! My husband and in laws were pleased and I will use this recipe again.

For never having this type of dessert before, I thought it was pretty good. I would give it 5 stars if I knew that this is what they are supposed to taste like. I changed a few things. Instead of the all purpose flour and the baking powder, I used a half cup of bisquick. Also, instead of adding all the milk at once, I suggest adding it a little at a time until a medium hard consistency is created. I then separated the sticky dough into about 18-20 sections. I covered it with a slightly damp kitchen towel and let it sit for about an hour. After about an hour, I was able to roll the dough into little balls without much problem. The key is not to add a lot of milk and to let it sit in order to form the small balls. I then followed the rest of the recipe as stated. The syrup makes them a bit sweet but not too bad. I received positive comments on this dessert so I will probably try making them again.

Really good recipe, a great indian dessert for people who haven't tried something like this before. The cardamom is the secret to success with this. Also be really careful when frying, mine only took about 20 seconds to cook while the recipe says 5 mins! Nice golden little exotic treats :)

I love gulab jamun, and had a craving to make it. This recipe was tasty, however it wasn't really like the real thing. The dough was very runny, so I used one of those small ice cream scoopers that you squeeze and it clears out the contents. It made decent balls and it definitely kept me from getting messy trying to work with that pancake-y batter with my hands. I liked the syrup, but included more cardamom and added a twinge of imitation butter flavouring. Basically, even though I enjoyed these, they tasted like funnel cakes with syrup on them (in place of the normal topping of powdered sugar). So yes, still good, but mine didn't really taste like the gulab jamun I love.

Great Recipe!!!! I've never made these before but I've had them many times while eating out. I was worried that the dough was not thickening up before I let it sit so I added a lttle extra bit of powdered milk, sure enough after the 20 minute resting period the dough was nice and firm (but sticky). They came out wonderfully and we VERY easy to make! A+++++

I didn't make these balls (I bought the commercial variety) but I thought I would pass on a technique to get the syrup into the balls without putting them in a frying pan with the syrup.  When South Africans make their "koeksusters"  (literally and pronounced basically the same  "Cook sisters") they make up the syrup the night before and put it in the fridge.  The next day, after they have deep fried their koeksusters they drop them immediately into the syrup. The syrup is then sucked up into the koeksuster.  The syrup should be kept cold.

I made Gulab Jamun as a surprise for my boyfriend, he is from Bangladesh. He absolutely loved it!!! And so did I! The suggestions are correct; 2 cups of powdered milk are needed instead of 1. Another thing I would recommend is to let the dough rest for about 5 minutes after mixing it! It will give time for regular milk to be absorbed by the powdered one and the dough is much easier to handle! Thank you so much for posting it :)

Terrible recipe. The dough is an awful consistency, and you taste too much of the flour. I made the mistake of only looking at the star rating and not reading the comments in depth. Do yourself a favor and make it the proper way from scratch (instead of using milk powder and making dough), curdling milk and skimming the curds. It'll come out MUCH better, and only takes a little longer to prep. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS RECIPE

I made about 4 batches of these and found the dry milk powder ratio to be correct but you have to let it sit for a a bit longer - say 40+ minutes and I felt that the dough consistency was less wet  when I used purchased Ghee vs clarifying the butter myself. Those two things made a world of difference.  With both of those fixes, the dough was easier to work with and I could make 20 small balls that expanded when cooked.  I used everything except the rose water.  Next time I would add more cardamon since we couldn't detect it.  These are substantial dense balls and best when fresh or heated

Good recipe. For those who have a sticky dough add more ghee to mixture instead of milk and knead well until it leaves the sides of the bowl. You may also omit the nuts and raisins for a smoother texture.

This was perfect indeed! I couldn't believe it when I tasted it and found it to be the exact taste as it would be when I buy from a Bombay Sweet shop! Thanks for this wonderful recipe........I am able to prepare this inspite of the fact that I'm not an Indian and am new to cooking.

This is the worst version of this recipe i ever made. If you were like me and didn't read the comments until you already added all the milk, you will need to add more milk powder of flour or both. Just be sure not to overknead the dough. I did with mine which activated the gluten in the flour and my gulab jamun was very bready. It turned out OK after I added the syrup but still didn't like it at all. Also, be sure to fry on a low heat so that it cooks all the way through. You can then raise the heat to get the color faster. Such a tedious process this was because of the wrong proportions.

These are delicious but like others have said I had to add a LOT more milk powder. I also decided to grind up my almonds and used quite a bit of those, too - it helped a lot.  I used currants instead of golden raisins because I needed to use them. The sauce is delicious! I would definitely make these again!

Will be making again! Not a fan of roses so we went without, was STILL awesome. When I applied heat to the pill I didn't bring to medium, I kept on medium low and they didn't cook TOO fast. Very rich.

Difficult recipe to get right. The other reviewers were right about the dough not binding. Our batter also came out too goopy, even when we added more and more milk powder, making it difficult to even roll into balls. We ended up with a bunch of deep-fried patties instead, which were still tasty, but not ideal.
