I have used this recipe for 25 plus years.  I am the pie baker for our family and friends in Virginia.  My only rival is my sister-in-law in Upstate New York who gave me this recipe.  My husband's family revels in their history of fine pastry and the ultimate compliment was when he told me my pie was as good as his Grandmother's had been!!!  This recipe has a lot to do with my success.  I often use white shortening for savory pies and less sweet dessert pies.  I've been known to replace a cup of white with whole wheat flour in the recipe for savory or more earthy dessert pies.  Reduce sugar for savory crust and add for very sweet crust...  I always roll it out after refrigerating.  For Thanksgiving and Christmas I usually make 1 to 3 batches at a time and freeze in individual single crust size discs (waxed paper then inserted in individual plastic bags) to use as needed.  4 to 12 pies at Thanksgiving and 4 to 6 at Christmas time!!!  Don't know how we could make it through the holidays without this one!

I made half recipe used whole egg . It is a very easy. A tip is to press it in the pan and then use cold wet hands to smooth it out.  Anna

I make about 50 pies on Thanksgiving every year, for teachers at my school,   (I'm the cafeteria manager) and I used this recipe for the crusts this year and they are just raving about how flaky the crust is and how delicious.    Joan

I hate making pie crusts & end up buying those frozen ones.  Well, I tried this & it was great!!  I used my food processor to mix everything & then chilled it overnight before pressing it out in the pans.  Worked like a charm.  The crust was very flaky.  My husband was impressed!

I liked the reviews for this pie crust, but was really unsure with the vinegar and the egg that it called for.   This crust was very flavorful.  My only substitutions were using rice wine vinegar, but you couldn't taste it at all, and I used 1/3 shortening, 1/3 butter and 1/3 lard.  I used this crust with the Peach-A-Berry pie filling recipe from this site.  It turned out to be an amazing pie crust.  It browns beautifully, but not too much (I place on rack in lower 1/3 oven for this).  My guests have raved about how flaky and light the crust is. One important note: I only use @ 1/4 cup of water, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less... (I add a little at a time to get just the right pie crust dough consistency, where it holds together when squeezed).  This makes it very easy to work with.  I've tried it with the recommended amount of water, and with less, and it just seems a lot easier to work with when using less.  I use just a light dusting of flour when rolling the dough out, and find that it doesn't stick at all.

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it twice in the past week and I've had great results always. When I used it for a sweet fruit pie I added some vanilla and a little extra sugar to the recipe. I only make 1/2 the amount (8 servings) and I have enough dough for 2 crusts. Even though the recipe doesn't suggest rolling the dough, I roll it out . It's so easy to work with it only takes 2 minutes.

This pie crust is the easiest to work with I have ever found.  The egg and vinegar (not standard pie crust ingredients) make it more stable during the rolling out and transferring to a pie plate phase.  The taste is great and the crust is flaky.

This pie crust rocks.  First pie crust I've ever made and my wife couldn't stop eating pie. : )  I did substitute 4 sticks of butter as I had no shortening and then another half cup of flour so it would have better consistency.

Wow, I was REALLY skeptical on the outcome of this recipe. I'm an avid baker and tried this more out of curiosity. I've heard of using vinegar in pie crust before (vinegar relaxes the gluten so the dough doesn't get tough as easily with overhandling, therefore creating more tender crusts), but I never heard of adding egg. I made just half the recipe (which was PLENTY for two crusts!), but used 50/50 butter and Crisco. It's a sticky dough and I found it hard to pat into the pan, so I rolled it out.  The dough was real elastic-like and I was thinking this could never be flaky.  I made a three-berry pie with this crust, baking at 400 degrees and the results were amazing. Tender, flaky and flavorful. I used 1.5 teaspoon salt to compensate for the flavorless Crisco.  TIP - just make sure you roll/pat the bottom crust thin or it will have a hard time cooking through. I bake all my pies on the lowest level in my oven, this one too. Overall, this is everything you want in a crust - flaky and tender. And it's also very forgiving.  You can overhandle this and it won't toughen up on you. I've used this about 5-6 times now.

Very easy pie crust - I cut the recipe in half and used a whole egg.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I chilled the dough and it worked out perfectly.  It was very flaky and had a great taste.

Too much fat and too much liquid made for a heavy, greasy, unworkable dough.  Even adding the liquid carefully was not enough to make up for too much shortening.  Lesson learned - I didn't read the recipe carefully - and should have.

Super easy.  Just ensure you spread the dough all the way to the top ends of the pie dish before baking as it  shrinks a bit when cooked!

My dad is the hardest person in the world to please. Since his mother passed away several years ago, to ask him no one has been able to make a pie crust as good as hers. With this recipe I made two pumpkin pies and a lattice top cherry pie. Slicing the cherry was almost a chore keeping it "pretty" as the lattice was so tender. My dad's exact words when he tasted it, "Oh my gosh... this is the best pie I've ever had. THAT is a crust my mother would have been proud of. I am." In my book, there is no better compliment.

It was a disaster at first and I almost started crying because I had alreay made the pie filling.  I have never made a pie crust.  Here's what happened.  It took forever to mix the shortening and flour together, so I decided to use my hands.  I dipped my fingers into cold water first, as suggested by another reviewer but I could have made a pie crust just from the dough that stuck on my hands.  I put the mess into the fridge for a few hours to chill like another reviewer suggested.  It only made it slightly easier.  So, I took another reviewers suggestion and decided to roll it out between two floured pieces of wax paper.  Another disaster.  It stuck to the wax paper so bad that I must have spent a half an hour trying to scoop it all off.  By now, I was really worried.  All recipes say not to over-work the flour - as it will be a tough, hard pastry.  I had been squishing it, playing with it, rolling it and messing it up for so long at this point.  How could I fail a never fail pie crust!  I rolled it into a ball, flattened it out somewhat and begun working it from the center of the pan outward.  I couldn't make it even, and some places it was paper thin.  I forged ahead anyway, having given up at this point.  Baked the pie then tasted it.  Guess what? Amazing, flaky, delicious pie crust!!!  Whatever you do, don't give up, it really does work!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out terrible!  The crust was thick and lumpy and had an off flavor, maybe from the vinegar.  I guess I don't like no-roll pie crust.  Rolling dough makes it flat and thin, which makes for a much better crust (and doesn't take much extra time), but I wanted to give the no-roll type a try.  The no-roll version requires extra dough and it is way too thick, which caused it to be raw underneath, so I had to double the cooking time, which overcooked the apples.  This recipe was rated high, but I can't help notice that many of the raters *altered* the recipe in order to make it work.  If you have to make significant alterations, it's no longer the same recipe.  Many people rolled the dough and many people used less dough (even half the amount listed) or had leftover dough.  Maybe they are such experienced cooks that they knew ahead of time that altering would be necessary.  I guess I'm not in that category; therefore, I like recipes which don't need altering in order to be good.

This is a great recipe - however, it is marked "two crusts" for the four cups of flour, and is to be patted, not rolled out -- well, for me, it makes FOUR patted-out crusts, not two! It would make two double crusts, but the tops would not be patted.... anyway, delish!

I agree with some other reviews, this is way too greasy and shrinks terribly in the pan.  I actually took it out 1/2 way through and kept pushing it up the sides of the pie pan to stay in place.  Will not try again, I was very disappointed.  Sorry!

I made this recipe last week and used the spiral dough beaters on my mixer, which worked great. I made the full recipe, but used half on one pie last week and stored the other half for a pie this week. The first pie I baked the entire pie with the crust (no pre-baking) and it didn't bake well in certain areas and felt dense and doughy even though the pie was done. The second half was used in a pie that held a cream filling, so the crust was baked completely first, before the filling was added. I must say the results on the second pie were outstanding and will be the preferred way I use this recipe. I love the flavor of the recipe and it lends itself well to the sweet fillings I put in it.  It is not sweet, nor bland, but tasted like an old-fashioned pie crust. I am KEEPING this recipe! Thanks so much, Sheila in Missouri

Excellent crust, flaky and buttery. I didn't have enough shortening, so I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. Really, this was the easiest crust to make. I tried the other crust that had higher ratings on this site in numbers, but this was easier to make and tastier. I didn't roll out the bottom crust, just patted it into the pie pan, but had to roll out the top crust in order to place it on top. This is my go to recipe for crust now! Thanks!!

This crust is amazing!  And so simple to make.  I made two batches (enough for 6 pies) two days before I was making pies. I wrapped the two balls of dough in wax paper and ziplock bags and put them in the fridge.  When I got ready to make the pies, I took a third of a ball of dough and placed it between two sheets of wax paper (sifted a little flour to keep it from sticking) and used a rolling pin to roll out the crust.  It is easily handled and pressed by hand as well; I just wanted a uniform crust.  It is flaky. Perfect.

I was always embarrassed to bake pies as gifts because I never knew how my crust would turn out (too tough, too crumbly, etc.) Not any more - I LOVE this recipe!   It's very easy, forgiving, and makes more than enough for two deep dish pie shells.  Best of all it tastes fabulous and is always super flaky! No more store-bought crusts for me!  I've used the suggestion of 50/50 regular Crisco and real butter & it works great that way also.

I made this recipe as written, and patted it into the dish even though I noticed that most of the reviewers had to roll it out (so much for a no-roll crust!).  The crust was far too thick, greasy and heavy, with an artificial-butter taste.  My favorite pie crust recipe involves tossing everything into a food processor, rolling out the dough and draping it into the dish, and it yields a light, flaky crust in half the time it takes to pat this recipe's large lump of dough into the pan.  Not worth the time or effort for an inferior-tasting crust.

I have always HATED rolling out pie crusts.  Nothing else can make me more angry and frustrated than a pie crust that just won't cooperate.  That is until I found this recipe.  It is so EASY!  I've used it twice now.  The first time I just pressed the dough into the pie plate. The second time, I rolled it (without any frustration!).  Both pies came out beautiful!

I can't put in print the words that came out of my mouth as I attempted this recipe.  Like some other reviewers, I found that the dough came out entirely too wet/gooey.  And this in our very dry climate.  Anyway, I added & added flour to the point that I had a GIGANTIC ball of dough that STILL fell apart.  It may have had to do with the fact that this is a hot July day--didn't help my disposition and apparently did not help the dough.  To be fair, on my SECOND attempt (same hot July day), the dough came out a bit less gooey, and, with the addition of at least another 1/2 cup flour, was acceptable to work with.  Pie is in oven--we shall see.  A piece of the edge already fell off.

This crust tastes amazing! But, it doesn't hold together at all! I used a ton of flour to roll it out with, and it still had a very greasy texture to it. The pies ended up looking gorgeous, but as soon as I put a knife in to cut it the crust just crumbled and didn't hold form at all.

This is my go-to pie crust always. Funny, though, when I first started making it I must have not added the vinegar. I'm not sure what the vinegar is for in terms of the baking chemistry (or taste), but I finally added it last time and really didn't like the taste or the smell. I will keep doing the same recipe sans vinegar since it always turns out well without it.

Amazing pie crust; really the best I've ever had. The second time I made it, I omitted the vinegar and it came out just as wonderful. I rolled it out quickly and easily on my cutting board without flouring it first, and it didn't even stick! I made two strawberry orange rhubarb pies, one with a full top crust and one interlaced. They both looked and tasted amazing (see pictures). Will definitely make again and again.

Saying I have always hated making pie crusts is an understatement; I've tried every non-roll pie crust on this site because of my trepidation in rolling out pie crust dough (and the numerous disappointments over the years).  I will say I have made some good non-roll pie crusts, but my goal has been to find a rolled pie crust recipe I can learn to use and have a really flaky crust as a result.  Well, I must say, this crust turned out incredibly flaky and great tasting!   In fact, I could hardly believe I made it.  I did follow some suggestions of others and halve the recipe, but use a whole egg and 1 T of sugar.  It did crack in one spot and the upper crust was fragile - each time I cut a piece it fell off - I believe I caused that from pressing the top up higher to make sure the sides wouldn't shrink down into the pan.  The dough was a sticky mess; I actually had to roll it 3 different times because it was sticking to everything.  I finally rolled it out between wax paper sheets as another reviewer suggested, and still had to peel it off the wax paper in some spots.  So, all that being said - the result was simply wonderful and I've decided I need to force myself to work with this recipe to fix the problems (that I might have caused) because the result was so forgiving and good.  Any dough that can take being rolled out 3 times, having extra flour thrown on it 3 times, etc, etc and still result in a great pie crust is worth trying again and working out the kinks!

I love this pie crust it is so easy to do. The only thing I do to make it a little easier is, I dust the top of the dough before forming it to the pie pan it make it so much easier and is a lot less sticking to your fingers.

I love this recipe. I've used the Betty Crocker recipe for years and recently decided to try this because everyone said it was so easy and good! I don't have a food processor and on a whim decided not to use my cutter.  I used my electric beaters to cut the shortening and to blend it all. It's a mess, use a deep bowl, but the pastry pulls easily off the beaters and because it's so easy to work with... it's easy cleanup, too.  I cut the recipe in two the second time I tried it and used a whole egg. Barely makes enough for a top and bottom, but I will continue to cut in two because I usually only make one pie at a time.

Finally, a pie crust recipe that's as easy as it says!  I do roll mine out, though, and I've found that this recipe can make four crusts.  I like to use whole wheat pastry flour and organic ingredients.  Also, I sprinkle in some flaxseed, which gives it a nutty flavor that people seem to love!

I am totally pie crust impaired. For decades I've used store bought ready made crust. I read the reviews and took the plunge. I did it! Superb flavor and easy enough that even I could do it. If you are debating whether or not to try this, stop debating and start doing. Thanks so much for all of the reviews and a special thanks for posting this recipe!

It worked in a pinch (couldn't find my rolling pin), but the dough came out very mushy.  I could taste the vinegar in the baked crust.  It also was not as attractive as a rolled crust would have been.

I absolutely LOVE this pie crust recipe. It is so simple and it has a great flavor. The only change I make is that I use butter instead of butter-flavored shortening because I don't like shortening in my recipes. I also cut the ingredients in half and it's still enough for two pies!  My picky 6yr old son and husband love it too.

This is the best pie crust I've ever had-buttery, flaky, and just plain amazing.  I get nothing but compliments on my pies thanks to this recipe... If you don't have a good crust, you don't have a good pie.  I've used it for every pie-from fruit to cream, and it comes out perfect every time.

My husband made this yesterday while I was making the chicken pot pie IX recipie and it turned out wonderfully!  You really don't have to roll it out just shape it to whatever pan you are using-we ended up using a deep casserole dish.  Top marks!

I got one double crust pie and three single crust pies (9 in deep dish) from this recipe.  All excellent!  I did roll the crust out after pressing the first crust into the pie plate because it did not save time and it  was difficult getting a consistant thickness.  Overall, an excellent, tender flaky crust.  Time to make some pumpkin pies!! YUM!

I made this crust only using half the ingredients and it turned out to be the perfect amount for one pie.  The crust was flaky and golden brown.  My wife even commented on how it tasted like her mom's crust.  I'll never use a different one.

This was my first attempt at pie crust, which I have always considered a daunting task, reserved for "professionals."  I am happy to report this was simple, perfect, and I will never buy another packaged crust when this is readily available in a snap! I used this to make apple dumplings-WOW!  Thank you very much.

I think it took as long to "pat" this into the pie pan as it would have to roll it out. The crust was very thick and dense. I didn't even use the whole amount.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is the sweetness, if you plan to use it for a fruit or chocolate pie, I would recommend adding more sugar or your choice of sweetener, the crust tastes great, has a wonderful texture and is very easy to work with (with floured hands) and would also make an awesome pot pie, or meat pie crust. However needs just a bit more sugar for dessert pies.

Well, I have made one piecrust in all my 50+ years until today.  Family was dying for chicken pot pie and I didn't have any frozen goody crust on hand. So, I used this recipe with a few modifications.  I left out the sugar totally....and used eggbeaters in place of the one egg, and half margarine(Imperial) and half (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter). I mixed everything and then cut a piece of alluminum foil the size of my pan 9x13 and patted the dough onto the foil, I just a little flour on my hands and spread it the whole length and width of the foil.  Filled the pan with the chicken pie mixture and flipped the foil into the pan.  It was easy.  Cooked it for 50 min at 400.

I made as stated with the exception of water (only add as needed). I get rave reviews & only use this crust recipe now (have made many many times now).  I still prefer to roll it (thanks for suggestion of using flour on wax paper) & it is heavy, so you need to be quick transferring. Having said that, if you need to re-roll, this recipe is completely forgiving! Also, it is nice to have a LARGE crust recipe: this made 2 crusts as well as 4 tart shells that I can freeze to use later. The finished product was really good & tender. I'm excited to use this recipe again. Thanks so much for this!

Epic fail.  If you use crisco, get the premeasured sticks.  If you use the water displacement method (like my grandma taught me) to measure the crisco from a can, it will be far too much.

I used this and I think that the crust is nice and flakey.  My suggestion to help though is to roll out on wax paper and use the paper to flip into pan.  Then of course peel off the paper.  Much easier than trying to peel off floured counter or off of roller.

I made chicken pot pie with this as my crust and I had to take time to rate my 1st recipe with 5 STARS. I did not use all the water (1/4 cup) and thought I had a mess at first, but it turned out really well.  I don't even have a rolling pin but I used a glass to flatten it out on wax paper and then transferred it to a 9x13 pan and used by hands to mold the pan, very easy.  I left about 1/3 for a top crust. I didnt have time to let it sit in the fridge like most crusts, but it didnt matter because it turned out really good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This crust is amazing. As others mention, however, it is extremely flaky - not at all like your usual pie crust. Make sure you desire a flaky, buttery crust if you choose this recipe. We used it as a crust for pizza, and this was a hit as well.

This is the best pie crust recipe I've encountered. I like to keep a few tupperware containers of it in the freezer for emergencies. I tend to use butter instead of shortening though, as I'm more likely to have it in the house.

My sister, who hates cooking, helped me with thanksgiving dinner and I had her make the pumpkin pies with this crust recipe and it turned out perfect.  This is her first "baking from scratch" experience.  If she can make it with out failing, anyone can!!!

The easiest and flakiest crust I've ever made. Definitely great for those (of us) who aren't very talanted in the baking department. I made this with a pumpkin pie recipe from this site and this will my "special crust" from now on. I got 3 nice 9" crusts out of a single recipe.

I was kind of skeptical on using a different pie crust recipe.  I've been using my mom's recipe all my life.  We're moving so my cook book is packed away so I figured I'd try this one.

This is the BEST recipe I've ever used.  I kept thinking when reading the recipe this is a lot of shortening and I've never heard of putting an egg or vinegar, but I ended up using the recipe exactly as posted and it was the flakiest best pie crust i've ever made. 

I was absolutely delighted with the results and this will now become my favorite crust.

Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I am the original "pie crust failure". Either too hard and too dry or unable to roll easily....
This crust was perfect and even looks good!
I didn't have enough Crisco, so I substituted 1/2 Crisco and 1/2 butter...
Yea! Now I can make pies! (And pretty pot pies too!)

I am now a homemade pie crust expert thanks to this GREAT no-fail pie crust...I made (2) cherry cobblers for Christmas and used this crust recipe...my brother just called me ranting and raving about how delicious the CRUST was (a key element in any pie or cobbler you make especially when he asked me to load up on the crust as I was fixing his go-to container after dinner)...thank you SO much for this recipe..I also followed the advice about mixing the crust and chilling it while I made my chocolate chips cookies and coming back to it later.  I also rolled it out for a perfect crust...thanks again.

This was great and super fast! I made it in the food processor.  Didn't quite have 4 cups of flour but used what I had. Used butter (don't usually have shortening on hand) and not sure I used the whole 2 cups of that either...just cut up some butter and threw it in (we buy our butter in bulk so its not pre-marked/measured).  And I did roll it out since I was using it for the top of my chicken pot pie. If I had tried I am pretty sure I could have gotten 2 crusts from it, but was in a hurry so i just rolled it out and threw it on the top.  It was a super quick and yummy tasting recipe!!

This is the most amazing recipe!!  I've never made crust before because it seemed so intimidating.  But I tried this one and I will NEVER buy crust again.  It was so easy, and so delicious!  I made chicken pot pie with this, pressed the bottom crust in and rolled the top crust.  Perfect!

Worked wonderfully!  I only used 3 1/2 cups of flour as I needed to roll mine out with more flour.  5 stars!

I love how I don't have to roll this out, cause I am not very good at that....but I do have a hard time getting the crust even and have been known to let some parts get too thick.  I made an apple pie for the in-laws and noticed that several of them had eaten all of the pie, except for parts of the crust in which it looked like they were maybe too thick of spots.  Maybe it's just me  :)  Otherwise a good recipe.

GREAT recipe, I have never successfully rolled out ANY dough before this recipe (used a cloth pastry mat and roller cover for the first time though).  This would be great as is for quiches but next time I will add a bit more sugar for desserts - and I do NOT like my desserts overly sweet

I am going to try this again to try and prefect it. I made this crust in combination with a home-made apple pie filling I have and it tastes great. But the dough was not easy to pat down or work with at all because it was so soft. I think next time I will add less ice water, and maybe chill the dough in the fridge before I work with it to firm it up a bit. Maybe even chilling the shortening before mixing would help.

Really good recipe for a fast and easy pie crust.  The flakiness factor is medium, as the crust is a little dense.  But it is still as good to slightly better then store bought.   Thanks for this recipe.  I am sure I will be using this alot.

Yes!!!!! Perfect! Easier than my favorite drop biscuits!  Used 4 sticks butter, straight from freezer and microwaved 1 minute, added ice water only as needed (hardly any necessary, but used a pretty big egg and a little extra vinegar by accident).  Used KitchenAid for whole thing (pulsing at the beginning for the first set of ingredients so as not to send them all over the kitchen). Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Patted into pan. Made enough for three-plus 9-inch pies.

I made my first pie crust today! I've been so worried about making one thinking that I was going to have difficulties making it work and none of the bad stuff happened!! It went so smooth that I'm going to make another one just to see if I was dreaming!! This recipe was so wonderful to work with and rolling my first dough was so easy. There is a down side to this wonderful recipe... It means that it will be easier to bake more "FAT PILLS" that I'll "wear" well. LOL!!

This is the first pie crust that I have made successfully.  I used it this morning to make a wheat crust for my Spinach, Mushroom Quiche.  I decreased the sugar in it so it was more appropriate for what I was making.  I will use this from here on out....no more store bought crust for me.

I've given up on homemade pie crust and used only the refrigerated folded crusts.    I wanted to make the pear cheddar pie from this site, but I didn't want to go to the store for crust.  I gave this one a whirl, and I am now back to homemade crust!  Simple, common ingrediants without the rolling makes me a happy pie and quiche baker!

This is a very good recipe. Super quick and super easy. I will definitely make this recipe again. I used it for a chicken pot pie recipe I also got from this site. They both are keepers. My family absolutely loved the homemade chicken pot pie. The next day I used my leftover dough to make dumplings. I just rolled the dough out and cut the dough into small squares, then boiled for 7-10 mins. Then I added the dumplings to the leftover chicken pot pie filling I had, super delicious!!! Thanks for an awesome recipe.

I had my doubts about this crust because of its strong smell of vinegar. Then when it was baking it looked awfully greasy but alas it turned out great. I halved the recipe and had PLENTY for a deep dish 9 inch hubbard squash pie. It is sticky I oiled up my hand to squish it out a bit then ended up greasing a 1 cup measuring cup to press out the sides. Will certainly use this one again when I don't feel like rolling out my regular pie crust.

This crust was yummy, yum, yum!! I found that by using a sheet of wax paper when preparing the top piece, it's much easier to manage. Push out dough to desired thickness on the wax paper, then flip it ontop of the prepared pie. :-) Fabulous crust!!

Excellent crust, sweet and flaky. I found I can't roll it on a floured board because it's too sticky, so it works out great to use fingers and  press dough on wax paper. Other than that I love the taste.

I'd officially sworn off homemade pie crust, but my husband was begging me to try making it again. This recipe is incredible! Very simple, cheap ingredients, and hardly any time at all to make. It was buttery, flaky and excellent.

Excellent, my aunt, who is the family pie baker, was impressed, and she is not easily impressed.  When I told her how easy it was, she said "there is no such thing as easy pie crust."  This recipe proves her wrong.

Great recipe, very easy. I tried this with a lemon meringue pie. I am not sure which was more delicious, the pie or the crust. It holds up very well with heavy fillings, it has a shortbread-like consistency. I am looking forward to trying this with a chicken pot pie.

Recommended to me on the RE, this was sooo very easy to mix..with a fork. For the top I didn't want to cover it so instead I took some previous pics inspiration that I've seen before and used my [[free]] M&M cookie cutters, as well as flower/stars and rolled balls.

Excellent and very easy crust.  I only made half the recipe for one crust and it was so much I will make two crust out of half the recipe next time and roll it out.  I didn't have butter flavored crisco so I used regular, it was still great.

WOW. WOW. WOW. This is the BEST and EASIEST pie crust EVER. It's so flaky and light and delicious. I enjoy baking but have always been intimidated by pie crusts. NEVER AGAIN! I just added the ingredients to my kitchen aid mixer and it came out PERFECTLY. (I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening per others' suggestions.) I pressed the crust in my pie plate and used a blueberry pie filling that I got off of this site (SUPER DUPER EASY using frozen blueberries). Baked it in the oven at 385 degrees for 55 minutes. INCREDIBLE.

Absolutely the best pie crust ever! Everyone loved it and also said it was the best they ever had. But like many others, I roll mine out, it's nice having the option tho.

"Never fail" is very appropriate! I just used this crust for a quiche in Costa Rica-in an 80 degree room with high humididy, an oven I have never cooked in before, using the local substitute for shortening. It was still delicious...

I'm more of a butter-based pie crust kind of gal, but this one is good.  If you've never made a scratch pie crust, or never made it with success, this is the recipe to go with.  It won't let you down.

I used this recipe when making a Mulberry pie. I brush top with butter and sprinkled lightly with cinnamon sugar. This was my first scratch pie crust and was so pleased with the results! I know it will always be the first pie crust recipe I turn to!

This pie crust was easy and delicious. It made lots of dough, so much that I didn't use it all! I switched out the shortening for the same amount of butter. Using butter was the key in making this dough flaky and chewy. I will only ever use this recipe because it turned out so well!

This recipe totally bombed for me - the instructions were unclear and I ended up with dough that was virtually useless. I can count the number of recipes that have reduced me to tears on the fingers of one hand, and this is one of them. Oddly enough, I found a very similar recipe in an old cookbook that worked really well for me, but again, the instructions were much clearer.

This was by far the best pie crust recipe I have ever made.  I had some left over and my husband and kids ate the dough by chunks!  It baked up flaky and flavorful.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I used 1 cup butter and 1 cup butter flavored shortening.  To make the lattice top, I put half in the frig right away to stiff it up a bit to make it easier to cut and handle.  Very easy to make and use and tastes great!

Hmmm, this recipe is a bit strange. The dough consistency is almost like a loose cookie dough that you are supposed to blob into the pan and moosh into place without any rolling. Not sure exactly how you are supposed to create a top crust without rolling. I tried rolling between floured waxed paper like previous reviewers suggested (and had WAY too much dough - could easily make two double-crusted pies with this) and came up with a overly-moist pie crust that was barely manageable. But despite the poor start, it lived up to its name and didn't fail. It tasted good and looked fine, I just wish it was easier to work with.

Great pie crust. I used it for a chicken pot pie and only made an 8x8 so I had some dough left over. I used it to make mini apple pies in my muffin tin. Great thing is you don't need much of a recipe for that because you just make as many as the dough will stretch or only do 2 or 3 at a time and freeze the rest of the dough either rolled out in small discs and put between wax paper or just in a ball. I do this a lot and send the mini pies with my husband for work in his lunch. Thank you for such an easy pie crust.

I'll never buy frozen pie crust again.  I hate, HATE, hate making pie crust.  This recipe was awesome.  It takes no time at all, very little effort, and contains most of the ingredients you already have in your house.   VERY easy.

I had never made a pie crust before because I didn't want to bother...but one day I ended up without one and unable to make it to the store...this recipe was a life-saver and it was so good that I will be using it from now on instead of buying pie crusts!  It was so easy and I loved that you didn't even have to roll it out, just press it in the pan!

This was so easy to make!  My first pie crust!  I used it for the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe on this website and it turned out very yummy!  I used half shortening and half butter because I didn't have enough shortening.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and rolled it between two floured sheets of waxed paper.  I should've rolled it a bit thinner but it was still very good!

I have never made a pie before, and this made it very easy for me to make a great first pie. Very easy to make, and I was able to roll out the dough. The trick is to use wax paper and extra flower, to help it not stick to the paper. I made an apple pie using a recipe on allrecipes.com called Apple Pie by Grandma Ople. It made a great combo.

This recipe is more involved and messy than some others that I have tried, however it always pays off.  When I make half the recipe using a whole egg, I usually have enough dough for one 9" pie shell and 10 tarts.  I'll continue to make the same amount of dough each time, so I have an excuse to make butter tarts with the leftover dough. :)

Fantastic first time scratch crust. It has a short bread like flavor, and was well liked by all. I used it for both pumkin pies and a rasin pie, and it was great. I still have to master the art of rolling out a crust, for pies that use an upper crust, but I would heartily recommend this recipe to anyone.

This is good if you're pressed for time.  The crust is easy to make and has a wonderful taste and texture, but it's so flaky that most of it sticks to the pie pan.  Don't try using your hands to mix it, but use wet hands to press into plate.  This makes more than enough dough for deep-dish pies.  I might try it again and spray cooking spray on the plate first to see if it helps prevent sticking.

This worked well for the original serving size of 16. I wasn't able to roll it out without it sticking to the rolling pin but it worked out when I just shaped it into the pie pan. I've never had a successful pie crust but this one would be close. The flavor is good and it's flaky but I would like to be able to roll it out with the rolling pin. I'll keep practicing.

This pie crust was easy and it rolled out very nice. The texture and look of it was perfect but the taste just wasn't there for me. I'm not ready to throw this recipe out entirely so I think next time I will try real butter and see if that helps.

the ne thing missing with this recipe is the fact that you really need to roll it out and what size pie crusts it makes. with one recipe i made a 9 inch, 12 inch and still had a cup of dough left. a pretty easy to make thing just not much info in the actual recipe.

FANTASTIC!!  Since moving to the UK I have had to modify a lot of recipes that call for good ol' Crisco.  For this one it was so easy!  I have made this crust both for an apple pie and a chicken pot pie - it works either way.  When I made it for the apple filling, I did add a bit more sugar.  Instead of shortening I used Trex.  I needed only 1 crust, so I used 1 cup of Trex.  (I didn't weigh it - sorry) For this recipe I would disregard the note on the Trex package which tells you to use 20% less than you would for butter.  This was light and flaky even though my filling was very watery.  The crust was not soggy at all!!  Will try all butter next time.

Not crazy about this recipe.  This is not like a regular pie crust.  The amount of shortening in this causes it to be extremely soft and sticky.  I had to keep adding flour just to get it where I could work with it.  If you are looking for something similiar to a regular pie crust keep looking.  If looking for something to use as a cobbler crust that you just pat in the bottom this could work.  I will not make this again.

Love this recipe! I have never made a crust from scratch before. This was super easy and a huge hit. Kind of has the consistency of shortbread. I used the hint from another review... use cold, wet hands to pat into the pie pan. I used a deep-dish, glass pie pan for baking.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.....I've been baking for almost 30 years.....and had yet to find a GREAT pie crust recipe......This recipe was so good, that I tossed all my other crust recipes......It's perfect, holds up well to any type pie. Sometimes, if I don't have 2 cups butter flavored shortening, I use 1 cups buttered shortening, and 1 cup plain shortening.  It comes together so nicely and rolls out so easily......Thank you Mary Roahrig!!!!!

This was a wonderful pie crust. Light and flaky. When I made it into a lemon meringue pie the whole family loved it!  Thank-you. :)

Perfect pie crust.  I love to cook and have tried to make my own crust several times and just wasn't too impressed.  When the Fall weather kicked in a bit this week, I decided to make an apple pie with REAL crust.  I spotted this recipe because it said I didn't need to roll out the dough and decided to try it.  I am sooooo glad I did - this will be my crust recipe for life.  I like a thicker crust, this will make three pies.  Tried it with a sour cream apple pie and the Brown Family Pumpkin pie which I've made before and didn't think it could get any more delicious - well a homemade crust does make the difference!  Make up the dough and freeze the extra...of course, I haven't had to freeze any...my family us loving the pies coming out of the kitchen this week :)

This recipe worked well.  I rolled it out, and it turned out beautifully.  I have a silicone pie mat, and I used waxed paper on top, it rolled out fine.
Excellent crust, flaky and light.
I will definitly use this recipe again.

To be honest, I didn't have high hopes for this pie crust. The dough seemed too wet, and I figured it would be dense. When I served the quiche that this crust was the base of, everyone commented on how flaky and buttery it was! It really came out excellent. I'm using it again for a strawberry tart!

Pie crust and I do not get along. However, the taste was great. I dusted vanilla sugar on top before baking. It was very flaky and sweet.

Flakiest crust I've ever made! I halved the recipe, since I was only making one pie, and it was plenty. Goes fabulously with the  Sour Cream Apple Pie Deluxe recipe also found on this site!

Great! Love the fact that I don't have to roll the crust. Cut the recipe back to 8 servings and still made enough for two quiche. Only used 1/2 tsp vinegar (made quiche for my mum and she hates vinegar.) Light and flaky. Wish I had known a long time ago how easy pie crust could be. BTW! Mum was very impressed!

Really easy to roll out, and pick up.  Will defenatly use this recipe again.  At first the egg kinda through me off.  but I'm guessing that it helps hold it together.  Pies still in the oven, but the cinnimon rolls turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe. :) (I split the batch and made into two balls and froze for about a half hour, then rolled out.)

My grandmother gave me this recipe when I got married 20 years ago, and it's been in my family for MANY years.  I think the only difference was that her recipe had two tablespoons of vinegar, but it gave the crust a slightly sour bite that goes perfectly with a sweet filling.  I've always refrigerated it for a few hours before rolling, and it rolls beautifully.  I've not tried using it straight after making.

Awsome.  I halved the recipe, chilled the dough a bit in the fridge, and rolled out two crusts for the "salmon pie" recipe on this site.  Very flaky and good...OH - I also used regular shortening and it turned out great.

This recipe makes an excellent light flaky pie crust.  I have made it many times and always get compliments on it. I didn't give it five stars because it is quite difficult to work with. It's a very wet sticky dough (if you reduce the water, the dough gets tough). Good luck!  It's worth the effort.

Love this easy, flaky crust recipe. It is a little sticky, on the rolling pin, even after refrigerating for a couple hours, but a light dusting of flour helps that.  I took the advice of other commenters, and tried to use this recipe for two full pies, but it was a little too thin for 2 x 9" pies.  I will multiply by 1.5 next time to make two pies.

I have been using this recipe for a LONG time. I use my food processor, takes about 5 minutes start to finish. For savory pies I add a pinch more Sea salt and ground white pepper, omitting the sugar. For the sweet pies a couple pinches of cinnamon. Always rave reviews, and turns out every time!

Great crust each and every time. A tip for those of you who may be struggling with the consistency of the crust, make it half an hour before hand or more and put it in the fridge. It'll be much easier to work with when it's older. I roll out this dough every time after freezing. It's extremely easy to work with and cuts down the time it takes me to make mini chicken pot pies. I've also used this crust for fruit pies. I add a little bit more sugar or add a little less depending on the type of pie. It's my favorite crust recipe!

I am 38 and I've been looking for pie crust recipes my whole life. I've failed miserably so many times that I usually just buy the premise. I felt confident and thought I'd give it another try. This one was super easy and it is delicious. It is very flaky and lights and yummy. I will be making this forever now. Thank you thank you. This recipe makes enough for almost 3 pie crusts maybe even four.

This is the best pie crust I have ever made and I bake quite frequently. Out of habit I always roll out pie dough and even rolled out this crust came out great.  I also prefer real butter instead of butter flavor shortening so that is the only change I made purely due to my own preferences.

When I first made the crust, it was VERY pasty. I was letting my 6 year old help me, so once everything was made up, I added probably another 1/4 of flour - it was humid out, even with our AC running - and the crust came together PERFECTLY. Keep in mind when you make this crust the humidity - just like bread and other baked goods, humidity can affect pie crust. Even though my Grandma's no fail piecrust didn't use vinegar, eggs, or sugar, I like this one JUST as much...and hers was amazing!

I didn't have butter flavored shortening but it didn't matter, It was amazing with regular shortening. No fail is right because I fail on most dough type stuff unless I use the bread maker :) I made a quiche with it and I still had enough left over to make homemade chicken pot pie. Enough crust for the bottom and top! I made the dough with the intention of using it the same night but I was short of eggs so I wrapped it and put it in the fridge. Rolled out great the next day (Quiche for lunch, pot pie for dinner) Thank you Mary for this fantastic recipe

I've made this crust a few times and it really is no fail. It is by far the best tasting crust I've ever made. It is a little hard to work with because it is not very firm, but it can literally be pressed into the pie plate. It is well worth the extra effort and works in both sweet and savory pies. Thank you for posting Mary!

Tried this last night for a chicken pot pie.  It was the easiest pie crust I've ever made, and I've been making pies for 40+ years.  I did roll it out between two pieces of wax paper (floured) because I wanted a thin even crust.  It baked to an even golden color, and was flaky and delicious.  My husband loved it, and had two huge helpings!  I don't think I'll ever make pie crust any other way.  (The only change I made was to use regular vegetable shortening as that is what was in my pantry.)

I use this crust EVERY time I bake. It is a little more like a cookie kind of crust as opposed to a flakey kind... but it is ALWAYS a hit! Super easy... Freezes well... and YUMMY!

this recipe worked better for me using 1 cup butter flavored shortening than 2 cups.  Maybe it's because I live at a higher altitude???  Great pie crust!

Absolutely invaluable recipe. Quick, easy and amazingly delicious. All these yrs w/ quiches, pies and alike insufferable precooking step bye-bye :)
1/8/11 changed the shortening: 1/2 cup used butter and the rest canola oil. The crust turned out moist and light, but I had to piece it together when putting into the casserole dish for a pot pie...raw, it looked like the skin of the Thing from the Fantastic Four'. Once cooked, appearance improved and tasted yummy.

Made way more crust than needed and when baked the crust shrank completely off the sides - made it very thick on bottom and only about 1/2 inch up sides.  Had to remake crust because if I had put filling in, it would have looked like there was no crust at all.  Very disappointing.

Very easy and delicious.  Makes more than 2 crusts.  I followed another's post and halved the recipe, using the whole egg and less water.  Baked to a beautiful golden brown.  It is a heavier crust, and I'll probably use less shortening next time.  Recipe is a keeper.

This pie crust was easy to work with and tasted good, but did not work well in my deep dish pie pan, the sides melted right to the bottom.  I also had problems with it cracking and seperating while baking in a regular pie pan.  I have made this twice now both rolled out and pressed in, and it was hit or miss both times.  I only got one pie shell to turn out, but when it did it was good.  I was really hoping this was going to be my new recipe, but not gonna happen.

Super easy pie crust, and I'm not a skilled pie crust baker. I made this crust the day before I needed it and tossed it in the fridge in plastic wrap. The following morning I did roll it out and it did so very easily. The ingredients and measurements were right on and my guests loved this crust used for the Maple Pumpkin Pie Supreme!

A wonderful, easy pie crust! I love this recipe because the dough is not as delicate as some other recipes and is a lot more forgiving and easier to handle. Will definitely make this again!

WOW!   This was my VERY first time making pies - and they came out WONDERFUL, with an amazing crust!  I added a tsp of vanilla - as well as substituted a quality aged balsamic - since I didn't have distilled white... and it still came out REALLY really good!  Thank you SO much for posting this, I'll definitely be using it MUCH more in the future!!

I was skeptical of this recipe, but it turned out pretty good.  I was overwhelmed by how much dough it made.  I had enough for 3 single crust pies.  I might cut the recipe in half next time.  This crust was especially nice because I didn't have to roll it out for the pies I made.  I'll probably use this again during the busy holidays.

I was pie-crust phobic until I tried this recipe. It's very easy and the results are excellent. It's not a flaky pie crust, like the traditional recipes, but it's very flavorful and easy to work with. I have made this four times now and found it works best when everything is fully chilled.  It also helps to cut the shortening into cubes before mixing it in.  There has always been some dough leftover, so I started making "pop tarts" with it.  Any pie filling or jam works great.  Just bake at 400 for 10-15 minutes until brown.  Thanks to Mary for this recipe!

I wanted an easier pie crust, so I tried this one.  I wanted to make only one crust, so I started out with 1/2 the ingredients.  But I got distracted and ended up adding 1/2 cup ice water.  Immediately, I realized what had happened.  Nothing to loose, I went back and added everything else to make two crusts.  I never thought it would turn out.  I chilled it just a bit and rolled it out.  I first made an old-fashioned egg custard pie.  Halfway through baking, the electricity went out.  When it came back on about 30 minutes later, I just finished the baking time.  I was absolutely stunned at how good the crust turned out.  I made a pecan pie with the other crust and that one was just as good.  After all the mess, I totally didn't expect it to turn out.  Flakey good.  I can't wait for peaches to come in so I can try this one out in peach cobbler!

This is an awesome pie crust!! I know it says this is a no roll crust, but I rolled it. The first time, it wasn't that great - I had to patch it up all over. I should have added some flour. I tasted wonderful, baked up so nice and flakey! So the second pie...added some extra flour, and that did the trick. When making just a single double crust, I change the servings to 9 or 10 so that I know I have just a little extra crust for when I am rolling it out. The first pie I made, Fresh Rhubarb Pie from this site, I had the trouble with piecing the crust together - especially on the top crust. But the second pie, Apple Pie I, I made a lattice top pie. Oh my gosh...that was so easy and it looked wonderful! My husband and teenagers said that my pies tasted better than my mother in law's, and she makes pies all the time. They made me feel good, even if they exaggerated a bit!

This recipe just didn't work for me.  I followed the recipe and it just seemed like there was way too much shortening in it. Also, I cut the recipe in half and I had a lot of dough left over. I'm not sure how thick the crust is suppose to be with this one.  It came out very flaky... too flaky as it was just falling apart :( I will try it again with less shortening naxt time.

I didn't have butter flavored shortening so used 1 cup crisco and 1 cup butter. I had to add some extra flour, I think because of the butter. I thought I was going to make it tough because I kept having to work more flour in, but it melts in your mouth!

This is good but found it had to much shortening so will decrease it by 1/4 cup next time.

Finally I made a good crust!!!! I followed the recipe exactly (except cut in half) I was needing a crust for a 9 1/2 in pan and this recipe halved was enough for two.  Rolling the crust out thin is important.  I didnt take time to roll it out evenly and after it baked it had areas that were really thick.  I made a fudge (brownie) pie and this crust complemented it well.

I like the texture of this crust when it is baked. But the process of putting the crust in the baking dish is a pain. It is so sticky and kind of watery. SO, I am not sure what is wrong with mine when I make it. But I have made it twice and it has been the same problem.

I never made a pie before, and yes, it did take a while. However, i didn't make a single mistake, and everyone said that it was great.

I dont like to make pie crust from scratch, but this is by far easy and delicious. I even mailed it to my mom in Texas.

I have never made a crust that came out flaky and perfect like this.  This is seriously the best!  I did find it a little salty, so you may want to reduce the salt just a tad.  I increased sugar to 2T to counteract some of the salt.
