This was a refreshing change from the standard turkey leftover options- which is why I tried it. That said, I'd prefer a little more flavour and a little less sugar. I'll try adding a nice dose of fresh chopped garlic and ginger and reducing the sugar to 1 tablespoon the next time if I have left over turkey on hand. It might also be nice with real black bean sauce too (fermented black beans mashed with minced garlic and ginger)
Note: Instructions don't mention what to do with the onions - I sauteed mine before adding the veggies and the stock to the pan.

This was wonderful to my surprise and such a nice change to the traditional high calorie leftover recipes.  I served it over rice. The only change I made was to add cashews after plating to add some crunch. THIS IS A KEEPER.

This was pretty easy to make and came out super yummy. My partner definitely liked it and I will probably have to double up on the ingredients next time (to have some leftovers.). I omitted the onions and I think next time I might add some snap peas or bell peppers.

Great, easy recipe. I added a dash of soy sauce and a pinch of garlic powder at the very end to boost the flavour. Drizzled a very small amount of that peanut sauce on the top. Delicious! I will definitely make this again and play around with different flavours.

Relatively easy to make and quick-to-fix during a busy week. We served it up using our leftover stuffing as the "rice" underneath. What a delightful mix. Serve with a side of cranberries to get that slight bit of sweetness, which compliments the saltiness of the soy sauce. Makes great for a heavy serving for two, and then something leftover for the next day at lunch.

This was a delicious way to use up left over Thanksgiving turkey.  I added celery and bell pepper, increased the (homemade turkey) broth, and extended the sauce with some oyster sauce.  Sprinkled with pecans and served over rice.  Very glad to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Very good, easy use for leftover TG turkey. It reminds me of the American Chop Suey my Mom used to make. I would increase the veggies next time and try cashews or peanuts too. I think 1 T sugar would be enough...or none. So filling, like comfort food.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. My family absolutely loved it!!! I didn't have chicken broth so I used a tub of knorr mixed in a cup of water I also did not use mushrooms. My husband and my daughter went for thirds. I am not a cook and this recipe is amazing and was not difficult.

I'm in love with this! have made it twice in a week. The only changes I made was to increase the liquids as I added cooked noodles directly to the stir fry (I didn't want it too dry) and added kale because I had it. This is an awesome way to use leftover turkey. Also, you can make it as spicy as you like.
