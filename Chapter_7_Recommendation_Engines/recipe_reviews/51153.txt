Based on all the rave reviews, I was really shocked and disappointed at how this dish turned out.  My husband and I followed all the directions except we did not have scallions, but scallions would not have saved this dish.  This dish is just *way* too sour!  It was unedible.  Even after we tried to "fix" it, it still tasted like Key Lime Fish.  So unless you really, really love lime, use maybe 1/4 the amount of lime juice that is specified in the recipe.  You can always add more if it's not enough for your taste.

Awesome flavor!  I substituted about 1 lb. sautéed mushrooms for half the porcini & used olive oil instead of butter.  I'll definitely make this one again.

I used regular fresh brown mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe ingredients and directions. The dish turned out better than I expected.  Remember to trim the red lateral line meat out of the fillet and trim all silvery stuff off of the fish too.  These are the parts of the fish that will give the meal an "off" or "fishy" taste.

This is a great recipe.  I used regular white mushrooms and sauted them in butter, olive oil and fresh garlic before adding the fish. I let the mushrooms cook until they were almost carmalized. Very simple and elegant. Great with roasted red potatoes.  Will definately make this again and will try different varities of mushrooms.

What a perfect meal for a 90+ degree day!  Light and refreshing.  I used regular button mushrooms instead of porcini.  Next time, I am going to add white wine and capers to the butter, lemon, lime sauce.  Just for a little kick.  I may also double the "sauce" since my fiance was practically licking his plate to get every last drop!

Really good, quick and easy.  Like others I made changes based upon what I had on hand.  What I did: Sauteed green onions with a box of fresh sliced white mushrooms in 1 1/2 T Magarine and set aside. Used 4 defrosted tilapia fillets (from Sam's Club)1 1/2 T more of margarine, salted, peppered, zest per recipe, but used 1/4 c bottled lime juice.  Added mushrooms back in after turning fish. Served with garlic butter rice (Uncle Ben's!) and fresh brussel sprouts. YUM!

I loved the idea of this recipe. I gave it 5* even though I had to make some changes it was still pretty good. I cooked 8 oz. fresh white mushrooms in some butter and then added 1 1/2 lbs. tilapia. I added more butter to fish. I didn't have lemon zest or green onion and it was still tasty. I also used coarse sea salt instead of kosher. I will try to add the zest next time, I bet it gives it a nice zing! We loved the lime flavor and I would increase that the next time to accomodate the larger amout of fish. This was so fast and easy especially after a long day at work! Thanks BGP!

Very good!  I substituted about 2 cups fresh portobella mushrooms for the dried porcini, and shallots for the scallions (just because these were the ingredients I had on hand).  I cooked this in a large frying pan with a cover, so after the first side of the fish was done, I flipped it over, dumped the mushrooms in, and then put the cover on.  This kind of steamed it all.  IMO, this recipe only makes 2 servings, though.

I make this on a regular basis. I have made a few changes to the recipe. Since we love lemons, I replaced the limes with lemons, and I don't use the zest. I also use either canned or sliced fresh white mushrooms, and I experimented until I was happy with the amount of mushrooms and green onions I use, which is many more than called for, because we like the topping, and I also like to saute the onion and mushrooms in the pan 1st , then take them out of the pan and set them aside, and cook the fish, then re-top the fish after it's cooked. I serve the fish with Sante Fe Rice. It's a pre-cooked rice by ( I think ) Uncle Bens. Awesome meal! 5 stars!

In a word INCREDIABLE!!!  I made only a few changes, I decreased the lime from two to one, I used fresh mushrooms, and I added Emeril's Original Essence.  It was awesome.  I will make this again often.  My family loved it.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Followed the recipe as stated. The only change I made was added a splash of white wine as the fish cooked. Delicious! My husband loved it and he hates eating fish.

What a wonderful recipe for tilapia. I varied it slightly by reducing the amount of lime (after reviewing other users' comments) and did not use lemon zest since I didn't have any. Also, I sauteed the mushrooms separately in olive oil, onions, garlic and white wine, and added a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce to the mushrooms right at the end. When the tilapia was finished (only took a few minutes on each side), I piled the mushroom mixture on top of the fish. The light tomato flavor blended really well with the light lime-flavored tilapia. Served on a bed of sauteed kale with mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy on the side.

I really like mushrooms and am also a fan of tilapia.  This was good but didn't wow me like I expected.  I know I will try this again.  (Unfortunately there are not very many recipes for this kind of fish.)  I might try to spice it up a bit or experiment a bit.  Thanks for posting.

My husband and I weren't huge fans of this dish... We thought a creamier sauce would have more complimentary to the tilapia, next time we will try more butter and maybe some olive oil to thicken it up. Worth a try though, the lime taste is very different and gave me ideas for other dishes....

Outstanding!  EASY and I thought it was a really nice presentation and would use it for company!  I served it with 4 spears of Asparagus across the top of the fish and some rice or potato and you've got an amazingly delicious and easy dinner that everyone will love (as long as they eat mushrooms)!

This recipe was easy, but not thrilling. Tilapia is a rather bland fish and I feel that this recipe didn't add enough flavor, but I would make it again if I was in a pinch and needed a quick fish dish, because it's quick and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.

I didn't use mushrooms but served with Mushroom Rice Pilaf from this site.  I used 4 thin tilapia fillets and only 1 lime and this had a very excellent taste!

Not my favorite Tilapia recipe. I was a little disappointed by the flavor. It was not as good as the others seemed to think. I did use sliced button mushrooms since I did ot have porcini, and that could be why it was not as good.

I loved this, but I love citrus.  I did not use the lemon zest & only the juice of one lime. I sauted the mushrooms & garlic first then set them aside and tossed it with minced chives.  When I flipped the tilapia I spooned the mushroom mixture over the fish to reheat.  I served this dish with steamed carrots.  My 6 & 4 yr olds ate every last bite!

i'm not a big fish fan but i do want my kids to eat and like it so i try to at least do a white fish meal every once in awhile.  i enjoyed this recipe and did not find it overly lemon-y as others stated.  in fact, i wish that i had added more zest!  the husband loved it and the kids ate every bite.

My daughter made this for our dinner tonight, it was very good! The name says it all - VERY zesty. We used fresh mushrooms and so, cooked them right at the beginning with the fish. Our small fillets cooked quite fast... maybe 3 minutes each side. She served it with roasted asperagus and red potatos. I will make this again!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I used shitake mushrooms that I had on hand.  Poured the rehydrating liquid in the pan with the mushrooms.  I also wilted in some fresh spinach at the very last.  Served with wild rice blend and and apple for a very quick, delicious meal.

Very good. I used canned mushrooms instead though. It tastes just like it sounds...like lemon zesty mushrooms.

This was excellent.  It took 15 minutes from start to cleanup!  I used fresh normal mushrooms instead of the porcini's which I first sauteed in garlic and olive oil.

This recipe was tasty goodness.  When making it, however, I removed the cooked tilapia from the skillet before sautéing the mushrooms and scallions.

Loved this tilapia recipe.  I did use fresh mushrooms since I had them on hand.  So quick and easy, I had diner ready in no time.  This will go into my dinner rotation for sure.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

This is probably the best recipe on this site that I've tried so far.  I couldn't find wild-caught tilapia, and I'm very new to fish, so I ended up with mahi mahi instead.  I don't really like strong flavored fish, so this was a huge mistake on my part.  That said, despite not liking the fish itself, the recipe was so good that I liked the dish anyway!  I wish I could give it 10 stars.  It was a perfect combination of lemon and mushrooms (although I went with baby portabellas -- I don't think that change affected the recipe much).  I could still taste the fish, but it was fine because of the way it blended with the other ingredients.  I suppose if you don't like a strong lemon/lime flavor, you might not like this recipe.  For me, it will always be my go-to recipe if I ever choose a stronger fish again.  I am thinking of trying it with salmon, and, of course, tilapia!

We generally don't like fish unless it is Mrs. Paul's, so I am happy to find a recipe that we like that is healthy too.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

Very tasty.  I substituted crimini mushrooms for the porcini and used olive oil instead of butter.  I also only used 1 lime.  It was just right.

Really good, but I made some adjustments. I first sauteed the mushrooms with some onions in a little bit of oil. While that was sauteing, I took two tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and some cilantro and put that together in a bowl and melted it in a microwave, and then took the mushrooms out of the skillet and put the melted butter cilantro lemon juice into there, and then put the tilapia in with it. After I flipped the tilapia, I put the mushrooms back in and put the green onions.

Very good, very flavorful. Maybe next time we will try a little white wine to go in with the mushrooms and green onions at the end.

I was a bit disappointed with this, but it's worth another try.  I found it to be way too "zesty" so I would cut the lemon and lime in half (at least!) I ended up having to add more butter to offset the sour taste.  The porcini mushrooms weren't that great for me, but I think any type of mushroom would work well.  In all, it was very quick to make, and it's a very healthy dish!!

This is the best recipe I've found for tilapia.  I used plain old mushrooms and lots more green onion. My husband really liked it. I'm having it for guests who haven't tasted this fish yet. A keeper!

This was a wonderful and very easy recipe. My husband loved it, although he wasn't wild about the porcini mushrooms. Next time I will saute regular button mushrooms and use them instead. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an excellent dish, and easily applicable to other types of mild-flavored fish.  Our grocer didn't have tilapia the day I decided to try this recipe out, so I bought flounder instead, and used baby portabella mushrooms (I couldn't locate porcini, either).  It was still wonderful, and my family loved it - I think that the sauce is the key, the right amounts of butter and lime combined with a hint of lemon and the mild bite of the green onions.  Try it, you will NOT be disappointed!

Different, but good.  I just sprayed the pan with nonstick spray and left out the butter in order to make it healthier.  I also used fresh button mushrooms and it was really good.

Family declared this their favorite fish dish so far. I used 3 filets instead of 2, but it turned out just fine anyway. I also used about 6 oz of an 8oz pack of fresh white mushrooms—cleaned, dried and sliced—instead of the dried porcini mushrooms. I tucked them under the fish and sauté them around the fish during that last 5 minutes. My pan was small enough to where the mushrooms might’ve ended up sitting on the fish and not getting cooked as beautifully, if I left them alone. (That was probably the only issue with 3 filets in the pan instead of 2.)  For the reviewer that said this was sour…I used small fresh limes that weren’t especially juicy. We had no issues with sourness. Will make this one again.

I sautéed fresh mushrooms and added the green onion towards the end before I combined it with the fish. I used same amount of lime but cooked 5 fillets instead of 2. Was really flavorful and yummy! Loved it!

Great new way to make tilapia.  I put the rehydrated mushrooms in a food processor before I added to pan and then served the mushroom/green onion mixture as topping for the tilapia.  I will make more topping next time as it tasted so go with every bite of fish.

I don't usually alter recipes but I had to use what I had on hand. I seasoned the tilapia with blackened redfish seasoning. I sauteed shallots and fresh baby bella mushrooms in butter and deglazed the pan with a little white wine. Then added the fish and lime juice with a little more butter. It was delicious and I didn't have to go to the store!

I'm going to try this recipe again exactly as written to see if I can get a better result.    I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand.

First change was to use the lime zest instead of lemon zest.   Hubby didn't like it said it was too strong a lime flavor.   So, I'm hoping that the lemon zest will mellow out the lime flavor a bit.

Second change was to use a package of stir-fry mix dried mushrooms.   I don't this this changed the recipe much and it gave it an interesting look.

Last change was to use 4 4oz filets and not cut them in half.   I think 2oz serving per person isn't enough.

I'll update my review when we try this one again.

This was very good!  I followed the instructions (I believe) directly and thought everything worked out well for the most part.  Once the fish was done, I scooped it out and cooked the mushrooms and onion down a bit more and then served over rice.  Next time I'll cook down the onions and mushrooms beforehand and then add the fish seperately by itself to cook in the juices.

Delicious way to make tilapia. I have made this several times, using different types of mushrooms (baby bellas, white, crimini). I usually serve with rice and asparagus. A very healthy and satisfying meal.

I love this recipe. I don't like fish very much, but I was trying to eat healthier and had bought some tilapia.  I experimented w/ a few recipes, but this was the best by far. The only thing I changed was halving the lime I used as others had suggested, otherwise I didn't change a thing. It was out of this world.

I really enjoyed this dish. I was using frozen tilapia, and it really flavored it well. I changed the recipe a bit since I didn't have any lemons or limes. I simply put lemon juice in and no zest. It was quite tasty. I also used olive oil instead of butter as I saw on other recipes. Prepared some sauteed zucchini and wild rice for a side. Very yummy!

I really liked this recipe.  It was delicious!  The only thing I did differently like a lot of other reviewers was used fresh sliced mushrooms.  I thought the lemon zest was delicious and the green onions and mushrooms mixed in were tasty.  Next time though I will probably try to cook with a cooking spray a maybe a little olive oil to cut back on the calories from the butter.  I paired with wild rice and it was a great meal ... will make again soon!

My husband couldn't stop raving about this!  I used regular mushrooms sauted in a little olive oil and didn't have any lemon zest, but it turned out fantastic anyways.  It does have a very limey flavor, so if you don't love limes, this probably wouldn't be good for you.  We had it with "Mushroom Rice" from allrecipes.com which complemented the fish very nicely.

I used lemon juice because I didnt have lime. Also used regular button mushrooms sliced with green onions. Really nice dish, great flavor. Served with brussel sprouts.

This recipe was good!!  The fish was tasty and moist.  The only thing I substituted was lemon juice for the lemon zest (my family is not big on zests). I'll be making this again!

Overall, very good!  However, our attempt at this had a bit too strong of a citrus flavor.  I think that could be eliminated by specifying a quantity of lime juice, not just "juice from two limes."  I think we just juiced our limes too well!  :)

I love tilapia, I love porcini mushrooms, but this was not a good combination.  The soft texture of the mushrooms and the fish turned me off.  I read the other reviews prior to cooking, cut down the lime, and didn't even use any lemon zest, but I still thought the citrus  was too strong and disagreed with the woody mushroom flavor.

I thought this recipe was good but it could've used a little less lemon & lime flavoring. I would have used 1 lime instead of 2.

We didn't like this much at all. The fish was way too fishy for our liking, and the rehydrated mushrooms were slimey and unpleasant. The lemon and lime flavors worked well, but if I made this again it would be with something like cod, and I would use regular mushrooms.

I made a few changes based on other reviews.  What resulted was very good.  I used white mushrooms, cut the lime juice in half, and seasoned with Emeril's Essence.  One comment about suggested cooking time.  This fish cooks very fast and is easy to overcook.  The suggested cooking time is to long.

This was my first time cooking fish and it turned out so well! I added garlic salt and garlic powder and doubled the butter used, we had it with roasted asparagus and it was a perfect dinner. This is a great beginner-friendly recipe and I'll definitely be making it again!

Turned out better than I expected. I put in half the lime juice, and it turned out great, but on the edge of too much lime. Another change was that I used fresh mushrooms.

This recipe is delicious and easily adaptable to what’s on hand.  I sautéed baby Bella mushrooms, yellow onion, and minced garlic in smart balance.  I put the tilapia in a sprayed glass dish, squirted some bottled lime juice on top, added salt, pepper and seafood seasoning; and topped it all with the sautéed ingredients.  I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes, and served it with Quinoa and fresh veggies.  Four thumbs up from the hubby and myself!

This was really delicious! I substituted with lemon juice because that's all I had , but I thought it still tasted great. It maybe was a little bit blander than my taste- maybe next time I'll add some more herbs and spices- but overall, I would recommend this tilapia recipe. 

I sauteed the mushrooms beforehand (and they were not porcini mushrooms... just common mushrooms) with garlic, butter and olive oil, which made the mushrooms delicious and flavorful. We put this finished dish on top of rice with a side of glazed carrots, and it was a great summer dinner!

I HATE fish but my sister loves it. So I made this for her birthday dinner. I changed to Portabella mushrooms and lemon juice instead of zest. IT WAS FABULOUS!!!! I have made it 3 times now and I'm in love! I put it on long grain wild rice. I would eat this every week. So easy to make too!

We really enjoyed this unusual treatment of white fish.  It's title is appropriate - it is quite zesty.  The only change I made was substituting fresh mushrooms for dehydrated.  I served it with radishes and carrots sauteed with butter, thyme and lemon juice and rice.  Next time, I would make more of the mushroom "sauce" and spoon it over rice.

this dish was absolutely amazing. instead of using lime Puccini mushrooms and green onions we subbed 1C button  chopped button mushrooms, 1 julienned yellow onion and lemon juice. The mushrooms and onions with sauteed separately then added at the very end of cooking. Instead of only using butter we use half a cup of olive oil and cooked the fish at a medium heat so that it poached  the fish with amazing flavor.

I used dried mushrooms pretty often, so I was curious to see if anyone used the liquid from re-hydrating them.  The first few reviews I read, no one used the dried mushrooms.  No wonder they thought the flavor was less than exciting.  Dried mushrooms have a very distinctive flavor and add a lot to this dish.  I added a little of the water from the mushrooms in the last step and it added a lot of flavor to the fish.

This was so tasty! I used regular white mushrooms as it's what I had on hand. I sauteed them with fresh garlic and butter, removed from the pan. Then added a little more butter and the tilapia filets. Browned on one side, then squeezed in the juice of one lime. Flipped and continued to cook, seasoned with onion powder and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Added mushrooms back to the pan. YUM!

Definitely will make this again! Very light and healthy. I used just regular mushrooms that I had chopped it up. Next time, I will sauté the green onions and mushrooms before I add the tilapia to soften them up and flavor them a bit more. Great recipe!

This was very tasty, pretty easy, low calorie so it will become a regular although I'm not sure it's in the ALL TIME FAVS category.

I did modify it.  First based on a comment I used 1/2 the lime juice figuring I could add more later, which I didn't think it needed. It was nicely tart without being over powered with 1/2 the lime juice and the test of one lemon for 3 talapia fillets.

Second, I used regular white mushrooms which I sauted in a little bit of olive oil in a hot heavy frying pan till they were brown, and soft but not soggy.

Third, I had no scallions, the dish survived without them.

Fourth, I had a can of hearts of palm open so I sliced them and added them with the mushrooms. They took up the seasoning nicely and I'm going to include them next time too. 

Fifth - on a diet - no butter, just the smallest amount of olive oil so the fish didn't stick.

This was a perfect combo. I sauteed an onion and the mushrooms first, removed those from the pan and then cooked the fish. Just before it was totally done, I put the mushrooms back in.

Dried mushrooms were chewy and disgusting.  I recommend using canned mushrooms instead.  Other than that, the fish tasted great.

This was very good. The citrus flavor was pretty strong, but I liked it. I used 3 Tbs lime juice and 1 Tbs lemon juice from a bottle as I didn't have fresh on hand.  Maybe that was more than I should have used. I will definitley make it again, and next time try w/ the fresh citrus. I also used fresh sliced mushrooms from the produce dept. Looked all over and couldn't find dried porcini. Thanks-always looking for a new way to make Tilapia

The lime makes it great. This is an easy way to cook talapia. I used button mushrooms but am looking forward to using other kinds of mushrooms.

Wonderful.  Homerun @ my house.  The only thing I did differently was saute mushrooms, green onion & a tsp of minced garlic together b4 cooking the fish, and added them back in after flipping the fish.  Topped with a cajun spice.

This recipe was way too zesty if not paired with rice or some serious carbs. Made this exactly like the recipe said except used potabella mushrooms. Also added some crushed red pepper which helped tone down the zest a bit (but not enough). Next time I will cut out the lemon zest and not use as much lime.

My husband is not a fish fan, but loved this recipe! We cooked it on a smoker instead of a frying pan and without butter- to reduce fat and such. I used lemon juice and lime juice(the kind in the little bottles) and put the mushrooms in an aluminum packet right beside on the smoker. It took a little longer to cook, but I think it was worth it. Next time we are adding onions and garlic to the mushrooms. The best part is my husband and son loved it so much- they are both ready for seconds! Thanks!

Great recipe! I just used "regular" mushrooms, and sauteed them. Also, next time I will probably omit the green onions as I generally don't care for them. Thanks for the great recipe!

Mmmm mmmm good.  I thought my husband was going to start drooling.. we both loved this.  The only thing I changed was that I used baby portabella mushrooms instead of porcini.  When I was cooking, I didn't think it really needed mushrooms and onions added to it, but they were a WONDERFUL addition!  They went really well with the fish.  The pepper, lemon zest, and lime juice really gave this a nice spicy zing.  I didn't expect it to be quite so spicy, in fact, but I loved it.  Yum!
