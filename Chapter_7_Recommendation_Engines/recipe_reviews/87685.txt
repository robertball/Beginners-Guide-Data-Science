Okay - don't like it with the beer. Even tried it topped with cheese. But add Cream Soda to it - WOW! Now I use soda for the liquid with all my pancakes; even a mix recipe. Makes it very light and fluffy. Great idea! Diet soda works too.

I tried these out of curiousity...and was surprised at the result.  I make pancakes from scratch all of the time and these were some of the best ones ever.  The beer (I used Coors Light) provided a sweetness that I never would have guessed.  Fluffy and delicious, the perfect side for my Scrambled Eggs Done Right (also from AR).  Thanks!

These were great! I had some "Blueberry Malt" beer.  It was terrible as a beverage but I didn't want to throw it out. I thought I'd give it a try.  I used it and threw in some fresh blueberries... RAVE REVIEWS from the family.  I made some regular pancakes for the children, and after the adults had the beer pancakes, they said they'd never eat regular pancakes again.  I can't wait to try it with my favorite Apricot Beer.  This is a keeper!

good simple recipe for when you must have pancakes and have no milk in the house--you can tast a very faint taste of the beer but didn't stop anyone from gobbling them down!!
I will make these again.

I made the kids version for this, and they love it. I have also used other flavor sodas for variety with equal success.

There were delicious!  I used light beer and added a bit of brown sugar to the batter, too.  Everyone loved that they were a little crispy on the edges but super fluffy inside.  Thanks for the great idea!

These turned out really well.  As a single business traveler, I rarely have milk around but I had some extra St. Louis Schlafly's Christmas Ale and used that.  The pancakes had a nice hoppy zing and my house smells great now!

These are surprisingly wonderful.  Just sweet and light enough that they make a great late night snack.

These were light, fluffy and very good.  I used Mic Utra with Lime beer and it gave it a nice little lime flavor.  I made some fruit compote instead of using syrup.  Yum!  Will make again and try rootbeer.

Although these pancakes are indeed very light and fluffy, mine had a definite bitter aftertaste that I did not care for at all.  Adding syrup did not help.  IF I try this again, I may try the cream soda suggested by someone else... the bitterness was just too unpleasant for me.

I won't say that this is better than my regular pancake recipe, but I will say I was surprised by how AWESOME these were! I was out of milk, so I used Yuengling Lager. I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar, because I'm a syrup fan. They smell like beer, but they don't taste like it at all. :)

Wow, I'm kind of torn on these. As advertised, they ARE fluffy and moist. And they do have a pleasant sweetness; I only use syrup about half the time anyway, but definitely didn't feel that these needed any. I think I'll try making these one more time with a less challenging, less beer-y beer - I used a honey brown ale, and it's a semi-bold flavor. I keep going back & forth between "these pancakes are like really yeast-y bread" and "huh, these pancakes really do taste like beer". It's not unpleasant - in fact, they're pretty tasty - it's just a little disconcerting when you think too hard about it. :D Next go-round will be wussy beer, and I'll also try root beer or cream soda for the kiddos; will update from there. No matter what, I think they're worth trying!

We were inspired to make beer pancakes after dining in the Portland Oregon airport at Rogue Brewery Restaurant.  This was an decent recipe for beer pancakes. I highly recommend using Rogue Ale Chocolate Stout, as it adds a wonderful flavor  to the pancakes!   Use more flour to make the pancakes a bit thicker (1/4 cup more), and 3/4 cup of beer instead and it'll taste great!

We loved them! My son made them first and loved them. We made them today for Father's Day Brunch. We used Blueberry beer in the mix and dropped fresh blueberries on to the pancakes as them cooked. Fabulous!

These were my favorite pancakes so far. I used fat tire beer which is fairly light and on the fruity side. I used the exact recipe and they came out PERFECT! They were almost like crepes which are my fav as well. I might add more sugar next time and some fruit fillings to dress them up. Love them!

I decided to make these because Mr. LTH was clamoring for pancakes; I resisted until I got in my recipe box to meal plan for the week and saw these.  I thought I'd give them a whirl.  They are fine for what they are: more of a "novelty" than anything.  They'd be great w/a few drops of green for a St. Patty's Day b-fast or to add substance to an early kickoff tailgate menu, but they're def not a "gotta have" pancake recipe.  The texture is a little off to me and you can def taste the beer (I used a Molson Canadian...8 oz for the pancakes; 4 oz for me :) ).  TY for a great reason for beer for b-fast, chubbylittletoro!

Being a Texas gal, I had to use Shiner Light.  The pancakes were great.  I doubled the recipe (4 servings) but used only a 12 oz. bottle of beer.  The consistency was perfect.

COORS LIGHT....Thats the beer to use, it doesnt have much taste and the pancakes turn out fairly fluffy. The picture is VERY decieving, the batter is Very runny, but a very good tasting pancake, I was very shocked. However it didnt yield as many as I would like.  Very tasty though.

So glad I found this recipe! It's pretty common for me to not have milk in the house, so I really appreciate the lack of it in here. I will continue to make these even if I have some though, as I really loved the sweet slightly yeast-y flavor. They cooked up a great texture, light but not airy like the powdered mix, which is a good thing. I will need to try with diet cream soda and fresh raspberries sprinkled in, but as written this recipe is wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

BEST PANCAKE RECIPE EVER. Hands down. I used Stella Artois for the beer, which worked great. I also made the following tweaks:
- brown sugar instead of white
- added about 1/4 cup extra flour, as the batter seemed a bit runny
- added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (or to taste)
- added a pinch of ground ginger (maybe 1/8 tsp max)
- used butter in the pan rather than oil

Topped them with corn syrup and we were in pancake heaven!

These were pretty good.  We used cream soda, and I think if we had used a different cream soda they might have bumped up a notch.  The texture was light and fluffy but a little greasy, and I think cutting back a bit on the butter would improve the texture for us.  I'll definitely try again with a different cream soda and add some blueberries, too.  They don't even need syrup.

Ran out of milk, wanted pancakes. Allrecipes to the rescue! Used a can of root beer with very tasty results. Also smeared some apple butter on 'em, just cause we had it.

These were surprisingly very good! I made em because I wanted pancakes and had no milk in the house but I did have 3 bottles of beer sitting in the back of the fridge. I liked these more then regular pancakes. They were delicious!

I doubled this recipe and substituted Splenda for the sugar and used George Killians Irish Red. The end result looked good, but they had a very bitter taste and were awful. My son who puts syrup on hot dogs wouldn't even eat them! I substitute Splenda all the time so I don't think that was it and I find the Red has a sweet flavor on it's own. I may try diet cola if I'm in a pinch and out of milk, but never again beer!

The appeal of this recipe is its versatility- instead of using milk, you can use any fizzy you have on hand, and change the flavour with what you use.
Because milk is low calorie and nutritious, I warn against subbing in pop regularly. I only use this recipe if I'm out of milk or have beer to use up.
I have tried this recipe with a natural ginger beer and added ginger and cinnamon. 
I have also used lager and added a spoonful of molasses, a spoonful of muscovado, and half a cup of demerara sugar. The spices were a dash of cardamom, a dash of cloves and lots of cassia (American cinnamon). The pancakes were rich and malty. They didn't need syrup.
The edges go lovely and crispy, almost caramelised.

Pretty much the best "alternative" pancake recipe out there.  They have a great flavor (which you can alter with different beer types) and texture - they turn out more thin than cakey, but I like them that way.

I tried this with both root beer and a pale ale.  It IS a good recipe, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed it didn't have more of a bite-it just tastes like any other recipe made with (regular) milk.  But as someone who really doesn't like milk for anything else than baking (which I unfortunately don't have a great deal of time for any more), this is a great alternative to wasting money on milk that will more than likely go bad before I use it all!

Didn't care for these, but in all honesty I think it was because of my husbands "home brew" beer.  I'm willing to try it again with a lighter beer and the idea of sustituting creme soda is very appealing.

This recipe was so easy!  It is especially nice since most people have all of the ingredients on hand.  My fiance and I talked about the possibility of using ginger ale in the future.  Since we love good beers, we used a good local beer and it turned out better than we could have imagined.

Great recipe!  I was out of milk, and also white sugar, but i was craving pancakes, and as a university student, lord knows we had beer around. We were also out of white sugar so i used just brown sugar, about 1/3 cup.  You can definitely taste the beer, but its nice and sweet, so sweet that i didn't need syrup!  I look forward to trying this recipe with cream soda or root beer! Thanks for the great idea!

Awesome! I normally dislike pancakes because they're too cakey or something but these are delicious! I think it's the sweetness from the beer. I used Pacifico because that's what we had. Just moved & was too lazy to get milk, etc. Can't wait to try sodas as other reviewers suggested! Great idea!

This is a cool funky recipe.  I will make it again (seems like a camping recipe to me).  I used a very hoppy beer preferred by beer-snobs (I am one).  But I think this recipe would have been better if I had used something like Coors or Miller Lite because the flavor should be a bit more delicate.

These are the best pancakes I have ever had! I found that the batter was too wet and runny so I added an extra handful up whole wheat flour. I also used about 1/2 cups of whole wheat in the initial batter. Wow, these were good. They dont taste like beer they just taste great! My fiance loved 'em. I think I might make these for dessert with ice cream and some fruit topping. Great recipe!

Made these exactly as written. I thought they were pretty good, my fiance wasn't a big fan. We used Yuengling because it was the cheapest / most generic beer we had in the fridge, but the flavor of the beer definitely came through in the pancakes. These are probably best with a cheap light beer that doesn't have strong flavor on its own. Unless you know you want the flavor of the beer to come through in the pancakes, of course.

A bit salty - so I plan to omit the salt. I used Shocktop beer which was pretty good and I like the suggestion of adding cheese. Will definitely try again with different types of beer :)

My husband and I loved these. We enjoyed the yeasty, sourdough after taste the beer added. I made a few adjustments, I replaced half a cup of flour with wheat germ, cut the sugar down to two tablespoons, and added vanilla. Will make these again for sure!

These are some of the best pancakes I have ever made. I have been looking for a pancake recipe forever. None of the ones I have tried tasted as great as these. They are so tender and yummy. My family gets very excited when I tell them I am going to be making these pancakes for breakfast.

I was a little leary of this one, but wanted to try something different.  Not bad!  I can so see college and 20 something's being into this as they rarely have milk in the frig., but always have beer.  This probably won't be a regular breakfast meal but for those weekend mornings when I'm out of milk it will be a go to. :)

This is a great recipe.  I usually make my pancakes with bisquick, but when I do not have any, I use this recipe.  I use mountain dew instead of beer since we dont drink and never have alcohol in the house.  Because of that, I do ease up on the sugar since the soda is loaded with it.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for posting!

First time I've ever made pancakes and they turned out pretty good! (aside from the shape!)  I didn't have beer so made with L&P (a New Zealand soft drink) and they were light and fluffy.  Maple syrup and voila - yum!!

I made this with my girls and used Cream Soda instead of beer. It was amazing! Lightly vanilla tasting with a little zing at the end. Will definately make these again. The girls finished off 2 pancakes. That never happens!

These are GLORIOUS. I made them tonight after running out of milk making regular pancakes, and these tasted far better than the normal ones. I even used crummy beer (Blue Light) that had been just sitting in the fridge. I ended up adding a little more flour to the batter, though, because it seemed a little runny. As well, keep a close eye on these, because they burn much more easily than your regular pancake. I'm definitely making these again.

OH. MY. GOSH. These pancakes are amazing. The batter is the perfect texture the pancakes are super-fluffy! The hint of beer flavor isn't a hindrance at all, which I was scared of when trying this.   I tried mine with pecans and bananas in the batter... AWESOME!!

We made these with A&W Root Beer and they turned out fantastic. Personally, I couldn't put syrup on mine. They were just fine and sweet enough without it, but the kids wanted syrup. I can't wait to try this with other fizzy stuff. Great recipe!

I L-O-V-E the idea of using beer in pancakes instead of milk!!! I use my own from-scratch pancake recipe that comes out fluffy and richer but still directly substitute beer for the milk. Light beer works better, I would not go any darker than yeungling. It's amazing how well real maple syrup goes with the complex beer flavor. Sooooooo goooood!

I used a Japanese beer and added some sliced bananas. The pancakes were thinner than normal with a slightly crispy edge but they were so good!! They did have a slight beer taste to them, but I think it was a very complementary flavor, even with the bananas. I will definitely make these again!

Delicious, although I used German beer which tastes a bit stronger than American beer I guess. The beer taste was a bit strong, I think next time I'll mix 50/50 beer and milk.

We tried this recipe using a Holiday Pumpkin Beer, and a dash of brown sugar.  WOW. It was So delicious... I did have to add extra flower though because the batter turned out to runny and the pancakes ended up very thin.      I did notice that the cooking times were odd, when the bottom was done the top was still to soft to flip, it tried to run all over the pan. But we made it work and they were still delicious...even if they weren't pretty.

These pancakes were pretty good.  You couldn't taste the beer in the batter.  When the pancake was cooking on the first side, I sliced most of a banana into the unbaked batter.  I then covered them with dabs of the batter.  The banana give the pancake extra moisture.  Although I thought the pancake was good, it was a bit on the heavy side.  I don't think I would make this one again.

I gave this recipe a 5 because they are definitely "the best" pancakes I have had. They turned out awesome. I only had enough box mix for the kiddos and had an extra couple people in the house in the morning. So I whipped these up and they were definitely a smash! I could faintly taste the beer, and even though I don't like beer at all, it was a nice flavor. The only time we have beer here is when people leave it, so we'll have to wait till then to enjoy these again!! mmm.. thanks!

I too tried this out of curiosity but used hard cider in place of the beer and added a touch of cinn/nutmeg. I served them with a diced apple compote I made and infued with some of the remaining cider. It was a happy Sunday feast!

I am truly stunned. My college age son and I were looking for a recipe for Ebelskiver. I am so glad I couldn't find any! We came upon this at about midnight and after one reviewer said "it made a great midnight snack", we said "what the heck!" These turned out to be the tastiest pancakes we have ever had. We used Tecate Light, and followed the recipe to a "T". Try it, you won't believe it! Can't wait to try the cream soda!

WOW!!  The lightest and fluffiest pancakes.  My granddaughter was home sick today, but of course, wanted pancakes for breakfast.  I didn't have pancake mix so I tried this recipe with Root Beer.  I didn't feel like melting butter, so I added vegetable oil, a little vanilla and cinnamon.  Next time, however, I think I will decrease the sugar somewhat.  My granddaughter asked me to PLEASE make some for her little brother after school.  My grandchildren love my pancakes, but they asked me to ALWAYS make these.

After reading all the great reviews here I decided to try it. Followed the recipe exactly and used Rolling Rock beer. They were really quite good pancakes and I was pleased. While still cooking them, I was singing along with the birds and SUDDENLY I felt ill. Something in this recipe did not agree with my stomach. And it came on FAST. Usually I have plenty of warning, but not today. I say again, it came on FAST. Barely enough time to get to the bathroom 15 feet away and dry heave for about a minute. I used all good quality ingredients. The only thing even slightly off is that I used less sugar and lightly greased the pan with good olive oil (which I use regularly). So try it but beware!

I made these on saturday for the BF. Made them with honey raspberry ale. Taste was really good, but the batter was sooooo runny. Not sure what needs to happen to correct that, but they turned out pretty good (just not fluffy enough)

Wow - yummy!  I had to add some more flour because the batter seemed a little thin.  Other than that these were great!  Thick and fluffy - a little on the doughy side, but still good!  I used Sierra Nevada and they had a nice light beer taste to them.  Will make again!

I Loved this recipe! My boyfriend and I followed it exactly and were delighted at the results. The pancakes were so sweet, light and fluffy! We used Bud Light and I have a feeling we'll make them many more times. :) Thanks!

I'm eating these right now. I didn't like how thin they were by the recipe, so I added 1/2 cup of flour. They are really good!! I love them.

I made these with rootbeer.  They were sweet enough that I didn't need to add syrup, just a bit of butter and strawberries!  The picture was a bit misleading as mine were not nearly as thick as the picture.

Great!  I made these for my friends and they loved them!  The beer adds a slight taste, but leaves them light and fluffy.  I'll be using this pancake recipe from now on!

I used Fresca instead of beer and it is perfect! Fluffy with a hint of sweetness that compliments maple syrup wonderfully. I even approximated the measurements and it came out great. Don't cook on too high of heat though. The pancakes cook quickly.

The beer ones had nasty aftertastes, but sprite was the best out of the four sodas i tried. (Root beer, cream soda (raspberry), and ginger ale.)

I don't know what the best is beyond this recipe.  THe tast is sweet and a bit yeasty- a wonderful flavor.  It's good alone but adding maple syrup-wow- it absorbs the syrup and blends.  The texture has just a bit of pull, like a crepe, allowing it to hold up to whatever you want to put in it or on it.

I was so excited when I found this recipe, because we had run out of milk and wanted pancakes, but no one wanted to run to the store. Well, I made them exactly as the recipe indicated, using 1C Sam Adams Light for the beer, and the batter smelled great, but when I put it in the pan it was FLATTER than a pancake! These were really pasty, and really flat. They looked nothing like the picture. They had an ok flavor, but the consistency just wasn't there. Ok for a lazy day when there's no milk, but this is not a favorite by any means.

I'm sure this recipe is fine, but I would recommend experimenting with your favorite pancake mix and different beers. For example, I was raised on bisquick/henry weinhard's private reserve.... with peanut butter and syrup?! SOOO GOOD.  The cakes turn out fluffy with a subtle hoppy-bitter note that works great with syrup & pb.
And by the way, the alcohol cooks away, so it's still a "kid's version" even if you use real beer. Root beer/cream soda (or whatever else you children use) sounds like a sugar over load to me.

These were wonderful.

I used Blue Moon's peach beer.I don't know if that was the trick or if it's just a wonderful recipe,but either way, I ate the entire bath by myself with only butter on them.

Made this recipe with naughty nurse Beer (amber ale) and they came out better than expected.  Had half a beer that I was gunna throw out and instead found this recipe when searching for breakfast today. Fluffy and a nice twist on the traditional pancakes. True to recipe.

I had some blueberry beer left over from a party so I thought what the heck, I might as well see if there're any good recipes I can cook with it.  Best Pancakes I Have Ever Had. Now I'm wondering about all kinds of beer mixtures. Time to experiment.

I suggest using a light beer.  Regular beer is going to impart stronger flavors.  With light beer you get a bit of a malty flavor that's pleasurable for kids and adults alike.  Mom used to make them for me when I was little.  They were delicious and didn't taste like beer at all. The alcohol cooks off for those concerned.

These pancakes were amazing. I doubled the recipe, but only had one egg and it didn't seem to make a difference. The beer I used was Blue Moon and I added some orange zest. They were fluffy, tender, sweet, citrusy and delicious. I served them with some homemade orange syrup. Heaven!

These turned out perfectly! My boyfriend is lactose intolerant so I've been searching for a milk free recipe without much luck. I used coors light for this and it was perfect. I think because it's so light the beer taste disappeared and the pancakes were wonderfully fluffy! This is my new pancake recipe.

I made one substitution. I used sparkling seltzer water opposed to the beer as listed. The pancakes were very tasty, however I had a hard time getting them to cook evenly. :)

Might have been ok with mild beer but my beer made it very bitter. They were aweful. In future I will only use my beer for beer batter fish.

Overall I liked these pancakes and got a chuckle about the bitter aftertaste comments.  If you use bitter beer (India Pale Ale or Pale Ale)you are going to have bitter pancakes.  I would recommend using a white, lager, hefeweisen, or fruit beer.

I already had it in my mind that I wanted pancakes when I saw that had maybe 1/4 cup of milk left! I checked online and this recipe caught my eye because I make my own beer. Another use for my beer! I decided to try this recipe with a dark red beer. I was sceptic, thinking the molasses and malty flavours would be too strong. On the contrary, the flavour of beer is very light, not overpowering. I also didn't have white sugar, only brown, so my pancakes turned into crêpes, not much fluff, which is how I like them anyway! I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed these a lot. My husband compared these to a maple donut. Definitely going to try this recipe again!

Fantastic tasting pancakes!  My husband didn't realize that I had made these from scratch and thought I had used the Snoqualmie Falls Pancake mix.  He was really surprised when I told him it wasn't and that I had made them with the Kaliber beer that was sitting in the fridge! Snoqualmie Falls is the best pancake mix ever (in my opinion) and these taste almost exactly like them. At a fraction of the cost!

This were delicious!  I usually don't eat syrup on my pancakes, just a little butter.  These were so flavorful and I couldn't taste the beer in them.  They were a little sweeter than the traditional pancake.  I used Coors light.   I would decrease the beer to 3/4 of a cup.  The batter was slightly runny.

These turned out good, maybe even better than my standard buttermilk pancakes.  I used cream soda instead of beer, since my husband does not like beer much.  I didn't think of it when I made them, but I should have cut the amount of sugar added to the batter down since the cream soda is pretty sweet as it is.  Some of mine burned...which, I think, was a combination of using a new stove for the first time, and having so much sugar in the batter (the outsides "caramelized" while the insides were still gooey.)  For the ones that were still raw in the middle, I stuck them in a 300 degree oven for a few minutes to finish cooking them.

Ok - I will have to admit, I did not make this recipe with beer and I used a box pancake mix (the kind you just add water to). I followed the advice of some and used root beer. My kids were in love. I have to admit - they are pretty good. Nice and fluffy with just a hint of root beer flavor.

This was a really yummy twist on traditional pancakes. We used Corona and it worked well. My husband went back for thirds. They don't need syrup (too sweet). I used pumpkin butter and my husband used a little bit of honey. Pair them with cheesy eggs and it's a breakfast fit for a king.

Suprisingly good! I was looking for a way to use up an open can of beer used for marinading meat the night before and came across this recipe. Very impressed. I measured 1 cup of beer but didnt use the whole thing. maybe 3/4cup at most. Thin batter produces a thin rubbery pancake in my opinion and i like mine fluffy. This is definitely a keeper.

These are very good, and the taste changes depending on what kind of beer you use. This is a good breakfast for dinner type of meal, when there isn't much else around.

These pancakes had a very thick texture.  They had a distinctive beer smell, but the flavor was sweet.  Mine may have been thinner if I had sifted the flour.  I would never make them again.  I tried this recipe b/c I didn't have any buttermilk and it seems as every other pancake recipe calls for buttermilk.

I thought that these were delicious. I added some chocolate chips to them and my whole family liked them. But in my opinion they turned out a little flatter than i wanted them so next time i think i might add a little bit more flour. :)

These were really good, I love beer but am pregnant right now so I can't really enjoy it unless I cook with it. I did change these a bit to make them a bit more healthy though. I used 100% whole wheat flour, honey in place of sugar, and added frozen blackberries. The whole wheat made them a bit thick so I haded about a 1/4 cup of water to make them the right consistency for my family, we like them thin. Beer in pancakes such a good idea!

I was very excited to try this recipe. They turned out great, but I made a few changes. I used self-rising flour and left out the baking powder, and I used 1 C of lemon/lime soda in place of the beer. I also placed a slice of banana in the middle of each one while cooking. This could be my new pancake recipe.

I make these even when I have milk! I would not recommend using any type of bitter beer. Stay away from IPA's and red beer for this recipe. I used a seasonal pumpkin ale and it turned out fantastic!I also enjoy it with a honey wheat beer. I prefer to use about half of the sugar it calls for though. I prefer the sweetness to come from the syrup.

So I had a few beer leftover from the memorial day weekend, and decided to make this recipe,I personally don't eat pancakes,but since my three kids(age 4,3,2) ate 3 each, I'm assuming they were good. The only change was I only used 3/4 C of beer, all other ingredients as recipe states.

I am from Wisconsin and have been eating pancakes my entire life.  This recipe blows all those other pancakes away!  I used Coors Light because it was in the fridge, and some real Wisconsin maple syrup.  So light, so delicious!  I will never make "sober" pancakes again!

Awesome pancakes!! Like the description says, i ran out of milk, and i wanted pancakes!!! they turned out great! way better than a premade mix that i have in the pantry. I threw in some chocolate chips and topped with powdered sugar, and yum yum yum!! the only thing is that i can sort of taste a little beer, maybe i didnt cook it long enough? either way, its not enough to keep me from making this again!

I used an IPA and there was a definite bitter beer aftertaste to the pancakes.  I guess if you really like that flavor then the pancakes would taste good.

Interesting batter.  Didn't yield quite as much as I was hoping.  I was surprised how well the tang of the beer worked with the sweetness of the maple syrup.  Next time will try a darker beer, and see what happens.

These Beercakes turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were yummy deliciousness.  I was curious about what they would taste like and wanted to attempt to describe it for others, but it is difficult to explain.  It's definitely great to use as a traditional pancake, but it does have a slight beer flavor - kinda like beer breads, or even slightly like a griddle corncake.  Use with butter and syrup, or even treat it more like a bread - can be used either way!

IGNORE THE PICTURE!  The picture with this recipe makes you assume these will be really thick, doughy pancakes and they are not.  That said, they are still really good.  I am cooking them for the first time right now.  I used a very hoppy beer and had to add over 1/4 c. flour to my batter, and the pancakes are still pretty thin.  It seems from reading the reviews this is a common problem with the hoppier beers.  Next time I may try a soda, as that appears to work out better for people.  I have been tasting as I've been working, and these taste wonderful!  I made a blueberry syrup from scratch to go with this, and can hardly wait to finish them to sit down and enjoy!

I didn't want to deplete my in-laws milk supply any more, so I decided to try these. I used Dr. Pepper and they came out amazing! They're really fluffy so it's kinda hard to flip them, but they still come out wonderful. Great submission!

Great twist on the classic pancake! I had planned waffles for this morning but after seeing this recipe last night I had to try it. The kids were a bit wary at first but quickly gobbled them up (we used root beer.) I loved these because they added enough flavor  so they were delicious without syrup as well. Wonderful!

NEW UPDATE - These pancakes have become a staple in our house. This morning we made them using the energy drink AMP. Still wonderful! Wasn't something I would think of first off but they turned out really good! The possibilities with this pancake are endless!!!

This was a good recipe.  I had milk, I just wanted to try something different.  The beer and the sugar give them an interesting flavor.  I didn't have any baking powder, so my pancakes turned out a little heavy, but they had a great flavor and a tender texture.  I will definitely try this one again!

Eh. These are passable. I cut back on the sugar quite a bit, to one tablespoon. That way, they'd be good for a savory breakfast. Like with eggs and bacon. The kids liked that they were having something with beer in it. They cooked up real flat. I didn't overmix, either. If I were to make them again, I'll use a carbonated soda and add a little more baking powder. I don't know that I will. I'm a little underwhelmed with these.

These weren't as amazing as I was hoping. I know what they're called and all, but the beer taste was too strong in them.

I used Sam Adam's Boston Lager and still didn't like these.  My husband an avid beer consumer also didn't care for these.  I gave it two stars since it was a good try for a milk substitute and it was edible but next time I will run down to the store for milk.  Nice try.

Great recipe! I used a sweeter Raspberry Ale for this and it turned out incredible. We had leftover pancakes that we used this next morning to make pigs in blankets. Delicious.

this recipe rules. the pancakes are so moist and tasty, you almost dont even need syrup. this is probably the best pancake from scratch. I used budweiser as the beer. and i cant wait to try it with other beer brands

I grew up in a much simpler version of this recipie.  prepared pancake mix and a bottle of beer.  It does not get much simpler that that.  Do not use a beer you would not normally drink, the flavor of the beer does come through.  I enjoy using flavored beers, pumpkin spice ale, etc.

My husband loved these pancakes.  I, who cannot stand alcohol, hate these pancakes. I think they should be called "Beer-Lovers Pancakes". I was looking for a recipe that I used to make that required less beer and was excellent.

I'm only giving this four stars because the pancakes didn't look that great, they tend to have a really dark brown and burnt appearance even though they weren't.  In terms of taste, they were great! I think its important to use the right kind of beer, the first time i used a beer that wasn't sweet and the pancakes tasted funny. The second time was much better as I used a sweeter beer. Also, if you want your pancakes fluffier, try adding the beer last, mix all your dry ingredients and all your wet (save for the beer)ingredients seperately then mix together and add the beer last. I used one whole teaspoon of baking powder and used the double acting kind for the added punch. I served it with garlic and herb sausages and it was a hit!

Tasted very good, there was a sweetness from the beer that gave a great taste to the pancakes.  The only problem was that the pancakes were not very fluffy, they did not rise well, and were not great in appearance.

We used a 12% ABV blueberry, barrel-aged stout and these were delicious. Got my husband interested in cooking for the first time LOL! Experimenting with other types of beer but suspect it really needs to be a sweet beer.

I used Grain Belt Blu beer and as they cooked I add fresh blueberries and they tasted great!  The only issue was that they weren’t very fluffy.

Great pancakes, super light and fluffy!!!! I thought 1/4c sugar was a little much though so used my usual 1tbsp instead and it was plenty sweet. Root beer is one of my faves so will try that next time and maybe even a root beer/beer combo. See which I prefer.

I used mineral water instead of beer and brown sugar instead of white as that was all i had on hand. They came out amazingly delicious, not too fluffy but very light. Will make again the same way!

A plus! And if you double the dry ingredients, you can use the full 12 oz can of beer. I used pumpkin beer and added pumpkin pie spice and almond extract. Amazing! My 8 & 10 year old LOVE them!

This was the second time I made these. I used New Glarus Pumpkin Pie Lust for the beer, and I added 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and made them pumpkin spice beer pancakes... delicious. First time I made them I used Coors (not Coors light).

I normally hate fruity beers, but when I saw this recipe I decided to try a Sam Adams blueberry hill lager. It gave the pancakes a great blueberry flavor. They were light and fluffy.  What a great idea!

More dense and not quite as fluffy as I prefer.  The flavor was ok as a basic pancake, but when you put on some baked apples it was awesome!

Definitely for the adult taste buds!  I think I overmixed the batter because they were very flat.  I will try them again.  Like how moist and tasty they are.

Well, let me tell you... the batter tastes awful, but the pancake tastes delicious!  I made mine with half-white, half-wheat and a Bud Light.  It occurs to me that these might also be very good with a jam or jelly.

I also used Coors light. I had Splenda brown sugar on hand and I used that w/ 1/4 cup of reg. sugar. I increased the serving size to 6. These pancakes were The Most Terrific, yummiest!!! cakes I have ever eaten! 2 words that don't go together, suddenly do! Thanks to  Chubby little Toro for re inventing a breakfast favorite!

These were really good. I used a darker beer - a porter - and it was incredible. Porter is smooth with hints of coffee and chocolate so it worked well for a pancake. I don't think I would have liked it as much with a budweiser.

Just finished eating these for breakfast.  Interesting flavor- in a good way. used bud light. wished the pancakes would have browned up more than they did.  I also made the mistake of using beer from the fridge so the butter coagulated in the batter. I just realized i forgot to add the egg(yikes).  Maybe that is why it didn't turn out very brown.

Yummmmmm!  I just got done having these for dinner and I am with the previous review, mine did not look like the pic but tasted great.  I used Miller Lite and started by cooking them in a large (high-sided) skillet and they looked so weird.  I quickly switched the skillet out with my stove top griddle and they were so much fluffier!  Also, I added a tsp. of vanilla on accident, as I assumed the recipe called for it and wasn't paying attention, but it was great.  They were sweet but not too sweet.  Just right.  I will definitely use this as my staple pancake recipe from now on.
