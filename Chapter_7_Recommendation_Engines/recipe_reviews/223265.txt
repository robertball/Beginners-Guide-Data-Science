For a more elegant presentation I used small new potatoes cut in half cross-wise, and topped each golden brown half with a teeny dollop of sour cream and a small leaf of fresh thyme. I wanted the cut side nice and golden brown so I placed them on my cookie sheet cut side down and didn't turn.  Also, I used pure olive oil (not extra virgin) rather than vegetable oil and omitted the onion.  Beautiful.

Very easy and also adaptable to the grill or open flame.  It was stinking hot here and I was planning on grilling so I made these in a disposable aluminium pan - over direct heat on the grill.  Just toss every now and again and they get good and crispy - you can easily do the meat indirect on the other side of the grill.  Add a salad and you have dinner in no time at all.

Very simple, but very flavorful. I didn't have fresh thyme, but dried worked fine.  Will definitely be making these again.

Great side dish idea for a perfectly grilled steak. If anything, use kosher salt(always), olive oil instead of vegetable and add a clove or two of minced garlic. And for the reviewer who said it was too bland here's a simple solution..some finishing salt. Duh!

Good recipe. I do something similar. I use new potatoes and cut them in half and let the marinate in plenty of olive oil then salt them with kosher salt before pouring them in a pan. Then the rosemary, thyme and whatever else is sprinkled generously over them and raost till tender. Very aromatic and never misses. I like the idea of taking slightly larger potatoes and splitin g them lengthwise and dressing them. Little more labor involved tho.

The kids loved them. I used Olive Oil, ground thyme from the jar and fresh rosemary.  I oiled the pan with a brush and about a tablespoon of oil.  I also used a large onion and cut the potato's a little smaller than suggested. We like our potato's crunchy so after cooking, I broiled them with the pan on the top shelf for about 5 minutes and stirring them once.  The onions were cooked quite a but no one seemed to mind.  Finally a potato recipe we all like.

Was actually a pretty bland recipe though i had high hopes for it. Might try adding garlic to it. Adjusting seasoning types/amounts may help. Not sure if it's worth fiddling with.

This was just okay.  I would add the minced onion and herbs the last 10 minutes of roasting as it charred and was black bits not adding any flavor to the potatoes.

I substituted the rosemary for parsley flakes because my husband doesn’t care for rosemary.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and my has been was very happy! I do have a lot a lot of leftovers though. The next time I will definitely cut the recipe in half.

Ok, so I didn’t follow the recipe completely. Used dried thyme and rosemary. Substituted garlic salt instead of salt and cooked with olive oil. Cut small cubes of 4 large russet potatoes, half of a large yellow onion, and added some red bell peppers so it took about 45 minuets to cook. Stirred every 7-10 minuets. It turned out great!

These potatoes were actually very good. I added a bit of powdered garlic and used coarse salt for good presentation. I might add a bit less rosemary next time and replace the vegetable oil for olive oil to see how it turns out which should be fine. Will make it again for sure!

Delicious. I added garlic powder as other reviewers suggested. I also added kielbasa sausage to turn it into a casserole.

The potatoes took a lot longer than what it said to cook. I cooked them an additional half hour. I used lemon olive oil to give it better flavor and because olive oil is healthier than vegetable oil. I also added fresh chopped garlic which was delicious. Other ingredients I used: fresh grated pepper, seasoned salt, and a little bit of paprika.

Good. I used lemon thyme too for a tang. Next time I will bake on a flat sheet so they brown better.
