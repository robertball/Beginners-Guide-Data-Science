This was a really great addition to a brunch menu. It was perfectly spiced and not too sweet, but just sweet enough to not need syrup. The crumb topping is an extra special touch. I found I liked it best with just a dollop of fresh whipped cream to complement the spicy pumpkin flavor. I didn't have Texas toast and substituted a loaf of regular sandwich bread, which when cubed equaled about 8 cups. I also took the crusts off first. The only minor issue was with mixing everything in the baking dish - that caused it to stick to the dish. I would recommend stirring the pumpkin mixture in a large bowl and adding the bread cubes to the bowl to mix, then pouring it all in the baking pan.

This was fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I made a couple of changes to try lightening it up and reducing the number of ingredients used: egg beaters instead of eggs, lower calorie/high-fiber white bread instead of the Texas toast,  2 heaping tsp of pumpkin spice instead of the cinnamon/cloves/nutmeg combo, and reduced the amount of brown sugar in the topping to 1/4 cup.  I also added a little 2% milk to the pumpkin mixture so there was enough liquid to fully soak the bread.  Ended up with 12 generously-sized squares of french toast, at about 160 calories (and 10 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber!) a piece!  Turned out great, although I don't doubt the original recipe is even better and richer tasting - will save that for a special occasion :)  

The best part -- I wrapped the leftover squares individually in plastic wrap and froze them, and am looking forward to reheating them in the toaster oven for an easy/healthy breakfast later this week!

This was amazing!  I didn't make any chages to the recipe except adding an extra teaspon of sugar.  For the topping, I used 3 tablespoons of butter and added approximately 1 cup of finely chopped pecans.  It is delish served alone or amazing with a smidgen of maple syrup and a dollop of Extra Creamy Cool Whip.  I placed the cubed bread into a 13x9 Pyrex dish and poured the puree on top and gently tossed with my hands; then sprinkled with the topping.  My family is very picky and they loved, loved, loved this dish!

I really enjoyed the Frech toast bake, however, an entire loaf of Texas thick-sliced bread is not needed!   In step 3 of the directions it states, " Arrange the bread cubes in a single layer", so only a few slices of bread needed to be cubed.  I had cubed up the entire loaf since that is what is listed in the ingredient listing.  Also, I would suggest lining the cake pan with foil and geasing the foil, so clean-up of the pan is easier.  As another review suggested, mix the ingredients in a bowl and then pour the mixture over the bread cubes.

This made a good and filling breakfast this morning. I am one of those people that thinks everything tastes too sweet. I liked that this did not. I didn't have Texas toast bread. I made a loaf of homemade bread, the other day, and used that. I only wanted about 4 servings, or just enough for breakfast, and used about 7 slices of the cubed bread for 1/2 the recipe. The only other change I made was subbing an equal amount of "pumpkin pie spice" for the cloves and nutmeg. I would spray the baking pan well or line with parchment as it does stick a bit like most baked french toast recipes. When done I ate it with a very tiny drizzle of maple syrup. The crumb topping already gave it a unique light sweetness. It looks like bread pudding kind of, with the cubed bread, but tastes like french toast. It did smell good to.

great holiday breakfast. changes i made was using pumpkin pie spice instead of seperate spices, and using fresh pumpkin puree instead of cannned (also need about 1/2 cup to a cup more pumpkin) also dont put the bread in nthe pan till after you toss it with the mixture. I mixed everything in a big bowl, added the bread tossed to coat then piled it in the pan. Somebody else mentioned that to do a single layer doesnt need a whole loaf, but you donty want just a single layer. just cut the whole loaf, coat then pile it all in, it will turn out perfect. Also no reason to add milk, the bread will soak up the mixture (per another reviewers comments, if you add milk or crean it will turn out like bread pudding and not a french toast bake, which is what it is)

Loved it! My husband liked it and my co-workers gobbled it up! Added 1 tbs nat. (non-alcoholic) vanilla extract, added a dash of more of each spice, used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar, used old french bread (we always have crusty left-overs), used  rolled oats instead of flour, and sunflower oil instead of butter. Also added a dash of skim milk just to moisten things up and glazed the baking dish with oil and maple syrup. Just because I wanted this a little more like bread pudding, I added 1/8cup of raisins and a handful of pecans for more texture and flavors. Ih and definitely mixed everything in the bowel before adding to the baking dish. Yummy!

This is fabulous!  The flavor is very good, and it is not overly sweet.  And it isn't mushy.  This reminds me more of bread pudding which I love.  The only substitution I made was the bread, as I did not have Texas toast.  Instead I used cinnamon raisin bagel thins, which seems like an odd substitution, but it tastes great!!  Defintitely will make this again!

Awesome dish! I followed recipe ingredients exactly as listed. I only changed one direction...instead of pouring the mixture on the bread, I dipped the bread slices and placed them in the baking pan. Will totally make again! Thank you for sharing! :)

Good recipe for pumpkin lovers. Prefect for the holidays. I used penzeys pumpkin pie spice (because really there is no comparison w/ their spices). I also wanted to add some texture, so I sprinkled pecans on the top w/ the butter mixture.

This is a wonderful dish.  I took others advice and added bread cubes to pumpkin mixture and it worked out great.  Solo good.  I will divide this up and freeze for individual breakfasts.  This I do with pancakes, chicken, side dishes etc.  I cook when I can and store for later.  I have lost 55 pounds this way and eat better than I ever have.  Eating healthy is easy this way.

This was great and easy. I used whole wheat bread and mixed some pumpkin seeds with brown sugar and cinnamon for a crunchy topping.

Perfect for my whole family. It was not sweet at all so we added whipped topping on each of our servings and that made it even better :-) I will be making this again very soon:-)

This was really great. I did not find it too sweet and actually thought that it could have been slightly sweeter, maybe a bit more topping. I used a sparing amount of maple syrup and thought it was just right.

Made this recipe after breakfast, to use up the pumpkin purée in the fridge, so let it soak up the goodness; baked it  just before the new episode of "Revenge," and served it drizzled with Hungry Jack butter Syrup, a dollop of KoolWhip, and lots of crisp bacon! I love the pumpkin in it, and the spices scented the whole house! I halved the recipe; used a tad more spices, let it sit in the fridge 6 hours, and baked it in a brownie pan lined with nonstick foil.

A bit sweet, almost dessert like, but tasty. Will play around with the topping to see if I can cut down on the sugar a bit.

Works well to mix together in bowl first, then put in parchment lined, oiled pan  Liked oats in topping instead of flour. worked fine with grainy bread. Family loved it.

This was pretty good.  I ended up just mixing everything together with an electric mixer so it looked like mush before I baked it.  I also added a little bit of cream because I was afraid it was going to be too dry.  It turned out pretty good.  My husband was tooleery to try it but me and my son liked it.  Pretty yummy with butter and syrup on it.

This is a keeper! It can get a little too dry if you over cook, so be careful to watch it, but it was very yummy and froze nicely. I have prepared it and baked it immediately and also let it sit overnight in the fridge - both ways it was very good. I like that you can use a lot of different kinds of break with it as well - have mixed whatever I have on hand to make enough and it always tastes delicious! We do top it with syrup - it's not quite moist or sweet enough plain. I may play around with the moisture in the future, but as previously stated, it's very good!

My husband and I both went back for seconds.  I made it for an easy dinner with sausage patties.  I served it with whipped cream which was good but next time maybe a little maple syrup as I felt it needed to be a little sweeter.  Wish it had more pumpkin flavor.  next time I'll leave out 5 slices of the bread as others suggested and double the topping.  We added some walnuts to the topping.  As suggested I whisked all the wet ingredients in a big bowl, added the bread cubes and mixed with a spatula before pouring into the greased 9x13.  That worked well.  I will make again.

This was an amazing dish....not too sweet which is what I was hoping for. I hate breakfast dishes that taste like a dessert. This was simple to put together- I also did not need the whole loaf of bread- had maybe 5 slices left over. I used fairly heaping measurements for the spices and had great results. I also added the bread cubes ( I pre measured out for my pan size) to the mixing bowl to toss together. I think it may have been a bit messy to do efficiently in a 9x13. Poured it into the baking pan, added the crumb topping (which I think is an excellent touch) and baked for 30 min. House smelled wonderful, husband and 5 yr old loved it and this is going to be a thanksgiving/christmas tradition for our family. You can't screw it up it is so easy, and it looks and tastes good enough to serve for guests. Thank you for sharing!

So good! I used four eggs and four egg whites and added about a half cup of almond milk to make up for it. Also chopped up pecans for the crumble instead of using four and yogurt instead of butter. I even used multi-grain bread and it was still fantastic. So many possibilities to make this healthier (or not).

I increased the sugar to two tbsp. I increased the sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and doubled the butter. It would have been better if I had cubed the bread last night and let it dry a bit. Not too sweet and fairly tasty.

This is really good.  I didn't cube the bread---I should have.  It was nice for something different.  Not something I'll probably do again.

Paul liked it a lot, but it was a little bland because I just est. the spice.--don't est. and don't skimp on sugar. If you do, just put maple syrup on the bottom of the piece so it soaks up the bottom a little when you eat it (the top was plenty sweet).

Part french toast, part bread pudding!  Guests raved over this breakfast.  I like it but i think I will use french bread next time as that is simply my preference.  Can't wait to make it again.

I made this w/ gluten-free bread for my daughter's family & wheat bread for my son's. Both groups loved it. Only other change I made was to use some egg beaters. Next time I may buy canned pumpkin pie mix & then just mix that w/ the eggbeaters & bread for a speedy assembled emergency meal.

Sorry, but I am a HUGE pumpkin fan, and these did not have any pumpkin taste at all.  French toast was good but not the pumpkin flavor that I expected.

Pretty good.  I would try it again, but I wasn't blown away.  Somehow the flavor just didn't quite spark - maybe more spice would help??

I hate it when people change the recipe & review it, but I am guilty for that....I thought 1 loaf of Texas toast would be too much for 3 of us, so I used about 3/4 of the loaf with crusts cut off, used 6 eggs, 1/2 cup of milk (it seemed too thick) & added 1/4 cup of sugar (I was afraid it wouldn't be sweet enough)
  For the topping, I used a packet of Cinnamon Roll instant oatmeal with 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2 tbl. of butter.....after reading about the messy cleanup others had, I used a disposable pan ( I hate sticky messes & the 50 cent pan is worth my time) baked it for 39 minutes....
  This is a KEEPER....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  We put maple syrup on it & WOW!!!!
  My daughter finished it off, and she is on a diet, so this was incredible. I am making it again this Sunday, but will make the entire loaf of bread......Thanks for an excellent recipe, that I changed to suit our tastes...........

This recipe was interesting more than anything. I got good feedback especially on those who arent chocolate lovers. It kinda tastes like the mexican "abuelita" hot chocolate. Overall very good flavor! I just thought the texture was a bit off but thats just the pumpkins fault.

Great twist on standard french toast. I will make this again, but i think i will double the topping next time.  The topping is what gives this dish its flavor. Its not too sweet, which we like.
I followed other reviews and added some cool whip to the top, PERFECT!

Pretty good recipe. I added 1 tbsp of Pumkin Pie Spice but that's all I added. The taste is good but I think it lacks a bit of the pumpkin flavor. Maybe with less eggs and a bit more spices it will give this a more pumpkiny flavor. Definitely will make again though.. Thank you =)

This is a nice twist on a baked French toast.   It has a wonderful pumpkin flavor, perfect for the fall, with a crumb topping which is a perfect finishing touch.  The only concern I had before and after making the French toast was I felt the egg mixture needed either milk or cream added so the mixture can soak more thoroughly into the bread cubes.  This was a nice French toast to try for a change but I probably would not make again.

I make this for my summer camp kids and they love it! I love sneaking vegetables into things so the pumpkin is great, and to make it more healthy I use whole wheat bread. I double the recipe and put it in a short steam table pan. This also has enough eggs that it is more substantial protein-wise than just pancakes and easier to make for a crowd than french toast. The last time I made it I had to use cartons of egg whites because my supplier hasn't had eggs in several weeks and I also covered it to prevent the edges & top from burning and it was even better- more moist and not so heavy. I'll be doing it that way again!

Easy to make and enjoyed by old and young at a family breakfast! Used the pumpkin pie spice modification suggested and almost a whole loaf of Italian bread (left out 5 pieces as pan was looking full).

I don't like bread heels and had been stashing the heels from my Dave's Killer Bread in the freezer until I found this recipe. It's a keeper! Aside from using my DKB heels torn into pieces, the other change I made was using raw sugar for both the pumpkin mixture and the topping. The raw sugar gave the topping a nice crunch. I also doubled the sugar in the pumpkin mixture. Next time I'll use 3 tablespoons of sugar in the pumpkin mixture.

The recipe calls for too much bread so I didn't use all of it.  I will make again with even less bread.  Loved the flavors!!  The second day I fried an egg and put it on top - yum!  Will make again, thank you.

My family (young kids and adults) loves this recipe.  I've used a variety of breads, sprouted loaves and buns...whatever I have extra of.  They all work great.  I like this recipe because it uses a lot of pumpkin (I add half a cup too!) which adds a nutritional punch, and it isn't very sweet.  Loads of flavor.

Insanely good. Better than homemade cinnamon rolls if that's even possible! Topped with a little syrup and a squirt of whipped cream, it's dessert for breakfast.

Was looking forward to making this for a long time but a diet got in the way. When we were finally ready to splurge, I was sadly disappointed. This was so dry in spots because there was too much bread! If I had used a half a loaf, it may have yielded what we were hoping for, but this just wasn't right. The house smelled great, but the result was disappointing. If you want to make it, use less bread, toss cubed bread into pumpkin mixture outside of the pan and add milk if needed to moisted prior to baking.

Very good, everyone liked it. I thought it was a little dry but that may be because I used regular bread instead of Texas toast.

It was good!  My family prefers typical french toast, so maybe next time I will just dip the whole bread in the mixture and bake rather than cut up the bread.  Just a thought...  Makes the whole house smell amazing!!  I used our fresh brown eggs (thank you girls!, homemade bread, plus homegrown pumpkin puree, so the whole meal cost under a dollar.

This is an amazing recipe. I made this for my whole family the day after Thanksgiving and there were no leftovers. I added some chopped toasted pecans for some texture and crunch. I also doubled the topping and served with either their choice of maple syrup, or home made whip cream from the pies I had made for Thanksgiving. Highly recommend, especially for people who love the holiday spice flavors like I do.

I halved this recipe and put it in an 8x8 dish.  I wanted to use challah bread, but they were out at the store.  I ended up using a whole grain white bread that was a little too soft.  When I went to stir it up it turned to mush.  It still tasted good, especially the topping. I can't wait to make it again with better bread.  If you've never tried challah in a french toast bake, try it...it's really the best!

Delicious thanksgiving morning breakfast.  I made as written, with the exception of mixing all the ingredients (not the topping ingredients), including the bread cubes together before putting the mixture in the pan.  I used the crust on Texas toast also.  Mine did not stick to pan and served up nicely.  We ate it with warm syrup and fresh fruit.  The leftovers heated up great in the toaster oven.

Great flavor and topped with maple syrup makes it taste even better. The only problem I had was not all the bread soaked up the batter. So the middle of the bread was dry. Maybe using regular bread or letting it sit over night?  Still yummy though and we ate seconds.

The only changes I made to this recipe was that I used a big can of pumpkin minus l/2 cup (that I used for a pumpkin cheesecake), also had about 5 slices of Texas Toast left as some others did and I soaked each slice in the mixture and put in the pan.  This was absolutely delicious and we put some maple syrup on the top.  We had it for dinner a couple of days after Thanksgiving.  Will be making this again!

Adding a cup of roasted pecans to the topping is a must.  Mixing in a large bowl is a good idea too...

Amazing!  We decided not to cube the bread, instead we all had a slice!  Would like to make extra "crumble" next time.

This was NOT a hit with our family. I had high hopes for it and made it for Thanksgiving morning. Although no one thought it was bad enough to be thrown away, they also didn't think it was good enough for seconds or that I should ever make it again. Most of what I heard was that it was a 'weird texture'. Sorry not a winner for us.

Loved this! Made for breakfast this morning.....used white bread as I couldnt find Texas toast....also made the wet mixture in a huge bowl and added the bread cubes to that to toss and coat before adding to the 9x13. I omitted the cloves and should have buttered or sprayed my 9x13 with cooking spray as this stuck to the pan a bit....served with a drizzle of maple syrup...my family and I loved it and it was not too sweet.....perfect and thanks!

What did I do wrong? Everyone else likes this recipe and I thought it was marginal at best. I used an italian loaf so maybe the bread was too dense. I found this recipe to be waaaaay to bready, lacking in flavour, needing a dash of salt at least to brighten the palate, maybe a splash of bourbon or rum to add another layer of flavour. It was just flat. Boring. Definitely not satisfying.

I expected more impact on taste.  It was not quite as sweet and frankly I would have added milk or cream to the pumpkin mixture to add more moisture to be absorbed by the bread cubes since the whole thing was a bit too dry and flavorless.  I was looking for something closer to a true french toast or one of those wonderful breakfast casseroles.  I might try again with more sugar topping and adding cream.

It was delicious! We used a mixture of thick cut brown bread and fresh challah and it worked great!! We only made a half recipe, and I think next time we will use a bit more pumpkin - as is it is not very pumpkin-y.

Made this for a brunch, using raisin cinnamon bagels.  Threw some pecans on top.  It eats better with butter, so the next time I'll add some to the mix before baking instead of afterwards. Overall a yummy dish!

Made this for Sunday breakfast and it was a hit! Served it with fruit salad and maple syrup but the syrup was not needed. Made no changes except used wheat bread that I had on hand and scaled it to 6 servings. One thing I will do different next time I make this will be to toss the bread in the pumpkin-egg mixture instead of the baking dish.

I really liked this recipe!  I added a splash of milk to the custard prior to help soak the bread, and added walnuts to the brown sugar mixture for added texture.  This recipe is now a must have for Sunday brunches!

Thanks for sharing!

LOVED this. Made it just as directed except because my bread was rock-hard, I did add a little milk. With less stale bread I think it would have been fine without.

This was amazing, better than I imagined!  I did make a couple substitutions, but don't think it changed the original recipe too much.  I subbed whole wheat bread from a local bakery, and an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice (the blend also includes white pepper and ginger- a lovely addition).  I also whipped up some fresh cream to serve as some reviewers suggested.  We were all impressed by this must make recipe!

This recipe was really good but I did change it a bit. I followed the directions but instead of the clove/nutmeg spices, I just used equal amounts of pumpkin spice. I also only made 4 servings instead of the 8. In my opinion, the finished product was not sweet or flavorful enough for my liking by itself but was perfect with a little maple syrup! In the future I will probably add walnuts or pecans either in the bake or topping to give it a little something extra:)

This was a quick easy breakfast. I made it for our church so I doubled it. It was so good I will never made regular French toast again.

I really liked this.  It's so easy that I made it two days in a row.  Once for my family and once to take to my Bible study group.  I added an extra T of sugar both times.  The second time I subbed 2t pumpkin pie spice for all the spices - I didn't really notice that it made a difference.  My store didn't have Texas toast so I just used a regular one pound loaf.

This is a staple for Thanksgiving morning at our house - along with Starbucks Thanksgiving blend!  We use light whole wheat bread rather than Texas toast, and cut down on the topping, and it turns out just a good - but healthier!

Pretty good. Not very sweet. it's a good recipe for tweaking. I can see adding some cranberries,etc. or maybe some nuts to the topping. I will make it again, but I'll add in some extras next time.

This was fantastic and really easy to make too. I only made one serving for myself, so only used a single slice of bread, but it was great. It was sweet enough not to need any syrup too. Plus it made my whole kitchen smell fabulous. Will make again!

Perfectly simple and delicious.  Flavor is on point, with the pumpkin flavor making an appearance and keeping the egg batter nice and fluffy.  It was also very quick to whip up, so it might be a new Christmas morning tradition.  Definitely a repeat recipe!!!

I baked this the morning after Thanksgiving, and the family loved it.  My mom had been talking about pull-apart bread, and it worked the same way, and I encouraged them all to dip it in maple syrup.

Flat, bland taste. 
Very dry if you use a whole loaf.
Minimal pumpkin flavor. 
Would not make again. This recipe needs some major tweaking.

I followed the directions exactly (except i used biscuits instead of texas toast) and it was delicious.  I topped mine with powdered sugar and my husband used maple syrup. Both toppings worked well on this bake.Woke up this morning wishing I had some more. will definately be making this again.

So easy and so good.  Nice mix of sweet; not overbearing.  I think you could likely skip cubing the bread and just lay slices of bread down (saves a little on prep).  Worth a try!!

I made it for breakfast after Thanksgiving when I had family here to help eat it. I only used about half loaf of Texas bread and like some previous reviews I mixed it in a bowl & then poured into the pan. Everyone liked it - my husband loved it so it's a keeper. Next time may add some pecans --- didn't this time because I knew some of the kids didn't care for nuts.

This was a delicious and easy Thanksgiving day brunch. I couldn't find any Texas Toast and used a loaf of Challah bread instead. It worked perfectly. I also read the other reviews and tossed the bread in the egg mix before putting in the baking dish. This worked very well. Thanks for a great recipe.

I cut this recipe in half to serve 4.  There was entirely too much bread for one layer!  Didn't turn out good at all.  At least half of the bread had no pumpkin mixture on it and came out dry.  We could only eat the top.  Very disappointing.

There was way too much bread to make a single layer and not enough mixture to coat all the bread in the recipe.  Several prior reviewers reduced the amount of bread or added other ingredients which I should have done.  Coating the bread is a critical step.  The bottom half of my dish tasted like plain bread.  The top half was delicious.  Either double the recipe so there is sufficient pumpkin mix to coat all the bread or reduce the amount of bread.

Made this today and enjoyed it!  Like other reviewers noted, this dish offered just enough sweetness.  Other french toast bakes I've ever made or eaten were super sweet.  I used only 3/4 of the loaf of Texas toast.  Also, I sprayed my glass baking dish (13x9) generously with cooking spray before placing the bread cubes inside; mixing the cubes with the batter while in the baking dish didn't cause my finished product to stick.  Finally, I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top before serving each slice, which gave it just the right amount of extra sweetness.

Excellent! We used less bread (5 slices less of a loaf) and some of us added maple sirup or more brown sugar on their serving. Yummy!

Too dry, the bread is way to dry, flavor is good, I was not the only one who think like this, my guess were family and fried that gave me an honest opinion. Do not get confuse with so many 4 plus start, that was it motivated me to do it, very disapointed :(

I had such high hopes for this one, but my family voted it a "never make again" recipe. And we love pumpkin and french toast. The pumpkin part was not sweet enough. But we loved the topping. Perhaps we need to double the topping and mix some in with the bread.

This recipe is amazing.  Having left over pumpkin pie mix, I added it to the bottom of the pan before I added the bread.  I turned this creation into something new and exciting.  Highly recommended!!!!

Really good addition to any brunch menu, instead of texas toast bread I used bakery fresh egg bread and sliced it thick myself, I halved the recipe for a smaller family and used as a side dish rather than a main. Will definetely make again. I think I will try it with cinnamon bread too!

Like others I did not use Texas toast - but a loaf of cinnamon chip from Great Harvest Bread.  I left out the cinnamon, gloves and nutmeg and used 3 Tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Baked this in a disposable pan so I could give it as a gift - it was great!  You could also use a loaf of cinnamon swirl bread. I also added 1/2 cup cinnamon chips.

Delicious! I fixed it according to directions.  We put lite syrup on it and loved it.  Later we put cool whip on it, way yummy!  My husband thought it would make a great dessert as well, and it does!

Just made this for Thanksgiving breakfast and it was amazing, everyone loved it.  I tore off all the crust of the bread, then tore each slice into about 6 pieces and set aside while I mixed up the filling without the cloves, as we don't care for it. And as another reviewer said, I put the bread into the large mixing bowl and folded it together along with a big handful of pecan halves and then poured into the dish and sprinkled the topping on it. Cooked mine at 325 for 30 minutes. I had maple syrup, creamy whipped topping, and honey on the table. The whipped topping was the favorite. I will definitely make this over and over. What a delicious and easy dish.  Would make a good supper on a cool evening or as a dessert. 5 stars for sure!

My family is not a fan of pumpkin.  So, I substituted a can of apple pie filling.  And added pecans to the topping.  Yum!

Followed this recipe exactly (except added chopped walnuts to the topping). Was used to saturated bread for french toast. This was mostly just well-coated, not soggy - which made for a perfectly baked recipe! Crispy exterior with soft warm interior.  8 girls at PJ Bunco night ATE IT UP - literally.  Delicious. Perfect sweetness. A true new favorite!

Wonderful! Not to sweet. I made it for dinner, my family loves breakfast for dinner. There's only 3 of us and there was only 1/3 of the pan left. Made no changes at all. Was wonderful and will make again! Thank you.

Made this with the Cinnamon Swirl bread from Trader Joe's. Excellent!! One loaf is perfect for a 9x9 pan. I cut back by 3 eggs and a little on the spices since it's a smaller size than the Texas toast loaf.  Made topping with extra butter. Sprinkle of brown sugar or turbinado  sugar on top gives it a nice crispy   texture. A drizzle of bourbon barrel maple syrup just before serving was the perfect touch. I feel sorry for my gluten free friends..

This was awesome, I did make some changes based on other reviewers. Added more spices (used pumpkin spice vs individual spices) to the pumpkin mixture, at least a couple more teaspoons of pumpkin spice. Also we like sweetness so I added a spoon or two more sugar/brown sugar and with the topping I mixed extra brown sugar with a pack of maple and brown sugar oatmeal and a spoon of flour. Mixed it with the butter until crumble and it made an incredible topping. This was a filling, delicious breakfast treat and the kids especially loved it.

Love everything pumpkin and this was great. I mixed all the ingredients in my kitchenaide mixer until incorporated and then stirred in the bread cubes. Put it in a 9x12 glass pan sprayed with Pam and put the streusel on top with chopped pecans. Nice brunch treat. I used left over Italian bread but you can use any leftover bread. Served with a little real maple syrup or whipped cream.  Next time I will add raisins for a change.

I made it with 8 slices of homemade gluten free bread.  I added a couple tablespoons of molasses because I like that with pumpkin...though this time I made it with butternut squash...and 1/2c milk to ensure there would be enough liquid to soak the gluten free bread which is drier.  I mixed it with the bread in a bowl, then I let it set for 5-10 minutes to ensure a good soaking.  I originally thought there was too much topping for my 9x10 dish, but it was not too sweet.  I think a little salt would have livened up the flavor. Next time I will increase the cinnamon in the egg mixture by at least a teaspoon.  I baked for 40 minutes.  Using pumpkin...would it have been more flavorful?  The result was nevertheless very moist and rich...though my husband did put some syrup on his.  I could see where some whipped cream on top would be great.

I halved the recipe but did NOT half the cook time! When I took it out of the oven, the bread stuck to the bottom of the pan and it was hard to get out of the pan. I probably will not be making this again. Plus, I can taste the pumpkin flavor, but it just wasn't sweet enough. Maybe if I made the whole recipe, it would've been sweet enough.

This is fabulous! I’m grateful to whoever sent this recipe. I put another T. sugar in the pumpkin mixture, another T. butter and 1/3 c. Oatmeal. I made it the night before and held it in the fridge. After I let it set out for 15 minutes I baked it as directed.  This was wonderful! My husband must have told 7-8 times this French toast is really good!

Really easy to make.  I used Dave’s Killer Bread whole grain and it was delicious.  I did have an issue with it sticking to the dish.  I used coconut oil instead of spray.  Will try remixing in a bowl next time.

Do not use the whole loaf of bread, not enough wet ingredients to coat and soak the bread. If you do maybe add milk/cream to the wet ingredients, may make a difference. Not enough topping, turned into blobs of dark spots. Best to butter the whole top with more butter than called for then sprinkle the brown sugar. Probably won't make it again. I made it for a girls weekend breakfast, disappointed. It was thankfully eatable and tasty.

Not too sweet, drizzled with sugar free maple syrup.  I love cinnamon and pumpkin spice, so added extra, and added chopped walnuts to the topping.  The pumpkin is high in vitamin A and fiber, and all the eggs add lots of protein—makes for a pretty healthy breakfast!  And my picky husband even liked it .  Win win :)

Good recipe but seemed dry so added several splashes of half and half until it was moistened. Good thing I did because it was still a bit dry after baking. Had to add butter, salt, and honey to taste. I will definitely make this again, but add more milk or cream. Also I will double the crumb topping. That was awesome but not enough of it.

Made this for guests at my B&B.  They LOVED it!  It was light and not too sweet.  I served it with maple syrup on the side, but no one used it.  I altered the recipe a bit.  I cut the bread up smaller, to fill  the pyrex pan, and increased the eggs to 10.  There didn't seem like enough "batter" so I added 3/4 cup of milk.  It came out great and is definitely on our fall roster of sweet entrees.

I had a few issues with this recipe. First of all, there is no way that an entire loaf of Texas toast fits in just one layer of a 9x13 pan. Also, there is not enough liquid in this recipe. The pumpkin mixture was so thick that it did not soak into the bread. You need to add milk to the mixture before pouring it onto the bread so it actually soaks in.

This was a hit! Liked that there was no salt added to the recipe and very little sugar (other than 1 TBSP and the bread) is in this recipe! A little Vermont maple syrup drizzled made the breakfast dish POP!

This was delicious.  I cut the recipe In half because there are just two of us, and I actually cut up a  small loaf of pumpkin bread that I had that was a little stale to make this, and it was wonderfully delicious, using that, and a good way to use it up. Will make again when we have company.

I mixed in bowl and refrigerated overnight.  Crumb topping is just right amount of sweetness.  I used a dollop of Cool Whip and it was delicious!  Used a sliced, soft Italian bread, about 2/3 of the loaf.

The only change I made to the recipe was to sub pumpkin pie spice for the other spices. I made half a recipe with all of the topping and it turned out very tasty. My bad - I baked it too long because I think I expected it to bubble up or something. However, a quick warming in the micro and all is well and yummy. No syrup needed, could add butter to melt over it if you want that great flavor added! Thanks for a nice cool Fall morning recipe.

As usual, I make changes!  I added milk (I don't like things dry),  more vanilla, and drizzled maple syrup over the top.    This is a keeper though.  Next time I'll add some crushed pecans.  Perfect for fall or anytime.

This was so yummy, even my picky grandkids loved it! I added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts also.  I was afraid it would be a little dry, but it was fine. Just be sure to mix well before baking.  I will definitely make this again!

The turned out very well.  Both my children enjoyed it. It was not overly pumpkin flavored which was good for my son who is not a big fan.  I prepared it the night before (without the topping) and refrigerated it.  Pulled it out in the morning and while the oven was heating up, I made the topping.  A few other comments said it was dry, I think refrigerating it for the night helps all the bread to soak in the pumpkin and egg mixture.  It did not turn out dry at all for us.  Will make this again.

I used 18 small eggs and sliced French bread  as the store didn't have Texas Toast bread.  I se read it to my morning Bible Study and they all loved it.  I will certainly make it again.

Made just as recipe was written with two small changes - used challah bread and added about 1/4 Cup of egg nog just because. Wasn't quite as eggy tasting as regular French toast but was still good. The pumpkin flavor was not heavy. If I didn't know pumpkin was used in it, I probably wouldn't have guessed it was in there. I would probably make this again

I actually used left over rolls to make this after Thanksgiving and it turned out pretty good! My whole family liked it.  I would recommend eating it with some maple syrup if you try this and you like a little extra flavor and sweetness.

I really enjoyed this and will make again. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't make adjustments, though admit that I found the instructions confusing; the loaf of Texas toast was two to three layers in the 9x13 pan so I went with the full loaf. Perfect.

The first time I used just half a loaf of regular whole wheat bread. I substituted pumpkin pie filling instead of the pumpkin puree since I had some leftover. It would have been better without the topping or with plain pumpkin. The recipe was too sweet. The next time I used 8 slices of bread but mixed the pieces in the bowl with the batter before placing in the pan. I followed the recipe's pumpkin & sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet. I used a cup of egg whites and 2 whole eggs each time, as I typically do when making french toast. 1/6 of the pan of my healthier version is 224 calories and has 12 grams of protein.

I added about a 1/3 c. of milk because it definitely looked like it was too thick and not enough liquid for the amount of bread.  It was still not enough liquid. I'd make it again but would add at least a cup of milk and would soak the bread for at least an hour before baking. The taste was good although the topping was a little too sweet, especially if you want to serve this with maple syrup.

I couldn't find texas toast so I used the Franciscan brand of French bread and it came out great.You probably won't have to use the entire loaf(just about 3/4). This dish was just the right amount of sweetness. Very easy to make.

Made this for brunch, very easy to make. I  used french bread  instead  and mixed it with  the pumpkin mix til incorporated then added it to the pan.   It wasn't sweet at all, pecans or raisins would have been a great addition.  Whip cream would have been tasty on top too.

It was a little dry. I liked the first few bites, but I want to go through and look through some more reviews. My 12 and 13 year old daughters didn't like it, but my 11 year old son loved it and had 2nd helping. I will try it again, but I'm not sure how to get it more moist.

This was honestly really yummy but doesn't taste like pumpkin at all.  Either double the pumpkin and the spices or you just get a yummy bread pudding type breakfast.

Amazed at the lack of pumpkin flavor with this. I used 7 cups dried bread cubes, 4 eggs, 4 egg whites. 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 cup fat free half and half. Added the half and half because the mixture was really thick. Let sit overnight. Definitely stir together in a bowl instead of trying to pour this thick mixture over the bread cubes. No topping. Glad I dried out the cubes first or this would have been to soggy for me.

This was a fantastic recipe! My kids loved it and the only thing is I think I would up the measurements for the topping part of the recipe since it was so very good!

Didn't like the texture.  Middle was to mushy.

I was so excited to try this for breakfast and it was just one headache after another. First it took me five stores to find the heavy texas toast. Then when I made it I was so disappointed. The flavors didn't come together well wasn't very pumpkiney. Just all together fell flat for me.

Recipe was good but I thought it could use milk, the mixture was thick and the casserole was a little dry. The taste was good though.

I really wasn't impressed with this recipe.  I had a hard time tasting the pumpkin over all the sugar.  I won't be making this again.  And boy did it stick to the pan!  I even sprayed it with Pam before.

This recipe is delicious!  The only substitution I make is the flour in the topping.  I switch it out with about oats by adding and mixing in oats until it's really crumbly.

I loved it and it was so easy. I did double the topping as I didn't think that it was enough for the whole casserole.

Fantastic way to start a weekend morning. I used wheat english muffins instead and half the egg batter w just whites. We drizzled a little honey on after we plated and it was truly a delightful way to start this fall season! Not only was it delicious but our house smelled so homey and spicy.

I know its a little early for all-things-pumpkin, but I couldnt help it... I made this recipe this morning and it was amazing! I added a little more sugar to the pumpkin mix and a few mini cubes of butter on top right before popping in the oven. I will def make this again :)
